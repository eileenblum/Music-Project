I look at the wall.
And what do you see there?
I see my light slowly dying.
Silence!
It's finished and gone.
Nothing you can do, just wait for it to come.

Finished, nearly finished, it must soon be done
I say to myself; the light is extinguished
Despite the fact I never saw it lit it's gone

All around is a static void; shown as an empty hole
Forever gray, stranded between night and day
No doubt, for the end is here
Yes, it's time it ended

What time is it?
The same as usual.
Have you looked?
Yes it's Zero.
Go!
Why do you keep me?
There's no one else.
Life long the same answers.

Finished, nearly finished, it must soon be done
I say to myself; the light is extinguished
Despite the fact I never saw it lit it's gone

All around is a static void; shown as an empty hole
Forever gray, stranded between night and day
No doubt, for the end is here
Yes, it's time it ended: stop

Portraying a world close its end
But returning and always repeating itself
A chronic pattern, emptiness of time
Progressing to oblivion

It isn't dark.
I'm asking you is it light?
Absent, always. Let's stop playing!
Never!
Cover me with the sheet.
Your last soliloquy?
My final poetry.

Finished, nearly finished, it must soon be done
I say to myself; the light is extinguished
Despite the fact I never saw it lit it's gone

All around is a static void; shown as an empty hole
Forever gray, stranded between night and day
No doubt, for the end is here
Yes, it's time it ended
