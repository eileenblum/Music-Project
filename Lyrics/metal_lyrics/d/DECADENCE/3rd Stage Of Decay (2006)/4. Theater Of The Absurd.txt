Beginnings and endings are intertwined
Existence is cyclical, delays of time
I want to return and reverse what went wrong
I haven't seen it for so long

Roaming through a monotonous road
I see the light pass before my eyes
So many doubts and memories to hold
I'm so desperate to cut these ties

Pay no mind to my demise
Say it's right this time
Do you fear this distress?
Doesn't at all feel right like this

I hunger for control
Taking back my soul
I live my life through you
Theater of the absurd

Individual moments that make up a life
Like a losing player's final moves to demise
The analogy should hold a self-conscious cage
Whatever it takes to get through one more stage

Roaming through a monotonous road
I see the light pass before my eyes
Who can you trust but your shadow?
The one always in sight by your side

Pay no mind to my demise
Say it's right this time
Do you fear this distress?
Doesn't at all feel right like this

I hunger for control
Taking back my soul
I live my life through you
Theater of the absurd

Burying my claws in the frozen floor
Not even pain can I feel anymore
A naked stage, symbolically portrayed
I'd rather burn out than to fade away

Roaming through a monotonous road
I see the light pass before my eyes
I wake up alone, in this place I call home
It's rusty and gray, I'm drowning in me

Pay no mind to my demise
Say it's right this time
Do you fear this distress?
Doesn't at all feel right like this

I hunger for control
Taking back my soul
I live my life through you
Theater of the absurd
