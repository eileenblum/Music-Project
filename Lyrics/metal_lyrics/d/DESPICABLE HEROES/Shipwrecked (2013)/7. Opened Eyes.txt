Now, with my back against the wall,
I canât take no longer
This flame is overwhelming,
But the light still is stronger

âTill now my eyes were closed,
This shadow feeds my anger
The truth of tomorrow,
This dream wonât pass no longer

Scream, out of your hearts!
Pray, for a new beginning

Scream, scream for this,
Pray, for a new beginning!
