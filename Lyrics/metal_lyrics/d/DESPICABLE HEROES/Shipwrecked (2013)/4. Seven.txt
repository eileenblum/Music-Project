For tomorrow, not today
I will see you, face to face
And youâll bribe me, I can tell
In all this suffer you will dwell
Pack your guns, raise your knife
youâll be running for your life
Thank to God, if you survive today
for youâre the one to asphyxiate

Like vultures we fly high and higher,
This is what brings us to the fight, tonight, tonight
Set the trap, wake the dead, see in my eyes, you liar!
Just stab me in the back and collect the fire that burns in my eyes.

Camping around, around the fire.
for we are consuming bones.
The ship is lost and weâre all dying
but our king still holds his throne.

And youâll see, this treachery,
for we are the fire through the light
And when all your sorrow becomes a misery,
what is left for you, is internal night

Like vultures we fly high and higher,
This is what brings us to the fight, tonight, tonight
set the trap, wake the dead, see in my eyes, you liar!
Just stab me in the back and collect the fire that burns in my eyes.
