Here I lay broken, within my dreams
All hope is lost, so it seems
Water surrounding me, let in the light
Iâm not giving in, I wonât lose this fight!

Be prepared for it is coming, you must decide
Do you choose for humbleness or do you pick your pride?
Does your mind makes your decisions, or are you lead by heart?
Will you take the easy way or pick the hardest path?

Are you dead like me, uneasy to find.
Know! that your purpose canât be denied.
Set sail for your dreams, chase down them all!
Kill the horizon, destroyer you will crawl!

This is your final goodbye and you know it!
