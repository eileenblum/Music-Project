I will never, ever want to see your face again.
Get out, and let me be before I lose control.
Get out, let me be your martyr murderer.

Here I stand, when all hope is lost.
Here I stand alone, beware if you want to cross.

Not! Your! Every Sunday morning, where lives were made all new.
Your light has set my heart on fire, Your word ignites the fuse.
And do you forgive me for all those things I said to you.
Just tear my heart apart, for all I care about is you.
