I want you to know that you are out of my mind
I want you to know that you have crossed the line
There is no turning back now, no turning back now!

Walk out the door and just let me be
It wonât go unnoticed, you wonât sets me free
That look in your eyes makes me wanna stay
Even though we know we wont make it one day
Until the point of no return

The difference in us, has teared us apart
Neglected the feelings all along, form the start
Weâd knew we wouldnât make it, decisions were wrong.
But the one thing I do know, this makes me strong!
Until the point of no return

Oh I want you to know!
