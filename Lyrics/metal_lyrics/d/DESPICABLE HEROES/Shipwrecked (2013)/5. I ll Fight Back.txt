Today is the day,
we all find our way
Today is the day,
we all fade away
Today is the day,
we all retaliate
Today is the day
Today is the day,
we all suffocate
Today is the day,
we all make you pray
Today is the day,
we all break away
Today is the day

Today itâs not clear, what weâre thinking,
For all we know this ship is sinking!

IâLL FIGHT BACK

Today is the day,
we all fade away
Today is the day,
we all suffocate
Today is the day,
we all break away
Today is the day

Today itâs not clear, what weâre thinking,
For all we know this ship is sinking!

IâLL FIGHT BACK
