Not dead, not alive,
this world Iâm living in
So dark and torn apart,
itâs a pity being

I donât care what you think,
this world needs itâs rescuing
All your lines fall apart,
within your own black heart

Run like hell, youâll never make it.
Cause Iâm coming for you.
This is the end letâs face it.
I will bury you!
No memories left behind,
No track to follow you back.
No love within your heart.
Only grey fade to black!
