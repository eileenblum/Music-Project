Walls, bring down your walls.
For we are but alone in this broken world.

Behold our walls, you find shelter in a temple of dirt.

This is our final hour, we all have to repent.
When we donât, this ship goes down and that will be the end for all of us,
whoâs life just ends up to bits, broken but still in one piece, this wonât be the end of it!

Walls, no longer divided by walls.
