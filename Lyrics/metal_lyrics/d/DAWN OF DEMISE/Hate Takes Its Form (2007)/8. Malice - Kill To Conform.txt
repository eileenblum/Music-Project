Kill

Create the faith â eliminate
Kill to conform - absolution

Bring to me my vision
Eternal victory
A soulless fantasy
Our hatred for man
Our hatred for man

Kill

Force-feed our rule in submission
We normalize â revelation

Bring to me my vision
Endless butchery
Fatal catastrophe
The time is now

We deny, their past shall not endure
We bring the future
This wretched plan will bring the end for man

They seem to believe
That somehow they will be free
But no
