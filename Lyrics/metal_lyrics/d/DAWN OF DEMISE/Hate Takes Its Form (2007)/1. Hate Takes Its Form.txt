As wrath comes alive in me
Hate takes its form
Restraint oblivious and lives are lost

It takes me down
Where the anger races still
It makes me high to kill and kill again

All known is beneath me
Iâll take it all away
This strength leaves behind 1,000 dead

One rule â donât fuck with me
I reign in scorn
And hate takes its form

All known is beneath me
Iâll take it all away
This strength leaves behind 1,000 dead

Comprehend â this feed
Destiny â is mine
Redecline â your lives

The source for brutality deep in the mind
Our human ways are in decline

Hate takes its form
