Iâll take the blood from their veins
Iâll punish them
Iâll banish strength
Attack the presence of man â eliminate
I relinquish all
All is slain

Anger rages within the flesh
Life turns into nothingness

Life now seems meaningless
As it fades away â away from them
Attack the presence of man â eliminate
I relinquish all
All is slain

Now time will change me

Then I will kill all of them 
Taking lives configured in sin
Theyâll fall to me
Anger again â I am pain

Then I will kill all of them 
Taking lives configured in sin
Theyâll fall to me
Anger again â I am pain

Anger rages within the flesh
Life turns into nothingness

I am the ruler of all, now Iâve conquered them
I shall start again
