Take the origin of life from me
And I will lead you astray
Let your energy succumb to me
Then youâll see
The entire depth of me

I am ready to die

Break the pulse of god
Endure the wrath of the impure

Iâll take them down with me to the end

Move the destiny secured for us
And we will praise the day
Writhe in the vile to finish us
Then weâll see
Sickening impurity

I am ready to die 

Break the pulse of god
Endure the wrath of the impure
Impurity

Bleed me
