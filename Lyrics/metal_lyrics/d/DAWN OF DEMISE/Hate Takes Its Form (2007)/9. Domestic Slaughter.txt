Carve the flesh, prepare for me dead meat
I will feast on the foetus of my seed
Eradicate, desecrate, annihilate
Suffocate, the carnivores hate

Torture â incapable of feeling
A life nurtured by murder
Neglect â I carve the blood
Salvation

Raping bodies that were willing
I cut the love that wants me
Killing â domestic slaughter
I relish on the unborn

Sick hate â slice the bitch and cut her
Let her bleed to death â bloodlust

I will take their blood and shot them up
Set my rage upon them
Set my rage upon them

Sick hate â slice the bitch and cut her
Let her bleed to death â bloodlust
