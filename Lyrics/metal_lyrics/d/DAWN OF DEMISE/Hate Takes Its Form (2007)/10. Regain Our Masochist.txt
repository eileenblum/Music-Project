Uncreate the past â subdue it
A new day has dawned, weakness left behind
More powerful than ever, prepare to attack
Unleash your deadliness

Superiority â abstain popularity
Remove the pessimist, regain our masochist

Dedicate your life and all
Slay the prejudice, live to dominate
Overtake and remove them, prepare to attack
Release your deadliness

Final domination â pass the energy
Encourage the optimist, regain our masochist

Suffer, obliterate â existing to dominate

Bloodpumping hatred will arise

Overtake and remove them, prepare to attack
Release your deadliness

The world is our battlefield

Superiority â abstain popularity
Remove the pessimist, regain our masochist
