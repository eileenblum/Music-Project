They are despicable to you
Youâll kill â then speak the truth

When life has no worth to you
You then show them what you are
Degrading

Low lives â expendable weakness
These traps to set them free

When life has no worth to you
You then show them what you are
Degrading

The answer lies within the centre of hypocrisy
In denial â a deadly destiny

In for the kill
To feed his dying will
In for the kill
As time stands still

These lives are aligned with mine
