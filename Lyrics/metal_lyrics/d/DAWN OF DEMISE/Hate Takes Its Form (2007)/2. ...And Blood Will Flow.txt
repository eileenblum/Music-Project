Bleeding now for the world to see
Iâll bleed for eternity
Painful end for those whoâve never seen
This show is mine and all will die

I am the killer coming for you
I am your conscience too

â¦And blood will flow

Killing them who set the norm for us
Iâll kill them with my deadly touch
Sorrow is the only thing I feel
This part is yours and all will die

Remember me

I am the killer coming for you
Iâll be your conscience too

Kill whatever beckons me
I want the world to see
I want the world to see
