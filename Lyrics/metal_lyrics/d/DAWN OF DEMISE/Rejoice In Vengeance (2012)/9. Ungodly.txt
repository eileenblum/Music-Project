Come see the future of our kind
It lies in the hands of them
Those who see beyond this wretched soil
And know what can be reached

They see it for they know all
Bring the age of the unknowing martyr

Remove the skin to see within
Our boundaries can be breached
Then we will extract the eternity
From this form that bleeds

Torturous hell to give them what they need
They will instigate

Force her, bring the torture
Skinned alive so to see the future
This may seem ungodly
They will revelate

They see it for they know all
Bring the age of the unknowing martyr

They see it, for they know all
Bring the age of him
Come see the future
The future of our kind

Force her, bring the torture
Skinned alive so to see the future
This may seem ungodly
They will revelate

They will instigate
They will revelate
