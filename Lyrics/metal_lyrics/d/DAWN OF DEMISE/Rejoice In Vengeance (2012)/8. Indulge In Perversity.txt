All normal things seem strange in
Eyes of indifference
Raise the range, see the pain
Feel the lust of a mind insane
When pain equals joy
The maniacal thrusts in torture

As agony comes alive yet another time
Indulge in perversity

Degrade the whole but wanting more
Bring pain, her womb destroyed by insertion
When pain equals joy
And horror equals bliss

As agony comes alive yet another time
Indulge in perversity

When her pain excites
And her death is so fulfilling

He'll cum so violently
He's the thing we all strive to be
He's all, he's insanity
Release the sadist

Indulge in perversity
