Creeping and lurking just to find my victim
Stabbing and slicing now to make her willing
Embrace the blade

I lie in wait

Cutting and carving
The immaculate slaughter
Where blood arouses

I welcome the feast

Screaming, she's twitching
Started my feeding
Take a bite of life
It's intimacy with a knife

I feed on flesh

Cutting and carving
The immaculate slaughter
Where blood arouses

I will never be satisfied with living
Existing for killing the lives that make me sick
I hate everything - murder... oh, I do like the murder

The immaculate slaughter
