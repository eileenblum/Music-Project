Show me your fear
For it calls to me
Another weapon and another kill
Grasp my insane rage
As it pours from me
And his dying body

Remove the stench of a treacherous soul
And rejoice in vengeance

I'll bleed them dry

I take distance from slime
They repulse me
Get rid of them to be free of them
Then just slay them all
I relish the kill
Brings their bodies to the ground

Bring their bodies to the ground

Remove the stench of a treacherous soul
And rejoice - rejoice in vengeance
