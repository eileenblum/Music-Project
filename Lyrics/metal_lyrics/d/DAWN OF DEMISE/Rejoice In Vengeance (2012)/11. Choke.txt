Fighting against the pain
Feeling the strain again, it owns me
Do you want blood, then I'm the one
Inflict a deadly wound
Sever the veins to gain victory
So you want blood, I'll make you suffer

First I'll hurt you and stab you, then choke you
Sensations complete as I fucking choke you

Murder is sweet relief
Engulfed in hate, again, my cleansing
Insanity is my clarity

First I'll hurt you and stab you, then choke you
Sensations complete

The loss of life, in his eyes, his treachery
The cold chill of death is perfection

Come, bring me my reign
It's eternal

Motherfucker
