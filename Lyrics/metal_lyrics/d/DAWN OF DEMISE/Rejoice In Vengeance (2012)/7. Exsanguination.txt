His mind prepares itself for another attack
Horrid feast for this killing beast
He will free the blood
Insane he waits for the filth
He wants to remove
It dies, he cries - "Let me open you up"

Exsanguination - see the blood flow over him

He stabs, it bleeds - this quenching is what he achieves
They die, his high
He feeds on their souls

Exsanguination - see the blood flow over him

Drain the life, all life - it makes you whole again
Then you can reach the ned

Exsanguinated and eviscerated

Bloodlust
Break their cycle of life before my evil eyes
I can feel their pain rise inside
