I'll dispose of bodies
For their stench makes me sick
Chopping them up, dismemberment of the rot
I am one with the rotting
For they arouse me
Feeding the urge, the devourment of the sick

Bring the dead inside
To fulfill atrocities
Once warm shell will witness my hell

Forcefeed them with their own remains
Self mutilation the only way
To stay alive in this hideous trap
i enforce the act

The act of persecution
The epitome of brutality
When the weak can stay alive no more
It's the epitome of brutality

I bathe in their blood
This is my cleansing
I gag on the rot
Release me, the insatiable

Forcefeed them with their own remains
Self mutilation the only way
To stay alive in this hideous trap
I enforce the act
