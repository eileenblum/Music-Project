When you long to be in adversity
So feel the truth and be gone
For we all knew
Hatred kept rising

We drink to your demise

Bathing int he lies of your treachery
Divert paths, we strive to be strong again
You're unworthy

We drink to your demise

Bathing in the lies of your treachery
Divert paths, we strive to be strong again
You're unworthy

We drink to your demise

Feel our bludgeoning
Now bring the butchery

When you lie all bloodied
Feel the strength of my force
I am power, you are nothing
Nothing will be left of you
Once I am done with you
We will trample, we will rise

Convulsing whilst you're hurt and you're bleeding
Relief, when you're dead and buried

We, we drink to your demise
We, I said we drink, to your demise
