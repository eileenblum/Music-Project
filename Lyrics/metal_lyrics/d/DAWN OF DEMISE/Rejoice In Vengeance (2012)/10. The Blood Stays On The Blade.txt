When the urge compels once more
Remember the words - the rule
The doctrine tells us

The blood stays on the blade
To show them who has the power
The blood stays on the blade
This killing reign is forevermore

We rule... come again... we rule

The restraints are now removed
Our killings will reach immense proportions

Now turn the blade around and remember

The blood stays on the blade
To show them who has the power
The blood stays on the blade
This killing reign is forevermore

We maim, we slay - our strength breaks the grain
They fall, they cover - we are the absolute power
