So sick, within him lies the madness
A fury that never lseeps
A neverending hate
Ready to thrive again

He rises again
He rises again
And again and again

None will ever
Comprehend the depths of him

The evil has awoken
And now it attacks

He rises again
He rises again
And again and again

He will never
He will never sleep again
