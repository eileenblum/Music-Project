Disintegrate the form that shapes our reality
This affliction, so overwhelming
Bring the seed, bring the end of time
We seek this redemption

We need it to empower
The coming of our resolute hour
Feel the end of the leeching
For we stand tall

Breeding the newer and superior man
This affliction is perfection

Destroy the weakest man
And negate all indifference

We need it to expand
The future of our absolute truth
See the back of the powerless
As we rise above

Excelling in depopulation through this war
And removal of the weak
Now bring the scourge, yeah!
