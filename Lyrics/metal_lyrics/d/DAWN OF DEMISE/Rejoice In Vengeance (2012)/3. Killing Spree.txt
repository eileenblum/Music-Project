Remnants of what they were meant to be
Lies buried deep within his tormented mind
Taking their lives to ensure his place
In the fiery rest
Feel his pain rain upon you

He will kill us all for he needs us
To elude his own monstrosity
Killing spree

Hell seems to feed him, lead him

Breaking the mold of the normal gaze in every way
Dissect to unleash the rage
Having a close connection with the dying flesh
Let the fear flow away from you

He will kill us all for he needs us
To elude his own monstrosity
Killing spree

Leaving the hatred
To foresee through his dying rest
His soul is freed from flesh

Forcing his will upon them
