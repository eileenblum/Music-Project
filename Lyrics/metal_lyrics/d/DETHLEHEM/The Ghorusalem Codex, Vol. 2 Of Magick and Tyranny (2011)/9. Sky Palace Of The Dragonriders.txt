Plunge deep into the blue and white 
As The Aerial clan defends from all plight 
The Mountains await us, and we must take heed 
Prepare to launch upon your winged steed 

Gliding Across These Plains 
Surround Enemies In Flames 

Long Ago, Two Kingdoms Did Rise 
A struggle for power that both had complied 
Yet the scrolls discovered led their way 
riding upon winged steeds 

And they did both lift up into the sky 
For now, thy fallen kingdoms, one shall arise 

Gliding Across These Plains 
Surround Enemies In Flames 
In your heart, you know who reigns 
Dragonrider, Claim This Day 

We are the chosen ones 
Bound upon wings of blood 
The Journey awaits on high 
We Are The Kings Of The Skies 

Mount Up And Prepare to take the flight 
Twist underneath the clouds and rip the Wyvern's shattered maw
The leader waits, beyond the haze, we must destroy them all 

Gliding Across These Plains 
Surround Enemies In Flames 
In your heart, you know who reigns 
Dragonrider, Claim This Day
