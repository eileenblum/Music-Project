Look Upon This Crown as it does, Shine 
Ripped from the skulls of foes which heads refined 

This gold shall last us till the end of time 
We shall save our land from it's great decline 

Roaming through the lands that find us 
Let us put this day behind us 
Raise your hand and sing forth your honor 
As we sit upon, Glorious Treasures 

From the scourge which laugh and bathe in thyme 
we now claim the wealth, you hath deprived 

We travel now to our only home 
join us now in this hymn etched in stone 

Roaming through the lands that find us 
Let us put this day behind us 
Raise your hand and sing forth your honor 
As we sit upon, Glorious Treasures 

(ohhh, oh oh oh) 

Roaming through the lands that find us 
Let us put this day behind us 
Raise your hand and sing forth your honor 
As we sit upon, Glorious Treasures
