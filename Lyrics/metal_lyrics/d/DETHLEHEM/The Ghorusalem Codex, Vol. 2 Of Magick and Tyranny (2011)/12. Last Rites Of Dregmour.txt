Steady now, and forward on 
Let not revenge cloud your sight 

From the surface, lay them down, sharpened whispers of the wrongly dead 
Cursed fortress, drenched in death, lay waste to their thoughts of
hierarchy 
Hearts forever bleed 
entombed in infamy 

The fallen is what has led here 
Ready arms, and none shall be spared 
Take the throne, kill whatâs left 

Armies scatter, he screams aloud 
Skulls are shattered, flesh removed from bone 
âProtect the warlock!â the leader cries 
And in an instant, the sky did ignite 
Dragons taken flight 
Led by Neildorphâs battle cry 

The Fallen is what has led here 
Ready arms, and none shall be spared 
Clutching gasp upon his chair 
No longer but a dying heir 

And what of our own home, abolished eternally 
How do we return now, as night fades 

With all of the court, stained with red 
inside me, I truly feel no rest 
My soul ripped out from my chest 

And what of adventure 
Taking whatâs left of me 
I have become like you 
I have no soul 
have no soul 
have no soul 

Nothing is what 
what we have 
Lifting up his staff 
Incanting the spellcast 
and laughing into his death 
Exiled and outcast 
and outcast 
and outcast 

Welcome your boundless destiny
