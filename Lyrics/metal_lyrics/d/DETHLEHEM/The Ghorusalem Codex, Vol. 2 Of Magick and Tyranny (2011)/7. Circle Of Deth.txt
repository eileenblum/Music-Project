In the hearts of all mankind 
there has been 
thirsts of power 
the betrayed warlock 
an unsound mind 
begun his way 
into his wrathful hour 

In long past they were brought here 
Bled before the fire 
As they lay with all limbs pinned 
Awaiting the Circle Of Deth 

From cursed magicks and the banished spells 
invoked by him, to rip open 
Spoken from a blackened tongue 
armies blindly led 
and gathered all 

In long past they were brought here 
Bled before the fire 
As they lay with all limbs pinned 
Awaiting the Circle Of Deth 
Take my hand and bring me there 
Bled under desire 
Conjured bleak with their own lives 
Awaiting the Circle Of Deth 

Had they no choice? 
From their fate? 

They all walked 
mournful over the evocation 
and they all bled 
dripping innocent 
Green to red 
the ground was soiled sacrilegious 
Silence now for all of their screams 

And Dregmourâs laughter into thereafter 
shall forever stain their ghosts 

In long past they were brought here 
Bled before the fire 
As they lay with all limbs pinned 
Awaiting the Circle Of Deth 
Take my hand and bring me there 
Bled under desire 
Conjured dark with their own lives 
Awaiting the Circle Of Deth 

Fate
