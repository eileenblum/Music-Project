[Narrator:]
Surrounded by low growls and echoes of screams, the collective
makes it way into the Eternal Abandon. 

[Hildor:]
Keep your mind steadfast, as we cannot see into the distance. 
[Lord Bonecrush:]
Brom, keep the torch high. We need to be ready for
anything. 
[Overlord Brom:]

[Lord Bonecrush:]
Good. 

[Narrator:]
A faint voice reaches their ears. They approach a withered old
man who is down to the bone. 

[The Keeper:]
Over here! I knew youâd come! 
[Lord Bonecrush:]
Old man, are you one of the ancient beings? 
[The Keeper:]
Yes, however, I am being held captive by a foul being
resurrected by Dregmour. 
[Davidicus:]
Dregmour? Who is this you speak of? 
[The Keeper:]
â¦......S-Sorry I fell asleep, what? 
[Collective:]
DREGMOUR! 
[The Keeper:]
Oh, he is the man you seek behind this slaughter,
he....nevermind that now, I will tell you everything, but now you must free
me before..oh no it may be too late! 
[Overlord Brom:]
MFF! 
[Lord Bonecrush:]
Brom is right, READY YOUR ARMS! 
[The Keeper:]
The SPELLJAMMER!
