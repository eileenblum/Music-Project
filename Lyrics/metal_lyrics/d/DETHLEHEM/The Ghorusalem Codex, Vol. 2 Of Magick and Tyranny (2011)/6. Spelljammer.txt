We must burrow down 
hidden leader amongst the cults 
Crush stone and you shall reveal 

Yet blinding light is the only way you shall stand a chance 

Eye of the Deep, step inside and tread on hallowed grounds 
The blinding light is the only way you will stand a chance 
Hunter of weak, Master Of Bleak, a spell that can penetrate your soul 
Spelljammer, he has risen and now he is now part of you 

Born before time, the paradigm 
living among you, knowledge beyond you 
long forgotten, through ages of blood 
masterminding, and plotting his rise 

Fallen brothers under ended fray, unrest dealt into their sunken graves 
as you place your hands upon the blade, prepare to deal your hand of fate 

Scarred by his pride, he waits, inside 
He betrayed his own, now stands, alone 
Beholder at side, shall drain your life 
Black Power is honed, in caverns low 
His hollowed eyes blind 

Taking his hold on whatâs inside of me 

Ancient Being 
Free him now before 
The floating watchdog 
it moves upon 
it moves now, upon us, with silence and terror 
Your heavy breathing must be kept at low 
Rip open itâs eyelid and drive forth your broadsword 
It cries out, it slides down, shattering screaming 
The beast motionless, the eye is lifeless 
but now his master has discovered 
The Keeper freed now speaks the lore 

Yet blinding light cannot save you no, you will die 

Eye of the Deep, step inside and tread on hallowed grounds 
The blinding light is the only way you will stand a chance 
Hunter of weak, Master Of Bleak, a spell that can penetrate your soul 
Spelljammer, he has risen and now he is now part of you 

Blaring growl, falls upon your ears, pillars shake and crumble 
He hath risen and now, he is part of you
