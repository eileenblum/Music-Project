[Narrator:]
Upon return, the warriors discovered their home had been
completely destroyed. Fires raged around them and bodies lay strewn upon
the ground in a circular pattern. 

[Lord Bonecrush:]
What madness is this!?!?! 
Hildor: Sanity be damned, what is capable of such horrors? 

[Narrator:]
A woman raised her bloodied arm to signal the collective over to
her, gasping for air, she spoke barely audibly. 

[Dying Woman:]
They...they rained death upon us like the showers of the morn.
There was no chance to defend ourselves. 
[Bovice:]
Who were they? Did you see their faces? 
[Dying Woman:]
There were hordes descended upon us, led by a man with
blackened crimsoned eyes and a glow that you could see over the hills...we
accepted defeat before battle. 
[Bovice:]
Wretched fools, shall pay for their insatiable death run. 
[Dying Woman:]
EUUUUUGGGHHHHH 

[Narrator:]
And with...And with that....AND WITH THAT SHE PERISHED. Davidicus
then spoke. 

Davidicus: I know what has taken place here, I have heard tales of the
ancients which hold secret powers. This land bleeds deep. 
[Lord Bonecrush:]
What must we do now? 
Davidicus: Find....The Keeper.
