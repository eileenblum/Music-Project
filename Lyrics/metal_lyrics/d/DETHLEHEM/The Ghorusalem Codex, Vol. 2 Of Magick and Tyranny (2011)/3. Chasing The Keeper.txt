Before the dawn of time, there was a race of people all unknown
Birthed from the divine, each of them had all stood alone 

The Keepers had not known, what power they bestowed 

And define the way, my keeper, I seek you day and night 
you are the key to the location of my enemies 
Define the way, thy keeper, for travel beyond 
Of all that waits thy keeper, because i am, but blind, but blind 
Define the way, thy keeper, I shall seek your kind 
Of all that waits thy keeper, I know weâre, but blind, traveling, for
thine 

Following unknown traces, yet these seem familiar places 
question and force weâve taken, your race has been forsaken 
blood and gold, myths have awakened, and find 

The wretched force they had claimed their slaughter 
peasants robbed of their lives, lying there, sons and daughters 
And in their slime, they all shall writhe, plagued, damned and fallen 
Confined in deadly quarters, darkness held high above our shoulders 
With the choking answer in our grasp, the knowledge spoken now 

âHe lies, beyond the bladesâ 

Fingers crossing the map, the tortured hand did show the way 
âBeyond the valley, the abandon holds the man you seekâ 
Coughing the blood from low, a cruel smile written upon his face
âNo man has ever left once setting foot upon that placeâ 

Define the way, thy keeper, for travel beyond 
Of all that waits thy keeper, because i am, but blind, but blind 
Define the way, thy keeper, for travel beyond 
Of all that waits thy keeper, because i am, but blind, traveling, upon time
