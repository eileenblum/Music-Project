Crystalized heavens await thee, above the darkened green 
Through the mist, pushing on, blood pumping deafening 
Lands of Solace 

But what Iâve learned in this journey, is to heed uncertainty 
Not knowing yet, always upon ready 
We all deal, with what come may and strike to slay 
Landing draws near, with deep breath, pull the reins and approach now 
Dismount and Venture 

Behind The Gates 
Lies the keys 
To Eternity 
In Wait 
For You 
That Take 
You Through 

I have seen what all awaits 
This place you will find shall wield your fate 
Walk inside and find the truth 
Hypergates Of Infinitude 

What found, remains of yore 
No sounds but whispered lore 
Clear walls, cracked and torn 
Yet now, the final gate has formed 

Behind The Gates 
Lies the keys 
To Eternity 
In Wait 
For You 
That Take 
You Through 

There is but one, run to the stone, and speak the runes 

A light forms of grand display 
Destined to guide uncharted way 
Walk inside and find all truths 
Hypergates Of Infinitude 

Donât blink thine eyes, we ride upon light, through ages of what has past
and what will emerge 

Raised by nobility, told tales and slept sound upon the bedtime stories 
of keepers and finding keys to eternity 

And you, my only friends, walk with me, through these voids 
The dirt that rises 
rises now overhead 

and with a flash, Silence rains upon us, nothing seen, and nothing felt 

Dregmour! Yours approaches now!
