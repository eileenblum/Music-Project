The sun does shine over our backs 
And no matter what 
Eyes aim forward, past this heat and sweat 
dust clouds reveal the rocks 

The glimpse of horrors laying dormant 
burrowed throughout these hills 
All the torment, for years that forewent, their souls the evil filled 

Pressing on, remains of that passed through, they met their end 
Then before our eyes, they appeared, the flesh scarce from them

With deadly cold steel, and skeletal hordes decapitate those that near 
In their screams, stating their plea, join us now, you belong here 

Decades of screams and carnage were made 
Yet the night fades, Upon the Valley Of Blades 

Tread this desert sand, the oath we've defied 
Take up your sword and turn bone into dust 

And what of their birthing, of screams and decay 
Trapped forever, stopping what comes this way 
Many years have past, countless lives were claimed 
Aimless wandering led by a soulâs eternal flame 
Put them to rest now, a quiet whispering 
âI return now to familiar and at peaceâ
