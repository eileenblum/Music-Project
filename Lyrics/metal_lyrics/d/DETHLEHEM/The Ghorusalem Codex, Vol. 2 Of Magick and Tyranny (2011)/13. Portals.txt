Engulfed in swirling light, the wind brings forth the warlockâs spite 
Holding ground, we must survive 
The dead move through the air, where time and outer began to tear 
Falling down, we must survive 
All the walls crumble, the sky now blurred in this gateway 
As we drown into nothing 

The armorâs growing cold 
Frostbite taking itâs hold 
Death would be welcome here 

Turning endlessly we separate 
we seperate 

Regret is a stain upon your honor 
honor is vacant here 

Visions are flashing 
forever sealed in memory 
in memory 
Left now are the journeys 
that had defined me 

The dark is growing blindly 
Float now and never be freed 
Close your eyes, and take hold 
Blue is your skin, diseased with cold 

Adventurer, speak now your decree 
Tales of lands far as the eye can see 
Question not, where is that we should meet 
For now all you have is forever bleak
