Go to sleep now little one
For the tale of Yagolith
Has now only just begun
The demons have arrived
To reave your your soul and
You must close your eyes
For now they come at night
And will end your life

Lay down your head down now child and close your small eyes
For the warriors of Dethlehem have arrived
(la la la hmhmmhmhmmhmmhmhmhmh)

Rest your eyes child
For the battle begins
