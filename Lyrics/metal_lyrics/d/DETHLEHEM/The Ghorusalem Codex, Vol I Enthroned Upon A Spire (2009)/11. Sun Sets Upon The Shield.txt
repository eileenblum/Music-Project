Dusk approaches
Of Finding ourselves out of breath and patience
Questions Arise again that we have but one purpose to ride till the end?

The sun sets upon the shield once again
a light that reflect upon every man
bodies that look familiar where we stand
An Echo Remains Of Footprints that crossed this land

Shadows that crawl across the dirt and rock, the creeping eyes that peer upon us
Decades on from now, shall we be remembered?

The sun sets upon the shield once again
a light that reflect upon every man
bodies that look familiar where we stand
An Echo Remains Of Footprints that crossed this land
