3 Walk among you, Lands Change, But Evil Remains
A Warriors Will, shall naught be lost, yearning for the next kill
Frost Upon My Blade, My Shield Gore-Stained, No Skin Unflayed

When The Shadow Rises, Under A Red Sky
What does Pride amount, viewed through Crimson eyes?
No Silver and No Gold, Only Battle and Blood-Stained Nights
There is no reward among Legends

A Quest such as this formed simple?
One against an army of swine
Walking Amongst The slain
Never viewing daylight

11 days until end, what drives this guild of cursed men?
Villages will burn, spirits always yearn, for a hero, but none shall find them
A place forgotten in time, crossing the sacred line, a land where no light shines

When The Shadow Rises, Under A Red Sky
What does Pride amount, viewed through Crimson eyes?
No Silver and No Gold, Only Battle and Blood-Stained Nights
There is no reward among Legends

3 must approach a stone, where a god cries in fear
Remains of former lords, forever shall lay here
For an eternity we ride, to wage a final stand
Destroy the unholy one, in the birthplace of Dethlehem

When The Shadow Rises, Under A Red Sky
What does Pride amount, viewed through Crimson eyes?
No Silver and No Gold, Only Battle and Blood-Stained Nights
There is no reward among Legends
