Covered in white, A Snow Witch's dream, The horses breathe at utmost difficulty
A drip of red that's falling down, leaving it's mark on these frozen grounds

We see it move, under hooded rags, the wretch it laughs, as lifeless bodies move and drag
She feasts upon the dead

MOTHERFUCKING BOWSTAFF

A scream that brings us to our knees, coming from this hag
We tried to approach, under quiet feet, but the smell of the dead made us then spit and gag
Her eyes gone white, standing over her ominous cave

IN THIS BLOOD FOREST 

It wastes no time toward our demise as it stares upon us helpless, yet it lets out a cry

no longer a watchful eye, as an axe doth slice it

The figure does shriek, but all too weak, as we yell and rise to our feet

BURN THIS BITCH

Quick on your feet, past burning meat, not let emotion slow our stride
From this now dead wood, raise your hoods, for the deadly branches we must brush aside
They shall see this from the mountaintops, it emits a bright orange glare

Let all that know of this place, let the flames burn

This forest is now a tomb

YEAH
