As the daylight approaches what seems a blur
Forms into horrid shapes, can all this really be happening?
Must i wake the others, is this is my mind?
They march towards us at a resounding pace

GIVE THEM NOTHING AND TAKE EVERYTHING

These eyes have not even seen, heroes that not fear to bleed
Mystics that predict the, start and end of times could not foresee (unsheath the sword)
Creatures that have no remorse, becoming a single force (and mount the horse)
A diseased horde approaching thee, legions of all that cease to be (settle the score)

DO NOT SHOW THEM FEAR IN YOUR EYES

500 years before us
there was an elite army
came upon a sacred treasured
an eerie glow on human eyes
greed hungry and instinct-striken
every man's flesh had melted
now they move, no quest, no soul
their will became but primal
satisfying the urge the kill
until one ends their torment

WE MUST REPEL THE ONSLAUGHT

These eyes have not even seen, heroes that not fear to bleed
Mystics that predict the, start and end of times could not foresee
creatures that have no remorse, becoming a single force

A diseased horde approaching thee, legions of all that cease to be
