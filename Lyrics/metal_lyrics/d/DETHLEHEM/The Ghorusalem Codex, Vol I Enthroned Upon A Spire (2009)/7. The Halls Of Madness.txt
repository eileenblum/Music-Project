Falling through to what must seem an abyss

Arising to his feet he saw a grand display
Halls made of marble white, home to a royal family
Yet it's underground, there is not a sound
There is no king, no queen, no one among these walls, they lost their fucking minds

Bovice do you remember me
I know what happened of your family
Have you not recognized this place?
Take a look around
your true birthplace you have found
Underneath this burial ground, which you are now bound

And through these halls, he walked among them
And the distain of bloodstain, reminded him of painful memories

Behold this hall of mirrors, for they hold your true form
Hold steadfast from them
And look upon your own lore
The truth you must discover
Has already formed

Cannot escape your past now
Echoes shall forever ring inside
Walk among them and reach the unstoppable insanity level 10
Look upon your images and finding your true self

These halls once shined of the youngest born, trained to fight for the good of mankind
Like the ones before him he must uphold the land by his bind
Yet at the gates figures approached and ordered the bloodline to be slain

And with his father's last breath, he said, I have foreseen this in a dream
You my son, must put a stop to this, unspeakable regime

He knows his truth, he knows his purpose
The tyrants fall to a family's curse

Crawling to the surface, he shall avenge his name
crying out into the night sky, wise one your head I shall claim

Reach into the sky, wise one your head I shall claim
