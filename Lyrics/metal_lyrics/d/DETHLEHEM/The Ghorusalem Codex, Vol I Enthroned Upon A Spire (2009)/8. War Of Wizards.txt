Skies Rain And Speak
Of magic long lost in the pages of time
Cadre Of Sorcery
handed down from supreme beings

And the wise stand underground in the caverns of cauldrons

Run among the old breed, for tonight in the fields of men we run among them
Yet take heed, for now we are part of the war of wizards

Secret Society
trained under watchful eyes of the sages
In the theater of gods, we are but dealt as chess pieces

Stand before the wizard council and place your stamp on the rites of war

Run among the old breed,  for tonight in the fields of men we run among them
Yet take heed, for now we are part of the war of wizards

Wands raised and laid slain upon this land cracked open
An entity in the sky watches over us

To be written forever in the annals of spellcraft 
A god amongst men through the pages
The Council awaits the results of the glorious
Between man and magic only one can remain
