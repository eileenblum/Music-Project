Hold your breath and we approach the gate
Place the corpse upon the stone
To show the true path through the void
Heads on spikes
Await Our Demise
Yet they not know, that we are the ruiners of dethlehem

In the town square, armies of the dead. are waiting there
Yet they not know, Ruiners Of Dethlehem they must fear

Bovice did reach down and fetch his blade, the broadsword now glowed in 
furious haste
He removed their limbs, in a gory blast, his bodyguards were no match
the 3 lay now before our feet, now we face our true enemy
face our enemy

The king does laugh
Descending from his throne and the crown doth glow
Standing upon his mound he approaches now

And he did turn into the dragon form, he grew to glorious heights, 
crushing the land from he born
Bovice faced him, his own eyes glowing out the demon inside
He did rise up from this underground, follow the blade into the town

Destroy Him Now

Destroyer of the land, we've come to claim your head

Plunge the blade into his watchful eye, and claim the glowing skull which 
holds its only power now

Claim The Skull

Skies return to their former wonder, dawn is all but rising now
Collect the skull, not as a trophy, but remember those that now lay dead
The journey home will all but be short, yet we now know that time not matters
For as one has fallen now before us, another shall rise to face our steel

This Journey Has Come To An End
