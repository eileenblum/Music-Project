Ship wrecked
In need of extended rest
Perception check

Cinders flood
Through the haze
Vision clouds
Perception fades

Upon the shore of ashes
A miasma shrouds all

(Lay on hands)

Open your mind's eye
Receive the aura of the guardian
Fortify resolve
Gain the blessing of the paladin

Hidden defender
Divine protector
Dispel this cursed fog
Spectral might
Phantasmal knight
Place your judgment in our steel

Unveiled the foreboding obelisk
A tombstone for this realm
Piercing the sky
Never-ending

Within the spire
A hive of terrors await
Abominations grasp at life
Thirsty for a taste
The scent of death grows stronger
Higher the steps we take
Ask not for whom the bell tolls
For it tells of our own fate

Sacrifice
Nobility's shine engulfs this place
Cleansing light
To keep darkness away
Afterlife
Ascending through your trinity
Black and white
Become gray
