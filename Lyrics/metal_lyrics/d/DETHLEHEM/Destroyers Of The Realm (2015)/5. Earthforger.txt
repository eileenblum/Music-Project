Born of clay
Deep in this swampy grave
Sacred ground defiled by treachery
Bear the curse
Red soaked land
Turns dust to marshes
Battles long lost
Leave their markings

Warpath of fortune never to obtain
Bound to the place
Where your bones still lay

Those who dare to cross this land
Never shall return again
Wandering this place an eternity for
Greed's ambition

Mine the vein
Treasured ore
Lay no claim

Conceived through steam and rust
Soulless globs
House blighted remains
Churning out my loyal minions
Tainted land cries out for vengeance

(Orichalcum)
Prepare the fire
(Orichalcum)
Resistance is weakened
(Orichalcum)
Cracking the dried shell
(Orichalcum)
Delivered from limbo's noose

Bring me their heads
Fuel the machine
Grinding meat
Slave to demand

Those who dare to cross this land
Never shall return again
Wandering this place an eternity for
Greed's ambition

Mine the vein
Treasured ore
Lay no claim
