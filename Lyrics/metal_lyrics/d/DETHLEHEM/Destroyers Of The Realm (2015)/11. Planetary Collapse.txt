Tearing flesh from the wound
A void that should invite death
As the blood pours black
Let the darkness consume

Disgraced your coat of arms

This deity sleeps no more
Deep in your marrow
Total loss of control
Eyes turn to crimson
Expressionless destruction

Engulfed insanity
The whims of a demon lords
Guide your hand
Horns of flame take form
Raise your sword

Become calamity the end of all things
Agent of doomsday claim your wings
Apocalyptic thrall
Host to oblivion
Set in motion cataclysm

This hilt of mine burns red
Its loud roar tells me to grasp victory
Eruption shining from within
Strike down

With these tidings
The almighty one bestows
Empowered with a cursed force
A baneful blade that glows
The planet begins to crack
Sliced in half
A smile upon the severed corpse
It echoes with a laugh

Prophecy fulfilled at last

Force fed the fire from an eon of hatred

Avert your eyes before the absolute
Cast down from above
The oldest ones dream
Reap not which ye create
A new age is born

The lineage is too strong
Defy the power of a god

Sigil of royalty
Condemns your being
Born of cruelty
Bow to your king

Obtain calamity the end of all things
Agent of doomsday I claim your wings

Galactic price is paid
A realm's end of days
Closes upon the stage
Follow the waves of time and space

A power cosmic
Lies dormant once again
Soul bound to the sword's command

I am the wielder of absolution

Behold
My kingdom of infinity

Behold
A gateway opens in the sky

Behold
