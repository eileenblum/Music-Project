Ascending what seems
An eternal stairwell
Where the sky meets the mountains
And the darkness does dwell
I put forth my torch
For the fire to catch
And before our eyes
An ancient latch
Open the tomb
Low tone heard by all
I reach for my strap
And comes forth the horde
This is the moment
I'll reclaim my...

I'll reclaim my sword

This feud ends tonight
Atop a landmark of sin
Clash
A declaration
Of blood and blade
This tower shall serve
As the place of your grave
Your legend shall be born
When your myth has been slain

Bestowed our path tonight
There are other worlds across this time
But I will see you on the other side
At the clearing

Break your limits in this final fight
Seeker of destruction
Guardian of night
Foretold destruction
Harbinger of war
The walls of this tower
Shall be painted in your gore

Bestowed our path tonight
There are other worlds across this time
But I will see you on the other side
At the clearing

Death is not for you
Something far worse

Destiny you cannot escape
Sever these threads of fate

Destiny you will try and change
Sever these threads of fate

Scorned
From these fires within
Journeys end
Quests begin
But this battle is not over

Pierced
Doom has forced its way in
Bathed in red
Eyes grow dim
Gaze into the abyss
And it shall gaze back
