"Set sail"
On the sea towards the beast that plagues the deep
"Captain"
Of the ship seeks revenge for the leg he keeps
"Brewing"
Is a storm from the mist that signals death

Beware

"Drink up"
For the burn in your gut may be the last
"Starboard"
Off the edge of the bow where great waves crash
"Serpent"
Casts a shade underneath that stretches wide

Beware
Leviathan draws near

[Dread Goblin Roberts]
"There ain't no room for fear on my ship!
First the battle and then the prize!"

Attack
Cannon fire tears through the sky
"Mortar and flame"
"Mortar and flame"
Iron basilisks let out their cry
"Mortar and flame"
"Mortar and flame"

Final voyage of the Gobblinaught

Spawned from the depths the seed of a devil rises

Behold the sea queen's gaze of one thousand eyes
Caught in its spell of the mind
Whirlpool of illusion the monster multiplies
This could be the end
Capsized

Riding these swirling blues
The waters thrash and shall consume
Lightning crashes in the distant black
Through the vortex we go
No turning back

Shrieking demon
Don't think you've won
Drive your steel deep
Take her with thee

Invader from within
Swallowed whole
(Ready arms)
Scales won't protect you now

This sea is your final resting place
