We move towards
The answer to our journey
The key to the tower lies within the garden maze
A relic to protect our group will guard us

The dwarven guides speak...

"In the heart of madness you will find!"
The artifact you seek
"Guardian shield!"
Awaits thee

Two converge as one
The path becomes undone
Shapes transform inside
The ancient shield it tries to hide

The walls whisper,
"Your death awaits...
Turn back from whence you came."
A way opens to reveal the past
A path of bones tells a truth that
None shall pass

"The protectors watching
For all time!"
To judge the ones who seek
"Guardian shield!"
Awaits thee

Two converge as one
The path becomes undone
Shapes transform inside
The treasured shield is in our sight

[Soothsayer]
"Inscription is written:
Lawful and pure may carry
The weight of divinity
And the voices of thine heart
Will speak without a word. Now..."

Awaken your doom

The statues crack and move
Overwhelming force
Unrelenting course
Test your might or perish
Buried in this labyrinth
Eternal champions
Immortalized in stone... the

Garden guardians
Guarding gardens

The golem's eyes shien with a wizard's spell
Destroying all in their way the optic flame immolates

Ablaze in a battlefield
Of burning leaves
Control the force of their fire the
Rays can melt armor

Reflect
Magic
Rebound
Advance

Bring them down by their own hand
Fight fire with fire
Crumbled rock reveals weakness
Chink in the armor
Grind them down
These monuments will collapse

Reflect
Magic
Rebound
Advance

Two disposed and slain
The legend we have gained
Fate is on our side
Guardian shield is ours tonight

It's fuckin' ours tonight
