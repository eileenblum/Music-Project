Sons of a fabled line 
Protectors of our time 
In these veins 
Flows the blood of the oath bound 

For rule they will divide 
In battle dreams collide 
Take your place on the throne of the oath bound 

Betrayer 
Only the chosen may go 
Blood begets blood 

To the Order went the youngest determined to prove his worth 
Arrives upon a blackened sky 
Destroying flesh condemning lives 

Those laid to rest begin to return 

The promise of power makes a fool of this lad 
Deceived by his lust bringing darkness to the land 

Betrayer 
The kingdom you'd overthrow 
Broken your oath 

In the shrine of a fallen god 
Evil is born 

Forsaken conqueror 
Denounce all 

You have forgotten the face of your father
