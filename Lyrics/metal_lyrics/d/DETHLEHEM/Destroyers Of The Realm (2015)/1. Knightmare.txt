Losing our brothers in the swirl
Of purple hues to ancient worlds
The wretched shade will walk again
Foretold by Dregmour's end

The darkness breeds wide
Will fester inside
Take heed

Doomed
By this twist of fate
Through the ethereal gate

Rise
Stand against our hand
Dealt to us in this foreign land

The warriors gaze upon the vastness ahead
Battle's song echoes in the distance of oblivion
A ghastly army wages war
Their chains will shackle them no more
From the grave, they've returned
For what purpose do they serve

Witness the blackened atrocity
Malevolent hatred stains this land

Dragons flame and embers bite
Reality has changed now
Quest for truth in our own right
The soul still burns
Trail of a fallen star
Mourning in wayward silence
Whispered tomes of darkened arts
Awaken from...

The shine of opposition sparks within the horde
A blazing sword through the infinite black

Lost in the fray
Stamina wavering
Onward
To the onslaught we go

Crash down with enchanted ferocity
Benevolence gives us the upper hand

Dragons flame and embers bite
Reality has changed now
Quest for truth in our own right
The soul still burns
Trail of a fallen star
Mourning in wayward silence
Whispered tomes of darkened arts
Awaken from this nightmare

Rest your eyes
This will all be over soon

I'm dreaming we'll wake up
Still dreaming I'll wake up
I'm dreaming
Must wake up
(This can't be real)

The afflicted drove dissipates on their own
Victory in death

The sacrifice has been made
Bodies lay offering

Cast your spell with blood

Captive in this cell
A prison of the dead
And I can't hold on

Grant me freedom
Take up our sword
Heroic weapon
Left by our Lord Bonecrush

[Knightmare speaking]
"Defeat is imminent. I shall become the vessel of destruction.
The king of kings...
Devourer of dreams!"

This power comes with a price
Bloodline genocide
Pay or forgeit life
Dark one rise

The rune speaks to me now as it fades from sight
It burns vengeance into my mind

Saying
"Bring forth their demise!"
