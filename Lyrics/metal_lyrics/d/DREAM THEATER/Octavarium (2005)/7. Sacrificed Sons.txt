[Music: Dream Theater, Lyrics: James LaBrie]

[Begins with samples from 9/11]

Walls are closing
Anxiously
Channel surfing
Frantically

Burning City
Smoke and fire
Planes we're certain
Faith inspired

No clues
A complete surprise
Who'll be
Coming home tonight

Heads all turning
Towards the sky
Towers crumble
Heroes die

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

Teach them what to think and feel
Your ways so enlightening
Words they preach I can't relate
If God's true Love are acts of Hate?

Who would wish this on our people
And proclaim that His will be done?
Scriptures they heed have misled them
All praise their sacrificed sons
All praise their sacrificed sons

God on High
Our mistakes
Will mankind be extinct?

There's no time,
Time to waste
Who serves the truth
For Heavens' sake?
