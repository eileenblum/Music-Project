[I. In The Flesh?]

[Originally recorded by Pink Floyd]
[Written by Roger Waters]
[From the album "The Wall" - 1979]

So 'ya
Thought 'ya
Might like to
Go to the show

To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow

Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind this cold eyes?
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

Lights...
Roll the sound effects...
Action...
Shout out! (shout out)
Shout out! (shout out)
Shout out! (shout out)

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here

[IV. Loving, Touching, Squeezing]

[Originally recorded by Journey]
[Written by Steve Perry]
[From the album "Evolution" - 1979]

You make me weep
And wanna die
Just when
You said we'd try
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other

When I'm alone
Oh by myself
You're out
With someone else
Lovin', touchin', squeezin'
Each other

You're tearin' me apart
Every day, every day
You're tearin' me apart
Oh what can I say?
You're tearin' me apart

It won't be long, no
Until you're alone
When you're lover
Oh he hasn't come home
'Cause he's lovin', oh he's touchin', he's squeezin'
Another

He's tearin' you apart
Every day, every day
He's tearin' you apart
Oh girl what can you say?
'Cause he's lovin', touchin', another
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry

Turn it on, turn it on again
