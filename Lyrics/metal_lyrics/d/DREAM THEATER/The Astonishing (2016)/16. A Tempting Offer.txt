[EXT. Ravenskill - Night]

[Daryus:]

Trustful boy
Unaware who's watching
Open the door
I am right behind you

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Night]

[Daryus:]

Don't resist me child
There's no use in fighting
We'll be here a while
Do you recognize me?

Look into my eyes
I'm the face of freedom
When daddy does arrive
He's in for a surprise

[Arhys:]

How dare you step inside my home!

[Daryus:]

His life is in my hands

[Arhys:]

You monster leave my son alone!

[Daryus:]

You do know who I am
Your love for him is strong

[Arhys:]

He's just a boy
He's done no wrong
This fight's not his to lose
I have everything you want

[Daryus:]

Your next decision
Will decide his fate
So listen to the words I have to say

Give up The Chosen One
And you will guarantee your son
Lives the life you never had

Wealth and prosperity
Beyond what you have ever seen
And best of all Xander will be free

He'll never want again
It's such an easy choice
Just think about your son

And I won't have to stand
In Faythe's dark shadow anymore
I am through with being pushed aside
Tired of fighting for my father's pride

Take the evening to decide
