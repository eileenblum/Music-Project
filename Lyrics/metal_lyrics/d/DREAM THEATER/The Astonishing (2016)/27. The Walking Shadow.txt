[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Xander:]
What have you done?
You murderer
My father's dead
Your day will come

[Daryus:]

Don't hold your breath
The night's still young
Confront your death
Like father, like son

Who's this I see?
Approaching me
The Chosen One?

[Narrator:]

Drawing closer pace by pace
The walking shadow hides its face
Never aware of the looming attack
Like stepping right into a trap

As his weapon
Finds its victim
Mortified,
He's shocked to find
The shadow is Faythe
