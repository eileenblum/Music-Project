[INT. Gabriel's Hideout - Day]

[Faythe:]

He only sees what he desires to see
It took a while but finally he agreed
Though everything may not turn out as planned
If love's a risk
It's worth the chance

[Gabriel:]

I know where there is faith there's always hope
We'll meet beneath the stars at Heaven's Cove
Where ghosts of yesterday
Once filled the lighted stage
Taking our first step down a new road

[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Daryus:]

Arhys time is running out
What will your decision be?
If you still have any doubt
Think about Evangeline

[INT. Home of Arhys and X - Day]

[Arhys:]

On the road to revolution
Our salvation's never free
There's a price for liberation when you stand for your beliefs

When the man in the mirror
Takes a long hard look at me
Will the person staring back, be the man I want to be?

[INT. Emperor's Palace - Day]

[Nafaryus:]

Change my mind?
A waste of time
For soon he will be mine

[Ensemble:]

Open eyes
Help me see which choice is right
