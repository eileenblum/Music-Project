[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Gabriel:]

Like your father once said
Life is not what you're given
It is how you decide to live
On the path you have chosen

So together we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

[Faythe:]

I know you're scared and alone
But we will face this together
Through the innocence in your eyes
They will live on forever

In their memory we'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

[Gabriel, Faythe and X:]

We'll build a new world
A better world
We'll build a new world
Our new world

Together we'll build a new world
A wondrous world
We'll build a new world
A bold new world
