[EXT. Ravenskill Town Square - Day]

[Nafaryus:]

The admiration
The applause and the cheers
I am impressed
You've brought us all to tears

To think I didn't notice
The way you looked at her
Now step down from your throne
And let me bring you back to earth

Need I remind you?
I am the ruler here
Don't overlook that fact

Swearing allegiance
To anyone but me
No, I won't put up with that

Hide and protect him
Send him away
I'll never play this game

Stand by your savior
One thing remains
I'll find him just the same

[Imperial Guards:]

Brace yourself
Bow down to Nafaryus

Pray for help
Kneel before Nafaryus

[Nafaryus:]

He'll surrender on his own
If not, there'll be hell to pay
I'll tear down this city stone by stone
You only have three days

Send home the rebels
Call off the fight
In no uncertain terms

Should you refuse me
Fear for your lives
Ravenskill shall burn

[Imperial Guards:]

Brace yourself
Bow down to Nafaryus

Pray for help
Kneel before Nafaryus

[Narrator:]

With this frightening decree
Nafaryus departs
They're left to weigh the gravity
Of his threatening remarks

Judgement day will soon arrive
In only three days time
Will Gabriel get out of this alive?
This remains the question on their minds
