[EXT. Ravenskill - Day]

[Narrator:]

Morning breaks beyond the night
And she's a world away
Through crowded streets
This quiet hooded stranger makes her way

[Faythe:]

Please, excuse me
Sir can you help me?
Where can I find this man?

[Townsperson:]

Sorry, can't speak
Someone is waiting

[Faythe:]

Yes, I understand

[Narrator:]

As her will
Starts to fade
And all but disappears

Like a ghost
Suddenly a boy is standing there
And all is clear

[Faythe:]

I'm your friend
Trust me don't be scared
I am looking for your father and I promise
I can help
Now take my hand
We haven't time to spare

[Narrator:]

Hopeful and innocent
Sensing no danger
He sees humanity
Behind the stranger's eyes

Her true identity
Will be revealed when she sheds her disguise

[EXT. Rebel Training Camp - Day]

[Faythe:]

My intentions are faithful
There's a chance we can still end this game
I'd be forever grateful
To see him once again

[Arhys:]

You dare to stand
Before my eyes
You're one of them
Why would I trust you?

[Faythe:]

It's not like that
I can't go back
Hope fades away
With each passing second

Lost in this moment
Is where I want to stay
This can't be broken
We need to find a way
Gabriel

I would wait a lifetime
Just to see your face
But all we have is one more day

[Gabriel:]

I remember your father was moved by my song
I know when he sees we're united that he'll understand
We will walk this road together
We will face this hand in hand

With music and love on our side we can't lose this fight
Tomorrow our dream comes alive
