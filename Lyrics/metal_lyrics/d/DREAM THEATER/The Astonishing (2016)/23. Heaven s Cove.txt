[EXT. Heaven's Cove Amphitheater - Night]

[Narrator:]

Under the glow of the midnight moon
Where the stars touch the sky
Stand the long forgotten remains of a time gone by

Heaven's Cove was a wondrous site
Once a beautiful place
Now an empty shell like a memory that time erased

As the pivotal moment draws closer
Every shadow and whisper ignite
Music will rise like a phoenix from the ashes on this night
