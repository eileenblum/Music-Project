[EXT. Heaven's Cove Ampitheater - Night]

[Narrator:]

The evening stars shine brightly
Over heaven's cove
As night descends in silence
The fated scene unfolds
Consumed with trepidation
Arhys hears his brother's voice

[Gabriel's Voice:]

As you're facing the path that divides
I will always be here by your side

[Arhys:]
I feel my pulse begin to race
Beads of sweat drip down my face
I have made a grave mistake
What have I done?
My blood for my son?

It's not too late
I won't betray him

[Daryus:]

I knew the day had come
And you could be tempted
To give up The Chosen One
And finally end this
Do anything for your son
A terminal weakness
But now you're as good as done

[Arhys:]
I didn't have a choice
And I was defenseless
I didn't believe his voice
And fighting was senseless
But now I can see the truth
I've come to my senses
I shouldn't have trusted you

[Narrator:]

Arhys was never aware
His son had followed him there
Confused and deathly afraid
X watched his hero be brave

[Arhys:]

On the path that divides
You were there by my side
There will be no betrayal tonight

I found courage and strength
In the words you once sang
Tore the truth from the lies
On the path that divides

[Daryus:]

You dare defy your prince?
Well you just threw your life away
Along with Xander's dreams
You chose the wrong man to betray

[Narrator:]

Two hungry warriors
Clash in the shadows of the night
But there's a cost with every fight
And Arhys' fight for hope
Cost him his very life
