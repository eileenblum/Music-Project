[Music: Dream Theater / Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[III. Heretic]

Welcome tired pilgrim
Into the circle
We have been waiting

Everyone's gathered
for your arrival
All the believers

Angels fall
all for you
heretic
Demon heart
bleed for us

I've been waiting for you,
Weary preacher man
You have been expected
Now we can begin
Let this hallowed Day of Judgment reign

I have known you father
And your sacred quest
Blessed soldier fighting
You shall never rest
I have known you but do you know me?

Angels fall
all for you
heretic
Demon heart
bleed for us

(My soul is yours Dark Master, I will fight for you)

Dark Master within, I will fight for you
Dark Master of sin, now my soul is yours
Dark Master, my guide, I will die for you
Dark Master insideï¿½

I cannot see his face
But I could feel his spite
A presence from the dead
Abandoned by the light
This shadow will consume him
from within

This power that I sense
The rage behind those eyes
Is just a shrouded ghost
A spirit sealed inside
The body and the soul both threats
For they are one

Angels fall
all for you
heretic
Demon heart
bleed for us

(My soul is yours Dark Master, I will fight for you)

Dark Master within, I will fight for you
Dark Master of sin, now my soul is yours
Dark Master, my guide, I will die for you
Dark Master insideï¿½
Dark Master, amen, I belong to you
Dark Master withinï¿½

Heil! Heil! Heil! Heil!
Heil! Heil! Heil! Heil!

[IV. The Slaughter of The Damned]

Don't
Bother trying to find them
They will be coming to you
Fight,
Fight and destroy until you can't take anymore

Slay
Spill the blood of the rebels
They are the children of hell
Flesh,
Of the undead
Stopping at nothing to kill

Sin,
Caught in a moment of weakness
Committed the greatest of all
Sold,
Half of my soul
And now it's too late for you

I judge us
my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us

Unwelcome ones
your time has come

Lord,
You are my god and my shepherd
Nothing more shall I want
Walk,
Through the abyss
Into the shadow of death

Fear,
There is no evil to fear now
For I know you are with me
My,
Cup overflows
With my enemy's blood

I,
Decay in the house of the lord
Forever, amen
Death,
Will follow me
All the days of my life

I judge us
my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us
Unwelcome ones
your time has come

Servants of the fallen
Fight to pave the way
For their savior's calling
On this wicked day

Through a veil of madness
With a vicious play
One man rises up
Standing in their way

It's time for your reckoning

[V. The Reckoning ]

[Instrumental]

[VI. Salvation]

My soul grows weaker
He knows and he waits
He watches over me
Standing at the infernal gates
In the hour of darkness
The moment I feared has passed
The moment I lost my faith
Promising salvation
My soul is my own now
I do not fight for you
Dark Master
