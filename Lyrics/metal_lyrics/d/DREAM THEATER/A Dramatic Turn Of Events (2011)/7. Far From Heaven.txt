[Music by John Petrucci, Jordan Rudess and James LaBrie, Lyrics by James LaBrie]

No one truly has the answers
Every day I struggle through it once more
Keep things bottled up
Never speaking my mind
Misinterpreted I'm doing just fine

Every day I put a brave face on
Serves me well
Feeling helpless facing it alone
Hard to tell
That I can't change who I am
How I feel there's no end

I have done
What you asked of me
Leaves me nothing to live for

Coming undone
Way too high a price
I should pay
You keep your pride
While I die inside
Every day
No I
Can't lie anymore
Won't pretend
I've done
All I can

You can't imagine
The hell I'm going through
Not asking you to save me
I'm too far from heaven

Nothing you can do to change me
But accept me as I am
