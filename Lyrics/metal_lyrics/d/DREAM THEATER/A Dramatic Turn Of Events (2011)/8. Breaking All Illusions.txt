[Music by John Petrucci, Jordan Rudess and John Myung, Lyrics by John Myung and John Petrucci]

With the sun in place
There's a test of faith
Streams of thought awaken

New realities
Singularities
Breaking all illusions

[Spoken words:]
âYour living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens.â
âOut of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.â

Sudden bust of heat
Burning source of life
Masterful destruction

Power's not an act
It's understanding truth
Changing my direction

Live in the moment
Breathe in a new beginning
Wisdom revealed
As I unlearn to learn

Life's biggest battles
Often are fought alone
My spirit brings me home

Emerald thoughts flow through my consciousness
Drawn to curses left behind
Test of will the threshold to one's faith
Starts a fire in the mind

Searching out
Reaching in
To arrive
Where I began
Sights remembered
In the light

Searching out
Reaching in
To arrive
Where I began
Sights remembered
Come alive

Embrace the days
Don't turn away
Life's true intent needs patience
Karma starts the signal
