Written on the water
Memories dissipate
Eyes begin to open
Darkness drifts away

Time and space like roses
Whose petals drop and fade
And fall into the light
As if dreams of yesterday

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see

There is nothing sacred
Only heaven knows
So turn towards the sun
And look into your soul

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see
Too much hope will never be enough
It's become so clear to me

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see
Too much hope will never be enough
The truth is clear to me
