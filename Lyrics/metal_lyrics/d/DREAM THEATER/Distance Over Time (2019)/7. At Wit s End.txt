Let me help you
How much longer until you realize?
You're getting worse
It's killing you inside
I can't break through
Feel you have to face this on your own
Want to be left alone

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Come alive

You feel I'm asking too much of you
But can't let go
Fear breeds the hate and your apathy
Empty and hollow
You lost your faith
There's no getting through
Why shut me out?
Frantic, disturbed, filled with misery
Can't figure it out

Sleepless, worse for wear
Staring at the ceiling
Numb
Sedated
Intoxicated

Deafening, deafening
Shut it out, shut it out
Burning, burning
No way out, no way out

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Come alive

Asked me to listen
Can't go on and face another day
I lied, not admitting
What I lost is still in you
Something's missing
You see darkness in my eyes
Maculate

There is no cure
Playing over, stop pretending
Warped inside its never-ending tide

Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me now
