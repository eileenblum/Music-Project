Someone
Someone is trying
To tell him something
Will he listen?
Should he listen?

Someone
Someone is dying
To find out something
Will he reason?
What is the reason?

Do you see it, there on the door?
Death is coming
Life nevermore
Obsession drives me
Clouding my mind
What's the message?
Am I running out of time?

Someone
Someone is trying
In search of something
Death by numbers
Getting closer

Someone
Someone is dying
To know the answer
The key to heaven

Do you see it there on the door?
Death is coming
Life nevermore
Obsession drives me
Clouding my mind
What's the message?
Am I running out of time?

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line
Hidden by design

I can see it here on the door
One-three-seven forevermore
Between dimensions
The boundary line
One-three-seven
I am running out of time

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line

Take me to the other side
Show me what I cannot find
Never-ending number line
Let me see before I die
