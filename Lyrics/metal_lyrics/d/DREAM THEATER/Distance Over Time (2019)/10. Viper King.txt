Venomous
By design
Lying idle
Biding time

Bore down the clutch
Tore up the road
Six hundred horses
Genetic code

Lightning speed
The road she bends
Slam down the brakes
Losing my ass end

Drive on
Pushed to the limit
My viper king
We're flying high

Drive on
Filled with desire
Nothing to fear
I feel alive

My viper king

Speed demon
Tempting fate
Do or die
In the blink of an eye

Drive on
Pushed to the limit
My viper king
We're flying high

Drive on
Filled with desire
Nothing to fear
I feel alive

My viper king

Drive on
Pushed to the limit
My viper king
We're flying high

Drive on
Filled with desire
Nothing to fear
I feel alive

My viper king
My viper king
My viper king
