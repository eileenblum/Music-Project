Are we paying attention?
Or are we drifting?
Too much negative action
Not enough positive reaction

What's the state of humanity?
Where's the peace and the harmony?
Free the signal, your inner voice
Time to transcend block out the noise

Signal to noise
Becomes the answer
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel

Have you heard the news?
A surging sea of circumstance
Pain, starvation, war, abuse
Sterile gloves hide dirty hands

Shocking truth
Climate change
Floods and fires
Hurricanes
Overdose
Suicide
Innocent die
Fear and race
Endless lies
Sex and faith
Terrorize
Drugs and guns
Taking lives
Innocent die

Signal to noise
Becomes the answer
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel
Signal to noise
Defines the reason
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel
Our wounds begin to heal

Signal to noise
Becomes the answer
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel

Signal to noise
Defines the reason
The world keeps turning
As we latch on to the wheel

Our wounds begin to heal
The chatter disappears
And the message is revealed
