You've built this world around you
Your universe
In spite of best intentions
Things could not be worse
Chaos and fear have left you
Hanging by a thread
As you argue with the voice inside your head

Untethered angel
Falling to darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself will set you free

Misgiving and dismay
Nightmares and wasted days
Can't live your life this way
Something needs to change
Cold feet and second thoughts
Entangled, tied in knots
Avoidance at all costs
A painful thing to watch

Fear can live inside you
Push you to the edge
Face the fear within you
Wake up from the dead

Untethered angel
Falling to darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself will set you free
Set you free

Untethered angel
Falling to darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Open your heart
Be set free
