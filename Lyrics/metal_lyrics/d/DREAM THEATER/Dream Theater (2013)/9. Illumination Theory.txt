[I. Paradoxe de la LumiÃ¨re Noire]

[Instrumental]

[II. Live, Die, Kill]

Consider this questionÂ 
Look deep insideÂ 
Deliver a true confessionÂ 
What are you willing to live for?Â 

Consider this question
Open your eyesÂ 
Examine your own reflectionÂ 
What are you willing to die for?Â 

When your backsâ against the wallÂ 
And the time's uncertain
Consider this question
No standing by
When flesh and blood are threatenedÂ 
What are you willing to kill for?Â 

We seek to understand
We cry with head in handÂ 

The bridges we build to connectÂ 
The distance that makes us forget
Hate dividing us, love reminding us
Of our shared humanityÂ 

Hope can be a shadow fleeting
I would rather die believingÂ 
Capture it all in a final act of faithÂ 

We seek to understandÂ 
We cry with head in handÂ 

A story that needs to be told
An answer that begs to be found
The beauty we wish to behold
Is never too far awayÂ 

[III. The Embracing Circle]

[Instrumental]

[IV. The Pursuit Of Truth]

Mothers for their children
Husbands for their wives
Martyrs for the kingdom
Fighting for your life
A soldier for his country
A junkie for the high
Teachers for their studentsÂ 
Vengeance for a crime
Rebels for their freedom
A tyrant for the praise
Cowards for salvation
Money, love, and fame

Noble and brave
Lay down our lives for the cause
Death over shame
Grace before gloryÂ 

[V. Surrender, Trust &amp; Passion]

To really feel the joy in life
You must suffer through the pain
When you surrender to the lightÂ 
You can face the darkest days

If you open up your eyes
And you put your trust in love
On those cold and endless nightsÂ 
You will never be alone

Passion glows within your heart
Like a furnace burning brightÂ 
Until you struggle through the dark
Youâll never know that you're alive
