Long before the colors start to bleed
I can see the painting come alive
Clever like an angel in disguiseÂ 
Moving in and out of reachÂ 

If the candle lights this crooked path
Like a lighthouse peering through the haze
I will find the river through the rainÂ 
And Iâll reach the waterâs edgeÂ 

Shed your light on me
Be my eyes when I canât seeÂ 
Shed your light on meÂ 
Be my guide so I can see
The Bigger PictureÂ 

Like a moth burned by the fireÂ 
and driven to the flameÂ 
(Propheciesâ a blessing and a curse)Â 
I must bare this cross alone
Thereâs no one else to blameÂ 
With each treasure found
Another shipwreckâs washed ashore
I am carried by the current
On a slow and steady courseÂ 

[CHORUS]Â 

What If caught in a momentÂ 
I get lost and can't find my way
What if all along i was wrongÂ 
In every turn, In every wayÂ 

Would you talk me off the ledgeÂ 
Or let me take the fallÂ 
Better to try and failÂ 
then to never try at allÂ 

You look but cannot see
Talk but never speak
You live but cannot breathe
See but donât believeÂ 

Wounds that never heal
A heart that cannot feel
A dream thatâs all too realÂ 
A stare as cold as steel

Iâve listened to the stories of resentment and disdain
Iâve looked into the empty eyes of anger, fear, and shame
Iâve taken blood from every stoneÂ 
And traveled every roadÂ 

When I see the distant lights illuminate the night
Then I will know I am homeÂ
