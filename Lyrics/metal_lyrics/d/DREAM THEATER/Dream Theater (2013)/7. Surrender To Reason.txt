In moments of painÂ 
Where heart and mind collide
Self reflection helps me decide
I believe the sacrifices in life
Give more than they takeÂ 

Visions flowing slowly shedding light
Memories swimming in the sea of time
Pieces to the puzzle falling into place
That with which we struggle through weâve learned to embraceÂ 

Love show the way, alter my state of mind
Wash away the sorrowÂ 
Grace lead the way
When boundaries are found
Surrender to reason

Life gives you brighter daysÂ 
Through sacrifices made
My spirit travels like the wind and waves
My heart and mind unite
Mistakes resolved give sightÂ 
The riverâs currents slowly turns the stoneÂ 

Restless angels
Help me find my way
Restless angelsÂ 
Help me find my strengthÂ 

Restless angelsÂ 
Help me find my way
Restless angelsÂ 
Let love show the way
Let grace be the wayÂ 
Surrender to reason
