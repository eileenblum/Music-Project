To really feel the joy in life, you must suffer through the pain
When you surrender to the light, you can face the darkest days
If you open up your eyes and you put your trust in love
On those cold and endless nights, you will never be alone
Passion glows within your heart like a furnace burning bright
Until you struggle through the dark, youâll never know that youâre alive

Never know - know that youâre alive!
Youâll never know! [4x]
