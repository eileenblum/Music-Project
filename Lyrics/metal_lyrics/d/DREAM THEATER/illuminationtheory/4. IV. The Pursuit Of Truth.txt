Mothers for their children
Husbands for their wives
Martyrs for the kingdom
Fighting for your life
A soldier for his country
A junkie for the high
Teachers for their students
Vengeance for a crime
Rebels for their freedom
A tyrant for the prize
Cowards for salvation
Money, love, and faith

Noble embrace
Lay down our lives for the cause
Death over shame
Grace before glory
