I looked across the waters, ash blood blacked
Roots poisoned and rotted, our earth lay fallow
Eyes hollow and burning, mind broken, breath shallow
Oceans of sorrow, regrets spill over and over again
Regrets spill over and over again
Slow collapse, building mounds like tombs
Countless gray soldiers, tumbling from the scaffolds
Their blood soaked eyes, like stained glass

Searing effigies of our hope, stand mocking our pain
And I see you screaming, I see you, but I can't hear a thing
Searing effigies of our hope mock our suffering

My pain is a stone, growing slow, like a cancer
Bound in chains, of rage, red hot with fear
We harvest our sins, fangs out but broken

Our chapter is ending, unresolved, slamming shut
Crying molten tears, we design our graves
Bone and sinew stretch, and crack as we fall
Whispers crackle with lies, we envy the dead
No fear ward can save us, or the slaves we created
And I bury my siblings with the ashes of my children
Our temples alive seeking blood for their altars

Rage is our god, wrath our mother, fire our father

And I see you screaming, I see you, but I can't hear a thing
My pain is a stone, growing slow, like a cancer
Rage is our god

No fear ward can save us, or the slaves we created
