And you fall, fall into a tower of shadows
We pray to wolves as our flock flee the fires

Our forced calloused hands, whip broken backs
It hurts me to find you, kneeling before the veil

You fall into nothing, still just falling away, falling away

Your gods, they're not watching, t heir fables, they're all dead
Yet we still keep building with blood on our hands

Stones stacked like tombs, monuments like withered eyes
Pillars of smoke, columns of fire

I stood there watching, lambs led to the slaughter
