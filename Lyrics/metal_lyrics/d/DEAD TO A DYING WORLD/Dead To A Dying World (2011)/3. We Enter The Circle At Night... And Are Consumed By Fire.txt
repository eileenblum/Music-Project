Wander the plains, absent minded, burning to believe, nothing there
Sky is seeping its blood onto me, cover my skull, head forward
Nervous twitch keeping me alive, making me run

Agony the antidote of reason, shed my skin, tear my rotting carcass
Flowers in fields replaced with metal scraps, walk upon them in remembrance
Of how they once felt on the freshly sliced flesh,
Force the shards into your eyes

Scolding unconscious, behold wrath

Bones turning stone, turning clay, the chapter ends
Twist in the winds, ripping the seams, scatter

No flag left standing, no temple host to guide the lost
Shallow graves break the land, where seeds find purchase
Feeding on each other, all souls broke and empty
Reclaimed the cycle, the land cries out

Wander the plains, absent minded, burning to believe, nothing there
Sky is seeping its blood onto me, cover my skull, head forward
Nervous twitch keeping me alive

See the world for all the lack of glory.
See the beauty in the emptiness, rotting catacombs, ripe stench-filled walkways

This is the scope of our ruin and the culling of harvest
Bone riddled sewage clawing your knees, dragging and pulling
Deeper you fall under, your lungs fill with ashes

Sinking one by one, cold and alone, red ash turned to stone
Grey skies hold heavy the cries

This is the scope of our ruin and the culling of our harvest
Bone riddled sewage clawing your knees, dragging and pulling
Deeper you fall under, your lungs fill with ashes

A smoldering cancer devouring the earth beyond sight
Dark coal speck embedded in your soul shatters to branches
Black spine branches crackle out like teeth with no mouth
Light doused by smoke spewing wings dripping with venom
Behold the deluge, angry shatters the lang underfoot
