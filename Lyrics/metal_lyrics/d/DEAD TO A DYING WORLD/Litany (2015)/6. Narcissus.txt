Bewitched by the eye of the storm
Offerings of wheat and flesh performed

Blind turned eye, to the ruins
Walls will rise to consume you

Carved stones as law
Are the bars of your cell
The fear burns in deep
Like the hole in your heart

Wrath as man, soulless demon
Grey of death, marching desert

Steeds of despair
Craving flesh of their lords
Three ravens stare
As the hound flees in fear

Is this our fate
Rise to decay
How can we break
This wheel of pain

Stars made flesh with hearts of fire
Mind of light and feet of iron
The body shackled to desire
Leads the shepherd to the alter

The noose is tied, unto the oak
The blade is sharp, against my throat
And though I fall, into black seas
Iâm blinded by, what canât be seen
No king or priest, no gods of men
Will change this fate, our prophecy

Nemesis, your fate, lured to abandon
Unable to break the gaze that enslaves you

Rise or die, burn the alter
End the reign of mortal bondage

Though the path is clear
And our feet know the way
Do we choose to follow
Or can we break away

The noose is tied, unto the oak
The blade is sharp, against my throat
And though I fall, into black seas
Iâm blinded by, what canât be seen
No king or priest, no gods of men
Will change this fate, our prophecy
