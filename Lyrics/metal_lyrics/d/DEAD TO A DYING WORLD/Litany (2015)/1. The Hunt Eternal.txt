In skin of ash and stone
Gaunt shade compelled to roam
Ice heart forms a cage
Black fangs a yearning blade
Mind bent a starving slave
None mourn the marching grave
In dreams we hide in light
Black eyes will eat the night

And the world grew cold
Pitted guts relentless call
As one of us fell a stark prayer answered
The flesh stuck in our throats
Swallow and thrive, swallow and writhe within

Torn skin consumed by plague
Famine does not assuage
Resigned unto this fate
Monochrome crushing wave
Wince in pain broken sight
Bound to us by bridled right

As days turned we abandoned our gods
Our mouths rotten with the flavor or our own
Gnashed and bled only a searing blade
May halt our grim endeavor

Let these fires rend my heart
Till arrows fear to nest
Pray no blade should cut my flesh
And to the ground come to rest

To thrive on spoils
The hunt eternal
Two serpents coil
The pain immortal

Crumbled road, rendered fat
Bearing teeth, soulless gaze
Hallowed flesh, hunger pangs
Craven thirst, forsaken

Drift and scatter
Slow cold surrender
Race to the pyre
Shade of slaughter

A coffin of hunger
A body to suffer
Devour forever
A starving vessel
A bloodless pillar
Consuming forever
