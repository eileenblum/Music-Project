Bending the mountains down
Flowing fire
Sky crawling monolith
Souls will rise
Carving earth
Roots expand
Casting fate
Moons advance
No longer free to drift
Throne a pyre
Calling back
Shields alive
Walls will rise
Ochre hands
Shrine a pyre

We fear the trees, the dark within
Our shadows flat black, tethers in the sun
Ghosts of our past, spirits race the winds
Breaking stone we bow to plow and the hearth

Brothers and sisters, are scattered to the pillars
Each set to wander ash sick and sundered
The trine ever flowing, inward and swelling
One hunt, one sowing, the last overflowing

Brittle embers flicker inside
Where blasting suns once raged
Starving bitter hands dig cold
Warmth just beyond reach

The moons mark our harvest, no longer, the hunt
Dig, for we hunger, now stone, over feather
A husk, staring back
Still feral, unbridled, yet slaves, through dominion

Though tried by blood and ruled by fire
Three circles, three sigils
Each to their own, dead to empire

We fear the trees, the past lies within
Our shadows flat black, tethered by sun
Breaking stone we bow to plow and the hearth
