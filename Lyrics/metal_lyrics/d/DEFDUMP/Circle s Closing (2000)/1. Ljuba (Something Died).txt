Threatening their homes
Threatening their lives
Threatening my roots
Are you ready to die?
Stop the killing we don't need no peace plan developed
To support the death - industry
STOP THE KILLING!
Threatening my home
Threatening my roots
Are you ready to burn them alive?
All is just a part of this mass - manipulation of their medias,
Controlled information to acquire votes of the financing nations,
"War - incorporate" STOP THE KILLING, tell it like it is! Once!

Sentenced by the truth we'll die!

Tell it like it is we'll fall we'll fall
Sentenced by the truth we'll fall we'll fall!

We don't need no so called peace plan forged by death - industry
Stop the killing - THEY CAN'T WAR IS SELLING
For the victims of communication, propaganda - war
STOP THE KILLING, tell it like it is! Once!
