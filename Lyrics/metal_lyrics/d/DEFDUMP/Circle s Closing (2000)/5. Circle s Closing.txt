Circle's closing,
Seasons repeating each time again and again,
With changing actors in changing scenes,
Someone taking his first breath, someone's at his last,
This circle's turning fast.
Take your time to self-reflect, get conscious that
Life might be unpredictable, but you can influence it!
What you give is what you get back is what you gave.
The world is in our hands, in our hands and in our heads!
All is just based on logical equations,
we're all just programmed like computers
- Why? why? why?
Why though I object am I forced to bow down,
To satisfy the needs of other men?
That's not what this life is for,
- live your own dream to find out what you are here for!
Outshine through self - fulfillment and grow!
Self - educate and let your soul grow,
Don't waste it! Waste it!
Why don't we let ourselves grow to one with all?
Why are we so bored, why are we so wasted?
What we see is just a part of it and it's wasted, so wasted.
What we see is just a part of a part of what's wasted, so wasted.
What we see is just a part of it all that is bad
And all that is good has come together
CIRCLE'S CLOSING!!
Resist or conform, we're forced to bow down,
To satisfy the needs of other men
Why don't we let ourselves grow, why are we so bored?
Why is there someone who laughs, everytime someone is crying?
Why don't we let ourselves grow,
Grow to one with all before the circle's closing in again?
