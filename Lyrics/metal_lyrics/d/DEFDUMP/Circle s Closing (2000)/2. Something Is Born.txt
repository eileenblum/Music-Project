I'm glad to be here,
In these times of change,
A new era for the human race.

We all live the same lives
We all walk the same path
Here today - tomorrow fade away
We're all born under one sun that's making life grow
By nature we're owned
We're blood and we're soul
We're out of control!
We're used to be still standing,
TV watching, buying and consuming
But there's one world breathing and one's bleeding
One man's wasting food while millions of hungry beings die!
Something is coming, a new day, we'll rise up today
Something changed
Something is coming a new day will rise up today
Something is born, something that's strong, something new
Something is coming a new day, we'll rise up today! Go!
We all breathe the same air!
I'm glad to be here
In these times of change,
A new era for the human race!
We all live the same lives,
We all walk the same path
Here today - tomorrow fade away
We all live under one sun that's making life grow!
