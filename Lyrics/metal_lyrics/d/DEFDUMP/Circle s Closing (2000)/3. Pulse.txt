I feel the pulse in me, I see the sun
I've suffered so many times just for you.
It smells repulsively, drying in the sun,
Half - dead bodies that wait to be slaughtered just for you.
I see the sun, I feel a pulse, a heartbeat
I see the sun, I see you can't look at me.
All comes back to you,
Look in my eyes, now look at me
All is meant to be, to breathe, to live,
All is meant to:
To live, to breathe, to see, to feel
To bleed, to scream,
To suffer a life - long, waiting
And suffer on til we die.
I can't hold the tears in my eyes,
Everytime I think about life and what we have done
But I can't cry,
I look around, I'm lost
I look at the skies and what's to come
So lost in this daydream remains undone
- I'd live a life free from all pain
we're all alive - just look at me, we're all the same
I'd live a life free from all pain
We're all alive we're all the same
We all will die, we're all the same
I close my eyes to feel the rain
Release my soul, wash the pain away.
We all will die we're all the same.
Just like you I have got a skin and I have got veins,
I have got a heartbeat, yes a pulse
I have got eyes and I have got ears, I have got a
conscience
And mine is clear
I lived my life was full of shame
We're all alive we're all the same
We all will die we're all the same
Look at me, look at me, Speak to me, talk to me!
Let it rain, let it rain, wash the pain away!
