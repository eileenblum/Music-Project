We've tried to redefine North and I guess that we have
Succeeded in creating a feeling that resembles our
Great expectations
Here we go facing the winds, still we will walk facing
The storms, here we come for the wide open spaces, for
Each day a new home
And whatever will come, like we won't leave this place
Without leaving a trace. Here we go down the only road
We've ever known
But what when you already know it always ends into one
Way streets and into dead end roads?
I will guide you while you're on your way, I will be
There when you'll need me most - Do you know your name
Do you know where to go right now, do you know your
Name, do you know where to sleep tonight - Tonight we
May count out the stars
We may laugh at our past tonight, if you pull up your
Sails and you let yourself go, I can take you to places
Yet unknown
I will guide you while you're on your way, I will be
There when you'll need me most, I'll still be around
When no one else will
I will shine on til the end of the storm - I could be
Your Makeshift Polaris
