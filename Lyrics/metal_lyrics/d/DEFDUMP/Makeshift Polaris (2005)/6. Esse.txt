Yes I know it hurts to live a lie, it hurts to wake up
And to see that you're not where you want to be and to
See that you're lost
To see that you've lost your way and to admit it to yourself.
I guess indifference becomes a vital function - living
9 to 5 routines of service selling companies yet other
Forms of modern slaveries
Silence is, well silence is the new loud, stupid is,
Stupid is the new smart or look away and it will make things less hard
Turn it into passion and the essence will flow, that's
What she said: Turn it into passion, let the essence
Flow - the prostitution of the soul
As the privilege of the capital is we can afford to
Look away The privilege of democracies. we're made
Believe we have our say
