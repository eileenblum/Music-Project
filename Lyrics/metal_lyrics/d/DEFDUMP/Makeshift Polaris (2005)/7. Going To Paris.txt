I'm glad you know cause words are not allowed to speak
Of the difference inbetween - So we don't speak
It's hard to see when skies are blue that all blue
Turns grey and we don't even care - it's all about
Getting through
We all hope for a better day, we all hope for a place
To stay and maybe to find someone that feels the same way we do
We'll drive down to the Atlantic, passing countryside
In the mid of summer, endless miles through dusty
Highways and untouched valleys
On the side of the road stands that perfect stranger
Wearing a sign saying: I am going to Paris - Are you going my way?
We all hope for a better day in a different place
Another way, we all hope for a place to stay
And maybe to find someone else that feels the same way
We do................ I'm on my way............... I'm on
My way......... I'm on my way
