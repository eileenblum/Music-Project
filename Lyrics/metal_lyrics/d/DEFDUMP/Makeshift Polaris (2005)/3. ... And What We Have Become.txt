We fail, day by day, we lose faith, we turn cold,
Through all the things that we have been through all
The things that we have seen
What we have become and what we've hoped we'd never be.
Through all the things that we've been through and
Through all the things we've been all the things we've seen all
The things we've known and all the things we haven't
Been told
Through all the things we fear all the things we hear
All the things we know there's no excuse for what we've become
Giving in on our ideals means giving up all of our dreams
