All love was meant to be unconditionally finding
It's way to he who would give it all,
Who would leave it all for love to set him free,
Who would live it all and worship it all to be released,
So love was meant to be unconditionally finding
It's way to me through the deepest seas over dusty roads up to the mountain peaks
We are dying alone, dying alone dying alone we're dying.
All love was meant to be unconditionally finding
It's way to he who would give it all who would leave it all for love
To set him free through the deepest seas over dusty roads up to the mountainpeaks
We are dying alone, dying alone we're dying.
All the places that I have been, today they sound like melodies,
The glances I have seen
They told me more than words could ever say
All the faces that I have seen, are colouring my memories,
They make me write and make me sing about
Then and now, and whatever life might bring, let it come,
I'll try to make the best of it knowing that love belongs to the few that seek for truth,
For the riches of the mind will as only ones transcend.
