Never make a step back, never take a step back.
I wonder why they question my utility,
Then try to narrow what's left of my liberty -
Spread your wings and learn to fly
Cause this one might get you down,
This one might hit you hard.
This one might change it all.
They'll try to make you fall.
So I free the birds inside my mind,
Let flowers grow like the spring in bloom,
Erase the past the winter of my soul.
Still some will try to cut our wings they're watching us so -
Don't speak, don't live, don't breathe
Don't be yourself. Don't let them question our utility,
They're watching every step we're makin'
Don't speak? Don't breathe, don't be yourself!
So I free the birds inside my mind then spread the wings and learn to fly towards blue skies ahead.
Free the birds and join their flight just.
Make it! Last, make it fast.
This one might get you down
This time we'll overcome. This one might change it all.
This time we'll take it all.
Don't speak, don't breathe, don't live, don't be yourself.
Don't speak, don't breathe, don't claim
No more compromisis justify this.
Don't speak, don't breathe, don't live, don't be yourself.
Listen.. listen up, hear, see, this time things are changing
Open up and feel, see, it takes much much more,
Takes much more to get me down, this time people will listen up!
