Today the world has stopped, it's turn today the clouds came tumbling down
Today everything has changed for someone somewhere
Today... There is no love in our eyes
There is no compassion in our lives, there is no love
Each fragment of a second catalyses the inevitable progress of time
Each wrinkle of your face increases the knowledge of your soul
Each fragment of a second catalyses the decomposition of the flesh
Each decision we make has effects on the course of our lives and someone else's life.

We've poisoned the waters we're drinking
We've polluted the air that we breathe
Tomorrow there won't be no more seeds
To spread on our unfertile soils.
Today someone has died for us
Today a tree got cut
Today a sea ran dry
For us, in the name of progress.
Trees are cut down and seas dried out, polluted grounds poisoned skies
Tomorrow a seed will be planted
By us, in the name of regret
We've poisoned the waters we're drinking
We've polluted the air that we breathe
Tomorrow there won't be no more seeds
To spread on our unfertile soils.
We've polluted the waters we're drinking
We've polluted the air that we breathe
Tomorrow there won't be no more seeds
To spread on our unfertile soils.
It is the age of deconstruction
The era of Shiva Times of self-inflicted pain
It's time for the used and abused to make place
It is time for a new world to shine from its grace.
Destruction breeds creation let's celebrate
Life and death.
