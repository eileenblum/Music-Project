You've got me down! You've got me where you wanted me,
You wanted me to bleed.
Life's got me down! It's got me where it wanted me - it wanted me to bleed!
Our time will come one day. Soon!
Steppin on this course, it's my choice,
Steppin on this course, life takes me exactly where it wants me to be
And I'll try to make it on this course.
My time will come as soon as I get my things done
I will live on, live on, live on, live on in words, live on in songs
I will live on, live on, live on and on.
As life goes on, on on and on
You've got me down you've got me where you wanted me
And you wanted me to be.
