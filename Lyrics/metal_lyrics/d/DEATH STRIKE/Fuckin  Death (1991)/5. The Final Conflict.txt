Reign of terror lives again

Remonstrate vigils of peace
Mutilate they spread disease
Educate them to revolt
The final conflict will explode

Reign of terror, lives again
Eyes of error breathe in sin

Disqualify them and proceed
Extract impure equality
Alleviate the ways of war
Restrain the race of nevermore

The secret army of exclusion
Strength and power restitution
Conquest is the final challenge
Agitated seasoned malice
