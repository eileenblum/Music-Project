The earth's destrpyed
Total remission
Statue of liberty down on her knees
Governmental hand of deception
Begging for mercy, plagued with disease

[Chorus:]
Remorseless poison
Political disease
Remorseless poison
Governmental deceivers

The words of all become unclear
The smell of death is in the air
The time is ticking, the blood will spill
The end is near, no more man's will

[Chorus]

The threat of life begins at birth
Severe mistrust we don't deserve
A violent struggkle or poverty
A world forgotten, a bitter end

[Chorus]
