Man killed America, land he once loved
Stood against her and wrenched her with the tool to destroy from above
Crushed the mountains, burned the prairies, drained the oceans now they're gone
Man kill America, my home sweet home

Embryonic misconception
Stemming from a recollection
Misconstrued from indiscretion

Over a prosperous fruiten meadow
Now a planet made of shadows

Rules of darkness, toys of passion
Thoughtless games of satisfaction
Wasteful thoughts of building shelter
Useless knowledge obsolescence

Hell, the hell that we create
Hell, the faceless roam the streets
The earth, the earth that we destroyed
The earth, the earth we once enjoyed
