Am I
What is forsakened
canyons of heaven
my passage only
marble the insight
give me back

I know where you have been
drink my acid
the wavy lake of dispear

Facing the reflex
the eyes of death
unity, mental extacy
metallic vains
I am highlife naked
it has no longer flesh

The God was untolerated
no redeem of it's palace

I took another turn
I mingeled with the spirits
made pale as ever before
I brought into my own light

He could have called me
Lucifer eat my movements

For whom the glue slips down
on croshed to the star

Drops of gold
like those who once were gray

This is not a black world

The noises departure of a soul,
released moving, moving
meet me on the moon

Enraptured in astral creations

Unholy distortion
holy for him
black atonements
shifting the grief
