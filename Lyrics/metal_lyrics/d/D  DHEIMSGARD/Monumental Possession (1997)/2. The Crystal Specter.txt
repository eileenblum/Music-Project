Speak of the armer
forgotten by reality
speak of the pearls
in crossing unnatural fragments

Perplex in a mortal disguise suddenly awared
Forbidden alowements in my mindwar
functioning like the scissors cut the tall ones

Due to hunger not in flesh
high as the spears was present always

Cause it wanted me to feel life without life
reborning the slaves
nevertheless dispersal of ironstakes
to have becomed itself... disinfection

The dragon of blasphemy
many others came
but all in one
theres a lot more

my invisible self
has brought to me
a circle to roam
