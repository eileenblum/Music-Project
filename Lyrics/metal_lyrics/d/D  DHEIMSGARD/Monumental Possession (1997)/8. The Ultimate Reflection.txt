Over a crystal landscape
we formed the living creatures
and made you wonder
spiteful alien warriors

Kill, they said
and twisted into enigmatic survival
engulfed by supreme art
and a thousand bloody covenants
for intolerants and hate

Threatened ten by ten
that warmed the growing seed
fulfilling the heart of light

I hold the holy in my hands
and all its lifeforms

...DEATH...

Sown into my darkest hour
darkest spirit, roams with us
in moonlight dance, the starlight waltz
I grant myself a state of life

Your mountain seemed so high to climb
where I held the light of another world
through the dreamworld cyclone
and rest forever more...
