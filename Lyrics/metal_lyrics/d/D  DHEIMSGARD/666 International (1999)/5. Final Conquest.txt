[words 12/2-99, music 95-96]

The undying strength of groundless loops,

Removed with the allies of violation in
Daylight prospects

Twisting around your strangest feelings,
Like something with crowns and crocodiles

Must they be with the shadows of the fallen gate,
As I see entangling thoughts in dark patterns
Evolving within itself
There I fall down in emphatic, evident chaos,
And suddenly take form,
Like the trinity it self, only faster
Mourning inwards,
I don't think I'll ever reach that day

Total control - a goal in reunion
Ultimate energy - immortal transfiguration
Final conquest - a shattered connection
Of love and beauty
Rest in peace, yeah, I say - Hell on earth

Crossing guards of immunity
Like shapeless claws of irony and tall fictions,

Total control - a goal in reunion
Ultimate energy - immortal transfiguration
Final conquest - a shattered connection
Of love and beauty
Rest in peace, yeah, I say - Hell on earth

Fruitless and seduced, yearning for a kiss
I am despair, my goal reached
Flesh is served, ultimate agony
Grasping my being, fearless into another mare

Wonderful and spastic, wandering along and clenching
The climate of frozen time
Hideous and accurate with bare longing
