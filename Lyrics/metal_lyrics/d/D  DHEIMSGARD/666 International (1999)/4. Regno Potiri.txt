[words 6/6-98, music 96-97]

Infernal majesty,

Gibbering... pattern, enthusiasm
Slowly affected as light becomes violent
And the exceeding of thoughts is blinded by it's slaves
Monstrous abundance, I'll share the same with you

If you can reach the stars
In the pleasantness of fertile harm, scattered all over
Experience fault, experience the tower,

Grown with its own prudence
And with sketches of the malignant three
On course with the five in line
A heart of those that pleasure must be bent before their eyes

Then I see the dragon rise

The mirror of pain, Graciously caressed
In urge to dispute the male figure
Grotesque shimmering, falsefull tales
Indocrinated formulas
Itches the claws of the humorized bat
And no life there, feeds without love
Cleansed through the whirlwinds as I
Rock the throne of delight
Harmonized as one, redeemed satisfaction, must be pleased
Circular extension, eroticism in the saddle of connection
Infernal power, open up and determine man where he stands
To make our heart complete
And watch the syndromes fall

Proud symbols to be as the seven itself
And no thing is for sure, as we glance into the black sun
The keeper of light, altogether,
Anonymously attracted to the scorpion dancing in his eyes

As our convoy melts together,
We sail the flesh as the apple gets irresistible
Life's put to peace, the silent lamb is conquered
Access, announce, might of great will
And leaps from the shore of solitary
Time to feed, time to let go
Black shimmering, carrier of crowns, prospect mirror rising
Abhorrent teardrops, landscapes, formations,
Accordingly to the ten signs

Ego, echo, tranquillity is born
Diving, divine spectre
Look at me, the draft draws nearer
Female implant, lust is turned to hunger
And freedom towers share the land increased in a global entrance
Eyes colored blue, eyes colored red
Enchanted wisdom breeds the serpents flame
In feminine oceans, united in ecstatic motion,

As we praise the flesh of sodomy with bestial behavior
"O'moonshine", endanger this vioscope glass arena
We see, it's the fall of the false redeemer
He with no hands
Admiring the triumphant move of the elephant
Rhythmic adjustment, sources are bound
A descendant of pleasure in all ways
Divided, stonedrops-silverblue
As long as evil breeds
