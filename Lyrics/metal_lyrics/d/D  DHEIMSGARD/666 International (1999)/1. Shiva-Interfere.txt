[words 4/2-99, music 97-98]

Abstract tears to the ground
Soft years of melancholy
A draft of inner advice
To welcome the strangers neighbor
A vast, swift talk of romance and despair
A bellboy's journey through the eight limbs of Yoga

An efficient success of lost ego and body
Flannel flirtation, a chasm of childish obedience
And I can see you all, for this is without blur

Glorious destruction
Glorious creation
Grimly folds with luminous elegance
Winged between the corroded amber

I scent a fragrance from the past
Bright as death, it came soaring towards me
Something's missing and I don't know what it is
Forlon satisfaction, admitting the selfish seal
And the serpent's steel

Directly from the ocean of flowers
Visual contact, planet B8----18
Sonar disturbance
Asmodeus comes with terror
In spontaneous air corridors
All for the phantom to inhale
For today is forever

And the world grew without form
And for those who planted their seeds of
Reliant vulnerability
Chakra Nadmara, I wish I was as fresh as you
Find your way, the "asphyx" teaches
Rumble, dismay, a chronicle of the samurai

Oh you are crystalline, I say, you are made of pain
For only suffering can create such beauty
And only suffering can wipe out your tears

I remember I ate of the tree
And hence of the wisdom of which we may speak of
The tedious ones are those who attends the mask of
Which they seek

I open up for the flavor of starvation
There is absolutely no one there,
And "his" is for sure, as we grasp to reach the light
Slowly to mosey
I'll drag you by your horns
For with a whirling emblem cracking the dawn,
I face the goat at sunrise
