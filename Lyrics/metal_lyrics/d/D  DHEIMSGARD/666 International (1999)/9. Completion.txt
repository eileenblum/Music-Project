[words 1/1-99, music 95-97]

All sorts of ideas
We swarm and we seek
Destined to destroy
Destined to joy

Wish to neglect
Wish to defeat
Juvenile with hall steps
Juvenile with threat

I am with power
I am within
I am with flesh
I am your sin

Naked with balance
Naked in deep
Naked for the first
Naked as we keep

Tall and loud
A shelter for the bleak

I will be your sleep
Blow me throught your canyon

Let me see your apprehension
Smooth and soft
Slick and shallow
Vulnerable reaction
A starlight to receive

I am with power
I am within
I am with flesh
I am your sin

Naked with balance
Naked in deep
Naked for the first
Naked as we keep

Tall and loud
A shelter for the bleak

A short monstrous affair
A pallid gray to hear

Storming through the ego ways
Like something sudden seen
A solvent desolation
A measure stands (just) as mean

Short road epidemic
A child is on the run
As for this I challenge you
On my journey to the sun

I've danced with snakes
I've danced with death
I've seen the short ones die
A manic kill, an epic thrill
I've seen the young ones fly

As all is said, we cross the storm
And watch ourselves in pray
For this no longer a mutant that shivers
This is here to stay
