The devil hides inside fractal patterns
Beyond the singularity
Where everything you lost is waiting
Archaeologic burden of excrements
The fluent fluctuation,
Of feverish mental rash
Behind you, stretching wide
The scent of remembrance
While another you,
Waiting in the cosmic ash

Chaos fathers a moment's structure
Below the aching arcs of all heavens
And in the midst of it all, a single mind
That dreamt the truth, but woke up lying
For his own salvation, his own escape?

The function withers,
But the form remains
Forever altered, by past deeds
Unable to wash the sordid stains
Unable to proceed

Wherever I tread
No road ahead
Time without limit
Eternity in a minute

Taught to nurture
But if you care you break
Indulge the hollow torture
Reach heaven through heartache

Wherever I tread
No road ahead
Time without limit
Eternity in a minute

Disclosed to the vermin's appetite
Like cannibals...we devour...
Our humanity

In the last days of dreams
Towards a pale array orbit
Hiding inside our darkest deeds
Tomorrow we all bleed, we all fall....
And admire...
We all approach, the unforgiving fire
We believe....
(That) the ruler of the realm revealed
Our warm adulation...
In coming before his voice...
....To tremble....
