Weapons of mass-hypnosis
Alert resistant failure
Proudly gifted with skills
Of indoctrination
Close your eyes and follow me
And I will show you
Where to search and how to die

Hiding in glamorous smite
Provided at ground zero
A frozen echo unborn
Between worlds so deep they
Cannot be reached
In ancient urge, pretend or fly
Still your smile remains a fraud

I hail those whose pulse beats free
When strong in strangulation
Too far a journey
To hold the mask in three
Sessions for credible superior scorn

Your mind astray see only hope
In what to taste and touch
Come and take your place beside me
And clarity of vision will emerge

With weapons of mass-crises
Bewildered thoughts succeed
When basic fear reigns sublime

My heart in heaven, my soul in hell
What and who to follow
Some dead man's division
Or lessons learned in cruelty?
Hollow heart, subsiding soul
Unhinged devastation exhumed
Take control when
Bottom-floor cracks
Unlocking hell's prison
Hollow heart, subsiding soul
Unhinged devastation exhumed
Take control when
Bottom-floor cracks
Unlocking hell's prison

Impermanent state contaminated
Inferior fool dement
Significant woe given
Infectious blood brewing

Destination agony
Gathering every sign
Capable of killing
A prosperous potent instinct
In willfulness like that
No answers are needed
As uncertainty becomes
The singularity

From this day on
Trapped and screaming
You will forever remain
As lost and drained as completely
Fulfilled

Take me there
To snare in attack at those
Molded in frames of suffering
Only to realise death

I hail those whose pulse beats free
When strong in strangulation
Too far a journey
To hold the mask in three
Sessions for credible superior scorn
