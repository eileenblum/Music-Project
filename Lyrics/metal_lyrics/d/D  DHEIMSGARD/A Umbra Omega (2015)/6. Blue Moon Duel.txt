I got in on a high note
And went out with a rope around
My neck
With a white suit and a helmet
To care for the omnivore nature
Calling inside
Though I was not able to eat
Nor did I fall into place
A gift from the heavens to obey
While fear and danger duelled
And spiritual savages ravished
Our sanity

On a platform where the aging
Of skin could tell
A story about reflecting thoughts
Promptly ascending
From a far away emotion
A nocturnal blessing for sure

Headhunting the apathy in which I dwell
Troops of a blue moon in descent
Clapping their hands
While feverish conformities
Stepped aside
Soaked in desperation and clarity
Unspoiled and naked as a human can be
We beheld vile flowers in my garden
Growing out of hand
Surrounding us in captivity

Suffering elevated to mind expansion
Your world is safe because it is illusion
Yet another scope to unfurl
Out with the human syndrome

Look outside, see inside
No one is real, nothing is unreal
Whatever is, everyone isn't
Of your life there is no trace

No sign of your death
No ego, no spirit
No zero, no infinite
Don't hide away

Let me out, I shouted
Set me free from this enslavement
Dig me up to the floors above
Immediately pull out the waste
While forgetting whose name we stole
At the brewery where flies got drunk
The place in between all calendar days
A crystallized moment in sublime
Darkness

Goat-horns growing
Penetrating mental mirrors
My world becomes distorted
I crumble on the floor
Counting the hours, not able though

'Cause panic fuels itself
And hysteria takes control
Nothing is alive to rescue me

O` wonderful palace of instigation
I find myself crying red tears
Nothing can ever wash away
The stains left on my skin

I utilize the moonlight
And fall apart in madness
A cylinder-formed state of mind
With downward spirals
O` great goddess of flesh and
Tomorrow
Grant me a second chance
And I'll sure cry you these tears
Forever
