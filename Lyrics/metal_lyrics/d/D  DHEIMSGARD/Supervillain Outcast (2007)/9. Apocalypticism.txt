A soldier comes home from the war
To four walls
And nothing
Children search for their parents
Forever
But they keep on looking
A father returns home from work
And murders his family
A priest looses his faith in God
His formative years steered in tragedy
Politicians become impostors
Comforting words of the backwoodsmen
A troubled drifter with a guilty past
A cabin of corpses by an old dirt track

This is the dawn of the apocalypse
Open your heart to the apocalypse
I want to watch you burn in the apocalypse
I'll make you learn for the apocalypse

An elderly couple sit by the fire
With gunshot wounds to the skull
A talk show host is found face down
In a public swimming pool
A corrupt official abuses his position
An old vagrant in the park
Mutilated beyond recognition
International leaders break down on live TV
The suicide of an old school master
Miserable and lonely

This is the dawn of the apocalypse
Open your heart to the apocalypse
I want to watch you burn in the apocalypse
I'll make you learn for the apocalypse
