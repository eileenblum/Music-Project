Bare hands
Bones crack
Skin is slack
Clickety clack
Goodnight
Mister nobody is back
Behind the sofa
Memories crawl
Scribbling all the while
On a contorted soul
A reluctant reply
Jagged and morose
Avenge me
Outlandish journey
Voice the recluse
Closing the book
Opens the nose
A sick compromise
For the true heroes of justice
He passed this curse
On to me
I have to bear
In my blackened brain
Forever striving for justice
Non-refundable soul receipt
A paycheck that never clears
A currency of pain
Blood sweat and tears
Symmetry to necessity
My inseparable master
Shoot to kill
Shoot to kill
Forever indebted to hell
Symmetry to necessity
The ultimate master
Shoot to kill
Shoot to kill
Forever indebted to hell
Fresh fuel for the firing squad
A glint in the hitlist
Begging for mercy
Like a smiling sailor back from the sea
The five decays of human deceit
As the genius who fought himself could see
Dr.Jackal and formaldehyde's last mystery
Twin cohorts in devilish design
Legends of the supervillain industry
Symmetry to necessity
My inseparable master
Shoot to kill
Shoot to kill
Forever indebted to hell
Symmetry to necessity
The ultimate master
Shoot to kill
Shoot to kill
Forever indebted to hell
