Lonely riders
Strange bed
Long trip
Intestinal breath
Family stacked
In a tool shed
10 - year erection
After all the humans are dead
Burning assholes
Vampire dreams
Swimming pool murder scenes
Schizophrenic marriage
To your own flesh
Stranger's lips
Whisper something through
Wire Mesh
All the monsters will break your heart
The future gave up
Emotionally bankrupt
No fear or remorse
Brought up on old nightmares
And life goes on going nowhere
Grim fortune
Spurned friends
The road alone
Between us and nothing
The sky in transit
Salt sad salute
Sober no more
Gnawing at my own bones
Weak revenge of the fierce
Post your prayers to the
Apocalypse
On the run
On the run
Into the slung lips
And adhesive arms
of the strange one
All the monsters will break your heart
The future gave up
Emotionally bankrupt
No fear or remorse
Brought up on old nightmares
And life goes on going nowhere
In this light
We'd look good
With our teeth smashed out
Hunger and clouds
I'll never be clean again
