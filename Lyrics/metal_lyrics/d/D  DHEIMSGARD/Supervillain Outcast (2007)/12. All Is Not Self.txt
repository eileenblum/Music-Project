In the cold neurotic night
I can't bring myself to tell you
I'm not who you thought I am
And I'd laugh until I died

I'm leading a quiet life
At an abandoned casino of nightmares

As if a stranger's face
Came home to play
And I lost my way
Something is missing

All day long
The light leaves lines of panic on the vine
It doesn't matter how hard you try
Wraiths astride tame tigers
We're tied to altars in the sky

If an abstract shell
Of a man remains
I won't be the same again
