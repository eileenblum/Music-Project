[Music and Lyrics by K.K Warslut]

This is retribution...
... for all those who died!

So come to me all you philosophers,
I have a use for all your words,
And as for poets and bards,
Sycophants to every scar,
(Burn, burn, BURN!)

And as for you lovers of light,
You are prisoners on all sides,
(Burn, burn, BURN!)

And as for you humanists,
I give the gift of pestilence!
(Burn, burn, BURN!)

This is Tyranny...
This is Retribution...
... for all those who died!

And as for your politics,
You march in circles with semantic tricks,
(Traitors!)

And as for you occultists,
You hide in shadows with your books,
And fuck you all religious fools,
Your gods, your temples, your fucking rules,
(Burn, burn, BURN!)

I have no need for pessimism,
I believe in Nihilism!
(Burn, burn, BURN!)

Spare none the blade...
Spare none the fucking blade!

This is Tyranny!
This is Retribution!
For all those who died,
From those who lied!

And emperors of golden halls,
You built your tomb within your walls,
(Burn, burn, BURN!)

So blessed be the murderers,
Who work like wicked conjurers!
(Thrown into the fire!)

Spare none the blade!
Spare none the fucking blade!

Rape the world!
