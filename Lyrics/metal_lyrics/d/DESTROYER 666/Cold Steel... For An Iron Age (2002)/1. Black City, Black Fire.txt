When I see all that's been
Forgiveness was my greatest sin
So I took a knife to my pity
To the people in black city

Fire! Black fire!
Fire! Black fire!
Fire! Black fire!
Fire! Black fire!

Truth chooses the strangest words
Not the tongue of the common herd
So take a blade let it bleed
Fuck the people in black city!

Fire! Black fire!
Fire! Black fire!
Fire! Black fire!
Fire! Black fire!

I was a brazen prince and cold
Now a king on an oaken throne
These dark ages mean nothing to me
For I have forsaken black city

Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees

So never bow to any gods
Tame wolves are nothing but dogs
So take a blade let it bleed
To the people in black city
