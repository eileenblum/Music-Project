And yea tho' you walk in the shadow of self
Do not be afraid if you find it is hell
Do not be a slave to just what has been
To make the virtue of demons is the "ultimate" sin!

So fear not my friends for the hour draws near
Better to have lived fast, than to die old with fear
Though the old may be wise
No strength to they wield
They envy the young
For by life not death they are killed!
