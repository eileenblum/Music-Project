SS Metal

Gather round me all my friends
We'll raise the banner raise some hell
Gettin' boozed up to fight the fight
We won't stop 'til we see the light

I saw the satanic plague
spread around the world
I was born to invert the cross
and scorn the name of jesus christ
Yes I was!!

Satanic Speed Metal!
Satanic Speed Metal!
I fuckin want it!
Satanic Speed Metal!
I fuckin need it!
Satanic Speed Metal!

The years have passed, I'm so much older
A little wilder, a little colder
Whiskey, metal, leather, sex
Traditions upheld these years to the next

I saw the satanic plague
Spread around the world
Cruisin at a thousand miles per hour
Feel the rush of the SS metal power
