Evolution, forever unbound,
robe of stars, a genetic crown,
Architect of endless skies,
In man's son, our destiny lies,

Triumphant!
Triumphant!
Triumphant!

The King of Kings!
Bold conqueror's sire!

Our revolution, has just begun,
Our eternal chant, forever as one!

Triumphant!
Triumphant!
Triumphant!

King of Kings!
Caesar
King of Kings!
Leader!
King of Kings!
Master!
King of Kings!
CONQUEROR!

All hail the King of Kings

So let us break into a new world,
Far beyond these shores!

Christ deluded,
Drudgery slaves,
Forever hold back,
Promethean flame,

So let us make,
A new man to break,
Into the void,
Universal chase,

Salvation is survival,
and survival is the sword,

All hail the King of Kings

Light the Promethean flame!
Light the Promethean flame!

The Prince of strife am I,
My legions roar for treasure,
My trumpets blow the challenge,
Across the skies my banners flame, home
