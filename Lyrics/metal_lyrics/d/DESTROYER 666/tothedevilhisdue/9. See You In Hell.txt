Hear the Rebel Call Eurekas Ban
The wolves ride out on our command
I am All, for I am legion
One touch and her gates to Hell are Open

Hold fast the reins, Black Stallions cross the desert plains
Riding hard the clarion of war 
Into battle once and evermore

The Foreign Legion, the Low Countries, 
They fight together...
The Italian Black Guard and the Conquistadors
To uphold the new age of iron law

Hold fast the reins, Black Stallions cross the desert plains
Riding hard the clarion of war 
Into battle once and evermore

The Easter Dogs of War they howl and rage 
Joined in Chorus by Our Comrades 
The wolves of Deutschland , Den Norden volk, 
The Suomi Hordes and the Baltic states 

This life we have chosen
Is a path of No Return 
No Remorse, No Regrets 
No way Back, We'll raise our glasses yet
Savage minds aligned in a cauldron pit 
Fury laced with poison, the inner fuse is lit
We are the Sons of the Southern Cross
Born wild wolves, Irreverent
Hot Blooded, sometimes blind
If your with us, we'll see you in Hell
