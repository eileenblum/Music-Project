[Based loosely on the poem Black Magic by Rose Norton]

Night riders across the sky,
Midnight sun, black and light,
Lord of the wild and living stars,
Black magic souls and Master of Death,

Prowl in my spirit with black tongue of fire,
Terror, ecstasy and desire,
Hatred and heaven, calling to me:
"Lord of the Wild will set you free"

I am a child of the Shadows,
Woman of the night, I'll set you free!

You're in your own solitude,
But there is no loneliness in you,
As night draws near it's your turn to see,
You Dark spirit are with me!

"I am the Lord of the Wild"
