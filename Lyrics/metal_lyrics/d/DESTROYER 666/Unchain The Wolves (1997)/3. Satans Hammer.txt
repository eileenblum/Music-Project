Now!

Kick it in!

Above the city the hillside it burns
The witches drink the demon sperm
Conjure the fires that first lit the Earth
Summon lightning to stab at the world

Start the attack!
Fire at will!

Start the attack!
Fire at will!

All right
All I heard was the sound of black fucking jackals
Howling at the moon

Come on evil, take me in your black embrace
Come on evil, spread your demon wings
Come on Christians, say your prayers
You won't escape Satan's hammer

Come on evil, take me in your black embrace
Come on evil, spread your demon wings
Come on Christians, say your prayers
You won't escape Satan's hammer

Come on evil, take me in your black embrace
Come on evil, spread your demon wings
Come on Christians, say your prayers
You won't escape Satan's hammer

In the valley, the destruction it starts
Satan laughs at the bleeding hearts
Mercy's reserved for the hordes of sluts
They're on their knees praying and fuck

Start the attack!
Fire at will!

Start the attack!
Fire at will!

Come on evil, Satan's hammer waits to fall
Come on evil, face our metal storm

Come on evil, take me in your black embrace
Come on evil, spread your demon wings
Come on evil, send your storm troopers' in
You won't escape Satan's hammer

Come on evil, take me in your black embrace
Come on evil, spread your demon wings
Come on Christians, say your prayers
You won't escape Satan's hammer
