Does it seem to you that the days are shorter
And does it seem to you that the nights seem so much longer
Well it does to me, and in time you will see
That the fate of the world is burning in fire

Peace is a dream and dreams are for sleepers
Watch your back be aware, don't let them deceive us

Cause you know they'd have us in fucking chains! Chains!
Cause you know they'd have us in fucking chains! Chains!
And the fate of the world is burning in fire!

What if the battle began at dawn
Would you come and fight the war,
Would you join us?
Would you join us?
What if we called in the dead of night
Would you leave your woman and fight,
Would you join us?
Would you join us?

A world without war is like a city without whores
Have you seen the crashing waves upon the still night shores?
Cause you know they'd have us in fucking chains! Chains!
Cause you know they'd have us in fucking chains! Chains!
And the fate of the world is burning in fire!

What if the battle began at dawn
Would you come and fight the war,
Would you join us?
Would you join us?
What if we called in the dead of night
Would you leave your woman and fight,
Would you join us?
Would you join us?

Charge!

From genesis to genocide, live your life with pride
Keep your eyes open at night time
Of the beast at hand, beyond the shadow of man
Beyond the shadow of light
I see in the wolf's eyes, no look of moral lie
I tell you it's the look of evil
Eyes that never lie, beyond mercy's cries
From genesis to genocide

Can you see the true face of evil?!
