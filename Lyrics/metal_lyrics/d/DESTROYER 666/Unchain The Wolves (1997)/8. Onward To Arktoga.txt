Onward to Arktoga
Onward to Arktoga
Onward to Arktoga
I am the son of this creature
I am the son of a world at its loss
I am the lonely mans growl
I am the lonely wolves howl
I am the son of this future
I am the son of a world at its loss
We are watching civilization, falling to it's knees
We are watching civilization, falling to it's knees
This is a story of a lost age
The lost knoll
Hail the coming of a new age
If we survive
We are watching civilization, falling to it's knees

Thanks to kevin-klein for sending track #8 lyrics.
