I don't believe in your wrong and right
And I get the urge to walk at night

And I don't believe in your god above
And I don't believe in your tales of love
Can you hear me?

I'd rather reign in Hell, than serve your god
Don't wanna be chained to your cross
I'm not ashamed to be white
Paying penance to fools is a waste of my life
Anti-Christ
Anti-Christ
Anti-Christ
Anti-Christ
Anti-Christ
Anti-Christ
To the devil we gave our life

Black hearted demons fight the metal fight
Raging from Hades in leather and spikes
Australian and Anti-Christ
Australian and Anti-Christ

Black hearted demons fight the metal fight
Raging from Hades in leather and spikes
Australian and Anti-Christ
Australian and Anti-Christ

We don't forgive and we don't forget
We're just out for what we can get
We got denim vests and a sordid past
Too many drinks, tattoos and scars

Black hearted demons fight the metal fight
Raging from Hades in leather and spikes
Australian and Anti-Christ
Australian and Anti-Christ

Destroyer 666 is the Anti-Christ
