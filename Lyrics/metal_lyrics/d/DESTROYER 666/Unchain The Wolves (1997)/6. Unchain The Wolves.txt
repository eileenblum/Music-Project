Rise!
Rise!

Let me tell you a story deep drenched in blood
That unites all of Europe's sons
Let me tell you about the werewolf in man
Before he was whipped by the chains of heaven

Summon the werewolf blood
Summon the wolves of war
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Set the night on fire

When the scourge of the cross
Fell upon our land
They took the occult magic of the white man
Now in this age of iron when the end is near
The wolf it cries out for the night man

Summon the werewolf blood
Summon the wolves of war
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Set the night on fire
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Set them fucking wild

Summon the werewolf blood
Summon the wolves of war
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Set the night on fire
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Unchain the wolves
Set them fucking wild

Can you see the falling of the heavens?
Can you see the flames of Satan rise?

What they want they can't take away
They want our souls to make us slaves
None to easy when they're fighting the strong

We're the demons in the night
We're the jackals at the break of light
Watch the rising of the tide
We're the wolves in the night

Can you see the falling of the heavens?
Can you see the swastika turning?
Can you see the world burning?

So they think they can keep us blind
We must be aware to survive
One spirit did not die in the crusades
The strength is still here today
Listen to the echoes of your soul
Listen to what our ancestors want
It's not them burning below
It's us who is forced to live in this Hell

Oh, tonight it rains again, but life it's scarce my friends
Don't seek your trust in fools, not your love in whores
Watch your back at night and sleep with open eyes
The law of nature did not die
In fact it still stands

A time is coming soon
A time of sorrow and of war
When a new day dawns
A new day dawns
A new day dawns
A new day dawns
A new day dawns
A new day dawns
A new day dawns
A new day dawns
When a new day dawns
