Six curses from a spiritual wasteland
What is it, that makes the nightmare so real
What is it, that makes the world so fucked

I wasn't born to play their games
I don't have the time to waste

I know what I had to do, out beneath the moon
Had to be a wolf again
Had to be a wolf again

Some say that I'm a cunt, the godless deceiver
They'll never change my ways, I'm born and bred a heathen
Some say that I'm a liar, but I never lied to myself
Some say that I can't see, well I know that I'm blind
Drunk on the blood of angels
All right

Six curses from a spiritual wasteland
Six curses from a spiritual wasteland
Six curses cast on the heart of the world
Evil lurks in every shadow
And every sound of death is the sound of the world's end

What is it that makes the nightmare so real
What is it that makes the world so fucked
What is it that makes the fucking world so fucked
What is it!
What is it!
