All right let the demon speak!

A bell tolls at midnight
A summon for murder
The vultures flew high that night
Looking for murder

The winds they blew black that night
A warning from Satan
Across the seas they came in white
A sign

A rider was seen, appeared from the mist
Around his neck, a crucifix
He came with a cult, from another place
Then cursed our people, with this plague
Fuckers!

Beware the legions of Satan
They're ready for attack!

Beware the legions of Satan
They're ready for attack!

Beware the legions of Satan
They're ready for attack!

Beware the legions of Satan
They're ready for attack!

But it's all the same
They say we're devils, sing devil sons
We're evil!

A rider was seen, appeared from the mist
Axe and shield and leathered fist

Better beware of the final attack
Better beware, the cause we are back
