So has my truth been tested by time
Reckoned by age, trialed by fire?
Was there wisdom in what I believed
Or was it ghosts by whom I was deceived?

The world has now taught me many things
And one I'll pass onto you
The world that we are looking for,
Well it isn't coming soon
Dreamers of utopia, delusions and visions
Lay down your arms, repent decision
For the dead and idealists, nothing but liars
This is our trial by fire

Better to repeat just one truth,
Than to scream a thousand lies
For a life without honour is no life at all
(It's) better to have nothing
Than the promise of fool's gold
So what have I found on this trail,
Free spirits of lost souls?
The brave, the broken, the ghosts of desolation
Though silent, still they are heard
Reckoned by age, trialed by fire

I climbed one mountainside, to find yet another
An eternity of darkness for us yet to uncover
And my soul pines for rest
In the heat of the flame I desire
