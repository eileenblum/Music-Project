Jaws snap!
Driving onward with relentless will
Run down, exhaust the herd for the final kill
The spirit of predation
The strength of the wolf is in the pack that moves as one
Howling wild with elation bound we are strong

Gather round your weakest ones
Wall of horns against their fate
Violence is the highest law
And from this fact thereâs no escape

(In) fallen age this wall of horns
Protects the feeble form the strong
Built from laws and forged from lies
It cannot hold for long
Violence â is golden
(Cleanse the world in river of blood)
Violence â is golden
(Drowning all nations in hot, holy blood)

The wrath of the outlaw
The threat and the danger
No good can come of your hope
Thereâs always hate
And what of the others
Those who deceive
And those who would forsake their lives
A fatal mistake

ARISE, TO SEE, THE WORLD

SO BREAK OUT THE DRINKS, THEREâS GONNA BE SLAUGHTER
THE VANDALS THE HUNS AND THE WOLVES ARE BREAKING THEIR CHAINS
THE IRON IS COLD, THE URGE IS PRIMEVAL
THERE WILL BE BLOOD ON MY HANDS, VIOLENCE OUR FAITH
