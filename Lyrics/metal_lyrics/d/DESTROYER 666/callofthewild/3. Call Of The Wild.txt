A howl in the night, your skin is crawling
Canât help yourself, the wildness is calling
Under the trance and the spell of the night
A yearning for freedom that comes
When you learn how to fight

Learning to summon relinquish control
Yearning desire consumes your soul
Relish the pain, blood rings you pride
Knuckles split red and youâve never felt so alive

The call of the wild in the black
The silence that warns of attack

Learning to let loose far from the world
Burning till midnight to wolf youâll turn
Forcing yourself in dark flame
Itâs a sacrifice to the call of the wild

Learning to let loose far from the world
raging in fires of passion you burn
Forging yourself in dark flame
Itâs a sacrifice to the call of the wild

Raging like wildfire hunting for prey
Deep in the valley below
Reaping like whirlwinds into the prey
A gift of death they bestow

That night is gone, but alive in your heart
Memories of that night threaten to tear you apart
Taking the long road, hitching with drifters
Riding at midnight like a shapeshifter
