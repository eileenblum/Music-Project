Self-flagellation
Empty platitudes
Death of a thousand cuts
Hack their way through you

Changing guard
New division
Empire rise
On malediction

A 1000 pious candles
Born by barren wombs
Coward Unter-ratten
Consecrate their tombs

Changing guard
A new division â no submission
Empire rise
On malediction

As dawn chases night
time rusts their throne
Yet new kingdoms rise
Stone by stone

As night follows day
All must lose their throne
Yet new kingdoms rise
Stone by stone

Over time the veil it does burn
If glorious death were my only concern
Plague of fire is my morbid vision
Stone by stone to extinction

Profane is the crime
Tragic is the loss
Neurotic altruism
I deny the new religion

Over time the veil it does burn
If only death were my only concern
I see fires in my great vision
Stone by stone to extinction
New dark age or extinction

So letâs build a new world
Upon the ashes of the old
We will see our kingdom rise
Stone by stone
