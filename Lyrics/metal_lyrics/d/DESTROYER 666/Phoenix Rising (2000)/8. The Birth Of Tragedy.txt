Dishonour plays a tune of pleasure
Dishonour plays a tune of pleasure
and pleasure takes it's toll...
Into the grave

We search for shining Palaces
Then build them on shifting sands
We bow down before our Nemesis
and cry tears to the frailty of man

And though it seems a great two edged sword
And confusion lies behind our words
The gleam of the blade beckons us still
Calling us on in search of the Grail
