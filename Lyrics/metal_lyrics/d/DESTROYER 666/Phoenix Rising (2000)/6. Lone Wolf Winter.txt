[Warslut/Shrapnel]

Lone Wolf Winter...
Alone again
Lookin' sideways
Paranoid again

Gotta get out
Out of here
Cannot breathe
With the Stench of Fear!

Black days and blacker Nights
Gets the Gift of the Second Sight
Don't believe that I belong,
Don't feel right but I don't feel wrong

I think I'm a Wolf, then I'm Crazy,
I think what I need is a Bitch, don't you?

How is it that I have become the Hunter and the Hunted
and thought has become my enemy?
Memory falls away behind me, leaving me in Despair
I run but I cannot hide, the Terror is inside
I awake but the Nightmare is still here
