It's not enough to listen
It's not enough to see
When the hurricane is coming,
It's not enough to flee
It's not enough to be in love
We hide behind the word
It's not enough to be alive
When your future's deferred

When the voice goes unheard
And your sons go on with song
And the one thing you loved the most
Now stands on the Altar
Drenched in blood!
