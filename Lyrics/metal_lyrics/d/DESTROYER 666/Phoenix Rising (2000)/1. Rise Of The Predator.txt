[Warslut/Bullet Eater]

Come taste the blood and the
Fear of the Prey as it
Falls to the Jaws of the Beast

Come feel the Rushing of
Senses and Blood as it
courses and allows you to be

[Chorus:]
A Predator
Predator
Predator

Come tear the Shackles of
Thought from our minds and be
Rid of this anxious Disease

Beware the burning
The lie that is turning
your eyes
From Necessity...
BEAST!

[Chorus:]
Predator
Predator
Predator

A body change
A mental frame
Another phase

The Fire
The Desire
To Live

The Will
The Steel
In Breeds...PREDATION!
