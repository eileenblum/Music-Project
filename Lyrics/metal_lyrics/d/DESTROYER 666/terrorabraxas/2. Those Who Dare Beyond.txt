Hunger pumping the venom to strike
Anger ablaze eternal light
Fist full of steel eyes of pain
Fighting the fight in our domain
Fire is the source
Passion lusting to rasp
Dreams of wicked falling before us

But passion sells out
Nothing more than a game
Once was strong, now only few remain

Riding the force
Feeling the heat and the will
Reaching beyond what is seen
Only those who dare beyond
The understood

The taste of blood in our mouths
Biting the bit, breaking the chains
Of the horde, quicken the pace
Running the gauntlet of the sword

Fast stalk, on which we prey
Taking charge of destiny
Seize the day, seize the night
Taking all which is our right
