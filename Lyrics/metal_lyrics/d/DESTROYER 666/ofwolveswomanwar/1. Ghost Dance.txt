Come to the ritual, they say it'll save our souls
Make the demon go away - not so grim and cold
Come and meet your maker, come and sing his praise
Dance onto your death, dance onto your graves

[Chorus: ]

So you've come to give your life to a god with a knife
(But guns strike back at you)
You beat the earth with blood and toil
Dust rises and when it falls...................
(Death shall greet you all!)

Fall to the sound of thunder
Cracks the sky it rains
Your gods are crying blood
Red stains the earth and it's stench
Lurks up from the blood stained death!

[Chorus: ]

So your sons and daughters lay there dead
And old you watch in fear and dread
Yet those who escaped the fire
Will live to tell of the Ghost Dance Liar

But don't believe this story's new
It's going on and always will
The greater force subjugates the meek
One day the strong will be the weak

Come to the ritual, they say it'll save our souls
Make the demon go away - not so grim and cold
Come and meet your maker, come and sing his praise
Dance onto your death, dance onto your graves

[Chorus: ]

So you've come to give your lives to a god with a knife....
