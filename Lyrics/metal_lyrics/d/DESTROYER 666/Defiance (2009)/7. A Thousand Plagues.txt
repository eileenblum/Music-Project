When every fool is given a voice,
And every fool is given the right
Through the roar of the maddening crowd,
You just might hear the drums resounding.

A momentary lapse of treason on the millennial stage,
A linear history manifest; a mass delusion by bequest.
Now, in this age of treason, a million righteous fools
Invoke a million Gods, as in the age of stone.

Christians and Zionist Jews, Crescent Moon peasants,
Marxist tyrants and childless hypocrites,
Tell me where the truth lies,
And I'll tell you which lie is truth,
Another fucking clichÃ© to misconstrue!

Men of usury, count your coin - you'd do better to count your days,
Women of perjury - you'll rue the night you gave yourself away,
Narcotic child; come, you'll see -
I fear not for your soul has fled from thee.

So, beware the lure of religion
And beware the voice of idealism,
Cast off the garb of your eloquence,
Your romantic vision and their pretence.

Fuck them all, all ye of little faith
Let the wolves awaken!
Fuck them all - each and every one!
A thousand plagues upon them!

"By god you're cunning, they never knew,
Behind the vision there was you,
You are cold, like a shadow,
Like a knife in the lives of the shallow."

Fuck them all, each and every one -
A thousand plagues upon them!

Fuck them all! Salt the earth and betray them!
If there's a god above, then hear my call:
A thousand plagues upon them!
One last request, to wish them Hell.

My epitaph... my final word:
A thousand plagues upon them!
