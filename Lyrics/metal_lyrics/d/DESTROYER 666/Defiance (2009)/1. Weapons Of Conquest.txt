Forged in the same fire, plagued by the same affliction
Born of the same blood, torn from the same womb
Oppressed by the same foe, encircled by the friends
Unleash! Unleash! The egress from Eden!

Toe to toe, face to face
With the captors
Inch by inch take the ground
Drive them backwards

No distant bond will stay my hand
Drive the brethren from the land
Seeded from the same source
Now sewn in isolation
Thrust before the ice tides
Scattered on the wind

The barren and the fertile, the fallow and the fair, survival and extinction
Driven by internal fire, the continents collide
Unleashed, unleashed, the weapons of conquest

To the herd and the land, no more bonded
Driven by avarice, now absconded
The strands of fate entwine the worlds
As blood drenched standards are unfurled

Viral strain to decimate, in desperation retaliate
Stone and wood meet blade of steel, tectonic fate the kings annealed
Steel and plague, fire and lead, destiny manifest by the weapon of conquest

Which capricious fate delivers the world?
Can the fires that stir the molten core grant domination of the earth?
