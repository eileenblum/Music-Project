It's true what they say - the world's a mess and deserves no quarter,
and it's true you're out of my depth, you're drowning in shallow water.

[Chorus:]
I'm not deluded, I am not deceived - I am not taken with your mystery!
Let revelation stock the world, unfurl the raging sea - let the tempest rise tonight and set the beast within free.

Another crisis, another fear - another prophecy to declare
One more tirade, another lie - another reason to despise.

[Chorus]

With eyes of the cobra that spit out death,
like a shark coming from the black depths,
and we'll die as it all once began - like a burning fire brand.
So take me back - back again,
Lead me to where it all began.

So tear at the sky with razor sharp talons!
Lacerate, fly high - burn!

[Chorus]
