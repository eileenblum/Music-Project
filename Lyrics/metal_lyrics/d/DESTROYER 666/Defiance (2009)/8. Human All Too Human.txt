Is it with sadness you hang your head, or shame?
Is it your burden that leaves you bloodstained...?
No song, no words, will ease your regret.
No drug, no love will let you forget.

For they are but fleeting, like words in the wind,
Wild nights, sobered by the dawn.
For they are without meaning, like honourless men
Broken vows laid bare before the dawn.

Like a wild dog ensnared, you'll eat yourself free
To rejoin the shadow of the hunting jaguar.
I once believed I held the answer in the palm of my hand,
And toyed with it like a child.

No song, no words, will ease your regret.
No drug, no love will let you forget.

On the brink of self-annihilation,
A lightning strike revelation:
How easily that we lie for our shallow love and hollow pride,
How vainly we do attempt to stem the tide of consciousness,
How easily we are led on the merry dance to our death.
How willing that we follow to our doom, to our sorrow!

How entranced we are by the fire,
Or enslaved to our own desires.
Human - all too fucking human!

Watch the naked ape,
Grovelling before the stars,
Scratching at the sky.
Your trials and tribulations,
They reek of self-infatuation.

Human - all too fucking human!
