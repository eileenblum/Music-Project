The Ionian fire - it flickers and falls in the cold wind,
In the streets, the cities ablazing,
The final descent, the spirals turning;
The barricades are breaking

At breakneck speed, a celestial pestilence descends upon the world
And delivers a sacred gift of everlasting death.
Get on board the ship, it's sinking,
The barricades are breaking!

Annihilate, envenom, impregnate!
Decimate - reduce to ashes. A war of attrition,
A sullen contrition, the stench of redemption,
We have no need of your salvation,

Raise the standard from the broken city walls
Another harbinger of doom, a herald of annihilation.
Get on board the ship, it's sinking,
The barricades are breaking!

Can't you hear the wolves at the door?
The barricades are breaking!
