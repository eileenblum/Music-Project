We were born in a desert storm
on thirteen tolling bells
And in a torrent of blood we did come
upon this wicked world

Raised by bitches in leopard skin
who taught us all the pleasures of sin
And right or wrong we've made mistakes
playin' the hand of fools and fate

'Cos WE'RE LIVIN'... We'll live and burn!
'Cos WE'RE LIVIN'... we live to burn!

We got broken bones and broken fists
'n' a lust that doesn't sleep
And in nightly hours with strange powers
the harvest of doom we reap

'Cos WE'RE LIVIN'... We'll live and burn!
'Cos WE'RE LIVIN'... we live to burn!

We got a wild fixation 'n' a morbid fascination
for things that move us in the night
And every time I kill, I get a strange thrill
like lovin' licks from the fire fight

'Cos WE'RE LIVIN'... We'll live and burn!
'Cos WE'RE LIVIN'... we live to burn!

[Solos: Ro]
