We walk those city streets, the wolves in neon light
We're seeking sanctuary from the coming light
White Line Fever
Fuels the rage towards the dawn
'Cos to the night we were born

We prowl the midnight strip, hyenas on the hunt
We're cravin' evermore and just a little
White Line Fever
Race toward the comin' dawn
'Cos to the night we were born

Wolves like witches gather 'neath the dark moon light
Casting spells with distant howls into the night

We walk these city streets, the wolves in neon light
We're seeking sanctuary and the endless night

I heard that vixen speak, she spoke to me in tongues
Howlin' like a wildcat every time she cums
White Line Fever
Bled me dry until the dawn, fires up and pleads for more

Wolves like witches gather 'neath the dark moon light
Casting spells with distant howls into the night

We walk these city streets, the wolves in neon light
We're seeking sanctuary and the endless night
