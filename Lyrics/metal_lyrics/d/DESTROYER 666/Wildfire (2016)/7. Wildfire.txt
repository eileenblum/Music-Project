Ragin' like a hurricane
Neurons firin' through your brain
Feeling I'm electric wired
Movin' like a missile fired

Tempest wind, reapers ride, wild hordes by our side.
Let it loose, light the wild - Wildfire!

Faster than a bloody mace
Devil's speed keepin' pace
Racin' demons crack the whip
Goin' wild, POWER TRIP

Let it loose, light the pyre, let the flames take you higher
Let it loose, light the fire, wild, wild, wildfire

Bring it on like an ax
Comin' down, no way back
Feelin' like you'll lose your head
Bring it on, let it rip

Let it loose, light the pyre, let the flames take you higher
Let it loose, light the fire, wild, wild, wildfire
