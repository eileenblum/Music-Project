"Appear, Appear, whatso thy shape or name
O Mountain Bull, Snake of a Hundred Heads
Lion of the Burning Flame
O God, Beast, Mystery, Come"

Tasting like a serpents kiss
as risen from a Grave - She arises
Mesmerized and sexualized
as though she was saved - She arises

Fear, Fear - Relinquishing all fear
The savage beasts outpouring as the poison takes your care
Lust, Desire - Burning like a fire
Release the inhibition, let the dance take you higher

Tasting like a serpents kiss
as risen from a Grave - She arises
Mesmerized and sexualized
as though she was saved - She arises

[Solos / melodies: K.K., Laurent, Ro]
