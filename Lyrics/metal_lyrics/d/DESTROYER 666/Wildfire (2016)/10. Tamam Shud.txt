When death calls
to snatch you from this world
and as the light fades
how will you look back upon your days?

As the journey ends,
and your mortal coil unfurls
'Neath the drowning waves
how will you look back upon your days?

Well it's a long way home, not far from here
And she will take, she will take me there

I hear her callin' my name, oh it's time to go
And lately I'm feelin' the same, I gotta go
Please take me away, far from the endless rain
There's nothing left that I can say
Please take me away
