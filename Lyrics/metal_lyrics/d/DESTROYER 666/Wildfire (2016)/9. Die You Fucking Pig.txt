I believe in the sacred
the vision divine
the ever eternal
and the god sublime

And I believe in desire
and I believe in lust
and the man forever
trapped by animal past

So praised be to God, and their conviction
I hear the baying howls of the mob
Scream for the blood of witches
Black clad servants, slave to God
Your men pedophiles, our daughters turned to whores

Who shall we blame, for startin' the fire
Who shall we march on to the streets
and hang with piano wire
You ask what I am, well here's what I'm not:
A believer in hope, a savior of souls
(Nor a) disciple of fate, resigned to the fall

Die - You sons of whores
Die - Vile sons of Abraham

[Solos: Ro]
