Prey - free of this world I will hunt
Burn - tearing the iron, clawing and breaking the walls and bars of the
Cage - you trapped me but I did
Escape
Await - the feeling of dread
Dogs lap the blood as the trees
drink the piss of the dead

Traitor - My pelt your blood
Traitor - I never forget a
Traitor
Raising my fist tattooed with the scars of mistakes

Crazed, let his hunger be fed
Death observes without a sound
As the blood seeps underground

Fight - My fangs full of fury you'll
Feel
Burn - Igniting the pyres, fueling the fire.
An ode to the loss and the shame of the glory we
Steal - powered by ravenous hate
Gorging on blood and lust do I thrive
Starving dog running with hunger he learns to survive

[Solos: K.K.]
