I feel - something's not right in my head
I know - must have been something I said
What could be drawing me in
Closer and closer again
All of the visions escape from the holes in my head
Can you - see what I'm trying to say
All my - feelings are turning to gray
The light in the tunnel grows dim
My silver lining has left all these clouds in my head
Watching the thoughts grow in rows in the fields of my mind
Into an ocean of words that I cannot define
I see - must have been something I said
Suddenly everything's clear
All my experience left me with nothing to fear
Won't be long
Won't be long
