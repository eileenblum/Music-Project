It's been a long time since I felt this way
you know I haven't lost my mind
I'm just tired
I see the souls on the street
they're all crying
I'm not trying to be 'cause I'm no better than the dying
no I'm not trying to be the one

[Chorus:]
And when I leave this place
that other realm I'll find
strawberry streams we'll drink from
white frosted clouds we'll sail on
and when I leave this place
that other realm I'll find
sun dripping rainbow colors I'm sailing to

You know I never thought I'd see the loneliness of dying
you know I thought I'd be the one that wasn't fighting
how I wish that I could leave and find a place that's quiet
'cause I truly do believe that someday I will find
deep waters we sail on

No wonder I falter
how does life release this fear
see we can set out on that journey we call life

When my friend comes to call
will I recognize all the things that have been told
will it fill my eyes
when the sun releases me
and the night begins to cradle
all the visions I have seen
guide me into deep waters

[Chorus:]
And when I leave this place
that other realm I'll find
strawberry streams we'll drink from
white frosted clouds we'll sail on
and when I leave this place
soft heathered fields we'll stroll on
sun dripping rainbow colors I'm sailing to

Deep waters
I can't seem to find you - no
I can't seem to find you - no
I can't seem to find you

Deep waters
