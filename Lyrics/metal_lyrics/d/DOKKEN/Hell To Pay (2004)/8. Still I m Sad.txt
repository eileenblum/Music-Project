You were the one on the trigger
Deciding the fate of us all
Testing my fate in religion
Trying to make sense of it all
All hope was lost, I found reason
To look in your eyes and find something

The promise you gave was that you'd remain,
Not leave me here and go missing
I've been the one in the shadows
Watching your life through a window
When you open your eyes and feel me inside you
why would you leave me for others

Wait for me, I'll come for you
Wait for me, can't you see I'm still sad
I'm still I'm sad
All hope was lost, I found reason
To look in your eyes and find something
It's was like two days apart
From the truth
Was my soul the piece you been missing

You've got the gun pull the trigger
Strait to the heart of the matter
If it's all been in vain why do I remain
Watching you leave me for others

Wait for me, I'll come for you
Wait for me, this day is not through
Wait for me, it's about time were through
Wait for me, can't you see I'm still sad
Still I'm sad

Wait for me, I'll come for you
Wait for me, this day is not through
Wait for me, it's about time we through
Wait for me, can't you see I'm still sad
Still I'm sad

Still I'm sad
Still I'm sad
Still I'm sad

Watch your life through your window
Shadows fall
As the darkness falls to gray
