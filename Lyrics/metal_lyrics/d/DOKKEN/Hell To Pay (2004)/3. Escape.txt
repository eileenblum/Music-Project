Turn the lights down low there's nobody home
I've been watchin' for hours the clock on the wall
Seems the hands are frozen they don't move at all
Then the silence breaks as you walk through the door
On an on an on somewhere I don't belong
I'm all out of reasons to stay so I won't
On an on an on it won't leave me alone
Wish that you could remember the time when I said

I can't wait any longer to love you
Turns my reflection away from the day
I can't stand when you're so indecisive
Make up your mind so I can escape

When I hold you close there's nobody home
I can hear every heartbeat whisper and woe
Turn me on with your eyes as I smile right on cue
You rehearse everything that you say an you do
On an on an on you and I don't belong
There's no reason to stay anymore so I won't
On an on an on something's terribly wrong
Wish that you could remember the time that we said

I waited so long I'm going to the other side
I'm losing my mind over you
I've been watchin' for hours the clock on the wall
Seems the hands are frozen they don't move at all
