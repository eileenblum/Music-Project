I walk these streets they built with progress
I search for truth but found no well
And when the sun arises diamonds in the dawn
I look to you but found no one

Back to distant stars where I know you are
I wanna be back home again
To that sacred sun where the sky is warm
I'll be in your arms again

I'll save the last goodbye for you

Under the neon lights in darkness
I found a way to bring you home
I read the words I cannot see why they all follow
It's all just poison for their minds

An as I slip into the madness
The angel spirit cries for me

To that sacred sun where the sky is warm
I'll be in your arms again

I'll save the last goodbye for you
