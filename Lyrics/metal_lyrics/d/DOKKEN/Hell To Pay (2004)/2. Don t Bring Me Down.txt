I played the fool it seems a thousand times before
When I got older thought I've learned my lesson well
Then you came into my life and brought me down
Another lesson towards my fate

I feel like I've been standin' on the sun
Your fire burned my soul like no ones ever done

You can say what you want but don't bring me down
If you want me to play in your garden
Then don't bring me down
Baby if you want my love
Then don't bring me down

Your hyperstatic conversation till the dawn
It makes me tired but I see it turns you on
A tense relationship was all you've ever known
I tried to play but now it cuts me to the bone

I look into your eyes a thousand years away
For my compassion all I got was tears
I feel like I've been standing on the sun
Your fire burned my soul like no one's ever done
