But can I find my way to you?
We've got this everywhere
It's hard to see it through
Time wither like my fingers
I've given everything and more

I can't go on with it in mind
But now we're wrong and out of time
Into your mind
Yes, you'll find
That we were better off before

The sands of time have closed the door
We were better off before
No chance to find a way down
Yes, we were better off before

Time crushing all my soul
A faded picture left of me
Upon the wall
Pain now my only friend
When shadows fall I will remember

The sands of time have closed the door
And left us broken evermore
No chance to find a way down
Yes, we were better off before

[Guitar Solo]

I can't go on with it in mind
But now we're wrong and out of time
Into your mind
Yes, you'll find
That we were better off before

The sands of time have closed the door
We were better off before
No chance to find a way down
Yes, we were better off before

The sands of time have closed the door
And left us broken evermore
No chance to find a way down
Yes, we were better off before
