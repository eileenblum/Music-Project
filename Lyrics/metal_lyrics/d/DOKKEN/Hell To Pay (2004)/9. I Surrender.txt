Leave me here alone.
Lying in the burning sun.
This world has bleached my bones.
I should have taken your advice.

Lying all alone.
Lost to all my memories.
Feeling like a stone.
As the sky above me starts to weep.

The desert falls.
In my mind an endless sea.
I will never know.
What was and that will never be.

Deep within this hole.
Flowers lying on my bed.
Softly as you speak.
Telling me that you've been sad.

Leave me here alone.
Cause I won't be coming back again.
The moments that we own.
Lie scattered in the sand.

I surrender. Surrender
All my love for you.
Please remember. Remember babe.
I'll be there for you.

Leave me here alone.
Cause I won't be coming back again.
The moments that we own.
Lie broken in the hands of time.

I surrender. I Surrender.
All my love for you.
Please remember.Remember.
I'll be there for you.

I surrender. Surrender.
All my love for you.
Please remember.Remember babe.
I'll be there for you.
For you.
