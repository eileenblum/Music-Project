As I walked along the beach last night
Tried to find myself and get it right
If you saw the changes in my eyes
Riding on the wind you know it cries
When you need some one
It's hard to let them go
When you know that their the one
When you feel your hope is gone
Know that I still care for you
Even though your gone
I taste your tears
You think it would have passed
After all these years
Though you find away
Every night I think of you
I hope your sleeping well
When you need some one
When your hearts alone
When you feel your hope is gone
Know that I still care for you
When I feel you close to me
Even though it's just a dream
Please forgive that I still care
When your loneliness is there
I still think of you
Care for you
Waiting for
After all this time has gone
I still feel you in my arms
And when you need some one
Know that I still care for you
As I walked along the beach last night
Tried to find my self and get it right
If you saw the changes in my eyes
Would you come back
