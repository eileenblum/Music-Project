It wasn't just your innocence
No, It wasn't temptation
It was just your own way
Of placing the blame on me

Stop thinking that it's all in vain
You keep trading your love for pain
Someday an answer will come
'Cause there ain't no way to escape

Baby I'm a prisoner
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a prisoner
Chained by love

The answer for your loneliness
Is only frustration
So you gave it all away
By placing the blame on me

Remember how it used to be
You lies won't die that easily
Something's wrong
Why can't you see
There ain't no way to escape

Baby I'm
a prisoner
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a Prisoner
Chained by love
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a Prisoner
Chained by love

Hold my heart in misery
'Cause I'm a prisoner
Did my time so let me be
Let me go
You're holding me

Someday an answer will come your way
Something's wrong
Why can't you see
That there ain't no way to escape
Escape

Baby I'm a prisoner
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a Prisoner
Chained by love
Chained by love
It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a Prisoner
Chained by love
Chained by love

It's so easy to see
I can never be free
I'm a prisoner
Chained by love
