Sick at heart and lonely
Deep in dark despair
Thinking one thought only
Where is she? Tell me where
And if she says to you she don't love me
Just give her my message tell her of my plea
That I know if she'd have me back again
Well I would never make her sad
I got a heart full of soul
She's been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her that I'll be there
And if she says to you
She don't love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea
And I know well if she'd have her back again
Well I would never make her sad
I got a heart full of soul
