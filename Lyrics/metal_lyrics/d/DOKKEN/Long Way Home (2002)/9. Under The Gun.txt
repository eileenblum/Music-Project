So long baby bleed
Had more than enough time to burn it all
Down to the core
Of your bottomless soul
Thought you always wanted to be free

I won't miss you when you're gone
So hard to believe it went on for so long
But I'll carry on without you
Like before

You will have
Your day in the sun
Close your eyes it's gonna burn
Your day in the sun
Will you ever learn?

So long baby blue
Waited so long but you never came through
We dried all your tears
Thought you were the one I could believe in

I won't miss you when I'm gone
It's hard to believe this went on for so long
