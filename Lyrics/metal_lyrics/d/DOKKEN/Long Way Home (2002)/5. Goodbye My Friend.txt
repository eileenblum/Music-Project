I tried to say, didn't love you, or need you
Tried to believe didn't want you too
Same old song, we try to hold on
Still in the end we try to move on

So goodbye my friend
It was good to get to see you again
If this is the end
Please don't try and make me love you again

Tried to believe had an answer too
Wasn't just me that believed in you
As I look back I see what you knew
It's better for me, it's better for you

So good bye my friend
It was good to get to see you again
If this is the end
Please don't try and make me love you again

I was wrong to carry on
Still in the end we try to move on

So goodbye my friend
It was good to get to see you again
If this is the end
Please don't try and make me love you again

if this is the end ..........
