It was late like the storm
Finding it hard tried to carry on
Without fear or the shame
We could walk in park without being afraid

Was a time I believed
As the story unfolded so free
Now the passion is gone
All wrong
Down to the lake moonlit dawn

There was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need
They say that it's starting to show
Should have seen it long ago
There was a time I believed
You were everything I need

As a child
We believed
We could wake from the night and the dawn it seemed
Was so warm
So warm
Into His arms like a child I was born

Was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need

[Interlude]

You took me like the sage
Searching for some absolution
Hard to know the reason nobody cared
Once upon a time

Take me right away
Let me know there's still a season
Let me know there's still a reason to live
I'm running out of time

There was a time I believed
Time would heal everything
Was a time I believed
You were everything I need
They say that it's starting to show
Should have seen it long ago
There was a time I believed
You were everything I need

So now I'm taking a chase of Cavasier
With all of those words that we shouldn't have said
Walking the beach for the last time again
Missing you more than I should
