Let me tell my story
Listen up my friends
It shines in the beginning
We all know how it ends
You throw away your life
No rhyme or reason
You act as though it's you
The one that's bleeding

To me it seems so strange
Nothing's gonna change
I guess everybody
Needs to be with someone

Mother never told you there'd
Be days like this
Lost in your reflection
Brings you happiness
No one understands why you go on
Holdin' on to someone that's not right for you

To me it seems so strange
Nothing's gonna change
I guess everybody needs to be with someone

There's a place in your mind
You can run to and laugh out loud
And it's safe from the nights alone
And it makes you feel everything's
All right for you

I guess everybody needs to be with someone
