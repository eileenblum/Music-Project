The morning rose
You were always kind
Can't believe we've found each other
Waking for the rest of our lives
I believed I'd never find
Someone to believe in
But there you were

When I least expected it
When I'd almost given up
Lost my faith in love
There you were

Tried to hide my feelings still you know
So I guess it's time I finally let it show

I've found someone
Who believes that love's a battle that's been won
Seems a lifetime
Past by
Until I found a reason
Someone to believe in I've found

I thought despair
Was just part of life
But you showed me differently
Smiling full of life as you said
There'll be better days
Just like rain we can't complain
It's OK
There'll be better days

[Chorus]

You and I so different
Seems we're worlds apart
Patience brings us closer we're not far
