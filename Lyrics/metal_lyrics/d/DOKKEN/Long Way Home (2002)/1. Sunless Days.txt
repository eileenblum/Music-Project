You move like fire
You dance like flame
Resurrecting my senses again
Never thought it would end like this
The same as the start of it all
Would someone stop me
My world is spinning
All I want is my day black and white
Can't you see that my heart is bleeding?
Give me reasons
We live in sunless days
No horizon through the storm
Your love I sailed upon
Like a wind to carry us
Starless night from the ashes came
In a daze felt the world was spinning
I never thought it would end like this
The same as the start of it all
All I know is my world is dreaming
All I want is my day black and white
On a sea full of tears I'm riding no horizon
You are so far away
Getting closer
We live in sunless days
No horizon through the storm
Your love I sailed upon
Like a wind to carry us
We live in starless nights
Upon an ocean full of tours
Searching for the day you will return
