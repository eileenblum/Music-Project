Ain't no reason I should stay
something deep inside tells me I should keep a place
I know its hard for you to understand
if I let you go hope you understand

I know how you feel been down that magic road before
But it isn't real what are you lookin' for?

you gave no words to stop the pain
we sight a moment like a grain of sand
I know its hard for you to understand
so many reasons lost within a glance

I know how you feel been down that magic road before
But it isn't real what are you lookin' for?

I know how you feel been down that magic road before
But it isn't real what are you lookin' for?
