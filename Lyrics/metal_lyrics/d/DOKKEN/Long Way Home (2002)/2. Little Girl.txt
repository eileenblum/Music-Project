Mother never told you
That's all right
Don't you cry
Now the visions dance inside your head
What was said?
Go to bed
What have you done
Done to yourself?

What will you do
If I just leave you alone inside little girl?
No where to run
No where to hide except inside little girl

In the tapestries with faded clowns
All year 'round
Bringing you down
Trying to escape in your own ways
Not today
How can you see with your head in the clouds?

What will you do
If I just leave you alone inside little girl?
No where to run
No where to hide except inside little girl

You carry the weight of the world
No one expects you to bear that burden
If you can let it all go
Even the daze will seem so much brighter
Every night holds a surprise for you
