A faded picture from your heart
Was all you left for me
I'm still waiting, stanging here
To see what I could see

Your love i borrowed just like time
It wasn't mine to keep
But the love we shared
I thought was there
And now you have to leave

Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say I'm sorry
But I can't find a way
(To) just walk away

Couldn't see for i was blind
The hurt you hide inside
I didn't mean to break your heart
I wish it had been mine

And as another day unfolds
Don't know what it means 
Was it love we had
Or love gone bad
Still the love we need

Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say I'm sorry
But I can't find a way
(To) just walk away

I'm still standing, waiting here
Waiting for a sign
I didn't mean to break your heart
I wish it had been mine

Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say I'm sorry
But I can't find a way
(To) just walk away

Just walk away
Yeah, walk away
Just walk away...
