Stood On The Edge I Was Lookin Down
Fell A Thousand Times
You Know I Hit The Ground
My Revelation Came Now I'm A Wiser Man
Now I Know Just Who I Am
You Know I've Walked That Road Before
Don't Wanna Walk It Any More
Don't Tell Me That You Love Me
As I'm Walkin Out The Door
I've Heard It All For The Last Time
What A Long Long Road Its Been
Seems It Doesn't Have An End
Does It Really Matter If We Win Or Lose
When The Sadness Lies Within
Livin On The Edge Was My Device
No Matter What I Did Couldn't Get It Right
When All The Madness Came To Life
Still Couldn't Hear Your Sage Advice
You Know I've Walked That Road Before
Don't Wanna Walk It Any More
Don't Tell Me That You Love Me
As I'm Walking Out The Door
I've Heard It All
For The Last Time
