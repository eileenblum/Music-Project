Tried To Shake The Addiction
My Disease And Affliction
The Doors Been Wide Open
Trapped Inside My Own Self
I Feel Like I'm Fallin Again
To-Wards That Cold Rivers Edge
Is It Too Late Will I Go
Over The Waterfall
Never Tried To Forsake You
Be A Jester Or A Muse
Only Wanted Just To Touch You
Now My Feelings Are Confused
It's Hard To Change How I Feel
This Kind Of Love Is Surreal
Your Eyes Say You Want To Break Free
From All Those Past Memories
I Feel Like I'm Fallin Again
To-Wards That Cold Rivers Edge
Is It To Late Will I Go
Over The Water Fall
