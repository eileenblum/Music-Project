Such A Long Road
Iâve Been Travelin
Trying To Find My Way Back Home
Along The Way I Fell Upon Hard Times
Think I Lost My Way
I Was Searchin
For A Love
Guess I'll Keep Looking
For An Answer To It All
Watching The Sunrise
Lying All Alone
Wondering Where Have You Gone
I Know That You Don't Love Me No More
You Know You Got The Best Of Me
And In The End When It's All Said And Done
You'll Know You Got The Best Of Me
In The Darkness
Waiting For The Sun
As I Look Out My Window
A Sea Of Gray Shadows Fall
As I Search For A Way
I Was Searchin For A Love
Guess I'll Keep Lookin For An Answer To It All
Watchin The Sunrise Lyin All Alone
Wonderin Where Have You Gone
I Know That You Don't Love Me No More
You Know You've Got The Best Of Me
And In The End When It's All Said And Done
You'll Know You Got The Best Of Me
Your Were The One That Left Me Here
Now All That's Left Is A Thousand Tears
