I Tried To Offer You Some Peace
But In Return You Gave Me War
Tried To Forgive Let Go The Past
But Your Obsession Brought It Back
And Now Our World Is Upside Down
And Only Blood Lies On The Ground
And In Our Dreams This Life Seems So Very Far Away
From The Light Of Day
And Now I Realize That I'm Not The Only One
I Am Not Lost You Have Become
The Victim Of The Crime
Your Book Of Reason You Believe
It Justifies The Pain You Seek
But In The Pages That I Read
The Sage Cry's Out Forgiveness Please
The Bitter Truth You Are Not Mine
Your Angry Words Die On The Vine
And In Our Dreams This Life Seems So Very Far Away
From The Light Of Day
And Now I Realize That I'm Not The Only One
I Am Not Lost You Have Become
The Victim Of The Crime
I Fell From Grace But Now Its All Just Memories
I Am Not Lost I've Found My Way
And In Our Dreams This Life Seems So Very Far Away
From The Light Of Day
But And Now I Realize That I'm Not The Only One
I Am Not Lost You Have Become
The Victim Of The Crime
And Only Blood Lies On The Ground
And In Our Dreams This Life Seems So Very Far Away
From The Light Of Day
And Now I Realize That I'm Not The Only One
I Am Not Lost You Have Become
The Victim Of The Crime
Your Book Of Reason You Believe
It Justifies The Pain You Seek
But In The Pages That I Read
The Sage Cry's Out Forgiveness Please
The Bitter Truth You Are Not Mine
Your Angry Words Die On The Vine
And In Our Dreams This Life Seems So Very Far Away
From The Light Of Day
And Now I Realize That I'm Not The Only One
I Am Not Lost You Have Become
The Victim Of The Crime
I Fell From Grace But Now Its All Just Memories
I Am Not Lost I've Found My Way
And In Our Dreams This Life Seems So Very Far Away
From The Light Of Day
But And Now I Realize That I'm Not The Only One
I Am Not Lost You Have Become The Victim Of The Crime
