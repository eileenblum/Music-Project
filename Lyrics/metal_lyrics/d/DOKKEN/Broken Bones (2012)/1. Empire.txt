I Stood Alone And Watched Below
As They Burned Their Cities Down
The Fire And The Rage I See
A Prophet Never Found
A Thousand Years- Still Nothing Learned
The Prophets Speak Their Words
Now Nothin Left
But Ashes On The Ground
What Will You Rule In The End
A Burnin Empire
Do You Believe When Blood Is Lost
That It Justifies The Means?
A Child Only Sees The Gun
As The Trigger Of Disease

A Thousand Years Still Nothin Learned
The Prophets Speak Their Words
Now Nothing Left
But Ashes On The Ground
What Will You Rule In The End
A Burnin Empire
