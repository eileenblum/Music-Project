I Heard The News Today
That You Had Found The One
It Said Your Happiness
Was All But Said And Done
Your Secret Was Revealed
That's How They Won Your Heart
A Room Of Pearls And Jewels
Was Only Just The Start
Now I Realize
I've Walked This Road Before
Never To Return
Don't Need You Anymore
Tonight When I Close My Eyes
Will I See You Anymore
And I Will Keep These Memories Alive
When I Close My Eyes Tonight
The Song You Sing It Rings Or Truth To Idol Eyes
The Game You Play Is Hidden Deep Within Your Eyes
Your Gentle Lips A Poison Kiss Brought Kingdoms Down
And Now You Sit Upon Your Throne From Underground
Now I Realize
I've Walked This Road Before
Never To Return
Don't Need You Anymore
Tonight When I Close My Eyes
Will I See You Anymore
And I Will Keep These Memories Alive
When I Close My Eyes Tonight
