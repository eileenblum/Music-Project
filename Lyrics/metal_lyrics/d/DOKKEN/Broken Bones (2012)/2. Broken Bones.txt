I Lie Awake As The Shadows Fall On Your Face
And I Wonder Are Your Sleepin All Alone
As I Miss You More And More
The Shadows Of My Dreams Have Been Shakin
As This Loneliness It Wraps Around My Soul
The Shadows Of My Dreams All Mistakin
Now I Realize Baby I'm The Fool
Still These Broken Bones Within My Soul Remain
Even Though Your Shadow Slowly Slips Away
Maybe Someday I Can Finally Find A Reason
Why These Broken Bones Within My Soul Remain
All Of The Times I Waited For You
Thinking That Your Waitin To
They Say The Blind Man Sees But Feels Nothin
Until His Loneliness Reveals The Truth
All These Bones That Lie Within My Spirit
Broken Just Like Me
Wish This Sorrow That Surrounds Me Could Release Me
May He Love You More Than Me
Still These Broken Bones Within My Soul Remain
Even Though Your Shadow Slowly Slips Away
Maybe Someday I Will Finally Know The Reason
Why These Broken Bones Within My Soul Remain
I've Been Tryin To Find A Reason
For This Emptiness And Pain
Still These Broken Bones Within My Soul Remain
