I See Your Face
In The Distant Sun
Bitter Winds Of Change
Watch Me Growing Old
My Long Awaited Love
I Hope That You Return
Can You Find Your Way To Me
Through These Passing Years
Thoughts Of You Are Callin
I Can Feel You Fallin
They Say What's Done Is Done
When There's Nothin Left To Lose
Nothin Left To Lose
Leave The Past Behind
And All Those Wasted Years
It's Hard To See The World
Through Those Burnin Tears
Leave With No Regret
No Bitterness To Feel
All That You Have Left
Is Waiting In The Fields
Broken We All Are
But Somehow We Survive
Rise Up From Your Loneliness
And Cast Away Your Fears
Thoughts Of You Are Callin
I Can Feel You Fallin
They Say What's Done Is Done
When There's Nothin Left To Lose
Nothin Left To Lose
Leave The Past Behind
And All Those Wasted Years
It's Hard To See The World
Thru Those Burnin Tears
No Bitterness To Feel
All That You Have Left
Is Waiting In The Fields
Broken We All Are
But Somehow We Survive
Rise Up From Your Loneliness
And Cast Away Your Fears
Thoughts Of You Are Callin
I Can Feel You Fallin
They Say What's Done Is Done
When There's Nothin Left To Lose
Nothin Left To Lose
Leave The Past Behind
And All Those Wasted Years
It's Hard To See The World
Thru Those Burnin Tears
