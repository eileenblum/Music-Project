Sweet Little Sister
What Have You Done
My Sweet Little Sister
Are You Still On The Run
I Wanna Save You
But Your Hearts In His Hands
I Wanna Take You To Another Land

I Know It 's Not For Me To Say My Love
Your Life Is Your Own
Don't Let It Fade Away

My Little Darlin
How Did You Lose Your Way
Like An Illusion
What Can I Say
And In A Sense So Real
But It's Startin To Fade
I Taste Your Tears
Like A Bitter Rain

I Know It's Not For Me To Say My Love
Your Life Is Your Own
Don't Let It Fade Away
Fade Away Fade Away
Your Not An Illusion
Don't Let It Fade Away
