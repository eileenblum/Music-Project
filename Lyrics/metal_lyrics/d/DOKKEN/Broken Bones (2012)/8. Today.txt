Today I Feel Like Pleasing You
More Than Before
Today I Know What I Wanna Do
But I Don't Know What For
To Be Living For You
Is All I Want To Do
To Be Loving It'll All Be There
When My Dreams Come True
Today You'll Make Me Say That I
Somehow Have Changed
Today You Look Into My Eyes
I'm Just Not The Same
To Be Anymore Than All I Am
Would Be A Lie I'm So Full Of Love
I Could Burst Apart And Start To Cry
Today Everything You Want I Swear
It All Will Come True
Today I Realize How Much
I'm In Love With You
With You Standing Here
I Could Tell The World

What It Means To Love
To Go On From Here I Can't Use Words
They Don't Say Enough
Please Please Listen To Me
It's Takin So Long To Come True
And Its All For You
All For You
You Look Into My Eyes
I'm Just Not The Same
Everything You Want I Swear
It All Will Come True
I'm So Full Of Love I Could Burst Apart
Start To Cry
