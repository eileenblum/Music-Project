Sometimes long roads
We must travel on
It's not easy
When we walk alone
Always searchin'
To see the sun
Then your bright eyes
Bring me back home

Sometimes it's hard to see the sky
Now I know the reason why
You are my oasis
My calm within the storm
You are my oasis
Always leading me back home
When I miss you
Into the day
One more reason
To keep the faith
Give me patience
Waiting for you
Till that moment
I'll be there for you

You are my oasis
My calm within the storm
You are my oasis
Always leading me back home
