On and on we go again
There seems no point of view
Over under upside down
I don't know what to do
There used to be passion
Don't know when it slipped away
I look around at everyone
It happens every day
I need to get off this spinnin' merry-go-round
I'm upside down

No sense in talkin' till the morning comes
I need to feel it once again

This fire is dyin'
I can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
This fire is dyin'
I can't feel the passion that we had before
Anymore

Contradiction, trepidation, different points of view
Sitting in a place I said I'd never go with you
Given half a chance I guess I'd throw it all away
My opinion doesn't matter when there's shades of gray
I need to know what you're lookin' fore

No sense in talkin' till the morning comes
I need to feel it once again

This fire is dyin'
I can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
This fire is dyin'
I can't feel the passion that we had before
Anymore

I need the passion to live my life
Live my dreams the way I like
Give no reasons for what I have
I tried to love you
The best I can

This fire is dyin'
I can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
This fire is dyin'
I can't feel the passion that we had before
Anymore
