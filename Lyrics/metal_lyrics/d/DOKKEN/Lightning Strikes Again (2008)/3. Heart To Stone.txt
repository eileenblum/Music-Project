I can't see your face anymore
through our broken past
I can't feel your pain anymore
I am free at last

this love is lost like a distant sun
in an endless sea
I tried to spread my wings and fly
nothing's left of me

I can't feel this love anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this pain anymore
you turned a heart to stone

I can't feel your touch anymore
though you're next to me
can't taste the tears anymore
fit of misery

our day is lost like a setting sun
that's all right by me
I gave my soul and you won't give it back
what do you want from me

I can't feel this love anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this pain anymore
you turned a heart to stone

I just can't believe
that I'm feeling this way
I finally see
this love just can't be saved

[solo]

I can't feel this love anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this pain anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this love anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this pain anymore
you turned a heart to stone

you turn (you turn)
the heart to stone (the heart to stone)
you turn (you turn)
the heart to stone
you turn a heart...
you turn the heart to stone
