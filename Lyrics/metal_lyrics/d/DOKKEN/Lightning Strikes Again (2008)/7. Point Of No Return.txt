Lost in a world that only criticizes all of my sins
Who are they to say they understand
The way that I've had to live
There was a day that we could live or die upon the sword
Of all the words we've spoken
Such a tragedy to everyone and so much more

I need to know
Are we livin' in a picture show
That these feelings that we feel are black and white

I feel that I'm comin' to the point of no return
The pyre that will show us the way
The point of no return
The vision that releases all our pain

Cast down your promises
The revolutions that I should believe
As you touch the tender face of innocence
Not mutually agreed
Send me conviction promise that all the words you say
Come from the other side
Written down only yesterday

I need to know
Are we livin' in a picture show
That these feelings that we feel are black and white

I feel that I'm comin' to the point of no return
The pyre that will show us the way
The point of no return
The vision that releases all our pain

Save me give back my soul
Hopeless world guess that I'll never know
So long into the abyss
I give myself into the point

The point of no return
The pyre that will show us the way
The point of no return
The vision that releases all our pain
