Say a prayer, for the day, that you first began
all the lies, broken truth, they don't understand
mesmerized by the world if they only knew
you kept your soul in a place that was safe for you

what will you say
when the angels come for you
what will you say
on judgement day

don't want to live without you
you are my world, you are my life
don't wanna be without you
on judegment day

touch your heart, take it out, so they all can see
now exposed to the fate of your misery
I'll sedate all the fears that you say are true
now exposed to the ones that don't care for you

what will you say
when the angels come for you
what will you say
on judgement day

don't want to live without you
you are my world, you are my life
don't wanna be without you
on judgement day

[solo]

what will you say
when the angels come for you
what will you say
on judgement day

don't want to live without you
you are my world, you are my life
don't wanna be without you
on judgement day
don't want to live without you
you are my world, you are my life
don't wanna be without you
on judgement day

[end solo]
