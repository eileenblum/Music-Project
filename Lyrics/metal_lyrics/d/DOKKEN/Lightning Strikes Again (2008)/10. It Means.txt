I've been wasting away
Waiting for you, you
All the things that you say but never do, you
Gotta stay away from the light
Gotta save what's left of my life
Even if it means without you

I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me
I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me

How can this love prevail so hard to tell it's been surreal
Still it's hard to let go after the show
Gotta save what's left of my life
Gotta save what's left of my life

I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me
I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me

I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me
I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me

Gotta stay away from the light
Gotta save what's left of my life
Even if it means without you
Even if it means without you
It means when I'm without you
