I've had enough
Livin' on the outside
It's harder every day
I feel I'm fallin'
Into the emptiness
I'm tired of livin' in pain

I stand in this lonely place
I try to survive

Give me a reason
To say I love you
Give me a reason
To show I care
Give me a reason
To keep on lovin' you
Give me a reason

Wasted days and nights
Fallen from your lips
Bleedin' through my every vein
You know it's hard enough
Tryin' to survive
You seem to think it's a game
A poison arrow
Straight through my heart
You know your aim was so true
I feel I'm fallin'
Into the emptiness
There's nothing more I can do

I stand in this lonely place
You know it's hard to survive

Give me a reason
To say I love you
Give me a reason
To show I care
Give me a reason
To keep on lovin' you
Give me a reason
