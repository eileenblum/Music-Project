There was a time when our hearts were one
Almost lost you somewhere in the storm
Wings of passion cold and hard to bear
I remember you were standin' there

As we look to the sky
Watching love pass us by
One more time we try to catch a ride
In our hearts there is a dream
Sometimes lost so it seems
Don't let love pass us by this time

I remember the tears of joy we shared
In the darkness when I held you oh so near
Like a dream I have lost you with the dawn
In the fields standing there alone
Searching for home

As we look to the sky
Watching love pass us by
One more time we try to catch a ride
In our hearts there is a dream
Sometimes lost so it seems
Don't let love pass us by this time

Searching for love
Sometimes so hard to see
Searching for love
Sometimes lost in our dreams

As we look to the sky
Watching love pass us by
One more time we try to catch a ride
In our hearts there is a dream
Sometimes lost so it seems
Don't let love pass us by this time
