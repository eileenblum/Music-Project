You knew there'd be consequences,
when I gave you the keys to my heart.
You knew that I had intentions,
and you knew it right from the start.

Give me one more day.
I'll give ya reason to stay
I wanna make you see, but you don't listen to me.
I'm trying to find a way.

I feel you inside, while I'm standing on the outside
I feel you inside, while I'm standing on the outside
Standing on the outside
Looking in.

I gave what you said you needed.
Then you called me and asked for more.
I'm sinkin down so deep, but I just can't reach,
Tell me what I'm fighting for.
I'm feeling upside down.
Headed for the ground.
If you could only see, it should be you and me
flying at the speed of sound.

I feel you inside, while I'm standing on the outside
I feel you inside, while I'm standing on the outside
Standing on the outside
Looking in.

I feel you inside, while I'm standing on the outside
I feel you inside, while I'm standing on the outside
I feel you inside, while I'm standing on the outside
Standing on the outside
Looking in.
