You needed love
So now I'm back
Rollin' the dice
Could leave you flat
I win, you lose
You're in trouble
'Cause I'm back

I'll set you straight
You know that I've got somethin'
I can give to you
And I'll give it to you
Face to face
Now I'm gonna show you
What you've got to lose
When I give it to you

Can't keep waitin' for you
All night, all night
You're in trouble

'Cause I'm back
Back for the attack
Now I'm back
'Cause you could not let me go
Back for the attack

Easy lovin'
It will be as easy
As you thought it would be
When you give it to me
All or nothin'
Cards are on the table
No one plays for free
It's just you and me

Can't keep waitin' for you
All night, all night
You're in trouble

'Cause I'm back
Back for the attack
Now I'm back
'Cause you could not let me go
I'm back
Back for the attack
Now I'm back
You're in trouble
Back for the attack

I'm back
Back for the attack
Now I'm back
'Cause you could not let me go
Now I'm back
Back for the attack
I'm back
You're in trouble

'Cause I'm back
Back for the attack
Now I'm back
And I'm gonna set you straight
'Cause I'm back
Back for that attack
I'm back
You're in trouble
Back for the attack
