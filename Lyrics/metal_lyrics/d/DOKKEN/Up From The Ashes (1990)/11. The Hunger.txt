[Dokken, White]

What's wrong with you may be right for me
Don't need to feel your sympathy, no
In the dark
I feel at home
I need the night to make my feelings known

Alright like lone wolf, can't you see
Living in false realities
Do you know just how I feel, can't explain it,
but its real

Lost in a world full of fear, it gives me passion
I'm just a lone wolf who's waiting
Waiting for life's attraction to give me

[1st CHORUS:]
The hunger...burning in my soul
With the hunger...everybody knows
It's the hunger to give me what I need
With the hunger...satisfaction guaranteed

Blackened sky on a full moon rise
Destiny, it calls to me
Some call it love, some call it more
I'll play that game if it gets me through the door

Alright like lone wolf, can't you see
Living in false realities
Do you know just how I feel, can't explain it,
but its real

Lost in a world full of fear, it gives me passion
I'm just a lone wolf who's waiting
Waiting for life's attraction to give me

[2nd CHORUS:]
The hunger...burning in my soul
With the hunger...everybody knows
It's the hunger to give me what I need
With the hunger..take a walk with me

[BRIDGE]

In the night I call your name
As we stop to play the game
It is it love or fantasy
Living false realities

[SOLO]
[1st CHORUS]

The Hunger [3X]
It's the hunger....
