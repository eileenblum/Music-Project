[Dokken, White]

It's my heart feeling heavy
Down about the way that you treat me
Is your love still on fire
Show that your touch has desire

If I give you all I need
Would you still be there for me
I don't think so...no, no, no

I can't wait any longer
Can't you see that I feel like I'm going

[1st CHORUS:]
Down in flames...You're taking control
Of my heart and I'm going
Down in Flames...straight to the ground over you.

Must I be so mistreated
Now there's no more to be foregiven
I can't play any longer
Time that I became just a wanderer

Had you said you'd really cared
Don't you know that I'd be there
I don't think so...no, no, no
I can't wait any longer
Can't you see that I feel like I'm going

[2nd CHORUS:]
Down in flames...You're taking control
Of my heart and I'm going
Down in Flames...straight to the ground over you.
Down in flames...You're taking control
Of my heart and I'm going
Down in Flames...straight to the ground over you.

[SOLO]
[BRIDGE]

Send back my heart, give me control
Must I be so mistreated, there's no win or lose
I guess I'm goin'

[2nd CHORUS]

I guess I'm goin'
