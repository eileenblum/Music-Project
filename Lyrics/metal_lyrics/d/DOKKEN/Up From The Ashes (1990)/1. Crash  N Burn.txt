[White, Dokken]

I considered all the chances that were mine
I believed they'd find solutions just in time
I believed they had more answers than I'd heard
The angels sing a different song

Strangers all around us, "Trust in me " they say
"We have got the answers, to save the world today."

I considered all the things they said.
Paper plans drawn out but never read
To save us from our darkest fears
We close our eyes and trust that time will find a way
How we trusted in you, no one knows for sure
Still its all but over, sailing on a ship of fools

[CHORUS:]
Crash 'N Burn..To live again
Up from the ashes I rise
What was clear, the tragedy
Took all my chances away

Crash 'N Burn...To live again
Up from the ashes I rise
Only to find its a lie

Listening to the radio, it seemed to me
Prophets selling fast cars and a dream
Send your money to us right away
There's a seat reserved for you
At the holy altar
You can live for free
In the name of his name
For eternity

[CHORUS]
[BRIDGE]

Too many words have been spoken
So many people divine
Too many questions rise from my heart
Answers I may never find... before I

[CHORUS]
