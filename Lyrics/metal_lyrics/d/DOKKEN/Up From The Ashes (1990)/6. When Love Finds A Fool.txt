[Dokken, Hughes]

I could've told you
All these tears, what good to they do
All these years my life's been living
It's a shame you've not been giving

So tell me what to do
And I'll be there for you, only for you

[CHORUS:]

When love finds a fool like me, it doesn't see
When love finds a fool, baby, like me
I could've been the one

Sad empty faces look to my eyes
They seem to know me
I can take the rejection
All I need is your affection

I should've seen it coming
You should've said 'goodbye'
I guess you were right

[CHORUS]
[SOLO]
[CHORUS]
