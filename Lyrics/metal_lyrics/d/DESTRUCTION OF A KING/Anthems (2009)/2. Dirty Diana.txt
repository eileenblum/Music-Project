What!!!

I got a story of a girl I know
At a time in my life where I felt so low
So confused, and what little I knew
My endless nights at De Ja Vu.

I threw my 20's at her left and right
I asked what is your name
She said Diana and welcome to my game
Welcome to my game

She grabbed my hand and took me back
To the place where my life came under attack
Held me down, did what she should
But I stepped it up because I knew I could

I made Diana go OH!!!

Now she's down, my fingers on her spine
She jerked me off, it felt so divine

My lips could not resist those luscious tits
With my dick rubbing on her clit

All of this was a fuckin mistake
That i took to far when I raised the stakes
Lost all respect and faith in myself
To the band, I came for help

I came clean for the things that I've done
All this time I thought it was so much fucking fun
Drugs and booze, and the late night shows
In the end all I wanted was love and home

Dirty Diana, what the fuck did you do to me
Dirty Diana, now I can Truly see

Your just a fucking slut

This concludes my fucked up past
It's something in my mind

That will always last...
