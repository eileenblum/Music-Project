Here I go
Watch me fall

I got the strength within to carry me through this
I wont let my life fall through the cracks of eternal bliss

I wont let my life fall through the cracks of eternal bliss
because i got the strength within

Ya I got the strength within to carry me through this

Throw your hands up and shout it out
Cuz i just can't get enough

C'mon everybody get with it like
Whoa
True Times to fucking legit
Whoa

You can't pass it up kid cuz its the drug you refuse to choose
Don't be afraid to fail because you will always prevail

What do I got to do
To show you it's the truth
You hate
Cover your lie

Put your hands up!

True times, nothing but straight clean fun
X X X, and I'm still not done
You hold it till you die
Happiness fills your soul
Honesty and all

True times
It's not a fucking lie

Boom
I'm coming at you like fucking
Boom
