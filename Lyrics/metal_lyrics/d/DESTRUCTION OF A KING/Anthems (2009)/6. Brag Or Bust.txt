And you think you got it all you little fuck
you've done nothing but brag or bust

I don't care what you need or what you say
I don't care you walk with all this glee
I'm like oh! You think your so fucking cool
From your diamond cut neck down to your suede shoes

I don't care what you need or what you got
You, you think you've got it good
You, break down, you cry a little bit
Lets make this last

I don't care you succeed with no try
Like a bride, true belief and your running
Bye...You'll never die

Don't temp me you little fuck
Oh?
And you think you've got it all
your just a little fuck
