This is the anthem of our time!
Anthem of our time

Pick it up!
I can't tell you how tired I am of your shit

You think your words can get to me
But your just wasting your time can't you see
I just don't give a fuck
I just don't give a fuck

Say what you want
Its fine with me
I know your just trying to be
Like everyone else
Like everyone else

You seem to think
That your setting yourself apart from the rest
But it seems to me

Its time for you to turn a new leaf
And be the person that you want to be
You just have to understand
Straight up

Takes those words to heart
Lets make a brand new start
Lets make our true colors show
Let them know what sets us apart [x2]

We will stand by our word
You will never bring us down [x6]

This is the anthem of our time!!!
Lets make this the anthem of our generation
Lets make this the anthem of our time
