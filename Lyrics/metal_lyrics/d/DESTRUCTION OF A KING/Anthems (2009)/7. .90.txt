This song goes out to all the kids who had trouble in life
Whether it was anger issues, your parents divorcing, drug and alcohol problems, or even losing the ones you love

I'm here to say it's gonna be okay...

Your objective is to stay positive and strong
Wipe those tears away and let them be gone

I promise I'll always be there
By your side

You don't need to be scared
Theres no need to hide

Everyone turn to your side

And come alive [x2]
Come alive [x2]

Come alive!
Time to rise!

Oh
My God
Oh my God
I trust all these words
That you fucking speak
From your fucking mouth

Let me rescue you
From all the troubles you've been through

I can't tell you how to live your life
All i can do is give you a word of advice

Maybe you thought of once ending it all
Just like me
I can see the true pain in your eyes

This song goes out to all the kids
Who had trouble in their life

Like I said
It can be any issue
That you have faced
anger issues, your parents divorcing, drug and alcohol, or losing ones you love

Your objective is to stay positive and strong
Wipe those tears away and let them be gone
I promise I'll always be there by your side
You don't need to be scared
There's no need to hide
I'm Right Here
