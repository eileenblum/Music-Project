One fifteen a shooting star, my urges so deep to take my life far. I never knew that you could come at me, looking like you do, like you do. I never knew, it would hit me emotionally, Put my body at its peace. Oh yeah, c'mon, you had it going on, Oh yeah c'mon. I knew this feeling I had was not wrong. We're gonna sing this song, we're gonna chant it long, Get on your mark, Ready, set, go. And it was love. It was love. I felt love for the very first time; it gave me chills up and down my spine. I felt love for the very first time; it hit my life when I needed my prime. Now I know what it feels like to cry, Open eyes and I realize. My life is no longer done, And now I know, it was love. It was love..
