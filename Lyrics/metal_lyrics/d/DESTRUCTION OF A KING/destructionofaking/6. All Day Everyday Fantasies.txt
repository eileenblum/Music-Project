Sitting here under a tree, compose my thoughts to satisfy me. I asked her to touch, to wrap her lips around it, But she said, "I'm not just another slut!" I see these girls, these fucking girls, and I cannot control my confidential mind. I want to lay her down and show her what I'm about, Let us start by playing and let me start by saying. I want to hold her by the hips and start with a tender kiss. I hit them digits one by one. I got that curvy body laying and ready, let's take this fast, let's take this slow. Hot and heavy, fuck. Make that pussy wet and make that pussy cum, until it's all on my cock and I'm still not done. And I'm still not done. Feed my addiction because I'm fucking it like the rest, I'm fucking like the rest.
