Listen here, it kills my veins. Want to escape, these fucking chains. Strangle my throat, destroy my veins. Break yourself, let's go. Hate yourself, let's go. I twist and turn and nobody seems to give, that my mind and my fate are coordinately corrupted. Let me break it down to you, let me break it down to you. My life was red, but now it's blue. You hold me to the ground, and I can't seem to make a sound. I break through, and I'm playing your game, No longer do these chains have me restrained. You can run, but I will find you. On your knees, crawling back to me. I've made the choice. I'm restrained. I will expand my horizons..
