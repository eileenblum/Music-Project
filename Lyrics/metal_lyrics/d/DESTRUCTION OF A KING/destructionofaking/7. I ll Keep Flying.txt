I never knew I could fly so high, Emotions reign down my face with a much needed cry. The trees swayed left and right, some so gentle and some with fight. This is a timeline of my life. The dream is in hype. I soar below to land where I know, I will fly and yes I will fly. Who's always been there, from the touch and smell to the dark brown hair. She's never lead me to die, but the encouragement to try. I've never done so wrong, knowing by my side I have my mom. I never knew I could fly so high, touch the sky. I'll touch the sky. I will take flight..
