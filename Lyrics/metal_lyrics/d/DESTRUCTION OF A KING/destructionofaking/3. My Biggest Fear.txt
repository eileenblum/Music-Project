Oh my god look at this mess here, I just walked into my biggest fear. I never knew it could be so much fun, Doing your body and getting my fix done. I rolled the condom down and what did I see, a filthy fucking slut, lying in front of me, and I'm gone. You took it away. I got the text you had confessed, this was killing me. I'm not the best; I'm just like the rest. She had confessed. My life has lead, to these three words, Baby I'm dead. My big fear is nowhere near. I never knew you could rock my body so fucking hard. When you spread you legs and everything went too far, it went too far..
