Inside my mind, what can you see? I ask myself, what will bring me to sanity. I don't know, and I don't know. Someone please help me. I swear to god, I want to take a gun and load sick, Put it in my mouth and watch my head split. Like boom. Voices in my head. Help me put this to end, Oh. They never stop and I said they never stop. I feel my body shut down, and watch my eyes close, enter my world that I've never known. My mind's corrupt, but I can't get enough. Now let me ask you, is that too much? I'm in a corrupted state of mind..
