When I see the light,
I wake up and I begin to feel

It's the pain on my flesh
By all pleasure I gave
They're the entrails inside of me
Which lodge a thousand men

I sometimes think
That this is not happening,
Hoping to wake up of this dream
My life is shit,
An eternal dream of pain

Confused solitude

There's nobody around me
My body is bleeding...

Pain! Pleasure!
The dying whore!

A shadow at the door
I start to bleed again
It's coming, it's coming

The shadow is over me
I can't move,
The shadow inside,
Inside of me...
