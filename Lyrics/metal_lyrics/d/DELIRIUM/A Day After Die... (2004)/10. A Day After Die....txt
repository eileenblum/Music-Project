I feel get my feelings rid
Of my me slowly...
The rain fall down from the faces
Filling up my heart with grief

Waiting to heal my wounds
With the passing of time

Like the withered leaf
Which fall from the autumn trees
One second is too much
For the instinct of love

Freezing, waiting the cold wind
Tear it up slowly
Freezing, alone,
Feel now the time fade

Every second in this winter place
It's a crevice in my heart
All that surrounds me has become so sad
The reason to live just has gone off my mind
My empty hands are waiting you...

The time is going on
The life too and I just lie,
Alone in my grave
To me, the world just
Becomes so heavy, so sad

Now, I just have to close
My eyes and forget that...
I lived a tale who nobody wrote

And I die...
