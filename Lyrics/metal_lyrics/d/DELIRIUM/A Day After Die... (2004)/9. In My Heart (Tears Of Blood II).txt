Every sight in thine
Makes my love fall
In the deepest feelings of my soul

(Thy beauty face full of grace
Thy soft and white skin
Thy sorrow and tenderness
Thy beauty is seems like an angel)

If only thou could be mine
I engrave my ire on the ice
And I shall wait the sunset
And I would shade my tears
On the roses of thy heart
Just to feel the pain of thy thorns
And the inwounded kiss of thy petals

(Oh, if only thou know it...
The evil love which I shade to thee
It's martiryum that embrace me
All the nights and days)

(The consolation, is the delicious
One poison which I taste of thee
That makes my dreams so ethereal and celestial)

The rain appears on my eyes
Because I know I've fallen from the Paradise
The Paradise thou brought me
With thy sights, with thy smile,
With thy evilness and... with thy pain!

I tear the stars because they shine my tragedy
Because thou don't lie with me...

All the silence and all the pain
Is carven in my heart...
