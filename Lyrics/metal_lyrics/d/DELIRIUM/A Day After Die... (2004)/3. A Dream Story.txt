The image of an artist
Agony in the air...

The sigh in your ear,
Of somebody that you don't know
It's the most melancholic thing
That could happen [to] you

The music didn't alleviate my pain
Only your memory kept me alive

A poem, a thought, an idea
A captured feeling in a paper
It's the only thing that I have

Perhaps I won't feel
The rose of a strange skin
And the worst thing is
That the time never stops

The euphoria and the sadness
One after another, death
I'll close my eyes and
I allow to run the time...
