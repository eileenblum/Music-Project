"A pure race of warriors and wises
Together in soul mind and heart"

Prepared for war
With arms in our hands
And the truth in our worlds
Covering the land
With the enemy's blood

Warriors are prepared
Prepared for war...
The warriors are screaming
Screaming revenge... War!!

Priest come true
The divine sacrifice
Drinking your blood
Eating your heart

The heads of the enemy
Are in field of the battle
We want your blood,
Blood and pain...

The warriors are waiting
Waiting for revenge
And screaming together

This is Mexican fucking rules!!
