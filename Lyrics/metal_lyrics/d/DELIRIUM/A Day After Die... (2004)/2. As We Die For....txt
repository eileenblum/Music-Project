The time to consumed
The forces to live
Living each and every day
And I don't know...
(What's the meaning of life)

My heart and my thoughts
Are stronger than this existence
Without something believe in
Just in me...

"As we die in the rain
That runs out of my eyes
As we die in the dark
That comes out of my heart"
