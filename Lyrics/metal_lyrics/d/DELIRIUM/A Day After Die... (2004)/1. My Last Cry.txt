The storm ends up
The last drop falls
I remember the pain
Of my thought...

My hair is wet with each
Drop of that farewell

Without remorse
That it's the last
And my void nobody can fill

When storm begins
I won't be here
You are waiting for me
I won't return

My last cry
My last tear
My last feeling
My last life

My last fucking life...
