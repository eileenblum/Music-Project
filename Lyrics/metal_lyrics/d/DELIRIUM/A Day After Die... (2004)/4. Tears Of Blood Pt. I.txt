The melancholy comes with me
My heart just keeps on crying
Crying tears of blood
In my heart...

I remember everything
Her eyes, her mouth, her scent
A silence on the air
I remember melancholy
Her trembling body
And her empty hands

The clock continues its course

I never knew why,
Why you take her away

Everyday is endless
My tears are sorrow
I won't be without you
Tears of blood in my heart

I'm alone in my room
Listening to this song
Trying to forget you

I remember that day
You told me a pact of love
Will close our love

My only one love,
I want to see you again
To be together
And never fall apart
