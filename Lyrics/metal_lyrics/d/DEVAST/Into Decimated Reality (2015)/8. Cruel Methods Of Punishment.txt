enhancing a body showing disposal of artifacts
begotten to get rid of flesh and blood reactions rejoice
the malefic will while the manic procedure determines the instance
the urge of physical affliction surges like a goal fulfilled
hatred projected punishment possession
to blunt to traumatize smashing flesh in diverse ways
bestial possession unleashed peeling skin while hitting
engaged in an abhorrent ritual of torture carnage, ceremony
