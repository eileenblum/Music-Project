state of absolute torment exalted into scorched wasteland the earth have been turned. Fog of ashes and mist of smoke, remaining humans like strive for salvation, but on a foul intent against the monstrous destruction, chaos agents defeating all hope of sense of survival the Abominations are dealing the final giant creatures with insectoid form producing the utter mass disruption they annihilate all of the surface leaving all life living like plague this is an apocalyptic nightmare humans be devoured like cockroaches the terror atmosphere leads them to perform their mass genocide
