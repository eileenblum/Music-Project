cursed to be caged in an abhorrent place so dark so deep sunlight never been seen only choices are to yell and scream viciously releasing all sense of hope conceived this cruel by ones hatred decided still the victim can't tell its half of the surprise condemned to madness then condemned to die mind crushed in the reality of the dungeon naive focus on a salvation brings suspense and a psychotic behavior until the redeemer appears with its tools end of the hallway interesting shadow sound of sharpness and metal choke my salvation the the victim starts to accept my intentions the first impalement assures there's no escaping given up to imagine mercy but mistaken the removal of guts what keeps me on endless pain and suffering I know slaughtered every part of mind and body sentence given and fulfilled now enjoy and rot
