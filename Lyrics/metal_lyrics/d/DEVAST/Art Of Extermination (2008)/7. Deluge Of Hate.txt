Putrid faces of humanity enslaved by the primal rage
Sadistic desire of internal torment
A tsunami of evil crash down on the coward faces
New places of hell on earth took place at our banished land
Deluge of hate deluge of hate deluge of hate
Insanity through the earth performed by weak human thoughts
The devilish talent of Satan
Lost in the spheres of hidden thought
The hate in reaction with an artificial brain of lust
Deluge of hate deluge of hate deluge of hate
My internal specter bound by blood with the infernal specters
My fatal hell-spirit will bombard the vanquishers of luminescence
Deluge of hate deluge of hate deluge of hate
