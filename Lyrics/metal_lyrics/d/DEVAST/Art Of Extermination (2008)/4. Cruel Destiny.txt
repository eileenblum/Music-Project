Multitude of emotions invade my mind
Vengeance in my existence I cant live without it
No mercy no amnesty no excuse
This is my black my sweet my cruel destiny
Cruel destiny born to kill living with death
Red is the color of my eyes the black is my soul
Carnage massacre savage hellish extermination
My cruel destiny my black destiny
