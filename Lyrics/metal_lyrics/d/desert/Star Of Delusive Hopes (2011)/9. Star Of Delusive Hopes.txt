[Music: M.Shafranski/Lyrics: A.Raymar]

Smoke of Waterloo scattering dreams and hopes
My crown of empire is turning to crown of thorns
They can take my home, nation that I belong
But they never break my will of steel

Blessed will be nation of Liberty
I devoted myself to your fame
Triumph of heroes and glory of steel
Will forever hold sacred my name

Through Europe I passed leading the march of armies
Force of bayonets crushed and erased the orders
From Africa's bounds to woods and fields of Russia
I brought the new world and freedom's breath

I will spend my days on distant land, forgotten
There will end my path, there I'll become immortal
Years will pass away; History's page will turn
Words written by fate will never burn

"Even when I am gone, I shall remain in people's minds the star of their rights, my name will be the war cry of their efforts, the motto of their hopes."
