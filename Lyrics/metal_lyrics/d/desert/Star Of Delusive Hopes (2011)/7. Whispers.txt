[Music &amp; Lyrics: O.Aryutkin]

"The only thing I wish for is for you to see the real me, not the disguise I'm wearing since the day I came to this world.
See the other side of mine - a real wicked one, like your deepest nightmare that came true! Would you follow me through this noghtmare till the end?"

Rain... falls down on me.
Rest... so close but never meant to be...
Far from alive,
Here, where spirits whisper I can
Hide.

How ironic it is
That unholy would pray,
Seeking answers up there
Where no vampires (are) allowed.
Watching time pass me by,
Every color is gray
Will she understand
If I feed her blood?

Every night I wake up to hunt
Keep her out of my wicked heart
Every nightmare she sees - my reality
Will she come with me?

Moon... guides me the way
Mist... is scaring you and makes you pray
I will be near
There... a creature from your horror dreams

When the clock strikes at midnight
I will be your guide
Let me show you the path
Out of dead to alive
Let me take you away
To the cursed other side
Only one bite of lust
I will make you mine

Choose...
The choice is not mine, she has to know!

My heart doesn't beat
But it pulses with pain
If I'll tell the truth
Will you call me insane?

Decide - eternal love,
Is it worth betrayal?
Is it worth the god?

Lose the soul,
Trade for strength - 
Draw the line
Between night and day!
