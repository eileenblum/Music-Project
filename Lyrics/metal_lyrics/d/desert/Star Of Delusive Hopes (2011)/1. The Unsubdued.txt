[Music: M.Shafranski/Lyrics: A.Raymar]

Flames of the stake
Will burn my flesh
On final day
They will not see me smashed

My crime is the truth you are trying to hide
Knowledge is poison for the divine lie

God I have sinned
I found the way
For the mankind
That you betrayed
Truth of my words
You can't refute
I'll always stay
The unsubdued

Rebel in heart
I searched the way
Out of the dark
Where you prefer to stay

Victim of ignorance, I'm paying the price
For the triumph of science you cannot deny
