[Music: O.Aryutkin/Lyrics: S.Losev]

33 years, only 3 on the shore
Look in tired eyes as proud as before

Challenge noble's law
Set the justice by arms
Feel the salt on tongue
Yet live sweetest of lives

Here our captain stands
Our brother in blood
Leader of the crew
Second only to god

Oceans open wide
For the holder of key
Letter of marque
License to kill

We are not thieves, simply take what we need
Honor Discipline, the only law...

Those who sail high seas
Have no family bounds
Future covered with mist
Will never reach peaceful grounds

Friends with king and whore
Noble and vice
Free to choose the lord
Fortune is rolling the dice
