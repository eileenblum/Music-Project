[Music: M.Shafranski/Lyrics: A.Raymar]

High on the rock it stands
Symbol of nation's pride
Tragedy
Written on sands of time

Cry to the sky
Over the Dead Sea
Stones will keep thy call
Massada will never fall

Three years of dreadful siege
Zealots held the onslaught
Until the foe
Brought down the stronghold's walls

One by one
They cut throats of the friends
With words of freedom
Zealots committed suicide
They died!!!

Since immemorial time
Battles tortured this land
In my song
Martyrs to freedom are praised
