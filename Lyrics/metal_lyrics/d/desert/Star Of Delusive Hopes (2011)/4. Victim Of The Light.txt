[Music &amp; Lyrics: O.Aryutkin]

Most heroes, who stood for the right and led us to better future,
Were betrayed, tortured, exiled, murdered for sake of cheap ideals
By ones they defended, blinded by false gods!
Thousands were condemned for deeds of glory.
This is the story of saint going down!

They say I am possessed
If so who is my lord
Whom shall I beg?
To give me power to survive
This night

I will be executed by the dawn
Whole town will watch me die
By charges I don't even know
I won't confess in ugly lies

(In) thousand years you will
Call me goddess reborn
Day of reckoning
Will judge upon us!

I will burn to bones
Rise to skies and be called
I will burn to bones
Victim of the light!

I led thy king to throne
Like dogs pave path to blind
I could reclaim the crown and
Kingdom to myself yet I

Believe in God, as most of you forgotten how
And he believes in Joan from the town of Arc!
I won't confess in ugly lies!!

In the chaos of clash
I was wounded hard.
Finest steel cut through chains
Yet my heart still beats alive!

You say I should fall and die
Like some godless mercenary
(But) manage to forget that I
Believe like most of you forgotten how
And god believes in me,
God believes in me,
God believes in Joan from the town of Arc!!!

True prophets fall regardless of time
Ages by ages darkness prevails
Losses for sake of divinity high
Savior will die, savior will die

I Destined by Lord himself
By vision empowered!
Once carried the torch of faith
Now sentenced to fire!

True prophets fall regardless of time
Ages by ages darkness prevails
Losses for sake of divinity high
Savior will die, savior will die
Savior will die, savior will die
Losses for sake of divinity high
