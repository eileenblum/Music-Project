[Music: M.Shafranski/Lyrics: A.Raymar]

At the dawn of the moon
My shadow is rising
Doomed to howl at the moon
For the crime that once did for lust

After midnight I'll come through the mist
Feel my cold breath on your lips
Night with virgin will end eternal pain
Love me and...

Blood of my beloved wife
And my pain only getting worse
Jealousy ate my mind
And my love led me to the curse

Release me...
