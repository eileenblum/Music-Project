[Music &amp; Lyrics: O.Aryutkin]

Decades ago
Before our fathers were born
Empires clashed
In fury burning millions
Among these men
Were outlaw soldiers who's
Names is the time
Are lost forever
Fighters stood
One hundred times outnumbered
Time to attack
Break through the line of fire
No turning back
"Surrender means die!"

On the ashes of war
(Redemption by blood!)
Villains rise, heroes fall
On the ashes of war
(Now you steal my glory!)
Villains rise, heroes fall

One by one
battalions went to heaven
Given no chance
Betrayed by motherland
Sent to advance
Fatalities not counted
Sent into hell

You dare to be my judge
But seem to forget
My blood is red as yours
Was split on this land
Answered the call as one
United we stood
Till order 227 was misunderstood
