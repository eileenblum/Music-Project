[M. Shafranski, A.Raymar / D. Kovalev]

[Verse 1:]
I see gloomy sky
And nobodyâs near
Darkness so close
Iâm wet by my tears
All closed by the clouds
Grey world fall on me
Such a long way to you
That Iâm going on
Still!

[Pre-chorus:]
Iâm used to fall
Strong winds are slowing me
The rain is coming down
Iâm alone in the sea
My flash getting cold
Awfully right now
Strengthâs dropping in body
But Iâm walking somehow
You'll never know my own distress
Ocean of tears is not only mess!!!
But I can survive
I have one more chance
Impossible way
This trace is my place

[Chorus:]
More than my life
Is my love for you
Keeps me alive
Cause it lives forever
More than my life
And the night will stay behind
When Iâll bring my love to you
Ooh, Iâm here!

[Verse 2:]
I see smiling faces
Surrounding me
Iâm so alone now
But I still believe
On skin painful wounds
And my way is so long
Your heart is by my side
I know what I want!!!

[Pre-chorus]

[Verse 3:]
And a miracle happened
I see a new sunrise
Itâs so blinding me
Amazing my eyes
All walls were destroyed
And rainbow in the sky
My way must come to an end
Welcome to a new life!

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
