[M. Shafranski, A.Raymar]

[Verse 1:]
Destinyâs calling
âFulfill the oaths
And step forward to the quest
For the sacred throneâ

Through the dimensions
Spaces and times
Lies our way of trials
And never ending fight

[Pre-chorus:]
We trod on this path together
My faithful friend
And sworn the oath to fight the Evil
With sword in hands

Somewhere beyond lies the kingdom
Of justice and truth
And on itâs throne of ancient wisdom
I will rule

[Verse 2:]
Do you remember
Rage of the fight
You crashed helmets by your sword
And you saved my life

Our path of glory
Is hard, my brave friend
But together we will
Pave the way to Promised Land

[Pre-chorus]

Hordes of Darkness surround us
But weâre standing strong
Your helping hand is by my side
So weâre holding on

I will return to the kingdom
Thatâs waiting for me
And on itâs sacred throne
I will rule free

[Chorus:]
Now draw your sword my old friend
And fight to the end
Forever we stand
For our Promised Land

Our dreamâs coming true
For me and for you
The King will return
To his sacred throne

[Verse 3:]
We stand on the way
Of courage and might
Will of Gods protects us
And honor is our guide

Forgotten kingdom
Is waiting for us
Drink your ale my friend
And prepare for the ride!

[Pre-chorus]

Our friendship forged
In fire and steel
Brothers in arms for all times
We were born to win

Our union is sacred
It leads me to throne
And our journey has an end
However itâs long

[Chorus]
