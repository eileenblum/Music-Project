[M. Shafranski, A. Raymar / D.Kovalev]

[Verse 1:]
Fight!
Is it right?
When youâre alone in this desert
And the only thing around you
Is the ocean of sand

Die!
Or stay alive
You have the choice, youâll have forever
But thereâs no escape from it
Itâs just illusion in your mind

[Chorus]
Great desert in your soul
Great desert will eat you all
Sun shines and kills you in the bottom
And thereâs no way to get no water

[Verse 2:]
Try!
To survive!
But the miracle youâre waiting
Is the trap you have created
Find the will to eliminate it!

Cry!
Look up to the sky!
Youâre praying God to help you
But mysterious are his ways
And he have brought you to this place

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Find!
A thin line
That could bring you out and rescue
When youâre dying alone
In the depth of this desert

Strike!
With the sun
In your soul youâll find the darkness
To protect your mind and body
From itâs killing light

[Chorus]
