[M. Shafranski, A. Raymar]

[Narration:]
Look into my eyes
Do you see the fire of hate?
They are predicting the end
Of this rotten goddamn world

[Verse 1]
People think that Iâm an insane
Poor old man who lost his mind
They hate me for my predictions
About future of mankind

On the squares of dirty cities
My words are reaching to their hearts:
âThis world is doomed to be destroyed
And age of purity will rise!â

[Chorus]
One day thunder from the sky
Will burn this world of fear and pain
Earthquakes will shake Mother Earth
Flood will wash all sins away

Rising dawn of the new world
Blinds my eyes and makes me cry
Listen to the prophecy of madman
And prepare yourself to die

[Narration:]
How could you be free
When youâre led by otherâs will?
In the name of God you kill
But worship to the gold!

[Verse 2]
Lust and filth wear mask of love
They rule hearts and souls of men
Selling women, raping children
Find delight in suffering

Our mind decays progressing
Brining mankind to its end
We must pay for our sins
And expiate them by own death

[Chorus]

The Prophecy

My old eyes could see the signs of Apocalypse
My fevered heart feels the coming end
I can hear wrathful thunder roaring from the sky
And the earth shuddering from rage

Purifying fire will burn this world away
And in its flames you and I must die
But from the ashes will rise a seed of a new life
That will be free from vice and full of light!

[Narration:]

Look into my eyes
Do you see the fire of hate?
They are predicting the end
Of this rotten goddamn world!

[Chorus]
