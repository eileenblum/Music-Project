[M. Shafransk, A. Raymar]

[Verse 1:]
Banner with cross is flying on the horizon
Hot desert wind is drifting dust on steel
Knights of the Temple are returning to Holy Land
The will of God must be fulfilled

They are led by the hands of Rome
Dogs of war with hearts of stone

[Chorus:]
Light of the crescent flows on the cross
And the eternal battle will rise again
Where the tears of Virgin Mary have fallen
There bloodshed will proceed and foreverâ¦

[Verse 2:]
The Tomb of Christ is in hands of the infidels
Jerusalem now is bleeding in chains
Templars are marching to bring the deliverance
Warriors of Allah will pay by their lives

Sack and rape, burn and kill
Pope have blessed all your deeds

[Chorus]

The lion will tear the hawk!!!

[Verse 3:]
Since the inglorious crusade was over
Thousand years there is no peace on this land
And lionâs stripes are still reaching out
For the hawk that flying high in the sky

Rivalry of two worlds
Why men must die for gods?

[Chorus]
