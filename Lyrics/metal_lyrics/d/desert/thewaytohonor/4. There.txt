[M.Shafranski â A.Raymar / D.Kovalev]

[Verse 1:]
In the land of pain and horror
On the other side of mirror
Where the demons leave forever
Our story is beginning
Thousands years they fight between them
Only death and suffering is there
Ugly monsters want your spirit
Waiting for your quickly death

[Chorus:]
You must survive be always ready
Protect your mind that arms your body
Be strong, donât fall, donât let them take you
Just show them truly who you are

[Verse 2:]
The air is dirty full of fear
Donât let to evil disappear
Destroy infernal creatures
On your path to glorious future
Be on right side youâre heart will help you
Let to your mind forever guide you
Just be yourself, fight proud and donât retreat
God bless you on this battlefield

[Chorus]
