[M.Shafranski â A.Raymar / D.Kovalev / M.Shafranski]

[Verse 1:]
Licking wounds
I feel bloodâs taste of someone else
Breaking the rules
My eyes can see more than that false

[Pre-Chorus:]
All thoughts about life
Life like death
Death like a dream
And dream like love
Doing sins
God donât know that Iâm here
Forgotten dreams
I leave this world, my heart in fever

[Chorus:]
But I feel the wind
Of freedom, it blows and brings us the future
I will spread my wings
And will fly away to the land of illusions
And Iâll leave behind
This ugly world of pain and horror
And it will be mine
If I will stand on my way to honor
Killing hope
In my eyes pain of this days
Feeling a rope
On my neck, and Iâm breaking these chains

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
