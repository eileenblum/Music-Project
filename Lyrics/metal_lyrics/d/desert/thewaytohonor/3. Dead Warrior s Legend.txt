[M.Shafranski â D.Kovalev / A.Raymar]

[Verse 1:]
It's not a dream,
It's a hero coming in!
Tonight,
Commander,
We'll pray,
Commander,
And will not surrender,
Until blood flows in veins.
Tonight,
Commander,
We'll strike,
Like thunder,
And will stay,
With people
Who gave their life for us

Now we'll come to deepest forest
To destroy there evil forces,
Courage is my only shield
On this privy trail.

Darkness rules in land of humans,
Bringing horror to our children.
Holy voices once called us,
Fight to the death.

Tonight,
Commander,
We'll pray,
Commander,
And will not surrender,
Until blood flows in our veins.
Tonight,
Commander,
We'll strike,
Like thunder,
And will stay,
With people
Who gave their life for us.

[Chorus:]
And light,
In fight,
You hurt,
I'm crying,
Your heart will be stolen,
Wallâs falling again.
And light,
In fight,
You hurt,
I'm crying,
I'll always remember,
It can't be in vain.

[Verse 2:]
No way out.
And there is no place to stay.
This is the end,
But it is a new beginning.
And now you die!
It canât happen tonight.
And now you die!
Your soul will rise so high.
And now you die!
On your grave angels will fly.
And now you die!
Is this one a fault of mine?
Don't forget your older brothers
Rest in peace
Honor to the heroes
Fallen on the battleground
Fiery heart, brave feat
Things to live
Light of sun will bring forever
This eternal legend

[Chorus]
