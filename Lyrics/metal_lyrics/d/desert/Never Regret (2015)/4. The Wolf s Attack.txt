[Music: M. Shafranski; Lyrics: A. Raymer]

Chilling cold of the crypt on your skin,  
the medallion is trembling, fear me 
ICE-COLD FIRE! Blade of silver glows in the dark,  
rolling dice with my Fate, MY DARK DESIRE 

Stay away! Beware, you evil creature 
Hide yourself or die, prey of the witcher! 
Soon the beast will meet the lot of mutant 
Face the dance of death, The Wolf's Attack 

No one lives after crossing my way,  
kingdoms crumble to dust, witcher's PATH TO GLORY	â 
Wrath of wizards, envy of kings 
Scrolls are written by blood, TELL MY DARK STORY 

Stay away! Beware, you evil creature 
Hide yourself or die, prey of the witcher! 
Soon the beast will meet the lot of mutant 
Face the dance of death, The Wolf's Attack 

The Wolf is back 

This adventure shall never end,  
a new chapter begins, SWORD FOR HIRE 
Blade of silver glows brighter again,  
rolling dice with my Fate, MY DARK DESIRE 

Stay away! Beware, you evil creature 
Hide yourself or die, prey of the witcher! 
Soon the beast will meet the lot of mutant 
Face the dance of death, The Wolf's Attack
