[Music: O. Aryutkin; Lyrics: A. Raymer, O. Aryutkin]

Cape horn is raging, tearing the sails,  
my vessel's riding the gale 
Through roaring thunder I'm breaking waves,  
leading the crew to my aim 

Wind's growing stronger, howling my name,  
Southern Cross scarring my eyes 
Shipmates all begging to storming sea,  
crying the oath to the skies 

Oceans will open to fearless who gamble the soul 

Damnation lies on me to squeeze the rotten helm,  
the horror of the sea lives in me! 
Under the torn black sail I'm Flying to the deep,  
The Flying Dutchman tale set me free 

Shall you encounter gale in the sky,  
omen of certain demise 
Abandon prayers, welcome aboard,  
my ship belongs to no port 

Traded my soul to the Devil for glory and gold 

Damnation lies on me to squeeze the rotten helm,  
the horror of the sea lives in me! 
Under the torn black sail I'm Flying to the deep,  
The Flying Dutchman tale set me free
