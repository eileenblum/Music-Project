[Music: M. Shafranski; Lyrics: A. Raymer]

Times of the civil war  
carved mother land with gore,  
sinful beasts are crawling in our home;  
Red Viper grabbed the throne 

Now the time has come to stand as one,  
fight, fulfill the oath we once sworn 
For the Tsar, for faith and Russia,  
we are rising from the ashes, march with honor to the battle 

Eagle of Empire cries  
on final march to demise 
True sons of our Father land,  
the glorious White Army stands 

We lost homes and lost the lands,  
our soil in paws of the Reds 
Infected minds of men with heresies,  
massacred families 

From Siberia to the black sea  
rage of Russian spirit is unleashed,  
pick of nation on its splendor,  
no intention to surrender, march with honor to the battle 

Eagle of Empire cries  
on final march to demise 
True sons of our Father land,  
the glorious White Army stands 

I believe that time will come and the Russian army,  
led by commitment of commanders and soldiers,  
will rise and clear the mother soil of unholy beasts, ones who deny god and state,  
at times of despair one must sacrifice own good for sake of Motherland! 
Hearts of Russians beat as one, victory awaits!!! (Baron Pyotr Wrangel) 

Years have passed, war was lost,  
we left familiar coasts,  
exiled and outcast forevermore,  
Red Viper grabbed the throne 

From Siberia to the black sea  
sons of Russian people live in fear,  
pick of nation on its splendor,  
ruined, gone, exiled, surrendered, we have lost the final battleâ
