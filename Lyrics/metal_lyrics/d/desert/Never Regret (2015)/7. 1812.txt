[Music: S. Metalheart; Lyrics: A. Raymer, O. Aryutkin]

Over the edge of the world, covered in frozen blood,  
lost my best friend to snow, ready to fall apart 
Craving to rule them all, father devoured his heir,  
Great Army marches far, destined for great despair 

Hell has frozen over  
and it's NOW! 

We have marched for many miles, we shall march for many more  
in the frozen mud of Russia I am bound to be un-born 
Swiftly tagged the juice of nation, I was promised easy bread,  
father handed one-way journey to the godforsaken land 

Hear the thump of marching armies,  
horses neigh and cannons moan 
The soundtrack to final battle,  
death is reaching for my throat 

Just one more step  
on the field of broken wishes 
Borodino! 
The beginning of the end 

Lost! 
In the 1812! 
Gone! 
It's the 1812! 

Frenchmen strike with reckless fury,  
Russian forces tear apart 
On the field of broken wishes  
soil is soaking wet with blood 

Another page  
in the book of failed ambitions 
Borodino!  
Marks beginning of the end! 

Lost! 
In the 1812! 
Gone! 
It's the 1812!â
