[Music: O. Aryutkin; Lyrics: A. Raymer, O. Aryutkin]

Dreams never let you down so lay your head, rest it calm 
Fears and regrets will fade away 
Try to forget me love, chanting prayers long enough 
Missing in action, so the say 

Clock is breaking the silence 
Hope wakes when my eyes shut 
Torn, lost in the darkness 
Hide, safe in my memories 

Three long years tore my heart to pieces,  
promises and hope were found, lost, kept faith! 
Give me truth, my tortured soul is bleeding,  
do you walk the land or are you cold, dead? 

Time will never break bonds,  
years will never fade scents,  
oaths won't be forgotten,  
long will be The Road To You 

Time has come, the gathering is silent,  
soldier dressed in black returned to thee 
Promise me to live again my angel,  
death may do us part, today I set you free 

Time will never break bonds,  
years will never fade scents,  
oaths won't be forgotten,  
long will be The Road To You
