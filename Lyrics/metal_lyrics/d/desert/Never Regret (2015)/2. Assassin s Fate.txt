[Music: M. Shafranski, S. Metalheart, O. Aryutkin; Lyrics: A. Raymer]

Night,
The eastern night is scaring you
Your deepest nightmare's coming true
There is a shadow on the roof
Time has come, I am on the way
I am the hunter, you are the prey

Fear,
The fear is chilling your black heart
I'm counting steps before you die
By poisoned dagger shining bright

Run,
Chasing the prey, cast the fate
Blood signs the way of assassin
Fly
On wings of hate, taste my blade
Justice or death - that's my creed

Sign,
The secret sign reveals the path
To ancient wisdom of the gods
And knowledge of the global mind
Mysterious order, is alive
Holy vengeance, kept through times

Try,
Wear the rotten mask of faith
There is no option to escape
Your vile soul shall burn in flames

Run,
Chasing the prey, cast the fate
Blood signs the way of assassin
Fly
On wings of hate, taste my blade
Justice or death - that's my creed
