[Music: O. Aryutkin; Lyrics: O. Aryutkin]

I'll never see the light of the day again,  
this is where I'm gonna die on an autumn day 
Now I have only left one last thing to say,  
don't you ever stop, life is just a game 

I've Never Regretted the things I've done,  
the price paid was worth it ten thousand times 
I've Never Regretted what I've become,  
I had all you prayed for, I was a God 

Hey! You should be the king, not the hopeless clown! 
Hey! Take it by the horns, do you hear me, son? 
So, do you have a dream, even wildest one? 
All you need is faith, you have just begun 

I've Never Regretted the things I've done,  
the price paid was worth it ten thousand times 
I've Never Regretted what I've become,  
I had all you prayed for, I was a God
