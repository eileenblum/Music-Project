[Music: O. Aryutkin; Lyrics: A. Raymer, O. Aryutkin]

Darkness landed to the sky, only dim moonlight  
dances in my lonely chamber 
Poisoned wine flows in veins, takes my life away  
to the long awaited slumber, slumber, slumber 

Wake up and follow, the Devil's envoy is guiding me,  
let Final Journey set us free 
The storm is raging, no time to fear, fulfill the dream,  
let prince of darkness set us free 

Manuscripts can't burn away, they forever stay  
in the hearts of those who dare 
Words I've written with my tears cast away the fears,  
solitude is gone forever, ever, never! 

Wake up and follow, the Devil's envoy is guiding me,  
let Final Journey set us free 
The storm is raging, no time to fear, fulfill the dream,  
let prince of darkness set us free 

Darkness landed to the sky, only dim moonlight  
left behind in empty chamber 
We ascended above the land, flying high again,  
left the mortal world forever, ever, never! 

Wake up and follow, the Devil's envoy is guiding me,  
let Final Journey set us free 
The storm is raging, no time to fear, fulfill the dream,  
let prince of darkness set us free
