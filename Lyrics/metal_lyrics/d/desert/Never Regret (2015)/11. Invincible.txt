[Music: O. Aryutkin; Lyrics: A. Raymer, O. Aryutkin]

Western winds of uprising blow in my motherland,  
long awaited independence storms the minds of Polish men 
Die is cast, oath is spoken, call to arms was loud and clear,  
day of reckoning is coming, day of the revolt 

Invincible, Invincible we stand,  
across the globe the battle hymn we chant 
Unite and strike, rebellion we demand,  
Otchizna stands for motherland, motherland 

The only prayer I whisper while at dangerous sea,  
beg to see the day of vengeance, live to set my country free 
Banner's high, the gun has spoken, liberty or death for me,  
will of Pole cannot be broken, dreadful rage unleashed in me 

Invincible, Invincible we stand,  
across the globe the battle hymn we chant 
Unite and strike, rebellion we demand,  
Otchizna stands for motherland, motherland 

Will of Pole cannot be broken,  
banner's high, the gun has spoken,  
day of reckoning is coming,  
liberty or death for me
