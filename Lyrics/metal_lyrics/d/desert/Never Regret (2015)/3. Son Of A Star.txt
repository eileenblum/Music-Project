I, holy messiah  
rising from Desert's sands,  
I challenge Roman Empire,  
done defiling my land 

Fight!

Rise from Beitar, Son Of A Star,  
freedom prevails, the oppression's falling 
On Promised Land I assume command,

Sons of the holy land! 
These are orders by the lord and the sole commander 
BLESSED BE HIS KINGDOM FOREVER! 

Let these matters I command you today be upon your heart,  
bind them as a sign upon your arm and between the eyes 
Beware, lest your heart be seduced and you turn you astray  
and serve gods and others who bow them  
then let the wrath of God be against you,  
he will restrain the Heaven, there will be no rain and the ground will not yield its produced 
You swiftly be banished from the land! Hear on Israel! 

Follow the Son Of the Star,  
pray for the sons of Beitar,  
follow the Son Of the Star,  
pray for the sons of Beitar 

Sons of
