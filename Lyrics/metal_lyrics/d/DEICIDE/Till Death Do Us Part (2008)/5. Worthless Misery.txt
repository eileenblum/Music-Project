Worthless misery, failure to me,
Promise a lie, caught in deceit,
trapped in the thought,
can't be believed, Torn from the one,
by your own will, deal with the pain,
nothing fulfilled, Scourge of grief,
dead to us, life...
resume, hell for you...

It is done and you have lost before the
world to see. Anger fit into the shock
of your insanity. Cry to god and find
that he has turned his back to you,
Made to look the way you are and
what you tried to do, No defense or
compromise will change the final
end, All alone unto yourself a midst
the suffering, Stripped the right to
recommend or try to intervene, Facts
compound the final outcome of your
own defeat, Rip the weak of their
desire and humility, Bound to hell for
all you hurt with your hypocrisy,
Bleed exposed within words of what
the bible said, Beg to death will only
get you more of what you dread,
Dead to us a remedy begin to per-
fect life, Gone for good the pain and
again that you invite, Hang yourself
with every word that you have
misperceived, Fool yourself has
now propelled me into victory.

Worthless misery, brought on by you,
Worthless filth of eve,
Entomb the womb,

Worthless to god, And us you are,
Worthless to all, Heartache befall

Worthless to me, You have no need,
Worthless in death,
Peace you wont get,

Worthless in vain, Driven insane,
Worthless your sins,
Vengeance, I win.

Penance divide, smell of disease,
fucked and distraught,

Frozen in grief, listen to none,
face your demise, caught in the act,
Dead to mankind.

Worthless misery, incased in doom,
death to you, Heart of stone will
be your fortune in the depth below,
Dignity and a conviction
to be never known,

Misery from whence you came
and all you ever knew,
Light of god and the forgiveness
count the end of you,
In distress instill the
time of the epiphany,

Here is now and you refuse to see
the suffering, Catalyst in your
disgrace unfound unto respect,
Live with hell inside the flesh until
you rot with death...

Worthless to god, And us you are,
Worthless to all, Heartache as well,

Worthless to me, You have no need,
Worthless to hell, Heaven as well,

Worthless in vain, Driven insane,
Worthless you are. Worse one by far,

Worthless disease, Brought up
by greed, Worthless in life,
Pray that you die,

Worthless in death, Peace you
won't get, Worthless your sins,
Vengeance, I win.
