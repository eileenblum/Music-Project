Sworn enemy, a wish a death,
and dead to me, you are a lie.

A waste of light, thy hate for thee,
Die Die Die Die Die Die

I curse your life, revenge is mine,
the bonds untied.

Your god now wants you dead,
along with all mankind,

Resented and grotesque,
your failure is so divine,
Unknown upon this world
the time has come to die.

Thy fool upon the cross,
the word of god distraught,
united in decay,
the war is lost with no one saved,
Release a hellish deed,
destroying Christian greed,
all fall into it's grave,
Erase the righteousness away,
The church of god callapse,
destroy it's holy grasp,
the bile of thy book,
in vain endeavor underfoot,
A war across the earth
the work of thou reversed,
unscathed embattlement,

Impaling every angel sent.
Christ the lord, the fool,
the pawn, the prince,
of right your light is gone,
Bleed to death, in halls of stone,
defy, destroy and overthrown,
Burning crosses has begun,
the impotent, the chosen one,
Ignorance the final lash,
the shrine of god reduced to ash.
Appall the teachings of god,
berate the mighty alter,
rebuke infernally,
The reign of power to it's knees
Free will of destiny,
is ours within our reach,
the hour will be said,
heaven murdered Jesus dead,
Horror...in the halls of stone,
silence your god,
His will for never more,
the light is dead,
Die...no one believes!!!!

Appall the teachings of god, berate
the mighty alter, rebuke infernally,
The reign of power to it's knees
Free will of destiny,
is ours within our reach,
the hour will be said,
heaven murdered Jesus dead,
Horror...in the halls of stone,
silence your god,
His will for never more,
the light is dead.
Horror in the halls of stone,
Satan descend

Die...I promise thee, in my defense,
I'll see you dead, and crush your lie,
A worthless life, in true defeat,
Die Die Die Die Die Die...

The end of eve, hypocrisy,
commence to bleed,
No longer under thou
the word of god forgot,
Freewill for evermore your image
and your thought,
Denial by the mass,
the church of god destroyed,
Jesus forbid return,
his lore to all be gone.
