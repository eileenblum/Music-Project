Falling from his majesty into his ill repute, banished by the kingdom of the word of living truth.
Feeding off the excrement's of bible prophecy, captured and distorted into something said that would never be seen.
Prophet in the act of thee, resent the vows of old, nullify your standing in light of heavens hope.
Paralyzed and cry defeat ensile to the lord, bleeding from the inside out upon the cross of the Christ you ignored.
In the eyes of god you failed and faltered in his heart, angel of no mercy you descend from once you start.
Worthless in the face of thou reside in his duress, powerless against thy sword reviled by ones you have blessed.
Time of torment, will besieging, eyes abhorrent, life depleting, lies devoured, thou defeated, Christ the coward, god is dead
Dead
In his eyes you will die !!!!!!!!
Fester in the wounds without no dignity or soul, blind eyed to the realm of god is what your future holds.
Relish by catastrophe in battled by deceit, forfeit what is right for wrong to fall from his grace and the sight of his son.
Ravaged by the instruments of all that you command, powerless inside the faith heavens holy plan.
Thou who have forsaken you exile you to death, fleeing from the path of god, despised in this world and to what you confess.
Tragedy invites the truth in time you will receive piling on top of you and all that you believe.
Lost to the intention and the writ of compromise, sour in reflection to the eyes of the lord and to all of his kind.

Time of torment, will besieging, eyes abhorrent, life depleting, lies devoured, thou defeated, Christ the coward, god is dead.
In his eyes, your despised, endlessly, dead to thee....
