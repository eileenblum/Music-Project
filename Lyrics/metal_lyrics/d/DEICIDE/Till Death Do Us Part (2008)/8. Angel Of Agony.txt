Pain and distrust
and a lust for uncertainty,

Inflict the hearts of the weak
with your entity,

Disrupt their lives and take flight.

Garbage of god,
and disposed to humanity,

Rampaging hurt you
impose your insanity,

Welter in hate of the
one who reviled you,

Stripped of the rights that you
thought you would never loose,

Driven insane immolate in the agony

Burden the world with your lies of integrity,

Hell will befall your angelic mistrust,

Thrown from the heaven's
disgraced in disgust.

Angel of agony, demonic blasphemy,
Angel of agony, drown in your vanity,
Angel of agony, victimize empathy,

Angel of agony, fall to your death...

Ghost of aggression
intermix in your self defeat,

Savage desire unrequit
to the laes of thee,

Imprison you till you are dead,

Damage undone
washed away for eternity,

Restore the life that you
thought you could take from me,

Anger invoked to the point
of destroying you,

Angel of pain revelate
in a pending doom,

Dead in the heart
self destruct in the eyes of he,

Dwelling rejection for
the pain you refuse to see,

Ingest defeat devastate
in the final thrall,

Suffer a fate that the
lord has reserved for all,

Refuse the word underfed
by the wisest one,

Shower yourself in a blame
that will not succumb,

Alone you will go to your death...
Angel of agony, demonic blasphemy,
Angel of agony, drown in your vanity,

Angel of agony, victimize empathy,
Angel of agony, fall to your death...
