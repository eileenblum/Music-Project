Caught up in your lies that torture you to death
The end of compromise; you're found to be unfit
You cannot be believed and now the truth for all be told
The veil of hypocrisy is taking out its toll
Lie in your deception and before your god you weep
Ridden to a life of pain for all you have deceived.

All is not forgotten and for all eternity
You will bear the burden of the things you've done to me

I won't take you till your death
Throw you back from where you left
Cheishment of vows unmeant
God will get you once you're dead
Back to where you started from on preying on the weak
Child of misguided light unsure of what you need

Running from your past mistakes pretending you are right
Lesser men will stand by you and all you do decide

Devastate you with contempt lost forever your descent
Sacraments of love unknown; suffer by yourself alone
Always to be ostracized forever till your death;
Never will you live it down until your final breath

Till death do us part; fall from heaven and my heart
Till death do us part; holy vows are ripped apart
Till death do us part; one with evil and you are
Till death do us part; meaningless and dead to god

Call who you want; won't bother me a bit
You'll only hurt your worthless life of living shit
The pleasuring of lust has damned you to your final death
Never will you find the peace within what you regret
Pity and assumption in the loss you're going to know
Leave you in the shadows of the one you can't adore
Welcome to a nightmare of a constant loss you dream
Always will you live with what you thought would never be

Till death do us part; shine the light of what you are
Till death do us part; gone forever from my heart
