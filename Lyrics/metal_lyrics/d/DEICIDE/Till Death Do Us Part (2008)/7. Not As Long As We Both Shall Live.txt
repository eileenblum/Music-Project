Not as long as we both shall live,
sworn to resentment I can never forget,

No empathy for you will ever fill this heart of mine,
I wait the day to celebrate the ending of your life.
.....Always to be your enemy.

Depositions of the truth be tell,
from out of the shadows,
released from hell.

Not as long as you life exist will you ever undo a single thing that you did,
You'll never live to see the light on which the son will shine,
The emptiness within your heart is all that's left behind.

The lie of you has been besieged.

Cut you in two and reduce you to dust,
pitiful lamb of betray and disgust,
Overlook you with my eyes of contempt,
powerless as I envision you dead.
Rendering torment on all that you grieve,
evil upon you as long as you breathe,
Blasphemy damning and nailed to the wall,
through my conviction of Lucifer's call,

Insanely driven by the sins of your god, weeping infection
from out your scars,
Empty and fucked and forever indeed, you have been cursed by the powers to be

Wear out your welcome where ever you stay, live in denial the rest of your days.

Once you are dead I will dance on your grave.

Not as long as we both shall live,
the son you begotten,
he will never forgive.
Thou arrogance will be the death of you along with thee,
a sense of loss has come a cross is to where you need to be,.....
Devour you in agony....

Acquisition of your lies be seen,
the trials of wisdom at the end of your dream.
Not as long as you wish to be,
no place in your world where you will ever find me.

You gave away the innocence you made and can't be found,

Our world has been a better place since you been not around.

The end of you I pray of thee..

Cut you in two and reduce you to dust,
pitiful lamb of betray and disgust.

Overlook you with my eyes of contempt,
powerless as I envision you dead.
Rendering torment on all that you grieve,
evil upon you as long as you breathe,
Blasphemy damning and nailed to the wall,
through my conviction of Lucifer's call,

Insanely driven by the sins of your god,
weeping infection from out your scars,
Empty and fucked and forever indeed, you have been cursed by the powers to be

Wear out your welcome where ever you stay, live in denial the rest of your days.

Once you are dead I will dance on your grave.
