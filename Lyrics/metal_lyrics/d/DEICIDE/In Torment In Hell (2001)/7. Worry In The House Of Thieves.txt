I hate you more than any word can describe,
Wish you were dead, and I will live till you die,
Destroy the dreams of everyone you control,
Now that I'm above you, the deceit can be told,
A separation of a chance that must take,
Under calculations have been digging your grave,
Open the book to endless chapters I read,
I will know the tmth that brings you down on your knees,
Uncovered secret, exposing their crime
confronting them is just a matter of time.
Without an option, or way to escape,
You have pay for the mistakes that you made.
The game is over, now run to the light,
Your lack of vision will restore what is mine.
In Preservation of your life of mystic
a reparation that at last will be seen,
Untouched by the hand of god,
Look what it has done to us.
Worry in the house of thieves,
Overlooking everything,
Untouched by the hand of god,
Your compassion never was,
Cut the cord of agony,
Bitterness, uncertainty, [trail Into Lead]
Their recollection of events is a lie,
Woe and suffering has always been on the mind,
Beyond myself the misery that you've caused,
Step into my circle and your life will be lost,
You seem to think that I'm to do what I'm told,
Over superstitious from the stories of old,
Your putrid essence and the scriptures of god,
Leave me un removed from my belief in Satan.
