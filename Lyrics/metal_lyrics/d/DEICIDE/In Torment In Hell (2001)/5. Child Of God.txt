"Rivalries, righteous one, go unto god, and take his son.
Prophecy, is his defeat, nailed to the cross, religiously,
Gag on the feast, his vile psalms, morality, the visions gone,
Banish thy word, and masturbate, it is absurd your silly faith.
Fall to your knees, bow before he, it was a lie, was it a dream,
who will be next, where are you now, civil unrest, contort the soul,
If you come back, and if you do, who could forget, vengeance, and doom,
Calvary lost, look at us now, gone is your law, centuries old.
FUCK OFF....(it will be my way)

[Lead.....]

Still we live, until the day, confronting death, in
different ways, follow his path of emptiness,
solemnly grasp, digest our sin, Follow his lead
betray the fool, look at yourself, re write the
rules, Consort the ghost, who's laying low, evil is
all we've ever known,
Hang all his priest, stripping of souls, second
coming, raping the world, rending of god, rapture
unleashed, anger above, send in the beast.
Cash in his cross, where will it end, beggar of
fools, come back again, wait you we will, when
you arrive, child of god, your turn to die
