Standing on mountains of sin, bad luck Is coming again,
Wasting away in this hole, anguishing inside my soul,
Inner peace I am denied, damming myself in the mind,
Wondering eyes never see, visible powers concede,
Nothing will stand in its way, immanent doom and decay,
It is a present from god, payback for what I have done,
Circling every mistake, wait to deliver my fate,
Evil with anger and rage, sicken I bath in its pain,
Wallow in shadows I'm in, watcher of heaven and hymn,
Heartache is coming to stay, behold the mark of betray,

[Lead...]

Karma is coming for me, masking confusion unease,
Sorrow absorbing my soul, mourning the lack of control,
Pondering why I exist, remove myself from its grip,
Self mutilation unstopped, repel the markings of god,
When will you show me your face, immanent doom in disgrace

[Lead...]

Standing on mountains of sin, bad luck is coming again,
Wasting away in this hole, anguishing inside my soul,
Inner peace I am denied, damming myself in the mind,
Wondering eyes never see, visible powers concede,
Nothing will stand in its way, immanent doom and decay,
