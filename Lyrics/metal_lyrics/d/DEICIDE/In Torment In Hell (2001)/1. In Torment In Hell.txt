[Glen:] Pitiful
[Christian:] And where you wanna be?
[Glen:] In Torment In Hell!

Liar of a priest,
What could you want from thee,
is it so hard to see,
I will not believe,
the truth it sours,
inside you hide your head,
the contradiction,
I curse your life with dread.

You're dead to me,
your light is greed,
leave me alone,
to the unknown,
I have to leave,
the best to be,
beyond his gates,
without his grace.

In torment in hell,
uncontrolled and casting spells,
plotting death and suffering,
binding souls with misery,
burning Christians begging pleas,
satisfy my need to bleed,
trample on the lambs of god,
bow before thy lord Satan.

Stay away from god;
find out that you are,
human deity,
born to be deceived,

You worship cowards,
a cross for which he bled,
no more empowered,
the light of god is dead,
I fell from god,
his word begot,
unlearn his faith,
the lord replaced,

Heaven is hell,
flesh is the cell,
the earth I take,
return to hate

In torment in hell,
uncontrolled and casting spells,
plotting death and suffering,
binding souls with misery,
burning Christians begging pleas,
satisfy my need to bleed,
trample on the lambs of god,
bow before thy lord Satan.
