God don't care which path you fucking follow,
Come with me and I will show you this,
Drink the blood and swear your love for Satan,
Drag his bloody knife across your wrist,
Naked bliss of a sacrifice your bound upon the alter stone,
Screaming help and over come you can't believe what's going on,
Blacking out his light of hate, I take away the lord restraint,
Simplify the suffering, and reinvent the world I loathe,
Left to die in front of god, the Christian will not change what's done,
All for hymn and none for all, your final wishes reek of blood,
Atrophy deteriorate you give yourself to blasphemy,
Sacrilege called you here, and now you're ours and Christ don't care.

[Leads]

Live your life the way a Christian wants to,
Curse at god in vain his idle threats,
Fuck off Jesus we will never find you,
What you said has cost the world unrest.
Raise the sword of Lucifer, and cast your soul into the night
New found wisdom has enlightened you beyond the holy might,
Never reach a final path, achieve a higher place than that,
Me inside the one I trust, and never would I plead with god,
Stifled image cmciflxion bore the child with religion,
Insulate their sense of faith; devote the soul without a trace,
In the end they come to be, a part of Satan's majesty,
Sacrilege sent you here, and now you're ours and Christ don't care.
