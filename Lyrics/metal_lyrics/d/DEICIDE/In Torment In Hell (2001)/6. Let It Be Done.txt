False prophet you appear to be enslaved,
Make this world disappear no one forgave,
Take us into the light what gives you right?
I will not be divine, or live a lie.

Murder god, slash his thought, crush his cross, Lucifer
There's only one that we believe, it is not god, he Is a thief,
Hang them to bleed, him and his son, never in need, let it be done.

Kill the shepherd of the flock, I condemn my soul to rot, mass
confusion caused by god, rearrange the way we love,
Hate thy neighbor if you please, redefine our unity,

Praise god you might disappear, to back beyond,
No more living in fear; the light is gone,
Think why instead of who and face your death,
Our time has come to be, evil is free.

Murder god, slash his thought, crush his cross, Lucifer
There's only one that we believe, it is not god, he is a thief,
Hang them to bleed, him and his son, never in need, let it be done.
