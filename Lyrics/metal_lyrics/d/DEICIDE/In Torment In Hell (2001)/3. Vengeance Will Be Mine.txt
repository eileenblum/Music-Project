Vengeance will be mine, take what is yours and leave you to die,
Fortune unachieved, riddled with spite, destroying your life,
Liar that you are, facing yourself; you think you're a star,
Backstab you will see, standing alone, and loosing your dream,
After you and me, what will you do, when nothing's for free?
Patient as can be, washing my hands, of this whole fuckin' thing,
This is what you want; It is what you wish,
Throw away the one, I will not forgive,
Never was it true, anything you said,
Once I'm rid of you, turn your life to shit,
Vengeance will be mine, satisfy my sign.

Vengeance will be mine, no holding back when I'm dealing with time,
Extort reasoning; suffer a loss like you cannot believe,
Damage has begun, wasting away in your world of just one,
Laughter in your ears, driving you mad, it all disappears,
The end I see, never recover from what has to be.
Settle the score, denied my presence, will be my reward.
This is what you want; it is what you wish,
Throw away the one, I will not forgive,
Never was it true, anything you said,
Once I'm rid of you, turn your life to shit,
Vengeance will be mine, a testament to time.
