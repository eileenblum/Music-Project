Hooks through flesh
Beg and crawl
Feeding thirst and drain them all
Growing skin
Blood runs through
Taste the blade of ancient ones
Plague of pleasure
South of hell
Scorch the earth with blasphemy

Flesh, power, dominion
Torture those who seek to enter my realm
Manipulate the sacred portal
Unholy possession to send you to hell

Resurrection
Rise again
Congregation of the dead
Evil one
Deface your soul
Obscure the light of suffering
Ghost in time
Vanity
Written in the blood of god

Begging your forgiveness to pits of agony
In pain I am forever for all eternity

Flesh, power, dominion
The gateway will open, devour your soul
The bringer of darkness, an ancient of old
Cross through their dimension divine

Flesh, power, dominion
The gateway will open, devour your soul
The bringer of darkness, an ancient of old
Cross through their dimension divine

Hooks through flesh
Beg and crawl
Feeding thirst and drain them all
Growing skin
Blood runs through
Taste the blade of ancient ones
Plague of pleasure
South of hell
Scorch the earth with blasphemy

Flesh, power, dominion
Torture those who seek to enter my realm
Manipulate the sacred portal
Unholy possession to send you to hell
