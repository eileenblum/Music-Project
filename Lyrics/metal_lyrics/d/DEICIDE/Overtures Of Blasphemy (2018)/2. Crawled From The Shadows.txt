Plague of dysfunction the book of your lord
Absent in virtue
Wondering aimlessly preying on peace
Confliction defines you

Die... remnant of god, pontiff of failure
Why... covered in lies, no one beside you
Die...
Die...

Force your faith on me
Imposing presence, hypocrisy
Christianity
Crawled from the shadows

Forsaken son and the light of his sword
The Bible is fading
Threaten and warn, who defy your belief
There's nothing worth saving

Die... weapon of god, reverence fleeting
Lies... setting the tone, end of creation

Satan majesty
Infinite power, your enemy
Christianity
Your faith is devoured

Satan majesty
Infinite power, your enemy
Christianity
Crawled from the shadows

Plague of dysfunction the book of your lord
Absent in virtue
Wondering aimlessly preying on peace
Confliction inside you

Die... remnant of god, pulpit of failure
Why... covered in lies, nothingness guides you

Die...
