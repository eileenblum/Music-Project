I was there to witness the ending of your lord
Held the sacred spear through your saviors flesh it tore
Heard his cries of pain and watched his mournful tears
Falling from his blood soaked eyes

Seal the tomb below

Denied eternal rest as long as I breathe
You will not find rescue from the lord that you bleed
Praying to the father and the mark of the beast
Asking for repentance in the light of the weak
Sealed in your tomb
In your final place of rest is where you should be
No redemption
Sins of the father fall from the cross and die

Seal the tomb below

I hold your life in my hands
The fate of your savior is mine
Deny resurrection
And seal you in your grave

I refuse to bow to tyrants unseen
From your god begot to the end of your dream
A dimming of the darkness and the light of the sword
Instigate religion by the pages of war
Unified division by the thorns of his path
Unholy inquisition and the end of his wrath
Your god is dead
Kill the bastard son and cast him aside

Seal the tomb below

I hold your life in my hands
The fate of your savior is mine
Deny resurrection
And seal you in your grave

Seal the tomb deep below
