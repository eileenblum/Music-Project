Lost to the light of deceit
Twisting his lies will not save you
What do you want to achieve
Turning a blind eye to virtue

Savant of god
Drifting alone and forsaken
Behind the shadows of time
Crucified soul of salvation

Ill conceived, prophecy
Unbelieved... die...

Pray that the savior will rise
Worry the coming of Satan
Caught in the cross of his sign
Leading you into damnation

Faceless to god
Drink from the blood of your savior
No one and nothing to find
Choke on the gospel of hatred

Ignorance of old, light of imperfection
Reverence behold... Your faith in god is
Dead

Lost to the light of deceit
Twisting his lies will not save you
What do you want to achieve
Turning a blind eye to virtue

Savant of god
Drifting alone and forsaken
Behind the shadows of time
Crucified soul of salvation

Unbelieved, ill conceived
Bible fiend... die...
