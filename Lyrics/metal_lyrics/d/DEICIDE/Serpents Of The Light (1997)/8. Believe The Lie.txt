Time you died for your religion
Hypnotized by his infliction
Go to him, he is your savior
Leave this place, do us a favor

Believe the lie of a god you'll never know
Prepare to die when you least expect to go
A desperate mind will ignore reality
The word of christ has you lost in fantasy

Believe the lie to reside with him in death
Conserve to buy into what he's promising
Don't be so blind not to mind hypocrisy
You just might find what you want can never be

Take your life, be a true christian
For the lies of his existence
Sacrifice rendered unable
Book of god, it is a fable

[Lead: Brian]

Believe the lie to return from which we came
The serpent's light has you mesmerized again
When faith decides suicide at heaven's whim
Believe the lie, you are saved from all your sins

When is life worth a religion
Ease your mind, make the incision
Prey to him, incoming stranger
Son of god dead in the manger
