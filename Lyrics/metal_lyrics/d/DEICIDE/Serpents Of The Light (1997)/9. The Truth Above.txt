Arrive on earth, from our past have returned
Not his child, christians in denial
His rule undone, we are their creation
The truth above does not know your savior

Unidentified evolution
Fallen truth, break the god illusion
Out of faith will revive with reason
Synchronize this world we live in

[Lead: Brian]

The truth coming will destroy his story
Not of this earth, we are part of research
Christian hunted, end of god confronted
The truth above, we are part who they are

Key to life is the question answered
Fly into never known advancement
Out of ignorance running rampant
Sterilizing us from disaster

[Lead: Brian]
