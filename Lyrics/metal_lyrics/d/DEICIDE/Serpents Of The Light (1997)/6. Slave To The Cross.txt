Killing, blood spilling for faith in your god
Spreading the message defending his fraud
Murder unheard of until their belief
Rape of the willing is blessed by the priest
Travel to new worlds enslaved under god
Destroy their cultures then leave them to rot

Purification, consent to concede
Killing the ones who will never believe
Annihilation, convert to the cross
Civilization all under one god

SLAVE TO THE CROSS
SLAVE TO THE CROSS

Splitting masses indivision
Genocidal inquisition
Unified through their religion
Wreck this world with heaven's wisdom

Reign of the cross, the aggressor
Has killed more people than cancer
Slave to the cross of deception
When will we stop his infection

SLAVE TO THE CROSS - SLAVE TO THE CROSS

[Lead: Eric]
[Lead: Brian]

Terrify into religion
Recify the church ambition
Crucify who will not listen
Wreck this world with heaven's wisdom
