Impale the body,
Scars of his flesh,
Hung up to die on the crucifixion,
Bleeding to breathe,
Cursing at god...
Why!!!!!!!

The glory resurrection; live in wounds of recollection,
Who take his will unreasoned, naivete inside soul defeated?
Lascivious redemption, justify thy vile absence,
Propagate his aggression as you use his words as weapons.

Lies now have you lost, the worthless cause of the crucifixion.
The sanctity, to hang and bleed, and in the form of a human cross.
Blind by prophecy, his bible fiend, a bloody sword of his fantasy.
Tried for heresy, and sacrilege, to bare the scars of the crucifix.

You walk alone with Jesus, in a world of non-believers,
Humiliated savior, Is thy son of heavens failure,
For ever left undone, on the cross for everyone,
His words of god unheard, he is dead and not concerned.

God fatality, the life recedes on the cross of his sign,
Finality, in search of peace, to beg and plead for the end that will be,
The light descends, when suffering, impaled again for your blasphemous lies.
Resented death, his sins confessed, accept the scars of the crucifix.

Sad in your sorrow,
Withered within,
Stand in the shadow of all of our sins,
You are the son,
Choke on his blood...
Die!!!!!!
