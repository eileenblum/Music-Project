[spoken backwards:]
"I smell smoke"

Wonder and wait as I stare at the cross,
Thinking in ways that have Christ at a loss,
Kick your ass out through the lord's pearly gates,
When heaven burns and engulfed into flame.
Blasphemes villain, the killings begin,
Murdering Christians and torturing them,
Conquering churches and slaughtering lambs,
Doing it all for my love of Satan... (I love you Satan, my lord)
Bring death to your god; tear apart his begotten son,
Christian you are dead, fucking kill every one of them,
Drop down in defeat, retribution of hypocrisy,
In life is unknown, after here I will own your soul.
Death to god banished and burned to incite the invert,
Blasphemy.... When heavens burns we inherit the earth,
No more lies, churches and crosses confusing the mind,

Agony watching them burn in their righteous empire,
When heaven burns I will dance in its fire!!!!!!!
Drop dead hyraces, paradise has begun to bleed,
Give praise to the lord, over run in the face of war,
Christian wait with death, heaven burns into nothingness.
Satan on his throne rejoice in returning home.
End of god, when heaven burns it will fall to the earth,
Watch it burn angels on fire and screaming berserk,
Holy ghost, lost in confusion and puking in pain,
When it burns pissing on prophets that fall to the flame.

Wonder and wait as I stare at the cross,
Thinking in ways that have Christ at a loss,
Kick your ass out through the lord's pearly gates,
When heaven burns I will stomp on his face.
Blasphemes villains, the killings begin,
Murdering Christians and torturing them,
Conquering churches and slaughtering lambs,
Doing it all for my love of Satan.
