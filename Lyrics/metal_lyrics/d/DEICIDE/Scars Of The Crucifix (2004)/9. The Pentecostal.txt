Zombie of Jesus, heavenly fascist, worse of the worse,
Christian emphatic, baptized in panic, symbol rebirth,
Life ever after, total disaster, sick and perverse.

Glazed eyes of emptiness stare into space,
Brain washed to clean the sins you have embraced,
Dancing with serpents, and chanting to god.
Drinking of poison and speaking in tongues,
Full of his spirit and flailing around,
Warding off evil, on those who've been bound,
The Pentecostal revival the suffering.

Insane with penitence, mindless fanatic, everything Satan.

Wish for the rapture, death is embellish, verse his intent,
Counting thy blessings can't wait till heaven, mind fucked by god

Nothing you own it was all given up,
Stripped of your dignity and who you are,
Recite the bible with every word said,
Repent to Jesus or we will be dead.
Lost in the verses of revelations
Stuck in the notion of where is the son.
The Pentecostal revival the suffering.
