Holy bible, instrument of death, book of fools and ignorance
Without a trace, to the other side, faith in god atlas has died.
Aged and faded, Christianity, dying down in it's disease,
Heaven hated, never know his love, leave you where you have begun,

Testaments to the contradiction, death to you for the souls you save, unify his masses.
Sacrifice to the crucifixion; you deserved to die this way,
Go now your lord is dead.

Human failure, Christians crucified, on the cross of Christ design,
God's creation, rule this world with lies, and the truth will leave you blind,
No more Jesus, evil axe to grind, choose the path that we desire.
Christ religion, genocide is near watch your churches disappear.

Condescending ancient wisdom, solitude begot this day,
The light surpassing,
Without a place of worship, the sheep have been displaced,
Go now your lord is dead...
