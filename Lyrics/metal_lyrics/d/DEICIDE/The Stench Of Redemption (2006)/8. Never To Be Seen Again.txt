Where is your god in the hour of need, caught in their light and the scheming of things..
Pray to a lord of assumption you heal, what will you find when you see he's no real...
Baptized in lies and deceit, what is so hard to believe..

When was the last time you gave of yourself, not pushing bibles and preaching to hell...
Looking for souls in this world to possess, no reservation are promised in death,
Manifestation is pulling you in.... Never to be seen again...

Once it is known that god don't exist, undo the fist of hypocrisies grip,
They will all pay for the lies.....DIE..............

Heaven unseen when you fall to dead dreams, call unto god he won't answer their
screams...
Fell like a fool when your laid to your rest, now and forever resented in death..
Nowhere ground in my circle of friends, never to be seen again....

Once it is known that god don't exist, undo the fist of hypocrisies grip,
They will all pay for the lies.....DIE..............
