Dis-contention anger vented, overthrow them with rejection
Higher power in regression diabolical obsessions...
Over run with fornication, deadly sins manipulation
Disapproval by the faithful, lords sedition from the papal....
Murder god and Jesus pieces,
Everyone of them deleted..
Slit the throat of their religion,
Execute the lords sedition....
For the pain thou has caused this world your embodiment will confine you..
Truth now shines in the valley of death, when lambs lay down and all die to...
Decimate crucifixion
Congregate contradiction,
Conversion of the Christians,
Kill themselves with sedition,
Time after time they have failed with him, when try to hide what their up to...
Under thou can't protect them since the light of god is devalued
Stab to death his conviction
End their reign of decision
No more god and religion,
Burn in hell for sedition...
Anarchism to the vision, sanctimonious condition,
Veil of darkness has been lifted, testament of god resisted,
In deny of gods forgiveness, nullifying his religion,
Go to hell with all your rich's for the crime for his sedition...
Sacraments of light receded,
On the ground the cross defeated
Hanging priest with their confessions,
Free this world from their deception...
Slit the throat of their religion,... execute the lords sedition...
