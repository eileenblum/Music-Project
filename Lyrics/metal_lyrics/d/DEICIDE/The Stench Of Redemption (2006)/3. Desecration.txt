Children of Satan it's time to bring pain...
Stand by your side when the Christians engaged..
Angelic pastures is where we will war...
Once and for all we will settle the score.....

In the presence of god... Holy cross's inverted....
Retribution for what has been done by the church's
With no warning the word of the lord is in question...
Preservation of life ever more....
Desecration

Holy man tremble insight of dismay,
Temples on fire and graves are displaced
Wreck and define there realm of disgust....
Christian religion is turned into dust......

In the presence of god... Holy cross's inverted....
Retribution for what has been done by the church's
With no warning the word of the lord is in question...
Preservation of life ever more....

Worship the devil... and vanquish thy role.. Destroy the vision of god you were told,
Call on ones who invoke his disgrace cast out this spirit in Lucifer's name...
Christian religion lie dead and decay, killing and conquered then turned into slaves,
what does it matter and what is it worth, killing for Jesus to unify earth,
stand in the shadows and forced to believe, Willingly die for the light of the weak,
he has forsake you and left you to rot....
Mass desecration the killing of god,

Jesus defeated and followers fled...
Heaven in ruins impaling the dead...
Holy lord vanished to where he know not.....
No more religion or god to begot......
