I have never hated anyone as much as you..
Knife me once and then again and smile as you do...
Ignorance the guiding light in your hypocrisy...
From the time innocence were brainwashed to believe,
Failure as a father and a friend to all mankind..
On this day forever I will pray that you will die...
Crucified for the innocence... on the cross you hang,
Crucified for the innocence... back to god again...
Crucified for the innocence.... Truth cannot be seen...
Crucified for the innocence... You are dead to me.....
I don't need your love... Smite the lord above,
Get away from me, take your bible leave,
God is not the way, redirect the pain,
Trample on his cross... sacrilegion
Spoiled with likes of you and all that your about,
Tragedy is all I've known and blame it all on god,
All my life has been a maze of pain from what you done,
It is for the blasphemy I aimed against the son
I will never come to you or give my heart to thee...
When it is my turn to die I won't owe you a thing...
Crucified for the innocence... on the cross you hang,
Crucified for the innocence... back to god again...
Crucified for the innocence.... Truth cannot be seen...
Crucified for the innocence... You are dead to me.....

Follow in the path of thou receiving you in death,
Horrified by what is right enjoy the suffering,
Revel in catastrophe the gospel you resend,
Pestilent the lamb of god, irrelevant dement,
Testaments succumbing eve fall victim to the times,
It was always meant to be the end of Jesus Christ...
Crucified for the innocence... on the cross you hang,
Crucified for the innocence... back to god again...
Crucified for the innocence.... Truth cannot be seen...
Crucified for the innocence... You are dead to me.....

Glorified thy blood, free from sin become,
Falter to his death, off the cross defect,
Common sense of need, dead philosophy,
Not to live as on, sacrilegion....
