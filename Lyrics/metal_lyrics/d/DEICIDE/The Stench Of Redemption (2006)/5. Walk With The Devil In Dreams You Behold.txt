Lead....
Paid in blood, and gods love, you belong to me...
What you thought to be a myth now your destiny,
Don't believe that what you do, has condemned your soul,
You are one of us now and you'll spend it as you go...
Satan's blood on your hands and through him you will lead...
Blistered by the flames of hell your faith is on it's knees...
Blood in the pocket the wages of sin,
Evil has beckoned and you can't resist....
Where will you go when it comes to your end,
No going back to Jehovah again,
Banned by the lord for the blasphemous verse...
Tearing your heart with the unholy word...
Die...........Jesus you lied...
Worship the ground of the death of this son,
Live in his steps till the day he will come,
The light of his coming is shadowing greed,
Burning a hole through there righteous envy...
Decompose, hell we go, walk with the devil in dream you behold... forgot.....god?
Satan's work, hell on earth, you refuse to see..
Now what's what is where your at end you just can't believe...
Waller in misfortune is the path to gods mystique...
You belong to Satan now and for eternity...
Call to god, he is gone, he is dead to thee..
What you want is what you got Satan's blood money...

Blood in the pocket the wages of sin,
Evil has beckoned and you can't resist....
Where will you go when it comes to your end,
No going back to Jehovah again,
Banned by the lord for the blasphemous verse...
Tearing your heart with the unholy word...
Die...........Jesus you lied...
Worship the ground of the death of this son,
Live in his steps till the day he will come,
The light of his coming is shadowing greed,
Burning a hole through there righteous envy...
Decompose, hell we go, walk with the devil in dream you behold... fogot.....god?

Heavens scorned crowned in thorns, twisting your belief,
Reconcile with the lord indelibly relieved...
You will join us in darkness of infernos sleep...
Then you will discover that you worried for no need...
