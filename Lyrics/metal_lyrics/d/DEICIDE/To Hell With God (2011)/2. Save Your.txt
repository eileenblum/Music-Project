Father of death and the savior of sin, losing their grip on mankind
refuse to go and resistance is low, the time to say no has arrived
specter of god and redeemer of souls, lost in the splendor of hate
buried by priests for the act of perverse and the shadow it's brought on its faith
die

save your and god, spare me their love, follow the devil wherever I want
savior, defeat, thou has forsaken thee, died on the cross for a lie
your god is dead, Satan arise, vengeance invoke for all of time
reborn to bleed, casting the stone, heaven retreat, god is dethroned

save your and self, deal what you're dealt, death in the shadows of god and his wealth
waller in agony, onto the cross, just as him you will hang till you die
bleed for me, bleed for your soul, you want to bleed, bleed for us more
scream out unto your god, all is achieved

fall from your cross, guilt ways you down, no one believes that you killed your own son
fooling yourself, waiting on god for the sign that he wants you to die

father of death and the save your of sin, losing their grip on mankind
refuse to go and resistance is low, the time to say no has arrived
specter of god and redeemer of souls, lost in the splendor of hate
buried by priests for the act of perverse and the shadow it's brought on its faith
die
