Missions of death, spread upon earth
Preach in disguise of a god and his church
No compromise, believe or you die
Pray unto him and to follow his lies
Buy into Christ, he waits on you dead
Sin for the father again and again
Falter diminished, salvation enslaved
To hell with god and to all that he gave

Raise our glass to blasphemy and piss upon the altar
Servants of the lord above, ignore the new world order

Conquer us, unleash damnation
Go from here into temptation
Live in fear, for he forsakes you
Lies endeared for all creation

Festering death, forsaken my soul
Evil so ancient from elders of old
Waging this world with its book of disgust
Casting its will upon all who will trust
Protests, won't leave them to be
Spoiled by god and his beautiful scheme
Satan, insists on his being
Upon the earth and emplaced overseeing

Raise our glass to blasphemy and piss upon the altar
Servants of the lord above, ignore the new world order

Conquer us, unleash damnation
Go from here into temptation
Live in fear and no salvation
Lies endeared for all creation

To hell with god, you're damned to the edge of riddance
(To hell with god), to hell with god, you don't want to be forgiven
Put aside your crucifix
To hell with god, him and his son, do not believe the likes of a thief

To hell with god [3x]

Missions of death, spread upon earth
Preach in disguise of a god and his church
No compromise, believe or you die
Pray unto him and to follow his lies
Buy into Christ, he waits on you dead
Sin for the father again and again
Falter diminished, salvation enslaved
To hell with god and to all that he gave

Raise our glass to blasphemy and piss upon the altar
Servants of the lord above, ignore the new world order

Conquer us, unleash damnation
Go from here into temptation
Live in fear and no salvation
Lies endeared for all creation

To hell with god.
