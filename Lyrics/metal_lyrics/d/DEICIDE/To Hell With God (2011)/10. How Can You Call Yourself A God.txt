Full of shit, your fucked belief, take from me, i want your head
fill my soul with agony, pains me with a painful death
in your myth i hear your dread, hate you for so long
unbeneath the lord above, you are just a lie
lie!

never once to interfere, in the loss of human life
every time you're needed here, you are neither lost nor found
you are words that commandeer, making victims reappear
in the wake of your descent, nothing matters when you're dead
dead!

how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?

sacred words from days of old, don't support your views on death
in the list of all you gave, in exchange that we be blessed
then move on and never seen, leave us in catastrophe
thank you lord for what you've done, nothing but destroy your son
why?

how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?
