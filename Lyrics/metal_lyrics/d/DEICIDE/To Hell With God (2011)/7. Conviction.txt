A day of death upon the cross of deceit
impure with pleasure to bare witness to he
death calling you to Christ, human sacrifice, conviction

down the unseen, your belief, absent god, don't exist
go unto thou, from the dead, walk with him, he ain't there
love in retreat, uncompelled, feel no pain, pray unfelt
hate run in place, holy grace, contemplate, there's no god

the work of Jesus was the devil in fact
his miracles were nothing more than a trap
lies pinned upon the cross, crucify his false religion

Convictionâ¦ choking on the crucifix in his blood
Convictionâ¦ take the bullet for the love of a son
Convictionâ¦ from the cross into his kingdom you go
Convictionâ¦ no more bullshit from the likes of the lord

satanic visions bring the lord to his death
their own disenchantment of perversions confessed
caught, harrow in disgust, revel in your lost religion

Convictionâ¦ choking on the crucifix in his blood
Convictionâ¦ take the bullet for the love of a son
Convictionâ¦ from the cross into his kingdom you go
Convictionâ¦ no more bullshit from the likes of the lord
