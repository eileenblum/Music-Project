Conquer god and remove his thought, crush the lord above
bring upon our given right and rule what once was ours

Killâ¦spilling the blood of their priest
Backâ¦into the mouth of the beast
Deathâ¦bring them all down to their knees
Tellâ¦no one they have to believe
Dieâ¦demons of evil repel
Christâ¦dragging his cross back to hell
you will die

walk the realms of blasphemy, shadow in the night
sacrificial son of god, darkness is the light
suffrage for the sins of eve, not to understand
masticate the inner peace never known by man
angels of the realms of hate, predicate the plan
demons of the underworld cast you to the damned
wading through the agony, sanctified by god
destined to the crucifix, on the temple mound

Angels rebelâ¦.god defiant
Angels of hellâ¦Satan
Angels rebelâ¦fuck compassion
Angels of hellâ¦kill you

angels of hell

a revelation that has come to life, has got you by the balls
the word of god is no longer the way, his word has been dissolved

Killâ¦spilling the blood of their priest
Backâ¦into the mouth of the beast
Deathâ¦bring them all down to their knees
Tellâ¦no one they have to believe
Dieâ¦demons of evil repel
Christâ¦dragging his cross back to hell
You will die.
