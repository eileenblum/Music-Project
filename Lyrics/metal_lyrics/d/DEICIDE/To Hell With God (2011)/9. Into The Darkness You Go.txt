Putridness upon the earth, a waste to all mankind
days are numbered, mark thy word, in time you will subside

death, down to the flames of Belial, in through the gates of denial
screaming and begging for god, belong to Satan now

chained in torment, till the end of hell and heaven's reign
suffering in your damnation forever and a day
tribulation, destiny, the verge of your demise
memories of all you've done, to haunt your afterlife
hell, coming to fast to repel, into the pit of dispel
leaving the body and soul, into the darkness you go

uncalled by name destroy you, and naught exist no more
In life the light you followed, has left you in its horror
darken thee aspirations, upon the path you seek
the signs are all around you, dead is your god belief

Putridness upon the earth, a waste to all mankind
days are numbered, mark thy word, in time you will subside

death, down to the flames of Belial, in through the gates of denial
screaming and begging for god, belong to Satan now
