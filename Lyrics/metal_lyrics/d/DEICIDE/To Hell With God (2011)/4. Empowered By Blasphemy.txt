Reaping dispel, commence to kill, nothing can stop what you call is god's will
breathe in the ill, let upon earth, serpents of Satan from fire return

killing the lambs, rites unperformed, rivers run red with the blood of their lord
pleading of prays, cling to the dead, bring back the Christ to be slaughtered again

empowered by blasphemy, raise the gates of hell
end of time upon the earth, your lord of lords befell

caught up in death, back to the blade, Christians destroyed and devoured in rage
born of the devil, soulless insane, spit from the fire to feast on the saved
behind the light, thorn of the blessed, never to bow before god to confess
heathen to some, shadowing fiend, appointed by Satan to crush his mistake

empowered by blasphemy, raise the gates of hell
end of time upon the earth, your lord of lords befell

bleed this world of christian blood, revelation dead
awaken from your prophecy and tear them all to shreds

turn the cheek and drink his blood, suffer in defeat
fall from grace and beg before your mortal enemies

tear out your heart, I will never pray,
fucked and forgave, don't believe what you say
where's your god
liar! he is dead
liar! blasphemy
liar! heaven sent
liar! prey unto god, fool you to death

tear out your heart, I will never pray,
fucked and forgave, don't believe what you say
where's your god
liar! he is dead
liar! blasphemy
liar! heaven sent
liar! prey unto god, fool you to death
