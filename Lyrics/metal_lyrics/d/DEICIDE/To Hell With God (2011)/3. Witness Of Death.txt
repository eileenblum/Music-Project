Fuck your gods conviction, stare it to the ground
Kill the mother Mary, crush you under thou

go to hymn to worship him, find your way around thy kingdom
not a friend, never said, once you're in the shrine of the Christ denied
die, die, die
witness of death

the kingdom has you in control, a slave of their incest
thy throne in which they stand on thee a fable to detest
untold and underneath the truth, they want us all to die

go against his vision, once you're in you're in
door to door religion has you till the end
Cradled in a righteous sin, defiling the light of your own belief
Christ unmused, his birth refused, scoff at his claim as the son of god
await with death as something blessed, leave behind a world of the unconfessed
A setting sun, it will be done, god obsessed, witness of death

go to hymn to worship him, find your way around thy kingdom
not a friend, never said, once you're in the shrine of the Christ denied
die
witness of death
