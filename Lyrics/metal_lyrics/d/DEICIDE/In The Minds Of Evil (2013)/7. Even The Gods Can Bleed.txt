I am the one spreading plague and disease
God cannot hear you, he is deaf to your pleas
Holy despair, overthrowing the lord
One with the devil all faith is destroyed

The end has begun, behold thy name

Defacing their idols and breaking their laws
Murdering Christ as I cripple the cross
No resurrection, dethroned Nazarene
Prayers go unanswered, succumb to defeat

Fallen from grace, bring an end to all things
Heavens disciples will fall to my rage
Devoured by faith, the illusion of god
Crucify Christ to the unholy one

The end has begun, behold thy name

Death to your god, the end has begun
The savior descend, divine suffering,
Invite the unknown despised and dethroned,
to fold in defeat, even the gods can bleed

The end has begun, behold thy name
Repent unto thee, even the gods can bleed

I am the one spreading plague and disease
God cannot hear you, he is deaf to your pleas
Holy despair, overthrowing the lord
One with the devil all faith is destroyed
