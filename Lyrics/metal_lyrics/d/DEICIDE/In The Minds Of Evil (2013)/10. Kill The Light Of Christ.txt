Death unfold, bleeding from my eyes,
Damn this soul, to the other side,
Conscious of sin, from this hell we're in,
Done with this life, brought here just to die,

Kill the light of Christ, truth is ours to find,
Trapped inside this shrine, all that lives will die

Grace of god, drowning in my blood,
All behold, kill us one by one
Anger betray, stifled and deceived, want of the lord, that we will believe...

Kill the light of christ, truth is ours to find
Trapped inside this shrine, flawed in his design,
Waiting till my time, all that lives will die

At the end of hope and loss the body will decease, destiny
Promising the afterlife to ease our suffering, suffering

Step into the outer reaches of the great unknown, all will die
Defect and deficient is the image of the lord...the lord

Kill the light of christ, truth is ours to find,
Trapped inside this shrine, all that lives will die,

Left untold, to suffice his lie,
Spirit world, where we cross that line,
When it begins, will we live again,
Mired in death, into the abyss

Kill the light of christ, truth is ours to find,
Trapped inside this shrine, flawed in his design,
No one will survive, all that lives will die
