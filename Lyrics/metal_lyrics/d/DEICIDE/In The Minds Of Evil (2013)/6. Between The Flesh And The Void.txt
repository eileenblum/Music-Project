Death, I wait the pain
A stare that's cold and burns my eyes
Victim, deception
Death to your shrine

Those I've lost appear before me
The end of life, the air turning colder
I close my eyes and brace for eternity
Prevailing thoughts, a vanishing soul

Death, I wait the pain
A stare that's cold and burns my eyes
Victim, deception
Death to your shrine

My body decays, the skin falls away
Death to myself
Between the flesh and the void,
Between the flesh and the void

Death, I wait the pain
A stare that's cold and burns my eyes
Victim, deception
Death to your shrine

My body decays, the skin falls away
Death to myself
Between the flesh and the void,
No coming back, exit the soul
Imprisoned remain,
Between the flesh and the void.
