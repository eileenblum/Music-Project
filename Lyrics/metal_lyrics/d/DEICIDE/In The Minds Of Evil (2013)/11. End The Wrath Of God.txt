From the creation and beginning of man
With no explanation to his biblical plan
No longer needed for your god to exist
The call of temptation that no one can resist

Nullify resistance to control our lives
Sterilized creation, born to bear your lie
Mortified in madness by a man made god
The solitude of sadness the father and the son

End the wrath of god, End the wrath of god

There have been no prophets that speak the word of god
There is no salvation, delusions from above
Book of contradiction, the one that I despise
In the words of truth I speak, the lords of lords will die...

End the wrath of god...

Nullify resistance to control our lives
Sterilized creation, born to bear your lie
Mortified in madness by a man made god
The solitude of sadness the father and the son

Book of contradiction, the one that I despise
In the words of truth I speak, the lords of lords will die...
End the wrath of god, End the wrath of god
Book of contradiction, the one that I despise
In the words of truth I speak, the lords of lords will die...
