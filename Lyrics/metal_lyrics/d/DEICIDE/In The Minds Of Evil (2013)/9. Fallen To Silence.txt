Life of disgust, his fable you trust, a fool, you abide,
Hailing his vengeance and stripped of all senses, for god... you die,

Fallen to silence
Death and defiance
Destroying the feeble
Banished by evil

Defraud the meek their followers weak, and cower at his sign,
Truth of contention, deceit with intention, the heart, of the blind

Revival and crosses at one with your losses, and wonder, his lie
Unright with the facts, and there's no coming back, the light, denied

Fallen to silence
Death and defiance
Destroying the feeble
Banished by evil

Soul is consumed, the coming of doom, the bible you revive,
Blasphemy blessing, is faint and distressing, his words of Christ.

Blind to our death your creation a mess, prayers for your need are denied, blind to despair and your lord does not care, watching this world as it dies

Lack of reflection, with no interaction, the world will die,
You're only a ghost and refuse to invoke, the power of your Christ...

Fallen to silence
Death and defiance
Destroying the feeble
Banished by evil

Death to religion, a blind contradiction of life defied,
The cross of deception and book of infection the truth a lie.
