Failure, claim to fame, abject the soul, ending your own dream, you closed that door!
The end of time has come for you and him are done,
Dissension has begun the misery of one.

Liars, petty thieves, out for their own, sadness turn to grief, the truth now known.
Now take your place with god, unburdened by your thought,
You got just what you want, a life of pain and loss.

Dooming oneself for one selfish belief,
Only yourself by yourself was deceived, nobody wants to remember your name,
Only what if's now remain in your place, seen for the fraud that you put on display,
Live with your actions while digging your grave, choke on the truth, slap to the face,
Life without you is a much better place.

A wish of death, no hope for happiness,
The flame of wealth, no more of yours to delve,
Concurred defeat is all you'll ever reach,
Embraced your hell, as long as time will tell.

Failure, claim to fame, abject the soul, ending your own dreams, you closed that door!
The end of time has come for you and him are done,
Dissension has begun the misery of one.
