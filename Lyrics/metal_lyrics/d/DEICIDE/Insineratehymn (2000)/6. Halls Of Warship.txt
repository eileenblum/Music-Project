They want to witness the arrival of the lord
And the destruction he has promised to us all
Their sick conviction to the ending of the world
Live in prediction he will soon be back on Earth
They think they are the only ones who will be spared
The kingdom of Jehovah isn't really there...

Halls of warship burn, until you touch the ground
Ignited by deceit, your will of god is misperceived
Where's the virtue in the riddles of a dying king
Exiled in defeat, the end of their regime

They know who rules this world, a toll they sue to scare
Brainwash the witnesses to think he's coming here
Their only mission is the pending fear of god
Given permission to pursue a life without
A grim existence for the offspring that they breed
Return to Abraham and let us live in peace

Halls of warship burn, until you touch the ground
Ignited by deceit, your will of god is misperceived
Where's the virtue in the riddles of a dying king
Exiled in defeat, the end of their regime
