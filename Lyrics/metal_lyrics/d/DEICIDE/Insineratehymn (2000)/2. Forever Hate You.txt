No despair anymore, your image it is diseased
I am a knife in your back, a constant reminder of what it could be
You are doomed to repeat all the things that you do
Right decision, to be true to myself and forever hate you

Misery from the time you were born
Repeat the past as you've always before
Reap it, want no part of your lies
Keep your mistruthts and remove you from sight
Guilty from the start of the game
As like before with the ending the same
Hatred has you trapped in its womb
Never will I have compassion for you

And you!

I am me and I do anything that I please
Unforgiven, you're a waste of one's time to this servant of hell
You're confused if you thought I was loyal and true
My decision to undo what is done and forever hate you

Misery from the time you were born
Repeat the past as you've always before
Reap it, want no part of your lies
Keep your mistruthts and remove you from sight
Guilty from the start of the game
As like before with the ending the same
Hatred has you trapped in its womb
Never will I have compassion for you
