Come to me Nazarene
I've been looking for thee
No escaping from it
Swarmed in evil darkness

My nails are in your hands and feet
The word expelled, the light deceased
Prophet assume to save from sin
To hell with you - Suffer Again

I do not fear you christ, listen to me
Whenever you're ready, you know where I'll be
Worn out with dread by disgrace and disgust
Cut off your head and I'll bathe in your blood

Pray the second coming
Bring you only one thing
Do you think I am fooled?
I'll tear your heart in two

The time is now, he wants us dead
Without delay, I take his head
Prophet foretell, this is the end
Now go to hell - Suffer Again
