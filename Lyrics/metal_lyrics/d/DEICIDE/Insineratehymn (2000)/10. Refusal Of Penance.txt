Heard that I found jesus, when I do he's dead
Endless speculation, why would I repent?
If I find salvation and the book of hymns
Their annihilation will not get me in
Expose god religion to my dying death
Cannot be forgiven by your holiness
Will I learn my lesson, bare their sympathy?
Answer to your question - that ain't happening

Bow before no god that cannot be seen
And wants to show mercy on people like me
Facing their judgment to settle the score
Refusal of penance, I laugh at your lord

Grace of god refusal, evil to the end
Instrument of Satan, I have always been
Challenge my conviction to the Baphomet
Smash his crucifixion right against your head
Contents under pressure explode, kill your ass
Total devastation in the aftermath
I behold no penance, only dignity
In hell with Lord Satan for eternity

Bow before no god that cannot be seen
And wants to show mercy on people like me
Facing their judgment to settle the score
Refusal of penance, I laugh at your lord
