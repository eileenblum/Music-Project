Where's your god when you need him?
Beware, he's deceiving
Intimidation, revelation
Wipe my ass on its pages
Fuck your god with good reason
In contempt, holy treason
I desecrate thee, it's amazing
Open wound, he forsakes you

Satan comin', angel shun 'em
Prophet's bludgeoned under his rule
Reach out to hymn, not there again
Free us from this, Satan live

You've been robbed of your spirit
Ain't god's love so endearing
Incrimination, contemplation
Hopeless path of damnation
End of days, you're afraid of
And you thought he forgave us
Infuriating, devastating
Cut your throat, Satan's waiting

Satan comin', angel shun 'em
Prophet's bludgeoned under his rule
Reach out to hymn, not there again
Free us from this, Satan live
