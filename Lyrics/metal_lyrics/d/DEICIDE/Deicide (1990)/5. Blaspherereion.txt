Bleeding death, undead, broke the seal Suhrim
Desecrate, evil ghost Thoth freed him
Mass destruction, ended lives, blasphemation, you will die

[Pre-chorus:]
Darkest one, bleeding death, from beyond
Death be done, no regression, unforbidden
You will die - it's been written

[Chorus:]
Die - BLASPHEREREION
Die - BLASPHEREREION

Vicious wrath Adar, tortured past rendered
Odious evil, elder death, feast us
God's construction, holy doom
Don't believe, you're consumed

[Pre-chorus / Chorus]

Lord chaos, death, save us
Kill human kind, life was denied
Lord black death, Thoth, confess
Send to desecrate, lord blasphemate

[Lead - Eric]

[Pre-chorus / Chorus]
