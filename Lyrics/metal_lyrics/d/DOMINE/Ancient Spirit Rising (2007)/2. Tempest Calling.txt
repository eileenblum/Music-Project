I talk to the tempest, in front of me
Facing her dark deep eyes, I am ready to scream

Into her stormy eyes, My fears I behold
Terror will strike me down to the floor

Over and over I long for the day
When I can find the meanings of my life
I descend into the maelstrom of my darkest side
No one can hear me while I ask aloud to the face of this horror

[chorus]
What does it take to be a man, harder than before
to cry your tears and not afraid to let them show
What does it take to face your inner demons, with no words left untold
What does it take to be a stronger man (when the Tempest in raging on)
What does it take to be a real man
Tempest calling now

I talk to the Tempest, for the last time
Standing in front of her, my arms open wide
She opens her jaws now and flashes her teeth
"Son, it's my turn now to speak"

Over and over, day after day
I fed on the power of your inner self
I am the maelstrom of your darkest side
I have no answer and you will not care
When I will crash you and wipe you away

[chorus]
What does it take to be a man, harder than before
to cry your tears and not afraid to let them show
What does it take to face your inner demons, with no words left untold
What does it take to be a stronger man (when the Tempest in raging on)
What does it take to be a real man
Tempest calling now

Everything changes and all stays the same
Don't look for a reason, it doesn't matter anyway
You must face the Tempest, don't try to step aside
When the storm rages harder, it's your time to fight

[chorus]
What does it take to be a man, harder than before
to cry your tears and not afraid to let them show
What does it take to face your inner demons, with no words left untold
What does it take to be a stronger man (when the Tempest in raging on)
What does it take to be a real man
Tempest calling now

Tempest Calling!
