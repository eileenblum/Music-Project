By the sacred laws of nature I am damned
By the Highest Court I was found guilty
Unforgiving judgement I could not escape
Terrible the curse cast upon me

[pre-chorus]
No one can or will know the answer
why on the horizon I ride

[chorus]
Sky Rider - let my fire rip the darkest night
Ghost Rider - for eternity condemned to ride
Sky Rider - for my sins my spirit stays earthbound
Hell Rider - thundering my way across the sky

No one can stand in my way
No one can lay my remains in sacred ground to rest

If there is a heaven, I could not be more far from it
If there's really a hell. I'll be glad to reach it
For everywhere I go all I bring is misery
I can not be granted my passage to a new life

[pre-chorus]
No one can or will know the answer
why on the horizon I ride

[chorus]
Sky Rider - let my fire rip the darkest night
Ghost Rider - for eternity condemned to ride
Sky Rider - for my sins my spirit stays earthbound
Hell Rider - thundering my way across the sky

No one can stop me to ride
No one can lay my remains in sacred ground to die

No one will know the answer
No one can see the way to set my soul free
I'm forever bound to be...

[chorus]
Sky Rider - let my fire rip the darkest night
Ghost Rider - for eternity condemned to ride
Sky Rider - for my sins my spirit stays earthbound
Hell Rider - thundering my way across the sky

No one can stop me to ride
No one can lay my remains in sacred ground to die!
