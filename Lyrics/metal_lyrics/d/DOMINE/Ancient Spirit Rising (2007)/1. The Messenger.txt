By the first rays of dawn, I rise up by the cold morning light,
And I'm on my way
Soon the sound of my horse will be breaking the silence of a  brand new day

No one can see my face as I hide in the dark of my jet black cloak
Nor a man or a child could ever know why I ride by their homes

For I bring the truth to all who will
Be wise enough to hear the words I speak
But no one seems to believe

[chorus]
Call me madman, I bring you madness
Call me seer, I bring you fears
I am the Messenger, I am the messenger
No one believes but I speak the truth

Tragedy is what all mankind will surely reach, It's meant to be
Hear my words, I warn you all of the coming end,  you must believe

For I received a gift of prophecy
A mission I must fulfil, Chosen to bring the word that no man will believe

[chorus]
Call me madman, I bring you madness
Call me seer, I bring you fears
I am the Messenger, I am the messenger
No one believes but I speak the truth

Every day life is passing me by
Far away I long for the day I will finally
Find peace from all this refrain
But now I must ride on my way

[chorus]
Call me madman, I bring you madness
Call me seer, I bring you fears
I am the Messenger, I am the messenger
No one believes but I speak the truth
I am the Messenger, I am the messenger
You will believe when death reaps you all
