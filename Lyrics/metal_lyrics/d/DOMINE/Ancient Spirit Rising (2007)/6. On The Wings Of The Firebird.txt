I want to climb the highest peaks of the Universe
To reach the tallest mountains of the moon
I set my soul on fire, transcend this world of nothing
Imagination running mad to the extreme

I want to fly on the wings of the Firebird

I need to burn the distance, leave this old world below
My flesh is soon consumed in a crazy smoke
And endless source of power, eternal fire I'm breathing
My voice as a burning tongue the sun is licking

[pre-chorus]
So I summon the fire elementals, the ones I'm keeping inside
I call for my imagination to rise and shine, to make my life...

[chorus]
Burn! Burn! The tempest of fire is cleansing my soul
Burn! Burn! The wind of volcano is scorching my core
You can not stop me when I'm flying high and
Higher on the wings of the Firebird

[pre-chorus]
So I summon the fire elementals, the ones I'm keeping inside
I call for my imagination to rise and shine
to awake and make my life...

[chorus]
Burn! Burn! The tempest of fire is cleansing my soul
Burn! Burn! The wind of volcano is scorching my core
You can not stop me when I'm flying high and
Higher on the wings and...
Burn! Burn! The tempest of fire is cleansing my soul
Burn! Burn! The wind of volcano is scorching my core
You can not stop me when I'm flying high and
Higher on the wings of the Firebird
