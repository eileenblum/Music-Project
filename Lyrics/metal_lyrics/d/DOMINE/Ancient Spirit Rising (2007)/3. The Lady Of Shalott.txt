[I. She has a sad lovely face]

Slowly she moves through the willows
Silent she reaches for the boat
She has a sad lovely face
She is the Lady of Shalott

Sail on

When the mirror is cracking and the white mist surrounds her
All things must go, all things must go
A new journey's beginning to a new way of being but

[chorus]
Portal of Infinity, open wide to let my spirit in
Portal of Infinity, take me back to where all life begins
Never to look back, never to feel pain again
Forever to live
Never to look back, never to feel pain again
Forever free

I've finally find my way back home - Infinity
I've finally find my way back home - Eternity
I've finally find my way back home - Infinity
I've finally find my way back home,
re-united with myself

Portal of Infinity, open wide to let my spirit in
Portal of Infinity, take me back to where all life begins
Portal of Infinity, now I know what I find on the other side
Portal of Infinity, by this blinding light a new legend is born
Never to look back, never to feel pain again,
Forever to live
Never to look back, never to feel pain again
Forever free

I've finally find my way back home - Infinity
I've finally find my way back home - Eternity
I've finally find my way back home - Infinity
I've finally find my way back home, re-united with myself
