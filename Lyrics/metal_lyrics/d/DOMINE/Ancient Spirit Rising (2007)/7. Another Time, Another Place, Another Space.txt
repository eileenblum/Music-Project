I'm turning back the Wheel of Time
to try to steal some more
Of passing hours, days and nights, now precious as bright gold
And as the Wheel is moving slowly, in never ending grind
The time has come to make the change as things are bound to die

[pre-chorus]
Oh, I just have to light the darkness of my soul
So I can find a place to hide and reach my final goal
Forget the life I led so far and leave it all behind
And in the dawn of a million stars who knows what I will find

[chorus]
In another time, in another place, in another space
In another time, in another place, in another space

Lake comets fighting in the sky, a blast of shining stars
Two different souls collide, at last to re-unite as one
I'm heading back into future time to find where I belong
The Wheel will end his final turn, I complete my return

[pre-chorus]
Oh, I just have to light the darkness of my soul
So I can find a place to hide and reach my final goal
Forget the life I led so far and leave it all behind
And in the dawn of a million stars who knows what I will find

[chorus]

We live through space and time
We want more life and time
We want more, more, more
