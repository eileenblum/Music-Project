I am the one and only man who can lead you to the secret gates
I know the way to burn them down
With my return I will bring doom to them all

A Dreaming City ruled the world, arrogant men acting like gods
They played with life and death for ten thousand years
A court of ghosts in marble halls dance at the sound of death's call
In mind and spirit they're already dead

[pre-chorus]
And so I take my life in my hands, make my own decision
I will embrace my Fate
So I stand

[chorus]
I stand - I stand over my fears
I stand - Wipe away all my tears
I stand - for what is right to be done
After the fall - I stand alone

I am the one and only man who can lead you to the secret gates
This game of pride has gone too far, I lived my life as an outcast

[pre-chorus]
And so I took my life in my hands, made my own decision
did what was right to be done
My Fate fell upon me but now I rule my destiny
As King of Ruins at last
I stand

[chorus]
I stand - I stand over my fears
I stand - Wipe away all my tears
I stand - for what is right to be done
After the fall - I stand alone

[repeat]
