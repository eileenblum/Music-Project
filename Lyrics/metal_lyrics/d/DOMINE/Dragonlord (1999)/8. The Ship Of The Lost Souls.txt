Your faith is gone, all hopes are lost 
Now all your dreams lie broken on the ground 
Now no more fears, you've cried out all your tears 
and the days pass before your eyes 

[chorus] 
You are the one who decided to go 
You are the one who decided to sail 
Forever on the Ship of the Lost Souls 

From the Shores of Death a ship will come 
Born of Chaos, born of Ancient Night 
Forever to sail, to reek havoc and destruction 
Never to be pacified, forever to fight 

Fate has turned a man of peace 
into a warrior thus taking his own life 
Your body may have been your own 
but your soul belongs to them 
Your blood mixing with the water 

[chorus] 
You are the one who decided to go 
You are the one who decided to sail 
Forever on the Ship of the Lost Souls 

[guitar solo] 

Don't hope for mercy 
For them there is no tragedy in Death 

Staring at Death with bone dry eyes 
Your fallen prey floating on the water 
Until the rain will come down 
to purify the evil you left behind 

[chorus] 
You are the one who decided to go 
You are the one who decided to sail 
Forever on the Ship of the Lost Souls
