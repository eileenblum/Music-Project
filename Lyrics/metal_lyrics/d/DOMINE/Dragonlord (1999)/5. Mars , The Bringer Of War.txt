The Winds Of Mars are blowing strong again. 
It's time to wage War once more, to feed my blade of black steel 
with enemy's lifeblood. 
Arioch, Mighty Lord of Chaos, Duke of Hell, 
Aid me now ! I give you blood and souls. 
But I know that tomorrow I will look upon the final remains of my empire, 
I will look upon my face in the mirror and realise my sin.
