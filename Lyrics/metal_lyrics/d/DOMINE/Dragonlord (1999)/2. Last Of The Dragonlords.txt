I hear The Storm calling my name 
The ancient call of the blood in my veins 
My father's voice screams from the grave 
It's the sign that my fate is at hand 
These ancient halls have seen Emperors born, rule and die 
From my Ruby Throne I rise when it's time to fulfil my destiny 

[Chorus]
Last Of The Dragonlords of Melnibone 
Born to rule 'til the End of Time 

Last Of The Dragonlords of Melnibone 
Born to rule the Kingdom where Mighty Dragons fly so high 

[Solos] 

[Chorus] 
Last Of The Dragonlords of Melnibone 
Born to rule 'til the End of Time 

Last Of The Dragonlords of Melnibone 
Born to rule the Kingdom where Mighty Dragons fly so high
