They come from the Young Kingdoms 
with new hopes and ancient hate 
By thousands they ride to the battlefield 
I can feel the ground shake 
I must rise from my throne 
Champion of Destiny and Pride 
I must leave these ancient halls 
with Stormbringer at my side 

[Chorus] 
For I am the Bringer of War 
I am The Bearer Of The Black Sword 
and my name will be known to all 
Lord Elric of the Bright Empire of Melnibone 
The Dragonlord 

Who will need the illusion 
of new love and new found faith 
When everything around you 
lay destroyed and dead 

I am doomed to walk again 
on the Path Of Destruction 
I'm the last of my Race 
and I must fight my final battle 

[Chorus] 
For I am the Bringer of War 
I am The Bearer Of The Black Sword 
and my name will be known to all 
Lord Elric of the Bright Empire of Melnibone 
The Dragonlord 

[Chorus] 
For I am the Bringer of War 
I am The Bearer Of The Black Sword 
and my name will be known to all 
Lord Elric of the Bright Empire of Melnibone 
The Dragonlord
