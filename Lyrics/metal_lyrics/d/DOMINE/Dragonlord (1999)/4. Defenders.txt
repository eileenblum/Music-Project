We are the Royal Guard of Steel 
We are The Loyal and Strong 
We are The Knights of The Sacred Sound 
We are forevermore 
We will stand by the Oath we swore 
Long ago when the Gods chose their knights 

We are the Keepers of the Flame 
We feel no shame or fault 
We are the Holy Soldiers of Iron 
We are forevermore 

We will stand by the Oath we swore 
Long ago when the Gods chose their knights 

[Chorus] 

We are Strong, We are the Ones 
We will stand for what we believe 
And forever we will be 

We are Strong, We are the Ones 
Fighting for Truth and Honour 
And forever we will be 
Metal Defenders 

Fight, we will fight 
We will fight forevermore 
Fight, we will fight 
We will fight forevermore 

We will stand our ground, we are glory bound 
We will ride through the darkness with honour and pride 
Together we unite, you must choose your side 
We will crush all the infidels with our might 


We will stand our ground, we are glory bound 
We will ride through the darkness with honour and pride 
Together we unite, you must choose your side 
For We will fight, fight, fight, fight! 

[Chorus] 

We are Strong, We are the Ones 
We will stand for what we believe 
And forever we will be 

We are Strong, We are the Ones 
Fighting for Truth and Honour 
And forever we will be 
Metal Defenders
