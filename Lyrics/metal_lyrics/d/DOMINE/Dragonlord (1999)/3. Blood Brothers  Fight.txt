Hundreds of thousand of warriors march 
Lies-hiding promises of great treasures 
[Chorus]
Death is riding at their side 
and grinding their cold steel 
He's covering the truth 
This is Blood Brothers' Fight 

Just one blow and the fight is begun 
They don't understand the blood 
they spill is just the same 

[Chorus] 
They are blinded by a lie 
They don't know even why 
so many men must die 
This is Blood Brothers' Fight 

Oh father, fighting once again 
but this time our swords are crossed 
We are face to face 
I've learned that Victory 
is much stronger than blood ties 
So now one of us must die! 

[guitar solo] 

They don't understand 
the blood they spill is just the same 
They don't know why 
so many men are meant to die 
This is the great Blood Brothers' Fight 

[guitar solo] 

Hundreds of thousands of warriors have died 
Darkness is falling on the battle ground 

No one is left alive today 
to say "never again" 
to spread around the tale 
The Tale of Blood Brothers' Fight
