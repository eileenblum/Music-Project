[I) The Dawn Of Steel]

[instrumental]

[II) The Pipes Of War]

This is The Story for centuries untold 
On a misty morning at the break of dawn 
Out of the night as shadows of Doom 
Black armours shine in the cold morning light 

They come from the mountains, they come from the seas 
They come with a purpose, a power to wield 
They're ready to die on the battlefield 
They're ready to die for the Sword the Gods forged long ago 

A sword is laying on an altar of gold 
inside a circle of magical stones 
Thousands of Warriors behold the Emperor 
As he steps inside the circle offering a sacrifice 

They come to kill, They come to fight 
Armies are raised one against the other 
Brave men are lead to death like lambs to the slaughter 
All of this just for one man's greed and pride 

[III) The Sacrifice Chant]

[Pre Chorus] 

Oh Mighty Gods of Chaos! 
Let the Power descend from the sky 
Give me the Ultimate Weapon 
I claim what is mine by right 

I offer the Blood of the Nations 
Souls as a sacrifice 
We come from afar 
from our City Of Light for 

[Chorus] 
The Battle for the Great Silver Sword 
The Battle for the Great Silver Sword 
The Battle for the Great Silver Sword 
The Battle for the Great Silver Sword 

[IV) War (The Tyrant's Prayer)] 

We come here from far away 
From the Mountains and from the Seas 
I come to fulfil my Fate 
leading men to their demise 

Brother against brother 
Until no one is left alive 
Many souls will sleep in hell tonight 
Now it's time for war! 

[V) Sword Fight] 

[guitar solo]

Fearless in a haze of bloodlust 
Riding at breakneck speed 
Armies clash one against the other 
A sea of blood flooding the field 

And as the thunder roars in the distance 
The setting sun paints a crimson sky 
And as the Tyrant raise the sword 
The Silver Sword is Broken, oh no! 

[VI) The Sword Is Broken] 

[pre chorus] 

Oh Mighty Gods of Chaos! 
No Power descended from the sky 
I craved for the Ultimate Weapon 
I claimed what was mine by right 

I offered the Blood of the Nations 
Souls as a sacrifice 
I came from afar 
from my City Of Light to die for... 

[Chorus] 

The Battle for the Great Silver Sword 
The Battle for the Great Silver Sword 
The Battle for the Great Silver Sword 
The Battle for the Great Silver Sword 

[VII) The Sunset Of Steel]
