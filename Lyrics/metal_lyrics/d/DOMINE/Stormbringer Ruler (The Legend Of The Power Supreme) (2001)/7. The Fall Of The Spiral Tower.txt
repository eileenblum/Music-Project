I'm running up a thousand steps
An endless stairway to another plane
I must be fast, my time is short
I hear the cracking sound of a million stones

I must climb the staircase of the highest tower
where at the end, a blaze of flame shall burn
Run to the doorway that brings me back to my domain
Run through the fire and take my leap of faith

[Chorus]

It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe

I am a traveler between the worlds
My art is ancient and kept unknown
I'm granted passage to different realms
Bust I must be back on Solstice Eve

I must climb the staircase of the highest tower
where at the end, a blaze of flame shall burn
Run to the doorway that brings me back to my domain
Run through the fire and take my leap of faith

[Chorus]

It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe

The fall of the Spiral Tower
Spiral Tower of the Universe

The Twilight Tower between domains
Is now collapsing and nothing will remain
I must be fast, my time is short
I walk through the portal once and for all

I must climb the staircase of the highest tower
where at the end, a blaze of flame shall burn
Run to the doorway that brings me back to my domain
Run through the fire and take my leap of faith

[Chorus]

It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
It's falling
Black tower of centuries old
Spiral Tower of the Universe
