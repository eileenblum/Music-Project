Wheel of Time is turning
The cycle is now complete
For me, Eternal Champion,
It's time to lay down and rest

[Chorus]

I pray to the gods to give me peace
And to see you again on a beautiful sunny day
No, don't cry for me my friends
For one day we will be as one
And I will meet you again
In the dawn of a new day

Dark gives way to light
I see earth's new life begin
Cold in her beauty
A new world where I don't belong

[Chorus]

I pray to the gods to give me peace
And to see you again on a beautiful sunny day
No, don't cry for me my friends
For one day we will be as one
And I will meet you again
In the dawn of a new day

All is lost
All is lost
All is lost
All is lost

Mother my time is come
Father my days are through

It's dawning
It's dawning
A new day is calling

Dawn of a new day

Dawn of a new day
Dawn of eternity

[Chorus]

I pray to the gods to give me peace
And to see you again on a beautiful sunny day
No, don't cry for me my friends
For one day we will be as one
And I will meet you again
In the dawn of a new day
I will meet you again
In the dawn of a new day
