The runes are singing the truth aloud, their riddle is now clear
I'm just a pawn in the hands of a fate, finally revealed
I stare deep inside my soul to find the reasons why
But for all these years I always knew that
I was born to fight

All I've loved I've lost
Left with no one to share the bitter cost
King of a race that ruled the world
Doomed to suffer and bring the final war

Stormbringer Ruler

Lord Elric, Dragon Lord, Prince of the Dreaming City
Stormbringer, his runesword, forged in burning hellfire

Albino dictator, last king of the Dragon Isle
Commander of dragons, I reigned with pride

'til I saw my Fate

In visions that haunt me at night
Dreams of a time soon to come
I bear the Stealer of Souls

[Chorus]

I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword, Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword, Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword, Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword,
- Stormbringer ruler - Lord Elric

Riding all over the world in search for the signs
With fear they call me the White Wolf with crimson eyes
A sword that will shine with my bone white face
in the moonlight
Bounded by hellforged chains, I am one with the sword

Mighty Stormbringer
Give me your power
Give me strength
As you take more souls

The runes are now silent, I know what must be done
To sound the Horn of Fate and let a new age rise
I must keep on fighting to keep the Cosmic Balance
For Chaos, for Law but in my dreams

I just want to be free
Free of all cosmic designs
Free of all sorrow and fears
Free of the Stealer of Souls but

[Chorus]

I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword, Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword, Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword, Lord Elric
I'm the Bearer of the Black Sword,
- Stormbringer ruler - Lord Elric
