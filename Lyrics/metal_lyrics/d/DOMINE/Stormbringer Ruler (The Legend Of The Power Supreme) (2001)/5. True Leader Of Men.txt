Long live the Fremen Warriors!!!

"Hidden away in the desert
The prophecy is becoming real
A man will come, the messiah
Who will lead us to true freedom"

Oh, my time has come
I'm the one you are waiting for
I will lead to victory
The universe super being of planet Dune

I will bring death eternal
And my name is a killing word

I am the hand of God
Who will lead you all to true freedom

Oh, my time has come
I'm the one you are waiting for
I will take the Water of Life
The Spice will let the sleeper rise

Long live the fighters, holy warriors
Follow me now! And we will take control
Master of the universe, ruler of infinity
I summon the sand worms, I unite the Freman and

[Chorus]

Ride like a leader of men, true leader that ride
Like a leader of men, true leader of men
Like a leader of men, true leader that ride
Like a leader of men, true leader of men

Long live the fighters, holy warriors
Follow me now! And we will take control
Master of the universe, ruler of infinity
I summon the sand worms, I unite the Freman and

[Chorus]

Ride like a leader of men, true leader that ride
Like a leader of men, true leader of men
Like a leader of men, true leader that ride
Like a leader of men, true leader of men

I ride like a leader of men
