I've travelled for far too long on a quest for peace
In many battles won and lost
Still I've found no release

But now I'm here, at the Edge of Time

[Chorus]

Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I'm the Champion of Doom Eternal

Doomed to herald destruction

Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I'm the Champion of Doom Eternal
Doomed to herald destruction

Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I'm the Champion of Doom Eternal
Doomed to herald destruction

Horn of Fate, Bringer of the End
I must serve my destiny
And sound with all my strength, the Horn of Fate

Horn of Fate

"...So let it be done..."
