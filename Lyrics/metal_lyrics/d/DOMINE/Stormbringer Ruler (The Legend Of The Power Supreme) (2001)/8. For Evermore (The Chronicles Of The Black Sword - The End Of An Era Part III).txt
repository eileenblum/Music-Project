One last beat of this weary heart of mine and I'll be
on my way
Of a life spent to rule and command, nothing shall remain

All is gone
Glory and hope mean nothing to me now

But still I look at the crimson sky
At the beauty of the sunset one more time
and I realize there's a meaning
a way for me to keep on living

Don't let my memory die and I will stay with you

[Chorus]

For evermore
For evermore

Years of reign and endless strife
Of deepest sorrow and glorious fights
And will be gone in a moment
My kingdom will soon disappear

Don't let my memory die and I will stay with you

[Chorus]

For evermore
For evermore
For evermore
For evermore

The King of Rhye will be crowned again
His messenger will spread the word far through the land
He will sail the seven seas of his kingdom
The dream will live on forever

So don't let my memory die but now it's time to be gone

[Chorus]

For evermore
For evermore
For evermore
For evermore
