Energy is lighting up the sky
A mighty thunder is breaking through the night
I saw your treason and I heard your vicious lies
and I know what must be done

Now there's no tomorrow and I have no regret
Like a storm made of steel I strike
For I am the Avenger, predator of lies
And I let the angry north wind rise

[Chorus]

I am the Hurricane Master
Holy knight of the Ancient Code
I am The Hurricane Master
I'll blast your armies to kingdom come

Winds are rising, fast they're blowing
Men are running, loud they're screaming
See my anger, taste my vengeance
The worse is yet to come

So here I go!

Now there's no tomorrow and I have no regret
Like a storm made of steel I strike
For I am the Avenger, predator of lies
And I let the angry north wind rise

[Chorus]

I am the Hurricane Master
Holy knight of the Ancient Code
I am The Hurricane Master
I'll blast your armies to kingdom come

Winds are rising, fast they're blowing
Men are running, loud they're screaming
See my anger, taste my vengeance

And justice is done
And justice is done
And justice is done
And justice is done
And justice is done
justice is done
