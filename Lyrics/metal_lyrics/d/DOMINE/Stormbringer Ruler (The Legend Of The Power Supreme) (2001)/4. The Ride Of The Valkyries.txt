Oh Warfather on high,
I am calling you from the battlefield
And as I take my last breath
I call for the mightiest of miracles

For none but the brave, be he king or a slave
With a pounding heart in his chest
Will be worthy to rise and with the Valkyries fly
And ride to the ancient Valhalla

Oh Warfather on high
Listen to my prayer
I lived my life by your rules
Oh let death cover me now

For none but the brave, be he king or a slave
With a pounding heart in his chest
Will be worthy to rise and with the Valkyries fly
And ride to Valhalla of old

[Chorus]

with the Valkyries, ride over the battlefield
Ride your horses and come to me
I'm waiting for you to take my soul, high in the sky to
Valhalla of old

Valkyries, ride over the battlefield
I'm dying and glad to bleed
Because I know today I will take my place with the heroes
in Valhalla of old

For none but the brave, be he king or a slave
With a pounding heart in his chest
Will be worthy to rise and with the Valkyries fly
And ride to Valhalla of old

[Chorus]

with the Valkyries, ride over the battlefield
Ride your horses and come to me
I'm waiting for you to take my soul, high in the sky to
Valhalla of old

Valkyries, ride over the battlefield
I'm dying and glad to bleed
Because I know today I will take my place with the heroes
in Valhalla of old

In The Halls of Valhalla I finally take my place
With my sword and my shield I enter Odin's realm
I'm an immortal spirit now with a heart made of steel
With the gods on high forever I will live and laugh at the
fears of man
