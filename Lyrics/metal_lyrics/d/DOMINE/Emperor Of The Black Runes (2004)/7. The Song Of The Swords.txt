Beyond the magical Shade Gate, they arrive
Elric, the Pale King, Yyrkon the Tyrant, to fight
Ther in a chamber, hanging in midair, two swords
Dreadful and fine, forged in a time no man can recall

[BRIDGE 1]
They finally find the swords
Stormbringer and Mournblade
They are fighting face to face
As the blades come alive

[CHORUS]
The black swords are singing their song of fighting
The black swords are singing for joy of blood letting
The black swords are singing for they're back to battling
The black swords are singing
They are singing out loud the song of the swords

Lifting the blades of chaos, the swordmen attack
Just like two puppets, by alien hate
they are possessed
Hearts are now pounding, metal is clashing, as one
Brothers of steel are singing their will to kill

[BRIDGE 2]
They finally find the swords
Stormbringer and Mournblade
They are fighting the final duel
and their souls are the prize

[CHORUS]

Listen to the song of the sword

[BRIDGE 2]

[FINAL CHORUS]
The black swords are singing their song of fighting
The black swords are singing for joy of blood letting
The black swords are singing for they're back to battling
The black swords are singing
for souls they are craving
