[I. Warm are the rays of the new sun...]

[II. While I think about an uncertain future...]

What will I see at the end of the fight
The light of the dawn breaking your darkest night
What will I see when I look to the sky
Dark clouds will vanish and the sun will shine bright

[CHORUS]
Oh, the sun of the new season
is guiding me back to the place I belong
In the sun of the new season
I'm finally finding the way that brings me back home

Never regret the decision you make
A new world of chances is yours to take
Never deceive what you're feeling inside
Even when dark thoughts are oppressing your mind

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE]
I cry for the dreams and ideals
I was not strong enough to make real
I grieve for the loved ones
I hurt when I did not stand by my words
I swear to what I hold dear
Not for a moment will I tremble with fear
Now I know I got to be strong
For I believe that we reap what we sow

[III. A blinding light floods the darkness...]

This light is overcoming
This light is overflowing
This light is everlasting
This light is finally bringing me home

[IV. Inside my soul the answer unfolds...]

[BRIDGE]

[CHORUS]
Oh, the sun of the new season
is guiding me back to the place I belong
In the sun of the new season
I'm finally find a new hope

[V. And a new hope brings me back home...]

I'm coming home
