It starts deep within, just a feeling inside
A hope in my heart I can no longer deny
to break away, break away, break away, out of here

I'm a fool and a dreamer, with no place to run
A man who's been hoping to touch the sun and
to set himself free, free to reach for the eternal sky

Now I feel the urge to follow my dream, forever free
to spread my wings and fly high into the sky

I feared I would fall and fall down to the ground
but my will to ride free through the oceans of clouds
is stronger now, stronger now,
it's stronger than ever before

I'll be a symbol of warning, of ambition to rise
To fly beyond the light which is blinding my eyes
Now on a strange wings I fly
I soar on the wonderful wings of a dream

Never again to be bound by chains within cold walls
My decission is made and the time is now
A legend is born as the eyes of the world see

[CHORUS]
Icarus ascending, Icarus ascending
Icarus ascending into the sky
Icarus ascending, Icarus ascending
Icarus ascending into the sky
High into the sky

[BRIDGE]
No one will ever stand in my way
No one will ever force me to stay
And I'll fly away, fly away, fly far away from here

I take a deep breath and I close my eyes
My legend is born as the eyes of the world see

[CHORUS]

Icarus ascending into the sky
I have no place to live, I must transcend
to the other side

My wings may be burned by the rays of the sun
Though my body is falling my spirit is rising high
High beyond the astral sky

Icarus is free
