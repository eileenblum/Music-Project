Knight of the swords, you of the great old Gods
A new age has just begun
Forged in the fire of hate, vengeance and betrayal
The race of man has come to rule

Queen of the swords, you of the great old Gods
Darkest lady of the deepest realm
You will know fear, sharper than a spear and you'll
be banished from these planes
By the hand of the prince in the scarlet robe

[CHORUS]
He's sworm to destroy all Gods
by the power of the cosmic balance
He's chosen to save this world
save the race who betrayed his own
A quest in a time unknown
to bring peace forevermore
Survivor with a noble role
The prince in the scarlet robe

King of the swords, you of the great old Gods
Summon now your dukes of hell
Faceless lord of chaos, your golden sword will not
save you and you will fall to your destiny
By the eye of the prince in the scarlet robe

[CHORUS]

Now that Gods are no more
Law is ruling the fifteen planes
No more cities in the sky, no more oceans of light
Find a new dimension where new Gods can be
created and destroyed again by the eye, by the hand
of the prince in the scarlet robe
