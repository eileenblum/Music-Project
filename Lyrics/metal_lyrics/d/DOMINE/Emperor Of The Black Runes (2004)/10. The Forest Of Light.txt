I always thought my war was eternal
and steel my only friend
I spent all my life fighting alone
on my own

Until I found Tanelorn
And a new man was born

[CHORUS]
We shall be free
Reaching immortality
We shall walk free through the trees of the forest of light
We shall walk free through the trees of the forest of light

No more pain
No death in vain
Sanctuary of peace
Where in harmony we can live
Where I know we will meet again

Soft sunlight shines for the heroes
Now weary of war
The ghosts of a past of endless fighting
means nothing any more

Now I live in Tanelorn
And a new life is born

[CHORUS]
