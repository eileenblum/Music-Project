They are watching the world from a mystical place
for thousand of aeons they are guarding
As the universe is forever at change
You can feel their presence surrounding

Everlasting, Incorrupted
Sacred guardians of the miracle of life

They are bonded together by the power of light
They bring law where chaos ruled
Circling their swords in whirlwinds of steel
as weapons of justice against the cruel

[BRIDGE]
Everlasting, Incorrupted
Sacred guardians of the miracle of life
Timeless watchers of the heart of creation
No one ever can defy

[CHORUS]
Battle Gods - They fly on their swords
Battle Gods - Chasing the wind and the stars
Battle Gods - Across the universe they ride
Battle Gods - In search of eternal truth
Battle Gods - They tune their minds and bodies
Battle Gods - So man and nature can be one
Battle Gods,Battle Gods
Battle Gods of the universe

[BRIDGE]
[CHORUS]

Battle Gods
