Of purest evil, I am the light
Born in the abyss of ancient time
Beyond the mountains of knowledge by magic
You find me and summoned my name

Of eternal fire, I am the flame
And I flood the cosmos with sublime hate
As you're crawling out of th genesis slime
From the darkness of chaos I rise to steal your souls

From the darkness of chaos I rise

Of chaos supreme,I am the overlord
Summoned by glorious emperors
As they paint magic runes with their sacred blood
I aid them and make them my slaves

I am the master of your creation
Prime mover of your annihilation
But the price for my duty is much too high
Your immortal souls'sacrifice

And I'll be forever the great lord of the seven darks
Now your precious souls will be my prey
Arioch is my name

[CHORUS]
I am the Chaos  star, Ruler of the universe
Feeding on screams, smashing your dreams
Casting your souls into the deepest hell
I am the Chaos  star, Ruler of the universe
Feeding on screams, smashing your dreams
Just speak my name and forever you'll seal your fate

Summon the Chaos star

[CHORUS]
I am the Chaos  star, Ruler of the universe
Feeding on screams, smashing your dreams
Casting your souls into the deepest hell
I am the Chaos  star, Ruler of the universe
Feeding on screams, smashing your dreams
Burning your bodies to blackened bones
