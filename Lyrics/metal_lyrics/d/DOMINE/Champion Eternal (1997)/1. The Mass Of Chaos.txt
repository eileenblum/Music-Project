Full moon is shining 
so high in the sky 
legions of black cloaks are 
gathering tonight 
Flames are now dancing 
in the ancient oak forest 
the stars are now in position 
HE WILL COME! 
Been waiting for centuries 
for this night to come 
ancient dark gods guide 
their knives 
His spite-filled laughter 
will fill the air 
thy painful kingdom come 

They gore themselves 
in honour of return 
a tribute to their cruel devotion 
the chant will shatter 
the doors of time 
and their blood shall be the key 

[chorus] 
Come to the mass of chaos 
Summon the nameless One 
Celebrte his gory return 
Death now grinds his schyte 

Come!Free from the shadows 
Enter our world 
give us your blessing 
open the door! 

Come! Out of the shadows 
possessed by the trance 
we will die! 
Come! We bleed for your coming 
intoxicate the essence of life 

The thunder roars and all at once 
a total eclipse of the moon 
thier sacrifica is unrewarded 
still dead bodies lay on the ground 

[chorus]
