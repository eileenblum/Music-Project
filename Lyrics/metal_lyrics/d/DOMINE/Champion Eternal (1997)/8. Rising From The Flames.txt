I've seen the signs of fate 
fortold in ancient rhymes 
the screams of a million souls 
the king rise from his grave 
Coursing throught our veins 
the vengeance of a 
thousand years 
we bring judgment 
the burning reward 
the gift of pain 

On burning wings we ride 
flames are streaming from 
our eyes 
empires fall as we pass by 
from the ashes the phoenix 
will rise 

[chorus]
Swords are raised on high 
and the flames are rising higher 
scorching the sky with our spite 
We are rising from the flames 

From the gates of eternal 
damnation 
sailing the lake of fire 
raging warriors raging fire 
heel now walks the land 

On burning wings we ride 
flames are streaming from 
our eyes 
empires fall as we pass by 
from the ashes the phoenix 
will rise 

[chorus x2]
