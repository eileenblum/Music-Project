...and so it came to pass... 
there arose from the myst 
of chaos 
a great black warhorse 
none of which like the world has 
ever seen before 
or will ever see again. 
A mighty beast whose 
thundering hooves 
shooked th very foundation 
of the earth. 
Striking fear into the hearts of 
even the bravest soul 
and the only thing more powerful, 
more terrifying: 
the Man who rode it. 
There he was,clad in an armour 
black as the night, 
his expression grim as his sword 
was heavy 
eyes are old as time itself,eyes tha 
have seen the dawn of this world 
and he is now arrived to see 
its end 
dealing death and destruction to 
all that stands in his way, 
the warrior of the wastelands. 
All bow to the Dark Emperor
