[II) Screaming The Battlecry]

The time is now 
we go to wage war against the 
enemy 
i'm the Campion,the Defender of 
Humanity 
with vengeance i will ride upon 
them all 

[chorus]
I'm immortal 
wielder of steel a war machine 
I'm the leader 
The One who will lead you 
to victory 
I'm the Hero 
blood and destruction are my deeds 
I'm Eternal 
Fight to the last ! 

The army's ready 
the battle banner's high upon 
my lance 
The sword the armour will be 
my only brothers when i ride 
the sound of battle horns will 
start the fight 

[chorus]
And now the time has come for me 
to rise my sword against all thee 
and then the spell shall son 
be cast 
you're doomed to fall beneath 
my axe 
I'll banish evil from this land 
a newborn king will overcome 
I'll be the scythe to cut you down 
I'll be the fire to burn you down 
Conquest is mine into the fight 
Screaming the battlecry ! 

Screaming the battlecry 
running with vengeance in 
my eyes 
Not one of you will survive

[III) Blow My Blow (Into The Fight)]

Hear the clash of swords 
The shout of the warriors fighting 
band to band 
Blow my Blow,into the fight 
Blow my blow,I'm ready to strike

[IV) Death Of The Champion]

Oh,King of the dead 
I've waited so long to fight by 
your side 
and my sacrifice to you are 
souls of enemy knights 
released by my sword 

An arrow flies it bites my heart 
the steel is cold 
my blood spills out 
I can't believe it runs out red 
immortal heart can't feel no pain 

For all these years i've lived a lie 
the wisemen words blinded 
my eyes 
a son of gods,immortal lance 
now just a son of mortal men

[V) Heroes In Tears]

Oh,the battle is near the end 
My body lies on the blood stained 
sand 
All I hear are cries of pain 
All I see are my friends before me 
Heroes in tears [4 times]

[VI) Destiny Revealed]

Now my destiny is revealed 
I'm a fate's soldier to eternal war 
The gates of time will spread 
open wide 
Mortal in body,etrnal in will 

Doomed to be called with 
many names 
Doomed to have many shapes 
and doomed to be forever at war 
and to go wherever I'm called 

Where will i go ? TO FIGHT! 
For what ? TO FIGHT! 
To fight for what ? TO FIGHT! 
For what ? 

Eternal Champion doomed to fight 
forever! 
FOREVER!
