Somewhere in the sky
When my thoughts are close to die
I will let all tears
Flow down with my fears
As a last insult
I will face the world
Then I will say to all
That I saw you fall
In this fuzzy life
I see you clearly
You are just a thought
But I can touch you
Now I found you
You are lying on the floor
You wanted to touch the sky
Your wings are broken now
This is the mankind story but this is man story
Flying higher and higher
And you burn your soul
Run away you have the time
Beware of life demons
Run away you have the time
Beware of life demons
Sunlight in my eyes
But no tears falling
I'm running to you
But I can't catch you
Now I'm lying
Surround by the light of dreams
I wanted to touch the sky
But I have no wings
This is the mankind story this is man story
Flying higher and higher
And you burn your soul
Run away you have the time
Beware of life demons
Run away you have the time
Beware of life demons
Somewhere in the sky
When my thoughts are close to die
I will let all tears
Flow down with my fears
As a last insult
I will face the world
Then I will say to all
That I saw you fall
[Chorus]
