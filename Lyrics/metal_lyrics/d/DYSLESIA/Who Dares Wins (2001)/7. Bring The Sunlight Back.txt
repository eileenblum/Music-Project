You asked me what's wrong with the world
No one will answer but the master
That's sit on the highchair
And watches the pain he will make
Searching solutions not for opinions
For stupid reasons you would kill
All the people around you without even blinking an eye
Now comes the time sorrow and pain in your mind
Now comes the time hands holding power are falling again
Running all alone on this path
On the way to hell you won't listen to
All of the children that ask for an offer of help
So you kill them all nobody moves
But there's something strange on their faces
Their eyes are so empty but still they're directed to you
You can't redeem your first attack
To late to bring the sunlight back
You can't redeem your first attack
To late to bring the sunlight back
You asked me what's wrong with the world
No one will answer but the master
That's sit on the highchair
And watches the pain he will make
Searching solutions not for opinions
For stupid reasons you would kill
All the people around you without even blinking an eye
Now comes the time sorrow and pain in your mind
Now comes the time hands holding power are falling again
You can't redeem your first attack
To late to bring the sunlight back
You can't redeem your first attack
To late to bring the sunlight back
In your eyes lies the mirror to the world you made
Show me reasons for an end
[Chorus]
