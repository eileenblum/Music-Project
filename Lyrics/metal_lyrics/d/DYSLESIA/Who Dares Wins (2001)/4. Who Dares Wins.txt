I remember what my father said
My son you don't belong to anyone
Lost in doubt he takes my hands
He taught me how to make choice
No one else should help me now
Nothing less nothing more nothing I can do
For all the things we need to be someone
A real ambition burns in me
Not a question of chance satisfy me
Break the chains to set me free
Want you to believe me
Who dares wins time and again
Face to face I challenge my dreams
Hear the voice I have inside now and forever
Who dares wins time and again
Face to face I challenge my dreams
Hear the voice I have inside now and forever
The voice inside of me is the guiding light
It shows me the way to ignore all the pain
I hear this voice every where I run
Never fearing the fall that just begun
Don't you know it's not too late
Free our mind and make it right
I'm the hunter of everything in life
What my father said is always inside
[Chorus]
