Hey you look at me
I've got a story
Of seven men who left the earth
We told them show us now
Rest of space you'll be ours heroes
'til the end of time
the pride of XXth century
A star ship scans the universe
1998 a milestone in history
Messager one left the earth
No sign no failure no fault
Outer space was at hand now
third from the sun seven of kind
A mission that could but succeed
Seven onboard with a message from mankind
Messager one at full speed
The journey came to a halt
Messager one met no land
Sending out desperate radar beams
The star ship disappeared like ghost
Suddenly no spot on the screen
Messager one was reported lost
Now they're bound to nowhere they rest in space
Now they're bound to nowhere without any traces
Messager one was reported lost
Third from the sun seven of kind
A mission that could but succeed
Seven onboard with a message from mankind
Messager one at full speed
Now they're bound to nowhere they rest in space
Now they're bound to nowhere without any traces
Messager one was reported lost
Third from the sun seven of kind
A mission that could but succeed
Seven onboard with a message from mankind
Messager one at full speed
Third from the sun seven of kind
A mission that could but succeed
Seven onboard with a message from mankind
Messager one at full speed
