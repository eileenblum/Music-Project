Trying to catch the moment
A black horizon calls you
I'm staying here to see
These clouds of hate that surround me
Just one more try
Life is now so strange
Roaming through the city
The roads are eating my faith
Birds of freedom save me
I just want to find love
Birds of freedom save me
Now I can wash away all these tears in my eyes
Fighting and gone it's all I have done
I see the fear in your eyes
Fighting and gone they said I was wrong
Hiding their face in disguise
Don't tell me these lies
About a god I try to hear
This pain is always inside
Forever I need a little help
Remembering all I have done
At last I found my way
I follow my own rules
All I want is the right to decide
Birds of freedom save me
I just want to find love
Birds of freedom save me
Now I can wash away all these tears in my eyes
Fighting and gone it's all I have done
I see the fear in your eyes
Fighting and gone they said I was wrong
Hiding their face in disguise
Look at the light in my eyes
Birds of freedom save me
Look at the light in my eyes
Birds of freedom save me
Now I can wash away all these tears in my eyes
Fighting and gone it's all I have done
I see the fear in your eyes
Fighting and gone they said I was wrong
Hiding their face in disguise
