Searching my mind
Looking for something inside
Introspection in my life
A travel with no return
Screaming in the crowd
Nobody wants to hear
Alone with a million of liars
Leaving you all is so hard
We are hunting you through this nightmare
We are fooling you such a fair game
We are hunting you through this nightmare
We are fooling you such a fair game
You're living in a lie
Searching for the truth
Masquerade of your life
No one's making you
You're living in a lie
Searching for the truth
Masquerade of your life
The reason for the world
Help your neighbour
That's what they said
Now you're all alone
Under their smiling faces
You try to understand
But something is missing for you
Maybe this is the truth
You'll never know the end
We are hunting you through this nightmare
We are fooling you such a fair game
We are hunting you through this nightmare
We are fooling you such a fair game
You're living in a lie
Searching for the truth
Masquerade of your life
No one's making you
You're living in a lie
Searching for the truth
Masquerade of your life
The reason for the world
A flame in your eyes
It shows the truth for you
No reasons to be here your world is dying now
Join us now before your mind turns into something bad
It's a sign of the times you'll see
[Chorus]
