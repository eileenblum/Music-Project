When the night was falling
Shadows running down the walls
And when the darkness came
Something crossed their minds
And soon they realized our promises were lies
And in the dark they would not ever stop to run
If it was only a dream
It would turn into a nightmare
Now they soon will be dead
Where have we sent them tonight ?
And soon they realized our promises were lies
And in the dark they would not ever stop to run
They were much stronger so deep in the night
They were dream fighters
Show them what they should be searching for
Let them realize
Sometimes they crossed the nightmare land
Hiding in the dark
They wanted only to rest in pace
Let them rest in peace
For the peace of their minds
Think of them when you're sleeping
You can't save their souls
But you can save your nights
And soon they realized our promises were lies
And in the dark they would not ever stop to run
They were much stronger so deep in the night
They were dream fighters
Show them what they should be searching for
Let them realize
Sometimes they crossed the nightmare land
Hiding in the dark
They wanted only to rest in pace
Let them rest in pace
