Fight and ride on your black horse
And cross the darkest forest
Cold is raging all around but hell's gate is there
In your heart and in your veins
The holy blood is running
And you'll see you are the one:the saviour of all
You're still waiting for that moment
For the time he'll be alive
Looking at the mystic red star
You will find the holy light
Hell is waiting for your soul
Your wild heart is pounding
Soon you'll have the chance to win this eternal fight
But one day your holy world
Will put down your brave mask
And you will be enthrone as the wisest of lord
So the honour will embrace you
And the glory have your name
Known as being the holy saviour able to defeat their pain
And one day you'll be the chosen one
The holy light for all mankind
And one day you'll be the flame
Of a world turning another page
[Chorus]
