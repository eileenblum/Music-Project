Now I am running from the dark
And I am out of my day
And I'm out of my time
Now I'm turning back to my steps
I see again I can see you
Fear is in my mind
And I'm holding back my tears
Tell me save me
Why can't you hear me
Can't you see
Tell me believe in me
Don't you hear me
Then set me free
After so many years of faith
I am the only one to blame
I can be sure you won't forget the past
I can see in my eyes your will
Bleeding in my mind
Like a killing memory
Tell me save me
Why can't you hear me
Can't you see
Tell me believe in me
Don't you hear me
Then set me free
I never understand I feel the wind in my dreams
I never realize I feel the blood in my veins
I wanna talk to you there is no place for me now
I wanna ask to you your heart is made of steel
No don't cry for me
No one knows my pain
I would die for you to be your friend
[Chorus]
