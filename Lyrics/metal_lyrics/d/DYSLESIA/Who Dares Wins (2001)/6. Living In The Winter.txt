All these days aren't the same as yesterday
And my world keeps fading away
This rising feeling of emptiness
Like a dream dying inside of me
As if time was frozen whereas I abstain myself
As if other have given up whereas it's me who kept still
And this force it keeps me going
In pursuing to write my story
To find my way uncertain in this loneliness so lonely
I feel like I never going anywhere
These new experiences remind me of something else
When the choices are showing me
The differences between my life and what I've been longing for
And this force it keeps me going
In pursuing to write my story
To find my way uncertain in this loneliness so lonely
Accept the absurd
Endure the betrayal
Learning is painful
Oh lord slowly
I feel consuming my soul
[Chorus]
