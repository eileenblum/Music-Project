We all have the same dream
We run every way for this
The way is never easy, isn't it
The dream to find the better beat

Life is a circle, we try to transform
Like a pic, we want to share
Show you that we care
Let us show you our world

We took our time, to make it
It gnaws at us, but we made it
Dizorder

All was made here
We started in local three
Little box with our dream
We keep in memory our pic

Life is a circle, we try to transform
Like a pic, we want to share
Show you that we care
Let us show you our world

We took our time, to make it
It gnaws at us, but we made it
Dizorder

Sometimes we all feel pique
But we will climb this peak
We'll always push to go higher
We are all dizorderâ¦

Dizorder [5x]
