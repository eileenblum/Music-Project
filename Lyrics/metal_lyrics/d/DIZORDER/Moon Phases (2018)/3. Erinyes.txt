I didn't know why you were laughing about them
I didn't know why you slighted the world and them
Your laugh was like a mocking here a vicious peal
Like a sound full of hatred that we must feel

And I was wrong to follow you
(So wrong)
And I was wrong to let you do
(You do)

Now I, know you
I will fight anyone like you
Now I, know you
I will be stronger than you

Your favorite game is to push everyone down
Crawling at your feet like a disgusting worm
The only worm here is you no mistake likely
I will tread on you savagely and so easily

And I was wrong to follow you
(So wrong)
And I was wrong to let you do
(You do)

Now I, know you
I will fight anyone like you
Now I, know you
I will be stronger than you

Your treat, it's to wreck them
I will make you drool
You break, you don't care
I will make you fool

I was wrongâ¦ I was wrongâ¦

Break you, fight you
I will break, I will fight
Break you, fight you
Break break, fight fight

Your treat, it's to wreck them
I will make you drool
You break, you don't care
I will make you fool

I will break you fight you [11x]
I will make youâ¦ foolâ¦
Break
