The moon is changing.
She shows us her face, every dusk, and changes night after night.
She whispers every evening words of madness and disturbing stories.
Her strength disrupts the world. She is an essential and elusive element.
Her light disturbs or illuminates. She is, with her faces, a multitude and a unit, facing the darkness.
