I've seen, your eyes, your lies
I've tried, to close, my eyes
You think, silence, is right
Don't take me, for you, a jerk

In the end you let down
Your whore mask you used it
To show me your fake smile
I can see your face clearly right now
I see now that you've got the same

That people I ever hate

I've seen, your eyes, your lies
I've tried, to close, my eyes
You think, silence, is right
Don't take me, for you, a faint

I didn't know you yesterday
I know the truth today
Tomorrow and tomorrow again
Will be a hell for you
For you

I saw your face
Did you see my face ?
I saw your face
Did you see my face ?

My face, your face [3x]
Real face
