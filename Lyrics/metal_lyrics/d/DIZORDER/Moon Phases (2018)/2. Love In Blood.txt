I was so blind
My eyes were clouded
You twisted my heart in every way
This pain I will forget
Don't think you will be a memory
I reject all that we meant
Don't try to catch me again
I will not let myself be caught
You can scream my fucking name
Fuck you, I can't hear what you say
Run after me as long as you want
Do you really think I will stop
Don't run faster than you do

Did you see my scars,
My hurt, my wound?
Did you see my scars,
My hurt? You'll never mind

You know all the hurt you caused me
You just pretended not to see

We were passion, and destruction
Love in blood, desire in sorrow
We were disaster, and perfection
Love in hate, pleasure in ache
Love in blood

It was like an eternal treadmill
At first enjoyment then vomit
It was your favorite sadistic game
It's my turn to have my own game
You played with me like a doll
I will take you up the pole
I will have fun doing voodoo
I will make sure the doll is you

You know when the nightmare begins
When I leave and never return again
I know you're not gonna change
But you change me it's a chance

Did you see my scars?
My mind, my soul heal?
Did you see my scars,
My mind? I'm done with it.

You know all the hurt you caused me
You just pretended not to see

We were passion, and destruction
Love in blood, desire in sorrow
We were disaster, and perfection
Love in hate, pleasure in ache
Love in blood

Love in blood...
(In blood, in blood, in blood... Love in blood...)

We were passion, and destruction
Love in blood, desire in sorrow
We were disaster, and perfection
Love in hate, pleasure in ache
Love in blood
(Love in blood... you, you, you...)
