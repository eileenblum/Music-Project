Told it over and over again, but still you can't comprehend
There's no way I can restrain these feelings that I bear
Deep inside my chest is raging nothing but sole wrath
And I won't give up until I see the world go down in flames

No, do you feel deluded?
Are you sick and tired of not getting what you deserve?
No, are you feeling rejected?
Still the world around you goes crazy, it feels insane
To be an outcast among freaks, but I'm still standing

We're alive in endless pain
Real life has never been
Our lives are empty
Nether void's reality

Realize you're just alive when you lose control
Self-castrated everyday to play a part that's not your role
I am getting to the point that I can't even stand you breathing
So stay the fuck out of my life cause I am done agreeing

No, do you feel deluded?
Are you sick and tired of not getting what you deserve?
No, are you feeling rejected?
Still the world around you goes crazy, it feels insane
To be an outcast among freaks, but I'm still standing

We're alive in endless pain
Real life has never been
Our lives are empty
Nether void's reality

Creation dirge, cold inferno

Still you throw the stones unable to restrain
Better days will never come drowning into grey
A sparkle of illusion providing sullen smiles
The stench of broken dreams is filling up your life

Come forth and reach for the stars
While you're drowning in the gutter
Ascend from this course of perpetual decay

Regretting the things that you should have done
Sorely bound to fail, decaying alone
I see you're just a shadow of yourself
No matter how hard you try you will only fail

No, are you feeling stranded?
Still the world around you goes crazy, it feels insane
To be an outcast among freaks, but I'm still standing

We're alive in endless pain
Real life has never been
Our lives are empty
Nether void's reality

We're alive in endless pain
Real life has never been
Our lives are empty
Nether void's reality
