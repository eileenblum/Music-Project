Black and bruised, but still awake
I sink down to the oceans below
Procrastinating, just to achieve
A solace far darker than coal

Eyes to see, deceivious
My vision is clear
Hard to justify the cause
But the feeling is mutual

Coming with praise
Coming to prey on my own
You're nothing but a sin
Nothing but a sin, come again

First light comes, how relieving
To sink into the gallows below
Raw embers, sheer blake
A dreamlike death of silence and stone

Raging, scorching, as a shell shock
A sudden rapture, a blackout of mind
For all I've seen I endeavour
To eradicate your life

Downfall, shan't we all fall?
A bitter lesson to learn
Strangled, bruised and mangled
Still the animal rises

I won't be afraid
Illusive as your smile
I cannot restrain
To force the endtime

Shattered parts of a last wail
Fill the gloom of feral silence
Shadows breathe a serenade
As the crows devour the shreds of life

Eyes to see, deceivious
My vision is clear
Hard to justify the cause
But the feeling is mutual

I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid of myself
I cannot restrain
To force the endtime
To force the endtime

And I see
From a sanctuary of feelings of stone
Your turmoil, your struggle
But my walls won't be shaken
By your masquerade

Blessing from below
Cursing from above
