All your thoughts are prefabricated
Your beliefs, a sad parade of fucking clichÃ©s
As we're going down the road we failed to see so many times
Still bound to ideals that someone forced into our minds

Go on and deceive me, all I see is crumbling down
I'm so sad to upset you motherfucker
But I wanna leave it for real now

Time to learn something, believe in nothing

I feel like I failed
Can't you see I'm slowly crumbling down
As I'm starting to learn how damn easy is
To breathe like a dead
Devoid of forces

There's no point in taking sides as long as everything's a lie
Still we're glad to enslave our minds to a familiar archetype

We never had
A single chance of freedom
We'll never have
Control over our destiny

Go on and deceive me, all I see is crumbling down
I'm so sad to upset you motherfucker
Are you willing to break?

Slaves to the illusion of life

We're slaves to an illusion
Scorned and decadent till our very last breath

Never let these raging flames abandon your heart
