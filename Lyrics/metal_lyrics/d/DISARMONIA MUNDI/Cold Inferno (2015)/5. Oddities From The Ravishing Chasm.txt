Fractal radiation
A demented swan
Spreading wings of mangled beauty over my shroud

Let the scars of reality heal inside the womb
Lacerate the outer structure and become a tool

I'm falling in the void
Lost in my mind
Can't believe this world's reality
Looking through the blood and falling rain

I'm falling in the void
Lost in my mind
Can't believe this world's insanity
Looking through the blood and falling rain

Force your will among the scattered ashes of the core
Recreate, forge and shape
Fetch the seed of creation and let it blossom

Ravishing and pure
As the creatures crawl

Mad

We are the breed of the catastrophe
And hear the call of the abyss
We have the future within our grasp
And shall see the world burn
Yeah, burn

No, perseverance is such a strain
While destruction is at hand
We shall destroy and then evolve
Eradicate the anomaly

Ravishing and cold
As the dread unfolds now

Spreading wings of blood
A thousand eyes awake and stare

You have to come back to the haze of the creation spell
Looking through your eyes I can see all their faces still
Will I ever comprehend all the things I've seen?
Follow the way of pain to the other side of Hell

Gazing through the eyes of the eternal becoming
Drowning in the streams of this Cold Inferno

And we shall see the world burn
Sustained by the scars
Aware and awake
Ascend to the burning halls of omnipotence

Never submit to the rules of men
Cold and sore is the heart
As the mind strains for sheer knowledge and power

The disease shall be cured
Washed in the tides of blood

Restoration lies in turmoil
Suffocating beneath piles of dirt
The everlasting sparkle still gleams
Awaiting recovery

Make the stand, dive into the glade
As the surrounding world falters
While the ties of reality fade
Shape the demon that carries your name
In the void
