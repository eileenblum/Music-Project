Returning at twilight
Out of a suffering light
As for naked fortune
I can color my mind one last time

Colors sweet surrounding me
The power of sun, believe me
Has low importance the grey in the streets
I am searching for

This day wakes up unreal
Warning electro-voices
Giving mankind the revelation...
You've got to give back all the choices
A liter of ink flows on the pages
From mouth to mouth, to the TVs
"Eat good, drink wine go for a run,
keep brown... this is your last sun!"

I pull your colors to mine
The fucking grass grows in this side

Sitting on the wet grass
Eyes to a sky without stars
As for naked fortune
It seems a whatever dawn
Just more queer

I've seen a grey world dying out
In the fiction-like silence of my city
Every person frightened by my smile
As in search of my colored world
