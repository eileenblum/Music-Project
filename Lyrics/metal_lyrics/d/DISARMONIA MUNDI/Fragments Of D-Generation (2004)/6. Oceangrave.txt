Gathering regrets
Beyond loneliness
Restless lunacy release me
From my agony
The silent waves are calling
Piercing louder through my brains

Weathering distress
Offering collapse
Silent dream state (awake me)
From my endless pain
The silent waves are calling
And now they're telling me to come
If I should fall into the sea
Where you still wait for me
If I could wake you from your sleep
And fly away from here

The chilling wind is gone

The still moon hangs silent and full
Leaving all my dreams
Broken on my feet
Relief never comes
So better leave this place right now
A lonely rainy day
Just forget my name

Will I ever reach your endless flow
Crumble on my knees heaven's fall

Still my horizon's turning blue
Through my brain
Killing my senses rising through
My oceangrave

And now
Release my tragedy
And sanctify my curse
Obey the infamy
Of heavens down below

Bleeding forth the source of freedom
Paralyzed a never ending fall

Slaughtering regrets
Beyond emptiness
Restless agony release me
From my lunacy
And so I'll take this ride
Into the streams of the sky

And now I fall into the sea
Where you still breathe with me
For I can wake you from your sleep
And fly away from here
