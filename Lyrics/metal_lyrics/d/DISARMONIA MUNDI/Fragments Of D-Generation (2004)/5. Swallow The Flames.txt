Bleeding' over my face
Yeah all over my face
Disgusting'?
No, it's just a game
Obey
Betray
Come out and play
I wanna see you swallow my pain

The end of sanity is clear
This time I won't pay for your sins

For all my life
I've been so weak
Hiding silent like an ordinary sheep
But now I seek
The end is near
The beast inside me still
Longs to be unchained

Hatred's burning fast
Inside my breast
Relentless
Boundless
Still impressed?
Genocidal machine
Homicidal relief
Pitch-black dreams... Just fuck it!

Burning me
Bullets over you
Burning deep
This time I'll see your ego's fall

Closer
With no regrets I kneel alone
Among the ruins of my world

For all my life
I've been so weak
Hiding silent like an ordinary sheep
But now I seek
The end is near
The beast inside me still
Longs to be unchained

Get lost
Fucker
Before I nail you down
Show me Your God
I cannot wait to see you crawl

[Swedish with rough English translation:]
Jag blir sÃ¥ jÃ¤vla trÃ¶tt [I get so fucking tired]
PÃ¥ allt ditt jÃ¤vla tjat [of all your fucking nagging]
SÃ¥ knip din jÃ¤vla kÃ¤ft [so shut your fucking mouth]
Och ge mig lite blod [and give me some blood]

Hellfire in my grip
Infernal greed
Damn right!
I wanna see you bleed
Insane
Psychotic
Here I come
I'm just a freak out of control

The end of sanity is clear
This time I won't pay for your sins

For all my life
I've been so weak
Hiding silent like an ordinary sheep
But now I seek
The end is near
The beast inside me still
Longs to be unchained
