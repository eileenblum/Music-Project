I find it's a bit oppressive
To think that the world is running around
And waste your time in search of an image
If you can't see there is a mirror behind
Break the default feelings
And then kick the ass of the habits
Don't live in search of the attitude
Just be and fuck the other lies

I've got the impression, and I'm not alone
That in you boys something's going afraid
I don't like a hand on my back from behind
But I'm not frightened by myself
Pretend my will
The spinal marrow of life
And not alone we'll find a source
Where I drink the most forbidden wine

A mind set
The meaning of a borrowed life
Not a move in the right direction
Just on and on the same old try
Give me back that treasure
I'll be twice at the same time
Or follow my realizing way
Just be and fuck the other lies

I know who you are
Cold tiredness inactive desire
Take my hand now
Recall the primordial era
Give me back that treasure
I'll be twice at the same time
A mind set in permission
The meaning of a borrowed life
