If the shelter comes from
Your home sweet home
Check the switch and if the light is on
The new prophet sings
The death of modern era
A presenter proud of its mind level zero

You can think it's a joke or the search for new audience
Macabre thoughts for a night without star fence
Flows out the power
Mind sets you are dead
Through vapours you hear the right vision comes back

Paralyze your future secret plan
And your idea, wondering of everything
Finalize, close your hands
And try to hold inside
At least a little bit of sand

The final lie
The worst you could believe in
Reset the living
And wait what has to be
The final lie
The worst you could believe
Reset the living, and wait...

If the shelter comes from your home sweet home
Check the switch and if the light is on
The new prophet sings the death of modern era
A presenter proud of its mind level zero

You can think it's a joke or the search for new audience
Macabre thoughts for a night without star fence
Flows out the power mind sets you are dead
Through vapours you hear the right vision comes back

Come with me into the highest sky
You're the demon
Who can believe in everything
Call inside your last forces
And live your time,
Once alive by your choices

The final lie
The worst you could believe in
Reset the living, and wait what has to be
The final lie
The worst you could believe
Reset the living, and wait...

Red clouds, cover the sea
Last horizon, it's why I had to leave

The discovery of a new dimension
Once disclosed, by my own wings

The final lie
The worst you could believe in
Reset the living, and wait what has to be
The final lie
The worst you could believe
Reset the living, and wait...

Paralyze, your future secret plan
And your idea, wondering of everything
Call inside, your last forces
And live your time, once alive, by your choices
