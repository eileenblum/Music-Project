[English translation:]

The horizon is shining because
it hide you somewhere.
when I see a lot of lights,
I feel dear because
you are in one of them.

Let's go out,
packing a bag with a piece of bread,
a knife, and a lamp.
This burning will that my father gave me.
That look that my mother gave me.

The earth is spining, hiding you.
The eyes are shining, and the lights are twinkling.
The earth is spining, putting on you;
putting on us who shall meet each other someday.

This burning will is that my father remain for me.
That look is that my mother gave me.
The earth is spining, hiding you.
The eyes are shining, and the lights are twinkling.
The earth is spining, putting on you:
putting on us who shall meet each other someday.
