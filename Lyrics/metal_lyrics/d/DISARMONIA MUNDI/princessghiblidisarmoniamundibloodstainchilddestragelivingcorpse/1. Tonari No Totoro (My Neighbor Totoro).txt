[feat. Disarmonia Mundi &amp; Sophia Aslanidou]Dareka ga kossori
Komichi ni ko no mi uzumete
Chiisana me haetara himitsu no ango
Mori e no pasupooto
Sutekina bouken hajimaru

Tonari no to to ro totoro to to ro totoro
Mori no naka ni mukashi kara sunderu
Tonari no to to ro totoro to to ro totoro
Kodomo no toki ni dake anata ni otozureru

Tonari no to to ro totoro to to ro totoro
Tsukiyo no ban ni okarina fuiteru
Tonari no to to ro totoro to to ro totoro
Moshimo aeta nara sutekina shiawase ga
Anata ni kuru wa

To to ro totoro to to ro totoro

To to ro totoro to to ro totoro
To to ro totoro to to ro totoro..

the translate to english

Someone secretly
Buried a berry in the side road and
When a small sprout grows, the secret code
Is the passport to the forest
A wonderful journey will begin

My neighbor to to ro totoro to to ro totoro
Living in the forest since the past
My neighbor to to ro totoro to to ro totoro
It visits you only when you are a kid
A very mysterious meeting

Raining at the bus stop
If there's a drenched ghost,
Let him under your umbrella
The passport to the forest,
The magical door will open

My neighbor to to ro totoro to to ro totoro
It blows upon its ocarina on the night if the moon
My neighbor to to ro totoro to to ro totoro
If you ever meet him, a wonderful happiness will come to you

To to ro Totoro To to ro Totoro to to ro
