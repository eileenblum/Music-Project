Hey
Your generation looks so lame
Such a bunch of spineless worms
Media-fed ignorance
Numb and stupid

To be a part of it
To learn how to bleed
Let yourself fuckin' go
No! No!
Ain't a thing u can do
Hey! You!
Go to Hell
No regrets

Going down to see how bad sins can be
Gambling with the dead and the prize is me
Feeling all my senses fade away and die
Nothing lasts forever hope you enjoyed the ride

Slaughtering, vanishing, tie the rope and fuckin' bleed
I've gone too far within my scars lies a truth that you will never find

To feel the fire glow
Inside your empty soul
Emotionally lost
A pale and broken ghost
And every scar I bear
Can't bleed enough to tell
How deeply I despise
This curse is called mankind

A swarming mass of useless pawns scattered all around me
Unable to think, walk, talk or even breathe by their own

Low
It's the only way to go
Led by such pathetic whores
Money-run travesty
You are disgusting
