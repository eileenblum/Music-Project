Lick the wounds that still bleed
Need a reason to surrender? The answer's here
Your whole life is a failure
But I have the solution, get rid of yourself

And still I crawl like a rabid beast beneath your skin
A spiral dance, pitch-black romance, you're welcome in

Take a look into my eyes
All I need is an excuse to dispose of your life
Set myself beyond morals
Decadence is an infection, surrender to guilt

Slash my soul
To the core
Rip the skin
And feed upon my heart

Skin after skin still you crave to come back for more
This bitter lesson always goes unlearned
Need a reason to remember?
Close all the doors and ride on my pulse to be sure I'll stay with you for a while
Oblivion's black as a matter of fact you're a slave to my conception of life

Kiss the wounds of another day
In a meaningless addiction you're only a slave
Strip the mask of sanity
Pay the price and collapse 'cause nothing's free

Time to witness all your fuckin' lies
And to be the slave of your own denial

Like an infection I can't control the seed of hate has grown too strong
A raven's heart bleeding just for me inside my shell a monster breathes
