A single spark of ignition
Yeah, this is all you will get from me
I guess it must be frustrating
To watch me stand where you'll never be
A casket built by your own hands
And I know damn well who's sleeping in
Ain't gonna show no compassion
A light for all to see as motherfuckers burn

Flare, on the edge of hypocrisy
I can still see the truth
Behind your mask of sanity
There's still the same old pigface
Flare, I don't need your apologies
So just stay where you are
Despite the damage you tried to do
I still ain't fucking impressed

You know how I feel
So just stand aside
There won't be no second chance
Before I strike
And all the words I've said
You better read them twice
For I won't wait another day
To get rid of you

And I've never lost my way in all this time
I'm sorry
Too simple to ask forgiveness
It's all in vain
And I've never lost my way in all this time
I'm sorry
Too simple to ask forgiveness
It's all in vain

There ain't no tomorrow
Not even today
For as much as I care about
You could be dead for sure

Alone you stand in your silence
Witness the fall of your fragile world
A face beyond recognition
Shall bear the scars as my fate unfolds
No, you ain't worth my forgiveness
For all I want is to watch you burn
Who gives a damn about morals
Crown myself a king as motherfuckers crawl
