I am descending
Towards the burning me
He lies awake in slumber
Cradled by lustful dreams
I need fuel to feed my fire
Blood shots of gasoline
Fulfill my self-destruction
'Til flames burn within

'Cause I won't wait another day
I don't need your foul salvation
All I want is to burn away
And I won't save me from myself
I don't see a better solution
All I want is to feed my pain

I don't need to be immortal
I just want to burn away
I can't see a better solution
All I need is to feed my pain

Do you lack the words to say?
You will miss them anyway
Face first right in the dirt
Force-fed by broken hopes
Another time, a better ending
Your life sucks, stop pretending
Tomorrow's just a step away
Face first right in the grave

'Cause I won't wait another day
I don't need your foul salvation
All I want is to burn away
And I won't save me from myself
I don't see a better solution
All I want is to feed my pain
I don't need to be immortal
I just want to burn away

I'm sinking further in my guilt
Fueled by the wave of sin
My flame is burning so dim

Still sinking downward
Inside a broken shell
Through streams of burning magma
Across this living hell
