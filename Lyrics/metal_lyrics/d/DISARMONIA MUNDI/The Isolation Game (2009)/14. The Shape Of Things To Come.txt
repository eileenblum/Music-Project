[bonus track]

I am a child of carnage
Trapped in a cage of steel and glass
(Keep holding me)
You tried to hold me down
To keep me quiet in the dark
Too bad you failed again
Payback's just a step away

(one last step away... you bitch)

For something never changes
I'm not a toy within your hands
(I don't believe a thing)
Nothing can stop me now
To get that fucking smile away
Your goddamn face
You piece of walking shit

And now it's up to you
Just show me what you're able to do
Out there without me
Just tell me, are you able to see?

It's time to relearn my dear
That I am not like you are
You're calling but no one hears

(Just take it all away)

Get rid of all the shit
You've been obsessing me for years
(Pull it under)
No warning sign or ringing bell
I'm gonna pull you down to hell
Release ain't done until you're gone
Six feet below a graven stone

And now it's only you
Your shadow's lost, here without you

It's time to relearn my dear
That I am not like you are
You're calling but no one hears

The shape of things to come
Is written in the stars
The shape of things to come
Is carved out in scars

And now it's only you
Your shadow's lost, here without you

It's time to relearn my dear
That I am not like you are
You're calling but no one hears
