Got no time to think about what they did to me
I have lost my former self and still I'm changing

Rain, come down on me - nightfall, won't you just set me free?
Rain, come down on me - rain on me

Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows
Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows

Banish me to feel safe in your prison of gold and morality
Cursing my birth as an aberration a sick child of subhuman breed

Life, it ends tonight - breaking the chains of eternity
Life, it ends tonight - set me free

What should I know? What should I do to get rid of you?
Your life to me equals nothing

Nightfall, come down on me - rain, won't you just set me free?
Nightfall, come down on me - rain on me

Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows
Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows

Take me back to where my soul still means a thing
I don't need your world of lies, just want release

Memories are just fading ghosts telling the story of someone else
I never had a past, the present is a lie and now I know my future is dead

Life, it ends tonight - breaking the chains of eternity
Life, it ends tonight - set me free

Rain, come down on me - nightfall, won't you just set me free?
Rain, come down on me
Rain on me

Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows
Just accept the sorrow, fade away, look around for turning points, let me go
Bringing back tomorrow, led astray 'cause you're the only one who knows
