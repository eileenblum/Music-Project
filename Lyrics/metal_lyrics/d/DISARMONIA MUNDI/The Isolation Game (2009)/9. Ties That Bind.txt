Crush you all - no holding barrels, the playground's scattered but still I stand my ground
Ain't your choice - You tried at last and went down quite fast, another despicable frown
Now you're begging for another way, craving for another way
I'll drag you to the only way that I know
Deep down to the filth of your soul where we can both wallow in guilt like pigs in puke

Famine, failing to discover your fate - rapture, raping all your senses again
Hatred, can't you find a reason to stay - rebellion, deception is my game
Lustmord

I am, internally conceived by - fire, promises and dreams are
Dying, a step beyond perdition - going down all the ways with you
I am, eternally deceived by - fire, memories and fears are
Dying, a step towards extinction - going down with everything you are

Take your turn - I've dwelt in shadows, forcefed by razors, since the day I was born
Fuck you all - sleepwalking maggots, addicted morons, facelifters bastards pawns
Keep going down the other way, straight to a brighter day
The day I'll fucking see your idols fall
And as long as there's hate in my heart I'll be crushing you down and never give up

Famine, failing to discover your fate - rapture, raping all your senses again
Hatred, can't you find a reason to stay - rebellion, deception is my game
Lustmord

I am, internally conceived by - fire, promises and dreams are
Dying, a step beyond perdition - going down all the ways with you
I am, eternally deceived by - fire, memories and fears are
Dying, a step towards extinction - going down with everything you are

Fears may last forever living in a lie
Dreams can bring an answer in desperate times

I am, internally conceived by - fire, promises and dreams are
Dying, a step beyond perdition - going down all the ways with you
I am, eternally deceived by - fire, memories and fears are
Dying, a step towards extinction - going down with everything you are
