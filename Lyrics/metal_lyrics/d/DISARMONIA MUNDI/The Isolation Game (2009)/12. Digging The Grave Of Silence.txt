Digging a grave out of the lies you've been feeding me so far
Pushing your face right in the dirt 'cause you're nothing but a worm

How does it feel to be force-fed by your own shit?
How does it feel to be the first in line without a single spark of dignity?
This is for all the times you tried to silence what I said call it nothing but vengeance

I am not your pawn and I am not like you

There's a few things that I wanna remind you
Making sure you won't forget what I'm about to do
Knowing too well that you'll never ever change
I'm gonna silence your big mouth 'til the end of days

Let me tell you what is done to me I wouldn't care 'cause it'll never set me free
Last call, no matter what you can't destroy me
I will stick to what I've always believed not a person who would lie and deceive
Stand tall, your infected words can never beat me

You lack the brains or the guts to practice what you preach
You try to run but you're not even worth to crawl at my feet

I am not your pawn and I am not like you

Let me tell you what is done to me I wouldn't care 'cause it'll never set me free
Last call, no matter what you can't destroy me
I will stick to what I've always believed not a person who would lie and deceive
Stand tall, your infected words can never beat me

There's a few things that I wanna remind you
Making sure you won't forget what I'm about to do
Knowing too well that you'll never ever change
I'm gonna silence your big mouth 'til the end of days

Let me tell you what is done to me I wouldn't care 'cause it'll never set me free
Last call, no matter what you can't destroy me
I will stick to what I've always believed not a person who would lie and deceive
Stand tall, your infected words can never beat me
