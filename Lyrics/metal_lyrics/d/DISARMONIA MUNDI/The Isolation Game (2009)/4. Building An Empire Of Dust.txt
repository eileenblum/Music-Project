Right on, ram it down the things you fail to see are standing still
Before your eyes in vivid colours draining your soul until you die

And nothing's true but the source of your anger
Release the pain that keeps dragging you down

A place called destiny a warm embrace of fiery ice
In each deception a part of me that slowly dies

Right on - to feel the flames, I need to burn inside
Downfall - oblivion still lives in me

I've seen all that matters before, I dwell inside your fears and cast the spell of loss
You may think that you know me or I even care about you and pretend to love

For you ain't nothing, nothing but a victim
Stonecold remnant in the dark towards the enemy
Still craving for a reason why recklessly searching for an excuse to justify

Right on - to feel the flames, I need to burn inside
Downfall - oblivion still lives in me

I've seen all that matters before, I dwell inside your fears and cast the spell of loss
You may think that you know me or I even care about you and pretend to love

From the endless night of my breathless sleep I will return to drag you down with me

Alone you stand beyond reality a vision made of sand
Unclear remembrance or mental insanity?

Down we're slipping down across the burning ruins of a world that's gone to pieces
I don't want to pay the price of your misleading

Right on - to feel the flames, I need to burn inside
Downfall - oblivion still lives in me

I've seen all that matters before, I dwell inside your fears and cast the spell of loss
You may think that you know me or I even care about you and pretend to love
