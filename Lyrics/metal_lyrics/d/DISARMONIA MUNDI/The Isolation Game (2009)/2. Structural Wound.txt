Wanna push it to the top wanna see how damn downward you can go
This is where it all begins could as well be my last time for real

Never wanted to know, never wanted to see better open your eyes 'cause I'm breaking free
Yeah, I'm breaking free

All your sorrow looks so hollow no, I don't need your words of advice anymore
You're cheating, you're deceiving put the blame on me for things I don't even know

Fade away feeling almost dead inside - just tear it apart
Fade away fallin' off a shoreless lie - this time the wound is structural

I know how you feel know it too well the same old look, you ain't changed yet
But trust my words you ain't seen nothing at all wanna drag you down

Where you brought me wanna quench your thirst with the worst disease
Yeah, I'm your disease

All your sorrow looks so hollow no, I don't need your words of advice anymore
You're cheating, you're deceiving put the blame on me for things I don't even know

(Now I'm awake)

There ain't a reason to justify your denial and now I see things how they are
Fed up with treasons, my life from yours I divide for all my dreams are torn apart

One day we'll meet again farewell, why pretend?
See you at the bitter end don't need this curse anymore

Fade away feeling almost dead inside - just tear it apart
Fade away fallin' off a shoreless lie - this time the wound is structural
