Tearing down the walls I have painted with blood flowing down for eternity
Sliding on the surface of your luscious soul I'm selling dreams for nothing

You're welcome to my private freakshow

Split the soul, crash &amp; burn and back to the wall I don't need a reason
Give you all despicables a brand new god I'm going down in a treason

I'm calling you name in the darkness waiting and you're so near
It's too scary inside I can feel your pain it's frustrating
I feel your breath on me

Crystallize all the emotions burning upon the stake of my memories
All I ever wanted all I needed is so fuckin' lost

I'm calling you name in the darkness waiting and you're so near
It's too scary inside I can feel your pain it's frustrating
I feel your breath on me
I feel your breath on me

And slowly blood is flowing off me I'm dying only to revive

In this perdition haze I have lost my soul
In this perdition haze you're not alone

Going nowhere still there's nowhere to run in this hell I'm raising
Keeping my soul clear from the monsters that breathe beyond the dark I'm feeding

Split the soul, crash &amp; burn and back to the wall I don't need a reason
Give you all despicables a brand new god I'm going down in a treason

I'm calling you name in the darkness waiting and you're so near
It's too scary inside I can feel your pain it's frustrating
I feel your breath on me
