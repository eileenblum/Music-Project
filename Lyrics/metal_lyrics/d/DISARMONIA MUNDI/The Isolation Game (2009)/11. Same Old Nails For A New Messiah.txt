Fed up with bullshit mind castrating lies the more you preach and the less
I wanna hear 'cause you're one of a kind, how can you relate with yourself
Sleep well with the sickness that you are
Yeah, it's you driving me mad so take your life miles away from mine
(Miles away from mine, now come on)

Weak and frustrated you all look like
A swarming mass of pathetic sick pigs wallowing in lies
Still repressing your instincts 'til the day you will finally collapse
I don't care, but don't try to fool me for I know the sick bastards that you are

We don't need no saviour on a cross no more
I can see what religion brings when preachers sleep with kids
We ain't craving for a second coming at all
I will not uniform I'd rather slash my throat

I see right through your shell deep down where demons dwell
Despite your lack of sin you look like shit within
There ain't no saviour that can save you from yourself
No matter what you'll never be free from the beast within
Ages flow lies perpetuate breeding on and on
And the worst part of all this bullshit has yet to come

We don't need no saviour on a cross no more
I can see what religion brings when preachers sleep with kids
We ain't craving for a second coming at all
I will not uniform I'd rather slash my throat

The ravage of war dwells inside the hearts of men
Faith ain't but an excuse to justify the need to kill
Destiny, falling off the pieces - Terminal, the state of your disease
Same old nails for a new messiah

We don't need no saviour on a cross no more
I can see what religion brings when preachers sleep with kids
We ain't craving for a second coming at all
I will not uniform I'd rather slash my throat
We don't need no saviour on a cross no more
I can see what religion brings when preachers sleep with kids
We ain't craving for a second coming at all
I will not uniform I'd rather slash my throat
