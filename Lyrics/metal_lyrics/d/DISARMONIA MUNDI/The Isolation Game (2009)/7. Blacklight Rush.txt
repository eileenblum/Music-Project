Like a layer of skin gently removed
Like a needle of sin injected through
As I take you down to planet doom
Bloodred like the smile I will paint on your face

There is no unity there is no honesty and I will never be the one that you want me to be
We're not a family and I'm the monster that you fear
(I'm the monster that you fear)

Steal a vacant sun no shining through
Fill the empty soul within your womb
Take away them all and straight to you
Bloodred like the smile I will paint on you face

There is no unity there is no honesty and I will never be the one that you want me to be
We're not a family and I'm the monster that you fear
(I'm the monster that you fear)

Blacklight - I'm sworn to thee by the moonshine to be free for eternity
Blacklight - a sacrifice in the cold light to be free from eternal sleep

Batting you down like a rag doll mutilated bruised and maimed
Beating the shit out of your fuckin' skull torn apart like a pig

There is no unity there is no honesty and I will never be the one that you want me to be
We're not a family and I'm the monster that you fear
(I'm the monster that you fear)

Blacklight - I'm sworn to thee by the moonshine to be free for eternity
Blacklight - a sacrifice in the cold light to be free from eternal sleep

Blacklight rush, won't you set me free?
