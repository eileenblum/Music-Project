Fragile bridges burn towers built among the ruins turn to dust as I stare waiting
Hatred fills my lungs sets my soul on fire lick the wounds and recover for more (for more)

I won't wait for your judgment to come
For you have lost your power
And I won't let you dispose of my life

Striking down the walls you have built around my vision still undone yet barely breathing
Anger feeds my heart raging from the inside chances lost can tear you apart

I won't wait for your judgment to come
For you have lost your power
And I won't let you dispose of my life no more

Bastard - despite your greed you have failed to steal my dreams
Facelifter - defied your days are coming your final days are coming

Falling, falling deep in the coldest denial I won't be waiting here no more
Calling, calling deep in the core of the night this endless road

I won't wait for your judgment to come
For you have lost your power
And I won't let you dispose of my life no more

The isolation game
The isolation, the isolation game
