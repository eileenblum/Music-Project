The last reality check has been a failure I guess you've noticed
A monochromatic play of the things that I hate is just running through

If you could look in the book of my life would you still stand by my side?
If you could feel this disorder then would you save me? I don't think so

I'm standing on a frozen shore devoid of faces longtime lost
Forever behind as you're strolling by sinking deep down I am losing ground

Against and beyond and the cycle will turn and I don't wanna hear you no more
Rejection and blame in a sedative state accomplish my funeral

If you could look in the book of my life would you still stand by my side?
If you could feel this disorder then would you save me? I don't think so

I'm standing on a frozen shore devoid of faces longtime lost
Forever behind as you're strolling by sinking deep down I am losing ground
I'm standing on a frozen shore devoid of faces longtime lost
Forever behind as you're strolling by sinking deep down I am losing ground

Prey - you ain't nothing but a
Prey - crawling and screaming out
Prey - almost amusing
Prey - beyond your worthlessness

If you could look in the book of my life would you still stand by my side?
If you could feel this disorder then would you save me? I don't think so

I'm standing on a frozen shore devoid of faces longtime lost
Forever behind as you're strolling by sinking deep down I am losing ground
I'm standing on a frozen shore devoid of faces longtime lost
Forever behind as you're strolling by sinking deep down I am losing ground
