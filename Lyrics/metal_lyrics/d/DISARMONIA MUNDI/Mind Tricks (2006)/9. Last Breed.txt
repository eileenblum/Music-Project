Every second seems so meaningless
Just like a whirlwind of dust
And all you witness is a part of me
The one that I distrust

[Chorus:]
I am the fallen one
And I don't give a fuck at all
So just step aside
Digging your every sin
In my mental crawl

But as I look into your empty eyes
And taste the coldness of your heart
I feel the poison rushing through my veins
Slashing my soul apart

I fell from grace and cursed your name
Burnt to ashes just to rise again
I fed my lust upon your anger
And shed my seed into your embers
(And still feels like the first time)

Entwine the sense in this place of anger
And for a very last time
Let me see your soul burning
And as I kneel among the ruins of the chambers of the morgue
I know that I'll be here waiting for centuries to come
