Restless
Memories
Are gathering still
Inside the shades of your nightmares
Suffocating you drown within
And dream the day of your destruction
I tried to cope with this a thousand times I slashed my skin
But I still cannot figure it out safe
As my woundless hurt remains frantic
Yours go down the drain
So get the fuck out of my life
Forever

Exhausted
By the burden of disease
In this silent addiction
Forever entangled in the dark within
Here's the key to your salvation
Like a bullet in your brain
You're aware of your decay
Restless dreaming of a final solution
All your efforts seem so vain
Time to face all your mistakes
And slash your way out of the dark forever

[Chorus:]
Yeah I know it's too late
To regret your mistakes
In this world of confusion

The shadows embrace
You get rid of your pain
Parting ways with a blade

Your wordless separation from this state of atrophy
Is nothing but a cold breeze in a world of agony
Now I want you to know
No one will waste a single tear for your demise
And your grave will be nameless, cold and forgotten
Lost in the shadows of time
