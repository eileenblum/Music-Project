The uttermost attraction
You repressed until tonight
Is breaking free like a boundless scream of ravenous desire
Feral resurrection
Dancing on a wire
Celebrate the darkness that is torturing your mind

[Chorus:]
Flow!
Your endless dreams are burning
Bright!
The resurrection code
[2x] Overflow of quivering shivers
Standing by the moon shapes
[2x] The night in me

Paralyze the sense from our state of disgrace
The senses from our state of disgrace
We must fall chase the end of nightmares
By the pulse of midnight we're reborn
In lycannihilation
Face the endless night
Your meaningless existence is a shelter between me and I

Rise for a midnight ride from a senseless life
The resurrection code
Galleries of shadows
Stain the crystal moonlight night
The netherbreed is reborn
Hail the eve of your decline

Chasing the dreams of the endless night solidify
The steps of time
