Flawless
Your pure elitist cult looks so flawless now
The conception of annihilation
I'm a sinner without cause an aberration
Unbound
Blackness lays her wings on me
The mirror lies but I stand still
I hammer the nails inside
The burning chaos of my mind

[Chorus:]
Feel it flow
Feel it blow
Feel it rage inside your heart
Feel it turn
Feel it burn
Nothing's left to tear apart
Burn you
See me burn
You feel me burn
Beneath the rays of a colder sun
Burning ice and velvet rain
(I know I have to die for)
Falling from the liar's den
(Get rid of all this sorrow)
Begging for
The hands of rain
(You know you have to die for)
A venom leech is what I am
(Inside I feel so hollow)

Self-deceive your brain
Crawling in the corner of your brain
Impostor
Guess what I am
Guess is what I've always been
So disgusted by this world yet I feel it crawling underneath
You feed my wrath and heal my fury
Turn me to the beast I despise

Rain of glass
Nails of fear
Winds of hatred
Gather here
Cold emotions
Turn to dust
All the shit you worship
I distrust

I can't have enough of burning hatred
Shape my wings in blood and anger
I feel it flow
And serves me right
There's nothing left inside of me
