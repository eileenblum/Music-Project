Arising from the cursed abyss,
Our mission has been given by the fallen angel
We are demons in human flesh,
Born to desecrate God's creatures until total extinction

While the holy ones kneel down and forgive,
We believe in the powers of hate and annihilation
Our thirst for giving a painful death
Won't be relieved before the end of this earthly aim

The elite is immortal

We incarnate what they call intolerance
We live for the sins they forbid
None can threaten our race
None can defy the almighty laws of Satan...

The will of Satan

The souls of the weak ones won't be judged
For they are destined to be slaughtered
Mercy is abstract to the strong in mind,
The metal of our swords is concrete for the enemy

Death's the epidemic we spread
Acts of brutality humiliate all goodness
The final war was easy to win
Life was a mistake and now it belongs to the past

Extinction of the weak...
Extinction of the weak...
Extinction of the weak...
Extinction of the weak...
Extinction of the weak...
