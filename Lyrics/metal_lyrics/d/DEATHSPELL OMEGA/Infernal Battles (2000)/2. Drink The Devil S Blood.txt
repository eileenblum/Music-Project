In the deepest pits of Hell
I torment souls endlessly
Shapeless demons are all kings,
But there's only one real ruler here
I am his faithful disciple,
Possessing humans to bring them under

I will control all mankind
To see them destroying each other
Their poor spirit will burn
Like all things that is Holy

Burn!

We are the poison of the earth
The whore Mary was sodomized
Her bastard son will rot forever
We laugh at the fairy tale that is God

Inverted crosses are struck into their heart
Our Lord Satan delivers us from good
He slashes his veins to give us his essence
To my kind it's power, to the weak it's venom
We drink the devil's blood, to win the anti-life war

I will control all mankind
To see them destroying each other
Their poor spirit will burn
Like all things that is holy

Burn all that is holy!

Forever we will dwell inside each living cell
Destroying the sacred
Creating the nothingness
My cause is supreme and inexorable

Drink the devil's blood...
