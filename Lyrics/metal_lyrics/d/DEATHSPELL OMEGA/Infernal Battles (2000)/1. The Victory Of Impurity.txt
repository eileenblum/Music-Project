Since the creation of the holy doctrines
Each fragment of life wants to be saved from death
Some have rebelled against peace
To accomplish new prophecies that will bring chaos

Guided by Satan's hands and mind
There's a void instead of their eyes
Orgies and massacres show no escape
Evil is the ultimate vermin

Victims are drowned in their own blood
The most insane rapes gives away to necrophilia
As torture is like a lethal sculpture
Real masters don't need slaves for they need them dead

Their quest is violent but sublime
When a soul is cursed, it is for eternity

Sometimes they also suffer
As sons of the devil it makes them stronger
Impiety will be enthroned,
Mankind shall be soiled entirely

Some messiah, dead on a cross
Now everyone is rotting away
Believe in the mighty pentagram
Or perish in pain to feed the beasts

Here is the victory of impurity
