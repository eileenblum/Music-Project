â...anyone who
speaks against the Holy
either in this age, or in
the age to comeâ
[Matt. 12:32]

Come, Thou Sanctifier, almighty and eternal God,
and bless this sacrifice prepared for the glory of Thy Holy Name

Roi CÃ©leste, Consolateur, Espirit de vÃ©ritÃ©,
Viens et fais en nous ta demeure,
Le double abime, la fosse Ã©pouvantable

Let the rivers of paradise recede to their spring
May their sear beds expel desperate drops of anguish
May these bitter waters quench our thirst
Until the last second of the last hour, forevermore

Vestigia null retrorsum
