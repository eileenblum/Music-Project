Tonight there's a new procession
Worshippers of the beast walk silently towards another church to take another life
Our aim is to desecrate this weak creation that is mankind
One by one, we kill these creatures full of disgusting goodness,
To increase the evil within ourselves

Last time we slayed an old priest, and now we have a new borned child
He will be baptized again but with his own blood...
We light some candles and prepare the altar...
The ritual has begun

We shout demonic spells, the little larva cries, as we brandish a knife
Blood runs from the altar and falls on the ground
The warm entrails are hung on their cross

In cursed chalices we drink to the reign of Satan
Pentagrams are drawn on the wall of the house of God
The bestial sacrifice is over

We are the masters of terror, the shadows that will destroy your peaceful world
Under the pale moonlight, tomorrow we'll strike again
Our cruelty has no boundaries
Just wait for your turn
