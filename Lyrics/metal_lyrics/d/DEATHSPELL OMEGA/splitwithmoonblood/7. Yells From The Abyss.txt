Death is not an eternal and peaceful rest,
A kind of beautiful paradise
Indeed you'll meet your almighty maker,
But he's not the one you think he is

There is no sweet kingdom of heaven,
Full of flowers and green landscapes
No god will welcome you with open arms,
Like a father who forgives all your sins

In fast Death is a sempiternal nightmare,
Where unknown tortures tear your soul to pieces
You left your body but you still feel the pain,
Imprisoned by infernal demons forever

In the deepest abyss, every human soul is the slave and the toy of Satan
His armies play with you till they are fed up,
And throw your spiritual essence in the lake of fire
Hell is the superior dimension that slowly annihilate the weak nature...

The torment never stops and you pray for a final death
You await an endless void that will never come
No resurrection will save you from this extreme agony
There is no escape from this world of suffering,
And in your previous world no one can hear you scream
Scream and taste our hate!
Total invasion will soon begin on earth,
Hell will rise from the abyss to eradicate each atom
