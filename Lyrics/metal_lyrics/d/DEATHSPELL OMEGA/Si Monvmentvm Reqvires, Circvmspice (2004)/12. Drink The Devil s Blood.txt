Come to Him in belief, accept truth as lies and lies as truth
Does the first candle burn or is it ashen cold? Grace or Damnation?
Come to Him in belief, and see not the secret of Heaven
But of earth; a prodigy of great magnitude

Drink the Devil's Blood
Holy essence that consumes even the stars
Drink the Devil's Blood
Drink and become the poison of earth and man
Drink the Devil's Blood and become
One of His million hands; One of His million eyes
One of His million brains shining with utmost devotion
A molecule of The One with many faces
While of thy soul remains but ashes cold...

This funeral bell and it's sacred sound
Haunting always and no more peace
Nor redemption, but moribund ecstasy...
And the glory to serve as one among many

Drink the Devilâs Blood: Necessitas medii
Drink the Devilâs Blood: Necessitas praecepti
Holy essence that consumes even the stars
Drink the Devilâs Blood
Drink and become the poison of earth and man
Drink the Devilâs Blood and become
One of His million hands; One of His million eyes
One of His million brains shining with utmost devotion
A molecule of The One with many faces
While of thy soul remains but ashes cold...
