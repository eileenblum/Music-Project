From the Thirteen Apostles men
Pregnant nymphets hast they become
Defiled with divine faeces;
Despicable rot, tortured flesh

Those eyes have witnessed.

Organic procreation, mind-intromission; there comes the salvation
Pubescent vaginas obstructed with the redeemer's holy essence
Humanity reduced to its supreme worthlessness;
Children under His will, Ethic fulfilled

Those eyes were deceived.

Little children, praise the Lord,
Praise ye the Lord!
This is the day which He hath made;
all will rejoice and be glad in it

Born with the ability of begetting
Only but One gift were she granted
To excrete a new humanity unwanted
Reluctantly she - woman - loves the god of a creation within

Those eyes have binned.

Praise the Lord in His benevolence
For the disadvantage and their simplicity
Rape, incest, and insouciance
Of a magnificent power if unforeseen despondency

Those eyes lied zealously

Praise Him for His blessed act,
Praise ye the Lord!
This is the day which He hath made;
all will rejoice and be glad in it

Innocence sacrificed and heaven denied
Iniquity divine - no repentance - over mankind
Mind-raped, self-devoured, empty god-eyed
Transgression coercive, Redemption never to be found

Those eyes were blind

Under the altar of cannibalism
Man hast (thou) confessed the spiritual schism
And without pride mourned the loss of freedom,
Our blessed Lord have condemned you to martyrdom

Those eyes saw wisdom

Praise the Lord, for He is glorious;
Praise ye the Lord!
This is the day which He hath made;
all will rejoice and be glad in it

Inter spem et metum
Inter spem et metum
Inter spem et metum
Inter spem et metum
Inter spem et metum
Inter spem et metum
Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord, praise ye the Lord.
