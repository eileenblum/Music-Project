Hearken, thou, until I relate things
that shall come to pass in latter ages of the world,
for we are the seeds of the triumph yet to come...
Only a few, in the multitudes upon earth,
shall be aware of what they do, but all will
court the assassination of Christ's redemption, again and again...
Their apparent choice of the cross against the serpent
Hides nothing, from north to south, but a call for chastisement
The sins of men will stink more than a pestilence before God...
What a balm for the soul of those who respire hellfire
To witness Abraham sacrifice his firstborn. Amen!
Contemplate and say, what is earth, else than a frenetic psalmody for His venue?
Arise O Lord. Let not man prevail... visionary words indeed
For man is the key and man is the device
And out of his ranks shall arise the saviour draped in the blood of the unborn
Scriptures say "We do not think him to be the devil or a demon as some others do
but one of mankind in whom Satan shall dwell totally...
for he is the man of sin, the son of perdition,
such that he will seat himself in the Temple as if he were God"
Woe to thee Corozain... woe to thee Bethsaida... and thou Capharnaum
that art exalted up to heaven, thou shalt be thrust down to hell...
For he will grow from child to man and extirpate
souls in a devilish whirl from your cursed bosom.
Fraught voices rise to the sky and beseech god to avert the incarnation
But mankind was the prism to the quintessence of corruption
Contemplate and say, what is earth, else than a frenetic psalmody for His venue?
What joy and glory shouts he who bears the mark of the Beast
Consumed and eaten have been the abundant abortions of mankind, but now,
none of them, humans, shall remain but what birds could not carry off in their claws!
