"-Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy." Psalm 99:3

Let them praise thy great and terrible name;
for it is holy

Odium
Oh Merciless Hatred;
Spare nothing, spare no one
Oppressive heat, intense flavour
From the pupil of the one-eyed mongrel to the distant depths of the macrocosm
We are all waiting for the releasing hour

Praise the God of our salvation;
Hosts on high, His power proclaim

Odium
Oh Merciless Hatred;
Burn the Me in me,
And thus every cell of humanity.
May the essence of impurity redeem my soul
Unleashed hatred be my salvation and thy ghoul

Worship, honour, glory, blessing,
Odium, we offer unto Thee.
Young and old, Thy praise expressing,
In glad homage bend the knee.
All demons in hell adore Thee;
We would bow before Thy throne.
As His angels serve before Thee,
So on earth Thy will be done.
Wherefore He also hath highly exalted it, and given it a name
which is above every name:

That at the name of Odium every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and thing in earth, and things under the earth;
And that every tongue should confess that Odium is Lord, to the glory of Satan our Master.
