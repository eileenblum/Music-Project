Chants echoing in ruins
Prayers turned into curses
Curses to condemn us to Hell
Curses to bring us misery,
What we gave to them

Forgiveness is forgotten
Chants repeat the same weeping
Asking and hoping their God
To punish and exterminate unbelievers
We have killed him
We are above him
We are Gods of this moment,
Crushing the throne
What has been built
Of bones of unbelievers
These are the hands what strangled
Last breath from holy belief


Thanks to nicolasdane for sending track #1 lyrics.
