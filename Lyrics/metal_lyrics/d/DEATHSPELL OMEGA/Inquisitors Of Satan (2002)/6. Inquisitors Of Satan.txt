No place to hide, its time to suffer 
After the tracking come the tortures 
You'll worship the Devil before you piss away 
Tremble at the thought of this unholy revenge 
The legions will catch each normal human being 
Why do they ask for weak values like mercy or tolerance? 
The answer to their miserable life is a painful death 
We will give you agony, you will give us pleasure 
Every form of religion shall be erased 
Disgusting weaklings must scream and cry 
(Scream and cry...) 
Let us show who're strong in mind 
You'll realize no one can help you 
(No one can help you...) 
It hurts atrocisiously you hope you'll join the Heaven soon 
But your agony was so sweet compared with what comes next 
(Hell comes next...) 
Powerless belies are crushed in a storm of hate 
Your faith is changed to follow demoniac ways 
(Demoniac ways...) 
Bodies are tied to instruments of torture 
Demons are now eating the pityful spirits that were inside 
(Inquisitors of Satan...)
