Death is coming fast 
She's my only faith 
And no one will be ignored 
This is a sick quest 
I know I'm insane 
But I don't want to be cured 
Relentessly 
I'm the desecration master 
In search of the ultra violence 
Addicted to the taste of blood 
Hunting prey certainly 
Relentessly 
I need to see and fell humans suffering 
Eyes full of fear imploring my mercy 
No need to use weapons that kill too fast 
I use my own hands to touch the petrified skin 
It's almost possible to watch the light of life, 
Vanishing and turning into a fancus orgasm 
Ususally using rape for female creatures 
I ejaculate inside the dead body 
But my satisfaction quickly disappear 
Until the next time I dream of massacre 
Satan will guide me forever 
The sacret face of god will be traked down
