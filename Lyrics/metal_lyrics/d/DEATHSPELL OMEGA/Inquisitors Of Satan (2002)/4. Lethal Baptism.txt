Acid streams from the Chalice over the newborn body, 
Pain rises like deadly waves of sulphur 
And it cries with despair and supplicates 
As it dissolves its sweet flesh 
See, Satan...Lethal Baptism for all children! 
Hopes for future generation disappear 
As the acid of our hate devours 
The last germs of their life 
Bools of bloodmixed acid on the ground, 
Another soulripped out of it's spell 
Primeval innocence offered to supreme Lord 
See, incarnation of all Vices 
See, lethal Shadow 
Life-corupting Abomination 
And cause of total Degeneration... 
Lethal Baptism! 
Lethal Baptism!
