I am the Evil in every form 
The demon you abondon yourself to. 
Hungry for an hatred without equal 
I am the one who brings the pain for the end 
I am your suicide 
I am the rope that strangles you 
I am the razor slashing your wrists 
I am the bullet going through your head 
I am the poison in your blood 
I am the wicked in every man, 
Delighted every at every morid? death 
For many years my name has been "Decease" 
I am the diktator, the tormentor you die for 
I am the executioner 
I am the hammer and the nails 
I am the gas that you breathe 
I am the fire consuming the flesh 
I am the axe that beheids(?) 
No one will survive me 
Humanity is doomed under my reign 
The last breath of eternity 
Resistence is vain 
The child beater, the women raper, 
I'm the one that orders and command you 
The one that curses and destroys you 
For the final goal of Evil 
I am your master 
I am the very quintessence of Evil 
The Supreme Evil in the name of Devil 
I am you suicide, I am The executioner 
I am your master...Satanas...
