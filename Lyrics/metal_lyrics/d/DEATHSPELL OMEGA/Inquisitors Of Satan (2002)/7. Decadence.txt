Extreme ritual of carnal pleasure breaking 
the chains of dignity 
Human bodies become the temples of impurity 
Embrace a shape of living Blasphemy 
Celebrate forbidden practices, bearers of immortality 
Fell fascination for intence debautchery 
As a father rapes his daughter and sun 
As women spread legs for goats and dogs 
Smash down the mortals of Christ 
Indulgein perverted practices, praise sins! 
Fill your body with the quintessence of Perversion! 
Nothing is vile enough, nothing too extreme, 
For beyond the limits of that which is grotesque 
Torture and pleasure, sperm comes with death 
See the face of Jesus so sad 
The sun of god cries for his legacy with tears of cum! 
Flout innocence!Spit on virtue! 
Their will is broken by humilation 
Burning crusifix penetrating virgin vaginas 
Scream of ecstasy! 
See the triumph of our Lord! 
As they all embrace Angel of Decadence!
