Our skies are forever black 
Here is no signs of life at all 
For burning spirits we are 
Consuming your small universe 
Slowly but surely 
No one believes in us 
We came from realms of Hell 
No eyes can see us 
We're not made of flesh and blood 
In times past we reigned everywhere 
One day life emerged from the chaos 
We still dominate but this error must end 
The void shall swallow the decease 
Slowly but surely 
Changing from a dimention to another.. 
of being possession 
Out of the nihilistic kingdom 
to spread destruction 
An unseen invasion to conquer 
the spiled land...till total extinxion 
The human claim to rule their world 
They don't even understand the meaning 
of death 
A black hole is eating each soul 
The ultimate desolation will supress 
life and prevail again 
Then there won't be mistakes anymore 
The apotheosis of Satan approaches 
He who is inside of us
