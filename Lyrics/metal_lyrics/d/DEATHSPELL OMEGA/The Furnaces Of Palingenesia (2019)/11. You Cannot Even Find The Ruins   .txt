You cannot even find the ruins
of the jewels of yesterday
theyâre ashes gone
memories wiped clean

You cannot find any jewels
among the ruins of today
everythingâs stale
muffled silence
for a thousand years

You cannot even find the ruins
of your breath
Too much love to bear
Reborn sterile and dead

Whatever is now is right
Whatever is now is right

You cannot even find the ruinsâ¦
You cannot even find the ruinsâ¦
