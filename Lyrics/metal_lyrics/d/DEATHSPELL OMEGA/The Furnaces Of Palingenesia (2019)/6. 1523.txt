How fondly we remember 1523 and the league of the Electâ¦ tiny seeds that turn hundreds into the millions in the blink of an eye, as Man makes outstanding progress. Let's sing to the memory of the league of the Elect! Let's sing to seeds of hope and their harvests, they will shatter the core of the earth and make the heavens shiver in horror!

Shiver in horror!
