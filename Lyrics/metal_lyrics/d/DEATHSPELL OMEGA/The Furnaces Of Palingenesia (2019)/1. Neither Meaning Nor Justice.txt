This world contains neither meaning nor justice!

Therefore, the here and now shall be torn down and we will bless this world with meaning and justice.

We shall bear a world so perfect that its realization will undo us, we shall name it NEDE.

This is the promise of our providence.
This is the promise of our providence.

This is the promise of our providence.
This is the promise of our providence.

[That is, the world of yore is unintelligible, unless God conceived History as the History of the crimes and misfortunes of the human race.

Arranged as they have been in all eternity, Man and the natural order cannot have been made for each other. We shall dissolve Man and mould him into a new shape, as you would mould a malformed limb, into a shape that fits the aforementioned order.]
