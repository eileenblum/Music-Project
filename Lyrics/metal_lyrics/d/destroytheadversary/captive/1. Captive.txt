[feat. Daniel Escobar]It's hard to survive
In a world so deprived
I'm dead inside

I'm on my knees
Screaming for my release

Release me!

I'm in chains!

Looking for my escape!

A slave mind
With no where to go
This cruel ploy
It's killing me slow

Something isn't right
I've lost my will

But I've found a way
My oppressors will pay
In my final days
These are the words we say

Life is what we made
My life has seem to fade away

I ....will ....not ...give ...in
This is where it ends

Without a shadow of doubt
We will live out
The image you placed in us

Crippled heart
This is where we start

Corrupted
Conformed and disrupted

Don't leave me standing here

Realign my mind
My broken spine

Make me up right!!

Find a way to heal what's inside

And despite everything...
Everything we've seen...
We still choose to believe ...
We still believe

Life! Is! What you make it!

Life! Is! What we make it!
