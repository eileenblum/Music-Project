Bearing bittering cicatrices
Chafing self worn to perform disgrace into obliteration
Coarseness scrapes skin
Oedema for spilling bloodstreams

Facial flesh rupturing
Trailing body on top of stabbing, dragging
Fastening over and over
Mightiness lost by pain furthering over
Advancing above margins masticating in,
knives bending beneath the skin

Skinless mannequin of lacerated flesh
Countenance blackened unknown
Dense fragments underneath the veins

Abandoned by blood, shame erased only in blood.
Impotence for dying, heinous more than death
Skull splintered, countenance veiled by gore
Swallowing own blood
