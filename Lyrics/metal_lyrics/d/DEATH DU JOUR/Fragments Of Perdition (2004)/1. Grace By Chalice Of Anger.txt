Contusioned chalice of anger
Overturned to obliteration,
word, buried in it's own grave
Incruelties, infringe into intact

Exclude, forget all phrases and terms
Flowing thin thread
lights gutter to slots
Glowering in black, peering into black gap
Superiority, implict's discern
Skin won't fade but scrub the mind

Utilitarian principle is to acquit the blood
ravenously from the womb,
prestige of the most to nourish the glory

Notes and heavens can't less severe
Recall to see, alive, flesh and blood
Obligate for the word said when the days end
