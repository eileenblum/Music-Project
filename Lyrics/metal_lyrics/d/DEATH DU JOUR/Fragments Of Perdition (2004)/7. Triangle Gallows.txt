Downpour and down under to belong the limbo
Symbol of hanging in triangle gallows for a copper

Titles many as expiring cases
Gallows many as gales
Reflections many as azures

Eyes deep in sockets here in oblivion groping
Eyes for crows, gallows roots down under all above
Away the universe where opium derivate is faith. Away

Every moment takes a wound, last one takes life
Every moment is a new wound.
Fortune is nothing
Colour is dead
Fortunate no one before dead
