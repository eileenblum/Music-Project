Never felt such pressure inside
The all-killing but vital chaos torrent
A bitter hate boiling without direction
Grotesque images of the spiritual conspirators to poison you

To slice the child in you...
Could one be fulfilled by just one touch of the enemy?
How can one understand you if he doesn't know of pain?

Deep inside
The unbearable feeling of inevitability
Deep insight
the harsh art of the sliced child

The chest saturated by several incisions
The face hacked beyond recognition of the features

Candidate - To experience total freedom
Broken - The unique essence of suicide
Dual morality in every belief but this
Sliced child
Slice the child
