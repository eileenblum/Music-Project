Lunacy on hostile indecencies;
Body glued by clotting blood
Pale in caustic satire

Eyes springing forth, shining white
Characteristic wounds,
Abomination, painted with gore

Sap accumulating in ponds by side
Distending in circles around futile limbs
Cadaveric altering into porous
Bleeding of all gaps

Punctured and piled
Serpentine intestines binded
Frequencies praised
Phormalehydrated
