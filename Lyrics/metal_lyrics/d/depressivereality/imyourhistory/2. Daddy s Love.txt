Fear and pain - Pain and fear
There's nothing else I feel...

Why? Daddy why? You used to tell me
how much you loved me
you used to stroke my hair and cheeks
we used to laugh and play together... and now...
Why? Daddy why? Daddy why?

Perversity, deviation
Sadism and sexual aggression
A poor child's soul is desolate
In the utmost corner of mind

Childish trust and innocence recklessly trodden in dust
The most brutal and sadistic display of parental feelings

Distrust, frustration - Fear and numbness
Every sign of affection - A bribe for my silence
My joy has disappeared forever - In fear of his return
Memories hurt - as a knife - sinking into flesh

Daddy, daddy, it's me! It's me!
I'm afraid of you. It hurts. Please, oh please stop!"

Daddy, daddy, it's me! It's me!
I'm afraid of you. It hurts. Please, oh please stop!

Why? Daddy why? Daddy why? You used to say
you loved me
you used to stroke my hair and cheeks
we used to laugh and play together... and now...
Why? Daddy why? Daddy why?

Distrust, frustration - Fear and numbness
Every sign of affection - A bribe for my silence
My joy has disappeared forever - In fear of his return
Memories hurt - as a knife - sinking into flesh
