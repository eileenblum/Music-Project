The modern medicine lead by the "humanists"
To save life at any cost, advanced technology preserves life
despite the countless deformations
The new-born's cry tastes of suffering though
He has to live, he's a human!
A human? Perhaps - It reminds me of one.
The cost of life is too high

Sentenced to life

Sparkless eyes falter among four walls
He knows every inch by heart
An empty world without feeling and emotions
A life that seems to be endless

Sentenced to life, triumph of the modern medicine
Sentenced to life, baby Doe

A human? Perhaps. It reminds me of one.
The cost of life is too high

A paralysed mind trying to connect
Several subjects into a whole
The eternal emptiness swallows
This soulless puppet

A lifelong dependency on various medicine
An endless therapy pricked in veins
Common things are out of reach
Questions that have no answers
