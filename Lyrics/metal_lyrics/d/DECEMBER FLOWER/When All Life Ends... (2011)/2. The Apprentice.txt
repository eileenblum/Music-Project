Oh my old master left me alone
Itâs time to unleash thee
To my will they shall obey
Spirits youâll be freed

[Refrain:]
Go, I say,
Go On Your way
Do not tarry
Water carry
Let it flow abundantly
And prepare a bath for me

Go, I say,
Go On Your way
Do not tarry
Water carry
Let it flow abundantly
And prepare a bath for me

[Strophe:]
Come on now, old broom, get dressed
These rags will do just fine
Youâre a slave in any case
And today you will be mine

To the bank heâs running fast
Quick as lightning to the river
Now heâs filling cup for cup
Canât stop the deliver

[Refrain:]
Stop stand still
Heed my will
Iâve enough
Of that stuff
Iâve forgotten â woe is me
What the magic word may be

Is the end
Not in sight?
I will grab you
Hold you tight
With my axe, I split the brittle
Old wood smartly, down the middle

[Bridge:]
And theyâre running wet and wetter
Get the stairs, the room, the hall
What a deluge what a flood
Lord and master hear my call

[Solo]

[Refrain:]
Back now broom
Down the floor
Be as thou
Were before
Until I, the old master
Call thee forth, to serve once more

SIR DELIVER ME
