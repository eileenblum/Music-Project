Five hundred man on their way to their fate
Ice cold winds are their constant companion
Their shields are wide their swords starve
For the blood of their enemies

Sword and shield collide
With armour and pride
We ride into this fight

Aeons will fade 
But now it is too late
To stop this fatal run
The battle has begun

Long time ago they came to rule their land
And Slaves has been made but know it is time for revenge

Planets collide 
And angels subside
The end to overcome

Aeons will fade 
But now it is too late
To stop this fatal run
Cataclysm on the run

Now they stand eye for an eye
Untamed hunger for blood and revenge
The warriors reaching up their swords to the sky
Horns of war sound up
On this cold frozen fields
In the name of god
Not has been long time ago

Sword and shield collide
With armour and pride
We ride into this fight

Aeons will fade 
But now it is too late
To stop this fatal run
The end to overcome

Now they stand eye for an eye
Untamed hunger for blood and revenge
The warriors reaching up their swords to the sky
