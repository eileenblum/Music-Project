[Strophe:]
As nightfall darkens the day
The past arrives in my mind again
Within my soul the battle rages
The enemy lives on

Obscure thoughts remain inside
Nocturnal beings insist to exist
No life no hope no fear no more
Time has come to an end

[Refrain:]
And blood has to be shed
No other chance to bring back life
My eyes start to turn red
I will welcome you on my side

Everything left for dead
No breath remains inside the hive
Emptiness stays instead
Peace will reign when we arrive

[Strophe]
Exhausted my body falls to the ground
Drops down in a sea of blood around
Far away from the sun I will go
Relief is near my friend

Nothing more will torture my soul
Demons will leave to let me go
At the end thereâs nothing more
Than final salvation

[Refrain]
And blood has to be shed
No other chance to bring back life
My eyes start to turn red
I will welcome you on my side

Everything left for dead
No breath remains inside the hive
Emptiness stays instead
Peace will reign when we arrive
