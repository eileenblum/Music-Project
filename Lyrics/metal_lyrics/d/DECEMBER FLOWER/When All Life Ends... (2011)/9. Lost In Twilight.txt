A fight against all odds
Seems hopeless to resist
No chance to reach the end
The mastery persists

No one will remember me
Unleash obliteration
I stare into the eyes of divine damnation

Flames of hate cremate
The filth beneath the soil
As punishment begins
To desecrate iniquity

No one will remember me
Unleash obliteration
I stare into the eyes of divine damnation

[Spoken words:]
Lost in the final twilight
Of a blood red sunset sky
Crestfallen I behold the nightfall
As darkness burns my eyes
Remembering the constant stains
Of the depths beneath the remains
Doomed to behold the end inside my mind
