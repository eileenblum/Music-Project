[Strophe]
Staring into nothingness
Ineffable atrocities, obsessed by the flesh
Death surrounds the impure
Forced by the hands of fate

[Refrain]
As darkness reigns
Piles of corpses remain
As darkness reigns

[Strophe]
Walking on the threshold
Of life and death instead
More dead than alive
Remain on the other side

[Refrain]
As darkness reigns
Piles of corpses remain
As darkness reigns

As darkness reigns
Piles of corpses remain
As darkness reigns
Range between boon and bane

[Bridge]
Iâm Alive
Breeding the spawn of damnation
Solace the faithful
Ignite the light in the dark

Fight to survive
Expect the dawn of salvation
Menace the impious
And leave an indelible mark

[Strophe]
Walking on the threshold
Of life and death instead
More dead than alive
Remain on the other side

[Refrain]
As darkness reigns
Piles of corpses remain
As darkness reigns

As darkness reigns
Piles of corpses remain
As darkness reigns
Range between boon and bane
