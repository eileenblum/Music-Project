Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh

[Strophe:]
Lost in the streets
Walking an unknown path
Youâll never see again down on earth
What you deserve
This is your hell
Blackened your inner self
Ridden with disease
To find no inner peace

[Refrain:]
Hell is what you take
Within your feeble soul
Demons of the past will play their leading role
This is your darkest path
Forget the ones before
The more you leave behind the further youâve to go

[Strophe:]
Infect your mind
This is the final path
Increase the beast within
To clean your soul from sins
This is our hell
Sickened our inner selves
Ridden with disease
To find no innerâ¦ peace

[SOLO]

GO

[Bridge:]

No light beneath the soil
Darkness devours our skin
Sickness left us behind
Deeds of another kind
Will let us pay but we donât mind

[Strophe:]
Lost in the streets
Walking our darkest path
Youâll never see again, down on earth,
What you deserve
This is your hell
Blackened your inner selves
Ridden with disease
To find eternalâ¦ peace

[Refrain:]
Hell is what you take
Within your feeble soul
Demons of the past will play their leading role
This is your darkest path
Forget the ones before
The more you leave behind the further youâve toâ¦ go
