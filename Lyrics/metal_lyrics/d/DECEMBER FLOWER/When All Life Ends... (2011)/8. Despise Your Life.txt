Insanity
Fatality
Cross the border of your mind to set you free

Intoxicate
Your inner self
Ignore atrocities threatening your health

Paralyzed
By tortured souls
Smell the stench of human flesh and rotting bowels

Within the war
There is no law
Eyes can not believe what eyes can see no more

[Bridge:]
Despise your life
You have to pay the price
Rewind it all
Expect the curtainsâ fall

Shrieking words
Of dying friends
Trembling voices cryinâ for justice at their end

Bursting sounds
Of hostile source
Deafening your ears, impossible to cure

Donât even know
When will it end?
Everyone receives his fatal punishment

Within the war
There is no law
Eyes can not believe what eyes can see no more

[Bridge:]
Despise your life
You have to pay the price
Rewind it all
Expect the curtainsâ fall

[Chorus:]
For those who believe
Until the end
We try to achieve
The end of imprisonment
