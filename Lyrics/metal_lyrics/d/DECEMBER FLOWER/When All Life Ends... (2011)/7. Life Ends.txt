[Strophe:]
Darkness rages
The moon insists
On frozen fields the world will end to exist

Solar eclipse
Never to end
Symbolizes forces of an unknown mind

Humanity
Yet to demise
Realizes faults from long forgotten times

As lightning breaks
Into the dark
Final light beam strikes and leaves an evil mark

[Refrain]
World`s drenched in flames
This is the dawn of a new age
The splendor of the old golden king
Hasnât been darker so far
Â 
Space seems to collapse
Time has been swallowed by the void
This is the total eclipse
The end of it all and nothing to come

[Strophe:]
Nocternity
Fulfils its fate
Blackened hole expands, starts to annihilate

Big banging sound
Blinded by light
No hope no life just fear and death in mankindâs sight

A pungent stench
Of sulphur source
Sedates the sense of all and starts the mental cure

Nucleus fades
Looses its shape
The last one takes his chance and stops to hesitate

[Refrain]
World`s drenched in flames
This is the dawn of a new age
The splendor of the old golden king
Hasnât been darker so far
Â 
Space seems to collapse
Time has been swallowed by the void
This is the total eclipse
The end of it all and nothing to come

But yet to come is the final annihilation

[Bridge:]
Despise the sun within
Spaces begin to rearrange
Stumbling in darkness and gloominess
To proceed the deeds of sin
The Void is filled with spheres
Unhallowed and obscure in mind
Suffocate the light between thee
To release the beast inside

[Refrain]
World`s drenched in flames
This is the dawn of a new age
The splendor of the old golden king
Hasnât been darker so far
Â 
Space seems to collapse
Time has been swallowed by the void
This is the total eclipse
The end of it all and nothing to come
