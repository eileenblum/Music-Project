[Verse:]
Regret your deeds and die
Before the things to come are passing by
The endless dream of living
Will not forgive the sins of useless killing

[Chorus:]
Sweet relief of mine
Confessing the lies of the past
Sweet belief of thine
Adjust the norms of your mind

Sweet relief of mine
Confessing the lies of the past
Sweet belief of thine
Adjust the norms of your mind

[Verse:]
Figure out the ones in pain
The traitors will not breathe without remains
Infected by iniquity
This is their fate, their destiny

[Bridge:]
Inhaling the smoke of cremation
Of this punishment divine
Once started there is no return
This is the fall of all mankind

[Chorus:]
Sweet relief of mine
Confessing the lies of the past
Sweet belief of thine
Adjust the norms of your mind

[Chorus:]
Sweet relief of mine
Confessing the lies of the past
Sweet belief of thine
Adjust the norms of your mind

Sweet relief of mine
Confessing the lies of the past
Sweet belief of thine
Adjust the norms of your mind
