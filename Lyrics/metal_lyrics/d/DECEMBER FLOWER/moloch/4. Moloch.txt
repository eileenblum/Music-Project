Beast of thousand heads and thousand tongues
breaking the bones of a thousand sons
driven by a need for human souls and hearts
defiling the future, defiling the past
Holding high the banner of pestilence and decay
corrupting mans essence from the very first day
crafted by our hands sealing our predestined fate
infesting our bodies, infesting our brain.

Look around and see what weâve become today
the moloch has taken our souls and confidence away
bow your back to your self-made god of steel
worship depraved to the deity of our destiny

Moloch â manmade being
Moloch â of entropy
Moloch â manmade plague 
Moloch â of entropy

Have you ignored the warning given to us long time ago?
Now itâs too late for mankind to search for a cure
breathing tar and acid with a heart of molten iron
this abomination is here to show its gruesome face

Moloch â manmade being
Moloch â of entropy
Moloch â manmade plague 
Moloch â of entropy
