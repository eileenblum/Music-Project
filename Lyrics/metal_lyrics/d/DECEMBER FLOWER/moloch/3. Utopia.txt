As the dawn fades from the sky
And the mist rises from below
Annihilate another kind
Forced into a cage of sorrow

Leave me alone
The bleeding of mankind comes true
Soothing our minds
With illusions of an ideal view

At the end there is nothing but hatred inside
And the mourning of thousands will leave us behind
Surrender to atrocity
Accept your fatal destiny

Utopia

[Solo]

Follow Me
Drowning in Demise
Hollow Me
Depends on different lies
Swallow Me

At the end there is nothing but hatred inside
And the mourning of thousands will leave us behind
Surrender to atrocity
Accept your fatal destiny

Utopia

Blinded human fades away
And the order of life disappears
Assembling of a former world
Constructed on our primal fears

Undisputed Tyranny
Self-inflicted wounds will remain
Simulated ideal world
Of a useless breed unable to reign

Follow Me
Drowning in Demise
Hollow Me
Depends on different lies
Swallow Me
