[Verse:]
Like an endless downfall
Unspeakable grief and sorrow
Crawling through the back of my mind
No turning back, no hope for tomorrow

[Chorus:]
Never be born again
Sleepless till the end of time
Days turn into night
Canât wait to see the light

This hell has no heaven
No deliverance at all
This pain has no end
No relief, no recall

[Verse:]
Downward spiral never stops
No way to reach the end
Theyâre waiting for us to take us away
To serve and to pay

[Chorus:]
Never be born again
Sleepless till the end of time
Days turn into night
Canât wait to see the light

This hell has no heaven
No deliverance at all
This pain has no end
No relief, no recall

[Bridge:]
Iâm falling so deep
Itâs killing my sleep
Final Destination
Of eternal vacation
