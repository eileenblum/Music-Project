Today, drops of a rain will turn in snow. Today the sun will die
Eternal gloom, Will cover the faces, Makes a human hopes like an ashes of paper
Eyes are filled with blood and hands are pierced with needles.
Your heads are lost, and belief is not more the same.
Your freedom for a while only the who will open eyes, learns, that the reason in all and always.
Enmity remain between us.
The rest of a life will lead in emptiness, getting no understanding that've waited for along time...
And nobody has come, nobody has saved
So many is undone, but he has called, not asked a word
You have chose this way, where all for you is solved...
