Over the bridge, thin as a horse hair,
Guide me, Erlik-khan!
Over bottomless lakes, black as midnight,
Lead me, Erlik-khan!

Beyond life, beyond death, beyond reason
Guide me, Erlik-khan!
To the worlds of unseen and unspoken,
Lead me, Erlik-khan!

Fill my drum with your breath,
Fill my brain with your endless wisdom,
Tear my eyes out of sockets,
And teach me the true vision.

Fill my words with your might,
Fill my lungs with scents of decay,
Cut my flesh with your crescent-shaped axe,
And make me one with hidden worlds.

Beyond life, beyond death, beyond reason
Guide me, Erlik-khan!
To the worlds of unseen and unspoken,
Lead me, Erlik-khan!
