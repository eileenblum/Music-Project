Behold the conversions
Of an exalted seer,
The signs of good fortune
And omens of evil,
Behold the odd images,
Try to comprehend,
Behold and remember,
See and understand.

See, I am the black eagle 
With golden wings,
I am the lord of the sky,
Terror of the field,
See, I take what I want
For Iâm the one to rule,
See how I rejoice
Know that this is good.

See, I am the black snake
With golden head, 
See, I am cut open,
See, I am dead,
See how my head falls
Chopped off by a sword,
Know that the bad luck
Is standing at your door.

See, I am a shaman
Saying words of might,
But Tengri stays silent,
His face is full of night,
See, Iâve gone astray
On a mountain trail,
Know that evil spirits
Are already on their way.

See, I am the Son of Heaven
Who reigns at dusk and dawn,
Behold my shining sword,
Behold my golden throne,
See the people bow down
Before my endless might,
I bring luck and victory,
I dispel the night.
