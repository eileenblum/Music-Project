Let the sparks of this fire
Dance in my breath,
Let the new vision rise
In the eyes of the dead,
Let the wind carry me
Through the vast expanse,
To where the grey spirit reigns,
To where the grey beast howls.

Let the echoes of the past
Resound in my blood,
The beat of ten thousand hooves,
The nomadic pulse,
Let those who came before me
Ride by my side,
To where the grey spirit reigns,
To where the new dawn rises.

Let the voices of the ancestors
Clang in my words,
Endless lines of generations
Joint into one single host,
Let them march with me
Till the last sea and beyond,
Let the grey spirit reign
Through the will of his sons.
