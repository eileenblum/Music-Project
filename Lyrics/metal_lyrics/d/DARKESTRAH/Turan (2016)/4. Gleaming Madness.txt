To hold you 
In trembling arms, 
To speak with you 
With tongue growing numb, 
To follow you 
Through so many lives, 
To kill everyone 
Who encroaches upon you. 

Madness shines 
From the dead and frozen forest, 
Madness gleams 
From a burnt abandoned village, 
Madness calls 
From the depths of stale waters, 
Madness leads 
Into the gloom of cursed barrows. 

Sorny-Nay 
Reigns among the frozen branches, 
Vagiryoma 
Rules the slopes of forbidden mountain, 
Where blizzard howls 
With voices of the witches, 
Where shamans chant 
To the blood stained idols.
