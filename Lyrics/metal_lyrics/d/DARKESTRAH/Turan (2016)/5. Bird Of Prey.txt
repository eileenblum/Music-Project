The spirits of sickness and death 
Are tearing apart my flesh, 
The fiends of the underworld 
Are scattering my bones, 
Those who reside in the black marquees 
Are piercing my brain with an iron spear, 
The ones with venomous tongues 
Are spilling my blood over barren earth. 

Then the bird with iron feathers gathers my bones 
And sews my flesh together with her iron claws, 
The Bird-of-Prey-Mother feeds me with my new blood 
And rocks my new soul in the iron cradle. 

And when my time will come, 
And when my light will dusk, 
The Mother will come to me 
And spread her iron wings, 
To carry my soul far beyond 
To the lands of great shamans, 
To carry my spirit far away 
To the lands of the glorious dead.
