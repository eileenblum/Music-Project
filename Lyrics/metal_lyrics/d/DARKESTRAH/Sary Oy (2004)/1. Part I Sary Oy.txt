Sary Oy ran across the yellow tops.
The great rivers flow into Sary Oy
The great rivers flow into Sary Oy,
To meet each other in the same course.

Five brothers germinated in the womb of Sary Oy.
Gods live in Sary Oy land.
Near two rivers,
In the same heart,
A maiden lives in Sary Oy land.

The sun's gold gave way to emerald.
Evening looked into the windows.
Having felt the wind of great changes,
Evening looked into the windows.
