[music: Golab / lyrics: Cyjan]

Full moon over world full of remains,
there are no people, desert everywhere.

Darkness rules, life is gone,
earth full of DEAD INFECTION,
eyes of terror are burning with hate,
ripped minds, pain and suffering.

The last chance of life doesn't exist,
the human remains are eaten by rats.

[lead: Tocha]

All earth is changing into dead remains,
movements and mind are ceased.

[lead: Maly]
