[Music: Tocha / lyric: Cyjan]

Start human slaughter till the very end,
blessing of bloody god comes to grief.
In the dead of night helpless bodys
excrete their souls, it's a sin of life.

Tumour of rancid minds,
ungrateful destiny,
defective form of life.

Prayers of holy priests are a swinish stuff,
here comes the evil to take human flesh.
Vomited out rotten remains, question of present days,
eclipse of moon has come, night of dead despair.

Nobody lives, slaughter has come,
holy ghost takes their minds.
Nobody has believed in this nightmare,
it's time to start human slaughter.

[lead:Maly]
[lead:Tocha]

Crush your fucking mind, you don't see your face,
horror of your life is a sign of truth.
