[music: Maly / lyrics: Cyjan]

Powerless, homeless, dead again,
terrible dreams, differed world in his mind
Cemetary of his cells is falling again,
diabolic return to life in deadly form.

Putrid mould from a dead land,
sticky plasm without remorse.
Death for alive, life for dead,
it's not such a man as times ago.
[lead: Maly]

Piece by piece again and again,
soggy shambles. People! Pray!

[lead: Tocha]

[lead: Tocha]
[lead: Maly]
[lead: Tocha]
[lead: Maly]

Dead again-go to hell, leave in peace,
dead again-look at people, devastation,
dead again-unatural, human pain,
dead again-hellish view, the guts are breaking.
