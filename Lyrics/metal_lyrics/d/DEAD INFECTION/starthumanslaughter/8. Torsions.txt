[Music: Maly / Lyrics: Cyjan]

Seized in claws of unmerciful torsions you're shocked,
look around, splattered culture by bile from stomach,
lost souls are going for a walk to a land of ugliness,
god is absent, his salvation is powerless.

[lead:Tocha]

Look at yourself, you are in vomits, it's a beautiful view,
yellow mixture on your mouth embelishes you,
dignity, appearance are full of sympathy,
it's a fragment of your life, and of your pride.

[lead:Maly]

Torsions-secret of life,
vomits-secret of pride.

Your organism repeats regurgitation,
organs of digestion excrete bad smell.

[lead:Maly]

In the blood mood identity dies,
torsions are increasing, the last remains of vomits.

[lead:Tocha]
