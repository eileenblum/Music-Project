[music: Golab / lyrics: Cyjan]

Tear your empty soul apart,
in the name of the holy gore.

Flesh is gone, soul is gone,
existence gives belief for the dead,
uncertain step without a chance of life,
rips your fucking health off,

mouldy worms excrete product of emaciated microbs,
prince of circulation of the blood commands to stop.

It causes loss of the mind - its name is pain,
it destroys flesh - its name is death,
it builds revenge - its name is hate,
it vomits bile - its name is gore.
