[Music: Maly / Lyric: Cyjan]

Seized in claws of unmerciful torsions you're shocked,
Look around, culture spattered by stomach's bile,
Lost souls are going for a walk to a land of ugliness,
God is absent, his salvation is powerless.
[lead:Tocha]
Look at yourself, you are in vomits, it's beautiful view,
Yellow mixture on your mouth embellishes you,
Dignity, appearance are full of sympathy,
It's a fragment of your life, and of your pride.
[lead:Maly]
Torsions-secret of life,
Vomits-secret of pride.
Your organism repeats regurgitation,
Organs of digestion excrete bad smell.
[lead:Maly]
In the bloody mood identity dies,
Torsions are increasing, the last remains of vomits.
[lead:Tocha]
