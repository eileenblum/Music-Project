I was left alone in a world with no God to take care. Where no cilivization is
known. Where to survive is the only aim. Twelve weeks with no food or water.
Yet I found a way out. With an enormous eagerness I watch my limbs being
consumed. I see pieces of meat flowing down the ankles. I lose my balance. My
legs are out of control. I masticate my fingers and spit nails out. My bowels
tangle up in my mouth. Insuline streams down my chin. This is the end. My mind
gets no pain impulses any more.
