The Thompson's family won a pleasure-trip to Cameroon this year. They all visa
formalities and even before three days went by they were able to find out the
secrets of the African jungle. Following their guide they entered the heart of
that exotic country. For the first time they could watch autochtons' ordinary
living and variety of flora just to meet their doom at the end of the road. A
lion jumped from behind the trees. Alas, that was not a dream. Father was the
first one to die. The lion bit a hand off. Before he died, his wife and child
watched him bleeding and screaming. The lion torn wife's bowels out and
mutilated unborn fetus. the guide tried to cover the child, but after a
while, his meat was all around the ground. The child escaped, but will he
survive...?
