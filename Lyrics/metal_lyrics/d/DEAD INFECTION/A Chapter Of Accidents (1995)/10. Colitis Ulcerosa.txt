Convulsive spasms make taking food impossible. Large intestine perforation
causes decease. Anatomised reveraibility of phlogistic and ulcerous
transitions increase. Unbearable agony refuses family condolences. Hospital
staff is helpless. A breathing body is undergone the final surgical
intervention. It's too late, anyway. An alien molecule floods entails and
burns his final breath. Bowels explosion. A compound of semi-digested food
flows from his mouth.
