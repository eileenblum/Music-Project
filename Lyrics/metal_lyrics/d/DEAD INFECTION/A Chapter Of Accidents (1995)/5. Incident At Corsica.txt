Corsica. One of many drug-running points. The mafia hundreds of people strong.
A great deal of them are young, unexperienced men. In a hot July afternoon a
tragedy happened. A young member of the Mafia got caught by the Police. Too
excited to keep his mouth shut. Police methods made him squeal. Too stupid to
understand what he had done he went back to his friends. But the Godfather
knew no mercy. The boy was tortured. They pulled his teeth that might use
harder. A knuckleduster broke his jaw in three places. He felt someone's
thumbs go deep into his eyeballs. A cold blade on his wrists. A magnum-shot
split his knee. Then they let him go.
