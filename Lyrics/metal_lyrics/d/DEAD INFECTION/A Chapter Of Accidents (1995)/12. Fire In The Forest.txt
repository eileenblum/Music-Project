Just like every July, Scott with his buddies and his girlfriend camped out in
the forest. They left Willengton for a couple of days and plunged into the
open. It was on the first night out. Camp-fire sparked into sweltering
darkness. Scott got some beers from the car. No beer, no fun. Can after can.
Alcohol was being drunk in a hurry. It's 2 a.m. No one was able to get the
tents or even put out the camp fire. After a hard drinking spree they felt
asleep just anywhere. Everything around changed in the morning.The camp-fire
made the forest burn. Scott lay next to the fire so his body reduced to ashes.
his girlfriend lay half-naked on the stream-side. The fire consumed her
incompletely leaving no bones. Anyway, she couldn't survive. It was hard to
describe other bodies as they looked like burned dry twigs. ...party's over.
