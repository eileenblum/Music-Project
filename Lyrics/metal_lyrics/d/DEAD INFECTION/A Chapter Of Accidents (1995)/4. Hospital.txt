The grand corridor. A great number of operating-theatres people in white
aprons. They give hope to the sentenced to suffer. One can hear a patient's
groan from afar. Surgeons set his broken bone. An ambulance arrives. It's an
enamoured seventeen-years-old girl who found happiness in a razor's edge. Her
arteries colour hospital sheets blood-red. There is a robbery victim next door
who fights for his life. Hollowed eyes, torn out nails, torso burned out with
an oxacetylened welder so that one can see his heart beating. All that doesn't
let him recover. Hospital smell drifts in the air. It emphasizes victim's
suffering. Cases report notes everything down with details.
