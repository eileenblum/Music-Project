Pretty luxury in the San Francisco airport. Boeing's prepared for its flight
to Warsaw. Custom clearance is almost completed. 280 passengers go to the
plane. They take their seats in comfortable arm-chairs. The machine takes off.
It reaches 7000 metres in half an hour. Inside the plane there's a video-movie
on. Pretty stewardesses deliver cool drinks. The flight is pleasant. There's
nearly one hour left till the end of the flight. The navigator gets an
information on from the computer that an engine's damaged. the plane flies
down. There's too little time to take control of the situation. The plane
crushed somewhere in the forest. 198 people die at once. The spines get
severed from the base of the skull. it's impossible to survive it. The rest
fights for their lives. Branches pierced into someone's orbitals, yet brain
lives on. Someone else lost his legs, but still adhere on fragments of his
trousers. On the other side a young man escaped unhurt, but can't a move. He's
pressed down by 120 kilogrammes of bowels, lungs and kidneys of other
passengers. Some where else there's a young girl who coughed out a few
centimeters of her intestines.
