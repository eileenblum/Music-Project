Mike and Susan have been together for nearly four years now. They met at
school when Mike had moved from Ohio. They were the happiest couple in the
world. As usual they decided to meet at a cafÃ©. Mike was waiting for an hour,
but Susan didn't turn up. He drove to her home. He found her parents
trembling. Susan was dead. When she was one her way to a date with Mike she
got crushed by a six-ton board of reinforced concrete. He went to see her in
the mortuary for the last time. He saw her cranium crushed. Her brain tangled
into her shiny hair, her ribs torn from torso and her breathless heart...
...and did he cry.
