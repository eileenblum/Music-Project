No one loves me 'cause I'm scratched
they hate me, 'cause I'm too scratched
from the window of my flat
I'm still looking for my face

No one cares for my ass, I'm feeling dead
No one rings, no one thinks, I'm so alone
my scratched face disgusts my girl
No one hears me sing songs from my balcony

No one loves me 'cause I'm scratched
they hate me, 'cause I'm too scratched
from the window of my flat
I'm still looking for my face
