We're born to be the corpses
we're here for love and happiness
our power is in our own hands
watch as we dance smiling

Dancing corpse
rulers of the universe
here they belong
happy and strong

Here we are, corpses of the universe
dancing on your guts

Full of energy, in love and proud
but with rotten legs
