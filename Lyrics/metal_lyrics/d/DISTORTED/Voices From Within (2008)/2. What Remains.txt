Look at how the time went by
Evoke the past and realize
This is just a fragment
Of a concealed plan that is yet to come

Is this my fate?
An absence of warmth awaits
In silence
In torment

Was it truly the past?
Seeply drowned in lust
With devotion
With desire

Have I forgotten my face?
Is this voice my own?
Vaguely vanishes
From my consciousness

Will my name remain
In your heart?
Or just engraved
On stones forever
