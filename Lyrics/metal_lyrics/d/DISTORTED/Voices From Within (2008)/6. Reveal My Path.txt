Perhaps some questions
Are better left unanswered
Sometimes all I see
Is everything that might have been

A reality I wish to see undone
Reveal my path

All I ask is to have the serenity
To accept things I cannot change
And the courage to change the things I can

Reveal my path
All I ask is to have the serenity
To accept things I cannot change
And the courage to change the things I can

Alleviate my soul
And relieve my agony
Reveal to me my path
And all which is hidden

Let me have a glance of what's beyond
Help me foresee what I do not know
Remind me the sun that yearns for my return
