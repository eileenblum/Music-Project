Where no lights can reach
Behind solid walls of desperation
My mind finds no rest
Should I hinder your awaited tranquillity
Or should I sever my grasp?

I am imprisoned in the mind-grid cage
Escaping through is not consent
Redeem me from myself
Redeem me from my disfigurement

It's so loud behind those walls
So loud I cannot hear my thoughts
Yet I can still hear my heart imploring
To keep on pursuing after your belief in me
Your belief in the unknown

I am imprisoned in the mind-grid cage
Escaping through is not consent
Redeem me from myself
Redeem me from my disfigurement

Still no sign of your trust
Have you forgotten me?
Longs days and hollow nights
I've been wandering through the void
Yet I rather die million more deaths than crave alone
