Pale spring morning
All silent and cold
Then I am longing for you
And I am calling for you
(Do you feel my pain?!)

One Last Breath
Before emptiness consumes my soul
Now I must face this all by myself

It has been so long
And I still see you
In front of me I still feel your
Warm embrace
Your spirit lies within me eternally

In this sea of misery
I can't swim
Be my guide and I will follow you

One Last breath
Before emptiness consumes my soul
Now I must face this all by myself

(This all by myself...)
