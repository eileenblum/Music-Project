This is my home
The place where my heart belongs
A place where life was spent and love was born

In the corner of our gloomy room
Photographs are scattered
Waiting to be viewed once more

Old memories
Of how we used to be
Dreams to fulfill
I see it fading...

I am slowly fading
I am slowly fading from your life...

Long after the last breaths were taking
I am still clinging to your bond
Compelled to endure what life had given

Eternal grief
Will never cease to be
Lorn destiny
My heart is gasping...

I am slowly fading
I am slowly fading from your life...
Let me still be a part of you
I am waiting for your sign

Old memories, dreams to fulfill
I see it fading from me...
Eternal grief, lorn destiny
My heart is gasping

I am slowly fading
I am slowly fading from your life...
Let me still be a part of you
I am waiting for your sign
