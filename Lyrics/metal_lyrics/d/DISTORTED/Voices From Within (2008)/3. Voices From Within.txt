Whispers
Are reaching out through the walls
Speaking to me
Lost and scared they wonder
Secretly in need

Voices are wishing to be heard
Life's screaming my name
Through the blindness I see
That you are craving for me...

And when night time falls
I still hear your voice calling
Your pain is marked upon my soul

Raving, I'm raving to your ears
Please hear me now
Shade away those blank moments
Of silence...

And when night time falls
I still hear your voice calling
You pain is marked upon my soul

From within I am yearning
To reconcile with my loss
Guide me through the unknown
