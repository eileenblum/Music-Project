All I have asked to find
Has insistently been denied
I have failed in reaching the goal

I have failed you
My broken soul

This voyage must come to an end
There is no other way
What the future holds I do not know
Obscure to me, darkened this road

After seeking every possible way
To make you acknowledge my presence
No words are left to say
That can affect your
Fragile existence

This voyage must come to an end
There is no other way
What the future holds I do not know
Obscure to me, darkened this road
