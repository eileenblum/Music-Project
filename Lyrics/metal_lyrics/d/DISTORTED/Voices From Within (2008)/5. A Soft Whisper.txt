It seems like you have fallen
So deep no one can reach
Inside is so dark
The light can't shine through your eyes

How I wish you would hear...

Fly away
To you I softly whisper
Outshine and fade
Where no harm can reach you

It feels like the candle
Struggles to maintain its flame
As you lost the fire
Something died within

For a while
Just set your mind free
Revive and let your heart
Fill up again with hope...

How I wish you would hear...

Fly away
To you I softly whisper
Outshine and fade
Where no harm can reach you

Yet you chose to stay
In a place that lost you
All I wish you would say
I hear you...
