My essence has gone astray
My whole reflection is crushing down
Now I am evading my beliefs
And saying goodbye

Descending from what seemed to be
So infinite and strict
Into the depth of a consistent duality

The light at the edge of my life
Drifted far from my sight
As the time goes by
I would keep on falling...

I shudder to think my instincts
May mislead me
Self-anguished by a wreath of thorns
Entwined with shame

The light at the edge of my life
Drifted far from my sight
As the time goes by
I would keep on falling...
