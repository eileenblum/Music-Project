The time has come to realize
The meaning of saying goodbye
To accept and not deny
To let go and fade into the night

In your heart
In your mind
Will you find me?
Through the dark
Deep inside
Will you find me?
When I'm gone
Will you find me?

The time has come to understand
That I am nothing but a shade
I am beyond the decayed
I am among the dead

In your heart
In your mind
Will you find me?
Through the dark
Deep inside
Will you find me?
When I'm gone
Will you find me?

The time is right
To let go the past
To walk towards the light
Become one with the insight

In your heart
In your mind
Will you find me?
Through the dark
Deep inside
Will you find me?
When I'm gone
Will you find me?

In your heart
In your mind
I will find you
Through the dark
Deep inside
I will find you
When I'm gone
I will always find you

Deep inside...
In my heart...
