Trail of fear led us to believe
That we can no longer trust
In the wind which carried us

Is it the wind that will sweep us all away
Deep into the storm
Where the silence wears many forms
Is it the wind that will sweep us all away?

Are we so blind to see
That the lives we all living in
Are no longer for free

I can't escape from those thoughts
Why the wind left me to rot
In these evil ways of life
Trapped between both sides

And we hold the blame
To the one who carries the shame
