A piece of heaven was taken into infinity
And revealed itself as illusive
Unforeseen sadness dying dreams
It all got lost in time

The future seems to be well known
Still nothing lays solid
The mysterious path I am walking on
Drifts me back into the past

To see you crushing into the shades
Of your darkest fears
Those predicted sights were never expected to be so real

And through a vail of pain you have realized
What have I become
What have I always been

I shall fear no more
Of being left aside
By your unfulfilling devotions
Clarity is now ahead of me
I am craving for revenge
But still restraining silently
