This one man dedicated his life
To change the face of history
To break into six milion pieces
The spirit of a nation
All on its own
So hated and haunted
Yet so storng

No remorse for those
Who carried kain's mark
Redemption
No redemption for our brothers blood

Lately it seems like morality
Has been forgotten again
For we have already known
This kind of pain.

For this promised land
This holy soil
We pay a price in blood
In our mothers broken dreams
In our fathers grieving hearts.

In our mothers broken dreams
In our fathers grieving hearts
We allow this endless sins
In the name of our god

Our breed
The damned seed
Dictated from above
