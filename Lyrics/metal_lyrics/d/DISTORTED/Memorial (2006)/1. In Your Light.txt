I can't feel you no more
Dark pain within me
To be in your light again
I would give the world

Pale all the colors without you
Only shapes of despair
Silent I will remain forever
My joy will be kept away

I fear the void that surrounding
Where your grace and beauty cease to exist as desolation grows deeper
The more I am drifting in your mist

With every momnet that dies
I still see the light leave your eyes
And the emptiness that follows reminds me how deep is my sorrow
