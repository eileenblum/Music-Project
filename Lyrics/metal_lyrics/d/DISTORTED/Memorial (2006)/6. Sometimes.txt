You are drowning me
Sometimes
In your sea of coldness
There is fear
In your eyes
Despite you are frealess

Open to me
Let yourself out

You are hiding me
Sometimes
From your deepest feelings
There is happiness
Despite your sadness

Show me! let yourself see
Free me! let yourslef be

Now feel a delightful pleasure
One flash - another glamour
Share with me my shining sparkle
