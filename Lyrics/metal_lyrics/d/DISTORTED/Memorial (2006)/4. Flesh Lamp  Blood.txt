Rain of death covered the earth
And the land lost it's beloveds

As shallow as his heart can be
He still fears for his flesh and blood

It is the father himself
Showering the rain of shame

Tears froze into our souls
And left us with this cold hate
Towards life and it's existence

Our eyes have seen it all
Our hearts wept it's own tears
We saw the fear of all fears

The suffering is deeper
Deeper than out belief

Our suffering is deeper
Deeper than out belief
And the search for light
Is no more filling our needs
