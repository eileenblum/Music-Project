Our fate has been sealed for life
To pace among our haters
To constantly defend our every move
To watch our back from danger

Desperation and frustration
Blurred our sight
We twine our hands with violence
We corrupt our minds with hate
Longing for guidance
That will bring us to the light...

And what is left for us but suffering?
Only names engraved
On cold stones forever
No one to follow the name
No one to hear them

Memories of the days
When we once felt no fear
The sound of laughter
We used to hear
No true joy would ever find
A place in our hearts
Nothing could bring our souls
Its warmth back

What are we asking for
To end this worthless war
For you to reach out for us
When we are calling your name
For you to comfort us
When we are losing this game

For how long we'll keep on living
In the dark
What more have you
Designed for us

We are falling one by one
Together we are dying
But not as one!
