I drove my feet through a desert
Whose mirage fluttered like a host.
Voracious for glory, greedy for danger,
I roamed the horizons of al â Kulab,
Watching time level mountains
In its search and its hunger for me.
And I saw the sparrows swiftly approach,
Bolder then the onrushing wolf.
They spread in the tree of my youth.
I heard the flock in my branches.
And was caught on their beaks and claws!
Frank Herbert
Inside crystal mountain
Evil takes itâs formâ¦
[Chuck Schuldiner]

There was a man so wise,
He jumped into
A sandy place
And burnt out both his eyes!
And when he knew his eyes were gone,
He offered no complaint
He summoned up a vision
And made himself a saint.
[Frank Herbert]

Wonât you join me on the perennial quest
Reaching into the dark, retrieving light
Search for answers on the perennial quest
Where dreams are followed, and time is a test.
[Chuck Schuldiner]

[Solo: Artyom]

My soul is bisected,
Threads of mind are torn.
Will journey through darkness ever end?
Will I finish alone?

Iâm an outcast to people
Who are breaking my bones
My body is full of cuts and scars,
Thrown at with stones.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Iâm fed up with blood and flesh

[Chorus:]
But you wonât see my tears
âCause my eyes are sewn
You wonât hear my screams
âCause my mouth is erased
The world is turning away from me
But Iâll be the first one to reject the decaying society.

Whirls of thoughts spin in your head
What do you worship in your life
Better forget.

Rain washes away
Mud and blood from my face
I donât remember what time really is
Living through nights and dying through days.

Close your eyes, take my hand
You will see the clarity with your mental sight.

[Solo: Artyom]

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Waves of hatred pierce in your mind
When you look through the prism of reality
Better be blind.

Iâm the last pilgrim on this perennial quest
In search of crystal mountain which delenda est.
