Satan: âMe miserable! Which way shall I fly
Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hellâ¦â
[John Milton]

In the vortex of fire I move through the countless flock of the godforsaken ones to the stage, which reminds me
a block.

[Pre-Chorus:]
I see remains of their eyes flowing down their cheeks.
Crack of their skin deafens me.
The waves of sufferings and pain are washing me.

[Chorus:]
My wail of compassion drowns in the tongues of flame.
Hundreds of strings tighten me â
Immaculate harvester of mankind â the one to blame.

I scorn myself, contemplating what Iâve done with these helpless beings
With their Now, turned to None.

[Solo: Artyom]

Iâm melting with poisonous smoke
I leak â Iâm squashed shriek â Iâm a flow.
I am bleeding with tears of flame, going into nothing,
To return in epochs again.

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
