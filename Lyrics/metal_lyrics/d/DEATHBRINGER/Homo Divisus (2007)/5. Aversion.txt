Mein Grauen, mein Ekel, mein Erbarmen, all
mein Gutes und Schlimmes schrie mit einem
Schrei aus mir.
[F.Nietzsche]

Why should we live feeding our minds with deaths of others?
Behold how world has changed, but weâre the same beasts with atrophied feelings like others.

[Pre-Chorus:]
Distorting and smashing the rational world

[Chorus:]
Every day we become more addicted to devastation
Breaking the boundaries of what is unknown, weâre still counting on absolution.
Trying to hide from ourselves and failing to find compassion
Weâre omnipotent human beings who still are afraid of existence of a God.
Why?

When the hatred was born in our minds?
Who pulls the strings?
Prepare for another lie, flowing with thoughts, filled with paralyzed dreams of becoming blind.
