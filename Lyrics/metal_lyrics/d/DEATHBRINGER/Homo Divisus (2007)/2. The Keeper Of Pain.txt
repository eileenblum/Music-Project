I recreate the dimensions of pure sorrow
Collect the pieces of inner pain
I absorb the sufferings and follow
The blackened, sharpened blade of fate.

Look inside my mind
What you gonna see?
Souls full of scars
Mirror of reality.

I dissect the nothingness and fill it with squealing silence.

[Solo: Artyom]

Look inside my mind
What you gonna see?
Bounty of pain
Shattering world inside me.

I scrutate the minds that are formal
And search for grief, filtering lies.
You may say: itâs abnormal
I wonât even deny.

My perception of the world is too distinctive
No rest for the keeper of pain
Do not feel sorry for me
The purport of my life you wonât explain.

[Solo: Artyom]
