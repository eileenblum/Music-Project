Rise 
My child 
Crazed 
By dire 
Desires 

I hear the sound breaking down 
Inside the shards of silence lie 

Ghosts 
Take hold 
Of your soul! 
Paralyzed 
Immobilized 
You are drawn 
Down! 

Run! 

Dream your own world 
and do not share that reality with anyone else 
Just fall into infinity, or rise to the glorious heights 
Itâs all just a little slice of death 

Iâm flying high 
I hear the sound 
Of eager desire 
I've been just 

Hiding in these fading nightmares, 
Waiting, craving, wanting to be found! 

Youâre weak and fading as 
Youâre dying fast inside my realm!
