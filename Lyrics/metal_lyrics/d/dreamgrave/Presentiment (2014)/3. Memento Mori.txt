Watch 
The 
Body 
Shake in the wind 

Your 
Wretched 
Being 
Ceased to exist! 

Beneath the sound of storming 
Blurred evening sky 
A scaffold stands right 
(The) cord drifts side to side 

Fleering the heathen pacing 
Numbness deprived 
The shackles too tight 
This time he will abide 

Facing the rope, head held high 
Through the mire 
A distant sound starts 
(To) overflow his mind 

Razing the hope for new life 
Final demise 
A scream breaks out now 
Silence veils around 

Thrown up a dime falling down 
A frozen time 
The coin slips down 
Evil smiles arise 

Hailing the man back inside 
A thousand(th) times	
Disarrayed breakdown 
Redemption nullified
