Pride of gods flows inside your heart 
Ignorance bloomed wisdom, an untouchable mind 
Is there even one who can rise 
To the hights of your glory, are you satisfied 

That 
You're 
The one? 
You?! 
Are 
Our 
God?! 

My radiance outglows everyone 
Iâm perfect and Iâm the one. 

As you lay there in your dead dreams 
Your self-pride shrinks away! 
While spiritâs dance around you 
To save you, not to kneel before you! 

Weigh all my dreams 
Again to see 
My reality 
Going 
Down, broken shards 
Of unseen lies 
Raging through my mind 
Lay down 

Between these raging memories 
A veil of lightness spirals me down 
Black spiral 
Increasing inner despise 
Recoiling my relentless self pride 
Itâs too far! 
Itâs far too late to stand by 
The spiral slowly hauls me inside 
My own mind 

Now I begin to subside 
Immerse into my darker side
