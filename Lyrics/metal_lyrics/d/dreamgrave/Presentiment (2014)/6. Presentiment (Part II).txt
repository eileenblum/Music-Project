Fear passes through my veins and spirals down 
Enclaved by realms of struggling mortal lies 
Imagined plague-amorph screams rushing through my mouth 
To find out why do I 
Have this fear from downward lines 
Roads from high-up to the ground 
Memorized lines stating that itâs allright 
In time itâs gonna be fine
