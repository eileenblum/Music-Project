Born of winter 
Feel the fire 
Isolation 
Fading light 
Enfolded in this 
Dark eerie spiral 
Waiting for me 
Everlasting eye 

That binds my soul defiled 
To find my own demise 
To find my soul defiled 

But I know Iâm alive 
And darknessâs just the lack of light 
And I know Iâm alive 
And Iâll fight my demise
