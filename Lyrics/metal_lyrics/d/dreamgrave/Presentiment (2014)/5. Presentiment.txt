I feel safe inside 
Hiding under these blanket wrapped around 
To keep this world out 
Breath out 

Breath in this feeling 
Absorb the night followed by 
Nightmares crawling in to my 
Own mind 
Breath in and out 
Now 

Pressure, burden on her neck 
By this presentiment 

Nightmares pull me 
Down this drain 
Away from every humane means 
This day painted so surreal 
Giving in to the ocean of growing fear 
But stay and hail 
The Gods of insane 
Fractured dreams, overpriced pictures 
And your need for everything 
That you can get your 
Hands on 

Seeking the light 
Weighing whatâs on my mind 
Signs align 
Holding back my eyes 
To see what lies there what future denies to 
Tell when we all hear the sound of the tide 
Rush by 
But I can just never hope to find out 
Oh my, why I 
Feel Iâll die 

We have no idea, now, of who or what the inhabitants of our future might be. In that sense, we have no future. [...] For us things can change so abruptly, so violently, so profoundly, that futures like our elders' have insufficient 'now' to stand on. We have no future because our present is too volatile. ... We have only risk management. The spinning of the given moment's scenarios. 

Breathe in this feeling 
Absorb the night followed by 
Nightmares crawling in to my 
Own mind 
Breath in and out 

Hope has no meaning 
Devoured by traces from 
Times we have not yet arrived 
Grey-dark 
Dissaray in my 
Heart
