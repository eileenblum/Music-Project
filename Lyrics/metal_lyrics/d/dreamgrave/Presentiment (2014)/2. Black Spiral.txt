Vortical, teared apart, raging disillusions 
Razing your unworthy existence 
Rupturing, puncturing disassembling pressure 
Immortal death, feeding the Black Spiral 

Storms far and wide 
An eerie corroding sound 
And piercing light 
Burns through the dark 
Dissolving my 
Blinded ephemeral confine 
Absurd delight 
Failing death, come and meet me now! 
Unending decline 
Purging darkness, says goodnight 
Inhumed alive in this 
Vortex of loss pulling me deeper inside 

Boiling, sickening reality disorder 
Unholy shadows, flaming darkness 
Primeval, infinite shards of distant silence 
Imprinting us all into the Black Spiral 

Rage filled gaping hole 
Pulls me down this unending slope 
Eternal doom 
Disembodied undertow 
Along the way 
Twisted fear and pain prevail 
But who am I? 
My memories fading away 

Vortical, teared apart, raging disillusions 
Razing your unworthy existence 
Rupturing, puncturing disassembling pressure 
Immortal death, feeding the Black Spiral 

Veil on my eyes 
Blinded by immortal demise 
A raving smile 
An enfolding night 
Closing up on me 
Full of agony 
Primeval fearâs 
Melting me 
Fierce delusions fade away 
Finally I can see 
I donât belong 
In here
