She lies, in her eyes
Denies, hates to realize
How unjust she tried

Making love in the waking dawn
The first time he descries the lie
The first time i feel no sorrow

Lovers dig graves towards the lane
For senses theyâd ever shared
Yearn for feelings they never felt

Why, oh why, my lousy love
Waved your goodbye
Fighting hearts, a prim dance in the dark
Your turns are cold shards
Casting rays of lust

Blur the lines, memories shaking up
This world of ours,
Drifting through the tides of sorrow bound to our desires
To feel loved, to burn got carried us
High up the skies, where tears
Are raining down,
(we) drown,
(we) vow,
(we) fade

[Hungarian:]
Szerelem, szerelem
Ãtkozott gyÃ¶trelem
MÃ©râ nem virÃ¡goztÃ¡l
Minden fa tetejen
Minden fa tetejen,
CÃ©drusfa levelen

De nem az a rÃ³zsa, ki kiskertben nyÃ­lik,
Hanem az a rÃ³zsa, ki egymÃ¡st szereti

[English translation:
"Love love,
Wretched suffering,
Why donât you blossom
On top of every tree,
On top of every tree,
On a cedar leaf.

A rose cannot blossom
In too small a garden,
Not like the rose that blossoms
When you love one another."]
