Enter the atrium of prominence
Shiver at pedestal of monuments
No grasp on stone skin of excellence

Marching on dark fabric
Saluting their megalith
Eyes on target
The time has come!

Chains in hands
Strain to heavens
Crawl oâ many
To fake greatness

Gravestone of a companion
Flickering vigor
Passing rotting lifetime
Lesion at heart open wide

You strive behind the blind for a lifetime
Collecting fragments of a lie

Headstones far on the horizon
Reliefs of lies you adore for
Heart lit eyes are floating over
Burning the candles for no more

Crash all the pointless paths undone
Of your thieves of life you've born for
Heart lit eyes will guide you over
Drop your last candle and move on

Free your mind
Your soul be your guide
Disown the night
Embrace the light
Or they won't let you
Fly!

You're lavishing all your life
Following fantasies
Dark and dull gets everything you touch

In a vanishing reality
In hoping for arrival
Weary humanity is craving and believing in you

To find your peace you desire
Donât mourn your life now

Sane shoved aside
Favor a life in a fairytale
Forged wishes overflow and make you complete
At the monuments of lies
