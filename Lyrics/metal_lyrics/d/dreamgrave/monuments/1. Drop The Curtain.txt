The cold of winter flows through
My dream of whispered sorrow
The worldâs below my feet
To find a piece â engraved to remain â
Of memory long lost

I stashed away my fire,
I forged my own barbwire
To me, the days gone by
Remain so lost in time, never found
Again in my own mind

Eyes of sigh now wave goodbye
Dreams of past lives simplified
Breaking down
And rise to the cloud
Where are my keys now?
