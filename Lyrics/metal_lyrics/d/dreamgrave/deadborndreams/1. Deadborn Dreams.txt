I close my eyes
To reach the unknown
Every unseen
Myth of my past

Fallen memories melt into my tears
I recess from the light into deepening darkness
Frustrations tension eludes in me
Damn myself by this eternal restlessness

As a misbegotten child iâm lying low
In my cradle I stained evermore
My dishonest face from God I must turn
Let all the sin bury me under

I close my eyes
To reach the unknown
Every unseen myth
Of my past

I banished my single chance to leave the hole
My final judgement will never come
Itâs darkening by my soul, I lay dying
Beside the grave of my deadborn dreams
