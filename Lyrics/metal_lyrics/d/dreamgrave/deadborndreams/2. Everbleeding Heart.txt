Fading walks the sun on a twilit sky
Casting rays on withered lands
Lands of unheard cries, demented minds
Silence deafens me again
And maybe the last time

I just want to believe
That we will once leave
All this darkness
Nothing seems to change
The endless rage
Tears us all apart
All those unspoken words
Those feelings covered
Hurl me into madness
Noone really can heal
With blood refill
My everbleeding heart

Distant echoes of rustling leaves
Play the windâs serene piece
Notes fall dead on the instant as
The sun saunters under then sets
Leaves the world to suffocate

I just want to believe
That we will once leave
All this darkness
Nothing seems to change
The endless rage
Tears us all apart
All those unspoken words
Those feelings covered
Hurl me into madness
Noone really can heal
With blood refill
My everbleeding heart
