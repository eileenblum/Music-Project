Itâs a failure of mine
For all the ages I cry
Lost the long endeavour
Missing the final lifeline

Pushing the will:
Getting over the strain
Being alive? â I have been
I feel dearth deep within

The fears immerse down
In the water I drown
When the sea shall release me dead
No might keeps me intact

I donât want this
Only I could not take this
Itâs time to shake off
The shell â void and hollow
Born beyond again
My sick heart I have thrown away

Awayâ¦

But it comes far, inevitably
The fallen leaves
From the tree of dreams
Tear me to pieces
And the life of the world comes to an end
Through my soul,
Amen.
