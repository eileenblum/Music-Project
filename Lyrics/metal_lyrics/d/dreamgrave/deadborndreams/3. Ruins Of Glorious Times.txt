From forgotten lands
I hear the voice of their chants
Itâs not otherâs sense
Itâs everyoneâs absence

Plead forgiveness father
I could not stand the fight
To defend firmly those dying ways
From much of their immortality gains
As Iâm marching through ruins of glorious times
The velvet shroud of darkness falls down
And the land below it becomes
A bottomless moat of blackness

All my dreams dissolved by now
Life left bleeding in my soiled hands
Solitude, painâ¦
The last things left for me

As I lay into the dead leaves
I cry at all remains
While spirits gather around
And pull me underground
