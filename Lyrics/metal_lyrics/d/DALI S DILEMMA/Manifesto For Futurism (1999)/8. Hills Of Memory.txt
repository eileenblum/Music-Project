I wait for emotion
For what I feel, for what I see
To fear myself, to fear illusion
The more they love, the more I bleed

I will decide 
The sun will shine
I can't go on now
My hope is unsung

Suddenly I'm blinded
Now I walk along 
I walk along these memories 

It guides my soul
The thirst is quenched with company
My conscience yells but I don't hear it
Forever sleep

It's getting dark 
I'm clenched with fear
Please let me go
I must exit here

Suddenly I'm blinded
Now I walk along 
I walk along these memories 

You took my hand, banished reality 
I was afraid, but yet I starred

We all grow cold, the memory fades away
Some lives worth some betrayed 
Look into your heart to live externally

I will decide the sun will shine
I can't go on my now hope is unsung

Suddenly I am blinded 
Now I walk along 
I walk along these memories
