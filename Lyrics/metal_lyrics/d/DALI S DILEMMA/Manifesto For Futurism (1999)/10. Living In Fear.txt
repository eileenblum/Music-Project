The light remains on tonight
A blanket is my shield
Right from the start, I'm falling
Slow motion, I try to scream
Nobody hears the muted cries 
Dreams are crashing from side to side
Fading away, before me
Lying helpless can barely breathe 

Living in his fear until the break of dawn
And your hand lies just out of reach 
So I'm calling your name to the sky 
I hope that someday you'll reply 

So I'm calling your name to the sky 
And maybe someday you'll reply

He's feeling the emptiness 
The absence of the voice 
So many days, so many promises  
Retrace the years I knew you
Faded away, before me
Lying helpless, can barely breathe 
Nobody hears the muted cries 
Dreams are crashing from side to side

Living in his fear until the break of dawn
And your hand lies just out of reach 
So I'm calling your name to the sky 
I hope that someday you'll reply 

So I'm calling your name to the sky 
And maybe someday you'll reply

One day you're here, the next you're gone
In a spinning world, in this spinning world
Your memory lives on

The light stays on tonight
A blanket is my shield 
Right from the start, I'm falling
Slow motion, I try to scream 
Nobody hears the muted cries
Dreams are crashing from side to side
Fading away, before me 
Lying helpless can barely breathe

Living in his fear until the break of dawn
And your hand lies just out of reach 
So I'm calling your name to the sky 
I hope that someday you'll reply 

So I'm calling your name to the sky 
And maybe someday you'll reply
