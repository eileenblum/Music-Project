Frozen from the sunlight
And burning from the cold
Reciting contradictions
On this dead-end road
He tries to keep his balance
Tries to not look scared
While sinking in ambitions
As everybody stares

Words twist too often
I'm dizzy from the ride
Spare the next moment
It's a wonder I'm alive

Can't you see
I'm trapped in shame
And I'm the only one to blame 
Can't you see
There's nowhere to turn
And I'm the only one to blame

The days go on forever
The sun will never set
As long as I'm convicted 
I'll have no regrets
Can see the finish line
But tell me what's to gain 
And is it worth the life-long race
Only to endure more pain

Words twist too often
I'm dizzy from the ride
Spare the next moment
It's a wonder I'm alive

Can't you see
I'm trapped in shame
And I'm the only one to blame 
Can't you see
There's nowhere to turn
And I'm the only one to blame

All that you thought about
Was it something unseen behind all of your hidden doubt
You find a way to make it 
Perfect time and motion 
Was it that you really wanted
Was it all that you really need
I watched you try 
I watched you fail
All the while you're trapped in shame 

Words twist too often
I'm dizzy from the ride
Spare the next moment
It's a wonder I'm alive

Can't you see?
I'm trapped in shame
And I'm the only one to blame 
Can't you see
I'm trapped in shame
There's nowhere to turn
And I'm the only one to blame
