I've seen your face, in the frame
The cobwebs on the ceiling
I count the days and wasted years 
That left me with this feeling

I'm growing cold and tired now
I need a new, depression
Reaching blind, at anything 
Save me from the destruction 

Hope and dreams were built upon
The ground that wasn't there 
Given all there was to give
It echoes though the hall

Awaken to find the view 
Strange and unfamiliar
Question you question me 
Second-guess reality

Another try left a scar
Reached for me, but reached too far
So far away, so far from you
I see again, I see through you

Gain and fades so quickly now 
It fades from above
He lifts himself up off the floor
To watch the moonless night

He's running from the darkness
Into another day
Yielding hope and valor
As silence fades away

Watch them burn, all their bridges 
Watch them walk, out of time
Say you won't , won't work whit me
I suggest you get it right 

I'm growing cold and tired now
I need a new, depression
Reaching blind, at anything 
Save me from the destruction 

Hope and dreams were built upon
The ground that wasn't there 
Given all there was to give
It echoes though the hall
