King of the stage
Slave to the mirror
He passes the time
In a struggle with fear

How can you turn away time after time?
There's always somebody waiting in line 

Hang on to the fever that burns inside of you
Don't hunt for lost treasure 
You won't find it there

This time around

Tainted thoughts grow
While he paces the floor 
Aimless and weird 
Impatiently wanting more

How can you turn away time after time? 
There's always somebody waiting in line

Hang on to the fever that burns inside of you
Don't hunt for lost treasure 
You won't find it there

This time around

Trial by tear and the truth be ignored
Sun setting near with the light being ignored
Hopeless journey achieving relief
Opening window that will set my heart free

How can you turn away time after time? 
There's always somebody waiting in line

Hang on to the fever that burns inside of you
Don't hunt for lost treasure 
You won't find it there

This time around
