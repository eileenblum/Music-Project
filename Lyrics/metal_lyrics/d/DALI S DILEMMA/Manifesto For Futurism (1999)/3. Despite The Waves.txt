Living everyday 
Trapped behind the walls
And it's something you defend 

Pain is in your eyes
You're holding back the tears
So why is it that you pretend?

And all this time you've hidden the abuse
But now you have a way out
It's your life, just choose

So afraid but not for long
You'll brave the sea despite the waves
Now it's time to shear your fears
And trough them all away 
You braved the sea despite the waves

Walked amongst the shadows
Through the chilling air of dusk
Once again, but not alone

Waiting all your life for destiny
To shatter these four walls
And set, you free

So afraid but not for long
You'll brave the sea despite the waves
Now it's time to shear your fears
And trough them all away  
You braved the sea despite the waves

Visions in deep sleep 
Racing through the mind
Will he ever dream again? 

Visions in deep sleep
So vivid and serene
How he wants to dream again

Waiting all your life for destiny
To shatter these four walls
And set, you free

So afraid but not for long
You'll brave the sea despite the waves
Now it's time to shear your fears 
And trough them all away
You braved the sea despite the waves
