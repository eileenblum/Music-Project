I Dread The Great Winged Insects
And The Cat-Headed Butterflies;
Above All The Fleshy Wings
Of The Birds
Trying To Clutch Me.
At Times I Thought
I Was A Glass Bowl
And I Trembled
Fearing To Be Cracked.
Or I Felt As If
I Had Committed
A Horrible Crime
(But... Which One?)
Sinking Off (Only)
At Night.

Then I Was In A Vast Garden
And I Cut The Tree In The Middle,
"Tree Of The Knowledge
Of Good And Evil"
Building A Vessel
That I Named "Narrenschiff"
And I Sailed Through
Black Waves Of Clotted Blood,
Closing My Eyes....

When I Opened Them
I Was Sitting On The Throne,
With The Terror
Of An Endless Hiccup.
Anxiety
Not To Walk On The Lines,
I Carry On Numbering Things
Till I Forget How Many
Then I Start Again...

I Don't Give A Damn
For Caligula: Just His Horse!
And I'm Bored By
Julius Caesar's
Thousands Words
To Cross The Rubycon Only.

"The Mirror! The Mirror!
The Mirrored Life!"
Same And Adverse
The Real And Its Stage,
Flesh And Blood Puppets
In The Scene Of The Game.
Bitches To Power
The Army Is A Ballet
Empty The Treasure
In Everyone's Hands!

"The Mirror! The Mirror!
The Mirrored Life!"

Sitting Alone In The Empty Pit,
Me,
The Laughing Man,
Innocent Or Absurd,
Not As Death
Living One Instant,
But As The Planet
Diverse And Deformed
Watching The Earth
Beyond The Mirror.

Now You, Just You:
Child.
Staring At Me From The World
-Built On Eternal Repetitions-
Behind The Mirror.
Crack My World From Side To Side
Kill Me With Every Day.
To Walk Together
Upon The Sea...

Life
Is A State
Of Mind.
