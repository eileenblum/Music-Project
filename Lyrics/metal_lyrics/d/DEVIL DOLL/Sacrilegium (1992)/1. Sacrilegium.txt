Sacrilegium:
Profanatio Omnium Quae Deo
Vel Sanctis Propositis Consecrantur.

For Long Endless Millions Of Instants
I Drank At The Goblet Of Illusion
Tilling Tumours And Follies
Desperately Wandering
Through The Dark Tunnels
Of The Bone Box
Then, Submitting,
I Chose To Drown
In The Ashes Of My Dreams.
When Purity Is Raped
Three Days Are Not Enough
To Resurrect:
Everywhere
Leprosy Spreads Out,
The Light Of The Eyes
Is Extinguished,
Thunders Now Shatter
The Eardrums,
The Scream Is:
"The Plague Be On You!"

The Dust
I Used To Build
The Impalpable Reality
Of My Nights
Brings Me Back
Along The Paths
Where I Scattered
Useless Hopes.

Believe!
Can I Trust You?
No, Please, Don`T!
Can I Trust You?
Forever, Really, Forever!
Oaths Engraved In The Water...

Obey!
As A Child, Or An Idiot
Who Follows The Laws
Of The Xxxx Others?
Quicksands Have Just One
Unrelenting Goal.
Bon Voyage, Mon Amour...

Fight!
That Invisible Enemy
Nestled Behind Those
Gorgeous, False, Sharp
Smiles

In Order To Conquer The Future: And Destroy It!
I Go Back -Once More- Into The Abyss Of My Nothing.
You Know
The Dead Have The Virtue Of Looking Like Each Other.

It Seems Like Yesterday
We Were Children
And Playing At Running
After Each Other;
You Would Often Lock Me
In The Dark Cellar,
And I Implored:
"Please Open!"
I Used To Run Trampling On
The Little Heads
-Cut Off-
Spread Ripe On The Lawn
We Had No Mother
So We`Re Taking Turns
In Being Her.
You Were Visiting My Dreams
Leaving To Snow
Through Almost
Closed Fingers
Glittering Crystals
Of Verginal Illusions.

Time Seemed Our Brother
Until The Deadly Night
Twisted, I Preserved You
-Jealously- Beside Me.
Gelid, Adorned With
The Damned Cloths
Of The Sudden
Silence....
....While
Dreamful...
....I Offered You
A Smile....
....In A Suspended Flash
The Spirit....
....Was Plucked Away
By The....
....Sacrilege Of Fatal Arms!

Forever!
Remember?
Forever!
I Kept The Secret

"Where Is The Bride?"
"Forsaken Him!"
"Fleeing The Deceived"
"Left Him Alone!"

Talk, Talk
You Fools!

Forever I Wanted
Still, Lifeless And Empty
The Shadow Of You
To Lie On
The Bridal Couch
Where You Laughed
Astonished
Minding The Tales
Bizarre And Contorted
I Told You Every Night
Prior To Submitting
To The Empire Of The Dark.

Mors At Suae Cohortis Ludus:
"Anathema, Anathema Tibi!"
Arcani Vis Et Natura:
"Anathema, Anathema Tibi!"

They Who Know, Do Not Speak!
They Who Talk, Do Not Know!
"Maledictus! Maledictus!"

We Are Just Sketches Of Men
Caught In A Wicked Vortex
Where Tertium Non Datur
Between Being God
Or Being Damned.

But, After All,
Isn`T It True That
An Inaudible Suggestion,
An Ineffable Remorse,
A Secret Instinct
Reveal The Impurity
Hidden In Success,
The Vulgarity Of Victory,
The Filth Nestling
In Fortune:
Pure Purity
Absolute Catharsis,
Is In Misadventure,
In Tragedy,
In One`S Ineluctable
Check Mate.

And When The Lights Dim
And Falls Slowly The Curtain,
I Return To Dance In A Ring
With The Skeleton Man
And The Bearded Lady,
The Bird-Boy And
The Laughing Dwarf;
Among Dragons
And Avenging Angels,
Winged Maidens
And Herds Of Blind Men
Who Bark
With Open Wide Orbits
Taking Me At Last
To The World Where
Uncertainty Does Not Exist.

In Heaven. Or Underground.
