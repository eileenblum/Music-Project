You lay there fast asleep courtesy of the chloroform
You lay there fast asleep what have youd done?
I want you to wake up realize you are not home, to assure no escape
You have made,to yourself. I want you to meet a friend of min,now
Unlike you this will not be quick and easy
Mr. Cellophane, I want you to meet a friend of mine......Mr. Cellophane
Save your breathe,you will need it
Dont forget to look in my wretched fucking eyes,die
As you slowly die,think voices...voices telling you,you are dead.
