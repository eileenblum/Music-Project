If I had one wish it would be to create a monster
So fucking fierce, it would fall from the skies above
Falling towards earth with a roar
Striking fear into the heart of the world
This is what we all might need
This is the dawn of a new beginning,the rebirth of the earth
Wipe away the history of man, wipe away the thought of tomorrow
Tearing through your bridges and your buildings
Ripping shit down, screams of horor fill the air
There goes the town
There goes the greed
Humans are a pitiful being,full of lies and greed
Full of deception, full of lies and greed
No more tomorrow, no more today
Run no where to hide, run like theres no tomorrow
Bring all the world to its knees.
