[feat. Frankie Palmeri of Emmure]Somewhere down the road
We took the wrong path
Blinded by the color of money
We're led by those with bad heart
Sit there strapp to that chair
This is your last chance, for forgiveness
You cant buy your way out of this
This is your last chance, for forgiveness sit there strapped to that chair
Revolution starts with us
Confide in lies, No
Set aside your differences,we can move mountains
Nothing is impossible, we must stand strong
Over come lifes obstacles, we must learn from our mistakes
Nothing is impossible we must stand strong
This is your last chance, for forgiveness
Pray to the god you love, pray
Greed consumed his life, his life
This is judgement time, get ready to embrace your death
Fry/Rise
Lights flickering,as the chair sparks
Your body trembles,as your life fades into the dark
Your body trembles
As the chair sparks
Your body slipps into the dark
War/Rise.
