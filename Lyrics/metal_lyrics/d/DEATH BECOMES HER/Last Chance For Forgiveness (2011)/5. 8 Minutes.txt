Agent....of chaos
Breed to kill
I am agent of chaos
All of your fears in one
No escape to this nightmare
Lock your doors at night, dont go outside
I'll be there waiting for you,everywhere you go
I am the shadow, the shadow
Over your shoulder, your shoulder
The anticipation of death is worse than death itself
They anticipateyour death
Left in the sewer, excpected to die, I crawled back to life,rebuilt on revenge
I will find you and make you suffer.
