Fading in and out of my consciousness, a sword pierced through my chest
I have fallen.loud noises,i hear screaming.
My life flashes before my eyes
Slipping away
My life flashes before my eyes
With no way back
Falling into forever
Losing my grasp
My life flashes before my eyes
Victims of war
I'd sell my soul for one more chance at life
But this isnt a fairy tale
No happy ending
This is the real world
I,gave my life to a country...that doesnt even get it
I,gave my life to a country...that doesnt even give a shit
Battle field full of corpse,all for a thoughtless war
Bodies lying in pieces (where is your god?)
A sky full of blood (where is your god?)
Cries for help (where is your god?)
To end this misery (where is your god?)
It's my own damn fault
Faught for a thoughtless war
It's my own damn fault
I should have walked away.
