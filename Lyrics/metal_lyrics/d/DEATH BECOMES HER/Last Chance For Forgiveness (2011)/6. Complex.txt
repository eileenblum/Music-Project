Excuse is your middle
just what i expected
Another walking let down
just what I expected
blame others for your problems
just what I expected
refusing to except the truth
in this vast existence
your life is insignificant
nothing to the universe
less then nothing on earth
die! alive &amp; alone you will die unknown
I promised myself that I wouldnt be like you
I have a backbone
you cling to others for support
lying your way into their hearts
you treat life likes its one big one chairty
but even a free ride runs out of gas
utter disgust,fills my body
bottom feeder feeding on my end trails
you will not amount to anything
bottom feeder feeding on my end trail
I will snap your fucking neck
nothing to the universe
less then nothing on earth
alive &amp; alone you will die unknown
rot.
