[Music by GermÃ¡n, lyrics by Anna LÃ³pez]

It was the strangest of the days.
I knew I wasnât still prepared.
She touched her belly with my hand.
This episode was so unplanned.
I know exactly how I felt,
but in this language canât be spelt.
It was the day I blamed myself
for calling you a big mistake.

I thought my life would no longer go further
How could I blame it on you?

I believe MIRACLES are not for me
but I can swear I hear a melody
every time youâre close to me.
I believe MIRACLES are for me
but I can swear I lose my gravity
every time youâre next to me.

It was the greatest of the days.
I felt your breath across my chest .
You grabbed my finger with one hand,
I suddenly became a man.
I know exactly what I held,
but in this language canât be spelt.
It was the day I said my life was blessed
with you inside my nest.
