[Music by Sergio and Ana, lyrics by Chris]

Wait, please I donât want to go.
Iâm still not prepared to say goodbye.
You should have never gone.
Iâm walking on a line but there is no choice,
thereâs no return.
Seems so dangerous to stay till another down.

No, so fast I donât realize.
Childhood has gone away
in search for another soul.

I guess this cannot be the end,
even though this seems so strange.
Some times youâll have to make a change.
Thereâs no point remaining a child.
Without control Iâm turning wild.
Itâs just like sleeping
with NIGHTMARE HOWLS.
