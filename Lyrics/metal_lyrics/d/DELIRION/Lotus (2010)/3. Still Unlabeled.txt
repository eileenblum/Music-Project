[Music by Sergio and Ana, lyrics by Chris]

Fly, over your virgin and sinless dreams
discovering passions you have within.
Breath the air of your own world,
tireless, you always will search the unknown.

Painting with my eyes a world full of fantasy,
places that I cannot define.
Picking up the toys
you left in the playground,
heading for a painless time.

STILL UNLABELED
Would you really change the wind
that pushes your sails?
Donât believe in fear.
STILL UNLABELED
just your thoughts will be your compass.
Trust your valiant mind.

Shy, youâre staring fearful at any side,
collecting the feelings even the lies.
Crawling naively till your collide.
Remember that boys never cry.

Scream louder when doctrines reach
to eliminate your smile.
Innocent hands, STILL UNLABELEDâ¦
