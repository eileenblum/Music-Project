[Music by Sergio and Ana, lyrics by Chris]

Did I cherish the tales she told me?
By the side of my bedâ¦
What would I have paid
for one whisper tonight?
I canât stand this dying eyes!

I will take care of you.
Nothing else will make you cry.
Just keep close to me, MOTHER.
Will unmake a day for you,
just to give us some more time, MOTHER.

The last sigh buries all my tears.
Let the feet submerged
when walking to the shore,
you drown the grief.
Iâll follow your footsteps on the sand.

Do I know her the way she knows me?
Does she hide thousand stories?
If am ever asked can I tell what she likes?
I canât stand this morning light!
