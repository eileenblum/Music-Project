[Music by Sergio and Ana, lyrics by Chris and Sergio]

Blackness across my eyesâ¦
Should I be knowing the answers?
I start to move away,
from all I have done.
Could I begin today?

Each one of the masks I used to keep with me
drills my illusion of writing my destiny.
Looking back, love and nails
in my heart inside,
breaking the silence that built this hypocrisy.

STRANGERS IN LIFE swept away by lies.
Always in search of smoke and cries.
Could you hold down the sand for a while?
Tell me Father Time.

Thereâs so much more to sayâ¦
Fed up of hiding from myself,
Iâm not a different guy,
but something has died
under this made up pride.
