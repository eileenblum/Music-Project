[Music by Sergio and Ana, lyrics by Chris]

Every day Iâm hearing -youâve gone astray-.
Every day repeating -youâve made a new mistake-.

Some sharp words could be misunderstood easily.
No guided steps waiting for me.

WALLS AND WAVES beating against,
find the rhythm and try not to shake.
I still donât know what Iâm looking for.
Let me flow or get away.

Now thereâre many to blame.
Now that I have been dismayed.
Now before I become tamed.
Now when I feel that Iâm scratchingâ¦
Now I know the purpose.
Now that I have realized.
Now beside the street noise.
Now when I feel that Iâm scratching the walls.

Every time I wonder, why am I afraid?
Merely I answer: I am not here to fade.

Some sharp words could be misunderstood easily.
No guided steps waiting for me.

WALLS AND WAVES beating against,
find the rhythm and try not to shake.
I still donât know what Iâm looking for.
Let me flow careless.
