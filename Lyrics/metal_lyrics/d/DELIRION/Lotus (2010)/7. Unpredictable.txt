[Music by Sergio and Ana, lyrics by Anna LÃ³pez]

Winter loneliness reminds
that time has stopped,
now that it feels cold.
I miss every day we spent together.
May, thatâs when you say
that you were gonnaâ stay.
But June is in time to take you away.

I still can recall your shivering hands.
The day you were gone I learned:
Your love, it comes and goes
with the wind blow,
UNPREDICTABLE.
Iâm just frozen watching you pass me by,
but you change like the weatherâ¦

Summer laziness and wine,
the air is calm.
Sky comes in bright gold.
Pictures of you clearer than ever.

I still can recall your shivering smile.
The day you were gone I learned:
Your love, it comes and goes
with the wind blow,
UNPREDICTABLE.
Iâm just frozen watching you pass me by,
but you change like the weatherâ¦
