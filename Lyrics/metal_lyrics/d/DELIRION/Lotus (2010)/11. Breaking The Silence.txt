[Music by Chris, lyrics by Anna LÃ³pez]

I canât run from this sorrow.
Fronting this adversityâ¦
Iâm so alone.

All the words I canât pronounce
are filling up my mouth.
None of us could go that far,
but we canât take it from the start.
Itâs up to you and me.

So easy to play, so easy to fake,
Still everythingâs in vain.
Itâs not easy to say, not easy to make
a way across this situation.

Enough Iâm BREAKING THE SILENCE.
I need to set us free.
Enough Iâm BREAKING THE SILENCE.
I need to think for you and me.

With time our previous life
will show in black and white
scenes remaining touchless in our hearts.
But we ainât getting more.
The end is pouring over you and me.

Some day weâll met each other again
in paradise.
By now we know each other so well,
we canât go right.
