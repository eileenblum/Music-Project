[Music by Sergio and Ana, lyrics by Sergio]

Here I am even in the coldness.
Snowflakes caress my naked hands.
On the floor, still forgotten footsteps.
The sun is waiting just behind.

The first ray of light gave me the right
to see from my eyes and know there was
never any doubt theyâre mine.
Unopened doors are waiting for me.

The LOTUS lies all around withered away.
Lost reality unfolds to my mind.
Blank memories show me Iâve been here before.
Shameless fingers are pointing the goal
and I am the one
who choses what I want.

Another lifeâ¦
Is it only in my mind?
I canât remember who I am.
Who really cares?
It should be this way.
My life is like a book to write.

The first ray of light gave me the right
to see from my eyes and know theyâre mineâ¦

Who am I? Who cares?
Everything but me always reminds the same.
Where am I? Who cares?
I donât need to know, my life starts right here.
