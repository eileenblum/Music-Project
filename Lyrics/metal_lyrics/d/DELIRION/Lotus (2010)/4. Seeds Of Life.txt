[Music by Sergio and Ana, lyrics by Chris]

Leaving the chest of the memories,
looking forward to the new beginning
with bright eyes and hope.

All my chances I have packed
well astounded by the fact
Iâm opening up this act.

All my options on the road,
seems that I donât need a code.
I wonder if itâs my fault.

First time you get on the train.
You think you know where you are getting off.
Maybe youâre right, but if you not,
wait for the sign. Donât hurry up.

I donât know what my drawer will keep inside.
Any shoe or trouser full of SEEDS OF LIFE,
growing up like a question in my inner lost.
Iâm wearing out all the answers on my own.
Take a breath and remember the teachings
because they are waiting to be used.
