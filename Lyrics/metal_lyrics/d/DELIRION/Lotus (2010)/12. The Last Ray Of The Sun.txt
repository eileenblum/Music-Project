[Music by Sergio and Ana, lyrics by Chris and Sergio]

Lost on the way to remember
those amazing days,
at the time I wish to smile once again.
Wasting the time with useless hopes,
thatâs enough!

I will face my fears till the end
leaving all doubt behind.
More and more self assured,
I wonât stop.
Please donât leave me alone.

When my time is so close to decadence,
there is only an empty space in my mind.
If you find how to bring me alive again,
you will see my eyes in tears illuminated
with THE LAST RAY OF THE SUN.

Let me hold your hand, come to my cage.
Step inside and merge my pieces.
I will not give up, never ever.
Get out from this waveless lake.
