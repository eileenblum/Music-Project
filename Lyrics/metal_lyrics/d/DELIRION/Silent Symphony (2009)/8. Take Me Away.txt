Shadows follow my path taking my desires away,
hiding all my thoughts of love, life and wrath.
Dusk hell for my relief.
Two minds merged forever always walking to nowhere
with nothing to achieve.

Your heart reminds inviolate, guideless where your hands
enticing to sin, enthralled by you.

Wreathed in mist we were.
You canât leave me here
in fire and brimstone.
Without you Iâm all alone,
all alone in this world
so please, take me away!

Shadows are writhing at the sound of my footsteps.
I've started my way to you and I trust in finding you.

Uncoil your mind to me and show me who you really are.
Possess my heart and my body;
mesmerize me with your eyes.
