Smoking dreams in black and white
surrounds your walls and say you,
-the curtains fall when you really want to.
You wonder how, you wonder why
the signals flew away
unseen before you discovered who you are.

You are the one.
Your fears left trying to fade away
through the blacknessâ gates.
Your smile appears so shy.
A vision guides you in the journey
to the hiding glory.

Delirion! Wait for the day,
when lost horizons rise again
to show you the way.
Delirion! Majestic veils of light
caress your skin to reach
Infinityâs delight.
