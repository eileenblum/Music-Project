In a moment between the midnight
and the beginning of the dawn.
I heard for thousand stars
whispering your name.
Towards world end.
In solitude I stand.
The night's so cold
when you are not by my side.

I miss you, I need you, you are my guide.
Without you the way is over
and thereâs no more else to discover.

I saw your face and for one moment in time,
I thought my dreams come true.
Eternity has just stopped to see you
once more time.
So donât hide the light of your eyes.
