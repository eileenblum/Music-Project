Whatâs mankind becoming day by day?
I donât know the answer,
maybe itâs too late to understand.
Why donât you open your eyes and realize?
Is this really the way, we want to take
or we want to live?

Riding the wings of insanity,
Feeding the beast with our words.
Searching the way to be free again,
we need a sign to survive! 

Sing the silent symphony.
To reborn from this world of madness.
Feel how you fly, leave the ashes behind
And you will be free for a while.
