Emerged from chaos you were born.
The watcher of my life.
Iâm running down the mountains.
I wonder how long it lasts?
Could we all see you die?

Why! Just tell me why.
Why the sands of time
reflect the nightmares of my life,
rising from my eyes.

My eyes are covered with lies.
Blindness must entwine.
Like the fog over the Tyne,
ignorance cracks my mind.

Timeâs passing by.
It takes what before the light was mine,
but now I understand.

Iâve seen my life through a broken mirror.
Iâm not myself,
Iâm a shadow of a broken dream / dying soul.
Beyond the walls of reality
The choirs of glory will sing on and on.

You have return from the depths of yourself
and now you are running to victory.
