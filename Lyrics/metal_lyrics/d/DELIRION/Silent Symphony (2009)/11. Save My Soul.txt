I have spent all my life on you.
Trying to follow the way of truth,
But now you have leave me at the gates of misery
And I disown your spell

Save my soul from the sorrow
Tell me why I canât believe.
Iâm far away from my faith,
I just want to see you again
to carry on.

I have shed blood and tears for you,
holding your banner so high to show them.
You are the one,
you are the sacred king of kings,
you are the bringer of light.

What is my faith for?
My lifeâs just a lie.
Give me another sign.
Keep me free from misery.
Nothing worst can come!
