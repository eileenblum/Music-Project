Lost in the silence you try to return
from the rising fears.
Behind the fog lives the chaos of your mindâ¦
Now thereâs no escape!
Open your eyes and waitâ¦
The end will come.
Look for the answers, donât lay down.

Run to the edge before the strong winds come again,
to the oceans of calm.
Forever you will find the way.
Fight with pride and stand in victory.

Oh! Iâm running out from deep within,
to the oceans of calm.
Forever I will find the way.
I fight with pride and stand in victory.
