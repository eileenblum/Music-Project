Greetings! My nameâs âYour Conscienceâ,
your worldâs upon my shoulders
falling into the chasm.
I suffer your decisions
and each one of your visions
What are you doing this time?

Heading for the good times
without any place to go,
They fly so far from me
and I donât know what to do.

I know thereâs a solution.
Be quiet itâs going so quick,
clean up the tears from your eyes.
You have many things to change
without disturb and tease them,
try to do a great thing tonight.

Iâll return to serenity and calm
to forget all this misery and pain.
Now I must go,
good by my friend donât cry for me.
Now I must go forever more.

I was not talking about this,
you have misunderstood me.
Hold all those shadows behind.
Submit to no idea
but the unchained illusions.
Stay with the winners to win.
