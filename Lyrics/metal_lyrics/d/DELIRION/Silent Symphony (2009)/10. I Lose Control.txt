Forgotten wasps torment your mind
drawing chains around my head.
A sweet madness guides you through the shade
in search for sin and misery.

Thereâs no surrender, so dismal and so tender.
Pain bites my patience from deep within the howling stains.
I canât hear whatever you say,
go away and let me stay.

Causeâ I lose control,
I donât know what to do.
Somethingâs wrong, Iâm crying for you.
At Lord Whyâs domains sun is going down,
Rest your mind and try to forget.

Now Iâm looking through your eyes and I see hopeless filth.
Damned by your own insane blind hate
can you hear angelâs cry?
