You're still the one who wakes my pain
'Though I believe you no more
You've shown me heavens to attain
But gave no smile to die for ...
Now ....breath if you can breath,
Run...use your chance to leave
All the truth I hear in your lies,
All the fears I've tried to excise,
Burnt by Sun that will never rise...
Frail edge between the shades of past...
Wasting my endless dead time,
I know for sure, we'll turn to dust...
The smallest part of last crime...
Sky's never heard your screams
Gusts take away your dreams
All the truth I hear in your lies
All the fears I've tried to excise ,
Burnt by Sun that will never rise...

You're still the one who wakes my pain
Although I need it no more
You've shown me abyss to attain
But gave no worlds to die for ...

All the truth I hear in your lies
All the fears I've tried to excise ,
Burnt by Sun that will never rise...
