Could never hide the steps I do
For to see you once again
Cannot pretend...oh, this is true...
Don't you feel we are the same?

Craving for more and more I won't stop,
Baby, please don't try to seem so heartless now....

All the moments of my dreams, I've razed away,
Never shown a soul, a place for me to stay...
Only diamond stars are shining bright so far
Blessing strangers like we are...

No pain, no guilt, no fatal wounds,
Here I've come to get my prize
The longest one of endless rounds..
Only chance to see your eyes...

Craving for more and more I won't stop
Baby, please don't try to seem so heartless now....

All the moments of my dreams, I've razed away,
Never shown a soul, a place for me to stay...
Only diamond stars are shining bright so far
Blessing strangers like we are...
