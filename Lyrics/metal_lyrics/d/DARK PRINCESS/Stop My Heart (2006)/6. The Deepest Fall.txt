To see your pain is such a pleasure
Eyes are full of tears uncried
My fall for you is hard to measure
Trust me fool I never lied
Let me reach out to you
I want my loving back
Going down
Follow me
I'll never leave you
Will you leave me.
Going down
Follow me
I'll never leave you
Will you leave me.

I'll be your slave for time eternal
Crawl for you on broken glass
You are my beast it's such a turn-on
You may die of my caress.
Let me reach out to you
I want my loving back
Going down
Follow me
I'll never leave you
Will you leave me.
Going down
Follow me
I'll never leave you
Will you leave me.
