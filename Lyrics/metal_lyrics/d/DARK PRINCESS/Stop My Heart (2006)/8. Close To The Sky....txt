...Gloom's walking down
From the misty hills...
From the place I'm gonna stay
Nevermore...
Eternity...
Broken line between
All the empty hopes I've lost
From before...
So close to the sky-
The spirits of my sorrow
So deep in my mind-
The words "because I love her"
But truth in your eyes
Just made of tears and passion...
...Still unbelievable...
What can I give
With my icy heart?
Only bitter taste of sin
Taste of fear...
Come, take my hand...
Take away my breath,
Wake the moments we could be
Far from here
So close to the sky
The spirits of my sorrow
So deep in my mind
The words "because I love her"
But truth in your eyes
Just made of tears and passion
...Still unbelievable...
The pain I feel
Never let me go...
Never let me think the dream
Was not real...
So close to the sky
The spirits of my sorrow
So deep in my mind
The words "because I love her"
But truth in your eyes
Just made of tears and passion
...Still unbelievable...
