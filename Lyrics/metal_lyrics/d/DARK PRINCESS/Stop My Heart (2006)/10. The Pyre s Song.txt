Fall down like bird with no wings...
Pull for last time black rain's strings...
Go...and I follow you soon
In misty shades of this moon
Call...stamp your voice in my mind
Deep inside...
Death, waking us by cold breath,
Confessed - it's moment to leave
Wind takes away all my tears
Light would not help as it sears...
Sleep...slip away down below...
Sure, I know....
I'd break my chains if I still could fly
Without your touch
Without your smile
No more wish to expire
For this dead lonely pyre
Still I'm burning my fire
All the worlds are not enough
As I never see your eyes...
....don't you hear anymore?
No matter when I meet you
No chance-why does it seem true -
Forever you're staying here,
(you're staying here)
And I see you so clear,
Live in my soul, in my heart,
Endless smart...
I'd break my chains if I still could fly so high
Without your touch
Without your smile
No more wish to expire
For this dead lonely pyre
Still I'm burning my fire...
All the worlds are not enough
As I never see your eyes
Anytime...anywhere in my life...
