Here I stay, facing price of my choice
Cursed to hear nothing but your sweet voice...
This crimson sky...it won't stop bleeding while I'm burning
On my last way to go.
Save me, drain me!
And I'll hide my sorrow between
Guilt and envy!
Growing like a pain from within
Staying nameless!
Tearing all the fears apart
Please betray me
With all your heart!
Still I've got all your brightness to pine...
Fallen stars...yet I know they were mine...
The night is endless as it's filling my own soul,
Soul I'm breaking for you....
Save me, drain me!
And I'll hide my sorrow between
Guilt and envy!
Growing like a pain from within
Staying nameless!
Tearing all the fears apart
Please betray me
With all your heart!
