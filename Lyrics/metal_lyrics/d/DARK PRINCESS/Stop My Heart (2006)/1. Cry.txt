Gleaming visions of death
Razor's touching my face
Trails of hate and desire
Liquid fire in my veins!
I'm just trying to escape this
World made of glass
?os my fragile wings are broken
Cry and please let me mourn
My blind emotions!
Bye! Pain tears me apart
From my devotions
Here it's nothing but song
Just a song to forget
Look, I'm breaking my life
With no guilt and regret
And I'm not an angel of light, I
Just tried to shine
But my fragile wings are broken
Cry and please let me mourn
My blind emotions!
There's no time to run
The bullet's flight begun
Bye! Pain tears me apart
From my devotions
She will never see
The brightest light could be
I want you to live
I'd like you to stay
No one's to blame, nobody must pay
Here water turns red
But still remains warm
So let me bleed, I'm just going home
Cry...and please let me mourn
My blind emotions!
There's no time to run
The bullet's flight begun
Bye! Pain tears me apart
From my devotions
She will never see
The brightest light could be
