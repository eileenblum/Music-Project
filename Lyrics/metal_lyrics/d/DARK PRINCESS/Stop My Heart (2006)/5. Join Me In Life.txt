Despite it seems so frail
Love's still by my side
Despite our misery
There's way out to find
No matter now who's right
Just come, cross the line
'cause all the tears you've cried,
Were also mine

My shame, my fear...all is mixed here
Isn't it so clear -
For you and me there's nothing to pretend...
Dead stars are falling, all the bridges are burning...
But look - I'm tied up with you in the end!
Despite it seems so frail
Love's still by my side
Despite our misery
There's way out to find
No matter now who's right
Just cross the line
You'll see these tears you've cried
Were also mine

Again, again...yet I nurse my pain,
Cup we'll never drain
To dregs...But it's a shortest track I know
To break the wall, to reach the shore we've year ned for
...To save a chance we've lost some lies ago
Despite it seems so frail
Love's still by my side
Despite our misery
There's way out to find
No matter now who's right
Just cross the line
You'll see these tears you've cried
Were also mine

So join me in life
As I want you to breath
The same air of dream...
Should we try to forgive?
Games end up in tears
But for some never end...
As I'm gonna live -
For sure we will see
All that we could be
Despite it seems so frail
Love's still by my side
Despite our misery
There's way out to find
No matter now who's right
Just cross the line
You'll see these tears you've cried
Were also mine
