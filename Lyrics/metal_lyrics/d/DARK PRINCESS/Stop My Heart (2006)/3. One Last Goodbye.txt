For me and you...
Dreams won't come true...
I'd never hurt you so
Oh, my sweetheart!
But all the rivers flow
And we know here the story ends!
Tears from the sky
One last goodbye...
No more lies to be said,
Autumn's crying...
No treasures to regret
'cause I'm leaving your world behind...
Waiting for another day
Still I'm craving for relief
Burning all the trails away
Drowning deep into my grief
Never felt so cold before...
Never had a chance to live...
As our fire is no more.....
Turn the page leave me all alone...
Raze the sham as our dream has gone...
All your gifts are too much for me...
(your breath makes me feel alive...)
Look I'm falling...let it be...
Waiting for another day
Still I'm craving for relief
Burning all the trails away
Drowning deep into my grief
Never felt so cold before...
Never had a chance to live...
As our fire is no more.....
