I believe in nothing
Nothing but your smile and this madness
Seems not possible to tame
In these dark embraces
Of the night we're waiting for so long
Here we shine so close to flame
Stop my heart again, I need this
Sweetness of your deadly kisses
When I feel my blood boiling in your veins
Promise just to kill me tender,
It's so easy to surrender,
Dying every night, 'till the moonlight reigns
Oh, I know you leave me
For these shadows, longing to join them
In a cold deceptive dream
You won't see me crying
I won't see you, fading away
When the Sun comes down my realm
Stop my heart again, I need this
Sweetness of your deadly kisses
When I feel my blood boiling in your veins
Promise just to kill me tender,
It's so easy to surrender,
Dying every night, 'till the moonlight reigns
Keep this fire forever burning
Keep your thirst forever growing
Change like snake your flesh and soul,
Share the hunt too, make me hollow...
Stop my heart again, I need this
Sweetness of your deadly kisses
When I feel my blood, boiling in your veins
Promise just to kill me tender,
It's so easy to surrender,
Dying every night, 'till the moonlight reigns
