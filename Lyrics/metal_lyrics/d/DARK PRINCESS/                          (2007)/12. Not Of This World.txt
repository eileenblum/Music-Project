I give upâ¦donât wanna win
This useless warâ¦
Iâm not gonna walk on broken glass
Anymoreâ¦
From the bottom of my heart
I let you go
Staying free forever,
Iâm out of rangeâ¦
Donât you feel the change?
Itâs all overâ¦

Not of this world, I roam alone
And see no one who could take me home.
Though all my wounds are open wide,
Thereâs no more chilling fear by my side!
Some die for love - you live for pain
And turn to dust again and againâ¦
But all I need - a chance to run
Away from here to see the Sunâ¦

Falling down from grace, donât care -
It wonât hurt!
All the sinners play this
Dangerous gameâ¦
Donât you feel the same?
Gameâs not overâ¦

Not of this world, I roam alone
And see no one who could take me home.
Though all my wounds are open wide,
Thereâs no more chilling fear by my side!
Some die for love - you live for pain
And turn to dust again and againâ¦
But all I need - a chance to run
Away from here to see the Sunâ¦

In darkest dreams, so frail and hollow,
You found no cure to heal my sorrowâ¦
Iâm just a butterfly in fire
Tonight,
Mesmerized by your lightâ¦
