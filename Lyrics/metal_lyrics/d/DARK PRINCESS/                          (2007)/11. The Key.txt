Where the northern winds are blowing, drying my tears,
Freezing oceans tell their stories no one hearsâ¦
Where youâll see no human trails on the snow,
Yet Iâm looking for the key to what weâve lostâ¦
The world Iâve lostâ¦

Where the storm wonât break the silence, stifling my cry,
On the endless way to heaven truth means lieâ¦
Every single step weâve made to run,
It burns you downâ¦
It burns meâ¦

Skyâ¦is waiting for the end of timesâ¦
Iâ¦need nothing but to see your eyes!

Skyâ¦will never let us be apartâ¦
Iâ¦know all the keys are in my heart,
My love!
