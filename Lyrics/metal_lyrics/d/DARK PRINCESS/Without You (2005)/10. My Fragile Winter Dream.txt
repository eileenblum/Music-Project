You see, I'm dying
For this crystal temple of dreams
Melting my crying
In black waters of frozen streams.
I've to be stronger
But I feel your fingers are cold.
These shadows are like you.
I can't see your world.

Winter will bury with the snow my pain
You've never shared my sorrow, you'll never
share it again.
Dark is so deep and there's no sun to shine.
But in this fragile dream you're mineâ¦

Mirrors are broken,
Stars are dead, they can't give us light.
Fear of darknessâ¦
I wish you could trust my insight.
I've to be stronger
But I feel your fingers are cold.
These shadows are like you.
I can't see your world.

Winter will bury with the snow my pain.
You've never shared my sorrow, you'll never
share it again.
Dark is so deep and there's no sun to shine.
But in this fragile dream you're mineâ¦

Burned by your love and hate I pray:
"Please, let me out! Let me...stay!"

Winter will bury with the snow my pain.
You've never shared my sorrow, you'll never
share it again.
Dark is so deep and there's no sun to shine.
But in this fragile dream you're mineâ¦
