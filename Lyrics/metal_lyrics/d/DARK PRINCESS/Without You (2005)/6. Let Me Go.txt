Fake it, morning's sweeping before the sun.
Faithful, now you're talking like everyone.
Close your eyes make believe to be always young
and proud.
It's sufficed to release all lovefools so young
and proud.
Cause it is, how I feel.

Fade away you belong to tragic fits of my insanity.
Close your eyes and let me go.
And I say, I have never been a part of your reality.
But I know you'll never mind.

Lonely, on you go to destroy my dreams.
Sorrow runs the show is not what it feels.
Close your eyes make believe to be always young
and proud.
It's sufficed to release all lovefools so young
and proud.
Cause it is, how I feel.

Fade away you belong to tragic fits of my insanity.
Close your eyes and let me go.
And I say, I have never been a part of your reality.
But I know you'll never mind.

Without you I can't breathe!
Without you I can't feel...

Fade away you belong to tragic fits of my insanity.
Close your eyes and let me go.
And I say, I have never been a part of your reality.
But I know you'll never mind.
