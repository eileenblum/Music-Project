Saline hours
Make me feel dishonest
Leaving the world.
I'm leaving alone.
Future's empty.
It's killing the moments,
Driving the world,
Well, baby, so long.

Passion minutes overruled.
Melting seasons ever doomed.

Never felt mornings.
Never had silence cry.
Never caught tears.
Never had fears allied.
Unbreak visions of hopeless
Voices of godness and
The stars will fall down where
The last men stand.

Little hours
Make sleep up to ending,
Saying goodnight.
I'm feeling all right.
Silent sounds
Search for the landing
Are ready to fight,
Soul screaming tonight.

Passion minutes overruled.
Melting seasons ever doomed.

Never felt mornings.
Never had silence cry.
Never caught tears.
Never had fears allied.
Unbreak visions of hopeless
Voices of godness and
The stars will fall down where
The last men stand.

Never felt mornings.
Never had silence cry.
Never caught tears.
Never had fears allied.
Unbreak visions of hopeless
Voices of godness and
The stars will fall down where
The last men stand.
