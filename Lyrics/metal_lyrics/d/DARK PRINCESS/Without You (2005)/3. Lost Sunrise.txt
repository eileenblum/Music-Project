I can hardly wait.
I believe I'll see your eyes.
The plastic face behind
Takes me on the other side.
It makes me feel the love no more.

Feel you,
There's no time for sorrow
Shadows move around
I need to see your eyes.
Feel you,
There's no need to follow
Take me out of time
I need to see your eyes.

I can hardly wait
I believe I'll see your smile
Wearing dirty wings
You can take me to the sunrise..
It makes me feel the love no more.

Feel you,
There's no time for sorrow
Shadows move around
I need to see your eyes.
Feel you,
There's no need to follow
Take me out of time
I need to see your eyes.

Feel you,
There's no time for sorrow
Shadows move around
I need to see your eyes.
Feel you,
There's no need to follow
Take me out of time
I need to see your eyes.
