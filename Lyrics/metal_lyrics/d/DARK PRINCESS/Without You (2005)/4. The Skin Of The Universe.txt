My reflection
Broken mirrors
No connection to myself.
Deadly sunshine
Hope of being
Out of mind you call a shell.

There're no feelings
Just emotions
Days are empty about to fall.
Lonely towers of long mistakes back
Back in times
I can call.

Staring
At the skin of the universe
You don't belong.
Praying
You can blame yourself for mysteries
And fall along.

My reflection
Broken mirrors
No connection to myself.
Deadly sunshine
Hope of blistered smiling
At the mind you call a shell..

Staring
At the skin of the universe
You don't belong.
Praying
You can blame yourself for mysteries
And fall along.

Staring
At the skin of the universe
You don't belong.
Praying
You can blame yourself for mysteries
And fall along.
