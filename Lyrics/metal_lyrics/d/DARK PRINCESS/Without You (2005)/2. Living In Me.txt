I believe in devotion.
You could kill my emotion
Never again.
I could live for the silence
Breaking up frozen violence
The light of my life
Living in me.
The light of my life
Just living in me.

Lost in my eyes spirits above me.
Lost in the cries always in need.
All of my lies murder the lonely
Frozen tears.

We could walk to the sunrise
With no distant to love
The light of my life
Living in me.
The light of my life
Just living in me.

Lost in my eyes spirits above me.
Lost in the cries always in need.
All of my lies murder the lonely
Frozen tears.

The rain of loving tears inside.
It's killing all the dreams.
The darkest night's deep in mind.
It's always out of time.

Lost in my eyes spirits above me.
Lost in the cries always in need.
All of my lies murder the lonely
Frozen tears.

Lost in my eyes spirits above me.
Lost in the cries always in need.
All of my lies murder the lonely
Frozen tears.
