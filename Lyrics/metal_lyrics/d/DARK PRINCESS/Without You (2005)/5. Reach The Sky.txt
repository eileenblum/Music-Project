Why are they waiting for me?
I'd like to know how we can reach the sky.
Wind kisses my furied soul.
They don't appall my immaculate world.

Why are they calling for me
On my big way to the deafening sky?
Sleep will not come to this world.
It's all alone I shall follow them all.

Sweetness is coming inside out.
Vengeance these days is not allowed.

We have lost all desires.
We fly any way.
We will sure reach the sky
Lighting my way.

Sleep will not come to this world.
It's all alone I shall follow them all.

Sweetness is coming inside out.
Vengeance these days is not allowed.

Sweetness is coming inside out.
Vengeance these days is not allowed.
