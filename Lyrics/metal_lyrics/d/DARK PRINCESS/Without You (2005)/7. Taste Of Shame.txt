I fill nothing but fire that in your eyes.
When you look up in sorrow of gentle crimes.
Give me one more day of despair
I get the night of cry.
You can swallow my grief.
There's no time to believe.

Leave all your tears behind
You know what you have to know
Let me shape up your mind like I did it before.
Deliver me from hate
Love still reasoning your life
And the hardest thing to understand is your lie.

Your embrace all your memories of my life.
Taste of shame on your lips and it's full of light.
Give me one more day of despair
I get the night of cry
But I'm craving for more
Yes I'm fooling myself

Leave all your tears behind
You know what you have to know
Let me shape up your mind like I did it before.
Deliver me from hate
Love still reasoning your life
And the hardest thing to understand is your lie.

Leave all your tears behind
You know what you have to know
Let me shape up your mind like I did it before.
Deliver me from hate
Love still reasoning your life
And the hardest thing to understand is your lie.
