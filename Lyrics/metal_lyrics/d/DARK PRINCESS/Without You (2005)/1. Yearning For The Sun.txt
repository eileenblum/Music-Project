I dream again.
Nothing but black rain.
It's so cold.

It's clouding my way.
Death stands by me
In eternity.
Skies are crying.
I'm fading away.

Should I join this cry?
Now I can't deny -
We could fly.
But who was to blame?
Just another day,
Just another night
Of despair
Without your smile
I need your flame.

I dream again.
Nothing but black rain.
And it's cold.
It's clouding my way.
You were my Sun
And you're still the one.
I can trust.
But this is the end.

You can take me higher.
But it saves me no more.
Don't you feel this bittersweet
Taste of my tears?
I'm just trying to live.
But I know it kills me.
Cause my soul is burnt to ashes
By your fire.

You can take me higher.
But it saves me no more.
Don't you feel this bittersweet
Taste of my tears?
I'm just trying to live.
But I know it kills me.
Cause my soul is burnt to ashes
By your fire.
