Stranger from my perfect realm,
Could you ever be my wicked dream?

All the fears I ever find,
Now are but the chains we cast aside,

Getting closer to the end of time

[Chorus:]
Try to catch some falling tears,
Just to heal my bleeding scarsm
For the bitter joy to win the fight again,
With no reason to give yp,
With no energy to stop,
Yet we're craving for this
Everlasting pain

Who are you to make me cry?
Who am I to know we'll reach the sky?

Burnt to ashes in this war
Ain't we gonna break the rules no more,

Getting closer to the end of time?

[Chorus]

Try to catch some falling stars...
(To heal my scars)
With no reason to give yp...
Yet we're craving for this everlasting pain
