The temple of darkness
So much pain and it's so strong.
No more desire
To live and to breathe
It is all gone.

So, ashes to ashes...
I feel the chains of emptiness
There is nothing ahead

[Chorus:]
You will come as
The savior of souls,
To specify the way and never let go,
You will say:
"Let's pretend we are dead
There's nothing to fear, but now
We must live, you know, we must live"

I should open the secret
The temple of darkness in my soul
How can I keep it,
When you give so much light and hope?

So, ashes to ashes...
Now I can break the chains of pain,
Follow me till the end

[Chorus]

My temple of darkness....
Now I can break the chains of pain...
