I know that my life
Would not be complete
When the borders of time
Are ready to relieve

I can hear them call
The grass painted grey.
They need us to run,
But sometimes it's too late,,,

To roam this way again

[Chorus:]
Trying to pretend
All the time we spend
Never been so close to the past.
Symbols of the end
Make us understand:
Time is out, we've gone too far.
Trying too pretend...

We're stuck in the days,
Searching for life,
Alone in the space,
No one to say good-bye

I can hear them call
The moon wraps me up.
When stars are to fall,
When our time's to stop...

And no way to go

[Chorus]

Fields are faces
(I can read your mind,
I can recognize
Lies)
Words come back - the echo of the end

In these places
(You'll be left behind
Weight for your turn to climb high),
Where we hid from time dancing with the
Stars

[Chorus]
