Could never dream of pleasure
So deeply teasing my heart....
You seemed my only treasure,
When passion tore us apart.

Building our castle on quicksand,
Melting like wax in your hands,
Changing my guise like snakeskin,
I wish you'd know what I mea.

[Chorus:]
Try to pretend
That we gonna live forever,
Never ask me
Why don't we try to escape from
What we fear
Just say the words I used to hear...

From some the way of passion
Is the only way to survive
You're still my dark obsession
So fragile but still alive

And every time you're crying,
Your tears are more than lying.
No one's to blame for that sin.
For sure you'd guess what I mean.

[Chorus]
