I Can be the one,
Who won't let you down
Tired of useless war,
Should we pray for more?

Drawn into the sky,
Never asking "why",
Come and touch my flame,
Wanna play this game?

And I have no reason
To escape a new chance to burn.
Pain's so sweetly teasing...
Trust me, this is the point of no return

[Chorus:]
Let me go to see the light,
Don't be scared to break my heart,
As it shall be broken anyway tonight.
Love is a beast we'll never tame,
Simplest way to go insane,
But I know for sure it makes me breathe,
It makes me alive.

Wounds are open wide.
Passion's locked inside,
Try to understand
This is not the end.

Waking from your dreams,
Take it like it is,
All the signs we've got
Never mean the same...

'Cause we have no reason
To escape a new chance to burn.
Pain's so sweetly teasing...
Take my hand, it's the point of no return.

[Chorus]

'Cause we have no reason
To escape a new chance to burn.
Pain's so sweetly teasing...
Take my hand, it's the point of no return.
