Night... I'm waking from a terrible sleep.
Light... and now I see clearly - it's real.

You are leaving my home
And burning my world.
Take away my dead soul
There's no sense to hope
I know it's the moment
To declare war

Mortal fight inside
Blood will spill every night
You've betrayed my dreams!
Pain is all that I can feel

[Chorus:]
Fight with myself...
And nobody wins
Fight with myself
Please, heaven help me!
Fight till the death,
Till I shall forget that you live,
And, at last,
Till my heart shall forgive

So, the morning comes
The game has just begun
I will kill my love hatred
Help me win this war
(This War)

[Chorus]
