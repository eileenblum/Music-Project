There where plains are filled
With the shining sun,
Where the fast blue rivers run,
Where the grass is green,
The air is sweet and clear,
Only in this land we're near.

[Chorus:]
Let's try to pretend:
We are northern winds,
Our life is the foam of the endless
Timeless sea.
Take care of my soul immortal and high
I'm breaking my heart
And aspiring to the sky...
Into the skies.

I used to tell you about this sacred land,
Where love reigns and music plays,
In my fairy-tale, you're the king and
I'm your queen.
Let this fairy-tale be real

[Chorus]
