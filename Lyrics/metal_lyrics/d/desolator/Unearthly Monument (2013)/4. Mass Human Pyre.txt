Endless purgatory
Crimson wave of death
A stench of burning flesh

Nuclear deformity
Radiation, suffering
Fallout of eternal war

Die, revel in pain
Shiver with fear

Mankind laid to rest on a funeral pyre
Graveyard of mutation
Asphyxiating air
Desolate landscapes
Chemical devastation

Carnage is unbound
Human race enslaved
Abhorrent burning wasteland
Abysmal of remnants of war

What remains are twisted
Shatters of a life
Like lepers molded in fire
Scavenging this

Mass human pyre
Genocide by fire
Mass human pyre
Genocide by fire

Mass human pyre
