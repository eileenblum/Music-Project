Ancient god of evil
Lifeless dead and dreaming
Slumber in the abyss
Sunken city of R'lyeh
Lost in the deep
Eternal aeons of sleep

Servant, hear my call
Servant, release me

Resurrect the old ones
Spread insanity
Worship the beyond ones
Evil blasphemy

Y'ai'ng'ngah
Yog-Sothoth
H'ee-l'geb
F'ai trhodog!

Tread under the stars
On mortal soil once more
Spill the blood of chaos
Upon the altar of Yog-Sothoth

Come forth from the anti-cosmos
End of all creation
Harbringer of burning times
Age of annihilation

When the start alight
From the darkest deep
The ancient ones arise
Preserved by the spells
Glorious resurrection
The gate is open
