Carving a path of death and destruction 
An onslaught thatâs second to none
Leaving a trail of grey devastation
The end of the world has begun

Conquering our legacy, stand the test of time
Disciples of the ancient art, breeding death and slime
Bloody gore and slaughter, a sonic invocation
The purest form of total death, monuments of desolation

Hail the destroyer, the slayer of light
Cover before the relentless attack
We kill the old way, we show no remorse
A statement of power, that we are fucking back

Clouds of human ashes
Destruction of cold flesh
The silent hand of darkness
The triumph of death
