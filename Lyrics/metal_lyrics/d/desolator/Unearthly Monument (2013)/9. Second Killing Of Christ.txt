Return of Christ
The lord of filthy lies
He speaks of god, of hell
You know his lies so well

Emerge, come forth
The horde with flaming swords
Sworn to cleanse this world
Behold the Christians scorned

A vow to kill Christ upon his return
Crucify the bastard, let his flesh burn
A vow to kill Christ upon his return
Let him burn

A crown of thorns, of horns
He stands forsaken
Melt away his flesh
Pour the lead down his throat

Nail him to the cross
He's heaven's loss now
We at least stand free
From heaven's blasphemy

Second killing, second killing
Second killing of Christ

A vow to kill Christ upon his return
Crucify the bastard, let his flesh burn
A vow to kill Christ upon his return
Burn
