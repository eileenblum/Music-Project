Malevolent creatures
Drawn by the scent of blood
Hordes of disease and plague
Regurgitate human remains

Tied and bound
For rodents to feast
Eaten and devoured
Sickening beyond belief

Drifting in and out for days
No answer for your prayers
Drifting in and out for days
Until all life fades

Feeding frenzy
Victim of the carnivores
Feeding frenzy
Devoured by the hungry hordes

Feeding frenzy
Feeding frenzy

Torn apart and wretched to nothingness
Decrepified mutation of putrid flesh and bones
A trail of corpulent vermin
The last remains of the massacre
