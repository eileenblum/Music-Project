Carve and hear you scream
Explore your anatomy
Flesh, blood and steel
My morbid fantasy

Internal organs
Left to decay
Your ribs spread open
Bleeding away

Crude amputations
Done viciously
Draining the limbs of
Their last lividity

Antimortem autopsy
Antimortem autopsy

Surgical invasion
Until the last animation
The desecration
Brought to new heights

Death welcomes you

The final morbid rite
The pleasure of carving your insides
From death there's no release
Beyond death exists no peace!
