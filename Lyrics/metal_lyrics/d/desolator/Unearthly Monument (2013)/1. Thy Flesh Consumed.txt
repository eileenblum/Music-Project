Rising from the grave
Crawling through the dirt
Legions of the dead
Hunt across the earth

Trapped by cold and lifeless hands
A feast for the walking dead
Your entrails spread on bloodstained ground
They feed on your severed head

Earth transformed to hells domain
The dead will rise and kill again
Reanimating dead remains
Terror from beyond the grave

Thy flesh consumed
Into the void
Thy bones scraped clean
Thy soul destroyed

The dead replace the living
Forsaken by their god
An endless wave of killing
A world with no more life

Thy flesh consumed
Thy flesh consumed
Thy flesh, thy flesh consumed
