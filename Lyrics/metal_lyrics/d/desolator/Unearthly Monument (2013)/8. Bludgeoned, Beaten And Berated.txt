Saw you die in blood red dreams
Flayed by my piercing sight
Heard your agonizing screams
Wallowing in murderous delight

Wake up full of hate
Now death becomes reality
I will hunt you down
Make you suffer horribly
You will die
Bludgeoned, beaten and berated

Blood and slaughter, endless torture
Victim to my blood lust
Lacerate you, desecrate you
Mutilate you

I have no mercy left
Set fire to your flesh
Gasp for final breath
Burn you until your death
