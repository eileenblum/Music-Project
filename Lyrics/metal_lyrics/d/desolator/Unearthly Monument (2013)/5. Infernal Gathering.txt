We call upon you, our brothers
To bear witness
As we gather under the sign of horns
Before the mighty and ineffable prince of darkness
And in the presence of all the demons of the pit

Invoking his blasphemous names
The lord of Sodom, the god of Cain

Dreadful minions come forth
Swear allegiance
Bow down before the throne of hell

Make the final sacrifice
A brutal mutilation
Spill the blood and hail
The beast of revelation

Make the final sacrifice
Unholy desecration
Spill the blood and hail
The angel of destruction

My body is a temple of the pit
Wherein demons dwell
A host of spirits
A pantheon of flesh

Hear our offering
As we praise
The infernal father of the dark flame
Grant us power
