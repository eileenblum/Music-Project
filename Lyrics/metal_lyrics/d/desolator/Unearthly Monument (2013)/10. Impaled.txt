Lifeless, deathless
Victim of eternal horrors
Endless pain
Tortured, impaled, abhorrently crucified
He felt no guilt
Death to Jesus and his minions
Death

Blood upon the ornaments, spatters of flesh
Priest impaled upon the symbol of his Jesus divine

Psychopath going after the clergy
Feel the wrath of the crucifier
Possessed by the fires of hell
Feel the wrath of Lucifer

Viciously impaled
Viciously impaled
Viciously impaled
Impaled

Into the furnace fire
An eternal life expired
Death unfolds
Joined with Jesus in rotten soil
Occult final act
Abhorrent shrieks of blasphemy
Blasphemy
