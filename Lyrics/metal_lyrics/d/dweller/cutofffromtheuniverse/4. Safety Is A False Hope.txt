I have arisen once again
From my tomb I shall ascend
I shall reclaim these lands and destroy them
And if you think faith can deter me you'll soon realize that I am the reason you live fearfully
What was once land is no more
Flee from me, I am the one standing high above you, In your casket your home is far from safe from me
Flee from me I am the one amongst those left, in infnity cast by the vanities hand
Your home is far from safe from me
Hell never seemed like such a nice place to be, until you've met your advisary
Hell never seemed like such a nice place to be, until you've met your advisary thats me
I thought you would know, so back to your casket, you failed your existance, your purpose is still unknown
I know everything about you, your home is far from safe, far from safe from me
Whats life like when you learn that you have due dates
With a knife tied behind their backs society will learn the hourglass is ticking each time it gets turned over
Turned over, I know everything about you now
Your home is far from safe
Nothing is safe from me.
