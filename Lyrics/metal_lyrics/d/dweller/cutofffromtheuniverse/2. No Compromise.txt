You are the servant of the monumental leader
When the upper class finishes last society turns followers
The world as you knew it is over
In dire situations this species this specimen is forced to conform
To the way of the human bottom feeder
Make way for a new day presents itself the new world order
Make way for your majesty
In dire situations this species this specimen is forced to conform to the way of the human bottom feeds
To the bottom of the food chain, human kind, is forced, to live by their ways
State of mind is now altered, destroyed along with the ego
You are the servant of their leader
Your allegiance lies with the beast
At the bottom of the food chain human kind is forced to live by their ways
Make way for a new day presents itself the new world order
Bow before your master human kind is now obsolete.
