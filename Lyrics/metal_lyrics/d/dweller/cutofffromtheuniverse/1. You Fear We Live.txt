Feed off the thoughts the fear and terror onslaughts
Constantly plaguing consistently on the hunt for more
A thirst that is never quenched, a hunger unsatisfied
There is always room for more, this appetite will drive
Nightfall will arrive, in your dreams we shall thrive, courage is surly deprived fear kicks in overdrive
Nightfall will arrive, in your dreams we shall thrive, courage is surly deprived, we're alive we're alive
Fear us, fear us, we will keep feeding.
We feed off the fear and the terror the fruits of our labor, we feed off the fear and the terror
The fruits of our labor.
You feel a leeching of your life, we manifest in your nightmares, recycling and replenishing us
Your shadow becomes your greatest fear, we manifest in your nightmares, your shadow becomes your greatest fear.
Fear is what keeps us alive, our supply could never run dry
This legacy is carried on fear will always plague the thoughts of mankind.
Fear is what keeps us alive, fear its what keeps us all alive.
Fear us for we live, Fear us for we live, Fear, for we live off you.
