WHOA
For what minimal we have, we have taken it for granted
WHOA
For what minimal we have, we have taken it for granted
For what minimal we possess, we have only lost interest
WHOA
For what minimal we possess we only lost interest
We have never fucking cherished nonetheless
For what minimal we possess we only lost interest

I couldnt fucking care any fucking less about what I have at stake or what you have to say, do you think its important to me?
I could stand back and dine and watch the world die
Listening to the earths cries, how unsatisfying once ones perspective dies, once ones perspective dies, once ones perspectives loss.
We are the hollow vessels we are whats empty inside, we are the ones who thrive to see the world die.
We are the hollow vessels we are whats empty inside so think twice before your fuck with one whos perspective has died

We are the ones who thrive
From whom did we derive
And yet we thrive to see the worlds collide

Why cant you see that I don't give a fuck about your fucking rights
These emotionless eyes gaze upon a failure to life, in time it will fall
For what minimal we have, we have taken it for granted
WHOA
For what minimal we have, we have taken it for granted
For what minimal we possess we have only lost interest
WHOA
For what minimal we possess we only lost interest
We have never fucking cherished nonetheless for what minimal we possess we only lost interest
Could never be cherished could never be cherished.
