Wishing for peace wishing for your release Watch history as it repeats
On and on our forefathers failed to teach us the truths of these fairy tales
On and on and, on and on again
Wishing for peace wishing for your release watch history as it repeats
Break the chain peel your eyes, set astray find a way outside of this maze
Once we've realized we're lost we confide inside to find a way to the truth again
Break the chain peel your eyes, set astray find a way outside of this maze, a way outside of this hell
We must find the strength, we must gain the courage
To end what binds us, to stop these pointless wars
And once more we will rise to the chance that was overlooked, the curse of our heritage, shall be lifted away
Once more we will rise, to the chance that was overlooked
The course of our heritage shall be changed for good or for dead.
