Come one come all
Enter this parallel state of being
Let us begin
Entertaining minds for a second cycle, psycho
Idol eyes hypnotize upon the entity
For this crowd i now control will not remain untamed
Idolized the king i am they will claim.
Test subject number 23
I am performing surgery
I would be lying if i said this wouldn't hurt
Tormented psychologically
Any existing morale is extinguished instantly.
Sever, the spine, the vertebrae
Sever, the spinal cord from the fucking brain
Sever, the spinal cord from the brain
Sever, spinal cord, from the fucking brain
Sever the spinal cord from the entity that resumes in front of me
Sever
Come one come all
Enter this parallel state of being
Let us begin entertaining minds for a second cycle, psycho
Please lead us to a land we can be free
You are welcome here
When no one else accept you
You're welcome here.
