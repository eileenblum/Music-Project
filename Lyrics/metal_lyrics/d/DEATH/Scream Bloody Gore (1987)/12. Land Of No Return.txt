[BONUS TRACK]

Mangled bodies falling from the sky
Grotesque mutation ripping out your eyes
Now a corpses slave you'll learn to rot
A life of endless gore is what you've got

[CHORUS]
Rotting till the end of time
In the land of no return
Here your screams remain unheard
Watch your flesh decay and burn

In this land there is no night or day
In pools of blood, the corpses sit and prey
Unholy carcas begging for relief
Existing everyday in morbid grief

Searching for your soul
Nowhere to be found
Wanting to return
Six feet under ground

[CHORUS]
Rotting till the end of time
In the land of no return
Here your screams remain unheard
Watch your flesh decay and burn

Chuck Schuldiner: vocals, guitars, bass
Chris Reifert: drums
