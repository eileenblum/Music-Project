In the dark of night...
Abusing a portion of light
While others are sleeping
And some are escaping
A serpent spews out fantasy-
Unjustified blasphemy
That cannot be condoned

[Solo: Schuldiner]

It must be strange to not have lived
So far into existence

This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won
Let justice be done

[Chorus:]
There will be zero tolerance
For the creator of hallowed intentions
There will be zero tolerance
Fate is your deciding God

[Solo: Schuldiner / Solo: Koelble]

Karma comes crashing down
Leaving a very deep scar
Exposing a door to the
Source of a verbal whore
Machines supply the altar
Where virtuous lives are sacrificed

[Solo: Koelble]

It must be strange to not have lived
So far into existence

This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won
Let justice be done
