To the world around he was the perfect person
Planning for an alibi he then starts rehearsing
A human bomb just waiting to explode
This secret rage can't be controlled

Slaughtered the dreams of others
One left to recover
Self-inflicted wounds
Life he has consumed

Planning a killing spree
Victim of a conspiracy?

Getting bored with his current life
Rearranging with a knife

[Solos: Murphy, Shuldiner]

Greed before despair suspicion starts to grow
His life was spared for this he does not know
Screams filled the air there was no way to help
The ones he mourns he killed himself

Slaughtered the dreams of others
One left to recover
Self-inflicted wounds
Life he has consumed

Planning a killing spree
Victim of a conspiracy?
