One mind divided into three, for every problem a personality
Each one trying to protect, for the crisis a person they'll select
With sorrow comes reassurance, with confusion there's ignorance

Deny who they are, a fantasy gone too far

Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive Personalities

[Solos: Shuldiner, Murphy]

Passed down from generations, years of pain and complications
Darkness was a punishment, memories time cannot mend
Brutalized from the day of birth, to reality they can't return

Existing in a world of three lives inside of one

Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive Personalities
