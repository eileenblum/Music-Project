I would describe it as an invisible darkness
casting a shadow, a blinding black
guarded by hope, my soul is kept safeÂ from the bloody claws.

LookÂ toÂ beyond, what vision lets me see
time after time, unneeded misery
holding tight to my dreams
I own no price for you
I grip them tight and hope for sight.

Open my eyes wide to see a moment of clarity
confusion gone, it's in your hands
your turn to ask why.

[Solo Hamm / Schuldiner]

Life is like a mystery
with many clues, but with few answers
to tell us what it is that we can do to look
for messages that keep us from the truth
