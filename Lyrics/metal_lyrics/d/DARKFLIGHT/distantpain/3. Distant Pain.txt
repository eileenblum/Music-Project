Distant pain of a Black Night
White in ethereal spectres
Blank of all sleep, respite and hope
Immaculate fantoms occurred from a lacerated past
Still tearing the Present
Nowhere to hide
No way to find reason
Not eerie,
They are real
Living in my reality
With me they are crying
Screaming in an infinite sadness
Where pain has no boundaries
Distant pain so old, so close...
Ghosts of the Past
Fantoms of Tomorrow
