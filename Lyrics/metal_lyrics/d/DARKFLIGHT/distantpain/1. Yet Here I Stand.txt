Defeated but not vanquished
My arms surrender but my mind resists
Tormented but serene
My Victory will be over the Time
Wisdom dispels Hate and opens the gates to Grace
From the top of my exile
I contemplate the ruins
Where the insignificant vermin swarm miserably
Wallowing in their mire of hypocrisy,
weakness and meanness
Let's them degenerate
Solitude will be my Prize
Superiority my Pride
And Time their Demise
Yet here I stand
