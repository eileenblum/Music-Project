Scattered after the defeat
And the shadow of darkness is upon us
When all hope is lost
When armies are gone forevermore
And I'll see inhuman presence
Waits for me
Entering the woods
And searching for a shelter
From the last massacre
The Lord of darkness
Won this war with his power
He will rule this wretched world
All days will be gone, all life will suffer
The dream of evil
