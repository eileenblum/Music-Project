Held in the dungeons
Of darkest sorcerer
Witnessing his magic rituals
Helping his armies to win the war
Lying on the ground
With amputated limbs
He can not escape
From the pain
To suffer in the sphere
Is his fate
He'll fight with the beasts
To give them pleasure
To see him die
And now he's into the artificial
World chased by the beasts
Running with despair
