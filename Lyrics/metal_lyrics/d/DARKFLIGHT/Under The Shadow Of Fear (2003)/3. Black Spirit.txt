In the dephts of the black mountain
A new power is born
Black creature dwells down that caves
Full of darkness and despair
It will rise up to this world
And will hide the sun
When the darkness covers everything
All creatures will suffer eternally
It can erase the planet and there's
No power who can stop it
It has the destiny to prevail this world
The war against its creatures
Is a hopeless sacrifice
The presence of light is
Swallowed by the night
All life here's dead
Everything is gone nothing is left
