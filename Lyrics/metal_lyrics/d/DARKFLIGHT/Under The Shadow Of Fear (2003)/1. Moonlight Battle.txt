Magic fire at the battlefield
Soldiers possesed by evil power
Flying creatures fighting from above
Stabbing and cutting
Bodies struggling with hate
Through the way
I saw the pain
So alone
I want to free you
The prophecy is coming - Cruel
When the earth's illuminations rise
Blinded the soldiers continue
The fight led by raging wizards
Turning the battle into massacre
They've crossed the water
In my dream
Forlorn and exhausted
Running from the battle
