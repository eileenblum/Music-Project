I feel the wave
Waiting to see the end
A final light, the wind and smile
The darkness will bring me down
I feel the waves of light
Awaiting for a sigs from inside
Lying down and bleeding
Burning from inside
Trying to keep
The presence of light
Traveling into Shadowlands
You can find
The light between the ways
The wheel will turn
And life will begin again
Stepping into the dampness
Of my own grave
Drowned in tears
Held before the end
The eternal pain, bursting tears
Of tragic desperation
The agony of life
And Death's relief
Lying and penetrating
These dying dimensions
The witherd gardens
Of sorrow
