You, you left these arms holding nothing
Alone, set in this tomb of my tears
Liar, I know now that the truth was just another lie
It's too late, my heart has broken black
It's over and failure is the only memory that hasn't turned to rust
Sorrow; the only thing that doesn't seem to crumble at the touch
My throat still bleeds each time I call your name
But you will never know how hard I tried
Liar, I know now that the truth was just another lie
It's too late my heart has broken black
It's over and failure is the only memory that hasn't turned to rust
You, you left these arms holding nothing
