All this down in flames
For just one more breath
It's not worth this
It's worthless
This Side Of The Nightmare
The sound of tears on the shell of this broken heart
And time does nothing except close around me
This Side Of The Nightmare, rain still falls
As the suffering calls
Hear the tears still fall to the floor
As the suffering calls my name
How far can you carry this cross?
This falling sacrifice
How far can you carry this cross?
