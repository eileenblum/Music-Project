When the screams can't carry far enough
When the sands of time burn razor marks
When the ice burns cold and I can feel no more
I'll know, I'll know
I've seen this all before
I've felt this way before
I've heard this song before
Before
All this sings the prophecy
As the burning bridge falls out from under me
All this sings The Choir Of The Prophecy Fulfilled
On bent knees of shame
Face down in the tears
Waiting for the waiting to strike me down
When the screams can't carry far enough
When the sands of time burn razor marks
When the ice burns cold and I can feel no more
I'll know it's happened again
