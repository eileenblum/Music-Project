Blood seeps through the cracks of your lying teeth
As you've lost all hope in forgiveness
Because there's no one left to forgive you
Regret, lie to yourself
Because you're the only one you can believe
Regret, lie to yourself
Because you're the only one left
You've built yourself on lies
And I'm condemned to say I was once like you
The four walls of your past surround you
Like the screams you pretend not to hear
Regret, lie to yourself
Because you're the only one you can believe
Regret, lie to yourself
Because you're the only one left
Nothing will compare to the nights you spend
Screaming at the mirror for something you can never apologize for
Regret is the noose you hang yourself by
