Of a dying breed and a decaying seed
We've been watching for years
Waiting for it to bleed
Handshakes and contracts
Just before they turn their backs
We've played along for far too long
We've played along for far too long
We'll lay this down to waste
We'll leave you with a bitter taste
A long road no closer to home
Long road and we know we're still alone
We've played for far too long
We hope you listen to at least this song
Nothing but traces
Countless empty faces
With black lips
A cold kiss
Of rejection
