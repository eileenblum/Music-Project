Shades of lies forming stained glass
The beauty of which distracts
Until it shatters down
Crashes down
Those whose colors shown until now
Accusations hurled at deaf ears
A link that breaks by light let in
The truth will surely fade
Ever rolling waves
Wash them away
They'll run from light they helped hide
Pointing fingers at each other
Screaming
Until the sound of truth subsides
Screaming slowly turns to singing
Songs of shadowing of lies
Lies
Rebuilding shadowing of lies
Lies
Circumstantial truth of compromise
Lies
Rebuilding shadowing of lies
Lies
Paling apathy for truth survives
