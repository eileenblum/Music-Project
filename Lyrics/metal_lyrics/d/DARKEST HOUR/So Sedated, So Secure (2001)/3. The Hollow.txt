Stripped to the bone
Left standing alone
You want everything
And find falling home
Follow-- follow the hollow
And now there's no one  left to burn
Nothing to lose, nothing to earn
Did you find what you were looking for?
Was the greed worth selling yourself for?
A bloodlust so deep it cuts
With the faith of a sadist's
Healing touch
And you follow the hollow
Your life is wrapped around greed addiction
And you follow the hollow
Your life is wrapped around the things you need
Addiction
