You are a servant to your god
You are a slave to a book
You say you are just a messenger
But you'll end up hooked
This place feels like home
Walls echo, screaming no
This tough love feels
Like I'm being choked
Dependant on a whim
Bow down before him
You suckle righteousness
And siphon lies
This rope feels like home
My mouth is gagged
My hands are bound
This tough love feels like
I'm being drowned
And in a daze one day
You'll wake up old and gray
And realize you've alienated
Those who cared about you
Say you will forgive me me again
Your pride is the birth of your original sin
Say I can be saved again
Well I won't and I think you know
Because of you
This is not all for him
It's for you
The blessed father
Tainted blood of a martyr
