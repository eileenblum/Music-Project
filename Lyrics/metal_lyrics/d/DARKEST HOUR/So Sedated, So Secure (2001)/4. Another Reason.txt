Keep your eyes on the trigger
And your mind on the ecstasy
Just caress the emptiness
Sit back and let it bleed
We need salvation
We need another god on the TV screen
We need to believe
Fill your pockets with other's casualties
Just a talk show leaper prophecy
Just caress the emptiness
Sit back and let it bleed
Can you show me happiness?
Can you show me the other side of the prison chain?
Can you show me primetime addiction?
Sadistic delusion
Our father, Our sponsor, Our cheap plastic figure
Our father, Our sponsor
Can you spare one more dollar?
