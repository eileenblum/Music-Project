I am no one
I have no home
Forsaken daughters
Forsaken sons
Enter oblivion

My eyes shut
My head awake
Been following the one thing that never stays
Salvation you never get
Been following the sun so it never sets

I have no fear anymore
Iâve bled my life
For foolish devotion
And foolish pride

Lay waste dying day
Tourniquet
Turn away

Surrounding vacant hollow trees
All left to wander endlessly

It never bleeds
It never dies
Oblivion
