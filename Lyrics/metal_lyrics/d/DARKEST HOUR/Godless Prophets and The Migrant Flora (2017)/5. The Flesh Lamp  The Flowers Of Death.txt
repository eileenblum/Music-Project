There is no versus
There is no together
A perverse salvation
Romanticized failure

Bloodlust incarnate
Bloodlust eternal
The final breath of your enemy
The savage recital
Of war hymns forgotten
These war pigs for profit
This is the pioneer's harvest
This land is nothing is no one's and has never been
Bloodlust surrounding
Bloodlust within

The flesh and the flowers
Of death bringing glory to cowards
These are the tyrants
The lovers of power
We are loyal to none

I have drank their blood and
I have lived a thousand lives

Now I am never forever
And the moon will continue to rise
A curse on the light of the sun
All hail the darkness
All hail the unholy
