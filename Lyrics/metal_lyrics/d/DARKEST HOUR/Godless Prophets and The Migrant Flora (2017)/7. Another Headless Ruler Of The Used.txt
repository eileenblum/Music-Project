The classic tale of the wolf
The saga of sheep
Surrender transcendence
Surrender humility
The origin of violence
We open on

Godless prophets
Liars entombed
Another headless ruler of the used

The dreadful one
Takes a step back to reveal
A forwardness unwelcome
To harbor conceal
And if what I see is real
The world is full of

War this confusion
More there is no plan
War no divination
More the creation of man

The gallows haunt the sediment

Selective odds
The sacrifice is real
The sacrifice of youth
The solace of the steel
And if what I know is true
We sacrifice to
