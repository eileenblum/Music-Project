To become one and the same
To erase to rebuild and reclaim
The new evolution
Humanity is bored
It's selling for sport
And hunting for more

Creation banal nothing is new
When all that you want has already been used

I reject you in the name of us all
I should be afraid
I should be ashamed yet I

When there is no joy in discovery
We hallucinate into
Psychic progression
Or is it just a set up
A monolithic realm
Spiraling tunneling down

I don't feel anything at all
Be gone forget
Out of our heads
out of this life
Worship the knife
Celebrate death with your celibate wife

Cut through skin
fear the knife
I don't care how you wasted your life

I don't feel anything for you
For you were the cause
