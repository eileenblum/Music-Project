This time the circle closes
This time there's nothing left for you, for me
This time the circle closes
This time we lay this to rest
Others just like the others
Loneliness, hopelessness
Others just like the others
Hopelessness, hollowness
Others just like the others
Hollowness, heartlessness
Tonight, I'll kiss your poison lips
This time your past surrounds you
This time the circle closes in
This time salvation binds you
This time the hate will break you again
Fears-- you said face your fears
But the tears make it all so clear to me now
Tonight, I'll kiss your poison lips
