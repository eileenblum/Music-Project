That's all right because you wish you were dead
You live life with a hex over your head
A savior's mouth with a serpent's tongue
But don't forget you're like this with the chosen one

And I forget about my losing streak
But you never slip at a chance to remind
It sounds like you should save a prayer for me
But I'll take my chances with the unworthy

And you know the quick path
The righteous the way back
I'll end up the only one
I'll end up the lost son

And you know the quick path
The righteous the way back
I'll end up the only one
I'll end up the forgotten

And you know the quick path
The righteous the way back
I'll end up the only one

Swallow it all and wash it all down
It must be the weight of that crown
And all the lies seem to become me
Because it's easier than the truth

Failure the only thing that seems to matter
It's not the fact that you're the walking dead

And you know the quick path
The righteous the way back
I'll end up the only one
I'll end up the lost son

And you know the quick path
The righteous the way back
I'll end up the only one
I'll end up the forgotten

And you know the quick path
The righteous the way back
I'll end up the only one

So save a prayer for me
So save a prayer for me
Don't waste a prayer on me

So save a prayer for me
Don't waste a prayer on me
