I can still see
You sucking the life out of me
I can still feel the chill
Down my spine when you told me
Always one fateful night
That turns the tide
Always one fateful night
With nowhere to hide
To live and die
In a day there's nothing
Left to say
Time will not erase
The counting down of the days
You finally got
What you've been waiting for
A handful of pills
Didn't soften the blow
One month of sucking it in
It started to show
Waking up to realize
It's not a dream
Was the hardest thing
