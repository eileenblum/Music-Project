We are the embarrassment to market suicide
Without eyes full of genocide
We live where flags can buy more than others' lives
Where it's fashion to show your love homocide [homicide, most likely]
Of the victim we haven't seen enough
For the victim it's the escape that keeps them drugged
It's the best blood money can buy
It's the best way to fund genocide
A violent missionary sect
Feeds a bullet for every word against
Salvation in a warhead
The patriot virus is being spread
The only antidote the give is to fear what's next
Prepackaged and advertised with a hymn
Singing anthems for the walking dead
Fear what's next
