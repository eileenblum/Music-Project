[FYE bonus track]

Those haunting consequences
Left the spoiled taste of regret in my mouth
Left to work it out alone
And when you fell asleep
Did you think of me?
This is the closing of the day
And you escaped before I could reach out to you
Those crippled memories all surge inside a lifeless mind
Passing time won't reconcile a sickness with no name
An antidote that won't bring you back
And as you draw your final breath,
Please forgive me I
Will never forget you.
