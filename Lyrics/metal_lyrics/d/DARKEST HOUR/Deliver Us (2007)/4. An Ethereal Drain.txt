Crossed out of our mindscapes
We're frozen in the time
Stretched around your face a mask
A clever disguise ever
So enticing this corroding chemical synapse
Spawn of a beast
An ethereal drain tatters on the brink
Burst into a cloud of spores
Explode into the atmosphere
Weaving our lives with chaotic design siphons
What's left inside
Suppress us
Impress us with subtle delusions
And life-like proportions
Bled into one another plagiarize
Our dreams
A rift in eternity
All encompassing within it's entirety..
Baptized in fire
Leeching the underbelly
Tired traditions
Retired a discord within the choir
So sing the praise with your noiseless voices
And pass the blame in the age of distorted reality
Refined relief in chaos unleashed we find release
