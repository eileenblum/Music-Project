Call it our nature or call it what you will
Automatic, trapped in the undercurrent
Presumed an unstoppable force
Through the ages spilled onto pages

Shine on you nonbelievers
You can call it colossal upheaval
When we wake up from our induced slumber
They can try but they can't conquer us all

Compelling evidence out in the open
There's not even anybody to hide it from
What it looks like on the outside constantly
Reflects how we perceive it
And it's not always what you think

Shine on you nonbelievers
You can call it colossal upheaval
When we wake up from our induced slumber
They can try but they can't conquer us all

Knee deep in the belly of the beast
Offering us another cut-rate version
Of your dream come true
