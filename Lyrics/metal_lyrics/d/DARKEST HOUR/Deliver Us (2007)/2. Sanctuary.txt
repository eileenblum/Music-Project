On dawn of the day I arose to the thunder again
The pounding in my head
It doesn't seem to phase me
How every scream the pretend not to hear echoes through me
Standing, complacently waiting
I try to tell myself
Our lives are worth more than this
So give me a chance to take it all back,
I'll show you that I'm worth more than your pittance or pity
It's a spit in the face
So don't even try to explain
The earth shakes beneath my feet
And as these buildings
They crumble around me
I call out if you can hear me
Come and let me out,
Oh please break me out!
And give me sanctuary
You know this whole world knows
You won't be satisfied 'til you fill up another cemetery
It's all a game to you
We won't be fooled by you into thinking that it's easy,
Nobody said this would be easy to swallow or process or fake
And dark will be the day when I elude their desires
No longer will I be..
