All their reign falls to the earth just the same
So turn and look the other way
Because you're a failure time and again

And you can try to black it out stomp the fire out,
Fuck your tail and run don't move and inch your war pig fuck,
You just stand right there and receive your judgment

All their reign falls to the earth just the same
And even as I waste there words on you and your mock reality,
You'll still go down in history see:
Stupid spoiled little shit nearly wiped us out

And by the time that you realize the damage you've
Done you'll be long fucking gone, you coward you puppet

All their reign falls to the earth just the same
And you can try to black it out stomp the fire out,
Fuck your tail and run don't move and inch your war pig fuck,
You just stand right there and receive your judgment
