This world is dying everyday
Don't let it come between us
Our fate has traveled this far
And now the storm brings us faster to a close
Brimming with pathetic prose

Vacate your stolen hearts
As if nobody's seen us
And empty out your pockets
You needn't bring
Anything where we're going

And to think we created this monster
Crawling in and walking out on us
To think that we craft our own disasters
Falling in and falling out of hope

Don't leave me, I need this
Unleashed and unafraid, us castaways
Calling out release us, propelling towards
Insidious decay at an alarming rate

And to think we created this monster
Crawling in and walking out on us
To think that we craft our own disasters
Falling in and falling out of hope

Don't leave me, give me release
Don't sink down into defeat
Only when you're through fleeing
Can you save yourself deliver us
