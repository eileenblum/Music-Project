We keep drifting on and on
Across this barren wasteland
Seared earth laid waste
On another plane of existence

Blinding brilliant light
Alludes to the illusion of serenity
So show me what it takes
To fall asleep on the eve of destruction

Set ablaze like the plague in our brooding creations
Look up and align with the fire in the skies

Blinding brilliant light
Alludes to the illusion of serenity
So show me what it takes
To fall asleep on the eve of destruction

Cracked with the drought
Something amiss in the bleak blissed out
Song in our heads
Completely depleted

Blinding brilliant light
Alludes to the illusion of serenity
So show me what it takes
To fall asleep on the eve of destruction

Flashing fading in and out showered in sweet redemption
That final glimpse into abyss on the brink of eruption
