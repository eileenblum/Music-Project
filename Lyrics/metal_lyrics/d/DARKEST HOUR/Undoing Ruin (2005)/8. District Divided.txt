We are the expatriated our fate cards have played us neighbors
Displaced us we've seen that these demographics are targets shot down
By the market I've felt the wrath of the greedy now complete with more
Monsters I've seen the needs of a city completely ignored surrounded
By vultures we are the sons and the daughters expecting betrayal
Neglecting out passions we know your plans don't include us that's why
We've made our own destroyers of culture insatiable their appetite the
Gluttons who consumed their way to the top
