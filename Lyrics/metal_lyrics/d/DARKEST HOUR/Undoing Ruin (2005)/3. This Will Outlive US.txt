Gone are the days of evasion existence is how you create it what ever
Compels you to keep on embrace it so long as the missing piece of the
Puzzle split down the middle we had better prepare ourselves for
Perpetual winter why do we do this to ourselves continuous escape
A living hell like those other lovers hidden under the covers it's
So empty in the arms of another see what you've done you're
Irresistible with your sordid stories the morbid glory of it all
Remember when times were worth celebrating pour the wine for the
Fallen friends and foes singing in unison my hell is a blank piece
Of paper staring back at me my hell is wasted potential haunting me
