This decaying flesh is coming back to life reanimate me give me
A chance and I'll be right here where the sun hits the sea watching
These waves wash the pain away and it will radiate so brilliantly that
We can keep pushing on and get on with life cause we deserve it now
I know that the worst is behind us now onward and upward we take
Flight on bruised and battered wings we soar above our clouded
Thoughts never looking back we can regain a sense of balance that's
Been gone so long give me a chance to reason with the odds to pick
Myself back up regain a balance gone so long
