After midnight's glow and morning's gloom has settled in its
Self-inflicted sense of self-loathing waking up from the longest dream
Where we're all running away it's a sobering experience still sinking
Still spinning still hanging by a thread I've been thinking I'll stop
Wasting the days away and make life worth living controlling these
Demons and stopping sirens from screaming lapsing in and out of this
Great escape a love-hate relationship we're all stuck in our ways and
As we drown everyday we revel in our self-indulgence and wonder why we
Feel so trapped in our bodies in out rooms in out cities with our
Words
