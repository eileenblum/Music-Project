Injected venom sucking the life from us away for eighty days
it's white noise
just white noise
staying awake for the music's sake
they say they listen but never hear a thing
mass deception illusion perception
we say they listen
to white noise

can this really be our time?
are we found to find the line?
disillusion me again
can we really be the only ones who see this charade?

the meaning is fleeting
all these egos competing
searching for an identity
through the series of misleadings

Low

Injected venom
sucking the life from us
away for eighty days
it's white noise
just white noise
staying awake for the music's sake

can we really be, really be the only ones who see this charade?
can this really be our time?
are we found to find the line?
disillusion me again
