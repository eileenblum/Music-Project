My heart's been racing with my mind to the finish line of these
Fevered times stuck down again this turbulence has overcome
Tranquility pounding the walls inside these thoughts I can't control
And shooting through my veins these heightened senses overwhelming
Confusion replaces clarity a neurotic rearrangement you know the
Feeling when down feels up to it's old tricks again so misleading when
It hits like a ton of bricks to the chest out of breath on the
Bathroom floor and I'll make light of this night and night of this day
It's what I tell myself to sleep when I dream myself awake
