It's been a long night
Waiting to sleep the day away
And it's been a long time coming along with me every step of the way

[Chorus:]
Oh, confinement binds you
Nothing scares me
Nothing thrills me
I've fooled myself into believing
That nothing ails me
Nothing kills me
Oh, confinement binds you
Nothing scares me
Nothing thrills me
I've fooled myself into believing
Nothing ails me
Nothing can kill me

And stagnant time
Is a breeding ground for regrets and wrongdoings
Resolutions take their time that's if they even come at all

Always seeking redemption
Through the echoes I've listened and still came up missing

Always seeking redemption
Through the echoes I've listened and seek through the cracks

And stagnant time
Is a breeding ground for regrets and wrongdoings
Resolutions take their time that's if they even come at all

[Chorus:]
Oh, confinement binds you
Nothing scares me
Nothing thrills me
I've fooled myself into believing
That nothing ails me
Nothing kills me
Oh, confinement binds you
Nothing scares me
Nothing thrills me
I've fooled myself into believing
Nothing ails me
Nothing can kill me

These wounds
Will heal
And they canât stop me now

[Solo]

These wounds
Will heal
Nothing can stop me now

These wounds
Will heal

These wounds
Will heal

See, these wounds
Will heal
[scream]
