Out of your life and into your mind
Divided lines
Someone forgotten, something inside
Somewhere in time

Less, less than a sight
And never more than a sound
So vile and infectious
A lucid recount

And I'll never say what you want me to say
When I tell you everything's gonna fade
And I'll never be what you want me to be
When I'm in the misery that we've made
The misery that we've made

And when will I know
And when will you tell me
What we already know
This is all temporary

I, I was in doubt
Whenever you were around
Denial and acceptance
With or without

And I'll never say what you want me to say
When I tell you everything's gonna fade
And I'll never be what you want me to be
When I'm in the misery that we've made
When I'm in the misery

And I'll never say what you want me to say
When I tell you everything's gonna fade
And I'll never be what you want me to be
When I'm in the misery that we've made

Misery
And I'll never be what you
Want me to be
When I'm in the misery
