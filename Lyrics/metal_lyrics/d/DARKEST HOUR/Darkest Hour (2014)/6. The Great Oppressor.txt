You hear that hidden voice, it tells you
You're never alone
You know the price you'll have to pay
To stay where you are
If anything compels you
To shut out the sun
I'll be there in that never after
Where everyone is gone

There's not a thought
And not a law put into place
To halt the fall
Of human creation

We'll never see and never understand
Just why we are the human intention

I know you're living a double life
Out of my mind like you're out of my sight
Reminded, rewired, fought envied, desired
I fell in the fire that night

I'll see you there for the rest of your life
Until the end of all time

I see the borders and they tell me
You've never been free
And every voice that's screaming out
Ðegging for release

There's not a thought
And not a law put into place
To halt the fall
Of human creation

We'll never see and never understand
Just why we are the human intention

I know you're living a double life
Out of my mind like you're out of my sight
Reminded, rewired, fought envied, desired
I fell in the fire that night

I'll see you there for the rest of your life

The great oppressor buried in a glow so red
Living dead, we want what we can never
Levitated, ravenous, reanimated
Roaming, clawing the earth, a better ending

A slave, not a slave
I don't beg for forgiveness
Or exist in another's head
I won't give in
I'm the passion of someone
Who's never given a shit

I'm the mistake of your life
That tear-soaked embrace
Our one final moment in time and space
