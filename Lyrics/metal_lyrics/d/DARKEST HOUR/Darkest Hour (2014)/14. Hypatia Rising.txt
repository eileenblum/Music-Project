Burn alive when your whole life you're just taught to die
And fear your instincts and form a line
Trust no one you can't look in the eye
Trust yourself you can find where the power lies

The world has changed the world is changing
Empires fall and centuries craving
A shift a wall a rift
A knowledge of self
Of solace and health
Look inside you can find where the power lies
And ride by the starlight and know why

You could never relate to the world
You could never rely
You can sever the state from the land
But not the day from the night
Not the sound from the sight

Fade into a magnetic north so true
A passing phase under a blood red moon
Make it right and show me how to sell the light
And find where the power lies
And ride by the starlight
And know why

Look above laughing when all is lost
