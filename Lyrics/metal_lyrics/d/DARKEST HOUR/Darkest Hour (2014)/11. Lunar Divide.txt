Trapped under your race, and under your glow
Been away for too long to know
How we ever began, and how we ever will end
I never wanted to be the one
I thought I wanted to be alone
Oh, but I need this now, so much more than I ever have

I see the morning light
And live for this moment
Yet I celebrate the night
With anyone, anywhere
Now that you've been on my lunar side
(Now that you've been on my lunar side)
And maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never get this right

Separated the body and mind
Are you someone I'll never find?
Follow me right into the center of
My secondary life, into the crypts, divide
I forget what it's like to close my eyes

I see the morning light
and live for this moment
Yet I celebrate the night
With anyone, anywhere
And now that you've been on my lunar side
(Now that you've been on my lunar side)
And maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never get

This is not what it seems
Lifelike infinity-dreams
Wilted lacks giving same
Lifelessly wandering away

This is not what it seems
Will anybody ever be enough?
Oh, just a crushing and hollow crush
Lifelessly wandering and forever following

Somebody has this dream
Will never want to ring
Never want to rewind

I see the morning light
and live for this moment
Yet I celebrate the night
With anyone, anywhere
And now that you've been on my lunar side
(Now that you've been on my lunar side)
Maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never get this right
