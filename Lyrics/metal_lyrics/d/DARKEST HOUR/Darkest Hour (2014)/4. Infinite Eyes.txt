My dove of prey
Will you forever haunt me
I've lusted and envied
The one and the infinite eyes
And for now I see nothing but blood in the skies

I'm living a drug
The white tower and the blackened lungs
Release my body into the night
Nothing is sacred when nothing is right
So take me away from this spiteful life

Never mourning
Never leaving
Never setting and end or repeating
And every day
Is never complete
When every night you must fall asleep

And realize
There's some places you don't wanna find
And do what you want with me tonight
Just take me away from this spiteful life

I'm living a drug
The white tower and the blackened lungs
Release my body into the night
Nothing is sacred when nothing is right
So take me away from this spiteful life
Where nothing is sacred and nothing is right

Why are we standing alone
Anticipating what your life will become
When maybe this whole time
Self preservation your motivation
To whore lie and steal from the weak

It isn't veiled or discreet
Oh so what did you think
This circle will always sink
To the darkest depths of the obsolete

I'm living a drug
The white tower and the blackened lungs
Release my body into the night
Nothing is sacred when nothing is right
So take me away from this spiteful life
Where nothing is sacred and nothing is right
