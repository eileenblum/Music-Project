Finally silently I go and take with me
No one to take on the world that I've known
This body has gone to the ends of the earth
But may never know any place to call home

Like the future is dead like the future is lost
What matter can shatter the surface now
What makes you think there's a purpose how
Do you live like your past is a god
Well I live like the future is dead and lost

It's a sign that you never were meant to know
Some time it's a knife it'll cut you up
I take this wherever I go
And what lies ahead nobody can know

And I won't wait for any other
All will come to pass in time
The story closes on another
Day of fire fate of mine
The dove the eagle and that vulture
Fly from the flesh into the ever after
