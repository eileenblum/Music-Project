Fall on command
Either you wait for an end
Or already been called on to be
Every lion and lamb and broken belief
Split the atom in three naturally
Decomposition in sweltering heat
The sublime the sick and denied
Time is a crutch yeah time is contrived

When the salt of the earth is bland
And I'm prowling
Just a predator in the end
And I've horded
But somewhere I lost
What I thought was mine
The sublime

And in your own selfish way waste away
Thrown out of the one place you thought you were safe
Prophet thee prophecy was never related and never believed

When the salt of the earth is bland
And I'm prowling
Just a predator in the end
And I've horded
But somewhere I lost
What I thought was mine

I feel your breath
Down my spine
I've never been so close to divine

Beneath the blackening sky
Come alive
Forever winter and forever night
To the bone to the rind
Perpetual motion or frozen in time
Feel your breath down my spine
Forever winter forever night

When the salt of the earth is bland
And I'm prowling
Just a predator in the end
And I've horded
But somewhere I lost
Everything I've known
An empty world to forever roam

Fall away fall apart
Until never is real
And nothing is right
