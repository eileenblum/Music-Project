Some fires will never die
Some will never ignite
Are you still living a lie
Or will you revel in the rest of your life

With every blinding light
I see the future inside
And I feel it even when I'm away from you

If I will, you won't
And if I do, you don't
And I'll do whatever you want
Whatever you want me to

Some fires will never die
Some will never ignite
Are you still living a lie
Or will you revel in the rest of your life

And I never listened when you told me
That I could make everything disappear completely
Another ghost in your life
Another spirit in white
Forever wondering why
I just wander in space and time
Some fires will never die
Some will never ignite
Are you still living a lie
Or will you revel in the rest of your life

That's when I knew
You are the one for me
And I'm the one for you

I feel you right where I left you that night
My ember lies
Separation of body and mind

Some fires will never die
Some will never ignite
Are you still living a lie
Or will you revel in the rest of your life
Some fires will never die
Some will never ignite
Time everything just right
And you can revel in the rest of your life

That's when I knew
You are the one for me
And I'm the one for you
I feel you right
Where I left you that night
My ember lies
Separation of body and mind
Separation of body and mind
