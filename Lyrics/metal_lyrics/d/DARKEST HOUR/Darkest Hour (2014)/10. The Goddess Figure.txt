Forever looking back
Forever tormented
So clever in disguise
And never was she fully realized
Take everything you have
Take everything you thought you ever knew
And leave it for the Goddess Figure
True I've been wrong
And I've been taught a lie
And can never go back
To the throes of a normal life
I'm in love with the world

Time waits in spirals and in circuits and
We stay in peril and imperfect and
Why wait for the silence to be heard when you are
The reason why I'm in love with the world

And when you follow in his shadow
You're devoured by your loss
Some pay forever with their winnings
False I've been true
And it's a lonely line of work that we do
Unto thee given no reply no affection so

Time waits in spirals and in circuits and
We stay in peril and imperfect and
Why wait for the silence to be heard when you are
The reason why I'm in love with the world

I've been brought up believing a lie
Her vision clearly burns in my eyes
Sun stay surrealist and infinite
Give all the true power limitless
Now I'm alone with a poison mind
It's enough to know

Time waits in spirals and in circuits and
We stay in peril and imperfect and
Why wait for the silence to be heard when you are
The reason why I'm in love with the world
