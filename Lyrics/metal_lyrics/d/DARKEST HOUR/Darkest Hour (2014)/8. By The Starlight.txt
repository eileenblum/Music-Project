Wake up my love, this is fading
Tomorrow is waiting and I'm going nowhere tonight

Wait up, don't wait up too late
I'll be out at the same place I always end up every night

Please forgive us
Carnivorous, to the moment I wake

Lay down, don't lay down to sleep
But you already knew
Some are endless while others they can never last

I know, I know you've been patient
While I've been escapin'
Always waitin'
For something you can never have

Please forgive us
Carnivorous, to the moment I wake
I love your lust
Mysterious
But there's always a way
Though in every mistake
To the moment I wake
There's things I'll hate
In everything we create

Forever light
Is all you create
Is all you've become
It's never too late
I'm not the only one

Please forgive us
Carnivorous, I'm not the only one
Please forgive us
Carnivorous, I'm not the only one for you
