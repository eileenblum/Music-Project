[Bonus Track]Oblivious then you opened my eyes
Have I been asleep my entire life or lost
Lost and unable to follow?
It's the same thing you always said
"Am I alive or just living dead?"
They're not, not unrelated or far off from

Sorrow, I need a reason to exist
I know that you've noticed
I wait 'til my words are swallowed
And I'll never understand
Why you waste your whole life without facing reality
All life is one

And tell me how did you ever find yourself back where you said you'd never
When I wake up I never know just what I'm facing
I know what it's not
It's not the same person I used to know as

Sorrow, I need a reason to exist
I know that you've noticed
I wait 'til my words are swallowed
And I'll never understand
Why you waste your whole life without facing reality
All life is taken and given to none

I know you better than myself
And you won't recognize what's become of me
For I am no longer in

Sorrow, I need a reason to exist
I know that you've noticed
I wait 'til my words are swallowed
And I'll never understand
Why you waste your whole life without facing reality
All life end and begins with the sun
