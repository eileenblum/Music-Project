And maybe everyone else is wrong
And maybe you were the one
And I knew it all along
Anti-Axis and against all

Erase your head
And don't compare yourself to the rest
Find a mate and form a nest
And rest well every night for you are blessed
And well on your way to success

Wake me up when it's over
I know I'm not aligned tonight
We begin then it's over so

I know forever can never stay
And every beginning can never decay
Silhouettes and their descending phase
But it's not over, it's never too late

Separated and building a wall
Sell it well, push away
When the dawn is upon us

Wake me up when it's over
I know I'm not aligned tonight
We begin then it's over so

I know forever can never stay
And every beginning can never decay
Silhouettes and their descending phase
But it's not over, it's never too late

To be under attack
I remember you were wearing black
Everyone was singing songs to distract
Never ending, never giving back
Never knowing where you belong

Maybe everyone else is wrong
And maybe you were the one
And I knew it all along
Anti-Axis and against all

I know forever can never stay
And every beginning can never decay
Silhouettes and their descending phase
But it's not over, it's never too late

It's not over, it's never too late
It's not over, it's never too late
