Can you remember the day
You started your whole new life as a slave
High on empowerment
Yet cowering off as you piss down your leg
You were so proud but it's all gone away

Now it's either you're neutered or spayed
In the blink of the eye of the storm
Silent eyes go with colorless noise
Is it all by design

Tantalized by a prophet man
Ðh, but it's a severed hand
And you'll never fucking understand
When you're polarized
You always knew it was just mud and sand
Oh, but on the other hand
Maybe it was all at your command

Trying eyes, c'mon and bless me with cyanide
Just don't wander too close to the light
Not alive, just lost for life
Lost for life

Sell me more, you fucking whore
I can't get enough
And now I'm on a negative rise
Not alive, just lost for life

Tantalized by a prophet man
Ðh, but it's a severed hand
And you'll never fucking understand
When you're polarized
You always knew it was just mud and sand
Oh, but on the other hand
Maybe it was all at your command

I'm already gone
Returned to the sun

And if the thought should arise
Another repulsive chance for reprise
Too massive to ever escape
Yet I can't wait for impulse to provide

Trying eyes, c'mon and bless me with cyanide
Just don't wander too close to the light
Not alive, just lost for life
