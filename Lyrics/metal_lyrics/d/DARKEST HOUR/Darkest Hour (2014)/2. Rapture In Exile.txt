Fuck waiting around to die
When all my life I've been dead inside
Fear as a god
The final facade
The rapture in exile
The flooded red
And black as the winter ahead

Abstract and artifacted
When we are all either
Outsourced or outcasted
They'll melt the bodies down
To reclaim the plastic
And separated from their
Mothers in masses

Fuck waiting around to die
When all my life I've been dead inside
I am your enemy now
And you will never take me down

Fuck waiting around to die
When all my life I've been dead inside
I am the rapture in exile

Would you change it if you could
Or continue to realize
What you never understood
Is that this world could be yours

Would you change it if you could
Or continue to realize
What you never understood
Is that this world could be yours
But I don't think you want it
