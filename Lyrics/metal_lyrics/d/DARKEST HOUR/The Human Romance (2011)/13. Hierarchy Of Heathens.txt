[Bonus Track]Create the same opposition
It's all part of the plan
Design the sordid creations
Wipe the blood from your blade
The call of the pigs
Sense the defeat in the air
Take all of their heads
Leave everybody to rot to the end

In the wake of men
Living on borrowed land
So you can carry out
The will of your master's plan

[Chorus]
And I've been a slave and a noble man
No difference anyway
I've been away for too long to tell
The predator from prey
[X2]

Erase, erase the division
It's a sign of revolt
Always silence my barrier
Are we products of all we've been taught?

In the wake of men
Living on borrowed land
Is all we know

[Chorus]
And I've been a slave and a noble man
No difference anyway
I've been away for too long to tell
The predator from prey
[X2]

Our will is
Our will is dead
When we hang our heads
Defeated and beaten down
Your faith is a river in which you will drown
Our will is
Our will is dead
When we hang our heads
Defeated and beaten down
Your faith is a river in which you will drown

We are a sign that burns
We burn it everyday

[Chorus]
And I've been a slave and a noble man
No difference anyway
I've been away for too long to tell
The predator from prey
[X2]

Go and cover your heads
You don't know how to live
You're already dead
This is the moment to
Free your pitiful soul
You don't exist
When you're under control
This is the time to decide
