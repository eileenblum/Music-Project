I can't feel anything, I don't respond to pleasure or pain, a vapid void, neglected toy, saturate in shame

Is it better than, better than the rest or does this end with abruptness, shallow at best

I don't know anyone, I don't know anything but this, met with either the calm or massive resistance

And at the end of your everyday disaster, does it keep getting faster

Awaiting patiently as the circle completes, it's finally coming around, but when the smoke has cleared it's been another year

Of wasting and running around
