I'm out of balance with the earth
Out of rhythm with the moon
Just a savage primal being
To the modern world immune

To the modern world immune

There is no solace this way
I know you want me as an enemy
I know you want all you can never see
But we're all living in purgatory

Damned it's all a part of the plan
Wherever you walk and everywhere that you stand

You stand in the way

Another cycle ends too soon
Another season of monsoons
Just a savage primal being
To the modern world immune

There is no solace this way
I know you want me as an enemy
I know you want all you can never see
But we're all living in purgatory

Ascendance pretending
Immortal wandering
Look to the skies
Look to the heavens for guidance or lies

And through the depths of oblivion
Lies your living salvation

I'm out of balance with the earth
Out of rhythm with the moon
Just a savage primal being

And now it's over and there's no way
To find the solace today
I know you want me as enemy
I know you want all you can never see

We're all living in purgatory
It's so ordinary
Human oratory
We're all living in purgatory
