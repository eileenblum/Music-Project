Says the feral instinctual side
"The thrill of the hunt"
Says the prophet of all that's been said and done
"Savor the kill"

Unsettled, severance undone
A non-living presence will never

Grow until you fall overblown
Transcend to the beat
Separate from the world of thought
The world of belief

I don't show what you already know
I'm plagued with relief
Out in plain view for all to see
They'd never believe

Compelled to separate the needs
From all you wanted the world to see

I'm no better than the
Animal in everybody
Changing your mind
Keeping the life in the

Wild have you never noticed
Everyone who thinks they know
The answer is wrong
A vision, a saying, a song

You are the fall
No master of your domain
There is no law

I'm no better than the
Animal in everybody
Changing your mind
Keeping the life in the wild

Go out into the cold dark night
Show your survival, your purpose, your plight

I'm no better than
I'm no better than
I'm no better than
The animal
