Oh you're in the crosshairs did you ever know
You're in the process of phasing out

War for peace every treaty written in blood
Struck down with disease

Get away
Give up the prospects of
Better days
They're over you're washed up

Against your own kind the animal
Cannibalistic inseparable

War for peace every treaty written in blood
Struck down with disease

Innovations of warring clans
Sacrificial the contracts of man
Devoid of purpose or precedence
A selfish existence violent by nature

Get away
Give up the prospects of
Better days
They're over you're washed up

I'm a masochistic machine
I shit where I fuck where I eat
So don't ever listen to anything I say
Cuz I just don't believe

Anything anymore
And I've lied to myself
And I've stolen so much more but

All I need is something that's new
All that I've made I can't undo
All I need is someone like you
You're never lost I'm not confused

Fates lie to me
Lie to the faces of all that believe in
Faith the price of virtue
Paid in full is it all that you've worked for
