Severed into separates
We are segmentary habitats
All that we know never has the structure
Gotten through

Place everyone into a maze
Watch them run around the race

Work your life away
End up in the streets
Oh the price you'll pay
Never be at ease

The need to be together
Or put in your place
Muzzled bound and tethered
A compromise you make

Involuntary crime
Flares up
A solitary life
Masks the mass hysteria
And you should know
This is no area to be alone

So work your life away
End up in the streets
Oh the price you'll pay
Never be at ease

The need to be together
Or put in your place
Muzzled bound and tethered
A compromise you make

Your process leads you
Where your thoughts misread you
A peasant once removed
Brand new set of rules
They'll never leave you
Once you shelter and feed them
Supplemented
And synchronized

Work your life away
End up in the streets
Oh the price you'll pay
Never be at ease

The need to be together
Or put in your place
Muzzled bound and tethered
A compromise you make

A compromise you make
