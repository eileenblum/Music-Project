Breathe your every breath self-obsessed a sensational place
Your winning hand cripples this impoverished state
Your business here I don't care you're not welcome to feed
Yourself to death it's just not ever gonna be enough

So chemical every scent you wear
A bath in shit all flesh and hair
Among the squeals and the selfish prayers
I never knew you were never there

Need you think you need so you live so lustfully
Peel the skin away we're all the same until you taste
Yourself but all you want is more an insatiable breed
And you will know the slaughterhouse the happy home

Pigs they think that they own you
Every pig can smell where you've been
Everybody knows a pig that wants to reform you
All those pigs they're all soulless beasts

A subtle mount a ripe affair
I'll be your accomplice anywhere
And I don't know if you even care
A cloven hoof in the mouth beware

And I've never known the difference
Between man and swine
Of rabid sex so self-aware
It happens all the time

I want you sick and slovenly
I want you all the time
No common lines to hide behind

It happens all the time
It happens all the time
It happens all the time
