I'm that face you think you recognized
Saw you in a dream
Saw your life flash by
Hallucinating

Looking through the crooked glass
Prison within
A prism like existence

We'll never know the truth
We'll never get a chance
To undo or relive our youth

Put every sacred place in a state of stasis nonentities
And I'm the bitter release I'm the better disease
Come down with me

A secondary life to precede visions from your past
Feeling that you've saved the worst for last
You're on the path prepared to misstep but it's never where you go
It's who you've seen and the impressions that you leave

We'll never know the truth
We'll never get a chance
To undo or relive our youth

Put every sacred place in a state of stasis nonentities
And I'm the bitter release I'm the better disease
Come down with me

Come down with me
Come down with me

Your life in control separated
What we know and who we are

Put every sacred place in a state of stasis nonentities
And I'm the bitter release I'm the better disease
Come down with me

Beyond the life you
The life you know
As a phantom as a phantom

Beyond the life you
The life you know
As a phantom as a phantom
