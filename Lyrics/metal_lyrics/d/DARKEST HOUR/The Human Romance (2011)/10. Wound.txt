This strategy won't change
It's over when
Never do you gain
And always you win

And tragedy remains
Though we're given
Every chance to change
We don't listen just pass the blame

Sing over decay
Blood flowing the wrong way
A constant state of refusal
Now it's too late

When you're ready you will see
The maker's always been within your hands
Destroyer at your feet

Save every resolution
You never could create

When your way is the only way
You can't look at yourself and say
'I was wrong'
You've got the head of the king
On the body of a pawn

The passion of a storm
The contemplation in the eye
A separatist within our midst
A loyalist divide

When your way is the only way
You can't look at yourself and say
'I was wrong'
You've got the head of a king
On the body of a pawn

When it's not the life you want
What answers do you need
Want everything up front
Prepare to meet defeat

When its not the life you want
What answers do you need
Want everything up front

Such turbulence such turbulence
Won't go away silence never stays
And such sympathies such sympathies
Will never fade some are never made

Never made

All living is
All knowing
Or so you thought
But it's never been the same

When your way is the only way
You can't look at yourself and say
'I was wrong'
You've got the head of the king on the body of a pawn

Is this all the result
Of conflict

You know that we're not all so different
We share the same space or find a better place
And I'd give I'd give anything if this would all stop
Let me walk away
