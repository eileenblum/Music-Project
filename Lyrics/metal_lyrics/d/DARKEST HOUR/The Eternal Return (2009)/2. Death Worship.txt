I'm in denial of existence drifting over to the other side
Of an endless horizon
Crossed out and driven by desire
Feeding the fire until
O death pull me closer to your cold embrace
With such grace you keep driving the same stake
Straight through the heart
And I can't stop from always thinking
This is not our time and not our place
A notorious devotion to the blood of the earth
Rushing back to your head
Now we all
Pay our respects to the oncoming fall
Bow before
The dead memory of the reoccurred
O death pull me closer to your cold embrace
With such grace you keep driving the same stake
Straight through the
Heart of us all
And we are the fall
So don't reach out your hands
In this false promised land
Over and over, over and over
Again with the promise of an end coming closer
Fate is disguise
It's the ultimate lie of life
Yeah fate is disguise
It's the ultimate lie
