There is no turning back
From all the confines of regret
Reminders of that day will haunt you
Nights you never slept
And every time you separate the body from the mind
And look into yourself and see what you've left behind

It's something you salvage through and pick the bones
It's something you'll never stop searching for
It's a self made misery
It's a blatant blasphemy

But all we need is a little transcendence to mend us
But all we have is sedation that numbs all our senses

The farther out you make it
Beyond the absolute
Onto another level can't take anything with you

So calm for a split second before you
Reconnect with the storm

It's something you salvage through and pick the bones
It's something you'll never stop searching for
It's a self made misery
It's a blatant blasphemy

But all we need is a little transcendence to mend us
But all we have is sedation that numbs all our senses

It's a self made misery
But you write your own history

I wanna peel back this layer
Reveal my new skin to the open air
I feel a cleansing wash over me
And I'm finally able to breathe

All we need is a little transcendence to mend us
But all we have is sedation that numbs all our senses
Transcendence to mend us
