There's no salvation
In a world where you worship your reflection
And no redemption for a life of servitude
You bow and you heed
On hallowed command
Your holy land is all rot and reeking
It's a safe place
A hollow escape
A palace of concrete and glass
Keep waiting, keep waiting for

No god to release you
No god to make you fall to your knees

There's blood on these pages
And a war inside your head and with yourself
Through the ages through every form of hell
It's a safe place
A hollow escape
A palace of concrete and glass
Keep waiting, keep waiting for

No god To consume you
No god To bear your burden
No god To use you
No god no it's all an illusion

A usurper of life
It'll bleed every last drop And it'll suck all the breath out of you
And leave you forsaken

There's no god to release you
There's no god to make you fall down to your knees
There's no god to consume you
There's no god To bear your burdens
There's no god no it's all an illusion.
