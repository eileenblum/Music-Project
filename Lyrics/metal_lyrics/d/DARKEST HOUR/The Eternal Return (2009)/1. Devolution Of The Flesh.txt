This is the end of a sickening tale
Of life death and repeat
Radiant waves of dissonant ways
Set forth through the halls of refrain
You're a plague, you're plague
And you feed off the youth but it won't keep you young
You're a plague, you're plague
And your prophets are gone
And you harbor your share of the blame
Put on the same face again with no hope
Another day in this solemnest state
Swallows its tail, destroys and creates
Sinking deep with the weight of the world
Unrelenting and stale
Suffer each day as we've fallen out of hate
And now you've drained every last drop of sincerity
You're a plague, you're a plague
In this mortal world and the next
You're a plague
This is the end of your self absorbed dominion
A new dawn has risen
Solitude and its dull light will guide you
Through living this day again and again and again
Suffer each day as we've fallen out of hate
And now you've drained every last drop of sincerity
You're plague, you're plague
And you feed off the youth but it won't keep you young
You're a plague, you're plague
And I'm sick with disgrace
In an age of decay
You're a plague
