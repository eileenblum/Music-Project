If I only knew why red rivers flow,
Away from a life in torment,
I can't conceive why a glorified lifestyle like this is so appealing,
Why are there no other choices?
Why do we feel this is how we need to survive?
If I only knew why death surrounds,
I can't conceive your reasoning,
If I only knew what will be left,
Shattered hopes and dreams,
Your excuse is unacceptable,
I can't relate to what you have to say
