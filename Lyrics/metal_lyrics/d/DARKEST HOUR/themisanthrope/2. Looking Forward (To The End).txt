Swimming through a false consciousness,
Looking for an answer,
Waiting for it to come to me,
I can't see forward in this world of darkness,
A veil of pain covers my eyes,
Waiting for it to come to me,
Waiting aimlessly,
I wish this world would be over,
But my wishes are obsolete,
In this world of beginnings,
I'm looking forward to the end,
Images appear from nothing,
Grasp for life,
Grasp for air.
