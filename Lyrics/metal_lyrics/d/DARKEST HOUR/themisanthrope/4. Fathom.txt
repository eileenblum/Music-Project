Tear heart from flesh,
Blood stains canvas,
Delve into darkness,
Cannot fathom life,
To scared to fathom death,
As venom slowly poisons,
Paralysis sets in,
Stiff and lifeless,
Pain begins to sear the mind,
To sear the mind,
Drawn and quartered by anguish,
Stench of impurity,
Embellished within addiction,
Drown in the depths of cleansing waters,
Claw and scrape,
Through darkened walls,
Flesh and mind lapse into one,
Victim of vice.
