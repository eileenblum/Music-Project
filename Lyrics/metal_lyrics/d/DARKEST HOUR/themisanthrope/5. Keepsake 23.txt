In darkness only to see the light shines brighter now,
Stripped from the life long before your time,
Sands of time slowly blown away,
Innocence is laid to rest,
Ashes smolder ashes from the fire that once charred life,
Life is laid to rest,
Ashes smolder from the fire that once charred life,
Sleep eternal sleep,
Rest eternally,
Arctic winds solidify,
As purity now torn,
Silent never to sleep again,
Silent,
Sleep eternal sleep,
Memories turn into sleepless nights,
Soaked with sweat,
Gasp for air,
Pain swept away by darkness,
Clouds blacken the sky as rain falls,
Forevermore,
As body lies in darkness,
Soul walks among eternity,
Behold salvation from humanity,
Unbound by earthly insanity.
