Overcome the evils trapped within,
Break free from the shackles that bind,
Blood pulses through my veins as I destroy the weakness and impurity within my soul,
Fracture the innocence,
Break free from the trap,
That binds my arms,
My legs,
My soul regain the strength that once was lost,
Look into light once more,
As I free myself from the pain.
