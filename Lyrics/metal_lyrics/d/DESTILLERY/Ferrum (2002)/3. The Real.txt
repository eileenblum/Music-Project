Replace me to the deep blue sea
Where a breeze touches my skin and my heart listens
To the wind
Back in pain, the reality I wake up open my eyes
Go numb, cat's got my tongue

The pain and torture is back again
I feel like fire burns my skin
Sleepless night where is the sin
Change of success deep from within
This is the real
My heart is full of envy
This is the real
There is the day of reckoning

See one time what my heart will reveal
Feel the real honesty
One moment to this
