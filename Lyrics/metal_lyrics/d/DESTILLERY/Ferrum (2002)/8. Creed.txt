A part of me is lonely
Hard hours for me
Mustrust, mistake and mistbelieve
No matter when I'm dreaming
The forlorn ego is sleeping
What's the creed what's the sense

Disclose the creed in the depth of thoughts
The crystal night is coming soon
I cannot feel what is real what's my creed what's my sense

A new machine is growing
Human nature only
Digitalized we are
Reflect of the intentions
Really no dimensions
Your frightened face reflects on me
Still search for the creed and for the sense
My body stiffens I feel tense
Do you search for the light
