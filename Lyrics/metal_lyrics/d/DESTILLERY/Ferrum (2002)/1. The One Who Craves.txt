Crying woman in silver garment
Won't you tempt me to surrender
A candle burns to save my soul
Gloomy thoughts I deify at all
Funereal winds came with the fall

Released from pain released from grief
The last thing I would ever see
With pale eyes of a dying man
A coward I've always been
The whole life, trouble with sense
Gloomy thoughts deify at all

A silent angel with a cosmic shine
Dozes deep in my heart
I try to conquer my mind
If you can't wake him up, never fall never stop
