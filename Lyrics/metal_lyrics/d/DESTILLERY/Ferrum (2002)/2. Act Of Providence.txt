Mournful haze surrounds my soul
Trap-doors open I fall
Beyond redemption I know
Feel the time, I feel it's time

Then I will take the black of a crow
My heart doesn't beat understands the sorrow
Feel the waste of time
Act of providence, rayless, waste of time

For nights to end in uncertainty
Pain eats you from inside
Beyond redemption you know
Feel the time, you feel it's time
