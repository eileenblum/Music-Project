Shadows devour the innocence
I can't pretend and fight against it
We have to run but times going on
And I still adore the immortal sun

Borne along by the fierce current
The dreamwheel is turning, I can't pretend
Borne along by the fierce current
Fit in the vortex the favoured end

Can't longer stand against the stream
Is it my purpose to suffer the pain
Counting the hours my patience is arrest
The heaven in crimson the place where I rest
