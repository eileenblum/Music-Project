See the dawning of tides
Search for a reason
Feel the hate collide
Search for a reason

Walking through eternal fields
Mood of silence has broken me
Contempt head over heels
Start the attack

Take the bite out of
The scorn inside yourself
In the mood of silence
Think about the past
Take the bite out of
The scorn inside yourself
Only call to arms
Against temptress of death

Regret the dead waking up the morning after
Hope to be released under a brave new star
