Time stands still all-out
I'm lying here forevermore
I must confess I must be dead
Soon I will give up my quest
Don't remind me now
Because it mostly sleeps in you
For seven days and seven nights
Slumber closes my eyes

Pray what a sorcerer calls
Asking what the future holds

Old ancient rites
Death is my bride - tonight
Time cannot hold the loss of hope
My bloods running cold
Is there a time I will be reborn
Get a flashback fall in scorn
As far as my thoughts redound
My tendency
Back to the unknown

Back to the unknown
Safe, I will close my eyes
I represent the world of lies
Back to the unknown
My prestige is up-to-date
In my own virtual fate

The world stand still right now
It's time to represent the lies
Heaven casts a cloud on you
Look through the system I will despise
Stroke of fate, the punishment
Remember there's a price to pay
In my own virtual fate
Tribute the fear, tribute the day
