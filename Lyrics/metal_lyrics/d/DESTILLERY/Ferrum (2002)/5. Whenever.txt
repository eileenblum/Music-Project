The storm is full of anger
Strong as fire in the wind
The clouds line up in heaven
It is time time to understand

Fight the prophecy of darkness
But nothing's changed at all
Expressions are eternal
Who can catch my fall
Tears flow over my cheek
Say more than I can tell
Think it's time the lies are gone
But life still carries on

Rest in a cage of time
Paint a picture on a wall
Expressions from within
Desperations let us fall
Nothing's changed at all
And live still carries on

Words seem unspoken
Iron thoughts embrace
What is the destination
Cut to the chase
Whenever the lies are over
Obnoxious grief comes to the end
Release me from suffer
Receive me in your hand

The eternal lies are stolen by the wind
Resurrection: the temptation of the coming end
