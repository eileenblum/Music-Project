Ashes to ashes
Did you ever ask yourself
If there is good or bad
Devils grimace smells like sulphur and gas
Your soul drifts away
And you're lost

Dust to dust
In what do we trust
When the sun and the sky blackened
Centuries passed by
Like a bird in flight
To the sorcery of the shadow lands

If there's a god
What would you ask him face to face
Thunder, storm and wind in a burning
World of darkness
My frightened face reflected to each other
Confusions will be born
Can't you feel the tears in my heart
Are you take me to heaven

If there's a god
The devil would curse my soul
And the angels of heaven spread their wings
And fight

Feelings crucified
Dark shadows in the night
Did you ever ask yourself
If there is a light
