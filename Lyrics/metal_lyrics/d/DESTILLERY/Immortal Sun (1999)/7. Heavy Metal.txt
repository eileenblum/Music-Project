I', zooming aimless through the times
Icy winds that once passed by
Forgotten dreams to the union of confusions
They're part of my life and heavy metal

Anthems sound in metal style
The journey ending for a while
For metal fantasies
And the breath of freedom share
Take the rulers everywhere
For metal fantasies

Mystic illusions crossed my way
Anger kisses day by day
Try to catch the light on the horizon
Follow me into my tomb
