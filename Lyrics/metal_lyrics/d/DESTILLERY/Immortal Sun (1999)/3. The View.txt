Open your eyes
And watch what's happen right ahead
Try to run it's endless time
Sentenced to life convicted to die
Where the path will be shattered

The mirror watching every pace
So stand your ground it's face to face
Ask myself if I could stand
I'm the heir of what is mine
See my views of space and time
Always found a way

Another sunrise and down is fading
You brought me to this place of cold
A voice from beyond I never walked so far
It's time that time should soar
