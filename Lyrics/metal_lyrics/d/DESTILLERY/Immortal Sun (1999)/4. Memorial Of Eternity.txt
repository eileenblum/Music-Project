Seasons are changing from joy to agony
Mournful heartbeats blood frozen deep inside me
Memories of childhood return into my head
All senses of sorrow cover my soul

Thunder and lightning attend my destiny
It my time is over what remain of me
Purple haze down in the dark like my name right in your heart
All senses of sorrow until I die

Never-ending prayers
Never dying days in the dark
Your day began under the immortal sun of glory
Like demon's eyes a night so crystal and clear
If your time is right for the immortal night have no fear
