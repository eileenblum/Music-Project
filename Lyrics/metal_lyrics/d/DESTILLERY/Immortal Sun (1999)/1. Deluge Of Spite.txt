Take care in silent moments
When all stars shine down on you
And silver moonlights too
A perturb breath of heaven
Sources of fear arise in you
The wind is fresh and cold

A statue cruel and wanted
Dreadful noise approaches to you
Fear juts in the night
Thoughts pulsate in your head
Keep me alive and save my soul
Fear juts in the night

Fellow or anger
Squander your time
Better surrender the deluge of spite

Morbid motives day dreams from within
Death row for all victims, rather humble and mean
Creature of pain, what's up in you

Fellow or anger
Squander your time
Better surrender the deluge of spite
