Desire is raging like the storm treats the sea
Rise as high as the sun veneration began
My heartblood is freezing
When the nights surrounding me
My flesh and blood longs to stray
Just hesitate when time melts away

Among the light I run and chase
Hurting words abashed this place
Injustice drawn seems so real
Stand for your right and be a man
Don't suppress all that you can
That's the pride of the mourner

Lonely in the sense of time
Kneeling depressed
In front of the shrine
I'll be waiting for a sign
Dark prediction from a hill
I believe with iron will
Always lose both there's a time
I'm gonna get you
