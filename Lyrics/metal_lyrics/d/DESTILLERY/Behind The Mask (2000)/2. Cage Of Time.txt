See the world with different eyes
Some see the truth and some the lies
Observe the darkness and the light
From the cage of iron times

Prisoned on a metal star
Progress comes where human beings are
Live together in a cage of time
Defend against all throes of death

Our time is coming closer
Indication outer space
The orbit is instable
All achievements are in blaze

Unfold oneself, oneself regress
Cycle rules we must confess
Cannot resist against the
Cage of time
Defect a sign
