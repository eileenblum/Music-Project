I don't leave a trace in the sand
I never breathe the air that you spend
Beyond the walls of cold denial
I'm watching you in dust and time
Down there among the ruined bridge
I wait for you to come

Flames of the past burning strong
My journey has come to an end
As I drown in the rivers of oblivion
It's the destiny that takes
Our masks away
Down there among
The ruined bridge
I wait for you to come

Down there
I'm waiting for you
I'll wait forevermore
I'm still there
When you are gone
