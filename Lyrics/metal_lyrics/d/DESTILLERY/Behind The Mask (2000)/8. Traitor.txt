Betray your race thoughtless
Descent of your kind
I'm a witness of a na?ve
Space and time
Beware of the justice
I believe and have no doubt
Your mercy for today
Is not allowed

It's hard to understand
Your deception
Confide my secrets to you
Chemical chain reaction
Perhaps freak out too

Deepening of healthy visions
Poised stand of your bust
The gratitude to the end
Breach of some one's trust
