I've no idea that evil lies in wait for you and me
You catch the side of his second face
Out of control not even your body and your soul come to rest
Envy and hate sadden your mind

Carry all the consequences
You are standing on the edge

My confirmed ignorance
For your desperate revenge

If brothers or sisters acquittance
And relations will always
Stand with you in a place
Maybe you discover as insidious

Carry all the consequences
You are standing on the edge

My confirmed ignorance
For your desperate revenge
