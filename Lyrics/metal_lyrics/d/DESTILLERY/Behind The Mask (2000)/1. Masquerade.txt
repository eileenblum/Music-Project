Another heart days perforates the slander
Another time look up to the renegade
Despise the bastard exclude or isolate
Wake up and lift your masquerade

Welcome to the ball of thousand faces
Welcome to the world of the prejudiced
Your present-day it's never too late
Woke up and lift your masquerade

To the end of the millennium
Seek refuge with safety
Your contempt doesn't follow me
To a star with dignity

Present an example of impartiality
Us living in a kingdom with lack of concern
Gore the harm of human kind
Satan governs you beside
