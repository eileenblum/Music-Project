The legends about Atlantis the forgotten continent
Be ruined in the ocean
Drag along a dozen events of a prehistoric time
A kingdom unmolested

In noon the sun is in zenith abandoned in a
Scene of dreams be engaged in something
Perhaps a pungent atmosphere a little scare
A little fear failure of doom, see the truth

Kingdom of the damned
Reincarnate
A legend or a lie?
The myth never dies

Revelation guides the final round
Plead to the folls kneel on the ground
Fear will come closer
A tidal wave the land is torn
The combat's lost a legend's born
The truth of presume inundated?
