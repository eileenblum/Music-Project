Everlasting, evermore
Monotonous daily life before
Think about the evolution of machines
Most are useful, some cruel and mean

They erase all bad souls
Like ticking time bombs
Take control

They escort us to eternity
Mankind seems defeated
Expired by technology
I feel the control by a new machine

Every night the stars are bright
No train of thoughts, a quiet course
The moonset shine, a cold wind blows
But every day the progress grows

They erase all souls and take control
