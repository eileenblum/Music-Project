Many times where I don't
Know what I am
Reduce me to reality
Like a heavy rock in the surf
Thoughts surround my brain

Back to the ground of facts
What has happened to me
Indistinct, intolerant, impenetrable
Are the walls of my thoughts

Satan's tears inflamed the cry
Between my thoughts
And the dark side
Try to toil and catch the light
My dive stopped
Returns my pride

One step forward
With the experience attack
Now I'm back and alive
Self assured, resolved
I can break the walls
Of my thoughts
