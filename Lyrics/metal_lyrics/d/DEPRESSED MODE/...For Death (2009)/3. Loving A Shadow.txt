Inside my thoughts
I can remember you

You look at the open window
As the curtains move like the wind that is blowing

Inside my thoughts
I can remember you

Forever lost in your eyes
Forever thought that you're mine
Forever lost in your eyes
Forever thought that you're mine

Nothing you say can return us
to the beauty that we once had
Nothing you do can replace this
insane sorrow in our moments

How can I feel so confused?
Am I losing myself?
Can't you see I'm not here?
It's my shadow

This silence again, it makes me insane
Hear whispers in me, again and again

These painful memories
Of a life that never meant to be
Was erased by those who couldn't see
The beauty, the meaning

Inside my thoughts
I can remember you

Forever lost in your eyes
Forever thought that you're mine
Forever lost in your eyes
Forever thought that you're mine
