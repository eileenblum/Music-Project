The touch of your hand on my face
felt like heaven I have suffered for many decades
Without a single moment of tranquillity
The distant heart of mine
felt many hits by this blade
called loneliness and shame

In loneliness I died
I witnessed the death of my soul
Your scent was left behind
Darkness came and took me away

I was lost
Forever I was lost

Your heart felt the fire inside, it burns
You beg for hell to bring back what's mine

In loneliness I died
I witnessed the death of my soul
Your scent was left behind
Darkness came and took me away

I was lost

One memory for you to remember me
This dagger of fire shows me the meaning of blood

Your heart felt the fire inside, it burns
You beg for hell to bring back what's mine
