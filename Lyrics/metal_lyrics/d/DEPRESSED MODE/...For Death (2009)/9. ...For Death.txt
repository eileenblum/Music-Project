All this time I've been gone
All this time I've been left to die

For my death you discover
a bitter and deadly scent

The scent of venom
The scent of venom

In my veins can't be stopped
And the will to live is gone

For my death you discover
a bitter and deadly scent

The scent of venom
The scent of venom
