A ghastly whisper runs through my spine
a glimpse of tomorrow

A sigh of sorrow
a sigh of death

These tears are made for me to shed

I shiver, I died for you

Slowly dying, she's rotting
Slowly rotting, she's decayed

A sad figure lingers towards
she's crying for her lost
I can't help you, I have nothing to say
You're dying

She is dying
Slowly dying
She's rotting
Slowly rotting, she's decayed
A ghastly whisper runs through my spine
a glimpse of tomorrow

A sigh of sorrow
a sigh of death

These tears are made for me to shed

I shiver, I died for you
