In this land of thousand of thousand skies
This land of promises
Your every nightmare is about to come true now
A dream of pain, a sea of blood in this endless tunnel

Nothing for my eyes to see
All blurring for my sight
never felt the breeze
at my eyes

This tunnel of pain
This eternity in vain

You felt the touch of coldness on your skin
never felt the breeze lingering on my neck

This old man with a face of death
comes to me and says

Born of anger, died for flesh
now is time for me to rest

In this land of thousand of thousand skies
This land of promises
Your every nightmare is about to come true now
A dream of pain, a sea of blood in this endless tunnel

This tunnel of pain
This eternity in vain
