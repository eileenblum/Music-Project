For ages this madness
has driven me to death

In nighttime my soulless carcass awaken
Her whispers in the air will turn my dreams into reality

Searching forever, I don't want her to be found
To the rest of them, I wish, that their souls will shiver

In nighttime my soulless carcass awaken
Her whispers in the air will turn my dreams into reality

I cannot see the beauty found in me
Your cold touch made me spin in a frozen merry-go-round

Searching forever, I don't want her to be found
To the rest of them, I wish, that their souls will shiver

Killing forever, I don't want her to be found
To the rest of them, I wish, that their souls will be bound

Be found In hell

In nighttime my soulless carcass awaken
Her whispers in the air will turn my dreams into reality
