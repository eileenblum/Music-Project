Silence, all is gone
Just the whispers, in the air
No one will find the way, words of silence
Through a better day, Words of death

Your Death
Inspires me
To write something beautiful.
No one will find the way, words of silence
Through a better day, Words of death

These words of silence, those words make me suffer
Your image burns in my mind, I embrace those dead memories,
Memories

So cold
So quiet
You made me cry
Embodyment of wind
Embodyment of silence
Words of silence
Words of death

These words of silence, those words make me suffer
Your image burns in my mind, I embrace those dead memories,
Memories
