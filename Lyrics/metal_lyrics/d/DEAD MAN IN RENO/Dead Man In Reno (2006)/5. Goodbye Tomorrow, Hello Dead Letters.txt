The sky is falling through the heart of his name.
A thousand faces at rest by my side and a city that lies in ruin.
Behead the courtship to show them that I'm defeated by the sun, in reverence at the sight of a thousand faces.
Our eyes will pray for us, give us life, a chance to right our wrongs before we die.
Like I said the sky is falling, to form a puzzle in pieces from the clouds, yea.
