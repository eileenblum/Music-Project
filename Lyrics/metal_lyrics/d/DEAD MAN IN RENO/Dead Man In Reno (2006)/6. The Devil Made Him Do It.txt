How can I live forever an angel with demon wings.
Dear mistress I'm afraid it's not as pleasing as I'd like to hear.
Burn my wings to fetch a kiss from this maiden, I still remember her lips so sweet their tainted kiss, loveless, my heart is dead.
This is the last time the curse of my own flesh the love and her disdain...
This drifting heart has finally sailed and taken it's toll on me, and my heart will never heal.
So the lonely hearts are drifting further out towards me because I'm buried at sea.
