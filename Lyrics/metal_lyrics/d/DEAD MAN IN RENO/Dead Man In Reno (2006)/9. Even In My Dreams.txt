Now do your dance and sing a song for us for when in Rome sing a song without words.
Oh god open the seas for even in my dreams she dies beside me in a lake underground with plastic lighting.
I gave my kingdom to a queen in time I shed my, my blessing of love.
Blue rose adorn a field of snow her eyes gaze at white stallions in the sky.
