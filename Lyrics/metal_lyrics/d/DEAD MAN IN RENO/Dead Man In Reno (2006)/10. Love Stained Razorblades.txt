Rip out my heart, now give it back, cold blood runs down my hands and I can't believe.
Love song never you better think opposite there you are close my eyes smell your scent I can't believe.
Beauty fades for you now these scars tell tales of a love once lost.
A harlot's arrow tore my heart pastels paint the picture perfectly.
Lies.
Now the sky muffles the sight to my peace.
