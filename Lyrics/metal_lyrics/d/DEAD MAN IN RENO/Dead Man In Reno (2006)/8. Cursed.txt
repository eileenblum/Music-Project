As long as I can sustain the memory of her an image cursing my name belittles my starved heart.
I hope you enjoyed the time you spent butchering me with those murderous conversations my exposed heart was yours yet you'd deny it.
These lies will find a means to an end in dreams where they die.
So beautiful a lifeless body without a soul, I guess it was just time for you to go in this desperation it seems I've found nothing at all.
As the days went by the skies turned from pale to bright just for my eyes.
The sky opens and blood pours from these eyes into vessels of your mind.
I'll take your head and carve out the eyes, burning the rest of you.
Ashes to ashes.
