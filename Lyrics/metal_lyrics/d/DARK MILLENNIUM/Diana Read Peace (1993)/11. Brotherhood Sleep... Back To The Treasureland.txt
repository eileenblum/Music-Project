I am scared to breath you name
whenever we dissove to blame;
but one day we will learn to fly
back to treasureland.
Somewhere someone investigates
we appeal to our experince;
this inner worth is inner war
we're longing the colors
as if we'd starve...

Still in perigee
still in liberty.
Still in reach
still in me.

Oh so red the cage
the seizure is my guard
and leader never I have been
in such a warmth before.
Oh so silent sleeps the planet
healers, are you near
I need another vision
I can trust and feed.
We are the dead dead ringers
we are in search of our birth.
