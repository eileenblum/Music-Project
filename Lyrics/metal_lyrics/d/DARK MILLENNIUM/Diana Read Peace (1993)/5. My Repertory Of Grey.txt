Rearing the look from the sun
I would never know the latest
day I woke up in the cold broke
that I promised, fading away, my light.
Tell me, my repertory, if this will last
what more they want my pride to give
and why - I ask you why am I the only figure kept alive.
They had to do what was to do and did what in the mind
of a force known as the sense of man got banned and mystified...
So lead me back, my repertory of grey where I belong
and never can be in possibility to lose my weight,
my inner peace, my way and when you, my repertory,
ever will turn from grey to freedom I forget,
I will forget my fault
my fault, my very fault...
