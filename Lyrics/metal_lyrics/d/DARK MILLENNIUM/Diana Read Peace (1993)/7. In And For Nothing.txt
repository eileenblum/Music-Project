In the circle deep
lost me in this gold, gold black
a strong arm in these weak days just
an inner wish to be forgotten...
See, the ships are sailing
They sail without a sea;
And still Jesus is praising
he speaks with no need to breathe...
In my worlds I claim nothingness to be
and pictures awake and grow in me.
What is left to expect?
Where's to go to look at?
Gallows for sale, just follow the stench of my sweat.
You in my mouth, did you really believe you were safed?
'Swopped blood for blood,
'snuffed mud for mud
'shook hands with the boys of the underworld.
The last in the inside of my outside
did you really believe you were safed?
