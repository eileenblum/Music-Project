You dive into sleep
find roses under the door, they seem
to speak in trance of youth;
"femember who you swore to chose, girl..."
I am dead, dead in love
I am pale, pale enough
To be dead, death I got
dead in love.
There may be a sky
could be a sign for me to rise
but without blood an energy
I sand my brain weves, possibly
they find their aim.
Death I got...
You float into sourness
infected by my bite you crawl
down in my castle where the beasts
lie in my arms and smile so sweet.
I am dead, dead in love
I am pale, pela enough
tio be dead, daeth I got
Dead in love.
