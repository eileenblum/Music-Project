"In an earlier age Pandemonium - the first city of hell -
stood on a lava mountain while lightning tore
the clouds above it and beacons burned on its walls
to summon the fallen angels"
- Clive Baker, 'The Damnation Game'

Travel through space
so ghostly withers the void;
the veil of spheres my hands
they search for hold world of spirits.
A sea of rooms, a forest of nothing
where a soul wanders imploring for substance...
Decifer the majesty Leviathan.
