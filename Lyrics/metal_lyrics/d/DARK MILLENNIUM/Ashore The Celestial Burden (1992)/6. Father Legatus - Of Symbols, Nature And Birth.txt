Is that what I seem to see a conceit,
An insight in occurrences to ascertain the sun
Father knowledge, lead my way...
The beauty of the constitution
Begets a craving for the search
The doctrine is bewitched
By the whispering of... god?

"Follow your spirit to infinity."

Release my lungs from breath
Banish the holy vow I made
Robbed vitality
Vaporous nature, scowling eyes...

Mortem peragrare
On and on, into voodoo-cult.

Living through the new born pain
Of time and history
Dimensions burn their hateful signs
On my defenceless skin.
The voice I obeyed unsuspecting
Belongs to death himself
Woeful cries, shrouded in secrecy.

I will feel the frost again,
There's no end but endless pain;
Darkness, show me your disguise
Omnipresent sin.

Father, honour's lost its worth
Being is a lie;
Segment of unconscious fear
Father... widespread black you'll find

As you pulse, again and again
In the different hells
In the myriads
Of your mind
Pulse...

Bury my soul in the ash of the candles you light.
