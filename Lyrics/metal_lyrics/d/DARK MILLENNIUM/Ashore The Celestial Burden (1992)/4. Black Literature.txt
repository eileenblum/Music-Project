"Welcome to the reign of the ashes
Welcome to the hunt.
Welcome to the master's palace,
Welcome home, my son..."
A secret lies forbidden
I'm trapped in dismal thoughts
An unknown reign is hidden
Prevailed by unknown lords.

Don't pray to images of other Gods,
An order I was taught.
Seclude my memories of the past,
When legends had been told.

The book of blood has prophesied
The return of death on earth;
The sky turns black as I realise
What my religion is worth.

Absorbed in hellish thoughts... Black literature.
The Bible is lost... Black literature.

Reinstatement, of my senses,
I believe in Jesus Christ.
Reawakening, of the vengeance
I will devastate his might.

Put the beast to the tempter

Dismembered is my innocence,
Damned is my belief.
I see the unbelievable,
I feel its dreadful heat.

I damn the day when I was born,
A child - Wrath in his veins;
Confronted with strategic lies,
That slowly filled my brain.

A scriptural passage dies... Black literature.
Awaiting the arise - Of God?

A scenery of feelings,
False freedom in my heart.
No hope, no chance of healing
Happiness is past.

Reinstatement, of my senses,
I believe in Jesus Christ.
Reawakening of the vengeance
I will devastate his might.

Religion is a curse... Black literature.
Defending my belief... Black literature.
