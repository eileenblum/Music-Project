Burning's the horizon of your mind drifting down
When the other side's marked its path.
See what the unknown's concealed for your fate
When the oracle lays down his masked.

Flying through the dragon's eye
To hear the secret speak;
Red clouds fill the crumbling sky
Forgotten times you seek.

Where has it gone,
He key to unknown lands.
In circles you roam,
Hold your fortune in your hands...
Never-ending maze,
Filled with pleasure, filled with pain
Take the chalice served for you,
Let you senses drain.

Approach to his domain,
A new life's to be born;
Far from human sanity,
Far from heavens door.
Keep the torches lit
The fire that makes you be...
Bright light, darkened night
Reign of immortality.

Reflections of the past,
No truth will ever last
Choirs of doom.

Dance with the dead
Through rivers of red
Will all end soon?

Nothing now remains
Of the key to unknown lands,
Marching through the void,
Feel the menace with your hands;
Lords of thunder
Down crushing flash...
The oracle is silent
And your torches turn to ash.

Stare into the dragon's eye
Far away from time;
A part of the eternal mind
...Until the bell will chime.
