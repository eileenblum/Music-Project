Among the Celts lived a priesthood in ancient times
When the Romans practised justice with despite.
The people asked its riddling members for their advice
And for their imagination of life.

Enter the depths of history
And follow the traces of the druids;
Listen to the speech of mystery
And let the wind tell the truth.

Secrecy prepared their way into the promised land
Spiritual meetings were denied.
Conspiracy of sacred Christ's concluded soon their end
Dismemberment of others deify...

Wizardry and mystic rites
Assemble on this ground
Forgotten magics come to life
Forbidden fear is found.
The message of the druids
Is the sign for us to see:
Eternity has formed a life
That rests in our belief.

Mythology sealed the fate of these former priests
Reality taught us to forget.
But, tell me why wants my thoughts me to search for more
Why is my mind filled with regret?

Secluded life - Where do you rest,
I pray for your arise.
Dismal oath, descant your death
And ban the pagan rites...

Deviltry can't stop my way into the promised land
Historical places I will reach.
Witchery won't break my aim to end this ignorance
Eternal tribute I receive.

Wizardry and mystic rites
Assemble on this ground
Forgotten magics come to life
Forbidden fear is found.
The message of the druids
Is the sign for us to see:
Eternity has formed a life
That rests in our belief.

Fragment...
Deep in the past you vouch for the truth.
Possession...
Praising the words of the unbroken spell.
Deny...
Submitting the doubt that grows out of the visions.
Curse God...
Deceive the apostles' yell.

Hear the speech of mystery,
Burning down to history.
Obey,
Prepare for their return
Don't break the oath.
Not a lie,
Not a sin
It's the birth of origin
Destiny will rape the pride
Testify your pride.

Testify your pride.
