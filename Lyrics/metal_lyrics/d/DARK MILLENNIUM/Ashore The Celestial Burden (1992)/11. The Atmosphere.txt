Follow the raven to the edge of belief
Leave the thoughts of paradise in the seclusion of the mind.
Past and life so far behind
The walls that pass our way to mystery.

Tear the air with a look.
Don't deny the signs, see his eyes,
Feel the to dream - Hooked

The atmosphere is meant to last forever.
Destination lies... unknown.
Nailed within the labyrinth of harmony's disgust,
Never heard, never seen, never found.

Welcome to the funeral pile, take my soul
Lay to rest a reborn time.
Have you seen those who failed and returned to devastate
Our thoughts of a forbidden paradise...

The birth of a child wakes impulses in my blind
pale emotions, and the labyrinth
We hide is knocking at the gate,
Messiah and the fate
See the changes - The fear - The
Pentagram on my skin.

Unbind the fog.
Man is guilty, pain is done.

Escaping from destiny
In the twilight of the sky.
The dragon received
What is mine by right.

Tear the air with a look.
Don't deny the signs, see his eyes,
Feel the hope to dream - Hooked

The atmosphere is sentenced to deliver.
Bitterness will fall and hope will rise.
Born within the fire of a dying reign of dust
In his heart, in his soul, in his eyes...
