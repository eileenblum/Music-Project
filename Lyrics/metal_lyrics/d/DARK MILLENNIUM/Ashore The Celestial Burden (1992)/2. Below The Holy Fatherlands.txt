In a lost dark world beyond eternity
Where phantasm has its origin
Where the shadows hunt the light
And no god enforces might
Lies the sin, the painful sin.

From the clouds above my eyes
Drop the tears that lead the way
To the entry of the hidden
Wither knowledge takes my brain...

Lead me to the kingdom of depths
Where silence is a form of life;
The day of decision recalls my thoughts
And prepares my mind to die.

Rising spirit baptises winds of
Foreign existence, black times' cry
Hills as a fragment of ancient breath and
As signs for the place where the ruins may hide.

In the centre of forbidden
Thoughts we meet and will defy
And the shadows will appear and
Their eyes will stand the fear
In the unknown reigns of darkened unknown lives...

Lead me to the kingdom of depths
Where silence is a form of life;
The day of decision recalls my thoughts
And prepares my mind to die.

The horror lives... below the holy fatherlands.
