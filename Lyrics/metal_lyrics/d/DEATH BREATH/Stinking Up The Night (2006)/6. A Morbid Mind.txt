Every night now
He speaks to me
Vog Sothoth in my mind
Must not be unleashed
With every restless dawn
I'm getting weak
Open up and let me out
He whispers to me

Haunted at night in my dreams
Waking up to hear my screams
Clear my head must be strong
Still I feel him gain control

Insomnia wrack my brain
Resistance futile
Slowly driving me insane
I cannot recall
How I got this ill
All I feel now
Is the need to kill

Haunted at night in my dreams
Waking up to hear my screams
Clear my head must be strong
Still I feel him take control

Every night
He speaks to me
Open up let me out
And so I did

Haunted at night in my dreams
Waking up to hear my screams
Clear my head must be strong
Still I feel him take control

Haunted at night in my dreams
Waking up to hear my screams
Mind's a mess can't be strong
Yog Sothoth's in control
