Covered in caked blood
My heart's filled with dread
As most of my buddies
Are already dead

Covered in muck and piss
A medic pumps my chest
I'm slipping into the abyss
This ditch is my final rest

Dying in this mud
Surrounded by ruins
And thousands of dead
And who will mourn my death
Final thoughts
As I choke on my last breath

Covered in sewage and shit
A medic pumps my chest
I'm slipping into the abyss
This ditch is my final rest

[lead: Pehrsson]

Covered in bile and puke
A medic pumps my chest
I'm slipping into the abyss
This trench is my final rest
