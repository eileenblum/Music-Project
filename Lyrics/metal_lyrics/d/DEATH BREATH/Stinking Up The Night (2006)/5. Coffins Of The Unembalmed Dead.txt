The dead will rise
Injections to open up their eyes
So cold
Cannibalism cannot be controlled
Craving flesh
Specimen not decomposed but fresh
From shallow graves
Tomb legions charnel and depraved

The reviving of fresh corpses
Rigor mortis in reverse
Sepulcher violator
Hijacker of the hearse

Coffins of the unembalmed dead

Body minus head
Limbless trunk twitching on a bed
Of stainless steel
At the altar of necromancy I kneel
The dead will walk
Head minus body starts to talk
In the night
Unholy invocations I recite

The reviving of fresh corpses
Rigor mortis in reverse
Sepulcher violator
Hijacker of the hearse

Coffins of the unembalmed dead
