Amidst the darkness
Out of nowhere
The disease engendering
South west wind appears

Vast epidemic
Deprived of cure
All mankind covered
In lepromatous gore

Man retch and vomit
Man heave and hurl
As demons proceed to launch
The end of the world

Priests hung by the thousands
Hell's gone to war
Christ all fucking mighty
Is mighty no more

Man is crippled by famine
Abscess and plague
The awaited Armageddon
Is coming of age

Swarms of locusts
Darkens the sky
Arch angels fight till death
And to the death they'll die

[lead: Andersson]

Man is defeated
In vain he's on his knees
Against infernal slayers
Stand helpless sick slaves

Up in heaven
On a blood red floor
Lies Christ all fucking mighty
With the Babylonian whore

[lead: Andersson]
