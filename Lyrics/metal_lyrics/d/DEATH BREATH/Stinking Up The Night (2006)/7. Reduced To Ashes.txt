Hiding deep in the dark
It's true what they say
You're insane
But you can't stop
Your morbid ways
In search of victims
To light up to dress up in flames

Guided by voices in your head
Killing to get through another day
Sanity has left your brain
Urge too strong
To see people die in flames

Holding tight
The can of gasoline
Excited now to
Hear them scream
Douse their bodies
And light the match
The stench fills the air
Another stinking success

Guided by voices in your head
Killing to get through another day
Sanity has left your brain
Urge too strong
To see people die in flames

[lead: Pehrsson]

Spilled some gas
On your sleeve
Spreading fast
No this can't be real
Eyes are melting
Your skin is scorched
Now you're nothing
But a burning human torch

Guided by voices in your head
Killing to get through another day
Sanity has left your brain
Urge too strong
To see people die in flames
