With an infernal fragrance
I stink up the night
A stench so relentless
Taking bad breath to new heights

Your stomach starts churning
Spasms caused by the smell
I stink to high heaven
Bringing you closer to Hell

Rotting
Slowly I'll put you to death
Choking
On the breeze of my death breath

You spew up when I breathe out
Sniff my bestial bouquet
You're slowly being smothered
By the foul fetor of decay

Rotting
Slowly I'll put you to death
Choking
On the breeze of my death breath

[lead: Pehrsson]
[lead: Andersson]

You're burning up with fever
From the infectious
Contents of my mouth
My decomposed mouth hole
Laughs and my festered lips pout

Rotting
Slowly I'll put you to death
Choking
On the breeze of my death breath
