The venom drips from your fangs. One drop controls you, left for the kill. Twisted words, heresy, a world of lies. Your demons will catch you on the day you die. False prophet, you lead them to the dark. Savage wolf that feasts upon your heart. Spread disease. Fill the world with your hate. Reaching for salvation, but itâs too late. Target the children, infect with weakness. Useless words leads to their doom. False prophet, you lead them to the dark. Savage wolf that feasts upon your heart. Live by your word. Nothing else matters. The page has turned. Enter the final ring of hell. Damned by your lies
