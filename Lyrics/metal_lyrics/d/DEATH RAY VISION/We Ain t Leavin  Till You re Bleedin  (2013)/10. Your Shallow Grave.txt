Walking alone, alone in a dream and nothing here is what it seems. Create a world, a world thatâs all your own, twist and distort the unknown. So contrived, the lights kept you alive. Now your wasting away. This is the real me, take it or leave it. I can stand on my own. You canât rewrite the page. Save those lost forgotten days. Only the bloodstains will remain. Bury your dreams, hide them in a shallow grave. All hope will die at the end of days. So deadly, the truth comes alive. So contrived, the lights kept you alive. Now your wasting away. This is the real me, take it or leave it. I can stand on my own.
