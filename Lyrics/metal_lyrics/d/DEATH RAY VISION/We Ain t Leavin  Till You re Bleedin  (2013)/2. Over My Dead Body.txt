Iâm afraid of my own voice. Even now it clouds my choice. Hands tied and eyes ahead. I never walk, Iâm always lead. Over my dead body, you stand and stare. Wash the blood away and vanish in the air. Iâll save my suicide for the perfect time. No one said that life was fair. Itâs not fair. Through the thinnest veil I disguise myself. Too late I realize Iâve become what I despise. So senseless, Defenseless, You donât belong. Unending, Descending, Down from your throne. Over my dead body, you stand and stare. Wash the blood away and vanish in the air. Iâll save my suicide for the perfect time. No one said that life was fair.
