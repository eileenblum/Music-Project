My face in the dirt and one foot in the grave. Save your breath, I donât want to be saved. You thought you had control, but why Iâll never know. Itâs much too late. Push through the dreadful wind and the rain. When you come out, youâll never be the same. These days of compromise, they make me realize, Iâve lived too long. And with another line, the days just seem to multiply. Can chase the sun away and hide your face. Running around with a gun at my head, Itâs no surprise all my friends end up dead. Pushed until you fell into this living hell. Itâs all my fault. And with another line, the days just seem to multiply. Can chase the sun away and hide your face. All this compromise, finally I realize that Iâve lived this life for far too long. Iâve lived too long. This tired and senseless game, it always ends the same. Keep grinding until itâs gone, Iâve been living this life too long. What did you hope to gain by losing again and again. Keep grinding until itâs gone, Iâve been living this life too long
