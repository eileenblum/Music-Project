I donât want to save the world, Iâd rather watch it burn. What did you expect to hear? Clawing, scratching, dig till you draw blood. Frantic searching for the one you thought you were. Fuck compromise, you keep the lies. A moment trapped beneath the glass. The soul collector controls your past. From the ashes we are reborn, though we struggle we keep holding. We must rebuild all that they burned, all we cherished and all we learned. Clawing, scratching, dig till you draw blood. Frantic searching for the one you thought you were. From the ashes we are reborn, though we struggle we keep holding. We must rebuild all that they burned, all we cherished and all we learned.
