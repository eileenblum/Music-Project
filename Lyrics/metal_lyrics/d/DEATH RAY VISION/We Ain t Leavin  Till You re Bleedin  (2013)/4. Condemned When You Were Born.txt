I donât know why you push everything too far. You just need to feel it burn. Youâre always running, still running from your life. Can not find balance on the edge of a knife. The cure is only temporary. Thereâs no escape from yourself. These empty eyes, withered and dead inside. These empty eyes, your dream is just a lie. Destiny is an unkind friend, Always waiting and laughing in the end. Youâre always running, still running from your life. Can not find balance, on the edge of a knife. The cure is only temporary. Thereâs no escape from yourself. These empty eyes, withered and dead inside. These empty eyes, your dream is just a lie. Pushed and pushed until you died. Could not break the cycle. You were condemned when you were born. Crave the fear. The edge of life. No escape from the killer inside.
