The night ends in defeat. Stumble down this lonely street. Darkness betrays . Light burns off the haze. Canât face another day. The empty bottleâs smashed. You know the buzz will never last. Too blind to see. Escape reality. Tonight we drown in whiskey. Tore out your eyes to believe your own disguise. Helpless and blind. Youâve wasted so much time. Wasted so much fucking time. So raise another pint to the worst night of your life. Endless nights and wasted days, only ashes will remains. So raise another pint to another losing fight. Endless nights and wasted days, all regrets are washed away. Careful what you wish for, You donât know what you want. Tore out your eyes to believe your own disguise. Helpless and blind. Youâve wasted so much time. Wasted so much fucking time. So raise another pint to the worst night of your life. Endless nights and wasted days, only ashes will remains. So raise another pint to another losing fight. Endless nights and wasted days, all regrets are washed away. Too blind to see tonight we drown in whiskey. Fuck reality, tonight we drown in whiskey.
