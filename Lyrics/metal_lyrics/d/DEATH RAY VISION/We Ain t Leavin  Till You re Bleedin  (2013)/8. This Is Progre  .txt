What is this shit we breathe? Corporate controlled disease, drain the life of everything we see. What have they done to me? Weâll never know. The dollar is their control. Too late to make you see, the rage inside of me. Home of the brave and land of the free. What have they done to me? Weâll never know. The dollar is their control. All of their lies written in the painted sky. The money helps them hide while our planet dies. We begin to count the bodies. Lay them out one by one. The blackened clouds arising blocking out the sun. Will we die or pay their price?What have they done to me? Weâll never know. The dollar is their control. All of their lies written in the painted sky. The money helps them hide, while our planet dies
