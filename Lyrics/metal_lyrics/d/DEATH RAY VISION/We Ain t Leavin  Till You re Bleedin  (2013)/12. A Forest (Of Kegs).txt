Come closer and see, see into the trees. Find the girl while you can. Come closer and see, see into the dark. Just follow your eyes. I hear her voice calling my name. The sound is deep in the dark. I hear her voice and start to run. Into the trees. Suddenly I stop, but i know itâs too late. Iâm lost in a forest, all alone. The girl was never there, itâs always the same. Iâm running towards nothing, again and again and again.
