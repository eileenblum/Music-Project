Just another pointless story, just another hidden face. Transforming at first warning, you were gone without a trace. Choke on your words. Choke on the taste. Choke on the dirt that falls into your grave. Choke on the fear. Choke on the rage. Choke on the blood of the ones you betrayed. We are falling deeper. Lost within the smoke and ash. The art of illusion. This fantasy will never last. Choke on your words. Choke on the taste. Choke on the dirt that falls into your grave. Choke on the fear. Choke on the rage. Choke on the blood of the ones you betrayed. Every life you bought and sold, every bullshit lie you told. The rope grows tight around your throat, on your words Iâll make you choke. Your life is fading, the mirror tells no lies...
