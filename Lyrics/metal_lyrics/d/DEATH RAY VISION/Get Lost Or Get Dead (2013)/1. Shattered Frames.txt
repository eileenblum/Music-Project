Ill never trust it
Ill never trust in it again
Iâve learned Iâve been burned
But I got up and walked away

With no regrets
I have always bled for you
Cold suffocation
In the form of booze and pills

Shattered frames
All you saw just falls away
Now your faith is dying

Could you believe?
Who you deceive yourself for me?
Ill be right here smiling

Cold blood has rusted
Icy fingers, dead caress
You always knew the fear was true

You never listened
never listened to yourself
No breaking out, faith is doubt

Deceiving
Twisting my mind
Believe me
Ill take your life

Could you believe?
Would you deceive yourself for me?
Ill be right here smiling

Shattered frames
All you saw just falls away
Now your faith is dying...
