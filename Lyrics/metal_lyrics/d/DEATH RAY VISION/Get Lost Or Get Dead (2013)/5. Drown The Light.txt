The whiskey saturates
And the day is renewed
You keep your guilt
Ill keep my free will

Embrace the darkness
As we watch the daylight die
Had to see this city bleed
To know that its alive

And who will you pretend to be?
Another new identity

Is this a ride
worth dying for?

Pushing forward
As the blind leads the blind
Betrayed by horror
Of the past you left behind

Iâm still crawling
On these broken knees of mine
Rain keeps falling
Drowns the light
youâll never find

And who will you pretend to be?
Another new identity
Intoxication sets you free
Driven to insanity

Watch the fire rising
Is this a ride
worth dying for?

Awaken darkness
Drown the light
