The possibilities
just pass us by again
Youâd think you would see
That life can become
all you want it to be

Ignoring the present
We live for future dreams
A prisoner of fate
Trapped between lies
Obstacles that we create

Sick of waiting for the end
Bring it down on me
Thereâs nothing left to lose
Once youâre lost

Our contempt will breed
Fueled by abandoned dreams
Even worse then it seems
We have no reasons left
to believe

A new day will dawn
If we rise to face it
We can not fail
We can not let evil prevail

Sick of waiting for the end
Bring it down on me
Thereâs nothing left to lose
Once youâre lost

We will
Rise again
The day is ours
