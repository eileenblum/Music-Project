This is the special skill of humanity to raise and fall; to construct and to destroy; to love after hate.
since the beginning, men are born to die: there's nothing else than that eternal contradiction.

... The human legend had found the path.
The race has grown from the ashes and stone.
Evolution has taken the keys of death and made home.

... And god created men to serve his purposes...
... And god forgot to silence their minds...

The anger has no force against the science.
Men had fallen; men will stand on and again.
We greed, we corrupt. we deserve defiance.
No progress will ever justify the pain.

Trail opened through the ashes and stones.
From genesis 'til chaos, this circle of life is done.
The human legend had found the path.
Saved the bones, skins have already left.
