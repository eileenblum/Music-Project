We were just born infected.
We are led to cease -- early -- our lives.
What would be the right choice?
Is it eternal life or existence without pain?

The never-ending stage of struggle
Is always renewing unfixed actors.
Life infects and leads to death, blinding the man,
Bio-violence reacting.

It's not ease to live without oppressing.
It's not ease to control without corrupt.
Why pain cannot comfort us now?

What's the limit for man marching over others?
What is he expecting and searching for?
There are men who reign while others succumb.
Both of them are living with power and despair.
