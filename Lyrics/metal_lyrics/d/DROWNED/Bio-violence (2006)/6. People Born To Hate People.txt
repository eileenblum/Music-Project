We are a death machine. we just think about destroying ourselves.
Despite our needs to live in community, we fight all the time, in an eternal route of collision.

You can kill and be human for one time.
Maybe you feel better... maybe you smile.
Or make something to lose the mind... and kill or die in a crash, into a sport car!

Breathe this air that we breathe...
Feel my sickness drown your lungs...
Our mouths squirt desires and death.
We contaminate all around our wounds.

How low you can go for to be renowned?
Make yourself things others expect.
Life is an epidemic that slowly murders!
Our instinct infects and finishes the net.

...and people need reins as the beasts! yeah!
People born to hate people!
