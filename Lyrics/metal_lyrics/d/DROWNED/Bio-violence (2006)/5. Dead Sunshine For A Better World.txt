What are we doing for our own benefit?
What is the planet we want to stand over the years?
These and more questions maybe won't have answers if we can do nothing to stop the ruin in progress.

The trigger was set in motion.
The bullet already goes on to hit the human head.
Salvation is only for the dead.
"You pray for us, the sinners, up to now and in the hour of death."

Boiling planet in the furnace of hatred, our hatred!
Let's do the kingdom of god, the land of living dead!

We're all unbelievers and tired.
No more believers in future ways, watching the last hero fail.
With promises of better days, you wrote the certain fate.
In book of the line pies, they'll pray for us with hate and wait until we die.

Dead sunshine for a better world, last light switches off for us.
Dead sunshine for a better world, our hope has lost in dark!
Dead sunshine for a better world in a dead sunshine.
