Do you really think in international efforts or nations worried about you?
The great hands of "good men" can support or smash...
Mainly smash when you are in the third world.

The human life has a new meaning. time will embrace our fate.
As a coin put in a machine we support the legion of world saviors.
They'll keep peace with force, they'll teach us how to give and share.
With heart cleaned of ambition, we chose the right hands to take away from us.

Shore of disgrace... and none can only escape.
Values fall; guidance is back until they take us.

Organize the pressure!
Seize the intervention!
Salute the oppressor!
It's innate to our nature!

The lightning will find its home.
Survivors of the last king will be slaved by the next one, missing or consuming the hope.
A shadow of progress hits the poor, with the vivid thoughts just persisting.
Divinity confined no more, stage where we will lie resisting.

Hands to shelter the whole dying race.
Our spirits are lost, vanished in decay.

The friendly oppressor... the friendly oppressor...
