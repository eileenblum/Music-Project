We are educated just to think about ourselves, just to feel and treat our own difficulties.
The world is a little part of this, nothing else is important.
Even a great evolution has its second meaning.

Walls covered of mirrors, comforting the eyes.
Your image from the mirror is the thing you find.
Jesters are dancing in the edge of hypocrisy, guided by the song from their own misery.

You are closed in your small world, alone with eyes bent for your own navel.
You are happy with your little toys, instruments of your own selfishness.

Blind... hanged in your own umbilical cord.
Bloody vanity washes the bowels of the world.
It feeds our poverty with remains of degradation.
Ruminating our own evil. Sweet satisfaction.

The world self-destroys while your eyes are bent for your own navel.

Selfishness... isolation... vanity... jealousy!

Blinded walls covered of mirrors we are.
Blind... hanged in your own umbilical cord.
