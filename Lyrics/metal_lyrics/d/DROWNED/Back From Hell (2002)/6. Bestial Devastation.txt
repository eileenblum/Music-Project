[SEPULTURA]

A legion of demons was born from boundaries of death, like an onslaught of evil, to destroy the earth. Covering the morbid skies, like a mist of Sulphur. I can see Satanas, the cursed of death. Terminate masses and reigns, with bloody axes of hate. The beasts of son of evil are tormenting the preachers of Christ. The humans try to reach to this nuclear war; witch is like an endless pain, burning in the fire of hell.
