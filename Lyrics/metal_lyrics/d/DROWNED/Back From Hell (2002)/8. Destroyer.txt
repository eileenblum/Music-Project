Days of death and nights of terror, prayers can not save you!!! My vengeance is cold and brutal... Close your eyes and await your end, I have an endless greed for your pain!!! I won't forgive one more time! I am destruction, I'm frustration, and I'm all that you fear!!! My vengeance is cold and brutal... I am hate, pain and desolation. I am all gods you fear!!! I won't forgive one more time! Greed for your blood is my only pleasure!!!
