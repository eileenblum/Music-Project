The armies follow the trail of death. Stench corpses are rotting in battlefield. The mutilated ones wait the time to die! The future is black - death is a certainty! I'm back from hell! The troops of dead men march to vengeance. To kill is their business - War is their madness. The hell is the only place of peace. Jesus doesn't save souls in times of war. I'm back from hell! Join the forces to attack! I'm back from hell! I'm the war that you'll never win! I'm back from hell! Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, I am back from hell to take your life!
