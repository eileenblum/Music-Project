Welcome to my destroyed world, constructed by blood. Destroy the boundaries of morality. We are global; let us trade the pain! Evil darkness inside! You try whores, money and evolution. I try disease, hunger and oppression. We need the same: to put an end in life! Evil darkness inside! You have thousand ways to clear the mind. I just have two: to kill and exterminate. I make those good things for money, as you. Just the tools are the differences between us. Evil darkness inside!
