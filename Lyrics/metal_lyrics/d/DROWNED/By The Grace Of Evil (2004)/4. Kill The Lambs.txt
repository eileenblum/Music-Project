The worms crawl in circles,
consuming the rot flesh of God.
The serpent speaks the tong of miserable.
The serpent greed's the flesh of hog.

We won't be lambs of Jesus' flock.

Kill the lambs!!!
They just want to kill the lambs!!!

We won't downcast and march.
None shepherd will guide us to slaughter.
Dogs won't consume our flesh.
None God will use our leather.
