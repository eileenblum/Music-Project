We've born in the cradle of the human hatred.
Welcome to the jungle of society impaled.
The civilization has failed... has failed!!!

We are not wise enough to receive the blessings...

The cross is the symbol of hope on horror!!!
All in the world worships the unseen terror...
the unseen terror...

No God for Apes...
We are apes and Jesus' grace...
Never flash in our face...

We are not wise enough to receive the blessings...
