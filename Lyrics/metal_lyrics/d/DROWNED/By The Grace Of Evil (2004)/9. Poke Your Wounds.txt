You're spiting in your own face
The blood of your disgrace.
Poke your wounds with a knife
And make them bleed again.
Suffering won't safe your life,
But pain is all that remains.

Masochist! Salt drains in your wounds!!!

Pessimist! Drink the blood of Christ's wounds!!!

False stigmas and self-immolation...
Finally you taste the sweet flavor of self-destruction...

Every night you join the hands
And pray at God for sending you to hell.
and try to lead the lambs to death.
