Divine capitalist wheel goes around,
Smashing all who lives on the unholy ground.
Their golden flames burn souls of paupers
And boneless flesh dances in mouth of masters.

God is only a business!!!

And Lunatics sale places in other dimensions.
Fools buy hope made with material possessions.

Explore the ignorance.
Crush the innocence.
God is only a business!!!
God just wanted media!!!

Pray for money pays the price of your escape.
Or the hell is the only place where you'll go after death.

Dogs bark with wrath
