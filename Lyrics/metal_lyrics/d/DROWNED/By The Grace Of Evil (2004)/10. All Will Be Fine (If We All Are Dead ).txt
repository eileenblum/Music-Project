All will be fine if we all are dead!

The madman down on his knees
And resigns his reasons for God..
The cross is burning in his chest.
Drugged, his suffering is better!!!
Trapped in a bed of a madhouse,
If you have faith, just insane, ...I don't!!!

It retards the pain 'till arrives his death.
It retards the pain 'till arrives his death!!!

All will be fine if we all are dead!

Only the madman reaches the heaven...
