Devastation!
The bombs don't choose their victims. The rain of fire destroys all on the ground...
Desolation! Parts of bodies spread in piles! 
The cruelty is the supply to this terror.
To exist is to destroy!
To survive is to construct!
This is the most destructive art!
Cowardice... Misery...
They'll kill you without mercy!
They want their way free!
Free to construct an empire over the corpses of their enemies!
Innocents cry beneath the ruins, mutilation and death are all that I see!
