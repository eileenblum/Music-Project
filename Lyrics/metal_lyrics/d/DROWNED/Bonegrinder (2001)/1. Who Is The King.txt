If God or Devil come here, it's better they come armed.
Prayers and worships are foolish.
To Kill and demolish are the only power in this world.
Here is worst than hell!
Kill the king!
And be your own king!
Cold is the blood to make justice with your own hands, and to show for all who is the king! Who is the king?
Terror and tragedy, hunger and misery, these are the fortune of the king.
A king that's reigning silent, in a Kingdom of blood!
Pay the price of being born in this shit.
If you're not a king, anything remains for you.
The dreams and wishes are for few.
If you're not a king, this world is not for you!!!
I am the king!!!!
