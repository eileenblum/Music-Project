The men what adventure on his lands and don't be afraid of the dragons and curses.
They leave mark in the history of the world and they make a way of light in the dark of the night...
Weak aside...
We are the best!
Come and taste the victory!!
Kill your enemies... C'mon and taste the victory... now!!!
Days of fight and nights of death...
Do you want to escape?
The ones who became passive, they were sucked to the oblivion...
The real victory has no price!!!
"March with honor...
We go to the battlefield; we fight for the worth that men have lost; for dignity many times forgotten and for domain of your lands.
Be my guest in hell!!!"
On these lands there's no place for the powerless.
I'll domain, destroying all that remains...
