Sharp words to knife the reason and the truth.
A serpent squirts hate.
The jealousy burns their eyes.
The poison of their words is to dilute in your blood.
Don't put the words in the mouth of another.
They are calling,
I can hear their screams and their lies.
They want you into the pit.
Alone!!!!!!!!!!
