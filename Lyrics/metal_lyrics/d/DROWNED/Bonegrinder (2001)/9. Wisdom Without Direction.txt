Everyone's betrayed greed, forced to choose between surrender and death...
We can choose between to be good or bad.
Everyone's imposed to live the same truth but it doesn't make dreams come true.
These are the differences what humanity didn't learn to respect.
We are the species of slavery?
Wisdom without direction...
The words become the weapon to hurt deep the ego and self esteem.
Someone doesn't even want to sleep 'cause the dreams will turn to nightmare.
You can lose your force to fight 'cause the sadness will rot your soul.
Damned be all who sell their souls to the enemies.
Keep with you the innocence.
It's a fragment of the infinity.
It's the difference between the true wisdom and the superficial knowledge of desert heart.
It's leading people to wander through the empty space without direction!
