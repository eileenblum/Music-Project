In the dark of night fall the masks of morality, denied sensations in the light of day.
It's the testimony of a suffered nocturnal humanity.
Where the angels fall in the abyss of the hell?
Waiting for the sunset, awaiting to be free, now the blood and flesh feed the soul.
It's the testimony of a suffered nocturnal humanity.
Where the angels fall in the abyss of the hell?
Where would you end, in heaven or in hell, in dark of the night or in lies of day?
In dark of the night fall the masks of morality, denies sensations in the light of day...
