Life is unjust; death is my trust,
our ending, and our rust...
I have one odeal, the one to kill,
and make them all kneel!
My fate feeds, the pleasant needs,
every dead can spread.

We have always needed the chance to make
the world vanishes... in the haze.

Massacre is fair! If you have born,
some day you will fall on the ground.
Massacre is justice! If they'd searched for,
why I cannot kill them right now?

I will make my sins, this way it begins,
only the weak wins.
Forge their graves, first do them slaves,
no Jesus could save.
No compassion, fear and deception...
your life goes on.

We will spread chaos and spill on earth the
sacred seeds of hell.
