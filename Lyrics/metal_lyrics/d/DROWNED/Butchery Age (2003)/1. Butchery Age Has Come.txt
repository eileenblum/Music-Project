Bodies and puddles of blood
are making the boundaries of hell.
The river of blood flows down.
Stamming hill is after the rain of fire!

Butchery age has come!

Innocents have no voice...
No more innocents...
Accomplices of death...

I am the assassin, but I have no chance!
Here is to kill or to die.
