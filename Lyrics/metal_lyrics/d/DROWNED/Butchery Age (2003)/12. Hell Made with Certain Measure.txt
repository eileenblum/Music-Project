You don't need being dead to suffer in hell.
To perish alive is worst than dead.
The pain is real.

You live like a winner a whole life of defeat!
Your faith is a hoax!
To die in a cross will never be a victory.
Wake up and don't fall into this trap!

Hell made with certain measure.
Death is your pleasure!

Die with your God, motherfucker!

Reality... burnt as hell!
You already chose your sentence.
