The morbid march trembles the world.
We can hear the steps of death.
We feel the bones banging in the flesh.
The earth scared by the wings of evil.

Dead men don't feel pain.
The armies of dead men!

The march goes on terrifying even tyrants.
The human life means nothing to them.
Women are raped and kids are tortured.
The earth scarred by the wings of evil...

Dead men will kill. The armies of dead men!

Make god in pieces. Put him in hell.
Stab his mother. She always wanted.
Make them in pieces. Put them in hell.

God would never hear their prayers.
'cause he would never wish their souls.

Dead men don't talk...
The armies of dead men!
Dead men don't think...
The armies of dead men!
