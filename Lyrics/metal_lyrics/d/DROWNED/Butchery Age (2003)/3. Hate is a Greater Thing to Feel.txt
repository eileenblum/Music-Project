Hate is the light that clears my sigt.
It makes me strong to fight!
I live my life blessed by hate.
With the mind free. I choose my fate!
I reject your showing of love.
This means nothing to me.

I'm very proud nowadays,
'cause my heart is full of hate...
and hate is the greater thing to feel!
It's the true power!

I am immortal. I am eternal.
I have hate enough inside me to prove it.
I do not make deals with light or darkness.
My troubles I solve them with bullets in heads!
I reject your crucified hero.
He means less than nothing to me.

Hate is the only thing to feel!
