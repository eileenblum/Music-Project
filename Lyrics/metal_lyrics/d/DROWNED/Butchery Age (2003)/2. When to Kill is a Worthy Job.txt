Oh, Death, face to mewhen I talk to you.
You had the chance to kill me but you've failed!
I've tasted the pain pulsing under my skin.
I've returned to make justice
with my own hands!

One by one...
I've drowned your souls
through the tears of your widows.
When to kill is a worthy job!

One by one, we take your lives.
Here is no place for fucking betrayers.
If you cannot honor your words...
One by one, well take your lives!
