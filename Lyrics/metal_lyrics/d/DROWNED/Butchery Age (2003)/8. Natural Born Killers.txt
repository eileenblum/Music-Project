We must each other!
We must kill or die!
Do it now! It cleans your way!
Death is the main thing
that we'll know someday.
No boundaries...
To kill is easy and fast.

Natural born killers...
Once a killer, always a killer...
Natural born killers...
We don't need heroes.
We just need victims.
You can be the next!

There's blood in my visions!
There's murder in my visions!

We'll fight hard until this world breaks down!
