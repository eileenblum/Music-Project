We were born to fight. Don't deny that holy fate.
We have an ancient taste...
The taste to see some dying.
We are naturally evil, pretending to be godly.
If you hate, others will.
If you kill them... others die!

World needs a new order.
so let's end the human race!

There's no time for crying,
no time for foolish sadness.
We are free in a cage.
Our ape instincts are strong.
A deadly end is always waiting us,
in every corner.
Who knows how long...
our enemies could survive.

World needs a new order,
so let's end the human race!

The world has the terror it's deserved.
This is the begging of the end.
