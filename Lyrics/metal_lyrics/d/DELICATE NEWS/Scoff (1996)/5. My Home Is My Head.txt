Someday I ask myself
What's going wrong with me
It's a wonderful lie
All that I've touched
All that I've seen
I loose my face
Life spits out of me
MY HOME IS MY HEAD
Someday I 'll bury my friends
I've no use for that shit
Designed by confusions
Oh god you'll see
It's more than a diabolic din
MY HOME IS MY HEAD
Splitted hopes of a dawn day
Creeping deep, deep inside of me
Could you remember ?
I standing by the edge
Depression haunting me
Foolish needs reign my agony
Another broken promise
Suffers the same fate
You hate me, I hate back
All what I want you'll take
There's nothing left to break
There's nothing more to say
MY HOME IS MY HEAD
