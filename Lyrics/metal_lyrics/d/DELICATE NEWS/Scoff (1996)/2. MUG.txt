Mirror !!!!!!!
I've got a message for you
Take a smile like my own
Look at this hungry sharp knife
Didn't I tell you before ?
It settles old scores
Bless the gallows birds
Cos they have construed my sallow gaze
And the endless struggle of hate
Cut down my fate

[Chorus]

The light shall kiss your breath
You'll lose your face
Slice by slice
Hated mug between my grinding eyes

Broken windows my fingers a tool
Shattered lips an expression of my bliss
Ignore that homeless feeling
Taste my everlasting wish

Is it me ? That mug ?
Has it thrown out blood
