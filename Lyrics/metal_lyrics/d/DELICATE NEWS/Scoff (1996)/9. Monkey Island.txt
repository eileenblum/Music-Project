Hold your life tight
Love is no passenger of my mind
This is the gist of my head
Yes! It's frightening!
But there's no one else
Who can help you
I'm your only friend
There's something in my wicked grin
There's something in my mind
It robs my light / it makes me blind
There's something in my wicked grin
There's something in my mind
It makes me blind / it robs my light
There is something ...
Monkey island! Island of my mind
Hold your life tight
Love is no passenger
Of my mind
This is the gist of
My head
Yes! It's frightening!
Monkey island! Island of my mind
