Depression! Loss!
Ain't your thoughts like that
Real pure mindmud Scoff makes me sick
Oh god can you feed me
There's nothing left but appetite
Now I'm waiting
Waiting for the one
Who switches on the light
Grief in my hands falling on my knees
Obsession! it makes no sense
Feel like a machine so weak and tough
Give me a smile come on tell me your lies
That's all I have to pray
Scoff! Suck my knife
Spit! An empty smile
Dirt! Use your fucking head
We'll meet again in hell!
Stop! No limits! Excess!
Press your guts on your skin
Teach your mouth bloody kisses
Pain! One of your only real decisions
Come on and push me / suck that brow
Take my soul / what i wanna be
Kill! Kill me before i get you
Scoff! Suck my knife
Spit! An empty smile
Dirt! Use your fucking head
I'll meet you in hell again!
