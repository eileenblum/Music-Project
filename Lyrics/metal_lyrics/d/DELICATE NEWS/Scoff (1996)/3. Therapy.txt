Sometimes I feel like a serial killer
Deprive your yearnings of a borrowed time
You've got me always when I've lost my mind
Unbelievable aggressions of an enslaved life
My soul at the zero

I guess nothing but a partiality for me
Cos sick modern psychos are finally free
I mention nothing

Sometimes I feel like a serial killer
Deprive your yearnings of a borrowed time
You've got me always when I've lost my mind
Sad news of a fallen hero

Time means nothing swallows my countless sins
Melts into our barren land suspicion has been spent
Hate fills my days hate means therapy
Soon you'll offer me a brew mixed by love and purity
Bastardized for you and me

I guess nothing but a partiality for you
Cos sick modern psychos are finally due
I mention nothing
