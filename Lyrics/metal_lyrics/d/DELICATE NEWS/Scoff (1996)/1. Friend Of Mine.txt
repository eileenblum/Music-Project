My feet standing in an unheeded section
Distress dogs my steps anytime!
I was born as a swamp flower
Oh yeah, cruel deeds formed my life
Deep mental shit grows inside my head
Sweat, tart friend of mine I've lost my energy to cry
It's exploding inside my head
Creating negative feelings that I never had before
Run! I didn't want to hurt you
Run! I'll make it sure
I wanna kill the poor
I wanna kill the poor
Remember! Never hoax a fool cos he tempts the sin
And it could be thought crime comes true
by an unexpected friend
Oh god! You need a punishment
Oh god! You need a punishment
