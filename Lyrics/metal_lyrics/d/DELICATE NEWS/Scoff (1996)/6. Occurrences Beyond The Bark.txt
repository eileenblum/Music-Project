Wet morning air clothed in a grey haze
Anticipates a new day
Peaceful nature given away
Human decay!
The definite possibility of a new existence
Daylight destroyed by contours of lies
Oh father!
Have you created a new belief?
Myrmidons of death / an extinguished light
Terrified eyes swung on my bough
Guilty or innocent / fools have never died
Remember your birth / another being left the earth
I can feel the hate / coming step by step
Obey my feelings / nothing passed
Evil makes it comfortable in my dark

I can feel the hate / coming step by step
Obey my feelings / nothing passed
Evil makes it comfortable in my shade

Death! The seed of a new life
Cruelty concealed between the lines
Rotten cadavers an excellent sign
A tasteful feast / your deplorable remnants
