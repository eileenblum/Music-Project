Like a razor's edge,
Your words cut me deep inside.
There's no "raison d'etre",
If you keep telling me lies!
The truth never comes out from you !
It's hard to feal real fine...
And it's sad but true:
You're a deceiver in disguise.
You're still telling,
That it's not you're fault.
All your excuses,
Won't mesmerize me.
You're only building,
A wall,made of wind,
And I watch it crumbling
Tired of waiting...

You shall lie in hell...
You shall lie in hell !!!

You should make me laugh,
But enough is just enough !
You'd destroy my soul,
You should know I won't get fooled!
Don't play with fire just stay away!
You'd always play,a dead end game!
You should think again:
I won't stay to feel the pain!

[Chorus]

You should try to understand,
You are,just totally,insane...
The filth embraces your brain,
You're not the one you claim.
If there's a place where you will dwell well,
Then you just,shall lie in hell !!!
You shall lie in hell !!

Disgusting! Amusing !
You're just a shadow of what you used to be!
You're alone! And you're lost!
You won't control again the situation!
Abuser! Deceiver!
You know you won't be back into my heart!
You'll perish! You'll vanish!
You shall lie in hell...

You shall lie,in hell !!!
