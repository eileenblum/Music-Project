And now the time has come for us,
To find the force to carry on,
We had the optimism, but time
has shown us realism.
We remember, the green, the seas,
blue skies.
All of it is now reduced to
nothing,
A dust of diamonds left in the
cosmic wind...
Innocent victims died in agony,
Murdered in the name of power
and greed!
We hold! The reins of tomorrow.
We try! Not to fall on sorrow.
We have! To be organised.
We will! Now open our eyes.
Bridges have been burned,
Between us, and our past.
Ultimate humans,
But how long will we last ?

We wear a crown of thorns,
Our cross is the unknown.
When will end our calvary ?
Will we find harmony ?
We'll search 'til our kingdom
come.

Torn between two worlds !
One exists no more,
One is to explore,
Ohoh...
Torn between two worlds !
We cannot see their shores...

The madness ! Menaces us,
But it's too soon to fall into his
darkness.
We won't do !The same error,
To let one deads us into the horror.
We have reached technological
dreams,
But still we're searching for the
peacful seeds.
If we find, a place to be,
Wisdom will prevail,
That's what we wish.

[pre chorus]
[chorus]

We are prisonners, of this infinite
universe.
We must find our place,or
disapear,without a trace.
At the gates, of new worlds,
We're under mutations,
We're torn between two worlds!!!

[chorus]
