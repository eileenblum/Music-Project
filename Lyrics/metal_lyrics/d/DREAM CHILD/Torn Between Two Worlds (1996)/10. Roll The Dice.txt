Searching,
To fight all the fears in your life.
Feeling...
That something has to be done.
Screaming !!!
To make them see you're here !
Creating...
To give birth to what you stand.
You will have to learn,
More than once or twice.
That chance can help you too !
You will have to fight,
Hard for your rights,
Yes believe it too !

[repeat]

Cards were all dealt,
On the day I was born,
And I choose, the ones
To go on and on...

Winning, Falling,
It's like, when you roll the dice,
Winning, Falling,
It can happens to your life,
When you roll the dice !

I can hear the calling of destinity,
Even tough I will face the
difficulties,
You have to make more than one
sacrifice,
If you really want,
To breack the ice,
Sometimes you'll have to ask
yourself:
"What is the meaning of my inner
self?"
Some people will say:
"You're a fool !"
But sometime the hazard, Can
make you rule !

[prechorus]
Lines were all traced
On the palm of my hand,?
And I follow the ones
To go on...

[chorus]

Reaching...
The goals that you made in your
life.
Losing...
Sometimes it's the price you have to
pay !

[bridge]

Sands are all falling,
On the hourglass,
And I ride the ones
To go on and on...

[chorus]
You rollthe dice
You roll the dice !
You win you loose !
