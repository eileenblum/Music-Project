How more evil must be met ?
How many times'til we forget ?
I don't know who has the answer,
All these times are so sinister.
They promised us a new world,
All I see is that it's worst:
New order, what a joke,
I can't even laugh...
They control us more everyday,
And the facts are here,
Can't you sense the fear ?
They will know every move you
made,
They will know every word you said.
Together! Just say no to this
nightmare...

In the name of life, we are strong
and free,
We like what we are, it's our way
to be.
No one again will control our mind.
The masses have fallen.
Can't you hear us screaming ?!?

Join us !
We hold the key to our destiny,
It belongs to ourselves,
It's our stenght to be.
Join us!
Refuse and resist, don't accept their
will !
We will not compromise, we will
fight,
We will cry, we will die but not as
slaves...

As the darkness falls,
Don't believe their lies,
Act now, and waiste no time...
'Cause they won't forget you,
They're hunter and they will get you,
Anytime, anywhere !
Try to do the best you can,
To avoid their conformism,
You are free to chose your life,
don't let the chance pass you by.
If you do want to be someone,
Join us, you should not regret.
Stand up! And find yourself free
again !

[pre chorus]
[chorus]

What will make them realize
That their kingrom of certitude
is just a kingdom of lies !

[chorus two times]
