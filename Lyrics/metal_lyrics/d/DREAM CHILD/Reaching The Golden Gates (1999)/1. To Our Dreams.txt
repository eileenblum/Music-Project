So you say, that we shouldn't go to that way,
That we will have a price to pay,
What is this game that you play ?
While you think, we are still taking all the risks,
we have still reasons to exist,
Why do you think we resist ?
You present us your plans, but you don't understand,
They're like castles made of sand.
You wanna build us a cage, but we're not your hostages,
You'll never tear down our rage !

Your empty world is only cold !
Would you defy our identity ?
Proud we will keep our dignity,
That's why we say :

We have to hold on to our dreams
They're here forever, they are still strong, we have to carry on
It's now or never !
Now or, now or, now or, never !
Now or, now or, now or, when ?

It's now or never !
We have to hold on to our dreams !

Reversing the tide, this will be our pride,
Don't wanna be shunt off the side,
Nothing will change us even largest bribes,
Money doesn't run our live.
Who are you to tell us what to do !
There's nothing left to say,
We're going on our way.

Your only goal, won't ease your soul
Would you defy our identity ?
Proud we will keep our dignity,
That's why we say :

[CHORUS]

Even when times are hard
We let the passion runs through our veins
We didn't use all the cards,
You'll see that all was not in vain.
We'll face the fears, and dry our tears,
They're just a souvenir,
What shall be remembered,
Is what's inside our heads.
