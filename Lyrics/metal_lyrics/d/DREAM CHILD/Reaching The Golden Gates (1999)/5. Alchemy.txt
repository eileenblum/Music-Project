What's the secret of the unity ?
Is this magic or some alchemy ?
Who holds the fire that burns inside our being ?
It could be you or it could be fears.
Balance is not easy to keep :
One world, one movement could ruin it all.
If you don't get yourself a grip,
Then you will fall in a hole !
Don't you know that you're a part of me
Don't you know that I can set you free ?
Even though it's not easy to see,
We have the same dreams.

Your power and mine will be melting into one,
Together as one we will reach a, new horizon.

Try to understand,
And we'll shape diamonds from the sands.
Try to understand,
And we'll build a world in a no man's land.
Try to realize, I see trough your eyes,
And if you were blind I would read your mind.
Reach the melting point, it's time to make the joint
Change your heart so cold,
From stone to gold.

Don't you know that you're part of me ?
Don't you know that you can set me free ?
Maybe it was just our destiny,
To share the same dream.

Your power and mine will be melting into one,
Together as one we will reach a new horizon.
We're not really the same but we're playing the same game
The perfect reunion to reach a new horizon...

We're like the wind, th fire, the water, the stone
Different elements fusing in one !
We unleash a power that create a sun !
And we will spread our rays.
All for one, one for all !
