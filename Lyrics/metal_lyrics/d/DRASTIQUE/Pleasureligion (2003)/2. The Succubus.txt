Night comes with silent whispers
Night comes so quiet and slow
Darkness surrounding all its creatures

Freezing my thoughts and feelings
Freezing my purest dreams
Something invades my ghostly slumber

Unholy devil-woman
Kissing my dried lips
Answer to my subconscious prayers

Locking my hands with her hands
My cold feet with her feet
Forging bewitching ways of pleasure

Liquid soul - in the ecstasy of silence
Inner war - you don't know what is real

Liquid soul - in the ecstasy of nightmare
Inner war - you don't know what you feel

I know you! 
Succubus with hot face...
...Oh, how greedily
Did I fall in your embrace!

Demon in my blood
Demon in my tears

Beauty was born in hell

Satan in my bones
Satan in my ears

Bleeding

Demon in my blood
Demon in my tears

Man was condemned to dwell

Satan in my bones
Satan in my ears

Bleeding and grieving

Tonight
