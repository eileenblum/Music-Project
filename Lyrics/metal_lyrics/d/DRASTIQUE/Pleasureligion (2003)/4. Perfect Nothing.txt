Sorrow in my heart
Till tomorrow on a star
Should I swallow all the light
Flowing from the guts of pain and blindness,
From the heart of darkness,
From the wounds of destiny

Are you looking for perfection
In this world of desolation?

Are you looking for perfection
In this world of agony?

Always praying for redemption
Starved slave of vane temptations

Forced to live in recollection
Are you losing your beliefs?

Master of life
God in disguise

Master of lies
Just tell me why

Wounded soul
Shattering your dreams to nightmares

Haunted ghoul
Crushing all your hopes to regrets

Find your score
No one wins, all jilted losers

Final scorn
Life and death, through love, to perfect nothing

Tearing us apart
Looking for a blind perfection
Lying on a star
Treasure of my uncreation

Your human nature
I feel inside
Burning the future
Of a thousand lives

Hollow is your heart
Beauty is the mask of women
Horror in my eyes
You swallow all my deadly semen

Your human pleasure
Shall be the light
Father of creatures
Bound to the night
