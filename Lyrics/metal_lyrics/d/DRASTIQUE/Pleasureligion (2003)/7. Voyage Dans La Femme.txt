Mother of my dreams

Follow the winds of thy heart
And reach the shore of passion

Mother of my sins

Follow the stream of thy blood
And be the lord of yours desires

Mother of my dreams

Follow the vibes of thy body
And ignore your thoughts

Mother of my sins

Follow the weaves of thy soul
And live your life without a fear

Przyzwol, o matko milosci
Szerafko trosk i radosci!
Tak po swiecie niechaj wszedzie
Twoja wladza wieczna bedzie!

Line-up:
Chris Buchman - all instruments, male vocals
Fay - female vocals
Mahavira - drums
