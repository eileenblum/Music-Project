Quisquis amat pereat

Their sense is with their senses all mixed in
Immortal is their pleasure, but mortal is their sin

Oh, lovers beneath the singing sky of may
Longing, lust and passion now you do obey

In my trembling fingertips bloody lips
Flaming in my desire

In my pure and stainless chest virtue's nest
Burning in a red fire

In this place of pain and sorrow
Now I know there's no tomorrow
Haunted site of dusk and horror 
We are one tormented soul

See my tears
Hear my cry

Restless winds and revelations
Punishment for our temptations
Ache beyond imagination
Victims of a cruel light

Touch my fears
Taste my blood

Amor che a nullo amato amar perdona
Mi prese del costui piacer si forte,
Che, come vedi, ancor non m'abbandona

Scent of darkness, breath of light air
You're my delight 

Silent caress, unseen whisper
Taste of the night

Quisquis amat valeat
Pereat qui nescit amare
Bis tanto pereat
Quisquis amare vetat
