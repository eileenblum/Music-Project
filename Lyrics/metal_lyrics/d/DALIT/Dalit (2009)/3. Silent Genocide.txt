We welcome your new era with seated ovations
Celebrate your manifest destiny
Move us a little further, we are too near thee

Indoctrinate our children in your ways, where truth are lies
Helplessly lost without the written word, you will make them forget

Claim our hills and mountains
In which our fathers bones dwell
Sell what you cannot own
Silence what you do not comprehend
In your pillory we rot
