Pushed into a state of indifference
I wander these haunted streets
Proclaiming hope to the hopeless
My feet are numb and weak

Looking into my own shadow
Seeing you killing me
Tell myself that this is over
Knowing that it will prevail

Wounds cut open again and again
The shame and the self-contempt
Bruises worn with dignity
Yet at night they will nourish
Again

A word of promise | a drop of faith
Deep red this scarlet poison | swept in chains

Our bodies they linger
To serve the sovereign upper hand
Solitude in tragedy
In appraisal for an end

Restless sleep in search for more
The future holds escape
Yet now is never far from here
With her moment swept in pain

How I long for the autumn rain...
Please open the floodgates of heaven!
