Your heaven
My safe place
That river will flood again

Your remorse
My anger
Tie bonds across all hope I know

Rejection
Breeding consequence
And bury
The coils of my doom

Reborn | Revival
Reliving my nightmare made flesh

I'm guiding the truth
To the shores of innocence

Compulsive apathy (breathe)
Indifferent insanity (converge)
Objection is endless (maintain)
But ruthlessly in vain (escape)

Compassion
Stay with me tonight
Together we will reap the harvest

My full moon, a metamorphosis in red
A sphere of too deep awareness

Struck a nerve
Embrace the pain
My fierce rite of passage

Dig deeper my vengeance
My lips devouring your seed

My scars
Transcending
You
My avenger
