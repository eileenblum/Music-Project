Behold a tragic display
A spectacle of endless ruin
Cosmos, my empire
Crumbling to shards

I mourn the ashes of my temple
Defiled by many and scorned by many more
The hymns we sang
Now forgotten
The congregations spread to the winds

I shed the last shred of my dignity
As I walk the last pillar crumble
Now even the shell collapse
Losing definition
The ruins of my empire

My treasures the wealth of my empire
Turns to ashes in my mouth
I inhale the scent of a thousand tomorrows
As I greet them from my ruin
