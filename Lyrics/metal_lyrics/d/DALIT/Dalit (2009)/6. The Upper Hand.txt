Drawn toward inevitable end
In the name of a broken promise
I am solitude incarnate
Exhale rewind

Force descending
My heaven of shame
Suppressing escape

In his name I curse every moment
My blessings burnt upon the altar
Each enclosing step brings him closer to heaven
Closer to my rapture

At a distance I see
Beauty turns sour
Sweetness envenomed
Injected in me

All hope is here with me now
We fade within cold arms tonight

My days they linger
How long tonight?
May all chidren wither
Before these arms

Mourning silence
Amend with me
Unlock the gates and
Flood my haven

On scarlet wings
Above the abyss
One more escape
Beyond all promise
