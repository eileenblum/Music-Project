I reap the flesh of a stillborn spirit
Exhale nakedness of all dying moments

Memories of intoxications
Floating in my veins
Remorse the fading ghost
The cup of every sorrow

Imperfection reborn
Inflicted human stain
Out of pages
Out of time
Out of life

Coerce resistance
Enforce control
Silence, sweet venom

Tranquilize
Our pain
Deception of life
Your river runs through me

Desire of hearts
I call upon you now

Sweet childhood
My Uriah
Your dreams
I feast upon their visions

My sacrifice
Burning slowly
Upon the altar
Of my completion

Disabled hope
A complete rejection
The last of tears
Has now fallen to the ground
