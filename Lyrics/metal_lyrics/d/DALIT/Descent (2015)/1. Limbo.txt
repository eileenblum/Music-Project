Procreation of the damned
We rely solemnly on how
The antidote
No cure for the sane
The answer lies
Nowhere in between
Anaesthetize
Sedate our children's bowels
Hovering towers
Ripping the sky
Open
Drenched in human flesh
Old triangles
Spawning new
Wealth due to sorrow
Limb by limb
We climb the dead
Wrestling on to raise our pride
Blindfolded
In constant search for more
Always kiss the flesh of thorns
Never face defeat
The antidote
No cure for the sane
The answer lays
Nowhere in between
Lazarus
Breathe once more
Retrieve an infant
To rule them all
Cast aside
All beauty adorned in pride
Tend the seed once kept alive
And so we all
Relive our past
To see it all
The way our world
Went by
Stepping down
From His throne of glittering stars
The prince of ashes
Embraced by the sun
