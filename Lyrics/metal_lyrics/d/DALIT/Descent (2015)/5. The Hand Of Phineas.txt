Complex witness
Worlds divided
Tension wrought in agony
Fingers bleeding, rest unholy
Bold eruption
Swept in awe
Mighty letters
Dance upon our heavens
Carve your ways through unwilling flesh
And so it ends
To wrestle emotions
To temper the gods
No words left unspoken
Will match the odds
Kicking the goads
The conquest eternal
Fixing the gods a goddess infernal
Fate like clay
Soft in your hands
Molding kiss of iron rods
Empty vessel
Loins of God
Who can hear the wolves approaching
Gathering the beast inside
Once again to fight and to claim
The blood of difference to sustain
Memory force the pale unknowing
Tears to bleed from swollen wounds
Bittersweet the night of loving
Ravaged womb conceives by mace
Mighty letters
Dance upon our heavens
Carve your ways through unwilling flesh
The truth and the outcome
Divergent decay
Selective projectives
For reasons unwronged
Behind the demon lights we all must bear our burdens
All take the blame
All make amends
And so it ends
