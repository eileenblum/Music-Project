We were faint with hunger and maddened by despair
We held our dying children and felt their little bodies tremble as their soul went out and left only a dead weight in our hands
They were not very heavy but we were faint and the dead weighed us down
There was no hope on earth
God seemed to have forgotten
Some one had been talking of the Son of God and said He had come
The people did not know
They did not care
They snatched at hope
They screamed like crazy people to Him for mercy and caught at the promise they heard He had made
