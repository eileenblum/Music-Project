Parting ways
Lives slipping through
Aeons to share
Still untamed
Ye towers of doom
Come tear down the gates
Enforce the mirage
Escape
Inhale the odor
Incense of defeat
Regain, envision
Maintain the elite
Wrought in ashes
Tied in chains
We kiss the veil of
Acid queens
No escape from the tide
The boundaries are set
Different points of view
Same regrets
The cult of moment
Oppressive
Collective deception
Oedipus confined disease
Or could devils origins contribute to defeat?
Our collective insight
Perception of time
Rejected as treason
Dismissed as why
How we were great
Fallen beneath the cracks
Our journey unfolds
To crown the clear blue sky
