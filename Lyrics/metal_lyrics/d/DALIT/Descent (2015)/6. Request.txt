Desert
Sons and daughters
Embrace a worn out future
Womb
Of compromise
Suffering the needs for progress
Desolate
Wastelands
Dry sand and bleeding cultures
Procreate the walls of youth
Scattered shells
Burning surface
Confining trust
Somewhere in between us
Trembling
Starving beggar hands
Out of reach
The touch of cloth
Revolving hatred
Wrestles thirst and demigods
In hells of scarlet wonders
Driving a wedge
Further into our being
Parting our sea of reeds
Severing our tongue
Souls will prevail
Battering your goads of effort
Towards a broad horizon
We leave this earth
Unmourned
But weep you hardened voice of never
Our fields will burn in shades of your gloom
Shipwrecked by the shores of knowledge
Your sisters' blood
Cries out from the ground
Hush and weep
You hardened voice of never
Fields burn in the shade of your gloom
Silenced we are by the shores of our knowledge
The self has failed the test
