I kiss the tourniquet
Gently maiming my body
Piece by piece
Embracing a lie
By sacrificial bleeding
To endure the night
Beyond the cold forever
I bury my dreams of you
Close within yet still so far away
Is this the great affection
The golden path of old
That leads us all in dismay?
Desert shores of human merit
Come quench my thirst
Oceans left to conquer
Depths to be fought
Brick by brick
We carry the load
Raising our beacon
To eclipse the sun
By the black holes in your eyes
Beyond all substitutes
Below all walls of pride
Beneath the outmost contempt
I bury my heart for you
