Wuthering wood when a dawn dream
Withal suffering in the haunted melancholy
The silent forest and its griefs
Songs of the gloomy winds, and the lullaby
Cruelty scribbles my face, dead emotions
I'm looking for me in the place
Where the moon illuminates
The ownerless clouds...
...And where the sky's scarlet
But I'm not there in the forest of melancholy...
