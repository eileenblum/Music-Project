"I'm the fallen with my silent drama
And my dreaded memories"

Tears dribbles from the eaves my heart
When the truth disown my remembrance
I'm tired of being hurted and it's hideaway

Sometimes I have a drastic fear
And the lustful reflection of obscured shadows
Then I remember there is no time to live
At the dead of winter night...

I wonder If I will die before tomorrow
Life is too long to feel
The loneliness and the pain...
