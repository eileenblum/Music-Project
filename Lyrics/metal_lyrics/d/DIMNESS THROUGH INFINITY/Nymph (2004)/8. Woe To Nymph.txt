"If you leave me in the dark cyclone
A deadly stillness
Silently I will send my tears
Through the sidereal gardens... "
Eternally
Do you belong me
My soul's crawling
Forgotten hopes are now fading...
Dark dispersed mist, forgotten griefs
Only I wish for
Dreaming in the furthest feelings...
But I despaired of ever seeing your sad
Eyes again, no one hears
Crying out from the infinity...
"infinity"
And still undying melancholy
Spiritual sadness
Where the heart of darkness's broken
But still I'm lonely
Don't leave me be
In my deepest part, darkness falls down in my tortured heart...
I've been waiting for ages, but still I can't wake from my dream
"Once in the dark to be remembered..."
