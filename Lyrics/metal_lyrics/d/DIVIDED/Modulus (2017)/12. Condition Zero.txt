We trust
That we will be the ones to shake some hands
With characters in private message
And everything just seems so perfect
The air is still cold
Out tonight

The absence of light is so right
So white so familiar
It leaves a scar
On the canvas of irrelevant thoughts
(What's) So blank and torn
Even its fabric makes me cry
We despise the smell we'll leave behind

Beating hearts are repeating the rhythm of our life
I wipe your eyes, they cry, they smile
Like the blind blue sky

I trust
That you will be the one to call my name
The short one what I gave myself in vain
And I know there's one seat left for me
Only tonight

From clusters they rise
They write with ten fingers
They reach for the light
Waiting, insulting
Since I downloaded the Sun like a leech
Without a blink of an eye
We despise the smell
We've left behind

Beating hearts are repeating the rhythm of our life
I wipe your eyes, they cry, they smile
Like the blind blue sky, half as clean as we are

Once I believed in your eyes
