Work it harder, make it high
Build it faster, scrape the sky
Make it higher, 'til you die
Build it faster, scrape the sky

A concrete cage we've made
(Still) evolving every day
On a rotten foundation

If God designed Man for its own image
What would be the face of our creation?

So an unnamed grave we lie in
While this architecture's rising
Confusing, persuading
But reaching for the stars

All we know
We're the lords of this land
Of the skin on our hands
If this broke their hearts
You will break their arms
To give this work a reason to rest

So an unnamed grave we lie in
While this architecture's rising
Confusing, persuading
A failure in their eyes

So an unnamed grave we lie in
While this architecture's rising
Confusing, persuading
Predestined to fall
