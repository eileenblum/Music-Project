Can you imagine that someone lives behind your eyes
You never knew, you never will 'cause when you cry he drowns

Through giant leaps you carry an emotional storm,
All the slopes you've ever had, the colors shrink as you grow

Hear these words they've left behind, gently they whisper in your mind
When you forgot to paint the sun on the sundown of your life
Empty, numb and sad you are on the hilltop of the graves
Of what was life long ago, or what yours will be

Denying and isolating, angry bargain, accepting a way out
Your way out
Never-dying, ever-crying, fragile memories sighing there's no way out
No way out

Can you ever be protective, put aside the pain
To comfort your beloved ones when the colors shrink as they grow?
