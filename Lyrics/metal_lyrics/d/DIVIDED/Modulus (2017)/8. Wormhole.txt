All exits are closed for me, the only thing I'll ever see is
A corridor to the black infinity
A taste of supremacy or the deepest void of sanity
Parasites of this state of liberty

Yeah, I know this feeling, waiting, calculating every single inch to reach this goal
Yeah, you won't deceive me, try and desecrate me, persuading wormhole of my soul

Windows through time and space isolating every way and were
Opened to blow the dust off my mistakes
Swallowing yesterday, I am one with the stars this way
But all exits are closed for me

I am awake but closed are the mind's eyesâ¦ why I'm trapped and there's no chance to comply
Fly much faster to know where the time fliesâ¦ it's like I'm stuck on a verse with a poor rhyme

Yeah, I know this feeling, waiting, calculating every single inch to reach this goal
Yeah, you won't deceive me, try and desecrate me, persuading wormhole of my soul
Persuading wormhole of my soul
