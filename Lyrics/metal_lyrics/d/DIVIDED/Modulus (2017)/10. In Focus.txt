Glass and superstitions all around
Rigid nonsense, it won't make sense
Let me decide how I play this through one time

Dressed in dead conditions, fame keeps me warm
There's no reaction without action
Let me design abnegation to defy

Make me believe
That I'm gonna make it,
Hunt the light with me
In my room with no window
Closed in my mind

An empty shell we all become
Through everything we said and done
The hollow stares of everyone
See my despair
Am I free? Secretly I am free, eternally!

Glass broken in splinters all around
Of shudder and the colors of my life
Let me decide if I use a fragment now

Please just roll the tape
Don't stop it now
No matter how you ask, I don't know why
But I will slit my throat
With the brightest shard I've found

Hold on to me
And my intuition
That's lost and found
And take all the blame
As I walk backwards
Opening my mind

An empty shell we all become
Through everything we said and done
The hollow stares of everyone
See my despair

Empty are the eyes of everyone
And so the screen will fade
