Wake up alone, running
My eyes through the room
I welcome the empty void as my only home
Beneath the tides of my feelings

You start to shout pulling me
Up from the floor
The moment you arrived you have ruined it all

I am falling back and realize
That I don't see the door anymore

Lie that you'll sleep through this night
All the things that separate,
All the things that suffocate
Don't watch me breathe from inside
Even if it makes no sense,
Drown in fake innocence

You went away buying something
Of our daily needs
The screensaver made an ambush on me
I've already seen that movie

Clarity hopes that silence comes
Into this hole
My breath paints oily clouds on the window

And as an urge my conscience arose
To glass he turns all my walls

Just come on and scream!
I'm alive
And will stand tall
'Til the next part
Will break me apart

Lie that you'll sleep through this night
All the things that separate,
All the things that suffocate
Don't watch me breathe from inside
Even if it makes no sense,
Drown in fake innocence

And I know you'll always lie to me
