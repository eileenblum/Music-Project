Mirror, mirror, I'm the door, slam me hard and down you fall
Mirror, mirror, on the wall, one shall win and take it all

But why
Did you choose this way?
Or your way chose me
Don't nod your head, just hush
And I'll make you understand
Blank future howls right off your face
Why must you control my life
Or is it my life that'll control your days?

Your words are vermin and
They gnaw away my soul
I know I'll lose myself
If I lose this war of yours

Break these chains and make me speak my mind
Hide behind your truth until I'll uncover mine
Break these chains only a single tear
I kept it safe for this moment

But why
Does this hurt so bad?
How come we walk one hundred miles
To see a more receding end?
Lacerate me once again
I beat my head against the wall
Between us
Just to make it higher

In alibis you drown
While I rush with no control
I know I'll lose myself
If I lose this war of yours

Break these chains and make me speak my mind
Hide behind your truth until I'll uncover mine
Break these chains only a single tear
I kept it safe for this moment
