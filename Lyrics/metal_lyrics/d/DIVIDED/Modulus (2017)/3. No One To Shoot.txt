Corruptive and all-seductive minds control the world
Mankind is the only species that pays to live on Earth

Who winds the benefit then?
An exploiter upper system, lives lived through in rage

Blind me, help me make all this disappear
Anyhow, we've never seen a way out of here
There's no one to shoot!

Millions yell and fight wars for strangers' instructions
Weaving an unfair, repressive social web

Freedom is simulated,
You'll live and die in their hands poor and insecure

Blind me, help me make all this disappear
Anyhow, we've never seen a way out of here
Find a game to hunt it'll make things easier
But no one to shoot, my own head is the right answer
