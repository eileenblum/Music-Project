Please use no words and leave this mess behind
A tear for every memory and smoke in the scrambling light

Rise, show me the stars, divide my heart, open my eyes
Now it is hard to let go, I've had to say no more than a hundred times

I feel the Earth is moving under these cheap old shoes
A lousy grip to cling onto with bare hands to the crust of ground
But there's no other option to choose

Rise, show me the stars, divide my heart, open my eyes
Now it is hard to let go, I've had to say no more than a hundred times

No, I said no! Now, fetch this wound!

Drifting along all the places I wanna be
Acid rains on this blood-stained therapy
Reaching for something as fake as eternity
Wasted like you, so leave me be

Rise, show me the stars, divide my heart, open my eyes
Now it is hard to let go, I've had to say no more than a hundred times
