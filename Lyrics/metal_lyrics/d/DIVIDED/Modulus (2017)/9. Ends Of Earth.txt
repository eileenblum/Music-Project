It's all right, just come closer
And hear my gentle whisper
Let it take you high in the sky

Sing along with the wind
And observe with eyes wide open
How fast all are clouds fly by

And if you live in stories you tell
You'll never ever fade away
They will be here until all ends of Earth

For a newcomer's face
I have sold my soul in vain
All the colors she concealed
Are turning gray
It all breaks apart now
In a shallow caul I hide
Sunlight, burn me away on this beautiful day

Just when the past is over
There's another door that opens
And its tenant awaits you with conceit

A misgiving fortuneteller
She hides the long-awaited answer
Why life tastes so bittersweet

And if you hear those stories she tells
They'll never ever fade away
Just be their guide again to all ends of Earth

For a newcomer's face
I have sold my soul in vain
All the colors she concealed
Are turning gray
It all breaks apart now
In a shallow caul I hide
Sunlight, burn me away on this beautiful day
