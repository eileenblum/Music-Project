Why am I here in this life?
Why do I suffer feel pain?
Why am I lost stray?
Let me die again

The broken life I am
My tears speak to me
The last day has ended
That day is today

Why am I here?
Why do I suffer why this fucking life?
Let me die again

Our life bounded with
Lowness &amp; disgrace
Our life bounded with
Controls &amp; laws
