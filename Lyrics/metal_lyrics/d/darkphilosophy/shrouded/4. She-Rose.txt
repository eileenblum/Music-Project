In the mist I am walking alone
With shadows of my own
Within a blink she rose
A spirit of a black rose

She came so close whispered
The song of salvation
Unusual warmth among the night
Cloudy sky manning lust
The moon is singing its last song
How could these words be so strong?

She came so close whispered
The song of salvation

Breath is playing with my hair
Lips are tasting my dead dream
A pure soul promised she
Never fall unless for me

Smell her odours wonder why
Touch her neck watch her eyes
Take her fearful hands with mine
Melt my sadness in her cries
