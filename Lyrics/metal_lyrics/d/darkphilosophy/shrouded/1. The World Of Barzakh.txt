I am the life of death
Where death shall live no more
I am the bliss I am the torture
To the grave adhere where u stay alive

Burial sent down desolate
Burial the hole of grievance

My world the garden of dust
I am the home of emigration
Fatherland of darkness
Cradle of eternity home of the vermin

Live with the maggot
Stay in the dark
You shall be on your own
