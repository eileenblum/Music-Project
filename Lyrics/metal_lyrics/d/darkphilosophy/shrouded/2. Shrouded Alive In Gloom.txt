Too young to be this old
Murder of a youth
Lying still alive
Too sick ever to die
Infection of a soul
Cold &amp; blue
Dwelling in doom

Salvation I need
God rescue me
I can't take it any more
I can't stand it any longer
I crave for death
Dreadful asylum

Here in my shell
I wait shrouded
Alive in gloom
God mercy
