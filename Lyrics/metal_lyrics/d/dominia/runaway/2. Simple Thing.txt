All I want
To lick your skin
To kiss your eyes
And touch your heart 
All I want is simple thing
I have to see you by my side

All I want - your lovely lips
To suck your tongue in tender fear
All I want is you my dear
Inside your look I see my tear

Something in your eyes - it makes me sad
Your shameless smell so bravely near
Exciting whispers in my head
All I want is what I hear

All I want is you my dear
Oh my love, you are so near
All I have is angels' grace
I have to kiss your perfect face
