Running through the night
And it drives me down
I deceide to take control in your mind
Waiting for the start 
I swear to reach tour heart
The master of your freedom and your pride

I will take you away my love
And you'll see a salvation around you
Ride the light, ride the dark
Will you have me inside you 
I love you

Runaway is the only way
Runaway you cannot stay

Running through the night
I can bring you the light
I deceide to take control in your mind
For you I will fight
And I am on your side
Give me your soul
And take fight
