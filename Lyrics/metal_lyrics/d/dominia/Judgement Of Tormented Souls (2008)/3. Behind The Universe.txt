Ugly prisons of human lives
They call it the saviour, the curing fire
Still hiding the most secret desire
To rust in the kingdom of blasted skies
Hear the voices, the voices in your heart
It is sweet enslavement of soul's loss
Pray for me, for the world that is falling apart
For another dead creation with his arms across

Scream
Blind reptiles were born of your virgin daughters
I'll drag you through the magic way
Of endless tortures

Where are your one-day, yet exhausted gods?
They're like a joke, a joke, I swear
I am nowhere and I am everywhere
Drinking poison with milk of sluts
Pull the trigger, the final fireworks
It rises above in speeches of a perfect liar
The planet Earth through obscuring smoke
There will be a new world
Healing the blind by fire

Scream
Blind reptiles were born of your virgin daughters
I'll drag you through the magic way
Of endless tortures
In blood on infant lips
Towards unending bliss
I am the total madness force
From outer worlds, behind the universe
