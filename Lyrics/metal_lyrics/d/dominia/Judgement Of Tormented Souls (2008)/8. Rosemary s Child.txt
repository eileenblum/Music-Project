Whispering shadows cast on your pale skin
Shining dream has gone. Dead sun rising
The lust of the Beast that bursts with sorrow deep within
The Belief that disappears beyond the last horizon

Requiem for the mankind echoes
in the laughter of your son
The doomed world dies out in the cold,
in the little eyes' damnation
Love that turned to pure hate,
to the great chaos. Pain's just begun
He's a defenseless child. Self-condemnation
