What do you want from me?
It feels like nails being pushed into my ears
...sharing wisdom? I do not need it
Swallow your pride. No excuse after the final defeat

I'm sick and tired of it
I'm sick. I can not find the name of the trick
To step out of my body
I can not suffocate a creep who whispers into my ear

It is I
You look through my window
And the sun keep shining
It is I!
Demons sleep inside
Deep in my heart
The Darkness is growing
Inside of me

It seems he's silent. Times are bleak
The light fades away
And every time I fall asleep
This is where it ends up, the time when I no longer care

[Repeat chorus]
