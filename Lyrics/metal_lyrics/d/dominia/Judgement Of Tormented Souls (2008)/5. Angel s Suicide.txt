A declaration of victory
They were determined to ruin the Earth
Obscene sacrileges
The new age has come
The one whose heart was removed at birth in the name of love
Clonned humans, dwarfed nations, the new law

The reasons for not seeing the tragic death of a friend
Absence of taste and dying out purity
For this refined pleasure, the hauntings
Ghostly children, no regret
Triumph of death, the moral insanity

Dear father, we can't even cry
That shatters our dreams, controls our minds
We despise frozen ocean in your eyes
On broken wings
We're obsessed with lust and hate
Then, as the end begins
The last endeavour, but it's too late

Do you see more than your burnt eyes do? The humble truth
Supreme principles, exploding hell lights up our life
We leave this paradise with a shining smile of eternal youth
Infected, crippled angel's suicide
