I might speak to no one,
End up, where they've just begun,
Wait for someone, who hasn't gone
Whose side am I really on?
They aren't in real world anymore,
Who haven't returned from war
Not guilty. There is no crime scene
But that's only what you think

I am the messiah,
Twilight messiah
My name is fire,
The flaming fire
Your god hates lying?
Couldn't keep from smiling
Is it like faith's defying?
Don't you feel like dying?

The clock keeps running slow
Many would have me believe so
Have to strive harder tonight
To keep these soldiers in the fight
Never brought back under control,
In part or in a whole
The most vivid dream that I ever had
Is a bomb thrown across the barricade

[Repeat chorus]

Those were the ones who have gone
to strengthen enemy, set it on fire
Whenever time, whoever would conduct,
put end to the unjust warfare
They plead guilty to killing,
disintegrating families and friends
Soldiers, mangled crucifixions,
hanging over a barbwire fence
Passed into nothingness

We lost at war
