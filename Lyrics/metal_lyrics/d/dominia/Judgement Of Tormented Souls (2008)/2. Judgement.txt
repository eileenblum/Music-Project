There was a time when I could speak to the Lord
A burning heart that made a real mystery unfold
I won't remember what is lost in tug of greed
In an ideal world that was made for me to see

It creates the atmosphere of fear
Pain, lots of pain come into my ears
Drown slowly in the river of tears
True enemies are drawing near
Screams of agony within this violent storm
The day the child died, the day he was born
Souls of dead gather waiting for this judgement day
Glory of this sacred day fades to gray

The only thing is, but it's always failed
Never ends, returns everyday
At the final gate, some began to pray
To get ready for doomsday
The power and protection
Belief in Jesus's resurrection
It haven't supported, helped us ever
Our souls are damned forever

I Joined those whose life departed, that'll be my doom
No daylight under the unholy darkest moon
Renewal to the highest ultimate degree
The verge on the meaningless, they sent to set it free
