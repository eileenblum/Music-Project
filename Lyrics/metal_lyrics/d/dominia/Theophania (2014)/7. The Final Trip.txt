It is the point of no return
Your life is on the limit
Your soul will dwell among the beasts
As soon as you will fell it

Pray â¦ for the last time away!
No will to wait for godâs sign

Itâs time to pay for all your sins
It is just the beginning
Youâve lost your air. Goodbye to you
Your awful soul is bleeding

You are placed in a cage with an ancient beast
Cold demon wastes his time with you
Because of pleasure of unholy feast
And he becomes an artist
He becomes a priest
When you are drowned in dirt
This evil is enjoyed and pleased

Pray â¦ for the last time
Get away out of life without sunshine
No prayer for the dying
