Everyone else will decompose
Everyone else, no matter white or black
We are still living here, we belong to the earth
But in time every being must be dead

Everything shall burn in the merciless fire
No religions will rule over this world
Absolute freedom needs no desire
Be reborn into spirits as this world grows old

Everyone else will die. No more birth!
This material world is not forever
We have drank too much blood of the earth
It is fadingâ¦ We are dying together

Everyone Else â¦
