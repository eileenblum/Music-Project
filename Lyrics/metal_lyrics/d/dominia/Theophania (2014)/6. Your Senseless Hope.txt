You think there is still hope
You should believe in miracles
And Jesus Christ will save your hopeless soul
And if you die he will take care of it

You think there is some kinf of devilâs fear
That is living outside of your hearts
And you believe someday it will disappear
But yo forgot that itâs just part of your mind

Your senseless hope is what youâve made in your mind
The complacency swallows and blinds
The roofless rope strangles your will
Untie your feelings let the spirit fly free

And you still think that god is thinking of you
Heâs taking care he knows what you are doing right now
Donât be afraid Iâm not trying to disturb you
But you will know somehow what is really going on
