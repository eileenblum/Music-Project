The only spot, the smallest in the World,
Was burning dimly, far away
Alone in silence, so cold
The white night
The black day

â¦In solitude
â¦Free of illusion
â¦No more reincarnations
â¦No more born again again
â¦On the pathway of renunciation
â¦No more lust and no more pain

My Demons are hungry
My heavy breathing is painful
I am so angry
For what to be grateful?

But something was leading my spirit
Into the unsolved mystery
To realize the I
Free of misery
The most important,
Something concealed

And finally, No courage no fear
Someone who changes all
He smashes the whole world,
The duality disappears

And I begin my final redemption
From the cave of my sinful mind
Going on through the Secret doors of exemption
I am filled with fear and internally blind
