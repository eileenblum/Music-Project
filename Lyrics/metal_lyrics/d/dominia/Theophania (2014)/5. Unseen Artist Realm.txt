Our tears are drying on the stony lips.
I pray for you, embrace me one last time.
This world will leave us. Follow me into the slipping
Bliss â to disappear within refined crime.
The road to nowhere blessed the night of final sleep.
Weâll not wake up here anymore.
The realm of dreams will be our shelter, lost and deep.
Dark labyrynth without Salvationâs door

Unseen Artist Realm plays with our fates.
The morning will not come for us.
We are withered flowers at Oblivionâs gates.
Burnt out, fallen starsâ¦
The picturs of our future are covered with snow.
Oh, cruel artist, who inspires you&amp;
Our dreams fade away in memories of evening glow.
The Grief, which no one ever knewâ¦

Where sleepless wild wind roams,
Where mothers swaddle stones,
I resurrect your call.
Where wreaths of loversâ hearts
Float into whirpoolâs arms,
We arise and fall
