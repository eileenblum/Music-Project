The plague proclaimed the age of sinking sorrow
The doors to my church are open for your tearful hearts
Salvation is here
Doomed children, I've a healing nectar.
Close your eyes and swallow
This dreadful world is turning to the shining land without plague's wounds

Your dreams will be like rays of Eden sun
Trust me and I'll save you
I've seen the end. Give me your eyes
Comprehend the final truth -- I am the chosen one
The blindness is my to you
the way to paradise

I can take all your fears, all your suffering
Behind the saving blindness eternal light awaits
Forget about hordes of festering folk, going into nothing
I am the mercy lifting you above mad world's disgrace
I am the gates between hell and heaven
My word is god's revelation over rotting world
I am the mercy waking you up from human being's venom
You shall become the young gods. Come to the land of the brightest gold

Mother plagues, cradle them
Let the children, dream in divine slumber
Mother plagues, as this world's condemned
The blindness will be hope when we're going under
