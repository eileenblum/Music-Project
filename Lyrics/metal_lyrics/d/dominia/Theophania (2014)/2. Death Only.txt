[feat. Gaby Koss]The Sicknessâ¦ Iâm waiting for the gods
Within the dimness of the candle lights
I'm alone on my deathbed
Awful sorrowâ¦ I am almost dead

They come from another world to find me
They try to take me back into Eternity

And Evil never wins over Good
And Good never wins over Evil
Only Love will win this war
Only Love will save this world

Iâm fighting my fear again
I am frightened of endless rain
I beg the forces to beat me down
I am asking them to kill me now
My misery â the right to this life
In despair, this dejection I desire
I see no merciful god
My only hope is that I'm already dead

And Evil never wins over Good
And Good never wins over Evil
Only Love will win this war
Only Death will save this world

Come with a clear and perfect mind
You will find the sense of life

In the Night Iâll be erased
In the twilight of the Human Race
They will meet me at the gates
And I will be paralyzed
No turn around thatâs my fate
I accept my sacrifice

And Evil never wins over Good
And Good never wins over Evil
Only Death will win this war
Only Death will save this world
