The Shadow Of The Lost Prophet
He is the ancient word of Truth
He is the child who was sworn
In the Battle of Light and Darkness
To defend the immortal dawn

He forgives the chosen one's knowledge
And changes the future of the damned
In the chasm of Despair
He kisses the feet of Queens

He blesses the warriors to win
And follows the moonlight obsession
He rules the grace of nations
And prevents destruction and termination

Nobody hears him now
In the desert of silence and sin
Nobody sees him now
In the sky through the hopeless clouds

Only the shadow of the Universe
Only the shadow of the Universe
Only the shadow of the Universe
Only the shadow...

"The Ark of the Lunatic Palace
The Arm touches the Book of Connection
The oblivion of irrepressible Malice
The eyes close slowly... Depression..."
