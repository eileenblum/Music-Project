The might of my Enemies
Die away in me
I will survive
I know I'm free
In the Land of Grief
With tears I slay
Come! Take my Life!
Come on! Let's play!

And I will rule
Don't fuck my brain!
Lie down on my bed
Release my pain
My hands are cruel
It's killing you ( It's killing you!!! )
You will be dead ( You will be dead!!! )
And I will fuck you!

Can you understand my misanthropic thoughts with your dead mind
Will you read my thoughts about life when I'll find my god?
Wash my face in the river of blood, in the river of my blood
Can you run away from madness? Sadness - My Goddess!
Will you want to save her life
When I will cut your naked wife
With dirty knife?

SAVE YOURSELF !
TRY TO SAVE YOURSELF !
SAVE YOURSELF !

Your fucking senses
You don't hear my screams
Your dirty dances
Excite my dreams
My eyes are blind
I want your flesh
My painful mind
Turns into trash!

SAVE YOUR SELF !
TRY TO SAVE YOUR SELF !
SAVE YOUR SELF !
TRY TO SAVE YOURâ¦
â¦SELF !!!
