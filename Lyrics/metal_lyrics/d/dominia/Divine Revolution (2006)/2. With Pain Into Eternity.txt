You feel weariness inside your heart again
You can feel it inside your soul
You wish to kill this pain, the eternal pain
But your spirit's swallowed by the black hole

As Time's passing away, you're back in the past
Turning the pages of sins that you have done
When your thoughts were in chains in the prison of lust
You did not see the light of the divine sun

And now, when it's cold to the bones
You are swallowed by the vortex of pain
You are all alone
And you follow the shadows of Satan's domain

You are still alive, dwelling in blindness
All that you got is broken to pieces
Slowly you decay, being tortured in darkness
Now the devil gives his deadly kisses.
