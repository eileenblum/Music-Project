The churches tell of paradise
We live to bring them sacrifice
We live in foolish Happiness
Becoming dumb &amp; blind, distressedâ¦

And every time we have to pay
And every time we have to die
In grief of Jesus Christ
We will return to paradise

All the roads are blocked to traffic
Every sheep is going to Hell
Writers, Singers, Cult Classics
They all completely fell

We feel a bitter taste of Power
We live in ancient gloomy towers
The Holy Bible is a devious joint
The look of Christ on a golden coin
