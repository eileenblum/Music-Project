The planet-earth will be ruined and broken
The faith in truth will be erased and soon will be forgotten
The picture shows me just the hopeless slaves
The new world order comes it's time to dig the endless graves

It is the end of hopes and peace
It is the coming of the Beast
The picture shows me the earth embraced in gloom
It is the start of Mankind Doom

No way out of act
Accept the fact
And we've been fucked
By (new world order) policy
Don't tell themâ please!â
Don't stand on knees
And just through this
You might escape this prophecy

Third war is near. We'll see the seas of blood
It is the precedence of the real Ungod
The picture shows me the politicians' conspiracy
Prepare to die and pray, if you believe in prophecy
