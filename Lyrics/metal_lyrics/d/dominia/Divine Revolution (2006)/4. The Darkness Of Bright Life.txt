Just tell me 'bout hate and love
Am I talking to stupid worms?
I have found a magnificent trove
There is no sleep, we're dead by dawn

I see the pain day after day
The politicians are free to kill
And on the earth evil is the way
I tell about the devil's will

Open your mind, pray for tomorrow
Here comes the night, the endless streams of blood
I see the judgement day in sorrow
The end is near. I hear the scream of god

The Darkness of Bright Life
No shadows and no light
The Darkness of Bright Life
In emptiness you'll die

Around the seeds of devil's lie
Infernal demons are trying to be good
They will all fucking die!
This war will end what will we do?
