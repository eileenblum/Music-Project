[Bonus track]

Within sweet senses
You hear the fading deep breathing
See absurd dances of sludge
You drown in wine's blessing
I'm inside your mind
Leave your life behind
Decline in the power of wine

And obscure creaking
Entwines in the land of sad dreams
Despair is licking your skies
The lonely night begins
I'm inside your mind
Leave your life behind
Decline in the power of wine

I'm a Door to your fears
To cellar of grey pleasure
Swallow the final tears of your drink
Forget about measure
Will you feel her eyes?
Feigning when she smiles
All this magic, endless love
Will die in the shroud of lies

Cellar Door Cellar Door
I feel every creaking in my soul when I close my eyes
Cellar Door Cellar Door
All I want to lie on a dirty floor in wine, in wine's strange paradise
