You're beautiful Innocence. I want you
It's no longer a dream about you
For you my soul. Your flesh for me
God inside you. Devil inside me

You're beautiful innocence. I want you
Bound in black, leads to abuse
Let me kiss your lips and your face, your pretty face
You take me in your sweet embrace

You're beautiful innocence. I want you
Lay down on a bed and I'll sleep with you
For you my dreams. Your life for me
God inside you. Devil inside me

When the waves of night embrace my dreams
I call your name
You're the innocent child. I'm your dark prince
Enjoy this game.
