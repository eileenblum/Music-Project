I want to know. What is my way?
Where will I burn, where will I decay?
What's happening to me? Decease?
I don't need to be saved. Punish me, please!

What is the pleasure to be burned in the fire?
Faith is the pressure. I wish no desire!

I'm swimming in pain. The suffocation!!!
                          The punishment again. That's my Salvation.
What's happening to me? Decease?
I don't need to be saved. Punish me, please!
