[Lyrics and Music by Marco Garau]

Fall, fall in the dark of my soul
Where is the spark to turn on every war
Burn, into this land you will burn
You're not my friend if you want change my law

Now, now I can give you the chance to be strong
Or to forgive you forever
Tonight, Exenthar you have to come by my side
I cannot wait anymore

This is my destiny
This is my reign
He cannot stop my holy blade
You make the prophecy
Into the dark
This is the end of Exenthar

Run under the light of the sun
Where I will leave you the void in your heart
Cry, under the rage of my eyes
And face to face you'll be waiting to die

Now, I'm getting tired of waste other time
And (I) will condemn you forever!
Tonight when I will end your miserable life
You'll meet the king of the world!

This is my destiny
This is my reign
He cannot stop my holy blade
You make the prophecy
Into the dark
This is the end of Exenthar
