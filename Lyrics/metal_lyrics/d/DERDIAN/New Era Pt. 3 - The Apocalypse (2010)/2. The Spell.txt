[Lyrics and Music by Marco Garau]

Walking around died warriors
You cannot find the way
To leave there pain and sorrow
And come inside my reign
All that you want is all I want
We are a bloody mind
And with me you've found your glory time

I will expose to you my plain
To get the final war
This is the time to win the game
And purify the world
You have to be more merciless
And to be full of rage
And with me you'll ride my horse of hate

And now I want to see your fight
Into the darkness of the night
Forever you will be my warrior
Because your soul is mine!

I am not your enemy
This is not your end
I will keep your soul until you are under my spell
Make the evil carries on
Fall into my war again
Keeper of this hell!

Time after time you've lost your faith
Searching to stay alone
But now it's time for you to dare
Your walk is hard and long
Enter my fortress my old friend
You've never been so strong
And with me you'll come to rule the world!

And now I want to see your fight
Into the darkness of the night
Forever you will be my warrior
Because your soul is mine!

I am not your enemy
This is not your end
I will keep your soul until you are under my spell
Make the evil carries on
Fall into my war again
Keeper of this hell!

[Troghlor:]
Forever and Ever
You and me we'll stay together
In the joy, in the pain
But always fighting, always fighting for the win

[Angels:]
Until the end of time
He will bring you to die
Don't listen to this lie
And come back to the life
Until the end of time
He'll try to take your mind
And will bring you to die
Until the end

Don't listen
Don't follow him
We whisper:
"Your place is here"
Don't listen
Don't stay with him

[Golstar:] I have to go with my own king

And now I want to see your fight
Into the darkness of the night
Forever you will be my warrior
Because your soul is mine!

I am not your enemy
This is not your end
I will keep your soul until you are under my spell
Make the evil carries on
Fall into my war again
Keeper of this hell!
