[Music and Lyrics by Enrico Pistolese]

I can't believe to have you here with me again
'cause I supposed you to escape away from there
What a shameful day! we've been defeated and our fame
Has been trampled that night in the rain

A journey (as) long as an era on this land
Brought me to meet in the forest a wise man
Dorian is the name of our hope of breaking chains
Of the spell benumbing golstar's brain

He said to be able to help us,
To set him free from the spell and thus
Golstar will be one more time with me
My old friend again with me!

A new hope is rising from a new idol
Dorian will save him and I'll have back my walls
Loren will be in golstar's dreams and
Her spirit will fly again

Indomitus
Sine timore
Exercitus
Necans dolore

But if this plan does not work we
Must be ready for the war!
Have to get back our dark astar now!

A new hope is rising from a new idol
Dorian will save him and I'll have back my walls
Loren will be in golstar's dreams and
Her spirit will fly again

Let's hope my guys
The white magic will rise
In east we'll wait for better times
Her spirit lives
And purifies his whole will
The hope ever is last to die
