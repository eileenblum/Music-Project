[Lyrics and music by Marco Garau]

Every day and every night
I find the only way to see my life
And when no one can see the time to fly
Appears and disappears a light

Turns the moon and moves the sea
I cannot stay with you, my destiny
I want to cry, I want to take my dreams
Where I can find again some peace

Into my dreams
Into my dreams
Into my dreams I feel your peace
Into my dreams
Into my dreams
Into my dreams I feel your peace

Oh I take my mind and try to turn, turn around the world
See the places where I want to go all around the world

Come with me into my dreams
To live for evermore
Time has changed this melody
And there is no return

Oh I take my mind and try to turn, turn around the world
See the places where I want to go all around the world
