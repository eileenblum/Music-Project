[Music by Dario Radaelli; Lyrics by Marco Garau]

I feel your presence
Into my soul
I want revenge - and drink his blood
You are my only - hope in this night
Take my dead heart
Help me to bring its to life

Erase my pain, erase all my pain
I cannot cry for my love everyday
You are the way, you are the only way
I want to hear what you say

Goddess I know that
With you I'll destroy his domain
Let me fly on the mountains of your reign

I feel your power
I feel your divine embrace
Bud as a flower
So deep, deep inside my veins

Wish of destruction - inside my head
I see the sky's - turning to red
And the reaction - against the beast
Sentenced to death
Will end the darkest of days

And with no fear, and with no more fear
I will return in this valley of tears
Inside my sphere, inside my black sphere
I see his face disappear!

Goddess I hope that
You turn all your rage against him
And I know that you will realize my dream

I feel your power
I feel your divine embrace
Bud as a flower
So deep, deep inside my veins
