[Lyrics and Music by Enrico Pistolese]

Nightfall, shadows of suspects in me!
Golstar, traitor of Derdian I feel!
For the revolution of rage, my Lord - will not have me!
From the cradle to the grave - I will hate!
(and) I must investigate, betrayer!
Liar! - Traitor! Bastard! I'm your Master, I will punish you!

Voices from my people say -- Golstar used to go at night to Astar
They say he used to conspire - with the King of Garrold against me

So I'm thinking for a punishment
He's a creature so false
So I'm the tyrant of Derdian or what?

He should be on a mission to -- kill my mortal enemy, lord Raighon
And instead he waste his time -- with that filthy female, named Loren

Paying his lack of devotion
In the dark of a cave
He will regret what has done in his own life

[CHORUS:]
Let the evil come to me
I want a human disaster
I will find the most bloody revenge upon him - upon him
I despise his behaviour
In the dark he will suffer
I'm the bringer of sorrow -- malicious I'll be, bad I will be!

I will destroy the things you love, you know I hate you
This is the secret of my force, disaster all around I bring
The walls of Astar will collapse, and burn forever!
What kind of promise you received from Exenthar, the Astar's king?

I will kill him like Rodon
Oh my dear bloody deed
This is your destiny if you conspire against me
I will kill him like Rodon
Oh my dear bloody deed
This is your destiny if you conspire against me
Death, you'll suffer, this I'll offer,'this is my dimension!

[Solos]

[CHORUS]

Nightfall, shadows of suspects in me!  betrayer of my kingdom!
You will try my own justice, vassal come here and listen!
