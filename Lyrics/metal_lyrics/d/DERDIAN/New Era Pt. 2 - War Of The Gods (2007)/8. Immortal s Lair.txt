[Lyrics and Music by Marco Garau]

We are ready for the journey - We are ready for the long way - We are ready for the journey
We are ready to destroy your God!

Riding in the name of God
Through the forest of the Trolls
I will find the way to close your eyes
I will sign your destiny forever
And my name will shine into the sky

Run my horses, run my guys
We will take him by surprise
Oh, a giant castle from my sight
We are arrived before the mighty towers
In the land of the holy life

Stop your army now! - Let me see your fortress
You will bite the ground! - Let me taste your pain!

[CHORUS:]
RIDING FOR THE IMMORTAL'S LAIR
I FOLLOW THE SHADOW OF YOUR EYES
PRAY FOR YOUR LIFE!
DESTINY IS LOOKING FOR MY PRIDE
LOST INSIDE THIS CRUEL WORLD
I WILL STAY FOREVER WITH MY SWORD
DEEP IN MY SOUL
I'M READY FOR THE ANUBI'S FALL

Only fire in the sky
My desire is to fight
Go to close the holy gates of time
Oh I will become your worse obsession
And your way will meet its end tonight

It's my army what you see
Leave the crown and come with me
Only for the destiny of your life
In your eyes there are some tears of sorrow
And your God will die tonight!

Stop your army now! - I'll destroy your fortress
I will stop your crowd! - Time to kill your god

[CHORUS]

For the time we can wait 'till tomorrow
We've signed the end of this pain
We've signed the end of the sorrow
And will come back along the way

[CHORUS]
