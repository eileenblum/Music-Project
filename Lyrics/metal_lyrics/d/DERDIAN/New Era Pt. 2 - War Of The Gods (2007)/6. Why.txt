[Lyrics and Music by Marco Garau]

I will fight my sorrow
Closed inside a melody
Memories of your smile live in my heart

Waiting for tomorrow
There's no light inside my dreams
I can change my life but not the past

IN THE STARRY SKY I SEE YOUR LOVELY FACE
RAGE STILL GROWS INSIDE DAY AFTER DAY

WHY? WHY MY LIFE HAS BEEN SO UNFAIR?
I WOULD HAVE LOVE TO DIE
RATHER THEN STAY HERE WITHOUT YOU
WHY DEATH HAS FOUND YOU ALONG THE WAY
WAITING FOR THE END OF TIME
I WILL NEVER STOP LOVING YOU

In this land of warriors
All are crying for your death
He will pay with life, this is an oath!

I'll defeat the warlord
And its dynasty will end
This will bring some peace back to our souls

IN THE STARRY SKY I SEE YOUR LOVELY FACE
RAGE STILL GROWS INSIDE DAY AFTER DAY

WHY? WHY MY LIFE HAS BEEN SO UNFAIR?
I WOULD HAVE LOVE TO DIE
RATHER THEN STAY HERE WITHOUT YOU
WHY DEATH HAS FOUND YOU ALONG THE WAY
WAITING FOR THE END OF TIME
I WILL NEVER STOP LOVING YOU
