[Lyrics and Music by Marco Garau]

I WILL CROSS THE MOUNTAIN I WILL CROSS THE RIVER OF TEARS
NOW I HAVE TO FIND HIM I WILL FIGHT WITHOUT FEAR

For my love I'm running in the dark
With my sacred sword I'll fight against the king
As an icy blade inside my heart
This is the pain I feel

Now in my eyes there is a fire that will burn your empty soul
Run in the night I have the power to destroy the dirty warm
SO I'M HERE ARE YOU READY FOR WAR!

[CHORUS:]
Unholy visions images of death so cruel
Rows in my mind In a way that I can't rule
Blood on your hands and regret in my black heart
I'll cry 'cause I have seen my princess die
Into the abyss of the hell -- Lost in my rage
Far from her life

Frozen tears are falling from my eyes
While my soul is burning fire onto this land
My black horse will ride this darkened sky
Your glory time will end

Now in my eyes there is a fire that will burn your empty soul
Run in the night I have the power to destroy the dirty warm
SO I'M HERE ARE YOU READY FOR WAR!

[CHORUS]

Beaten, defeated the battle is lost Our lives will never be free
I'm here alone in this useless world I've nothing to see
While the tyrant is laughing Rain is falling on me
Just a flash of a blade And her wide open eyes

Death submission and hatred Running inside my veins
I'm praying the god Not to lose the faith
But the evil will never end So I will keep my pride
And I'll fight again Again Thoglor's reign
In my heart this fire survive

Skies are falling on me
Life is too cruel to live
Death is so far from me
I live again but never
I forget the scene were I've seen
My princess dying at least
I'll kill the beast

[CHORUS]
