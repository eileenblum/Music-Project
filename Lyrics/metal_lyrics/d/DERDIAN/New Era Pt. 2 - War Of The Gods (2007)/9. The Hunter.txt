[Lyrics and Music by Enrico Pistolese]

Living and Fighting Together
Living and Fighting Forever
Living and Fighting Wherever
We will steal into your soul

Ride now!!!

Despair and pain inside my heart
Become a fearful hate
Death pictures in my mind, the start
For me to seal your fate
There is just one thing I' m thinking to - What d' you think milord? - Speak ? to your horde!
Dissolution of his power, dust and ash I want!

[CHORUS:]
I am your hunter, I'll capture you for
All the disaster and pain, you brought to this world
Hate raising up, my heart is burning for
This wounds that will not heal
Take my word this times for real
I am your punisher and my revenge
Will strike you fierce and quick!

Living and Fighting Together
Living and Fighting Forever
Living and Fighting Wherever
We will steal into your soul

The time to come to raise my head 'n
Revolt against you lord
I'm getting to the place you hide
This journey ain't too long
Only a few days ride just wait and see - Ride to get that prey! - First prize for our hate!
And I'll bring with me the force of the love that you've destroyed

[CHORUS]

I'm a man but I will become a god
'Cause that what you takes to battle with you
Equal strength we make you experience fear again
This world needs the balance restored

[CHORUS]

Living and Fighting Together
Living and Fighting Forever
Living and Fighting Wherever
We will enter in your soul
And in the rage of my fire
I will transform my desires
And I will ask for my powers
my own holy god!
