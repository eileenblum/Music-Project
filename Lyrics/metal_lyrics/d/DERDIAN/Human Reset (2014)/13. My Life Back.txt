Do you really want to know
The story of my life?
I'll let the music talk.
I swear this is not a lie.

I'm not used to pray.
I had no faith,
Maybe someone's done for me,
And now I can tell and live.

Give me your time!
I found the secret to change my destiny.
Follow the rhymes,
Open your mind and let your thoughts flow free.

I was frayed and afraid
I was far, far from grace.
I couldn't find any place not to feel I'm a waste...
There's no Moon, there's no Sun
Just a few ugly scars that light my mind
To remember the past
And get my life back.

And get my life back...

All begin with anguish,
Unbearable daily pain.
Love by you has vanished
And I had no job nor aim.
Toxic bane flowed in my veins:
It ran like a train
And I was like a crazy ball,
Slave of the lowest drives.

Give me your time!
I found the secret to change my destiny.
Follow the rhymes,
Open your mind and let your thoughts flow free.

I was frayed and afraid
I was far, far from grace.
Couldn't find any place not to feel I'm a waste...
There's no Moon, there's no Sun
Just a few ugly scars that light my mind
To remember the past

And get my life back.

All the emotions was outside of me
I felt deprived of my identity.
Paranoia and pain
Negation and decay
A constant derealization...
Once I felt inside a kind of bloom,
While I was lost in the fumes from a spoon
Whispering mild like a breeze:
"Life can be easy..."

I was frayed and afraid
I was far, far from grace.
Couldn't find any place not to feel I'm a waste...
There's no Moon, there's no Sun
Just a band and some friends that share a dream
To feel safe from the past
And get my life back.
