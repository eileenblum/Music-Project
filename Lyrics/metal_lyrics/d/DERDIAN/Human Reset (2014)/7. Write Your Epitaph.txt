Hey! We came here for you!
To free the "Blue Planet",
To control and get your energy.
It will be so easy...
We'll lay waste your useless race.
You'll become a memory for this place.

And we act so rapidly,
We will end the comedy:
For the Planet we're the remedy.

[Chorus:]
You don't deserve a better fate
You wasted all your time
To fight against each other,
To fight against your rise.
Because we gave you already a chance.
You wasted it tonight.
Our landing proved you can not face our superiority.
There is no way to fight!
You will write your epitaph tonight!

Hey! We were watching you.
During these last centuries
We revealed the crash you're coming to.
You're the Planet's enemies,
Less than a rough animal...
The evolution next step we'll preclude.

Then we'll act so rapidly,
And we end the comedy:
For the Planet we're the remedy.

[Chorus:]
You don't deserve a better fate
You wasted all your time
To fight against each other,
To fight against your rise.
Because we gave you already a chance.
You wasted it tonight.
Our landing proved you can not face our superiority.
There is no way to fight!
You will write your epitaph tonight!

How you've been so blind?
You've lost the perception of right.
You've seen yourselves (you've seen yourselves)
As centre and aim of Universe! (Of Universe!)
Yeah!

[Chorus:]
You don't deserve a better fate
You wasted all your time
To fight against each other,
To fight against your rise.
Because we gave you already a chance.
You wasted it tonight.
Our landing proved you can not face our superiority.
There is no way to fight!

You will write your epitaph - tonight!

Oh, you don't deserve a better fate, a better fate!

Your race is lost.
Your race is lost!
Hahahaha, bye-bye!
