Music is a thing that comes out of my heart
And I need to sing in every place on Earth
To carry on, to carry on
I need the music in my soul.

I can get my life away from daily stress,
Breathing deep and putting on my music dress.
So carry on, so carry on
I keep the music in my soul.
So carry on, so carry on
I make the music fill my soul.

[Chorus:]
At the end of the story: No music - no life.
It's a gift you've received from the Sky.
You can play for the glory, for money or pride.
With her notes she will pass through your eyes.
Music is life!

[2x]
When a life is born,
When a friend is gone,
When the pain is stealing my time;
When a work is done,
When I cry for love,
I can lean on her to survive.
When I lost control,
When I pay the toll,
When regret is shading my mind,
I can lean on my friend: Music.
And the music will be mine.

[Chorus 2x:]
At the end of the story: No music - no life.
It's a gift you've received from the Sky.
You can play for the glory, for money or pride.

It's the blood in my veins.
Music is life!
