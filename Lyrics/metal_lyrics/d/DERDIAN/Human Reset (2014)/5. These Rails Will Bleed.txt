Here downstairs in the underground
Nobody can notice him,
He seems to be invisible.
There's obsession in his eyes.

Walking back and forth all day,
touching nervous his soiled tie,
Wondering how could be his life,
If he'd kept that fucking job!

Once I was there and he told me about his life.
Shining light in his eyes,
And a smile to show me his pride.

So self-assured,
He said: "I take all life can give:
Every joy, every good I've deserved."
But now there's no sign of all the previous pride.

[Chorus:]
And he told me:
"Man, these rails will bleed...
What does life mean?
I've got no more will to live.
Buried under a grave of broken dreams.
I'm a victim of reality!"

Fills all his mind, expands like a fire
One way to escape from this misery.
Out of the gallery - the lights of a train
Are getting closer to save him from pain.

[Chorus:]
And he told me:
"Man, these rails will bleed...
What does life mean?
I've got no more will to live.
Buried under a grave of broken dreams.
I'm a victim of reality!"
