I'm looking beyond the ruins of world
If something's been spared from this huge rot,
But I have to admit there's nothing there
For the land seems to have known no god!
And their crying eyes are looking high
"Empty holes staring at me"
It's just the result of the resignation of human kind!

Your heart wants to communicate you:
"Stop feeling sorry for yourself!
There's gold in your mind and in your soul
And frailty is not allowed."

[Chorus:]
You're alone, not a piece of chord
You're a flash in the horde.
Everyone you meet here
Show the vile fear
And cures his little world.
Merciless god your bravery bless
You're the one who guess
Which is the great mission against fiction
Everyone performs on Earth.

When world will collapse on human kind
Stand firm with the target in your mind
And put on the clothes that suit the role:
Be the King, give this world a law!

It seems the whole world is screaming:
"Give us an order, a rule!"
You know now the crown belongs to you,
It doesn't matter if you are cruel.

[Chorus:]
You're alone, not a piece of chord
You're a flash in the horde.
Everyone you meet here
Show the vile fear
And cures his little world.
Merciless god your bravery bless
You're the one who guess
Which is the great mission against fiction
Everyone performs on Earth.

Take up your position,
It's the time to start your brand new mission!
No need for permission from the people,
You know you don't need it!
Pounce on future's barriers as a bull,
Pounce on the red flag carrier!
A new sunrise's blinding our eyes,
And the voice of hope says: "We rise!"
No more weakness,
No more distress.
No one will miss that gray stillness.
You're a leader, a new reader
Of a gospel never written.
So lead us!

[Chorus:]
You're alone, not a piece of chord
You're a flash in the horde.
Everyone you meet here
Show the vile fear
And cures his little world.
Merciless god your bravery bless
You're the one who guess
Which is the great mission against fiction
Everyone performs on Earth.
