Everyday the prophecy
Rings out in my confused mind without reason.
It resounds so noisily,
Suffocating with its signs.
Upsetting my world,
Defeating my lord:
Lord of the growth, modernization and asphalt,
and all you can touch with your fucking hands.
You've pretended not to be part of Nature.

Nothing can take off my mind the day I woke up too late
To set my incredulous eyes on the last bloody fight.
Thousand of corpses were spread along the road, everything in the square...
Everybody without head!
Burning skyscrapers fell down under a strange and eerie attack!
X-rays by dark ships were fired, they can control the field of G.
What the hell was I looking there?
Maybe the end of planet Earth?

All is lost during the useless fight
And they are cancelling all our civilization,
Now the apocalypse has come.
They come here just to destroy our kind.
Bending the space-time they've come to protect our wonderful Land.

[Chorus:]
To the wild we shall return
All of our world will be burnt
So we hide in the jungle,
Thinking 'bout the end
Of our old life and all it meant
Living the "Human Reset"!

Look at the hordes of survivors run
Escaping from the shots!

They know that we don't deserve nothing, but to be considered some grubs.
So this is the reason why they're goin' to smashing us tonight!

All is lost during the useless fight
And they are cancelling all our civilization,
Now the apocalypse has come.
They come here just to destroy our kind.
They have well understood that we're just a cancer
For the Universe.

[Chorus:]
To the wild we shall return
All of our world will be burnt
So we hide in the jungle,
Thinking 'bout the end
Of our old life and all it meant
Living the "Human Reset"!

We've had good warnings,
Many clues in our daily life.
We've been at crossroad, we got wrong...
Now we pay.
There's no use to fight,
But few will get their second chance:
Day after day after years they will find a way out to get balance with life.

[Chorus x2:]
To the wild we shall return
All of our world will be burnt
So we hide in the jungle,
Thinking 'bout the end
Of our old life and all it meant
Living the "Human Reset"!

We don't fall!
Save your souls!
Everybody'll die here!
We'll stay here!
We're your fear!
Human Race's fucked up!
