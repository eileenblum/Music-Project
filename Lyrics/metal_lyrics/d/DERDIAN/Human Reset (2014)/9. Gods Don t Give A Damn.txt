What would you think
If two hundred fifty thousand years on Earth
Could tell you why
Popular beliefs, including all religions, myths and rites, they were a lie?

Now we live a life so steeped in materiality,
We don't care about all these gods,
But we all make a mistake
Our beliefs lead us to guess they are somewhere watching us,
But now you know what's true:

[Chorus:]
Gods don't give a damn,
And you should learn this revelation now!
Someone could say that my soul will burn,
'Cause few will show the courage to admit this great truth today!

Hordes of priests are gathering,
Barking like wild dogs,
They call them prayers... Nonsense words!
They claim to have the keys for their promised heaven
And they own believers heart.

Guys, d'you really think that they care about choirs you sing
In your holy stony temples?
The binding of trinity is broken, let they live,
Without human interference.
Yeah, they don't care!

[Chorus:]
Gods don't give a damn,
And you should learn this revelation now!
Someone could say that my soul will burn,
'Cause few will show the courage to admit this great truth today!

Gods don't care 'bout
Gods don't care!

Guys, d'you really think that they care about choirs you sing
In your holy stony temples?
The binding of trinity is broken, let they live,
Without human interference.
Yeah, they don't care!

[Chorus:]
Gods don't give a damn,
And you should learn this revelation now!
Someone could say that my soul will burn,
'Cause few will show the courage to admit this great truth today!

Gods don't give a damn
You should learn, you should learn
(Gods don't care!)
'Cause few will show the courage to admit this great truth today!

Whoa! Hey!
