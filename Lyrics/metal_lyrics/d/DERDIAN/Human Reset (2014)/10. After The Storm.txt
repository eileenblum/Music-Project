Gray, a wall of gray rain on all I can see.
Rivers of water everywhere
And all around.
Rubble are floating on the road towards the sea.
Rain is still falling on the ground.

And I'm ready to fight!
'Cause I'm here still alive!

[Chorus:]
When the sun will rise,
And my life begins again
I get out of all this pain,
I'm not here to die!
When my heart will cry,
I will never lose my way,
But I won't forget the day
When the storm has come
To blind the sky.

Rage.
I can do nothing more than what I have made.
I feel so shaken,
I feel so cold.

And I'm talking alone,
Chasing echoes fill my soul, oh.
I don't have nothing more
To say after the storm...
Yeah!

[Chorus 2x:]
When the sun will rise,
And my life begins again
I get out of all this pain,
I'm not here to die!
When my heart will cry,
I will never lose my way,
But I won't forget the day
When the storm has come
To blind the sky.

After the storm...
