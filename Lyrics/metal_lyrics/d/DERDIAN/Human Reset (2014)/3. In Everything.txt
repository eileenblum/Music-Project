Every night I feel your spirit wondering
And through the dark I hear your voice is calling me.
I felt pure joy when you were close to me,
But now you're gone, leaving a blade inside my soul.

No defence when you meet your destiny
You have to try to make it great until you live!
All the persons here are different to me,
But anyone, I'm sure, will never touch the sun.

Then I will try to find a light for my eyes to shine,
A light to keep your smile exposed in my mind.

Now you are closed behind a door,
In a place with no return.
I can't cry for you anymore.

[Chorus:]
You are in everything,
You are inside of me and make me feel so lucky in everyday I live.
I'm learning to be strong,
I know the path is long,
But I've found in you a reason to be here.
You are in every dream,
You are in every scream,
Because I've got a broken heart that I can't heal.
The sorrow's left behind
And I am here to find
Another day to rise again and live this life!

L'eco del tuo addio
Si fa voce in me:
Lieve come un ticchettio
Batte qui sull' anima.
Anche se debole suona limpida,
CosÃ¬ tangibile, ma tu non ci sei...
Al di lÃ  dei limiti del Tempo vai.
Dove niente fu e nulla sarÃ  mai,
E lo stesso Universo non ha alcun senso...

[Chorus:]
You are in everything,
You are inside of me and make me feel so lucky in everyday I live.
I'm learning to be strong,
I know the path is long,
But I've found in you a reason to be here.
You are in every dream,
You are in every scream!
Because I've got a broken heart that I can't heal.
The sorrow's left behind
And I am here to find
Another day to rise again and live this life!
