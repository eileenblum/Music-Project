How many years have gone
Lean on each other for
Making our own world
Something supposed to be
Stronger than anything
Built on solid stone
All that was not so good
Seemed to leave my own mood
Everything's been perfect until now
You broke the balance, tell how!

How you've been able to destroy in a way so rude
Our superb life?
Crying, I ask myself
If you've got just a half reason,
Oh, my wife.

For your choice, maybe you heard a voice in your mind acting behind
Tell me why you've destroyed our life!

Maybe you don't know that I am so strong anyway
I will not cry a river for your loss any day
Di nuova luce gli occhi si illuminano giÃ 

[Chorus:]
I will break the wall of suffering
I will show my magic wings
I'll be able to fly away from here
The absolute power I feel!

"We'll make you feeling free,
Even without her! Even without her!
We'll help you believe there is a loophole, you will forget her!
It will be enough for you to be busy on what you believe
Follow your dreams until you will be free!"

[Chorus:]
I will break the wall of suffering
I will show my magic wings
I'll be able to fly away from here
The absolute power I feel!

"We'll make you feeling free,
Even without her! Even without her!
We'll help you believe there is a loophole, you will forget!"
