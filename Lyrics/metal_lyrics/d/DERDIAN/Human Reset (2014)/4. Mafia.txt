He's sitting in his golden chair with a cigarette.
Snakes of smoke float in the dense air and witness on the affair.
He pulls his head up from the desk
And talked with the men waiting orders there:

"The Power calls power, the ways are irrelevant...
Our tentacles crawl in the folds of the law to Parliament.
So my dear, it's the time
The day is near, pay the right!
Move your pawns!
Every home...
We have to go on!"

[Chorus:]
So go out and spread clear my name
Ease the way to seep into their souls
I know you'll be persuasive
People use to call it Mafia,
Better call it "Honoured Inc."
Time to be strong
Any other way... So damn wrong!

The men leave the room in a hurry, they seem to run.
The suspicious boss notices that and pulls out his little gun,
But the blood cannot stain both his hands and his name,
Someone else shall see to those unfaithful guys.

[Chorus 2x:]
So go out and spread clear my name
Ease the way to seep into their souls
I know you'll be persuasive
People use to call it Mafia,
Better call it "Honoured Family"
Time to be strong
The Election's Day can't go wrong! Wrong!
