[Music: Pistolese - Lyrics: Pistolese]

Lost I was wandering through the shades of night
Searching for answers that no man will find
Then a revelation came and lit my mind
A new way to live life came to light

Some strange new emotions are surrounding me
New hopes and new aims are yet obscuring fears
I stay here alone to face this world unreal
"Hey hey" screams of new forces in my heart
Born from hate

[Chorus:]
Here we are
To face the challenge of a painful hurt
I've never thought that this would be so easy
Drive my phantoms away
Heal my soul
Give me the strength to break all walls
A brighter shining world you're going to create here
Take my memories away!

As an explosion I felt emptiness
Digging a grave in my trembling certainties
Lost in a dimension that I didn't know
I had to find the courage, anything more

It seemed that my future would have only brought me shit
I passed through my soul's storms and I chased my fear
I stay here alone to face this world unreal

Screams of new forces in my heart
Born from my heart

[Chorus]

I have left my old way
I turned the page to reach a better time
As a breeze in this dawn
I feel that sometime's moving all was still inside
All is clear,
My past fears
Depended on the apprehasions to be inadequate!
Face in the wind I'll fight
The struggles of this quest that we call life!

[Chorus]
