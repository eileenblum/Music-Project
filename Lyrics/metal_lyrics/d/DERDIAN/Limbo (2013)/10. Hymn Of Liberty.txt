[Music: Garau, Radaelli, Giordano - Lyrics: Giordano]

I'm here alone searching for a new life
There are too many things so wrong
There are too many lies
And everything I do
I try to be myself
No one can change me, this is my only way

Run out of time
Run in the wind
This is the place where I would like to be
Try to survive without selling my soul
'Cause I won't live
Eternally

People say black
People say white
No one can guess what's the color of my life
Someone says I am right someone I'm wrong
Fuck yourself, leave me alone

Still carry on
Still singing my old song
Mourning for the agony of the world
In every word I say I try to be myself
No one can change me, this is my only way

[Chorus:]
Now wake up and hear my scream
This is a hymn, a hymn of liberty
Ten thousand voices sing against their destiny
We'll sing it loud and loud and loud
God will say: "I"ve got enough"
Stop your sleeping now and set us free
Forever run and run and run and run away
People have to pray
The world is going to fail
Maybe your memories have gone
Don't waste your time no more
to live this life is like to fight a war
I am here to live my life
Step by step straight to the end
Life or death will take me high
Strong and never scared

Motion for every emotion
For every emotion I will live
Motion for every emotion
I've no emotions to forgive

[Chorus]
