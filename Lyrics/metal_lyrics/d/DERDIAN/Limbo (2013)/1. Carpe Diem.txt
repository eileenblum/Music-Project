[Music: Garau, Pistolese - Lyrics: Pistolese]

Mind explosion
Without reason
The beginning
Of a new season

Let the music take your spirit
Let a great emotion overcome it
Living on a tightrope I will build a better life!

Tell me why I've to live as a poor man
Doing things I don't care,
Doing things I hate!
Dying dying every day switching off
My mind
People empty inside survives in the world

But if you think
Life is one and you won't surely live
Forever as a highlander in a dream
You will begin
To consider every single day
As your last step
Along the way!
