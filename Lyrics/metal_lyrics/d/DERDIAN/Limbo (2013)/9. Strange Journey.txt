[Music: Garau - Lyrics: Giordano]

I am sure I've lost the way
Through the dark maze of my mind
Like a demon in disguise
It's the price I have to pay
Nothing now can take a form
I see the music with my eyes
Since the time when I was born
That was my sacrifice
I never found a way to do
Wherever I may fly
Wherever I may die
A melody I'll find
In every single word
In every place I'm going
In every moment that will seem so long

[Chorus:]
I'm traveling
Between the dark and light
It seems to be alright
I'm traveling my past life
And will continue
Traveling
I see some shadows there
The end is near, I bet
The sharp sound of my steps
Is touched by the rain
This life won't be in vain

I don't know if I'll be scared
All my fears will leave me in harmony
With every emotion

Maybe I should take my time
Waiting till I feel the pain
Trying to write some good rhymes
Who can stop this rain?

I never found a way to go
Where I may fly
Wherever I may die
A melody I'll find
In every single word
In every place I'm going
In every moment that will seem so long

[Chorus]

Now the door's unlocked
I'm looking for a window
There's a mother holding tight her child

All my dreams are broken
Climbing weeping willows
I feel I could go insane

[Chorus]
