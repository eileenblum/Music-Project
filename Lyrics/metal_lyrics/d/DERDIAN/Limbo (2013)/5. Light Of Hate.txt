[Music: Pistolese - Lyrics: Pistolese]

Memories came out
Emerging from my lucid dreams
Vivid like I was thrown back to that bloody scene

Just like a time bomb ready to explode
A shrapnel of violence
He used to beat me and my mother, animal

When I recall that damned day I try to repress
And keep in my mind all that I have done without regrets

[Chorus:]
My eyes were staring into space
The light of hate threw shades on my face
Witness of childhood unfair
The reason to live
Was vengeance for me and for her
My soul's crying out for revenge

Fucking asylum
You're just the link to
My dark and tragic past
In smoky pictures I'm perveiving him behind her
I took a bottle of his own jack
Blinded by my hate
I broke and strongly sticked it deep in his neck

When I recall that damned day I try to repress
And keep in my mind all that I have done without regrets

[Chorus]

I'm cryin' out for revenge
I am cryin' out

[Chorus]
