[Music: Garau - Lyrics: Garau]

I don't know who I am
I'm trying to understand
But ain't no answer to my wondering

I'm living, believeing
In something, but I need
To know the reason of my life

And what I'm searching for
Lays hidden behind the door
Where dreams and reality are fighting day by day
It's something I can't explain
Like I didn't have a name
I'm trying to find what's left behind in my own way

[Chorus:]
I can see by the light of day and night
All I coud ever need in my life
I will follow the path
Of my heart
I will be in a world apart.
Forever in the dark!

And I'll never walk alone
I'll know what is right or wrong
And time after time I'll change my way to see the world
I know that behind the clouds
The sun keep on burning bright
And no one of us could ever stop to feel inside

[Chorus]

I see the shadows everywhere
It doesn't mean that I've failed
I will leave all sorrows
Waiting for tomorrow
This is the product of my life
And I am here to pay the price
Cause I'm forever bound into the dark

And what I'm looking for
Lays hidden behind the door
Where dreams and reality are fighting day by day
It's something I can't explain
Like I didn't have a name
I'm trying to find what's left behind in my own way

[Chorus]
