[Music: Garau - Lyrics: Garau]

By the white and pale moonlight
I can see the sweetest smile
That has cleared the shades I passed through

Maybe there's a better life
But I'm sure, no better than mine
'Cause I share my destiny with you

No time to cry
No time to die
Until I'll be there
There will be no place
Safer than your arms
Let me hold your dreams

[Chorus:]
You from my fantasy
I feel you deep in my soul
No way to divide our faiths
Now we're bound
Memories will stay in a time left behind
You made my fantasy
And I won't leave you anymore
I do believe in us, cause I'm in love
And I will reign in the kingdom of your heart

No time to cry
No time to die
Until I'll be there
There will be no place
Safer than your arms
Let me hold your dreams

[Chorus]:
You made my fantasy
I feel you deep in my soul
No way to divide our faiths
Now we're bound
Memories will stay in a time left behind
You made my fantasy
And I won't leave you anymore
I do believe in us, cause I'm in love
And I will reign in the kingdom of your heart
