[Music: Pistolese - Lyrics: Pistolese, Giannini]

How many hands hold the world, who knows?
What's the kind of future planned for us
Whoever told the naked truth 'bout wars
They're controlling every media!

Do you really trust their lies
Would you know the facts by their words
Masses forced to consent to their crimes
This is what they're looking for

As I'm watching all these TV lies
Sometimes I wish I could find a new planet to live
They're manipulating us with fears
And they know all they're the worst criminals in this old world
Open your mind, wake up from your dreams

[Chorus:]
Terror's behind everything you don't know man
The most diffused fear a man feels today
You can imagine
What they are planning for
Human race and nothing is sure

But they're plotting other wars

They play on the archtypes of fear
Enslaving who could make them fall
What's the reason
To be here?
Slaves of decisions from above
Terrorism is a painful way
To shift the focus from their evil business on world
But their criminal intents are clear
Don't let them split up the spoils of their financial games
Open your eyes, wake up from your dreams

[Chorus]

Their corruption's as deep as the abyss
I am staring at their poisoned soul from
I will stay there just observing them
Drowning slowly in their dirty hell!

Now something's crawling right out in the streets
People are tired and rebellion is near
Anger is mashing the patience we had until now
And we will find a way out from our cage
Free thoughts will cut all the chains of our mind
Let's try to erase them from history
Cause the price
Is life

[Chorus]

Their corruption's as deep as the abyss
I am staring at their poisoned soul from
I will stay there just observing them
Drowning slowly in their dirty hell!

I'm declaring my own way
