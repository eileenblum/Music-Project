[Music: Pistolese, Garau - Lyrics: Pistolese, Giannini]

I had a job I had a good steady fat salary
I used to live my trivial life day after day
Then I heard a voice that whispered
"La liberta da un'iniqua societa
Non E' un dono che puoi rifiutare"
I opened my eyes and found a world
Completely different
Was I sleeping at that time?

I used to hear my past life
Was a tribute to excellence
And everybody got to say: "What a lucky guy"
Do you still believe now that a
Life at a desk is appealing why don't ask
To yourself if here you can get more...

Ho aperto I miei occhi E ho visto che
La vita E' una sola
Non voglio viverla cosi!

[Chorus]
In your life you decide what you want to do
If you want a dragon life or live like a fool
Take your time, Choice's not mine,
Sometimes neither yours
Fate will open all the doors
The dragon life, of course!

One day I got a call from a long distant friend
He said "Stop", drop everything!
We must leave tomorrow for a tour from
New York till the land of rising sun
Say "Goodbye my friends I reach out my destiny"

And now it's time to live my dreams and
Leave it all behind
Will I be brave to touch the sky

[Chorus]
