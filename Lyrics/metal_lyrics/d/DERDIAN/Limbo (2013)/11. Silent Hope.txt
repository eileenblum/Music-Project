[Music: Garau - Lyrics: Pistolese]

Take a look at the fulcrum of this crisis
Billions of lives sold at the lowest prices
We're facing times without a soul
Morality and law
How can our life relies on the brokers' greedy claws?

Look at the fake wealth made by Wall Street
We're hanging on at the noose of stock exchanges
We're at the mercy of few men
Which aims is own the world
Who doesn't give a damn of planet's destiny

The silent hope is lost
The people now have gone
The brain does not think anymore
The silent hope is lost
The people now have gone
The poverty goes on and on
The silent hope is lost
THe people now have gone
The brain does not think anymore
The silent hope is lost
And we have to go on and on

[Chorus:]
The silent hope in me is rising
These angry verses I sing
Against this damned world!
My patience now is less than my hate
I'm ready to break my crate
To snap this rugged chord

Take a look at the slums of megalopolis
Millions of useless beetles without faces
Exploited for few dirty coins
Deprived of dignity,
Human being turned into a mask of agony

[Chorus]

Tired we go on and on and on trsuting in you (Trusting in you)
Our hopes won't fade a wiser generation gotta come (It's gonna come)
By now we are nothing but numbers and pawns (Numbers and pawns)
We'll be slaves for long time

[Chorus]
