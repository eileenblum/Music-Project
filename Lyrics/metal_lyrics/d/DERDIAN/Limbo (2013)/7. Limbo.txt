[Music: Pistolese - Lyrics: Pistoelse]

I am walking all alone at night
Around the borders of my mind
Thinking my life is suspended somewhere
Hidden into a 9 to 5 lair

Destinations of a long voyage
Every leg ain't an hommage
And the meaning sometime's lost
What remains is just the cost.
Into limbo
Living in the middle of a double nature
Feeling controlled
By an entity which gives you instructions
For your aimless life.

I have not been able
To reach a goal in my own life
My ship sails against the bad luck winds
And the crew is cursing my name

Into a damned grey limbo
I will ride the eagle of my doubts
Wondering for eternity
Waiting for a turn

[Chorus:]
I feel so strange now
Years that run like hours
Into a limbo
On a razor's blade
The coin will fall
And faith will choose for us
Just imagine if you could
Live the life you were born for
Double energy you would invest
In everything your painful heart will ask for

Listen to the voice into your soul
Your daily life will throw you in a hole
We survive just for the dreams we've grown
Welcome in this fucking world!

The veils of
Reality are floating by
Disclosing
The liquid world I'm going to find
A dimension of pure dream

[Chorus]
