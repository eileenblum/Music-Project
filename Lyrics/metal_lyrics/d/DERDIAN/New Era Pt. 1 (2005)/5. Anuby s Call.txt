[Music and Lyrics by Enrico Pistolese]

Preserved in time
I was enslaved to an ancient power
I must obey
Obey your voice inside of me

I will rise from the grave
Slave to your recall my master
Acolytes celebrate the rite
In the dark of my ancient tomb

I feel the blood
Run inside my veins again
I hear your call
In the silence of my mind

And the air is full of screams
I see your face before my eyes
Torches blaze bright in the night
Slaves invoke your sacred name

The pyramid
Preserved my cursed soul forever
And I Awake
From my eternal sleep of darkness

I will serve you again my lord
Slave once again to your power
My wait have lasted aeons
Now the time to rise has come
