[Music and Lyrics by Marco Garau]

Behind the stars I can see all my life
Time disappears and leaves this lonely night
I'll stay with you to see our first sunrise
So I can feel the sadness inside your eyes

I feel paralyzed
When the moon reflects your smile
Keep the flame alive
Inside my heart

UNDER THE SUN I CLOSE MY EYES
UNDER THE SHADOWS OF MY CRIMES
I'LL STAY WITH YOU, LOREN, FOREVER
OPEN YOUR HEART OPEN YOUR MIND
DON'T LET ME HIDE, BEHIND YOUR LIFE
INTO THIS WORLD, INTO THIS HEAVEN
WHERE I CAN FLY

I've lost myself to find another way
Out of my shell there is a lot of pain
I can't forget memories of yesterday
Only time can take it all away

Waiting for a new day
Now I've found my only way
Let me see your reign
Lady of my heart

[CHORUS]
