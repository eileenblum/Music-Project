[Music and Lyrics by Enrico Pistolese]

Our march advances for death and cruelty
Black mountains placed herself against our tiring walk
The land under our feet begins to tremble now
(Is it) the fury of the gods or what?

And we continue our journey to the viking land
We cross the mountain and we're blinded by a strong glare
The valley shows the ring of green and woody mountains
The Crystal lake before our eyes

[CHORUS:]
UNDER THE SURFACE OF SHINING COLD ICE
FALLEN WARLORDS UNDER OUR GLANCE
FEAR IN THEIR EYES
MY FRIENDS, ARE YOU READY FOR THIS BLOODSHED?
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL PREVAIL
AGAINST THE RAGE OF THE OPPOSITE GODS

Suddenly loud screams ring in the open air
We form a circle in the centre of the lake
"This rumble comes from the woods" says Troghlor
"The ice is breakin'!"
And from the mountains a horde of warriors comes
Sadist grin on our face, they're not gods but just men!
Huge clash between us, our army will prevail
Their heads are falling down!

[CHORUS:]
UNDER THE SURFACE OF SHINING COLD ICE
FALLEN WARLORDS UNDER OUR GLANCE
FEAR IN THEIR EYES
MY FRIENDS, ARE YOU READY FOR THIS BLOODSHED?
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL PREVAIL
AGAINST THE RAGE OF THE OPPOSITE GODS
