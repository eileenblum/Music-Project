[Music and Lyrics by Enrico Pistolese]

Into the battle I can see your face in slime
Hey lord! your soul is mine
You lost, and now my sword is very near
My sneer, last thing you'll hear
All your fellows runaway from here my guy
Vile race of coward men!

[CHORUS:]
ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE RUNNING AWAY
HEAR THEIR SCREAMS OF AGONY
YOUR HEART IS BEATING FOR FEAR
IN THE NAME OF HOLY WALLS
WITH A BLADE OF SACRED STEEL
I'LL CRUSH YOUR USELESS LIFE

War my name, black my life, I'm bad, my friend
I'm lord of suffering
Oh survivor of white lands, your fortress is mine
Your gods will honour me
All your fellows runaway from here my guy
Your race will die for me

[CHORUS]

Evil in my veins
Infect your bloody lands
I'm cancer of your destiny
I'll celebrate your end

[CHORUS]
