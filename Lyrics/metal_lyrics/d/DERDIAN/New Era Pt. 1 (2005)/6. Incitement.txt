[Music and Lyrics by Enrico Pistolese]

Blood and fire rage forever
It's Essential for true battle
Furious war. Our swords of steel prevails
Evil oh oh Master of these tales

Warriors are meeting up and
They are talking 'bout the war
Cruelty and atrocity reward
Our Lord announces that
Federland is in rivolt
Bloody sneer appear upon our faces

We will rush ourselves into the war
Neverending fight:our reward
You're rebellion we'll annihilate
Your behaviour soon will meet its fate

[CHORUS:]
RUN AND KILL THEIR LORD
WE WILL CRASH THEIR BONES
MIGHTY WARRIORS HOLD THEIR HEADS UP HIGH
ISLAND'S KING LIES THERE
HE'S DEAD AND YOUR FEAR
WILL BE OUR VICTORY!

Wake up my disciples
We must go to Federland
Tell me that you're ready for the war!
Want you see evil and pain
Vassal, bring here swords and chains!
They will pay for their offence tonight

Master's words will bring us satisfaction
Castle's walls will tremble for our screams
Black profiles brandish pointed spears
Red and Yellow eyes grin in the dark

[CHORUS]

Now let's take our ships, guys!
Let's go to destroy Federland
Retaliation comes from the sky
Let's bridle our horses
Wanna see hate in your eyes
Lower the draw bridge 'cause we must go

HEROES!!
