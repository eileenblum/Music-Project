[Music and Lyrics by Marco Garau]

Can you see the stars?
I want to go in the space to find another world
Following the voices of my soul
I will come to you my only God

Waiting for the time when I can't see your open eyes
But I will find the way to change my broken life

TAKE MY WAY
AND TOGETHER WE WILL RIDE THE SKY
WHERE I'LL PLAY IN THE SHADOW OF THE NIGHT
FLY AWAY
AND FOREVER YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE
WE CAN WAIT FOR (THE) ETERNAL LIGHT!

There's no way to stop this cold machine
I will close my eyes with all my dreams
Night and day I'm waiting to be free
And I know there is only one key

Looking for the sky now I can see your open eyes
Let me become the death and everything will die

TAKE MY WAY
AND TOGETHER WE WILL RIDE THE SKY
WHERE I'LL PLAY IN THE SHADOW OF THE NIGHT
FLY AWAY
AND FOREVER YOU WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE
WE CAN WAIT FOR (THE) ETERNAL LIGHT!
