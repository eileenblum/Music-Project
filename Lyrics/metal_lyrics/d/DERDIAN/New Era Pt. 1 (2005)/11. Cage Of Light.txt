[Music and Lyrics by Marco Garau]

Day by day I can see the destruction
Turn to grey all this world full of gore
And I feel I've got no satisfaction
In this game where I'm the one

I call your name, and you spring out on the road, I wait [for] you
While the rage of gods racing out seeking for you

[CHORUS:]
SO I FLY, RAISING THE STRENGTH OF MEN'S EVIL TONIGHT
I SPREAD THE GATES OF THE HUMAN'S PRIDE
FORSAKE YOUR FACE IN THE MIRROR
AND TRY TO TAKE MY HAND IN THIS CAGE OF LIGHT

Age by age I have seen mighty warriors
Look at me with confusion and fear
Everything that I've found in their sorrow
I'm death , they knew I was near
Follow me hold I'll show you misery, to please you
Let me take your life, I celebrate my victory

[CHORUS:]
SO I FLY, RAISING THE STRENGTH OF MEN'S EVIL TONIGHT
I SPREAD THE GATES OF THE HUMAN'S PRIDE
FORSAKE YOUR FACE IN THE MIRROR
AND TRY TO TAKE MY HAND IN THIS CAGE OF LIGHT

Into this cage I'm lurking in the night
Another day gone by there is no change in sight
I have no home, I'm wondering around
Cause there ain't no peace in this cage of light

[CHORUS]
