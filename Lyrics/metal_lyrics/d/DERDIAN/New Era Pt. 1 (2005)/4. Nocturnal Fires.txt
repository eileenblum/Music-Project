[Music and Lyrics by Marco Garau]

My escape from prison
Was a disgrace for them
Astar sentences my treason
I don't care about them

Death for the human race
They'll repent their effrontery now
I've covered many miles
Here you are Lorvath mountains, at last

Oh Oh! In the name of evilness
Come with me to kill their king
Now, Now
Their civilization ends
They will lose their memories

[CHORUS:]
I WILL FLY ON THE WINGS OF ETERNITY
I WILL FLY ON THE WINGS OF YOUR DEATH
HOLY STEEL, OUR LAW IS FOREVER
AND OUR FORTRESS WILL RISE ON THIS HELL

I remember these moments
Pleasing point of my life
Death those bastard discovered!
Oh I worship my crimes

Is this the only way
To become strong and mighty as a god?
Yes I will state my friends
and the fires will prove I am cruel!

Oh Oh! In the name of evilness
Come with me to kill their king
Now, Now
Their civilization ends
They will lose their memories

[CHORUS:]
I WILL FLY ON THE WINGS OF ETERNITY
I WILL FLY ON THE WINGS OF YOUR DEATH
HOLY STEEL, OUR LAW IS FOREVER
AND OUR FORTRESS WILL RISE ON THIS HELL
