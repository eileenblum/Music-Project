Without your men
you're just a second - rate coward
Looking to them you think to be strong and sly

You try to be a real man
But if I look your hands
I see you' re trembling; you have to bend!

Burn! Save up your wonder
save up your wonder
Know you will come under!
Know you will come under
Future of losers has an end
Fall! under my army
under my army
The events are turning!
events are turning
I sign this page of Astar staining with blood

Astar on fire, the flame is burning higher
Your men in battle scream, trusting in victory!
Scream out your fear 'cause today you will die here
And everything will end
I'll look into your eyes your people burn!

Toward your destiny I run!
Taking your life Astar will be mine and then
Derdian will have these lands
And I will wash my hands
In the dark blood of all your men!

Burn! Save up your wonder
save up your wonder
Know you will come under!
Know you will come under
Future of losers has an end
Fall! under my army
under my army
The events are turning!
events are turning
I sign this page of Astar staining with blood

Astar on fire, the flame is burning higher
Your men in battle scream, trusting in victory!
Scream out your fear 'cause today you will die here
And everything will end
I'll look into your eyes your people burn!

Haec pugna admonet tuam ignaviam
Et ego qui gestat terrorem sum tibi!

Astar on fire, the flame is burning higher
Your men in battle scream, trusting in victory!
Scream out your fear 'cause today you will die here
And everything will end
I'll look into your eyes your people burn!
