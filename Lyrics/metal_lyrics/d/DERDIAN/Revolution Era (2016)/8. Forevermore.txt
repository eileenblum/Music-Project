Everyday I stay behind the window of the world.
All the times you are inside my fantasy
Run away far from your life or rise again so strong?
I can see you turn around my destiny

Now I want a chance to tell you
What I feel inside

Forevermore
I will try to take your heart
I won't close the door
Every night I'll wait the time to come
And now I fall
In the silence of my life
Looking for your eyes
Till the end of time, forevermore

I would like to change the time and bring you your true soul
But I see your eyes, thereâs so much emptyness
Throglor is your biggest ruin, and now you play your role
And forever you will show your thankfullness

Now another chance to tell you
What I feel inside

Forevermore
I will try to take your heart
I won't close the door
Every night I'll wait the time to come
And now I fall
In the silence of my life
Looking for your eyes
Till the end of time, forevermore.
