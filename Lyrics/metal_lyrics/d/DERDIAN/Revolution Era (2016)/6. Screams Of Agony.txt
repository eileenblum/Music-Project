Into the battle I can see your face in slime
Hey lord! your soul is mine
You lost, and now my sword is very near
My sneer, last thing you'll hear
All your fellows runaway from here my guy
Vile race of coward men!

All your friends are running away 
Hear their screams or agony 
Your heart is beating for fear 
In the name of holy walls 
With a blade of sacred steel 
I'll crush your useless life

War my name, black my life, I'm bad, my friend
I'm lord of suffering
Oh survivor of white lands, your fortress is mine
Your gods will honor me
All your fellows runaway from here my guy
Your race will die for me 

All your friends are running away 
Hear their screams or agony 
Your heart is beating for fear 
In the name of holy walls 
With a blade of sacred steel 
I'll crush your useless life

Evil in my veins
Infect your bloody lands
I'm cancer of your destiny
I'll celebrate your end

All your friends are running away 
Hear their screams or agony 
Your heart is beating for fear 
In the name of holy walls 
With a blade of sacred steel 
I'll crush your useless life.
