What I'm about to tell
Is just a story of injustice
When in a rainy night the Dark Lord capture me
He sent two warriors to kidnap me and to burn all of my life
I hardly understand the reason why

Golstar, come! 'Cause I can't resist here in this castle
I will die without your love!
I'm too scared, my love, I beg you now, come here!

I don't wanna die,
I wanna see you for one last time!
Come and save my life
'Cause in this cell I can't survive
Everyday I cry
Because your memory's too dear to me
I'm despairing for you
I beg you, come save me!

And my detention here
Will make me crazy and the fear
Is taking my soul
Is this situation real?
Believe me, Golstar, I still love you
And I will for all my life
Although my final hour is getting near

I can hear noises in the corridor
They are coming here!
Help me dear
They will kill me!
Oh, my God, I must be strong
Hold back my fear

I don't wanna die
I wanna see you for one last time!
Come and save my life
'Cause in this cell I can't survive
Everyday I cry
Because your memory's too dear to me
I'm despairing for you
I beg you, come save me!

[2x]
Your time's out, lady Loren
We're here to kill you
And say your prayers female
All that you fear's true!

You think that Golstar's rage will punish us
There's no way to beat the God of hate
Your weeping is so unuseful
Now accept your fate!

No, he doesn't want to die. [3x]

Open this cell!

They are here
I feel like fainting
Fear appears in my eyes
Terror stops the blood in my veins!
And my hope is fading
While they're telling me,
"Let us say Troghlor's will!"

[2x]
I don't wanna die
I wanna see you for one last time!
Come and save my life
'Cause in this cell I can't survive
Everyday I cry
Because your memory's too dear to me
I'm despairing for you
I beg you, come save me!

Oh, come save me!
Come save me!
Save me!
