I'm a valiant captain, Golstar is my name 
And I am the builder of this reign! 
Troghlor is my master, obedience I show 
All my life was branded by this law 

But now a new era is rising from dust of the war 
The rebellion takes my soul! 
This is the time to change and think about all our
goals 
It's the time for peace, my lord. 

Hey! Stop now this war 
âCause a new era is rising now, 
We have to reverse 
Your plans of power on your people 
Hey, bloody Milord 
We need a turning point, You know. 
Blood closes our eyes. 
And lock our bodies in a gelid vault! 

So this is the reason for my new relationship: 
to defeat my Master I'm too weak! 
Exenthar will help me to conspire against his reign 
I'll blow out his power like a flame 

I find it hard to believe your kingdom will survive 
An empire based on a lie! 
And in few years of power you'll kill all your men 
To peace my mind I bend! 

Hey! Stop now this war 
âCause a new era is rising now, 
We have to reverse 
Your plans of power on your people 
Hey, bloody Milord 
We need a turning point, You know. 
Blood closes our eyes. 
And lock our bodies in a gelid vault.
