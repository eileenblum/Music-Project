New chapter of the story
Beginning of the glory
Forever and ever
I'll never lose my mind
And for eternity
I have to crown my dreams

The door of fate is open
Your legacy is broken
Forever and ever
Your spirit will fly again
Beyond eternity
She'll drown in pain

Oh my god, I am the lord of cruelty and war
Let me fall in your divine embrace
To rive their revolts

Everyday in all the way their kingdoms will be won
In a state of grace where I can fly
Prophecy has begun

And now I'm ready for
Another bloody war
I will outrage the immortal's lair

No one should know I have
The secrets of the spell
To override the Golstar's rage

Forever I'll close your eyes
Daytime now has come to die
And now you deserve for all your lifetime
Misery and pain

One day you got in my way
But you can't escape the fate
Betrayers will fall
And they will kneel here
To the Lord of War

Ride my friends, ride on these lands
Beyond the crystal lake
By the way they knew there was a price
Now it's time to pay

In the darkness of your life
Nocturnal fire's bright
Is the light of death getting nearby
Do not ask me why

And now I'm ready for
Another bloody war
I will outrage the immortal's lair

No one should know I have
The secrets of the spell
To override the Golstar's rage

Forever I'll close your eyes
Daytime now has come to die
And now you deserve for all your lifetime
Misery and pain

One day you got in my way
But you can't escape the fate
Betrayers will fall
And they will kneel here
To the Lord of War

And now I'm ready for
Another bloody war
The time has come for me to bring
The apocalypse of God

Everyone who dies for
Glory is the reward
Enemies will follow
Waiting for the Anubi's call

Everyone will die for 
The war of the gods
Fight and die for Derdian
Astar won't rise anymore
