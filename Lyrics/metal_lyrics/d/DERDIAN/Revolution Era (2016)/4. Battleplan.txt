The battle plan closed in my hands
I have already made to conquer all these lands
Will be released by tonight
Constraining Exentar to fight

What I've prepared is just unfair
But I don't care about it 'cause my goal's prevail
The Astar's fall and death for all, my role
Defeating him I get control.

My rising force sets off my wars
And his behaviour is so false
To make me nervous and to ruin his goals
No pity, no escape but a battle upon him!

I've got a plan to trick Lord Exenthar
He's daring to obscure my fame
He'll try the rage
He'll try the hate
I need to impede his fate

I will propose a false alliance
Deceiving my enemy and then
Will be a surprise
My crowd will rise
He nevermore will see the light
He nevermore will see the light!

I don't know why he said to be
A friend of mine, an old allied
I don't remember who is he
I only know he's just my enemy!

I'll simulate to be whom says
And at the end he will be in a maze
Just wanna see the blood upon his face
Just wanna cause the extinction of his race!

I'll call him in a golden town
To make new peace, I have been around!
Instead I'll wait for him in the Derdian gorge
No pity, no escape but a battle upon him!

I've got a plan to trick Lord Exenthar
He's daring to obscure my fame
He'll try the rage
He'll try the hate
I need to impede his fate

I will propose a false alliance
Deceiving my enemy and then
Will be a surprise
My crowd will rise
He nevermore will see the light
He nevermore will see the light!
