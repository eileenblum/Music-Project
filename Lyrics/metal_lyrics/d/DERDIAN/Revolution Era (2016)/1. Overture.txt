People of Naxar 
Though I' m here to regenerate your lands 
I am your master 
And I'll need all the power of my friends! 

Living and Fighting Together 
Living and Fighting Forever 
Living and Fighting Wherever 
I am one with all your souls 

Under the rage of my fire 
I will transform your desires 
And I'll increase all my powers 
With the aid of my own God 

I'm the evil 
I can feel you 
I'm the demon of the night 
You can fight me 
And despise me 
But your destiny is signed 

Re-establishing this poise 
We can rule the world! 
Now I want to hear your voice 
Follow me and my sword

Dark clouds of war are now gathering on my land
