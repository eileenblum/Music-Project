One more attempt to trick my mind
Sending me a creature able to
To hamper my own life, my project

I firmly think now he's behind
This conspiracy but he's too weak
Forever I'll resist against him
What d'you wanna do the next time
Whom you want to send me again?
Woman, just a black rose
This has been your role
That brought you to fall
Let me say weren't wise
It's impossible you know
For your lord to rise!
Oh my dear enemy you know
What I just did to your sweet black rose
Died trying to make me fall in love
I found her just one month ago
Suffering and begging in an hole
To be saved and to be nursed
What d'you wanna do the next time
Whom you want to send me again?
Woman, just a black rose
This has been your role
That brought you to fall
Let me say weren't wise
It's impossible you know
For your lord to rise!
You'll never trick me no way have to rise
And to discover it look in my eyes
Woman, just a black rose
This has been your role
That brought you to fall
Let me say weren't wise
It's impossible you know
For your lord to rise!
