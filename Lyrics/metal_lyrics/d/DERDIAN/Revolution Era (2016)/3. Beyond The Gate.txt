While the night is coming
In this silent world
Darkness is my only friend
My reward for all

Searching for the future
Past is left behind
And I have some doubts into my mind

Time, I've spent (so) much time
To fly away without my mind
And now I know this is my only world!

I'll try to get a place into the sky
Beyond the gate I see the light
I wanna make my way tonight
Beyond the gate

Through this holy darkness
Moon will ride with me
I am lost in emptiness
And I've lost my dreams

Death is all around me
Fire burns inside
While the gate is shining in the night

Time, I need more time
To find my way beyond this life
Where is the key for entering this world?

I'll try to get a place into the sky
Beyond the gate I see the light
I wanna make my way tonight
Beyond the gate

I'll try to reach out (for) the other side
Where is the gate of space and time?
I wanna fly away tonight
Beyond the gate

[Solo]

Beyond the gate

I'll try and I will reach the other side
Where is the gate of space and time?
I wanna fly away tonight
Beyond the gate

And that's right
Together piercing to the sky
Beyond the gate I see the light
I wanna make my way tonight
I will try and I reach the other side
Where is the gate of space and time?
I wanna fly beyond the gate
