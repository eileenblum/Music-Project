Incubation ov boiling hooks, defiling the birth ov purity. There is poison within blood. Strength regained by an abomination.

Apathetic, emptiness...Farewell!
Shed your old skin in Hell.
Overdosed with decay...Farewell!
Shed your old skin in Hell.

The new sin...Forms alive!
A new form will arise!
The new sin...Forms alive!
To execute the woeful...The flesh shall die!

Thresholds open vile ways. A "Pandora" to release the dark-half. Blood forms a serpentine virus...Where no humans can pray!

The new sin...Forms alive!
A new form will arise!
The new sin...Forms alive!
To execute the woeful...The flesh shall die!

Farewell To The Flesh! [Repeat]

[This song is about the process ov turning something old into something new &amp; powerful. There is no time to dwell over a time where you felt weak nor should you destroy the god within over self loath. You shed the skin that holds you down &amp; create a new skin that is strong &amp; immortal. Destroy the old &amp; arise with the new. You are a vile king in your own kingdom.]
