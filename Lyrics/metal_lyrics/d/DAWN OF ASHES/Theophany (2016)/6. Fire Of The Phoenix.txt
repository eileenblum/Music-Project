Dawn!
Fire of the phoenix.
Resurrection in the cycle of alpha and omega.
Engraving a sigil that is prophesying the rebellion.
The sun that fell is the fire that will become again.
Pyre of rebirth, from life and death.
Bestowing the throne of this majestic power.

D.O.A. â this force that never dies.
D.O.A. â touching the flames of thousands of souls.
D.O.A. â this force that never dies.
D.O.A. â Elysium, show the path to regenerate.

Ashes!
That which once fell, shall grow into a life force.
Metamorphosis
Anthropomorphic.
Celestial DNA, born into god form.

Fire of the phoenix.
Sing this hymn that will never die.
Fire of the phoenix.
Burning forever in the millennium.
Fire of the phoenix.
Fire of the phoenix.
Fire of the phoenix.
Fire of the phoenix.

D.O.A. â this force that never dies.
D.O.A. â touching the flames of thousands of souls.
D.O.A. â this force that never dies.
D.O.A. â Elysium, show the path to regenerate.
