The horns point upward.
To ascend towards the strength of the divine.

Bringing power into spirit.
We are archons from an ancient time.

Call on your ancient winds.
To awaken the beast from slumber.
Call on your ancient winds.
The battle rages on against the Hebrew God.

Spill the blood of Yahweh.
Immolation of a monotheistic cult.

Shine down from the Venus star.
Resurrection of the first prototype.

Hear the drums from the tribe.
Hear the drums from the tribe.
Hear the drums from the tribe.
Hear the drums from the tribe.

We swallow the star.
We take control of the true light.

Smear the blood of the scriptures.
That were burned, pre-christianized.

Star shine down on sacred lands.
To reclaim the origins.
That were distorted.

Call on your ancient winds.
To awaken the beast from slumber.
Call on your ancient winds.
The battle rages on against the Hebrew God.

Hail, hail, hail, hail.
Smear the blood of the Hebrew God.
Hail, hail, hail, hail.
Hear the drums from the War God.

Spill the blood of Yahweh.
Immolation of a monotheistic cult.

Shine down from the Venus star.
Resurrection of the first prototype.
Hear the drums from the tribe.
Hear the drums from the tribe.
Hear the drums from the tribe.
Hear the drums from the tribe.
