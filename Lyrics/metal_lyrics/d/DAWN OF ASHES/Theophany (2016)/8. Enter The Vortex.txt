Seasons of decay, withering in limbo.
Blinded by the light from bi-polar frequencies in opposition.
Feeling the drifting of winter in the inner circle
And feel the thorns surrounding the cocoon in the
Subconscious mind

Choose your path and choose your kingdom.
Enter the vortex!
Choose your maker or choose your destroyer.
Enter the vortex!
Choose to be immortal and choose to be deified.
Enter the vortex!
Communion with the self and nurture your true will.
Enter the vortex!

Our wings emerge within the many directions from the
Cosmos.
For the power to lift the curse can be the power of freedom.
Extolled, in the blessings of holding a guided force.
Soul - detox by grasping control of this chaos.
Now free yourselves.

Enter the vortex!

Many who have misunderstood the path of completion always
Wander lost into the fog of oblivion.
Yearning for gratification towards walking into the portal of this grand euphoria.
Choose your path of clarity, or choose to become the subjection of failure.
Enter the vortex: take the throne of your
Own fucking hell.

Choose your path and choose your kingdom.
Enter the vortex!
Choose your maker or choose your destroyer.
Enter the vortex!
Choose to be immortal and choose to be deified.
Enter the vortex!
Communion with the self and nurture your true will.
Enter the vortex!
