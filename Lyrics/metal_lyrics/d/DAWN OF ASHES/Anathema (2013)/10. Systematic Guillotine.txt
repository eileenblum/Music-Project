I am a Faustus blade
Creating surgical termination
I am hope within you
A way to end yourself
I am anti-human
Fucking anti-purity
I am a God made in an unholy shell
A breathing vision of Hell

I am many and many am I
I am a stitch in a failed made line
Yeah, I am murder
Yeah, I am the end
Systematic Guillotine
I am many and many am I
I am a stitch in a failed made line
Yeah, I am murder
Yeah, I am the end

Systematic Guillotine [3x]

Come worship me
I am an insight of rape
Spreading your legs to fuck you with my disease
God damned me and I damned God back
Never believed in God
Only the God within me that made me hate you

I am the selfish fingertips
Breaking the spine
I am your imperfection
Force fed into their lives
I am an old drug
That numbs into an overdose
Twitching eyelids
Poisoned by a parasitic host

I am many and many am I
I am a stitch in a failed made line
Yeah, I am murder
Yeah, I am the end
Systematic Guillotine
I am many and many am I
I am a stitch in a failed made line
Yeah, I am murder
Yeah, I am the end

Systematic Guillotine [3x]
