There is a poison growing within temptation. And I feel it â¦
We dirty our hands with corruption &amp; deprivation . Do you feel it?...

Theater for the lacerated
Lusting for tyranny.
Getting off, getting off, getting off on the Devilâs ways.

Itâs all about the sex
Itâs all about the bloodshed.
Conjuring black magicâ¦yeah
Conjuring black magicâ¦yeah

And it feels so goodâ¦
And it feels so goodâ¦
And it feels so fucking goodâ¦
And it feels so fucking goodâ¦

Now Slit your moral wounds
and let it drain.
Now Slit your moral wounds
and recreate the pleasures of pain.

Tender, naked flesh being demoralizedâ¦ and I feel it â¦
Crushing a rose to only endure the thornsâ¦Do you feel it?
Spoiled so it becomes Impure.
Lusting for the void of it all.
Getting off, getting off, getting off by the Devilâs ways
