So many times when I'm strung out on you
And I'm fucking dead
So many times I fuck to erase you
You make me feel so fucking dead
I'm a form of lifeless abuse
Blood drawn from misery
I am used up, dried up abuse
I'm hooked on misery

This is self-abuse called "Morphine"
Yeah
Whore myself to this disease
And I'm fucking dead
Six months in isolation
Strapped down in misery
And I'm addicted to pills
Of emotionless pain
Ah Ah Ah-Oh [3x]
Yeah...

So many times when I'm strung out on you
Am I still breathing?
So many times I cripple for you
Forgot the meaning of living
I'm a form of lifeless abuse
Blood drawn in misery
Yeah
I am used up, dried up abuse
I'm hooked on this fucking misery
That's right...
Oh... [3x]

This is self abuse called "Morphine"
Yeah
Whore myself to this disease
And I'm fucking dead
Six months in isolation
Strapped down on misery
And I'm addicted to pills
Of emotionless pain
