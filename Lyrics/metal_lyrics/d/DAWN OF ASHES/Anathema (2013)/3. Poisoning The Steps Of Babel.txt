[feat. Nero Bellum]EPICUREAN SADISM, flaunting in devilry.
Rust in the sand, corrupting on this soil.
Spitting at the mark that sheers away from the holy.
Empyrean comaâ¦.
â¦.Blood of a martyrdom.

Possession.
Reborn.
Foreplay with sin.
Adorned with fire.
Possession.
Reborn.
Foreplay with sin.
Adorned with fire.

This fucking cross will weigh on your life
I'd rather be ridden with strife
I'd rather rip out my heart and
Have you drag my fucking ambition to Hell

Fist fuck the whore of Babylon
Fist fuck the whore of Babylon
Fist fuck the whore of Babylon
&amp; Poison the steps of Babel
Fist fuck the whore of Babylon
Fist fuck the whore of Babylon
Fist fuck the whore of Babylon
&amp; Poison the steps of Babel
