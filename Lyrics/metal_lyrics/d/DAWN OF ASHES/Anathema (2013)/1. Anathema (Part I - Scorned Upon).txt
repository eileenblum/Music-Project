Justification is like a womb
In which your social form of normality
Has been fucked so many times
Showing us asbolute no mercy
Towards putting the salt into the wounds
We are the true meaning of evil demise
Crowned with Supremacy
We bid you farewell
Because now you are the ones who shall be
Victimized
