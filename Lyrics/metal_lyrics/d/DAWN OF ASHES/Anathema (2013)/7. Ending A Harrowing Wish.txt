Self termination
Beating on the flesh again
Scraping at it to erase the pain
You got nothing to lose
God is an overdose
Picking at the abuse
Force fed with failures
You got nothing to lose

Ending a harrowing wish
A suicidal fall written on your list
This is the last minute before it ends
Caressing each memory
That will never amend
And you feel so dirty (yeah)
You ease when you bleed (yeah)
Now break to your knees

Self termination
Silencing the decrepit veins
Fucked by regrets
You got nothing to lose
Paralyzed strength
Welcoming the abuse
No salvation, only in emptiness
