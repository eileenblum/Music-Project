I am content to corrupt myself
To feed my own visions of hell
I am the first and I am the last
Apart from me, there is no God

Designed to end
Cold animation of idolatry
Impervious to the white light
Worship this blood
Designed to end
Hex of the lifeless one
Concealed from the white light
Worship this unholy blood

I burn right through you... like brimstone fire
I burn right through you...
I burn right through you... like brimstone fire
I burn right through you... foreboding desire

Designed to end
I was crowned to Apostatize
A breathing holocaust
Worship this blood
Designed to end
A god to hate all gods
A breathing holocaust
Worship this unholy blood

I burn right through you... like brimstone fire
I burn right through you...
I burn right through you... like brimstone fire
I burn right through you... foreboding desire
