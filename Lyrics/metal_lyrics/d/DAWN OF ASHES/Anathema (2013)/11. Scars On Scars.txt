[feat. Gary Zon of Dismantled]Scars on scars
Restless blades
Beating on our world in the end of days
Scars on scars
Crippling praise
Reflecting suicide for a new day

Scars on scars [3x]
Yeah...
Yeah...

Scars on scars [3x]

Do you know what I'm fucking feeling?
Do you know what I'm fucking feeling?
Do you know what I'm fucking feeling?
Do you fucking feel this?

Scars on scars
Imagery born in stains
Plagued inside a heart in the end of days
Scars on scars
These pills are killing me
No return from Hell
In the darkest days

Scars on scars [3x]
Yeah...
Yeah...

Scars on scars [3x]
