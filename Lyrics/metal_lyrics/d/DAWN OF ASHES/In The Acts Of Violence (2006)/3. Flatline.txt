Bounded, this hate grows colderSorrow eyes, black with murderErase the hope for mankindDamned in your broken liesSelf-reflect - the suffering bastardSelf-reflect - worthless discipleSelf-reflect - you suffering bastardSelf-reflect Face me - you're nothing to meYou'll see a damaged seedFace me - you're nothing to meIn this hell, you're just a disease
