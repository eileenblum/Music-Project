Medicate this violence rape my mindSettle these voices that make me killNo way to save meNo way to save me now Never freeNever healNever freeNever free from myself Can you help me?Strapped down to this painCan you help me?I don't want to live this way Take this virus awayTearing apart, against my ribcageNo way to save meNo way to save me now Never freeNever healNever freeNever free from myself
