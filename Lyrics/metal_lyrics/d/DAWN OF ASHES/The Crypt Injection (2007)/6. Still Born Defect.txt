The prayers are never forgiven.These saints are forced to sleep.A withered redemption.Scorn the final bits of faith.When, the silence takes control... When does this light end?When does this light end?When does this light end?When hope becomes the ancient. The still born defectDefiled and worthless.Surreal with redemption...Tear apart your grip on faith.When, the silence takes control...
