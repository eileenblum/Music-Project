Hailing... the sick fucking plague.Deceives the corpse, in a violent way.Holocaust... Spit the flames.Burn the flesh with disarray. No remorse... For the weak.Never amend, for the insects.Slit the scars of redemption...Hearth fails to beat.Heat fails to beat. It's the crypt that makes me cold.Makes me... makes me cold.
