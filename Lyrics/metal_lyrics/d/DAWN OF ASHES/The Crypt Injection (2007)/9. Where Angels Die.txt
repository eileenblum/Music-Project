Be welcomed, to the city of damned souls.Ories, bellowed... Screams be forgotten. Broken wings sorrow of the wounded ones. Sorrow... Be forsaken. We're buried where angels die. We've lost to the tears forget the heavens. We're buried where angels die.We can never hold onTo the purity of a starving heart. Be welcomed to the body of possessed light.Eulogy a prayer, beyond your fate. Sorrow of the wounded ones.Sorrow... We forsaken thee.
