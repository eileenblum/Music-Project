[Lyrics: Kristof Bathory]

Oh, bestial Sphinx.
You foreshadowed the crucified race.
I am your disciple, and you are the depraved sire.
Invoke the highest fire, to cleanse the hapless kin.
Invoke the blight wounds on our livid skin.
Ia! The old one.
Ia! The lord of the dead.
Ia! The father of scum.
Ia!...
Ia! The ancient one.
Ia! Blood of the scorpion.
Ia! Lore of the Necro-god.
Ia!..
Entity for the funeral pyre.
Adoration towards the great suffering.
We are the followers to feast your flesh.
We are wraiths, enslaved by the book of dead names.
Ia! The old one.
Ia! The lord of the dead.
Ia! The father of scum.
Ia!...
Ia! The ancient one.
Ia! Blood of the scorpion.
Ia! Lore of the Necro-god.
Ia!..
