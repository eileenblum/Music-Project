[Lyrics by Kristof Bathory]

Vertical, upside-down decomposed sculptures.
Bearing this violent ritual.
A gallery of maimed art.
Stretching and sectioning threw specimens.
Stretching the rib cage wide open.
Pouring down, feeble blood.
Stains of horror...Bled from the new found dead.
Murderous performance!
In a theater of carnal separation.
This is the draining room.
Cast the flesh to rot!
Exposed the threshold.
Sadistic torture.
Severe bloodshed.
They shall spoil!
Stretching the rib cage wide open.
Pouring down, feeble blood.
Stains of horror...Bled from the new found dead.
Murderous performance!
In a theater of carnal separation.
This is the draining room.
Cast the flesh to rot!
