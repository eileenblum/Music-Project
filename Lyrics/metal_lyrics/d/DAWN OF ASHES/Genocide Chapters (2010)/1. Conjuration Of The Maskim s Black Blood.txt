[Lyrics: Kristof Bathory]

The Seven Maskim. Lords of the Shadows, come forth!
Cripple the hearts of man.
Desecrate the light.
Darkest flesh, come forth!
Darkest blood, come forth!
Creatures of the grotesque, arise to devour.
They are Seven!
They are Seven!
Vengeance of the ancient ones, heralds of pestilence.
They are Seven!
They are Seven!
Hear the destructive storms of evil wind.
I shall invoke thee!
I shall invoke thee!
From the depths, they shall rise!
From the depths, they shall rise!
I shall invoke thee!
I shall invoke thee!
From the depths, they shall rise!
From the depths, they shall rise!
They are Seven!
They are Seven!
Vengeance of the ancient ones, heralds of pestilence.
They are Seven!
They are Seven!
Hear the destructive storms of evil wind.
Darkest of flesh, rejoin!
Darkest of blood...rejoin!
Darkest of flesh, rejoin!
Darkest of blood...rejoin!
They are Seven!
They are Seven!
Vengeance of the ancient ones, heralds of pestilence.
They are Seven!
They are Seven!
Hear the destructive storms of evil wind.
