[Lyrics: Kristof Bathory]

Bow before me!
For I am the power of immortals.
Sowing up the decrepit mouths.
that drink from the chalice of deserted knowledge.
Eternal enemies!
You are all condemned!
Eternal enemies!
I have crowned my fucking horns!
This god is I.
A demon's task to conquer the weak.
Severing tongues that speak against me.
Worship my name!
In the name of Belial's seed!
Worship this blood!
That's coursing through these vein.
The erosion is calling!
Spreading until it ends it all.
Fear the most sickness creation.
The creator of supremacy!
Eternal enemies!
You are all condemned!
Eternal enemies!
I have crowned my fucking horns!
This god is I.
A demon's task to conquer the weak.
Severing tongues that speak against me.
Worship my name!
In the name of Belial's seed!
Worship this blood!
That's coursing through these vein.
God-Like-Demon!
Forcing my fist down your fucking throats!
Eyelids cut off
to witness my chants of disease.
Violent redemption.
Written for the crippling of the spoiled.
God-Like-demon!
For I know who I am!
