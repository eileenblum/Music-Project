[Lyrics by Kristof Bathory]

Throat laceration from a surgical line, from blood lust fingers.
Mummified corpse smothering with her own entrails.
Nevermore to the filthy whore.
London's worthless.
Beaten down, frail hearts.
History has been made by the ink of the Devil's blade.
Behold the malicious beauty, by the silence of the respiration.
Kill the whore.
No slut deserves to live.
London's worthless.
Beaten down frail hearts.
Peasants will fade behind the perverse masquerade.
He is the one...chosen to redeem the name of punishment!
He has been chosen by the tyrants of hell...to sacrifice for the new age that is approaching!
Dark times have been worshiped by his name...
And his name shall live forever!
FOREVER!!!
London's worthless.
Beaten down, frail hearts.
History has been made by the ink of the Devil's blade.
