[Lyrics: Kristof Bathory]

âHallow grace unfolds.
Coiling around flesh of starving light.
It's the breath of time.
Seizing to die inside.
Final taste of innocence consuming the sins of signs.
Open your eyes to the end of time.â

âNo beauty shall be painted again.
This unfortunate fate guided this end.
Bear your terrible scars.
This suicide note against mankind.â

No hope survives genocide.
You sold your soul for this...
You sold your soul for this...
You sold your soul for this...
You sold your soul for this...
Ashes fall on sedated life.
