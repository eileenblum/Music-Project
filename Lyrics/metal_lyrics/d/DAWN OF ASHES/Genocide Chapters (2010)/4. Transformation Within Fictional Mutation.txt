[Lyrics by Kristof Bathory]

Formulate these tales that spread viral growth in the bodies of man.
Breeding a demoniac plague of malformation.
These creatures beyond the visions of dreadful nightmares.
In living myths.
They contaminate the dimension of reality.
Incurable darkness within!
Reincarnate the darkness within!
Blackened gateway of channeled mutation!
Let the transformation begin!
The darkness leaks.
Becoming the wickedness of wretched beasts!
Breeding a demoniac plague, for the fucking end.
An abstract birth.
To bring alive this fertile evil.
In living myths.
In the face of the beast.
This is the end of times.
Incurable darkness within!
Reincarnate the darkness within!
Blackened gateway of channeled mutation!
Let the transformation begin!
Their blood serves the beast.
Controlling this mortal realm.
Human skin turns into slime and horns.
You shall serve!
You shall serve!
You shall serve the beast!
Incurable darkness within!
Reincarnate the darkness within!
Blackened gateway of channeled mutation!
Let the transformation begin!
