[Lyrics: Kristof Bathory]

Boiling of noxious flames.
Crawling beneath from Heaven's decay.
Hades has sheltered the damned, away from the supernal circle.
Bathed...Bathing in a heathen's womb.
The Nether hands are placed firmly, pulling angels down into the lair of the anti-Christ.
Hear the demented screams.
From shadows sentenced to burn!
Seething the flesh
In the river of Phlegethon.
Seething the flesh
Tearing out the eyes of God.
Boiling of noxious flames.
Crawling beneath from Heaven's decay.
Chiron has united in torture.
Bathed...Bathing in a heathen's womb.
Corroding the sacred sun to except the darkest icon.
Seething the flesh
In the river of Phlegethon.
Seething the flesh
Tearing out the eyes of God.
