[Lyrics by Kristof Bathory]

Colonized worms searching for Omega's seed...
This placid touch from the Devil's codex.
The desert's curse of demon shades...
Putrefied shadows from their sullen fury.
They writhe corpses for their blood lust cancer...
Nightmarish wasteland of the relic race.
I saw hell in the empty space.
It took my soul to the darkest place.
And I shall worship nocturnal rites.
This arcane life demonic paradise.
Malefic sands ,devouring the mortal clay.
Vexing the damned by crippling peasantry throats.
The serpent ghouls of primitive darkness, known as the horde of burial leeches.
Funeral thirst lies within machination.
Viscera erosion, tormenting the flesh that rots.
I saw hell in the empty space.
It took my soul to the darkest place.
And I shall worship nocturnal rites.
This arcane life demonic paradise.
