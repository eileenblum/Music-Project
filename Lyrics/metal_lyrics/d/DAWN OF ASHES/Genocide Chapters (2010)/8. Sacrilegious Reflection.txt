[Lyrics: Kristof Bathory]

I am the Judas worm!
Awakened from a sacred sleep.
Defiling the light in spiritual suicide.
I have unblessed strength!
Through self made demise.
Killing myself for the principles of blasphemy!
I am pure corruption!
I have reasons against god!
I preach mystique hate!
I reveal my sacrilegious reflection!
I am the Judas worm!
Pledging this necessary evil.
A burial made for kingdoms of divine swine.
Sovereign perfection!
Justify the ways of darkness.
Free myself to obtain self power.
I am pure corruption!
I have reasons against god!
I preach mystique hate!
I reveal my sacrilegious reflection!
âI shall embrace the razors to slit all holy veins!
I shall perish the sanctum to end the weakness of faith!
I am truth and reality!
You are parasites of a worthless fucking fable!â
