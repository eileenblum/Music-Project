This is a fake instrument constructed by filth. Black curtains in misery, shadowing your figure. Liars &amp; whores wrapped in chains. Disfigure the ease to shelter the pain.
Sex is so feeble...Starving the threaded mouth. Shatter ever whisper...Swallow the bullet in the south.

Raping angelical pussy lips. Force fuck my sins. This is an infection. It's born...It's born...It's born to stay alive.

[Chorus:]
Hollywood Made In Gehenna
It's time to incubate all ov our children.
And the whores come out at night.
This drug...This drug...This drug is for the leeches.

Hollywood In Gehenna [Repeat]

Obsessive lust prevailed &amp; corrupted. Twitching bitch numbed by a plastic gin.
Ruins &amp; the bruised are cherished with no value. Easily fucked, sucking off for a suicidal blade.

[Chorus:]
Hollywood Made In Gehenna
It's time to incubate all of our children.
And the whores come out at night.
This drug...This drug...This drug is for the leeches.

Hollywood In Gehenna [Repeat]


Repeat my lips, I hate you but I will fuck you anyways [Repeat]
