Saniyaza, touch me
The powers watch upon
And I will invent for you a victim
Never concealed before
Sanyaza, your children grow
Will you ever be involved?
I draw your number in my heart
To acclaim my very prize

And in supper
You'll give birth to an angel
And from this small creature's
Each one of us will have a new try

And you'll try!

And in supper you'll give birth to an angel
And each one of us will have a new try

Sanyaza, your children grow
When did you get involved?
Arisen numbers in my heart
And foregain my very prize

Through her lips, those orders birth and rise
Rake problems, get them off, with the number of your days
Where's the old grievance, you'll get of the Lord of the poverty
Herald here in your service and bring to me the demon

When in supper Saniyaza will come
And present us the true lore
The true lore and the storm
And turn to it in my time

To kiss all that I here have behold
For we have finally achieved
What we always had

Glory

For his glory
Guilt is glory
