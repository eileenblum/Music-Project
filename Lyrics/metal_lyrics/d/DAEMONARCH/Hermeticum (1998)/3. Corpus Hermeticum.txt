My heart will become our shelter
Now that you turn my hands
To the livings worlds
And my fears grovel with the dark

As the seal, I'm in disguise
Saniyaza
I wear the bowel and there's my face
I look down

And I fear
Down on my hands of fornication

And the children speak
We'll be arised and touch the Earth
Without a crown
Raphael will be sent to burn the ground

To subcreate
We'll fornicate to a new time
Hurry almost done
And you will see through me again

I will say join hands and greet us
To wash him away in your silver light
Thus sever ??? on your grave

You cannot save yourself
I'll feel your fear
I'll die you follow
I win
You will not save
You will not save
You will not save your lives
I lose

Your lives

When all is done
The voice of the mute will announce the will
The blind will see again
When all is too dark to be seen

The deaf will listen
When all is too loud to be heard
Revelations to the world
To finally follow their guilty God's

I keep
The share
I fear
Intent
I lust
In pain
I hide
In sin

When all is done
You'll see my face again
To finally follow their guilty God's
