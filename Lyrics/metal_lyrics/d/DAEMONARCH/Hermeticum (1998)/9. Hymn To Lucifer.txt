I've had no spring, no axle, and no end
His body, above the light radiance
When novel passion Sun souled Lucifer
Swept down the dark colossal swift aslant

And there's no end to deal with our curse
And spiced with sorrow, the true sources
Burnt a life, inside the Universe
Where love and knowledge drove out innocent

The key of joy is
Disobedience

I am the flame
That burns in every heart of Man
I'm the magician and the exorcist
