Incubus

I wanna see your thousand wings
Open, closing, behind you
Open them all at once for me
Be prepared for what you see

I will die before
I will live untouched

Listen to my thousand tongues
Amplifiy it by a thousand screams
Speak them all at once for me
Be prepared for what you hear

I will die before
I will live untouched

Incubus, succumb to me
Succubus, incube with me

Incubus Succubus

There is an order
That will be a meaning
When you're discovered
You'll die with the lust, but we'll see

There is an order
That will be a meaning

Incubus spreads with your disease
Succubus under a mad reveal

There is much more than I really mean
There is so little to be a few

Succubus, oh fly with me
I wanna be your symmetry
Succubus, arise in me
I wanna be the apathy
Succubus, arise in me
I wanna touch in harmony
Succubus, oh come to me
I've got to feel the anarchy

Incubus, succumb to me

Want to see a thousand wings
Open, closing, behind you?
Open them all at once for me
Be prepared for what you see

Listen to my thousand tongues
Amplified by a thousand screams
Speak them all at once for me
Be prepared for what you hear

Incubus, succumb to me
Succubus, incube with me

Incubus Succubus
