[Bathory cover]

God of Heaven, hear my cries
Of anguish, I'm in pain
I'm suffering a thousand deaths
But I live on in vain

Death would greet with eternal sleep
My soul would come to peace
My life has ceased, the time has come
Can no one hear my pleas?

Lowered down at the moisty ground
Into the dark and cold
My heartbeat is the only sound
Tears my limbs and soul

I scream for mercy, hear my cries
Lord, don't abandon me
I'm so tired
Grant me the eternal sleep

Buried and forgotten
In a cold and nameless grave
If death is what awaits me
I feel no fright

Buried and forgotten
In a cold and nameless grave
If there's a God in Heaven
Hear my call from the grave
