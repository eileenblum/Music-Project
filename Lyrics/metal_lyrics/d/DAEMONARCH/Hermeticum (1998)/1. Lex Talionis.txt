Rising above the searching of love visions
I felt this darkness resist
Nailing a thousand nazarenes
Screaming through your thousand faces
Robed in black
For this ritual madness
The demons of the heart
I have learned to obey

War is declared
Spread everywhere

Awaken from the slumber
Where can I hide
Screaming he dies

Past the light
Of a god sent
To a world of the night

For knowledge, I the demons ride
