Through a dead man's eyes
The old fears arise
From the promise of hope in a false solution
Let your struggle be worth the fight

I wanna burn these bridges and forget this and
Never bare that burden I know I'll miss
To forget what I saw for what's left to see
Everything means nothing and the end is beginning

[Chorus]
Can you hear it? Is it calling?
It's the sound of a thousand warnings
Do you fear it? Is it haunting?
This time your end is coming
Can you see it? Is it blinding?
It's the sight of the ones left dying
Do you feel it? Fallen from grace

Forever fuel the fire
The only way to begin again

But since it all means nothing from here on in
When everything is lost and still you win
And the walls of hope fall before your eyes
Because the promise of failure is no surprise

[Chorus]
Can you hear it? Is it calling?
It's the sound of a thousand warnings
Do you fear it? Is it haunting?
This time your end is coming
Can you see it? Is it blinding?
It's the sight of the ones left dying
Do you feel it? Fallen from grace

It's burning around us
Says Nero from Rome
In this grip of disaster
Sing your final song

You've been forgiven
All you wanted was to see the light
With the hope it blinded you
From the ashes of what's left behind

You've been forgiven
You've been forgiven
