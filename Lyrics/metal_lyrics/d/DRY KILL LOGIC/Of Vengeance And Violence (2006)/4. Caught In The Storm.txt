[Chorus]
Yeah all my life
My eyes don't see things that way
Yeah all this time
Caught in the storm I have made

Another sin goes unforgiven
Another blind eye to the sight
When it all seems sort of familiar
Just tell one thousand lies
And never keep a broken promise
And give in to a lack of control
Never forgive the ones that forget
This strength you call your own

Gone
The last piece to hold together
Gone
Never to return

[Chorus]
Yeah all my life
My eyes don't see things that way
Yeah all this time
Caught in the storm I have made

The one thing that seems to be certain
Begin together and always end alone
Never give in never surrender
Even when the grave you dig's your own
Now it's gone but never forgotten
Without a hint and with no warning
Listen close to the voices calling
Pay attention to the words they say for the love of God

Gone
The last piece to hold together
Gone
Never to return

[Chorus]
Yeah all my life
My eyes don't see things that way
Yeah all this time
Caught in the storm I have made

Where did I go wrong?
When the life forsaken again
Is the one I call my own?

[Chorus]
Yeah all my life
My eyes don't see things that way
Yeah all this time
Caught in the storm I have made
