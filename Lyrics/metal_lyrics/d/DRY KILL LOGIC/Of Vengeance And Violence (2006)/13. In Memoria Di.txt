Today will never end
And tomorrow will not mend
The pain in letting go
Haunts me always as now I've...
been helpless since
You've gone away
And I've been helpless since...
The light that shines from you
All you taught us, all you knew
To live and love again
Unforgiven and now I've...
been helpless since
You've gone away
And I've been helpless since
You've gone away...
Know I try to tell you I never realized
You would not believe me no matter how I tried
To be what I once knew
All for nothing without you
To hear you or see you again
Only one time but now
I've been helpless since
You've gone away
And I've been helpless since
You've gone away
Know I try to tell you I never realized
You would not believe me no matter how I tried
I cried...
