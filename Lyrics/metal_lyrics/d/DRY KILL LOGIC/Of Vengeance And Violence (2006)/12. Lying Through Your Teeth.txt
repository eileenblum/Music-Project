Living and learning.
Crashing and burning.
Giving and taking.
Broken and breaking.
You chose your fate.
Far too little far too late.
There's never been a reason.
To question anything there's nothing left here.
When there's nothing in return there's never been a reason.
I've seen through everything.
There's nothing left here.
When there's nothing in return.
Kicking and screaming.
Dying and dreaming.
Giving and taking.
Broken and breaking.
You chose your fate.
Far too little far too late.
When the lines divide.
And the dream collides.
With a truth you've forgotten.
You'll say it's all fallen apart
