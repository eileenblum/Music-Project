No warning, no hesitation
And nothing left to prove
Divided-The strength is fading
Power you seek to use
This hatred is overwhelming
It only seems to show
No mercy, the freedom's calling
Bury the hatchet in vain

If only the chosen one......Had been here the last time
Who saw the ending before it all began? (when the dreams were shattered)
And who went running before we took our stand? (with your wings now severed)

Forgotten-The words have meanings
No ashes turned to stone
And these questions will have no answers
And won't leave you alone.
The scarring, this damage done now
The cuts run far too deep
With vengeance, and violence rising
The time has come to decide

The living and dying heart
Has beaten for the last time

Who saw the ending before it all began? (when the dreams were shattered)
And who went running before we took our stand? (with your wings now severed)

Never take a life worth living
This blood runs black from killing
Never take a life worth living
What you offer is not worth giving...
...Has beaten for the last time

Who saw the ending before it all began? (when the dreams were shattered)
And who went running before we took our stand? (with your wings now severed)
Who saw the ending before it all began? (when the dreams were shattered)
And who went running before we took our stand? (with your wings now severed)

Never take a life worth living
What you offer ain't worth giving...
