With a past now slipping away
And the vision of numbered days
As the end moves closer it seems they ought to know
About the giving you've taken away
Through a life of unmarked graves
To find the final resting place they ought to know

Regret nothing
When the last breath
You take is all you've got
Dead man walking dies a slow death
This fight will carry on
Regret nothing
When the last breath
You take is all you've got
Dead man walking dies a slow death
No strength to carry on

With a life now clearly defined
And the fire that's fueled by time
There's nothing left to fear and nothing left to lose
In the darkest hour of life
And in the deepest part of your mind
Can you answer the question, what have you done?

Regret nothing
When the last breath
You take is all you've got
Dead man walking dies a slow death
This fight will carry on
Regret nothing
When the last breath
You take is all you've got
Dead man walking dies a slow death
No strength to carry on

Death walk
Death walk

Death walk, now for the first time
The end has finally come
Death walk, for the last time
Your end has finally come

Regret nothing
When the last breath
You take is all you've got
Dead man walking dies a slow death
This fight will carry on
Regret nothing
When the last breath
You take is all you've got
Dead man walking dies a slow death
This fight to carry on

Will carry on
