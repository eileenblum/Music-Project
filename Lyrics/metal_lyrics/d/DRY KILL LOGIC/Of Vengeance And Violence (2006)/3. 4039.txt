The chaos is forced to make revenge
When it takes what it wants with no regret
And leaves no chance for redemption
To wash away the sins never
Forgiven the past mistakes
Never forget the damage done deeper
The rest have come to stare
and that's when you

Realize
You slowly realize

[Chorus]
The worst has yet to find you
I will be right behind you
I don't need anything
I don't need anything
With nothing left to save you
I will be right behind you
I don't need anything
I don't need anything at all

The fallen have began to rise again
You follow when no one's a leader
The punishment fits the crime
You give what you get the betrayal
Will leave you paralyzed
And fighting to return the favor
when so few compromise
And that's when you

Realize
You slowly realize

[Chorus]
The worst has yet to find you
I will be right behind you
I don't need anything
I don't need anything
With nothing left to save you
I will be right behind you
I don't need anything
I don't need anything at all

Anything at all
Anything at all

You fight it harder
As it draws closer
You know it's stronger
And then it's over

The reasons still seem so unclear
Tell me why I'm here
Fighting this same old fear

And you find it harder
As it draws closer
You know it's stronger
And then it's over

[Chorus]
The worst has yet to find you
I will be right behind you
I don't need anything
I don't need anything
With nothing left to save you
I will be right behind you
I don't need anything
I don't need anything at all

Anything at all
Anything at all (I don't need anything)
I don't need anything
Anything at all (I don't need anything)
I don't need anything
