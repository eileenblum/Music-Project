Descend alone in this world been forgotten
If only we had been more certain
Now I have given everything this last time
And taken nothing back in Return

You don't make me
What I am

[Chorus:]
In my eyes you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, reminded, consider me too far gone
In my eyes you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, I'm hoping you'll label me too far gone

Defend all the words spoken, say nothing
The time has come and gone for changing
We spend our final moments here together
Without a scream, without a whisper

You don't make me
What I am

[Chorus:]
In my eyes you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, reminded, consider me too far gone
In my eyes you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, I'm hoping you'll label me too far gone

If you could call it all misguided
What is left to say?
When everything you know is taken, can you walk away?

[Chorus:]
In my eyes you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, reminded, consider me too far gone
In my eyes you're blinded
You'll never be anything at all
In your eyes, I'm hoping you'll label me too far gone
