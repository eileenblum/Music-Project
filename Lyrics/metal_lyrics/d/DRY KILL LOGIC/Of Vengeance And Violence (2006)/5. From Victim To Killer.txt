Fallen victim, feel the weight of the world
Crush the thought of what could have been
Will it end here? Have you given enough?
Did you reach your death bed alive?
Falling further than ever, no more
From victim to killer, forgive
You for failing the mentor
Taking over what little is left of you

[Chorus]
Your battle called self destruction
Isn't what it used to be
No hope for the disillusioned
So forget what you see
There's not enough here to go around
So unfortunately
You're the one with the shortest straw
And I guess that you is me

Stand and defend
Save the little that's left never let the past show no regret
Break the broken
Given all the remains and take heed from the silence spoken
No room for failure depends on a lifeless center living
For a shadow of closure
Leaving nothing but the chaos because of you

[Chorus]
Your battle called self destruction
Isn't what it used to be
No hope for the disillusioned
So forget what you see
There's not enough here to go around
So unfortunately
You're the one with the shortest straw
And I guess that you is me

No hope for the disillusioned
That you is me

[Chorus]
Your battle called self destruction
Isn't what it used to be
No hope for the disillusioned
So forget what you see
There's not enough here to go around
So unfortunately
You're the one with the shortest straw
And I guess that you is me

That you is me
