Fearing nothing as the changes surround me
Nothing, nothing
This pain is never ending
Forgive, forgive
As the light at the end of the tunnel grows closer
Closer, closer
It seems your days are numbered
No more, no less

A moment froze in time
The four will become five

[Chorus]
Into the boneyard
Never to return

When all the promise in the world ain't enough to save you
Protect, protect
The rest will turn against you
Against, against
Given up hope for the chance of survival
Survive, survive
The time has come to decide
Decide, decide

It's beating you down
And leaving nothing in return

[Chorus]
Into the boneyard
Never to return
Into the boneyard
Where everything is wrong

Beating you down and never
Leaving a thing in return

[Chorus]
Into the boneyard
Never to return
Into the boneyard
Where everything is wrong
