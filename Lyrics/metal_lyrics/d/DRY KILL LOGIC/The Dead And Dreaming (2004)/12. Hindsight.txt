[Import version track]

These are the same things born from the last time
And now its here and its fueled yet its falling apart
And you feel this, lord how you know this
It seems to me like the whole things falling away

And you feel it, lord how you know it
Now its everything of the way it should be
And it feels like, hair on the livestock
All at the same time

With my own eyes I see inside
And pushed it all away
Small white lies
In everything you say
Cause I don't want it
To feel this way
Small white lies
In everything you say
What you say

All of the same things died on the first time
And now its gone like the drive so taken from me
And you feel this, lord how you know this
It seems to me like the whole things runnin' away

And you feel it, lord how you know it
Now its all around and drained the life out of me
And it feels like, hair on the livestock
All at the same time

With my own eyes I see inside
And pushed it all away
Small white lies
In everything you say
Cause I don't want it
To feel this way
Small white lies
In everything you say
What you say

What it's doing to me
What you say
What it's doing to me

With my own eyes I see inside
And pushed it all away
Small white lies
In everything you say
Cause I don't want it
To feel this way
Small white lies
In everything you say

With my own eyes
I've pushed it all away
Small white lies in
Everything you say
And I don't want it
To feel this way
Small white lies
In everything you say
