Now has come the time
Indifference born because of lies
Now no matter what you find
This is the end of all the lines
and when its taken all away
What will you do or will you say
That can erase all the pain

[Chorus:]
So you can start to rebuild again-focus
In your life do you lead or follow?
What you feel is it joy or sorrow?
Taking pleasure in others pain
As it's calling out your name
And though I want to hide
When it finds a way
As the pressure burns from the inside...
And though I want to hide
When it finds a way
As the pressure burns from the inside...

You'll find when all is said and done
Will you have lost or have you won?
and did you fight or did you run?
Now

[Chorus]

Now as the dreams come and go before my eyes
I see the strength and weight of resolve
For all the lying the truth shall remain with overwhelming force
The same as it ever was...

And though I want to hide
When it finds a way
As the pressure burns from the inside... [x2]
