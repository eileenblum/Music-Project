[Chorus:]
I'm of the opinion
That it's all or nothing- when the chance comes Will you be there?
Never surrender/ will you give up will you give in when it all falls away?
Your life has been to do this for this
and I feel that's stronger than NOTHING
NOTHING
all the same, when you're 200 years forgotten
will you rise above them all?
I've been the one forgotten
When all the plans had failed
I've been the one uncertain
when all the rest had bailed
You've wondered for the last time
If I am what they say
The rest will come and go I
Will be the one that
Stays! Stays! Stays! [X2]

[Second verse variation at ending :]
The rest will come and go I/ Will be the one that
200 years forgotten
will you rise above them all?
200 years forgotten
will you have suffered the fall?
