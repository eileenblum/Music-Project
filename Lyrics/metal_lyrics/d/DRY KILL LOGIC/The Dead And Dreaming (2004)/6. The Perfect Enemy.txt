First off- dismiss
All of the lies- what brought you to this?
In what you feel what you need how do you exist
When there's far too many problems to list
As you watch your future fleeting falling further away
In what you feel what you need everything you say
Every minute every second every single day
Second-guessing choosing which path you will pave...it's not right

[Chorus:]
And I swear I'd give it all
But it's never enough
And when this is said and done
Did you want it as much?
But you knew what went around will come back to you
But it makes no difference cause its through...cause I'm through with you!

Give up- give in
It's like the limits that your life's been lived in
And all around you it's the same that it's ever been
But you'll never see that cause it doesn't quite sink it
That where the future's headed you will walk it alone
Gone are the dreams and the plans you are on your own
Left with nothing everything that you've been shown
Has been forgotten for the promise of a life unknown...so not right

[Chorus]

Everything you want it to be I'll do that
Blinded by the light you see I feel that
Running from the truth it brings I see that
Never knowing what it means We share that
Running from it trying to hide Don't do that
Looking for a way not to mind Don't do that
Feeling no ones on your side Don't say that
Slowly lose your mind...

[Chorus]
