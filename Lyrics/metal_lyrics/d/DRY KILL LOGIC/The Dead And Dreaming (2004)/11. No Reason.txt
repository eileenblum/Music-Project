The actions misleading
The words have no meaning
and leave it further still its hopeless
and pointless
and unlike all the rest
its something I don't mind and I remember falling victim again
and I...I'm walking in circles
on pins and on needles
and giving it all away unwilling
ungrateful/ and nervous
can you tell?
The laughter starts to fade and I remember falling victim again
and I feel the pain won't let me forget
and I cannot let this get in my head
and I... the last chance
one more try
final straws
and goodbyes
the laughter starts to fade
