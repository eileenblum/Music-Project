It always begins the same and then it ends again
It's everywhere but the silence deafens me
But that's about to change when
Nothing is there and still I feel it follow me There is no chance I fear it
seems so hopeless

[Chorus:]
I like to see that
You give and take back
As I still bleed from the knife in my back
Lines have been drawn
who lost who won? When it's all over what side were you on?
Now you decide what side whose side are you on?
Now you decide what side whose side are you on?

You wanted this life
you've gotten this life
Nothing before and nothing again you realize
will let you tolerate the
Shit to which it seems you tend to gravitate
While taking this for granted
Never a want and never a care for anyone
why is it hard to see it's all or nothing?

[Chorus]

Whose side... I feel it forming closer
Never was the one to want to walk the fine line
The way I saw it was all in due time
But the constant harassment, believing to no end
Is what got the best of me
The best of me... I feel it forming closer
You wanted this life
You've gotten this life
You wanted this life
You deserve this
