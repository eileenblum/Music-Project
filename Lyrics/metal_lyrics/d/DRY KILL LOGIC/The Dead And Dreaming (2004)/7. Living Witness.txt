Preaching fear of future disaster
As I wonder what you truly know
Never needing justification
Never needing anything at all
watching as your dynasty crumbles
Descending darkness takes away the light
Fading further than all had expected
Sinking as I feel I am inside

[Chorus:]
Seize everything and go
It's not that having but the want
Is all that you know
Now the move is just to
Seize everything and go
Its not the having but the want is all that you know
You know?

Bringing chaos with all that's uncertain
This boat of lies will surely start to sink
Under the weight of such oppression
Missing out on what I feel is right
Living proof and bearing witness
Casualties almost too much to take
No more hope and no more passion
Looking for a sign of life is all

[Chorus]

Here I lie
Alone inside
More than need
More fuel for greed
Move just to seize everything and go
It's not that having but the want
Is all that you know
Now the move is just to

[Chorus]
