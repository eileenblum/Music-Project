A broken man that
Waits to die
It's no good, but I
Wonder why
You have left me here
My pride
Forgave
Rise!
Give up, give in, lie down
I never will.
As I lay
How I have dreamed of
This day
All the things I thought
I would say
Now all I can do
Is pray
And wait
Rise!
Give up, give in, lie down
I never will.
Crucified
I alone lay here
My pride
Forgave.
Rise!
Give up, give in, lie down
I never will.
Never will
