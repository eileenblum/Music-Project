You remember, I will always
See you for the liar you are.
And if I were gone tomorrow
Then finally you would see all my scars.
This won't get the best of me
Won't try to even listen to me
You keep clinging on to me
But I feel my sanity drain and
I feel the break I
Can feel the break I
You remember, I will always
See you for the liar you are.
And if I were gone tomorrow
Then finally you would see all my scars.
This won't get the best of me
Won't try to even listen to me
You keep clinging on to me
But I feel my sanity drain and
I feel the break I
Can feel the break I
I can feel the break
And I know what's to follow
Never before was the truth
hard to follow
In your own self-doubt you will wallow
Now it's my time
You remember I will always
See you for the liar I know you ARE!
Even when I try
I cannot seem to find
One good reason why
I should believe your lies and
I feel the break I
Can feel the break I
Can feel the break and I know what's to follow
Never before was the truth hard to swallow
In your own self-doubt you will wallow
Now I don't have the time
