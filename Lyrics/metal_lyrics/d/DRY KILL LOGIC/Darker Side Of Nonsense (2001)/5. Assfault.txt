I'll give you just a little of what you need
And then I take a little and now it seems
That everything is a lie and yet they try
To force it back up on you; what will
you do?
You think you're tougher than this -
you'll be dismissed
You think it's easy for me to beleive
That every word has been said and
left for dead
My pride is bigger than that - remains
intact.
Now I take this
And I could care less
About your distress
I lie in the bed that I have made.
And now I'm coming for you -
what will you do?
This time I prove it to you -
follow through
And there is nowhere to hide that you
will find
This is the end of the line and it's you I
find.
Now I take this
And I could care less
About your distress
I lie in the bed that I have made.
