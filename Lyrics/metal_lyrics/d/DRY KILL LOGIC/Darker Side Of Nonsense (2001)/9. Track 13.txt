And I will say what's on my mind
If I can find my way from here
Or I will stay a fallen man
If I can't find my where from here

Still all the same and left here to die
Cold I
Have everything here with
No surprise
Would I?
Suffice to say it's hard yet we tried
Should I?
Abandon all, abandon all and decide -
Now I see the light

And I will say what's on my mind
If I can find my way from here
Or I will stay a fallen man
If I can't find my where from here

Zero nothing and then left to die
Could I have everything here with no surprise?
Would I?
Turn back the changes, and yet we try, should I abandon all abandon all that is mine
Never again will I walk the line,
more than spirits inside
they're no friend of mine
this is the same name
I can't come to grips with it,
and now I feel,
and now I feel dismissed

Now I see the light
