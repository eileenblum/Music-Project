And I will wander on alone
The strength that I will call my own
Inside my mind
There is something left to find
It's like this - focus
Not no hocus pocus
Bullshit - don't quit
Before I have to throw a fit
You want this, need this
Don't miss all this
Lies. Lies. Lies. Lies.
And I wander on alone
The strength that I will call my own
Inside my mind
There is something left to find
It's like this - focus
Not no hocus pocus
Bullshit - don't quit
Before I have to throw a fit
You want this, need this
Don't miss all this
Your hostile lifestyle
Contributes to my profile
And this shit, that shit
All a bunch of bullshit
You sit back, lay back
Enjoy your fuckin' kickbacks
Explode - unload
Just like you're told
Lies. Lies. Lies. Lies.
And I will wander on alone
The strength that I will call my own
Everything I say comes back to haunt me.
Everything I say will come back to
haunt me.
Lies. Lies. Lies. Lies.
And I will wander on alone.
The strength that I will call my own.
