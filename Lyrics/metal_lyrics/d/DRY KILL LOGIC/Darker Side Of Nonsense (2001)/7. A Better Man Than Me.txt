Now that I've come to see
That it was you, not me
All these lies believed
Although it never occurred to me
that you'd come undone
You thought I'd lost and you'd won
Your bridges burned, you're shunned
And now it's time to pay. . .
Only One thing left to say
And be it as it may
Can't WAIT for judgement day
My life was given back to me
How does it feel?
You look at me, you kneel!
I don't need anyone
To tell me it's real.
Fuck you don't tell me
I can see he's a better man than me
What you want.
What you need.
It's not the same, I tried.
I never questioned why.
I always felt that I
Had done the best I could for you.
But now without me
Albeit painfully
I guess that you can't seem
To get this clearly
Fuck you don't tell me
I can see he's a better man than me.
What you want.
What you need.
Fuck you don't tell me.
