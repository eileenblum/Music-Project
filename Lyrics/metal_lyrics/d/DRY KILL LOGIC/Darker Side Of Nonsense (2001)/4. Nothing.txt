Do you want to
Step to this? Wanna mess with this?
Wanna piss on this? You're on my shit
list. Did you lie to me?
Are you blind to see? I never ever
gave a fuck of what they thought of
me. How can I trust you when I know
you? Nothing meant more to me
than you. You took, I gave, your
breath - please save.
Now I see clearly
You'll pay for this dearly
Everything that I thought we had was a lie
What goes around comes around
Once lost now I am found
All of this hatred I focus on you.
I have nothing
You've given me nothing
And I
Thought we had something
To believe in
Deceiving
My point of view you don't seem to
like, these thing of you you don't like
to smile but you don't want to be my
friend. 'Cuz we are on again, then off
again, then on again, lets not pretend
that this could ever be. It can't - you see?
Now I see clearly
You'll pay for this dearly
Everything that I thought we had was a lie
What goes around comes around
Once lost now I am found
All of this hatred I focus on you.
I have nothing
You've given me nothing
And I
Thought we had something
To believe in
Deceiving
Nothing.
