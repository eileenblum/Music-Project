Now that I
Face the world with pain inside
Strange but I
Can't understand the reasons why.
Forever is
A world that I cannot describe
That Died the time we said goodnight.
It makes no difference, wrong or right
The time has come to say goodnight.
And how could I
Be so sure but be so wrong?
And how could I?
Have a will so weak with a mind so strong?
And Only I
Can tell the difference right or wrong.
It makes no difference, wrong or right
I guess it's best we say goodnight.
