And I pray salvation leaves you here
again
And if I swear for you, I've seen the end
I bear
This weight
For you
And now if seems to me
Every time that I try
To give you peace of mind,
You go and question why.
Some things you just should know
That it was yours to show
It's like I feel this way
Because I'm wanted to.
"and I pray for"
Weight
All of the weight
Can't stand the weight
Crushing
Pushing down on me
You can't seem to see
What's left in me
And now I
I bear
This weight
For you
The pressure grates on me
Yet I am loathe to find
Some sort of middle ground
To work at compromise.
You'll never understand
What all this does to to me
I'm keeping you alive,
And yet it's killing me.
And I pray salvation leaves you here
again
And if I swear for you, I've seen the
end
Weight
All of the weight
Can't stand the weight
Crushing
Pushing down on me
You
Can't seem to see
What's left in me
And now I
Never - I won't
Compromise it - I won't
Take for granted - I won't
Give up on it - I won't
Idolize it - I must
Keep my focus - I must
Sacrifice us - I must
Never let go - I must
Not fall
