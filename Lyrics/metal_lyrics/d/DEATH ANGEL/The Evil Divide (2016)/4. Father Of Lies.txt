Judge others as I judge myself
Sometimes it's harsh, but! It can't be helped
I want to thrive. Achieve Victory
If you're weak willed Then don't ride with me

Very few can endure the grind
But! If you do... Side by side we'll shine
The road is tough. But! It can be beat
If you're knocked down...
Get back up on your feet

I Shall be heard, and the reason's divine
My every word, so our people will shine
You've had your say. Your claims bastardized 
Leaving them betrayed
Pathetic Father of lies

Stick to my guns, and I stand by my word
The clash is loud! But! My voice shall be heard
The dust will settle
The smoke disappears
We'll raise the bar
Do I make myself clear

You say it seems like I have something to prove 
You bet that ass I'm going to prove it to you
Don't try to stifle me with tired old tricks
Use sleight of hand, and I'll snap your wrist

The time has come! Your cross to bare
Flee the sun for dark's hidden glare

Leader of nothing. How you had them all fooled
Knew from the start that you hadn't a clue
You have no substance. It's all so rehearsed
Same fucking melody! Same fucking verse!

Nothing but time. Now! That's all you've earned
Reflect on disrespect to all that you've burned
Your reign is over. Your legacy rusts
Your testament's a meager pile of dust
