Can anybody hear me now
A cruel land's fallen son
Pleading to the skies above
Forgive me please for what I've done

The only truth is death they claim
I chose to gift that lie
Force feeding truth to so many
My eyes as I watched them die

Train me, then blame me
I bought myself into this game
Mold me, Then scold me
I'll never be the same

If only you could see me now
I broke a dark one side twisted vow
You take a poor, broke, lost, and stolen soul
And simply throw his soul away

Believe me when I tell you now
They mold the truth, and turn it upside down
It took me years to see, and come this far
And still I feel so lost today

Will anybody save me now
Exposed I stand alone
A prisoner in my own body
No place really feels like home

I've grown to see the wrong I've done
And I cannot shake this pain
So I close my eyes, and let it go
With one final breathe of shame

Train me, then blame me
I bought into this game
Mold me, Then scold me
I'll never be the same

If only you could see me now
I broke a dark one sided twisted vow
You take a poor, broke, lost, and stolen soul
And simply throw his soul away

Believe me when I tell you now
They mold the truth, and turn it upside down
It took me years to see, and come this far
And still I feel so lost today

Rain down on me
And wash this pain away
Rain down on me
And wash this pain away
