No! No longer fearing the silence, or decay
I'm warning you
I've faced the rigors of violence
In my own way

Don't come here to get a leg up
Don't you come in here to stop this roll
You try to knock me down with your hateful words
It's your shield
The coward's way

Stop you now. Dead in your tracks
Stop you now, and force you back
You will feel the damage done
And bear the shame of doubt

Doubt! The walls of doubt tried to hold me
And they did fall
I've persevered all the poisoned slander
And I rose to the call

The fight is still far from over
The fight's only still just begun
And now you're falling swiftly down a jagged cliff
As I fly towards the new day's sun

Stop you now. Dead in your tracks
Stop you now, and force you back
You will feel the damage done
And bear the shame of doubt

Let the pieces crumble
Let the pieces fall
As the rubble buries you
I'll still be standing tall

You think it's easy? Come give it a try
Swallow the truth that you're living a lie
Your plight is useless. It's over, and done
See it in your eyes that I already won

Darkness seduced me
But! I fought my way back
Stronger than steel now
I've crossed the edge of the black
On my own

I didn't start this to falter
I didn't start to let it go
I'm gonna see this through til' the very end
It's my way
That's what I know
