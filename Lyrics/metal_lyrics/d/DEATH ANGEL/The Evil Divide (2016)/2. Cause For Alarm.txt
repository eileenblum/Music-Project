Cause for alarm. Disaster looms
Choose not to see it, but! You know I'm right
Accuse, assault. Then they're rewarded
Hunt you down in the broad daylight
As they engage, and we're betrayed
Of our laws now dead for years
Then they'll divide us all, and we'll surely fall
So blame yourself for all those feeble tears

Cause for alarm. Impending doom
Sinking deeper into abysmal strife
They won't kill you now. No one will be aborted
Worthless dead. They want you all alive 
You're labeled crooks. They're banning books
Censored news, and poisoned pens
They keep you numb with drugs
Form exclusive clubs
The vicious cycle seems to never end

Shatter the silence
By Invoking violence
Stand up to the storm
When You're in doubt
Go all out
Your pride must be reborn

Human traps close
Mankind's emotions explode 
from rights gone, and lost
We'll keep fighting on
Self worth at any cost

Cause for alarm. Nothing to lose
Don't go down without a proper fight
What they fear the most. United forces
Risking all to gain back what is right

Cause for alarm. The tides are shifting
They will hear the people have a voice
We'll fight for honor
We will fight for freedom
And we'll fight to have a fucking choice
