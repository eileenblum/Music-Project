I need someone to live for
Something to die for
Because this crazy life
Is getting to me
Don't want to play the part
Of a man with a broken heart
Somebody help me find a way
To release the aggression inside

It's so cold in this lonely room
Sitting around thinking of you
And I'm alone just talking to myself
Trying to find the answer but to no avail

Never moving
Never changing

Blank stares at the blank walls
Drill a deep hole in my empty soul

Never moving
Never changing

Life is just a game they say
And what if I don't want to play no more
Such a high price to pay
Come inside or get away from that door

We've got to make a change
We got to rearrange
Because this stagnant life
Is getting to me
Like a river must flow
It's time to let myself go
Nobody made me choose the life
I chose to live anyway

Forever moving
Forever changing

Blank stares at the blank walls
Drill a deep hole in my empty soul

Forever moving
Forever changing
