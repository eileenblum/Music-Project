Blurs of beauty have passed me by
Scenes have flashed inside my mind
Remembered places in memory alive
Forever moving onward

An endless space within you are
Black hopeless hole feelings are sparse
Seems your goal is gone devotion wanders far
Take a look back on your past

Happiness a feeling
So far surreal
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear you still feel

An aimless search through latent realms
The warmth is lost cold beings dead
Affection fatal love bonded to a bed
Release your inner self

Time is sacred until it ends
Never to stop so cleanse your head
Relax in peace I'll be happily content
Waiting to fulfil your fate

Happiness a feeling
So far surreal
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear you still feel
Joy just a reflection
Of the fear that you still feel

The conclusion
Provoke the end don't wait
Resolution
Do it now rearrange
Discontinue
And make...the change
