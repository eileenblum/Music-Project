[Words &amp; Music: Cavestany]

I'm not sure what's going on
Can't seem to cope I've gone beyond
Sense to me is obsolete
Can find a strength in a brief retreat
Sights and sounds they start to blur
These circumstances do occur
There's no hope I'm going down
Won't be long until I kiss the ground

I'm falling out
There's no lasting

Rock a bye baby
In your deep thoughts
When the night wind blows
It's time to rock
A life with no breaks
The child will fall
Down will come baby
No one cares at all

I'm not sure just what to do
Not up to me not up to you
Always been a different breed
Something like unplanted seed
Sorry but I just can't cope
It's not my fault but there's no hope
I shall not cry I will not weep
Just drift into eternal sleep
