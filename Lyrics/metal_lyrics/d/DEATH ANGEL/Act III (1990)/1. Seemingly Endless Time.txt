[Words &amp; Music: Cavestany]

Drifting on an endless sea
On our way to nowhere
Oblivious to our destiny
Slowly drifting on and on and on

Wander far away too far
Trapped in a timeless void
Changing with the shifting wind
Never can see an end
It's a real vague story
Impossible to perceive
A seemingly endless time

Passing through eternity
Still devoid of meaning
Useless to inquire upon
The fate that we shall suffer on

Destitute still lost at sea
On the ship of sorrow
Past the point of no return
Today is merely yesterday's tomorrow
