Twisted, beaten, and now ripped apart
The black hopeless days of a once thriving heart
The pain of the process. Your sick little plan
You buried the hope but! You can't kill the man

Your saintly disguise, and the route that you took
To impale my dreams on your rusted barbed hook
You fled from the scene, I was dumped in a can
You buried the hope but! You can't kill the man

Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Discarded - Left for dead
Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Dark days that I now dread
Discarded - Left for dead

Angelic sinner with heavenly eyes
Sadistical siren with covert sharp lies
You poisoned your prey long before I began
You buried the hope but! You can't kill the man

Demeaning white wench
Gouging wounds with black malice
Castrating victims with hands cold, and calloused
Lobotomized zombies, past lovers - Your clan
You buried the hope but! You can't kill the man

Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Discarded - Left for dead
Wrung out, and torn to shreds

Heartless the way you fled
Dark days that I now dread
Discarded - Left for dead

Combative defensive rants
From a mouth that's oh! So soiled
Tumultuous days, and nights
When your lies became our world
And go figure you'd slip away
With near hardly a scratch
Daddy's little debutante
Repulsive, rancid gash

Care free, and thoughtless. Your new open road
A filthy charred canvas disguised by the snow
Poetic dissent for your new fucking scam
You buried the hope but! You can't kill the man

New lease on life, I now thrive in the sun
Broke free from your cage. And I re-learned to run
Unleashing my wings with an infinite span
The blooming fresh dreams of this unbroken man

Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Discarded - Left for dead
Wrung out, and torn to shreds
Heartless the way you fled
Dark days that I now dread
Discarded - Left for dead
