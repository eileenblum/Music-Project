Charging straight out the gates
And I'm swinging for keeps
No! Nothing can stop me now
Fly on the wind, my friend
I'll fight until the end
You build them up
And I'll smash them down

My rage these days. Be warned, my rage
Don't cross me now. Be warned

Ballistic battering ram
And I don't fear any man
Oh! The Hell that I've been through
I've glared Death in the eye
As I saw him walk by
It's as almost as if he knew

My rage these days. Be warned, my rage
Don't cross me now. Be warned

Merciless blows will wear you down
Nowhere to hide
They seem to come from everywhere
No way to fight
Legs give way to tremendous pain
Then you'll look up
Now! Heed the name
The caster of shame

Concise, acute, aware
I'm gonna break you down
A future of despair
All you'll have when I leave town
That stoic stance shall fold
I've turned mountains into dust
Your arrogance I loathe
Those platinum plans
Will turn to rust

My rage these days
Be warned, my rage
Don't cross me now
Be warned

Merciless blows will wear you down
Nowhere to hide
They seem to come from everywhere
No way to fight
Legs give way to tremendous pain
Then you'll look up
Now! Heed the name
The caster of shame
