Look me in the eyes and preach shit
About what I need

In the same damn cage for years and years
While you run free

Best hope and pray to the sky above
That I never break out

But know that I will and when I do
I'm going to silence that mouth

The dream calls for blood
And you've not spilled enough
The dream, it calls for blood
Mine feeds the sea so rough

Dream Calls For Blood
Dream Calls For Blood
Dream Calls For Blood
Dream Calls For Blood

You gloat and boast about yourself
It's so obscene

Onlookers gasp in shear dismay
At your routine

There was a day so long ago
When you fought right

Truth be told you've grown so soft
Days turned to night

The dream calls for blood
And you've not spilled enough
The dream, it calls for blood
Mine feeds the sea so rough

[Solo]

My dreams are payed with patience
Persistent and aware
Your lack of integrity
Self gorging without care

I'll humble and expose you
Stand proud as you collapse

[Solo]

Pity for you, well, let it be known
That I have none

But the knowledge you taught so unaware
How it shouldn't be done

I'll keep the fire alive and the hunger inside
'Till I shall pass

So the dream I love with all my blood
Will forever last

The dream calls for blood
And you've not spilled enough
The dream, it calls for blood
Mine feeds the sea so rough

Words of scorn can't stop me
This hunger only grows
Steadfast to ignore me
Is why you fell so far below

Dream Calls For Blood
Dream Calls For Blood
Dream Calls For Blood
Dream Calls For Blood
