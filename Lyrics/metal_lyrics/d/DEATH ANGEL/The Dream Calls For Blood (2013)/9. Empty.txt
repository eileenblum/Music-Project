Get up, get out feeling nothing
Try to survive in a world with no shame
Every time I see this place
I am reminded why I'm so disgraced

The world goes up in flames
One last blade in my heart
The final exhale
Release me to a new start

The sky - Is an endless space
Dark gray - Eternal dusk
Great plains - Barren like my heart
Empty - It's a black cold world

Is this some kind of dream?
Why won't someone wake me?

The world goes up in flames
On last blade in my heart
The final exhale
Release me to a new start

The sky - Is an endless space
Dark gray - Eternal dusk
Great plains - Barren like my heart
Empty - It's a black cold world
