And another morning
With a peace I cannot find
Didn't heed the warnings
Of a past I left behind
I turned my head for too long
And now it's time to look within
Through the scattered ashes
Of this life that's worn so thin

I'm out of my head, I'm losing my mind
You think you've found the answer
Well, I'm looking for mine

A wasted life of wasted prayers
Trapped in this Hell, and no one cares
Nowhere to run, no place to go
This human bomb's set
ready to blow

A faceless opposition
To a world that's laced with sin

Clawing at their steel doors
Yet, they refuse to let you in

Just another human setup
On their rise up to the top

Mark my words
When I scale up there
I'll be the one to make them drop
No one shall hear your cries
And now will you be missed
A new day's dawning
With great pride I pull the switch

I'm out of my head, I've lost my mind
You think you've found the answer
Well, I've found mine

A wasted life of wasted prayers
Trapped in this Hell, and no one cares
Nowhere to run, no place to go
This human bomb's set
Ready to blow

Vicious tunnel vision
I've grown numb to your bite
Lethal ammunition with no choice left
But! To strike

There is nothing you can do
No wish, or faith will pull you through
Apologize? Well, it's too late
Now! Suffer your ferocious fate
