Say what you will
There's no feeling inside me
Trust in this clever disguise
Blending right in
With no scruples
I'm guilt free
Drown in these dark hollow eyes

You'll face me you'll taste me
You crave me now
Can't blame me can't shame me
Make you mine - I vow

Took what I want for centuries
I'm wealthy
With all your worldly desires
Riddled with class
I've drained queens of their bounty
Hopelessly lost in the mire

You'll face me you'll taste me
You crave me now
Can't blame me can't shame me
Make you mine - I vow

Son of the morning
Reaps your heavenly loss
Son of the morning
Negates the shield of your cross
Son of the morning
And I demand respect
Son of the morning
And I defy death

I find solace in damnation
My presence can't denied
Worthless coward now forbidden
In my world you're despised

You'll face me you'll taste me
You crave me now
Can't blame me can't shame me
Make you mine - I vow

Son of the morning
Reaps your heavenly loss
Son of the morning
Negates the shield of your cross
Son of the morning
And I demand respect
Son of the morning
And I defy death
