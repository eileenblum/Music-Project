Fight the enemy deep inside
The oppressor buried inside my mind
His strength is growing day by day
While mine seems to be slipping away

Time guiltless time - Flawed design
Poisoned mind - Don't save me
No more laws - Hopeless cause
Ruthless crime - Don't save me

Thoughts barrage me left, and right
These voices command me day, and night
Slamming my head against the walls
Pain the only solace at all

Time guiltless time - Flawed design
Poisoned mind - Don't save me
No more laws - Hopeless cause
Ruthless crime - Don't save me

If it's too late
Would somebody send me a sign?
It's too late
Degenerative state of mind

Death's ominous wicked laugh
Scream as they bind me to the rack
Stiff! Frozen to the core
Quartered! Torn my steeds of war

Time guiltless time - Flawed design
Poisoned mind - Don't save me
No more laws - Hopeless cause
Ruthless crime - Don't save me
