I wash my hands of the troubled past
A brand new feast and I trimmed the fat
Our time is precious, we start anew
The fruits abundant without you

A chance to deliver, prepared to attack
What's rightfully ours and we'll take it all back
No time for reflection, just time to proceed
A non-stop mission of force, and release

We won't be up-ended
and we won't be denied
Relentless revolution
Join us or step aside

A chance to deliver, prepared to attack
What's rightfully ours and we'll take it all back
No time for reflection, just time to proceed
A non-stop mission of force, and release

We won't be up-ended
and we won't be denied
Relentless revolution
Join us or step aside

The selfish remain in a world unjust
The wretched do pay for the power they lust
And they will feel when their world cracks
A blood red sky and seas of black

We won't be up-ended
and we won't be denied
Relentless revolution
Join us or step aside
