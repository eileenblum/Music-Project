Retribution, just solution
There's no other way
Haunted by your actions
of which you have yet to pay
Caustic bursts of filth
That just spew out of that mouth
Bone splitting cold
Now that you have been locked out

Egotism, disillusioned
Can you see the end
Seditious to your family
and seditious to your friends
Tears of joy were shed
on the day that you were born
ON the day you'll die
There will be no one there to mourn

And I thought by now you'd learn
Now it is your turn

Childhood choices
Adult divorces
You have paved your way
Strike another lady lover
See how long she'll stay
Embezzle money, coward, phony
You have brought this hate

Abomination, deviation
Start another war
Brothers stay and fight
As you flee out the back door

Isolation, desolation
Mercy I will lack
Cherishing the day
I lay you flat out on your back

And I thought by now you'd learn
Now it is your turn

Childhood choices
Adult divorces
You have paved your way
Strike another lady lover
See how long she'll stay
Embezzle money, coward, phony
You have brought this hate
