You build up your walls
and burn a bridge with every fight
Cast crippling stones that do
offend with all of your might

And you're so convinced
Ignorant defense

Miles away the troops do roar
closer to their goal
Cast away alone you plot
Temperamental soul

River of rapture
Cleanse me whole
Nullify this plague
River of rapture
Mend these bones
So broken, so displaced

You hiss out the blame
for your tough and common life
Yet you made this choice
again to sit, not stand up and fight

Twisted point of view
Solely felt by you

Miles away the troops do storm
closer to their goal
cast away, alone you rot
Bitter angry soul

Rise up bleeding
knock me down
I'll get back up again
Always pushing forward
And I'll fight until the end

I will hear your voice no more
And you won't have a choice no more
Yet I will choose to bend no more
and you can't condescend no more
