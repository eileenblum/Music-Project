Claws in so deep they're ripping through the other side
Lured into this trap with broken promises and lies
Conceal the taste of turpentine and serpent's kiss
On and on and on it never ends this fucking mess

Upon black wings another messenger from hell
The parasitic disillusion
Secrete the blood of life and left an empty shell
Reject the counterfeit transfusion

Claws in so deep they're tearing flesh and splitting bone
Left without a breath to rot and die there all alone
Their feast begins when you accept all hope is lost
Wear a crown of thorns until they nail you to the cross

Upon black wings another messenger from hell
The parasitic disillusion
Secrete the blood of life and left an empty shell
Reject the counterfeit transfusion

As sheep led to the slaughter
Trust in the devil's daughter
The well of poison water
The fever burning hotter
Is killing us all

Claws in so deep they've broken homes and severed ties
Offering their trust just like a spider to a fly
Deceptive truth lies in refuge behind the lie
Take and take and take until the day you fucking die

Upon black wings another messenger from hell
The parasitic disillusion
Secrete the blood of life and left an empty shell
Reject the counterfeit transfusion

As sheep led to the slaughter
Trust in the devil's daughter
The well of poison water
The fever burning hotter
Is killing us all
