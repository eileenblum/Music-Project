Now that push turned to shove, damn it!
and my mind is my own
Still you poke and you prod daily
with that off-setting harsh tone
And you thought that you had me
Underground with no doubt
Now the dirt lays on you heavy
Rusty blade cut that tongue out

Wise to your dealings
Wise to your games
Wise to the way you abrogate
The truth for self-gain

While the air keeps growing thinner
And my grip remains tight
Maybe now you'll reflect
On how you tortured me day and night
You saw my bones getting shattered
Along with my pride
And on that dreadful day
You watched my heart, empty out and die

Wise to your dealings
Wise to your games
Wise to the way you abrogate
The truth for self-gain

It's a brand new day
And it's a brand new crisis
But was it worth the win
When you see what the price is

You say the past is the past, huh?
Just water under your bridge
Well today that bridge collapsed
Upon the sea that won't soon forgive
And no you're not immune
and you've created this monster
Now you just walk like a fool
Into the arms of righteous anger
