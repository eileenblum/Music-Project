Scorching down the mountain
With a roar of thunder
Ravenous undertow
That drags you under
Violent thrashing in the jaws of fury
Scathing hate from the one man jury

The final day
The final night
Devoid of sound
Absence of light

Valleys of grey
in a world so toxic
Slither through the muck
of the now dead, once sick
Sniffing out prey
For the final cleansing
No allies, no love, too late for mending

Flowing from your skull
like molten lava
The warmth of your blood
Heats the freezing horror
Shred fingers to the bone
Clawing walls unseen
Clinging to your faith
So god damn obscene

Rats strip the bones
of vermin like you
Hypocrite supreme
As you preach your virtue
Scald of your charm
Now taste the backlash
Choking in a storm
of human ash
