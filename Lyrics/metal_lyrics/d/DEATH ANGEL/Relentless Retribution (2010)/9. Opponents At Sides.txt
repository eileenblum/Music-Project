From the day they were born these brothers
had sworn to be unified
Through the thick and thin no matter
lose or win together till they die
Out to conquer the world, destiny unfurled
before their very eyes
Forever living the dream or so it seemed
beneath the hidden lies

Look to the left and right
The enemy in sight

They will earn your trust
They will call you brother
They will be your friend
Then turn and trade you for another

In the days of the sun they were killing
as one solid death machine
No one stood in their way, but the price
to be paid yet remained unseen
Then along came the rain bringing
with it the pain and disarray
The colors started to fade turning into
a grey shadow of yesterday

Look to the left and right
Attack by day or night

They will earn your trust
They will call you brother
They will be your friend
Then turn and trade you for another

Lies - Corruption - Self-Indulgence
Greed - Deceit - Wolves in the sheep

They will earn your trust
They will call you brother
They will be your friend
Then turn and trade you for another
