Like a freight train blow to the chest
You taste the backhand slap from God
But you say that nothing's new
You've lived a life of pain and loss
The scars you bare attest
To the trials you've overcome
But proud, you plant your feet
Where stronger men had to run

What do you feel inside
Under the wheels of life
A truce forgotten, a truce erased
This heart you've opened has already been replaced

Woke from a heavy sleep
With a call that broke you the news
You had to hear it twice and
Both times it ripped and pierced you through
So now you stand alone
Looking down upon this mess
Another day creeps by, yes
Another day, another test

What do you feel inside
Under the wheels of life
A truce forgotten, a truce erased
This heart you've opened has already been replaced

What you've gained from this life
Is nothing, dues remain
Take or give, makes no difference
You still feel the shame

What do you feel inside
Under the wheels of life
A truce forgotten, a truce erased
This heart you've opened has already been replaced
