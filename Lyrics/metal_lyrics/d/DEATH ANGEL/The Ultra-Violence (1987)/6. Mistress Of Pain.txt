Enter her lair
Deep in her lair
The tension you feel
Is burning inside
You meet her at last
It happened so fast
The look in her eyes
There's nowhere to hide
Pain on her mind
Eternal and blind
Everything's black
But you're turning white
She knocks you down
Whips you around
Nothing is heard
But your screams in the night

Mistress of pain
Lady of domination
Executes her discipline
Upon her bonded slaves
Lashing you with her whips
Keeping you bonded in chains
Drool starts to seep through her lips
Gets off on affliction of pain
Violence in her eyes
Insatiable lust
Terminal mistake
Face to face with death
