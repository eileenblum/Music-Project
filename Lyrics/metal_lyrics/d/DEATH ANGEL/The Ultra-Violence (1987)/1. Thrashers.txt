Metal mayhem; hit the stage
Thrashing to the madness,
You can feel the rage!

Denim, leather, in the crowd
Feel your ears are bleeding,
Wanna hear it loud!

Thrasher! [4x]

Posers strike us in the back
I canât take their bullshit,
Turn around and attack
(Attack!)

Metal bodies slamming into me,
How I live my life
And baby canât you see?

Thrashers! [4x]

Smashing, thrashing, on your knees
You beg for mercy
Smashing, thrashing, on your knees
You plead for mercy

Thrasher! [4x]

Fighting, fall off the stage
Screaming with a rage
Thrashing, lose control
Smashing I like drugs
Madness, all around
Falling to the ground
Dying for your breath
Living to your death

Thrashing, smashing, on their knees
You beg for mercy
Thrashing, smashing, on their knees
You plead for mercy

Thrasher! [4x]
