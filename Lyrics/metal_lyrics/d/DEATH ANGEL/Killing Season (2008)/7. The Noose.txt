Glorify
Your heart replaced by wealth
Compromise
You lost all sense of self
Mesmerize
You're numb to what you've done
Scarred your daughter
Bastardized you son

You're the reason - Face Me
They let go. Lost all hope.
Oppressor
Killing Season - Face Me
You must know you will go
Defector

Crystallize
The Blood within your veins
Crucify
all Idols you have shamed
vilify
The ones who speak the truth
A day will come when you will wear THE NOOSE

You're the reason - Face Me
They let go. Lost all hope.
Oppressor
Killing Season - Face Me
You must know you will go
Defector
