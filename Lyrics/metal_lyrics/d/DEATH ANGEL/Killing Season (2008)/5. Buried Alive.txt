One murder coming on
Say I'm wrong for all I've done
Are you god to judge us all?
Prophet false with a jury hung

Home
An empty shell of a living hell
A human zoo full of cannibals
Backwards life it's a dirty world
Where your dreams can't be heard

A shallow grave is where I dwell
Buried alive within this cell
A shadow cast upon my fate
Deliver me to the one who waits

Guilt, Regret, and Innocence
Full of lies, and corruption
Suffocate while the worms infest
Underground. Take one last breath

Home
An empty shell of a living hell
A human zoo full of cannibals
Backwards life it's a dirty world
Where your dreams can't be heard

A shallow grave is where I dwell
Buried alive within this cell
A shadow cast upon my fate
Deliver me to the one who waits

Visions of life start to flash
as the dirt rains down
How does your so called god
get off on this

Blackness descending on me
in this hole in the ground
No longer will I see the light of day
The saints are gonna make the sinner pay
And maggots are waiting to feast on my flesh
