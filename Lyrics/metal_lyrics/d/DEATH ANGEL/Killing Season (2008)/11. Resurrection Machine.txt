The sun has risen out of the sea
It's an illusion just the devil's trickery
Meant to deceive us, to lead us on
To break us down until the will to live is gone

NEVER â¢ MOVE â¢ HEART

Only death stands between this life and the ever after
Nothing to fear, there's no end and there is no final chapter
Feel no pain

The stars have fallen out of the sky
Pay no attention to the devil's evil eye
Meant to distract us, lead us astray
To throw us off our course until we've lost the way

NEVER â¢ MOVE â¢ HEART

Only death stands between this life and the ever after
Nothing to fear, there's no end and there is no final chapter
Feel no pain

Time drifts on, past is gone
Won't be long, must be strong

When the time has come to say goodbye
To all the ones we love
We shall not fear our fate or destiny

The Gods have spoken, thy will be done
Foretell the future of thy kingdom that will come
Still we ride onward on wings of black
Long as we live there'll be no end to our attack

NEVER â¢ MOVE â¢ HEART

Only death stands between this life and the ever after
Nothing to fear, there's no end and there is no final chapter
Feel no pain
