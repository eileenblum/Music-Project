Arise, and see your beaten master
is hungry for his spoon
His cries are met by joyous laughter
and stones from dusk till noon

He preyed upon the innocent
and thought forever more
Today He broke like fragile bones
A master-He's no more

Lord of Hate
Repercussion
Lord of Hate
For your corruption

Someday He'll stain the pages of
All books of history
The fool. The Joke. The laughing stock
What will be his legacy

Lord of Hate
Repercussion
Lord of Hate
For your destruction

And his myth
is fading quick
Set adrift
Like a sinking ship

Lord of Hate
Lord of fraud
Lord you've been exposed
PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD!

Lord of Hate
Repercussion
Lord of Hate
For your destruction

And his myth
is fading quick
Set adrift
Like a sinking ship

Lord of Hate
Lord of fraud
Lord you've been exposed
PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD!
