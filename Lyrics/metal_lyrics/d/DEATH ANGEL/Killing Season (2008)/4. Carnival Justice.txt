Step up it's time to face
Punishment from a different age
Are you witch or heretic
Wandering lost convicts

Take a look you'll see
It's much bigger than you or me
Future sadomasochism
Leather whips and hardcore rhythm
Make you fear make you tear
Memories that scar for years
Drain your brain of guilt and regret
What's your last request

Endless pain
Living hell
No drawn out trial
No Bars No Cell

Shut up don't be a fool
Electrocution make you drool
Burn your skin in search of truth
Sink or float either way you lose

Dead man walking straight to die
Eat last supper read last rites
Obsessed erotic with a mind possessed
Hug the blade one last caress
Cut the hand gouge the eye
Hung and whipped and burnt alive
A flood of blood A sea of pain
Torture modern day

Endless pain
Living hell
No drawn out trial
No Bars No Cell

Dead man walking straight to die
Eat last supper read last rites
Obsessed erotic with a mind possessed
Hug the blade one last caress
Cut the hand gouge the eye
Hung and whipped and burnt alive
A flood of blood A sea of pain
Torture modern day
