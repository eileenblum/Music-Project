You know I need you
But you keep me at bay
I cannot leave you
I can't get away
I see your shadow
everywhere I turn
You stole my future.
Left my heart here to burn

Hand in Hand
We flew to the sky
I lost my grip
and alone I can't fly
I want to take you
to a future so vast
I can't cut ties
with my dark dreary past

God versus God
Worship blood
Selfish greed
when I need
Pierce my flesh
Set me Free

First time I felt you
knew that you were the one
A sacred healer
Magic warmth like the sun
You built a wall
That's so hard to scale
Can't break these chains
and I'm destined to fail

My mind is racing
I don't want you to go
It's just a fact
Don't say it ain't so
The ones you need
They always leave
It's ones you loathe
Who make it so hard to breathe

God versus God
Worship blood
Selfish greed
when I need
Pierce my flesh
Set me Free

Don't want to be your slave
Sent to an early grave
God! Won't you heal this part of me

Been down for far too long
Kicked out! Again I'm wrong
God! Won't you heal this part of me

God versus God
Worship blood
Selfish greed
when I need
Pierce my flesh
Set me Free

Don't want to be your slave
Sent to an early grave

God! Won't you heal this part of me

Been down for far too long
Kicked out! Again I'm wrong
God! Won't you heal this part of me

Don't want to be your slave!
