I lie awake
What will they think?
What will they say?
Probably nothing

No walls there could hold me
No walls there could mold me
People step aside
You're wasting time

No walls there could hold me
No walls there could mold me
People step aside
You're wasting my time trying
Teachers couldn't teach it
No ones arms could reach it
You all just abide and
Watch your rights get stolen

[Pre-chorus:]
Cast away my soul and begin
Hypnotized by a killing moon

[Chorus:]
Dethroned
Take a life away
Dethroned
nothing left to say
Dethroned
Long time coming
victim in the eyes of a savior gunning
Dethroned

Jesus didn't show me
Neighbors didn't know me
Revolution start today
Nail the truth, kill the sin

Cameras will not see it
No one will believe it
A horror in the crowd
Now bathe your king in fire

Cast away my soul and begin
Hypnotized by a killing moon

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
