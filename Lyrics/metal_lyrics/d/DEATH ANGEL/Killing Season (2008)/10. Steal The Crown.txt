Hey people can you hear it?
Can you even feel it? All the lies
From inside, and down below
They're casting you aside like you don't know

Don't! Don't be worth your weight
Don't be worth your weight in dumb
They're sitting high in palaces
Eating platinum pie tossing you the crumbs

Go!
Get up, and Go!
Go!
Get up, and Go!

Stand up, and start to scream!
No need to bend No compromise
Speak your mind, and hold your ground
We're blasting off while they come crashing down

Smash! Smash down every wall
Smash down every wall, and door
Let's steal the crown, and seize the floor
till We're on top, and they're no more

Go!
Get up, and Go!
Go!
Get up, and Go!

On your feet
Let's lash out! We'll keep coming
Hit the street
Let's break out of this cage
Exercise your right
with extreme power
Decimate their kind
With extreme Rage!

Go!
Get up, and Go!
Go!
Get up, and Go!

On your feet
Let's lash out! We'll keep coming
Hit the street
Let's break out of this cage
Exercise your right
with extreme power
Decimate their kind
With extreme Rage!
