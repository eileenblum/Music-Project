Take to the water
We'll take to the skies
Battle eternal
of infinite size

Question salvation
In time you'll rot
Grave disposition
Alliance is lost

Which way to face
Nowhere to run
Disaster is constant
No shade from the sun

This Generation
Walks wounded alive
Invaded castrated
When worlds collide

Screw Your countries
and fuck your states
Selfish desires
Have sealed your fate

Swallow confession
You'll gain not a pound
Maimed declaration
Black Planet No sound

Which way to face
Nowhere to turn
disaster is constant
No shade from the burn

This Generation
Walks wounded alive
Invaded castrated
When worlds collide

History repeats itself
for the final time
A once endless cycle
reached the end of the line

Canyons of division
Signify your doom
Rivers bleed denial
re-infect the wound

History invites itself
To the final meal
A once dormant plague
Impossible to heal

Canyons of division
Signify your doom
Rivers bleed denial
Re-infect the wound

This generation
Walks wounded alive
Invaded castrated
When worlds collide
