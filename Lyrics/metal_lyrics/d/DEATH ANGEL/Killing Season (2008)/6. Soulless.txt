We arrive, and are blinded
by twisted rubble, and piercing light
Screaming sounds of the sirens
Rip through the air on this sleepless night

Take this boy, and remind him
Just how fragile his un-sewn life
His daily dose of destruction
Sleeps with his gun, his surrogate wife

Mother fears the door
Baby's off at war
just like dad before
Left soulless

Promised there's an end
Just around the bend
Lost another friend
Left Soulless

Soulless ghost in the air
Helpless feeling of despair
Broken Body, Scarred mind
They're Soulless

Men, women, and children
Huddle together, or stand and fight
Enemies, or our allies
Can't tell the difference. He's blind with fright

He reads letters from Mother
Shares photographs from another life
Falling to friendly fire
Today was this heroes final fight

Mother fears the door
Baby's off at war
just like dad before
Left soulless

Promised there's an end
Just around the bend
Lost another friend
Left Soulless
Soulless ghost in the air
Helpless feeling of despair
Broken Body, Scarred mind
They're Soulless

Left Shameless
Left Nameless
Left Faithless
Left Soulless

Soulless ghost in the air
Helpless feeling of despair
Broken Body, Scarred mind
They're Soulless

Left Sightless
Left Mindless
Left Heartless
Left Hopeless

Gone insane endless pain
Enter the room to find there's no one left
Guiltless time Poisoned mind
Mocking clocks they chime. You're in traction
Wasted days Again betrayed
A once honored hero now stains the mattress
No one calls Blood stained walls
Mother needle holds you to her breast
Skin, and Bones
Your life is left Soulless
