[music by cavestany, lyrics by osegueda]

raise your hands to the sky
on your knees and abide
don't stare into the sun
the new saviours have come

and you choose your wine
like you chose your friends
and you base your life
on each passing trend

and i say
no to false claims
no to their aims
no to all of their rules

we've come to save your soul
we must regain control
it's the end of their reign
our day has come again

and you choose your wine
like you chose your friends
and you base your life
on each passing trend

and i say
no to false claims
no to their aims
no to all of their rules

You've been blown off course
we've come to take you north
in the eye of the storm

history's been reborn

and you choose your wine
like you chose your friends
and you base your life
on each passing trend

and i say
no to false claims
no to their aims
no to all of their rules

we've been sent back
surprise attack
we've been sent back
surprise attack
we've been sent back
surprise attack
we've been sent back
surprise attack
