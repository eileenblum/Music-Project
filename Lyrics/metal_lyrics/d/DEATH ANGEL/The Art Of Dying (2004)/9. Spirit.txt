[music by galeon, lyrics by galeon]

dream awake eyes open wide
drain the poison kill the lie
life is now there is no end
never know what might have been

spirit never fade away
i can never forget that day
beyond the grave
spirit never fade
never fade away
spirit never fade

things that you fear the most
the same damn things you hold close
try hard as steel till nothing's left
it'll come when you least expect

spirit never fade away
i can never forget that day
beyond the grave
spirit never fade
never fade away
spirit never fade

in your mind suspended in time
different lives different times
worls collide memory blinds
peace is hard to find
spirit or ghost
have i lost my mind
hope is alive
carry us through time

dream awake eyes open wide
drain the poison kill the lie
life is now there is no end
never know what might have been

spirit never fade away
i can never forget that day
beyond the grave
spirit never fade
spirit never fade
never fade away
spirit never fade
never fade away
