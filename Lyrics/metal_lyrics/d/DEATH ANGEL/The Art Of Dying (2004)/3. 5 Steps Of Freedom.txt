[music by cavestany/galeon/pepa, lyrics by galeon]

grip the bars that hold my mind
and pace the cell that's stuck in time
immune to change and far from love
i curse this world and God above

life is a cage when you're framed and confined
sentence of pain 25 to life
i breathe in the sky as i recall the past
and realize these are my last

need to kill this painful lie
look over shoulder with my hand on knife
i can't keep living my life this way
i'll do my time but i won't behave

life is a cage when you're framed and confined
sentence of pain 25 to life
i breathe in the sky as i recall the past
and realize these are my last

the road to hell is paved with good intent
pass barbed wire and cyclone fence
destiny lies far from this place
a cemetary plot my final resting place

got to break this soulless cage
return my life to human shape
a hell on earth is what they say
kill or be killed same shit different day

life is a cage when you're framed and confined
sentence of pain 25 to life
i breathe in the sky as i recall the past
and realize these are my last
i breathe in the sky as i recall the past
and realize these are my last

5 steps of freedom
5 steps of freedom
5 steps of freedom
5 steps
5 steps
5 steps
5
