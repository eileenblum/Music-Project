[music by cavestany, lyrics by osegueda]

smell you eye you
how rapid the chase it is on
swat you bite you
locked on your neck and you're down

i can't believe that you're trying to put up a fight
try as you will but you'll never forget this dark night
can't you see that to us it's not labor it's love
(oh no)
thicker than blood

rip you tear you
peeling your flesh to the core
crave you need you
your taste leaves us wanting much more

i can't believe that you're trying to put up a fight
try as you will but you'll never forget this dark night
can't you see that to us it's not labor it's love
(oh no)
thicker than blood

chew you eat you
savoring every small bite
own you crush you
night after night after night

i can't believe that you're trying to put up a fight
try as you will but you'll never forget this dark night
can't you see that to us it's not labor it's love
(oh no, oh no, oh no)
thicker than blood
thicker than blood
