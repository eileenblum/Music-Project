In the night
In the circle of death
They congregate to hold a feast
There lies a body in the center of the ring
Each human soon becomes a beast

They sing the song to glorify the dead
They chant, the chant eternal life
The master sails as he lifts the gleaming blade
The sound of flesh sliced by the knife

Men without anguish
Men without fear
Men chosen to ride the earth
Evil confrontation nears

These mindless sinners
Sit there without
Greed, not even grief
The final incision
Having now been complete
As these ominous demons
Start to eat

A strident hum
Lurks through the room
The bloody bath to set them free
As they fulfill their long awaited dream
A bloody orgy of intense ecstasy
