His eyes are fiery
The flame burns within
He wreaks of murder
His mind filled with sin
The sickening stench
Of blood on his breath
This villainous beast
This angel of death

They hear the noise
The people in the town
They cringe in fear
Frightened by the sound
A sacrifice is required to live
Must choose a girl
In which they must give

Victim is falling
Many died without a sound
Victims crawling
Bodies laying all around

He once was a clergy man
Swore to bring peace to lands
Lustful doings not foreseen
He blames it on Satan's screams

His mind is twisted
Schizophrenic freak
Once in his presence
Demons dare not speak
His piece of meat
Must be young and fresh
He loves to feast
Upon her tender flesh

Now he has risen
Holy powers fell
Anti religion
Mercenary from hell
The town has fallen
Southeast of Wales
In this backwards legend
The evil priest prevails

Men were slaughtered left and right
Virgins couldn't sleep at night
Raping many, victims fell
This evil priest was born in hell !!!
