It began on a winter day, I was so cold, you appeared from nowhere.
I felt I was losing control. Structures that keeps the feelings away.

Do you believe that sticks and stones will save you passing through the chaos
Drew mental pictures of our minds, trying to explain, the unknown.

I stared into your unfiltered abyss, it's six feet under. A mystery. You say that you, are broken.

I see the end, rising up through the sphere.
We fear our own skin!

The distance and the time, between us, sets two people apart.
You said our prophets are from the future, they bend the time, there is no illusion.

Hearts don't break they bend, like time.
Relativity is law, haven't we been here before?

I see the end, rising up through the sphere.
We fear our own skin!

You tell stories about your past, set them in contrast.
Follow your ship towards your past
That float through sorrow!

You said that your time here is borrowed, that you are an old and fragile soul.
Out of control, out of control!
