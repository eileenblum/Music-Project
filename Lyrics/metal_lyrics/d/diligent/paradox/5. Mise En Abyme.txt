It flows in one direction, and still it hits you hard.
The future stares back in the mirror.

A parallel frequency, it echoes back, unable to grasp.

You can believe in anything. All things begin, and ends with the past.
You can believe in anything. It's all the same, it's all the same!

Glimpse through the veil of time and space, see it warp around itself.
Black holes, they are the universes version of hell.

Earth to dust dust to earth, what is it worth.
Cluster of energy, in motion, is there an universal emotion?

You can believe in anything. All things begin, and ends with the past.
You can believe in anything. It's all the same, it's all the same.
It's all the same!

Breath in, breath out, in the hour of need, killing time.
The horizon is there just annihilate, me!

We are building new worlds â rather than discover our own
Is it 'cause we're afraid,
That we are so god damn alone? So god damn alone!

You can believe in anything. All things begin, and ends with the past.
You can believe in anything. It's all the same, it's all the same!
