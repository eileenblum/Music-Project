Am I only here to serve
Only to become what they have in store
My presence has no value
My presence is nothing worth
My fear of their selfish thoughts
Makes my inside sore

I am controlled and my reflection is not what it used to be
I know what's right and wrong
But their grip is too tight on me
I've lost my self control
I don't know what's right and wrong!

If I try to speak my mind, my lungs will be torn
I try to move my body, then my bones will break!

I'm all alone!

I'm all alone in the dark and I, I have travelled far.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions

What separates good from bad? This crossroad is too much to bare.
I asked myself, is someone really there?!

Looking up in the stratosphere!

If I try to speak my mind, my lungs will be torn
If I try to move my body, then my bones will...
Bones will break!

Then I pulled myself together and became more self aware
The seal that held me down slowly lifted
And now I am in control
I opened my heart â and let it out!
