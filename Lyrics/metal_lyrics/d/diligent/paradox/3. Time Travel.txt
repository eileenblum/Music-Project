Through my mind â nothing is logical â travel back, to that which makes me child
Details are sublime, the truth is compromised. It's more than I can take!

My heart
Skips a beat
My heart
Can't even stand on my feet

I feel the same, yet so different!
Am I to blame, my fears and doubts.
I am lost, in my inner space.
Mental patterns, ways of thinking, built them up for years
I want to break!

What am I thinking about? What are my drives?
How can you know someone, when you don't know yourself?
Can you even trust anyone, when you don't trust yourself?
What am I thinking about, I am lost!

It's only time that sets them apart, it's like the moon and the hourglass
Back and forth, circles and cycles.
Time is a constant, yet it's running out.

It feels like ages!
I turn my back from myself, an undiscovered lie.

I feel the same, yet so different!
Am I to blame, my fears and doubts.

I feel the same, yet so different!
Am I to blame, my fears and doubts.
I am lost, in my inner space.
Mental patterns, ways of thinking, built them up for years!
