My unconsciousness, wants to die, why do I still live in a fucking lie?
Productivity by the seconds, counting down the hours, longing to be free.
But when the shackles don't constrain me! What should I believe?

Time flies in â relation, to your perception
Isn't it real, a mental construction?
Intervals between night and day!

We strive, for growth by burning everything ashes,
There is no phoenix to guide us home!

They say you shall never feel pain, there is only sun and it never rains.
Productivity by the seconds, counting down the hours, longing to be free
But when the shackles don't constrain me!

Want to shift time zone to one that does not belong to this universe
Mathematical patterns, runs like nihilistic clockwork!

What should I believe?

Time flies in â relation, to your perception
Isn't it real, a mental construction?
Intervals between night and day!

We strive for growth by burning everything ashes,
There is no phoenix to guide us home!
