Somewhere in time, somewhere in space,
For many, many centuries
The equilibrium between good and bad has reigned over the lands
Supervised by Alean, the planet Goddess.
Till one day, when demons managed to concentrate the bad side
On the top of the Hill Vorneas,
Now known as the Hill of Agony,
And gave birth to two entities,
The mighty and evil emperor Zul'Dahr
And Mogrod, the Rotting One...

This is where Mallek's crusade against evil will begin...
