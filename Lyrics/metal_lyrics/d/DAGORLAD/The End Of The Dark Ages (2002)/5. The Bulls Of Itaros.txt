He saw and heard the signs.
First the howling of the wolves
Far away, who could smell the presence
Of the distant danger coming.
Then the small animals
Running and hiding,
Even the flowers, closing,
As if darkness came.

Coming home
His attention got caught by the metal glittering
Of of his huge double ax
Then he knew, it was time to take the weapons
To face the unknown enemy.

And they came, twelve men,
All clothed in majestic black
Bearing the malefic purple
Two-headed eagle.

At that moment
All became clear,
His mission charged by Alean.
No way to escape,
As the warriors slowly locked him in.

Suddenly, a trembling noise,
Like thunder, the ground trembling.
They came from depths of the forest,
The legendary Bulls of Itaros.

Thousands of tons of violent flesh.
Destroying everything on their way,
Mallek, himself remained untouched,
Could feel the power of nature

Suddenly, a trembling noise,
Like thunder, the ground trembling.
They came from depths of the forest,
The legendary Bulls of Itaros.

When they were gone,
The bodies of the enemy
Trampled down,
In a sea of blood.
Mallek started his journey,
Heading to the Hill of Agony
To face the enemy...

Having seen the defeat of his troops
In the Cauldron of Death,
Zul'Dahr understood, big powers protected the man from the forest.
He immediately ordered Mogrod to invoke
The demon Neflit, by use of the mighty powers of the Hades,
Coming from the Cauldron.
The emperor was now pretty sure to be able
To eliminate the threat.
