Not long later, In the plane of Vorneas,
Life took back it's place.
Flowers, trees, bushes grew,
Animals came, Making disappear
The last traces of the battle.
The plane, fertile,
Attracted people,
Who built their houses there
And lived in harmony with nature.
From Zul'Dahr's empire of evil,
By the sacrifice of Mallek,
No trace remained.
The past, covered by the dense forest of Vorneas.
