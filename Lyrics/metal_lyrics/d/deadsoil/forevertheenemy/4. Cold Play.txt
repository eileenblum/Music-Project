Proven worng of what i used to believe in
now i live on the shattered remains

lift your mask and show me your true face
open your mouth and create your lies
i watch behind your fakes and burst your lies

Proven wrong of words i used to build my thruth upon
now i live on the shattered remains

come on play your games we'll see who wins
come on make your moves in this cold play

Lay your cards open, you think you got straight flash
but remember the once who laughs and last, laughs best

We'll see who wins
