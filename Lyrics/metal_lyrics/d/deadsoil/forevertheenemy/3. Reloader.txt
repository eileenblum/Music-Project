Crashin' and Burnin'
From zero to top and back down

Trapped in this train of thought with my head go crush against the wall
Try to set things clear for me, pray with bloodshot eyes
underneath blackened skies
Why? why does it have to be this way?
Biting Bullets, Reload, Drawback - over and over again

I turn my face into the cold hard rain
I'm getting drenched but i hold my fuckin' own
Gotta find my way - won't get lost in your games
this stance runs fucking deep thru my vains
Feels like Failure on the whole scale
so much shit that let me grow so cold inside
the world looks different from down below
burned out days, close to the end - but I've grown

Could be a march straight up a dead end but i won't waste any time
'cos i don't look back in regret...hell no...fuck you!

I'm still breathing

Hard luck builds believes, now i'm running with thieves and try not to slip

proven wrong of what i used to believe in 
Erase the past, Reload, drawback - once and for all
