Once that i had you
Now i know I lost it all

Slowly becoming my own worst nightmare
with arms wide open for my misery
i hate myself for it - this is far beyond repair
No more comfort - i stare eyes wide open(into darkness)

Pushed into Ruin
You can't lifht the weight with two broken arms
Pury your hope in a safe place 'cos they're out to crush you

My saving Grace, where are you now?

Pushed into ruin
