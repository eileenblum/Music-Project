How many times they slammed your face to the concrete?
How many times left on a loosing track?
How many times they make you feel like your nothing?

I breath out strength wipe the shame of my face
I breath out strength down but not out and I arise

In the city of burned out hope where insomnia kills all sanity
I spit my dreams on your sidewalks and my pain right into your face

You can't lock it up - won't hold me down

You feed yourself lies from hand to mouth
Fucking choke on 'em your shit is worn out
No matter what you can fix the damage
thats what you made of me: Forever your enemy

GET OUT!

How many times they slammed your face to the concrete?
How many times left on a loosing track?
How many times they make you feel like your nothing?

FIGHT!

I breath out strength wipe the shame of my face
I breath out strength down but not out and I arise

In the city of burned out hope where insomnia kills all sanity
I spit my dreams on your sidewalks and my pain right into your face
