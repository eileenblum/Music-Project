Tell you what it takes to be strong, make no mistake about what I say,
Gaining strength for the words, put you on your ass now again,
Energy, is our game, intensity from our name,
you line 'em up we'll tear 'em down, tell the circle's coming 'round!
TELL YOU WHAT I, DO-I-DO, EVERYTHING I, SAY-I-SAY, TELL YOU WHAT I, DO-I-DO, FOLLOW THE SEVEN,
ONE EIGHT...
TELL YOU WHAT I, DO-I-DO, EVERYTHING I, SAY-I-SAY, TELL YOU WHAT I, DO-I-DO, 187 WAY!
We bring the noise down to you, the words within they drive through, the meaning of them is all
you need to hear, to stand tall,
Just believe once in you, there's nothing that you can't do, now its time to realize, flush all
the shit from your life!
