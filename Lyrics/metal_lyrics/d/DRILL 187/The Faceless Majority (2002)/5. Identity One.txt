Inside me lies the feelin', the voice inside is screamin!
RAGE! RAGE!
Inside me lies the feelin', a burden on my soul,
the voice inside is screamin', I've taken all I can now!
YOU'LL NEVER TRAMPLE ON ME, AGAIN! AGAIN!
ONE MORE SAMPLE I'M BLEEDING, AGAIN! AGAIN!
I'm on to what you're thinking, my senses...they overide,
The depths to which you're sinking, to bring me on to your side!
RAGE! RAGE!
I'm on to what you're thinking, my senses...they override,
The depths to which you're sinking, to bring me on to your side!
Visions in my mind, I don't believe though I see them, shaking my faith in all I ever thought
was real, Why now? Why me? Bring me down so easily, all that I want, all that I feel, taken away
from me....
