I feel you within...you claim you can show me the way...
The lesson's about to begin...listen to me I heard you say..
The touch of an angel inviting, its so out of line, I'm crossing the line, will I?
Your breath caressing my skin, its so out of line, I'm crossing the line, will I?
MY SIN Conceals the light, will I SHINE again?..
Slowly it fades...so scared I'll lose myself again...
Reveal my charade...so hard to find the words to say...
The touch of an angel inviting, its so out of line, I'm crossing the line, will I?
Your breath caressing my skin, its so out of line, I'm crossing the line, will I?
MY SIN Conceals the light, will I SHINE again?..
