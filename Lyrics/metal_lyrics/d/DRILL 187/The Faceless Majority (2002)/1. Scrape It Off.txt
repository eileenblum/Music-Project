No words to say how you're feelin', can you see the words I'm reading, yes I'm bleeding,
pouring out of me..(Scrape it off again while I..)
Sacrifice my will to keep breathing, can you feel it taking over, trust in no one, why do you
want me...how can this be...
KEEP BELIEVIN' IN MYSELF...FACE THE MAN I WANT TO BE!! NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY...
KEEP BELIEVIN' IN MYSELF...SEE THE TRUTH INSIDE OF ME...NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY!
Fist to the face, are you reeling? Smack down the non-believers, true deceivers, they're lying
to me..(Scrape it off again while I ..)
Sacrifice my will to keep breathing, can you feel it taking over, trust in no one, why do you
want me...How can this be..
-inset-"I know this is real, so lonely but real"
I'm dying, do you give a fuck, scrape it off, forget where you come from, I'm dying, do you
give a fuck, scrape it off, forget where you've been.
I'm dying!...to break you! Scrape it off again while I!
