Tell me do you want it, do you need it, are you listening?
I hear you speak the words, but do they ever have any meaning...
This path that I'm walking, do you walk it? It's hard to see,
Will you join them as they take my humanity!
LETHAL! CULTIVATE! ONE STATE OF MIND, TAKING OVER ME...
LETHAL! DESTINY! MY STATE OF MIND, TAKING OVER ME...
Now make the connection, the obsession, is killing me,
Release the anger now, come and take it away,
In fact did I mention, nothing did I mention, you say!
Lead to believe, the means to justify my defensive!
Create a, lethal, judgment day! Adjust the way you're, judging me...
Lethal!
-inset-"I can taste your fear..."
Tell me a direction, are you taking, are you dissin' me?
A matter of opinion, leading to the path you're taking to get there,
Tell me how you're feelin, are you seein', so perfectly,
This deadly game you play, is gonna take a turn for the better
