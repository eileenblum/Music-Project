Visions of you in my mind, why can't I hide
Fragments of pain in my eyes, burning deep inside...
All my pain, killing me, its taking my breath away!
WHAT YOU SAY, YOU MAKE ME...DESPISE....
WHAT YOU SAY, YOU MAKE ME...DESPISE, DESPISE!
Twisting the knife in my heart, my heart...
Should have seen it from the start, and turned my back and walked...
Lack of space, in this place, its taking my breath away!
All my pain, killing me, taking my breath away!
