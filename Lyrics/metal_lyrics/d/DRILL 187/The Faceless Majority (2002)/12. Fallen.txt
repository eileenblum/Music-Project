Staring at the world, colored by jaded eyes
Feel the pressure peaking, leading to your demise...
Feed me, show me, my faith is your life,
Tortured, slaughtered, I will be your victim...
WE DON'T NEED NO...SAVIOR!
WE HAVE NO MORE...FAITH!
WE DON'T NEED NO ...SAVIOR!
Hiding behind your, cynical disguise
Lying right through the, truth inside your smile...
Tempted, by him, taken by your sin,
like him, strike him, slowly my life ends..
