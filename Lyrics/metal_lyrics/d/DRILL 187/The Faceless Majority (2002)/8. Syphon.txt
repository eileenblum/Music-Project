Its over, no chance for relations...no more will to try!
Breathe slowly, no need in obsession...Trying to deny!
Feel me! Taking control, taking it all can't take another..
Bleeding! Draining me of all my life..
Feed me! Taking control, taking it all, can't take another..
Breeding! Comes into my mind, change me from inside..
WHY...OH WHY..DO I FEEL? (indecision.....)
WHY...OH WHY..DON'T I FEEL? (recognition....)
Is that all I am, a possession...for you to control?
See me, who I am...my reflection...gaze into my soul..
