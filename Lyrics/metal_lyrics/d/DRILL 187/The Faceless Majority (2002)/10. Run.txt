Do you ever, feel like running away...but afraid to walk that road
Content with the fact that, never again...nothing can be the same
RUN!!RUN!! YOU BETTER RUN...DON'T FUCK WITH ME..
RUN!!RUN!! YOU BETTER RUN...DON'T WALK AWAY.....
Do you even, hear the things I say...or has your heart, begun to close
Will my soul to shine, through the pain....never to fall again!
Got no time to reason why..open up her mouth, you know she's going to tell you a lie..I'm sick
and tired of taking this, my life on the young and restless with a twist..through a shield of
broken lies, I've had enough of this shit, your through wastin' all of my time..should we deal
with it now or then?..all the same you fuckin' bitch!!
RUN, RUN, RIGHT OUT OF MY LIFE!
Do you ever feel like, running away...or has your heart begun to close,
Will my soul to shine on, through the pain...never to fall again!
