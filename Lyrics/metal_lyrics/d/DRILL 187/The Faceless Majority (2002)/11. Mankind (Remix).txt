Taking all my thoughts and pleasure, stolen my soul, its gone from me,
Feeding off me like a cancer, eating all my flesh and bone away...
FEAR! HATE! Bringer of your agony, how can I escape the pain in me..
SON OF MAN...CHANGING! LIVES!...
BY THE HAND..OF MAN!
Taking all that I can handle, twistin' the life, that you lead,
Bringing on me to dismantle, turning the brain-drain machine!
FEAR! HATE! Pleasure is mine to be, dealer of all your broken dreams..
"MAN-KIND!"
