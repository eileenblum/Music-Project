Start speaking the truth, disclose all knowledge
Stop misleading us with deceptive words
Piles of carrion camouflaged with lies
Still hiding behind political masks

The chain of lies deadens our hope
Inferiors blamed, scapegoats accused
Provide answers the crowd demands

Unveil the facts, reality
Bureaucratic conspiracy
Governmental depravity
Political insanity

Heads roll as you ignorantly try to restore civil order

Furious mob retaliates
Rebellion
Protesting march, pillage the state
Lynch the regime for anarchy

The chain of lies deadens our hope
Inferiors blamed, scapegoats accused
Provide answers the crowd demands

Insanity
