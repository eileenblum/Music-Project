You live your life only following your blinkers

Coiled up in your precarious existence
Is this the way you picture life?
Enjoying this unending void

You still cling on to a non-existent past
Can't bear the "pain" that has been put on you

Can't cope with other people's affection for you?

Run away, try to hide
Masochistic masculinity
