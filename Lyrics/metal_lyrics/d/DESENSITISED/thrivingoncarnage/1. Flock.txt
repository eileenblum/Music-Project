Black cattle on fields of deep red
Extermination is what they're fed
Behaviour copied generations ahead
Infected mother's milk, the lambs are misbred

The virus of war infects the guiltless
The hostility passed on and on
The virus of war infects the guiltless
The hostility passed on and on

Barbwired fences, territorial instinct
Raised amidst the carcasses of the extinct
Transmitting neurons evolution unlinked
The thoughts of the shepherd are all they may think

Tumours of hatred disseminating
Susceptible to parental dullness
Raised in a world of shortsightedness
Tumours of hatred disseminating

Black cattle on fields of deep red
Extermination is what they're fed
Behaviour copied generations ahead
Infected mother's milk, the lambs are misbred

The virus of war infects the guiltless
The hostility passed on and on
The virus of war infects the guiltless
The hostility passed on and on
On and on
