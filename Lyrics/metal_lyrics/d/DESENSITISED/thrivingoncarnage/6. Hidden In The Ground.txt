Probing distant planet's soil
Elements should have been ignored
Holding minuscule life forms
Transfer hell's souvenirs

Taken the seeds of chaos from outer space and now humankind disintegrates
We overrate our supremacy for which we pay the price of ignorance
Claiming the universe was a mistake it seems aliens delete our race
Naivety has taken its toll again yet this time we cannot undo

Microscopic creatures slay mankind
Cadavers are all they leave behind
Lethal germs are what we have found
Carried light years hidden in the ground

We overrate our supremacy for which we pay the price of ignorance
Naivety has taken its toll again yet this time we cannot undo

Quest for life has brought doom
Man gone down, race wiped out

Taken the seeds of chaos from outer space and now humankind disintegrates
We overrate our supremacy for which we pay the price of ignorance
Claiming the universe was a mistake it seems aliens delete our race
