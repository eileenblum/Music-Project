Burning dead
Burning fat

Old Mrs. Reeser spontaneously combusted
Silhouette of ash, Yellow fat-residue

Fat fuels fire

A cigarette set her ablaze
The molten fat erodes her flesh
Her greasy dress serves as a wick
She fuels her own oxidation

Spontaneous human combustion
Horror of flaming destruction
Chubby women turned to ash
Foul stinking and oily mash

Suffering you can't sustain
Yet no screams, no cries of pain
Toasted skin and blackened meat
Skeleton deformed by heat

Spontaneous human combustion
Horror of flaming destruction
Chubby women turned to ash
Foul stinking and oily mash

Fat fuels fire

Burning dead
Burning fat
