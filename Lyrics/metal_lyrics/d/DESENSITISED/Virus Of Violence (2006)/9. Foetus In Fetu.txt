Connected in the womb
Linked up with your siblings
But youâre not of the same kind
Malformed parasitic twin
Developed into a Successful parasite
Undesirable
Coexistence

Foetus in Fetu
Anencephalic
Acardiac twin
Malformed parasite
Destroy your host twin
Leech the blood flow
From your brother
Damage the womb
And your mother
Battle in the uterus
âTill only one survives
Churning, twisting, squirming
Youâll never have a life!
