And I shall give you the name,
For the disease of our time.
And you will know, that itâs right.
For it is the name of all you fear and loathe,
The source of all suffering and confusion
Religious Slaves
March and breed
Religious Slaves
Death prevails
Religious Slaves
March and breed
Religious Slaves
Death prevails
You speak with many tongues,
From the lungs of hell.
In thy name the march continues,
The endless persecution of the apostasy.
Religious Slaves
Religious Slaves
And I shall give you the name,
For the disease of our time.
And you will know, that itâs right.
For it is the name of all you fear and loathe,
The source of all suffering and confusion
