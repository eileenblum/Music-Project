Purge the filth, clear the patterns of monotonous existence
Annihilation of emotional corruption, your malicious oppression
Murder, rape and sickness
Daily facts, no longer shocking
Abolishment of all emotions
Banished from this world
Lost and wrapped in a realm of death, my entity lies in confusion
An age of insecurity, feasts upon my thoughts
Digging for answers, my introspective quest
Questioning morality, the essence of this society
Introspective exploration
Questioning the sense of life
Your malicious oppression
Tightening the chains of rebellion
Now the time has come to let go of my frustations
Insanity has set in, feel the wrath of intense hatred
For I'm the seed of impiety, I control your destiny
To purge the filth, the essence of my life
