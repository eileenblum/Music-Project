Reminiscence
Just a vague notion to you
Things that made you smile
Are no longer there
This maddening ignorance
Is your only knowledge
Hunted down
Dogmatic views
Instilled in you
Now thatâs your truth
Subordinate
To a ruthless regime
Beliefs are wiped out
Donât think for yourself
They want your soul
Theyâll take your soul
Hunted down
Dogmatic views
Instilled in you
Now thatâs your truth
Subordinate
To a ruthless regime
Beliefs are wiped out
Donât think for yourself
This maddening ignorance
Is your only knowledge
