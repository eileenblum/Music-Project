Rape, execution
Plunder and hate
Fighting for independence
But itâs too late
Callous disregard
Of human life
Only resulting
In chaos and strife
Died a martyr
Died a hero
Died a victim
Died a coward
Youâre a hero in your own mind
To the rest of the world youâre only blind
This suicidal reign of mankind
Is the only thing that occupies your mind
Gratefully use
Your animosity
To justify
Your evil deeds
All values
Disintegrate
Only spread death
Only spread hate
Mass graves, genocide
Atrocities
Total domination
Brutalities
You would rather die
Than we want to live
Just fuel the fire
You cannot forgive
Died a martyr
Died a hero
Died a victim
Died a coward
