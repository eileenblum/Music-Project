The blackest cloudy night
A moonless eerie sight
The clapper's tolling four
Drowned out by a deafening roar
They left the earth for dead
Decked out in darkest red
Mankind now gone astray
Evolution swept away
Burning, raping, plundering
A war against man
Killing, charging, slaughtering
Restarting Darwin
