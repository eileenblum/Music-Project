Tied by invisible chains
Complete paralysis
Delusions of demons
Only existing in your mind
No one there to rid you
Of these dreadful feelings
Illusory power
An unimaginable force
All realityâs gone
Fiendish encounters
A nonexisting force
It seems all so real
Try to silence the
Voices of all
Your inner demons
Caught in the grip of fear
Tied by invisible chains
Complete paralysis
Delusions of demons
Only existing in your mind
No one there to rid you
Of these dreadful feelings
Illusory power
An unimaginable force
All realityâs gone
Fiendish encounters
A nonexisting force
It seems all so real
