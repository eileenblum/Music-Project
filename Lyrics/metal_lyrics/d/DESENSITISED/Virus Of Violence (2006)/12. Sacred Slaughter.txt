Battles over seas of sand
Struggling on for years on end
Two religions cleave the land
Two gods claim enlightenment

Rockets filled with lethal gas
Laser-guided towards the mass
Fuck resolving the impasse
Negotiations up the ass

Slaves of god

Countless victims every day
Churches, chapels in decay
Holy warfare, still they pray
No ceasefire, bombs away!

Bloody corpses ripped to shreds
Mass graves full of severed heads
Distributing blessed breads
No one wonders, no regrets

Slaves of god

Slay for god
Sacred war

Desert combat
Splintered by faith
Murderous fumes
Predicament
Casualties
Divine conflict
Piles of dead flesh
Share bread and wine

Battles over seas of sand
Struggling on for years on end
Two religions cleave the land
Two gods claim enlightenment

Rockets filled with lethal gas
Laser-guided towards the mass
Fuck resolving the impasse
Negotiations up the ass
