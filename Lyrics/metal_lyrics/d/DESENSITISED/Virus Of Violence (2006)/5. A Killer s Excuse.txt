Subatomic chaos reigns the psyche of our kind
Cerebral diffusion spreads emotions through the mind
Mental randomness denies the concept of free will
Unpredictability, it justifies the kill
In the brain
Disorder
Compulsion
To murder
Probability, selection
Statistically, reaction
Uncontrollably, aggression
Indeterminably, eruption
All the murderers and rapists must be released
Casualties of their own evil deeds
No conscious choice, the brain rolls the dice
Slaves of the odds forced into vice
In the brain
Disorder
Compulsion
To murder
Uncontrollably, aggression
Indeterminably, eruption
