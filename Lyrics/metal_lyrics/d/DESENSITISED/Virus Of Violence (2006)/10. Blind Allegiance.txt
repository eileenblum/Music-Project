Controlling a nation
Holding people down
Yearning for
Never-ending power
Eradicate all moral principles
Leave your country in ruins
Betrayed your own kin
For a war you could never win
Your cruelty
Is rewarded with power
You didnât give a shit
When all your fellows died
As long as you had
Your masterâs pride
Controlling a nation
Holding people down
Yearning for
Neverending power
Reluctant to be a leader
Instead a blind follower
