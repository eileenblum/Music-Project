Strangled cries, total suffering
The pain of multiplying flesh
Waiting for your final ride
Your body turns into a mess
Cancer rips you into pieces
Cloning cells of your innards
The pain it feeds your wish to die
Your bodyâs being ripped apart
Tied down to your fucking bed
No peace, no strength, thereâs nothing left
Fighting it with all your muscles
The pain, it makes you want to rest
