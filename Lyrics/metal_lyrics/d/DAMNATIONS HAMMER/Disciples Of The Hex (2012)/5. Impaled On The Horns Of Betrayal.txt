Impaled on the Horns of Betrayal the bite of treachery
Solemn is the sword bearing hand and vengeful is the blade
Caught in the maelstrom agony unfurled a treacherous maze
These fields of darkness these orchards of pain the warrior is I
Impaled on the Horns of Betrayal bait the traps with flesh
Impaled on the Horns of Betrayal spill the blood from their veins

Maelstroms of hate whirlwinds of pain harvest their heads
The wrath of the usurpers blade a serenade of steel a sonata of death
These fields of darkness these orchards of pain the warrior is I
Impaled on the Horns of Betrayal bait the traps with flesh
Impaled on the Horns of Betrayal spill the blood from their veins

Maelstroms of hate whirlwinds of pain harvest their heads
A new kingdom rose from the ashes of contentment
I cross these fields of deception to harvest their heads
See your enemies driven before you
Impaled on the Horns of Betrayal the bite of treachery
Solemn is the sword bearing hand and vengeful is the blade
Impaled on the Horns of Betrayal bait the traps with flesh
Impaled on the Horns of Betrayal spill the blood from their veins
Maelstroms of hate whirlwinds of pain harvest their heads
