A Horned Violation flesh of living death
Alters of whores and chaos larvae of the spiritual void
Death within their dream I am the seer, I am the Spell
Mechanised biology a great machine of flesh no return to the image of man
Portrayal of the absolute passage to annihilation
Disciples of the Hex inversion of death
Disciples of the Hex mythos of the Spell
Flesh to this machine Disciples of the Hex

Sentinel macabre blades and sallow skin
Penetration vile this flesh and circuitry host to the alien womb
Disciples of the Hex inversion of death
Disciples of the Hex mythos of the Spell
Flesh to this machine Disciples of the Hex

I am the seer, I am the Spell
Suspended within this surreal configuration
Coils of serpentine machinery, translucent
flesh tinged with biometric circuitry
She watches through lifeless eyes, forever vigilant
In this crawling, chaotic birthing machine.
And we worship, scholars to this curse disciples to this Hex.
Mythos of the Spell a creation of this Hex
Intravenous toxic blood solidifies the flesh birth within the machine
Disciples of the Hex inversion of death
Disciples of the Hex mythos of the Spell
Flesh to this machine Disciples of the Hex
