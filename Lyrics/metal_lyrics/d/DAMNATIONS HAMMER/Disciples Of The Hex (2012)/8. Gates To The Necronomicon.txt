Gates to the Necronomicon Grimoire of the Ancient Ones
Haunter of the shadows haunter of the dark manuscript ageless epitome
Sigellium Dei Aemeth Enochian keys a terror of existence
Beyond space and time unseen planets deadly spheres
Sigellium Dei Aemeth Sigellium Dei Aemeth haunter of the dark
Gates to the Necronomicon Gates to the Necronomicon gates within the mind

Energy within the tome awaken those who've always been
Portal to the ancient rites madness at the mountains luring in
Sigellium Dei Aemeth Sigellium Dei Aemeth haunter of the dark
Gates to the Necronomicon Gates to the Necronomicon gates within the mind

Horror waits beyond the sky
Sumerian Text Enochian Keys unspeakable words rise of the Ancient Ones
That is not dead which can eternal lie and with strange aeons even death may die
Gates to the Necronomicon Gates to the Necronomicon gates within the mind
Hyborean Doom arise lurker on the threshold
Haunter of the dark terror hides beyond the sky horror waits beyond the sky
