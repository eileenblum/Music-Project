Could you have known this morning
As you stepped out of your bed
That this day was gonna to change you forever
That day after school
You stand there waiting for the bus
But this guy, he said "I'll give you a ride"

You knew the boy
Cause he was with you il class
And he seemed to be a cute guy

Could you guessed
Wath he wanted
Read his mind
It wasn't about helping you out

And now that he took
Your youth away
Your life as turn to black
And your dreams
Fade away
As you lay in the dark

And the next day
You're feeling all dirty inside
When is all this gonna end ?
The deepest way you could be hurt
Gets in your way, is in your life
And there are thousands of girls in your case

Well I know
This won't help you
What can I say
No mater what I do
It ain't enough
Freedom's gone
And it leaves you in hell
All by yourself

I'm so a shamed
To be a man
When I hear wath some do
But I know
This won't take off
The weight that is on you
