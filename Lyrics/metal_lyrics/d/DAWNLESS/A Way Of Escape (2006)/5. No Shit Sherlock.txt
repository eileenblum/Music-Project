Like a river that flows
Through the fields of time
You are watching your years
Passing by

Open your eyes

Just look around
Don't think of you only
Free your mind
There's sense to
All our lives

You've got all you need
But it's not enough
You say "life is unfair
It's a fight"

No shit Sherlock!!!

Try to think about who got naught
The more you have the more you want
Time shows wath's gonna last

Just look around
Don't think of you only
Free your mind
There's sense to
All our lives
