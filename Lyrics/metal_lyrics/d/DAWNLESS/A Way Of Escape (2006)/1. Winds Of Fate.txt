Shut down, you are laying
Among the corpses of
Your enemies and even
Some of your friends

You're spilling all over blood
Overthefield, over them
Leaving a part of you with them all

And as the winds of fate
Carry away
The souls of all those that died on this day
You see now that you did as you were told
But all you've heard has been a lie

Bang! bang!
Sing the machinguns
Over the plane to
Cover the agony screams
Of those that die

It Looks like a sea shore in a
Petrol spread
But these fishes
They had souls

And as the winds of fate
Carry away
The souls of all those that died on this day
You see now that you did as you were told
But all you've heard has been a lie

And now the winds of fate
Carry away
The souls of all those that died on this day
