I saw her shadow
Feading behind the trees
Was it real ? I wonder woh she is
My legs seem to be short
Should I run after her ?
I know I can 't but I'm still tryin'

She's gone! she wasn't real!
Just a vision made to lead me here

The darness is everywhere
And I can feel it all around me
Pease help!! I ask for help!!!
Where did I fall? Is it hell?

For me the raoad is close
Trapped in a wicked game
I kneel down crying oh where did I fail?
From the ground I hear a voice in the Night

You are mine and now cursed be the light

The darkness left me right here
The day is bright and it's warm again
The dark can't take my heart
Ans now alone I remain.
