I've been walking on the same path
Not asking anyone else
Where it leads, but do I care

Cause I haven't looked around
Trying to find other ways
To live, to find who I truly am down here

Turning away from myself
Trying to hide who I am
To hide my regrets
So I cry
Cause I know I can't escape
I'll always know wath I 've done
No matter how deep I hide

So I'm sitting all alone
With a bottle of Whisky
My friend
My only true friend now

Knocked out laying on the ground
With nothing else than misery
It's wrong
I know I've gotta do something

Turning away from myself
Trying to hide who I am
To hide my regrets
So I cry
Cause I know I can't escape
I'll always know wath I 've done
No matter how deep I hide
