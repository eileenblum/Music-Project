Needless thoughts
That grow in our minds
About all that don't fit the mould
The mould thrown in our eyes
Cause we might
Be the beast ones to blame any
Of the unluky ones
Any of thos that ain't made the same way

There's no reason to cry
For those that we hurt
Gotta think twice
Before we say anything bad

Now listen
Death will come and we'll regret
Half of the things that we have done
Half of the things that we will have done

There's no reason to cry
For those that we hurt
Gotta think twice
Before we say anything bad
