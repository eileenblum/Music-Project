As if locked on disasters
Every channel's showing the cam crap
Why do they always fill up theses few
minutes
With negative news like
People dying in their misery
Throughout the world

Showe us laughter and beauty
Give us a break
All this is real, Hell! We know that
Show misery but don't forget
It's not the only thing the world is made of

Show us this world

I know money is the reason
For many it's the only god
But don't you think
That stuffing our heads will
Make them all blow up

Showe us laughter and beauty
Give us a break
All this is real, Hell! We know that
Show misery but don't forget
It's not the only thing the world is made of

Don't make us blind

You're free to show anything you want
But you're free as well to make it better
