Shaking by herself
crying for the pain of her
wounds
Fear is all she's known for
so long

Always lonely
Always down
Stuck in that shit
Blind and scared
Scream out loud
Pain, Misery
Make it known
All around
And free you from this hell

The beatings are not all
she is ashamed and alone
Dreams are all gone but lies
are real

Always lonely
Always down
Stuck in that shit
Blind and scared
Scream out loud
Pain, Misery
Make it known
All around
And free you from this hell

Why should fuckers like you deserve to have a life
You don't have a conscience or a heart
You are so low
Shame of men
But you'll burn in hell

Gather your stuff, fly away
Yeah fly away
