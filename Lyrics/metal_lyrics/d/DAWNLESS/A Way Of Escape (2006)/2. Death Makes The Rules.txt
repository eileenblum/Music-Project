Tell all your friends
And your family
That you've loved them all your life
Cause here it ends
Cry not
you know
We'll all end up the same way
It is our fate

Out of your sight
Stnds shape
Out of our world out of time
Setting all of us
At the same level
Who'll be next
Is it you, me
Or anybody else
Be aware

I exist for you to die
Gorgeous, ugly
No difference when it's time
You will come

Out of your sight
Stnds shape
Out of our world out of time
Setting all of us
At the same level
Who'll be next
Is it you, me
Or anybody else
Be aware

Out of your sight
Stnds shape
Out of our world out of time
Setting all of us
At the same level
