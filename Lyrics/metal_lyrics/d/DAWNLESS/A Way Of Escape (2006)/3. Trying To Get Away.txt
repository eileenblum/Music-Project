Working my ass off every day
I keep running around
But I never know wehere
I feel pasted to the ground
AndI, I can't fly away

Bound to rules made by liars
That try to make us swallow
The shit that they serve us
On plates made out of gold

They buy us so that we crawl
So that we do their will
So that we do their will

Don't wanna be a clown
Moved around
I'll try to get away
No matter if I die
I'll still try
Freedom
Is what I'll take away

Down on our knees looking up
At a paper god screwing us all
We forget wath really matters
What life is after all

We buy but we'll lose everything
Cause all things have an end
Death nowadays scares us all
Let's stop believing in ourselves

Don't wanna be a clown
Moved around
I'll try to get away
No matter if I die
I'll still try
Freedom
Is what I'll take away

Down below laughing out loud
He pulls the strings of evil and we obey
So listen to me there will be no chance
Of finding peace if we don't turn away
Turn away...

Don't wanna be a clown
Moved around
I'll try to get away
No matter if I die
I'll still try
Freedom
Is what I'll take away
