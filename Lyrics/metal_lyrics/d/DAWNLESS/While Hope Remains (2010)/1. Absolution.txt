Playing with vengeance as with fire
Fire that burns ou hands
Using our hate as a fuel
But we can't control where it might spread

No clear sight
You wander lost, naked and blind
Under a sky that sees all

Now see what you have done
Your sins will haunt you till the end of time
Sit down with us now
And hear what we've all done
Don't fear
Your sin's will be gone forever
Forever

May they be good or bad
All got the power to win upon their sins

Now see what you have done
Your sins will haunt you till the end of time
Sit down with us now
And hear what we've all done
Don't fear
Your sin's will be gone forever
Forever

Just say sorry!

Stand up for your life and
Fight for what you choose
Stop asking if you right
What have you got to lose?

There's no hiding
No clear sight
Head low you wander lost
Naked and blind
Torn, stuck under a sky that sees all

May they be good or bad
All got the power to win upon their sins

Now see what you have done
Your sins will haunt you till the end of time
Sit down with us now
And hear what we've all done
Don't fear
Your sin's will be gone forever
Forever
