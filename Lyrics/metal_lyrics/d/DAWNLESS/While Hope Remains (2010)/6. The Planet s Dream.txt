The planetâs dream

Stuck deep in my mind
Hidden from you all
Thereâre the
things that make me act the way I do

Piled up over the years
Most ainât no
choices
Itâs all Iâve been taught to make sure I fit too
Just to make sure I
fit the planetâs dream

Youâre dreaming your life 
As you stick to the
rules
Youâre drowning in the flood of their lies  
Youâve been fashionned by
their eyes
Trying to obey all theses liars
Even in mind you hear
laughters
Oh! Get rid of them!

Canât love myself
Canât even see hope
I
just keep on beating my own guts
I do!

Canât swallow my mistakes
Have to
bring them up
Just to make me...  oh make me feel weak

Youâre dreaming your
life 
As you stick to the rules
Youâre drowning in the flood of their lies 

Youâve been fashionned by their eyes
Trying to obey all theses liars
Even
in mind you hear laughters

Tell me
Canât this all be wrong?
What then is
true?
I trusted this shit my entire life
Bonds that were tied long
Are hard
to cut loose
Oh! I wanna be myself again

Wake the life sleeping in your
heart
Bring back to light your deepest wishes
Fear no darkness
Dare wander
off the beaten track
Oh!

Youâre dreaming your life 
As you stick to the
rules
Youâre drowning in the flood of their lies  
Youâve been fashionned by
their eyes
Trying to obey all theses liars
Even in mind you hear
laughters
Oh! Get rid of them!
