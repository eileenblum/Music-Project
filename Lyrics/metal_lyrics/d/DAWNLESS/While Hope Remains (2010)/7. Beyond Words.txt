You say you want an answer
But my thoughts are fading away
I see that you care
Well you know it's a mess in my head

Didn't mean to make you cry
I know you don't understand

I'm sorry I brought this on you

I fear that you dare not
Come to me when I drown in despair

Dreaming of your face
I feel no more pain
Screaming out your name
I know! Am I calling in vain

So come along and you will see...
I'm not all messed up
I'll show you there's some good in me...
And it's growing up
I don't know why I should be...
Left alone because I can't explain what I feel

No! I can't give you no answer
Yet I'll try to act in a way
That makes you see that I care
Hoping to make you smile for a change

Dreaming of your face
I feel no more pain
Screaming out your name
I know! Am I calling in vain
