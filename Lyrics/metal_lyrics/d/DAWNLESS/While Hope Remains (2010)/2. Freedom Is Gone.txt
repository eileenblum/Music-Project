Oh god help us, we falter
Father, doubtshave invaded our heads

We laugh and praise our own straights
Trying to rule the world in your stead
Are we lost?

Poor life suckers
Addicted to money and to fame
You got it all

Freedom we lack
Riding alone if we dare
What then we tell the night
What darkest dreams we don't share

Hell Facing bastards
Rising up from eating all the bread of the earth


Wicked liars
Feeding on the mysery off all
You got naught

Freedom we lack
Riding alone if we dare
What then we tell the night
What darkest dreams we don't share

Our time is up

We're goin' down

We're goin' straight down to hell
And some head first
A smile on their face

Freedom we lack
Riding alone if we dare
What then we tell the night
What darkest dreams we don't share
