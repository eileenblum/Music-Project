We suffer from the choice that
That we have made
Now if we lie, we don't die
But it dosent do anyone anygood

Stop!
Gotta stop looking for truth
If none of us can hold is lies
Tell me what we're heading to

Don't be ashamed
Everyone lies
We're all the same
But realize
Lies
Never brought us anywere

No one to blame
Everyone lies
We're all the same
What if I lie?
Lie
Then nothing holds you here anymore
Anymore

Don't deny it's a lie
I know it's to preserve your pride
But one day you'll say 'I'm sorry''
HEY!!
You can't take back the words you said

Blind!
Are we that blind not to see
Hiding the truth leaves us alone
Scared that someone may find out

Don't be ashamed
Everyone lies
We're all the same
But realize
Lies
Never brought us anywere

No one to blame
Everyone lies
We're all the same
What if I lie?
Lie
Then nothing holds you here anymore
Anymore

Feeling lonely
No one around know the truth
You don't wanna share
You fool !!
Shit kept Inside will make you rot

It's time to change and turn around
Don't feel stupid
There's no need to hide anymore

Don't be ashamed
Everyone lies
We're all the same
But realize
Lies
Never brought us anywere

No one to blame
Everyone lies
We're all the same
What if I lie?
Lie
Then nothing holds you here anymore
Anymore
