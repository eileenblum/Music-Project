Alone I sit at the edge of my life
At night I fly towards my destiny in the dark
I am one with the stars, one with cosmos
The power that gave me my chance to breed
My pain inside tells me
I cannot go on here
I have to kiss the demons that welcomes me

I have no guilt, I have no fear
Darkness calls my name, I gather strength

My shadow fades and I feel weaker
My eyes are closed. I see the utter dark
It fills my soul with power. My shadow arise
I fall into it and walk in the shade of stars

The stars!

I have no guilt, I have no fear
Darkness calls my name, I gather strength

I am the left mankind. I represent wisdom
I am superior. I hold your strings and rule your life

It's mine

I became the one I always wanted to be
I felt cosmos calling and the lords gave me my shadow

I have to kiss the demons that welcomes my arrival

I have no guilt, I have no fear
Darkness calls my name, I gather strength

Power
Evil
Darkness
