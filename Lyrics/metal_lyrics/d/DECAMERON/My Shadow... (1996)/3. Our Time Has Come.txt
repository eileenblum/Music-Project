Right hand illusion
-Insanity
What will they become
What will they be
An empire built upon lies
Following their father with worthless cries

Left hand reality what was shall be
Mighty are we, who rules with obscurity

No leaders shall be found
Just inspiration
Praise the lords of darkness, and hail this evil creation

We have the power
We have the knowledge
We have the right
To be ourselves

Rege Sathanas!
Ave Sathanas!
