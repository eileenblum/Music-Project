Here I'm lying. Here I'm waiting
In solitude, in grief
Dreaming dreams, that man never dreamt before
A voyage in mind. A voyage in soul

Hearing whispers. Feeling eyes
Making movement. I'm not here alone

A touch of fire, dreaming desire
A virgin's touch, diabolic lust

Hearing whispers. Feeling eyes
Making movement. I'm not here alone

My desire became power
My lust became aggression
I am now forever reborn
I am now immortal

I am now forever reborn
I am now forever immortal

I am now forever reborn
I am now immortal

Through the dark of futures past the
magican longs to see
One shouts out between two worlds
Fire, walk with me

Painful pleasure, cursed existence
I am creation, I am it all

My desire became power
My lust became aggression
I am now forever reborn
I am now immortal
