On wings of sorrow, I travel far
Beyond life's gate, into the realm of hate
Tunes of death, caresses my mind
Armageddon's time, is to be found.

I am the chosen one, set me free
Carpe Nocem, Carpe Nocem

In my veins, blackened reigns
Not to be chained, by the claws of time
I have no fear, my salvation is near
Nightfall again spread my wings

I am the chosen one, set me free
Carpe Nocem, Carpe Nocem

Tortured souls, thousands in time
I feed on pain, vengeance is mine

Hidden in time by fear, only to grow strong
Empire of strength is near, Oh! You all were so wrong

Crush the lambs, destroy their temple of joy
Revenge for the burnt and tortured
Full moon possession

Take what's mine, walk with me, my will is done
Carpe Nocem, Carpe Nocem
