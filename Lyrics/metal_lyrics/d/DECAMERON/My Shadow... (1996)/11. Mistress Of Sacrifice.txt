My lord is by me, I do not fear
What can Christ do to me...
I'm one with all evil and dark
I'm one with the truth I must see through in you

Waiting for glory, nothing at my side
Lusting for power, to strengthen my pride
Tranquility reigns, walking on broken glass
Feeling nothing, the only thing gripping is my misery

Unsatisfied, life of emptiness
Nothing to gain, I never asked to be born
Inhuman, is what I will be as soon as I have drained myself of blood

I am dead my journey begins
I'm not afraid, darkness will be at my side
Questions about death, to be answered
Who did I live for and where is the realm?

Throne of stone, eyes of lust,
Blood of stone
The mistress of sacrifice

I'm not following the traces of blood
I'm not afraid darkness is by my side
Forever hidden from the sun
The treasures shall be guarded by a king

Come to me, my dear
Take my love, don't fear
Immortal I am, The mistress of sacrifice

She is the gate between life and death
She is the power of life
'cause when you die
She'll give you life here after

She's got eyes like the starfilled sky
(she said) come to me I'll give you immortality
Her voice caressed me like the wind in the trees
She is mine, I am hers to give
I am now sitting at her side
as a king I'm guarding the fucking treasures (of life)
My body dies and my mind gazes
My throne is beside the mistress of sacrifice

Come to me, my dear
Take my love, don't fear
Immortal I am, The mistress of sacrifice

She is the gate between life and death
She is the power of life
