Searching the meaning of life
Pages of sanity unfolds
This is a nice hell, paradise
Open up for darkness, and bleed

Fallen angels, come for me
My body is dying, I'm no longer me
"Blasphemy"

Come forth and open the gate, as we're burning the symbol of Christ
And forever we'll be Satanized

Demons now come for me
My body is dead, I'm no longer me

Behold my power, confess
Legions of hate will conquer
All will follow my spell
I guide people from Christ

Satanized I was born
Satanized I will be
