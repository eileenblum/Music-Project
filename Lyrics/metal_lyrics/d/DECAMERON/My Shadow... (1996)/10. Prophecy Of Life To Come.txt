I can't pretend I'm blind
I look deep into myself
To find a meaning of it all
Why do we have to live at all
There are lies in every meaning
At birth, sold to higher realms
No chance to choose your way
You must try to follow light
But human desires wants your life

Am I alive or am I dead or do I have a fate?
I must learn the facts of life
I must learn to hate

I look deep into myself
No answers, my mind goes blank
Loneliness in mourning
I think my life has ceased
But why am I still feeling, why am I still in pain?
Prophecy of life to come
This must be my life. Why ?

Eternal pain controls my time
Infected veins what is my crime
Confusion, is this love or hate
Illusions, I must tear down what I create

Come on, come on

Come on
Come with me, come with me, come with me, come with me

Am I alive or am I dead or do I have a fate?
I must learn the facts of life
I must learn to hate
