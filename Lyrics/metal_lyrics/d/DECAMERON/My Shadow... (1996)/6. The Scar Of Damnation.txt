Travelling through unknown land
I'm carrying the seven deadly sins in my hand
Guided by the eyes of infinity
My fury carries me on
Love is lost, joy is lost
I can feel the hate of hells wrath
Father of darkness shows me my way
Reaching certain places, but i cannot stay

I move like a shadow, I dance with the dead

My troops have been withdrawn, I walk alone
I have no armour, embraced by mist
No fear has ever crossed my mind
Follow the wind, It whispers...
Words that cannot be spoken
There can be only one, one of a kind
I walk for those left behind

I move like a shadow, I dance with the dead.

Hand in hand with fire, destined to win
I wear the mark, the scar of damnation
The scar of damnation

The air breathes eternal life, it grabs my limbs
I'm lifted up in a void of tranquillity
A stream of golden darkness fills my veins

I wear the mark, the scar of damnation

... I walk no more
