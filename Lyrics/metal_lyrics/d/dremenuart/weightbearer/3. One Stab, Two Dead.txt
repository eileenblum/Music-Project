One edge to bleed me clean
The other to shed my skin

You used a key like a knife
I built a wall out of an aimless drive
I'd rather set Paris alight
Than settle for the Arch of Triumph of Las Vegas

We are the means to a dead end

Whenever you need an ear
Just remember I wash my hands in your tears

Sink in me!
Sink in my bleeding flood of indifference

I said âyou will touch the sky as long as you are on your tiptoesâ
But on your knees, do you even get to see the clouds?

You brought this to yourself

An unfathomable emptiness is an understatement:
I hope you give your heart to someone like you

Whenever you need an ear
Just remember I wash my hands in your tears

We are the means to a dead end
You and me, the means to a dead end
