Always there to share your dreams but,
Where were you to borrow my nightmares?
I opened my eyes pouring salt
My fiends outnumbered my friends by one

Witness of the fire
Your name is across the deepest wound
You didn't drop the lighter
But you left me there to fucking burn

You are always three songs fucking late
Enjoy your own!

I thought as we smiled through empty glasses
We were together swallowing our curses
Let's toast for the beer 'cause I am drunk off deception

You left me there to fucking burn

As I drowned alone with a crowded stone
I found my true people in Alaska

Silence is all you will be remembered for
Still you roam in the bottom
Upon death I'll make sure life will blossom

I am looking forward with a heart as big as a graveyard
