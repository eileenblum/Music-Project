Starving just to stay hungry
Dying just to feel alive
Only the pursuit of our dreams
Will keep us awake at night

No stars can be seen from down here
Yet the night never gleamed so sincere

There is always music
Bearing the weight with us
In the jaws of tragedy
We are able to dream at night

This bloodstained paper, a bandage for the soul
These deafening screams, a gag for our own demons

We are bound to the underground
If we ever go up it will be to shut the top down

Upon the neck of Venus we place the head of Samothrace
This is the slaughter of silence

I'd sooner die fighting the stream
Than live swallowed in the sea

Starving to stay hungry
Dying just to feel alive
