Cold tacit words quenched the (Sept)embers
The fall of your days, the winter of mine
I rushed to my fears knowing I could only be late
And you welcomed me to your reclining deathbed

Each smile was putting off a tear

You aren't gone but you have to
I'd mourn your absence yet I die with your departure
The time I didn't find (to be by your side)
Now I have it to say goodbye

Bask in the shade of the values you sowed
Thank you for raising me towards a worthy sun

You aren't gone but you have to
I'd mourn your absence yet I die with your departure
The time I didn't find (to be by your side)
Now I have it to say goodbye

Good fucking bye

You will forever speak through my voice
