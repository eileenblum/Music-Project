Tonight I walk alone
Across the border zone
While the wind is breaking on my eyes

The summer loses the way
In a cold embrace I lay
I've been waiting for a sign to rise

But slowly fades, but slowly fades away
Loose the grip, falling far, far from you

So mother pray for me
A soldier cannot see
Don't forget those fairytales

Someday, when I'm back
My arms around your neck
And you cradle me under your veils

Your wings of stone
Surrounding me with your being

Play dead
Resounds the silence in my heart
My proud
Obey to "not a step behind"
Play dead
And when I'm near to disappear
My proud
Not for the leader but to you

Loose the grip
Falling far, Luga's nights

Play dead, my proud
Resounds the silence in mt heart
Play dead, my proud
Obey to "not a step behind"
Play dead, my proud
And when I'm near to disappear
Play dead, my proud
Not for the leader but to you

Shine to me, I die.
