Pulled down, I'm freezing on the ground now
Tears bodies all around, to die
After, another vicious slaughter
Of this unbounded war, my dying land
Faster, the life is falling deeper
Compared to waiving flag
Raise up! My injury hands are moving
Into the mud and snow, the price
While "Radio Leningrad" is spreading on the air
By "call the roll"
You know, I'm scared to see your face
But I can't close my eyes

If you're praying for me
Destroy what's inside
Afraid to die is not my final will
Wherever you are
Deleting my name
Afraid to die is not my final will

1941, build our lives in a bell
1944, 900 days, ten millions dead
Crystal from the bell, find the rest in our flesh
Splinters of my heart, don't repent
Can't find regrets!

About the nights, about the snow
Nothing still remains
No more cries, not today
For those I can remind
Dedicate a smile to the ones on my side
Splinters of my heart, don't repent
My mother's eyes...
My mother's cries...
My Motherland

If you're praying for me
Destroy what's inside
Afraid to die is not my final will
Wherever you are
Deleting my name
To hide myself by your arms, Motherland

I can feel the breath of Leningrad... My Motherland
