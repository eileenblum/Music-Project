I'm walking back from hell
Buried my life again
Stand alone, the claws within
I forget my name

I'm walking back from hell
People cared away
Suffering is what I see
In the void I lay

Between myself and death
There is my Leningrad
Beats a sound
The speakers all around

Beat my heart, go on
Beat my heart, I know you're tired
Make me feel we're still alive
Beat my heart, go on, be my metronome
Beat my heart, I know you're tired
Make me feel we're still alive

I know I'd die
I know I'd die for Leningrad

Beside my words
There is a radio
Beats a sound,
The heart of Leningrad, for Leningrad

Beat my heart, go on, for Leningrad
Beat my heart, I know you're tired
Make me feel we're still alive
Beat my heart, go on, be my metronome
Beat my heart, I know you're tired
Make me feel we're still alive

900 days, 900 Nights
I know you're tired
I know.
