Midnight, frozen is the lake, frozen is the path, and now the time is coming, I know I have to go away.
Brave or fool, into this night I'll be aware!
Blinded by the snow, grinded by the flow, inside the cry of "Buran" and now begin to move, straight to the siege of my land.
My hand is gonna trembling to turn its frozen key, breaking on the wheels,
Lagoda lets me in, and now the time is coming, and now I have to go away.

The dear to survive is killing me on... Snow-blind.
The dear to survive is killing me on... But now is forever...

Lonely in this cab, suffering, my friend, the waiting of the children,
they're crying by the starve, speed I will drive my heart on.
Behind they're going forward and never turning back,
they follow my direction and never break the line, await my land, we're coming.
We crossed the oblivion gates for you, we cross the gates to you!

The dear to survive is killing me on... Snow-blind.
The dear to survive is killing me on... But now is forever...

Brave or fool, into this night I'll be aware!
Snow-blind, I'll reach out my hands to you, you, child, just a cloth I laid.
Snow-blind, I'll reach out my hands to you, remind your first son,
in my grave I will need that cloth for me.
