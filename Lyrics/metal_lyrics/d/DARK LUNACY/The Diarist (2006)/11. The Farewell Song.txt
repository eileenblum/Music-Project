Last chapter of the siege
Slowly darkness falls
Rumours of steps that come to me

My end is near, just for a while I'll resist, and throwing out this sheet, the last ruins of time.
Behind my back he'll take the book from my hand,
turn off the light's of my eyes and keep my memories, keep it closer, screaming...
My dumb resistance, my dumb resistance, die once again, 'cause I don't care,
my dumb resistance, die once again, 'cause I don't care.
No more to say, Pulkovo stands as I lay, the wheels that cross the ice,
the ghost boatmen of time. I wish I die, to sleep again with my child.

Oh, want you take me there, on white memory sleigh, laying closer, screaming...
My dumb resistance, my dumb resistance, die once again, 'cause I don't care,
My dumb resistance, my dumb resistance, die once again, 'cause I don't care...
When I'll can't see by blindfold, who will shoot to my lost heart
Blank cartridge strikes unaware to let you hide...
Last chapter of the siege
Slowly darkness falls
Rumours of the steps... take me far.

NO ONE FORGET... NOTHING... FORGOTTEN...
