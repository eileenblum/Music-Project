"The snow forgotten now begins to fall on my pain
How many children found the eternal rest
Oh, want you take them in your whitest dream
And watching on, on deliverance from agony
Now I'm falling down with you"

Silence, into the misery of my December
I realize how much you can hurt me, silence
Anguish, between to live and die I remember
I feel the memory of a prayer, "Peter" goes on

"Now disappear, save me from my decay
I wish for time to catch my fall
And spread my wings forever"

Deadly, into the cradle of Russian poetry
How many poems of bloody writings
"Straight along this street, I can't find relief"

Mortal, into the garden of barbed wire
How many flowers will see summer?
"Straight along this street, looking for relief"
"Peter" goes on

Peter be the great
For your son, for me
Peter buried alive
In this world, oppressive time

I an feel your heart
I can feel you're near, now
How many tears fall in the "frozen"
Ride, over, once, over
Ride my knight of bronze

"Now disappear, save me from my decay
I wish for time to catch my fall
And spread my wings forever"

Ride my knight of bronze
