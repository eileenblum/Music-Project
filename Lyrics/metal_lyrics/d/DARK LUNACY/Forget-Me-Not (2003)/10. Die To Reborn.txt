Black sky line 
Rising fear
From my last day
Lost control 
Immortal 
Pain and tears
Like my last dream
Blind control

Dark season
Burning from
The hills of willow
Death control 
My disgrace
Timeless ruling, 
While the lives are passing
Eras entrapped me, in this time
Now I am torn with remorse
I live on, you die
All I need , is Die To Reborn
Endless, is mine
Raving, of mind
Slowly, I burn ... burn
Writings ... on the grave
Read my last name, see no date
Look behind me
Dead
Take my last name, write my date

Want to live
I live on, you die
I'm afraid to blowing over
I live on, you die
All I need, is Die To Reborn.
