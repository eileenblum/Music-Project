Let the night fall again
''Couse I need it's blackened 
Warmth solitude at my door ...
I'll receive
If you're loosing me 
Suffering will ends
I can feel my chains ... calling me

I have to go back in flames

Let my sin meet the pain
Now I claim the darkness truth
When the end's calling me ...
I'll be free 
Don't you look at me
My oblivion gates
They are barred behind ...
Endless stairs
Can't turning, my father's calling
Me back my bent head
Stop crying your tears are
Creasing your light forgive me
I wont take you down
Love entrust it's grief to last
Page of final chapter
Here, my burial shoot is gonna
Yearning the cry of life ...
Let my fall safe your soul,
My vault for your life
Let my scream ... spread,
Vanish to exist
Let my lies ... die,
My mask for you face

Don't forget ... please
"Forget-Me-Not"

Love entrust it's grief to last
Page of final chapter
Hope can change no words
About the ink already fallen
Here, my burial shoot
Is gonna yearing
The cry of life ...
Sweet oblivion ... now I am back,
Sweet oblivion ... 
Where did I been ?
Sad oblivion ...
Nothing is like before

You can gave me your gift,
Toy took me so high ... lonely
I ... I've seen a new things,
Unspoken ... demand
She, she gave me her gift,
She took me so high ... living
God, I can take no more, 
Tell here ... I cry.
