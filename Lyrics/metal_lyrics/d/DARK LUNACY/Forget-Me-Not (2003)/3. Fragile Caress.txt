The sky is leaving grey tears
And endless cries are falling
So let themeselves in dying

And so this useless feather
Blank mother of useless poetry
Leaded by this old and tired heart
Dividing my pain, from the 
Hopes of soul

And now unscreamed voice
Behind the walls of silence
Decay to my surrender
Lost in my days
Into my eyes ... 
Rain deceiving myself
Going back to
That scene of autumn ...
Fragile Caress
Scenes of an autumn ... 
Let her come back again

But while this empty feather
Goes on to write on mourning
The time is gonna turning
Lost in my days
Into my eyes ... leaves
Deceiving myself
Flying back to
That scene of autumn ...
Fragile Caress
Scenes of autumn ...
Let her come back again

From my calm
I can hear your call ... why,
So dull his voice by the leaves
You will feel my touch ...
A Fragile Caress

Inside me the autumn falls
The patient ground now
Receives and now I wish to die
With you ...

The ground, the tears
The sheet, the tale ...
Raining to me, the rain ...
Nothing, nothing
Flying she has gone, now, 
Forever ...
Now I see the fall around
The rain is falling from above
Patient ground now receives
It doesen't wet my silent life
Now I want to die with you
It finally wets my silent death
Now I want to die with you

Turn back to
That scene of autumn ...
Fragile Caress
Scenes of autumn ...
Let her come back again
Scenes of an autumn.
