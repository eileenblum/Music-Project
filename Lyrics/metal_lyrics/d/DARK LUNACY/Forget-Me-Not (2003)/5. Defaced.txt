Shadows hiding 
An ancient score is shining
Strings lead
Dancers 
Someone's hiding
Defaced behind the mirror

Life, entrapped my desires forever
Time forsaken' my days for ...
Eternity 
Lonely, lonely ...

Grace, entrapping my vision,
I see her
Notes, are flooding my prison,
What's going' on
Dance my princess
Up to relieve, my restless suffer
Give me a timeless blazing beauty
Up to relieve my vanish waiting
I'm gonna brake the mirror
Shades fall in time ...

Dance my princess
I know the time is breaking over
I don't belong to your tomorrow
I know you'll run away in sorrow
I'm gonna breake the mirror
I fall in time ...

Watch me, feel my defaced love
Please, don't you go ...
How can I be too scared,
If I can't see you
Don't be afraid, I don't ... mother!
... lie ...

Mother of all the children
Closer, grasp me, lead me ...
Until your final dance is over ...
