Silence is gone
Someone's moving in white
Blanket steps
Shivering, little hands in the cold
No refuge
Child never lulled
With a dead look unjustified fate
No embrace and no love
In your home
No lullabies ... lullabies
There's nobody
Who sees her suffering
Buy her matches ... 
It's all that she can
Through this darkness ...
Cold will take it all
She slowly goes

From above I am looking
Her restless heart
Can't protect her ... 
From this evil vice
I'm a spirit ... humble reflex
That you can't see ...
My little Fiamm
Snow is killing me ...
Dreams won't come true,
Would you buy my matches,
Buy my safety for a smile
Fiamm, hold on,
I know you're tired ...
But into this shade, a feeble light
Fiamm, I'm here, 
Being lonely hurts
So you close your eyes
You'll never feel ... cold

Snow is killing me ...
Shades in my dreams,
Would you disappear and
Take my pain faraway
Fiamm, hold on,
I know you're tired ...
But into this shade, a feeble light
Fiamm, I'm here,
Being lonely hurts
So you close your eyes
You'll never feel ... cold
Sleep little Fiamm
I am standing, until your awake
To be cared for, step to the light
We live in God
For any burning flame
There's a dying Fiamm
Any time she dies
A flame will burns.
