Drunk the tears from
The darkest light
Ancient sigh of the vanish hopes
Drunk from wound 
Of a crying bowel
Smeared by bloody 
Torment's agony

Sneers my heart demised
Dreadful mistakes
Cloak of untruth embraced me
Silent refuge of a fragile love
Pouring prayer up to be
Silent omen, an afraid image

Sneers my heart demised
Dreadful mistakes 
They're gonna take me down
Living horror of my face
A reflection, deep into my lust
Slowly turning, friendly look
My remorse will be washed away

Sneers my heart demised
Dreadful mistake
They're gonna take me down
I keep on to go down !

The black wind arrives,
My pathway is dust
The pathway has gone,
How deep is the night
Shades take care of me
Evil is the one, who rules his evil
Pure is the one, who tell his soul
Alive is the one, 
Who doesn't blame
No colours, no poetry, can tell
Evil is the one, who rules his evil
Pure is the one, who tell his soul
Just because, I longed to be,
I'm not ...
