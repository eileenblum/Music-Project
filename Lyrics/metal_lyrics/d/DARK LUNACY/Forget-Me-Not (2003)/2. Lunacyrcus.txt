Far from ... nowhere
A dream is coming closer
Taken by the clouds
That's me ...
Give me your attention
And listen to my words
Your souls for magic
That's what I'm looking for
So don't be afraid
To receive what's going on
Circus, awning ... are going to
Fall over
Don't you stand a side from
The weight on your shoulders

Don't want ...
Money the only thing
I'm searching is something
You don't need
Give me ...
What you have forgotten
What's beating inside your chest
It's time for your redemption,
So don't you dwell upon
It's time to remember and see
Beyond my eyes
I feel, your mind ...
Is going to falling over
Don't you stand a side from
The chance of the darkness

Come in, lost souls
Down, into your lost dream
Down, to Lunacyrcus
Recall all your ghosts

Soul ...
It's me who will take, care of you
Souls ...
Stay here in my arms like a child
Lunacy killed me ...
Leaving me alive
But without my soul
I can not die!
Come in, lost souls
Down, into your lost dream
Come in, lost souls
Down, to Lunacyrcus
Recall all your ghosts ...
Lunacyrcus

In this eternal show
Of forgotten lives
Realised, to deceive myself
Lunacy, I can not die
I can not die.
