Missin' You
Wish for your Cold Embrace
The Shadow' S Takin' All My Days
The Blacklands' Cleaving All My Visions
Help Me To.... My End
Take Me 'Till... I'll Shine
Like A Rainbow
In This Nightfall
Like A Shadow
In My Dawn

A Smile For My Demon' S Cry
A Tear For My Demon' Sleep

I Sorround
Where Dreams Are Layin' Down
Wander. Over Cryin' Pathways
I Can Feel You Callin' My Name:

A Smile For My Demon' S Cry
A Tear For My Demon' Smile

Climbin'.... Down
Fallin'......... High
Burnin'........... Blind
Through My Longest Night ,
Of My Life, Of My Eyes

Shades On Me
Shine In Front Of You
I Can't See, I'm Scared, Of You
...I Take Care Of You

The Shadows' Takin' All My Days
The Shadows' Takin All My Days
The Blacklands Cleaving All My Visions
