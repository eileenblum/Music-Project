The Seasons Change Its Colours
It Draws To A Close
The Blaze Of Ancient Stories
Shine In His Eyes
The Warm's Taken By The Winter
Fallin' Asleep
His Deep Tale Before The Silence
Closing Eyes In Death

In Death
You Betray Me
In Death
In Dying Day

Easy Words In The Future-Promises
Blind Illusion Of Power-Decay
Beam On Time Lost, Forever
Prayer Regrets, Forever

Back To Time In Stalingrad
Back To Time Into The Frozen
Die Under The Snow
In Heart Of Ice
Lonely And Without God, Without A Name

I Kill To Serve One Banner
Honour Or Need
I Ripped The Time And Future
From Another Man
Follow Me In My Story
Follow Me In My Tail
Walk Beside At My Deep Words
Now Look... What I See

But Take,
Take My Hands
I'm Scared, In Dying Day.

Light On Me In Stalingrad
Light On Me Into The Frozen
Lights Under The Snow
In Heart Of Ice
Lonely And Without Gods, Without A Name
In Stalingrad
In Heart Of Ice
Lonely And Without Gods , Without The Fear

Follow Me, Follow Me Now
Follow Me , Follow Me Down

Light On Me In Stalingrad
Light On Me Into The Frozen
Lights Under The Snow
In Heart Of Ice
Lonly But With A God, Without The Fear

Don't Blame The Winter
The Light Is Real Inside
Frozen, Don't Blame The Frozen
The Guyldness Is Not The Cold,
In Stalingrad.
