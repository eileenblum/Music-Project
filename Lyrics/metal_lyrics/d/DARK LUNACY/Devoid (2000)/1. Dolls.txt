Dark Storm After The Light
It's Over My Broken Rage
It's Over
From My Vanish Life
Take Me, I Run To You
And Show Me Your Beauty Side
And Save Me
With Your Sacrifice

And Dance, Dance For My Soul
Dance For My Eyes
Deceive Me Again
Change, Change All My Thoughts
Kill Other Dreams
Rule All My Sense
And Take Me Home.

Dark Moon Before The Sun
And Prayers From Gothic Nights
Relive Me
After The Cry
Lead Me In Other Time
I Feel You A Part Of Me
Inside
From My Rising Dreams

And Fly, Fly On My Cold
Fly For My Life
Deceive Me Again
Change, Change Other Thoughts
Rule All My Days
Untill The End
Let The Curtain Fall

Rumours Move In The Past
When Safety Has Lost The Way
The Nightmare
It's Only Revenge
Magic Veils Are Flying On Me
And Their Eyes Embrace The Truth
They Tell Lies
But I Feel In My World

Dance, Dance Through The Mist
Dance For My Mind
I Don't Want The Light
Wax, Angels Of Wax
I Can't Live Nomore
I Can't Dream Nomore
Can You Dance For Me ?

I Trust In Your Blackened Soul
I'm Walking In Misty Garden
Your Name Is Madness
Your Children The Dolls

Wax, Angels Of Wax
I Can't Live Nomore
I Can't Dream Nomore
Without My Dolls

...Can You Dance For Me ?...
