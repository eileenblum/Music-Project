Frozen Eyes In A Day Of Winter
At The Gates Of Snowy Pathway
I Greet The Cold And (The) Ashen Sunrise
Wander In The Season Of The Past

Flying Back
The Lyric Of Storm
It's Growing Inside
"When The Angel Will Spread Her Black Wings
I Will Fly In Eternity With Her"

Crying Snow In A Day Of Winter
Tears Of Ice Fall Around My Throne
The Time Of Cold Has Brought The Silence
And My Soul Waits The Power To Come Back

Flying Proud
The Lyric Of Storm
It's Growing Inside
"When The Angel Will Spread Her Black Wings
I Will Fly In Eternity With Her"

You Grasp My Strong
Before My Death
I Have Only You
In My Great Surrender

And The Death Of Heart
And The Death Of Soul
My Desperation
In The Winter Find The Rest

December, December...

By My Eyes
Nothing Appears So Clear
Nothing Is Standing Still
I'm Leaving My Life ,I'm Waiting For December.
