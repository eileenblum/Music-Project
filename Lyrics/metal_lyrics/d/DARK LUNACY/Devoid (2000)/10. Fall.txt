Trough The Autumn, Fly The Echos Of Hidden Cries
Rests The Dreamer, Beside The Ruins Of A Crambeled Life
Walk In Silence, Amok The Shadows Embrace The Light
And My Spirit Hails The Tails Lost In Memory.

I Am Fall, You'll Never See Me

I Have Tried To Run So Faster
- Faster Like The Wind Of Autumn -
I Have Tired, To Understand The World
- And The Air Stroke The Yellow Leaf -
And I Need To Find The Answer
- The Leaf Of Autumn Waits To Fly -
But This World Is Different From Mine
- I Want To Fly Faraway From Here -

I Come From Here, You Never Seen Me
Don't Find Me In Light
Don't Call Me In Hopes

Voice From The Dust
Above The Time.

Comes The Sworn From Distant Stories
Screaming Birds Destroy The Skyline
Distant Sworn
Silent Tails
Screaming Crows
Breaking Soul, Soul.

Soul Escapes From You,

Shall I Return?

Over, Wind Is Blowing Colder
Falling , On My Endless Prayer
Over, Wind Will Take Me Higher
Tell Me, All My Timeless Answers
