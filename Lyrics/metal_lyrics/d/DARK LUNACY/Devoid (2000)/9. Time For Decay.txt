Look Into Yourself
Look Into Your Heart
Lights Escape
Escape In Other Time

But Now You Rule Your Destiny
The Time Is Eternal

You. Now, Only You
In The Peace Of Your Soul
You've To Decide
The Time, Time Waits Noone

Feel Your Heart
Before My Cry
Before The Time
The Time For Decay

Look Into Yourself
Look Into Your Heart
Feel Your Heart
Before My Cry
Before The Time
The Time For Decay
