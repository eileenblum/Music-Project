I Remember
Northern Side
Were The Frozen
Is The Keeper Of My Hopes

And In This Place Of
Sacred Peace
There Is No Words
To Tell About This World

Cold, Father Of My Blood
Redemption Of My Soul.

Vault Of Desperation

But The Story
Makes Me Fall
In Your False Light
Surrounded By Rainy Lies

In This Journey
I'm Looking For
Stroke Of Love
That I Lost Along The Time

Love, Reflection Of The Past
Sad Melodies Of You.

Vault Of Desperation
Dark Season's Singing From The Sea Of Inner Missing,
From Inside The Secret Story To The End Of Human Glory,
I Remember Your Frozen Tears,
I Remember My Northern Star.

Dark Season's Blowing From The Hills Of Weeping Willows,
By My Tears The River's Flowing To The Sea Of Dying Quiet,
I Remember Your Frozen Tears,
I Remember My Northern Star.

Our Spirit
Has Lived Free
But You Wanted
The Light Of Not Believe

You Are Rowing
Without Past
But I Can't, I Can Never Say Goodbye
Cold, Still Will Be My Friend
I'll See Your Frozen Tears.

Vault Of Desperation.

[Chorus.]

Nothing, All Around Me
Nothing, All Around Me

All Around Me, Just A Vision
Just A Vision, Slowly Kills Me

Slowly Kills Me, From Inside

All That I Can See
Lost In Memory
The River's Flowing In To The Sea
The River's Flowing In Dying Quiet

[Chorus.]

Wishing You
To Take My Cry
I Keep On Seeing
In Other Eyes

I Keep On Seeing
In The Heart Of Nothing
Where The Lies
Trapped Your Spirit

Rumours Of Darkness
From Northern Story
Taking The Painting
Of Distant Lovers

I Sing In The Winter
Because I Need You
I Sing In The Winter
In The Frozen Memories.

[Chorus]

Dark Sirens In My Eyes.
