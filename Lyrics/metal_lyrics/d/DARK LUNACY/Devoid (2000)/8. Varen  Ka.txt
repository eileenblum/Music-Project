My Life Decreases Slowly
Clouds Are Coming Fast
My Heart Will Burn My Last Flame
Weather's Turning Cold

From A Dull Day
To The Blank Of Mind
While The Sadness
Is Drinking My Blood

No Return
All Is Done
With Your Sacrifice

My Letters Gave You Thin Wings
Got No More To Say
The Evil Burnt They're Plumage
Got No Time To Fly

My Disappointment
Just A State Of Mind
My Sheets Of Paper Is Foundin'
With The Meaning Of What I Know Of What I Can
To Heal You From What' S Around
To Help you, Help You.
Now The End Weds The Silence
Now My Cry Meets My Varen'ka

Accordion Play For Our Deadly Love
Makar, Don't You Cry For This Bride
Who'll Ever Changes
Try To Run, Run To Mercy Without You

Roving Into My Way
Nothing Lead My Steeps
Roving Into My Loose
Nothing Watch My Tears

Left To Moskow
From Our Petergrad
When The Carriage
It Takes Away From All

I'm Poor
But So I Love
In This World To The Legion Of Evil Sun
I'm Calling God
Help Me, Help Me

Now The End Weds The Silence
Now My Cry Meet My Varen'ka

Accordion Play For Our Deadly Love
Macar, Don't You Cry For This Bride
Who'll Ever Changes
Try To Run, Run To Mercy Without You

Moskow's Far From Me

Trust In Hands Of God
To Forget The Past
Now I Can't See The Light
But I Still:.. Believe

That's The End Of This Legend
Writing Burns As A Light Of Candle
Blows The Wind From Siberia
Rays Of Sun Will Dries My Lachrymal
