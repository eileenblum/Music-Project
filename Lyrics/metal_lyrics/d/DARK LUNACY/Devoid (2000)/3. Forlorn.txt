Life,
Entrapping My Heart
Into The Obscurity
Life,
Enchanting My Eyes
Into The Grey Misery

Something Is Marching Straight To Myself
Still I Am Ruling My Castle Of Dust.

Awake,
Awake By My Dream
Everything Sleep. All Is Gone,
Await,
I Wait For Its Touch
Turning The Dust Into Stone.

Something Is Marching Straight To Myself
Still I Am Ruling My Castle Of Dust.
Forlorn I'm Singing A Cry To The Cold
I'm Forlorn.

Take All My Dreams
Follow My Breathing
Time Is Breaking
Gathering Its Sad Ruins

Forlorn
The Land Are Quivering
I Feel It Close

Tell Me The Story, Tell Me That Place
What's About Where You Come From
How Many Realms You Destroyed
How Many Realms Live By Your Light
Where Do We Belong Now?
Now.

Cold
Embracing My Land
Without The Missing Of Past
Clouds,
Today Will Not Cry
Even This Day It's The Last

Something Is Marching To The Skyline Above
Still I Am Ruling My Castle Of Ice.
Forlorn I'm Sleeping 'Till The Sun Will Araise.
