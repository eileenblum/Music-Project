Spell
Feeling Bewitched By A Dream
Dream Has Been Changing For Time

After
The Time Has Shown Me The Mistake
Mistake Of A Liar

Now
Trapped Of This Life Without A Light
Into Myprayers

More Forever Lost, Lost Among The Shades
I've Never Found The Way
Never Turning Back

Forever, Deciver, Betrayer
Look Into My Eyes, Seeing A Silent Storm.

Why?
Why Only Once I've Seen The Sun
Tears Down The Clouds
Now The Dark Lunacy Surrounds My Dome:

Faster
Falling In The Vault Of Disastre
Rain Keep On Falling

Glory
Forgetting The Love In My Self
For A Day Of Glory
More Forever Lost, Lost Among The Shades
I've Never Found The Way
Never Turning Back

Forever, Deciver, Betrayer
Look Into My Eyes, Seeing A Silent Storm.

Lost In Mind
Of A Morning Lorn
I'm Waiting For, Like A Silent Swan
The First Snow, Begins To Fall
I Will Cry, Cry Your Name, Cry...

I Can't See Your Vacant Soul
Can You Feel My Flying Prayers ?
The Wings Of Night
Embrace My Shadow
Now I Wish You May Feel My Sight, Sight
And Now Take My Cry.
