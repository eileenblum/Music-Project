Night fall
In bowing at the moonlight grow
Embracing to my misery 
Your silence is a fading sill
Seducing to my tired walk

Winter is near, its chest is open
Return again, the chirp of nameless dove?

Welcome my ladies, whoâs the one will lead me?
In this magic muffled, snow of midnight 
Whoâs ready to love me?â¦until fervour drop
Itâs rare in this time, this beauty full storm 

Taking all my sense
Taking my statuary corps 
Snow blind, running, alone in my trial.
Snow blind, forgetting all my victory  
Nightmare of cold.
Nightmare forever masquerade. 

Forever masquerade.
Falling, falling on my dirge
Falling, falling Iâm without peace
Falling, falling on my dirge
Falling, falling Iâm without peace

And turn the loom, and turn the loom
And turn the loom, it always turnâ¦foreverâ¦

Winter is near, its chest is open
Inpatient snow, dwell in its ribs
Return again, the chirp of nameless dove?

I askedâ¦ why, your eyes stayed in me
Stayed in me, as a cast star in heaven
You looked me along and speaking whit grace:
Because I love, your darkness reflect.

Taking all my senseâ¦take!
Beforeâ¦the snowâ¦untie. 
Forever masquerade 
Forever, forever up to the light
Nightmareâ¦ until the snowâ¦untie.
