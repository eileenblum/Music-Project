Nightâ¦
I feel the faith, turn into the pain,                        
In my name my sin is done
and turn into my endless shadows.

Darkâ¦
I feel your breathe, stroke my vanish lies
Between the slot, of memory
When the dyingâ¦. words sank in my heart

Black silent weaver from the pastâ¦
Save me, with your cloth wisely braid 

Blindness of mankind, 
erased my will, my human mind. 
Rage burn, in my blood 
And rain of madness put out the answerâ¦

Iâ ll find the pathway to save your life 
This is my pledge, this is my name..
Iâ ll find the pathway for kiss my angel
Because without the pain, there isn't faith

Black silent weaver from the pastâ¦
save me, with your cloth wisely braid 
Black omen callâ¦I canât remain 

I'll find the reason, I'll leave my tears
I'll pay for heaven, I'll pay for hopes, for all.

Die into the wait, for lying fly
When last time that I kiss her lips.
My hesitate in endless regrets 
My inexistence, mirror of yearningâ¦lost

Rowing into this tale
Of appealing masquerade 
Silent weaver sing for me 
When will your knitting loomâ¦turn ones again

I leave the reason, I find my tears
I'll pay for heaven, I'll pay for hopes, for all.

Die into wait, for lying fly
When last time that I kiss her lips.
My hesitate is endless regrets 
My inexistence, mirror of yearningâ¦lost

Maybe, one day, you feel my name
Sprained, confused out there in time
Maybe, one day, you feel my pain
Tremble, and daring, that running fast to you.

Angel of dustâ¦my memory
Angel of dust... apart to meâ¦
