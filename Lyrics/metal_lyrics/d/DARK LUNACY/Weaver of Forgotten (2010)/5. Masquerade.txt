Nothing in heaven will raise this man                       
Nothing for this my fragile caress
Memory, oppressing the time goes on
Decay.. is crunch my mind

My naivety, my muddleâ¦ my veils
And weaver is working â¦ my tales
Like sirens in ocean beholds mankind 
Sadnessâ¦the abyss from my hopes 

How many ways there are to die
In my Tatlin tower, I caged the raise

Rage from beholder. Repression tears
Give me my redemption...another kiss
Reflection of timeless, the nothing shine
the light......I don't  know

Fire of  revengeâ¦ will burn
This cold existenceâ¦ shout up
How many damage, I deceived again 
After I can forgot  your nameâ¦

How many ways there are to die
In my Tatlin tower, I caged the raise

All silence, all silence 
All silenceâ¦on me..
Come on preacher
This night canât waiting, over
Come on preacher
The night canât waiting more againâ¦

Masqueradeâ¦is my sentenced
Masqueradeâ¦ until my dame come back
