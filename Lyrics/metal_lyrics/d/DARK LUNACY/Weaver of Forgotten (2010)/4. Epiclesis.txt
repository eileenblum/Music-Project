Silk... 
enchanted veil, that embrace my bleeding memory
About your grace
when silent weaver make another face.

Eternal pledge in silent tears
wile this, scared watcher isâ¦near

Eternal pledge, in silent tears
How many shard, Iâll keep? 
Prisoner in a shine
covered by the fears
Freedom, in vanish ring of time
Meltedâ¦ from howling sun.  

If only you believed 
and cross my sad, armoring true 
the gates over de rain
if you, if you, believedâ¦believed in me.. now

âLoosing in my pathwaysâ¦before the shadows fall
how many time I calledâ¦how many time Iâm waiting 
prisoner in grave without a lid of wood 
tear in  terror, light of  lightâ¦end to end and never days 
Loosing in pathwaysâ¦before shadows fallâ

The veil on my surrender 
your face into my eyes
forever turning back in mind
and never more my days arise

Eternal pledge, in silent tears
How many shard, Iâll keep? 
Prisoner in a shine
covered by the fears
Freedom, in vanish ring of time
Meltedâ¦ from howling sun.  

If you, if you, believed 
Believe and die 
For this, armoring true 
For  gates over de rain
My face over my maskâ¦along my sadness 

Iâm afraid, Iâm disappear
In fragile, human, blowing side
Our sin slowly rise
In the breath of mortal soul

You know my regrets
But waiting your caress
Epiclesis that what I see
Epiclesis that all I feel.
