Rise the harshness light
On this cold day of march 
Waves the yearning, are moving wild
Along the involved dirge of broken life
Broken lifeâ¦ beginning time.

My jailor.
Lying guardian of mi delay
My soul believed in mourning breeze 
But scythe is tear all certainties  of the day  
And love, for life is changed, 
In endless deep remorse
Cause I canât tell âI love youâ at my side.

All medal has itâs dark reverse
And you know well, my only friend
I need a strong, to be beloved
Cause I want drive my suffering  

Forgive me, my guiltness preys 
Help meâ¦pray for my sin
My weaverâ¦ forgive my soul
Forgive me like I am forgiving you

Eternal endâ¦ in endless nights
My closed eyes, slowly are see.

All medal has itâs shine reverse
And you know good, my only friend
I need a strong, that you watch me
Cause I want know the really true.

Last faceâ¦last mask fallen
Are you evil? Or my awarness?
Are you evil or my remorse?
Reflect in mirror of my years

Jesus, show me please while I pray you
look me wile I'm looking you

Please remember you, the kiss from silent moth.
The stroke of mortal pride
I'm damned, I'm damned, I'm damned
Please remember you The kiss from crying moth.
The stroke of mortal pride
Cause I'm evil masquerade.
