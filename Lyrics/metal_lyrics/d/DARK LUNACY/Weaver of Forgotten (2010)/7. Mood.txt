Needless renewal
Winterâs  blow itâs frozen grace
A crying violin
Strings are trembling, raining chant.

Play for this melancholy
Play for all that can not be
Just a moment for return
Make me die, just for another time

Notes from a sorrow, lead me high 
Screaming all that I can not see

Angelâs bent to me
Spring  of ancient, mortal roses
Chained memory
Hollow into ruined gardens

Play my bleeding violin
Play for take me to the quiet
Just a moment for return
Make me die do it caressing me

Deceive my depriving
Cast dreaminess prevail  
Music is falling on my hart
My bramble wait forgotten rain.
Deceive and kiss my hand
Deceive and lull my dirge
The trees of childhood slowly rise
The branch  of life embrace the storm.

Bleeding stroke, lull my dirge.

How many words are burned?
Along the our tales
Rewind your loom and turn to other page
Strings, are tear the faces of  cloud 
Horizon  fall inside the hills.
My notes the ages along my jail
Another face, another maskâ¦
The mask of opera.

Deceive my depriving
Cast dreaminess prevail  
Music is falling on my hart
My bramble wait forgotten rain.
Deceive and kiss my hand
Deceive and lull my dirge
Until the season claim itâs rage
Begins the swallow coming back

Slaughter mind, rebel you to life
And take this noteâ¦for me... for Godâ¦

Nothing, nothing, around my shout 
Please row meâ¦another mask 
Nothing, nothing, around my shout 
Please row meâ¦another face.
