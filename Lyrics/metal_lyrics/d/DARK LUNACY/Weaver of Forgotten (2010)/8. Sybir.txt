Locomotive is running inside the mist
The forest receives itâs smoking bit
Crouch into carriage, I feel the forward 
And my destination, drawing to the shroud

Windows reflect, this quietâ¦

Grievances is moving, along the mystic rail
Unfaithful apostle is stays morbidly near
But I canât feel the stroke, Iâm covered by loneliness.
Triumphant, my preacher, is calling to his mass
And slowly, dying children, are coming to your black
Cathedral burns in tears. 
Redemption for all sinner lost in time.

Windows reflect, this quietâ¦
The storm, is sleeping, between the wood
Running, to graveâ¦my funeral
Candle are waitingâ¦the flame of soul
Iâm ready for unclosed the sacred door

And for, my evil, one thousand, candleâ¦are shine. 

Grievances is moving, along the mystic rail
Unfaithful apostle is stays morbidly near
But I canât feel the stroke, Iâm covered by loneliness.
Every dump brick the sinner corps 
Every out candle, sinner lair

Candle are waitingâ¦the flame of soul
Iâm ready for the stroke of mortal bell

Window reflect, this quiet

The storm, is sleeping, between the wood
Running, to graveâ¦my funeral
Candle are waitingâ¦the flame of soul
Iâm ready for the stroke of mortal bell

Pierce my hand, whit ancient nail
My stigmata they want to blade
And for, my evil, one thousand, candleâ¦are shine.
