Through The Non-Time

The rain is turning to sleet
Se deep inside, black tears
Are falling
The sleet is turning to snow

Delight of cold
The cry of storm
Beside my soul
Until the end of times

If you want to hurt ...
Shoot, shoot
I walk Through The Non Time
If you want to kill ...
Tell, tell
I know ...
You'll leave me here in any regrets
The snow is turning to a cry
Eternal love, falls into nothing
The cry is turning in you

The grief for words
The fear to act
Forever close
Until the end of times

If you want to hurt ...
Shoot, shoot
I walk Through The Non Time
If you want to kill ...
Tell, tell
I know ...
You'll leave me here in my regrets
Let me here, my hopes are gone

You see me
I know it
I'm waiting for
Don't blame me ... shoot.
