These thoughts in my head,
hanging by a thread.
Itâs just a matter of time until I meet my end.

I never thought that it would come to this
buried deep in my guilt, I am the product of self
loathing at its fucking finest, will I last the night or just fucking end this.

Left behind, left out of your sight
and left out of your mind.
Iâm not like the rest, Iâm remorseful at best.
Just another night where I wonât lay my head to rest again.

Hows it feel to be fucking alone
nowhere else that you can call your home.
Hows it feel to be fucking alone
with your name on that fucking tombstone.

Iâve been down this road before,
left behind with nothing more.
Nothing left for me,
I will always be
out on my own wondering who I used to be.

Every fucking day I wish I could leave this behind,
left behind out of sight, out of mind.
You wish you could leave this all behind.
Left behind out of sight out of my mind.

[Taylor Bryant of Beacons]
And at the end of the day
When you're all out of lies to say
Crawl back, into your hole
You never had a home and you don't be long
Crawl back into your hole you mother fucker.

Crawl back into your hole,
left behind without a fucking soul.
Crawl back into your hole
left behind without a fucking soul.
