Close your blinds and keep the darkness in
Drowning in your own sorrow and fucking sin.
Just sit there and rot, as I start to grin.
On his death bed lies a man with nothing left to give.

Sloth
Fucking Sloth
Sloth
Unwanted and lost

Close the blinds and keep the darkness in
Drowning in your own sorrow and fucking sin.
Just sit there and rot, as I start to grin.
On his death bed lies a man with nothing left to give.

Your heart is racing
faster, faster.
I can hear it beating.

Don't fight off the pain
its for you own good,
I can see you bleeding

Your heart is racing
faster, faster.
I can hear it beating.

Sloth
Fucking Sloth
Sloth
Unwanted and lost
