[feat. Brandon and Jesus of Vilis]A lying tongue held above a world of sin
Swinging back and forth, with a mindless grin.

Body aches, tormenting pain
I canât live with myself, Iâm fucking insane
An anxiety filled mess, torn up and depressed
I know I want the end and nothing fucking less.

Left behind, I want out of my head and out of my mind
Iâm not like the rest, Iâm remorseful at best
just another night where my thoughts grow dark again.

Relentless obsession, psychotic depression
Compulsions and rituals, my mind is digressing
No relief from this anxiety, only aggression
Leaves me with grief, I'll never learn this lesson

Nothing left for me, now itâs clear to see,
living the life of sin and Gluttony.
Nothing left for me, I will always be out of my mind,
watching who I used to be.

Locked coffin in the dirt and Iâve got the key
Put me out of my misery.
Locked coffin in the dirt and Iâve got the key.
Put me out of my motherfucking misery.

[Brandon and Jesus]
I try and try but nothing seems to fit
nothing seems to stick it can't be fixed
Stranded in the vast expanse of nothingness
There where I realized my meaninglessness
I can feel the vultures circle above me
circle above me.
