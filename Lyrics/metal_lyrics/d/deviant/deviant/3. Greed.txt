Fucking alone, and I couldnât care less
My times ticking and the clocks running fast
A simple lie is all it takes to be in denial
Iâll take my pride and hold on to it.

Iâm suffering but I still tell myself Iâm okay
A fucked up soul and a mind withering away.

The blood is rushing to my head,
I'm fucking out of my mind, out of my mind,
I speak the filth Iâve been fed.

The blood is rushing to my head,
I'm fucking out of my mind, out of my mind,
Iâll live this life of greed tilâ I am dead.

I'm rotting, Iâm rotting, I'm rotting alone, greed has taken my life and has taken my soul.

The blood is rushing to my head,
I'm fucking out of my mind, out of my mind,
I speak the filth that Iâve been fed.

The blood is rushing to my head,
I'm fucking out of my mind, out of my mind,
Iâll live this life of greed tilâ I am dead.

I'm rotting, Iâm rotting, I'm rotting alone, greed has taken my life and has taken my soul.
