[feat. Logan Beaver of Eavesdropper]I'll take some time, collect my thoughts, let my fear disappear.
My wrath is eating me alive and there's no stopping me my dear.

You want my wrath, well come and get it. I've lost my mind.

Intrusive thoughts, no fucking empathy, I'll let your death be mine you will not get the best of me.

My minds been consumed by sin, this pain controls me, your name on a tombstone is the only thing I need.

I'll watch you tremble, watch you scream with fear, I know you feel the reapers footsteps growing near.

I know you feel him near.
I know you feel him here.

I feel my wrath it's something I can't fucking shake, another second in my mind and I'll fucking break.

Back to breaking necks to pass the time, I'm shaking coffins to steal their spines. All for the thrill, make me whole again. All for the thrill, so I can see again.

Hands blood red eyes turn black. My mind is gone and I wont turn back.

Hands red.
Eyes black.
My mind is gone.
I won't turn back.
