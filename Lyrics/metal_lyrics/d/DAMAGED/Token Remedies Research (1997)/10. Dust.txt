Tank full, primed, pinned,
Saved bleed up, tangled torn,
Assimilate another share of apathy,
Dig another well of therapy,
Mined cut dirt dug from the ground beneath you.

Sink teeth, try your turn,
Coming down syndrome,
Spray scratch pine,
And bring it down into haste,
Strive on consistency, why wait?
Holding a cup of thirst campaign,
Thoughts insane, tasting insist,
Adding sprinkles of salt to the pain.

Coming down syndrome,
All fate lies in wait to pin you down,
Excavate, scratch pine rife mediocrity lactate,
Cold inner emptiness inspire?
Substitutes, dilate, instantly fried.

Inside decay, dependent's day
Banal the fruit, ferment the flesh,
The memories I can't recall,
Depend the trend for warts an' all.

A path direct to self-neglect to compensate,
Correct in hate, polluted, crushed, impatient scud,
Diluted vibrant pissing in its blood,
Come to kill yourself.

Apocalypse lights set way theocratic lessons... insight??
Blind, stray lesson sold,
Bought like gold.
Laughing nihilist, turns away
Bleed through, chastity's not my enemy.
It's your bleeding hope.
