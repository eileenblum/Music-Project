Oh, can't you see that's what they do?
Suck the marrow out of,
Rake, take,
All this never ending fucking,
Give, take, break,

In my brain there is a stain restrained,
Turn 'till time stands still,
Where no one will
And it makes me wanna kill.

Bleed, take,
Always ever unfulfilled,
Holding down that weight of sin
That's trapped it all within
Leaving primal motives in the way.
