Oh can't you see that's what they do
Suck the marrow out of you
Rake take
All this never ending fucking give
Take break
In my brain there is a stain
Restrained
Turn till time stands still where no one will
And it makes me wanna kill
Bleed take
Always ever unfulfilled
Holding down that weight of sin
If thats trapped it all within
Leaving primal motives in the way
