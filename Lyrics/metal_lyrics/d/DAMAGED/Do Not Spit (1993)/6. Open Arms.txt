Taste me
In haste
I waste
Blood grit
Mind spit

Pound the head, common senses dread
Cutting ulcers within
Living under my skin

Inflict upon me
Thinking of you
Think
Reoccur opening mind pits
Dimensions gaining
My temple straining
Inside out feeling again

Inside
I've tried
To taste
Mind grit
Blood spit
