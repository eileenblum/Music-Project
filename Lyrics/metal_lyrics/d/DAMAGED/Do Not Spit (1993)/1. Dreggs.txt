Breathe, naturally dependent, see?
Proof!!?...example... tree
Of life and death from core 'till bark
Severed cut defined
Chip away at every root
Seeping self abuse
Running forward glancing back
Skin the golden goose
Impro-evolution trends
Trust it to be you that lies unfeeling
Anti-lution

Dreggs!
You generate prophetic insight
Breathe, heave, rising damp cut

Turning back to see yourself
Walking after someone else

On your way to demonstrate
Don't forget to shut the gate
Be the air you breathe

Walk away, puzzled by solutions? breathe
Choke on darwinistic dyes
Spit the teeth of progress
In my eye.
Your general apathetic insight
Times seen lies educate
Turning back to see myself
Talking after no one else

Spat back in your eye
Evolution's dreggs
