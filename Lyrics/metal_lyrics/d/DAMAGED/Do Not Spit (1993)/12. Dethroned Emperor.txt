[Celtic Frost Cover]

See the portal 
Gates to madness 
Locked forever in a veil of shame 

Deny extraction 
Thirst for disgrace 
Watch his breaking 
The Emperor's killed 
Light of the day 
Shadows from beyond 
Scaffold of steel 
The throne has gone 

Dethroned Emperor 

The foot of the stairs 
Dimension in might 
The king sits 
His eyes are glass 
Growing of the small 
The laughters fall 
Can you deny 
Remaining cries 

Descent of the lords 
Into the trap 
Existance and hate 
Unseen gate
