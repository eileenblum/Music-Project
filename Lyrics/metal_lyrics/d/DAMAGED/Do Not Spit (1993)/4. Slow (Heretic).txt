Token casting, permanent, lasting
Rise on your own feet in your back

Rise imminent tools consummate rage
Socialist stage liberalize lies
Ideal allies colonial ties
Mirror of sin U.S.Akin

Our, mothered country, colony
Handed down by sovereignty
Alienate subversive tract, continental retro act
Intro-spective sucking fool
Underpaid redundancy
Leave uncultured primal wake
Endless fucking give n take

Race, run, reason, hatred, handed down
Raised run western in a kingdom
Missionary cast, culled, killing all opinion
Elementary boundaries, keep it underneath
Culturedepravity

I haven't been the dead heart inadequate
Abomination, spawn a tyranny
Rent, missionary sickness
Squeezing out the life, this, rudimentary seed

Bound, gagged, mutant elevation
This is what it feels like
Being what it is, not, knowing where to start
(you) can't walk away
Uh

Rise eminent fools consummate rage
Cultural stage fantasize lies
And idealize mirror of skin
U.S.A king locking you in.

Why sympathize, exemplified, paralysed

Taxed taken up
Handed down regal crown
You fucking fool with your social lies, alibies
Indifferent identities. end extreme, all extreme.
Uh.
