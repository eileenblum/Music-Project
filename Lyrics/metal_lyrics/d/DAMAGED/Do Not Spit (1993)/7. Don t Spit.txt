Sick of it all, of the names that you call
And that way that you walk
(what to say, when to talk)
Ending freedom of thought
(prove the proof in truth)
That is acting aloud, abnormalities proud
Aren't you?

Don't try pull the padlock on your pen
Predestined enforcement, stains, idealistic pigeon hole
Don't loose the key to end control

No purpose reason truth fact right o' left
Last crack first back there's nowhere left to go
Can't move, is it it?, looks hard, does it fit?
Imminent crusade, opposite afraid, decadent

Don't spit, don't bleed, don't have, don't please
Don't walk, can't, won't try, don't please, oh!
Can't move, can't breathe, can't go
Doctrined conform suppositories
Believe in it
It's everywhere
Just look around
N' see yourself
Believing it.

Rigmarole, on control
Vacant won't, don't decadent.
Uh!
