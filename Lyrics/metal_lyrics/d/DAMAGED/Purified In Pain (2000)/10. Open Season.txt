take a look at all the sheep grazing
take a look at yourself, you're crazy
take for granted that you'll always have solutions
take for granted in your own delusion

i thought i had everything i wanted
i saw first hand, a life adjusted
compromised and poliltized
watch us all fall from the sky
all fall in line

i thought i had everything i wanted
i saw first hand, the errors i have entrusted
follow the reason
it's open season

look to me for guidance, what a joke?
if life was so perfect, no hope
no hope

mindless and grazing
complacent and lazy

if you think for a moment our world, contained?
media draws blood, blood on our culture

be let be fail and link the chain
be the fool and fall in line
stand alone and be yourself for once
fuck you average whore!
fucked... fucked average whore!
