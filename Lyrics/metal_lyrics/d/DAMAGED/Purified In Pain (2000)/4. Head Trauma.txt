blood and scorn
the politics in piss you fix
a christ parade
points of reason sorely missed
you missed

first your story hit without a glitch
before it crushed itself to bits, you thought
your stories told are old
the politics of missing it

I'm through with it, well over it, done
I'm moving on with with what is mine, nevermind

bastard, broken dreams and shattered minds
policies you hope to find
cause in your mind you'll never hide
for what you breed is what you'll get

I'm through with it, well over it, done
I'm moving on with with what is mine, nevermind

same old, same old, stories and clicks
same old, same old, bored with what you fix
I'm done with all your foolish fallacies
the politics in piss you fix
your policies in piss
