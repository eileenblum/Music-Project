lost in me, deep inside hypocrisy
lost in me, nihilistic tendencies
crawling inside, crawling inside
thoughts of chaos, genocide, feeling lifeless inside
lawless in the fight, bringing on the menticide
the killing in me drains empty
killing in me drain empty

take my hand walk with me annihilation embracing
take my hand sweet child, total annihilation...
is ours

into annihilation end humanity,
the cause of wars are pointless in our lost society
lost in me
lost in me
lost, lost... lost

the end is near, ending man's darkest joke
to stand aside and watch it all
i pull in life and drain all hope
lost in me
lost in me
into annihilation
