the walls we face
oppressed in every way
the life i thought to be collides with yesterday

well i thought I'd be the man to be
a man who's will to fight alone,
alone for you and me

i know fooled conviction
i know fooled on fools lies
fooled by a false conviction
fooled by it's fallacy
fooled by the conman smiling
fooled by the sad mans casualty

full on feel my rage
the cause of war re-engaged
inner fear lost in my hate
step to embrace pain
follow me in your cage
can't you feel my rage
engage

carve lines of conviction
poison fantasy
sweet rails toxicity
crawling oblivion
did i fail to mention... your oblivion

the problems conviction is following you
total amnesia will never free you
well i failed to mention you're hung

inner fear lost in my hate
step to embrace pain
follow me in your cage
can't you feel my rage
