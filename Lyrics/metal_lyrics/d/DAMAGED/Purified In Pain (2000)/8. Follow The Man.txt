been there, done that
I'm the man with nothing to prove
high dollars will follow
i'll holler, you'll bother to move
been a traveling fool for all to see
losing track of life's simplicity
been told to march on
been told to follow at all cost

follow the man, follow

no more your whore
living my life my way you'll see
no longer the fool
guided by your sticks and strings
i guide, my path my way I'll choose
for when i stand up straight
I'll never lose... you lose

i bark you bite, you flex your might
the reign of blood brings on our fight
been at war for inner peace
bleeding logic blankly
my war my soul, my sanity
shift down, locked down by dignity
been at war for inner peace

follow the man, follow

no more your whore
living my life my way you'll see
no longer the fool
guided by your sticks and strings
i guide, my path my way I'll choose
for when i stand up straight
I'll never lose... you lose
