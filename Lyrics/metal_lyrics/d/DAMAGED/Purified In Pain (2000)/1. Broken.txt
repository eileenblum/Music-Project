broken, by now my mind has broken free
gears seize in blasphemy
i turn to shamed inconsistencies
laid low, i'm alone
not the man i'd grown to be
fell short, my mark
empty man, no plans from the start

picked a man whose broken on the inside
wish a sweet ride to the other side
and for all my short comings
life cut through me, i'm empty inside

a broken man broke inside

by now I'm falling
burnt empty in misery
look no further down empty roads
broken glass my only option
senseless, drop out, insert
kill fuck die, become god

dead blind men can't see

full of ambition, full of contrition
full of ambition, full of shit... full on full of fucking shit
