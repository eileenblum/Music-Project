well lifes a changing, gone yesterday
daydreamers hold a quality
looking back on all i've been through
living life in the fullest way

life deals it share of bullshit, up the odds complacency
rise above the common problems, solve solutions today
life deals it share of bullshit... while life's
evolving
try to find the reasons why
lifestyle changes I've tried
picture a world complication free
lifestyles
life is short too short to look back, stand on your feet

if i choose to score more, follow my instincts follow the score
well i don't know why you try to hide, follow my instincts follow the score
well if I'm to be all that you need, follow my instincts follow the score
score
if i felt an ounce of sympathy never shown
i paid my dues, now eat your just rewards
lifestyles
the fall of man from inside comes deceit
a pinch of salt skin deep is all that you read
look deeper, never from a far
for i will reign in disdain, deal with my scars

the fall of man from inside
comes from deceit, comes from deceit

the fall of me is now
