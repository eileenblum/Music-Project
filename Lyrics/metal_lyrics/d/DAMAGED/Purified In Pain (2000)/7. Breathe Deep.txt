for now all i want to see
breathe deep, take life clearly
new clear conscience chemically
toxicity burns inside me

fall into a boring trap, never knowing where you're at
conscience high dose, dropping out the lot of facts
breathe deep, take life clearly

i choose my life, i chose

fall into a boring trap, never knowing where you're at
conscience high dose, dropping out the lot of facts

the beast within my mind
hanging from ropes
the balance i will find
before i choke
i choke
breathe deep, take life clearly

i choose my life, i chose

ill in mind, confused in idle fodder
kill mankind, crack the new world order
a piece of peace is what I'd like to see
humanity, crumbles all around me
crumble
