burning hate death fuck
wrap your legs around this

lead pipes go through skulls

in beams of red
if life was a bit of what it should be
I'd be your one true son

preach religion individualistic needs
drop kicks bad bits done

beatings and killings all that are willing
crossing the lines... deaths true calling

nothing to say to you, nothing for you, yeah you

fits of anger, fits of rage burning inside me
life estranged, through disdain, burning inside me
fits of anger, fits of rage burning inside me

burning hate death fuck

in beams of red i paint the walls of all atrocities
bloodlust, bloodkill, calling

fits of anger, fits of rage burning inside me
life estranged, through disdain, burning inside me
fits of anger, fits of rage burning inside me
