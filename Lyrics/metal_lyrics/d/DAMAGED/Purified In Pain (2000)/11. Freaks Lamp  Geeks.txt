running weed through downtown streets
dodging cabs with fuck to say
bet your ass don't hit concrete
man rolls in, you'll pay

the freakshow and geeks

pager blows up time to hit the streets
weave the traffic like a fuckin' lunatic
breathe the diesel almost got curbed
ill swing a chain through this fucks window

the freakshow and geeks

tracking numbers box it all
lead pipe law through it all
streetfights, early times, last call
hit tombs, tomb school

the freakshow and geeks

little slits of paper
start the day in colors way
burning down Ave. C
lacruix crew blow death away,
blow away yeah!
fuck yeah!

kickin' it in thompkins square
skin-up blue skies over shooting grounds
looking out for the cops
rolling through our park

my freakshow, i am the geek

i am the geek the geek freak... freak

i am the geek the freak of geeks, the freak of geeks
