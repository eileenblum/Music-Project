not what you want to be
who'll become the beast
killing technology

dogs of war and blasphemy
eating our humanity

digital infinities
computerised fallacies
killing our humanity dogs of war and blasphemy
eating our humanity
human

if all could stay, it be the way
the laws of war engraved could save ourselves from cyberslaves
our wars enslaved, enclave this way
a life within human touch beyond our former cyberslaves
loveless in every way

join all and feast, infect disease
the politician waves his hand in deceit
to pollinate a new breed, electro-pulse bleeds
the lines of computations, losses that we feed

breaking the rules that be, demonic policies
download the shock of hacking locks inside our chemistry
fall inevitably, into futures lead
the lines of computations, losses that we feed
we feed

not what you want to be
who'll become the beast
killing technology

dogs of war and blasphemy
eating our humanity

digital infinities
computerised fallacies
killing our humanity

dogs of war and blasphemy
eating our humanity
