[Music &amp; Lyrics by R. Alvarez]

Blood curdles well across your 'Holy Land',
The place of unrelenting genocide,
Murdering in the name of your god,
The three thousand year old way of life,
Symbiosis of religion and murder,
Your pre-destined way to die,
Can you not live logically,
And destroy God utterly!

Waist blood on an invisible lie,
Your only known form of life,
Can't you see another way,
Impede your social decay...
Leave your children free,
Unshackled from the ways of God
Logic is your only other way
To impede your social decay!

The whole Earth is scared by Humanity,
In it's never ending wars of hostility,
For blood feeds your futileness,
Your pre-destined way to die!
Behold your leader's untimely death,
By the hands of your OWN people,
Behold the act of 'Lebensraum',
Committed upon the Palestinians,
Systemized Jewish Nazism,
Devouring the entire land,
Why make their children cry in pain
For your selfish gain?!

Waist blood on an invisible lie,
Your only known form of life,
Can't you see another way,
Impede your social decay...
Leave your children free,
Unshackled from the ways of God
Logic is your only other way
To impede your social decay!

Ignorance consumes you all,
Blind to see true reality,
Take away the bond of God,
You'll see all blood runs red!
-ALL BLOOD RUNS RED!-
