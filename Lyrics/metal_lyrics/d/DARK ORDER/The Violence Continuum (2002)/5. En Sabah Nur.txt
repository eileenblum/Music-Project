[Music by R. Alvarez, Lyrics: R. Alvarez, M. Alvarez]

Behold the power that I am,
For one and all, a Demon you see,
Conceived in Egypt's ancient sands,
Culled from the mightiest of might,
I, the ancient warrior soul,
I conquer all with indomitable strength,
I am Apocalypse, your overlord,
Weep in my presence mankind!

Born the child of destiny,
The first light of never ending night,
The day of Isis ever rising,
When dire omens come to pass,
Through the ravages of time,
I've conquered with such might,
Destroying all that is inferior,
Making way for that which is superior!

Nature has me placed,
Above all other life forms,
To crush, conquer and survive,
To stand the test of time!
This will cannot be crushed,
For my wrath is eternal,
I will not be denied,
You the weak, stand while you can!

Weep O' pious ones!
I am your prophecy!

Behold the power that I am,
For one and all, a Demon you see,
Conceived in Egypt's ancient sands,
Culled from the mightiest of might,
I, the ancient warrior soul,
I conquer all with indomitable strength,
I am Apocalypse, your overlord,
Weep in my presence mankind!

Behold the future that is,
A future that I created,
The future assimilation,
My future to rule over,
MY NATURE,
TO CRUSH,
TO CONQUER,
AND SURVIVE!

Know this, a storm is coming,
It is I, the overlord, who will carve,
The bloody path across the-
Genetic history of Mankind,
First am I, heir bringer,
Of a race that will be worthy,
Kingdoms bow at my feet,
Weep in my presence Mankind!
