[Music &amp; Lyrics: R. Alvarez]

Forged in fire and blood,
Five thousand years ago,
Civilization began,
In kingdoms built of stone,
And with it came,
Manifestations-
-of God-Kings,
Dynastic-
-Imperium,
Laws of State-
-and religion,
Driven by-
-Human compulsion.

Drive towards-
Disunity through warfare,
Unity through peace,
Environmental manipulation,
Slowly killing Earth,
With our Human empire!

Great Kings arose and built
The great nations of Earth,
Embarking great conquests
Of Imperial expansion,
And with it
Atrocities-
-of murder
Mass raping-
-of nations
Massacre-
-of millions
The violent act-
-of war!

Progression through science,
Regression through religion,
Environmental manipulation,
Driven by insidious greed,
And cyclical lust for power,
De-evolutionary disease,
Rampant, out of control,
Slowly killing Earth,
with our Terran Empire!

Science breaks through pious ignorance,
Imperative for the Earths future,
[Solo: Lord Tim]
Two World War's in one century,
A killing toll unmatched in history,
[Solo: Lord Tim]
Overpopulation, like a virus it spreads,
The Third World War is unavoidable,
[Solo: Lord Tim]
Abolishment of religion and money,
Logic will be our sole savior!
[Solo: Lord Tim]
