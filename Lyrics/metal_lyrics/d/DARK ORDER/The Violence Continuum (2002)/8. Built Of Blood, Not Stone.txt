[Music &amp; Lyrics by Raul Ignacio Alvarez]

Behold the Earth and all the life that it supports,
An ecosystem unmatched anywhere else in this Galaxy,
Billions of years of life and death struggling to evolve,
Now it's all threatened by the cancer that is Mankind!

Extinction of numerous species runs rampant through the planet,
Forced upon by Industrialization of developing nations,
Oblivious to the carnage and murder that they create,
Ignorant to the fact that they are slowly killing themselves!

Blind to our lie,
We slowly die,
From Genocide
Of life on Earth,
The shrine built of blood, not stone,
The ONLY Class-M planet we know,
Why do we continue to ravage her,
The sole life blood to our existence.

War forced decline,
Must we all die,
From our own crime,
Killing life on Earth,
The shrine built of blood, not stone,
The ONLY Class-M planet we know,
Why do we persist in plundering her,
The sole life blood to our existence.

You'll see see the sin,
I'll never see what happened again,
What do you think I am?
Do you think the dead are un-living?
Death is everywhere,
But also around the force of life and death,
Nothing can stand between them,
Your ways are futile,
You will not succeed,
You will fall under the rule of Logic-
-FOREVER MORE!-

Greed forced decline,
We slowly die,
Of our own crime,
Killing life on Earth
The shrine built of blood, not stone,
The ONLY Class-M planet we know,
Why do we persist in plundering her,
The sole life blood to our existence.

Global devastation-
-The legacy of Humanity left left in the blood of dead animals and forest,
Ecological suicide forced upon by economical drive,
We blindly pillage to survive, proliferating
Earth's demise, Corporations profitize,
Reality of it all, we are contributing to own demise-
-WHY!-
