[Music &amp; Lyrics: R. Alvarez, Z. Mrakic]

For so long ignored by the world we live in,
Forced out, presumed non existent,
This is their world of lies and deceit,
Moronic, pathetic mental ignorance,
Fearing aptitude they cannot understand,
Wade through weakness and loss of soul,
Corrupting minds for their intentions,
Uniform cerebral image control.

Forward we thrust with the power of steel,
Unified strength under one feared source,
Instrument of war in secrecy contained,
Not knowing what death awaits them!
Storming through with lightning war,
A killing field of unmarked graves,
Fallen ignorance in seas of blood,
Dignified in our art of warfare.

The war has begun,
Our armies are as one,
The war has begun,
Our violent rise has come,
The war has begun,
Power second to none,
The war has begun,
Your time to die has come!

Inexorably, onwards we march,
Through the bloodied path of this road to war,
A force that nothing on Earth
can ever hope to rival,
Our almighty dark battalions,
The legions of Heavy Metal,
Forever we'll fight with our hearts of steel!

Devastating Metal ferocity,
Discharging sonic deluge,
Shattering their anamorphousis,
Obliterating 'electronic' sepsis!
Execute our law of steel,
Upon which we will rule the Earth,
Glory, Honor (and) Heavy Metal,
(The) Triumph of the Human spirit!

The war has begun,
Our armies are as one,
The war has begun,
Our violent rise has come,
The war has begun,
Power second to none,
The war has begun,
Your time to die has come!

The war has begun,
Our armies are as one,
The war has begun,
Our violent rise has come,
The war has begun,
Power second to none,
The war has begun,
Your time to die has come!
