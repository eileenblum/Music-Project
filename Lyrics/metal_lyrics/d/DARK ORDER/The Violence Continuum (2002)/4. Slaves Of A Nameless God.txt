[Music &amp; Lyrics: R. Alvarez]

Slaves of a nameless god!

He, who you cannot see,
You believe in endlessly,
Will save your mortal soul,
From he, who you cannot see,
Who you fear endlessly,
Will crush your mortal soul.

Futile is your quest for truth,
Blinded by holy light,
Hippocratic want of lies,
Follow the Cross of Two Thousand years,
Carry the blood slain upon your souls,
Bare the symbol of holy evil,
The swastika of Christianity.

Surrender your hearts,
Surrender your minds,
Surrender your souls,
Surrender your wealth,
Surrender your lives,
Surrender to your Lord

Slaves of a nameless God,
Slaves of a nameless God,
Slaves of a nameless God,
Slaves of a nameless God,

Sway in song, your holy Nexus,
Ye mindless automatons,
Bearers of age old lies,
Masturbate thy souls with the Bible,
O' legions of the fatal Cross,
(The - )
B-ook of-
I-ncredible
B-ias,
L-ies and
E-rrors,
In the name of a nameless god!

Yield thy disposition,
Yield thy cognition,
Yield thy spiritus,
Yield thy opulence,
Yield thy existence,
Yield unto thy Lord,

Slaves of a nameless God,
Slaves of a nameless God,
Slaves of a nameless God,
All slaves of a nameless God!

Countless wars, countless millions,
All slaughtered by the murderous Cross!
Satan, your scapegoat of evil,
Concocted image of stifled minds!

Close thy eye's for faith,
In thy holy Pa-Wraith,
Commend thy servile soul,
Close thy mind's to science,
God thy sole reliance,
Commend thy purile soul...

Now it's time to kill all Christianity,
Rip apart their god's soul, revenge,
the reason of the dead,
Feel the pain of Humans mass murdered,
No Heaven nor Hell, just Humanity and Earth!

Surrender your hearts,
Surrender your minds,
Surrender your souls,
Yield thy disposition,
Yield thy opulence,
Yield thy existence!
Slaves of a nameless...
Slaves of a nameless god,
Slaves of a nameless...
Slaves of a nameless god!
