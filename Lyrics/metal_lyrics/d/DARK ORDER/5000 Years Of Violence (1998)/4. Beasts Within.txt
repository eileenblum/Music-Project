[Music: Raul Ignacio Alvarez / Zoran Mrakic, Lyrics: Raul Ignacio Alvarez]

In the darkened depths of my being
A silent war is raging
Slowly ravaging my body
In an endless battle for supremacy
A massive invasion of brutal beasts
Engaged in a war of conquest
Wanting to conquer my entire body
But what will they win if I die?
Ever since the first onslaught
The pain has tormented my body
But somehow I've kept my sanity
To go on with my crusade
My armies perpetually battle the beasts
Arrayed with their weapons of war
To make a great slaughter among them
Aiming to obliterate them all!
All my life I waged war
Against the aggressors
I will go on until the end
I shall never surrender
And if the beasts defeat me
I will still prevail
They will die within my corpse
As I rest in my tomb
The beasts within me
Preying on my soul
The beasts within me
Ravaging my body
The beasts within me
Forever I'll wage war
Against the beasts within me!
Twilight is now upon me
Soon darkness must fall
My body is battered and weakened
The silient war still rages on
My final battle approaches
Behold my last crusade
My final onslaught will it be
To the death I'll do battle!
Now my life is bygone
My warrior soul liberated
From my desolated body
The silent war has ceased
For now and all eternity
The beasts are captive in their netherworld
Soon to rot within my corpse
And I'll proclaim my victory!
The beasts within me
Preying on my soul
The beasts within me
Ravaging my body
The beasts within me
Forever I'll wage war
Against the beasts within me!
