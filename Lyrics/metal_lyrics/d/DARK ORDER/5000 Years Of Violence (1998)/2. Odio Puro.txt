[Music &amp; Lyrics: Raul Ignacio Alvarez, except verse 1: S. Stewart]

My black filled mind acquires
Overpowering thoughts
Of anger and hate for those who tread on me
With each depressive thought
My hate grows stronger
These feelings of hate distort my being
In the very abyss of my soul
DARKNESS
My blood runs so cold
MERCILESS
A life so full of nothing
BARREN
Absolutely nothing but Odio Puro
ODIO PURO
Tan lleno de Odio Puro!
This world created that which flows in my veins
That most foul stench of malevolence
Fed by humanity's deceits and treachery
Woe to those when it's power is unleashed
In the very abyss of my soul
DARKNESS
My blood runs so cold
MERCILESS
A life so full of nothing
BARREN
Absolutely nothing but Odio Puro
ODIO PURO
Tan lleno de Odio Puro!

[Solo: Joe Olic]

In the very abyss of my soul
DARKNESS
My blood runs so cold
MERCILESS
A life so full of nothing
BARREN
Absolutely nothing but Odio Puro
ODIO PURO
Tan lleno de Odio Puro!
SOULESS I have become
With my hateful ways
LIFELESS they shall become
If they tread on me
For my wrath will utterly consume them
And I will again power out of their pain!
