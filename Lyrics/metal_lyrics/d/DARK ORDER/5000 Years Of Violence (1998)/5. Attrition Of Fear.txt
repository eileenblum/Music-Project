[Music &amp; Lyrics: Raul Ignacio Alvarez]

On the cliffs of Gallipoli
Lies the scars of a long dead battle
ANZAC soldiers were forced to fight
In a war that wasn't theirs
Youthful warriors, searching for glory
Found nothing but a land of demise
Endless hunger, hatred and combat
Waiting to strike one down
Thus the attrition of fear began
PAIN is grinding our bodies away
GREAT FEAR is driving our minds insane
ANGUISH will never conquer us
We're fighting to the bitter end!
Relentless attacks through No-man's Land
Left the land drunk with blood
Scores of soldiers cut down as they charged
Slowly filling No-man's Land
Death's stench rides the wind
Rising from rotting corpses
Of humans who were once killers
But the fury of war had seized their lives
Thus the attrition of fear went on
Here, even the boldest warriors cry out in pain
Fearing the sheer horror of being shredded to death
Some being born as the unknown soldier
Others blown into nothingness
Severed limbs, horrid mutilations
All the common horrors of war!

[Solo 1 &amp; 2: Joe Olic]

PAIN is grinding our bodies away
GREAT FEAR is driving our minds insane
ANGUISH will never conquer us
We're fighting to the bitter end!
The slain lay everywhere
Retreat was the only solution
For the living to return home
Forever would their minds be torn
Thus the great battle was over
The dead returned to their homeland
They were once all gallant soldiers
How have the mighty fallen
Thus the attrition of fear has ceased...
...For now
