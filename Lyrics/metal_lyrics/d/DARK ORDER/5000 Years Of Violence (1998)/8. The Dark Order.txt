[Music: Raul Ignacio Alvarez / Zoran Mrakic / Joe Olic, Lyrics: Raul Ignacio Alvarez]

Undead I stalk the earth at night
Killing through oceans of time
Gathering lives, consuming their blood
Waging my war with God
The warmth of fresh blood
Rejuvenates my lifeless body
Prayers to God are futile
Your souls cannot be saved
Cursed eternally you shall become
To walk in the shadow of death
I, who commanded nations in life
Now lead the legions of Satan
Expanding His great imperial empire
Terrorizing the living slime
To which they have become the victims
Of this war with God
Prayers to God are futile
Your souls cannot be saved
Cursed eternally you shall become
To hunger for all living blood

[Solo: Joe]

I was betrayed in life
Forsaken by the god I served
Arisen in death, I avenge hers
With all the powers of darkness
The killing will never cease
For the blood is the life
The violent demise of God I yearn
Killing in the name of Dracul!
