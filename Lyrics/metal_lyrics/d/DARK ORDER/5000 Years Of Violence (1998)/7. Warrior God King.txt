[Music &amp; Lyrics: Raul Ignacio Alvarez]

I am the red flame of fire
With Amon's strength within me
Leading the way for my army in might
Nothing could stand before me
That wretched enemy, the Prince of Kadesh
Has come and entered into Megiddo
With all his princess and their armies
Have come to fight against my giant army!
Arising in Thebes, I am the mighty bull
And I just have one goal, one rule
Slaughter all those Asiatic fools
For Egypt's mighty strength and mighty rule!
I am the Warrior God-King
Mighty and strong
Death to those who dare confront me
I shall kill them all
Slaying all those barbarian dolts
I will make them scream
They shall fear the wrath of Thutmose
For I am the mightiest king
Serging forth with an army of millions
All arrayed with weapons of war
I crushed them all like a tidal wave of fire
Thousands dead by the score
The fear of my hellfire had entered their hearts
Like the poison of Uraeus
The they fled behind those city walls
Total anarchy and chaos!
Arising in Thebes, I am the mighty bull
And I just have one goal, one rule
Slaughter all those Asiatic fools
For Egypt's mighty strength and mighty rule!
I am the Warrior God-King
Mighty and strong
Death to those who dare confront me
I shall kill them all
Slaying all those barbarian dolts
I will make them scream
They shall fear the wrath of Thutmose
For I am the mightiest king

[Solo: Joe Olic]

A king is he, who is the valliant, whom seizes
But no one can seige him
A king is he, who thrusts his sword
Into Retenu's heart, which is bleeding
A king is he, who is mighty of arms
The excellent fortress of his army
A king is he, who killed that wretch
That fallen one of Mittani
Behold the prize that my army had captured
The grand city of Megiddo
It was the capture of a thousand cities
All the princes were within it's walls
They all bowed to my power
For the fear of the bull
All that the sun encompasses is in my grasp!
Arising in Thebes, I am the mighty bull
And I just have one goal, one rule
Slaughter all those Asiatic fools
For Egypt's mighty strength and mighty rule!
I am the Warrior God-King
Mighty and strong
DEAD to those who dared confront me
I KILLED them all
Slaying all those barbarian dolts
I MADE them scream
Now they fear the wrath of THUTMOSE
For now they fall to their knees!
