[Music: Raul Ignacio Alvarez / Zoran Mrakic, Lyrics: Raul Ignacio Alvarez]

Abhorrent, ignorance spread throughout society
Reigning supreme on the mindless sheep
Whom flock under my command
Religions, God-fearing, their minds are mine to control
Seeking answers to their pitiful lives
Drowning in a sea of lies
Tyrannical, the pain and power I covet
Cranial dispersions, submissive to me
Tyrannical, I cannot be stopped
Great power I possess
To tyrannize your life!
Social upheaval, born from conflicting minds
Life and laws they criticize, a game of political gain
Powerful disruptors, feeds this power play
Thriving on disunity, the chaos that I desire!
Tyrannical, the pain and power I covet
Cranial dispersions, submissive to me
Tyrannical, I cannot be stopped
Great power I possess
To tyrannize your life!
Subservient society
Oppressed by stupidity
Sociological insanity
Under my tyranny!

[Solo: Joe Olic]

Disease, hunger rampant on this planet
The wants of few outweigh the needs of the many
Chaos, disorder, maniacal intent
I WILL DESTROY ALL OF MANKIND AND PUT THEIR GOD TO DEATH!
Tyrannical, the pain and power I covet
Cranial dispersions, submissive to me
Tyrannical, I cannot be stopped
Great power I possess
To tyrannize your life!
