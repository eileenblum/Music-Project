[Music &amp; Lyrics: Raul Ignacio Alvarez]

Awaiting termination in their dark cells
They'll be sacrificed for the colour of their blood
Starved and tortured into utter oblivion
No fucking enclave to save their souls!
You cannot fathom the truth of humanity
We are equal in the face of death
Before capitulation, a free nation were they
Like so many others before them, they were enslaved
For no crime, they were made to suffer
By the malevolent fascist Christian hand!
Do you really think you're superior?
Incompetent fool, war is futile
All men are equal in the face of pain
Suffering and death, the past is prelude!
God forsaked his chosen people in the kingdom of Auschwitz

[Solo: Joe Olic]

There is no GOD to save the victims of genocide.

[Solo: Raul I Alvarez]

WAR IS THE FAILURE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT

[Solo: Joe Olic]

Racism and religion exist as one
Decaying away, the logics advance
The race towards death builds momentum
Everlasting genocide, mark the Nazi beast!
You cannot fathom the truth of humanity
Incompetent fool, war is futile
All men are equal in the face of pain
Suffering and death, the past is prelude!
