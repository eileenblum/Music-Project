[Music &amp; Lyrics: Raul Ignacio Alvarez / Zoran Mrakic]

Believing his lying words
His great messianic vision
Of a greater Deutchsland
For his desire they died
Millions of mesmerized humans
Captured by his fatal attraction
And his morbid ideology
That saturated Europe with blood
Slay for him
Maim for him
Sacrifice your life for him
Play the game of death
Of the WARLORD
Mass genocides of innocent lives
To cleanse Europe of the inferior races
LEBENSRAUM for the Arayan race
On desolated nations
But all were forgone to die
From the devastation of war
Even the Lord of the Warzone
Became covered in his own blood
Wars of the past are brought back to life
To fuel his desire of conquest
Violated treaties mean nothing to him
Encounter the Nazi war machine
Slay for him
Maim for him
Sacrifice your life for him
Play the game of death
Of the WARLORD
Elimination - crush the enemies in my arms
Maniacal - hatred's in my eyes
Contention - laughing as my enemies die
Obliterate - rapacious in my conquest

[Solo: Raul Ignacio Alvarez]

Wars of the past are brought back to life
To fuel his desire of conquest
Violated treaties mean nothing to him
Encounter the Nazi war machine
Slay for him
Maim for him
Sacrifice your lives for him
Play the game of death
In his warzone

[Solo: Joe Olic]
