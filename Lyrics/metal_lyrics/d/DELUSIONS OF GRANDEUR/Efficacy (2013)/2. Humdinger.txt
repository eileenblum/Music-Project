I am so sick of every ones excuses of why they cant be a decent fucking human being. It really isn't that hard to tell the truth and keep your word. Or else just keep to yourself. You will live and die in hell.

Why cant you take the blame for anything wrong that happens in your life.

You need a scapegoat for all of the problems you've created. Man up and take responsibility for your own actions no ones taking the fall for you.

Stand on your own two feet because we are separating from you right now.

We are all coming to an understanding of what will happen if this trend continues there will be no good people left on this earth.

Your pathological lies have become your own reality you cant distinguish whats made up and what is real. [2x]

Everybody better here my warning now we're on the path to a downward spiral. look in the mirror if you like what you see quit lying to yourself that we are truly free.

Quit lying to yourself [4x]
