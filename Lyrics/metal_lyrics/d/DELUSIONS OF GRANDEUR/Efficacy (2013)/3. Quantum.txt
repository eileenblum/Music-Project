Iâve seen the rise and fall, and I don't even understand it all. That weâve got nothing to show, for all the time we spent trying to grow. Theyâve wrecked all that I've worked for, yet still ask us to sacrifice more.

It is time to take a stand for everything. They have it all and we are left with nothing. When did our species get so insecure. Why don't any recognize truth anymore.

If you stand for nothing then you'll fall for anything.

Standing scared of your life. Gutless nothing inside. Fucking tear in your eye. No man is willing to cry [2x]

There is nothing inside.

This world does not care who you are at all.

HERE WE GO AGAIN!

This is where we chose our countries outcome in the war for your mind. [2x]

There are unseen forces in power they are controlling all and everything in this world.
