I am so numb I cannot feel. Reality just doesn't seem real. There's no past there's no future just the present stuck in constant stupor.

I do not know where ill end up or where ill go.

Get out get out of my way moving through time in space with no account of the day [2x]

What have we become How are the parts greater than the sum.

When will we finally understand that we were left here a species named man. There is not after life not even a plan. In the end we are all so damned.

Look at the stars and realize that universes exist within our eyes.
Gifts and natures surprise. Blindfolds on our heads constructed of corrupt lies.

I am so numb I cannot feel. Reality just doesn't seem real. There's no past. There's no future. Just the present stuck in constant stupor.
