All though the path was never clear, this vessels now harder to steer. They have tried to control us with fear, time for the elite masters to disappear. No one said that this life was fair but I'm sick of the stress and despair. Feel the winds of change in the air. Stop pretending like you don't care.

Just what will it take. For all of you to awake. Do not let your will break. The media stories are fake.

Why do you trust your government. They take joy in your discontent.

Now we all have seen the truth. All you needed was your proof. Now this once great country shall fall with the blame falling on us all. A time of basic survival is near. Plans for a new world order now clear. All we can do now is prepare. Food land ammo and guns. Shall replace all your worthless funds.
