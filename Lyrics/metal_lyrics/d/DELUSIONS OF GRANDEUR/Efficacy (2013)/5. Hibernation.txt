No morals and criminal intent. They have it all and turned this country into shit.

A revolution rises.

Will you stand by. Or will you be a part of it.

This is our only chance. To break away.

And I will do my part. To make sure that they can never induce. Their new world order.

Sickened by your actions. You think of only money. They have lying eyes. They have lying eyes.

They have lying eyes. They have lying eyes.

With a smile and a gleam they killed the American Dream. As they lie. Sinners die they killed our future, they killed the American Dream.
