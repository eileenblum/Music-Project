Something from nothing how can it be. An all powerful deity. Religion on one hand science on the other. some think we are controlled by big brother.

We know absolutely nothing. But what our perceptions allow. We claim to have the facts but they are misleading human beings are full of themselves.

Time is fake numbers aren't real, we played the hand we're dealt cant fold if its a bad deal. Our choices seem free will but its all an illusion unfathomable knowledge helps to fuel this confusion.

Reality is misleading. There's is a spirit trapped in every human being. There aren't truths in what your seeing. Global consciousness is slowly depleting.

A new age of enlightenment we surpassed all experiments .

Will the ancient astronauts return. Will all the religious books and temples burn. History repeats itself but we never seem to learn. When the books and temples are done it shall be our turn.

Why do we live this way. Trapped by our own devices in technological decay. Your god wont save you no use to pray. Take advantage of what your given and just live for each day.
