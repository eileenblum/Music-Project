Specs of dust we are all specs of dust in the scheme of the universe yet we think the world revolves around us. We all need to wake up and realize that we donât matter x2 This planet has been here long before us. We have destroyed all thatâs precious on it. Vile creatures consuming all the resources there will be no place left to go once we destroy our own home. When will we stop? What is the goal of the human race? Why are we so selfish? Destroying all the habitats. This is our greatest sin. Destroying where we live. There is no turning back. No reversal of fortune. I have seen all the evils dreamed. Our extinction is the only way. For our planet To be saved. Specs of dust we are all specs of dust in the scheme of the universe yet we think the world revolves around us. The ultimate hypocrites Kiss your ass good bye and check the time. We have reached our expiration date. Weâve become our own downfall we have sealed our own fate.
