Wind up dolls. Let's all smile and greet each other. Why is everybody so afraid to say anything that's real? Quit playing your part and say what's on your mind. Is there any substance out there? Can anyone spark interest in me? What if you quit doing what you were told, and took a step out of line. Following only your instincts. What are morals anyway? What if the thoughts in your head, were made visible to everyone, would they like what they see? I have taken pride in being only myself no matter the situation. When everything is right in front of you you'll see a new world before your eyes x2. I will always be who I am today. I refuse to change because it is the social norm. I live my life by my own rules.
