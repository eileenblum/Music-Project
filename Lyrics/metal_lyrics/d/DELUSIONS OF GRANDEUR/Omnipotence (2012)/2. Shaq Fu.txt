I just wanna bury my head so I can't even see. All these nightmares that have become reality. The line between real and fake is now blurred. Absolute truths seem so absurd. Pick myself up off of this filthy floor. Take life's beating and come back for more and more. I'm growing weary of all these excuses we all have our cuts scrapes scars and bruises. I might bend but this world will never break me. All my demons pull but they could never overtake me. Free will is a gift you don't know how to use until you fight for it. Everyone thinks they're so fucking complicated but we are all the same and vastly overrated. Ohhh I'm so tired let me collapse so many mistakes but no relapse. We are all headed for the same place. These dreams are fleeting to catch them we must chase.
