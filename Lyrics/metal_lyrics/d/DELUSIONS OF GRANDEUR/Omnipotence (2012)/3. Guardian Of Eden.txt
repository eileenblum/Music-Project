Aimlessly they all fall into line. They have no purpose they keep eating the lies. Helpless drones without any thoughts of their own. Eyes open yet they still seem to sleep. Wake up I yell right in their faces, expressionless my words fall on deaf ears. This epidemic has gone on far too long. Copies of copies our species is doomed to lose all originality. How do they live the life that they lead. (the life that they lead) never thinking to question anything. Everyday they same mundane tasks (same mundane tasks) Creating routines to trick themselves their happy. Like sheep they gather in their flocks. Never breaking away from the herd. Lemmings marching towards their own demise. Robots pre programmed with simple commands. Slaves to a bankrupt government. You became their property once your parents signed your birth certificate. Ignorance is bliss is the motto that rings out. Why not join them and this battle now. I refuse to. (i refuse to) Play my part (play my part) For society. Choosing not to conform to others ideals. Following no footsteps and being the first to walk where no one has is priceless. I could never go back once seeing the truth. Unplugged and aware of the misery. But this life has value and that's enough for me. Being alive is better than just living.
