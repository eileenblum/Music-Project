Taking deep breaths to clear my mind x2 My eyes are closed and at once I am floating up and out of my body towards the astral planes I'm looking down at myself and I wonder how I got here eyes searching for the silver cord to get back to where I belong but I'm tempted to stay and leave it all. So tempted to stay and leave it behind Any world I can think of I can go to on a whim x2 My will is my desire too My will Projecting in a place I have never seen before. Pushing farther than I have ever been. Time has no meaning here and anything is possible. Other travelers tell tales of journeys planned and their faces swirl out of focus as i climb. One final dive bomb back to my lifeless vessel. This hell. Waking up to find I am still trapped in this world. Pinned down by this lifeless body. I am trapped in this chair.
