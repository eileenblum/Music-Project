This world is abandoned, no gods smile down on us.
We've betrayed our origins discard your material lust.
I kneel for no man I am my own master.
Realize your potential, we have everything we need.

Unlock what's been there all along.

There are those in power that fear what were capable of
Once we realize the hidden secret
That we are more than mere mortals
Destined for a greater future because
We are all gods trapped on this planet
Repeating cycles until we learn all the lessons
Needed to move on and ascend to the point of the universes birth.

We can change our reality it is our destiny.
