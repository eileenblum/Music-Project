This way of life cannot last.
Conversations are a thing of the past.
Reality is easy to forget
When you're someone else on the Internet.

Like uhm so what's up?
Being bored nothing much.
What do you expect
When people talk just how they text?

Life wasn't meant to be seen
Behind your computer screen.
I need a new stimulation
Everyone's minds on vacation.

There's one problem I just can't ignore
We are on this earth for so much more.
Than hiding behind a roof four walls and a door
We were made to invent adventure and explore.

Imagine all that you could do and see if you just turned off your TV.
Imagine all that you could do and see if you just turned off your TV.
TURN OFF YOUR FUCKING TV TURN OFF YOUR FUCKING TV.

Everyone feels so out of place
When they try to talk face to face.
Reality is easy to forget
When you're someone else on the Internet.
