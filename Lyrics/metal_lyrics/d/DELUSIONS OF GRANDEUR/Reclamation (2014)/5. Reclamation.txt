We have the power it's all in our hands
Stand up tall and make our demands.
Reclamation the time is now
I'd rather die than be their cow.
They divided us to always be sure
We'd never realize we are the cure.
To all of the problems that they've manufactured
We are all one race but somehow got fractured.

They view us as cattle
Will you be prepared for this final battle?

We will never be free
Until the citizens of earth unite globally.
Then you all will see
That we can coexist happily.
We pay their salaries
While they commit atrocities.
Destroying all economies
Neglecting broken families.

How can we sit idly
By allowing so many of our own to die.
Defending our humanity
Is our greatest responsibility.

We took back our power reclaimed our lands
Now every last human understands.
All of the lies that we were told
To mask how our lives were being controlled.
A greater threat than all natural disasters
We've purged the earth from our evil masters.
No need to hide no need to run
We're all connected we are all
One.
