[feat. Dan Watson / Dave Simonich]Spineless felons no means grief stricken and crushed dreams. Inflated egos mindless fiends crumbling pillars and rotting beams.

BLEEHH

The product of a broken culture driven by a consuming greed.
Our only purpose is to acquire all these things we do not need.

The human race a malignant disease bringing earth to its knees. Antennas and towers in place of the trees, of the trees.

We are the reason entire species have gone extinct.
The reason some people have nothing to eat or drink.
It's time to make a change before it's all to fucking late.
It seems we were born to destroy as much as we were to create.

A product of a broken culture
Extinction lies in our hands (in our hands)
The sands of time are progressively falling
We are the fucking disease.
We all live in corruption
we feast until we bleed.
Harvesting the death of our land.
We are the annihilation of man.

Nations of fools
Generations dumbed down in schools
Billions enslaved money rules
Billions enslaved money rules.
