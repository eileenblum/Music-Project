Liner notes:
âThe concept album âANNAâ is another personal statement against political and religious fanaticism, the influencing, persecution and oppression of free thinking.
I detest the dullness of blind obedience, opportunism and the dead-hearted executing of commands.
But what Anna hears, sees and feels, is content. Her way is representative of thousands of lowbrow children of her time, also for uncountable war children of past, present and future periods - no matter what origin!
