[feat. Daniela Laube]So here you stand â the wolf eyed ghost 
Separate ways â only seconds decide it 
The black ones face is petrified 
Solely one finger still reigns at this place 
Don't look over - the trees are liars 
They can not really absolve you from your guilt 

Left â you should go â right â the moribund path 
Now feel one last time the warmth of her blood 

Blood â the blood of your mothers heart 
It runs through your hands now 

Now it is time to accept the gift 
Grant the timber to pass through your white skin 
One last song before the dark king receive them - alone 

By weeping soaked trees 
Your siblings â they wait 

It's just the pain of your own despair 
I know it's hard to see this faceless ones 
But how strong is the will to survive 
When everything is nothing but dust 
And your first leaves have fallen - 
Only then judge 

Up in the sky â the birds â as souls which fly away 
Now the crying has ceased â the smoke can't deny 
It was not a lie
