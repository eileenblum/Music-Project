[feat. Ed Warby of Hail Of Bullets, Ayreon, The 11th Hour]truth seems like a child of blind faith
the dead inside â she scowls and rapes reality
the old eyes â cold

but the truth is just a slave of what we deny
this truth â the roots in deep mire
since eons sold

a wound in mind's desire
our own despair

she's lying in wait in our hands
but who decides when lying ends

mother betrayal
face of denial
impenetrable
nothing more than a frozen wish

the ice of clarity breaks
obscuring veins decline our fragile view
of what we pretend

the truth â this great illusion
say â who defines it

to recognize what's real or wrong
an uneven way â endlessly long

the truth â a frozen wish
