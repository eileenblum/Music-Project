[feat. Kris Clayton of Camel Of Doom &amp; Uwe Reinholz of Oak Ridge]the rising sun draws the mist back into the air
followed by the stench of the starved ones
the last withering leaves will now fall down from the trees
they have already resigned

soon the machinery is stopped and faced her end
but the beast eats until the downfall

mania â ornament of mankind
it's solely your race which delights in suffering
sin â a term but not a burden

the journey ends here
also my end is near
you are stronger than I thought
a spirit I can't hold

break away â I give you free â you're free

they can hear the thunder of the oncoming guns
it can't be undone â but they'll loose the crown
