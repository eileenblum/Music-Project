The noise of these voices 
Some know where to go 
What's coming is in their eyes 
A disillusioning glow 
The insistence of the gathered crowd 
Shows nothing but the truth 
The roar of this scorpions 
You shall understand soon 
It's time to internalize how threatening it is 
The right to existence is blazing in flames 
Depersonaized faces distorted by fear 
The light turns turbid now â but you have to bear it 

The fire of this surrealistic scenery 
Is nourished as long as the panic prevails 
The stench of the wooden planks - you know what it means 
This train runs straight to a hell - child 
Some of them lament the truth 

Soon you will have lost all your senses 

Do you see how weak the flesh is 
If it has to withstand the loss and the mourning 

Grace is given to you - branch 
Don't lose the faith in yourself 
Keep my leaf rich face in your mind 
Look for a place to put down new roots 

Wrath - as a tremendous thunderstorm 
Time stands still 
Let me be the cradle of your thoughts 
Thou shalt be my sun
