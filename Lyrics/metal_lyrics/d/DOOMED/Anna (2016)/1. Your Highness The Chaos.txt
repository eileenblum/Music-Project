[feat. Markus Hartung of Panzerkreuzer]I'm the howl inside your veins
force which frees you from your chains
inhale his last breath out â feel me
chaos â highness â majesty

listen â all your unborn thoughts are my words
voices â the vanguards of a new world
leaves â I'm the deep sough in your blood
your highness â chaos â king and god

you know me â but never knew
that I've always grown in you

give me your light and let me devour
all your doubts â let taste me your sorrow
the sunrise regrets another childhoods dead

look â this mirrors unseen face
now let your senses find their ways

hide the being a child in haze
frowning are your eyes â yet ablaze
the time is frozen in your hand
behind this door is reality â now you can try to withstand

all that comes from deep inside
trust in my â become my bride

look at me â you know who I am
return back to where it all began
leave yourself â become a tree
a guardian of the majesty

ligneous â as the lungs that we sowed
branches â the bark begins to grow
bony â like all our arms and feet
your highness â chaos â king â the seed
