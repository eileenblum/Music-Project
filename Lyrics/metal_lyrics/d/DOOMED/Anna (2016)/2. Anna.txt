how many times have you cared for me
all your worries you trust me
each of my leaves bear a sliver of your soul
I want you to guard you forever
sincerity â love and caring
all your secrets
you should be strong and never be broken
what we have will never taken from us
just give me your hands
I'll give all my branches to you
let us become one
it's not only my voices calling to you
they'll try to cheat you
they will try to cheat â they will try it

changed â the sunset wearing grotesque clothes
bloodshot â the red of his glow is shrouded in fear
beware of the black ones â they are wicket
wicket they are
they want to break your will â but you have the bark

the farewell has begun
the shadows will eat the sun
you're small but the chosen child
your facade â it hides more behind
