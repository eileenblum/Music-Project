how can I make undone
my thoughts
can I clean my conscience
with words

I thought I can protect
my face
but there are some mistakes
in haze

my own abyss calls
the last breath
an unending fall
slow and deep

I stand in front of me
I'm seared
a haunted stick figure
in fear

my own abyss calls
I can't stay
I know that I will brought
one day
