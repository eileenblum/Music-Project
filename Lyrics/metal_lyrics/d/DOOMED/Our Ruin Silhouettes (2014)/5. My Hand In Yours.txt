lying in wait
can't escape your closed eyes
my hand in yours
I'm not waiting in vain

our band â so strong
because it grew
living banishment of hate
your way was always mine

calm â I am here - it is all good
relax
just a small gasp - I will hold you
let it be
yes I'm staying
still stay here for a while
just trust me

memories of all the beautiful, clear days
how often I felt sick
when you were not there

now... but now it's cold

quiet thought:
your journey begins now
don't be afraid - we'll not lose us
like an ever flowing stream
I've not the strength to stop him

he stands in front of me
I have to let him be
now you're gone
you've done everything right

so it must feel
when the sun never shines again
but also my time will run
so I say one last time

my hand in yours
it is like my own death
from my heart - you'll never go
until I make my last breath

someday â I'll stay with you again
someday
