hatred â last bleeding of my creed
hangman - the faceless justice king
reap me - you have my deepest trust
commit me to the other side

restless circling my thoughts around
strength is not for the secrecy
ideas are always the birth of a whole

to have done the right thing
I believe in
that it always could be so
is what I'm feeling

all the soft green, how warm the sun is
throughout this peaceful sound
the smell of straw and the breath
and I will never overcome
it makes no sense to weep

door lock - so my journey begins
chained dogs
with contemptuous glance
haste - now it is not far off
I spit on you - so be it so â the end of all
so let it fall
