all that remains
is the sinking feeling
that nothing will change
all that remains
is that our souls leave their mark
what remains

carved in stone
our hand prints
the demise of the race
self inflicted
lost crusades
end of all lessons
dust in the minds
what's left of us

all that remains
is the will to survive
but we can't withstand

these black holes
mud and burnt soil
they reflect the eyes of the ignorant
whose death
just a drop in the bucket
deep furrows
not overcome

all that remains
is the will to survive
but we can't withstand
all that remains
is the paradox of our being
what remains
