worn fragments of evermore
realm - belonging to me alone
form new stones from what I give you
black as pitch, noble, with a seductive shine

come dream, come back to me
enclose all my thoughts - let me be

down there in a hole sits a little crooked
it looks like glass, only his head moves
I think it comes closer to me
but it is growing and growing
rapidly

it grows and flows
it seeks and bleeds
it grabs me

grotesque creature that you are
wearing faces that I know
you â dream - I think you've changed
something in my world seems to be stained

whenever I fall asleep
I hear his steps like my pulse
the beast that makes me float up
a goat

step - step - horned shade
step - step - goat head
step - step - green mate
next to my bed

go dream, you're not mine
go away
you've changed
let me be me
