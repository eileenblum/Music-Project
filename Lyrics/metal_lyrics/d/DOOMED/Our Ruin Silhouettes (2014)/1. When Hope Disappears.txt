chaos behind us - will reach us - will find us
we can't hide

fate is on the rise - thriving age of the progress
but the black heritage makes our insides homeless

we're all not high born but the death is summoned
our attitude is worn - still alive
but no one has won

we should show all our strength
what we will leave that will thrive
but a whole field of ergot should be burned

the greed dominates - leaders are obsolete
aimless wandering - the lot of our being

we're all not high born, but death is summoned
our attitude is worn - still alive
but no one has won

we are â when hope disappears - we are
when hope disappears - stay here - hope

chaos behind us - the truth will reach us
despair hunting us - consequence will find us

but we're still alive
