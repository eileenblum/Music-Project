voice of the wicked
now sound the last words of you leaders
who tortured the past
the whetted knife are now behind your necks
now it is too late to flee yet
deceptive silence - the calm before the storm
too many wars you have already won
the tables have turned now
and you will atone
we will tear down everything
stone by stone

so rise â no matter how old
the resistance enraged bolt
will smash everything they told
now let the hate flow
arise together now in brotherhood
destroy the sins of the dark brood
you will no longer loot
you broke a hornet's nest of hope

revolt

as the son held his bleeding mother in his arms
you gave a shit about it - and you took them all
the wounds of every individual are a whole
something you can never make amends
your downfall

arise all
