this is a giant war
the roahr of guns - near and far
this is only moral rot
guts collapse by one shot

truthfully burden
so many losses to bear
it hurts forever
we still have so much to fear

this is a giant war
the roahr of guns - near and far
this is only moral rot
guts collapse by one shot

Prophecy / Destiny

no time for peace - no hope
eternal war on the whole globe
if you make your final breath
even so what you see you should believe
