i swallow the sun
i`m from the beginning of time
now all hope is gone
there'll never be another dawn

it has begun
what have we done
he swallows the sun
he's eating the dawn

sun eater
sun eater

now thats the revange
i'll everything change to my favour
and your light will fade
no mercy. now it is too late

you've done things that were not justified
you did not care that my children died
i prayed, asked you so many times
you gave no heed to my suffering...now you lost!

so die! i'll simply crush you
die! i'll swallow the whole sun
die! i will destroy you
so die! you've forfeited your life

sun eater
sun eater
