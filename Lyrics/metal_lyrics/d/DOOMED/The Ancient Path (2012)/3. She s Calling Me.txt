raw, roaring, with angry breath
the sea is calling me to herself
i ignored her signs
now i shoud be destroyed
lifelong suffer, dreadfull damnation
she is calling me

hear the wrecked sea
now she's calling me
she wants me to pay back
by nautical rack

north - south - east - west

goodes of the tides, ebb and flow
escort him to his end
now i will show you what it means to deceive me

goddes of the tides
goddes of the tides
