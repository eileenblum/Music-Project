[additional vocals by Anny Bauermeister]I'm "climbing" up "the monument"
"Everlasting - disgusting - frustrating
All hating
Disturbing - reflecting and damning
Monument
I'm passing our success - so glorious
The haughtiness
Grimaces of races - creations of nations
The stations of insane"
The summit - I can't reach him
He's growing
They "cheat" - they "bleed" - they "puke"
And they "spit"
"Too bold - too hard to understand"
I give a fuck
Their presumption over the others
"I'm tired of"

CD side notes:
"My protest against warmongers, against all despisers of life in any form,
against speciecism, racism and the suppression of defenseless,
against all religious and political fanatics no matter what orientation,
against decadence and reckless self-enrichment,
against the arrogance and the subjugation of free thought,
my protest against the superficiality of hordes of writers and non-tellers
...so much more...
knowingly that the fat cats, leaders and beneficiaries will never hear this...
but one day they will hear the voice of those who receive these words
and spit them on their feet.
There is no amen."
