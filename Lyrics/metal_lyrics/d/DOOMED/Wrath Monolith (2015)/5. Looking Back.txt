[additional vocals by Johan Ericson of Doom:VS/Draconian and Ed Warby of Hail Of Bullets/The 11th Hour]"Behind closed doors a closed mind
Colored our thoughts in blood red
With bleary but burning eyes"

The blast of a repressed ego becomes a curse
The guard is now a threat
In our children's world

A completely torn and drowned heart of a broken
Made of a stone
Uncontrolled and like a rabid dog
A veil of contempt covered his own stop

"Calm and cold - without sun
The kindness is gone
We fell down - still do it
Blank and out of you hands
The belief in your strength - we lose him
Still do it"

The cradle helpless but longing peek
There was surrender but no escape

All hope disordered
The love was slaughtered
Emotions murdered
And it does still hurt
"The shadows of our lives banalities
Does not erase the thoughts of these old days" it chases us

âOld - a fragile despot
His own world god
We felt abandoned - still do it
Blank and out of his hands
The belief in his strength remains
Closed to us forever"
