Our greatness shadows have all marked lines
They are diverse
Unmistakable signs
Ideas of victory
All golden shots
A stone hierarchy which is drenched in blood

The flesh becomes machine
Life is resource

Our ruin silhouettes

The truncated mass gets scum as food
The sunset promises the slaves no good

The deeds leave traces and stinking wounds
Seed thrives above the head
Not on the ground
The fat cats masturbate their spitting dicks
And in the midst of their greed they just stay slick

Life became a machine
A self-killing force

Our ruin silhouettes
