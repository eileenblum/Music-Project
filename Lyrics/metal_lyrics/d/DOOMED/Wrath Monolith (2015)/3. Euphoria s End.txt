[additional vocals by Stanislav Govorukha of Suffer Yourself]"Bound hands proclaim the laws of arrogance
Total war is already available
As a vaccination
But the poetry of suggestion
Has its beginning by far not only
On the right edge of the sheet
How many paradise are still promised you
The lowest instinct burns confidence
He leveled it
Since the beginning of time"

Impotence will entice the brainless
To recurrent missteps
As long as the leader shows the way
The harvest will be a crop failure

"The temples do not serve the people
They are monuments of coordination
Individualism is a cancer in the head of the ruling
But with the help of the word it heals itself
The clocks run backwards
To stop this world mean to do the same
The sacrifice of life as defense of honor
Just soulless tools they are"

It seems as if a nation can not exist in free thoughts
The lynch mob grows faster than a dragon's heads grows back

Since eons this scourge grows
A constantly recurring phenomenon - like a cycle
Is that what you call normal
I refused this idea
All in me upends
Sometimes somehow helpless
But I will not loose my focus - never give up

Mother of our earth - where are you
Let knowledge shine in these eyes
I can't accept that this should be the truth
It tears me into thousands of pieces

We stand alone - euphoria's end next to us
Is all hope gone - the signs are not the hoped
Not a step we draw back
"This will not be our fight's end"
You will end here - your own beast
"You can't withstand"

"Nothing but ash should cover"
The path of this boil
"Freedom - arise and turn the blind to dust"
Grow up in new hope and stand here
"Your euphoria should end in doubt"
