I'm falling downward
I'm falling down

Downward...

The denial of all law
Something is changing
It could be war

Downward

I'm feeling lifeless and somehow worn
In a fateful moment I have sworn
The chill of this silence - but I hear the storm

The fear makes me tremble
I'm still alive?
The inevitable truth has now arrived

Slow, but no one can stop it
Know, it that it will unstoppable grow
The signs of this war are born
I wish I had never sworn
