A wall of your thrones
Revered heads and bones
It is mine alone
The crown

My origin is divine
My being is a sign
I touch the untouched
You watch

So strong is my will
To hunt and to kill
Kneel down in the light
Of my glory's blight

The strength of my horde
Can smash every word
And conscience-proof
They move

Thrones - your leaders bone
Fear is my seed
Under your feet
My treat

A wall of your thrones
Revered heads and bones
It is mine alone
The crown

I bathe in my own sin
I will wade into bloody lakes
I make myself immortal, and then
When everyone is enslaved
I shall reign a thousands of years

In the face of this wall
I will rule an crush you all
On you knees maggots folk
With you scum I will not talk

A wall of your thrones
Revered heads and bones
It is mine alone
The crown

My origin is divine
My being is a sign
I touch the untouched
You watch
