Drowned in blood is your god

Your words come too late
Your influence has faded
Ruined all your thoughts
I'll never be yours

Drowned in hate.. I'll not wait

The greed made you blind
I'll leave you behind
On fortune I'll pass
Your damn haughtiness

I'll search the giant roots
Until I've gone through my boots
I'll follow the old
And forget what you've told

And if it takes a hundred years
And if I have to suffer a thousand torments
To conquer the highest mountains and deepest rivers
I'll keep looking until I find him

The ancient path

The ancient path - way of the forebear
Far from the wrath everything becomes clear
Path

The truth I have found.
A dignified ground
But everything all that surrounds me
Is marked from gaping wounds
