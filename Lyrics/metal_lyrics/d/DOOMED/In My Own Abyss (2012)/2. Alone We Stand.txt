Forces of chaos
They'll never be stopped
Masses of conflicts
We are always alone
The alliance of mankind
Will never withstand

Only when we make war
On each other no more
We have a chance to survive
Only then we can stay alive

If this continues
We will never be able to hold
The hands of our children
And no on of us will be old

Alone we stand
Our obstinacy will doom us
Each for his own land
Alone we stand

Only when we make war
On each other no more
We have a chance to survive
Only then we can stay alive
