Slowly - everything is quiet
There seems to be gray
I can barely feel me
Restless I am

All feels so hollow
I am afraid to leave you

Has my journey began
But then, what happens then
Is all really done
What if I am gone

Do I go now
I can't let go

A warm white light and some
Deep voices told me: come

Now I've finally arrived
And everything is quiet
I have it hard won
And everything is done

Now I am gone
I left you I left you now
