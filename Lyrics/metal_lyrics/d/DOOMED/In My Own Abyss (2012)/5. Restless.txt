The agitation does
Not let me sleep
A constantly ticking clock
Deep inside of me

Everlasting thrust of thoughts
Eternal search for more

I can not stop
It moves in me
And lace my throat
I can't be free

I am a driven one
Always on hunt
And it grows steadily
By my own hand

Restless - everything flows
Restless - and my fear grows

Tinnitus torments me
I hate him fervently

I am a driven one
Always on hunt
And it grows steadily
By my own hand

Restless - I lose my mind
Unrest is all I find
Whoa

Restless - I lose my mind
Unrest is all I find
