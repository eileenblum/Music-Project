Beneath the rotting orchids
Buried in crimson she lies
Tragedy stole her future swiftly
A kiss from death stills her cries
Grief takes its toll on my heart
The pain of mourning denied
A reason to hate controls me
As my reason to live dies
Love raped and lost
But desire still yet bleeds
To take the life of those
Who stole her life from me
To solemnly eradicate those
Upon which my hatred feeds
'til passion guides my weakened mind
And I rest with the deceased
And sleep forever Whilst Eternity Burns
Stigmatized through archaic overture
'til the sunless dawn return
Phantom idols to which she died
Lay in ruin by my hand
As I sow the seeds of debility
Across this crippled graveland

Sorcerers of cessation
What have you done to her
Why did you take away her life
So that mine now must endure
Agony through emotions
Is the only thing I feel
Having to sacrifice myself
So I can know that this is real?

I dwindle within the vastness of emptiness
Its cold touch renders me senseless
Anger fills me more than sadness
A desire to kill rather than mourn
Overwhelms me entirely.
