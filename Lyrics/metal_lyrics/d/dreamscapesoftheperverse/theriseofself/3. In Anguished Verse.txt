I felt a change in this world
Where everything was damned
A sign of rebirth
Paradise found as I desert myself
From the walks of yesterday
To see beyond the horizon
I look to them - those who left behind
Their shattered dreams of life
Hoping to be saved
By someone stronger than myself

Why can't they feel the pain of dying?
Why can't they see me dying?

I reached for them - but I was left to die
I was deserted at the gates of the beyond
Forever imprisoned in my self
Lost among the forgotten shadows
In sight of immortality

So much has lust and narcissistic endeavors
Corrupted the soul
So much I've learned from them - the damned

Why can't they see they're dying?
Why can't they see you're dying?

No rest until I cleanse the world of living fallacy
Rage guide this incorrigible soul
To those who would abandon me
I am the sick I am the end
I am the plague which visits thee
Indocile hate breeds potent rage
As the dead declare war on humanity

For too long I've lain here in waiting
Waiting until now to strike!

The children of your sin
Shall burn in their beds
Those damned to be raised
Under the guise of your curse
Cruelly stricken from your lineage
Your progeny expunged
No tears taste sweeter
Than those wept In Anguished Verse
Under the domination of a forced regime
The noble in virtue will whore themselves to me
This dreadful seduction portrayed
In such tenebrous display
Innocence torn and lost so shamefully

I reached for them - but I was left to die
I was deserted at the gates of the beyond
Forever imprisoned in my self
Lost among the forgotten shadows
In sight of immortality
