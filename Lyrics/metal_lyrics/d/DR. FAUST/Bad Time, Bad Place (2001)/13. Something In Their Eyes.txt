Something Strange Around Me
Something Weird Inside Me
All These Men Who Talk To Me
All These Men Who Watch Me
Something In Their Eyes
Something In Their Walk
I Would Change My Number
I Would Change My Lock
They Wanna Take My Blood
They Wanna Take My Brain
They Gonna Give Me Suffer
They Gonna Give Me Pain
