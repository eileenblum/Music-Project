Show me the line between truth and lie
Take me to the inner circle of your mind
Inside the circle of power and glory
Don't try to get into the forbidden area
Don't lie-this way leads you to nowhere
Get into the inner circle of your fear
Inside the circle of making solutions
Don't try to change everything in your life
