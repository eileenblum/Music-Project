Look for the kill
Fear is your feast
Just wait for a stranger
It's showtime just do it
The whole world is a stage
All people are players
Innocent victims
Blood on your hands
We're all floating to here
Just come down in my world
I am a dancing clown
I'll show you who I am
No way out from here
Someone will tell you once
Confession of murder
Salvation in silent death
