Your, decision to make it slow and nice
You're a magician and you just move your eyes
Understanding is the way of life
Chasing shadows and you can't touch the sky
Walk alone and find the truth
Keep it warm just for me
Wait for the second coming
Lie for selfsalvation
Look for the carnal knowledge
Is destination of a sick person
Something strange-lost your mind control
Hopeless stage-never comin' back
