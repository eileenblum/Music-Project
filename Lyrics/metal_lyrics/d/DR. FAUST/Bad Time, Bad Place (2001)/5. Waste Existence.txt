Wake up from explanation
Rise from oblivion
Time will show where I was wrong
Next stop is the sanitarium
Madness coming
No one came from nowhere
Just you forgive me
If I never knew
How could you make it at all
But now the time has come
Waste existence is no excuse
That destination
Is just for you and me
