That the way it slow and easy
But it's not for you
Take the ride with wind and fire
So what you gonna do?
Empty eyes are full of madness
You're burning your mind 'till your blind
Race with the devil, race with the demons
Clean your soul 'till you shine
Opened doors to different times
But you're gonna stay at home
Friends and neighbors buy you drink
But you're gonna roam
Scary monsters of your mind
They gonna learn you fly
Everybody tells you "live"
But you gonna die
Save your soul, prey for me
Live fast, die slow
