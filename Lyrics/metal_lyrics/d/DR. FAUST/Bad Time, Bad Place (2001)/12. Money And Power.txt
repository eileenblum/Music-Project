Listen I'll tell you story
Don't go, or you'll be sorry
Power is what you want
Money is what you always need
There are different ways to reach the top
No remorse, no regrets
Reach the power and get the money
Listen to me and look around you
Many people of the world
Possessed by passions of gold
Save their souls and buy the power
But they'll have a final hour
Reach the power and get the money
Fuck the people and kill somebody
