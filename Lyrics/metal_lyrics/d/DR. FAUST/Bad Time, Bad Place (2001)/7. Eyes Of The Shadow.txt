Look through the magic mist
Can you see the eyes of the shadow?
Looking for an easy target
Playing with everyone
Dangerous and cold as ice
Bringing death to the living?
Look through the one thousand miles
Can you feel the eyes of the shadow?
Trying to tell you something
But lying in every word
Dealing with the devilS
Don't look in the eyes of the shadow
Look through the universe
Can you find the eyes of the shadow?
A helpless scream behind your window
Another victim fallen down
Don't you see? Now it's coming fast
Don't look in the eyes of the shadow
Mystery is scaring me
Magic light of insanity
Look through an eternity
Can you blind the eyes of the shadow
Fight with the creature of the night
Kill the monster from your nightmare
Don't give him a second chance
Don't look in these eyes of the shadow
