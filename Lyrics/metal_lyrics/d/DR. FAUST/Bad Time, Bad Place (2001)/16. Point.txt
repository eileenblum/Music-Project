Let me see the reason, let me get the point
Don't you feel the power hidden in your joint?
Show me a land of promises and take me to your dream
Close the gate of madness and let me hear your scream
Where is the end of your tortures?
How much time you can feel the pain?
What's the cause of your dementia?
When's the last time you seen the rain?
Evil forces try to make you're creep
The reign of shadows, the last point of your trip
