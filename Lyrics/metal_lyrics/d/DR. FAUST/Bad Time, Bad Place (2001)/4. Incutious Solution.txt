A way of life is what you need
Make your choice and take it now
Nightmares, illusions
Artificial stimulation
Of your imagination
Decisions, remembrance
Reminding of the past
And waiting for the future
Your destination written on the wall
Make something weird, let someone fall
Time to make solution you're got to be strong
Read this prescription and break down the bond
Master! Save me! Keep me! Don't forget me!
