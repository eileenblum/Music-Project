Open wide and say good night
Turn of the light and sleep well and tight
Say you will so how do you feel
After a kill on the hill
Civilized human being
Spends his life in sin
Sleeps in the filth and eats the shit
Walks around with the baseball beat
Say what you say and do what you do
Eat what you suck just give a fuck
