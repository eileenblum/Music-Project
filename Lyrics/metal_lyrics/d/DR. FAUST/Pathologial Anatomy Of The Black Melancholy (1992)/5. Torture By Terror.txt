Evil forces come into my world
Iron horses bring the men with swords
Twisted minds doesn't belive the words
Broken souls, suffer gives the hurts
Satan rules and human race will die
Power of fools changes the truth to die
Endless war outcome from your mind
Wicked law-livin' like a swine
Torture by terror-horror surround me
No way out from hell never break it's spell
Live in the shit walk this way all time
Rotten spit from crowd to your soul
Fear of death don't resist your fate
Stop your breath terror borns the hate
