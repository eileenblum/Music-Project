Demolition for the end of the world
Politician taken the sword
Tell me why-I'm asking my friend
Why am I dying? Red blood runs to sand

Demolition is result of the mind
Completition for the first is line
Accusation in all deadly sins
Incineration breaks losing and wins

World gone mad
Obscenity is norm
Earth is dead
Nothing except the harm

Demolition-suffer, pain and death
Information is deadly virus for health
Satan's comin' no way out to run
Civilization leads as to our graves
