Battlefield after action
Bloody dawn of fallen nation
Vulture's feast hellish harvest
This is a rotting of flesh
Cloud of ravens, clouds of flies
Food for worms, victims of hell
Corpses are silent, corpses are still
This is a rotting of flesh
Watch out-death is near
Look out-devil's here
Full moon is sinister omen
Howl of wolves is sigh of trouble ahead
Evil comes just like winter
People think that it's right
Violence for silence
Rotting of the flesh is rotting of soul
Stench of the death, fall in black hole
Violence for silence
