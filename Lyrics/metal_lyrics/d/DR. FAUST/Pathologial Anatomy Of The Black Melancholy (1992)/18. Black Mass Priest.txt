Turn your head and look around
Whole world getting worse
Try to listen for the sound
Hooves of flying horse

Mortal message from the Dark
Doom for dying now
He prays for death, he prays for war
Twist your mind around:
"Kill your brother, kill your friend
Life has not a happy end."
Black mass priest
"Throw the arrow to the crowd
Shoot to people let them shout"
Black mass priest

Who said that evil is dead?
Blurring by the blood
I reborn from million graves
Black mass priest for crowd

Tolling of the funeral bell
Resound for miles around
Pray for death, pray for war
Howl of devil's hound
