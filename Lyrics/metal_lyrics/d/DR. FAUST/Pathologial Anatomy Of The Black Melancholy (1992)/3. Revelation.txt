Murder, terror, rape, disgrace
Violence kills your livin' ways
Satan blessed your dirty deeds
Sold your soul for all you need
Gold and silver for the death
Smashong skulls for mortal breath
Fallen angel you came out from the hell
Desintegration is finish of the dwell
Make decision lay into the grave
No religion salvation in the brave
