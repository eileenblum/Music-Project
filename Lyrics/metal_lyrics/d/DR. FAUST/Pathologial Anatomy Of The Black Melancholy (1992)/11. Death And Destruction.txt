Wind of hate brings cloud of death
Violence rules the world
Human race becomes the beasts
People dies by the sword

Truth is lie and life is death
Murder is the way of life
Devil stands behind the door
This is end of light

Listen now just what I say: look around yourself
Can you see a lot of corpses that layin' everywhere
This is outcome of your work: you programmed to kill
Future vision in the dark
And never back to real

Only death an d destruction
Lie and corruption

Satan's curse for human race
No way out from hell
Claws of Devil keep your throat
You never break his spell
