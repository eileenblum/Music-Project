Devil sends the beast with wrath
To kill the human race
Darkest hour for planet Earth
God turns away his face

Souls of sinners burn in hell
It soon will be for all
Suffering becomes the norm
Pray for save my soul

Satan's wrath for planet Earth
No rebirth from distress
Malice wins and no escape
Angry hearts bring as death
