Sea of blood and hills of bones
Flyin' bullets and fallen bombs
Broken churches and slayed priests
No way out and no resist

Someone dies and someone kills
Someone cryin' shoot to thrill
Someone rising, someone falls
Someone hangs on gallows pole

Death came out from the sky
Pray for Lord 'canse you will die
Horror comin' with the night
Never know how do it right

Evil passion breaks my heart
Time has come just let it start
Are you ready start to pray?
Stop resist it's judgement day!
