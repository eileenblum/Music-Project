Overdose, an accident, invasion in your now spoke of mystic power.
Aliens, enemies
Warriors of death have terrible weapon
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From lord of darkness, master of destiny
Flight for your life, fight for your faith
Leave your dead brain, save your immortal soul
Just we say to people that evil never dies
Someone won't belive us, someone never tries
Deep into the grave lays rotten corpse
Sow the seeds of evil sacred call of gods
Suffer, misery, pain and disgrace wait you in future
Hunger, destruction, an awful pictures born in your mind
Who helps us? Who saves us?
We all sowed the seeds of evil
Ghost, nightmares take you far away.
You got no dance in the darkest hour zombies on the road
Leaves their empty graves.
Don't wait grace of god
Smell of death is near you feel it deadly warm
Time to die is coming, it's just calm before the storm
All we says: "Forgive us"
Lord, we have to live
Praying for the mercy
Save our souls, and forgive
Lucifer is waiting bloody sacrifice
Never get to the future
Never back to the past
You're got the right to live
You're got the right to die
You're got the right to kill
You're got the right survive
Meet me when the sunrise
Colored eastern skies
I'll give you indulgence
Then you may to die
From the rotten body
From the smashing skull
Arise the evil flowers
It's beginning of eternal fall
