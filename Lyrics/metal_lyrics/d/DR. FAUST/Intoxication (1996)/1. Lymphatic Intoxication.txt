Sick infection in your blood
Deadly virus kills your brain
Panic fear catches your throat
Your temperature rises, you burn in flame

Scare of death blows your mind
Pain and horror drive you mad
Finally your soul gonna out of body
And you absolutely dead

Legions of the death start their dirty work
This is a holy war between light and darkness
Lot of hungry worms start their scared feast
Reek and smell of death takes all space around

Many years ago you was just one cell
One cell in the your mother's womb
Now you're pile of dirty rotting cells
What's the point of that fuckin' life?

Anyway, let me tell you one word
Hopeless faith, blind illusion of grace of god
Black hearts, evil minds rule you know how
Sick people, death and problem #1 in world

Be careful struggling with temptations
Project yourself of sick infections
This is end of civilization
Just like Lymphatic Intoxication
