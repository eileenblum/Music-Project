Just another vision stands before my eyes
Distorted pile of metal death without disguise
Ripped flesh of human whole sea of blood
Picture of destruction you'll never see the light

One more glass of drink
Leads, you down to the grave
See it's coming from the dark
Angel of hell calls you now

Emptiness before you drunk's drive it's true
Break the low and order, never mind, it's cool
Just another vision, just another man
It's a kind of murder, don't you understand!
