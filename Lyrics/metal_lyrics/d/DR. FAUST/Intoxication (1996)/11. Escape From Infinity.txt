No place sweet like home
Everything just for you
Pain and pleasure, dimensions of soul
Truth of life is revelation of god
Death calls-you can't resist
Gates of hell your last resort...

[Chorus:]
If you try you can make it
Your last change is escape from infinity
Pilgrims path not an easy
Promised land not a Paradise...
Homicidal instinct way of life
Total elimination has no limit
Pathological anatomy of society
Black melancholy of relationship
