The endless road of emptiness
Is changing its course tomorrow
Almost unperceptible
Almost certain

The creature's insecure
Always hide their faces
Almost unbearable
They'll never know they're names

They faintly search for protection
The daily fear of the unreal
Always unbearable
They'll never know they're names

The creed for life will always burn
When they're falling in the shades

A stumbling man comes closer
His furrowed face is dead
He never reached any point
He never really tired

The man is passing by
Without reconizing anything
He doesn't care at all
And you'll never know his name

The creed for life will always burn
When they're falling in the shades
In the shades
The shades

I'm walking straight a head
"I'm not one of them"
How can I be so sure?
I didn't ever know my name

I'm creeping slowly forward
My hands are tied, my goal is long
Its unbearable
I never know there names

The creed for life will always burn
When they're falling in the shades
In the shades
The shades
In the shades
The creed for life will always burn
When they're falling in the shades
In the shades
Shades
