All the endless ways I walked along
But I never found someone at the end
All the dreadful dreams I dreamt
But I always woke up in the morning
To the headless and legless I went
But what did they want to tell me
In the water of a deep blue sea I swam
But I was not drowned

In the light of the fire on that place
I've seen that burning face
In the fire of that lightning place
I've seen my face, but I'm still alive

All the silly games I played with you
All attacks that I survived I don't care
And I stood on the top of the highest rocks
Never been so close to eternity
All the valleys of death - didn't try to avoid
But no sunbeam met my face again
As my body was ice it melted slow
But the night was cold, I'm Still Alive

In the light of the fire on that place
I've seen that burning face
In the fire of that lightning place
I've seen my face, but I'm still alive

In the light - of the fire -
I've seen a light - In the night -
In the light - of the fire -
I've seen my face
