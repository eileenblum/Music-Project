As I heard you've lost your game
I knew that today we'll make it real
I went everywhere to find you
And I can't forget how you called my name

And when the sun went down
I knew that there's no way to help you
When I begin to close my mind

As I reached the place where we met first
I thought you're standing there
As I tried to take your hand
The vision suddenly disappeared

And when the sun went down again
I felt you close behind me
And I began to close my mind

And here I've found you, innocent and sweet
You lie there in the street
Your eyes don't tell the lies anymore
The're full of bitter tears
Your hands cramped as they tried to
Pull you back to your unhappy life
Your mouth is opened wide
To speak the last words but there was no time...

Now we stand here side by side
And we're waiting for the next black night
You give me a smile and you say:
"Now we start our second life!"

And when the sunset comes
We kiss that bloody life good-bye
And we take off and fly away...
And here we've found us, innocent and sweet
We lie there in the street
Our eyes don't tell the lies anymore,
They're full of bitter tears
Our hands cramped as tried to
Pull us back to our unhappy lives
Our mouths are opened wide
To speak the last words but there was no time...
