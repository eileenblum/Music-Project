I remember I was standing
On a deep blue sea
And the girl beside me was crying
Her tears didn't wither in the sand
She just didn't want to hide them

Give me one good reason
to despise her now,
On her way
Give me one good reason
to be sorry for her now,
On her way

We heard an echo of a helpless voice
A child was screaming far, so far away
The girl beside me didn't move anymore
The waves drowned this little voice
