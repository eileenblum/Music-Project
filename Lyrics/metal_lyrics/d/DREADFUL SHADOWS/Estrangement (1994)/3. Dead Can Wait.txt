Mourn for existing, waiting for deliverance
The sky crashes down
The dead wait for a long time
The borders of your life were early programmed
You're just a piece, you have to run forever

You're dying but living
The dead can wait

Some night it could happen;
A dream will be reality
You stand there alone,
You don't want to wakeup
You didn't get - to die
You don't know how it is,
You never made it before

You're dying, but living,
The dead can wait
Dead can wait,
Our fantasy devoured ourselves...
