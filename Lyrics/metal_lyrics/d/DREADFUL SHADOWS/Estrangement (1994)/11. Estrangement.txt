The birds in the sky are the last,
Seeing the sun goes down
Before the world sinks in black light
As it's burnt it soars in the universe

Left of feelings and warmth
Only a cold wind stays
A wind devastating everything

A short view - and we fall in the eternity
Free of sorrows and fear
Free of pleasure and luck
Free and thrust out
Praying for another life
