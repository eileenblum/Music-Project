Forgotten people in the streets
Lonely eyes in the darkness
I wish you could find me
I think you won't me

Screaming words at the churchyard
The echoes fade away
I think you won't hear it
I wish you could hear this

If you want to find me,
Look for me at the other side of the mirror

See me sitting here
Waiting for the day to come
I'll come through the mirror
To be with you

Ask me boring questions
I'll answer you, but you won't hear me
Tell me stupid stories,
I'll listen to you but I'm to far away
