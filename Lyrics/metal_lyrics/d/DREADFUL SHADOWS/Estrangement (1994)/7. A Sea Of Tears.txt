I was walking through the streets
I saw, I saw so many lights
I saw so many people
Without a look in their faces

Come on to the sea
To the sea of tears

I went to where nothing else moved
I went to the sea of sadness
I went to where nothing else moved
I went to a sea of tears

There was a girl in a white dress
Her face did look so unhappy
Was she the queen of the night?
She had no voice to cry...
