A cold night - my breath turns into ice
The long track to this holy place starts now
The bright moon shines above the trees
I don't feel well,'cos it's me who dies

There's a funeral procession
There's a funeral procession in my mind
This is my funeral procession
There's a funeral procession in my mind

Now I'm there and I see these happy faces
There is just one girl what is crying
Now she perceives me and she comes to me
She touches my face, her fingers are cold

There's a funeral procession
There's a funeral procession in my mind
This is my funeral procession
There's a funeral procession in my mind

The girl in the black dress begins to shiver
She dies away in my arms
And her wide opened eyes stare to heaven
And her body slowly fell to a thousand pieces
