You are over the worst
Silence all around
Your dreams are shattered
Like the glass in your mouth
You are over the worst

It's without any importance
What the people say
As you ran away from here
You were alone on your way
You are over the worst

After your lonely fight
You don't know what's left or right
But come on, come on, come on
For a hope it's too late
You are over the worst...
