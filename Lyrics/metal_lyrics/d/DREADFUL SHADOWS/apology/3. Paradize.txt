I wander around without destination
I don't feel the cold anymore
Everything I start, ends in desperation
For how long I tried to reach the shore.

But now I fall, deep into the ocean
Go on, your way never ends
I won't light the stars, I shroud you in my darkness
Welcome to my own paradize.

The trees reveal the secrets they were hiding
The leaves don't dance anymore
Don't shed a tear, you were never lying
But much too late I understood.

So here I am, I will always wait here
I hear your footsteps fade away
I wave to you, but you can't see me
Maybe I'll see you never more...
