The leaves are drifting with the sunlight
Far away from here, like a ship into the void
The birds lapse into their last song
The final sounds die
And only dust remains on earth

No river will flow, no fire will burn - anymore
The wind has lost its power
Another piece of the universe is gone
Grey stones bury your will to live

Dusk

But now I stand here with my arms outstretched
Breathing clearest air
I've found everything I've lost before
And when I fall I fly in endless circles
Noone catches me, noone stops me anymore

Now the grey days are gone
And it's time to rest, to find myself
I was always searching for this
It's a kind of death, but you're not dead
