The lake lies silent there tonight
Not far from here
And the colours turn to black
Like a tear of tar - in your rigid eyes

I'm walking down the path to the rocks
Where we stared into the stars
I touch the water and I see your face
And your rigid eyes

One more time I see you die
There's no salvation
Something breaks you deep inside
It's the end of your dissolution

Suddenly a bright white veil is rising
Far above my head
Like an epitome of beauty I see a face
With your rigid eyes

Your glow is leading me to a place
So far beyond this world
I drift away, now I can see
Through your rigid eyes
