I've seen the rain in vales of a deeper joy
Don't mourn for me or my demise
I'll away until we've found our deliverance
The tears of your pain will melt the ice

I'll never see when you smile, when you're laughing
I'll never see when you cry all day
I fall asleep, but you still got my spirit
I'll always sleep until we meet again

I turn around and see your face for the last time
You think "good bye" but your lips are kept closed
I go away, 'cos my fate was programmed before
Eternity took place in me
