I can't drive my thoughts away
The depths of heaven haunt me
And I see no excuse for my mistakes

I'll never see the sun again
The clouds will darken everything inside
No way to get me out of this or to return

The wind will blow my face away
No love will last, just endless calm
Tomorrow is the strangest word for me

Soon I'll be forgotten
I'm drifting weightlessly in time, all alone
I was suffocated by your kiss, I'm buried again
