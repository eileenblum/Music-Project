I'm walking through our forest again
And I'm waiting for the sun
The crass is damp, the birds are dumb
They don't sing their melody
But I still know how it sounds

Now I'm sitting down at this stone
Where we were waiting for the day
The sun is cold and heaven's grey
It seems like yesterday
When I was at your grave

Where will I see you again
Hoping for coincidence
When will I kiss you again
Feeling no more alone

I watch the sun it passes by
I don't feel the heat anymore
'cos now you're gone
But I am buried deep beneath your feet
And I can't see tomorrow
