Another scorching day began to go
Another senseless day is over
And all the time we laughed and cried
And all the time we said nothing at all
At all

Too many scenes I never can forget
Too many dreams I never will get
And all the time my life was in your hands
And all the time your life was over

Regeneration's burning down
Regeneration's burn
Regeneration's burning down
Regeneration's burn

Its always been impossible to know
Its always been impossible to show
And all the time your life was in my hands
And all the time my life was over
