A strange request followed this call
For the darkening of every light, suffocation of every cry
Bells of death started to play
Depreciation of time, the explanation of lies

Drowning words can't promise delight
The years of secrecy are gone
Trembling hands call for a Lord
The inversion of time, the realization of lies

Burning the shrouds
Of your illuminated souls
It's the embers under our feet
The trails of blood lead me to your shrine
It fades away

Freezing blood under my skin
The futility of efforts, obedience subverts the reason
Words descend into a haze
The inversion of time, depreciation of lies

Burning the shrouds
Of your illuminated souls
It's the embers under our feet
The trails of blood lead me to your shrine
It fades away
