This is the day I've always been awaiting
A ray of sun comes into my room
The sleepless nights of former years are ending
And every day falls into a gloom

Where is the torment in my brain - it's so silent
Where is the screaming of my soul
I can't stand it anymore
I'm drowning

I'll be dancing with your soul - in our ancient way
I'll be kissing you today - and our hope is granted
Every minute I am wasting here is agonizing pain
Why should I hesitate to leave

I'm sick of escaping from that cold - I'm still running
The torn thoughts destroyed my mind
The emptiness causes fear and isolation
Transience seems to be a lie

I'll be dancing with your soul - in our ancient way
I'll be kissing you today - and our hope is granted
Every minute I am wasting here is agonizing pain
Why should I hesitate to leave
