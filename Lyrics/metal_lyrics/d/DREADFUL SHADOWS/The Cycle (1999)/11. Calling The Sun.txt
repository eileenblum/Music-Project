Another time I've tried to walk along this icy way
Another time I've lost my balance
When my eyes turned gray
Too many screams don't let me fall asleep
Too many dreams that I have buried deep inside

Calling the sun
My whole world collapsed last night
My star can't shine tonight

Another time I've tried to walk along this icy way
Another time I've lost my balance
When my eyes turned gray
Another day began to dawn in my mind
Another day without a sun to shine

Calling the sun
My whole world collapsed last night
My star can't shine tonight

All the things I ever knew
Seem to be without importance
For my intent for another start
Go away from here
Just go away from here
My sun might shine for you

Calling the sun
My whole world collapsed last night
My star can't shine tonight
