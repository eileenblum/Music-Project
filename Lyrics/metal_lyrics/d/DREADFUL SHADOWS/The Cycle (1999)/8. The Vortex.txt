The dust in your photograph
Reveals the time gone by
These days seem so far away
Why did I return

Your rooms didn't change a lot
But the things have lost your soul
Your scent was replaced by cold
Which is seized my body

The vortex was much too fast
But we weren't afraid of falling
The blindness of fatal dreams
Remains

The door opens and you're standing there
Your hair is wet from rain
You're looking scared and distraught
But you can't speak anymore

A window shutters and you laugh
Your face is so unreal
Your eyes reveal the senseless fight
You'll never escape

The vortex was much too fast
But we weren't afraid of falling
The blindness of fatal dreams
Remains
