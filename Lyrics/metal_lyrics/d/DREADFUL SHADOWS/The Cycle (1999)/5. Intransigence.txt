You're the guide to my tomorrow
You're the anchor of my heart but I can't follow
'Cos my bones will break apart
When I try to get up for another start
I will suffocate again

Leave me lying on your pillow
Dance with me until no morning ever comes
And my hair is turning gray
Like a dying leaf in autumn always fades
In a wilting garden

Intransigence of time
Another time I heard you calling,
But you are too far away
Intransigence of time
Another time I felt you breathing,
But you are too far away

In my dreams your face is burning
Your eyes reveal an everlasting fear
I try to take your hands
But when I almost touched them - they disappeared
All my hope is drowning

We drive the blade into our bodies
We'll be united 'til the end of our time
Even if our bodies part
And we're a 100,000 miles apart again
We'll always be together

Intransigence of time
Another time I heard you calling,
But you are too far away
Intransigence of time
Another time I felt you breathing,
But you are too far away

Another time I heard you calling
Another time I felt you breathing,
But you are too far away
