Breaking wood beneath my feet
I am standing on a fragile bridge
The abyss is indescribably deep

Only ledges could catch my fall
Something forces me to wait right here
I'd rather run away if I could

Seconds seem to be hours
These hollow beams are bent like blades of grass
They'd never have carried weight before

The railings are destroyed
I'm just a step away
Is this my life?
Is this my life?

Wherever I've gone
The end was always
The futility of delight
Whatever I've said
In my words was always
The futility of delight

Now the bridge is breaking apart
I cannot get a hold of anything
There's nothing within my reach at all

I'm falling weightlessly
Just a step too far
This is my life
This is my life

Wherever I've gone
The end was always
The futility of delight
Whatever I've said
In my words was always
The futility of delight
