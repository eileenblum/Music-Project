Contaminated ground beneath our feet
We're walking slowly but hand in hand
We don't care to stumble, we don't care to fall
We're too far away from earth

We don't feel our aching feet anymore
After years and years of running
The long road we covered seems to end right here
We're so close, but too far

There is something better
Something free and new
There's another home for the lost
Where our dreams come true

We're vagrants in space
We don't care about the dreams around us
Vagrants in space
We don't need deceitfulness to live

We have tried too long, we have died too long
We have cried too long at all
We believed too long, understood too long
Now our time has come

There is something better
Something free and new
There's another home for the lost
Where our dreams come true

We're vagrants in space
We don't care about the dreams around us
Vagrants in space
We don't need deceitfulness to live
