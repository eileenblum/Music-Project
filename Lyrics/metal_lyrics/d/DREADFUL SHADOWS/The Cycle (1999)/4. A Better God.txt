Your eyes reflect the surface of the water
Your lipstick is smeared
The reed moves quietly in the wind
And you alone with yourself
For the first time alone with yourself

You've always been waiting for that moment
To answer all your questions yourself
The shore at the edge of the world seems too far
And you drink the blood of life
And you vomit

God - give me another life
I'm praying for a better life
God - give me another life
I'm praying for a better life

The clouds merge to the image of your fate
Your faith belongs to no one anymore
You're blind 'cos you are dead
'Cos you were blind of trust
But your eyes are closed now
Forever

God - give me another life
I'm praying for a better life
God - give me another life
I'm praying for a better...

God - give me another life
I'm praying for a better life
God - give me another life
I'm praying for a better... god

A better god...
