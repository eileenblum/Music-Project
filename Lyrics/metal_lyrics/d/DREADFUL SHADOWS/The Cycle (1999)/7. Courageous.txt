Your wrinkled hands reveal the time
You can't stop anymore
The expression of you eyes is still courageous
Your lips are pale, your skin is white
I thought you'd never fall
You're lying motionless in bed

Courageous inside
Flies dance around the same old lie
I'm giving up your shape

Oh, I was startled by the words
You breathed in your despair
You've lost your trust in your own world - in living
In times when you were young and strong
You could embrace the world
You've been so fearless and so sure

Courageous inside
Flies dance around the same old lie
I'm giving up your shape

"But our dreaming was too far beyond reality
Another time we had to see - we are creeping worms in space
Too many disappointments made me disintegrate
I'm losing hold, losing control - and my world collapsed"

It seemed that life came back to you
Your eyes were blazing bright
Immortal power seized your body
I left you when you fell asleep
You wanted to be alone
And now I'm sitting next to you

You're still courageous inside
Flies dance around the same old lie
I'm giving up your shape

"Sometimes I'm burning in a fire of lies and agony
These waves will never subside and my world will disappear
I don't believe in human souls, I had to bury warmth
In endless fights against myself my world collapsed"
