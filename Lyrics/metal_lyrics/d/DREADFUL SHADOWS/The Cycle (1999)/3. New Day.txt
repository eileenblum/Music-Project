I walk along an endless path, it's the same as yesterday
Nothing's changed and nothing's evolved anywhere
Too many voices call your name
And my own is much too weak
To be heard, to be felt

And I'm dragged down the waterfall
Disarmed, defenseless

All the flowers are withered
And everything has turned to gray
The rain can't wash away my tears
Into the deepest marsh I falling
And my struggling only helps
To force my suffocation

And I'm dragged down the waterfall
Disarmed, defenseless

When I saw you for the last time
Your eyes were cold and dull
Why can't you stay with me forever
Why did you have to go
Oh, you were wilting much too fast
Your scars will never heal
I never knew how much I love you

Can I wake the dead
Can I cry if I could
Will the sun ever shine on you again
Can you see me lying here
Don't you see me hiding here
It's too deep, much too deep to cry

And I'm dragged down the waterfall
Disarmed, defenseless
