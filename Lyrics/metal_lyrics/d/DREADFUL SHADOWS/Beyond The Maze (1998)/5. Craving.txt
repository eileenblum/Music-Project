I walked along a boundless passage
It collapsed above my head
A cyclone sweeps me away
And avalanches plunge

A craving for delight - no remembrance
We're neither lost nor found

White walls hold me in chains
The axis got out of place
A child is dancing to the sound
Of detonating bombs

A craving for delight - no remembrance
We're neither lost nor found

A raging torrent pulls me down
And I don't attempt to hold my breath
The glass is shattering on the ground
It cuts into my skin, but no blood is pouring

A craving for delight - no remembrance
We're neither lost nor found

I see the children again
It smiles
It burns
