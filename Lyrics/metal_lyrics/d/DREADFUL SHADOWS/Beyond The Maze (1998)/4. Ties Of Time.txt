The rain soaks my apparels
The wind blow continuously, it's cold
A shelter is not visible
Protection seems to be out of reach

The severest way I had to go
The longest way I had to fall
Now all the ties are torn apart
I thought this is the end...

The moonlight is fragile
Like the coat of glass all around you
I often injured myself
The scars can not heal anymore

How often I collapsed when I desperately waited for a sign
All you ought to do was to free myself from my suffering and pain
Hopelessly I wander about in town
The scenes repeat time after time
I'm standing alone on the negative of the photograph of my life

Why is it only the worst I can feel?
Why can't I laugh and be glad, just like all of these fools?

The severest way I had to go
The longest way I had to fall
Now all the ties are torn apart
I thought this is the end...

The wind devastates all my thoughts - he can't blow them away
My eyelids are swollen, but what do I expect to see?
