Shades are rising above my head
Voices whisper a name
A coat of ice is covering me
A breath of decay drifts away

"The soil is your father, don't try to escape
Give in our will and awake"

Paralyzed by agony
When bones broke through my skin
My splintering skull was the last thing I felt
I leave my mortal remains

"A spiral of darkness will lead to your home
Open the gate to that world
The soil is your father, don't try to escape
Give in our will and awake"
