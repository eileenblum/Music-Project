The bare wall is damp, a layer of mould is covering every joint
The pipes are leaking, it's dripping onto my ragged bed
Minutes seem to be days and days are years, so what am I waiting for? Too many
things have changed, too many words have lost their sense
The days will be mine when rivers rise
But now I'm stumbling on the edge of our life
The last words to the drowning sun
The light was bright enough to believe
That we could lose ourselves in feelings, but we failed
The last words to the drowning sun

Today I reached the door with my last ounce of strength
It was like opening secret gates to another world
The first time I've seen the sun again, since you passed away
My life without you can't be a life - a waste of time

The days will be mine when rivers rise
But now I'm stumbling on the edge of our life
The last words to the drowning sun
The light was bright enough to believe
That we could lose ourselves in feelings, but we failed
The last words to the drowning sun
