It's a sea of thoughts where I will drown
The diary of my life is burnt
I can't pretend, can't drive your face away
Your intimate voice is dumb

I'll always see your wistful eyes
The tears you cried will never dry
Every word you said comes back again
Spread your wings and fly

Dance with my shade
Like the leaves in that stormy night you passed away

All my zest for life is gone
The scenes of yesterdays will never fade
Too many words are left unsaid
I'll spread my wings to be with you

Dance with my shade
Like the leaves in that stormy night you passed away
