The northern sky cries with tears of fire
Incinerating stoic apathies in a blaze
Towards perdition
Painfully futile to say this could have been stopped
Deserving, we pay the price in full
Our conflagration is here
Consuming everything we ever knew
Never thinking it could happen here
Cry wolf
No one will ever hear you out
Turn the tables
Our screams are not in vain
This too will pass
We will not be afraid
The fear weâve left behind
Together we will fight
Make this come to pass
We are fearless
And when the final hour is here
We will stand determined
But disregard a repeating past
Indifferent and blind
Wait for the end to come
Enter your demise
