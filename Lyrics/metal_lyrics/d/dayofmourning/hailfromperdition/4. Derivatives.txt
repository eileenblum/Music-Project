Each victory yields a new challenge
These actions become obsolete with very passing minute
The direction to reach some piece of mind
Grasping for some sort of stability in a world of derivatives
Or surrender to its fatal mark
You can never go back again (Derivatives)
So take your stance
Go hard or go home
These days make your life
Embrace what you have before itâs all gone
