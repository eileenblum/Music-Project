Weâve reached the point of no return
Itâs now or never
This may be the only chance we get
Leave behind provincial thoughts and mindlessness
How can we know until weâve really moved on?
The road to home wonât always be the same one
On this never ending journey
Lost in a mire of rhetoric and nostalgia
Fabricate the self-image, which wonât belong
Just give it all
Keep holding on
In the struggle for tomorrow
And if tomorrow never comes at least we have lived for today
Lived with no regrets
What can be expected from such long trajectory?
Gradually detached with every new day
Identity blurred, the side effects of a melting pot
Complete rejection, self-rejection
Every step
Moving Forward
Never looking back
