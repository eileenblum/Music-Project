I've lost myself in the cryptic abyss of delusion.
My empathy left behind, I reek of seclusion.
Eyes roll back, gaze in the mind of a recreant.
Search my wisdom for rationality.

A glimpse of impulse.
I only find my tortured self; demented being.
One last cleansing.
I seek for closure, not redemption.
This yearning for malice, self-loathing grief.

Let Hell be my sanctuary, home to my post-mortem psychotic schemes.
No more guilt, no more lies.
Exiled to find solace in my heresy.

This instinct for survival no longer sufficient.
Acceptance attained, an improper judgement.
Cursed with this sorrow, this agony my own.
An unforeseen epiphany to disown my soul.

Let Hell be my sanctuary, home to my post-mortem psychotic schemes.
No more guilt, no more lies.
Exiled to find solace in my heresy.
No longer weary, I bury the hatchet with this final life I take.
This noose around my neck, I too will meet my fate.

My convicted conscience has been longing release.
The thought of being dead; it now brings me peace.
These woes, this torment I can no longer bear.
Spiraling through the throes of despair.
Gasping for breath, my feet search for soil.
Straight to the nether world with nowhere to go.
Engulfed in flames, this bastard driven suicide will numb my pain away.
