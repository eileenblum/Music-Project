Deliver me!

As I seek for wisdom to rid me from this pain.
Pray the children that I have hindered will not die in vain.

Left astray of sanity, induction so profane.
Catalyst of cognition flowing through my veins.
Desecration fornication, slaughter inhumane.

I write my name in blood, for Heaven's door is shut.
A slice of flesh; eternal bond. An ill-forsaken treachery.

Disconcertion. Exhaustive reversal.
The devil's gift; embedded in me.
My sins forgiven; the slander, the cries.
Their severed limbs tearing the life out of me.

I've been to Hell and back; my bloodstained legacy lingers.
I urge for one last chance; enslaved for relentless carnage.

Lungs turned black.
Gone but not forgotten.
Plasma induced serenity.
An eerie presence shadows me.
I glance at death as I kneel for thee.

Mercy brings misery.
I bathe in the blood of the innocent.
I've sold my soul to the wretched and free.
My spiritless body takes a hold of me.

Violence is my demise.
Surrendered my guilt for eternity.
Graced by the hand of the devil.
My sins, they write themselves.

Mercy brings misery.
Violence is my demise.

Mercy brings misery.
I bathe in the blood of the innocent.
I've sold my soul to the wretched and free.
I glance at death as I kneel for thee.
