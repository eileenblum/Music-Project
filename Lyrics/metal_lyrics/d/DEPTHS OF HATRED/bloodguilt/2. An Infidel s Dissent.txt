Brought forth in apathy.
A flesh embedded innocence.
To beg forgiveness at the altar;
Victim left untold.

Probationary litigation, condemned for wrongful deed.
Sentence so prodigious, for which I cannot plea.

A shadow follows me as I take my final steps.
I try to reach oblivion before I'm put to rest.
The nature of sorrow yet to be exposed.
Torture based on my beliefs, I walk into unknown.

Black, death, the crow released.
The lucid calling of my suffering.
I cry for help but the noise locks out.
My fate at his fingers, my mouth sewn shut.

I've lived my life, swearing to no other.
Carved myself through the test of time, no purpose for a father.
No crutch to be believed in.
This wake in sanity, I realize, so bastardized, is all I ever needed.

Lay waste upon the king.
This cursed betrayal unlawfully transposed.
A broken, an empty, deceitful vow.
Won't bow down to the king that never was.

Death brings me to my knees.
Pray to false prophets in these times of need.
Lies turn to filth and dirt.
My hollow sin eating the rest of me.
A devious harbinger for an assemblage of fools.
Death brings me to my knees.
Pray to false prophets in these times of need.

Bleakness encircles my existence.
I bestow in blasphemy as he approaches.
Devour me as I fall to my knees.
Incapacitated for my wrongful, my wrongful deeds.
Apathy spreading like disease.

Black, death, the crow released.
The lucid calling of my suffering.
I cry for help but the noise locks out.
My fate at his fingers, my mouth sewn shut.
