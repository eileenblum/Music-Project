Embodiment of malice. Ruthless insurgence. Apotheosis of rage.
The anger inside me, eating at my flesh, consuming my mind.

One more nail for the cross.
I carry the weight but not a burden.
On this day of mourning, all I feel is hatred.

Suffer! Feel my pain! Witness the demons inside of me.
Conquer! All my fears begging for my deliverance.

Cast aside by fervor of hate, violence and greed.
No bargain for a treason.
A place where integrity is reduced to filth.
These scarce apologies wasted away.

Cursed with this blood thirst delusion.
Lucidity inanimate; inhumanity prevails.

Bring forth my fury upon this putrid planet.
To speak with vile tongue.
Contused beyond resolve, my reason has deceased.

These scars I inflict will triumph; these pleas will not suffice.
These cold dead hands have faltered. Constrained within your judgement.
As I remove the nails from an empty casket I sense a fragment of regret.
All this time I sought out my salvation, left with my own damnation.

Suffer! Feel my pain! Witness the demons inside of me.
Conquer! All my fears begging for my deliverance.
