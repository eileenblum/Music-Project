Seeking perfection through genitical mutation
this tremendous outbreak cannot be undone
the tyranny has already begun
siphoning flesh and blood for our majesty
our creation

this backward marathon of civilization
diminishing to Cro-Magnon state
devolution caused by elevation
sending us back to inception

we longed for our ideals
eugenic deformation,
evolution
gradually catching on.

consume your fate

relinquishment, abandonment
dethroned. a planetary breakdown.

Bring forth the leviathan
Bringer of your final demise
We have bred our own destruction
Oblivion has already been reached

We've created our maker
Our termination
