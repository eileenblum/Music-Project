Nefarious thoughts haunt me while I sleep, heinous reflections of vitality.
The madness inside me growing in exasperation.
A necessary evil, crucial surge of dismay.
Losing sight of existence, the terror devours all aspiration.
Deranged if indifferent, bottled up anger finding release.
Exonerate myself from these bitter thoughts; murder, torture, bloodshed.
Clenched fists liberating my hatred, mandatory violence aiding my deliverance.
Tear through the meaning of life, living for no purpose.
Constant struggle, day in, day out.
Everlasting sense of incompetence, failure and defeat.
There is no hope.
Chaos reigns over this world of darkness.
My pain is never ending.
Transgression constantly feeding my essence.
I am immortal.
