Birthed into a world of hatred, forever adverse.
The thorns are entwining, I feel no remorse.
Visions of carnage, suppress them I must.
Walking the drag, my life on the line.
Take a look around, disorder everywhere.
Horror feeding the mind, constant nag within the soul.
This life of mourning is merely discerning, wholly exposing new filth so vile.
Break through these shackles, my entity is jaded.
Forever flawed; there is no return.
The beast is unleashed I can no longer hide.
Repressed anger brought out the demons inside.
Spew forth the malice, behold my true wrath.
Shake as my wreckage tears all on my path.
Blinded by animosity; vision impaired.
Ignorance is bliss, cognizance a breach for an erratic being.
Fighting infinitum, the pendulum swings.
Open the floodgates to oblivion, unleash the evil within.
Boundlessly bit my serpent tongue.
Witness the scoundrelâs rebirth.
Lucifer! Lucifer! Prince of darkness, whole again.
Fear him for I have seen too much.
The beast is unleashed I can no longer hide.
Repressed anger; brought out the demons inside.
Spew forth the malice, behold my true wrath.
Shake as my wreckage tears all on my path.
