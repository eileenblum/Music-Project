The gates of hell have been unlocked; the devil unleashed.
His touch turns life to rot as he traverses our soil.
His venom spreads throughout the land, accelerated, disintegrating with every step.
His army transgresses; heedless, varmint, wreck!
Demented race of ruptured minds, fleeing sentience and sanity.
The globe is their salvation, unleashing an omnipresent havoc.
Profusion of suffering, propagating perdition.
Their burden upon us, fiending damnation. Infernal decay.
Eradication.
The earth goes up in flames.
I start to tremble as I witness his presence.
Cloud of minions in his shadow.
The flames arising, reaching the sky.
Their burden upon us, fiending damnation.
Infernal decay.
Eradication.
The earth goes up in flames.
All hell broke loose and the gates are closing behind them.
Our world has become the devilâs new home.
