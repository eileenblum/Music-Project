A celebration of abiding decay, fornicating reality.
Contagion expanding, ravaging the populace.
An inner rage of sloth.
Force-feeding the nation with debt, inflicting the bane of existence.
Beholders of wage with no deed pursued.
Occupying a stronghold of degradation.
The plague rises forth to conformity, sweeping the masses.
Crippled, diseased. Judgment so clouded, filth so pervasive.
Visceral acts have become so inept.
Withstanding prosperity; tarnished with misery.
Ill-disposed vermin crawling in waste.
Marching onward through the valley of fate; the precipice of death.
A throne built upon the destruction of prospect.
Near-dead bodies at the mouth of delusion.
Depriving embodiment; throw the herd to the wolves.
When corruption turns to aberration, the worriment ensues.
An illusion of abundance, hastily vanishing.
Sovereign encouraged stupefied state; veracious scum of the earth.
Starving for release; indisposed mindless youth.
Gorging obedience, absorbing riches, our vigor depleting.
Disfiguration, mutation, an alteration so vulgar.
Confined to malnourishment, the quandary arises.
A celebration of abiding decay, fornicating reality.
Contagion expanding, ravaging the populace.
An inner rage of sloth.
Our common demeanor has created inhuman disease.
Fear strikes the wicked as we become a new breed.
Swine for slaughter!
The human race not sane until they bleed.
