Ghostly remains scourge my lucidity; the past knocking at my door.
Knife in its hands, cursed is my blessing.
My being is damned.
Hostile advocates of righteousness, disciples of death.
Take me away from this treacherous life, this corrupted world of envy.
These once forgotten deeds, blocked out of my mind.
Orphaned thoughts creeping up past my demise.
Dying acts of displacement catching up with my former sins.
Arriving to serve justice; begging for empathy.
Abandoned rumination turns to sorrow.
Yearning for an alternate past.
Enforced into sin.
All of these demons inside head; once subsided, now arising.
Ascending through my evicted motives, near extinct but never neglected.
These once forgotten deeds, blocked out of my mind.
Orphaned thoughts creeping up past my demise.
Weâre all an incarnation of sin; born condemned.
Death is the only answer.
