Desolation leading to the obliteration of all reason. Devastating
the underground, the heavens and everything in between. Disgorging the
transcendent of humanity. Corroded intellect disordering the profundity we once
had. Ignorance decomposing the last of our morality. Disengage this endless
brutality. Paradoxal disfigurement, perpetual rounds for a pointless victory.
Just to say, just to prove. The foundation to this sovereignty of fear is
everlasting. Bring forth the soldiers of enigma, the army of putrefaction.
Salvage whatâs left; piles of rot. Weâve been ruined. Revocation is our only
savior.
