This horrid and broken reality will soon cease to falter.
Pursuing the road to eternity to be left with rupture and dissention. These
expectations meet exasperation. Mannerism has lead us to our insanity. Caught
in this vicious epoch of tradition; deception and resentment. These false
alliances serve no purpose. This logic yet to be unearthed. Becoming guilty by
association, to be blamed by affiliation. Limited indulgence; are you worth it?
Eternal ties; forever imprisoned. So be the judge and Iâll be the victim.
Exiled to the depths of my own moral. This fabricated entity is nothing but
delusion.
