Witness humanity's decline as we fade into the nothingness.
Consuming everything on our path, leaving behind nothing but desolation. We are
a self-destructive race, murders within the flesh. We are a contagious plague.
Breeding hatred into our world. Eradication of the masses, our evolution was
built upon failures. Drowning closer to the edge of extinction. Deprived of any
hope, a new era will begin. We are now facing the consequences of our
innocence. Embracing the end with contempt for this life. Restless and
suffocating, Iâm barely breathing.
