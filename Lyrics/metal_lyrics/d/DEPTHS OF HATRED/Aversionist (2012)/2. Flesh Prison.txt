This ministry we call hope is nothing but a fallen con. The
faith we put into society is foul and useless. False prophets predicting the
end of the world, feeding this surge of terror. Disambiguation of our fear; our
thoughts and our motives. Obsessed until exhaustion, single-minded till
self-destruction. Wrought into this tomb of conformity. Weâre doomed. We
breathe in pain and distress. This hell that we live in is nothing compared to
the grave weâre digging. The face of the earth will succumb to the wrath of its
gravity. Why are we struggling to preserve a world not worth living in and
breed life into death?
