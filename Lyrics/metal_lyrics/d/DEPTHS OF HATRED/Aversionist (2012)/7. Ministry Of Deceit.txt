Welcome to the world of the mislead, where one can scream
and never be heard (by a single lonesome soul). Our systems and conventions are
all fabrication of man's greed and malevolence. Juggernauts of our social
media, ministers of manufactured truth and lies. Keepers of all that's right or
wrong. They who possess the key to our entity. Masterminds of our futile
existence. Calculated deaths, twisting ends and ties. Woes exhibited through
delusion. Between walls slither the mutters of the unseen. Subconscious
manipulation of the mind. This unending plague of animosity. This turmoil can
be no longer. Overwrought, we have become. This is our time, this is upheaval.
This is a revolution. We will never be silenced, so long as we have a voice.
