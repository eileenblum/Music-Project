Harvesting the fuel of infection, death stands before us. Slaves
of the modern day, serving doom till our sentence. Wastelands of unwanted
supremacy. Rotting lairs of a scorn empire. Weâve been abandoned, been fooled
into perfecting the lives of The Few. Now theyâve vanished, and weâre left with
nothing but disgust. Behold the terror of dysfunction. Working our way to
honor, shaping our future. Dismantling our mindless efforts. We all believed
the myths, the fiction. Crumbling under the weight of absurdity. Weâve been
lead to being thoughtless and to live a life without thinking about or doubting
a single leader. Nowâs too late.
