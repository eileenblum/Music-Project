[lyrics : Noordin, Sankey]

Global group force intact information based arsenal modern context in conflict
Precision damage apocalypse of a new kind stealthing systematics achievement
Born virus (sequence of pattern unfolding a sacrifice for knowledge the history
Of crisis to come) conflicting forces have culture in warfare beyond lifeless
League of nations logic callous acts engage to break systems of judgement in
Rights ingenuities strategized chaos tearing at the soul of a nation new world
Fear hacking (resistance is futile) constructed logic based within discordance
Prototype world order systemized global heresy war in modern context rules of
Engagement tactics on line manufactured force lifeless defending warfare
Liberating hate opposition allied hope destroyed science of killing crucial co
Existing as we suspected bleak reflection wounded crucial networks of betrayal
Epic portrait of a new threat stealth revolution industry warlords regard to
Facts (industry frame work spreading throughout a cold concrete mass via the
Coded dialect of a symbol for a new conflict whilst a pre-occupied population
Of conditioned acceptees disregard awareness) hate revolution a systematic war
Of disease manufactured paranoia trepidation eroding through dissension of life
Non compliance torn no one immune untold infection generations are buried
Beneath stem of reason is bleeding from the veins that they cut in our minds
Conflicting forces have culture in warfare malicious hacking tactical defense
And logistics internal industry manufactured ingenuity strategized backwards
Independence infect to bury truth systematic global virus democratic myth
Internal damage rewind apathy adapted metaphoric allied cause of untold truth.
