[lyrics : Noordin, Sankey]

Panoramic view of sordid truth methods of compliance crisis engineering the
Science of backwards ethics navigated synergy anatomy of hate fuelled minds
Pioneering hidden factions intelligence killing empires infamous violent
Visions of enforcing manipulation of existence relentless influx of agendas
Scattered motives neglect out of focus deceiving legion cloaked in darkness
Shadows conceived in hate democratics corrupt elusive forces synergizing
Whispers remain syndication like the plague infected myriad of ulterior motives
Beneath an out of focus influx of neglect pivotal impact relentless misleading
Neutral legions beyond salvage statistics entangled in wreckage civilities
Clash expansion contradicts new ethics world ruin designed human raptors
Tearing kill unforgiving modern vision burning world in decline inner circle
Network hidden agendas embedded conflicting dark minds the new age of
Networking minds designed world of ethics in lies (security of allegiance
Anchored in the quartered percentages of industrialist expansion volatile
Tensions programmed to designs evading the constitution of a new age inept
Pattern syncopated to fold in on itself harrowing vision of the already extinct
The stigma of infamy growing with weakness to harvest descendants of contempt)
World in decline embedded conflicting vision whispers remain cold expansion in
Crisis killing all institution unforgiving sceptic coil network momentum
Deceiving constitutions pioneering visions will clash expansion divides visions
Of enforcing manipulation of existence relentless influx of agendas scattered
Motives human raptors tearing kill unforgiving modern vision burning world in
Decline inner circle network hidden agendas embedded conflicting dark minds the
New age of networking minds designed world of ethics in lies modern vision is
In decline wreckage within our hollow lives hidden.
