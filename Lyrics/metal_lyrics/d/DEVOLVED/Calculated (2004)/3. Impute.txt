[lyrics : Carpenter, Noordin]

Dissipate process of expression imputed construction failure contemplating
Obsecration subject manipulation structure of self in self not self borrowed
Mind embedded breach of life reconstructed inside exile dominant progressive
Internal disfigurement breed emulation parasite is engineered for human
Duplication imminent (progress to date contradicts our interpretation colliding
Unwillingly with a force transparent in state control is beyond ours) volition
Nearing extinction submission of inclination dominant inner modified reason an
Insufficient reaction consume existence self choice is all but gone sufficience
Inactive catalyst abolition feed on imperfections calculate all lies forge
Individual defection injection diseased insight to complicate measures in form
Confuse relate conditioning limit compacting the millions evolutions fall
Conspire retribution of broken illusions hate installed by stock projections
Septic vile subject pressure release content control.
