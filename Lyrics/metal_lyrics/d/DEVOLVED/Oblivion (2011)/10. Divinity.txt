The dust fills my hands
My bones ache
The last of my kind to see the light
What was once will never be again
I close my eyes
Laid to rest
One last final breath of humanity
Engrossed in the flames of devastation
Twisting
Turning
Our world suffers as our lives become no more than dirt
I am more than a memory
Functions falter our decadent survival
Artificial intelligence surpassing human knowledge
Redefining logic
Cerebrum transmutation digging to the vortex of the human psychological membrane
Horrifying torture releasing neurotic waves
Delve deep into our memory changing thought patterns into hatred
Clenching fist as our eyes held open to our existence fading into the dark
The sun burns my eyes
Fade into the light
Let my bones rest
Turns to grey
Weakened skies cast over the ruination
Decayed control slipping away
Unreal fate realized
Scanning shattered cities
Fragments of a past life terminated
Hopeless eyes are cold
Remember my name
Choke on the sand
Fill my lungs with death
Cleanse our souls
See the end
