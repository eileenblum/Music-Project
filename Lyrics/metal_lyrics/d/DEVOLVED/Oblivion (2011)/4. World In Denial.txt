World in denial
The system has taken control
This god that we obeyed
Nothing but a lie
Feeding on the fear
Prison of deceit and confusion
Blood of our demise
Human punishment
Kill without regret
Shadow of a world cold and silent
Battle within
Never ending
War is lost
No survival
Emptiness
Imminent
Reborn hell of the unliving
Ultimate fear breeding
Cry of mercy unheard
Prey on the weak
Merciless
Filth of the dead
All I see
Look into our eyes
Nothing left inside
Incapacitated
To spread your treacherous venomous disease
World in denial
The system has taken control
Born into fear and destruction
Generations infected waste away
Payback will bury you all
Exacting revenge on you all
Freedom lost in chaos
Religion of disorder
Survival
Non existent
One final act of hatred
This world is death
(This god that we obeyed. Nothing but a lie. Feeding on a fear of deceit and confusion. Killing without regret)
One last time to breath
Nothing left inside
Destiny has come
There's no place to hide
Buried and forgotten
Open up the vein
Inject me with your lies
Days of sorrow and pain will fill our lives
Ultimate fear breeding
Cry of mercy silent
World in denial
The system has taken control
Born into fear and destruction
Generations infected waste away
Killing the breath in you all
Refilling the grave with you all
Freedom lost in chaos
Religion of disorder
Survival non existent
One final act of hatred
This world is fucking death for all
God forsaken
Faces of the aftermath
Buried and forgotten
Inject me with your lies
Days of sorrow and pain will fill our lives
This world burning down
Revenge will be ours
