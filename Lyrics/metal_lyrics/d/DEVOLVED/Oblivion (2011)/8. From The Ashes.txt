System progress led us to warfare
Blackening dawn
Forge of the new day
Violent decadence
Feasting on the weakness
Parasitic activation certified to end the stock of mortal life
Puncture wound injection infected
Defilement
A race in crisis
Forgotten we will be erased from existence
Executed
Violation
Buried inside ourselves
Conflict with the structured frozen time
Carnal experiment
A harvest to deceive the blinded masses
Clenching as our depletion breaks control
Bleeding our computerized minds
Degenerate existence
The systematic legacy
Suffocated state of being
Breeding death
Kept alive
Breaking the systematic
Fall in line
Synchronized adaptation simulated
Marked for deletion
Annihilate the foundation
Burnt empty shell of ignorance
Suffer inflictions
Violated
No substance but what is lost
Clenching as our depletion breaks control
Feeding our computerized minds
In this life I am numb
Through these eyes I am nothing
(Degenerate existence. The systematic legacy becoming infected. Control of our own gone)
Arctic cyber mechanism programmed to engage
Helpless futile creation limited
Enforcement slaves calibrate assembled wars
No remorse as subjects cling to life
Degradation of human substance
Product of the infected
Slow to realize
Gone is the hopeful concept of irrelevance to this modern waste
World decay
Slow collapsing
Rise from the ashes to chaos
Defilement
A race in crisis
Forget that we will be erased from existence
Executed violation bred to instill corrupted violence outbreak
In this life I am still numb
Through these eyes I'm nothing
(Degenerate existence. The systematic legacy becoming infected. Control of our own gone. Degenerate existence. Infected control)
