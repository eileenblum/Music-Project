Our world is slowly evolving
Inside the oppressive state of conformity
Opposing threat confines us to this prison
Indulging deep into our senses
Waiting for our time to come
Cold dead lifeless method killing
Plan divide precise execution
Chaos unleashed on humanity
Science controlling prophecy
Deceit lies in the eyes of mankind
Kill to forge the manipulated
The fall disguised from the masses
Godless actions from soulless factions
The cold limitations simulated defined
Pervasive invasions of all levels of thought
Abstract silent field of consciousness
The mechanism of repression
Machine control
Loss of free existence
Outside of civilization
Opposition defiance of our nemesis
Underground conspiracy
Awakening
Dead lifeless eyes
All crimes have been linked to our advancement
Causing this neurotic state converging evidence
Pitting us against ourselves
We lie and think that we're all human
The pattern has been interrupted
Cold dead lifeless method killing
Plan divide precise execution
Chaos unleashed on humanity
Science controlling prophecy
A cold truth reveals out hollow souls
Lost world with no emotion
New religion to act on impulse
Godless command of instinct unleashed
Machine control
Loss of free existence
Outside of civilisation
Opposition
Defiance of our nemesis
Underground conspiracy
Awakening
Dead lifeless eyes
A new world religion contradicted
Divine modern belief in the science of our souls
Hopeless dead eyes fortified by time
The justification of immortality
