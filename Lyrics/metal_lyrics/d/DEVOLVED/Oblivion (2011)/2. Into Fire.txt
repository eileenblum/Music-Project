Wipe them out
All are damned to hell
All must suffer
Death will reign across your land
Never to breath again
Life ends in pain
Wipe them all out.
Prove that I'm your master
Put your son to death
Prove to me that I'm righteous
Look upon your city
Turn to dust
Fire falls from the sky
The walls have broken
Take the beatings
These eyes have bled
Turn against me
Forever be condemned
Burn it
Burn it
Burn it
Destroy all
Sin against mankind
Wicked world vanishing
All must adhere to these words
Centuries of violence passed down
Ancient texts altered
Ancient lives manipulated
Dispel reason
Ignore the truth
Read between the lines
Everything must be destroyed
Throw the book into fire
See the ink burn in flames
Throw the book into fire
Watch it all burn in flames
Burn it
Burn it
Burn it
Destroy
Bring upon the flood
Wash away what I have done
Killing all creation
The innocent will not be spared.
Turn against me
Forever be condemned
Throw the book into fire
See the ink burn in flames
Throw the book into fire
See the ink burn in flames
Throw the book into fire
See the ink burn in flames
Throw the book into fire
See the ink burn in flames
