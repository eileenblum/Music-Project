(We take on a faith that there is an accurate portrayal of the fine grained world which appears to exist in a realm beyond our natural senses. Released from the empathetic restraint of our knowledge that life us irreplaceable. The world system crumbles)

Archived and resurrected
Synthetic body transformed
Sensory data false
Pre-generating artificial logic from cognition
Instability evolving
Chasing breaking
Manifest inside
Change
Theoretical recollections falter
Complex systems integrated
Recognizing our limitations within
Now this soulless body dies
Disconnection of rejected life
Hatred binding recursive elements
Formulated existence
Our empathetic restraint
Further resistance annihilated
Generations collapse
Separate
Infinite simulations constructed in reality
All has turned to dust
Desolate wretched eyes
God redesigned
Disconnect all hope inside
Conscious of rejected life
Reborn into darkened skies
Now this soulless body dies
Disconnection of rejected life
Hatred binding recursive elements
Formulated existence
Darkened minds buried beneath the black
Tormented in depravity
Realization of irrelevance
End transmission of my existence
All has turned to dust
Desolate
Wretched eyes
God redesigned
Disconnect all hope inside
Black skies flood with darkness
Bright skies turns to dark
Then see the wretched eyes of god
See the wretched eyes of god
Bringing death into us all
Fear of death inside us all
See the wretched eyes of god
See the wretched eyes of god
