Reason
Submission
Impacting our creation
Aftermath has risen on this god forsaken reality
Pressure mounting
(Information database cross-linked to the pulse of the nation. Dominance. All there ever was is now nothing. End of life. Nations fall within)
Feeding lines to draw complacency
Set up the streams of communication
Humans spark dependency
Indulge the senses
Chaotic visions
Breaking the code and setting forth our infinite demise
Born into exiled history
Fields of bodies
Burning from the inside
Insignificant masses crawling backwards
Relentlessly torn inside
Manifestation
Procreation
Limited survival
Blinded
Sifting
Through the wreckage
Godless wasteland
Product of inception
Wasted life
Fragmented existence
Formulated infiltration
Evolution violently intruded
Lifeless
Blinded
Sifting through the wreckage
Godless wasteland
Product of inception
Wasted life
Fragmented existence
New age of conflict
Tap into that vein
Follow the bloodline straight to the mechanized heart
Intelligent dilated senses
Pulses rising
Beating to the death of the nation
Ascendancy
(All there was is now nothing. End of life. Nations fall within)
Breaching the surface of society
Shock waves blast human resistance
Humans spark conformity
The abandonment of limitations brings forth our infinite demise
All there was inside of me is erased
Violent evolution
Aftermath has risen
Information database
False visions
Infinite demise
Creation godless
Formulated infiltration blinded
Our intelligence by what we once controlled inside our minds
Contradicted
Fallen from the inside
Insignificant masses crawling backwards
Relentlessly torn inside
Manifestation
Procreation
Limited survival
Blinded
Sifting through the wreckage
Godless wasteland
Product of inception
Wasted life
Fragmented existence
Soulless
Bound by our existence
Feeding on the weakness
Infiltrate
Dominating forces
Tribulation
Voices calling out
