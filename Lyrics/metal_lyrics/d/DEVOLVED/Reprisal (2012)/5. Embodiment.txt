The state of humanity has changed
An irreversible shift has already begun
Time approaches when we are replaced as the dominant species
Only to become a drone of insignificant slaves

Overthrown without pity be self replicating machines
Created by our own hand for greed and control
Man's self destruction is the true embodiment of our own everlasting ruin

Buried alive at the gates of damnation
Human ashes rain down from above
Fragmented wasteland of our devastation
Only death, no god will return

Wretched
Self annihilation
Fear unbound
Crucified by all for evermore

The blood of ages
Is the embodiment of our fate
Through generations
We are the living disease

Infiltrated world of mass execration
Sympathy won't exist anymore
Life has been twisted beyond recognition
Open up this new hell on earth

Wretched
Self annihilation
Fear unbound
Crucified by all for evermore

[2x]
Worship the evil that we have created
Begging for a true messiah to come
Led to the fire with hope of salvation
Godless revenge out to kill all but none

Created by our own hand for greed and control
Man's self destruction
Crucified by all for evermore

The blood of ages
Is the embodiment of our fate
Through generations
We are the living disease

The blood of ages
Is our embodiment
The blood of ages
Is our embodiment

There is no god
