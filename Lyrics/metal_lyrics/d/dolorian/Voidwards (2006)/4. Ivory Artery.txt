Before me opens an ivory path that has no name,
Is this the crossing of everything, nothing
The further I proceed the less I am,
To see without seeing (...revealed only to closed eyes),
To do without doing (...backward-flowing / circulation),
To move without moving (...swallowed by the shrouded passage),
To be without being (..the heart is the fire),
Without beginning, without end, without past,
Without future nothing to look at, nothing to hear,
No-thing, only a vast space that has no limitations
Thoughts without language guide my roaming,
The seeker must seek,

I follow the ivory artery,
To cross the spiritual wasteland,
...Gaze reversed I touch the ultimate emptiness
...Revealed only to closed eyes
...Backward-flowing, circulation
...Swallowed by the shrouded passage
...The heart is the fire, to follow the feather-covered path that has no name, finally, to overcome
The limitations of time and space
Is this vision of no-limitations
Just another limited vision, from orgy of visions
To flowing direct awareness
