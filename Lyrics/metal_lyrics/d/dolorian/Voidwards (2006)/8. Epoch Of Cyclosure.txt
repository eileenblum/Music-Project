Behold, the skull-bearer -
The one who illuminates the sacred balance,
He has returned,
Black stars mark his way through the eons
Lie down and he will sever your ties,
His dance the movements that lack directional
Orientation, in trance
The intensity of ecstatic stimulation,
Immersed in frenzy
Submerge and feel the pure, unrestricted force,
Feel the force vibrating through spirit,
Re-behold the black stars,
For they embody the essence of thunderbolt

Behold, the architects
The creators of passages
That connect all the spheres and worlds,
Like swirling hexagrams above the skull-bearer
The absolute halo is awakening, their dance
The diversity of movements that pierces all the Limitations, in ecstasy
Penetrate through the somnolent flames that form
The circle of bliss immersed in frenzy submerge and
Feel the pure, unrestricted force, at last,
Touch the trident and feel yourself as a skeleton
