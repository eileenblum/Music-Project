[The song consists of two vocals bein done at the same time.
One whispered in the foreground and one spoken in the background]

[whispered voice:]
Cold,
it's stone cold,
still I hear,
where mornings will never touch me again,
I falleth,
I falleth.

[Spoken voice in the background:]
You,
culmination of vermins,
I don't need you,
mornings will never touch me again,
you,
culmination of vermins,
I don't need you,
mornings will never touch me again,
you,
culmination of vermins,
I don't need you,
mornings will never touch me again.
