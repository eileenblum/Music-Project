What is rational for my mind,
is not,
is not,
is not,
for yours,
I have closed my eyes,
with my hands I feel,
the gleaming rays,
horizontal,
vertical.

I don't want,
rays,
I don't want,
with those rays,
I don't want,
with those rays,
I don't want,
with those rays,
gleaming rays,
horizontal,
and vertical,
I don't want,
with those rays,
I don't want,
with those rays.

I have forgot,
the teachings,
absolute truths,
absolute truths,
I have forgot,
I have forgot,
my past,
I have forgot,
the teachings,
absolute truths,
those truths,
I have forgot,
my past,
my past,
my past,
my life,
I have forgot,
my,
I have forgot,
my past,
I have forgot,
those truths,
absolute truths,
I have forgot,
my past.

What is rational for my mind,
is not,
is not,
is not,
for yours,
my mind,
my mind.

My mind.

I,
I,
I am here,
to walk alone,
I am here,
to walk alone,
I am here,
to walk alone,
walk alone,
I have closed my eyes,
with my hands I feel,
I feel cold rays,
gleaming rays,
vertical,
with those,
with those rays.
I have forgot those teachings,
those truths,
absolute truths,
I have forgot,
my,
my own past,
my own truth,
I have forgot,
my past,
my past is lost,
not anymore.
