Thousands of bayonettes,
inside my chest,
inside my chest,
thousands of bayonettes,
inside my chest,
inside my chest.

Uncommon pain,
uncommon pain,
uncommon pleasures,
prove the answers.

My angel destiny,
my,
my angel destiny,
my.

After,
all those miles,
those miles,
after,
those miles,
no desires left to burn,
to burn,
after,
those miles,
no desires left to burn.

No,
desires,
no desires left to burn,
no,
desires,
no desires left to burn,
to burn.

Thousands of bayonettes,
inside my chest,
inside my chest,
rising grey sun,
apocalypse of the pseudo-race,
pseudo race.

Higher,
higher,
higher,
higher stand,
higher stand,
higher form,
higher stand,
higher stand,
higher,
higher stand,
higher form,
higher stand,
higher form.

After,
after,
those miles,
those miles,
desire,
to burn,
to burn,
those miles,
desires,
to burn.
