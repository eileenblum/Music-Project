[The song consists of two vocals being done at the same time.
One whispered in the foreground and one spoken in the background]

[Whispered voice:]
Am I here,
to walk,
alone,
Am I here,
to walk,
alone,
Am I here,
to walk,
alone,
Am I here,
to walk,
alone,
Am I here,
here to walk,
alone,
Am I here,
to walk,
alone.

[Spoken voice in the background:]
Through tunnels of misunderstandings you all crawl,
never will you be able to see the other side of the grey rain,
you are not worth to know, to feel, to see,
Through tunnels of misunderstandings you all crawl,
never will you be able to see the other side of the grey rain,
you are not worth to know, to feel, to see,
Through tunnels of misunderstandings you all crawl,
never will you be able to see the other side of the grey rain,
you are not worth to know, to feel, to see,
Through tunnels of misunderstandings you all crawl,
never will you be able to see the other side of the grey rain,
you are not worth to know, to feel, to see,
Through tunnels of misunderstandings you all crawl,
never will you be able to see the other side of the grey rain,
you are not worth to know, to feel, to see,
Through tunnels of misunderstandings you all crawl,
never will you be able to see the other side of the grey rain,
you are not worth to know, to feel, to see,
Through tunnels of misunderstandings you all crawl,
never will you be able to see the other side of the grey rain,
you are not worth to know, to feel, to see.
