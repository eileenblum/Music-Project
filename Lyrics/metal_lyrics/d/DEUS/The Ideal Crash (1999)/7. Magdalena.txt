You drive too fast
can you please shut up
I'll call the police
if you don't stop.

You're just trying to scare me
you want me to know
that you're not this precious
little thing you hold.

You're afraid you say (and you're never sure)
of the coming day (if what you've seen before)
and I'm not that handsome (is what you'll see again)
anyway (In remembering)

But I'm feeling good
and if you don't exist
you're still one illusion
that I can't resist

Now you're holding back
and I'm holding on
Heaven knows what you want.
'Cause kicks like these
they're coming fast
but watching how long they last.

It's a funny time
to fall in love
feels like something pulled me up
to see me fall right off.
You drive too fast
but I don't care
wherever's fine
just take me there.

Now I'm holding back
and you're moving on
Heaven knows what I want
'Cause on a day like this
I'd believe anything
I don't know where to begin.

One for your coming
two for your shoes
Your buccaneer loving
and suicide moods
I wanna move
don't figure out much
into the new
out of the blue, out of the darkness

into the new, out of the blackness...
