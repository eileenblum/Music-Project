Stay by my side, it's over
the ride isn't what I told you
the painkiller-side of this night
is to not look behind it's over

I have been told about longing
a feeling so old. it's dead.
I must have been misled
so stay be my side. I'm sorry.

I'm drawing myself the ideal crash
but I know I won't believe me.
There'll be a time you'll leave me.

Stay by my side. it's sexy
the way that we talk about stuff
the way that we laugh with love
the way that we're falling off.

CRASH you're life's been sucking 'cause you wanna mess
around. can anybody down you with a
CRASH another way of saying that you like to make it
up as you move along. If it's a lot, show them what you got.

Stay by my side. I want you
continue the theme that's us
even though it's only lust
the painkiller-side of this life.

I'm drawing myself the ideal crash
and I know I won't believe me.

How can a man kill gently
how long before it's all done
how can he leave someone
how can he do it softly?

CRASH you're life's been sucking 'cause you wanna mess
around. can anybody down you with a
CRASH another way of saying that you like to make it
up as you move along. If it's a lot, show them what you got
CRASH you're gonna go to hell with a certain inclination
try and make it sell and then you
CRASH you're gonna have to take yourself out of
circulation into something else
If it's a lot, show them what you got
Right now I need my hands, to cover this shit up
I need my eyes to see where I'm going, and I need someone...

Stay by my side, it's sexy
the way that we talk about stuff
the way that we laugh with love
the way that we're falling off.
