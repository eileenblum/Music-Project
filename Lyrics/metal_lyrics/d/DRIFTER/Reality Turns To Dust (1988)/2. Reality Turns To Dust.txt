Follow me
In my world of dreams
Be my true companion
Come in the dense forest
of the mythical tales
Penetrate and feel
The breath of fear
Glide into the land of fantasy

Come in

I saw âem marching, immortal legions
I saw the land of the cyclops
From the peak of the mountains
I sounded the horn
on the captured hostile ships
No earthquake,
no shower of arrows
blinded me.

I overflew the seven seas
I fought in the arenas of time
No armed forces behind me.

I crossed the zones of the underworld
I saw death, blood, hate and despair
I survived the holy war
No storm, no power blinded me

Fight Kill Die
