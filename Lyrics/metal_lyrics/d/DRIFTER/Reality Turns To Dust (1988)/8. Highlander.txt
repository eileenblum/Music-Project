I come from another time
Deep far away in the past â
Iâve got my mission to fight to be able to change the world -
Or to let it fall into times of darkness
The highlands are my home where I was born to be
The only one that lasts

Just one of us will stand as the last
Just one can win the battle
Just one of us will see the glory
Just one can break that black
If I lose my head by the swords of my enemies
Nobody will destroy the black oneâs power

The highlands are my home where I was born to be
The only one that lasts

I am the Highlander
Iâve come into your time
To be the winner of the great meeting

My only love is stacked on this world
So beware of its coldness and darkness
So beware of a time
When the blackness is coming from beyond
To rule this morbid world
