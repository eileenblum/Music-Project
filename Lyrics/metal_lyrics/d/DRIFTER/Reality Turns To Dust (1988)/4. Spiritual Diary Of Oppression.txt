Whatâs this stench of death ?
Where  am I ,
The air seems to be infected
I am in the dark
No, no I am captured and betrayed

Syrus, youâve broken the sacred oath
Youâve betrayed me

Youâve pushed me into this hell
Youâve betrayed me

Youâve betrayed our home
and all our friends
Youâve betrayed me

For gold and power you became a scoundrel
Youâve betrayed me

What has happened
At our meeting place ?

Syrus are you here ?
Brother where are you ?
Show yourself, itâs me
Whatâs the matter,
Who are those soldiers ?
No Syrus, what have you done,
You diary traitor
You bloody traitor !

Captured in this dungeon by my equals.
Chained for the rest of my life
My suffering is not comparable
With the one of my people,
Cos Iâm only one of so many

My curse upon the torturer of ourselves
Our empire will be reborn
The time of oppression wonât last much longer.
