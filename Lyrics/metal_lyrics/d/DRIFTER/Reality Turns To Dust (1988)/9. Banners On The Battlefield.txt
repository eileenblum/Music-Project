In the early morning the cock is crying -
And the sun still lies in the twilight
A crusader is already standing â
Watching the sunrise before he will fight

Die Die Die Die

He knows warriors will die
or survive on the battlefield

Die Die Die Die

Running on the battlefield below the arrows shower

Warriors fighting face to face eye to eye
Galloping horses screaming death
Dying knights clashing swords, splitting shields,
The blood is flowing slowly

Banners on the battlefield are waving proud
Banners on the battlefield between life ânâ death
Banners on the battlefield out of time
Banners on the battlefield out of time

Whose banner will stand in victory ?
Whose banner will fall in dust ?
Knight ride into attack
Up above the gods of war are celebrating
The end comes closer with rage ân fear
Cruel men violence ânâ destruction are ruling
Some fanfares are calling for victory
Others are dying in this way

Die Die Die Die

He knows warriors will die
or survive on the battlefield

Die Die Die Die

Running on the battlefield below the arrows shower

After the battle is over itâs calm
The slaves taken in chains.
To wait for death
Thatâs the price they must pay in the end
The gods drink their blood laughing at them

Banners on the battlefield are waving proud
Banners on the battlefield between lifeânâ death
Banners on the battlefield out of time
Banners on the battlefield out of time

Now the time has come to leave this place of doom
The sun goes down again, tomorrowâs another day
Maybe one day people will forget what happened here
The truth, a legend, a lie or just a fantasy ?
