Every morning you go to work
Every day you gotta act like a slave
And the big man behind the desk grinding his hands
Heâs groaning about his profits, making him biggerân bigger
He laughs at you
He uses all your force to keep his system rolling on.
He tells you all about your rights
You never ever realized
He has the power, has the money
But if you donât agree with him
Youâl be back on the streets no sooner than you know.

We donât accept it anymore
We are breaking free
We say:
Fuck them all !
Handsâre rising
We are strong
Fuck them all !
Show weâre one union
They will fall

We fear of the future
Why should we be their slaves ?
They canât prevent our rising
Itâs our hate that makes us strong
Hate makes us biggerân bigger
Now, now, we are laughing at them !
