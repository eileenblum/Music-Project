All around is the darkness
When you are running for the light
Deep inside you burns a fire
You know itâs your desperate heart

Flying high against the starlight
Flying high where dragons die
Now you see itâs in the distance
Burning circles catch you by surprise

Burn â All around is the darkness
Burn - When youâre running for the light
Burn - Deep inside you burns a fire
Burn â Burning circles in your mind

To the burning circles
To the burning circles
To the burning circles

Youâre burning in the heat
It makes you sweat
But you never feel it
You feel the Black Voodoo Power
Is it the end or just a dream ?

Inside the circles you see the masterâs face
Laughing at you with glimmering eyes
Your soul is caught by the hands of doom
Now you have to dance forever â

All your life
