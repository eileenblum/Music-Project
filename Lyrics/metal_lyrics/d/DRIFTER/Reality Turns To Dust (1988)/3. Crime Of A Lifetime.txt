Life as everybody knows
Canât be defined by the mind
You live your own way of life
Never knowing how it ends

Crime of the gods lifetime

You never expected
Youâd have a destiny
Cos your life doesnât seem to be something special
Lifetimesâ endless game of chess
Whiteân black like goodân evil
But who will win your game ?

There will be something on your way
That will change your mind !
You donât see it coming,
Step after step,
Like a dark figure
Walking down a hall
Towards a certain door
There youâll find the sense in life.

Now youâre wondering
Why youâre too powerless to stop it,
Your whole life is a crime
Crime of the gods,
Living a lifetime
Suicideâs on your mind
Thereâs no escape
All you gotta do
Is play your fucking game till the end !
