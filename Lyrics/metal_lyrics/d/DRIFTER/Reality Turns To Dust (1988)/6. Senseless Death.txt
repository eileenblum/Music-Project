War â everyone knows that word
Everyone is afraid of it

War terror pain and fear
The fear of certain death

Over thousands of years in so many wars
Men killed men so senselessly

They did what they want to do
And do not listen to the voice of good sense

Making machines to destroy yourself with brute force.

To order we kill, we massacre, we destroy, we burn down.

Nobody wants the total war,
âcos everyone knows its high price

Press the button and the bombs are out
And weâll have to start it all again

Stop and think, let it be
Throw those weapons away
Save the world
Stop this madness

Why are we still killing ?

Why do we kill ????
