There is the light that saves their lives
In the storm and darkness of the night

The tower, the last hope,
To survive deadly cliffs

Where is the light of the tower
The light everybody longs for? .

A hundred pairs of eyes hopefully look
Through the dark of the night

With shivering hands and a feeling
Of dread

A shout goes out they've seen the light
Tower's proud light is yet in sight

Tower high on the cliffs
Your light it means survival

Forgotten tower high on the cliffs
Standing through the ages

In every one of us there is a burning light
A light of hope, a light of salvation
A light to lead us through this world of cruelty
A fight that lets us forgive, cry and laugh

But is it the light of life
Or the light of death?
