I can hear the scream of despair
It's shooting through my body

I can't speak or feel or see
I just can't believe it

Torture's laughter echoes through the land
The weeping children cannot understand

So much blood
So much pain
Too much death

No hope, no help, no end
The shadows of fear eclipse the land

Deprived of liberty
They will never laugh again

The mothers tears
The fathers sorrow
The weeping children cannot understand

Is this really our civilized world
Where love and reason stand as sacred words

If that's the way it is, then this world is no place for me
