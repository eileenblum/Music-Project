You ran for your life from the fireball
While death rained down and the skies did fall
Cities wrapped in a fiery shroud
And the land beneath a mushroom cloud

How can you live you twisted thing
Once the great uranium king
What life now in your nuclear bog
You're a twisted wreck, a strontium dog

Before your fall a number one guy
But even then you blackened the sky
Polluted rivers and poisoned the rest
Dear mother earth was this incest
Writhe on your back and look at the sky
What do you see with your mutant eye
The skies are black when they should be blue
Who pushed the button you now it was you

Can you cry and will you weep
For the millions now in endless sleep
Dreams of a race immersed in fire
Your final result a nuclear pyre
