High on the hill he was standing there,
The guardian of his tribe
The clans they looked up to him
With risen hands he started to speak

All life is equal, therefore we live together
With all living things
But then came intruders, sick with greed
And hungry for power

He's the Lord of his people
He's the Lord of his tribe
He's the Lord of this land
He's the Lord of this paradise

He's the Lord of his people
He's the Lord of this tribe
Over thousands of years
He led his clans through this paradise

This race makes laws that the rich can break
But not the poor
Giving to the rich and stealing from those
Who want for more
They rape the earth as if it was their own
They stripped it bare right to the bone
Let's search for a place to live
A valley of freedom where we still can give
