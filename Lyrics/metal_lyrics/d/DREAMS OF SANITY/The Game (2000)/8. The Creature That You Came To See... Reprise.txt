So hast thou heard the dazzling wonders
And have you felt my life again? Felt my lies again?
Hast seen my birth and watched my dying?
Hast been amused by how I fell? Amused by how I felt?

The empress' whispers in the sky
The soothing stream ran by your side
The springtime's youth vitality
And how it started with a scream...?

Now leave the stage and stagger home
And leave the sadness of these songs - the madness of these songs.
You may forget what I did tell
But if (it's) thou wish "The Game" shall start again, again, again, ...
