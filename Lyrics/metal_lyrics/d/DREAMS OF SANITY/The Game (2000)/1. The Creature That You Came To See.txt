Wakeup now, and join all in -
into this dance you came to see.
Watch me now for I am born
I'm born to fit this melody.

And no one asks how I might feel
A creature built to do this task.
I'll live with you this hour long
And fade with the lights as you go.

But that's what's there to bother me
For you are here - you paid to see
A tale so pretty, yet sad and mean,
And not an "Idea" in agony.
