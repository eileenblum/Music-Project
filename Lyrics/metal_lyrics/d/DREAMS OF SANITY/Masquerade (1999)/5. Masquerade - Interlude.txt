So see me enter those timeless walls
The city of Paris - or was it Rome?
I do not care - Oh! - I nevermind.
Nowhere I run to - I can hide.

So masked my face - so masked my mind.
The body well hidden in this opera's walls.
The stones start breathing as my heart stops beating
as I listen to her voice.

How can I take and dare to touch
These waves web sounds of angel's voice
Come! Close your eyes and shield your mind.
And sing with me - sing tonight!
