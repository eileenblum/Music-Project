Haunting thoughts of darker needs
The sounds of sad silence cease
Somber songs are whispering
Angelic words sanctity

Sin
In name of sodomy
The lustful soul
Incestuous fantasies
Your sinful seed

In cessation of damnation
Desecration of your lord
DesolationÃ¯Â¿Â½s of your living 
Obsessed with you faith 
Your foolish words

Phantoms haunt
Dark and lost in your beliefs
Pained inside
Frightened, you face this suffering

Deceived us with faith 
Our souls for the tears
In Reality our end is when we are deceased
Enslaved us obsession of senseless saints
Thus sanitys of dissension through your deceits
Deliver us from fiction 
Foreseen these lies
