Silence falls from the rain
Upon the tears of the slain
Tortured screams fill the night
The joy you feel from their cries

The nightmares of evil
You face these horrors from your mind
Cold and gray
Embrace emptiness of this dark life
Shame and disgraced
You feed on pain and suffering
Desolate
The silence and loneliness beckons me
Sinful ways
The terror I've inflicted will bring me pleasure

In the face of fear â this terror haunts
Lonely darkened soul â you're the fortunate one
Cries of shameful ways â It's too late your lost
Prayers for forgiveness of the sins â Repent

Faith of hate
Your church failed me now I am alone
Screams of pain
The lives that I take mean nothing to me
Frightened soul
The images of my past life haunts me in my dreams
Alone and cold
The anguish I am in comes from deep in my mind
Suffering
The tears of sadness â hope turns to despair

I'm the face of evil
Silent &amp; tortured man
Sickened by all mankind
Demise by my hand
