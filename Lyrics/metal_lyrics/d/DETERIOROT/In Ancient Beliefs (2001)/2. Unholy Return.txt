The rebirth of the son
The new Christ is a dark child reborn
Our soul is in flames
We invite the sadness

The red skies upon us
Witness the angelic cries
The black lord is risen
Worship this unholy Christ
The new prince, the savior
Pray to him our newborn king
The downfall of the saints
The heavens are uprising

Follow the shadows and the fire 
Is thy empire
Sorrow sets inside this terror, and sadness

The rebirth of the son
The new Christ is a dark child reborn
Our soul is in flames
We invite the sadness
