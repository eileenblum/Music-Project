Fill the circle of blasphemy
Chanting the words of evil
Lighting the candles in ceremony
Casting the spell adorn
Releasing the negative energy
Calling the spirit within
Drawing the strength of the entity
The power of the elements

Ceremonial Blasphemies, cast in the underworld
Lost, dark, the loneliness you face your sanity
Grasping the light of the Holy Grail, forsaken empathy
Haunts by spirits see your tranquillity

Sprinkle the powders and burn incense
The ritual has begun
The prayers to the spirit we call upon
Our faith which lies in you
The summoned demon, our only one
The shadows which fall upon
The light of the circle, we join our hands
The darkness that overcomes

Ceremonial Blasphemies, cast in the underworld
Lost, dark, the loneliness you face your sanity
Grasping the light of the Holy Grail, forsaken empathy
Haunts by spirits see your tranquillity

So we lust in the twilight night
For the children of this dark illusion
Mystified, the creator of life
For this deceiver, this mass confusion

Into the darkness this silent hiss
Terror and alone
This nightmare that comes now upon us
Shadows cast from below
You've just witness the ritual ceremonies of blasphemy
