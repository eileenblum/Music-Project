Cold â enslaved
The Shame is my fate

Endless consolations for eternity's
Enlightened you witness this fallen entity
In this realm of darkness â Alone into a world
of silence you feel this Fallen Misery

So lonely
Can see just rain

Endless consolations for eternity's
Enlightened you witness this fallen entity
In this place of darkness â Alone this is your world
of silence you feel this Fallen Misery

Don't want to see this world
Suffering you see, your emptiness,
your will to be

Just want to see the end
The loneliness, you feel
The darkness as you fade away

So we love
The sorrows cease
The Black inside
All is gone

In our loss
We cannot see
Why I'm lost
Through your deceit
