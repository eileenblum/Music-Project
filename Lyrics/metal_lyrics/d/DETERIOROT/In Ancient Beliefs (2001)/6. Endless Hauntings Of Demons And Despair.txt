Those feelings
Have returned
The somber night adorned
The mistiness, the cold

Filled with sadness

Sense of the darkened world
Seize the same desolations
The sins of sanctity
Your self disgrace

Embark the twilight
Consumed by sorrow
Endless hauntings 
of demons and despair

Empty holes within
The void that never fades
Embark another night
With the emptiness embrace

Filled with sadness
Enchanted Darkness
Embrace the twilight
