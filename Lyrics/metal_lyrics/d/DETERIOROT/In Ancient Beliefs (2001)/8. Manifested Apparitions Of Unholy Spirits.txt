Subconscious thoughts of unholiness recurring consciously.
The hauntings and depravations of the Christ of blasphemy
Beyond the gates for in which you lie, to redeem your sins of life.
Angelic chants of their suffering, bleeding tears of unholy light

Nordic winds in the mystic light, screams of bestial cries.
Down the path leads to the dark, Disparities in demise
Summoning of the baphomet, enchanted world entwined
Abolishment of the Son of God â Damnation

See the grave of the holy man
Deceived us, disgraced, now perish
Believe in your foolish saint.
Pray to the unborn child, desecrate the womb
The son, this Jesus, your lord, your faith in a mortal man
Disgrace the beliefs of this feeble world

Evil spells are chanted
Spoke unto thus thy man
Join the circle
The downfall of the Christian savior

Damned to all feeble followers of Christ mortal soul agonized in pain
In the abyss awaits your soul to suffer eternally the wrath of the flames
Doomed, sins, spirits reign

Nordic winds in the mystic light, screams of bestial cries.
Down the path leads to the dark, Disparities in demise
Summoning of the baphomet, abolishment of the Son of God
To suffer eternal wrath of the flames
