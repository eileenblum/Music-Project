Crush â Descended from hell and darkness
Destroyed - All of my creations
Kill â Holiness endeavor
In the light â there you will die

Then he sees that he is in the light and he knows he's gonna die
Flashing is his life before his eyes; his life is but a lie
In the dawn of the afterlife his soul is to be damned.
His name not found in the book of life, to the lake of fire he shall be cast.

Lost â in the underworld
Redeem â sins to be burned
Perish â the soul that had no life
Escape â there's none but punishment

Sins of life to be judged, there's no way for you to fight.
Victims of the unholy ghost, for none to unsurpassed

In the afterlife
Sins to be burned
Victims of punishment
