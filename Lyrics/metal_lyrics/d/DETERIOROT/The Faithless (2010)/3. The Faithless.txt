Insolence - inside are your sins
In silence - inside you`re seen
In a way - Inside you`ll sense
In Solace - Inside you`ll see

This is what it is
We`ve swallowed all the lies
Souls descend=fear
This is what we fear
We`ve chosen all the lies
Ignorant and Sincere

Innocence - inside it`s nonsense
In no way - inside you process
In old ways - inside your fears
In Science - The facts are clear

This is what it is
We`ve swallowed all the lies
Souls descend=fear
This is what we fear
We`ve chosen all the lies
Ignorant and Sincere
