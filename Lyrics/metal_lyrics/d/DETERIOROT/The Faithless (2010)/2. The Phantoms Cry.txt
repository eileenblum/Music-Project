Inside us are our fears
In torment for our loss
In the silence are our throughts
The Phantoms Cry in unison

Inside me
Infernal
In sadness
I`m buried
Eternal
Sinsation

Inside us are our fears
In torment for our loss
In the silence are our throughts
The Phantoms Cry in unison

The fight within ourselues it seems to be same
To doubt, we`re forced to think the same for years
