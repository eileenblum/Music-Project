We`ve deceived to set them free
for 8 years - Mother`s tears
Strategy or Tragedy
Send our youths to their and

free?
How silly
Now see our shame

It all that we see the media they feed?
Believe the half truths
Or read in between
Covered in blame
We cause our own shame
fighting a war with insurgents for greed

GREED

In the sea
In the air
In the ground
fair warfare?

Careless Bombings where there`s families
The civlians are the main casualties
Where is the media coverage? It`s weak
Inside I fear the enemy is me
