Hauntings
Are they dreams?
Nightmares
So they seem

father`s soul lingers
In the light you must go in

Restless Spirits in a realm of two worlds in between
father, can you see the lights? The energy?

Enter the gate
Your farthest descent was your mental demise
Your father`s prayer in the night
Buried
In our sight - flames
Bitter Soul
Blamed
Hate
In our sight - flames
Your buried and our soul is in flames
Hate - fate
