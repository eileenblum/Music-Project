[Bonus Track][originally by Sodom]It's time to die 
Death stands behind the door 
Satan sends his warriors 
Demons break out of Hell 

Shrill cries 
Angel dies 
Shrill cries 
Outbreak of evil 

With swords and axes 
The fight hard 
In a massacre 
they feel the hot smart 

None can survive 
People will destroy 
Souls like hell 
Where demons make a toy
