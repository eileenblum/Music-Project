Into the abyss of sorrow
A thousand deaths of loneliness
Into the night I leave
Enter this world below

Here some have ceased their false hope for true love
fell my last tears
My heart aches for you no more

Into the abyss of sorrow
A thousand deaths of loneliness
Into the night I leave
Enter this world below
