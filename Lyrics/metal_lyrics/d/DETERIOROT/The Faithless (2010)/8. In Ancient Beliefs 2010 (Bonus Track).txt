Diseased - All you fools
Pray to your god
Deceived by the tales - Invented
Live by the words made by man
Serve the false god - Simpletons
Filled with false hope and fantasies

Believe in the Saints &amp;
Senseless stories
Unanswered prayers
Beliefs of deceit

Depressed, anxiety
Subconsciously you sense
The doubts of all shall know
Your faithfulness fades

Believe in ancient fables
Your consciences lie in ancient beliefs

Diseased - All you fools
