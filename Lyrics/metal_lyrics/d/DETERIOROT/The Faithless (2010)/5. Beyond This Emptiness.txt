So alone before
In the depths of my own sadness it rains
The sky is grey in my mind
Like tears from the void in my heart
My dismay

find the way to ease your mind
for sake of sanity.
There is light beyond this emptiness
My hope for happiness

Endless thought keep me up
Night after night my life passed by
Regrets from the past
Thoughts of doom and fears of an end repeat at night

find the way to ease your mind
for sake of sanity.
There is light beyond this emptiness
My hope for happiness
[repeat after break]
