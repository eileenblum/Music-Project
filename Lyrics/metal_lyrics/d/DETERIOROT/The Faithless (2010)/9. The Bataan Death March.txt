Thousands have died on the path
Marched from Marveles on The Bataan
Soldiers malnovrished and weak
for 6 days their covrage has peaked
fallen and Beaten they try their hardest to stay alive
Watching your comrades now die
You fate is not yours to decide

If others say, our war is our shame
We`re now the enemy
Why are we hear?

If others say, this war helped save a nation that is now free
Why keep us here?

Into the march of insanity
Thousands of soldiers lost lives
Abandoned by our own goverment
Serving a nation of lies
Where was the rescue as we wait for death
Discovraged, your faith you deny
The final breath of the soldier is now
We are running out of time
