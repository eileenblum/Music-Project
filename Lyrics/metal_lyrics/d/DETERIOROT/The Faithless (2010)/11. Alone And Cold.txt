Hear my last words
My final tragedy
I bid you farewell
for my words will live on
My music plays on
But now I am gone

frightened and alone
Tales of sandess
Hear the cries
Grey Mourning

Alone in my own mind
fear the empty within
But my life will go on
So we must move on
Please let the past go

frightened and alone
Tales of sandess
Hear the cries
Grey Mourning

All my hopelessness has truly gone away
My thoughts are like enemies
My mind betrays me
I can no longer say I`m alone and cold

Don`t care for your fairy tales
Please don`t
So save your prayers
Keep your book
There`s nothing you can do
My mind is not closed but I`m free to choose
I`ll miss you, for nothing can save me now
Thank you for all the memories
