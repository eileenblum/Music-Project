Attack the enemy
Maim all in your path
Cast the curse of contorting pain
Dominate with your blade

The lines we penetrate
Conquer their mighty realm
Bring them to their knees
Leave all the remains behind

Path of blood shed, strike down upon
Strangle their lords, hail the conquering
Royal life is laid to waste, hang them high
Let them witness the agony
Win the battle: Ignite the town
Angry warriors of the night, light their resin
Mighty kings of the wicked realms
Victory is present when no life is spared

Reign in black ruin
Cauldrons boiling hot
Molten wax drips away
Flames ariseâ¦ wicked cinders

Ashes, burn the flesh!
Chants of black fill the air!

Attack the enemy
Maim all in your path
Cast the curse of contorting pain
Dominate with your blade

Die!
Die!
