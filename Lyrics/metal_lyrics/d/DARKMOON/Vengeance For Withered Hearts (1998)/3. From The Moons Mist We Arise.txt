Might!

Dawn is the illusion as we conquer this realm of lies
Dawn is when they find their feeble king after the battle in his realm drawn his blood

Arise brothers of the night, for our blade gleam in the moonlight
We are the power that gathers us here, masters
Knights gather for the blood feast

We arise!
Sons of war!
Masters who conquer, let him die upon your feet!
Blood on our swords!
I see no end to our bloodshed
Conquer this realm!
Kill them all I make them all suffer eternally!

Knights in the battle gather
So you think you are mighty
Unleash all of your rage
Come draw your arms, battle might, conquering the enemy, I see die!

Magical war!
Let our blades be stronger, stronger than universe unconquered
All of them be conquered and down
Let them die in pain
See his blood drain from his neck and die with demons

All falling down to honor the massacre
The untold story
The doom of a weapon drawn to the neck, counts the seas of glory
The doors are seething to conquer, enemies arise our
Land is soiled
To doom a land is a call for all to be dying!

Arise!
Allow the blood to flow freely!
The blood
May we enter, to our own knights
Arise bloodline now enter war!
Life is the germ on our lands, fly amongst the storms
And in battle we will conquer all
Cleanse the soil, take them down!!!
