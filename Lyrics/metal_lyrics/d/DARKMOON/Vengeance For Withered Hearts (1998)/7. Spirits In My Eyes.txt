Rites of old age, winds, come upon my coals
Circulate oceans warmth: Awaken spirits my mystic domain
Cease my inner pain: guides my essence to endless chasms
Carry my wings through the caverns

Descend into black
Abyss of knowledge
Solo empire to assassinate
This flesh I bear
Scorned!

Transcend, boil, burn, and ruin!
Transform, rise, strength, ruinous
War!

Draw my blade glide it across my throat
My calling
Embers invasion me
Die withâ¦
Spirits in my eyes

Spirits in my eyes
