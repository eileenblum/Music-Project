Might!
Dawn is the illusion as we conquer this realm of the lies
Dawn is when they find their feeble king after the battle, his realm drawn his blood
Arise brothers of the night, for our blades gleam in the moonlight
We are the power that gathers us here, masters, knights gather for the bloodfeast

We arise! Sons of war
Masters who conquer let him die upon your feet
Blood on our swords!
I see no end to our bloodshed
Conquer this realm!
Kill them all, make them all suffer eternally
Knights in the battle, gather
So you think you are mighty
Unleash all of your rage
Come draw your arms, battle might, conquering the enemy, I see die!
Magical war!
Let our blades be stronger, stronger than universe, unconquered
All of them be conquered and down
Let them die in pain
See his blood drain from his neck, and die with demons
All falling down to honour the massacre
The untold story
The doom of a weapon drawn to the neck, count the seas of glory
The doors are seething to conquer, enemies arise our land is soiled
To doom a land is call for all to be dying!

Arise!
Allow the blood to flow freely
The blood
May we enter to our own knights
Arise bloodline now enter war
Lies is the germ on our lands, fly amongst the storms
And in the battle we will conquer
Cleanse the soil, take them down!
