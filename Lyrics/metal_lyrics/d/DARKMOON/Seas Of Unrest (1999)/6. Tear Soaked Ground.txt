Gaze upon the sea of slain brothers
As the tears well up in her eyes
The agony of blood streams down the hillside
Our battle is not yet done

She sends her love to a warrior
Whose life is yet to be overcome?
His blade cuts the sky in might
We stand over his grave, as the rage dwells in our hearts, his memory lies within our steel!

Ride... brothers bearing all arms ride out of the black in glory

Blaze across the plains with horses of raging flame
Honor his blood
Our tears soak these grounds of our slain brothers
May the hawks oversee our victory
Victory

She awaits her lover's return
For she knows there will be no return!

Seasons crest on our lands

Rise with the hawk's wicked eye
Prey in stealth

Rise upon your lands
Enter to your domain
Bring back their heads in a bountiful flume
Present them with a grip of hate

She cries proud and glorious of her love
Forever we ride in spirit
