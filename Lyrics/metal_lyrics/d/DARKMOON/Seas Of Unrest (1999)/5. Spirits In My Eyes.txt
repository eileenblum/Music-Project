Rites of old age, winds, come upon my coats
Circulate oceans warmeth, awaken spirits my mystic domain
Clash my inner pain, guide my essence to endless chasms
Carry my wings through the caverns

Descend into black
Abyss of knowledge
Solo empire to assassinate
This flesh I bear
Scorned!

Transcend - boil, burn and ruin!
Transform, rise, strength, ruinous
War!

Draw my blade glide it across my throat
My calling
Embers invasion me
Die with
Spirits in my eyes
