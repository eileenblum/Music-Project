The strive of power, the engagement of loyalty
The unity of our masses and the strength of our numbers

Dissention arises with out a trace
Bringing the infrastructure down
Scour amongst the ones
Kill who denied the law
The law witch is so clearly stated with in our minds
that No man will deceive the bloodline.
Dissention arises with out a trace
Bringing the infrastructure down
Scour amongst the ones
Kill who deny

The law that is never spoken nor written!
The bonds that are weakened and the Loyalty has diminished,

The trust has been severed and the circle is breached
The ranks gather and confuse the traitor to reveal its name...

Their feeble attempts of rebellion... stand held in high contempt!
Our conviction will be heard!
All those who wish to infiltrate struck down... and brought to before their peers!
All who cry out mercy for traitors... will be punished and seared across our domain!
We will be Sterile and elite!
Join us and prosper the riches of loyalty and honor!

The pride for your brothers!
A True alliance and a true bloodline!
Assault, strike them all, attack their ways...
We will be impenetrable...
