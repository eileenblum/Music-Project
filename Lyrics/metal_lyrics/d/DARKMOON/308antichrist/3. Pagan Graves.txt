Conflict inside their domain

Conflict of rebels....
Lightning bestows the sky...
A message from pagan graves...
Marbh, marbh, marbh, marbh! (kill, kill, kill, kill)

Wrath rises from beneath....
Breathe into thee....
As the fatal shot...
Is fired

Drop the hammer on the derelicts of deceit... their time... is now to die

Rage rises from beneath...
Breathe into thee...
As the fatal shot...
Is cast

Terror from the trees...
A crack heard too late
The scurry of all their people
Duck, hide, and run for cover

Born of hatred, cease the moment to release;
Enslave them to fear...
Conflict inside their domain

Sewn hatred, hordes of our patriots...
Drawn down...
Into graves...
Eyes of the wicked...
Seen what you've said and done...
The time is now...
For you ...
Tooooooo run!

Conflict of rebels....
Lightning bestows the sky...
A message from pagan graves...
Marbh, marbh, marbh, marbh! (kill, kill, kill, kill)

Wrath rises from beneath....
Breathe into thee....
As the fatal shot...
Is fired

Pagan Graves
