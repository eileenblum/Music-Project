Radiation, deformation
Nuclear world damnation.
Mushroom clouds rise with grace
Atomic winter here to stay.
Blast from hell burns the world
Storms of death, kill with hate
Demons attack with hunger
Satanic warfare by nuclear thunder.

Death eruption, caustic weather
Black snow falling, hell is calling
Nuclear holocaust, crimson sky
Beloved paradise, here at last

It's the Atomic Age
