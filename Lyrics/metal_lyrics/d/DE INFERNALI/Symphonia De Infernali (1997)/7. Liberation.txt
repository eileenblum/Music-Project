Life is but a flower
which wrinkles with devour
I do not trust in lustful joys,
death do prove them, all but toys.

I am a servant, I am a slave,
death reaps life, my soul it save`s

this life of lies is not for me
beauty waits in death to see
I am the one that blessed has been
the truth beyond this life I've seen.
Almighty father take my life,
father Satan take me home

I am of Satans Beauty spawn
I shall not live to face the dawn.
The time has come, the day is near
"gods" creations will be there...

Father of heaven weak he is,
sought to drain my life that is.
Now he fears what I become,
he's minions dead, my work is done.

The death of your servants is my solution,
Azerate takes me, I will be free...
Death is all I care to be...
