I observe the swarm of my kind under my feet
They annihilate hysterically for an approving sign
Meanwhile Iâm here, to the zenith of the world
I move the waves of their broken dreams with my capitalâs flow

Gathering in secrets meetings
Manipulation
Planning new way to suppress
The voice of your reason
Stimulation of fear
Growing communication systems
Only to amplify
Your loneliness

To The Zenith of the world
Collect, squeeze, corrupt and dominate
Plays of powers guarantee
A share of goods, stolen from asleep community
Iâm Higher, Iâm above
To the zenith of the world

I observe the swarm of my kind under my feet
They annihilate hysterically for an approving sign
Meanwhile Iâm here, to the zenith of the world
I move the waves of their broken dreams with my capitalâs flow

Blood-filthy handshakes sign contracts like pacts
With Another crossroad demon under wraps

Consume your misery
Gauntlet of the power squeeze and shape your daily agony

Gathering in secrets meetings
Manipulation
Planning new way to suppress
The voice of your reason
Stimulation of fear
Growing communication systems
Only to amplify
Your loneliness

To the zenith of the world
Amass, squeeze, corrupt and dominate
Complex plays of power guarantee
Good-stolen from community
To the zenith of the world
Collect squeeze corrupt and dominate
The true face of power sign pacts
With another crossroad demons â under wraps
