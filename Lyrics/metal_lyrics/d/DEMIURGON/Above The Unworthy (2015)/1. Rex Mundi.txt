All my limbs are calling me
through the gates of cosmic perception
I am the unlight
Hear the call beyond the stars
I am everything

Waters are expanding to satisfy my will
to spread the disease of existence
my mother enchained inside my womb
the eye of omnipotence is now unleashed

Keeping The crown, sat on the throne
the sun bows at my feet
lay on the ground of my shiny home
you are my reign

These chains of light have set the bound
between space, a cage of dimensional limits
knowledge will sleep eternally
the eye of omnipotence is now unleashed

Keeping The crown, sat on the throne
the sun bows at my feet
the ocean of matter lay on my palm
all is my reign

all the interstellar docks of sense
are slaves to my pitch black

Empty is your meaning of time
useless your perception of space

Formless
eternally I stand before myself
Universe is my name
human understanding is futile
bewilder will prevail

Saturnian - Rex Mundi

Keeping The crown, sat on the throne
the sun bows at my feet
lay on the ground of my shiny home
you are my reign

Keeping The crown, sat on the throne
the sun bows at my feet
the ocean of matter lay on my palm
all - is my reign
