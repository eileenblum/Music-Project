Feel your creature behind your eyes,
between your ears, ethereal vibrations
It pulses, it pushes, it beats,
minds are battlefields
Resist to atomization, or fall into meaningless
one last chance to reconnect with the air

Wheel the sun
ABOVE THE UNWORTHY
slowly turning in unending circle
Wheel the sun
we're creeping backward
barely aware of ourselves

New thoughts of disruption,
altered visions, glimpse of reality
Inner devastating urge,
irrepressible search
of some more source of truth
Enlightens humanity's paths

Wheel the sun
ABOVE THE UNWORTHY
slowly turning in unending circle
Wheel the sun
we're creeping backward
barely aware of ourselves

Without voice, any critical removed
plundered words, waving in superstitions
Any further investigation denied
traditions never move, or die

We forgot the taste of light, lost in uselessness
reason anesthetized by overstimulated emotions
What a wonderful knowledge, we withered in decades
reason anesthetized by overstimulated emotions
Slowly hanged to the cranes of ego
reason anesthetized by overstimulated emotions
What a wonderful knowledge, we withered in decades
reason anesthetized by overstimulated emotions

Imperfect products, socially engineered
indoctrinated to disbelieve in future
Their end is a piece of art
Apathetic spectators of our own funeral
indoctrinated to disbelieve in future
The end is a piece of art

Wheel the sun
ABOVE THE UNWORTHY
slowly turning in unending circle
Wheel the sun
we're creeping backward
barely aware of ourselves

Traditions never move, or die
We are the origin of all evil
