Reptant, these beings have no sound, stare the void sprinkle of their eyes
Treshold for secrets beyond hidden in the forlorn era
Profecies of a new reign unfolded crawl among us
When a pillar of the congregation fails we pray a brood with no spine
Crystals reflects? A shapless almighty?
For the power, for dominion, for the soulless obeisance

Vicious decay
A disgusting stench for hundred bodies piled in the womb of the earth
A hecatomb of mental health, they have no gods, you'll smell only war

Cosmogony reduced in wasteland, as modern path to Iconoclasm hypnotize the mass,
It will scorch, it will devour every cell till the uterine core
no more deities left to worship, downfall into obliteration!
Behold the mutant, feeded with the flesh of inference
Dismal faith in poisoned blood to create the new generation's prey

Vile disarray
A disgusting stench for hundred bodies piled in the womb of the earth
A hecatomb of spiritual lymph, they have no gods, you'll taste only war

Mournful empire, grey quarters where they march with no pride
May the feverish sermon held on the crystal altar is the answer to all?

Behold the asters, nurse their children in the dance of grey doctrines
May the shapeless almighty will save us from the inmost vile deceit?

Or he won't?

For the power, for dominion,
For the power, thrive the beastly gangrene,
For the power, for dominion,
For the power, thrive ruin and blind obeisance
