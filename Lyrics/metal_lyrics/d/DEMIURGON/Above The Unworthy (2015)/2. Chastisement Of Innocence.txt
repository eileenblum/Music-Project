Boiling eruption of lives tangled together,
a greasy stream into neverending anesthesia awareness
The body collapse into sleepless convulsions
a sacred chastisement for an outrageous innocence

Premature spiritual lobotomy: concept denied
pineal gland removed,
choke into persisting self-deceit: concept denied
Betrayal of ephemeral hopes
they just stick to the surgeon's word
they've not to die

Chastisement of innocence
Welcome into a state of non-being
we who conceit to foresee
We taste the acid haze of conscious paralysis
we who conceit to foresee

Premature spiritual lobotomy: concept denied
pineal gland removed,
choke into persisting self-deceit: concept denied
Betrayal of ephemeral hopes
they just stick to the surgeon's word
they've not to die
Chastisement of innocence

Boiling eruption
of lives tangled together,
a greasy stream
into neverending anesthesia awareness
The body collapse
into sleepless convulsions
a sacred chastisement
for an outrageous innocence

Chastisement of innocence
even if they refuse to aknowledge
every dawn they kneel and pray
to the sun to darken
Chastisement of innocence
even if they'll never shrive it
every dawn they kneel and pray
to the sun to darken

Once and for all
