Myriads of blind beholders
divine sanction in human form,
profusely we bite each other
Trampling on wet fields of instinct
prolific breed, foam to mouth, unending curse

Hard to exhale words when another reality swirls aside,
hard to keep ourselves still sighted
Through whirls of boiling steam,
we stare the imagery of our gallows

I swear, awakening in isolation,
perpetuated over years
I swear, on these fibrillating deviances,
my nameless detention
I swear, bare handed I'll gash this mask,
I'll tear these veils apart

Apogee of a collapsing humanity

Hard to stop the shivering of disgust,
through the noise of unspoken comprehension
Hard to feed mind when it's meaningless,
through a constant feeling of conscription

A jury of sorcerers
omnipresent over me
To taste these slimy sands
here where grief is never wasted
A jury of sorcerers awaits,
to lick the grease of shame
Here where blades will never rest

Hard to exhale words
when another reality swirls aside,
hard to keep ourselves still sighted
Through whirls of boiling steam,
we stare the imagery of our gallows

I swear, awakening in isolation,
perpetuated over years
I swear, on these fibrillating deviances,
my nameless detention
I swear, bare handed I'll gash this mask,
I'll tear these veils apart
