2000 years of spiritual war embodied, million corpses to lubricate power machinery
Too many eyes staring at the almighty. Too many hands able to knife your back

We're all slaves devout to obedience - Freedom indoctrination,
there is no time to waste, mental corruption is overflowing media
Freedom indoctrination, pathological storm
Wake up your mind indentify them... kill'em
You can't think to be free with no chains on your hands
Enslaved by time, enslaved by life, enslaved into the world around you

Human's corruption, freedom privation

Masses of beggars, mummified corpses, dreams and nightmares
No exit until the void, there's no peace with this cancer
The tower of power observes outdoor
From the sky the signal spread down the dead.

Prey and hunter, obey

2000 years of spiritual war embodied, million corpses to lubricate power machinery
Too many eyes staring at the almighty. Too many hands able to knife your back

Freedom indoctrination
there is no time to waste, mental corruption has infected media
Freedom indoctrination - Free your brain and melt the hallucinations
You can't think to be free with no chains on your hands
Enslaved by time, enslaved by life,
enslaved into this world
