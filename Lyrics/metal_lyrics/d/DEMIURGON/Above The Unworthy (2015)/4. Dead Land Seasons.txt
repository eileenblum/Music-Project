Burning dogma of thy sidereal world
Collapsed into ruins no more voices around
Birth of a new mephytic brood
Agglomeration of subversive confused ideas

Let the voice out from the choked breath, millions of victims are trying to scream
Let the blood from bleeding wound coagulate, the preacher's hand need to be cut

Liers hidden treachery the only truth
To deaden the overflowing melted magma brain
Liquefied cerebral emisphere
Humans like beasts fatten for the slaughterhouse

Dead land seasons
Dead land, the wind blows away the misconception
Dead land, a monument of corpses, the time for salvation it's now

Abominion, self-destruction, all is desolation

March like a soldier, without knowing enemy, torturing with force our image
Deform reality, praise the almighty, humanity septic collapse

Burning dogma of thy sidereal world
Collapsed into ruins no more voices around
Birth of a new mephytic brood
Killer for god in the name of lost pregnancy
Let the voice out from the choked breath, millions of victims are trying to scream
Let the blood from bleeding wound coagulate, the preacher's tongue must be cut

Liers hidden treachery the only truth
To deaden the overflowing melted magma brain
Dead-beat planet
armless devotion at the mournful gathering

Dead land!
Dead land, the promised land for the weak
Dead land, the path of humanity ends
Dead land!

Infected skin drowned into the sewers
Darkness creeps inwards our decrepit existence
