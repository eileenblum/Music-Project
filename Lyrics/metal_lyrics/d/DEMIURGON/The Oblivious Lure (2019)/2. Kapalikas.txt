The sun is high in the sky and heâs among insects
The victim's skull on a wooden stick
We recognize you, violator of God's creation
Cursed you for years, condemned for sacrilege

He looks at you bounded to the secular trees
Staring at you living at the desolate crossroad
Begging for salvation, loincloths on a dirty body
Furred animals skin on the edge of mind

Kapalikas is named - showing his sin to humanity

He looks at you bounded to the secular trees
Staring at you living at the desolate crossroad
With bones adorned - guilty for caste desecration
Roaming around in silence - serving a sentence

Warning for all of you, Brahmin killers
Testimony of the Shaivite law
The ascetic sentence for a no more free man
Twelve years-term of wandering penance handing down the ancient tradition
Purusa's inheritance can't be destroyed

Beware of you sinner with no god, punishment is waiting
Behold behold the sinner with no god,
condemned to banishment on the earth
