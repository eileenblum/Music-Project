Decapitation of the dead enemyâs body - to ritualize head
Vertical cut with bamboo knife to remove the skull
Pay attention in order to save the hair
Upside down skin for the inner eyelid seam

Then you sew the mouth leaving long strings
Boiling skin into cauldron full of water and bark trees
Reduce dimension - is getting dark
Muisak must be bounded after the assassination
Re-creation of the original shape sewing the first cut

First fiery pebbles to eliminate soft parts
Moulding external skin to preserve original features
Fill the Head with burning sand - the narrow creation

The delicate process of creative formation
Scraping coal on the skin to make it stronger
The vindictive soul can't escape to punish them
Ceremonial oath - Wakani always lives inside us
Now it's time for warriors to dance with godly fire
The ritual choir permeates the nocturnal silence around

Admire the master's head
