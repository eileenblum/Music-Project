The slaughter messiah fly high in the sky
Everything's quite early in the morning
Mk1 has been prepared - Enola gay is ready to spawn the egg of the dead

Purify ! From above it comes down / Liquefy ! Below wind blows

Six soldiers devoted to obey The Man
He keeps the secret for the new world's big bang
"The people of the sun don't wanna bow to us.
They need to understand who'll lead them to the end"

Purify ! From above it comes down, the phoenix of fire will raze the town
Liquify ! Below wind blows, the ambition of them is to spread the idea
they own the zenith of the world

Fire - The brightest light just before the detonation,
70000 people has been killed just in few seconds
The appalling burning wind reduced the city in a wall of debris
The god of desolation touched the earth with wrath
Melted skin and dead bodies everywhere
shattered crystals as a deadly storm from sky
On the ground survived people carbonized
The shadow of humanity impressed on the stairs,
The witnesses of this crime begging for salvation
Fallout started - post modern decimation
Genbaku is the testimony of this madness

The upside down truth called Necessary evil,
The government of lies traced the line for a new beginning
The peaceful motto is saving life killing life
The upside down truth called Necessary evil,
showing to the world who must owns real power,
The government of lies traced the line for a new beginning,
The peaceful motto is saving life killing you

Conquerors from the other side of world, Pearl Harbor was an excuse to test the final solution. Dissolution for the human race, the future reserves only death's embrace
