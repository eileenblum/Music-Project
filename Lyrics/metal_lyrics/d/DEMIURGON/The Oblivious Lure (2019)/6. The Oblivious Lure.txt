The era of sun is turning black and dusty winds cancel footsteps
Traces of human empire dissolved by time
Nature's dominion prevail from the shores ingurgitating the past
The grave for mankind pretends to be fed

Timeless is the fear for the gods, ages of death have been lighted by stars
Marching together through the path for salvation, the misconception
Truth unrevealed to the masses on kneels, closed in a world that you no more can see
Emptiness waiting to fill the disease, without solutions

Burning the skin, the plague of radiations surround us
Spewing your life, agony and discharge
An horde of eyeless corpses randomize all senses
The taste of the end drills deep into brain

We have the shears to cut these chains, to open the gate of knowledge
Cauterizing the bleeding wounds into pillars of crumbling society
We have the shears to cut these chains, to open the gate of knowledge
Sacrificing some meaningless lives, is the only solution to survive

The era of sun is turning black and dusty winds cancel footsteps
Traces of human empire dissolved by time
Nature's dominion prevail from the shores ingurgitating the past
The grave for mankind pretends to be fed again and again

We must fall to rise stronger and fearless
In the name of freedom we create more chains

Obsessed by images - reality dissolved into magmatic unaware chaos
Staring at the disavowed master - selling him our destiny

We are the gods, we are the gods, we'll be the storm into obscurity - sovereign
