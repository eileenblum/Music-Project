Darkness has been lifted off my head 
Sorrow is the only thing on my chest 
Have you ever prayed for anything more than this ? 
Have you ever wished for anything more in life ? 
I'm not a saint, no I'm not a sinner 
I'll believe when I see God's eyes 
Man of Jesus tell me what do you see 
The Devil's mark embedded on me 
With burning eyes you glared at me 
Confess, confess, confess your sins 
So much doubt in my mind 
So much doubt in my mind 
Mask of Judas look into my eyes 
I continued your pledge now bow to me 
You suffered in silence but lived in a dream 
Agnostic views mean nothing to me 
So much doubt in my mind 
So much doubt in my mind 
If I could see God with my eyes 
He'd repent the poison He built 
If I could see God with my eyes 
He'd be on His fucking knees
