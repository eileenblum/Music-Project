i have walked through the valley the shadow of death cannot end what is already dead
no second coming no shade of the path cannot speak what is already said
death will become me
1000 lies
payed back with sin
this faith is a lie 
all will come clear
just say it straight you can't defend yourself, so full of hate running through my veins 
you live in comfort while the rest of us suffer, the walls you built come crashing around me
Blasphemy
Blasphemy is the darkest sin 
i wont rot with the holy beast 
the grass is greener on the other side
death will welcome me
death will welcome me
i live my life by the fucking book
i'm always searching, searching for the truth
stand by your god there is nothing to fear
after death all will come clear
