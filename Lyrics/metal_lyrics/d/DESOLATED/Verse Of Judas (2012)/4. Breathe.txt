My breath is cold, my breath is fucking cold 
This is the end, this is the fucking end 
Breathe 
Mirror mirror on the wall 
Show me the light I've been searching for 
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger 
But when I die my questions are answered 
Seen the light drain from your eyes 
As I walk towards this light 
As my dreams are revealed to me 
Death's shadow sets me free 
I feel like this world's against me 
I feel like my views are tainted 
I search and I search but I get nowhere 
Spirits upon me and it's going nowhere 
Breathe 
Story begins with a man of God 
And it ends with the Reaper's hand and touch 
So fucking dark I can see your breath 
Your words blister through the cold at night 
Vision has evolved we left the past behind 
A new age of shadow and darkness 
As my breath gets slower and slower 
Everything's never felt so bliss 
As I look down from the sky 
See my body and I'm waiting to die 
Just breathe 
Mirror mirror on the wall 
Show me the light I've been searching for 
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger 
But when I die my questions are answered
