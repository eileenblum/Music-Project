You were supposed to guide me through 
You left me there to dig my grave 
You were supposed to guide me through 
I can see know light in your eyes 
And now you burn 
You are the cancer to the end of humanity 
I am the one that will resist deaths touch 
Tie me to a cross and watch me bleed 
The moral of the story is the end is foreseen 
I will burn in Hell and I will reign 
I'm on the cross wrongly accused 
I've seen the light in this darkness 
I've felt the devils grip on me 
I've seen it all this is the end 
And now I watch you burn
