This world was built on lies 
I see the hope drain from your eyes 
The is no spirit there is no serpent 
The tree of life will rot away 
I've been watching, I've been waiting 
For the world to end 
In my life I've seen you take control 
In my dreams I've seen you rise ans fall 
All I hear is purgery 
Bring forth reality 
And I'm on my knees, praying for the end 
In the name of God, I pray for the end 
Feed me lies, show me the light 
Feed me lies, in the end we all die
