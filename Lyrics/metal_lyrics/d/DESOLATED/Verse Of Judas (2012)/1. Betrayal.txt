The bottom line, there is no peace 
Only war on what we believe 

Let me preach the truth 
On reality, Breathe!

I've lived the darkest dreams 
I've felt the devil's touch 
I've heard all of your lies 
I'm sick of what you preach 
When the world comes crashing down on you 
You can run but I will fight 
I've called upon your gods 
I've cried on what you believe 
Believe 

These wounds cease to bleed 
I will never rest in peace
