Out in the dark Iâm walking
Wondering what I should do
Do you feel the same thing too?
Why the hell it isnât stopping?

âIâm the only one, the source of fear
I can make your problems disappear
All you can imagine can be real
Can get better??
But nothing in life you can get for free
One pitiful soul is the cheapest fee
Forget about them and sign the deal
Mine Forever!â

[Chorus 1:]
Canât believe my eyes
The Lord of Darkness has arrived
He comes to take my soul
Leading me into temptation
I must not believe his lies
Never did, I never tried
His heart is black and cold
Pushing me into my own damnation

Iâm the master of my own path
Thereâs nothing you can really do
I would never work for you
I must face the devilâs wrath

âI cannot stand this insolence
I must break you with violence
Can you even imagine what all this means?
Pain Forever!!
Pitiful mortal, I will crush your face
Youâre just nothing but a big disgrace
Can you even imagine what all this means?
Die forever!!â

[Chorus 1]

[Solos]

[Chorus 2:]
Canât believe my eyes
The Lord of Darkness has confined
My one and only soul
Leading me into temptation
Now I want to believe his lies
Always did, I always tried
My heart is black and cold
I was looking for my own damnation
