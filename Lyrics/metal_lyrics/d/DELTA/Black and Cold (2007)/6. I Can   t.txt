Carry me back
To the begining of my life
When problems were away
When emotions were not wild

Why did you do this to me?
Why? If you know my kind
I know it was just an accident
But Iâm not that blind

I can see arround me
People killing each others
But my fingers werenât so bad
I just want to sing with my hands

[Chorus]
Youâve said you know nothing
But you have so many faces
You really know how
To stick a knife in my back

My life became nothing
Because Iâve lost my voices
I just want to play my guitar
But I canât!
