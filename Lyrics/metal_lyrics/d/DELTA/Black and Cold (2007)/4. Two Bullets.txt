What the hell has happened?
I canât believe my eyes
Why did you betray me?
I work hard for you all day

I hear someoneâs laughter
Please tell me no more lies
You belong only to me
Iâll make him fade away

I will get my gun and make sure that nothing stays like this
My heart is filled with vengeance you must pay for all your sins

[Chorus:]
Hey, two bullets will just work fine for me
One bullet for you and one for him
Don worry I'll do it fast
Iâll only turn your body into dust!

So how much anger you can see?
My blood is burning all my skin
Don worry I'll do it fast
Iâll only turn your body into dust!

Why have you forgotten?
All the great times we had
Or you weâre only acting?
To take all away from me

Do I gave you affection?
Guess it wasnât enough for you
Your lust was your answer
Our marriage has gone to hell

I will get my gun and make sure that nothing stays like this
My heart is filled with vengeance you must pay for all your sins

[Chorus]
