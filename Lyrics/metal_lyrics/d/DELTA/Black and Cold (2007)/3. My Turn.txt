Arriving to the battlefield
I can smell fear from miles away
Itâs too late for me
No turning back
No one can save me from this bloody hell!

Lady Deathâs job has begun
To hate is the only way to survive
Is this the end?
Confusionâs everywhere
Just want to leave this Godâs forsaken place

[Chorus:]
Fire and destruction will lead you to pain
Watching your children fight to death
Today youâll take your last breath
I beg for forgiveness for all that Iâve done
âCause certainly hell is what I will have
For taking their lives, is my turn now

When I was just running back
An enemyâs bullet came from behind
Ran out of Luck
I feel her cold dead hand
Sheâs taking my life to another land

[Chorus]

[Solos and shit]

[Chorus x2]
