Here I go again
Fighting to make through the day
Cannot play this game
Thereâs too much to lose at stake
I can take no more this bitterness
Iâm slowly losing consciousness
Everything is just turning into a living hell

Being treated like a slave
Itâs like being inside a cave
Without a damn way out
And nobody around
Iâve just got to plan my own revenge

[Chorus:]
Iâm your master
Your disaster
For I will now rule your life

I must put an end to this
Making justice by my fist
I donât want a salary
Honor works just fine for me
Take that back you worthless scum
I will see you going down
