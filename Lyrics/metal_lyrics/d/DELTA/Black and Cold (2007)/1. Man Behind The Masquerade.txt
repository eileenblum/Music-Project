How Unfortunate!
Canât be part of this damn fate
How does heaven turns to hell?
I am terrified
All my dreams and hopes have died
Mesmerized!
Iâve just got to find my way out
The only thing I want is to cry loud

Killer fears
Shedding Tears
I just want to go to that place
Painful times
Deceiving lies
Cannot find a way to escape
Losing faith
Growing Pain
Canât destroy this fucking holding cage
Big Disgrace
How I Became?
Iâm the man behind the masquerade

Lies are useful tools
All your friends are stupid fools
They donât know what they are missing
No, my friend, Iâm not just dreaming
But then, I see the truth
I cannot pull this charade through
I must go on, it keeps me sane
Oh my God Iâm fading away!

Losing faith
Growing Pain
Canât destroy this fucking holding cage
Big Disgrace
How I Became?
Iâm the man behind the masquerade

But then Iâm here again
Inside my own confining cell
I will take the whole damn blame
I promise no more lies
Cannot break the chain that binds
Need your help!
Give me all your confidence again
So I can regret and fly away

Killer fears
Shedding Tears
I just want to go to that place
Painful times
Deceiving lies
Cannot find a way to escape
Losing faith
Growing Pain
Canât destroy this fucking holding cage
Big Disgrace
How I Became?
Iâm the man behind the masquerade
