We were so united
Remained undivided
No one will take away those moments full of joy

But I guess that never
Things last forever
We just forgot that we are only Godâs toys

[Chorus 1:]
Why did you die?
Why you didnât stay?
Canât understand why youâre away
Did he make you lose this whole damn fight?

Listen to me, my friend
A message to you I send
It was my fault I hope someday youâll understand

[Chorus 2 (x2):]
I never cared
I wasnât even scared
Cannot forget that goddamned day
Just forgot that your own lifeâ¦ hangs on a thread

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
