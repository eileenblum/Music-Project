When passion is lost
and all truth is gone
(all truth is gone)
Way too far
For so long
We're turning away
Away from the name...

Away from the storm
Cause we are through
The meaning of the wounds of all...

Tears of blood
Are falling (into the sea)
Deep inside
Right on the bottom
Of our hearts

Words of corruption
Minds of war must be dead
Slay them all
And make their souls
Sleep in the dust of eternal war.

Apollyon is free
Apollyon is free again
Apollyon is free
Inside of me.

Now chaos is here
Playing with our fears
(Playing with our fears)
Survival sense
All solutions turn egocentric

We're turning away
Away from the name...

Away from the storm
Cause we are trough
The meaning of the wounds of all...

Tears of blood
Are falling (into the sea)
Deep inside
Right on the bottom
Of our hearts

Words of corruption
Minds of war must be dead
Slay them all
And make their souls
Sleep in the dust of eternal war.

Apollyon is free
Apollyon is free again
Apollyon is free
Inside of me.

[Poem: ]
"The human race is going to perish with their own hands, and the kingdom of loneliness will appear.
Destruction will be everywhere and death will arise
with silence, at the less expected places.
Houses will stay up, but there will be none to live in them,
because there is no other sunrise,
because there is no other life."
