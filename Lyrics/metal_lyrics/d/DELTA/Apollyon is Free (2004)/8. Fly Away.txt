Stop please,
I can't wait anymore,
Inner pain I have,
External end will come.
My friends,
are still blinded by gold,
see their sadness,
see their weakness.

Now conclusion and conviction,
I need force and some of wisdom,
Then I'll find the best solution,
To destroy this rare illusion.

I will fight now to defeat you,
Step aside and let me focus,
Stay behind the deepest abyss,
You the sixth, Apollyon Angel.

Thank you,
For making me grow up,
For making me think about things,
For finding the way I need.

You are here,
The shining star is here,
This is my reason to be,
This is my way to live

The time has ended for all reflexion,
I must be away from all temptation,
Temptation, word of no salvation,
Destruction of all creation.

I will fight now to defeat you,
Step aside and let me focus,
Stay behind the deepest abyss,
You the sixth, Apollyon Angel.

Now that I have got my wings,
I will fly across the sea,
I need to fly,
Fly far away,
Away from you,
And face the truth.
