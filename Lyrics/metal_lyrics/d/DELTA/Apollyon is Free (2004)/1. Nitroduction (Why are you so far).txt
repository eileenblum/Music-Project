I used to have a simple life
Every morning was an endless shine
But it was only a lie.
My days were all the same
And nothing seemed to change
"Go home and sleep,
Wake up and repeat"

[Chorus:]
Oh meaning of life
Why are you so far?
Far away like a shining star
Show some mercy and keep me alive

Now I feel numb and lost
Wandering just like a ghost
I need to find the way
The way to break this hell
It's like a witch's spell
"Go home and sleep,
Wake up and repeat".

[Chorus]
Oh meaning of life
Why are you so far?
Far away like a shining star
Show some mercy and keep me alive
