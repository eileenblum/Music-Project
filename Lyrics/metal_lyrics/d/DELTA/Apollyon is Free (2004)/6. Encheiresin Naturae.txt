Sun turns just like his elders did
Taking part in the mystic songs of spheres
Where the path shows you the opened side of the spirit,
Where his glance gives force to the angels,
When no one else could understand,
That his great eyes were the light of the sun.
The furious storm makes the impetuous chain.
Of the circle, circle that turns into mystery
All in earth is hateful,
The devil shows mercy to all men,
In their misery, like an art,
It's time to confess, it's time to confess,
Bloody men, the illness that brings us...
The Faustus...

I want to lead you to men.
I want to lead you to nothing.
I want to lead you...
I want to lead you to men.
I want to lead you to nothing.
I want to lead you...

The man only gets lost when he is searching himself in the darkness,
The man only gets lost when he is searching his life, eternal life...
