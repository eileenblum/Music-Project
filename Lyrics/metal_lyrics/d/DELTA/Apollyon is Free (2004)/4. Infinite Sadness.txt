Falling so deep
in my dreams
I wish peace. 
I scream by plead
to our life
life unfair

Tears,
Pain,
Fear,
the words of my mind

Rage
Blood
Scream
Call of the wild

Please come here,
And take all my human flesh
Sacrifice of all my fears and sins
Please, just show me the way

Flying so far
I get lost
I'm nowhere

Coward and weak
I became
after my escape

Tears,
Pain,
Fear,
the words of my mind

Rage
Blood
Scream
call of the wild

Please come here,
And take all my human flesh
Sacrifice of all my fears and sins
Please, just show me the way
