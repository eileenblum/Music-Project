Sometimes I feel alone,
Sometimes I must be strong,
Sometimes I can't see,
Anything around me,
Only lies come alive,
Watching only through my mind,
I'm alone, all alone,
That's not true,
I'll see all by my own.

Angel of the forest,
Are you standing in the sands of time?
Help me to open my eyes,
Oh please, I need to see...

Show me the truth,
I need to know the other side,
Now that I can see,
All it's clear for me,
My wish is complete.

A labyrinth without end,
This is new and makes me scared,
The truth is sad, and makes me ill,
But it's ok, I must be strong,

It's too difficult to understand
In my position someone else would die
Don't be afraid, don't look back
Don't run away, you can't hide so long

Angel of the forest
Are you standing in the sands of time?
Help me to open my eyes
Oh please, I need to see...

Show me the truth
I need to know the other side
Now that I can see
All it's clear for me
My wish is complete.
