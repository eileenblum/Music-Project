My thoughts collide
A strange emotion within myself

I hear its voice
I have no choice
I need to surrender to its spell

Feels right, oh yeah!

Whatâs wrong with me?
I could not see
What made me think those evil deeds?

I need to find
What dwells inside?
I wonât fulfill its needs

No one knows the way I feel
Just going mad
No one dares to speak to me
Stop mistreating me, I beg you please

[Chorus:]
Leave me be, who do you think you are
Controlling me, betraying me
Changed the line between the good and bad
I honestly donât know just who I amâ¦ (Anymore)

Do as I say
You must obey
Oh canât you see, you are a part of me
Just realize
Your own demise
No one can save you now

No one knows the way I feel
Stop mistreating me, I beg you please

[Chorus 2:]
Leave me be, who do you think you are
Controlling me, betraying me
Changed the line between the good and bad
I honestly donât know just who I am
Everyday is like another war
I just donât know to which side I belong
It doesnât matter if Iâm near or far
I honestly donât know just who I am
