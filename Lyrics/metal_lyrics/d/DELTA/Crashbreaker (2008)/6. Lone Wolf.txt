I swore to stay forever
Must go on this endeavor
Doesnât matter how I try
Thereâs nothing I can say
Myself I canât betray

[Bridge:]
This is my story
How I touch the glory
Never-ending loneliness

[Chorus:]
âCause Iâm a Lone wolf
I donât have a home
I live my life on the road
Having nowhere to go
âCause Iâm a Lone wolf
I learned to survive
Whatever to stay alive
My place to rest is what I need to find

Walking down along the way
I try to find the answers
That led me into this madness
But this way I choose to stay
My singing is the weapon
That will take me into heaven

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

I cannot die
I will do anything for glory
This is my curse
This is my way

[Chorus]
