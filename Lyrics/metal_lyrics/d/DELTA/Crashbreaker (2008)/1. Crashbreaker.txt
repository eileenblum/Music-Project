Thereâs nothing left to do
Just donât ask me how
Could be me or it could be you
Just the car, the road and me
Iâm feeling now the need
To hit the gas, the boost and get the hell away from here

[Bridge 1:]
I donât want
To obey the rules
So let me ride
And live fast

If you cross the line
Iâll take you down
Destroy your whole life

And Iâm never gonna stop

[Chorus:]
Iâm the maniac of the road
Dominator of them all
A perfect day for a violent race
Hellsinger
Painbringer

Destruction is my goal
You walk down through the losersâ hall
Thereâs no room for second place
Un-maker
Crashbreaker

Iâm addicted to the sound
Of a heavy massive crash
OH yeah it feels so loud
Can hear your suspension smash
I donât mind about traffic jams
Just drive on the oncoming lane
And hit the gas, the boost and get the hell away from there

[Bridge 2:]
If you cross the line
Iâll take you down
Destroy your whole life

And Iâm never gonna stop

[Chorus]

Till the end of time
