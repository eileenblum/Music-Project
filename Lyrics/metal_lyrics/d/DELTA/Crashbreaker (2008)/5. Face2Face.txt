My loud cry will shake the ground
Sick and tired of your arrogance
I couldnât bear any more I had to make a stand
Had enough of being afraid
I will make you regret all the things you said

[Bridge:]
So you will face me?
Get ready for it
No hesitation
I will make you fall

[Chorus:]
You earned the fury of my fist my friend I know youâll cry
What did you expect to find? Youâre forcing me to fight you face to face
Why donât you shout your mouth? I bet you wouldnât even try
There is no turning back, thereâs nowhere to escape

So will you cry for help?
So youâre calling all your friends?
News flash for you my friend,
I donât care how many I have to face
You know my fuel is my rage
No one can stop me now I have to raise some hell

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

You earned the fury of my fist my friend I know youâll cry
What did you expect to find? Youâre forcing me to fight you face to face
There is no turning back, thereâs nowhere to escape
