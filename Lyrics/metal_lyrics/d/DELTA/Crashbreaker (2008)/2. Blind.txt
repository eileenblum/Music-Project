Sickness controls your whole body
I know how to restore your well-being
Itâs useless you canât live without me

Thereâs no way, you cannot withstand
I know you got used to the feeling
Now itâs time for you to understand
Your urges are the ones who are pulling the strings

[Chorus 1:]
I, cannot believe it
My inner demons are pulling me down
Did not foreseen it
Will someone tell me why I was soâ¦

So sick and tired of my desire
I will take what itâs mine
I was born free to decide

[Chorus 2:]
I cannot believe it
My inner demons are pulling me down
I did not foreseen it
Will someone tell me why I was so blind?
Cannot conceive it
You were the one who was bringing me down
I did not foreseen it
Will someone tell me why I was so blind?

[Chorus 2]
