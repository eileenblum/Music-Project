Black lady come to me
I want to go astray
Desire within me
A guide to my decay
I know that youâll be gone
When night becomes a day
You yawned when I claimed love
Turned back and walked away

I call out your name
With no reply at all
Another pawn in your game
Meets his darkest fall
Iâve lost all my faith
My soul goes into stall
Maybe I am the eighth
That knocks at your back door

I want to feel again
That pleasant strawberry haze
Maybe Iâve gone insane
The devilâs dancer caught me
Enticed me, and fooled me
Again and again and again

Into the night she comes
And suddenly she strikes
Another fool has fallen into her
And when the time is right
She leaves you far behind
Desperation feeling in your mind

I want to feel again
That pleasant strawberry haze
Maybe Iâve gone insane
The devilâs dancer caught me
Why donât you dance all night?
Letâs step out of the light
Entice me, and fool me
Again and again and again

I want to feel again
That pleasant strawberry haze
Maybe Iâve gone insane
The devilâs dancer caught me
Why donât you dance all night?
Letâs step out of the light
I wan to feel alright
The devilâs dancer caught me
Enticed me, fooled me
Again, and again and again
