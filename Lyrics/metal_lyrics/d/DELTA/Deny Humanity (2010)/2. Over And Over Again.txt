Look into my eyes
Through my disguise, please enter
[please come in]
Not a castle, nor gold
Look how my honour keeps fading
[fading]

Running away
From the end of the road
I'm screaming [screaming]
Calling out your name
Promises being forsaken [forsaken]

What am I waiting for?
Look what I have done...

Because I'm meant to lie
Because my soul will die
There's no salvation
This is my ending

Because I've lost your trust
Our dreams turned into dust
My word is worthless
Alone and hopeless
Lost and senseless

Come and play again!

Crying out loud
My mind ask now for forgiveness
I made up my mind
I'm gonna burn all this nonsense
See hell in yourself
The pain from what I've created
From tears and laments
You sorrow needs to be ended

Look what I have done...

Because I'm meant to lie
Because my soul will die
There's no salvation
This is my ending

Because I've lost your trust
Our dreams turned into dust
My word is worthless
Alone and hopeless

Because you wanna try
Because you think I can
I'm gonna make it
I'm gonna face it

I'm living on my own
Until the final dawn
Leave all resentment
There's no replacement
Doubts are fading

Come and play again!
