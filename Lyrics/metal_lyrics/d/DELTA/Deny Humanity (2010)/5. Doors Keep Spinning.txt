I look outside my window
And see how things are said and done
Oh helplessness is what I feel
And then I start to wonder
If law is based on a smoking gun
Oh everything seems so unreal

Tell me now
Is there justice?
Canât allow
So disgusting
Disavow
Nothing matters they are masters
Help us someone

I desire
A new life
No sorrow
Why cannot they disappear?
If the system works
I canât believe that
I still watch them
Walk the road
Give drugs to my friends
The doors keep spinning

Installing electric fences
And cameras everywhere
Transforming into a big fortress
I canât see the light of day
Iâm putting up my defenses
Protecting the land I swear
Avoiding all kind of trouble
We canât live this way
