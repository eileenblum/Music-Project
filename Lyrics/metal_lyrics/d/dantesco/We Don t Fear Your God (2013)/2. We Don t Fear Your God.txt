From the beginning when the serpent was young 
We raised and feed this land 
Tribes from the east and clans from the north 
Emerge from nations collide 
Sent by our gods.Followed by the light 
Born the children of the sun 
Centuries passed,conquerors came 
And every battle we won 
-sunrise 
-our eyes 
-our hearts-we don't fear your god 
-we came 
-from far 
-up high-we don't fear your god 
-with blood 
-with fire 
-sacrifice-we Don fear your god 
-you came 
-you'll die 
-by our hand-we don't fear your god 
Sunrise the giver of life,our eyes and the beat of out hearts 
From ancient times we sailed the air.We came from far up high 
No god from your kingdom,no son sacrificed.No cross not even a hell 
Will turn into surrender,the flight of the serpent 
Or the taste for revenge 
--seven tribes in exodus 
--from a land called Aztlan 
--mexicas 
--nomads 
--found the promised land
Triple alliance.Powerful land 
The mexicas on command 
Warriors of light,in the name of the sun 
Hunting lords of sacrifice 
The moon and her sisters the stars 
Killed their mother 
Her son everynight-sunrise-sacrificed his sisters 
Sunrise 
Our eyes 
We came 
From far 
We take as an honor to die in the fight 
Our blood ,tears from the sky 
The head of your priest at the stairs of the temple-sacrifice-our fists held high 
Tomorrow the vultures will dance with the dogs...Did your god,sent you to hell? 
Try all your prayers,demand your salvation,as i take your heart from your chest! 
-sunrise 
-our eyes 
-our hearts-we don't fear your god 
-we came 
-from far 
-up high-we don't fear your god 
-with blood 
-with fire 
-sacrifice-we Don fear your god 
-you came 
-you'll die 
-by our hand-we don't fear your god [2x]
