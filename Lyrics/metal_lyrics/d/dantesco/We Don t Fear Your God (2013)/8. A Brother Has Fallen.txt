What are you doing here my son?
It's not your time yet
The gates of Valhalla are open
Awaiting your dawn
But... not... now
Your hall will be ready soon
Come my son and rest

Silent the dead took my breath
I have left my brothers, out of time
Darkness came as a raven
Eats the eyes of a soulless piece of icy flesh... ah

Tears to fill the sea
Were falling from the eyes of my mother
The falcon from inside my chest
Now fly away from her
From the clouds and over the mountains
I can see her crying for me
I will ever be remembered
As a warrior... as a man

For the tears of my mother... vengeance
For the brother I left alone
For the crying of my little sister
For my father and for my soul
For the killer of every sunshine
That my body will feel no more
For the assassin of all the places
Where my spirit will never go
For the wounds that marked the triumph
Of the dead over the lion's roar
The slayer of the last of dragons...
Of the last of the unicorns
May death take your life with patience
And a living torture be your punishment
And your suffering will have no answer
When your painful flesh cries for death

Come... my brother... and rest...
