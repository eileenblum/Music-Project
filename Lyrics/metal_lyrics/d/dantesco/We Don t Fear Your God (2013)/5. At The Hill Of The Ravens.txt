Come ye all my friends
And see the dance of my enemies, dressed in blood
Be my guest... feed the vultures seeds on the hill of the ravens

Have you received your invitation?
To dance at the corpses ball?
Crusaders and warriors of the temple
Our axes and hammers at the host

Frozen swords buried in the ground
Flesh and blood, supper for the hounds
A triumph of death again
Let their children see this fest

Awakening of the dawn
Morning of thousands of suns
Souls of sinners
Souls of saints
Blood of martyrs
For the kings

The smell of the carrion covers the hill
A legion of dogs on their way... hunting the pest
Hundreds of swords on the ground... orphaned steel
And warriors in pieces... forever laid to rest

Awakening of the dawn
Morning of thousands of suns
Souls of sinners
Souls of saints
Blood of martyrs
For the kings

Burn the heroes
Like a bird, their dreams
Fly from darkness to eternity
At the hill of the ravens, I will be the sun
At the hill of the ravens, my spirits dawn
