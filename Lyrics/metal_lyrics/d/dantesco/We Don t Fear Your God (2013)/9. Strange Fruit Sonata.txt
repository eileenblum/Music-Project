The raging melodies
Are the prelude to the madness
The morbid harmonies
Crescendo of death

Cameratta in extremis
Concerto armatto
Strange fruit sonata
On "el salado"

The fruits hang from the trees
Letting their seeds paint the soil in red
A choir of children screaming
As the suffering guest

Cameratta in extremis
Concerto armatto
Strange fruit sonata
On "el salado"

Rodrigo Tovar
Jorge Cuarenta
In front of the fest
Bloody maestro

Timpani heads
Bayonet concerto
Symphonic hell
Forte struendo

Mother's aria for soprano
Her son hangs from a tree
Horror song accompanied by the piano
And the Bolivar chorus of screams

Atrocity in excelsis
At the doors of the temple
Duetto of terror and misery
And the colombin army ensemble

Polyphonic the cries
From the concerto's survivors
This theater was the site
Of the last circus Romano

Cameratta in extremis
Concerto armatto
Strange fruit sonata
On "el salado"
