I dreamed one day, I was dying
Then I awoke and with a smile I saw the sun
In another dream I was drowning
Endless the sea, raging waters of the dark

My eyes... now I see
Through the fog and through the night
My life... don't feel
There's no sadness, there's no fear and there's no light

Return to hell
Now I'm part of the dark
Return to hell
For my soul, you don't need to fight

I will live to sin
And the master will be guide
Now... I believe
There's a king, and he will be my life

And the promise of a heaven
Will never move my heart
I am water of the river
I am soil of the land
I'm the shine of the moonlight
And the center of the sun

I'm the soul of the forest
I'm the crying of the wolf
I'm the color of the flowers
I'm the power of the wind
And the roar behind the thunder
The horizon of the fields

Return to hell
Now I'm part of the dark
Return to hell
For my soul, you don't need to fight

And the hope of a heaven
Will never move my heart
Angel of another level
Only master of mankind
