My victims will be the sacrifice
For the blood of the martyrs
I am the slayer of souls in the name of the cross

My night is the darkest of nights
Angel full of anger
Heretics or heroes no matter, by my sword they will fall

All the blood that has been spilled over the head of the saints
Each thorn from his crown will pass through the heart of the innocent
The tears of the virgin will be washed with the pain of their children
And the spirit white bird fly over the mountains of pain

Fly as the angel who's cavalry's name is black death
Full desolation will cover your life and your quest
The sins of the liar with the power of his golden throne
The keeper of fire the symbol of their god and his son

Remember the fall of the angel
Heretics, each one eats from his hand
Over his land

Pain and his root spreads the seeds of damnation
Rising from the ashes of their sins
Vengeance will consume the heart of this man
Gold diggers, the demons from the temple
Unfaithful is the light of the church

Living in hell
Hunting and killing on command, for the needs of these libertines
The toll to pay is the blood of the martyrs
And salvation of the souls in my hands
Abominations of witchery are the charges
Everything to calm the fears of the priest

Killing in the name of the trinity
Hunting pagans, enemies of their god
Magic and other rites of blasphemy
Satan worshipers, the chalice of blood

Die, die
Lie, lie
Die, beast
Cry, cry

At dawn my eyes look to the horizon
Nails in my heart for the blood of that night
Covered in black by the church and its power
Giver of pain, for which god do I fight?

Die, die
Lie, lie
Die, beast
Cry, cry

To Christ I will pay a tribute and become the assassin of pure men
Loyal to the pope and the priests of the king of the reign of liars
In the name of the father, the blood of the sun and the fall of the spirit
And the slave, became the sword of the keeper of fire
