The wings of the darkness
The eyes of the black
The mask and disguise of your soul
Torment of warriors
Slayer of light
Assassin of brothers for a toll
Bringer of the fire from hell

Mercenary of their god - liar
Mercenary of their god - betrayer

Obey your only master
Golden as the temple of your god
Taken by my men and their anger
As an eagle awaiting the dawn

Mercenary of their god - liar
Mercenary of your god - betrayer

Cry for your people
Cry for your clan
The eyes of your children
Will be served with your blood
Your mother... Your sister
And your woman are gone

[Solo]

Mercenary of your god - liar
Mercenary of your god - betrayer
Mercenary of your god - traitor
Mercenary of your god - betrayer

Cry for your brothers
Cry for your soul
