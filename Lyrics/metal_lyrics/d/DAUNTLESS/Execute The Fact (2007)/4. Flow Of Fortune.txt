The engine runs on profit
it has to be well-oiled
Obstacles keep on coming
but you'll never see it fall

Pure solid gold
they offer for your soul
Sign here, let's make a deal?

Accept - Adjust - Obey
Earn your life constrained
Denied to think at all
it just slows down your work rate

You think their deals are fair
they only grow their market share
Their goal is to collect
every dollar they can get

What lies behind the walls
corrupted ways of mind
They lead their troops to glory
greed keeps them blind
