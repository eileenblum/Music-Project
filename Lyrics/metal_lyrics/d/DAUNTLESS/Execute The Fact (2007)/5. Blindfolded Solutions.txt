Fixing things that have some flaws
only generates problems that will grow
Nature beats intelligence
it won't give you a second chance

The mistakes are repeated around the globe
what is left is only childish hope
Devastating effects with our every breath
logic that man can never get

No one can control the effect
Problem - Solution - Revenge

From the throne of creation
the earth will strike you down
it will make you admit
one battle you win
but the war you'll lose

The solution to make all problems fade
will always be too complicated
The main reason why it's a hopeless fight
is the lack of human foresight
