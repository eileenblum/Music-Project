Forces of the doomed land
a battle that got out of hand
to the end they stand

Exaggerated revolution takes your life

Tanks are roaring, the earth quakes
Soldiers march in a good faith
the rage of war they'll face

Hide your face and throw the bottle
flames are burning down your land
From the ruins freedom rises
after everything is lost

In their minds the battle haunts
after the bodies have been counted
and then more will be found

Exaggerated revolution takes your life

Motivation vanished
gunfire pierced their bodies
The enemy will punish

Face to face with the enemy
you aim and it fails
Face to face with the enemy
your final breath you take
