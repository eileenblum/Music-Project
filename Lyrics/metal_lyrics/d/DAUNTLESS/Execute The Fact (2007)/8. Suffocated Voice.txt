Harvest

Leaders and their followers
they plant the seed of hate
give them all your money left
Relax, enjoy the show

Blood unites without a fight
the truth is in the box
Shoot them all in the neck
we all must play a part

Do your daily work, no need to be concerned
Don't ask how many years still left
just vote for death

Our nature craves for war
Gather your troops and execute the world

Suffocated voice beyond your idiot box
screen after screen you fail to
read between the lines
