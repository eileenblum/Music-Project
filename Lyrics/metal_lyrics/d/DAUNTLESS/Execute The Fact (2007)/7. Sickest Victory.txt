Inside the shelter's walls
detonating thoughts of chaos
Kneeling down before their gods
armed and ready to explode
Soon will be their time to show
the hate they feel you can't ignore

Levels go from green to red
steel and flesh cutting through the air
One sick mind who's not afraid of death
Higher forces decide their fate
suicides display their rage
The only way to survive is to run away

All hail the glory of sickness
hiding and bleeding you'll see it

"Drain the blood from their veins,
they are the enemy - the enemy of the faith"

Hand-tailored vest filled with explosives
- five kilos of nails
Target in sight, too late to escape

All hail the glory of sickness
hiding and bleeding you'll feel it

Blood and stones are raining from the sky
pressure breaking walls and window glass
One man got sickest victory
blameless dreams were shattered violently
