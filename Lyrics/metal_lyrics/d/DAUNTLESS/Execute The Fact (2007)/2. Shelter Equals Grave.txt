The construction of the shelter
went the way it was planned
Steel-reinforced concrete
proved to be the choice

Half-ton armored door
double-latch locks
air-filtration systems
not a single window

Bury yourself

Shelves groan under
the weight of food supplies
Ready for the terror
Ready and armed

No use for a handgun
against the enemy front
AK-47
offers no comfort

The roof is getting closer
walls begin to shake
It has become reality
buried in a global war

Sensors are moving
lights blink like hell
No transmission
in the radio

Monitors go blank
air pressure changes
When lights turns to red
shelter equals grave
