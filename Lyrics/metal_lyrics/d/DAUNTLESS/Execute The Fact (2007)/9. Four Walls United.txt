After they have built their walls
they want something more
Safety must be guaranteed
Comfort is number one
The need for nuclear power
will grow every hour

Sickness hits when body weakens
it's normal, you'll be fine
no need to go outside
When organs start to hurt
and you don't know what to do
take the red one
it's not the white one's turn

Hallucination takes over
it says you must obey
No safer place where to escape
No system restore point
Brighter future - make a choice
press 'OK' to cancel
Obey - Erase - Obey
