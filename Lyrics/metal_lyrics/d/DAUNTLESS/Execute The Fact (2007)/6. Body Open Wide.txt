Shocked by the stress
mess in my head
Finding out a way
to express
thoughts against
my enemies
Crowd it on me
I'm done

Dim is the light
the light of life

As the make me live
they make me give
Dismissed humanity
Endless possibilities

Just found a way
I kill - they pay
I'm on the road
to success
I take what's mine
wrong or right
Everything they had gone

When living turned to hate
revenge made me insane
Values of life
in a body open wide
