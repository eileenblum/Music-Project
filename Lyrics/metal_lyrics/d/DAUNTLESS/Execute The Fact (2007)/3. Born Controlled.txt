No dead spots, every corner covered
high definition tools to record every
movement made
In the dark, night vision keeps it sharp
birth, life and death filed

All different, all equally controlled
follow the orders, do your part
Only one warning
walk the same line
deny your own thoughts

Deny your thoughts

Their mission is to own your life
They rate your status and your price

Born controlled
Face the fact that you
were born controlled

The satellites that circulate the earth
regulate the way you see it
suffocated world
Under the watchful eye
you are just a number
