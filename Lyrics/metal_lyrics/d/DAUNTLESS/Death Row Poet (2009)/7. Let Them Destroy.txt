Their wealth in unity
Give them what they want
They will destroy themselves
And burn the world

They will decide their own fate
Let them destroy, tear down it all
They will never look back
Leaders, deceivers
Chaotic mass-murder reign

Reign of inhumanity
The joy and the despair
No control, no mystic saviours
Just another violent behaviour

Corrupt - power of people corrupt
Erupt - mountain of greed will erupt

Discipline went away
Disorder came to stay
Three ways to see another day of hope
Attack survival defence

Greed will take over the holiest man
Power of people corrupt
Tear down it all
