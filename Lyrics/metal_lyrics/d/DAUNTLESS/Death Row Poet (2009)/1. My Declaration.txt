All we have to do is written down here
We'll penetrate the system from inside
You will be the core
The social system is going down

Break the habits
Control your life
Take down their statues
Worship no more their lies

Burn the flags
Cross the lines

Revolution starts from here
The walls that have been built
Will now be hammered down

Discipline went away
New order came to stay
Disconnect, devastate, recreate

Cowards
You fuckers
C'mon
Hear my word

Our nature craves for war
Spread the word of violent behaviour
I'll control it all
Walk by my side

We all need something for the sickness
Relieving the nation's undertow
Choose the path of evolution
Clench your fist and raise your head up
