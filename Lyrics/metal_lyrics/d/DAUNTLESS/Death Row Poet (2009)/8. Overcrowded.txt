All places are overcrowded
Decent life you thought you'll have
Is buried under mountains of trash

We're born - we gain greed - we're born
We spread around and breed

Wake up and take a look inside your life
Useless and hollow
What's the use, no future in sight
Consume and devour

More and more you think you need
Soon there is no room to live
Realizing is the final call
In a world like a self-made bomb

Suffering is the way you choose
When you fuck and reproduce
Earth's limits are closing on
You will care when the day has come

Our way of life - overcrowded inside
