You paid fortunes for things that don't exist
Sold possessions you never had

Excessive, extreme desire
The wealth, the funds and fortune
Whatever increases it's value
Inhale, exhale, exchange

The world that was built on trust
Had its way of leaving you out
And we - in this chaos, we found ourselves
Standing against all that you created

Just scroll down the list now
You will reach the bottom line
What you gained wasn't worth the loss

And the world goes around

Look after your own good, make everyone suffer
You lost your grip of morality
Still think it's worth it?

See, there are things that can't be compensated
You lost your grip of humanity
Still think it's worth it?
