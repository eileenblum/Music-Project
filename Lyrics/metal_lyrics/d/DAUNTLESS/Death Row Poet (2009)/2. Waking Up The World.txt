Release me!
As defendant here I stand
Guilty as charged - yes I am
The things I did were meant to be
To open your eyes and make you see

No regrets!
Every violent deed I did wasn't justified
But sometimes it's the only way to go
Global anarchy - the source of energy
Will make my statement heard
And wake up this sleeping world

Fake smile on bleached teeth
Shallow world of a shallow man
The weight of all your sins
Shreds scars beyond the skin

"None are more hopelessly enslaved
Than those who falsely believe they are free"
[Goethe]

Wake up the world with me
And untie these hands of liberation

The justice is gone - the war is on
