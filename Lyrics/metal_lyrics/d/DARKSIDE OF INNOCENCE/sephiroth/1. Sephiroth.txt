Rid yourself from the seductive lust
Soreness' so real, meaningless it's not.
That I raised thou with care, have you forgot?

For we are as one [3x].

Her very last plea to unchain a stream of compassion
Before the sentient kinds like yours
Mine very last plea to unchain a stream of compassion
Before the sentient kinds like yours

Mother of light, don't let oblivion embrace us, Mother!
Mother of light, liberate us from this blight

You shall mark my words,
For she is the mother of all lights
My guiding star...

And I won't let it go,
I won't let it go of you
