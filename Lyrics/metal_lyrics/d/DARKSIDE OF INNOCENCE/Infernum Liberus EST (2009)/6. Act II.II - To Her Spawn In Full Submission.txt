[Narration line:]
âImpelled by cruelty, Aneonâs infernal black seed,
As complement, born was this misled child that sighed in miseryâ

And how cursed she dreamt
Silently wandering among the damned
Whilst an horrible drama enlightens
They slightly ablaze, in a chaotic plight

Seared she dwelled to cast oblivion
Ruined, as Laila ought to reign in chaos
An agonized tormento for the empire of Gods

[Character speech - people:]
"Oh dear goddess Sophia
Spare us by the hallowed mercy of yours!
From this endless devastation
Write anew our fate to a peaceful course..."

And with smeared blooded hands
To thy holiness we faithfully vow

Whilst her, Oâ empress of mine
As a bright shadow flew onto unseen
Just barely
Barely like thy heretic queen!

[Narration line:]
âCompletely in remission, who speaks rash of vagrancy
Diabolically unleashed, so it may fulfil his legacy
Perverse submission that feeds his fantasies
Shall it be accompanied by hellion symphonies?â

It is thy wish, to again never return
Instead, may thy eyelids before our soreness
Just remain...
Remain closed at once?
