Swore to thy unholy majestyâs hollow burnt within
Share a whole bloodshed banquet, so little is the whim
To empower their unhallowed mother
Dweller of darkness which virally spawned
A gilded pedestal to crown her enthrone, Amazed they vowed
Deity in evilness from one, whoâs in glamorous cruelty
Delighted all men in a lustful feast

Hallucination grew from a slander, unreal he witched
Carving scent, of this lunar lament, the maligned eyed beast

Above the vast nocturnal sky engulfed by hell,
Engraved in restless memories, lies the ultimate crest
All mighty she proclaimed herself, wicked, reviled this mistress
Whisperer to her consul that prays undead

Onto their mere presences, unpleasant such a divined malady
Oh submission! That shall so engendered, charm them with vile purity?

Above the vast nocturnal sky engulfed by hell,
Engraved in restless memories, lies the ultimate crest
All mighty she proclaimed herself, wicked, reviled this mistress
Whisperer to her consul that prays undead:

[Character Speech - Laila:]
âMisled by my own hatred, forthcoming the tragic extinguish in erst,
All of them tied: VÃ¡lia melted down for the emergent ember
...of a cursed dawn eclipsedâ
