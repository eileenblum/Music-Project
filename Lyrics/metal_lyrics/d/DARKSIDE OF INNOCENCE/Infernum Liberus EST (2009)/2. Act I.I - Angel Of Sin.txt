Blinded eyes were mine
To foresee the unsought sign
Even as devilish, I wept
Darkness shattered a truth, I kept

This unravelled reminiscence
Displease the depths in my conscience
At the eclipse of a winter sun
Was I betrayed by the evil-eyed one?

Now, I lay here
Under my black wings of despair
These single tears
Burn like an intense mournful flare

Sophiaâs exquisite requiem played tonight
The iniquity of angels prevail at her sight

Ascendancy, Lailaâs undesired destiny
Lost forever more amidst this veiled infinity

Now, I lay here
Under my black wings of despair
These single tears
Burn like an intense mournful flare
Redeem myself
From all my damned sins
On the way âtill redemption
Of an Angel brought by withering wings
On the way âtill redemption
Of an Angel brought by withering wings

Against an infernal lust I became wroth
Now that by blight, misled I am not
Awoken Iâve been;
In mourning filled with blankness

Rebirth anew for a glorious dawn
To a gilt head age
No longer a sinner,
No longer fooled

Now, I lay here
Under my black wings of despair
These single tears
Burn like an intense mournful flare
Redeem myself
From all my damned sins
On the way âtill redemption
Of an Angel brought by withering wings
On the way âtill redemption
Of an Angel brought by withering wings
