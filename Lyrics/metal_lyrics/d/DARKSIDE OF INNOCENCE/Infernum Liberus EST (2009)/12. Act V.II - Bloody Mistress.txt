Her solitude in thousand cruel memories
An unblessed evil voice, which devoured thy soul
Summoned forth deadly bloody whispers
Oh mine!
An angel that fell
My diabolic creature who
Swelled their Eden with hell

Even the strongest heart
Tears apart
Vanishing in such, an unfaithful feeling
And whilst an eternal night - darkened began to arise
Lailaâs desires, pleased him again

[Narration line:]
"In sorrow, she buried perpetuity
Oh such a pityâ¦ forged was cruelty!
Anguished maiden oâ mine
For I shall seek, the brightest sight in this disillusion
May I grant thee, a chalice of blooded roses?"

Even the strongest heart
Tears apart
Vanishing in such, an unfaithful feeling
And whilst an eternal night - darkened began to arise
Lailaâs desires, pleased him again

Enthralled by a malicious intellect
Where dimness gathers beyond moonlight
Overwhelm another victim, the heretic might
Nocturne absolute, devour desolated crimson skies
Mislead one to perish, a prey whom slowly dies

For a taste of blood that fades upon her mouth
Sheâs brutal without a single doubt
Unmercifully it ended, with old serenity
Blood lust remained unwished eternity

[Character speech - Aneon:]
âHence embraced, sweet mistress
Thy pain...
Those shared dreams of ours
Were they in vain...?
Even seared, barely blind
Dimly...
Not a remembrance...?
We bore no one
Living within, the mystery ensnared
My fallen angel..."

And whilst an eternal night - darkened began to arise
Lailaâs desires, pleased him again...
