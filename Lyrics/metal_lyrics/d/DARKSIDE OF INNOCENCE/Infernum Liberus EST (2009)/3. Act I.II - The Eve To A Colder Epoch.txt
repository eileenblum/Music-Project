âFrozen, I felt her breath...
Besieged by winter, a direful blood bath
Standing still a bitter cold,
Laid bewildered, for I saw,
Bizarre corpses unfolding
Whose souls held ever lost!
Unsavoured I sensed the angriest frost
Absorbed by a snowy paled skin....
Midwinter nightmare led her to a faster dim!

Tepid cloudy-water reflects her conscience, like a mirror
As beauty she slept, unaware of an inferno crescendo fever
And once upon dreaming, she silently cried
Whispering unwell, as from her a part died:

Embraced by the arms of betrayal
Swaying her black heart for an unbearable decadence
Witch-crafted here, may lady Laila deserve to belong?
To a burden inside this riveting iced scenario along!

For ye to carve my enchained wrists once more
With those blizzard shaped nails of yours,
Was I born fated to wither with thee?
Once again she bowed; release these living sores lying in me!!!

Ohâ¦ But no! All those beliefs I defied in vain,
Each inquisitive dark midnight, only signified worthless pain
Mine they were to seek, the perishing angel until his rot....
Thusâ¦ thy absence dried my veins,

The eve to a colder epoch....

And dimly, I remember the came of daylight
The veil of illusion, no longer mesmerized her sight
Stagnant she awoke gazing onto incomprehension

For ye to carve my enchained wrists once more
With those blizzard shaped nails of yours,
Was I born fated to wither with thee?
Once again she bowed; release these living sores lying in me!!!

Oh But no! All those beliefs I defied in vain,
Each inquisitive dark midnight, only signified worthless pain
Mine they were to seek, the perishing angel until his rot
Thusâ¦ thy absence dried my veins,

Oh nostalgia, void of a howling past
Without care I landed onto an unknown, so vast

Thus thy absence dried my veins,
The eve to a colder epoch
