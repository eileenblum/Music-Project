Holding still my fading memories  
One last breath seems nothing but futile, 
for it is just a matter of time to accept fateâ¦
Stream of anguish ed sensations coming to beingâ¦

Sophia only made of thou naught! 
As the seductress gently sang a sweet lullaby
The fool dwelt stranded in sheer motionless
But honestly, who wouldnât fall for such enthralling charms?

Her light bestows me a burden of oblivion
Laying asleep, eternally wandering astray within void

Reasoning is an incurable ailing
And Iâm just a dream, vanishing dream
Indulgent perishing to its destiny
A fool, to seek bliss ever afterâ¦
