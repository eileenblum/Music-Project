Recall the gentile way you gazed upon the beggar
The things one could acknowledge with a mere glanceâ¦
Those were times of great importance,
So many thoughts shared with no words involved.

Hard to forget our home, 
The place where I belong.
How tenderly thou cherished me
Like a precious gift

With your depart, Sorrow is all I have become 
Luna you truly became an undying reverie of mineâ¦  

Should hatred merge us in utter torment? 
Once again, lie to these frail senses of our glorious romance 

Shall we embrace passion in a last waltz?
