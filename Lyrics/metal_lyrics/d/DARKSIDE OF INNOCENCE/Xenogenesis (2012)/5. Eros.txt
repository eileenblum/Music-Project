âThrill thy senses from this magnificent tree we dost gladly shareth
Lest true bliss engulf thou, on a lustful dream we ensnarethâ
Somehow mesmerized by this fruit it gifted, I foolishly steppedâ¦
Unaware sacrifice! Blind I took the eternal debt

"Walk forth to attain satisfaction! A bite shall provide no harm
Thou might prosper among the withering swarm!!!â
Had these eloquent voices, cast towards mine flesh 
Something warm, that drew me close, granting this self what it lacked!

âSo pleasurable, irresistibly appealing
How alluring, so enticingâ¦ is it not?
Yes, keenly I yield to this tempting gleeâ¦
