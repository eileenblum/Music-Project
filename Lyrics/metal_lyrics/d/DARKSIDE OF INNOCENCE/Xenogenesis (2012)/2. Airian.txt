There is superior knowledge. 
Wisdom beyond the reasons of the animal
One shall be enlightened with such understandingâ¦

That, which can be reckoned as a truthful freedom, 
Releases the mind from the angst we live in everyday

Behold my decadenceâ¦
Craving and longing for carnalityâ¦
And for what?

Witness my demiseâ¦

Shall we look at this miserable being crawling in desolation?
Drained by such a pointless existence
Weary from the petty desires that seek not my pleasureâ¦ 
But instead they hold me to assure organic existence

I shall become airian and transcend this nature to exist at last

There is superior knowledge. 
Wisdom beyond the reasons of the animal
