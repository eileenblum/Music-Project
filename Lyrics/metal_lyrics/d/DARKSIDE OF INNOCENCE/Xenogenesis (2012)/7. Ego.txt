â- Devour passion till thouâst fell apart, 
Collapsed by an overwhelming demise,
Henceforth, hatred shalt be unleashed; 
Disavowing of unblemished verveâ

âSo pleasurable, irresistibly appealing
How alluring, so enticingâ¦ is it not?
Yes! Keenly I yield to this tempting gleeâ¦ 
Oâ how for Eden, thou yearned before

Oâ Fiery Thanatos blistering within like sulphur!
Charmed by Erosâ eagerness, immersed in the utmost sin
Drowned I was hence, in rapture but not alone
Born a three faced king, heir to a throneâ¦
