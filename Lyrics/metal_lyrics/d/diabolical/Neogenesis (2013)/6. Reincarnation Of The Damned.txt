Chanting masses fill the air with lament
As they drag their feet through the sulphur soil
Laceration is the sole atonement
Bound to so insidious a toil

And the chant will go on for generations

Obscuritas daemonium
Ventus in arboribus
De excisione et rota
Aeterna tribulationis canet

Reincarnation of the Damned
Enslave them all

Suffering in a perpetual chain
Advocated through a surface of gold
The oppression will be in vain
As the quintessence remains untold

And the cycle goes on and on and on

Obscuritas daemonium
Ventus in arboribus
De excisione et rota
Aeterna tribulationis canet

Reincarnation of the Damned
Enslave them all
