Fear trickling down your spine
Like rattling snakes it binds
Paralyzing your every thought

The venom in your veins
A mark of ancient times
Your ignorance
Will be your downfall

Metamorphosis
Neogenesis

A new sun in the sky
Transforming existence
Time to conquer
Or face the downfall

No denial
You can feel it
Burn
The flames are growing higher

No resistance
You can feel the urge
The fires of creation
Burn

Venturing into the depths of the self
Seizing the torch of potential
And bringing it forth

Birth of benightedness
Rivers of blood and wine
Wash away the albatross

Feast of depravity
Behold the fucking fools
Their ignorance
Will be their downfall

Metamorphosis
Neogenesis

No denial
You can feel it
Burn
The flames are growing higher

[2x]
No resistance
You can feel the urge
The fires of creation
Burn
