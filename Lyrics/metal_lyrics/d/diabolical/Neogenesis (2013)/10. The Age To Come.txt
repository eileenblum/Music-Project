A child of man
Reflecting eye
A comet rising
Burning sky

Lingering

Vanquish them all
Vanquish them all

Truth be told
Writing the word
My will be done
In ashes so cold

Visions of The Age to Come

Dreadfulness lurking in the shadows
Striding forth with apprehension
Abnegating the wretched antithesis
Rite of passage

A child of man
Reflecting eye
A comet rising

Vanquish them all
Vanquish them all

Truth be told
Writing the word
My will be done
In ashes so cold

Visions of The Age to Come
