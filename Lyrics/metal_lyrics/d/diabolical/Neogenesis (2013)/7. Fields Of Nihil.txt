Unforeseen unearthing
Going forth with haste
A mist lies on the fields of Nihil
Crossing the threshold
Entering the field
There may still be traces of hope

Lifeless
Their faces
Swallow the sun
And the stars

Last wish - answer me
Relinquish - join the dead
Death wish - set us free
Relieving the failure with lead

End of life
In the Fields of Nihil
Dark or light
In the Fields of Nihil

Somewhere in the blackness
A pleading voice is calling out to me
Somewhere in the silence
The truth of time and thought inside the field

Cold to the bone
Calamity within
Struggling with the power of will
Swallow the sulphur
Or a bullet for the pain
And never know what lies beyond the mist

Hundreds
Their faces
Covered in blood
And despair

Last wish - make them see
Extinguish - every spark
Death wish - release me
Follow them into the dark

[2x]
End of life
In the Fields of Nihil
Dark or light
In the Fields of Nihil
