Left alive
All perished in the deluge
Walking through ashes
An ruins of man

Hollow eyes
Staring in horror
Frozen in time
Blackened skeletal towers
A sombre memorial

Famished and weak
Struggling ahead
Path befringed by the dead

No prayer for the living
As fire swept the earth
Arise
World in silence

No prayer for the living
As fire swept the earth
Demise
World in silence

Bring to light
Old aspirations falling apart
Foundations of palaces
Crumble to dust

In the dark
Gazing into the chasm
Of what once was
And the death that must follow

Famished and weak
Struggling ahead
Path befringed by the dead

No prayer for the living
As fire swept the earth
Arise
World in silence

No prayer for the living
As fire swept the earth
Demise
World in silence

Run away
They will hunt you down
Turn away
From the voices
Run away
And the fear prevails

Fade away 
Truth of deception emerges
Burning
No forgiveness
Fade away
Discord of the word
Birth cries
When the world is silent

Famished and weak
Struggling ahead
Path befringed by the dead

No prayer for the living
As fire swept the earth
Arise
World in silence

No prayer for the living
As fire swept the earth
Demise
World in silence
