Hours pass in the remnants of reality
Carry the burden of the forsaken souls
Buried deep in a wasteland
Beyond all dignity
The house of the fallen
Scorched by fire
A dead man's words

Cogitatio et veritas
Penicillus et tabula rasa

Thoughts are creators of the world he said
Harnessing the power in a
Dialogue with the Dead

Sermo cum mortuis

Empty world devoid of leaders and gods
The outer chaos and inner conflict subsides
Let it go

The inheritance and truths of aeons crumble
Direction and focus
Channeling the surge
A dead man's words

Cogitatio et veritas
Penicillus et tabula rasa

Thoughts are creators of the world he said
Harnessing the power in a
Dialogue with the Dead

In the dead of the night
The crippled growl in delusion
Let the wolves loose and open the gates to oblivion
The dead awaken and put an end to the illusion
Stroke of the quill
The thought and the will
A dead man's words

Dialogus cum mortuis

Cogitatio et veritas
Penicillus et tabula rasa

Thoughts are creators of the world he said
Harnessing the power in a
Dialogue with the Dead

In a Dialogue with the Dead
