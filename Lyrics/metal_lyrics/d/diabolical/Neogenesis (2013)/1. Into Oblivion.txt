Into oblivion
Into oblivion

And so it came
Illusion's demise
The fall of an ancient order
Flesh into vapour
Wood into ash
Echoes of shattered beliefs

The gigantic black tongue
Sweeps the land
Smothering the thoughts of a real world
Flames embracing the masses
Turning all into dust again
Once again

[2x]
We fall
The end is here

Into oblivion
Into oblivion

The final sigh
Of beast and man out of time
And into oblivion
Black smoke covers the heaven
Turning all colours to grey again
Once again

[2x]
We fall
The end is here

Into oblivion
Into oblivion

Hollow creations
Consumed by the burning light
Blood of the wretched
Covers the land
Feeding the rats

Into oblivion
Into oblivion
