Walking across the barren land
Eternal sands below me
Will deny the truth at hand
Devour thee

Deafening roar of desert winds
Blazing sun above me
Enlightening voice of rebel's kin
Inspire thee

Everglow of the progeny
Conceived in conflagration
Never know the epiphany
Into the desolation

Reaching the spire, ascending the stairs
Silence surrounding me
Entering the hall, a golden flare
Ancient ones in solemn glare
Unveiling the child, igniting the air
Inherent revelation
Enlighten me

Hear - We are the Oracle
See - We are the origin
Speak - We are the Oracle
Feel - We are the origin

Creation
Fire within
Illusion
Break the seal
Perception
Shedding skin
Ascension
Shun the wheel

The words of the Oracle
Resonate prevision
Locked inside and reaching out
A path through the desert
The child by the hand
Exalt me

Everglow of the progeny
Conceived in conflagration
Never know the epiphany
Into the desolation

Save me

Hear - We are the Oracle
See - We are the origin
Speak - We are the Oracle
Feel - We are the origin
