Fragile kind
Cavaliers all be
Two-Dimensional

Coward minds
The lazy can not
Wait to rest

None will wake up
As the downfall
Draws near

But rather cling
To the culture
Of fear

Sleeping camp
Mind's decline

Emotional
Suggestible men

Comfortably
Returning
To the well

Over and
Over again

Craven mind
Seeking order

Bastard shepherds apear

Rejoicing as
The great decline
Is here

Craven mind
Seeking order

Simple thoughts
Made unclear

Submiting to the
Perpetual fear

You that image
Of you
From which
You can not run

Dread
The barrier
You can not
Break through

Strugling
To smother
What you
Pursue

Strugling
To be at least
Not you

Sleeping mind
Your decline

Emotional
Suggestible men

Comfortably
Returning
To the well

Over and
Over again

Craven mind
Seeking order

Bastard shepherds apear

Rejoicing as
The great decline
Is here

Craven mind
Seeking order

Simple thoughts
Made unclear

Submiting to the
Perpetual fear
