With eyes shut, and wounds wide open
I'm waiting to meet you again
With lights out, through words unspoken
My demons are calling but I'm not afraid

I'm awaiting your death can't you see?
Your body in flames every night in my dreams

Hatred - my hate is built on despise
I'm falling although I cannot hear
Rise above - the passenger dies
I cannot hear your voice, am I free?

I'm awaiting your death can't you see?
I'll piss on your grave the day (that) I'm set free

Can't stand this pointless being
Can't break these cursed chains
Just want to watch you... Die

Wake up - you have had your time
This earth is not yours anymore
Fall down - it's time to realize
That there is no helping hand here anymore

Failure - I am forced to realize
That this was just another wasted dream
Passenger - await extraordinary pain
Though the blood on my hands is not real

Can't stand this pointless being
Can't break these cursed chains
Just want to watch you... Die
