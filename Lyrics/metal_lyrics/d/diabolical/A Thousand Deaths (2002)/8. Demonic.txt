The sun has died - the world is on fire
Relentless demon, Satan -spawn -semen
Crucified - inverted cross
Blood and gore I gave you
Now you've come back for more

The soul has died - the skin is on fire
Endless torture - evil -pain -pleasure
Vomified - inverted guts
Blood and puke I gave you
Now you've come back for gore
and more - rotten to the core

Hellraiser - set to ruin the world
Trying to break down the strong
Destroyer - living a life in the past
It's time to prove you all wrong
Why should we believe that you are different, improved
A liar, like the rest of us - until proved

Incinerate - terminate
Watch all sinners burn in hell
Incarcerate, disintegrate
I cut your wings and down they fell

Armageddon - let me burn

Blasphemy, sodomy
Entrails flowing endlessly
I cut you up, fucked you up
Jesus, whore, monstrosity

Armageddon - let me burn

Hellraiser - set to ruin the world...
