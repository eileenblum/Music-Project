Reincarnation of the fallen lightbearer
Extermination of mankind, ruler of stupidity
Reincarnation of the angel with blackened wings
Total warfare - burn the promised land

I see death

Humans torn apart with military joy
In a future close at hand
A town is soon to be destroyed
As the wings of death slowly embrace the land

Genocide - rape this earth
Total death (and) no rebirth
We are the children of the mushroom cloud

Humans ephemeral - divine excruciation
Feel the smell of burning flesh - total devastation
Nuclear assault - god's debris
Holocaust - release the beast

I see death

Earth is dead - the day has come at last
Watch us burn on judgement day - time is running fast
Nuclear assault - god's debris
Holocaust - life has ceased to exist

Genocide - rape this earth
Total death (and) no rebirth
We are the children of the mushroom cloud
