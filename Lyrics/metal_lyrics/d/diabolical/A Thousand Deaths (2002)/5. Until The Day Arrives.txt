In the wastelands of my heart - I explore
I see a dying moon and a rising sun
I hope they'll collide and unite forever
Only then will I be able to experience inner peace

In the wastelands of my heart - I wait
I see two shadows in the sand
One is mine, the other is my longing
I wish - I wish I was my shadow

I observe the sand in the timeglass
The day of the death is close at hand
When the sun and moon are one
I will find eternal peace

In the wastelands of my heart - I die
I cannot eat - I cannot rest
I just wait - wait in silence
Until the day arrives - arrives

I observe the sand in the timeglass
The day of the death is close at hand
When the sun and moon are one
I will find eternal peace
