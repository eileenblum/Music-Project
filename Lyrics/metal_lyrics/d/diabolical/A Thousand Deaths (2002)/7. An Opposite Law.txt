Theories, unorganized, incomplete
Wasted thoughts - wasted time
Chaos, reigns supreme, no tools...
to realize what is real

Constant light - constant life - constant death
See through the mirror or hide in the past

The answers came from believers
Ignorance rules
The answers came from believers
"facts" are tools

Darkness, spread its wings, I fear... not
Respect the fate of all mankind
Constant light, surrounding me
I believe... not
The truth is on the other side

Constant light - constant life - constant death
See through the mirror or hide in the past

The answers came from believers
Ignorance rules
The answers came from believers
"facts" are tools
