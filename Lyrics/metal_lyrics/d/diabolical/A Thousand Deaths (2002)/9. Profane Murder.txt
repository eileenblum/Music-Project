Control, resistance
Embraced by demons in black
In chains, the shapeless
Stab their own god in the back

Cold

Demons feast upon the dead Jesus Christ  beheaded
You have killed the god when you most need him

Dead... your god is dead

Angels, sinners, kill (or) let yourself die

In use, with power
The Trojan horse to attack
In vain, defenseless
The god must take a step back

The time has come - damnation
The true believer will die
This is a new world, a new breed, a new faith
And we are living a lie

Your god is dead

Angels, sinners, kill (or) let yourself die

Control, resistance...

The time has come - damnation
The true believer will die
This is a new world, a new breed, a new faith
And we are living a lie

I am dead...
