Dead angel's choir - voices of the damned
A brutal slaughtering of visions on command
Time stops - death is closing in
Before an audience of imaginary friends

It's too late
Feel the hate
Decapitate

Trying to keep the distance - a waste of precious time
Between the angel's choir and reality there's no clear line
I read the book - I close the book - I hate the book - I burn the book
The truth isn't there. The truth isn't here.

It's too late
Free the hate
Eliminate

Dead angel's choir - the voices of the damned
Dead angel's choir burning down the promised land

Dead angel's choir - empty yet complete
An immortal force with which you can't compete
Time stops - desperation is closing in
And in its footprints nothing but ashes remain

Still too late
Fear the hate
Disintegrate

Dead angel's choir - the voices of the damned
Dead angel's choir burning down the promised land
