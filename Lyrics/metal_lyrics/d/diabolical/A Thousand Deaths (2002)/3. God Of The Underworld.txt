Behind the broken mask that used to be your life
Behind the agony and grief that your bare inside
With your transparent shield put aside
Are you living dead or dying alive?

Kill yourself - you cannot stand the "truth"
Kill yourself - your "life" ain't nothing worth

At the bottom you're reached by no light
Below the surface there is no way out
The time has come - the time to choose
Hear the voice - take control - rise up - fall down

Kill yourself - you cannot stand the "truth"
Kill yourself - your "life" ain't nothing worth

God of the underworld - show her the flames
God of the underworld - release and erase
Suicide - hear the voice
Suicide - back in control

What comes after is there for you to see
A thousand deaths - a thousand lies - a thousand beliefs
You listened, you read, you joined the dead
And now is the time
To ask yourself the question of all times

Kill yourself - you cannot stand the "truth"
Kill yourself - your "life" ain't nothing worth

God of the underworld - show her the flames
God of the underworld - release and erase
Suicide - hear the voice
Suicide - back in control
