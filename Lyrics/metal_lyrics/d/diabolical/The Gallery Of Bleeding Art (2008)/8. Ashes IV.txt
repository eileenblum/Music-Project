Visions of a greater time to come - a journey in time
And man's will to unite with equals in a shining kingdom
Looking down at the masses below
And the yearning for divine presence on earth
Caused rather the opposite

Crippled angel - a martyr with wings sawn off
Calling for vengeance

A dead saviour transformed into the great being
A guardian angel fallen from grace
A merciless smothering of any tendency
To break free from the cursed chains
Where every step forward is heading into
The arms of the being

Crippled angel
Welcoming every man too far away from the
World on fire that fell into oblivion
But as long as there are traces of life left to burn
This journey will continue

Can't hide from the wretched being
Can't hide from the reality any more
Can't ignore the failure
Or that the downfall was unavoidable
Can't hide from the wretched being
Can't hide from reality any more
Can't ignore the stricken's chantings
Or heal the wounds that were self-inflicted

When all are dead and the earth has been scorched
He has won
When a hundred years have passed
And the silence still remains
He will celebrate the victory of time

When the earth is dead and everything is cold
He will come back for more
Because in the ashes of yesterday's creations
There may still lie traces of hope

Walk in his footprints - settle for the earth
There is no cure now - let your body be his instrument
Kneel to the wicked - for yet another hundred years or more
Celebrate the crushing of yet another naive rebellion

When time has stopped and all hope has gone
He has won
When everything is frozen and nothing ever changes
He will celebrate the victory of time
When the earth is dead and everything is cold
He will come back for more
Because in the ashes of yesterday's creations
There may still lie traces of hope

Walk in his footprints - settle for the earth
for he is your wicked superior
When everything is dead, and there is no escape
And there is no tomorrow, days that never came
Visions never realized, a future in the hands of the being
When everything is cold, the diabolical creation prevails
The journey continues

Visionary - an angel with wings sawn off
Begging for mercy

Diminished - I am the shadow
Watching the slow uprise
I shall not stay, nor shall my body
A timeless journey
Angel-like voices are fading away
Buried in ashes so cold
Where there is no light
There may still lie traces of hope
