[I.]
In the dazzling white light we can no longer see
What we created - a one second triumph
Rivers of our finest plutonium
Melting into the ground like an open wound
Standing without the ability to
Behold our finest yet final creation
Mortal senses die in the light
Watching our masterpiece with dead eyes

They are blind
We are blind

[II.]
Erasing parasites, man-made extinction
Vanishing life-forms, man-made perfection
The time has come for our slithering existence
To return into the womb from which it came
Shattered flocks of ignorant beings
Blown away in a carnal thermonuclear storm
A one-second holocaust
Realizing that they have realized

A ritual of mass-destruction

Man made extinction - extinction made man
Killing for inner peace
Man made extinction - extinction made man
Ruling a world where all life has ceased

[III.]
In the blackest of voids we can once again see
The uncreation - our absolute triumph
It is the dawn of the neogenesis
The rebirth of all that ever was
Standing with the ability to
Behold our finest yet final creation
Mortal senses die in the light
Watching our world with dead eyes

They are blind
We are blind

[IV.]
Recreate paradise - man-made creation
Exalted lifeforms - god-like  perfection
The time has come to be as one with the gods
To return into the womb from which we all came
Shattered flocks of ignorant beings
Blown away in a carnal thermonuclear storm
A one-second holocaust
Realizing that they have realized
A ritual of mass-destruction

Man made extinction - extinction made man
Killing for inner peace
Man made extinction - extinction made man
Ruling a world where all life has ceased

Man made extinction
Extinction made man
