[I.]
I am the fire that is burning in your eyes
A memory that never dies
In your raped and strangled mind
I am the performance
That is played in front of your eyes
A final disentaglement of your mind
But you are blind

[II.]
I am the enemy in the mirror that you can not reach
Without the possibility to see
That you are the shadow of my pain and existence
Dying without any sign of resistance
Depredated you seethe with hatred
And despise my being

But what is left of your life?
Only memories that are utterly repressed
Do you belong in this world?
When you are the one who bleeds
Eternally

Realize - you are the one who bleeds
I'm alive - causing the pain you need
Realize - you are the one who bleeds
Sacrifice - freedom to be redeemed
Flesh - tainted with blasphemies
Death - seeking tranquillity
Pain - losing the inner war
Sacrifice your freedom to be redeemed

Visions - clinging to your mind
Feeding you with lies

[III.]
Hatred - burning in your eyes
Revealing the open wounds
That were caused by the shards
From the mirror that you destroyed
In home to smother the memories
An act of desperation
For you are doomed

[IV.]
I am the shards -
Each one symbolising the pain and suffering
That you set in front of me
Pick up the broken mirror and see what you created
The face in the mirror does not belong to me anymore
What is left of your life?
Only memories that are utterly repressed
Do you belong in this world?
When you are the one who bleeds
Eternally
