[I.]
Welcome to the gallery of bleeding art
Where I create pain on the canvas of death
Just close your eyelids - the torture comes from within
In this realm of mine the revenge can begin

In a blackened place within me
Where reason is eclipsed by rage
In edifice of inviolable justice
Where my vengeance is coming to life
In all the beautiful colours of affliction

[II.]
I will rape your mind into fragments of broken glass
And every single crystal shard shall pierce your lying heart
There is no dawn in this blood red dream
Just an endless night of anguish supreme

No more lies will be told
I will make you suffer in my mind
When I have ripped out your tongue
No more lies will be written
A thousand deaths for you inside
When I have smashed your fingers into pieces

Each stroke of my brush
A condescending strike against you
Each dash of paint
A scar upon your body

[III.]
Every lie that you have told will be a scar upon your body
An eternal monument of your worthless existence
In the darkness I can hear you weep
You can't wake up from this breathless sleep

Every image of your tormented face
Every depiction of your lacerated body
Every instant of your suffering
Is a grand piece of bleeding art

[IV.]
In these chambers of vengeance I am free to live again
Live through a thousand torments
I don't feel the pain anymore
There is no life in this world of scorn
Just an endless night with tragedies adorned

No more lies will be told
I will make you suffer in my mind
When I have ripped out your tongue
No more lies will be written
A thousand deaths for you inside
When I have smashed your fingers into pieces

[V.]
Death so close, yet so far, far away
Please try to reach the light with useless broken limbs
My wrath is eternal, I will never let you die
Because your suffering is keeping me alive

No more lies will be told
I will make you suffer in my mind
When I have ripped out your tongue
No more lies will be written
A thousand deaths for you inside
When I have smashed your fingers into pieces
