[I.]
Trapped inside a world distorted
Thick air, pounding pulse
Climbing dead walls, seeking cure
Chemical solutions giving no relief
In this relentless circle
The spiral heading downwards
Chaos is closing in
Temporary solutions for a
Dislocated mind

Embrace the dawn they say
Daily escapism
And seek the light they say
Where the walls have already
Absorbed whatever rays there were

[II.]
Patters seem unbreakable in this room of decay
The only wish is the wish to endure
This endless journey of self-contempt

The sun is rising upon others
Laughter is echoing, but not here
Only elsewhere
Truthful words and acts of deliverance
Every reason evident, but not here
Only elsewhere

det som kallades framtid finns mte mer
allt det som blomstade Ã¤r nu dÃ¶tt och begraver
och allt som var vackert Ã¤r ruttet nu 
det some kallades hunger finns inte mer
det enda som flammar Ã¤r smÃ¤rtans lÃ¥ga
i vetskapen om att ha varit fÃ¶rd bakom ljuset

det some kallades sanning finns inte mer
bata grÃ¥ nyanser i ett dunkelt sinne
som slagits sÃ¶nder i ett Ã¶gonblick
det some kallades mening finns inte mer
bara klarvakna nÃ¤tter, apatiska dagar
och lÃ¤ngtan att slippa att nÃ¥gonsin mer vakna

[III.]
Trapped inside a mind dismantled
Hollow words echoing
The only wish is the wish to hate
Where the will to live equals the will to hate
Forlorn mind, scorched and barren
Unbalanced, led astray
Sixty nights past endurance
Consumed by this room where
Destruction has brough no life

Snuff the rebellion
Destroy the intruders
And seek the light they say
As if the light was not only
A fragmented memory of yesterday

Sun rising - but not here
Only elsewhere
Laughter echoing - but not here
Only elsewhere

The sun is rising upon others
Laughter is echoing, but not here,
Truthful words and acts of deliverance
Every reason evident, but not here
Only elsewhere
