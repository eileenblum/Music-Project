[I.]
In ignorance, shaped to live suppressed
Devoured by a sheltering light
Obedient and restrained
Rejoicing in innocence
Indefagitable prayer for heavenly grace
In fear for the reckoning day
Praising a bastard
An unconditional devotion
To the unyielding one and his ways
Devoured by his protective rays
But as it was written
A bite so small enlightened all
Cognizance took the holy saviour's place
The venom had gently unveiled a glaring creation below
Greater than any revelation

Unyielding ways and values replaced
A gathering living to die, no more
Abandoned light - delivering bite
A gathering dying to live, reborn

[II.]
Remoulded their vindictive crusade began
Blinded by wisdom they ran
Aggressive formations unleashed
Wrapped in cotton
Thriving, victorious, alive
The hour of triumph has come
Intolerant, self-proclaimed prophets, singing the words

Praise our wisdom now
Turn to intolerant choirs, chanting the words
Praise our wisdom now
It is your way to freedom

Praise our wisdom now
Turn to beautiful theories consuming the earth
Praise our wisdom now
It is the only way

[III.]
Through centuries of time, imbalance in bloom
The man-made illusion gave birth to a glorious age
For those who defined freedom
The enlightened hurling stones in all their haste
Devoured by the sheltering truth
Obedience replaced by comforting nothingness
But with every yearning pleased confusion arose
Resistance began to grow
Chaos leading to the reincarnation of the balanced paradise
Where nothing is more or less true
A world beyond common knowledge
Greater than any revelation

Unyielding ways and values replaced
A gathering living to die, no more
Comforting light - heavenly grace
A gathering dying to live, reborn

Praise our ignorance
Turn to intolerant choirs, changing the words
Praise our ignorance
It is your way to freedom
Praise our ignorance
Turn to the comforting balance that our preaching offers
Praise our ignorance
It is the only way
Praise our ignorance
It is your way to freedom
