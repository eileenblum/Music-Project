[I.]
Soon to be taken away
From this world that I once destroyed
Seconds feel like hours
As I return the time I took
Those I blessed with deepest hate
Were only drops in the ocean of blood
that cleansed my mind, but left stains that I
Have not managed to was away from my hands

[II.]
Epidemic yet healing parasites
Spawned in the chambers of spiritual genocide
Dead senses awaken as my body is injected away
Emotional intolerance
No one can provide the callous with fury

No emotions, no forbidden thoughts
No strength
No emotions, no forbidden thoughts
Not even death can kill this cancer...now

The smile of the open wound
Is yearning to be free
It will only take seconds
To wipe away the vertigo inside me

[III.]
Fear takes control
In this everlasting machinery
Body lays dormant
Festering spite in pale semblance
Those I blessed with deepest hate
were only tokens of my physical demise
Body is drained, but a seed has been planted
That they have not managed to take away

No emotions, no forbidden thoughts
No strength
No emotions, no forbidden thoughts
Not even death can kill this cancer...now

The parasite is holding me back
The disease erased my free will
Swept away by the comforting apathy
Not even death can kill this cancer

In my dreams at least I can kill myself
