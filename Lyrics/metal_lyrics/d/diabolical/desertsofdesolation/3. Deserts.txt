There's a desert within me, growing bigger every day
I keep drifting further away, from what used to be my life
Every night I try to, tell myself that it's no use
But something makes me keep hunting, hunting myself

A hopeless dream of joy, it's something I can't control

The silhouette is too unreal, and the distance is way too great
The calm oasis - the valley of joy, a place I know I'll never reach
So every night I try to, replace my agony with strength
But something makes me keep stabbing, stabbing myself

(I know I have been here before, but I never thought I would return
To these deserts of desolation, someone, please take me away from here)
