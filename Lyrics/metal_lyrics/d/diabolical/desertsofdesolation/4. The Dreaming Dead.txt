The dreaming dead is staring at you, through your passive sins
Waiting for you to join them again, the desolated ones

The dreaming dead is offering you, everything they have
A fulfilled vision of distress - a world of emptiness

Chasing, running, hiding - that's the life of a dreaming dead

Falling through the passage of time, without no sign (of) regret
there are no one to carry you now, above the abyss (of) dreams

breathing, waiting, dying - that's the life of a dreaming dead
