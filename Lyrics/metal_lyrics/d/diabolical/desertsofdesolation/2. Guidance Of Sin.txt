Afraid you cannot hide from what you believe
The truth ain't stainless it will only deceive
The primal fear is losing control
Regaining life but without the soul

Abort the lies and tell me what do you see
Misanthropic truth, kept deep inside of me
Of skin and bones, the will is inside
You cut me up and left me open wide

From the burning core comes the guidance of sin
Use it when all is lost, when nothing is left to win
Sick of guilt - anxiety deep within, your own life - is your biggest sin
