Read my scars like an open book
With pages made of human flesh
Letters drawn in purest pain
Telling you of a life in vain

I have written my final chapter
I died because i did not die
Now i stand among others
Their human lives, Disintegrated
I felt, I dreamt, I bled
Cold, silent, dead
I felt, I dreamt, I bled - still i stood
Incarcerated
Cold, silent, dead - human life - disintegrated

Incarcerated...

Disintegrated
