Staring yourself blind
Into the flame of no return
You blew out the candle
With the key to freedom in your hand

The only light in the darkness
Is the reflection in the mirror of your soul
With bleeding wounds you seek refuge
In the comforting red light

In suicidal glory
You were drawn into the flame
No life, no regrets, no return
Blew out the candle

Awaken suicidal glory
Once consumed by the fire
Life ceased to exist
And you once again awoke
With blind folded eyes
In suicidal glory
You were drawn into the flame
No life, no regrets, no return
Blew out the candle

Awaken suicidal glory
