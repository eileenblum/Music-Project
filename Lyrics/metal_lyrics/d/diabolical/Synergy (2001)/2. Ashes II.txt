The clock is ticking - time is running out again
Proud visions burning in a fire of emptiness
Depression, anger, sin passion, fear and pain
Words spoken through a filter of apathy

Holocaust - the world is burning again
Demons spread their wings and feast upon the dead
Chaos - direction lost a long time ago
A shallow piny for all of us to see

I have traveled from hell to nowhere and back again
And my phrases got emptier every day
I have traveled from hell to nowhere and back again
It's been a journey through a hundred years
That never seems to come to an end

Nothing but ashes remain

The clock is ticking - time is running out again
A repetition of what seems to be fate
A hopeless battle to break free from the burning gore
The failure is complete as the angels fall

I have traveled from hell to nowhere and back again
And my phrases got emptier every day
I have traveled from hell to nowhere and back again
It's been a journey through a hundred years
That never seems to come to an end
