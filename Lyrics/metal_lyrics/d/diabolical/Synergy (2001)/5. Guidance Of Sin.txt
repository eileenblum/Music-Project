Afraid you hide from what you cannot believe
The truth ain't stainless it will only deceive
The primal fear is loosing control
Regaining life but without the soul

Abort the lies and tell me - What do you see?
Misanthropic truth kept deep inside of me
Of skin and bones the will is inside
You cut me up and left me open wide

From the burning core comes
The guidance of sin
Use when all is lost
When nothing's left to win

Sick of built - anxiety deep within
Your own life - is your biggest sin

I can see through your illusion
For i deny your sickening love
I walk alone through the chambers of death
Reopening the wounds of my soul

From the burning core comes
The guidance of sin
Use when all is lost
When nothing's left to win
