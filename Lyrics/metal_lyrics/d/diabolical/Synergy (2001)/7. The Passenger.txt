A pointless being with primitive ideals
Keeps crawling under my skin
His brainwashed mind is such a waste of human flesh
And his world is built on lies and dreams

Passenger
Time is burning fast
It's time to find another hand to feed your shallow dreams

I'm struggling to be released from these chains
But the lack of alternatives keeps holding me back

So i keep exploiting the hunger that i appease
And i know that time is on my side

Passenger
Your time is running out
Your journey has come to its end

Passenger
Time is burning fast
It's time to find another hand to feed your shallow dreams
