Insanity, I hear the dead men speak
They scream, they talk, they whisper with voices so weak
In agony, I watch their healed wounds bleed
Scarred but not yet fragile the questions I read

Let me take you to my haven
Where you can become
Stronger than all, the soul is immortal

Let me take you to my haven
Where everything's told
Everything's done, the life is immortal

Tranquillity, i watch the dead men sleep
They dream, they toss and turn, in silence they weep
Blasphemy, something that someone once told
Scarred but not yet bleeding the answers are old

Let me take you to my haven
Where you can become
Stronger than all, the soul is immortal

Let me take you to my haven
Where everything's told
Everything's done, the life is immortal
