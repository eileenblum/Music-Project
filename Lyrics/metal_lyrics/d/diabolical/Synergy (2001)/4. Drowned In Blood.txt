Right there at the top of the world
Watching the exalted masses
Nowhere to hide - nowhere to run
The day of death has finally come

No remorse this time
It's execution time
The slaughter has just begun

Frustration growing bigger every day

They all knew - his day had to come
But their lust kept them silent
Nowhere to run - nowhere to hide
And their hunger for more have drowned in blood

No remorse this time
It's execution time
the slaughter has just begun

Frustration growing bigger every day
