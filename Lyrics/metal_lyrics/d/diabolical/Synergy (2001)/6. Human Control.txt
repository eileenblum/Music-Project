It's bitter how the world has become
Tied up, untold, controlled
The power, invested in me
The paralysis of the strongest man

In trust
Human lust
Emancipation of embodiment
Breeds no control

Who will abort the last child?
Will it be me? Take a stand or be passive
Who will abduct the last child?
Let us decide, it's human control

It's painful how the human beholds
The paralysis of the weakest child

In trust
Human lust
Emancipation of embodiment
Breeds no control

My words told
But silence hold
yes/no
It's human control

Who will abduct the last child?
Let us decide, it's human control
