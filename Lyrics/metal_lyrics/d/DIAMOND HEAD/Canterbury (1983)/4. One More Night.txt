You're like a jewel, that burns into me well,
you are a school without the time for bells,
I am a wanderer looking out for warmth
only from you can I get what I want

so don't cut me loose for what's the use
that would be lies and goodbyes
All I want, a night with you
one night with you
one night with you
one more night with you

I walk on the wind, the future comes and goes,
I'll dance to a tune and with it all her wrongs.
And touch me again, silk caress my head,
wide eyed boy's makin' noise when being read.

so don't cut me loose for what's the use
that would be lies and goodbyes
All I want, a night with you
one night with you
one night with you
one more night with you
all I want, one night with you
wo oh oh oh oh
spend more time with you....
