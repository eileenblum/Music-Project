Don't ya hide away from the bad things coming to you,
Don't ya hide your face from the things that don't ring true,
Good times, bad times, that may be so,
you're just part of the game and they never stop letting you know

but we hold the key to the future game,
we live in hope, she'll stay the same,
hold on there just a little longer,
ooh baby, good times, bad times.
Ah ah ah ah, to the devil his due
Ah ah ah ah, to the devil his due
Ah ah ah ah, to the devil his due

You stay good baby and don't you get bad at all,
and I might tell you now what I see in my crystal ball,
good times, bad times, coming your way,
ooh now watch out baby, the devil's gonna have his day.

but we hold the key to the future game,
we live in hope, she'll stay the same,
hold on there just a little longer,
ooh baby, good times, bad times.
Ah ah ah ah, to the devil his due
Ah ah ah ah, to the devil his due
Ah ah ah ah, to the devil his due
to the devil, his due
to the devil, his due
to the devil, his due
to the devil, his due....
