So here I am
The Class of seventy six
Worn, drawn and frayed
Not to wonder why at this.

The way of things to come
The beat has just begun

I need your love
I need so much - love
I need your love
I need your love, need you here.

So I can sleep
So I'll not dream of war
To reassure the me you've brought so far

The way of things to come
The beat has just begun

I need your love
I need so much - love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love

The way of things to come
The beat has just begun
