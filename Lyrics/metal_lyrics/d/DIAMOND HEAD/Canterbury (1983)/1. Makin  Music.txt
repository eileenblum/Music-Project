One new heart, looking to learn it all from Rock n Roll,
so beat your drum from the start,
it was clear we had a lot to learn our souls to be won.
have we the faith for you for good and bad we're due.

One new song doing so much more than making friends
it can make us proud
now we know we can look around
to find the rock, the stone of sound
have we the faith for you for good and bad we're due.

I was fooled by what I do
Makin Music
don't you see
it ain't for me,
it's for you
it's for you.
