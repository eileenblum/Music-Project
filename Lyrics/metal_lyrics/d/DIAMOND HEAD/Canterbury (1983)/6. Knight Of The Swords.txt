A jewelled sceptre plucked by order to serve their cause
To vanquish the swords of chaos and tip the scales again
The last of noble blood you know time must take its course
You blood red robe will never feel the same

For beyond the sea of fire
To embrace a fate you've known
To split the heart of destiny
Up to the bitter throne
Knight of the swords
Knight of the swords
Knight of the swords
Knight of the swords

At first his thirst for vengeance fuelled his bitter heart
As he scaled through time and beyond the learning tree
Ghostly ships trapped in mystic bands summon to play
Sorcerer of chain, come we'll set you free

For beyond the sea of fire
To where pain can call her home
To stir the rock of destiny
Up to the bitter throne
Knight of the swords
Knight of the swords
Knight of the swords
Knight of the swords
The curse of a cause
Knight of the swords
The knoght of the swords

A tear does fill this man
So beyond the sea of fire she calls, she calls

For beyond the sea of fire
And above the heart of man
To stir the rock alacrity
And strike her bonds again
Knight of the swords
Knight of the swords
Knight of the swords
Knight of the swords
The curse of the swords
Knight of the swords
The knight of the swords
