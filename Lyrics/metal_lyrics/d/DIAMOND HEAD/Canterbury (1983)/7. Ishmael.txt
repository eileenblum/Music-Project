Search my heart for things i've done
when dragon's teeth are poised for war
can we be sure of peace at all,
when the spirit moves the world,

wo oh oh oh oh oh,
Ishmael, oh Ishmael
Ishmael, oh Ishmael

The prophets blood, we call our own
a pause for thought, come kingdom come,
will you be swords for Gideon,
when the spirit moves the world,

wo oh oh oh oh oh
What wrong have I done
Ishmael, oh Ishmael
Ishmael, oh Ishmael

So when the truth has come to pass,
and our misdeeds are in the past
will you again, be moved to ask,
when the spirit moves the world

ooh wo oh oh oh oh
waht wrong have I done
Ishmael, oh Ishmael
I hear you well, oh Ishmael....
