At risk of traitors gate he'll raise,
The seed of power now, has grown in size,
intent to crown his bloody prize,
ooh, resolute as a King to soar,
The sword of lies he takes to war
To breach the wall and nations fall.
The quick of steel, betrays his fear,
Ambition plays her part, that's clear,
Betrayed is how he'll die,
Dismayed by anguish, cries,
Enslaved by desperate crfimes
Oh betrayed by time.
