See his eyes, the fear is your symbol
Blackened skies, your courage a cinder
Hold on with every breath inside your blood
Hold on to what you know and all you love

All I can say is in the end we all must pay
These crimson tears and scattered ashes fill your graves
Hold on to what you know and love my friend
Cause all we know is this is now never the end

Here he comes, to steal your life
Donât you run, shout at the devil
Here we come, to heal your lights
Avenge your blood, shout at the devil

He lives and hides amongst all the shadows
Watches in pride as he heralds depression
Hold on with every breath inside your blood
Hold on to what you know and all you love

With every hourâs turn the tables drift and dices burn
Withered secret fill the void, ignites the fire, strength returns
Hold on to what you know and love my friend
Cause all we know is this is now never the end

Here he comes, to steal your life
Donât you run, shout at the devil
Here we come, to heal your lights
Avenge your blood, shout at the devil

You see him you raise your heads
Never feel afraid
Oh now raise your dead
Cause in the end you will prevail

Here he comes, to steal your life
Donât you run, shout at the devil
Here we come, to heal your lights
Avenge your blood, shout at the devil

Shout at the devil
