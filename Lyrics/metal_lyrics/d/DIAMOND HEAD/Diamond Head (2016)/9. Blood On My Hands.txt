Lost my way
Love I ainât gonna leave you
Alight my grace, my friend
Iâll resurrect my broken ego

I wake up choking on this rage

Please hold my hands
Tie me up and kill my demons
Iâll hold my breath, I said
I wonât wait for your Jesus

I wake up choking on this rage
And find

Blood on my hands
Blood on my hands

And if it comes again
My bullets in the air
Iâll need a real reason
To live it all again

Please hold my hands
I canât wait for your Jesus

And I drown again, and I drown again
And I drown again, and I drown again
And I drown again, and I drown again
And I drown again

Wake up choking on this rage
And find

Blood on my hands
Blood on my hands
Blood on my hands
