Let the papers read
Legends they were made tonight

Upon these hallowed streets
Where music is the only right
Miles of laces loved, secret lust and broken hearts
But baby trust these lips cause they can never love too much

Wonât you
Be my
Sugar

Can I come inside your wizard sleeve
I know that you wanna go

Helpless tendencies
Will be breaking bonds tonight
Soaked in salty fire
Take my passion and my pride
Miles of faceless love, budget lust and broken hearts
But baby taste these lips cause they can never love too much

Wonât you
Be my
Honey

Can I come inside your wizard sleeve
I know that you wanna go

Iâll hit this show tonight
Touch your love and make you royal
Through all this broken light
Share the thunder make you boil
These miles of reckless love, open lust and broken hearts
Baby taste these lips cause they can never get enough

Wonât you
Be my
Lover

Can I come inside your wizard sleeve
I know that you wanna go
