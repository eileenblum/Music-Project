When the seas kiss the stars
And the moon dulls the light
And your veins turn to dust
Then behold the night when
You sacrificed your flame

Oh human disgrace

For man this is the end
Silence reclaim your land
For man this is the end
Silence reclaim your land

When the breeze cries with pain
Bludgeoned tears pierce the sands
Hear the bells ringing out
And recall the days when you
Dug childrenâs graves in regret

Oh human disgrace

For man this is the end
Silence reclaim your land
For man this is the end
Silence reclaim your land

Once the end
All reclaimed
In silence
We ring the end
