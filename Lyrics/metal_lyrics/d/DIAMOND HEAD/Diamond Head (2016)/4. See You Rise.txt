I feel the laser surging through my head
Until my blood begins to boil
Sweet taste of mercury fills my mouth
Kiss of death is at the door

But I see you rise again
Now rise with me

This vengeful gravity illudes my mind
Soon I face the masters call
The smell of burnt divinity twists my lungs
His pit will swallow me up whole

But I see you rise again
Now rise with me

Rise up, become the heir
Bring the blackest of days
Wonât you rise within
I see you rise again

Last breath of mutiny before the reaper comes
And drowns me in the oil
With his loaded ember gun, he pulls the trigger back
And watch me turn to dust

But I see you rise again
Now rise with me

Rise up, become the heir
Bring the blackest of days
Wonât you rise within
I see you rise again
