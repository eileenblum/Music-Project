Lightning strikes the earth
Builds man from ashes
Heâs humble, he reaps, he grows
Watched it all erode
He trembles and hides
In his castle thatâs made of your bones

And all that you gave
Watch the whole world crumble
And wasted away
Your greed will seed the end

On the edge
On the edge
On the edge
On the edge of your bones

Erupting in hatred
Man will deplete all your heart, your love, your soul
Reflect on the ages
We tremble and hide
In the castle thatâs made of your bones

And all that you gave
Watch the whole world crumble
And wasted away
Your greed will seed the end

On the edge
On the edge
On the edge
On the edge of your bones

On the edge
On the edge
On the edge
On the edge of your bones

While you run on the edge
Once you run on the edge
