Prepare for war
The barren lands they have spoken
Now itâs time for us to tremble the earth
Messengers
A breath of fire, lights the beacons
Raise an army and take back your home

Once a slave
A man can conquer a kingdom
Take their crown and send them to hell
Once a slave
He took a stand with his treason
Rid the world from misery

Thereâs a man,thereâs a man
Who bleeds for all the reasons you live
Thereâs a man who lives among his people
Bleeds for all the reasons you live

Recall the days
Drowning angst, fed the storm
The masses walked to raze a towerâs throne
Mournful haze
Angels fallen all around
Canât you see their withered broken grace

Golden gates
Stained in holy blood
War has risen to the highest plane
No reprieve
Swords will rain from heavens
Kill off all the misery

Thereâs a man, thereâs a man
Who bleeds for all the reasons you live
Thereâs a man who lives among his people
Bleeds for all the reasons you live

He bleeds for all the reason you live
He bleeds for all the reason you live

Thereâs a man, thereâs a man
He bleeds for all the reasons you live
Thereâs a man who lives among his people
He bleeds for all the reasons you live
He bleeds among the people
Thereâs a man, he lives among his people
He bleeds for all the reasons you live
He bleeds for all the reasons you live
He bleeds for all the reasons you live
