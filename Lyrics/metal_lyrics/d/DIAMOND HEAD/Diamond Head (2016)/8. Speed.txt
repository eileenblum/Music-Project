Yeah woman, Iâm still dreaming
About your sister, the love of my gun
You know she loves all my inspiration
And when she sings to me, my love becomes corrupt

Oh love

Now this woman, my kind of sickness
Such a rush in my veins, my heart it bleeds, it bursts
And all her pleasures could numb my feelings
But I just got to taste the thrill and quench my thirst

Oh love, oh love

Yeah cause I need speed
When Iâm dreaming
I need speed while Iâm living

Oh love, oh love
Wonât you cut my love

Oh now woman, take my hand
Wonât you bind my lust
Just shut me down for good
Helpless I am, lost in my addiction
Still feel the need for speed for the thrill and for that thirst

Oh love, oh love

Yeah cause I need speed
When Iâm dreaming
I need speed while Iâm still living

Cause I need speed
When Iâm dreaming
I need the speed while Iâm living
Cause I need speed, I need speed
I need speed

I need speed
