Leaking eyes
Smile at their masters
Deforming pride
Cripples the anchor

When they answer to the free
Trialled for their greed
Justice prevails when youâre
Hearing them scream

Enough with this faction
Bleeding the truth
The end of the era
Will be here soon

Evil minds
They hide in the tower
Teething denial
Contorting the hours

When they answer to the free
Trialled for their greed
Justice prevails when youâre
Hearing them scream

Enough with this faction
And bleeding the truth
The end of the era
Will be here soon

Our time is now

Kill all the fascists
Extinguish their breed
Hang all those bastards
From every tree

Call to arms
To strengthen the legion
Dismantle the wall
For the sake of the children

When they answer to the free
Trialled for their greed
Justice prevails when youâre
Hearing them scream

Enough with this faction
And killing the truth
Itâs the end of the era
It will be here soon

Woh, woh, woh
Cause our time is now

Kill all the fascists
Extinguish their breed
Hang all those bastards
From every tree

Lynch all the fascists
Finish the deed
String up those bastards
Who shackle the free
