A timeless veil was lifted
As the lightning struck
Piercing waves echo the sounds above
Sent to reclaim a nation
With steel that never rusts
In every faithful heart
May sirens guide you, grant you gifts of love

Through it all
Countless years away
Settled like a stone
Diamonds are forever

Through it all
Countless centuries
Settled in their bones
Diamonds are forever
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Blackest light inspires youthful minds
Titan tales gifted to present times
Sent to awake a nation
Bolts of electric lust
To every open heart
The sirens they will find you fill you up

Through it all
Countless years away
Settled like a stone
Diamonds are forever

Through it all
And countless centuries
Settled in their bones
Diamonds are forever
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Through it all
Countless years away
Settled like a stone
Diamonds are forever

Through it all
And countless centuries
Settled in their bones
Diamonds are forever
Diamonds are forever
Yeah, yeah, yeah
