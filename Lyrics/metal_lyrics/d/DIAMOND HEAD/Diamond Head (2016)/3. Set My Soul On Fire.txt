Lost my head while sleeping with your madness
Your ink and bones are the weapons of disasters
Hate the witness, silence in oppression
Burn their scriptures, write your gospel, change the nation

Yeah, yeah, set my soul on fire
Yeah, yeah, set my soul on fire

Reign on earth let the puppets kill their masters
The silver nooses fill the streets before the rapture
Blacked out windows bleached for new redemption
The city weeps, the pieces set, reclaim the nation

Yeah, yeah, set my soul on fire
Yeah, yeah, set my soul on fire

Before today I lit this fire
Before this day I Iived this lie

Unmarked doors, no more tribute to the tower
Now their strings are cut, the people have the power

Yeah, yeah, set your soul on fire
Yeah, yeah, set that soul on fire

Before today I lit this fire
Before this day I Iived this lie

Yeah set my soul
Yeah set my soul on fire
