O.K. No surrender, I've got fear running down my spine
And back to sender, this may be my last time
I get the gun now, over the top to death
Watch them cry, Watch them die
We won't be back again
No no, we won't be back
No no, we won't be back
No no, we won't be back
Please remember, remember me from my past
Please be tender, Momma, this letter may be my last
I get the gun now, over the top to death
Watch them cry, Watch them fly
We won't be back again
No no, we won't be back
No no, we won't be back
No no, we won't be back
Oh no we won't be back again
No no we won't be back again
No no we won't be back again
No no we won't be back again
I've been telling you
We won't be back
We won't be back
