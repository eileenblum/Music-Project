I've been crying baby, oh there's no denying
I've been doing my best, I know I'm gonna keep on trying
Ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody to love
Ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody, ain't got nobody to love
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
Somebody come to me, I don't like what it is to be losing
I need somebody's loving, I don't want no more self abusing
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
I'm gonna get it honey, ooh yeah
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
I don't got, I don't got nobody's love
