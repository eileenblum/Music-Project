Oh Babe
I can recall the day
Close enough to make me feel bad
Seems like only yesterday
Still in my heart it makes me sad

Oh no, oh no
Don't you ever leave me baby
Oh no, oh no
Don't you ever leave me
Oh no, oh no
Don't you ever leave me baby
Oh no, oh no
Don't you ever leave me

I can remember that night I cried
The love we had, you said you don't give me no more
And as you kissed my lips goodbye
I called out to you now to close the door

Oh no, oh no
Don't you ever leave me baby
Oh no, oh no
Don't you ever leave me
Oh no, oh no
Don't you ever leave me baby
Oh no, oh no
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you leave me baby
Don't you leave me baby
Don't you leave me baby
Don't you leave me baby
Don't you leave me baby
Don't you leave me baby
