[Tatler / Tart / Wilcox]

I will give you all I've got to give
Win all your love for me
I have got to have you someday
Because that's my destiny yeah
I need your trust
Desire, honey, I'm on fire
Your love gives me power
I need it now to aspire

Now you see I'm coming around again
You gotta lay it all on me
I've told you once, I won't tell you again
Fulfil my fantasy
I need your lust
Guidance, honey and your reliance
Faith, gives me power
Feed the flame of my desire

Just give it to me, I need it
Just give it to me, I gotta feel it, gotta feel it
Just give it to me, I need it
Just give it to me, I gotta feel it, gotta feel it
Give in to me, don't fight it
Give it to me, I need, I need it
Trust, desire
Honey, I'm on fire
Your love, give me power
I need it now to aspire

Give it to me, I need it
Just give it to me, I gotta feel it, gotta feel it
Give in to me, don't fight it
Give it to me, I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it, I need it
Give it to me
