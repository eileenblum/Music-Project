[Tatler / Tart / Wilcox]

I crept in through the night
Your body silky smooth so warm and nice
You never felt my touch
You never knew that I laid right by your side
Am I dead or living?
I came in from the cold
To wrap you up in my misty cloak
Only you can set me free
Open up and tell me what you see
Am I dead or living or am I dreaming this time?
Cause the air that I breathe is and this path that I walk is breaking
Am I dead or living am I dreaming
I will come alive at night
To take your life as a sacrifice
And as the daylight breaks
Blood runs cold and my body aches
Am I dead or living or am I dreaming this time?
Cause the air that I breathe is and this path that I walk is breaking
Am I dead or living am I dreaming

[Chorus:]
Am I dead am I dead or living
Am I dead am I dead or living
Am I dead am I dead or living
Am I dead am I dead or living
Am I dead
