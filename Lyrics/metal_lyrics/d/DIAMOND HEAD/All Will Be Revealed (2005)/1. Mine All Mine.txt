It's killing me. It's driving me
These suicidal tendencies inside of me
Can't take the pain it's all to much
If I set you free, then you're free to love
But not another man can look in your eyes
You know there's only me who satisfies
There's not another soul that you can trust
I can't imagine these ties cut
How can this be my love?
I don't think I ask for much
Baby please
Mine all mine, all mine
Mine all mine, all mine
Mine all mine, all mine
If I can't have you're love
Mine all mine, all mine
Mine all mine, all mine
Mine all mine, all mine
If I can't have your love no one can
I lose control can't take no more
Like a wounded dog barking at your door
The lights are on but no ones home
There's a fire still burning in my soul
Can't stand to see you with a another man
Ain't gonna let you make another plan
There's not another soul who you can trust
I can't imagine these ties cut
How can this be my love?
I don't think I ask for much
Baby please

[Chorus:]
Can't you see, it's killing me
These suicidal tendencies inside of me
Can't let you go, can't set you free
The anger grows inside of me
I lose control, can't take no more
Another life with out me in store
Your raptured soul was mine to own
This anger grows inside more and more

[Chorus]
