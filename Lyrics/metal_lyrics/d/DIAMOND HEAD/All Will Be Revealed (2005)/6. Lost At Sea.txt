[Tatler / Tart]

It's easy when you're near me
I get drunk and I need more
Always tripping in the presence of this beauty that lies before
Just like a falling star your reach is too far
Can never find where it ends
Cause you come and you go like the rivers will flow
You're the universe that never ends
Floating no gravity
I'm a fading effigy
I get lost cant find my way
I'm a ship that's lost at sea
There's no direction for me
Help me find my way
I just gotta live another day
In the night you'll be my satellite
Shooting across the sky
Always beaming this ray of light
Are you waiting to be my guide?
Like a falling star your reach is too far
I can never find where it ends
Cause you come and you go like rivers will flow
You're the universe that never ends
Floating no gravity
I'm a fading effigy
I get lost cant find my way
I'm a ship that's lost at sea
There's no direction for me
Help me find my way
I just gotta live oh yeah
I'm in the deepest part of this blue
No one to save me can push me through
You'll be my beacon light in the dark
Help me find my way
