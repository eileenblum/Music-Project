[Tatler / Tart / Wilcox]

Listen baby
Our love has fallen apart
How can you let this be?
Till death do us part?
A promise you just couldn't keep
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Baby why you being so blind
Why don't you just see?
There's one life under this sun
I gotta find a new relief
Now the debt man's coming and the hound dog's bark
Breaking these chains ain't a stroll in the park
Out in the cold and it's breaking my heart

Hey now listen baby
Don't worry about the money
It's a fifty, fifty split
But if I pay you alimony, how am I suppose to live, yeah
Hey, hey, how am I suppose to live

Now the tax man thinks I've got something to hide
A job that was cash in hand
Your wife said now you ain't getting along
She's gonna find herself a better man
Hold on little lady, your moving way to fast
I just wanted a break, to bring the good times back

Don't worry about the money
It's a fifty, fifty split
If I pay you alimony, how am I suppose to live
Don't worry about the money
It's a fifty, fifty split
If I pay you alimony, how am I suppose to live, yeah
I'm down on my knees
You got me begging, please
Cause I can't live
I can't live
