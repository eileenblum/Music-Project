[Tatler / Tart]

In your eyes I can tell
That there's someone who's cast a spell
I have tried through all this madness
Now these chains are pulling me through hell
I was led and I led myself to believe
Nothing's gonna break this unity
I didn't mean to be so cruel, to be so cold
Just lead me on to the gates of Babylon
So now hold on when life gets rough
There's room for the two of us
Don't leave me like this
Don't leave me in broken pieces
Don't leave me in broken pieces oh, no, no, babe
So baby don't leave me in broken pieces
In my eyes you will see
All the truth eventually
I have smiled through all your sadness
Cause I know it's never meant to be
I was led and I led myself to believe
Nothing's gonna break this unity
I didn't mean to be so cruel, to be so cold
Just lead me on to the gates of Babylon

[Chorus]

It's getting harder to breath You got me down on my knees
I got nothing but the memories

[Chorus]
