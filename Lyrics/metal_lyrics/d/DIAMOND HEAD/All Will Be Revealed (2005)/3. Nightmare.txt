[Tatler / Tart]

Well my pillow feels like stone
On a bed of nails I roll
The more I scare the bigger you become
As the sky greets the dawn
The dark will cloud the sun
There's a time to die unknown to everyone
I've been told it's here for the taking
I've been sold on the dreams you've been making
I don't know what you've been contemplating
When the lights go out, I'm left in the dark
You make me play my evil part
Wake me from this nightmare, I don't wanna sleep alone
I'm little bit scared of falling to deep, I
So wake me from my nightmare, I don't wanna sleep alone
I'm little bit scared of falling to deep, I
I wanna know if you can here my call
Cause it's loud and clear
You gotta catch my fall dispel my fear
Soaking in this sweat
To many thoughts running through my head
The darkest hour is just before the dawn
Don't wanna stand in a crowd
I'm drowned in the sound
The more I scare the bigger you become
I've been told it's here for the taking
I've been sold on the dreams you've been making
I don't know what you've been contemplating
When the lights go out, I'm left in the dark
You make me play my evil part
Wake me from this nightmare, I don't wanna sleep alone
I'm little bit scared of falling to deep, I
Wake me from my nightmare, I don't wanna sleep alone
I'm little bit scared of falling to deep, I
It's a nightmare. I'm living in a nightmare
It's a nightmare. I'm living in a nightmare, yeah
. Can you here me, can you here my call?
Cause it's loud and clear, you gotta catch my fall
Dispel my fear, from this nightmare, from this nightmare, fucking nightmare
