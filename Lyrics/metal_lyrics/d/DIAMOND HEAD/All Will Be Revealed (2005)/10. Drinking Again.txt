[Tatler / Tart / Wilcox]

Monday morning and my head is feeling bad
I need a bolt of lightning just to get me out of bed
Don't you know that life's a bitch and then your gonna die
I feel like the king of the blues I think I was born to cry
That's why I'm drinking again
Drowning all my sorrows
Drinking again
I'm drinking like there's no tomorrow
Drinking again, drinking again, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so dependant on the needs of my sin
My one and only friend, its gonna do me in
When life has dealt all its toughest cards
These wounds just don't heal; I'm bleeding from the scars
Drinking again
Drowning all my sorrows
Drinking again
Drinking like there's no tomorrow
Drinking again, drinking again, yeah, yeah, yeah

How does it feel to lose the power, to lose the will?
When you're down and out and in need of a friend
I turn to Jim or Jack to lend me a hand
That's why I'm drinking again
Drowning all my sorrows
Drinking again, drinking again, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's why I'm drinking again
Fixing again, yeah, yeah, yeah
