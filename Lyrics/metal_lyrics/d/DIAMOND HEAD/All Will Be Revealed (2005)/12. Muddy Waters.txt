[Tatler / Tart]

Out my window the sky is looking grey
I poured my wine and roll myself a jay
I missed my ride on the early morning train
I wonder if my life will be the same
I see that this leads me astray
My defence is down when I'm in this daze
I'm stoned
We all need to feel the sun
We all need to feel someone
Like the grass needs the rain to grow
With every high there's always a low
Getting high, feeling low
Muddy waters on my radio
I take my time, nowhere to go
Muddy waters on my radio
Looking back to all my yesterday's
All I cared for was the latest craze
I missed my chances will they ever come again
I wonder if my life will be the same
I see that this leads me astray
My defence is down when I'm in this daze
I'm getting lazy in a smoky haze
I'm stoned

[Chorus]

I see that this leads me astray
My defence is down when I'm in this daze
I'm getting lazy in a smoky haze
I'm stoned
We all need to feel the sun

[Chorus]

Feel the sun warm your soul
Shine on me, shine on every one
Drink my wine smoke my blow
Got my music pumping on my radio
