[Tatler / Tart]

Don't look for satisfaction
There's no meaning when you try
If this is your intension
I will be your alibi
If you could feel the weight of my heavy load
You will come to realize
Walk a million miles in my shoes
You will never find your paradise
All will be revealed my friends
What goes around comes around again
Footsteps in the sands of time
Loving you was my only crime
Heal my condition
Take this thorn from my side
Lend me your religion
I will be your alibi
If you could feel the weight of my heavy load
You will come to realize
Walk a million miles in my shoes
You will never find your paradise

[Chorus x2]

All will be revealed my friends
All my, my, my friends
All will be revealed my friends
