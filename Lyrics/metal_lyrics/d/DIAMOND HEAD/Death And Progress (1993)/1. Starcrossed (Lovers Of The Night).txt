Flyin' high, starcrossed lovers of the night
Flyin' high, starcrossed lovers of the night

You're flying high into a sky of screaming stars
Across a universe erected in your heart
Where tomorrow always comes from yesterday's departed
Crimes...Designs...Mischief on your mind
Venus in her chariot of fire draws her flame
Passion pours herself a drink and calls you by her name
Slippin'...Slidin'...Sacrificing love for something nameless
that seems a little nearer to your dreams are here
Take another cup of sin and fill it up
Take another sip of hemlock to your lips
Be deceived by lies and you're flying high

Flyin' high, starcrossed lovers of the night
Flyin' high, starcrossed lovers of the night

A kind of atrophy affected you at birth
So instead of living you decided you were dead
Lovers of the night in your confusion
You stand and then you fall

In your illusion
And you'll try flyin' high
You better come down, still flying high
You better come down, you're on the moon
You better come down
