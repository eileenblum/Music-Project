All that I see...in your eyes is truth,
All that I am...is because of you...oh
All that I have I will give to you my friend
All that there is, all that I am,
Until the very end

I'm calling out to the silent night
I'm calling out your name...oh
Calling out to the son and the light,
Calling out your name

Oh now, see what you see.
That you really love me
Oh my life is clear
To be near

How still is the night without your touch
Cold are my tears without your love
...without your love

You're all that I am all that I need
All that I can be
Something so strong to hold up my world so I can be free
I can be heard

Calling out to the silent night
I'm calling out your name...oh
Calling out to the son and the light,
Calling out your name

Oh now, see what you see.
That you really love me
Oh Lord my life is clear

But I'm out here in a field of dreams.
Dreams

Callin', callin' callin' out to the son
Callin' out 'til you come
Callin' out in my shame
Callin' your name
