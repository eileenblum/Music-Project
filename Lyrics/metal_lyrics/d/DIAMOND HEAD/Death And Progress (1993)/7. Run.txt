The dogs are howling and the night is black enough to touch
So hold up that fire burning flame of love
And when the darkness comes like it does for us all
You'd better run to my world

And we'll never come down when we're up, we're up
And we'll never stop trying
Ooh baby when it's tough, it's tough

But what can I do when I'm loving you
And there's only need, the need for us too
I'm racing to you on the breath of fire
My lips are open with that sweet desire

So come running to me yeah
Run, like the wind to my heart
Don't stop, run to my world
Run, to my mountain top
Run, til you drop

And we've got nothing but time
In a world of lies
But when I see love right there in my baby's eyes

I can hold on to that something we've got
I can be strong, just strong enough for the two of us
Into the shadows of love we go
A familiar heartland at the edge of home
On a long road I'll see you there

Run, like the wind to my heart
Don't stop, run to my world
Run, to my mountain top
Run baby run baby run baby run baby
Run, don't stop, ooh run baby run, ooh run baby run
Hold on to that fire burning flame of love
Run yeah run
Run to my world
Run to my mountain top
Run 'til you drop
