I can't help myself.
One aim one try.
One chance one eye.
So come on lets fly

Ooh desire.
Tell you once.
Won't tell you twice.

When the spirit moves the world we're gonna start a fire.
A fire.

Just one beat,
just one heart
Just one beat,
just one heart
I can't help myself.
I can't help myself.
I can't help myself.
Baby I can't help myself

One sound,
One band,
Moving free in electric land
Never running for cover

Someday soon you'll see us next to you.
And we can dance like we are two.
That's true,
like lovers.
Like lovers

Just one beat,
just one heart
Just one beat,
just one heart
I can't help myself.
I can't help myself.
I can't help myself.
Baby I can't help myself

Nothing like this dream come true
Nothing like my time with you
You're a perfect friend of mine
A rock that still should stand all time

One aim,
one try
One tear,
one eye
Ooh desire.
One sound,
one band,
walkin' free in electric land

Gonna start a fire.
I can't help myself.
Ooh we're gonna start a fire.
We can't help ourselves.

Just one beat,
just one heart
I can't help myself.
I can't help myself.
I can't help myself.
Baby I can't help myself
