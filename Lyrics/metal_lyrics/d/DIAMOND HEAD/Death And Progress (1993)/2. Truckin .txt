Black clouds in a red sky. No light but the war fires
No time, like the time of our lives.
It's the crime of our lives, Flashing by
Too much affectation, no love in your frustrations
so we fail, how can we sit and just sit while this world goes to shit
Hide. Think you can hide yourself away?
Hide. When there ain't no peace on earth today.
Get runnin', it's comin'
Wheel goin' round round.
World comin' down down
Black bell rings out the old ways
Death comes to steal the new day
All secrets to be revealed. After all these years
It shall be fulfilled. No time for you to hide
It's gonna run you into the ground.
Hide. When there ain't no peace on earth today.
It's comin', get runnin'.
Look through the darkness and see it come.
You can't escape, you gotta face it head on.
No time to burn, no time to slide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
What have we done now?
No time to burn, no time to slide
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Truckin' Truckin'
Feel the weight bearing down, down
Truckin' Truckin'
When there ain't no peace on earth to be found.
No time, in a stop sign
No light, on the dark side
No fight, in the man who can't live with the self that he learned how to.
Hide. Think you can hide yourself away?
Hide. When there ain't no peace on earth today.
Truckin' Truckin'
Looking to run you into the ground
It's comin', get runnin'
All our souls goin' down down.
Wheels goin' round round.
