I've tried believin' even tried cheatin' myself
of almost everything just to fashion reason out of what
must have been nothin' at all

Now I can't when exactly I saw through the darkness and into the light
Fantastic as it was it was cool and bright
Like on a steely night of shadows

Still far from home
When I came round
I saw myself on a merry go round
With my heart on the ground
And there I see
The rains coming down to wash away the dream we found
Lyin' there for all to see in the dust of memories

Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found
Now there's nothing left for me
But you can set me free

I won't believe ya neither deceive ya when you say we gotta carry on
'Cos I know the dream is over
The one we shared so long...too long

When we could have been getting on just being friends
And not holding on to the past

Which is just sand
I guess we try to belong
'Cos we have to be strong just to get it done
But I was on the ground most of the time
On a merry go round looking up but going down

And there I see the rains comin' down to wash away the dream we found
Lyin' there for all to see in the dust of memories
Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found
Now there's nothing left for me

Can you see? The rain beat down, rain come down
But what can we do with a thing like you
A heart with a hard on for ignorance
A child of fools where nothing rings true

In a myth that's cruel, where I see the cross
You see the nail, where you see the mytsery I see the failure
And it's bringing me down, I'm just a clown
On a merry go round looking up but going down

And there I see the rains comin' down to wash away the dream we found
Lyin' there for all to see in the dust of memories
Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found
A spider fingered vice all sugar and spice

Runnin' down my face feelin' like black rain
Clawin' under my skin and running through my veins
Like a poison I must suck just to change my luck
Where the rain beats down to wash away the dream we found

Rain beat down...down...rain beat down
Down Down Down Down Down Yeah
Rain beat down...Dream come down
