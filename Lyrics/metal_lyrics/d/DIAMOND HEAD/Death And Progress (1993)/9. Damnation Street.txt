Ever since school days
I've walked a fool's way
With no love to find me
No dream to hide me

No kindness inside this heart with a stone's kiss
Just a short fall to the dawn,
when you're walking on dead man's feet

Down on Damnation street
You got nobody's love
Down on Damnation street
We got nobody's love
Walkin', Walkin', Walkin' Down on Damnation Street

Did you ever have a chance of finding someone who needs you?
This world has got itself
And there's nothing for the likes of you and me
Without love

You'll try it, you'll buy it, you'll find it empty
As a stones kiss

Just like your date with Jesus
When you're walking on dead man's feet
Down on Damnation street
You got nobody's love
Down on Damnation street
We got nobody's love
Walkin', Walkin', Walkin' Down

Better get on your knees
Humility please
Gotta pray to be free
&gt;From the slavery of freedom
Free to be nothing

21st Century here and now
Then gone like a thief in the night

Walkin' Damnation Street walking
Walkin' Damnation Street walking
Just goin' down, down, just going
Down, just goin' down, down, just going
Down down down on Damnation Street
