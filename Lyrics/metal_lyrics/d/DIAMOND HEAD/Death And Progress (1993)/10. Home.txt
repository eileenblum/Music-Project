On the morning of tomorrow somethin' gonna crack.
Better not be me...'cause i'm on my way back. Home.. better look out...
I'm around the bend five hundred horse power.
One thousand miles of interstate between you and me this hour.

Home... better look out.

White line speed fever full beam electric eye.
Run 'em down in rain town Mac truck flashin' by.
Wheels turn gas burn hold on to the road train.
Spinnin' on the sound of a fuel injection.

Oh yeah... Home.... Ooh yeah.
Home.... that's where my heart is.
Home.... that's where my heart is. Home...

Let me tell you now thaat's where I wanna be
I'd crash through any barrier, to change a point of view.
Oh I'd break down the walls of hell to be back there with you
so i'm coming home and I hope my aim is true.

Home...better look out
Home.... that's where my heart is.
Home.... that's where my heart is. Home...

Lover I believe you when you say that I'm the one
But the rumours of another man...oh
watch my wheels turn heart yearn white line that never stops.
Wheels turn road burn tacho turn like a clock

Black sky revs high radio tuned to rock..rock..rock..rock..Comin' home 
Home.... that's where my heart is.
Home.... that's where my heart is.
Turbo charged deadline get a hit in 66.
Nightline to stateline 1000 up gear shift

White line speed fever full beam electric eye.
Run 'em down in rain town Mac truck flashin' by.
18 gear NV8 HGV TCR 13 tonne heads hot turn it off 10.4 ohh

Home.... that's where my heart is. Home...
'Cos i'm a white light electric eye, wheels turn. Go flashin' by
ooh yeah...home...ooh yeah...home..ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...
