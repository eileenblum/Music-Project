Ah ah ah I'm screamin' now at the top of my head
Can't keep my silence in place full of dread
Just gotta hole in the ground for my bed
I don't eat, 'cause I ain't fed

Ain't there a new world for us in your head
'Cause we are here now and we ain't dead
We ain't gonna give it up
Tell it to the Lord above

We ain't gonna let you down 'til you come and get it done
And we got Paradise won

Paradise Paradise Paradise Paradise Paradise Paradise

We gonna tear down this house of your dreams
Kick it in till the enemas gone
Don't stop for nothin' 'til we dug our way out
Get it done, Paradise won

Ain't there a new world for us here instead
'Cause we are here now and we ain't dead
We ain't gonna give it up
Tell it to the Lord above

Paradise Paradise Paradise Paradise Paradise Paradise

Little monkey's on an elevator
Whores and pimps with teeth like alligators
Just putting junk on the funkin' table
Building up another Tower of Babel
We got a prison made from dreams and deceit
Gotta monkey on our back every week

Just gotta hole in the ground for my bed
I don't sleep 'cause I ain't dead
We ain't gonna give it up
Tell it to the Lord above

We ain't gonna let you down 'til you come and get it done
And we got Paradise won
In pretty little Paradise oh
In pretty little Paradise where they

See no evil.
Speak no evil.
Hear no evil

Paradise Paradise Paradise Paradise
Gonna rip it up and start again
