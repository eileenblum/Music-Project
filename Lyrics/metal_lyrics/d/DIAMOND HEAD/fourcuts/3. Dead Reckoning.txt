New York City
New York time 2084
Business man makes a deal for a nuclear war
Time is right, split the atom, and the Berlin wall.
Bring your dead
Nuclear holocaust will fall
Dead reckoning
Dead reckoning
Make a deal
Time is right to start your fight
Friends are here, all are waiting for the night
Just reckon, to see if its alright
??? Dead reckoning
Dead reckoning
City weeps, children run to hide their skins
Time will stop, as the nuclear war begins
???? Children die, but I'm sure no-one can win
New York City
New York time 2085
Business man, he is dead no-one left alive
Saturn sky, a fire has just arrived
I can see, what a waste for the tears you cried
Dead reckoning
Dead reckoning
Dead reckoning
Dead reckoning
Dead reckoning
I reckon you're dead
