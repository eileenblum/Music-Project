Four O'clock in the morning now
Well I can't sleep for love
Been waiting for you to call
To say you love me enough

It clouds my head that unhappy night
Please forgive every word
I see it all much clearer now
It all seems so absurd

But my plane leaves at 10a.m.
We both know I must go
To return I must be told
That you know what I know

Call me, baby Call me
Call me, baby Call me

To tell the truth I don't want to go
So say you want me to stay
You are more than all to me
This is no game that I play

But my plane leaves at 10a.m.
We both know I must go
To return I must be told
That you know what I know

Call me, baby Call me
Call me, baby Call me
Call me, baby Call me
Call me, baby Call me

But my plane leaves at 10a.m.
We both know I must go
To return I must be told
That you know what I know

Say you love me, say you do
Let me tell you
Tell me that you want me to stay
baby, baby, baby
