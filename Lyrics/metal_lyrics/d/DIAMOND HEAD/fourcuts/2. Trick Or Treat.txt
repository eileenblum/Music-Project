I'd give her a chance, but she'd spit back in my face
Sweet little girl, don't you know you're a disgrace
You don't know what's right from wrong
You ain't got no god damn soul
Flames eat my heart can you feel my desire
I want to take you higher and higher
You don't know what's right from wrong
You ain't got no god damn soul
You don't know what's right from wrong
And still to you I give this song
Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat ( I can't say no)
Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat
You don't know what's right from wrong
You ain't got no god damn soul
Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat (you're just what I need)
Trick or Treat, Trick or Treat (I need your soul)
...
