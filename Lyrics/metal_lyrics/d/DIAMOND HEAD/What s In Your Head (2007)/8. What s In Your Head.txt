The world watched as you deemed justice done
Cry's of rejoice from a vengeful son
A thousand tears shed
A conscience you dread
What's going on going on?
Tell me what's in your head
Come on come on come on
Tell me now cause there's something wrong
Can't see the world through tainted glass
I sense there's trouble and it's coming fast

So many lies you sold for your fame
Now you live in a world of eternal shame
How do you sleep in your bed?
Filled with regret
What's going on going on?
Tell me what's in your head
Come on come on come on
Tell me now cause there's something wrong
Can't see the world, world
I sense there's trouble I sense trouble

You've always got someone to blame
So what's wrong? Tell me what's the news today?
You watch me as I disintegrate
It's all breaking down and I know it's too late
Ain't nothing gonna hide your shame
So what's wrong? Tell me what's the news today?

I can see your eyes filled with doubt
It's all in your mind just let it out
Now more tears are shed
From the lies that you spread
What's going on going on?
Tell me what's in your head
Come on come on come on
Tell me now cause there's something wrong
Can't see the world through tainted glass
I sense trouble I sense trouble

You've always got someone to blame
So what's wrong? Tell me what's the news today?
You watch me as I disintegrate
It's all breaking down and I know it's too late
Ain't nothing gonna hide your shame
So what's wrong? Tell me what's the news today?

You've always got someone to blame
So what's wrong? Tell me what's the news today?
You watch me as I disintegrate
It's all breaking down and I know it's too late
