Tonight oh Tonight
Let's leave it all far behind
Tonight oh tonight
All the stars are shining bright

And the face in the moon has the blackest eyes
Surrounded by an infinity of fires
Listen to the wind you can here it cry
This burning light is sure to die

Tonight oh tonight
Gonna leave this world far behind
Tonight oh tonight
All the stars are shining bright

Someday we'll find our paradise
Release the fears that control your mind
Never let this fire die out tonight
Lying underneath this midnight sky

Tonight oh tonight
All the stars are shining bright
Tonight yes tonight
Make a wish and hold on tight

It's the darkest blackest night of all
And were waiting for the stars to fall
Let's treasure this moment in time
Forever and always be mine
Forever and always
Forever and always
Forever and always
Forever and always
Forever and always and always and always and always and always
