Ok here I am
I stand before you now
Where shall we begin?
Say you want it now

Cry, Cry
Yeah when you pull me in
High so high
My skin on your skin

Don't hide yourself away
I'm gonna take you today
Trust me don't have no doubt
I'll make you scream and shout

We can play for hours
As long as we can dare
Nothing can stop me now
Oh let me take you there

Cry, Cry
Yeah when you pull me in
High so high
My skin on your skin

Don't hide yourself away
I'm gonna take you today
Don't ever let me out
I'll make you scream and shout
Hey, hey
I'll make you scream and shout
Yeah, oh
I'm so high, yes, so high
So high, I'm so high

Cry, Cry
Yeah when you pull me in
So high, high
My skin on your skin
