Body's fighting in the street
I've been living in the ghetto trying to make ends meet
Keep the wolf from my door
Can't rest don't get no sleep
Living in this city it's alive with knife crime on the street

I can here the sirens wail
Hear the noise of breaking glass
Another man's blown away from hate born from the past
Count your coffin nails or try to make a stance
You wanna fight the world alone
A revolution never lasts

Don't make me a victim
I'm not a preacher man oh no
I'm gonna keep my distance
I'm not taking sides
I got no religion man
I just live my life

On every corner stands a whore
Another man robbed of his life
Stole the money to make a score
Now the streets are all alight
Has paradise closed its door?
Shall I walk towards the light?
Fate deals the final hand
I'm just trying to stay alive

[Chorus]

Around every corner there could be a war
I've got to watch my back
I'm going a little crazy
I'm about to crack
Going fucking crazy
Oh yeah
Going fucking crazy

Don't make me a victim
I'm not taking sides
I got no religion man
I just live my life
I'm just a simple man
I just live my life
