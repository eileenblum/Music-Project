I'm here to guide you let me take your through your dreams
I'll be your master you're the puppet on my string
I want to take you show you places that I've seen
Through magic gardens every door opens for me

Yeah you know you know there's a better life for you
Yeah let go breathe slow you know it's what you wanna do
Yeah you know you know your life ain't what it seems
So breathe slow let go let go

Love will reign supreme
Love will reign supreme
Love will reign supreme

Don't be afraid take a pill to numb the pain
Live you life and suffer or take your life in vein
I'll take you flying over seas of tears
The lightning flashes and crashes at my please

Yeah you know you know you got to follow through
Yeah let go breathe slow it's totally up to you
So what you gonna do?

I'll be waiting when you fall
When the man he comes to call
I'm the key to all your doors
Run into the light and you'll be free

There's a beautiful place to be
In a land you can be queen
Where our love will reign supreme
Love will reign supreme

Yeah let go breathe slow you know it's what you wanna do
Yeah you know you know your life ain't what it seems
So breathe slow let go let go
