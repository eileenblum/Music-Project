Roll me another so I fall a sleep
And the stories you tell me are mine alone to keep
Close your eyes and hold me
I'm feeling so lonely I'm trembling inside
Don't let go

I'm calling out
Can you hear me when I cry?
I'm calling out
Oh I can't hide
I'm reaching out to touch the sky
I'm calling out
Calling out
Calling out
Calling out
Calling out
Calling out

Save me yes save me I'm starting to fall
My heart is wide open sow the seed and watch it grow
Close your eyes and hold me
I'm feeling so lonely I'm trembling inside
Don't let go, don't let go

[Chorus]
