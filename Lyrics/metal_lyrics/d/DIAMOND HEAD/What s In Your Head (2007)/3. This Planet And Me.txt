Just go easy with it
This life is planned out to be
Don't put the lights around me
All my spirits break free
So it's now that I've decided
To hide behind these closed doors
I'm being pulled every which way
I can't give anymore

Don't want to be on the radio
Don't want my picture taken no more
Don't want to be in the video
There coming now to steel my soul
I don't think I'm liked that much
I'm out of reach and out of touch
Don't want to be in the picture show
There coming now to steel my soul

Do you see my true colours?
Is there a crack in my disguise?
Deep down beneath the layers
Where my demons wait to rise
Don't wanna be a corporate target
Full of diamond coloured tales
I'm gonna get me off this planet
Red lights on systems failed

[Chorus]

So I'm leaving now and I wish you luck
Re-evaluate my life on earth
I'm gonna stop the world too look and see
Is it all about this planet and me?
So I'm leaving now and I wish you luck
Re-evaluate my life on earth
I'm gonna stop the world too look and see
It's all about this planet and me

I'm leaving now
I'm leaving now
I wish you luck
I'm leaving now
I'm leaving now
I'm leaving now
I'm leaving now
I'm leaving now
