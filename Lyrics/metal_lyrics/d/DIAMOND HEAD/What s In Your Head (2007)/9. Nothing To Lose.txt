All the people look the same
Something's got to give I need a change
So down this road I go
With Jimmy showing me the way to go
Got to free me got to break this chain
Get out get away a new town a new day
I wanna get me more
I can't be living a lie anymore
I'm gonna find what I'm looking for

Got nothing to lose
Nothing to prove
Nothing to live for anymore
Take it from me
I'm not what you see
I'm not the same man you knew before
I'm not the same
Baby I've changed

I was deep down in a hole
And I think I'm gonna lose control
Never had a hope in hell
Where I'm going only time will tell
Gonna take my chances let it roll
Get out get away a new town a new day
I wanna get me more
I can't be living a lie anymore
I'm gonna find what I'm looking for

Got nothing to lose
Nothing to prove
Nothing to live for anymore
Take it from me
I'm not what you see
I'm not the same man you knew before
Nothing to lose
Nothing to prove
I'm not the same man you knew before
I'm not the same baby I've changed
I'm gonna choose a path with a heart
And I really think it's time to start

Got nothing to lose got nothing got nothing to prove got nothing
I got nothing to lose got nothing I got nothing to prove got nothing
I got nothing I got nothing I got nothing to lose got nothing
I got nothing I got nothing I got nothing to lose nothing to prove
