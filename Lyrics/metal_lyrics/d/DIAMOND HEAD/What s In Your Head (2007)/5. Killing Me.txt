I light a fire to keep me warm
I see an illusion the remnants of a storm
And this fire gives me faith
And when the embers burn the fire reveals your face

What are we fighting for?
Innocent souls get washed ashore
Prove to me
As fate opens another door
Can't you see?
I don't need this shit no more
It's killing me killing me

I can't rely on you anymore
So many people say you don't know what you've got till it's gone
This road is bleeding ain't no turning back
I gave you red roses but you're cold heart turned them black

[Chorus]

Where do we go from here?
I don't know
I can't see a future with me here
So I'll go

Life's a riddle wrapped in mystery
Just the fragments of a fading memory
And this fire gives me faith
And when the embers burn the fire reveals your face

How long is this road we are on?
Tell me how long till another bomb
Tell me how long should we keep the faith?
Tell me how long till I retaliate
Retaliate
