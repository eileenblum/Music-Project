Crazy fool I was twisted jaded it's a crime to see
It's a desperate proposition you wouldn't let it be
A crazy fool I was wasted tainted my mind not my own
In a state of disillusion and I'm a long way from home

You know it really doesn't matter to me
You know it really doesn't matter to me
Doesn't matter what the future will be
Cause it really doesn't matter to me, no

Damn you fool hatred fixated is this really me
In a void of paranoia tell me what you see
Damn you fool created elated this thing inside my soul
I've gotta fight this demon before it takes control

You know it really doesn't matter to me
You know it really doesn't matter to me
Doesn't matter what the future will be
Cause it really doesn't matter to me

Let the rain come wash away my pain
Let the rain come wash away my pain
Oh I don't feel no pain
Oh I feel no pain

Crazy fool I'm wasted tainted my mind was not my own
In a state of disillusion I'm a long way from home

You know it really doesn't matter to me
You know it really doesn't matter to me
Doesn't matter what the future will be
Cause it really don't matter

Let the rain come wash away my pain,
Let the rain come wash away my pain
Oh I don't feel no pain
Oh I feel no pain
