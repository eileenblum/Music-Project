Sacrificed vandalized is how I feel
Scandalize traumatize do what you will
Sign the line and go to war
Ten thousand men won't free the cause

Tell me how do you feel?
Tell me how do you feel?
To waste such innocent life
Thrown into the fight
Pray for me
Cover me now
I gonna make it
I won't be shot down
Pray for me
Cover me
Pray for me
Cover me
Pray for me
Cover me now

Criticized victimized is how I feel
Hypnotized government lie's bow down to your will
Don't wanna see my name on that wall
To say I died for a worthy cause

Tell me how do you feel?
Tell me how do you feel?
To waste such innocent life
Thrown into the fight
Pray for me
Cover me now
I gonna make it
I won't be shot down
Pray for me
Cover me
Pray for me
Cover me
Pray for me
Cover me now
