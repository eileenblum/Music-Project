Wake Oh knights from thy slumber!
The land that you fought to keep good and green
Has fallen and needs you, needs you!
To fight once again!

Drink of this and take thy fill,
For the water falls by the wizard's will
Arthur awaits our day of need,
Then the King shall arise for all to see!

Ride white mares throughout England!
As Merlin foretold, the true knights of old
With Arthur our Saviour, Saviour!
Now fight for this land

Drink of this and take thy fill,
For the water falls by the wizard's will
Arthur awaits our day of need,
Then the King shall arise for all to see!
