Gaze beneath the darkling sky
With jewels above that shine on high
The green horizon fading
And the black of night cascading
The shadows born from the silhouetted forms
As the twilight world begins to fall

Within this world twixt day and night
By the blessed gift of second sight
The spirits are seen dancing
And wild depths of forgotten wilderness
As the thought of time is laid to rest

Laid to rest

Now as the host begins the fade
To melt away into the shade
Feel the urge to walk beyond, forever

Through the veil of our reality
I reach into their world
See the vision now with clarity
Watch as the dream unfurls

Roaming fat through field and fen
In the hope to catch a glimpse again
You know the host is our there
They're everywhere and nowhere
A vision seen, knowing no one shall believe
But the secret commonwealth's aware

The yearning for that secret realm
Which man denied but time has held
The underworld is calling
Reality is transforming
To leave behind all that weighed upon your mind
And to walk on with them by your side

By your side

But as the host begins the fade
To melt away into the shade
Feel the urge to walk beyond, forever

Through the veil of our reality
I reach into their world
See the vision now with clarity
Watch as the dream unfurls

And as the host begins the fade
To melt away into the shade
Feel the urge to walk beyond, forever

Through the veil of our reality
I reach into their world
See the vision now with clarity
Watch as the dream unfurls
