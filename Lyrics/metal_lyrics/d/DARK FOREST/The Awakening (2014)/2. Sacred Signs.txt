Out in the sweeping fields of golden grain
While summer still sits high upon his burning throne
And spirits out of time conjoin again
We wait to see the signs that long remained unknown

As the circles now appear
We see the shining silver spheres
Communication from the Earth
The living heart of Mother Earth!
We are re-born and know our worth

Call the sacred signs, the guardians of mankind
Restoring the harmony
Know the sacred signs, forever in our minds
Prepare for the journey ahead

Foretold in prophecies, an age will dawn
The race of men have fallen down upon their knees
Look to the signs and find yourselves re-born
Subconscious minds unite, forever to be free

Now the circles will appear
We leave behind all sense of fear
To the future we look on
United with the Earth, her son
The shadows plaguing us are gone!

Call the sacred signs, the guardians of mankind
Restoring the harmony
Know the sacred signs, forever in our minds
Prepare for the journey ahead

As the circles now appear
We see the shining silver spheres
Communication from the Earth
The living heart of Mother Earth!
We are re-born and know our worth

Call the sacred signs, the guardians of mankind
Restoring the harmony
Know the sacred signs, forever in our minds
Prepare for the journey ahead
