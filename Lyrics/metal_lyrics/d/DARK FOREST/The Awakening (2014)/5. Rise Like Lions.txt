No longer watching from the shadows
It's everywhere for all to see
Nowhere to hide, the all Seeing Eye
Will hunt you down, hunt you down!

Don't think allowed or share opinions
You're guilty until proven innocent
Do what you're told, you're not in control
Of your destiny, destiny!

Yet I won't surrender my will

We rise like lions
Break the chains of slavery
Rise like lions
No more fear, we will not obey!

They microchip the population
Freedom lies in devastation
Not long to go, so soon we will show
They've gone too far, gone too fat!

Rise like lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number
We'll break the chains and never will again
Be slaves to you, slaves to you!

And we will remember your fall

We rise like lions
Break the chains of slavery
Rise like lions
No more fear, we will not obey!

Now the time has come
For all, let everyone
Transcend this tyranny
Which has held us down

We rise like lions
Break the chains of slavery
Rise like lions
No more fear, we will not obey!
