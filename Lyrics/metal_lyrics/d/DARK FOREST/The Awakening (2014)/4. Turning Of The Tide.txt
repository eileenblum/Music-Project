Perfect skies if blue and white
The angel's wings were guiding clear sunlight
Down on the earth
Shone forth upon our clouded hills
Now metal skies are falling down on us
Without a sound

All that you thought was real
Are you the master of your own mind
Now breathe the air you thought so clean and pure
Our very souls cry out in pain

Rich, the bounty earth provides
Elixir of life is all around
Within our grasp
Yet poisoned soil and seed remain
Contamination sealing up our fate
The end of days

To take the place of God
Manipulate the natural course
Controlling all, even the will of man
The path to freedom ,overgrown

Dream of the waves, of the wind, of the stars
Dream of the past, knowing  who we are
Dream of a time when the sun will shine
For the dawn and the ending of night

Then the winds of change will sweep through the land
And the silver rain will fall
Wash away the dust which blinded our eyes
Cleansing the earth and humanity

To take the place of God
Manipulate the natural course
Controlling all, even the will of man
The path to freedom ,overgrown

Dream of the waves, of the wind, of the stars
Dream of the past, knowing  who we are
Dream of a time when the sun will shine
For the dawn and the ending of night
