I stand on the last horizon
Dark are my dreams again
To leave all the past behind and
Walk on to Penda's Fen

I hear the calling
Something deep inside of me
I thought I know it all
But things aren't as they seem
Am I not worthy
To call my self a son of this land
I've gone beyond the lies
And seen the hidden hand

Night is falling
The flame os burning
Guiding me towards the down

I stand on the last horizon
Dark are my dreams again
To leave all the past behind and
Walk on to Penda's Fen

What lies forgotten
Waiting just beyond our dream
What mysteries and wonder
Hides the pagan king
You see a demon
Tempting you from all you've been told
I see an angel bringing
Back the ways of old

Night is falling
The flame os burning
Guiding me towards the down

I stand on the last horizon
Dark are my dreams again
To leave all the past behind and
Walk on to Penda's Fen
