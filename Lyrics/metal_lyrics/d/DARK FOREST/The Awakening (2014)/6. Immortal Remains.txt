I drift through existential thought
This illness I have fought
Yes I dropped to my knees
Before this fell disease

And hence I leave this mortal coil
My bones cast the soil
Does death await us all
Or life forevermore

Lo! I hear the final melody
The phantom strings of death
My God, what shall become of me
Now I will

Take my last breath
All must meet with death
But they fear I now hold
Fades away, a new life I behold

Will I gaze into the void
The mind and heart destroyed
Let thoughts lie down and die
While eyes no longer cry

Or will I wake again to hear
A sweet voice calling clear
Will I see before my eyes
A golden swift sunrise

Lo! I hear the final melody
The phantom strings of death
My God, what shall become of me
Now I will

Take my last breath
All must meet with death
But they fear I now hold
Fades away, a new life I behold

Lo! I hear the final melody
The phantom strings of death
My God, what shall become of me
Now I will

Take my last breath
All must meet with death
But they fear I now hold
Fades away, a new life I behold
