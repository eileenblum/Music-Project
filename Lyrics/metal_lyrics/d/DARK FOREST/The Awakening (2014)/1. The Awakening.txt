Life eternal
Infinite consciousness, learning
That the world we know is
Nothing more than fragments of a dream

Taking back the essence of
Just who we really are
Everything and nothing
From the void into the stars

Know reality, illusory world
Voices from infinite consciousness heard
Transcending frequencies, vibrational realms
The harmony of creation is found

Vast awakening
seeing ourselves as we are
Now the time has come to
Overthrow deceivers of this world

And see possibilities
Of consciousness, divine
Freedom and the knowledge of the
Universal mind

Know reality, illusory world
Voices from infinite consciousness heard
Transcending frequencies, vibrational realms
The harmony of creation is found

See possibilities
Of consciousness, divine
Freedom and the knowledge of the
Universal mind

Know reality, illusory world
Voices from infinite consciousness heard
Transcending frequencies, vibrational realms
The harmony of creation is found

We will find our path to freedom
