I was born a son of this land
No lords, no masters
Free, like all, to live my own way
Bow down to no man

Stand up now your freedom calls!

Let torn wastelands grow
The fruit of this soil is our own
We're free to reap what we sow

Lords on high will do as they please
And sell what's not theirs
Rule our lives, destroy all we know
Our way of living

Stand up now your freedom calls!

Our deep roots are strong
Can't take us from where we belong
This land is ours, we are one!

Beneath the burning sky
You'll hear our voices cry
We're sons of England
And we're never letting go again

We all hold the power to shape
And change our future
Slaves get told, but we are free men
And we will not let go

Stand up now your freedom calls!

Where wild roses grow
Far from the industrial glow
There lies the land that we know

Beneath the burning sky
You'll hear our voices cry
We're sons of England
And we're never letting go again
