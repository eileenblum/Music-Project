Born of fire, a flame in the dark
Kept alight by the power of one desire
Return unto an age when freedom bloomed

Beneath the Oak and sycamore
Bonds forged to last forevermore

Down through the endless seasons of time
Our voices cry together
We'll never let our land be taken away
We'll never let our bonds be severed

Long ago we lived for every season
Long ago we truly knew this pleasant land

Time marched on, the knowledge was lost
And the sense of being, free was now long
dead and gone
They herd us well, artificial cities to dwell

Deep forest, golden pastures
They leave our hearts enraptured

We know the secrets nature holds
Once last and now recovered
We know our place, inside the greater scheme
We know the craft, our rights uncovered

Long ago we lived for every season
Long ago we truly knew this pleasant land
