Approaching steadfast from the eastern old world
Are the men which only time knows
Wind in their sails, flags at full mast
From the old world has the new world arose

Northmen of the new world stand
on guard for the north new world's glorious vast strands
We look to the sky, high above towering trees
high above plains and mountains; aurora borealis so free
Northstar guide us, pride us, provide us
With the strength to go on

Never will we fail, always prevail
Always the true north, strong and free...
