A fire burns in a small hut
By brothers of hearth surrounded
A hearth burns in a small fyrd
With brothers of hearth united

A flame that burns is a flame that lives
And a flame that lives is inside us
Through this flame is our past secure
And only our past can remind us

I remember them before us

A hearth burns in a dark place
By the flicker of hearth surrounded
A fire burns in a focused mind
The tools to fight are provided

A flame that burns is a flame that lives
And a flame that lives will guide us
Through this flame is our past secure
And only our past can define us

I remember them before us
