A night sky that is covered in stars is a brilliant map of time
and therein burns an evening star; so brilliant, so bright
But if a people forgets the source of its light
The map is a series of long lost paths
Follow this evening star, as long as it's bright
For as long as it's bright...

And I have seen the evening star fast fading..
I have seen the evening star long faded..

A fading star, a fading life
A fading map in the night sky
and lo! A new dawn will rise!
without this star in the sky
they'll act as so it were not
as if history didn't be
And lost are the times of old
and thus, a land without a history...
