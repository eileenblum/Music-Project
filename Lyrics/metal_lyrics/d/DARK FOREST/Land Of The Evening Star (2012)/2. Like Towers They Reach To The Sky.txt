The floor of the earth is shaded always here
In a world that only time knows
Silent stood these observers of old
They have seen all that came
And all that has now went

They've seen all that came and has went

Night falls and under the moon
The floor of the earth is still shaded
Unsilent stand these observers of old
In a world that now is invaded
Roaring up to the sky so high
The wind is the voice of these knowers of old
Rooted in the earth still secure
Are the guardians of memories and stories long untold

Like Towers
Reaching to sky above
Like towers they reach to the sky
