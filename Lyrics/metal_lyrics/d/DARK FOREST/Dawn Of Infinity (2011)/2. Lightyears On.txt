Fighting a foe that we can't comprehend
Thousands of fleets have now fallen
Our tactics are worn out, but help is at hand
Last chance to defend Earth before them

Slay those insurgents
Blast them to the nearest sun
Now that we're one hundred thousand strong

Vessel charged, the task before me, it's time to blur the stars

Lightyears on

Adrenaline surges as we open fire
A blistering photon array
Slim chance of survival, yet if we return
No one shall hear of this day

We're riders to the stars
The human race in aliens palm
We'll hunt them down and tear their world apart

Vessel charged, the task before me, it's time to blur the stars

Lightyears on
