Under the greenwood tree
We light with an outlaw bold
Swore oaths which we will uphold

Forced to flee into the forest
Or by our necks we'll swing
But we are free here under the greenwood
Now we live as kings

Hark now the hunting born
Rings out through the forest glades
We poach on the royal game

Stand defiant against the tyrants
Who bleed the country dry
Feed the poor, reward the deserving
Let arrows fly

Beneath the arcing boughs of green
A story is weaved
Come listen well this tale I tell
A legend woven through centuries gone
His tale lives on
So raise a glass to heroes past

Under the greenwood tree
We meet at the setting sun
With Robin the valiant one

Tales of brave deeds, men of honour
Who fought with sword and bow
Now let the fire dance to the music
Let the ale flow

Beneath the arcing boughs of green
A story is weaved
Come listen well this tale I tell
A legend woven through centuries gone
His tale lives on
So raise a glass to heroes past
