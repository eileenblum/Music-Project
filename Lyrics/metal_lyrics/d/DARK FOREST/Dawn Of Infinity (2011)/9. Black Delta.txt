The night is still cold and silent
The moon is resting high
I wait alone calmly watching
Gazing at the sky

I've been here once and I am certain
of the things that I saw
I feel compelled to sit here waiting
And see them once more

In the night sky
The things I've seen beneath the silver moon
In the night sky
They're calling me out there, a slave to this dark mystery

And all at once my senses sharpen
As I'm gripped with sudden fear
Out in the dark my eyes are straining
I know they will appear

And then they come, dark shapes moving
Swiftly through the sky
They're getting close, I can't out run them
Even if I try

In the night sky
The things I've seen beneath the silver moon
In the night sky
They're calling me out there, a slave to this dark mystery

A flash of light, my head is splitting
As I'm brought down to my knees
The time is lost, I can't remember
What it is I've seen

Yet still I know I must return there
And stare into the black
My mind is drawn, I cannot fight this
I know they want me back

In the night sky
The things I've seen beneath the silver moon
In the night sky
They're calling me out there, a slave to this dark mystery
