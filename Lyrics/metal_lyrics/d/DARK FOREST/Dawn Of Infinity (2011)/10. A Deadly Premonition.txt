Bright battalions are marching
They are due at the breaking of dawn
We await your command my Lord

Of this day I have forgotten
We shall ride out and meet them headlong
They shall fall upon our swords

Fall upon our swords

On the eve of battle
A vision clear to see
A deadly premonition
Foresees their victory

I see the death of many
I see my crumbling throne
But still we'll ride and meet them
We shall not alone

At the first rays of sunlight
Our reckoning day will begin
We'll fight but we will not win

Though the death dream has warned me
No mention of doom shall be told
Our troops will die fighting bold

Our troops will die fighting bold

On the eve of battle
A vision clear to see
A deadly premonition
Foresees their victory

I see the death of many
I see my crumbling throne
But still we'll ride and meet them
We shall not alone

Our troops will die fighting bold

On the eve of battle
A vision clear to see
A deadly premonition
Foresees their victory

I see the death of many
I see my crumbling throne
But still we'll ride and meet them
We shall not alone
