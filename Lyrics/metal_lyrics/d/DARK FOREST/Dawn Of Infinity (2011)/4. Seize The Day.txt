As the wind sweeps wild and free wherever it may blow
I stand on high with all beneath me that I used to know
The road will take me on a journey of uncertainty

I'm free, I'm my own self
Stood by what my heart felt
My life is in my own hands
Don't wait for tomorrow, seize the day!

Taking hold, I'm in control of my own destiny
And I will boldly meet whatever fate may throw at me
For like the wind, I'm wild and free wherever I may go
I journey on without a case, for freedom I now know

I'm free, I'm my own self
Stood by what my heart felt
My life is in my own hands
Don't wait for tomorrow, seize the day

I'm free, I'm my own self
Stood by what my heart felt
My life is in my own hands
Don't wait for tomorrow, seize the day
