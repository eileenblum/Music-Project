At the heart of all ancient leylines
Weaved throughout the mystical land
Earth and stone infused with a power
And a magic, deep as the myths have told

Feel the power soar
Surging through us all
The strength of the Tor

As the mist of eve climbs the hillside
All time is lost in the dark
Strange thoughts from a bygone era
Transported back to the days of yore

Feel the power soar
Surging through us all
The strength of the Tor

Far from the world that we know
The veil is getting thin now
A new horizon forms
And in the distance on high
The Tor is getting close now
Feel the power rising within, feel the force
The strength of the Tor

Strange lights, they dance in the twilight
Sweet music drifts through the air
As the entrance now is revealing
Pathways which lead to the underworld

Feel the power soar
Surging through us all
The strength of the Tor
