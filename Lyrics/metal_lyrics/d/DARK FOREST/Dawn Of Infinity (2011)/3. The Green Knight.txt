Far across this kingdom
I have rode with faith in my heart
To prove my worth and honour
I shall be true on my part

The fear I carry burdens me
As my fate draws close every day
I ride forth into the chapel
To close the deal that was made

Oh knight I dare to challenge thee
I'll seeketh then bestow on me
The grievous blow I gave to thee

Magic is wrought on a winters night
Emerald gleaming in the firelight
Keep thy strength and thy faith alive
Sir Gawain and the Green Knight

As warmth and comfort welcome me
Still all is not as it seems
To test my soul and body
A bargain thrice is agreed

And though temptation takes hold
I shall stay true to my court
The code by which I live my life
And this shield will be my support

Oh knight I dare to challenge thee
I'll seeketh then bestow on me
The grievous blow I gave to thee

Magic is wrought on a winters night
Emerald gleaming in the firelight
Keep thy strength and thy faith alive
Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
