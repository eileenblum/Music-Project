An altered reality
I don't remember
What I came from
And what has been

Forever drifting
Tearing through existence
Trying to restore unity
Each universe found and dashed in my persistence

The portal opens, rematerialise

Lord of the hourglass, the hourglass

Observing history
Chaotic collisions
Looking over possibilities
Restoring order
A loss of vision

Manipulation
Of the continuum
This is my curse
This is my godly inquisition

I navigate through, the righteous destiny I choose

Lord of the hourglass, the hourglass

This is the pathway
This reality could be
The solution
Restoration of our unity

This journey's over
Can I let my burden lie
Does our race have salvation
Or is this the wrong time to try

I navigate through, the righteous destiny I choose

Lord of the hourglass, the hourglass
