Journey through distant recollections
To a time that has begun to fade
So many thoughts and memories of lifetimes
Now gone by and taken to the grave
It is so hard to gather up the pieces
Of an age that's being laid to rest
No living memory will soon be left to tell us
Of the days which we should not forget

The stream of time is forever flowing
Drilling onwards endlessly
And dark, the view from behind is fading
Forgotten thoughts and memories
We strain to see back into the twilight
The past is swiftly leaving us
But faint, the voice from another era
May still be heard if you listen close

Wish I could see through the dark
What would I find as I saw past the veil

Through the shadows
As memories die
Time will keep the secrets
Forgotten years and days of our lives
And past the shadows
Where memories lie
Time will give the secrets
Echoing still as the years go by

We try to hold on to years behind us
And keep them safe within our mind
But what becomes when our soul's departed
And where are now these years to find
Somewhere beyond the fogs of ages
A gentle hand is taking care
Of all the lost days of summers, golden
You'll always find them waiting there

Wish I could see through the dark
What would I find as I saw past the veil

Through the shadows
As memories die
Time will keep the secrets
Forgotten years and days of our lives
And past the shadows
Where memories lie
Time will give the secrets
Echoing still as the years go by

It seems to me we cannot fully turn back
As I stand before this closing door
Yet I hold dear the echoes of past ages
'Cause I know I've been there once before
