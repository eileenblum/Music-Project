Into oblivion, drifting on and on
Awaiting death since any hope I had was gone
Revenge can change a man, turn his life around
A life that's given meaning when a purpose has been found

And I know the time is coming
And I see, it's getting clear
Can it be that the stars are waiting
To receive us now

Creation, no beginning, no end to the circle of life
Destination, the stars are calling my name
Now I'm swimming through the timeless ocean
Travelling to the future and past
I'll give this gift through my devotion
Of seeing life survive to the last

There's times I've wondered why this happened to me
Why was I chosen to control man's destiny
To jaunte into the heavens, galaxies await
The future of mankind, it's time to seal our fate

And I know the time is coming
And I see, it's getting clear
Can it be that the stars are waiting
To receive us now

Creation, no beginning, no end to the circle of life
Destination, the stars are calling my name
Now I'm swimming through the timeless ocean
Travelling to the future and past
I'll give this gift through my devotion
Of seeing life survive to the last

And I know the time is coming
And I see, it's getting clear
Can it be that the stars are waiting
To receive us now

Creation, no beginning, no end to the circle of life
Destination, the stars are calling my name
Now I'm swimming through the timeless ocean
Travelling to the future and past
I'll give this gift through my devotion
Of seeing life survive to the last
