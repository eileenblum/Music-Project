deep in the north
an arctic wind screams
its voice comforts the forests.
here warriors of northern hall guard.
ice sharp like steel
lit by the moon
the wind is voice of our gods
soon these roots will drink much blood.

Hail!
let this night be one of glory!
fight for your honor!
fight for our Gods!
let it be known!
that the north is eternal!
it remains untouched!

The fullmoon, lights their path
a wolf screams to the sky
six times one hundred men
holding hammers high
to the Golden Hall, they will ride
for Odin they will die
this land of forest and ice
dormant, it shall always lie.
