can you hear that raging thunder?
it sings so high in the sky
the echo of times, it pounds to us all
they pound the high worldly spike
and the brightest star, so bright it did shine
it filled us with guidance and pride
for in the times of battles, struggles, and wars
the fathers gave unto us mighty Northstar

and as I walk here
through the green of the black star-filled night
I can feel the call of the sky, with a voice of such nature
that I can connect with my surroundings, with a new level of total focus.
and in this environment, I can learn the ways of the past
to further myself in a way so different than the rest
so that one day, when I am called from up high
in the hall of eternals, looking down below, I may live on.

"hail now, to the northern sky
home of the ones before
shine o' brightest star
skywards, to Allfather's hall
home of the ones before
shine o' brightest star"

can you see that raging flame?
it burns so high in the sky
the illuminate of times, it shines to us all
the shining of that worldly spike
and the brightest star, so bright it did shine
it filled us with strong northern pride
for in the times of past, present, and on
the fathers gave unto us mighty Northstar
