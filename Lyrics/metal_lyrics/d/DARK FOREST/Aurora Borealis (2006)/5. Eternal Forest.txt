there is a kingdom of green
out where no man has walked
the only thing that sees this kingdom
is up in the skies
its they who walk the skies.

ice cold streams have flown for thousands of years
throughout the axe-age, the sword-age, the wolf-age
these streams have run eternal
and for one thousand more years, they will flow free
even after the age of the eternal snow.

by the Suncross, this kingdom will reign
by the gods, this eternal domain
stays a place so untouched by all
I will see it one day from almighty Golden Hall
