Lost and far from anywhere
A distant light ahead
You're shown into a crooked room
Corpses cooking in the fire
You're told to take your turn
Then darkness covers all your sight

Fear Dearg! Beware the red man at twilight
Fear Dearg! The faerie jester of Elfame is here

Wake up cold on a hillside
Left there all alone
With laughter ringing all around
Every night is a horror
When midnight comes around
You're haunted now, forevermore

Fear Dearg! Beware the red man at twilight
Fear Dearg! The faerie jester of Elfame is here
