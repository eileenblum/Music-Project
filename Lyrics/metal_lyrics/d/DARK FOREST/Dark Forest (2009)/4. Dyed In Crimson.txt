Walking through the country on a moonlit night
High up on a hill, a ruin from days of old, haunted so they say
A blood soaked scream cuts through the air

A girl lies slaughtered in the castle grounds
Kneeling by her side, a creature grotesque and foul, dying his cap in her blood
Paralysed with fear as it comes for me

Evil deeds are caught in the aether
Manifesting on the other side
Elementals are born in the darkness
Time for the Red Cap to spill blood again

Try to run away but there's a weight on me
Pulling me down as if the ruin is sinking into the depths of hell
A stab of pain, blood fills my mouth

Evil deeds are caught in the aether
Manifesting on the other side
Elementals are born in the darkness
Time for the Red Cap to spill blood again
