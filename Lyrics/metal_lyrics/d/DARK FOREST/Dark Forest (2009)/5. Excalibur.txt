The sword of power, wielded by Kings
In ages gone by
The lady of the lake, to Merlin she gave
The mighty Excalibur
Handed to Uther, whose lust brought a child
The future King Arthur
Taken by Merlin and raised far from home
The legend was born

The sword was drawn out from the stone
Thrust in by Uther
Arthur the King! In Camelot reigned
The years past in splendour
Guinevere betrayed and Lancelot fled
Arthur lay with Morganna
The incestuous child Mordred was born
To usurp the kingdom

Excalibur - drawn from the stone
Excalibur - holder of all the magic
The dragon's mist rose from beyond
To Avalon, sail forevermore!

Excalibur - drawn from the stone
Excalibur - holder of all the magic
The dragon's mist rose from beyond
To Avalon, sail forevermore!
