A forest glade beyond the veil
A gnome begins to tell his tale
Elfin music fills the air

Guided through the astral planes
So familiar, yet so strange
Like a dream we never had

Enchanted waters hidden from sight
A pool beneath the clear moonlight
Across the water, Undines dance

Nights of wonder, nights so still
Faerie lights and hollow hills
Regain the magic we once knew

Another world is shining through
Another world that we once knew
Hear the forest echo, hear the pipes of Pan
And the veil surrounding now becomes undone!
