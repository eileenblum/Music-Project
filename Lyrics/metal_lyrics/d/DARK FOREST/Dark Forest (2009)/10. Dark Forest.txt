A ghostly mist drifts through the trees
Lingering in the violet gleam
Silent marching, one by one
Dwellers from the forest come

To seek the throne, once left to fall
Saved from ruin, saved for all
To see the power and the might
A glorious reign is now in sight

Hear the woodland pipers call
Ringing through the trees, so tall
Rejoice and sing, a glorious time has come

Heirs to the throne of metal
Steel is shining, Dark Forest rising
Heirs to the throne of metal

Vapors rising from the soil
As they pass, those who are loyal
Shrouded in a mystic light
Specters moving through the night

Death to those who seek the end
Of the steel which we defend
True to ourselves and to our own
Rulers on the metal throne

Hear the woodland pipers call
Ringing through the trees, so tall
Rejoice and sing, a glorious time has come

Heirs to the throne of metal
Steel is shining, Dark Forest rising
Heirs to the throne of metal
