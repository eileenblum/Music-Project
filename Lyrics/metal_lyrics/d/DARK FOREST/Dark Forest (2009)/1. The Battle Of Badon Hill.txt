Ride out! Our men need help, ride out to Badon Hill
Unsheathe your British steel and kill!
The day has come at last, the men from foreign shores
Shall suffer at our hands we swore!

Behind this shield my pride is burning up my heart
Our rage and battle cries ring out
The strength of men who stand defending their own land
Shall triumph, victory is at hand!

Heal our land
Our blood stained land

We'll be one with the land we belong
We'll stand strong to defend what we love
Ride them down, crush them all
Victory shall be ours this day!

We'll not yield, never! And we'll strike them to the ground
We'll fight until we cannot stand
And if we die this day, together we shall fall
Our souls will live forevermore!

Heal our land
Our blood stained land

We'll be one with the land we belong
We'll stand strong to defend what we love
Ride them down, crush them all
Victory shall be ours this day!
