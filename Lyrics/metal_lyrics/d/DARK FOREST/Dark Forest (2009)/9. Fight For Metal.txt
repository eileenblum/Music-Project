Marching through the mist, stronger than death
Warriors unite, the guardians of steel
Battle is nigh, blood will be spilt
Metal prevails, crushes the weak

Drinking the ale which fuels us to fight
Posers defeated flee into the night
Storming the gates, banners will fly
Death holds no fear, for metal we'll die!

Leather and spikes shine in the night
Metal will prevail
The glory of steel, burning with pride
Forever standing strong

Rise! Unite! For metal we fight!

Leather and spikes shine in the night
Metal will prevail
The glory of steel, burning with pride
Forever standing strong

Rise! Unite! For metal we fight!
