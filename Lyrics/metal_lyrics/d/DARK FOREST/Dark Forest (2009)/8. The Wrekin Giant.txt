Down from the ancient black Welsh mountains
He came with murderous intent in his heart,
Beheld a grudge to the town of Shrewsbury
To kill the folk and flood all their lands

So wicked he would dam the Severn
So monstrous: with terror beholdâ¦

The Wrekin Giant! He set out to flood our lands
And destroy all our citizens
Oh the terror he doth bring into our lives
Torments us all!

The Wrekin Giant! He set out to flood our lands
And destroy all our citizens
Oh the terror he doth bring into our lives
Torments us all!

The Wrekin Giant! He set out to flood our lands
And destroy all our citizens
Oh the terror he doth bring into our lives
Torments us all!

Then, through the mist the giant came looming
A cobbler approached with trickery at hand
Casting aside the soil he'd gathered
With a thunderous roar he strode into the night...

The Wrekin Giant! He set out to flood our lands
And destroy all our citizens
Oh the terror he doth bring into our lives
Torments us all!
