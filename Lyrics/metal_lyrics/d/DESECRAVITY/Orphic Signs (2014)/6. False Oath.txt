In a quiet secret land
Filled with darkness
One little bright spot from heaven

Throws a bluish light
And illuminates the throne

No one inhabits the land
Hear only cry of the souls
Unshakable the oath to the king in the past
The testament is the legacy of the past

Thou has signed a new contract
And endowed force anew
The king is thrown into the abyss by thy hand
Thou becometh the king of the new world

It's not always truth becomes the reality
Only falsehood clings to people
I will kill the gods
Who forsaken this corrupt world
And will be the presence surpassing god
