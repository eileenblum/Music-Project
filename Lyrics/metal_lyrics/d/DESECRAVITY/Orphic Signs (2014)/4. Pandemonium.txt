The world is made of hell and evil
God created man
Beautified with blood and lie his presence
Man created devil
Played a tragedy
And protected themselves through betrayal
Devil roamed in times
Become a transcendent existence

Abandon all hope and enter the gate
There a forlorn existence
Divine power is meaningless
Bizarre growl the rumbling of the earth
The 7th layer of hell
You bastards deserve the destination
The grief and sorrow in the frozen river
Enjoy your misery forever

Greed, envy, arrogance
Temptation and awakening by the devil
This is the path you chose
I will lead you to the bottom of the deep
Taste the hellish sin
