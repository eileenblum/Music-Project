Nothing has changed in all ages
Continuing mortal coils
Was touching your death a tragedy or a loud?
Gravitated marble shadow of your death descends me
The time was set upon and torn to pieces
Never ever again...

Deviltry of gods
Personification of my hatred is born from the brimstone
What have you destroyed and created?
The late figurehead
Wander the earth with the sins and griefs until the end of time

Cycle of stories
What wisdom has brought about
Falling the blasted laughter from heaven
The time is coming
In the dark place where no one could reach
Scream loud and long
Forever desire your unattainable death
