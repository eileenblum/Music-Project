Sign of the curse
Is finally upon thee
Thou shalt feel the weight of thine sin
Deserved punishment
Get thine comeuppance

Sign of sin
This is thy show of rapture
Thou feel this pain, this pain is pain of thee
Bring back to memory
The death of thee

Clergies trod the path of self-destruction
Through alluded religious admiration
Wear the symbol of fake
Unscrupulous human scums shall see the fruit of
Delusion and falsehood
Self loathing and denial
The story shall soon end
