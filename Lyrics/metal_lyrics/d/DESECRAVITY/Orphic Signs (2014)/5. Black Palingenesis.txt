The world ruled over death
Blood rain continues to fall
Seeds have been sown
The black wings are given to the successor of the will of the deceased
When the mind is disembodied from the flesh
New death and hatred will be given

The karma conduce you
The half bleed of god and the devil
Born in the three evil worlds of hell
This pagan heretic become a tyrant and threat to the world
Worship me!

Sensory pleasure is the signpost to eudemonia
Sinful lust is always in thee
Thou shalt not be afraid to know oneself
And perish!
