Hateful god's senseless words
All starts from there
The abhorrent scenario has began
Blood flows and flesh shall rot
Stench of death reeks the air
Nowhere you get away

What does your heart desire
Repeat the same mistake again
No one set foot in this incarnadined land
There only remain nihility and unmercifulness

The sign of the beginning is coming close
A long-cherished desire of everyone
Ring down the final curtain on the world
Hanging the first man in the altar
That is the key to all

Everything is in order
We desire warm blood for rebirth
Bring deicide along
The end will be the beginning
Start the ritual
