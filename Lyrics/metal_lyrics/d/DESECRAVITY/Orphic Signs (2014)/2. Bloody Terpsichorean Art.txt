The splendid motion to produce
The only one art
Lit up by the moon
Alter ego stands next to you
The shadow brings forth shades
See your existence and value
As one of the chosen one

You can not hide the lie
No matter how you dress up
I smell blood on you
Sins begot enemies
And stain themselves in red

Throw off your mask
There is neither morality nor ethic here
This is just a game, no need
To stop killing each other
Along with the blood flowed out
The flesh will become a beautiful figure
The new realm of art is born

Shed blood, insufficient number of death
Sacrifice is inevitable
Squeeze blood of gods and goddesses
The bloodthirsty demons from
The realm shrouded in darkness are coming
The realm of you is marching toward the end
And stand at the beginning of new stage
