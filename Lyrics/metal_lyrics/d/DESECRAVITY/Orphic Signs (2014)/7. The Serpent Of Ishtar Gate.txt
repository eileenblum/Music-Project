When heaven and earth do not yet exist
Black vortex of theomachy erupts
One of the eleven beasts born from the goddess to kill gods
Trembles the air with the roar of anger
And spread awe to all living creatures
He deceived even the mother goddess and killed

The creation of the world by the death of the goddess
Spiral of chaos by men and gods lies scattered
The serpent rage for eternity
Heat of anger becomes a storm of inferno
Burned heaven and earth

The presence feared by the gods
Roar of anger tear apart the earth
Destroys all that interferes with its sleep
Never silence shall come
No more beautiful landscape, only debris remains
None remained to confront the angry serpent
