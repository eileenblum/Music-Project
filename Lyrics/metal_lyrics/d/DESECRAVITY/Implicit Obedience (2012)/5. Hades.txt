You return from Hades to die yet again
The price you pay for asking to the greedy God
The gates close and you shall never escape
Here all is rewarded by Death

I am the ruler of the army of the dead
We perish at dawn
Infuse new blood into the dead
The seed of Satan, forsaking my father

When does the messiah arrive ?
Realize the Apocalypse and sing the rubbish of will
I am ready to relatiate
I am the lord of Hades
I atone the entire world

The evil omen from the abyss of grief
You feared the raids of the sun god
And ran away to the underground
And fulfilled the prophecy of truth

Shatter the delusion of glory and vow to your master
I shall devour all with the servant locust by the 3rd sign
Sinful hellenism, worship the whore Jehovah
Desire desecrimination and persecution
Trapped souls of the abyss are set free
Let fall the shadow of Hell on Earth

When does the messiah arrive ?
Realize the Apocalypse and sing the rubbish of will
I am ready to relatiate
I am the lord of Hades
I atone the entire world
