Dying on the cross the holy body falls to the devil
Spew your lies and fall to Hell again
You created no miracles in your life
Innocence could not save you

Accept the fact
Dead needs no respect paid

Rebirth of all
Fucked by savior the Earth turns to paradise
Suffering turns the divine to ashes
The calling of Hell

Grudging vengeful justice
Extincted by hatred

Weak ones beg for their lives bearing the cross
Believing the empty talks of preacher they forgive their sins
Who would care about you ?
Praise God you lost all
Liars of false clerical pride
Die !!

Rebirth of all
Fucked by savior the Earth turns to paradise
Grudging vengeful justice

Inferior tradition
Extincted by hatred
Meaningless crucifixion
Extincted with hatred
