The heinous trick twists all values
You are the loathed one
Yet the hands are in prayer atone their brutality
Know they pay no heed

I stand against you
The antagonist
I erode all that you are
Enjoy the greatest humiliation
You destroy all you believe
Destroy all the you created
The creation of destruction
I will do the help

Time passed in vain protecting the ancient words
The three secrets of Fatima failed every one
Miserable congregation
Reap the basest ignominy

Lasting humiliation
You betrayed those brainwashed to believe you
You destroyed your creation
Against your intention you are violated by me the enemy
I will give you eternal suffering

Retch everything you've believed
The lore of hierarch disappear and crumble with in
Look, with the blood ofloved ones our hands are stained
