It is time for decision
Look the ugly face you know so well
Hatred hammered down could not be stopped
The evil spirits of Golgotha speak their ill ideals

Devour the empyrean in conflagration
Fall ash and blood upon the Earth
Death must never cease

The immortals wage the eternal war
The immortals wage the eternal war

The dead from the abyss
Bring havoc and armageddon upon Meggido
Blood of saints purify the battlefield

Devour the empyrean in conflagration
Fall ash and blood upon the Earth
Death must never cease

The dead from the abyss
Bring havoc and armageddon upon Meggido
Blood of saints purify the battlefield

The immortals wage the eternal war

Depth of your faith legion of belial asks
Mockery of holy faith you pray
And pitiful death your messiah chooses
In sickness the world seeks compromise
