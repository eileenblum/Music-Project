Purge
The false bravado
Allegiance
God does not demand
Resurrected
The unbidden God in human world
Inheritance
Spew the seeds of beast

Cull the weak and keep your world of nothing
Ruth the Hell on the 7th day

The junk ecclesia reeks of rotten dead
Waiting so long for a miracle

Was that your redemption ?

All will be accused and blamed
Those meaningless swines swayed your fate
Do you believe their faith is pure ?
Do you think they will bear the cross as you did ?

Children in Calvary drive you in to ruin
Your unbearable words created chaos in us
With your death the nous brakes delusion
Sins of your existence, know that we don't need you
Sentenced to death
Suffer the afterlife in Inferno
