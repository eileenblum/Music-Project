Pour the control blood on to the parchment
The night of Sabbath opens the gates of Hell
Drink the blue blood
Receive the serpent
Bear malice the justice that defied and spat on you
The retribution against the ancient Nazarene

Cacodemonia
Decimation is the impulse to fill
Pleasure is the psalm of Hell
Kill the underdog of faith in God

Sadistic pleasure
You pray to God in the hour of Death
Lost in pleasure and lust for flesh and blood

Suicide, brimstone, agony, exile, nothingness
All believed things fell
The light shall never shine upon you
Kill the children of God
The devil yearns for the sacrifice
Stain with blood the days you cowered
In fear of hatemonger

Cacodemonia
Decimation is the impulse to fill
Pleasure is the psalm of Hell
Kill the underdog of faith in God

Cacodemonia
Decimation is the impulse to fill
Pleasure is the psalm of Hell
Kill the underdog of faith in God
