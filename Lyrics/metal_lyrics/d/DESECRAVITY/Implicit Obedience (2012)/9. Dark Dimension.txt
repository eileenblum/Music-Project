Portal of Hell
The world you never knew
Birth the seed of darkness
Evil grows in your mind

You ignoramus on Earth
You believe the parasitical faith brings
Your soul equal to God ?
Farce of your messiah spreads weakness
Heavens turn blind eyes

Lucifer, our father in Hell
Come back from Hell and walk the heavens
Eliminate all light, shroud the world in darkness

Union the vain struggle of your Bible
Discard the Bible lest yourself be lost
Abandon all and kneel to your lord Satan
Apostles of God are granted eternity in their slavery

Lucifer, our father in Hell
Come back from Hell and walk the heavens
Eliminate all light, shroud the world in darkness

Our father in Hell
Grant us the slaughter...
