The blind religion has fallen
Possessed by the devil your love turns to slaughter
Death they will face
And you can't even become a hypocrite

Be whipped and reduced to ashes by the cross
Stake to the cross and suffer defeat
Watch the end of the impotent men below you
For the truth of Judas is now lost
There is no forgiveness, now only fury resides in me
Deity of Anus
Condemn them to Hell once more
Kill the lands seduced by the false Bible
How deep you fall into the abyss
To forgive their false justice

Servent of Cocytus tests you
All prophecy is a mockery
The slaves of the cross join their hands in prayer
The foolish crowd awaits the return
Suffer in eternity the vanquished fools
