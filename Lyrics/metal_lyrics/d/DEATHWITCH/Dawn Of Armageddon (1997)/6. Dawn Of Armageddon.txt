lords of war gather
in the black sky
it's time for the last war
against human light
ride the beast of evil
slaughter the weak humanity
chaotic storms, destruction and death
it's the dawn of armageddon

dawn of armageddon
dawn of armageddon

the water in the seas
turns red and cold
the nature is rotting
the cities burn to ashes
creatures of hell
raping all the humans
plague, war and damnation
it's the dawn of armageddon

dawn of armageddon
dawn of armageddon
