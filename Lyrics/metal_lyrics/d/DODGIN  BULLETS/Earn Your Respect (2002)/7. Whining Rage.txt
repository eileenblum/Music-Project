Turn my flag upside down,
burn it in your hands
how much of your family died
to give you the freedom that you have

your life is nothing but a fake you don't hold the true to the words that you preach your communist ideas have so clouded your childish mind that you never even bothered to realize that the only reason you have success is because of this place and all the freedom that you truly have.

you hate a contry that's given you everything you've got

your life is nothing but a fake you don't hold the true to the words that you preach your communist ideas have so clouded your childish mind that you never even bothered to realize that the only reason you have success is because of this place and all the freedom that you truly have.

when will you finally wake up
so easy to talk big on your pedestal of money and fame,
come down to the real level and then we'll see how tough you really are you fake.
