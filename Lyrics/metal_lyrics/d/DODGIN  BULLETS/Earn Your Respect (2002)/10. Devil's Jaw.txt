you had me where you wanted me
alone and by myself

so many years been beaten so badly
afraid to enter to enter your realm again

afraid of his wrath but through it all i got your message to stand up tall
to lean on you for power and strength
you'll see us through at any length

it's time to stand and face my fear
my power will grow
with each step i take

you send an army but i will take them down
i await the title fight,
me versus you

this is your last stand
your last stand

i know your pattern
i know your weakness

i know your pattern
i know your weakness

i see you commin'
from so far away

i see you commin'
from so far away

this time i won't miss
the devil's jaw
this is your last stand

this time i won't miss
the devil's jaw
this is your last stand

this time i won't miss
the devil's jaw
this is your last stand

this time i won't miss
the devil's jaw
this is your last stand

this time i won't miss
the devil's jaw
this is your last stand
