The furnace rises
The death toll rises
Nightmares coming to light

The invincible shield has been broken
The rib cage has been shattered

Over night crisis visits your children
Over night crisis visits your head

Broken back from the left side of hell
It's a spell I can't quite break

Broken back from the left side of hell
It's a spell I can't quite break

Tomorrow the world will change forever
Sleep well for tomorrow...
Sleep well for tomorrow could be hell
