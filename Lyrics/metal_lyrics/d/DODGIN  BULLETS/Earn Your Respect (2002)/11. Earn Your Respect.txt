why's it all abuot following the crowd these days? lets try to start following our own hearts!

in these times of smoke and haze
no one to look to, no one to blame
we're all moving targets
because we strive, we strive to be the same
how many times you sell yourself out
you give yourself up without a doubt
fall to the game, another lost stand for true self, a worthy cause

where's your respect
who cares about the past
show some respect
no more excuses

where's your respect
who cares about the past
show some respect
no more excuses

in these times of smoke and haze
no one to look to, no one to blame
we're all moving targets
because we strive, we strive to be the same

where's your respect
who cares about the past
show some respect
no more excuses

it's not too late to start again,
to prove yourself to win some self respect

your filth,
you're lies,
you're facedown
i bleed with you
where's your respect
show some respect
where's your respect

Earn your respect!

where's your respect
show some respect
where's your respect
earn your respect
