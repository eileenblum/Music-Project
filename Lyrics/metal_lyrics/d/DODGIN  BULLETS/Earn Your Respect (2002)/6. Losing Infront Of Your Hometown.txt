UH!

When I am at my lowest point,
when i'm down on my face in despair
I can see everything,
I can understand myself and see things the way they truly are no more smokey hallways to blame
no more trying to live up to a name a colorful world has nothing left to offer you
(nothing left for you)

you can see them for what they truly are
you'll finally see the wolves as wolves

you can see them for what they truly are
you'll finally see the wolves as wolves

When I am at my lowest point,
when i'm down on my face in despair
I can see everything,
I can understand myself and see things the way they truly are
no more smokey hallways to blame
no more trying to live up to a name a colorful world has nothing left to offer you
nothing left to offer you

to be broken is a beautiful thing
humiliation self realization

to be broken is a beautiful thing
humiliation self realization

you finally see the wolves as wolves
you'll see the wolves as wolves.

you finally see the wolves as wolves
you'll see the wolves as wolves.
