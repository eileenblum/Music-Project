OOOHHH!

you're a fool to think times will change
everyday in the line of fire
crosshairs alawys on my back
runnin' through the fields of flame

put me (in my place)
knocked down (on my face)

put me (in my place)
knocked down (on my face)

i fight everday,
fight against the flow
travel down the narrow path,
my strength will grow

multitudes against me,
rise up in hate
their days are numbered,
they don't control my fate

through my struggles,
i'm not alone

through my struggles,
i'm not alone

you're a fool to think times will change
everyday in the line of fire
crosshairs alawys on my back
runnin' through the fields of flame

you're a fool to think times will change
everyday in the line of fire
crosshairs alawys on my back
runnin' through the fields of flame

through my struggles, i'm not alone
