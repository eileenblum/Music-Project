time's up kids welcome to the end of the world i hope you're prepared for war 'cause it's time to put down your books and put up your fists

you search for your peach of mind in this world but what you find will rot away before your very eyes

everything you worked for, everything you saved, it all means nothing 'cause it's time to fight

it's time to pay the price and the pice is your head you picked the teams and now it's too late to turn back times up welcome to the end of the world

your path of fire and hate
has sent you to your grave
crushed by the hand that gave you life
you chose the knife
(your gunna get it)

everything you worked for
everything you saved
it all means nothing
with one foot in the grave

it's the end
it's your time to burn

i stared death down by chains you're bound fall to your knees it's the end of the world!
