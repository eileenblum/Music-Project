Black and blue ego!

When all I can think about is you at the stake
under fire and under trial
the noose being tightened around your already bruised throat,
by my hands,
I should have vengeance

justified and purified in the flames from my mouth

I was the target,
an innocent victim,
who didn't ask for the bulls-eyes upon my chest
what's done is done, but I want people to remember who won
not the facts but the score,
who fought harder and wanted it more

revenge, justice seeded in our souls
justified and purified in the flames from the burning coals

revenge, justice seeded in our souls
justified and purified in the flames from the burning coals

wrong and right,
strenght and might,
but does 2 wrongs make a right?

return fire,
my human desire,
sharing that hate,
I deserve the same fate

I realize this now,
it's not too late to keep myself from making the same mistake.
