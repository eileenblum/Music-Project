Stand in line droid,
to kill yourself to sut your throat,
to bleed yourself dry
disguised with the mask that could fool every man woman, child, and yourself,
and your parents too your brothers,
your sisters,
your partners in crime by T.V your programmed
to stand in line you see it,
believe it,
you swallow it whole brainless or brainwashed give away your soul

I look in your eyes,
I see nothing but hate I look in your eyes,
I see you all share the same fate

how many times will it take
to break your fever and faith in this dying world
how many times will you fake out,
just to stand in line to meet your miserable faith.

how many times will it take
to break your fever and faith in this dying world
how many times will you fake out,
just to stand in line to meet your miserable faith.

Stand in line
Stand in line
Stand in line to meet your fait

"You think this song is about you? Then your right. Better change your attitude. Look in the mirror, and see what your really made of."

how many times will it take
to break your fever and faith in this dying world
how many times will you fake out,
just to stand in line to meet your miserable faith.

how many times will it take
to break your fever and faith in this dying world
how many times will you fake out,
just to stand in line to meet your miserable faith.
