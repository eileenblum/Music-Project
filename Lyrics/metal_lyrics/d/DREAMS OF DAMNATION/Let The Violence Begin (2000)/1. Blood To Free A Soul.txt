[Music: Durkin/ Lyrics: Durkin/Silva]

Run my child, your soul is freed tonight, hurt no more your soul is free
Blood's been spilled to give your spirit flight, to a realm eyes cannot see

Souls scream out in rage, they're trapped on the other side
Their anguish and pain, is why they avoid the light
Blood to free a soul, you'll dwell here no more
Blood to free a soul, you've traveled through the door

Tell me of things in the great beyond, afterlife, where do we go?
Can you hear me when I pray at night? These are thing I need to know

Souls scream out in rage, they're trapped on the other side
Their anguish and pain, is why they avoid the light
Blood to free a soul, you'll dwell here no more
Blood to free a soul, you've traveled through the door

Can you hear me? I call to you
As sure as the air, I know you are there
Only a breath of life separates us now

Much too soon will I be joining you, on this earth for now I stay
Left behind to mourn and grieve for you, you're with us now, yet far away

Souls scream out in rage, they're trapped on the other side
Their anguish and pain, is why they avoid the light
Blood to free a soul, you'll dwell here no more
Blood to free a soul
