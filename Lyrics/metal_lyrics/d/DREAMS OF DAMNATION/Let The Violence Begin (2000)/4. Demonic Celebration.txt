[Music: Durkin/ Lyrics: Jacobs]

Out of the darkness of the past, nations of hatred come amassed
Birthrites die upon the flame, recruits in a deadly game
Words of fear bring deadly embrace, make your choice don't be disgraced
Open your eyes and see the light...
Into the darkness of the night, millions of people seeking the light
Execution of the mind, seek the night and you will find
Words of hate bring jealous distaste, face your life it is a waste
Close your eyes to the pain...
Destructive force of man falls, insanity tearing down the walls
Can you feel the fire burning ever higher, bodies in the street, see mankind face defeat
Children run away, to play another day
Sacrificial pit, world has turned to shit
Crushing wall of dead, the image in your head
A bloody ritual, you are a fucking fool
You realize too late, its time to see your fate
No one will hear your cries, or your pathetic lies

Don't want your pity, lay me in the dirt
I leave this world not caring who I hurt
Don't want your pity, lay me in my grave
My life is over...

No matter where you turn, your gonna fucking burn
And when your life dies out, you will not even shout
Your faith is in the night, beware the sacred rite
Or you will lose control, your sacrilegious soul
Bullets raining down, and evil warlike sound
Nightmare comes alive, there is no where to hide
Riots in the street, the faceless dead will meet
Dreams of Damnation, demonic celebration

Don't want your pity, lay me in the dirt
I leave this world not caring who I hurt
I don't want your pity, lay me in my grave
My life is over...there's nothing left to save

Out of the darkness of the past, nations of hatred come amassed
Birthrites die upon the flame, recruits in a deadly game
Words of hate bring deadly embrace, make your choice don't be disgraced
Open your eyes to the pain...pain...pain...pain...
