[Music/Lyrics: Durkin]

The stars are aligned tonight, a story must be told
Chosen from the zodiac, a bloody message will unfold
Killer of the innocent, I'll spare none from my wrath
Pray for your deliverance, as I cut my bloody path

I am the hammer of sickness, brought down upon the weak
Bludgeoning the innocent, as I raise the sword of inhumanity
I am the hammer of sickness, crushing skulls of the meek
Killer of the innocent, I raise the sword of inhumanity

Cruelty after cruelty, my heart is dead and cold
There are no exceptions, my hatred touches the young and the old
A storm of ancient hatred, unleashed upon the world
A soul so cold and barren, Evil-lution
I touch and take each life, without a second though
And I will keep on killing, until I've been caught

I chose my kill at random, they share no common ground
I stay withdrawn inside my head, as the killing wheel goes around
Repent is not an option, I ask for no reprieve
One by one my victims fall, by my ability to deceive

I am the hammer of sickness, brought down upon the weak
Bludgeoning the innocent, as I raise the sword of inhumanity
I am the hammer of sickness, crushing skulls of the meek
Killer of the innocent, I raise the sword of inhumanity

The stars are aligned tonight, a story must be told
Chosen from the zodiac, a bloody message will unfold
Killer of the innocent, I'll spare none from my wrath
Pray for your deliverance, as I cut my bloody path

I am the hammer of sickness, brought down upon the weak
Bludgeoning the innocent, as I raise the sword of inhumanity
I am the hammer of sickness, crushing skulls of the meek
Killer of the innocent, I raise the sword of inhumanity
