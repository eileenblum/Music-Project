[Music: Durkin/ Lyrics: Jacobs, Durkin]

Down away dead fall behind, spirits calling in my head lasting visions of the dead
Feeding darkness from my mind, paralyzing fear of fate will not face the final day
Judgment reigning from the past, endless life I cannot bear shadows follow everywhere
Happiness will never last, you might live to see the light, not me my friend
I die tonight

Release me from the torment in my mind, let me leave this world behind
Kill me take my life and end it quick, All this bullshit makes me sick, 
Bury me, hide my body down so deep, with the secrets that I keep
Forget me I am gone for good this time

Shadows hold a ring of fire, damaged thoughts and bloody dreams
Nightmare is not what it seems, shallow passion and desire
Crushed by innocence and blinded, other people never minded
Face the future it's revealed, wandered by the path and stumbled
Lost for decades lifetimes crumbled, new dawn blooms in sacred fields
You might live to see the light, not me my friend
I die tonight

Release me from the torment in my mind, let me leave this world behind
Kill me take my life and end it quick, All this bullshit makes me sick, 
Bury me, hide my body down so deep, with the secrets that I keep
Forget me I am gone for good this time

Down away dead fall behind, spirits calling in my head lasting visions of the dead
Feeding darkness from my mind, paralyzing fear of fate will not face the final day
Judgment reigning from the past, endless life I cannot bear shadows follow everywhere
Happiness will never last, you might live to see the light, not me my friend
I die tonight

Release me from the torment in my mind, let me leave this world behind
Kill me take my life and end it quick, All this bullshit makes me sick, 
Bury me, hide my body down so deep, with the secrets that I keep
Forget me I am gone for good this time
Now move on...
