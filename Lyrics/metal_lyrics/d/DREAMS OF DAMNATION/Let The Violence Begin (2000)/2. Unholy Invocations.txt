[Music: Durkin/Lyrics: Silva/Durkin]

Unholy Invocations!!

Empty your mind and let us come inside
A whole new world will appear
Give us your money, We'll take away your tears
Games of distraction, voice of fear

Unholy Invocations!!
Our cause you will defend
Unholy Invocations!!

Implant our will inside your feeble mind
Our false religion will prevail
No cross or book can guide you to the light
If there's no wrong, there's no hell

Unholy Invocations!!
Our cause you will defend
Unholy Invocations!!
Defend it until the end

Give us your money
We'll take away your tears
Games of distraction
Voice of fear

Unholy Invocations!!
Our cause you will defend
Unholy Invocations!!
...Defend it to the end

Lonely children of the night
Homeless heroes seek the light
Seek our spirits, fight the fight
All fall before our gathered might

Drill, into your mind
Drill, into your mind
Drill, into your mind, drill
Drill into your mind
Drill until you get it right
Drill, into your mind, drill

Self-hypnotized but won't admit it
Their disguise is underrated
Threats implanted deep inside
By soldiers with the evil eye

Drill, into your mind
Drill, into your mind
Drill, into your mind, drill
Drill into your mind
Drill until you get it right
Drill, into your mind, drill

Enter our realm, deception of the truth
Convince you that this is why you were born
Distort your sense of what is right or wrong
Drill your mind until you conform

Unholy Invocations!!
Uproot your deepest fears
Unholy Invocations!!
