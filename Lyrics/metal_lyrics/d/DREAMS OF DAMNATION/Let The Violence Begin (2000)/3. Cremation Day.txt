[Music: Durkin/ Lyrics: Jacobs]

Feeling the fire the funeral pyre
With visions of death in your mind
Destructive power, the flames make you cower
The smoke burns, your life falls behind
Step in the shadows beneath the gallows
Inviting you into cold sleep
Final words spoken and bodies are broken
Just throwing the rest on the heap
Stand and bear witness to all of the victims
Flung into the pit with a grin
Something is waiting to see death congregating
Strike up the fire once again
Past is confronted, the holy are hunted
Compassions forgotten today
In the town square the stench of burned hair
The memory just wont go away
Pack your belongings, the heat is alarming
Time to leave this evil place
Hot on your trail to bag you have failed
Dominions of night giving chase
Sun will not rise with all of the lies
Darkness descends in the end
No one is learning, bodies are burning
Putting the knife to your friend

On cremation day, cremation
On cremation day, cremation
On cremation day, cremation
On cremation day!!

Daylight receding in flames nightmares breeding
Reflections and boiling pools of blood
Step over ruins that might have been human
Broken bones lying in the mud
Life takes a vacation from this desecration
And demons fall out of the sky
Death's burning fire makes all of us liars
And most of us never know why
Sun will not rise with all of the lies
Darkness descends in the end
No one is learning, bodies are burning
Putting the knife to your friend

On cremation day, cremation
On cremation day, cremation
On cremation day, cremation
On cremation day!!

On cremation day [x3]
