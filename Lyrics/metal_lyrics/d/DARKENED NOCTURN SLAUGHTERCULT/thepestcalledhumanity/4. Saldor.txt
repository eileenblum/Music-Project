Listen to the white winds of death! The cries broke the silence of the cimonar.Gliding between the centuries of timeAnd I riped their wings of life.Their decay period started,and I know they are destructible!The void in the center of their hopeDespair I am. I could never set an end to the war of attrition,until I wiped out all these minor creatures.I will never rest until they sunkInto the dark mud of our tulwod.I will never rest until they heardMy unearthly sounds of hate. So unhappy in their deaths,which have been so sudden.So unhappy in their deaths,Sudden, Violent and misterious! DIE!!!
