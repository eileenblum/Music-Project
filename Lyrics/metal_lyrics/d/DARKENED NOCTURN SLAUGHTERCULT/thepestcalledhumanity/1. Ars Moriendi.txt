Some unwelcoming spell depresses the place.A look into the mirror,I see the devil incarnate.Some misanthrophist in my direction In my deserted interior is a worldOf misty windswept moorlands. Full of thoughts, rising against the darkI am the only one, who non omnis moritarI am the evil one, who non omnis moritarNon omnis moritar, Death has many faces.Non omnis moritar I am each face of it. Only this great dark throne is mine!
