The cosmos is a vivacious vessel,
whose profundity equals the depth of nocturnal blackness.
Macrocosm is the measurement for limitedless.
The fundaments of seminal knowledge are nourished
willingly by the cosmical entity.

The cosmos lies within thee

No reflection appears upon the mirror unless one side's eclipsed
Nothing is apparent without antinomy.
The cognition of life grows perpetually
out of dichotomies polarity.

Microcosm is the inner sense and replies
to this greater outer with a sonority.
An emotion combines the tone to chimes.
Their reverb lasts deathlessly
despite shed off shells.

The cosmos is within thee
