Primeval husk - Stellar remnant, source of no polarity,
drawing down the most hidden of all hidden, intangible,
towards the genderless foundation of impurity,
an ensorcelled orbit of a transient starless will.

Opthalmic bedevilment, the augury pours into the chalice,
albeit amongst the sightless there is no seer,
no augur to divine this dire portent, demiurgeous,
henceforth the specters of matter will drearily disappear.

Foundation of impurity - Opthalmic bedevilment,
the augury pours into the chalice - primordial sapphirine driplets.

For though the primordial sapphirine driplets
bedew desiccated tongues, none will grasp their savor,
to no extend in its boundless incomprehensible fulness,
forsooth the forsaken ones are mandkinds failure.
