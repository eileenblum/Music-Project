Bound by an insatiable craving,
a fateful carnivorous greed,
even in death still raving,
a bloodied life's work to exceed.

The Eviscerator â The Eviscerator

From Sitra Achra, side of Kelipah returning,
the God beloved, left-behind to maltreat.

The Eviscerator â The Eviscerator

Cita mors ruit.
Media vita in morte sumus.
Mors janua vitae.
Mors certa, sed hora incerta.

Faith - an excruciating visitation,
hell's begotten saviour, sin-born,
to herald premature redemption,
to those of contempt and scorn.

Archeronian epitome of deliverance,
skinning the husks, refined chaos,
prepossessed by agonizing abhorrence,
a raging passion utter pious.

The Eviscerator - insatiable craving
The Eviscerator - carnivorous greed

Omnes vulnerant, ultima necat.
Redibo, tu nunquam.
