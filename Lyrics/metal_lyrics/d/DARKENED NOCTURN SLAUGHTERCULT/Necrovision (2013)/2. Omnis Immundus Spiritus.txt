Omnis immundus spiritus,
Omnis satanica potestas,
Omnis incursio infernalis adversarii,
Omnis legio diabolica,
adjuramus te.

Invoked is the sacred and terrible name - a nocturnal presence so odorously unclean.
Betwixt this spiritual negativity lies in pain - a sacrificial extispex utter sanguine.
Nothing may ward off the dormant torment
these mural boundaries have seen.

Flaming scourge of God, bornless one,
bestow upon us thy forbidden gnostic sermon.

Ergo draco maledicte - te rogamus, audi nos.

Begetter of Chaos, King of all kingships - thy words of commandment are upon our lips.
Unmatched is thy glory and grace - so fierce thy lustful embrace.

He, whose culminating gnosis exceeds the horned serpent,
whose guise is girt with light most lucent, whose numious will the welkin distends,
whose shaping the invisible boundary transcends, he, whose limitless enrails permeate throughout time
- this sanctuary is now thine. Ergo draco maledicte - te rogamus, audi nos.
Omnis immundus spiritus, Omnis satanica potestas,
Omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, Omnis legio diabolica,
adjuramus te.
