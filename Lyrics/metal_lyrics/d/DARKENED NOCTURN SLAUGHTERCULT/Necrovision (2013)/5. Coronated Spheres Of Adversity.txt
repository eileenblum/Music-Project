Transcend prime mover, starry and awed,
in radiant grace onto the palace empty of god.

Tenfold entwined sparks of holiness,
oh, crowned emanation of unity caress,
the duality of life and death.

Transcend prime mover, starry and awed,
in radiant grace onto the palace empty of god.

Impurity - adhere concealed wisdom,
emanate, contemplate, succumb,
to the filthy wailing one.

Limitless, invisble thou were highborn,
now amorphously altering to misshapen scorn.

Coronated are the spheres of adversity,
vaporously deified by miasmic blight,
in the spiritual cadence of delight.
