Ainsoph the principle of all and nothing,from the possession of no property flows the Berzenelon into the universe.Impenetrable in blackness,striking its roots with infinite multitudeeach solitary standing for its own revelation. Pencilled vigour strong and of devestating power!Astral darkness is the foundation of unconsciousness: The I!   The I!!   The I!!! Through knowledge of thunder spearheads, obtained are guidance and iron reign.For within the deed sheer violence lies......will be death as the repercussion ofomnipotence and excalted graciousness! The victims blood will as fragrantly smoke ascend to almighty heights.Enshrouded by secrets, the utmost deep thought of greatness and power,darkens thick fog in bottomless death.
