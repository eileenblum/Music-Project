This is the beginning of all end,This is the returning of all fears,This is the existing pain,The desire of my wide Emirdiale!Its where the paths lead to my Zadule,Where nobody exists! This is the time of Glory,This is the deserted Emird,The Meeting in this great nowhere,But its known where we are,where nobody ever will reach! Its where paths will never end,Its where the misantrophic Soltiark thrives,Its where the fate is sealed with Tulwod And its existing gives evidence of our glorious presence!I can breathe the Spirit of Our Home!!!
