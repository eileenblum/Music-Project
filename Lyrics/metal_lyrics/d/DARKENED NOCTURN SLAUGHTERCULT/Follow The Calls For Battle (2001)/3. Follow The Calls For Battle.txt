A vast colossos is storming over the land,the gigant judgement of sudden death,it is creeping up, transforming the human dwelling into a combustion chamber.His venomous breath gives glimbse to all hillsides of the darkest abyss. Lacerate the highest of all beings,Towards the final awakening, Follow the Calls for Battle!!! In heaps of rubble shall be,the glorious mankind achieved.By filthy beings made through filthy humans shall be destroyed. Follow the Calls for Battle!!! In deathly silence of mortal agony,we hear the redemption drawing near:With deafening storms in the air!With pounding trembles in the earth!With waves in the sea... Sow the seed of peace, let the redemption preach its words,massive harvest of humanity.Greet the new Messiah, with your tulwod, with your zadule, with your death. Followed the Calls for Battle!!!
