On a trail between the ruins shadows disappear into the night. A gathering around the fire lets them celebrate Cimonar de nuit. Reloaded powers of chaos in darkest glory lets themchant until their sound reaches the end of nothingness. Winds carry their spiritual vibrancy.Bow down - cloth the world in perpetual effulgence of cimonar. Hail silence - Hail reign of nightHail Chaos - Hail BlasphemyAve occult spirit - nocturnal divinity Extol the crown of silver filigree filaments, spun by ritualistic deeds.Sojourn within this nightly benison, dismantle the resurrection of dawns demiurg. In darkest glory discharge the entangled thoughts into nothingness. The last verse resounds shy to apocalyptic storm.Shadows disappear into the night as rain covers up the tracks of their paths
