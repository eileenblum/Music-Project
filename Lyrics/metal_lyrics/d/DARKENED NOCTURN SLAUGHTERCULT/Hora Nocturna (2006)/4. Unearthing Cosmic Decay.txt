Break the blazing hands of time,
thus letting all life dwell within its despicable misery.

Unearth the course of cosmic decay!

Lead the ancient vile malice into mankinds congested veins.

Unearth the course of cosmic decay!

When beast and bird in splendour rejoice,
the equilibrium of life and death is reached...

Scared scale judicious slave - enfettered once within Chrono's halls,
The grand cleansing now unleash!

Cometh forth through pallor of broken mist - conquering.
Be the force which outweights this despicable misery.

The grand cleansing now unleash! Unearthing Cosmic Decay
