Diluvial cleansing glinting morning dew upon languishing vitality of atrophying spirits.
Astonishing pulchritude reflects in a dead mans golden stare, whilst sham mirrors become obsolete.
Henceforth their sorrow came with pure malevolence.

Chaos embraced avatar, thou art the tenth,
unfold multifariously thy foretold presence.

"Kalpa" - "Mayon" - "Tirumal" primordial one
thy blackened bleak age has come!
"Kalpa" - "Mayon" - "Tirumal" primordial one

Bretherens in death, by life entwined, one thousand they are, the incidence of divine wrath.
They chastise, they punish, they travel far and wide to retrieve the equilibrium of a new dawn.

"Moha" - " Mara" - "Kalki"
"Kalpa" - "Mayon" - "Tirumal"
primordial one
