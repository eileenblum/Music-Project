In the distance, in the night, shadows engage the light.
Winds waft their spirits vibrancy.
Lay down and cloth the world into eternal glory of darkness.

Saldorian Spell

Saldorian Spell - Long live the silence,
lasting reign of night - Saldorian Spell

Whilst the wilderness narrowly encloses all silently, distrustfully, infinitely.
Poising in stillness ... with times pulsating flow, indefinitely afar, yet so close, the circle of gathering is here.
The circle of gathering is here.

Whilst sprouting roots entangle the steles, inquisitive, convex, bursting.
The fundament uniting... with inflamed stars, so strident, yet so clandestine, within the eternal womb of obscurity.
