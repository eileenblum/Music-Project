Upon them mighty spires of chaos,amidst the vortex of time,behold the blackest orb of uncreation,for the great harvest is acoming,none shall be able to endure ! Procreation of ages unborn,foreseen from times untold,scattered mortal incinerated remains,sand in the wheels of a precious lifecycle. .... and spokes dissipate into oblivion ! ... Reap ... despair,Reap ... deterioration,Reap ... death. Last entry into the chronicles of chaos,scribbled with immense decay,followed by eternal, glorified peace !Glorified unit of human life,light up in the fiery great void's shine !!! ...blazing red - spokes dissipate into oblivion !... "Human sibling, reap what you have sown!" Reap ... despair,Reap ... deterioration,Reap ... death.
