At the end of calamitous paths stood their beginning.The source of infinity began to pour out.As black winged squadrons covered the sky.As insanity's `wakening drowned out howling beasts.As frostic wind scraggy skims over darkened lands,like a shrill woeful sigh. This is the herald of the grand tempest.As forces of gravity began to pour out. Like a falling boulder the ground of their arrival shivers. Mit derben Ãxten gegen den Himmel erhoben,ertÃ¶nt der Gleichschritt. NOCTURNAL MARCH !NOCTURNAL MARCH ! There abysmal oceans raise their mighty flood,wrenching the weakness into infernal gullets. As black winged squadrons covered the sky.As insanity's `wakening drowned out howling beasts.As frostic wind scraggy skims over darkened lands,like a shrill woeful sigh. Hurricanes and Earthquakes are shattering bleak groundHordes of plague and pestilence the grand Pest commands- like an ursurpingly march, all devastating... thus dwindling - praying Humanity. Mit derben Ãxten gegen den Himmel erhoben,ertÃ¶nt der Gleichschritt. NOCTURNAL MARCH !We start the Nocturnal March !
