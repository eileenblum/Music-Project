Dimly shaded haze - thought entangling,whilst rivers of crimson red brawling - open the gates. Open the Gates ! Awake thee not, sleep ! Sleep on.Fill these dormant eyes within them clandestine flamesomit spraying these dolorous sparks. Sway in unison with Cimonar beforeBlackest despair usurps the spirit. Die Macht der Sinne belebt die Kraft ! As a pale moons' lunar plate, extricates its' bulk.Out of nightly cloud covers - pale silver shafts graze,The spectral runlets of Tulwod. ... eyes piercing an invisible objectin spatial distance,as gracefully grim paleness in full comeliness dives into streams of Tulwod.
