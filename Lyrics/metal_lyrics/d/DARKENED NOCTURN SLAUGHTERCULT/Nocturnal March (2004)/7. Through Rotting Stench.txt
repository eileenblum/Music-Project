They seize the spectre of Cimonar,and set up against the vastness of unforeseeable.Nothing else remains except to let self-destruction runIt's unstoppable course. Riding through rotting stench in blood swampRiding through rotting stench in blood swampRiding through rotting stench in blood swamp Lurid bolts tearing above the great vast battlefields,dragging through space like a fervently inferno.Suffusing their Tersareth with Fear, coldness, mercilessness,Tulwod ! calamities blistering above the great vast battlefield,implacable, immovable.They will revert to the very source of existence,to the source where they'll be governed by the great void . Riding through rotting stench in bloody swamp !
