I cut the  ground out from under him every time
He's overstayed his welcome
It's a long walk home when you've hit rock bottom
It's a long walk home, and you never belonged

Give me a reason to speak my mind
Give me a reason - payback's a bitch every time

Blame me, you always blame me for everything
Blame me, you always blame me for everything!
My heart is pure, my heart is true
You're a thankless piece of shit, I blame you!

Look inside yourself, fucker! What do you see?
He's overstayed his welcome...
It's a long walk home when you've hit rock bottom
It's a long walk home and you never belonged!

Give me a reason to speak my mind
Give me a reason - payback's a bitch every time!

Blame me, you always blame me for everything
Blame me, you always blame me for everything!
My heart is pure, my heart is true
You're a thankless piece of shit, I blame you!

Transgressions not forgotten, cutting off the pulse
Binding  fast, bound forever, defined by triumph or tragedy

I blame you!
I put the blame on, I put the blame on you!
I put the blame on, I put the blame on you!
I blame you!
