Pure manifestation of evil
It's black and it's dismal
You'd never know until its upon you...
You're on a bender
I'm desconstructing the disease

You've burned the bridges
You've sowed the lies
You've burned the bridge
You're on the shitlist!

You've burned the bridges
You've sowed the lies
You've burned the bridge
You're on the shitlist!

Hate holds me together
Your skin's not worth the saving
Just keep my name outta your mouth
On your fuckin' benders
I'm desconstructing the disease

You've burned the bridges
You've sowed the lies
You've burned the bridge
You're on the shitlist!

You've burned the bridges
You've sowed the lies
You've burned the bridge
You're on the hit list!

The tables have turned
I've opened my eyes
Look at all you've burned
You're an the shitlist!

Fear will do what must be done
Death will reign from above

[Solo]

You've burned the bridges
You've sowed the lies
You've burned the bridge
You're on the hit list!

The tables have turned
I've opened my eyes
Look at all you've burned
You're on the shitlist!

You know who you are
You're on the hit list!
