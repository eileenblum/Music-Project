It's no wonder that you hang
Together... Can't keep myself sane
I flee in solace forever
Life's short, so duck for cover
Walls have ears, and the ears have eyes
They're all allies against the same enemy

[Chorus:]
I don't know what the future holds,
If you search for gold, better not sleep alone

I don't know you but I fucking hate you,
And what I am saying is it's been a blur.
I don't know you but I fucking hate you,
And what I am saying it was all a blur.

It's all about the opinion
I'm in solitary confinement
What I' am saying is
You and yours will face the judgement
Walls have ears, and the ears have eyes
They're all allies against the same enemy

[Chorus]

Self-loathing son of a bitch
Pick up the pace, pick up the pace

Obliterate the suffering now
This is a sacrifice
Burn it all away, I'll burn it all down
Separate the arrogants

Obliterate the suffering
This is a sacrifice
Burn it all away, I'll burn it all down
Separate the arrogance

I don't know you but I fucking hate you

You're a marked man, a marked man
You're a marked man, a marked man

I don't know you, I fucking hate you
I don't know you, I fucking hate you.
