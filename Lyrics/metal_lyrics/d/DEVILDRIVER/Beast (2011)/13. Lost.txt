[Limited Edition Bonus Track]Eat your inners, choke on your tongue
Rip off your flesh, be gone 
Gouge eyes, drown in your spit 
Self-loathing son of a bitch - that's it
Who needs friends when I've got these meds
And I know where the trouble stems 
Who thinks it's all set to fail?
This is not the case

Punch the numbers, push the button
Keep life living... Escape
Punch the numbers, push the button
Keep life living... Escape

When justice meets revenge
There's much to ascertain
After the trigger is pulled...
Fools... All learn it the hard way

Lost (Amputate/Dismember)
Lost (Tank treads and train tracks)

Pull your hair out, eat poison
Jump from that window
Scratch your eyes out, fall down stairs
Just fucking die though
Who needs friends when I've got these meds
And I know where the trouble stems
Who thinks it's all set to fail ?
This is not the case

Concern is not your care
Shovel to the back, to the back of your head
Stare down this frozen glare
Nothing to fear, nothing 
Nothing !

Lost (Amputate/Dismember)
