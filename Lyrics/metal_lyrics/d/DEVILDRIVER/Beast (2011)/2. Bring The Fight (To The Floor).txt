Torrid tales from the rats,
They're filled with disgust
I'm closer to closure now than
I've ever been
It's so honestly honest just who's my friend
And who's riding the coattails 'til the end

Sure as shit
There's nothing that will change me
There's nothing sure as shit

Now there's no quick fix
You're broke,
no quick fix
You're broke,
no price for power

Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power
Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power

I'm pushed to the limit,
in my heart I've got malice
Cultivated in Cali...
And wasted in wonderland
Better the devil you know,
Than the one you don't
You can not trust
Another and you know you won't

Sure as shit
There's nothing that will change me
There's nothing sure as shit

Now there's no quick fix
You're broke,
no quick fix
You're broke,
no price for power

Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power
Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power

Annihilate to obliterate
Step fucking in
And redeem your fate...
Shot to the center of everything
Welcome to the new world!

[SOLO]

Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power
Bring the fight
Bring the fight
To the floor
No price for power
