Pass them by 'til all their pain subsides as the lamb lays by your side the last season is upon us tough to deal with a real hard case make no mistake no bones about it never fit in but I've found my place!

Going in dirty as pigs... Sacred secrets of the sorrow bound going in dirty as pigs watching as it comes unwound

You make me sick! [x4]

Irreverent and full of wants shaking at the foundation gone again but not gone for good living in sedation think so little of yourself to think of no one else hope no one tells make no mistake no bones about it never fit in but I've found my place!

Going in dirty as pigs... Sacred secrets of the sorrow bound going in dirty as pigs watching as it comes unwound

You make me sick! [x4]

With everything you do with everything you are everything you say you take it too far you make me sick, you make me sick!

This sour taste remains this sour taste remains disdain, disdain, disdain. This sour taste remains this sour taste remains disdain, disdain, disdain. 

Your actions speak louder than words all I do is throw the curse

You make me sick! [x4]

With everything you do with everything you are everything you say you take it too far you make me sick, you make me sick!

Your actions speak louder then words all I do is throw the curse! I'll burn it down before it turns black there's no solutions so I'm on the attack
