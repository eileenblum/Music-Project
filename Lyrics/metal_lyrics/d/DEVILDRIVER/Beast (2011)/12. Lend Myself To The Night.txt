These spirits exact a heavy toll
I've had it
Thrown caution out of the window
Let evil in at times...
Paid an exact price for all my crimes
Bathed in blood but came out...
Clean as a holy shrine

Lend myself to the night
Thrown myself to the wind, fuck it!
It's worth the risk, it's worth the risk
It's worth believing in

Bells ringing in the eyes of fire
I've had it
Watch what you seek, it really exists
Let evil in at times...
Paid an exact price for all my crimes
Bathed in blood but came out...
Clean as a holy shrine

Lend myself to the night
Thrown myself to the wind, fuck it!
It's worth the risk, it's worth the risk
It's worth believing in

True, I've been there and back again
Found myself face down on the tracks, face down
