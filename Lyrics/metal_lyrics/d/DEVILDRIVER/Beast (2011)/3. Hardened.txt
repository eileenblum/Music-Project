Outlast, outrun and kill the strong
We run as one, the hunt begun
I lay in wait out with my pack
'til dawn of day when we attack!
The first ones down without a sound
Then comes the second round
Where screams of pain and throws of lust
Have just begun to quench us!

With tooth and claw
We use our might
To tear them down,
Secure the fight
To sounds of screams that fill the night
The end is near, 
The meal in sight
If might makes right
Then we ignite
Like moth to flame,
They cry in pain
The ones who escape
Remember our name,
Remember our name,
Remember our name!

Hunger drives a wolf...
From the woods when he comes to hunt,
Kill
Or hell, stay for good

Hardened (Hardened towards your world)
Hardened (Hardened towards your...words)
Hardened...in eternal vigil
Hardened like steel
Hard as hell

This thirst is on,
The carnage on
Take out the weak,
Take out the strong
We come in quick and hit them hard
And cut them down with little sound

With tooth and claw
We use our might
To tear them down,
Secure the fight
To sounds of screams that fill the night
The end is near, 
The meal in sight
If might makes right
Then we ignite
Like moth to flame,
They cry in pain
The ones who escape
Remember our name,
Remember our name,
Remember our name!

Hunger drives a wolf...
From the woods when he comes to hunt,
Kill
Or hell, stay for good

Hardened (Hardened towards your world)
Hardened (Hardened towards your...words)
Hardened...in eternal vigil
Hardened like steel
Hard as hell

Send them packing
Stranger in my home
Godd riddance,
I never knew you
In the eyes of the fight the righteous bleeding
The blood that boils but god I love the killing!

[Solo]

Look to the skies, see  the anger is seething
I'm gonna come with all at you, all at you!
Full guns out and blazing
The bodies fall as the stench thickness

Hardened
I'm hardened towards your world
Hard as hell!
Hardened
I'm hard as hell
Hardened
