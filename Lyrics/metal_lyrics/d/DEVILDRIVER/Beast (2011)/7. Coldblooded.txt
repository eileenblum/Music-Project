Choking on the ladders you're hoping to climb
Swimming through the oceans divine
You keep wishing on stars that won't take you far
Wish me wish me far away

Beyond the voices is where the snakes lie the world is venomous
Beyond the fences is where they go to die
The world is venomous, it's fucking relentless!

Scrutinized, no one denies
You play the victim
Coldblooded, coldblooded they watch your lies, no one denies you play the victim
Coldblooded, coldblooded

There's fire in the goddamn sky
Dead but still dreaming
Lean on the dream that won't take you far
Wish me, wish me far away

Beyond the voices is where the snakes lie the world is venomous
Beyond the fences is where they go to die
The world is venomous, it's fucking relentless!

Scrutinized, no one denies
You play the victim
Coldblooded, coldblooded they watch your lies, no one denies you play the victim
Coldblooded, coldblooded

Scrutinized, no one denies
You play the victim
Coldblooded, coldblooded they watch your lies, no one denies you play the victim
Coldblooded, coldblooded

Deeds of the flesh, all put to rest stay steady
Coldblooded, coldblooded
They watch your lies, no one denies
You play the victim
Coldblooded, coldblooded
