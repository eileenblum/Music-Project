What was said was like thunder in my head
I felt the earth quaking
The absence of atonement, all smiles...
Feed on me while you bring the unmaking

From the abyss without remiss
I pledge my person
I pledge my demon
No cure for money and allure
I pladge my person
I pledge my demon

Talons out and teeth sharpened
Don't let the fuckin' world beat you down
Talons out and teeth sharpened
Don't let the fuckin' world beat you down!

Antisocial, you're uncontrollable
Get away with murder
The absence of atonement, all smiles
It's all war from here

From the abyss without remiss
I pledge my person
I pledge my demon
No cure for money and allure
I pladge my person
I pledge my demon

Your glue
It's not gonna stick
Tape won't mend a broken heart
And some things you just can't fix

Talons out and teeth sharpened
Don't let the fuckin' world beat you down
Talons out and teeth sharpened
Don't let the fuckin' world beat you down!

Lift yourself up from the ground
Come at them with teeth sharpened
Talons out and teeth sharpened
Don't let the fuckin' world beat you down!

It's a pre-emptive strike so bring the fighting
You're the first in line
Something tells me
The fix is all around me
So bring the fighting, so bring the fighting
Bring it

[Solo]

Tape won't mend a broken heart
And some things you just can't fix

Talons out and teeth sharpened
Don't let the fuckin' world beat you down
Talons out and teeth sharpened
Don't let the fuckin' world beat you down!

Lift yourself up from the ground
Come at them with teeth sharpened
Talons out and teeth sharpened
Don't let the fuckin' world beat you down!

Beat you down!
