Is this what you came for
I know what I'm here for
Knocked down right to the floor
Commited to kill!
What you don't know
Can't just let it go!
They webbed me in this

Take cause you need more
Don't ask what's in store!
You'll be knocked down right to the floor
Committed to kill!
What you don't know
Can't just let it go
With all their hypocrisy!

My stomach's in knots
Throw at me what you got
'Cause I will break free,
of all the webs that bind me
My stomach's in knots
Throw at me what you got
'Cause I will break free,
of all the webs that bind me

I'm fit to be tied
I've got you dead to rights
It's like a suicide
Living alongside you

So...
Get what you came for
Fucked up on the floor
Kick straight out the door
Get yourself up
And bend to no man
No man
Who webbed me in this

Take cause you need more
Don't ask what's in store!
You'll be knocked down right to the floor
Committed to kill!
What you don't know
Can't just let it go
With all their hypocrisy!

My stomach's in knots
Throw at me what you got
'Cause I will break free,
of all the webs that bind me
My stomach's in knots
Throw at me what you got
'Cause I will break free,
of all the webs that bind me

I'm fit to be tied
I've got you dead to rights
It's like a suicide
Living alongside you

Webbed me up!
You webbed me up!
Hung me out to dry
Had no idea
I've got you dead to rights
Dead...to...rights!

Don't take it so personal
Its just that trouble is coming

You know it to be goddamn true!!!

I've got you dead to rights!
I've got you dead to rights!
I've got you dead to rights!
I've got you...
I've got you dead to rights!
I've got you dead to rights!
I've got you dead to RIGHTS!
