Turn your tired eyes home, put the sword to stone
Death by boredom, the reach man bears the burden
That the poor man seeks to chase
The chase is certain

Did not see it coming, better stand for something
They're wicked as they come, break the cycle
Racing down the flames, while building the coffins
Iron unbroken, break the cycle

It's a bitter pill, such a bitter pill to swallow [x2]

I've broke the cycle, after all these years
Death by boredom, not afraid to reveal
What the world is sensing, the chase is certain

Did not see it coming, better stand for something
They're wicked as they come, break the cycle
Racing down the flames, while building the coffins
Iron unbroken, break the cycle
[x2]

It's a bitter pill, such a bitter pill to swallow [x2]

Silence is my companion

With a pride it's going worldwide
It's spreading worldwide
Across the great divide
[x2]

Healer, believer
On the bended knee, when push comes to shove
Healer, believer
Time and time again, you push me too far

It's a bitter pill, such a bitter pill to swallow
It's a bitter pill, such a bitter pill to swallow
It's a bitter pill
Such a bitter pill
It's a bitter pill, such a bitter pill to swallow
