Trouble is on its way
It's on its way

Another day, another decision
One that eventually affects us both
Teach me to whisper, cause I feel like screaming
Teach me to whisper

Anger and hatred are their oars
Revenge their vessel
Be strong, be patient

Making the best of a bad situation
Making the best of!
Making the best of a bad situation
Making the best of!

This is your conscience speaking, spare your spirit
Trouble is on its way, it's on its way
Teach me to whisper
Cause I feel like screaming, teach me to whisper

Anger and hatred are their oars
Revenge their vessel
Be strong
Be patient

Making the best of a bad situation
Making the best of!
Making the best of a bad situation
Making the best of!

Behold the destroyer
By the hand of man
Death be delivered
[x2]

Anger and hatred are their oars
Revenge their vessel
Be strong
Be patient

Making the best of a bad situation
Making the best of!
Making the best of a bad situation
Making the best of!
