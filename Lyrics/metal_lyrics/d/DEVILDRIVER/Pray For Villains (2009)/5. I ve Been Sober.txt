Lord I miss the highway, running against the wind
Blessed are the stoned, and all the places they've been
Shadow of a man at home, beating a dead horse
Home too long, cross to bear

Methods of the past mold the future
You can't fall short as you get older
being underground is being trapped, seize the day
Wear the chains you forged in life
Link by link by link

I've been sober 13 days and 7 nights
I know next time I'll get it right
You tried to make me stay
I said 'No Way', grabbed my bag and hit the highway

Echoes in the dark, new faces bring the sun
Comfort and disturbed, always think the worst
You live and die by your own decisions
You live and die by your own religion

Being run around is being trapped
Seized up, kept!!

Wear the chains you forged in life
Link by link by link [x2]
I've been sober 13 days and 7 nights
I know next time I'll get it right
You tried to make me stay

Sobriety suits you so well, it suits you so well
It suits you so well [x3]
So well!!!
