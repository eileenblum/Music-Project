Run to the river, run to the sea
Cast my body down, baptize me
He came for my sorrow, he came for my pain
Through the sun, he came for the rain

Over the ocean and the black to the sea.
A new day is dawning and hope caries me
There's a hole in my head that lets the rain in
There ain't no laws for the brave ones, oh no

There ain't no silence now for the crazy
There ain't no help for the lazy, oh no!
I ain't never stole to get high
I ain't never done wrong to get by

Dirt is what made me
So dust be the destiny
Dirt is what made me
So dust be the destiny

As we walk now with cross to bare
It's a rough game, ya gotta play fair
Revolt against the reason
The man is coming any season now!

I ain't never stole to get high
I ain't never done to get by
I think therefore I'm dangerous
I ain't never stole to get high

Dirt is what made me
So dust be the destiny
Dirt is what made me
So dust be the destiny
