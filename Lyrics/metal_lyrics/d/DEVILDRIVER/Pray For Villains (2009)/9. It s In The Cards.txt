Between the head and the hands, must surely be an heart
Time and space is an illusion for man
One foot in the grave and one to start
Walking against the wind, living by the night

We're all thick as thieves sometimes, and I know it ain't right

It's in the cards, written in the stars
Scratched on the walls of the bars, man
Where demons dwell
Where demons dwell!!

Got scars in bars (knife fight)
Broke bones in arms (ducked a gunfight)
It's hunters moon and I'll be gone soon
You stare like a goat with a twisted smile

There's another motherfucker wants a fist fight
Bringing knives to a gun fight

We're all thick as thieves sometimes, and I know it ain't right

It's in the cards, written in the stars
Scratched on the walls of the bars, man
Where demons dwell
Where demons dwell!!

It's in the cards, written in the stars
Scratched on the walls of the bars, man
Where demons dwell
Where demons dwell!!
