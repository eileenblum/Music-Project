Midnight!
The midnight sky brings the star alive, makes my soul thrive
As the desert is calls me home, heavy the sin and the that it brings
Death, don't keep me from my door.

Are you afraid to die?
Have you been sanctified
By the blood purified?

Keep me from my door
The October moon couldn't come to soon
So damn the summer
Get the devil in all of ya

Damning the heavens, keep!
Damning the heavens, keep!
Damning the heavens
[x2]

Cold wing sings, dark kiss on her back
His mark upon the bow, guided us along
When you bury the beast

Better cover his blood and bones, deep
And point his eyes down
Seen in the starts last night
Read in the cards today
This will wash away, keep!

Damning the heavens, keep!
Damning the heavens, keep!
Damning the heavens
[x2]

You are living in this world, this shall pass [x2]

Damning the heavens, keep!
Damning the heavens, keep!
Damning the heavens
[x2]

Are you afraid to die?
Have you been sanctified
By the blood purified?

You are living in this world, shall have day and night
You are living in this world, shall do wrong and wright
