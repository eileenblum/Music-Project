A pain by any other name, is death before its time is due
You survived and made it through
Still inside the loss is buried deep
With what you went through at the funeral
Don't know how you pushed on, buried your creator

Took good care, such kind care

You look so beautiful at your funeral
Laid out and dressed your best, as your daughter put you to rest
You have such faith in life, can't tell you how many times
You've given me my backbone

Took good care, such kind care

You look so beautiful at your funeral
Laid out and dressed your best, as your daughter put you to rest
[x2]

Waiting for November, trying to make you smile
A birthday shared by two, scorpio child

You look so beautiful at your funeral, laid out and dressed your best
As your daughter put you to rest
[x2]

To rest!
So rest! [x2]

Buried in a far away place [x3]
