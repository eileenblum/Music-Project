Death rides a horse full force, burning bridges
Put asunder, this I'm under
One face, one oath, one truth
Easy money consorts with easy virtue

Sing you sinners silent thunder
The joy of rapture, riding the bullet
It can't be captured
One face, one oath, one truth
Easy money consorts with easy virtue

No methods to their madness
It's gonna be a long hot winter

I see  belief, when no one else does
I see belief, when no one else does

Hope dies, better off think of one
Hope dies, these rules are for fools
One face, one oath, one truth
Easy money consorts with easy virtue

Sing you sinners silent thunder
The joy of rapture, riding the bullet
It can't be captured
One face, one oath, one truth
Easy money consorts with easy virtue

No methods to their madness
It's gonna be a long hot winter

I see  belief, when no one else does
I see belief, when no one else does
