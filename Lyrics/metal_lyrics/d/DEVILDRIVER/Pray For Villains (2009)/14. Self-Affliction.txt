Words never heal, deadly unreal
Just to be glad to be alive
Just to survive, turn pain into glory, glory!

When the earthquakes and the words don't come
And all reason is gone
And hope has left you fleeting
Goddamn bleeding

Like a stray dog, brought back to the fold
Out in the cold, brought back to the fold
But I still stand by

You'll never justify
Better, better sanctify
You'll never rectify
Your self-affliction

After hours, late night courage
We should have a one to one
The powers at be, have brought us together man
So bro!

When the earthquakes and the words don't come
And all reason is gone
And hope has left you fleeting
Goddamn bleeding

Like a stray dog, brought back to the fold
Out in the cold, brought back to the fold
But I still stand by

You'll never justify
Better, better sanctify
You'll never rectify
Your self-affliction
[x2]

Your self-affliction
Your self-affliction
