From counted out to feared, some say
That I'm back with a vengeance, I never left
I smell your fear, cause I'm back with a vengeance

Bruised tattered and torn, if it's punishing
Overtimes even the score

Don't start thinking that you've got the best of me.
I've got some news for you, you ain't seen the last of me, no!
Don't start thinking that you've got the best of me.
I've got some news for you, you ain't seen the last of me, no!

One foot in Hell, up on the highway
Now I'm back with a vengeance, no matter what I've said
The vendetta's not dead, I'm back with a vengeance

Bruised tattered and torn, if it's punishing
Overtimes even the score

Don't start thinking that you've got the best of me.
I've got some news for you, you ain't seen the last of me, no!
Don't start thinking that you've got the best of me.
I've got some news for you, you ain't seen the last of me, no!

No! The last of me! [x2]
I've got some news for you, you ain't seen the last of me, no!

I've been waiting all this time, because time is on my side
Not in the future -- time is now
Because time is on my side
On my side!

Don't start thinking that you've got the best of me.
I've got some news for you, you ain't seen the last of me, no!
Don't start thinking that you've got the best of me.
I've got some news for you, you ain't seen the last of me, no!

No! The last of me
No! Don't you ever think!
I've got some news for you!
No! The last of me
No! Don't you ever think!
No! You've seen the last of me
