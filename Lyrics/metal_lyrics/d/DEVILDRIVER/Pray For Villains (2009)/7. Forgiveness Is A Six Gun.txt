33rd degree, on the corner of Quit street and Temptation Avenue
On the road to redemption, outside of heave
Pride can be dangerous and you knew
Method of Execution, length of duration
At what cost?

Forgiveness is a six gun, teach me how to shoot
The truth is like a moving target, forgiveness is a six gun

The streets from the start, have been filled with doubt
And they are set free, you needed someone to carry you
Fighting and counting the days, the error of your ways
Methods of execution, length of duration, at what cost?

Forgiveness is a six gun, teach me how to shoot
The truth is like a moving target, forgiveness is a six gun

In cold blood, dressed in black
Tombstones and tumbleweeds
Left the dead behind, watched em falling
Let Smith and Wesson do the motherfucking talking

Dust in my eyes, dust in the street, shotguns and broken dreams
Now we left the dead behind, watched em falling
Let the Smith and Wesson  do the motherfucking talking

Now!

Forgiveness is a six gun, teach me how to shoot
The truth is like a moving target, forgiveness is a six gun
There is no forgiveness [x4]
