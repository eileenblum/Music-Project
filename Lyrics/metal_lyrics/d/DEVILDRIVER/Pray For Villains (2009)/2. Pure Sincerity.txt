Dying is Easy
It's living that's hard
It's so disturbing to hear what you're fearing
Rain of terror out in the cold

Give em what they want
Give em what they need

Pure sincerity [x2]
It's what made me born from insanity
Pure sincerity
Pure!

Questions asked, the answers come quickly
Remorse can be so dangerous
Wolf in the fold, terror within
Out in the cold

Give em what they want
Give em what they need

Pure sincerity [x2]
It's what made me born from insanity
Pure sincerity

The things I am
The things that I've become
The wings of honor
Son, Father

Don't know if I can stand
Where I once fucking stood
If I could, if I could
Don't you think I fucking would!
Things to come, it must be from the heart
Things to come

Are these shadows of things from the past?
Are these the shadows of things to come?
Things come, to come!
Things to come
Where do we go? [x2]

Pure sincerity [x2]
It's what made me born from insanity
Pure sincerity
