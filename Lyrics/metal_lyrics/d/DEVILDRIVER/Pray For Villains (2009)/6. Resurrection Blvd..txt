She brings me nails and turpentine
All of this time the girl was mine
I am in love like a rusted dog
All of the time my head in the fog

Phone keeps ringing -- she's asking for more
The spaces between places, I'm not worthy, leave me alone

You should have never left me alive
You should have sat and watched me die

Isn't it hard, living on Resurrection Boulevard
Isn't it hard?
Isn't it hard!
[x2]

He bring me life so full of smiles, all of this time been friends for miles
Logging hours, laughing for days, talking shit on other ways
Cats in the corners, dogs on the floor

Phone keeps ringing -- she's asking for more
The spaces between places, I'm not worthy, leave me alone

You should have never left me alive
You should have sat and watched me die

Isn't it hard, living on Resurrection Boulevard
Isn't it hard?
Isn't it hard! [x5]

You should have never left me alive!

Isn't it hard, living on Resurrection Boulevard
Isn't it hard? [x2]
Isn't it?
