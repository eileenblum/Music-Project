- Storm coming in me, bad weather just makes me breathe - Watch as the sky turns grey, life ebbs and flows away - Wait, before I
go, I'll make them all eat crow - Play the hand life deals, everything my way, now kneel - I'm a tree, roots firm in dirt, I've
had my share of hurt - Move fast 'cause the time is short, 'cause the time is short - - Don't ask me to lose 'cause I'm born now
to win - And I'm building this mountain from outside within - All you outsiders, you haters and liars - Your time is just
counting so come meet the mountain - - Storm, strength coming on strong, rain wash away life's wrongs - Willing straight from the
start, strike fear into their heart - Sometimes you wish you'd never been born but then here comes the storm - And just as the
sky turns black, the voices say attack - Move fast 'cause the time is short, 'cause the time is short - Move fast 'cause the time
is short, 'cause the time is short - - Don't ask me to lose 'cause I'm born now to win - And I'm building this mountain from outside
within - - All you outsiders, you haters and liars - Your time is just counting so come meet the mountain - - Come meet the mountain
- - Falling, life - Life ebbs and flows away - Don't ask me to lose 'cause I'm born now to win - And I'm building this mountain from
outside within - All you haters and liars just come meet the mountain
