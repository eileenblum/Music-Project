- What do I have to do...for this? - - I love this, please push me harder - I just keep getting meaner - I'm growing from the pain
- How about you! Shit - - Life, it's hard, it makes me stronger - A warrior seeking victory - I'll push it 'til the end, push it
'til the end - Push it 'til the end, shit the end, shit the end - - Knee deep in the shit - All together in the pit - All forever
in the shit for this - - Pirate, poet, fucking killer - It's all what you've made me - What has life made you - Made you, shit -
- Life, chalk it up to desire - Of which I've had my fill - I just keep pushing forward, keep pushing forward still - Keep
pushing forward still, shit, still, shit, still - - Knee deep in the shit - All together in the pit - All forever in the shit for
this - - So if you feel the need, bring it, bring it - And if you just want to spit it out, bring it, bring it - And if you just
see your way clear then, bring it, bring it - - Knee deep in the shit - All together in the pit - All forever in the shit for
this - - Knee deep in the shit - For this - Knee deep in the shit - For this
