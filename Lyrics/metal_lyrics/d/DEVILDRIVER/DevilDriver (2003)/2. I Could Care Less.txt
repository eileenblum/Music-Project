- Every time you speak my name - My image it just burns away - Every time you speak my name - My image it just burns away - -
Gimme that - - I could care less than for your grandiosity - I had to skin the cat for curiosity - I could care less than for
your sickening, pompous ways - Every time you speak my name my image burns away - - I could care less - - Don't you know our
lives are on trial now - And if we lose we're going straight to Hell - - Gimme that - - You must excuse me I'm just really not
myself - Woke up today inside, inside of someone else - I could care less than for your sickening, pompous ways - Every time you
speak my name my image burns away - - I could care less - - Don't you know our lives are on trial now - And if we lose we're
going straight to Hell - Straight to Hell - - I could care less - Straight to Hell
