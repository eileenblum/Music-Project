Destroy all
Destroy all or nothing

I dreamed I died, ended up at the gates of Heaven
Greeted by a man Saint Someone, said how's the ride son?
It's been alright, at times a little rough, why am I here?
You did alright, lived a little dark and that's alright
'Cause we made the darkside and the rightside is to have no fear, no fear

My whole life flashed in front of me
I saw everything that I was and what I had done
Even let me look back on some good times for a little fun
Yes, a little fun
And then I heard "Damn boy, you done good,
Did the every little thing that you could."
And then I heard "Damn boy, you done good - Damn good!"

When you hear the call, bury them all
Destroy all or nothing
When I hear the call, I will bury them all
I will destroy all or nothing

When the sky opened up and the clouds parted clear
There wasn't any doubt to why I was here
And I knew I'd done a good job, the best job that I could do
So now it was time to move on, to get on, to get back
To the question of why I was here and what I had learned, no fear

My whole life flashed in front of me
I saw everything that I was and what I had done
Even let me look back on some good times for a little fun
Yes, a little fun
And then I heard "Damn boy you done good,
Did every little thing that you could."
And then I heard "Damn boy you done good - Damn good!"

When you hear the call, bury them all
Destroy all or nothing
When I hear the call, I will bury them all
I will destroy all or nothing

My whole life
My whole life (flashed)

[x2]
My whole life flashed in front of my eyes

(My whole life) flashed (My whole life) in front of my eyes

[x2]
Goddamn, wake up, bad dream

[x2]
Goddamn, wake up, bad dream, bad dream

When you hear the call, bury them all
Destroy all or nothing
When I hear the call, I will bury them all
I will destroy all or nothing
