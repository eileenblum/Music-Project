- Fire - - I am the one, I am the one that you need - I am the one, I am the one that you need - I am the one, I am the one - -
The Devil's son has just begun - To shine, to shine - - I am the one to do the deed, I am - I am the one to do the deed - I am
the one to do the deed - I am the one - - I am the one, I am the one that you need - I am the one, I am the one Two - I am the
one, I am the one - I am the one - - The Devil's son has just begun - To shine, to shine, to shine - - What's left unsaid - Yeah
things come around - This is the one this is - - This is the one this is - - The Devil's son has just begun - To shine, to shine,
to shine - - Fire
