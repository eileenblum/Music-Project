can't you see you're in my way? - Your ways are killing you - - Do what thou wilt - Shall be the whole of the law - Do what thou
wilt - All they understand is the claw - - Why can't you see you're in my way? - Your ways are killing you - Your ways are
killing me - Killing me - Killing you - - So go fuck yourself anyway - Keep this hunger - - There's nothing wrong - With how I
live my life today - There's nothing wrong - So go fuck yourself anyway - - Why can't you see you're in my way?
