Blood thirsty, born on the wind
Hellbent, outside looking in
Voices that carry on nightly
Don't ask, just go in now blindly
I'm bloodshot, thrown away goods
Venomous, so fucking ruthless
A well of anger to be avoided

Extended forgiveness and then got bit
They call it the breaking point
When it comes to faith, this time you've quit
You call it the breaking point
Stand up against the gates and be counted, when summoned

Nothings ever set in stone
Wade through, harvest seeds you've sown
It's alright, right as rain, and as far as I'm concerned, Fuck the fame!

[Chorus]

Climbing...scratching...uphill,
So breathless, lifeless, able still
Long live this short life trouble
