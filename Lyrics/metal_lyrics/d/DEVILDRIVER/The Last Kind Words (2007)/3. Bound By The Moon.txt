Brothers and Sisters
The lords taking his own sweet time
without rhyme or reason
The failure is not thine
Like wolves to a virgin
The intention is made clear
At war with ourselves
At war with the odds
At odds with the fear
Hard time will bring you way, way down
And all of this running
It's gonna be the death of me

When they ask you about this
Tell them i was...
Running in the company of wolves
It's the company we keep
Brotherhood
Bound by the moon!

Went to the well
But the goddamn thing was dry today
I spent all of my life
Running from suicide
Is it the fucking fool
That keeps on chasing the dream?
A dream that cannot fail
So proudly we hail!

When they ask you about this
Tell them i was...
Running in the company of wolves
It's the company we keep
Brotherhood
Bound by the moon!
And we shall roam
And the wolf fucking fucked her
lay as she lay bleeding on the moors...
Bleeding on the moors
Running in the company of wolves
It's the company we keep
Brotherhood
Bound by the moon!

Brotherhood of wolves
