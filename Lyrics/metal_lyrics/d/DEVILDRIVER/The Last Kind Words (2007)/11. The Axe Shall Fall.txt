This abomination won't see the end of days
Sit throne of lies, torn
By the voice up high
Death was only a dream
Not devastating disaster
The rights of passage
The past we can't alter, fuck you, you
And the horse that you rode in on, just sit there
And be silent as the grave
You've come out this time, smelling just like roses
I sit there, watch, while I drink my wine

The weight of your sins and the evil beneath us
Will surely drag you down,
The axe shall fall
On the one-winged angel, breaking the spell
would you break this fall?
For he, who sins against his kind
The axe shall fall

With a hollow heart and hollow eyes, a cry from the cross
Serpents in disguise, hearts of distrust is what we despise
I sit there watch and drink my wine

[Chorus]
