What the fuck do you want from me?
It's so damn plain to see that you're not grateful
Silence takes courage
No scars, no truth but the wounds tell the story
Of what will be done for honor and glory
Silence is deafening
Does the end justify the means?
In all honesty, how do you sleep?
Silence takes courage
The horn of betrayal
Sounds loudly for the fallen
While mine eyes are world away
Watch cowards as they bend the knee
Scratch a liar
Find a thief
inside is where the demon dwells
So I bite my tongue and when it comes to you
Silence takes courage
Your heart needs amputation
Crying the get-lost blues
Fuck you!
Silence is deafening
The horn of betrayal
Sounds loudly for the fallen
While mine eyes are world away
Watch cowards as they bend the knee
Scratch a liar
Find a thief
Through the lies and the blasphemy
You are fucking dead to me
You are dead to me
This de los muerte, this day of the dead It turns for me celebration instead
Skull and Bones, walking away from the throne
To seek another kingdom
Your selfless heart
Your selfless
Waves of sorrow washed over me
Your selfless
Like a sea of new memories
