Come forth for the cattle call
Confront the evil river you can't control
Wicked ways and venomous eyes
Just human nature in disguise
Lost in this world, Out on the edge
With death by our sides
Today I sworn that I wouldn't Mourn ya
Cloud over California
If that's the way it's gonna be the I'll fuckin' go it alone
I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign!
Bloodshot and weary-eyed
We took you in full of sin and pride
It'll take you and break you away
It'll tear you apart
Today I sworn I wouldn't mourn ya
Clouds over California
if that's the way it's gonna be the I'll fuckin' go it alone
I'm a saint in sinners eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign!
