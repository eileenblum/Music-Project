Pleading your case while taking the eternal high ground
Havoc on the airwaves I'm listening
Don't see any daylight glistening
Long for the home I left yesterday
Those memories slowly decay, Two highways
The fork in the road, which one to take?
Through the middle they road

These fighting words deserve exile
Banished! Unbelievable, unbelievable, invincible...right!

Fucking feast for the eyes
Believe now- beast killer arise
In my opinion this dominion is mine!
Banished, days gone awry

[Chorus]
