Reaping the wind through this mortal shell
In the wake of destruction this will not fail
Walking through shadows defined by my suffering
Feeding the spirit through divine intervention

Out of the fire, so much for compassion
I've thrown it to desire, in time you'll hear
Tirades of truth
Glazed and angry eyes
Spoken to by the breath of Gods
In the valley of deaths decision
The judgement...listen
The last kind words ever said will be
You will live below angels and above beasts

It's seldom clear the roads to temptation
Are filled with such peril but the human spirit can
Soar, it's more than we can ever be in one lifetime
We need more to become Gods ourselves

[Chorus]
