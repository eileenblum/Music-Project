There's dirt on my shoes and there's mud on his back
He's been chasing his nightmares for days
I'm running with evil, its impending disaster
I've finally steered clear of his way

I see it staring you down
I feel it wrapping around
Shits taking you down so quick
I see it staring you down
I feel it wrapping around
Shits taking you down so quick

Why can't I help my friend when he won't even help himself

I can't yell at you because
I've yelled at myself so many times
Hard times, hard times
Goddamn we're two of a kind

I can't yell at you because
I've yelled at myself so many times
Who now is to blame
When karma keeps coming around

Hard times and troubles we all live in peril
Its difficult, full of dismay
He buries his feelings, he shrouds his light
With oh so many evil thoughts

It's the dirt on your shoes
It's mud on our back
That makes us one in the same

I see it staring you down
I feel it wrapping you round
Shits taking you down so quick because
I've yelled at myself so many times

Who now is to blame
When karma keeps coming around
With so many evil things

Who now is to blame
When karma keeps coming around
So many evil things
