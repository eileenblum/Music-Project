Solemn roads and the paths least chose
Walking miles when the ground is frozen
Selling souls that aren't yours to give
Some must go and other may live

Pale horse - apocalypse
Stale breath - from liar's lips
Many many lives
Turned upside down

Bloods clean - you know it is
Downstream - it's mine, not his

Red water churns
Watch the evil river burn

Every mistake that you've made
Is more dirt on the grave
That you've been digging
Not for yourself but for us
Fuck you

Congratulations on your efforts dead ends
Between us, let's not pretend half-ass, jackass, liar

You threw us all in the fire
Under a hale of gunfire
Some will live and others expire
You turned it all upside down

Bloods clean - you know it's downstream - it's mine, not his
Red water churning
Watch the evil river burn

Every mistake that you've made
Is more dirt on your grave
That you've been digging
Not for yourself but for us
Fuck you

Half-ass jackass, liar
Bloods clean - you know it is
Downstream - it's mine.. not his
Red water churning watch the evil river burn

Every mistake that you've made
Is more dirt on the grave
That you've been digging
Not for yourself but for us
Fuck you
You fucking liar!
