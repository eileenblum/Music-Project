Regrets night sweats
Occasional thoughts of suicide
Green light I'm OK
Feeling fine just a little tongue tied

Old habits die hard and I've lived so fast
And I know it's a long way down
Tempting me
Tempting you
Tempting us in all we do
Can't make a move
Show me a sign
What is your will
It's a.......
Long long way
Between sin and sacrifice

Lost sleep, count sheep
Can't see them to get my mind off of things
Toss and turn, candles burn
Grinding teeth and night endlessly

Old habits die hard and I've lived so fast
And I know it's a long way down
Tempting me
Tempting you
Tempting us in all we do
Can't make a move
Show me a sign
What is your will
It's a.......
Long long way
