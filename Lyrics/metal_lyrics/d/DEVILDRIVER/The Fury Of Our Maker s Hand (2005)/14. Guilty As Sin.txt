[Japanese bonus track]

There's dead leaves on the dirty ground
That's how I know you're not around
To be with me
I stroke your hair, kiss your lips,
Kiss the ground, but you're not around
And you're nowhere to be found

I'm innocent and you're guilty of the charges that are coming in
Guilty as sin
My heart is hit, even when, you are far away
I look to the sky, and ask the clouds to rain

I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm ready for the moon that can't stay eclipsed
I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm ready for the moon that can't stay eclipsed

Blood on my bed
Is now blood on my hands
When I was so far away
The guilt in your voice,
The mistaken word,
When I was nowhere to be found

You're innocent and I'm guilty of the charges that are coming in
Guilty as sin
Your heart is hit, even when, I am far away
You look to the sky, and ask the clouds to rain

I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm ready for the moon that can't stay eclipsed
I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm ready for the moon that can't stay eclipsed

I'm ready for the moon
I'm ready for the moon
I'm ready for the moon that can't stay eclipsed

Why can't we get it together?
Get it together
Why can't we get it together?

I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm ready for the moon that can't stay eclipsed
I'm so sorry my wings can't be clipped
But I'm ready for the moon that can't stay eclipsed

I'm ready for the moon
I'm ready for the moon
I'm ready for the moon that can't stay eclipsed
