[Japanese bonus track]

Walk under ladders
Shatter seven mirrors
They say that's bad luck
For seven years
So, drink your glasses
But not at midnight
Salt over your shoulder
Into the fury!

Goes through with insecure
Goes through with insecure

I laugh at hearses roll by

Never look in the evil eye
Hold my breath in cemeteries
Many ill wishes for my enemies

Cease fire, seize the day
I rue the day that you were made
Cease fire, seize the day
I rue the day that you were made

Go ahead and get it off your chest
With luck you may survive
The guillotine
Nothing's what it seems
Unlucky 13
Nothingâs what it seems
With the number thirteen

Lay under tin roofs
While lightning strikes
Not afraid
To rule the night
So many black cats
That cross my path
It gives me power
To work my wrath
Iâve knocked on wood
As the clock strikes twelve
This is the hour
When all the spirits dwell

I laugh at hearses roll by
Never look in the evil eye
Hold my breath in cemeteries
Many ill wishes for my enemies

Cease fire, seize the day
I rue the day that you were made
Cease fire, seize the day
I rue the day that you were made

Go ahead and get it off your chest
With luck you may survive
The guillotine
Nothing's what it seems
Unlucky 13
Nothingâs what it seems
With the number thirteen

Yeah, you!
Cease fire, seize the day
I rue the day that you were made
Cease fire, seize the day
I rue the day that you were made
Go ahead and get it off your chest
With luck you may survive
The guillotine
Nothingâs what it seems
Unlucky thirteen
Nothingâs what it seems
With the number thirteen
This unlucky life
This unlucky life
Unlucky thirteen
