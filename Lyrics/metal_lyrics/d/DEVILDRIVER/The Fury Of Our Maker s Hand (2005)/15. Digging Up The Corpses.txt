[Special re-release bonus track]Tell me another story!
Tell me another story!

Everyone has stories, they bore me, they bore me...
They end up feeling nervous...
Their stories... they bore me...
Everyone's got skeletons in their closet!
Don't ask me, where they got it!
You should have told the truth a long time ago...
Liar, LIAR!
I told you so!

Digging up the corpses, once again, tell me another story!
Digging up the corpses, that haunts you, they haunt you!
Digging up the corpses, once again, tell me another story!
Digging up the corpses, once again, corpses, corpses, once again.
Corpses! Digging! Up the! Corpses! Once again!

Back to another story, that haunts me, it haunts me...
So we shear the wolf from your story, that haunts you, haunts you...

Everyone's got skeletons in their closet!
Don't ask me, where they got it!
You should have told the truth a long time ago...
Liar, LIAR!
I told you so!

Digging up the corpses, once again, tell me another story!
Digging up the corpses, that haunts you, they haunt you!
Digging up the corpses, once again, tell me another story!
Digging up the corpses, once again, corpses, corpses, once again.
Corpses! Digging! Up the! Corpses! Once again!

Digging, digging, digging, digging
Up the, up the, up the, up the
Corpses, corpses, corpses, corpses

I should have never let you in!
Your soul is full of sin!
Now it's time to begin, digging up the corpses again!

Your stories!..... bore me.

Digging up the corpses, once again, tell me another story!
Digging up the corpses, that haunts you, they haunt you!
Digging up the corpses, once again, tell me another story!
Digging up the corpses, once again, corpses, corpses, once again.
Corpses! Digging! Up the! Corpses! Once again!

Go...ing, Go...ing, Go...ing, Go...ing. Gone.
