Just run
Courage without conviction
Is apathy at best
Better move with a quickness
Or get shit-canned like the rest
No-one taught you how to run with the pack
So blaze your own trail down
Catch yourself if you slip
Chances are there'll be no-one around

Get out leave it far behind
Get out leave it far behind
Get the fuck out

Run now... to save yourself
Run now... to take control
Run now... to save your life
Run now... it's do or die
Just run....

The grass is greener on the other side
No one here gets out alive
It's up to you to survive
There's a monster on your side

Get out leave it far behind
Get out leave it far behind
Get the fuck out

Run now... to save yourself
Run now... to take control
Run now... to save your life
Run now... it's do or die
Just run....

I've got faith on my side
Destiny on my side
I know it's getting better
I can feel it getting better
It can't get much worse
It couldn't get much worse

This time I'm gonna run

Run now... to save yourself
Run now... to take control
Run now... to save your life
Run now... it's do or die
Just run....
