Lights on but no-ones home
I should've left you on your own
You can't stand the heat you're all alone
YEEAAAA!!
Horseshoes and hand-grenades
Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda
Your bed is made
Another man down and gone

Take advantage, manipulate
Take advantage, you piece of shit
Grinfucked
Debit paid in full
You won't grinfuck me

This time the advantage is mine
This time vengeance is mine
This time vengeance is mine
Come seeking treasure
Without a map

It's in the journey and you'll never find your way back

Take advantage, manipulate
Take advantage, you piece of shit
Grinfucked
Debit paid in full
You won't grinfuck me

Drop down
Fool me once
Shame on you
Fool me twice
Shame on me

You've been grinfucked
