It's a good day to fuckin' die
A good day.... A fucking good day

Truth be told the water looks cold
And the trees fly by as we drive
The sun goes down
Sometimes I wanna stay
Sometimes I wanna leave
Sometimes I gotta ride
Riding this rail I know what I'm on
But not now what I'm in for
This train to somewhere seems to never end
As far as I can tell..... Hell

Before all hell breaks loose
Before the hangman's noose
And as the sun goes down
I'll say
It's a good day to die, a good day to die

Before the hangman's noose
I'll say
It's a good day to die a good day to die

No more stops, time to punch your ticket
This time this ride is one way
I can see a shadow of a man
And man it's coming my way
Riding this rail, I know what I'm on
But not now what I'm in for
This train to nowhere seems to never end
As far as I can tell...... Hell

Before all hell breaks loose
Before the hangman's noose
And as the sun goes down
I'll say
It's a good day to die, a good day to die

Before the hangman's noose
I'll say
It's a good day to die a good day to die

This day it will be mine
Shit

Before all hell breaks loose
I'll say
Before the hangman's noose
I'll say
It's a good day to die, a good day to die

Before all hell breaks loose
I'll say
This day will be mine........
Before all hell breaks loose
It's a good day to die.
