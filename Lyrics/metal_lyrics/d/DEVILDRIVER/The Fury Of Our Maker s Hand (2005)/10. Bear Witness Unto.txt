Scream in vain tonight
All the kings must fall
Take a stand tonight
All the kinds must fall
Fight or flight tonight
This night I'm craving disaster
Give them hell tonight
This night is meant for disaster

Go --- bear witness unto
This solitude, my solitude

Under the gun and without a knife
Its going off without a hitch
Get done!!!

Alright

Sink or swim tonight
Cant stop the way I'm feeling
Ring the bell tonight
All the kings must fall
Roll the dice tonight
Give it all to chance
I'm all in tonight
This night I'm craving disaster

Go --- bear witness unto
This solitude, my solitude

Under the gun without a knife
It's going off without a hitch
Get gone!!
