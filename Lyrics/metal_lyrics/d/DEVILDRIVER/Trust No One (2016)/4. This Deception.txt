This deception it cuts so deep,
And your perception
Is cloudy and weak!
To the ones departed, blame ominous skies,
Canât you see the look in my eyes!
The sight of your face it brings me pause,
And the sound of your voice just because,
I thought you were dead,
I wished you were dead,
Gone to the sound of applause!
The promises we keep,
While all the others sleep,
Vows to the maker, now whoâs nothing but a
Taker!
Life is just another sin
Itâs either you want out or in,
Say your prayers to the setting sun, and go back to square one
All that glitters cannot be gold
Iâve seen your smile it feels so cold, soâ¦
Another day another dollar
Hear these words and youâll know who
Iâm after!
The sight of your face it brings me pause,
And the sound of your voice itâs just because,
I thought you were dead,
Wished you were dead,
Gone to the sound of applause!
The promises we keep,
While all the others sleep,
Vows to the maker, now whoâs nothing but a taker!
Life is just another sin
Itâs either you want out or in,
Say your prayers to the setting sun, and go back to square one!
Cash your memories on the table, itâs whether youâre willing or able,
Say your prayers to the setting sun, and go back to square one!
As far as the eye can see,
Everything looks black to me,
Nothing to back it up,
Back-handed compliments just fuck things up!
I would rather die, and run you down
Then go on living
So...
BLEED
BLEED
BLEED
By example!
Life is just another sin
Itâs either you want out or in,
Say your prayers to the setting sun, and go back to square one!
Cash your memories on the table, itâs whether youâre willing or able,
Say your prayers to the setting sun, and go back to square one!
Bleed
Bleed by example!
Go back to square one!
