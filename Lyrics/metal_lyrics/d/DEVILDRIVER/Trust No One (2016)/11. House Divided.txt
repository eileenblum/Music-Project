This... house... is... divided!

This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Sing another sad, sad, song for the summer time
Scream another sad, sad, summer song!

Divided this house will fall
Bad idea I know
Bet I think I will
Bad idea I know
You could never look me in the eye
And feel good about where you stand as a man
You could never stand alone given where you stand as a man

This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end

Left me at the last
Good idea you thought
Left to hang myself
Bad idea I know
You could never look me in the eye
And feel good about where you stand as a man

This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Sing another sad, sad, song for the summer time
Scream another sad, sad, summer song!

For the summer time!

This house will never stand...

You could never look me in the eye!
You could never look me in my eye!

This house divided against itself can never stand
It takes a new beginning to kill a bitter end
Sing another sad, sad, song for the summer time
Scream another sad, sad, summer song
