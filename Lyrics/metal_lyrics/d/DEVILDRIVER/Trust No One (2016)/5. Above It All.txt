From the womb to the tomb forever faded!
Took you so many years
To get jaded!
Used to hang on every word until you made it,
Told everyone you hated it?!
Used to drive by the house to see the lights on,
Breaking bottles all night so we could bond.
If I told what I knew youâd be dead
By the shit that I hold on you
I took you into my house
And let you in,
Like family,
Just like a friend!
Thought I knew you
And even more
Till I saw your face
Then I wanted no more!
I was dreaming out loud,
My head up in the clouds,
I was Faded and so proud,
Oblivious to what would come to be!
Iâm just above it all
Itâs where youâll find me
Iâm just above it all,
Itâs where youâll see me
Iâm just above it all
Itâs where your gonna find me
Iâm just above it all,
Thatâs where youâll find me,
So fucking faded!
Gave you everything,
Showed you the signs,
Trusted your opinion,
Together we drew lines!
Crisis of character
Turned competitor,
Even after all weâve been through!?
I heard the rumors that you
Were going around
Running your mouth from town to town,
You aint even brought a tear,
To these eyes
So I swear its goodbye,
Iâm just above it all
Itâs where youâll find me
Iâm just above it all,
Itâs where youâll see me
Iâm just above it all
Itâs where youâre gonna find me
Iâm just above it all,
Thatâs where youâll find me, so fucking faded!
You â¦look
A little worried?
Cause you know that I know
Where the bodies are buried!
You â¦look a little worried!
Cause you know that I know
Where those bodies are buried!
Iâm just above it all
Itâs where youâll find me
Iâm just above it all,
Itâs where youâll see me
Iâm just above it all
Itâs where youâre gonna find me
Iâm just above it all,
Thatâs where youâll find me, so fucking faded!
