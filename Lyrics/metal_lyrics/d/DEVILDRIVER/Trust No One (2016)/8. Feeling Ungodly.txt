Heading death
Feeling ungodly
Searching for the melancholy
Time will tell
Whatâs to come?
Tear down the sky
Worship sun
Calling out to some holy host
Exercise my holy ghost
Dream within
Dream on the doubt
Donât ever let the dream die out
What went wrong before?
Was I hit this shit looking for loyalty
So.
Air your grievance..FUCK
Check it out
Itâs a charmed life
On the chopping block
Iâm gonna live until
I die
Check it out
Itâs a charmed life
On the chopping block
You better live until you die
Blood was spilt
Through the words that kill
There meant for you
So bet it all
War with wolves
A war of words
Meant for you
So bet it all
Calling out to some holy host
Exercise my holy ghost
Dream within
Dream on the doubt
Donât ever let the dream die!
What went wrong before?
Was I hit this shit looking for loyalty!
So..Air your grievance
FUCK!
Check it out
Itâs a charmed life
On the chopping block
Iâm gonna live until I die
Check it out
Itâs your charmed life
On the chopping block
You better live until you die
Yea~
On the chopping block your charmed life so live until you die
Charmed life is on the chopping block; itâs a charmed life
Iâm gonna live until I die
I got you out of my life
That was the dream,
Itâs your waking reality!
I got you out of my life,
Itâs your waking reality
You lose the fame!
You lose the fame!
Itâs a war with words
Call it like
I see it
The stench stains my veins!
Check it out
Itâs a charmed life
On the chopping block
Iâm gonna live until I die
Check it out
Itâs your charmed life
On the chopping block
You better live until you die
Yea~
On the chopping block your charmed life so live until you die
Charmed life is on the chopping block; itâs a charmed life
Iâm gonna live until I die
