East of the ancient sun
Beyond the valley of the corpses
I'll be waiting for you
Where all loss of hope is
No remorse
I spit on your corpse
Nothing left to do
But put my boot on you
I've got no remorse
Across the void
I shout your name
Not taken in vain
You took in vain
Through the millions of miles
The dead empty space
Through the vastness of the naked
Desert to bury your name

Sometimes it feels so lonely
Like the wind it blows right through me!

The truth is I never liked you this
Testimony is one of truth you're just
A means to an end
With no redeeming thing about you
Walk in my shoes
This dead empty space
Walk in my shoes
This burdens on you!

The day has eyes
The nights has ears
It seen my fears
You're gonna be the death of me
It's all downhill
Downhill from here I felt so shot,
So shot I lost my mind
Born of trouble into the breach
Empty promises

There just out of reach
East of the ancient sun
Beyond the valley of the corpses
I'll be waiting for you
Where there is no hope!

The truth is I never liked you
This testimony is one of truth
You're just a means to an end
With no redeeming thing about you
I bury the burden I bury the burden this burdens on you,
This dead empty space!

The truth is I never liked you
This testimony is one of truth
You're just a means to an end
With no redeeming thing about you
I bury the burden I bury the burden this burdens on you!
This burdens on you!
You live in dead empty space!
