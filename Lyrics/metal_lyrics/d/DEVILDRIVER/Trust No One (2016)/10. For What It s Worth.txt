Known to kick down doors
Settle old scores
Canât take anymore
Do what you canât ignore
My faith you did restore
Iâll cut this to the core
If they ask for more
They will get war!
I wake up every night
Scared
Iâm born to lose this fight
Donât cry
Dry your eyes
Hold your tears
No more fears!
For what itâs worth
I would move heaven and earth
Even kill at will
Be still this beating heart of mine!
This beating heart!
Red we had nothing
Fought for everything
This familyâs ours
Itâs
Fucking everything
My faith you did restore
Iâll cut this to the core
If they ask for more
They fucking get war!
I wake up every night
Scared
Iâm born to lose this fight
Donât cry
Dry your eyes
Hold your tears
Itâs
No more fears!
I wake up every night
Scared
Iâm born to lose this fight
Donât cry
Dry your eyes
Hold your tears
No more fears!
For what itâs worth
I would move heaven and earth
Even kill at will
Be still this beating heart of mine!
