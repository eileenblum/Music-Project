Desperate in your sadness
So wear black cloth, burningâ¦
Like a flame to a moth,
We flicker the heart,
And silence the sound, burningâ¦
Put all your dreams down,
Born into bondage,
Meant to scorch the sky,
By any means
Fucking hustle through life!
Iâve realized
Iâm not sorry anymore youâve poisoned the wine
And itâs my night sky!
I was beat down by a slow drug
Over the embers and through the flood!
Iâm
Built for the kill (itâs my nightâs sky)
The scars
Are not visible,
Was I even here at all
Born into bondage,
Meant to scorch the sky,
By any means
Fucking hustle through life!
Iâve realized
Iâm not sorry anymore youâve poisoned the wine
And itâs my night!
I was beat down by a slow drug
Over the embers and through the flood!
Iâm built for the kill (itâs my nightâs sky)
Be gone
Be gone
The ground moves and shakes
Be gone
Be gone
You live with your mistakes
Be gone be gone
Itâs between the
Devil and me
Be gone be gone
And forever hold your tongue!
Itâs my nightâs sky!
Iâm built for the kill (itâs my nightâs sky)
