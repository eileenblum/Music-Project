Never relent,
Throw yourself
Never relent
Through yourself to the future!
This blood moon
Begins with a guarantee
And mercury
It ends in retrograde!
Itâs just
Bleeding me dry
So donât even try to say goodbye,
Resentment, yes
I harbor some
So donât even try to say goodbye
This is
Not over now
Iâm far from down for the count
I hear it beckoning now
Iâm far from down
Come out
Full guns blazing
Iâll never forget
I may forgive tomorrow
Iâll never forget
The years of sorrow
This blood moon
Begins with a guarantee
And mercury
It ends in retrograde!
This time it ends in retrograde
I can hear it beckoning.
Iâm far from down for the count
Iâm far from down for the count
Come out full guns blazing
This is not over now
Iâm far from down for the count
I hear it beckoning now
Iâm far from down
Come out
Full guns blazing
Hell raising!
All guns blazing!
The powers at be
The faces of god
Are a one-way mirror
As we hover above
Mangled
Tangled
A one-way mirror as we hover above!
This is not over now
Iâm far from down for the count
Come out
Full guns blazing
This is not over now
Iâm far from down for the count
I hear it beckoning now
Am far from down
Come out
Full guns blazing,
Hellraising!
Never relent!
