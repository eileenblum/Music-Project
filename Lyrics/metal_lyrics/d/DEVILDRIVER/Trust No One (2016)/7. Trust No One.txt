Thereâs always a need for violence
Slowly singing to the somber sun,
Give my regards to the ones you call your angels
Dusted-
Iâm the only one
I need to deaden all my feelings
When it comes to you
And should you rise again
Iâll have no choice but follow through
I need to deaden all my feelings
Should you rise again
Iâll have no choice but follow through
If threatened just know
Iâll respond in kind
Say the word
The word is blind
If threatened just know
Iâll respond in kind
Say the word the word is attack!
Say your lamentations
Set sail for Hell or damnation
No honest words on your lips
Confronted, think quick!
Iâve used it
Iâve abused it
Itâs abused me
Itâs confused me
And consumed me
Iâve been destroyed by trust
My heart canât erase it
Now Iâm so fucking wasted
I can taste it
Iâve been destroyed by trust
Heard you say thereâs no need for violence
As you slowly sickening walk away
Give my regards to the ones you call your angels
Trusted-
Iâm the only one!
I need to deaden all my feelings
When it comes to you
And should you rise again
Iâll have no choice but to follow through
I need to deaden all my feelings
Should you rise again
Iâll have no choice but follow through
If threatened just know
Iâll respond in kind
Say the word
The word is blind
If threatened just know
Iâll respond in kind
Say the word the word is attack!
Say your lamentations
Set sail for hell or damnation
No honest words on your lips
Confronted, think quick!
Iâve used it
Iâve abused it
Itâs abused me
Itâs confused me
And consumed me
Iâve been destroyed by trust
My heart canât erase it
Now Iâm so fucking wasted
I can taste it
Iâve been destroyed by trust
Trust no one!
My heart canât erase it
Now Iâm so fucking wasted
I can taste it
Iâve been destroyed by trust
Iâve used it
Iâve abused it
Itâs abused me
Itâs confused me
And consumed me
Iâve been destroyed by trust
By trust
Trust no one
Trust no one
If you apologize, will it all, just go away
In my eyesâ¦ if you apologize?!
