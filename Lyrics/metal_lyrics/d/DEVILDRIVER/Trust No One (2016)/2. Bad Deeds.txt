It's ok
It'll all be fine
Just get your shit
Leave it all behind
Those faded doors
Just never mind
It's a waste of time
Way out of line
Media machine burned out
Turned out
Turn about the whereabouts
Like a heavy
Gonna lay it out
Listen
To the knockout!
Torture tactics
Drastic
Fucking plastic
So dramatic.
Tragic
Automatic
Overactive
Your antics
Just scratched it!

You deserve the noose!
You're a bad person
Bad deeds
Bad karma
Bad seed
Stay away from me
What will happen to the broken?
To the lonely
To the lost
To the forgotten
You're a bad person
Bad deeds
Bad karma
Bad seed
Stay away from me
What will happen to the broken?
To tire lonely
To the lost
To the forgotten
BAD SEED!
It's not ok
It'll never be fine
You got your shit
Left a stench behind
Those doors are closed
So never mind
You're a waste of time
Way out of line!
Media machine burn cut
Turned out
Turn about the whereabouts
Like a heavy
Gonna lay it out
Listen
To the knockout
Torture tactics
Drastic
Fucking plastic
So dramatic
Tragic
Automatic
Overactive
Your antics
Just scratched it!

You're a bad person
Bad deeds
Bad karma
Bad seed
Stay away from me
What will happen to the broken?
To the lonely
To the lost
To the forgotten
You're a bad person
Bad deeds
Bad karma
Bad seed
Stay away from me
To the lonely
To the lost
To the forgotten

Go against the grain
The challenges of change
The dying out will have their way
So damn few are here to stay!

Get lost
To find yourself!

You're a bad person
Bad deeds
Bad karma
Bad seed
Stay away from me
What will happen to the broken?
To the lonely
To the lost
To the forgotten

You're a bad person
Bad deeds
Bad karma
Bad seed
Stay away from me
What will happen to the broken?
To the lonely
To the lost
To the forgotten
BAD SEED!
