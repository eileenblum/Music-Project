Your sight for sore eyes,
Cannot see!
Those close to you
Donât know your device
Theyâll compromise
Theyâll pay the price
Itâs you
I despise!
Just eject
Nothing more to say
Just eject
Tired of wasting days
Just eject
Old feelings
Bending reason
Lasts for seasons
Just eject!
So Say goodbye
Next time make a short hello
This Retribution is just a stones throw!
Say wave goodbye
Next time make it a short hello
This Retribution is just a stones throw away!!!
Your motivation
I cannot see,
Your hostile feelings
Gone left unchecked,
Called to an old friend that never was
So fuck these feelings!
Just eject
Nothing more to say
Just eject
Tired of wasting days
Just eject
Old feelings
Bending reason
Lasts for seasons
Just eject!
So Say goodbye
Next time make a short hello
This Retribution is just a stones throw!
Say wave goodbye
Next time make a short hello
This Retribution is just a stones throw away!!!
Sugar skulls
Decompose
Under the softest sun
It makes you feel alive
With
Lucifer by your side
Follow me without doubt
Lucifer by our side
By our side
So
Say goodbye
Next time make a short hello
This Retribution is just a stones throw!
Say wave goodbye
Next time make a short hello
This Retribution is just a stones throw away!!!!
You feel alive with
Lucifer by your side
Iâve been to
Hell and back so follow me without doubt!
