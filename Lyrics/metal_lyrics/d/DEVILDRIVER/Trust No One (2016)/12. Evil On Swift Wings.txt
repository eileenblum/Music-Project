It boils down to
That I'm bored to tears
Bottom line is it ends right here!
Shot yourself
Cried short changed save your breath
So say what you will
Scrape the bottom
I've had my fill!
You've sold out
Sent packing
By yourself!

Entry
Into the empty
I have a tongue
Like a machete
So be ready!

I am
Evil on swift wings
That comes to punish all things
A whisper in a windstorm!

Soul's mine
'Cause you're so sick
You're sold down the river of Styx
Shot out
And shut down
Just a total let down
Blood boils
Bored to tears
Bottom line is it ends right here!

Exit
Into the empty
I have a tongue
Like a machete
So be ready!

I am
Evil on swift wings
That comes to punish all things
A whisper in a windstorm!
I am
Evil on swift wings
Echoes in the trees
Voices in the leaves
That carry!

Got swept up
God knows now
Got swept up and taken
I'm good as polished gold

For every reason
There's a season
Face up to the facts
4 by 2
I'm leaving you
Foul play
No longer fair play
It's just a reality
4 by 2
I'm leaving you
Face up to the facts
There's no last minute turning back
Figure the flag is down
And you're not
Holier than thou!

I am
Evil on swift wings
That comes to punish all things
A whisper in a windstorm!
I am
Evil on swift wings
Echoes in the trees
Voices in the leaves
That carry!

I... am EVIL!
On swift wings, on swift wings!
I am EVIL!

You better face up to the fucking facts
There's no last minute turning back
Figure this fucking flag is down
You better face the facts
Evil on swift wings
