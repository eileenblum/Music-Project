Doomed from the start it broke my heart!
Demented thoughts eclipsing timeâ¦
Now that part of me is cast aside
So long, goodbye, Itâs conquer and divide.

She wears her horns just like a sacred crownâ¦
Thereâs no current strong enough to even hold her down..
All I ask of you is fucking where youâve been?!
No doubt out hiding the bodies again, again!
Every time I ask you whatâs up,
Iâm constantly, constantly under cut!

Born to Burn
Say what You will
Its taking its toll
Youâre Caringâs Overkill
Born to Burn
Say what You will
Its taking its toll
Youâre Caringâs Overkill
Youâre Caringâs Overkill
Watched it Slip Downhill

Sometimes it takes a good fall, all in all
To know exactly where you stand!
Youâre hanging from the skin of your teeth
So do just what you can!

My ears canât believe what they cannot hear,
My eyes are blinded from what they cannot see,
It drags me down, drags me down!
My burden to bare, nothing matters but the rain,
these pills that eventually keep me sane.
The pain I feel the battles won,
Phoenix wings embrace the sun!

Your caring isâ¦ Your caring is... Overkill!
