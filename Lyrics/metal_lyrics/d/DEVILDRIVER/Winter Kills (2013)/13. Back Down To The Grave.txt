[Deluxe Digibook Edition Bonus Track]Ruin is the way!
So vicious is your gaze.
It puts men down in their coffins early!

Haunted by a memory of time wasted by you
Wasted by me.
Thoughts of what was meant to be!
By the way,
Ruin is the way.
So vicious it...

...makes them suffer!
Fucking run for cover!
Youâre good from far but far from
Good intentions
Never learned those lessons!
You need confession now!

Itâs irrelevant
Just what you want
Take it!

Back down to the grave,
Just admit itâs not your day
Youâre filthy as a thought to see
Outstretched in memory
Back down to the grave
Just admit you canât be saved
Youâre filthy as a memory
Outstretched for all to see

Youâre a superstar of dysfunction!
Itâs a miracle that you function!
Gonna put you in a coffin early, so early!
Haunted by the way it was.
It ended because you...

...made me suffer
Fucking run for cover!
Youâre good from far but far from
Good intentions
Never learned those lessons!
You need confession now!

Itâs irrelevant
Just what you want
Take it!

Back down to the grave,
Just admit itâs not your day
Youâre filthy as a thought to see
Outstretched in memory
Back down to the grave
Just admit you canât be saved
Youâre filthy as a memory
Outstretched for all to see

Just make your move
Itâs much better than
Being a marked man

[Solo]

It makes them suffer
Iâll make it out of this place
If I donât make it out alive
At least theyâll hear my cries, hear my cries

Itâs irrelevant
Just what you want
Take it!

Back down to the grave,
Just admit itâs not your day
Youâre filthy as a thought to see
Outstretched in memory
Back down to the grave
Just admit you canât be saved
Youâre filthy as a memory
Outstretched for all to see

Makes them suffer
Fucking run for cover!
Youâre good from far but far from
Makes me suffer

Makes me suffer
Makes me suffer
Makes me suffer
Back down to the grave
