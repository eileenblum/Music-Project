Holy water wonât help you now
Here I lie, when it promised me death
On my last breath!
So show some backbone.

Keep a bad dog with you and the others wonât bite!
Damn whatâs done
Itâs been done already
Keep it steady!
Here I come and hell is coming with me!
Heart is black body is blue,
Nights Iâve empathized drowning with you!
You raise up!
My cup!
Defeat does not exist!

Desperate times
Call for desperate measures.
Go ahead and pour that gasoline!
Desperate times
Call for desperate measures.
Nothingâs certain but the unforeseen
If you think Iâll bend.
Youâre sadly mistake!
Desperate times
Call for desperate measures!

Because I could not stop for death
It kindly stopped for me!
The carnage held but just ourselves
Alongside rode immortalityâ¦
You tend to choose your poison,
Here I lie when it promised me death on my last breath!

Defeat does not exist!
Desperate times
Call for desperate measures.
Desperate!
