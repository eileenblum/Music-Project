[Verse 1:]
Aaaah!
Ugh!
Dealer, dealer, dealer, dealer, dealer
Dealer of destruction
The Shogun of sorrow
The merchant of doom
Accomplice to anyone

[Pre-Chorus:]
The fact is fear will fuck you up
So drain your cup
And take another down
A chilling portrait of the way we were
Promised mercy, but delivered destruction

[Chorus:]
Cross my heart
Despite the odds and all your facades
Iâm consumed by gods
Iâll see you in blood, left for dead
Face down in mud, fuck you Iâm ruthless
Despite the odds, left for dead
Face in the mud Iâm fucking ruthless

[Verse 2:]
Damn the deceiver, the ancient of evils
Youâll come to cower
In front of the will for power

[Pre-Chorus:]
The fact is fear will fuck you up
So drain your cup
And take another down
A chilling portrait of the way we were
Promised mercy, but delivered destruction
Cross my heart

[Chorus:]
Cross my heart
Despite the odds and all your facades
Iâm consumed by gods
Iâll see you in blood, left for dead
Face down in mud, fuck you Iâm ruthless
Despite the odds, left for dead
Face in the mud, fuck you Iâm ruthless

Look what youâve done to me
Now with candle light I pray
Love is not the law
Underneath the harvest moon

The dealer of destruction
The Shogun of sorrow
The merchant of doom
Accomplice to anyone

[Pre-Chorus:]
The fact is fear will fuck you up
So drain your cup
And take another down
A chilling portrait of the way we were
Promised mercy, but delivered destruction

[Chorus:]
Cross my heart
Despite the odds and all your facades
Iâm consumed by gods
Iâll see you in blood, left for dead
Face down in mud, fuck you Iâm ruthless
Fuck you Iâm ruthless
Left for dead fuck you Iâm ruthless
Left for dead
