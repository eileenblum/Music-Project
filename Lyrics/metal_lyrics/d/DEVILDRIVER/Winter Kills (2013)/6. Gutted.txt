Take it back, you better take it back!
Fall time season youâve got darken hearts across the veil
So dim the bright lights.
Damned if you do,
Damned if you donât
Donât rest or youâll give up your nine lives.

Burning bright between the wastes and the stars.
No matter how you call it,
Youâve never done me a solid.
You mind is weaker,
So you fell hook line and sinker.
Itâs a mess, I donât know what to call it.
There must be some kind of compromise.
Take it back!
Confused, conflicted, justified.
Better burn then turn choose your allies.
Heavy is the cost,
Donât speak of love thatâs lost.
In my eyes youâre a sacrifice.
Hell bent on the outcome of the dice.
GUTTED, Fucking Gutted! Youâre gutted!

Death smiled.
Covered up your past.
So you do your best not to flaunt it, BITCH!
Thereâs nothing left but broken dreams and it seems
Thatâs the way you want it.

Gutted, Youâre gutted!

Take it back you betterâ¦
Take it back
Take it.
