In these depths of desperate despair,
We bring down judgment from the sky with prayers!
I drank till the waters turned whiskey rye,
I drank till the waters run dry!

Don't be the one to come knocking at my door,
Hell no, I won't pick you up off the floor!
Don't come here with blood in your filthy mouth,
I wasn't there when the deal went south!

You sold me out
I sold myself in,
I picked up the claw!
You dealt me out,
I dealt myself in!
And love in not the law!
Not the law!

[Chorus:]
Black moon
The omen is here!
Darkness looms!
There's fear the end could come too soon
Pale as a ghost. What you see? What you know?
Time to enlist the oath of the abyss!
Black moon,
The omen is here
Darkness looms,
Miss the fear
Pale as a ghost. What you see? What you know?
Time to enlist the oath of the abyss

Fuck your rapture, can't you see it's never coming!
So better watch where you place the blame, place the blame!
You left me on the inside scarred!
You're digging up the corpses, digging up graves!

Don't be the one to come knocking at my door!
Hell no, I won't pick you up off the floor!
Don't come here with blood in your filthy mouth,
I wasn't there when the deal went south!

[Chorus]
Black moon
The omen is here!
Darkness looms!
There's fear the end could come too soon
Pale as a ghost. What you see? What you know?
Time to enlist the oath of the abyss!
Black moon,
The omen is here
Darkness looms,
Taste the fear
Pale as a ghost. What you see? What you know?
Time to enlist the oath of the abyss

[2x]
Take the oath, the oath of the abyss
Take the oath, it's time to enlist!

Time to enlist!

Take the oath, the oath of the abyss
Take the oath, it's time to enlist!

[Chorus]
