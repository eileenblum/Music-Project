All you heard was the cry of the crone.
Those words bite and leave scars.
Even now the temple awaits you

Those thoughts wonât take you far.
Youâre no good so others scatter
Turn your back to others laughter
Between the pillars itâs all misfortune.
Under the guise, in the name of Luna
Get a life.
I canât get a word in edgewise.
Give me a hand, give it a rest.
Now you criticize, all bets are off.

Gimme the might,
Gimmie the inside insight.
Tell me the right way to ignite this night.
I see your memory in every face.
Itâs just a haunting refrain.

When the screams all have the same name.
Disconnected, you fall to you name.
Between the pillars itsâ all misfortune.
Under the guise, in the name of Luna
Tried to persuade me that all of my troubles were blessings,
And tried to persuade me that all of my blessings were trouble.
Trouble, goddamn trouble!

A haunting refrain,
A haunting refrain.
