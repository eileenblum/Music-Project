He who hesitates is lost, against the grain, no matter the ocst.
Many hands make light work
Youâll get cut short with my words!
In the end you know a pilot in the storm,
Hope you die well
Its fucking farewell.
The chip on your shoulder looks heavy as Hell.
I hope youâre blackballed
Youâre fucking stonewalled

You thumb your nose at all youâve learned.
Just turn you back as bridges burn.

In my heart Iâm a war
Tripping over these tombstones
In my heart Iâm at war
I keep tripping over these tombstones

Itâs your fucking final hour.
Iâve laid out my tattered heart.
Into the blinding light.
To avoid the dark
What did I fall into?
Iâm through,
Youâve skewed the view.
Sometimes salvation ainât but a door awayâ¦ from you.

Thereâs no saving grace, weâre at a crossroads
You donât know, you donât know me at all, know me at all.

Fucking Farewell
This is war.
Fucking farewell.
Fucking Farewell.
