No one can see him
No hands can help him
Sand's his only friend
In this desert land

He knows the path's long
But he has to be strong
Got no food, no beverage
And he can't find a trace

He's in the middle of nowhere
He moves himself to another place
Hopeful to find another face

The visions in his head...
The hot sun makes him mad
As he's walking 'cross the sands
Now he thinks it never ends...

He thinks it can't get any worse
But he feels a sand storm will approach
He watches vultures 'bove his head
Waiting to feed on his flesh...

His strenght has been drained
He fell almost slain
Lying down on his grave
He lost the hope of being saved

No one could see him
No hands could help him
He could not return home
He knows he won't last long

He's in the middle of nowhere
He moves himself to another place
Where everything's glory and grace

After all, he has been saved...
