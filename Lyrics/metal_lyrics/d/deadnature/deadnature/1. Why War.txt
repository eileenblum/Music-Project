We fight in the air
We fight in the sea
We fight everywhere
Anytime to be free

More tears will be shed
More blood will be spilled
Again enemies
Clash in the battlefield

But we just want to live in peace
Just try to hear our silent scream

The warriors fight
With all their might
Taking lives away
Fathers die
And children cry
Now we pray:

No more wars
that's what we beg to you,
Oh Lord
It's enough
There's no more prayers that give us hope

Die, Ripped by my rage
Feel it with blame
We're soldiers of wretched fate
Living to kill
Killing for due
We're convict to pay eternal doom

We're back from the fields
Mate corpses we see
Got scars on our faces
This dirty war gift

Our country's destroyed
Our best friends are gone
No time left to cry
The war still rages on

Can we believe in life indeed
If we just see misery?

The warriors fight
With all their might
Taking lives away
More fathers die
And children cry
Now we pray:
