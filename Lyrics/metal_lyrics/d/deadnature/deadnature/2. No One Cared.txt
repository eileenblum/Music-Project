The street's on fire, buildings are blowing away
Sea waves getting higher and higher in the town's bay
Out of control, people play deadly games
Total madness, we can't call these things by names

We don't understand what is happening here
Crowd getting crazy, no matter how far or near
Thousands years ago, it came wild, now it's back again
Madness' alive, all nations freaks still remain

... No one cared!

A crime twister gathers on every city slum
Out of nowhere bullets crossing the air
Fireballs coming from the burning red sky
Killing the poor, the rich and every friend of mine

The ground is crumbling to pieces and bleeding it shows
Plagues and Diseases, which nobody knows
Inside our heads, intelligence depleted by some kind of drain
Love turns to hate, men and women filled with pain

... No one cared!

The anarchy we warrant, it's part of us
Resisting is worthless, just accept our thoughts
Idleness we deliver, it's supplied by ourselves
