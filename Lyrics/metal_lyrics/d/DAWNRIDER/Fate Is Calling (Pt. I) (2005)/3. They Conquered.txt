[Meriad]
Look at the tower, it stopped shining in the moon
Look at the castle, it is overwhelmed with doom
We lost our freedom as the dark horde came to our land
They covered it with darkness, with the fire of the damned

[Jossorian]
They killed my loved ones, my family is dead
And now my heart has dried out, it is black and filled with hate
My life is useless if I don't seek revenge
I must fulfill my duty and kill the murdering men

[Jossorian]
No need to look ahead
All of my family's dead

[Meriad]
YOU'RE MY GUARDIAN ANGEL
THE KINGDOM WHERE I WAS BORN
AND NOW YOU'RE GONE....
THEY CONQUERED THE LAND I LOVE

[Jossorian]
I shall get out of here as soon as possible
I know I'm not a soldier but I don't care at all
Sons of Riandria, help me with my revenge
I must fulfill my duty to kill the murdering men

[Meriad]
I hate to say to you
There's nothing you can possibly do

[Meriad]
YOU'RE MY GUARDIAN ANGEL
THE KINGDOM WHERE I WAS BORN
AND NOW YOU'RE GONE....
THEY CONQUERED THE LAND I LOVE

[Meriad]
My friend now you are gone
Our destiny now became one

[Meriad]
THEY CAME FROM THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS
THE RIVERS ARE FILLED WITH BLOOD
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE...
TO THE LAND THAT I BELONG
