[Delyra]
I'm sent to you from the eternal wide sky
To tell you that your fate is calling tonight

[Meriad]
Why did you choose me? I'm still young and not strong
So you can't help, my hope is already gone

[Delyra]
Can't you hear the calling? The chains are falling
Your blood is the one of a hero
Your heart's desire can take you higher
To fulfill the will of the gods

[Delyra]
FATE IS CALLING
AND IT CALLS FOREVER
FATE IS CALLING
GET YOUR HEART TOGETHER
[Meriad]
FATE IS CALLING
CAN IT BREAK MY SORROW?
FATE IS CALLING
THERE IS NO TOMORROW

[Meriad]
Is that true, that I am more than I thought
My heritage is really given by gods?

[Delyra]
Your father was a man of honor and strength
And all these values are inside you my friend

[Meriad]
I have heard the calling, the chains are falling
Is there a destiny for me?
My land was conquered and I must free it
That is what you're telling me?

[Delyra]
FATE IS CALLING
AND IT CALLS FOREVER
FATE IS CALLING
GET YOUR HEART TOGETHER
[Meriad]
FATE IS CALLING
CAN IT BREAK MY SORROW?
FATE IS CALLING
THERE IS NO TOMORROW
