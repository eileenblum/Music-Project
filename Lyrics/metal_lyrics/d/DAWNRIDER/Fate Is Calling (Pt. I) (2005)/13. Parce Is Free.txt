[Delyra]
The back has faded from the sky
But it is not gone

[Meriad]
Parce is free and strong again
The battle's still not won

[Kerodet]
I lost the castle, I lost some men
But you can't defeat me at all
[Meriad]
Forever my journey will be...
Parce is free

[Delyra]
THESE WALLS ARE FREE, A SACRED PROPHECY
THE ONE IS SENT, BRING LIGHT BACK TO THE LAND
DEFEAT THE BLACK, I KNOW IT WILL COME BACK
BUT TODAY YOU ALL CAN CELEBRATE ITS FALL
PARCE IS FREE!

[Meriad]
I became the sacred son, the first task is fulfilled
But in the morning I'll go on, there's so much blood to be spilled

[Kerodet]
I shall return with an evil force
Which you can't imagine you fool
[Meriad]
It is my own destiny...
Parce is free

[Delyra]
THESE WALLS ARE FREE, A SACRED PROPHECY
THE ONE IS SENT, BRING LIGHT BACK TO THE LAND
DEFEAT THE BLACK, I KNOW IT WILL COME BACK
BUT TODAY YOU ALL CAN CELEBRATE ITS FALL
PARCE IS FREE!
