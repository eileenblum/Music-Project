[Gregory]
The troopers are standing
Our freedom we're demanding
The fire is rising
For our land we're riding

[Gregory]
Out of the shadows they came
Evil is in their blood
Giving us sorrow and pain
Don't let them come!

[Meriad]
WE'RE TROOPERS, BELIEVERS
BORN AS ONE, LET FREEDOM LEAD US
THE SPIRIT IS IN OUR BLOOD
AND THAT MEANS A LOT
IF WE FALL, OUR PEOPLE
WILL BE SLAVES OR KILLED BY EVIL
RIANDRA IS BLESSED WITH LIGHT
WHEN OUR TROOPS UNITE

[Gregory]
The forces are fighting
Like if the gods sent lightning
My soldiers are waiting
There will be no debating

[Gregory]
Out of the shadows they came
Evil is in their blood
Giving us sorrow and pain
Don't let them come!

[Meriad]
WE'RE TROOPERS, BELIEVERS
BORN AS ONE, LET FREEDOM LEAD US
THE SPIRIT IS IN OUR BLOOD
AND THAT MEANS A LOT
IF WE FALL, OUR PEOPLE
WILL BE SLAVES OR KILLED BY EVIL
RIANDRA IS BLESSED WITH LIGHT
WHEN OUR TROOPS UNITE
