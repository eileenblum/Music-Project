[Relwud]
You are chosen, the son of the night
Praised by the eternal flame of the light
By the magic of the unbroken seal
You entered my world, you've seen the unreal

[Relwud]
I my dreams I knew you would come
The prophecy, Riandrian son

[Relwud]
THE MOONLIGHT SHINES ON US
YOUR FATE IS GLORIOUS
DAWNRIDER HEAR THE CALL
THIS WORLD SHALL NOT FALL

[Meriad]
I've got the magic, the force of the gods
The spirit was strengthened, true power I've got
[Relwud]
Up here in the mountains I feel the storm
The winds tells the message: Dawnrider reborn!

[Relwud]
I my dreams I knew you would come
The prophecy, Riandrian son

[Relwud]
THE MOONLIGHT SHINES ON US
YOUR FATE IS GLORIOUS
DAWNRIDER HEAR THE CALL
THIS WORLD SHALL NOT FALL

[Relwud]
FOREVER FREE AND WILD
THE CHOSEN SACRED CHILD
THE BALANCE NOW IS SET
SO LEAD YOUR ATTACK
