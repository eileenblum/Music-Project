[Feriatus]
Hiding here behind that tree, I know the way he comes
The daylight is my enemy, the darkness is my home

[Meriad]
I know there's someone near the path, I feel the evil's here
I can see a shadow there and I can smell his fear

[Feriatus]
Has he seen me? Is it possible at all?
That must be magic, no, it can not, can not be...

[Feriatus]
ASSASSIN'S HERE
ASSASSIN'S HERE
HE READS MY MIND
THE CHOSEN CHILD, THE RUMOR'S RIGHT

[Meriad]
Get out assassin, only the weak hides in the dark
An honorable man should know that pride comes from the heart

[Feriatus]
My mission was to kill you, Riandrian warrior
Now that you have seen me we'll fight under the stars

[Feriatus]
Now steel will meet and I know that some blood will flow
Your life will fade, forgotten you will be, you will be...

[Feriatus]
ASSASSIN'S HERE
ASSASSIN'S HERE
HE READS MY MIND
THE CHOSEN CHILD, THE RUMOR'S RIGHT
