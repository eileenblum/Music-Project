[Kurasark]
High in the sky near the starlights
Eternity's all you can feel
Down on the earth there is black night
But only the dark breaks the seal

[Kurasark]
Follower, go for your duty
There's no more to learn from me

[Kurasark]
THIS IS YOUR FINAL CALL, WAIT FOR THE NIGHT
GO ON THE MOUNTAIN HIGH, FREE ALL YOUR MIND
NEAR THE ETERNAL SKY YOU'LL FEEL THE SPELL
THE TRIAL IS THEN FULFILLED AND WE CAN SAY FAREWELL

[Kurasark]
As we say goodbye, darkness is falling
The horde must be stopped by your hands
Forever my friend, hear the calling
Riandrian pride can't be damned

[Kurasark]
Follower, go for your duty
There's no more to learn from me

[Kurasark]
THIS IS YOUR FINAL CALL, WAIT FOR THE NIGHT
GO ON THE MOUNTAIN HIGH, FREE ALL YOUR MIND
NEAR THE ETERNAL SKY YOU'LL FEEL THE SPELL
THE TRIAL IS THEN FULFILLED AND WE CAN SAY FAREWELL

[Meriad]
What shall I do up there? Is there a sign?
I will fulfill my task, I know it's time
[Kurasark]
The gods will talk to you, a symbol shall come
I know you are ready now, Riandrian son

[Kurasark]
THIS IS YOUR FINAL CALL, WAIT FOR THE NIGHT
GO ON THE MOUNTAIN HIGH, FREE ALL YOUR MIND
NEAR THE ETERNAL SKY YOU'LL FEEL THE SPELL
THE TRIAL IS THEN FULFILLED AND WE CAN SAY FAREWELL
