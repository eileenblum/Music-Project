[Meriad]
Guardian of the unbroken hope
My master has sent me to fulfill the oath
[Guardian]
For centuries the gate has been closed
Only the chosen can enter these halls

[Guardian]
When moonlight is darkened by storm
High on these mountains dawnrider's reborn
[Meriad]
I know I'm ready to go
Into the fire

[Meriad]
Freedom and hope are my guide
To fight all the evil which came over night
[Guardian]
I'm feeling the spirit in you
I'll ask you the question, one answer is true

[Guardian]
When answered correctly my friend
The gate will be opened for you to be sent
To the place where the earth meets the sky
You'll become the sacred rider

[Guardian]
WHEN THUNDER IS CALLING, THERE'S NO TIME TO WAIT
FOR AGES I'M STANDING
I'M GUARDING THE GATE
[Meriad]
THERE'S ONLY ONE QUESTION, SO PROUD AND SO GREAT
MY HEART IS NOT FALLING
GUARDING THE GATE

[Guardian]
One word is the answer to the question I'll ask
This words is the power to fulfill your task
The word is much stronger than evil or hate
So what is the answer?
[Meriad]
The answer is fate!

[Guardian]
You answered correctly my friend
The gate now is open for you to be sent
To the place where the earth meets the sky
You'll become the sacred rider

[Guardian]
WHEN THUNDER IS CALLING, THERE'S NO TIME TO WAIT
FOR AGES I'M STANDING
I'M GUARDING THE GATE
[Meriad]
THERE'S ONLY ONE QUESTION, SO PROUD AND SO GREAT
MY HEART IS NOT FALLING
GUARDING THE GATE
