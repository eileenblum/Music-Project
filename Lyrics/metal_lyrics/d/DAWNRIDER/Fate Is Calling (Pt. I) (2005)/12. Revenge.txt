[Drotor]
Get down on the ground and kneel
Eat dust, hear my laughter
I'll spit on your face you worm
Before I'll bring you to my master

[Meriad]
Hold your tongue before I rip it out
I have come to sned you downward
Jossorian will wait for you
He will pulverize your blak heart

[Drotor]
Onward, faster! Come to me, feel the blade!
Bastard, coward! Riandrian life must fade!

[Drotor]
NOW THE DARKNESS COMES INTO THIS HALL
LET THE LORD OF THE DAMNED BE THE ONE
YOUR BELIEF IN THE OLD WORLD, TAKE IT TO THE GRAVE
NOW THE DARK WILL REIGN IN THESE DAYS

[Meriad]
As we're fighting on Riandrian ground
I know the gods are always with me
Feel the blade and hear that magic sound
When it pounds into your body
[Drotor]
I see the blood, it's floating out of me
Before my eyes the black is lying
By the lord where are you taking me?
Can't you just leave me me dying?

[Meriad]
Downwrad to the Imrad you will be sent
[Drotor]
No, you bastard, don't send me to your friend

[Drotor]
NOW THE DARKNESS COMES INTO THIS HALL
LET THE LORD OF THE DAMNED BE THE ONE
YOUR BELIEF IN THE OLD WORLD, TAKE IT TO THE GRAVE
NOW THE DARK WILL REIGN IN THESE DAYS
