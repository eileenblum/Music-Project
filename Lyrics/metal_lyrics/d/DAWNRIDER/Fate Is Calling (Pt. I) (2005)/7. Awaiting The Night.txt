[Meriad]
High on the top of the mountain
I look in eternal sky
I seek for magic desire
My master said I must here inside
Where can I find  what I search for?
I close my eyes and feel the ancient
Now I can feel what I aimed for
No more despair and no more inner lies

[Meriad]
I feel the magic
I know that the secret was sealed
I see my fate now
Now my own world is revealed and I am their child

[Meriad]
I'M AWAITING THE NIGHT
I'M AWAITING THE NIGHT
I'M AWAITING THE NIGHT
