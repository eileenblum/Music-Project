[Selias]
Out of these walls I seek the one
Bring back our freedom we have lost so long
[Meriad]
I heard your call, I'm on the way
And I shall give you back the better days

[Selias]
I'm calling, we're standing alone
Riandria's hope's nearly gone, we're alone

[Selias]
DAWNRIDER
WE NEED YOUR HELPING HAND
DAWNRIDER
BRING JUSTICE TO THE LAND
[Meriad]
DAWNRIDER
THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE RAIN
DAWNRIDER
NO MORE FEAR AND NO MORE PAIN

[Meriad]
For many years I have been trained
The power and true wisdom I have gained
[Selias]
I know the prophecy is true
That is the reason I believe in you

[Selias]
I'm calling, we're standing alone
Riandria's hope's nearly gone, we're alone

[Selias]
DAWNRIDER
WE NEED YOUR HELPING HAND
DAWNRIDER
BRING JUSTICE TO THE LAND
[Meriad]
DAWNRIDER
THE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE RAIN
DAWNRIDER
NO MORE FEAR AND NO MORE PAIN
