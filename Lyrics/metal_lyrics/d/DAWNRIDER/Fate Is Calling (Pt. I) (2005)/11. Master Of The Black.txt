[Pendras]
I caught you for a reason
My master wanted you
Now I will bring you to him
And I know what he will do
He could break your neckbone
In seconds you would die
But I think you must suffer for
A hundred bloody nights

[Pendras]
He will reward the deeds I did for the dark
He will slaughter you when we are back

[Pendras]
MASTER OF THE BLACK
HE'S THE ONLY ONE OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD
MASTER OF THE BLACK
[Meriad]
THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE WON
BUT IN THE END I WILL ATTACK
MASTER OF THE BLACK

[Meriad]
You don't know that I could break these rotten chains
But bring me to your master so I can seek revenge
[Pendras]
I don't know why you're laughing, maybe you're insane
Your name will be forgotten when the darkest lord will reign

[Pendras]
He will reward the deeds I did for the dark
He will slaughter you when we are back

[Pendras]
MASTER OF THE BLACK
HE'S THE ONLY ONE OF THE LIVING AND THE DEAD
MASTER OF THE BLACK
[Meriad]
THEY THINK THAT THEY HAVE WON
BUT IN THE END I WILL ATTACK
MASTER OF THE BLACK

[Kerodet]
He will bring you to my hands and I will be your master then
Your body will be burnt in flames, you will feel eternal pain
Darkness will be in your eyes when you come into the reich
Let demons take your heart away, forever night, there's no more day
The spirit of your tortured soul will never get out of my hall
Your flesh will rot in poisoned rain but your sorrow shall remain
Dawnrider, you are bound to die, no more tricks which you could try
There's nothing more to do, you're damned, but why are you laughing then?
