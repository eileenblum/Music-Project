I can hear him sharpening his blade
I can hear him dragging the tool of his trade

The phantom vision
The audible taunt
The apparition
Perpetual haunt

The wraith, the wraith
O, the arbiter of obsession, the messenger of faith

The phantom vision
The audible taunt
The apparition
Perpetual haunt
The circumcision
Undeniable want
Without permission
Spiritually gaunt

The wraith, the wraith
O, the arbiter of obsession, the messenger of faith

One body
Two souls

Purgatorial uncertainty
Surrounding mirrors of deceit
If he is me, then I am he
Illusion shrouded by this spectral sea
Murderous stranger of mercy
Suicidal by proximity
Hard to breathe, harder to eat
When Iâve got so many mouths to feed

O, wraith
Sharpen your blade (O, wraith)
Menacing display
O, wraith
