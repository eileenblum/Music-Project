Father, am I too blind to see?
Father, have you forsaken me?
Father, am I too blind to see
Father, how youâve forsaken me?

Caked in blood and soiled in dirt
Am I the rat king?
Crucified for blessing the earth
Am I truly the rat king?

(What kingdom is this?)

Navigate the maze, become lost in gutterâs own
This cannot be my domain; there must be more than what is shown
Knotted tails and broken teeth adorn the throne
I cannot inherit this disdain, this mountainous sin to be atoned

Caked in blood and soiled in dirt
Am I the rat king?
Crucified for blessing the earth
Am I truly the rat king?

I heal the wounded and the violently ill
I am the rat king
I wear the crown, I lead the march upon the hill
I am the rat king (so crucify me now)

Kneel before the lord of filth
I am the rat king (so crucify me)
Bow your head and swallow your swill
I am the rat king (so crucify me now)
Pray until your patience rivals your will
I am the rat king (so crucify me)
Those who worship are suffering still
I am the rat king
