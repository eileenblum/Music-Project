Time, irrelevant
Space, subservient
The three dimensional detriment
Bows down in obedience

The muted implosion of our human constructs we hold so dear
The deafening silence of indignant tongues too prideful to rest on their own

I seek the calm (I seek the nonpoint)
I bear no gifts, I bring no tidings of peace
I seek the calm (I seek the nonpoint)
I bear no gifts, I pray my troubles may cease

The infinite void roars in absolution

I seek the calm (I seek the nonpoint)
I bear no gifts, I lay my arms at your feet in humility

Minds oblivious
Trace the obvious
The fifth dimension obscured by incompetence
Loosen your steadfast grip on your negligence

Heat invisible in intensity, burning with the voracity of countless suns
Chaos immeasurable in terms of our current understanding of the universe around us
Conditions never fathomed by even our greatest minds
The gargantuan nonpoint compresses all into nothing
Beyond the inner horizon lies the gateway to salvation
