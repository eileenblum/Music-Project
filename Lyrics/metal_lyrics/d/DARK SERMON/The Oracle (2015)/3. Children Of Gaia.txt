Children of Gaia, mired in obfuscation

Will the veil ever be lifted?
Or will we continue to search in the dark?
We meet the truth weâve been gifted
With a skepticâs eye and a cynical heart

Who are we but the children of Gaia?
Who are we but the sons and daughters of life?

Make right our minds, make clear the path (Who are we, who are we?)
That we may see our final task (Who are we, who are we?)
Who are we but the children of Gaia?
Who are we?

We, the children of Gaia, surrender to the divine
We must steady our hands and open our ears to end the divide

What is this gospel that you preach?
Who fed you lies?
Who fed you the lies that you teach?

The word not obscured as you claim
The intent not absurd as you feign
You wear the coat that bears the stain
Yet you know truth, speak not its name

Make right our minds, make clear the path (Who are we, who are we?)
That we may see our final task (Who are we, who are we?)
We, the children of Gaia, surrender to the divine
We must steady our hands and open our ears to end the divide

End the divide
