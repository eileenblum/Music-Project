(What is a soul worth? To me? It doesnât matter. I am no God. I know what I did. I killed. I killed because I was called to. I did what was asked of me. I regret nothing. I feel nothing. I feel nothing.)

Lashes slap calloused skin
But they are no match for the burn within

If given the chance, Iâd kill again
No restraint for the guilty man

I refuse to believe the myth of sanity
I demand my reprieve from your reality
I know what I did, I followed the signs
The consequences haunting me are seen by the blind
I carry the burden, the burden of proof
The burden of murder, the burden ofâ¦

Truth be told, Iâm centuries old
A life by the knife is a life in the hole

If given the chance, Iâd kill again

I know I should feel something
But all I feel is nothing
But all Iâve felt was nothing all my lifeâ¦ nothing all my life

When the reaper lies dead and buried
Who will come to harvest your soul?
The executioner sleeps beneath the soil
We are all born from sin
Spare me your pleas of innocence
We are all murderers waiting to be hung

No one is beautiful
No one is pure
No one is innocent and
No one is safe

We are all murderers waiting to be hung
No one is innocent and no one is safe
