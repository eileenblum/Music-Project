Serpent of infinity, the infinite snake
Scales upon scales and waves in its wake
Monolithic obelisk entwined in figure eight
Cold-blooded treachery stands guard at the gate

I will find the open wound

As above, so below
Contort and harden, painful and ever slow
As below, so above
The torturous snake constricts the captured dove

As above, so below
Little heed to warnings, no softening of the blow
As below, so above
We both know this is the only way up

And yet you work the needle without an eye

âI would rather eat myself than allow you to pass
I, the swallower of the future, the devourer of the past
I am the harrowing fear you swore would never last
Forever are you entombed in the shadow you castâ

Walk forever
And now you walk (on) forever

You work the needle without an eye
But I will find the open wound
