Allow

Set fire to the earthly shell
And from the ashes I will rise again
Do away with the prison cell
Bestow freedom on the soul within

The black widow spins not her web, but her prey
Tangled and at the whim of a goddessâ array

We train our eyes to the skies
Our prayers are hers to deny
We train our eyes to the skies
Our prayers are hers to deny

Behold! Widow!
Accept! Fate!

You must behold the black widow, accept your fate
I must behold the black widow, and accept my fate
You must behold the black widow, accept your fate
I must behold the black widow, and accept my fate
Behold! Widow!
Accept! Fate!
