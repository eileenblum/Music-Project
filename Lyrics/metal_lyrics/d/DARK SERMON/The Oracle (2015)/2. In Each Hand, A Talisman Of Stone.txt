Can I transcribe?
In only darkness, in the absence of light, I transcribe

But I am merely a drop in this sea of dissent
But I am merely a crack in the wall of eons of human resentment

Into the crevasses of ignorance we fall (yet again)
We must ascend to the highest dimension of all
(We must ascend to the highest dimension of all)

Can I transcribe?

I, your humble servant, tasked with translation
I, the usher of evolution in the midst of this abomination
I, your humble servant, must eliminate fear and hesitation 
As I am thrown into the abyss

Thrown into the abyss

Into the abyss I am thrown
The darkest place Iâve ever known
In each of my hands, a talisman of sacred stone
At long last, I carve truth in human bone

Only in darkness is there illumination
The listless and blind will now see
I need no chorus, no congregation
Into the abyss I am set free

Into the abyss I am set free
