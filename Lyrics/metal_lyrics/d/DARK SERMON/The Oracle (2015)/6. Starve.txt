Your matted fur matches the scars in your pelt
You cling to meat as if it's life itself

Barking and foaming (Bow to me)
You deserve to be hungry (Bow to...)

Protruding ribs and coiled paws
Mark the beginning of your lifetime of loss

Your eyes scream out because they've long been lost
You feel an inkling of the pain you've caused
Tongue out in pant demonstrating exhaust
Your legs give out before you carry your cross

Starve! Starve! It's the embrace of emaciation!

On your knees, you beg to eat
I decline with certainty
At my feet, you pick your teeth
I decline with certainty

You feel an inkling of the pain you've caused
Your legs give out before you carry your cross

You, you, you
You, you bit the hand that feeds

Now starve! Starve!
Starve to death
