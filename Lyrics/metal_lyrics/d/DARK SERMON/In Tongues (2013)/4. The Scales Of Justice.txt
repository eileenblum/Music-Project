I want to burn disgust
Into the heart of every man
I will uproot the tree of life
From the soil of the holy land
I want to desecrate
Everything pure
I will tear down the walls of the chapels
That promised the troubled a cure

You swine, you filthy race of heathens and bastards
You deserve only the most cruel and torturous of fates
I will single-handedly bring about the demise of this wretched planet
You call your home

I want to do things to this earth
That would make the sky
Swallow itself in fear
I want to make the world regret (Regret)
I want to make the world regret (Regret)

I want to force shards of broken glass
Down society's throat
I want to watch the world I've come to know
Writhe and choke
I want to do things to this earth
That would make the sun freeze over in misery

This is my threat
To all of mankind
This is the day of judgement
May you be left behind

The world will suffer
At the hands of the chosen one

Never before have the kingdoms of Heaven and Earth witnessed such violence,
Such force, such swift justice
The entire human race will kneel and weep and beg for
His mercy
But He will ignore their pleas and slaughter them all
