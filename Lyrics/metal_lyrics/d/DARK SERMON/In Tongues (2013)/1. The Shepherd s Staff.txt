White my tongue, spitting forth the blood of the angels as they weep and moan
I know this is the devil's work
The Sheppard's staff holds more in faith than any sheep alone
I know this is the devil's work
Tie my idle hands so they may never sin again
The darkest of sermons is preached to an unwilling crowd of men on their knees
Muttering false words of praise
To an unloving glorified entity
I will endure the gnashing of teeth
I will wade through the depths of despair and endless suffering
I pray to avert my ears but it seems  that no one is listening 
Abandoned by god, my purpose is clear
I exist to rid the earth of every trace of the living
Possessed by the reigning king of falsehood and resentment
Driven to exterminate all that breathes
Possessed by the reigning king of falsehood and resentment
If this is his will, and god stands still...
This child of hell shall force its home upon the earth
I witness its unfortunate birth
Tie my idle hands so they may never sin again
Cut out my lying tongue and remove these thoughts within
Possessed by the reigning king of falsehood and resentment
Driven to exterminate all that breathes
Possessed by the reigning king of falsehood and resentment
If this is his will, and god stands still...
Possessed by the reigning king of falsehood and resentment
If this is his will, and god stands still...
My life was never meant to be
