They eyes of the heavenly father rest heavily upon my chest
I can feel their judging gaze piercing through my flesh
I stab at my reflection hoping to end it all
I don't recognize the man that I see, but from what I can recall
I have lived a life of shame and self-disgust
The eyes of the heavenly father rest heavily upon my soul
I hate myself and the things that I've done 
And the life I've been forced to endure(forced to endure)
I abhor the man I've become
These hands have carried out the evilest of deeds
This mind has been occupied and demonized by an entity that this earth has never seen
On my innocence it feed
Through the fire and brimstone it leads
I reflect on the years of my life with great disdain
I cant claim a life of virtue 
Myself I'd sooner maim
I refuse to walk on
Continue broken and bent
I feel remorse for the life that I've lived
All I can do is repent
For he carries with him pestilence and famine
For restitution I plead(repent)
For restitution I plead
Repent
