And all I see are flaws
In the ones I claim to love
My heart is as cold and dead
As the eyes watching me from above

This cruel world emptied me out
Then buried what was left
Hollow and broken
A sinner like the rest

My body is falling apart
And my mind is even worse
I can't keep living this
My existence is a curse

God is laughing
I can hear it in my sleep
Black spills from these wounds
He carves so deep

Trial and tribulations
Have worn me thin
No body, just brittle bones
Crudely wrapped in tattered skin

And in my head
Is a voice that says
I'm a waste of life (I'm a waste of life)
I'm better off dead
And in my head
Is a voice that says
I'm a waste of life (I'm a waste of life)
I'm better off dead

I am a waste of life
I'm better off dead
I am a waste of life
I'm better off dead

But I'm as dead as I'll ever be
But I'm as dead as I'll ever be
