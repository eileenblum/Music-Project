We are the false prophets,
The kings of sin.
We will rest when your Mother Earth is barren.

Hounds from Hell.

We are the final judgement,
The divine apocalypse.
We will rest when your Mother Earth
Slits her wrists.

Arise, from the ashes of Hell be born!
For her lies, let her soul from flesh be torn.

We bathe her in desolation,
For she deserves to rot.
She tied the noose herself,
We just tightened the knot.

We watch as the earth goes up in flames,
Destruction courses through our veins!

We are the nameless demons,
The hounds from Hell.

We watch as the earth goes up in flames,
Destruction courses through our veins!

We are the hounds
Lapping up the blood of an innocent world.

An innocent world

Hounds, hounds from hell!
