I wish I could be blind to the evils of this world
But one cannot unlearn the truth

One cannot erase the accounts of the damned
The tales of corrupted youth
These images are burned into my brain
Of the sick, the dark, and depraved
When the time comes to claim the dead
Not a single soul will be saved

You each have played your part in this
Piece by piece, you wore her away
She is no longer a loving mother
We inhabit a cold shell
A rotten carcass

Maggots squirm and eat away
At what remains of a formerly fruitful harvest
Her hair, no longer vibrant and soft
Now dry and knotted and weak
Her skin, now as pale as the moon
Whose tears roll down her cheek

You have caused this tragedy
This untimely end of a beautiful life
Undeserving swine
You wretched race
You murderous heathens of malice and spite

A clean slate will restore her beauty
A lifeless world is a world of worth
A clean slate will restore her beauty
A lifeless world is a world of worth

I am the pale horse, and he who rode upon it
I am the plague that will cleanse the earth
