I drag behind me a rope
So laden with sorrow
That I can barely take another step
Without falling to my knees

I drag it in the dirt
My feet kick up dust as my rope settles it
I seek no answers
Only peace

In the distance
There is a single tree
Salvation
The rope must meet the branch
The rope must meet the branch

I have traveled from afar
I am weary, but I must keep my pace
The rope must meet the branch
In the same way it has met my neck

I will earn my death
I will earn my death
I will earn my death

You cannot deny me the right to take my own life
I will earn my death
I refuse to be robbed of my own suicide
