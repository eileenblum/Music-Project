The hands of my mistakes
Claw at my eyes and mouth
They won't let me go
And they never will

The more I struggle
The deeper I sink
Into this sea of writhing blackness
I am filled with spite
For me and only me
I wish death upon
Only the man in the mirror

I wish I could take back
Every year I've lived
Every choice I've made

The more I struggle
The deeper I sink
Into this sea of writhing blackness
Their putrid limbs
Slither around me
I am entangled in their wretched grip

I curse my life (I curse my life)
With every breath that I breathe (Breath that I breathe)
I curse my life (I curse my life)
With every word that I speak (Word that I speak)

I am cursed, I am damned
Cursed
Damned
Cursed
Damned
I am cursed, I am damned

I have made my home here
Among the dead
I have made my home here
Among the dead (Dead)
I have made my home here
Among the-
We've been waiting for you
Where have you been
I have made my home here
Among the dead
