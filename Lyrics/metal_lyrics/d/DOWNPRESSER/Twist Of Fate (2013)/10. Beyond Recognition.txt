Feel free to lay the blame on me, I can take the weight
Don't apologize, never compromise, you are what you create
Victim of consequence, too late to turn it around
Prisoner of your own devices, heavy lies the crown

They say fortune favors the brave
There's more at stake than your soul to save
Final confession, an act of despair
The punishment is more than you can bear

It's a force of habit, you gotta have it, or so I'm told
I couldn't sit back and watch if my life was spiraling out of control

Go ahead, follow where you're led, that's fine by me
Walk tall through the halls of perdition, misery loves company
King of everything you see with your eyes sewn shut
No redemption for the heathen heart, shit out of luck no matter what

Fortune favors the brave
There's more at stake than your soul to save

Sit back, let it fall away
Turn the page, throw it all away
Thus always to the wicked
Soul sick beyond recognition.
