Forget everything you see
Everything you heard about me
I've been way below down
I've been way beyond out
The voices that you hear
Like poison in your ear
They're calling out your name
Choosing how you play the game

It's a crying shame
You believe the things they say
It doesn't matter anyway
Because you're just the same

Forget everything you know
Everything that you've been told
You were born to swallow lies
You live to sever ties
No more pretending to care
I've done that, I've been there
Look out for number one
Get it through your head, I'm done

When the truth comes crashing, excuses run thin
The proof is the passion burning within
Devil may care, but he won't win
Think that you do, but you have no clue what's happening

When they pull your card, you'll know that you were wrong all along.
