In the eyes of the pure I see the other side
Refused to hide my pride, I laid it on the line
Now I'm faced with what I couldn't embrace
Too little too late, nothing but a sour taste

I said my prayers to god, so he answered me
Gave me what I wanted, not what I needed
Turned away from the light, every day's darker
With each line I write, the heart grows harder

So what do I do
With the promises I made
So what do I do
Do I shine or do I fade?
So what do I do
In my ways I'm set
Wait and see what I do
I'm not finished yet

Trust in no one and no one will trust in you
Failed the test
Tried, not fucking true
Locked up in four chambers till the blood runs out
Bound and gagged with your foot in your mouth

Smoke it down to the filter
Like a slap in the face
It's been a long time coming
Gone without a trace

I know the night is young
But I feel so old
Cold air fills my lungs
I'm almost home

So what do I do
With the promises I made
So what do I do
Do I shine or do I fade?
So what do I do
In my ways I'm set
Wait and see what I do
I'm not finished yet

Benefit of the doubt, you sold me out
Enemy of my enemy, sight unseen
No use coming clean

Unsuspected, standing corrected
Disbelief suspended.
