The jury's still out on you
Time to face the music
Shouldn't be much longer now
The whispering, I know you heard it
Say I make you miserable, that's a two-way street
If you want to make this a pissing contest, you know I've got you beat

A rusty key in a broken lock
You shouldn't act so shocked
Call me a goddamn son of a bitch
Told you to think about it, baby

Taking stairs two at a time
Taking steps without reason, without rhyme
Follow my heart's twisted paths
Bleeding fast, how long will I last?

Slice me open, stitch me up
Pour salt deep in the cut
Flatlined, you gave up
Dead on arrival, open and shut

Second chance, third and fourth
This is my last resort
I trusted, you're busted
Seized by the hand of justice
I trusted, you're busted
Case closed.
