Saw the path laid out for you
Turned away from what they wanted you to do
Cast out, still hurting
Some lessons aren't worth learning
Never bought it, never believed
They laughed, called you naÃ¯ve
You clenched your jaw, you clenched your fists
No choice but to resist

You define, you define the bloodline
Born out of the scorn of mankind
We define, we define the bloodline
They don't matter, pay don't mind

For years you hid your face
Too low to fall from grace
Clinging to a scrap of faith
Hoping someone out there relates
You've seen the weakness devour
You've watched them leech our power
Eaters of consciousness
Shut them down, show them we resist

When to stop, when to keep trying
When to talk, when to keep silent
When to laugh it off when you're not smiling
Common sense
You're one of a kind, no denying
If they say you're not, they're lying
Still standing back to back
Steadfast, built to outlast

Don't need an end to justify the means
This is where I'll be through ups and downs and in-betweens
I swear this oath 'til I'm resting in the earth
The bloodline, we define, the last shall be the first.
