Into the unknown
By myself but not alone
Caught up with ghosts I'm chasing
Running out of time I'm wasting
This dog will have his day

Peace of mind you left behind
You'll never get it like that, turn back
Retribution, persecution
You'll never get it like that

A safe bet's no bet at all
You're not on top if you're scared to fall
Breathe deep, take a leap with me
See what I see

Holding out for what can never be
A casualty of the worldwide misery
Peel back the skin to bone
Release the fear that you've never shown

Mercy on judgment
When the hour strikes
Mercy on judgment
At the time of sacrifice

Eating the bread of sorrow, drinking the wine of greed
I've forsaken tomorrow just to watch the guilty as they bleed.
