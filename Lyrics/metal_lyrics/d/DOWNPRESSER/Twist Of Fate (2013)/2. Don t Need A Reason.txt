Don't need a reason to feel like I do
Don't need a reason, but I've still got a few
Don't need a reason, don't need advice
From trash in the gutter on the road to paradise

I carry grudges that are older than time
The burden breaks my back, leaves me blind and paralyzed
Forgiveness is a virtue and pride is a sin
But neither one has saved me from the mess I'm in

Corrupted institutions
With violent solutions
Revel in agony and moral decline
War without terms
Food for the worms
Things are just fine

I owe a debt that I can never repay
A sacred allegiance I can never betray
I've stumbled and I've fallen but I will not stray
Don't need a reason to scream for a change

Hand over fist
Blissful ignorance
When the train runs off the tracks
How else should I react?

I'm not a victim but I'm not a crook
Don't give me a reason or a second look.
