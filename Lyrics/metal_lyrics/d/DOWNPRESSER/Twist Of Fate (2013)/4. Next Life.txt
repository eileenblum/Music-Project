Tried killing the pain, but the pain killed you
You played god so god played you
So much that you'd been through
So much I could but didn't do

Hard days or the easy way out
Made your choice without a doubt
Found faith at the end of a rope
Too late for me to help you cope
It's still a hard pill to swallow
I can't lead, but I won't follow
Locked in with the rank and file
Don't need an inch, don't want a mile

Reaching out, I let you down
Couldn't get a grip, you hit the ground
It's darkest before the dawn
But you couldn't see the light, and now you're gone

Got lost in your head, it's on the headstone in black and white
I guess I'll see you in the next life

You had it rough, such bad luck
You were tough but not tough enough
Tired of scheming, tired of believing
It ain't fair but fair's just a feeling
Fools die but the wise die too
You died young, what does that make you?
A raw deal, you played your hand
I'll carry on, for you I can.
