Another stagnation, sucking up caffeine energy
Another frustration, time's ticking by the tap of fingers
Helpless infuriation, no space to hurry in this obstacle chase
Another stagnation, of passionate dreams unfulfilled today

The 'Hermit' laughs again
Unable to resign
While senseless systems hibernate
Worshiping his own

Disorder, disorder, anonymous lumbering companies
Functions dysfunctional, completely lost, isolated world

1 step forward in the fast lane
2 steps back in autonomy
3 little prayers for control
4 no results

Techno stress, techno stress
Take no, Take no stress !
Techno Stress
Out of Order, balance, control
Take no, Take No Stress
Take No Stress

Astronomical waste

Another stagnation, sucking up caffeine energy
Another frustration, time's ticking by the tap of fingers
Helpless infuriation, no space to hurry in this obstacle race
Forever Stagnation! John Hermit he laughs hahahahaaa
