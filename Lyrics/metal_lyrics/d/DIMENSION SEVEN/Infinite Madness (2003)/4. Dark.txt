Am I to blame for this?
You owe me! you owe me!!!!!!!!
Apologize!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I despise I disgust
My self destructive lust
Afraid to die
Begging to turn the Tide

Being served like a whore
I stick in, I adore
My fantasies
Are all this empty

Take away the sorrow and sadness
Take away the pain

Let me be

Am I to blame for this?
You owe me! you owe me!!!!!!!!
Apologize!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Take away the sorrow and sadness
Take away the pain
No way out
