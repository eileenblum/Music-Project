This is not just another love song

Get up!
Sleepwalk Guillotine
Jet lagged quarantine
Out of routine
Don't go and never know
Time's now, face it!
Show me spirit
Don't shut your eyes like I am night

I feel nothing of your bloodline love
I feel nothing
Nothing
No love

Get up!
I need to talk to you
Mr. who are you
Mystery
Become my legend
Understand it
Non comprende
Extra hard and you laugh about it

I feel nothing of thy bloodline love
I feel nothing
Nothing
No love

Trembling, close to you, in my dream
Why? Why? Why?

Between the emotion and response
Falls the essence of our existence
You can't even remember my name
You can't remember my name
You can't remember

Get up!
Bloodsucker bloodfucker
Single feelings never heal
Carved is the mind! Caricature!
On the wall, dad crowned, dad throned
On the wall, dad crowned, dad throned, dad is all
And that's all!
