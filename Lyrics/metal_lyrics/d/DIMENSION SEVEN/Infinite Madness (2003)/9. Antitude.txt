I burn flags of hell
I spit on that statue
From now on your lies will be denied

Wwwwhhhhaaaaarrrrggghh consumer whores
Companies can't buy my faith
Despite your greed, your lies will be denied

As Not just an anti-critic
I fight your repression of dissent
From now on your lies will be denied

No more blame no more quick buck
Materialism, idealism, fuck off!
Your lies will be set right

Weaken the innocent
Makes you forget guilt
Brutal control, your lies will be denied

Stop your blood for blood for blood mentality
In this global chaos, be denied

Power for all the people
Fuck off!!

ANTITUDE
ANTI!!!!!!!!!!

I burn the flag of hell
I spit on your statue
From now on your lies will be denied

Compromise no option.
Antitude my new tool

ANTITUDE
ANTI!!!!!!!!!!
