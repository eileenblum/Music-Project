It's time to choose
If you're not with us
You're against u.s.

Gonna hunt them down
Gonna smoke them out of their holes
And shoot to kill

Your news is propaganda
Your money equals truth
In your first world

A fake democracy decides what is right
To oppose is a crime
I want to hear the other side

On your knees!
Want to learn to hate?
On your knees!
Can you taste the hate?

While the big leader speaks
Western people yet again agree
your supremacy

Bayonnetting the wounded
Bringing them your justice
Cheers! Mr. Tough Guy
Still bombs keep falling down

Revolt!!!

On your knees!
Want to learn to hate?
On your knees!
Can you taste the hate?
Want to learn hate?
