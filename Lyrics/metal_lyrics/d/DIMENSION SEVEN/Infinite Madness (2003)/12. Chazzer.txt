Real friends, you were my pal, brother of blood, hell yeah!!
Journeys together, in a smog filled universe, never alone, No way!!
Sharing secrets, Staying loyal, nothing to divide our ways
We grew up, we grew older, those were the days

But now the times have changed .And you know what?

You know what a chazzer is?
That's a pig that don't fly straight!!

Confided and still you lied, no longer on the same side
Was it a deal with the devil? Trust is not a step to reach a higher level
Not a tool of convenience, not a tool, no way
To hell with our fire, liar, FIRE! Liar!

The times have changed...
you know what !!!!

You know what a chazzer is?
That's a pig that don't fly straight!!
Pig piggy pig pig Not straight
You're that pig that don't fly straight
Hate

Figured you out
Don't chazz me
Your ego hit the roof
Not for me
I am strong and free
Believe me
You were a waste of my time

Chazzer
