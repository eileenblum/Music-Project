Hey!!

Go mould your fuckin clay
Mould your puppet
your pride bullshit
An obsession is so pragmatic, so what?
I won't take it anymore
Your worthless temptation
I interfere to provoke your frustration
I won't take it anymore
Fuck your lies

I eye my eyes
I deny your eye, your way

Mommy you're infected by a prophet
Who tells you what you feel &amp; what you think
Get out of it!
What has been has been
Your regime
I don't give a fuck about this decadent relationship
Fuck, Fuck your frustration
I don't give a fuck about your loyalty

I eye my eyes
I deny your eye, your way
Fuck off!

I, I found my way...
My own goddamn way

I eye my eyes
I deny your eye
I deny your way
