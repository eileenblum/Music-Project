Glory be to the father, And to the sun and to the holy spirit
As it was in the beginning is now, And ever shall be world without end. 
Amen.

Life is a grabbag, a game, a disease, apparently innocent
Cold society demo-crazy killed with malice aforethought
652, our life never the same, Disgusting cunt, Murderer murderer murderer 
Psychopath

Jesus Jesus where are thee ?? Amen !!

Angst in eyes in a once promised land 1 enigma split the camps
In Intolerance, violence &amp; amorality,
One minute silence, Crimes suffocates us inwards
Democracy, Liberty, Enemy Enemy Enemy

Life Grab back! Life Grab back! Life Grab back! Grab Life back!
