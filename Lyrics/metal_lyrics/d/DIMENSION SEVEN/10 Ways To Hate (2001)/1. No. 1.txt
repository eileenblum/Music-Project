The world is mine
I get what I want
Cause I seize my chances

You fucka with me, you fuck with the best
You fight with the best, you die like the rest

There is nothing you can do to me
Me I am the No. 1

I got balls
So I improve
I stay hungry
To burn you cockroach

Me I want what's coming to me
It is the world and everything in it
As a master of the Universe
As opium for the crowd
My seed is the key to make you bend down

Bend down for me!

I take what's mine!
