What's up I said

He confused his son and daughter
He forgot about the doctor's orders

No: non-fullfillment of appointments
Not: again that childhood to come
No : no signs that frighten
Don't keep telling nothing's wrong

He forgot but he said no
He denied me you know

No longer driven by ambitions
Slowly spinning mystery
I a circle losing visions
Watching you rejecting me

Why don't you tell me what's up?
What's up, tell me what's up!!
