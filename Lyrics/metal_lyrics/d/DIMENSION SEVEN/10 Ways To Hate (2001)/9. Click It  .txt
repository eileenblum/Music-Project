All information, all overloaded
We're all overloaded everyday
I've got to be on time again
I've got to bomb that crashes in
I lost myself that's why I quit

Information makes me rage
It's the reason for all my complaints

Hey: what's your complaint...
Hey: are you insane...
Hey: stop your posing
And your bucking

Click it!! Man!!

All one grey race: all think one way
You all think one way every day
Do!!! And don't talk back
Give!!! More than you get
It's not fair what you took from me

All my freedom taken from me
Like I'm a number without a name

Don't try to push me
Into your system
It makes me nervous, it makes me sick
And rage so deal with it!
Deal with me! Don't break me! Don't push me in!
It makes me nervous, click it!!!
And rage so take my shit

Click! Rage! Sick! Nervous!
Deal with me!!!
