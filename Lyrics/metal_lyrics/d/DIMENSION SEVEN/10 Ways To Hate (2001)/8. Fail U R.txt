You give a finger and I'll cut off your hand
It's so fucking simple even you can understand

What is your lifetime? What is your life?

I hold my own... I'll use all my leisure
To feel the heat on my back so I can feel the failure...

Failure!
Don't you stare at me, come on play with me!!!
I want to feel failure

I feel the disappointment, it gives me energy
Since they've tried to kick me down I expanded my self-esteem

You are always complaining...

What the fuck are you complaining about?

What is your life?
