Talking about this and that, I heard you say it is your head
What's wrong? Do I speak dead? One word, it hurts that some things are hard 
to get

Come on get down
Get back to the ground
You can't fake you can not float when I come around... No...

What about your life, speak the truth and don't tell lies
You only criticize... But nevermind take your time
To your god's smile, go on live your dream I won't pay your price

You can't tear me down
You can't rule this town

I blindfold you, I blindfold you anyway

Get back to the ground
Get back get down
Get back to the ground
Get back come on down!
