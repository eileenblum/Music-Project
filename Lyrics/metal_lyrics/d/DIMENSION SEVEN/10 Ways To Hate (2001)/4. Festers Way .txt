Fear breeds envy, fear breeds jealousy, fear breeds fear
Fear breeds envy, fear breeds jealousy, fear breeds hate!
Your hate! No way!

Anti, but I got style, what's yours fat ass?
Playing my friend off against me! I don't understand you
My sincerity's bigger than your envy, it's yours to swallow this bitter 
pill!

The pill is bitter in relative's mouth
The pill is bitter in your mouth! ha ha!! Gotcha!!

Still it's bitter, still it's bitter still
The pill is bitter in your mouth

TRY TO LIVE IT FESTERS WAY

Behind my back! So low! You think I don't know?
Again you are surrounded, yes I found it yeah
You made a big mistake, I won't take.. Your package with emotional baggage 
fed my will

I won't rest until you've died...
DIE!!
