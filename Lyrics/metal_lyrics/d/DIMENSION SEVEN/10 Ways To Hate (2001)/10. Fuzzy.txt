Be direct - Don't turn around
Be clear - Don't pull my leg
Action causes trouble
Wrong interpretations are a fact

It's all your fault
Lying shows no respect

Years of lies and broken beliefs
Made me to the man I am
Do I hate you? Yes I do!!
Yes I do!!

It's all your fault
I want to get rid of you

You you look so perfect
You you are so sick

You say it's OK but I don't know
You say I'm OK but I don't want you in my way

You you look so perfect
You you are so sick

You look perfect
You are SICK!!!
