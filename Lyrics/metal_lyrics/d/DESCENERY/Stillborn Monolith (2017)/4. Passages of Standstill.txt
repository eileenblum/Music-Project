Why should I try to find a place
In your empire of certain ways
Where everything may be predicted

The opaque sphere is where you are
Oh, but how could it go this far
And now your calmness is afflicted

Hurling every dream of yours to landfill
You are sick of being alive
Falling through the passages of standstill
You don't let your goals survive

You wear the crowns of uselessness
You live being tired of your own breath
Inaction is your only treasure

Illogic rules your universe
You're looking for another source
Of devastating kind of pleasure

Hurling every dream of yours to landfill
You are sick of being alive
Falling through the passages of standstill
You don't let your goals survive
Worrying 'bout the senseless things you wonder
Will it ever finally end
Crawling through the days being torn asunder
You don't want a helping hand

[Solo: Dag Swano]

In opportunity is your disease
Procrastination is what you're in alliance with
And when the perfect moment is forever gone
It's time to grumble, yeah, that you didn't know

Hurling every dream of yours to landfill
You are sick of being alive
Falling through the passages of standstill
You don't let your goals survive
Worrying 'bout the senseless things you wonder
Will it ever finally end
Crawling through the days being torn asunder
You don't want a helping hand
