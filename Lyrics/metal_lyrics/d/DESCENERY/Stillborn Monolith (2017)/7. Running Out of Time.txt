You're trapped inside your own illusion
You are sure you're right on track
Your mind is open for confusion
Your sanity begins to crack

Being a part of ever-changing system
You contrive to stay the same
Wasting hours of your existence
You are sure it's not your blame

Eternal wait is not a thing you negate
You prefer inaction to the climb
You aberrate 'til the moment it's too late
And then you are running out of time

You're looking for another reason
To defer your hour to act
And it takes a lot of seasons
To find out another fact

You imitate embodiment of timeliness
Day after day
You procreate and satisfy your selfishness
You're on your way
