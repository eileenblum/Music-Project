Feels like it's getting colder
Just like the winter night
When all the words are told
Killing is justified
The evening sun is dying
The night enslaves the day
The peaceful times are crying
It's so unsafe to stay

Stillborn is this monolith
Built up and dismantled here
I just don't want to stay at the same old point
Where the void is waiting for me

The void is calling for me
There is no longer safety here

I never thought I'd let it fall
Into the chasm of the broken goals
I let the silence fill the hall
Of burning fortress
To hear the dawning call

Stillborn is this monolith
Built up and dismantled here
I just don't want to stay at the same old point
Where the void is waiting for me

[Solo: Ragnar Widerberg]

Behold, the funeral has begun
Though murder still remains undone
The prey is caught, the axe is brought
The cease of life is here
But mourning tears are not

Stillborn is this monolith
Built up and dismantled here
I just don't want to stay at the same old point
Where the void is waiting for me
Shelter is the different place
Nothing is to keep me here
I am heading for the another day
Where the dawn is waiting for me
