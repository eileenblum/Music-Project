If there's a part for me in this
Where do I begin?
Will I roam forever 'til the ties that bind grow thin?

My story, can it make its way?
Can I outsmart the world itself?
My questions - neither end or answers
Where's the deepest I delve?

There once I picked a road
Killed it with my feet
There once I picked a road
That was already complete

I learn from the waves
I learn from the eyes, the human frailty
And what is the etiquette
Of having all the toil unsung?
A life resembling an impressionistic painting
A life of life
I've begun

And something crucial is cast off
It's a loss to be made for
Stars lead but don't guarantee to reach
The golden shore

The best of me - all written, and gotten, and denied
Now, I think I found the rhythm - and no one by my side

I learn from the waves
I learn from the eyes, the human frailty
And what is the etiquette
Of having all the toil unsung?
A life resembling an impressionistic painting
A life of life
I've begun
