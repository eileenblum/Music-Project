Freed of misconception and decline
I greet separation, drawing different line
I have arrived to take away your kingship one more time
Drained, exhausted, desolated lands are mine

In silence you shall drown
I'm here to get your crown
Your time has gone, you're obsolete
Your lifetime is complete
A relic from the past
Presented to the dust
We shared a hell, we've got it through
Divided I won't let you...

...hide, cause I know where your secret shelter lies
As its architect I've been there many times
The things alive to you don't matter anything to me at all
Let me in and I will stop your agony

In violence you shall fall
I'm here to get your throne
Your time has gone, you're obsolete
Your trophy is a defeat
A relic from the past
Presented to the dust
Your death won't be in vain
Divided I won't let you slip away

In silence you shall drown
I'm here to get your crown
Your time has gone, you're obsolete
Your lifetime is complete
A relic from the past
Presented to the dust
We shared a hell, we've got it through
Divided I will prove that

In violence you shall fall
I'm here to get your throne
Your time has gone, you're obsolete
Your trophy is a defeat
A relic from the past
Presented to the dust
Your death won't be in vain
Divided I won't let you slip away
