How does it feel
To be alive but never sense it
To stop the wheel
Of progress to rotate it back
All that you need
Is to fuck up the place you rot in
I'll never be
A part of your revolting show

I'll never feel a wish to see
This world through the eyes of yours
You better stay away from me
I don't need to hear your words
I'll never want you to decide
What I should do to feel alright
Why don't you go to hell?
It's time for you to step aside

I won't join your selfish crowd
Spread your shit without me
If you're here to fuck around,
Don't be sure that one day you will get
Another chance to live the life
You tend to waste and throw away
Keep drowning in your empty strife
I'm not a part of that, no way

Behind the wall
Of so-called joys you try to feel good
Nothing at all
Can satisfy your trite desires
Out of control
Your mind makes thoughts you have to fulfill
What is your goal
For which you sacrifice your life

I'll never feel a wish to see
This world through the eyes of yours
You better stay away from me
I don't need to hear your words
I'll never want you to decide
What I should do to feel alright
Why don't you go to hell?
It's time for you to step aside

I won't join your selfish crowd
Spread your shit without me
If you're here to fuck around,
Don't be sure that one day you will get
Another chance to live the life
You tend to waste and throw away
Keep drowning in your empty strife
I'm not a part of that, no way

Fuck yourself, it should be over
I am tired of you and your ideas
Don't waste my time, it's over
I don't want to drown in your abyss
