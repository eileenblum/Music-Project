Fire and brimstone hail from the skies
A scorched earth lay beneath the dead
Storms of embers burn the wings of angels
Igniting before their dying god

Divine messengers sentenced to a blazing holocaust
The blood line between man and deity
Systematically vanquished
The heavens ablaze in a deep orange
Mass cremation of the holy progeny

Smoldering cadavers litter the landscape
The dying left choking on their brethren's
Cremated remains

Rapture burning deep into their flesh
Followers of the cross witness obliteration
Before their eyes

Erupting in flames
Robes melt into swollen flesh
Onto a burning, dying Eden

Eradication of an ancient species of angels
The final apocalypse is arising
Total war waged

Fire and brimstone hail from the skies
A scorched earth lay beneath the dead
Storms of embers burn the wings of angels
Igniting before their dying god

Smoldering cadavers litter the landscape
The dying left choking on their brethren's
Cremated remains
