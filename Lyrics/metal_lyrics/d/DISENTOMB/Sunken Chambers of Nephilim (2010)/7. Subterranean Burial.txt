Congregation of the buried
Lay beneath the filth of humanity
Given unto god to with what he will
The wrath of faith has been demonstrated

Candles flicker light in the darkness
Sarcophagus drowned in prayers
Holy communion in the presence of their god

A sacrifice presented, one marked for burial
In this subterranean chamber his screams will serenade
Lowered into the pit
The soil begins to consume
Echoes spread through the architecture of the tomb. 

Submerged in earth
Subterranean burial

A cycle which will only end in disgust

Stench of sacrifice creeps throughout the crypt, scripture laden walls engraved with lacerations 
Given unto god to do with what he will

Congregation of the buried
Lay beneath the filth of humanity
Given unto god to with what he will
The wrath of faith has been demonstrated

A cycle which will only end in disgust
