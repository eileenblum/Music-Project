Thee devil shall roam the earth
And plague and terror shall reign
Upon the world of man
Heaven shattered
Destruction of angels shall commence

From his mighty seat the great one shall be cast down
Impaled and defiled, his throne upon the pyre
Inflamed with the seeds of misery
The immortal blood will be spilt
And the dark underworld will be unleashed

A feeble prayer to failing deities
To the ancient evil nothing is sacred
A once powerful ruler, now a helpless whelp
Bowing down before the eternal demon Roots rising

From the dank earth piercing through the
Savior's skin upwards from the pit of despair
And into our realm

Tendrils writhing within the fallen king
Constricting him to his rotting throne
Pillars of thorns burst from the ruins of his empire
Lacerating his weak flesh
Impaling him on his cathedra of grotesque ries

A feeble prayer to failing deities
To the ancient evil nothing is sacred
A once powerful ruler, now a helpless whelp
Bowing down before the eternal demon Roots rising

Spearing internal organs
Suspended and suffering
Skewered through his decrepit icon of power
Impaled upon the throne

Ascension of the original beast
