Devouring the flesh of Christ
Suspended in the air
On his symbol of suffering

Engorging on thou saviors body
Abandoned, forsaken by his father
A carcass hanging
Infestations of the rot

Upon the mountain of Golgotha
Masticating on the Divine
His apostles mourn beneath me
Speaking in tongues
I ravage the torso
Of Jesus of Nazareth

Mary shall weep
Her tears bring no end
A final prayer is uttered
As I feast on the lord and savior
Jesus Christ

Devouring the flesh of Christ
Suspended in the air
On his symbol of suffering

Sent here to interfere with prophecy
Sent here to consume the holy
Suspended on his symbol of suffering

A declaration of war against all that is holy
Devouring the flesh of Christ
Suspended in the air on his symbol of suffering

Battle of the profane and sacred
Battle of the profane
