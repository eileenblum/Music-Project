Monuments erected within the skies
Welcoming the underworld
Mourners gather from across the lands
Their world will be drenched in embers

Evil incarnate, Nephilim called upon
By the destroyer to do his bidding
Bursting from beneath the earth
Ancient giants have arisen
From the catacombs formed before antiquity
Cracks spread through the earth
Revealing the origins of the beasts
Disrupting the balance

The cursed spawn rivers of sanguine
Preparation of this dimension
The ascendence of pure evil
The rise of a tide that won't subside

The incarnate of death
Feeding off the blood of angels
That has dripped into his subterranean crypt
Erupting from the surface

For eons they lay dormant
Surrounded by tombs of rock
Existing in exile since the great flood
Banished under the soil

Monuments erected within the skies
Welcoming the underworld
Mourners gather from across the lands
Their world will be drenched in embers

For eons they lay dormant
Surrounded by tombs of rock
Existing in exile since the great flood
Banished under the soil
