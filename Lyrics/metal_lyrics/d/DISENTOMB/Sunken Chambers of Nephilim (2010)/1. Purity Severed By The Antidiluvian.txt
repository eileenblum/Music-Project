Hell vomited forth it's reeking gorge upon the earth,
Swarming from the bowels of plague
The ancient enemy, devourer of light
Spreading wings encrusted with the blood of angels,
Reborn into reality
Here to sever the pure from a deity

Shredding the wings of grace
Disembowelment of the hallowed

The divine lay in piles
Entrails scattered
Begging to die

Ancient curses enforced upon the earth
Seeking only to desecrate holy messengers
Dismemberment of the followers of light and purity
Liquidation of the Royal Family
That bow to the crown of thorns
Demonic upheaval leads to the suffering
And death of the angelic
Purity severed by the antediluvian 

Hell vomited forth it's reeking gorge upon the Earth

Amputating torsos
Pyres built on the severed wings of angels
Rituals designed to desecrate the dead
Antique evil resurrected to
Mutilate the apostles

The divine lay in piles
Entrails scattered
Begging to die
