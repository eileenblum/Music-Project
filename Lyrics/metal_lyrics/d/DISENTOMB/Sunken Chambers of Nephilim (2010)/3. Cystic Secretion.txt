Designs of malevolence
Wearing the flesh of humans
Creating a bridge between dimensions of unholiness

The birth of their saviour shook the earths floor
Skies blazed with lightning for one was chosen
Jesus of Nazareth, a selected son was born
Designs of malevolence

A separate birth of paralleled proportions
Took place where a mortal soul of another god
Was given unto the world
The accursed foe, eater of the mortal realm
To intercept, murder and make an example of Jesus

Prophecies had foretold the ancient battle
Around them mere humans unaware of the warfare
Suffering the plague of titans

The birth of Christ was met with the birth of another
Two messengers from god's stuck in an eternal struggle
For power of the earthly throne

A war fought on earth and the mysts of heaven
Suffering the plague
Suffering the plague of titans
Designs of malevolence
Wearing the flesh of humans
Creating a bridge between dimensions of unholiness

Prophecies had foretold the ancient battle
Around them mere humans unaware of the warfare

Suffering the plague of titans that command the earth
