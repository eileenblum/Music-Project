Disciples of the reverence
Growth of primitive hunger
Within the enlightened impurity spreads
Throughout the followers a metamorphosis begins
Traits of the beast recognised

Canines sinking into holy flesh
This abomination
It feeds on human flesh

A demonic possession only cured by death
Their hunger is satisfied

Only through literal eurachrist

Once messengers of the false
Now entombed in their flesh

Blind followers of the trinity
Begins their carnivorous rampage upon themselves

Once messengers of the false
Now entombed in their flesh
They reside in their
World of misery

Blind followers of the trinity
Carnivorous rampage
Blind follower
