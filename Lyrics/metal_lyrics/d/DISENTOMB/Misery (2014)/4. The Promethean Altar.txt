And he bleeds. And he begs. For final forgiveness
And he bleeds. And he begs
The disciple fooled, the prophet false
Shrouded in shadows misread, were the scriptures

Punished to the man, he who preached about false origins
Original text of meaning of where it all began
Flow a new era will reign with a final belief
Caught to the masses who could not comprehend

Power it could wield
Shrouded in shadows misread, were the scriptures
Punished to the man, he who preached about false origins
Dredging into life

Built from within the murk. Judgement
Death. Crawl towards end. Rotted
And he bleeds. And he begs. For final forgiveness
