A connection between two realms
The bridges that fills the void
Inside a path to an untouched world
Spewing forth from a worldly pain and despair

Adaptions to sickness. Unaware skies not red
Falling into the darkness. Consumed by the bleak
Gateways opened a connection between two realms
Silhouettes stalk from a distance

Appearing from the shadows
Sentenced to worlds of misery
Screams coming from the depths of canyons
Nowhere safe in bloodlands

Ominous structures leer downwards
Adaptions to sickness. Unaware skies not red
This place is changing me
