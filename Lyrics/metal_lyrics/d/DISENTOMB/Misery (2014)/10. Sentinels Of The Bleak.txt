Guardians of the shadow throne
Clouds gather overhead
The skull bares down on the followers.
It holds their gaze mesmerized by the void, sees their soul
Bleakened skies
Clouds gather overhead
Sentinels emerge from within scattered craters
Tribute to a former god
Hordes of light diminished under the bleak
Captured bound stripped of their wings
Tentacles feeding on their Misery
Dragged through the halls. Thrown into the...
Pit within filled with embers to incinerate
Their ashes billow from above the crown
They, protect the megalith
All that is left inside is a former angel
Guardians of the shadow throne
Clouds gather overhead
Sentinels emerge from within scattered craters
Formed from the murk.
