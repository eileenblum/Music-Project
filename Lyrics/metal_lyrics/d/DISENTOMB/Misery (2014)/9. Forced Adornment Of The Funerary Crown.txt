Crushed by our iniquities
Deriving from the fall of man
Symbolising the rejection of faith
Cast into our judgement
Denial of his false wisdom
A prophet...
Sentenced To Degradation
Suffering in complete agony
Forced adornment of the funerary crown

The thicket pierces flesh
Instrument woven for humiliation
Disciples witness their lords fall
Vision obscured by seeping fluids
Soon to be lead to...
Golgotha

Behold the man not god
Adornment of the crown deserved

Preparing a supposed messiah
Now to be erected before the crowds
Abandoned

Crushed by our iniquities
Deriving from the fall of the king of nothing
Behold the man not the god

Destined to be ripped from the earth
Placed upon the head of the ridiculed.
