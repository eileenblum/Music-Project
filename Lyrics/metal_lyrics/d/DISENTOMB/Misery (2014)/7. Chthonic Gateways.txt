The angelic descending onto barren realms
Sent to reclaim what was...
Not prepared for the obscure
The dwellers, their appearance sickening

Fuelled by hunger.
Their strength and barbarity grew.
Adapted to violence.
Their assault aimed to injure

Devout followers crushed into submission
Connective bones ripped from their spines,
Now they lie dead. Now laying wingless
Destruction of the trinity

Pyres built from
Sunken eyes. A hardened shell of infection
In their blood images of reflection
Sent to, reclaim, what was...

Blinded by the fires of their own limbs
The dwellers their appearance sickening
Fuelled by hunger, their strength and barbarity grew
