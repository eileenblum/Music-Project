Their icon of hope nailed down, bound by steel
Bleeding for his crown. The Golgothian monument
Rising from the earth, sentenced to suffer
Screams turn to whimpers
Baked under the sun. Skin blistering
Vultures circle overhead waiting for their prey
Abandoned on his cross.

His toll truths were lies. Sentenced to suffer
The messenger bloated, half eaten. The prophecies unfulfilled
Picked apart. Exposed muscle. A failure to his father
Abandoned on his cross on the mountain of Golgotha

Vultures descend

Abandoned by his father disciples witness the decay of their lord
The messenger bloated. A failure to his father's plan
False messiah stripped bare on his symbol of suffering
