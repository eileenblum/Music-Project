Plumes of smoke escaping the edifice
A carving from the visions of the end
Ultimate founder of this world
A tribute to the archbeast and his reign of eons
Man forgot of the horrors of this world since the gates closed
Now reopened man holds no natural defence against the living
Demented populations. Wandering through the gateways inside
Violence spreads a massacre of the inhabitants
Bow down to your overseer the only mercy shown will be a quick death
Sentinels warn the end is nigh
Lost across the plains of despair
An edifice for tribute
Rising from the...
In this realm of infinite distances
Isolated in this desolation. Suffering
Ultimate founder of this world
A tribute to the archbeast and his reigns of eons
