In the sunless fields of twilight dreams
The wings of unreality unfold
And though my eyes stare into what seems to be
Thereâs nothing there but the shadow of hope

And again I fall into the darkness
The only truth Iâve ever known
Forever denied to me the blessing of light
I curse the remnants of this life

Shadows of light rip through my mind
Tearing within my soul to fly
Wonât I open my eyes and die?
Oh please, let me die, Oh please let me die

Here after I hear the wind calling
Like echoes of a vision forlorn
My name sung over and over again
Broken into laughter as I reach out

Why was I left to un-rest in this dark place?
When all I ever wished for was to end it all
The icy embrace of the blade upon my flesh
My last communion with this god forsaken world

And again I fall into the darkness
The only truth Iâve ever known
Forever denied to me the blessing of light
I curse the remnants of this life

Bring upon this fallen world the wrath of centuries gone
A plague upon all humankind for none deserve the light of dawn
Here my lament from beyond, my silent song, my spell of hate
The angels have forsaken me; my only heaven is my grave

I curse this god and all its kind, those sheep on their knees for all time
As a wolf I have lived and died and for this I am damned to lie
Endlessly slumbering in the dark, forgotten by both life and death
Is this the price I am to pay for refusing to kneel and obey?
