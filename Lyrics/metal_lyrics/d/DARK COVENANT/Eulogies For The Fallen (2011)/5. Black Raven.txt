Fall down from the sky
Feathers black like the rain, no hope

The sun fell behind the curtain of a greyish dusk
As autumn leaves dance in the wind
The last chime of our world echoes in nothingness
Who but the ravens are left to care for us?

Fall down from the sky feathers black like the rain
No hope is there for us to gain
I see a black raven fly away 
Carrying our hopes and our dreams

Fly into the storm of mankindâs doom
