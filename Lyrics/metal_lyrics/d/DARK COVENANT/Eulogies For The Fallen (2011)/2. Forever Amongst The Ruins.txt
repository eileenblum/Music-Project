Dark shadows fall
As the wind blows upon
Towering monuments
Of broken memories

And I am left alone
To wander in what once was
Splendour in my mortal eyes
This life I used to call divine

Where are they now
The truths I took for granted
The light of a thousand suns
Now only dust remains

Will you now reach for me?
Dark endless eternity
Take me away from this life
Into a new beginning

I call upon the lords of time
To break the bonds of false eternity
This place of black illusion I must escape
I am not a child of this reality

Dark shadows fall

To break the bonds of false eternity
This place of black illusion I must escape
I am not a child of this reality
