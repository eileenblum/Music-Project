Oh faithless shadow, pale reflection of life
How you lurk about seeking for yourself
Breathing yet weeping, seemingly existing
A soulless form of all its warmth bereft

I gazed in the greyish mirror, and beheld nothingness
While growing inside, I felt its cold embrace

Come to me, woe undreamed of
Guide my soul to your shores

Visions of salvation

I canât recall I ever was, no matter, so futile
Now that I passed away in the fading light
My eyes open wide I wept, yet could not see beyond
What was I to find in the darkness before me?

Oh faithless shadow, pale reflection of life
How you lurk about seeking for yourself

Come to me, woe undreamed of
Guide my soul to your shores
