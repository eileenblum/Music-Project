With the tide they came, men with cross and steel
And gospel of a faith unknown

Sailed across the seas to bring us the light
For our heathen souls are surely damned

Gather âround all folk of the land to hear
The words of the one true god in the sky
Let there be no doubts, Heâs the only One
And none other than his name shall be praised

Bow to your knees, embrace your lord
He that will judge your immortal soul
Bow to your knees, renounce your ways
Choose now your fate, death or salvation

They burned our wood temples and sacred hearths
In the name of the love of their true god

Speaking of brotherhood our warriors have been put to the sword
The souls of our children theyâve enslaved

High in the northern sky the ravens fly
Witness to the tragedy before their eyes
Treacherous, deceitful is their heart black with hate
The men with cross and steel for death they came

The cold wind will know how proud we once were
When our hearts burned with heathen pride
Our gods and our blood through time will be remembered
And the broken sword shall be re-forged

Bow to your knees, embrace your lord
He that will judge your immortal soul
Bow to your knees, renounce your ways
Choose now your fate, death or salvation
