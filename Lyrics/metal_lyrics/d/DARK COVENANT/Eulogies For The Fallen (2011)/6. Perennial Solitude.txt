As veils of bereavement unfold before my eyes open wide
Iâm looking back into my past searching for the reason why
When the dawnâs first light graced my eyes tears of sorrow fell down from the sky
I rose to wash my hands in streams of ever flowing purity

With sadness I reached for the heavens knowing that I will never die
I yearn to bleed like all men do and lay down to never ending sleep
Who am I if not a shadow, a soulless wraith in flesh disguised?
Neither sun nor moon to mourn me only perennial solitude

Sing for me winds of memory
Sing for me winds of memory

Why was I cursed thus? 
To exist only in the twilight of dreams
What sins brought me here where despair whisper my name
In the lifeless realm of endless pain

As veils of bereavement unfold before my eyes open wide
Iâm looking back into my past searching for the reason why
Who am I if not a shadow, a soulless wraith in flesh disguised?
Neither sun nor moon to mourn me only perennial solitude
