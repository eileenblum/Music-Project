I walk alone, a path unknown
Far from the ravage of humanity
I see the sign, in the shadow of ravens black
The flaming sword of our destiny

What will become, when all is done
Of all those who have not yet began to see
The moon is gone, devoured as the sun
The great wolf of chaos is now roaming free

I see a black sun rising
As the sky turns red as blood
In a storm of flame burns our fate
I see a black sun rising
And all will be laid to waste
For a new dawn will bring new hope

Look at you now, how you crawl about
Searching for the solace of your society
I loathe the likes of you; you will find no tears from me
When the great pillar of the world fall I will be free

I see a black sun rising
As the sky turns red as blood
In a storm of flame burns our fate
I see a black sun rising
And all will be laid to waste
For a new dawn will bring new hope
