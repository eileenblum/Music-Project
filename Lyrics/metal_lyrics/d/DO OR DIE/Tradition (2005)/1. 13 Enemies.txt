They are 13 in number
Fate, will soon have to be defied
The moment i will have
To face my demons is near
I'll look at them straight in the eyes
The thirteen of them!!!

Face to the 13 enemies
I will never compromise
Always strike first
I will remain pitiless
I don't stand in fear of them
I stand proud, eyes wide open

When the battle will begin
Blood will have to be shed
They won't conquer by force of numbers
I will fight every one of them
I'll look at them straight in the eyes
The thirteen of them!!!
Face to the 13 enemies
I will never compromise
Always strike first
I will remain pitiless
