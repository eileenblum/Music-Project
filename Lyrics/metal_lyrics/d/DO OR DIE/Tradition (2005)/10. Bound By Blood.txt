Give me your promise
Give me your heart
The least flaw, the least vice
Any fault or weakness dearly paid!

Bound by blood, bount by honor

The least flaw, the leaast vice any
Fault or weakness dearly paid!
Face to face, staring straight
Standing still, always ready nothing could

Make them depart from the rules
Loyality is family
Treason means death
Dedication is required
Betrayal kills
Honor is involved
The honor of a family
To set the steal on the pact
That will blind us in respect

Eyes in the eyes, play your last card
Your best enemy stands face to you
But a pact a promise leads to treason
The only solution make him silent
Stop the enemy who will
Destroy the union before
Destroying you and your family

Bound by blood, bound by honor
The least flaw, the least vice any
Fault or weakness dearly paid!
Loyality is family
Treason means death
Dedication is required
Betrayal kills

Honor is involved
The honor of a family
To set the seal on the pact
That will blind us in respect
Eyes in the eyes, play your last card
Your best enemy stands face to you

Trust! just a promise to keep until, until death
Just a promise to keep until, until death
