Prohibition transformed Chicago in a city at war,
Rival gangs compete for control of the city's billion
Dollar empire of illegal alcohol, enforcing their will
With the baseball bat, hand grenade and tommy gun

It's the time of the gang lords
It's the time of Al Capone During prohibition
Had lost my illusions Started to drink whiskey
This perversion saved me
What have you done the games are done

Should have saved every penny
Had to feed my family, had always paid my debts
The barman was no honest,
He was a real motherfucker,
He thought we were losers,

It's the time of the gang lords
It's the time of Al Capone,
During prohibition Had lost my illusions
Started to drink whiskey
This perversion saved me one night
I killed this man
I had to kill the barman

When I realized Thought I'd be arrested
I learned who was the owner
He was called THE GODFATHER,
Damn! Seemed I made a fuckin' big mistake
Al Capone said IT'S A STROKE OF FATE!
He knew he was being cheated
Working it was my only quest

The Godfather gave this job to me
Nobody will no more laugh at me,
Selling alcohol...For Al Capone
Down in Chicago, years went by
I became The main dealer
Finaly rich and respected

It's the time of the gang lords
It's the time of Al Capone,
During prohibition Had lost my illusions
Started to drink whiskey This pervertion saved me
What have you done the games are done
