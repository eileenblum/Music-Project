I suffer hard
I'm no ruffian, no criminal
Just a man defending his honor
I was put to jail
like so many others

As time goes by
No more hope to see the light
No more fresh air from my beloved mountains
I miss home
Walls are all around me

No more fairs, no songs, no gatherings
I am dying slowly
No more hope to see the light
No more fresh air from beloved mountains
I miss home
Walls are all around me

I suffer hard
I sing for myself
In this dark room
Born at the contryside
I'm dying in this gloomy cell

No more hope to see the light
No more fresh air from beloved mountains
I miss home
Walls are all around me

There's a price to pay for living
I like pulling my own strings
Now i count the days
It's hard to keep the faith
