Some put spokes in your wheels
We always got through it
Some thought we would give up
But it made us stronger
Some claimed they were on our side

They were the first ones to drop us
As soon as they get what they wanted
They said we asked too much
You think without you do or die is dead,
You're wrong, we will set
The place on fire with or without you

Some wanted to put us down
We always got up
In spite of all the defeats
The demons will always rise,
Some claimed they were on our side

They were the first ones to drop us
As soon as they get what they wanted
They said we asked toot much
You think without you do or die is dead,
You're wrong, we will set
The place on fire with or without you
You made a choice, it's too late too get back,
The new DOD is in the house
