There is no valor without honor
This large family is the bella famiglia
He who deserves it stays, he who doesn't leaves
There is no forgiveness, there is no pity

Soon Tano will turn seventeen he'll
Learn the laws of the family
The first one is silence
Then is apprenticeship will ready begin
You will meet the members and
Finally see the head of the family
From then on you will be a man of tradition
For us traditions are important
And we respect them from father to son
You don"t betray the family

Don't betray
Never betray
Family
You don't fail in your duty
Never fail in your duty
You don't talk about it
Never talk about it

Soon Tano will turn seventeen he'll
Learn the laws of the family
The first one is silence
Then his apprenticeship will ready begin
You will meet the members and
Finally see the head of the family
From then on you will be a man of tradition
A secret can hide another one
Never talk to a stranger who might be your enemy
Only put your trust in the head of the family
Always put your trust in the head of the family
This is the tradition
