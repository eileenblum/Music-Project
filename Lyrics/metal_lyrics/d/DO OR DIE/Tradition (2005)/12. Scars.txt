That's not my day...
Or maybee you're lucky for once
The proof is on my body - A testimony of the past
The mark is on my body - A testimony of that time

Scars, eternal mark - Scars, Forever marked
That's not my day...Or maybee you're lucky for once
Your luck has turned - Like a reminder on my skin
The pain I felt that day - The hate I feel today Scars
Reply migh be long in coming - Get ready for anything
Revenge is a dish best eaten cold

You got it coming back to you
