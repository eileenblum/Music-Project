How can you stand in those shoes
You say you're led astray
Fall on your knees and pray
Knife in the boot

You offer no good reason
Gun in the hand
For you there is no pardon
All the years and the tears
I have shared with you my friend

You broke the pact that you had signed
You're discovered you're uncoverd
Don't turn around cos the reason's treason
You hear the nonsence reason
Your temple's a prison
Those troubles consume you

I will see you tomorrow
Build up your best defense
I'll meet you frozen mind
Kinfe in the boot

You offer no good reason
Gun in the hand
For you there is no pardon
All the years and the tears
I have shared with you my friend
You broke the pact that you had signed
You're discvered you're uncovered
Don't turn around cos the reason's treason

It's time to play
We were blood brothers
It seems you've faked
No pity for ya
Look within yourself
Force-feeding lies
You feel sick inside
Blood will flow for sure

Now your face is known
I trusted you and felt apart
I'll cut down the enemy
