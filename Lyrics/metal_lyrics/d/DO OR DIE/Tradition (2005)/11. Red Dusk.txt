Clouds are threatening, the sky's turning red
Blood covers the wall
Enemy is there, his eyes upon you
Guts lie on the floor

Fight till the end and win
The smell of fear exhilarates
The smell of blood whets rage
Are you ready for the red dusk - Red dusk
Hatchet once buried now dripping with blood
Deadly blow was given
Their mission is done, their goal is achieved
Days of grace are gone

Fight till the end and win
The smell of fear exhilarates
The smell of blood with rage
Are you ready for the red dusk - Red dusk
They came this way, they might never be back
They operate at night, no weakness, no break
What stimulates this rage?
Who motivates these plusions?
Dark castes spred their shadow
Treaty of alliance has united the clans

Fight till the end and win
The smell of fear exhilarates
The smell of blood whets rage
Are you ready for the red dusk
