Murder case, Hood erasers, Paper chasers
Fingers on the trigger,
I often reminisce
Thinkin to myself
How did We end up like this
All this shit We witnessed

Gun for gun
Hundred to one
It's hard to survive
When We look at our sons
We see tears fall from their eyes
Rise above...and get up out
We're here to stay

Get ready for the drama - Get ready for vendetta
Our name alone spells fear
We run the streets
We mobilize, we been rated
High enemies die, bullets fly

Gun for gun
Hundred to one
It's hard to survive
When We look at our sons
We see tears fall from their eyes
Rise above...and get up out
We're here to stay

Get ready for the drama - get ready for vendetta
Corruption, crime and perversion
Corruption, hate and perversion
Running, breathing, trembling, crashing, smash your brain
This is a dangerous day We'll blow your mind away,
We Will leave this world behind

But there's no way to find
Murder case, Hood erasers, Paper chasers
Fingers on the trigger Got to pack the steel
We march out without fear
Feel the power of your legion There's no escape
There's no place to run Until the battle's done

Get ready for the drama - get ready for vendetta
You ain't ready for what We got for ya
You ain't ready for vendetta
