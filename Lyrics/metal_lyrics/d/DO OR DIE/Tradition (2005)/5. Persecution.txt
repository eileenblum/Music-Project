I see you watching me
I see you studying me
The walls come, crashing in,
Tell onslaught of self doubt

Invide you once again
A never ending circle, I've seen it all before
I question myself, I can rely on myself
In this world nothing is worth,
Is woth the fuckin' pain
I sse you watching me
I see you studying me

The walls come, crashing in,
Tell me in who you believe
Persecution
Persecution comes straight to you

From your own mind
Persecution comes straight to you
Never fell down, never give up, never will
Persecution
Persecution comes straight to you

From your own mind
Persecution comes straight to you

Tell me to turn it down,
I'll make it twice as loud
You feel the way I sound,
Your face right on the ground

Lead me out of take me in,
Why do I even bother,
I don't fucking care
I don't care
