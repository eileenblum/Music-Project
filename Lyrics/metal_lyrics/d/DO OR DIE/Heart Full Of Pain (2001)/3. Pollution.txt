The sun's burning
The sky's grey
Concrete's replaced grass
Buildings've replaced trees
Can't we find a better way
That to wait? it's too late
We won't be here for long
Extinction is close
Soon the dirt will cover the planet
The planet looks like a grabage can
Cant we find a better way
Than to wait? it's too late
What will happen when there is nothing between us and the sun
The sun's no longer shining
The sky's not blue anymore
Death fishes in the seas
Birds have no strength left to fly x4
As I look towards the sky
There must be something, we can find
A different way to die
Something to save our kind
