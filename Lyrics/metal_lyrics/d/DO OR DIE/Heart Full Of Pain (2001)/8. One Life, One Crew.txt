Gotta stand up and fight, you're not alone
Never deny yourself, don't dig a hole
These streets are yours, and they will always be
Running through your veings, wars in the streets
Even if behind you, there's always a wall
Be always respected for what you've said and done
The crew's in your heart, a second family
Respect and friendship, values in the streets
ONE LIFE, ONE CREW
They're always there for you
ONE LIFE, ONE CREW
Fighting the world for you
ONE LIFE, ONE CREW
ONE LIFE, ONE CREW
Your closest friends, they know what you stand for
Telling you that you're doing right, or wrong
When you look in there eyes, what do you see?
Your life, your crew, and this will always be
ONE LIFE, ONE CREW
