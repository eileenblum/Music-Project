Don't try to understand what goes inside me
Life ain't always what it seems
So many reasons for my rage
I've locked myself in a cage
You can lie to the world
You can't lie to yourself
My feelings deep inside burn like a fire
I don't expect no response from you
Keep your distance, don't try to interfere
Don't try to understand what goes inside me
Life ain't always what it seems
So many reason for my rage
I've locked myself in a cage
Who are you to tell me contain my self
I will never change my wicked ways
My heart's full of pain
It hurts inside
Can't take it anymore
I've cheated my soul
And I'm begging for more
Inner conflicts
Sorrow's part of the game
Inner feelings
Pain is part of my life
