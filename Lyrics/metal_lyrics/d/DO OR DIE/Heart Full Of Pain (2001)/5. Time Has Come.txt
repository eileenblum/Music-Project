No turning back the last soul has gone
The door is closed ant the innocent one destroyed
Our last chance to keep our sacred rights
We are damned by our own guide,
What are we supposed to do?
Evil and fire fall from the sky
The sun is dying maybe we're all guilty?
A divine intervention or a vengeance of the earth we destroyed?
For the final fall
From the end of the old world,
mankind is the only one to blame
