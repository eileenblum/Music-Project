The sound of hooves behind the door
Time to wield the blades
On a leather streed we rides
Time's take its toll on the human race
Remember what all had to endure
A man shattered by grief
A war without justice
The power of hope a nation divided by hatred
The strength of courage
The triumph of the human spirit
The savior's drawing nearer
Incarnation of release's back
Agony obscurity ritual ceremony savior
Hear the sound of war
Crushing metal strikes
Circle of destruction
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Senseless destruction
Deadly arrows are flying
People are dying
Agony obscurity ritual ceremony
Time to repent
Time for revenge
Time for justice
Justice
Swing the judgement hammer down
The summon bell's chiming
Smoke's lifting form the battle fields
Blood feed the war machine
Savior
