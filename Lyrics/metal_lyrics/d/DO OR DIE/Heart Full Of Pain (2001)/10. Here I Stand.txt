Here I stand, waiting for my future
Trying to understand my past, like the witness of a crime
But it looks like an old movie;
No colors,
No sounds
Just the taste of blood and tears, just a taste of deception
I feel so incomplete, like a ship without sails, like a body witout breath
Where's my life, will I find my place in this world?
There's no calling inside of me, there is no voice inside my head
My fate's not written, I have it in my hands
Here I stand, waiting for my future
Like a fallen angel crying for what was lost
