What is done is done
Leave the troubles behind
You'll succeed if you try
Listening to the music you like
Go ride your bike
Or grab this mic
Take time to enjoy
You're a funny boy
Havin' fun with your friends
Drinking beer in your favorite pub
Spend some time with your family
Don't take yourself to seriously
Live for today
Do it your way
Don't look back
All's not black
Surfing the web or playing video game
Come walking in the sun
It's time to have some fun
Go ride your bike
Or grab this mic
Take time to enjoy
You're a funny boy
Live for today
Do it your way
Don't look back
All's not black
Give away your TV
Come on follow me
