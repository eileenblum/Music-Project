Why don't you tell us honestly?
Oh, yeah ! Words don't come easily !
So many files not clarified
Proceedings I don't understand
I wonder how it's gonna end
Will the whole truth ever be told
Murdered ministers
Social disaster
Set up inquiry
Doubtfull theory
First the killing
Then inquiring
Population awaiting
So many files not clarified
Proceedings I don't understand
I wonder how it's gonna end
Will the whole truth ever be told
Least said soonest mended
Distroted truth twisted lies
First the killing
Then inquiring
Population awaiting
How can you live with such a weight on your conscience
All the faillures of the past come back to my mind
First the killing
Then inquiring
Population awaiting
