Do or die, like our lives
No turnin' back
It's our pride
A second family,
takin' care of each others
We are more than friends, we call them brothers
As a circle of friends, no beginning no end
We can't leave our common past behind us
All these years, we've invested in the same way
In a total devotion in what we stand for
Days after days, years after years
Keeping intact our rage to overcome
Do or die
Like our lives
No turnin' back
It's our pride
Do or die
