My conscience's deep inside me, I cannot understand
The way they used to be an the fears they used to have
Theres no more recognition,
their lives are burning down
My youth and all my memories made me suffering and crying
Violation, self-destruction
I'm losing all my friends
But I'm notable to deny, all these years but I tried
Am I the only one who heard, am I the only one who saw
And what am I supposed to do now, watch them going down.
Violation, self-destruction
I'm losing all my friends
The last one of the family, no patience anymore
Against this modern felony, I't love anymore
