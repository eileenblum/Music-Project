Spend my life looking for something
What it is I don't know; Looking for happiness
I found sorrow; This place must be hell

You gotta know the rules
I'm slowly losing my mind
I've suffered hard
Can't take the pain no more

I'm gonna break these chains
I've got bad things on my mind
Spent my time breaking rules

That's a fact I like to gamble
But this time I won't lose

Life's a struggle
Life's a game

I made it through the hard times
I got nothing left to lose
So many things I can't explain
Life's a bitch &amp; then you die
