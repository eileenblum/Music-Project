Cornered in the cold side of life
Trapped into this world of lies

The world's upside down
Dreams are falling to pieces
There's no more hope to be found
Searching the strength to resist

Sometimes the world's against me
You think you know what's good for me

I don't ask anything
I don't wanna be locked
For life in the cage you have set up for me

This time I turn
I keep my eyes wide open
You think you know what's good for me

Till my last breath - for freedom - I will stand
Till my last breath - for freedom - I will fight
Till my last breath - for freedom - I will stand
Till my last breath - for freedom - I will fight

I try - I learn - I live - I will make it
A new era has come
I'm the only master of my destiny

Till my last breath - for freedom - I will stand
Till my last breath - for freedom - I will fight
Till my last breath - for freedom - I will stand
Till my last breath - for freedom - I will fight
