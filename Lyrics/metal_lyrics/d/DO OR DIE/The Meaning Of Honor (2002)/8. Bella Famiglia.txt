Blood will follow blood
But not in the name of god
Come my friend and you will see
What means for us family

Facing us, no compromise
Between us, no place for lies
Facing us, you won't survive
Between us, it's do or die

There's a time for life
And a thousand ways to die
The thing that makes us strong
We think and fight as one

Tears will follow tears
For old friends disappeared
Come my friend and you will see
What means for us unity

Full of love, full of respect
For your bro, your mom, your dad
Always honest with your friends
With yourself from birth till death

Full of love, full of respect
For your bro, your mom, your dad
Always honest with your friends
With yourself from birth till death

Che un' tempu' pi viviri e
Mille sorte pi murire
Cosa canni fannu' forti
E pinsare e cummattere
Come una! Bella famiglia!!!
