Mysteries and secrets, deep inside us
The last creation of an ancient kind
Nuclear testing under the sun
Black rain and death left behind

Mysteries and secrets, deep inside us
The last creation of an ancient kind
Nuclear testing under the sun
Black rain and death left behind

Darkened skies, darkened skies

And for the next generations
Life under darkened skies?
Man's new doctrine
A fast and total destruction!

Mysteries and secrets, deep inside us
The last intrusion of the human kind
In the natural order
And life will disappear
Under our darkened skies

And for the next generations
Life under darkened skies?
And for the next generations
Life under darkened skies?
