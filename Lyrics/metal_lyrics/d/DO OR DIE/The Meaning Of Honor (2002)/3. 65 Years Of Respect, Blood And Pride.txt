We belong to our families
&amp; so does our blood
And for them we would shed it...
Without a moment's hesitation

Gathering our 2 lines...
Was a success thanks to...
The maturity and...
Respect of our elders

It's been 65 years...
That our bloods were blended...
And our families grow...
Larger and stronger
Year... after... year

When the little Iano...
Was brought in the world...
The alliance was forged

We all have the same roots...
And the same origins...
Their source lies in the blood,
Red like vengeance and the...
Honor of our fathers

By hearing our music...
The ones who know us know...
Who are the leaders,
And they know who beat time

Lu canto famigliare spargi
Violence e terrore pi li nostri nimici
Pace e calore pi li nostri amici
Fierta e onore pi nostri fratelli e sorelle

Born on an island
In the middle of nowhere,
Our renown
Has now crossed the borders,
And the name of the
Family is mentioned
With respect everywhere

Na nostra famiglia
Non' pardoniamo mai
Na nostra famiglia
Si vivi onoratamente
Na nostra famiglia
Non' naviemo pieta
Na nostra famiglia
Si vivi onoratamente

At home, we don't talk because
Walls have ears, and as
Our fathers used to say,
A man who doesn't talk much
Is a man who knows...

Na nostra famiglia
