Families set apart
Woken up with a start
Like a scream in the night
The sound of a fight

Singles or couples
Seized like animals
Fugitives were shot
Killed on the spot

Invading enemies
Conquered territories
Military Breakthrough

On the run for freedom
Hiding for survival
Concentration camp

Guarding watch tramp
Packed out shacks
Only the strongest survive

Days and night in a cage
Locked and exploited
The destiny of a slave

[Chorus - Breakthrough (x2) - Chorus]

Massive internment
Rude confinement
Broken up families
Piled up dead bodies
