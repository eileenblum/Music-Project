Show me the way to defeat my stronger enemy
Send me the power of hate
The demons of flesh
Your justice is done, friendship is gone
This world is ruled by the gods of war

Angry eyes, narrow minds
We're facing the beginning of
A new century with death in our eyes

Mankind is trapped in a nightmare of freedom
Entering darkness, light left behind
We are the witnesses of the downfall of humanity

Angry eyes, narrow minds
We're facing the beginning of
A new century with death in our eyes

Angels of pain, demons of war
Angels of pain, demons of war

The skies are crying, the earth is bleeding
The tears of the god they loved?
A tide of lies!
Our last temple is a temple of flesh
Deep in our hearts
Where evil is waiting
Waiting for the demons of intolerance...
Where evil is waiting
Waiting for the demons of intolerance...
