Seven days, was all they wrote
I thought the field had clerared
Another suit challenged me
I have to make a choice
They're not bluffing this time
It's plain to see, it's them or me

It makes me think
Seven days
Will quickly go
Seven days
So many ways
I can't run away

What they said keeps ringing in my head
I need some time...
Need one more chance...

Monday, I could wait till
Tuesday If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
Does it bother me?

Someone to talk to
When I get down
I won't run away
No place to run
No place to hide

I'm not blind
Though I know there's no way...
To bring back yesterday

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, but Sunday'd be too late

Monday, I could wait till
Tuesday If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
Does it bother me?

I don't care about
What people say
I still believe in myself
I still go
My own way
I don't know if it's right or wrong
I just feel confused and
My thoughts go away
