Here I am, I have nothing to prove
Right now, there's nothing left to loose
My only desire is to stay with you

But my ego told me to kill you too
I am not afraid of the consequences
There's a conflict between me
And my conscience
I'm known as the sickest one around

The fuckin' mad one who can bring you down
But remember for ever I'm your friend
Even if forever means your own end!

Cause like death I'm insane and unstable
And like poison, I can be sweet but horrible
If your soul is as cold and dark as mine
So join me at the table!!!

Confusion's in my veins
Eternal hate's by my side
Deeply blinded by pain
From me you cannot hide
