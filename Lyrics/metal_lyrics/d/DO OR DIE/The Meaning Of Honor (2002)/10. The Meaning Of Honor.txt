You were born and raised to take care
Of the members
Of your family and lead them on the right way

Crossing your native land
You learned and understood
The meaning of honor

Now you are one of them because
Of blood and honor
And to hunt unworthy traitors

To found the rules of the family
Laws of honor and war
Major and minor and criminal too

Honor and war

Respect - love - honor - famiglia
Respect - love - honor - famiglia

We all live honourably in our family
Honor and respect are laws
And treason is not forgiven

Laws of blood and silence, passed down
From father to son
- these are the laws of the family

Respect - love - honor - famiglia
Respect - love - honor - famiglia

Respect of values is essential...
