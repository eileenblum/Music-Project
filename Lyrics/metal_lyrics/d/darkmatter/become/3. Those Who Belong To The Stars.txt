Those who belong to the stars
It all begins with confrontation
A constant battle in our heads
And then we'll prevail
The people hating on us
The people conquering us
They're trying to control our thoughts
Let them we shall not

There is a reason
There is something more in us
We are the light so bright
We are those who belong to the stars

We will declare eternal war
To those who stand against our 'cause
Enemies to our kind
The people shattering us
The people questioning us
We cannot take it anymore
This is not what we are

There is a reason
There is something more in us
We are the light so bright
We are those who belong to the stars [2x]

[Puente:]
Lose yourself, come take my hand
And fly away from this damned land
'Cause we can make a better place [2x]

Beneath black skies we're crawling
We need to save ourselves
The light shall guide our path to
that better place [2x]

We have the key to our
Freedom, just take it all
Reset and focus now
Its our life, it's our mind [2x]
