Lies! There is no future
For everything we've built and praised all along
Pride! No crime's forgiven
There's only pain, it's all in vain, let me out!
I am stuck between my dreams and reality [2x]

Expect nothing from no one
We humans can't forget the damage done
Lost and numb we're judging ourselves
Condemned to dwell in darkness
We're heading to Hell
The nature of our blood, mankind shall not endure
It takes more than just words to change a man

[Puente 2x:]
See the world with eyes wide open
There is no room for the blind

Lies! There is no future
For everything we've built and praised all along
Pride! No crime's forgiven
There's only pain, it's all in vain, let me out!
So you may think I'm just a fool
But soon you'll know the truth, we are all doomed

So you may think I'm just a fool
But soon you'll know the truth, we are all doomed
