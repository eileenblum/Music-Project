I see my face alone through broken mirrors
I feel the rage, it's growing everyday
You won't erase my hatred, can you feel it?
You are the 'cause and also consequence

My life is turning restless
Like a slave craving for salvation
This world no longer suits me
I have become one with grief
I'll bring you down

The reckoning, I count every damn second
Until my wrath fall upon you
There'll be no sun, no moon or constellation
Not even one star will glow for you

[Puente:]
I've begged, you turned your back
Left behind, I've planned your demise
And your world will turn black
All alone and ready to die

My life is turning restless
Like a slave craving for salvation
This world no longer suits me
I have become one with grief
