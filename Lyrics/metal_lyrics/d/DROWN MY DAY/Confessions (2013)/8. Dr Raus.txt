sitting in an empty room
hear only discontinuous breath
among this dead silence

dawn will come soon
the shield of sun emerges
and then he's gone forever

twilight of life's existence
gambling, risk, adrenaline were his names
always had a brush with abysm

look into the past, lost in memories
this face in front of my countenance
so silent

that night true friend passed away
in smoking drinking vapours
dawn become darkness
happiness turned into mourn
obscurity covered lightness

hate drowned love
ask myself a question
why him? why now? why this way?

hate drowned love
ask myself a question
why him? why now? why this way?

sitting in an empty room
hear only discontinuous breath
among this dead silence

dawn will become closely
the shield of sun emerges
and then he's gone forever

his voice eternal in intimates hearts
has passed the way we're tramping

place where we meet again
will be different
from all evil we've lasted

place where we meet again
will be different
from all evil we've lasted
