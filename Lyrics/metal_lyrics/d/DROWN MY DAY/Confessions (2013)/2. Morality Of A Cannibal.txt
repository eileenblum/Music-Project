don't eat me it's so fucking painful 
these words make me despise you 
spare me, take someone else 
you feel fear that's what motivates me 

after cutting your limbs 
your body will be my sacrifice

when I'll see you crying from pain 
I'll nod with a smile on my face 

your simple death just won't satisfy me 
you have to be despised 
let me drink your blood and eat your flesh 

you entered my territory just like a goddamn enemy 
your no better than just a pig 
your my prey, i do it for you 
instead of dying you'll let me feast 

do you think that i will feel wrong? 
that your spirit will come back to me? 
you're wrong motherfucker, I'll sleep with full stomach

the battle has started long time ago 
survival of the strongest, weak will be eaten
