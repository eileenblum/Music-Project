forgotten!

it's okay, it's alright
everything gonna be fucked up

where is your pride?
one day from my life
where is your heart?
they want to break me up

your words are killing me
'cause the lack of love in them

where is your pride?
one day from my life?
where is your heart?
they want to break me up

they've been teaching me how to hate
enough to close your eyes and don't see
your soul is weeping being in this torment
from pain and suffering - this weep

the time has come
when all good things come to an end
open your mind and see
that all hope is gone

forgotten but not forgiven

I'm still trying to forget
all these cruel things
