this isn't a tale, this is the story of a real man
living with blindness, he's had a great gift
consistently making poor life choices
no matter what they said...

do it right, do it better than everyone else
show the world you're the best
break the chains, fuck them all, now break the walls

hoichi the earless
hoichi the earless

one night, he's left alone in a temple
somebody calls his name

I am blind I cannot know
I cannot know who calls

meeting with the ghost changed his life
presented his ability to recite
contact with something strange
he became a famous man

I am blind I cannot know
I cannot know who calls

hoichi the earless
hoichi the earless
