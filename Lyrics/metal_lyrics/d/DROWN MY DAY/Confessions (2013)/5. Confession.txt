been telling about punishment, stab
thoughts are dark and bodeful
face fully covered, errant eyes so inhumane
living on the edge in the darkness of daylight

been telling about self destruction, perdition of realism
now becoming purely insane
must warn you against myself

this is the confession about fear's message 
confession about revulsion, negation of life's essence
manic reincarnation of all evil
borned in my head 

been drowning in delusions
riven by memories

this is the confession about fear's message 
feel disgust to the author
feel scared about these words

leave 'em all alone
