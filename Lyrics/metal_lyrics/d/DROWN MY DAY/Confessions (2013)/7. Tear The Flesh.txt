false prophets speak in a twisted tongues
all that evil deep inside the soul of man
the innocent perish cruel the remain

tear the flesh
suffocate the weak
weaken the strong
burn the poor

blast from hell one thousand times  
burn by the fire from underground
ripping the flesh, boiling the blood
morbid creation, the end of your world

tear the flesh
suffocate the weak
weaken the strong
burn the poor

ripping the flesh, boiling the blood
morbid way to end things, existence denied

more you can feel
more ways to suffer
suffocate, kill, burn, rape and die

tear the flesh
suffocate the weak
weaken the strong
burn the poor

weak brains believing false speech of the dead
mindless act of vengeance, blast from the hell
morbid way to end things, existence denied
one way to suffer, painful and slow

tear the flesh
suffocate the weak
weaken the strong
burn the poor

tear
the
tear the flesh!
