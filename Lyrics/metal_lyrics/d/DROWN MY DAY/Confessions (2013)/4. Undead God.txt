lacerated flesh filled with anger
endless passion for eating your brain
when the day comes and everyone is dead
bow down to the god of the undead
show me your fear

your time will come

they're coming, you're one of few still alive
cold fear mixed with will to survive

your brain will be eaten
your body will rot
now bow to the undead god

now there's no point in running
they're everywhere

bow to the god of the undead
there's no other way
god of the undead and his kingdom
is coming on your way

to take your dignity
stench, filth, anger, pain
death and hate
there's no point in running away

god of the undead
his army of walking dead
when your time will come
you will be the sacrifice
