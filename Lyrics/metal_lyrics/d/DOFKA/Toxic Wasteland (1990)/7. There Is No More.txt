[Brick Mistress cover]

Awaiting the day of your death
Your time has arrived
Evil intensions, awaiting your soul
You pray to be free
The clouds are your warning
The rain keeps on pouring
There is no return

There is no more
There is no more

Inside I plead
In agony
Inside my eyes
Tears that I've cried
Will I be free?

Result of your judgment
Heaven or hell?

Angel of death
Take me away
To heaven
Oh, before the king

There is no more
There is no more
There is no more

In heaven rest in peace
