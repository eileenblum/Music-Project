In times of old
A stories told of him
Who's life unfolds
Without god's grace be damned

His evil takes flight
On the wings of the dead

By night he'll rise
He hungers for the feast
Stare in his eyes
And bow down to his feet

Eternal life have
With the vampire's curse

You better beware
Of the vampire's
The drinking of blood
The quenching of thirst
Arise from the grave
Your soul taken first
You better beware
Of the vampire's curse

Ha, Ha, Ha
In the night the moon is shining
From the grave arousing fear
On leather wings a devil flying
Be prepared your death is near

Farewell my friends
I hope you wish me well
We'll meet again
In the depths of hell

You better beware
Of the vampire's
The drinking of blood
The quenching of thirst
Arise from the grave
Your soul taken first
You better beware
Of the vampire's curse
You better beware
Of the vampire's
The drinking of blood
The quenching of thirst
Arise from the grave
Your soul taken first
You better beware
Of the vampire's curse
