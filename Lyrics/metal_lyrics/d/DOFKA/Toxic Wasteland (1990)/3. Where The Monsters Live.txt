Bring back the evils of my childhood days
Douse the light
I see all those things in the dark
Inside my closet where the creatures lay
Stay out of sight
Pulled blankets over me tight
Think of stories that my friends all tell
Something's coming
Oh how I wished it was light
Awake I listen to the smallest sound
Better watch out
For the creatures that come with the night

Time is here and your fear comes a creeping
Into your room, into the bed where you're sleeping
Startled you wake and you break to a cold sweat
Feeling like the dark of night is closing fast
To take your life

Don't be afraid, no
In the darkness where the monsters live
Don't be afraid, no
In the darkness where the monsters live

Now I'm much older and those days have past
Douse the light
I still have those fears of the dark
Unknowing I must face the final test
Stay out of sight
Pulled blankets over me tight
What's that I hear behind the closet door
Something coming
Oh how I wished it was light
It's moving closer now I hear the sound
Better watch out
It's the demons that come with the night

Time is here and your fear comes a creeping
Into your room, into the bed where you're sleeping
Startled you wake and you break to a cold sweat
Feeling like the dark of night is closing fast
To take your life

Don't be afraid, no
In the darkness where the monsters live
Don't be afraid, no
In the darkness where the monsters live

Whispers of evil I hear on the wind
Towering shapes appear at my window
Think of the stories I thought were untrue
Stuck in my mind, trying to break through
Over and over, again and again
They're coming for me
I fear it's the end
