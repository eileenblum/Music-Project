I'm adrift upon the sea
A man without a cause
All the ones that count on me
Have thrown me for a loss

I sit alone, a darkened room
My soul has slipped away
The doors have closed upon my life
Will happiness find me today?

I can't make it alone
Alone
I can't make it alone

I'm locked inside my heart
And you posses the key
Let me out so you can give
A life for you and me

Sit alone, a darkened room
My heart's been ripped away
The doors have closed upon my life
Will happiness find me today?

I can't make it alone
Alone
I can't make it alone
