...The revelations became fulfilled...
...as man overreached his limitations...
...He unleashed chemicals into the atmosphere...
...And the sky became black...
...What fell from the clouds was not of god...
...For it changed the earth...
...And what the earth became was a desolate place...
...Barren of existence...
...A toxic wasteland...

Behold, the sky is darkening
DIE, DIE, DIE, DIE
Feel, your throat is tightening

The clouds of death are slowly calling
The atmosphere around us falling

The toxic wasteland
The planets last stand
They tried to warn us
The ones before us
The toxic wasteland
Is under command of all

Now, the air where breathing
DIE, DIE, DIE, DIE
On, our lungs it's feeding

The clouds of death are slowly calling
The atmosphere around us falling

The toxic wasteland
The planets last stand
They tried to warn us
The ones before us
The toxic wasteland
Is under command of all

[Solo]
[First Verse]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

...Toxic Wasteland...
...Toxic Wasteland...

DIE!!!
