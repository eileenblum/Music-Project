The nomads came for us that night
As we lie sleeping safe beneath the stars
And they stood watching
Descending fast without a sound
They tortured, burned, and stole our lives away
And we kept fighting

They've taken all we had
They've taken all we had
They've taken all we had

We fought in vain throughout the day
But we weren't strong enough
To make them go away
Our blood kept spilling
Now the battle's all but done
The slain remains of loved ones
Scattered all around
And we'll keep living

They've taken all we had
They've taken all we had
They've taken all we had

I stood in the silence
And watched out by night
For the nomads that came here
And quenched out our lives
I'll search for a lifetime
I'll reach the earths end
'Till the deaths of my loved ones
Have all been avenged

They've taken all we had...
