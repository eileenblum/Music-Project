A toy to the doctor
My life is in his hands
No cure is known to man
And medicine's his plan

Now you must take the treatment
The radiation plan
The pain is getting deeper
Oh please just take this plague away
And leave me be, oh
Leave me be

The doctor gives me things that
I just don't understand
He's laughing as he treats me
He knows that I'll breathe my final breath

The plague is kicking in
Fly on wings to your death

The doctor of death calls you
The doctor of death calls you
The doctor of death calls you

I cannot see why
I'm inflicted
So much pain

The doctor of death calls you
The doctor of death calls you
The doctor of death calls you
