[Screamer cover]

Away on the wings of the dragon
Away on the wings of the dragon

With a strong and mighty cry
Dragon races to the sky
High above the earth below
A terror like you've never known

Children gather near the altar
Chosen ones
Displayed for all to see
You must answer to the master
Chosen ones
The dragon comes for thee

The masters arrived
Like hell from the sky
The chosen ones cried
Preparing to die!!!

Away on the wings of the dragon
We'll carry you home to your death

Away on the wings of the dragon

Away on the wings of the dragon
We'll carry you home to your death

Away on the wings of the dragon
The truth will be known, free at last

The masters arrived
Like hell from the sky
The chosen ones cried
Preparing to die!!!
