Fall away. As we'll do. The strings are tugged and taught. Fraying with my
demeanor.

Wisps and whispers float along
Captive in infinity.

I can only hope to hear hers.
I can only hope to feel hers.

Smolder out. As we'll do.
She sings her songs of naught.
And I'm praying that I'll hear her.

Wisps and whispers float along
Captive in infinity.

She sings her songs of naught.
And I'm praying that I'll hear her.
