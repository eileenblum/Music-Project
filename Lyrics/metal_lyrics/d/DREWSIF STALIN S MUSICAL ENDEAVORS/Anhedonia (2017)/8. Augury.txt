Fall away
As we'll do
Smolder out
As we'll do

I spent so much time staring at the ceiling
That in my daze
With my head raised
I never looked down to see the writing on the wall

I watched you pulling away
While reassuring me of your involvement.
Ex-communicate.
Not a single bit of effort for you.
Fuck.

After all is said and done,
We never fought, and nobody won.
And at first we grew together
But you were only here for fair weather.

I held you up so high,
Put you on a pedestal.
But you let your love die.
And now you'll fall down.

To the fucking cement.
To the hell that you've kept me in.

After all is said and done,
I am still my father's son.
With my mother tongue unspoken
The circle remains unbroken

The augury
I was too blind to see
