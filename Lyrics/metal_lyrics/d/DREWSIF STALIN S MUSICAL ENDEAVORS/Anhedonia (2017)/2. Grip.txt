Connection
Affection
Regression
Subjection

In the throes of grief,
In remorse's debt.
Crushed under irony's massive breadth.

Words that spill from an ugly mouth:
Words that hold no weight.

Compassion forced
From captive scorn,
And active remorse.
Confessions of love
Obsessions in vein
Recessions of love will now douse the flame.

(I've been) Carrying ideations of a greater future.
Ideations you dropped so long ago.
But you never let me know
Now I'm left begging for those same cold hands
To release me from their grip.

Walled in,
Yet free to roam.
Lost to the world.
Windows locked.
Doors closed.
Silenced of your own accord.
Does the truth you hoard burn you away inside?
As much as it's absence pains me?
I mourn for you.
A beautiful smile
Regurgitating fallacy.
A beautiful mind
Avoiding tangency
