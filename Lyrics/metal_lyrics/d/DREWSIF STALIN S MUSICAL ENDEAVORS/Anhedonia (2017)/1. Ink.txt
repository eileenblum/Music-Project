Line approaching line
End apprehending end
Inching closer and closer
Windows closing
Exhaling impaired judgement
Like father like son
A replica more flawed than the archetype
Hoping desperately my pen runs dry
While procuring more and more ink.

Put the period on this sick fucking run on sentence

And I can't blame you
For what you've been dealt
The sting of neglect
A mother's love unfelt
But where do I turn when I feel the same?
This is a shared burden, no passing on the blame.

Line approaching line
End apprehending end
Inching closer and closer
Windows closing
Exhaling impaired judgement
Like father like son
A replica more flawed than the archetype
Hoping desperately my pen runs dry
While procuring more and more ink.
Scribing the same sentence again and again
Will the circle remain unbroken?
