Vodka on your breath.
Heart devoid of dreams.
Hope that left so long ago.
Mangled by paternity.

Wine on your breath.
Mouth full of hate.
Hope that left so long ago.
Mangled by maternity.

The apple falls directly below the tree.
But the tree is dead
Which leaves the apple
Rotten as can be.

Wary me.
Parry me.
Carry me.
Bury me.

(Line approaching line.
End apprehending end.)

Bright futures thrown away
In the name of an escape
Words from aspiring artists
Replaced by silent mouths agape

Nights forgotten,
Vice begotten.

Wary me.
Parry me.
Carry me.
Bury me.

(Line approaching line.
End apprehending end.)

Bereft behest.

An authors voice
Silenced on a blank page.

Numbing the sting
Of inadequacy.
Unfair exchange:
Thought for naught.
Leaning on crutches
Meant for killing slowly
Now you can only bide your time

The apple falls
Directly below the tree
But the tree is dead
Which leaves the apple
Rotten as can be

Rotten.

Fertile, though rotten through.
Germination begins as corrupt seeds
spread their sickness through the landscape;
Infecting all.
