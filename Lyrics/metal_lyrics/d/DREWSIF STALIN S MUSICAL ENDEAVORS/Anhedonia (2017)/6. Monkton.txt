Shadows under my eyes darken with the passing of light.
Warm turns to cold turns to black.
Black remains until warm fights back.

On the warmest days
On the coldest nights
I found my home in your eyes.

Sleep
Would come sporadically,
Waking me erratically.
Inward reflection
Offers the ugliest sight.

I've watched the lines on my face grow like shadows at day's end.
And I've lost control, I wander alone
Until in your eyes, I found my home.

On the warmest days
On the coldest nights
I found my home in your eyes.

And if our happiest moments are truly seldom to linger,
Then I know I've watched them fade away with you.

On the warmest days
On the coldest nights
I found my home in your eyes.
