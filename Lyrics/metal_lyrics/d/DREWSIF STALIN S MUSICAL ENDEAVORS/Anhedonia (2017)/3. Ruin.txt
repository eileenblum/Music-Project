Trapped within the realm of sleep;
A world awake, and I still dream.
If you should find me and I refuse to stir
My reoccurring nightmare has come true:
The lines have blurred.
Be it dreams, be it reality, my subconscious keeps it's foot to my throat.
Please release me from the ties that bind.
There's no escaping this horrible place in my mind.

A place where my doubts and my fears are suspended in time.
Where self-conclusion seems so divine.

A place I would never want to be.
(line approaching line)
The dark, disgusting part of me.
Line approaching line.
End apprehending end
