Incisions
Too shallow
To remove
What ails me
Lacerations
Too meager
To render
(My) Consciousness

Predisposed
Juxtaposed
Undisclosed
Illness throes
Hindering my
Progression
Stagnancy
Defeats me

Despite my best efforts,
This exchange died years ago
So much wasted love and remorse
Spent clinging to the corpse.

Rot.
I will bury the debt,
But I will no longer mourn the dead.
In spite of all of this,
I surely hope your words meant well more often than not.
But either way, I say we let them fucking rot.

(Alone in my thoughts)
Worshiping
My sickness.
Dependence
On sadness
Brings me nothing
But the same
Consequence
Same outcome

Day by day;
Descending.
Sinking deep
Down the drain
No heroics,
Let me drown.
