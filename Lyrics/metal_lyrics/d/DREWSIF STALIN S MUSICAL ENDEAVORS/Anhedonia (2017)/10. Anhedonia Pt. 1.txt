Love of mine
I've come to hate
Such animosity
You create.

Hateful glances at my reflection
To man in the mirror:
I abhor you now
You are the antithesis

I'll now collate,
Reiterate
To deconstruct
And reinstate
My thoughts of you
Remain askew
Despite assuaging, start anew

Discussed in disgust
This distrust
Conceived deceit
Constructs defeat

Alone in my thoughts... again.

Love of mine
I've come to hate
Such animosity
You create.

The thoughts inate
That now gestate
Here I fixate
As I abate.

Hands that used to dance
With fingers intertwined
Now seem to pay advance
No single shred of mind

How far will you lead me and
How far will I lead myself?

To the brink of madness.
Am I the only one at fault?
