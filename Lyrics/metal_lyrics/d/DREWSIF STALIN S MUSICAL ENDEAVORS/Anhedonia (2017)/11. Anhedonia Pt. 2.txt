I'm sinking into myself now
Drowning in speculation and conjecture
Have I lost my mind?
Alone in my thoughts
As time and space
Attempt to erase
Everything I've loved
Anhedonia.

Give me your fear
Give me your doubt
Give me your pain
Give me your name

Give me your hate
Give me your shame
Give me your malice
Give me your jealousy

Line approaching line
End apprehending end
Inching closer and closer
Windows closing
Exhaling impaired judgement
Like father like son
A replica more flawed than the archetype
The apple falls directly below the tree
But the tree is dead
Which leaves the apple rotten as can be.
Hoping desperately my pen runs dry
While procuring more and more ink.
Scribing the same sentence
Again and again
Will the circle remain unbroken?

A good man grows cold.
With every knife
And every arrow
With every obstacle
Some say character is built

A good man grows old
With every failure
And every regret
With every goodbye
Some say he gains wisdom

Here stands our good man, alone, shattered and bleeding
From every mistake
Every betrayal
And every lesson learned
A good man as good as dead.
