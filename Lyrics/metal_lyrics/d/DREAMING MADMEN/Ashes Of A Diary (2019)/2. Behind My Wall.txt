Hear my soul call out, call out your name
You feel it cut deep and nothing's ever the same
Don't try to talk and try to scream, still I can't feel your breath
I'm spiraling down without a sound into the valley of death

Hollow, scarred and chained, roaming dark streets of fears
Never secure and never so true, behind my wall, frail and sheer
While waiting for a call, a knot hung on the wall
And an empty scream alights the air, I slip and fall, no strength at all

Here behind my wall, I crawl as I bleed
Concealed inside it all, I fall as I breathe

Trapped inside this page, a boy lost in a haze
To rid of the worms inside his brain, the rustling sound of a burning page
And when the fire burns out, distant faces will leer
All frail and alone, but hand in hand, they flicker his soul a touch so dear

Here behind my wall, I crawl as I bleed
Hear my fragile call, I fall as I plead
