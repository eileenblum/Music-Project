A lover's gone, a soul is torn
A doctor warns, a mother mourns
A longing curse that cannot be reversed

A burning page, a flaming rage
A rusting boy stuck in a cage
Page by page, deserting all my fears

Ashes of a once lost memory
Burning like a cold immortal fire
Ashes of my once felt sorrow
Rising like a storm in the sky

A sure demise, on a sunset, lies
An endless trial, an empty smile
Forever lost in a homeless isolation

A hopeless try, on a corner cries
An empty shadow
A battle of worlds and demons in disguise
