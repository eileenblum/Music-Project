I feel I've been brought down to the nether
When the hell did we lose our forever
You left and marked your scars on my body
And made me feel like I was just somebody

You hate. You crave. You slaved. You made

Don't come to me in dreams and shed a smile
Dumbfounded, I'll believe you like a simple child
Now the scene's left dark, cold and bloody
But in the end, I'll always be somebody

You lay. You pray. You raised. You saved

Let me out of this vivid nightmare
I found myself, but you're gone, I can't believe it
You are mine and I am yours
You are mine and I am yours
You are mine and I am yours

You are mine and I am yours
