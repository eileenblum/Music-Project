Here we've arrived onto the final page
After all I've tried, after all this time

To see your lovely faces for one more night
Heaven knows if it brings me more sorrow or more joy
Until we meet again, my dear

Tears fall like raindrops from my face
Painted with poems and stories never told before

And it feels just like a dream
Memories of faces come rushing
And I don't know where it leads
But I know we'll meet someday again, my friend

For now, the walls are closing in
The final page is burning
Afraid and alone, my feelings unfold

Until we meet again, my dear...
