I drowned in a world that I've created
Drawn with pencil ink that can't be faded
Don't dare the devil without a fight
While chained down and gambled like a pair of dice, in this hell they call paradise

I wanted to show you the words that I have written
But they're all about you, and that can't sink in
What were you thinking when my loved ones were sinking

Awake, a storm is pouring in
Stop whispering my name so slowly
Locked in a cage, my vision impaired

Bottle of poison chugged and still no sleep
Missing little Jane and Bowie, I calmly weep
No power, no courage, to begin the trial
It'd be much easier if he were just to die
