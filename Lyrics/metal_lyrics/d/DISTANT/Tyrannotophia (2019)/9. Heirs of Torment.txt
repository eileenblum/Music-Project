Crawl from beneath the shadows
Let us take what is rightfully ours
I spread my genocidal wings upon humanity
The new age of torment is about to begin
Enslavement of the mankind
Getting rid of the putrid disease
Reclaiming back the throne of evil
From the grasp of the weak
Our salvation is damnation of men
Guided by the scent of death
How can we ever fell for the savior that you have left cowardly nailed to the cross
How can we ever pray to the one that have lost to mortals - puny human
Nothing but a stupid man-made ideal of the puny god
We were born from hated creating this world, creating me
Subdued by my power, you can no longer resist
There is no escape
You shall get on your knees and bow to me
Count your nails on the cross
Count down the nails

[Lucca Schmerler:]
Blood on my face as they turned the cross upside down and burn my flesh
The salvation has begun
Misery crawls through your streets
As the vultures will circle
I will sacrifice my life on the way to god

Our only salvation is the damnation of men
Guided by the scent of flesh
I bathe in blood of my enemies
I feast on the flesh of the innocent of my enemies
I feast on the flesh of the innocent
Our only salvation is destruction of men
Guided by the scent of flesh
