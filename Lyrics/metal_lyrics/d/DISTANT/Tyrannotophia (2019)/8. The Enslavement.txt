Unable to attain yourself
Mouths stitched shut
With wires of gluttony
Living under the guillotine
We continuously feed the disease
Bound by ropes of greed
We are crucified by lies
A looming tyranny
Ascendancy thriving on the ones agony
A world torn asunder
A place where we're all put under
We're cast into the everlasting coma
Induced by the servility
Watching the plague spreads apart
Burned alive
Dying none the wiser
The blood-stained noose of a wretched false autonomy
Hangs loosely from the gallows
Displayed overtly in the streets
For every coming morrow
A public act of attrition
Left unnoticed by the worlds narrowed visions
And yet it became a part of me
Bow to your embodiment of your fears
Grappled round your throat
You been a victim of the treacherous beliefs
Lost in the unknown
Blindfolded, deaf, mouth sewn shut
Thrown to the mouth of lies
Thrown to the gallows of oblivion
Let the noose knitted of their lies tighten around your neck
Another hangman stares from the gallows
Cautiously watching the world die
Left hanging on noose of your lies
Rotting but kept alive
One by one they hang
At the gallows of oblivion
Watching the world die
Right under their undead feet
