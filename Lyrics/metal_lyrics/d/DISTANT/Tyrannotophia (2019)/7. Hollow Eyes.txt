As I look up
Into the sky
All I see is grey
So this will be goodbye
I just keep smiling away
Preaching to the one that says
Rise up, rise up towards the sky
And watch me crumble
I've put my trust in you
Rise up, rise up towards the sky
And watch me crumble with your blackened eyes
I can't go on, living like this
It feels like I am possessed
But I don't need an exorcist
I just need you to leave
To fucking leave
Go away
You will be nothing to me
I've put my faith in the wrong direction
'Cause I know that when I die
There will be nothing left
There is no escape to a place of fucking love
You are burden
I carry around, the anchor, on my back
You make me feel like my feet are cast from concrete
You try to drag me down but I'm not your slave
Let go of me
You're just another pathetic waste of space
