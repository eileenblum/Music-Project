So sick of being lost in the visions of paradise with crooked meaning
This feeling of the ecstasy, have been all just hypocrisy
Clawing my eyes just to see
Twisted mind crooked soul and yet still cast alone
Screaming to the abyss held upon my soul
Every second in the void I'm losing it all
Step by step he's getting weaker
Waiting for my time to come up,
Take control of all what's holy
Decimate the weak forever
Oh my dear, why you fight it
While we could rule together
There is no other option
Dethrone the king capture the crown
Subconscious empire then shall be mine
No coward has a place to hide
Can't escape this boundless torture of the ones twisted mind
Giving everything 'til your last breath
Will there ever be the last breath?
Can't find your peace at mind, nor even know what is peace
Is there even an end, is there even light?
Cower in fear
Hide in the shadows
Come on out and play
Let me get that well-earned reward
Come on out and play
Oh please, let me be your master
Can't escape this boundless torture of the ones twisted mind
Gasping for your last breath, this one has to be final one
Haven't found your peace at mind, nor even meaning of these lies
There is one end, there is no light
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
