Cast aside of the light
Existence is a lie
We are just soulless vessels
Waiting to be tortured in this everlasting torment
I am your fucking end
Cancerous entity we worship, we believe, we suffer, we worry, we pray to
We are the representation of the torment, the disease and hostility
While the fireâs on, nothing there will bring justice
Weâll be your bitter end
I am unrelenting evil
This world got the better of me
We all strive to be perfect
So Iâll give you the perfect ending
Hammer down the nails through your hands
Upside down,
Hanging above the ground
Black blood pours from your mouth
Putrid mess
Hanging upside down
We are the soulless vessels
Waiting to be tortured in this everlasting torment
I am you bitter end
Cancerous entity we worship, we believe, we suffer, we worry, we pray to
We are the representation of the torment, the disease and hostility
While the fire is on, there will be no justice justice
Blood spills from your eyes as the demons awaken
Burn me up kill me
Sever my entirety
Break my bones as the weight of deaths on me
Feed me this humanity
This entire entity
I will never be subdued to the pain that you have caused my family
Darkest days of life and youâre still a great insanity, this will be the fall of man and pillaging
