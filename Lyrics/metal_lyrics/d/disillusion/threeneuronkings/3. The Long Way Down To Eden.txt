Only one step away from the core
One tiny step to purge the soul
One more vision to shatter

Oh, come sweet dreams
Sweet illusions of a bleak
I see the vipers in the distance
as they come to feed me.

How I long for you, For the fever of your embrace
For the taste of desire

An endless shroud of agony
But still I wallow in its eternity
I see the vipers in the distance
as they come to feed me.

I never reckoned today could bear a light
As I awoke this morning it felt as any other night.
I sense your presence close to me
and every fiber of my feverish body
feeds on your raving shine. 
I never reckoned today could bear a light
As I awoke this morning it felt as any other night.
Torments of Soul released in an instant
A breath with the lungs of a torn
And the heart of an infant.	What a content sentiment it was
To lay beside her, her sweet caress.

"How I longed for you,
For the fever of your embrace
For the taste of desire"

An endless shroud of agony
But still I wallow in its eternity
I see the vipers in the distance
as they come to feed me.

Another night has settled, another day had passed
Another cry I spilled, another tear at night.

"This is the long way down to Eden"
I heared her say when she left,"
But what is the way, 
what must I know before to walk it?" 
"That nothing is certain, but uncertainty!".

I never reckoned today could bear a light
As I awoke this morning it felt as any other night.
I sense your presence close to me
and every fiber of my feverish body
feeds on your raving shine.
I never reckoned today could bear a light 
As I awoke this morning it felt as any other night.
