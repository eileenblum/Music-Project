Say, why do you lie
Forgot to stand the truth - 
The truth paralized
Say, why don't you cry
Your tears scream as loud
As you fight your doubts

[Chorus]
Painkiller - 
Sore I lay down here
Painkiller - 
Make me live with my fears

With your
Endless stupid excuses,
You're who confuses
Your own self-confidence
Victim of your praised system
That you've built for defense
Of experience
Pain to your face
Stop the disgrace
Pray for yourself and stay,
Be the man
Who won't croak anymore
Now it comes over you
My friend - NOW

[Chorus]

Weakness - Don't Speak
