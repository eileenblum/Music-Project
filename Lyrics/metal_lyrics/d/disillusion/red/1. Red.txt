Feel me, the pain is mine
Give up, won't see no sign
God that's me on the throne
Above you on my own

[Chorus]
I'll lead you to the place
Where you can see
My real face
The things you know regret - 
Despair is strangling you
Dancing in red

See me laughing
About your care
Your pictures much too fair
Promises were raped by me
Your mind in haze - 
Too dark to see

[Chorus]

I am evil, can't you see
Your purity, your honest zeal
Your weakness and your being
Make me sick
And one day
I'll break your neck

[Chorus]
