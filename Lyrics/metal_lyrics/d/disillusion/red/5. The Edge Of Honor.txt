We are watching the birth of a cliff
Do you want up, it wears you out
And though you never
Want to be in the water
You fall with a mistaken step

[Chorus]
Open your eyes!
Where do you see yourself?
Raise your arms and fly high
Above the now

Can you swim
In the flow of desperation?
Cause if you can't you will drown
Can you stand filled with honor?
Cause If you can't
You will be pushed down

[Chorus]

Can you feel the strength beneath,
Can you see beyond your fears?
And when you find this solid dream
Then raise your arms
And learn to fly!
