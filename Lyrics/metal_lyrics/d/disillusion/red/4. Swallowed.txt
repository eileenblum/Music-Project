Free seem the clouds
Free from restrain
How they roam through my mind

How they roam through my mind,
Through the years

Their shadow laid upon me
Swallowed the laughter
I wore today

[Chorus]
For all the love
And all the fears
Beneath my wings,
I'd trade in all that I know

Low lies the breath
Like a grey dust over sea
Like a snare - so tight
Only a waiting slave

And the sand runs way too fast,
Way too fast through my hands

[Chorus]

And low lies the breath,
Like a grey dust over sea
And here I lay all swallowed

[Chorus]
