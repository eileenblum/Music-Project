I am back at last from yearning slumber
when the nightly drama came to a close
Hoping that fall will never come
Salute the morning sun
Inviting us to idleness
Hoping that fall will never come
The hour calls for secrecy
When silently, we'd slip out into the lake
Hoping that fall will never come.
And I stumble as of vertigo
Can't await the sound of gentle waves
melting with the rhythm of our crave.

But today there are only elegies
Filling our tainted elysium
Still hoping that fall will never come
This place turned to a fraud mirage
Deceitful and untrue.
Still hoping that fall will never come
Embraces solace me
They hide my tears in pastel drapery
Still hoping that fall will never come.
And I cry just like you
Knowing this is coming to an end.
But still I am hoping that fall will never come.

But it came.
