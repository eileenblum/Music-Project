It came from dismal shadows
Creeping, sudden, from behind.
fell upon my merry whistle
darkened me at heart and sight.
Back with me, one again with the memory
Again I behold the ruins
that I left when I was all devoured by wrath.

Last night out in the timber
A thousand torrentsâ vehemence
came rushing through my veins
Up my throat and filled the eyes,
And then that I knew
all pain will be undone
When I pack my bags
And depart for lonely roads

And with courageous verve I stride
Chopping the heads off plants aside, wondering

How come you never bleed
When I stab right into your back?
How come you never choke
When I drown you in the sea?

Merely hours passed
that I had left him to his mountains
his colossal idols - one for every spear in me.
Slopes so steep,
I could not conquer in a lifetime.
Now they're all but ruins,
Ruins I left behind.

And with courageous verve I stride
Chopping the heads off plants aside, still wondering

How come you never bleed
When I stab right into your back?
How come you never choke
When I drown you in the hot and burning sea?

There is always one waiting for me, my beloved
I shall be with her again so soon.
Iâm craving for her lips, her kiss
Her hair in summer winds
The morning dew dripping down her breasts.

Shadows and Flames.

I have been demure
Cries were silent but heart ablaze.
have been one of his shadows
Condemned to stray an unlit maze.
My feet are numb, soles torn wide open
After endless years of clambering
My path is lit and leads me north.

And with courageous verve I stride
Chopping the heads off plants aside, still wondering

How come you never bleed
When I stab right into your back?
How come you never choke
When I drown you in the hot and burning sea?
