So here we stand the day has come
The hit was hard and long the run
And as long as it might take me
I want to come home to the place to go

Got a note that said itâs overdue
Had a thought but too much else to do
And whatâs left now is all but quicksand
And I want to come home to the place to go

In knew itâd come eventually
The letter folded carefully
And for all itâs worth I missed you too
And coming back home to the place to go

Here we go and save the past
Up the sails we are off at last
Here we go and save the past
Starboards on weâre off at last

Is it true that she went silently
In the end that she went peacefully
And for all itâs worth I miss her too
And coming back home

Here we go and save the past

Here we are the day has come
The cypress grow with words of mourn
What is left now is all but quicksand
And I want to come home to the place to go

Here we go and save the past
Up the sails we are off at last
Here we go and save the past
Starboards on weâre off at last

So here we stand the day has come
The hit was hard and long the run
And as long it might take me
I want to come home

Got a note that said itâs overdue
Had a thought but too much else to do
And whatâs left now is all but quicksand
And I want to come home to the place to go

Here we go and save the past
Up the sails we are off at last
Here we go and save the past
Starboards on weâre off

Here we go and save the past
Havenât I saved it all at last?
Here we go and save the past
Havenât I saved it all at last?
Here we go and save the past
Havenât I saved it all at last?
Here we go and save the past
Havenât I saved it all at last?
