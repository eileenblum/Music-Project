Round and round the rumours fly
Your promises were just a lie
The handshake made you shiver
That I could tell clearly I was standing right behind you

Today it all went up into the blue
Not quite far enough you promised us the moon

Suddenly it became absolutely evident
A mocking bird, a pointed grin
The masquerade was growing thin
The laugh is always on the loser

Today it all went up into the blue
Not quite far enough you promised us the moon

Hence with you away your sun has set
Pack your things and beings
And never ever come back
Hence with you away your sun has set
Pack your things and beings
You promised something you simply could not keep

undisputed. A midnight grief
And I know you cannot sleep either
For the fear of, uhm, waking up
Dread it

Today it all went up into the blue
Not quite far enough you promised us the moon

Hence with you away your sun has set
Pack your things and beings
And never ever come back
Godspeed to the con man
Farewell! Donât think we will beckon
You promised something that you could not keep

Hence with you away your sun has set
Pack your things and beings
And never ever come back
Godspeed to the con man
Farewell! Donât think we will beckon
You promised something that you could not keep
