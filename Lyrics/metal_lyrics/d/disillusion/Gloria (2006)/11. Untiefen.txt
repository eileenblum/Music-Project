This is not some stupid quest
Siblings come in pairs and nothing less
I wish I was second best
But that seems to be unlikely and nothing less

This is not some stupid quest
two in the womb of an empress
I wish I was second best
But that seems to be unlikely and nothing less

This is not some stupid quest
The hour has grown late, late at last
The line grows thin with every breath
A twinkle in the shallows, in the depths

This is not some stupid quest
I just want to fly beyond the crest
Take some time for a 2nd guess
Time is running short to make me second best

This is not some stupid quest
A twinkle in the shallows, in the depths
The line grew thin with every breath
And then came to rest
Four seconds past.
