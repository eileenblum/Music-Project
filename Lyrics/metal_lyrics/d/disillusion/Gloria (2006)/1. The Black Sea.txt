There is dancing in the sea
Shadows move they just canât be real
Shadows go and you are left with me
Take a step and feel the sea

Come flee let the sea be sea
Come I know that you strive for me
Nothing here to threaten thee
Come inside and follow me

Let your breath go and swim with me
Let your breath go and swim with me

There is a fire in the sea
That pulls you close arbitrary
One more step donât waver now
Break the deadlock and avow

Come flee let the sea be sea
Come I know that you strive for me
Nothing here to threaten thee
Come inside and follow me

Let your breath go and swim with me
Let your breath go and swim with me

We are dancing in the sea
We are the shadows in the unreal
We are the fire in the sea
Come closer and follow me
We are dancing in the sea
We are the shadows in the unreal
We are the fire in the sea
Come close now and feel the sea

Let your breath go and swim with me
Let your breath go and swim with me
