Build me a tomb a sarcophagus
Something to look forward to
In the end when all comes down

Take what you cannot take
And hide what you cannot hide
Then silence me forevermore

I can hear the hangmen come
No delay
Build me something to look forward to

I have no regrets no failure inside me
Weathered all intrigues
Reason comes when pity goes
The shades went down, down in the lather
Lend me your tears and weâll defy whatever
Why now should I feel ashamed?

Build me a tomb a sarcophagus
Something to look forward to
In the end when all comes down

Weep with the call
With the fading with the avalanche
I am going now

To be waiting in silence forever
And ever dreaming, elevating
Fall for sweetest of dreams
Without awakening

And Iâll be waiting in silence forever
And ever dreaming, elevating
Fall for sweetest of dreams
Without awakening
No awakening

Iâll be waiting in silence forever
And ever dreaming, elevating
Fall for sweetest of dreams
Without awakening

And Iâll be waiting in silence forever
And ever dreaming, elevating
Fall for sweetest of dreams
Without awakening

Iâll be waiting in silence forever
And ever dreaming, elevating
Fall for sweetest of dreams
Without awakening

And Iâll be waiting in silence forever
And ever dreaming, elevating
Fall for sweetest of dreams
Without awakening
No awakening
