Itâs warlike in the streetlight
And we elbow our way through the pale night
It is everybody elseâs dream
But not mine, Iâm not that kind
Itâs warlike in the streetlight
And things go a little impolite
What I said I wonât remember
But the answer kicked the flame

Itâs warlike in the streetlight
And we elbow our way through the pale night
Itâs warlike in the streetlight
And we elbow our way through the pale night
Itâs warlike, warlike
Warlike, warlike
Warlike, warlike

The snap lock and the peacock
Librettos never promised that much luck
Push always comes to shove and
Weâre dancing in red and blue corners

The bomb dropped and the horde rocked
Boom they all know I got knocked
Itâs me against the 7 dwarfs
Yea, call it a setback

And everything she wove for me
And everything she wove for me
And everything she wove for me
And everything she wove for me

Itâs warlike in the streetlight
And we elbow our way through the pale night
Itâs warlike in the streetlight
And we elbow our way through the pale night
Itâs warlike, warlike
Warlike, warlike
Warlike, warlike

You tie everyone around you
A little fling
You pull the strings
And take them all down.
You tie everyone around you
Just no thing
To mask the sling
Then take them all down.

Itâs warlike in the streetlight
And we elbow our way through the pale night
It is everybody elseâs dream
But not mine, Iâm not that kind
Itâs warlike in the streetlight
And things go a little impolite
What I said I wonât remember
But the answer kicked the flame
Itâs warlike in the streetlight
Itâs warlike in the streetlight

You tie everyone around you
A little fling
You pull the strings
And take me down.
You tie everyone around you
A little fling
You pull the strings
And take me down.
You tie everyone around you
A little fling
You pull the strings
And take them all down.
You tie everyone around you
Just no thing
To mask the sling
Then take them all down.

Itâs warlike in the streetlight
And we elbow our way through the pale night
It is everybody elseâs dream
But not mine, Iâm not that kind
Itâs warlike in the streetlight
And things go a little impolite
What I said I wonât remember
But the answer kicked the flame
Itâs warlike in the streetlight
Itâs warlike in the streetlight
