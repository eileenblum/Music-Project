Counting sheep leaps
But keep the gun while in dreams in the sun
Some reason in our tedious Inn
Our tedious Inn.

I know they'll come for me
Iâm sure this wonât end peacefully
theyâll not come peacefully
I know they'll come for me
And all Iâll do is laugh â¦

Our garden bears a morbid seed to grow
Nursed with tears and boredom, uncounted broken hopes

I know they'll come for me
I know they will be back for me
I know they'll come for me
And all Iâll do is laugh â¦

It is written in my eyes
Cast into my forehead
A smile just wonât disguise
The end of all your pale dreams
It is written in my eyes
Cast into my forehead
A smile just wonât disguise
The end of all our pale dreams

The scent of lilies is sweeping though the room
Descent of joyful days but now they are in bloom

I know they'll come for me
I see this wonât end peacefully
I know they'll come for me
And all Iâll do is laugh

It is written in your eyes
Cast into your forehead
A smile just wonât disguise
The end of all your pale dreams
It is written in your eyes
Cast into your forehead
A smile just wonât disguise
The end of all your pale dreams

Our garden bears a morbid seed to grow
Nursed with tears and lies, myriads of broken hopes
Our garden bears a morbid seed to grow
Nursed with tears and lies, myriads of broken hopes

Whatever we have done it all came down to whispers
Forgotten. Gone. A long lapsed fierce embrace
What happened here, what happened then, the scope grew thin, glares narrowed in
Whatever we have done it all came down to whispers

Now let me go and face the insult.
Now let me go and face the insult.
Now let me go and face the insult.
Now let me go and face the insult.
Now let me go and face the insult.
Now let me go.

It is written in my eyes
Cast into my forehead
A smile just wonât disguise
The end of all your pale dreams
It is written in your eyes
Cast into your forehead
A smile just wonât disguise
The end of all your pale dreams
