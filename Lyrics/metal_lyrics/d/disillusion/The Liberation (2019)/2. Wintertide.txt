I am an echo
A lightless beacon in a cutting storm
An empty shell within a maze straying back and forth
A thought never vanished
A wound that would never heal

Have been northbound
Months and years in hiemal
Winds that bite like spells - briskly they enfold
The leafless tree
This will be the end of all

Endless nights, a barren heart
In dreadful morrow - defoliation
And here I am in my wintertide of faith
What have I become? - I am a shadow!

A relentless mirage
Dire circles of reminiscence
So distant now what once did lie so clear at hands
A rout I can't atone
A wound that would never heal

Counting hours - years in desolate
Who chose failure - now will have to live with it
Dreams ignite! And die - by the fireside

And in night-time longing and wintertide reveries
In a slumber, in a dream, in the glistening white I see
In night-time longing and wintertide reveries
In the welkin, in a breeze, in crystalline euphony

Believe!

But tonight only clamor and dismay are echoing
Over firn and ice and back they bring
All them voices muttering of chagrin and defeat
Was in reach of orb an crown
Could be king to the fire
Could have ruled in purple gown
Now all that's left is ire

Believe!

A dismal truth
Innards that no sun has ever seen
No further tales will ever sever
The hour is growing late for the weak and faint-at-heart
A comfort never earned, deserved

Coward!

Frail. Deceit. Defeat.

This is the end of all.

In my woe. A world aglow. Let go of me

Dreams ignite. And then they die
Let go of me. Forever and a day.
Right here, this will be the end of you
A feather to the four winds
A sparrow to the sun

In my woe. A world aglow. Let go of me. Let go of me.
Dreams ignite. And then they die. Let go of me.

In night-time longing and wintertide reveries
In a slumber, in a dream, in the glistening white I see
In night-time longing, wintertide reveries
In the welkin, in a breeze, in crystalline euphony

Whenever I close my eyes
And stare into the sun
Whenever in memories
Through golden fields we run

In every waking sleep
In every time of need
Whenever the soul will weep
Carry on!

Here in my wintertide of faith
