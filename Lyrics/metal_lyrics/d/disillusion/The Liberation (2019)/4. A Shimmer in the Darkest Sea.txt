Once I notices a shimmer in the darkest sea
I'd hold my breath and dive so deep
A light I did find that will ever shine for me

Locked it up inside, made it mine
Kept it hidden from the world
Held on tight, don't let go
Below the mountain spur
The darkest light for no one else to see
And it shall ever shine for me!

My hands are cold, my soul it feeds
On failure and catastrophe
My silence sings an endless song
It weeps until the morning comes
Let water run let water sough
And gently hollow out the stones
Let silence be an endless see
Forever. Let go of me

How come I am always ending up
Where I started so long ago
Will this path that I took ever see the day?
The more things change the more they stay the same

Locked it up inside, made it mine
Kept it hidden from the world
Held on tight, don't let go
Below the mountain spur
The darkest light for no one else to see
And it shall ever shine for me!

My hands are cold, my soul it feeds
On failure and catastrophe
My silence sings an endless song
It weeps until the morning comes
Let water run let water sough
Carve every word I say in stone
Let silence be an endless see

Forever
Let go
Of me
