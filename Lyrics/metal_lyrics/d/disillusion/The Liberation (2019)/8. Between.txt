[Bonus Track]What are the words
Can't read between the lines
Only an hour left to cover for weeks

And seasons pass by with the winds
Too much unspoken on the wings of the night

We are...

Passengers
Riding across the sea
For all I know
We will miss again

You find yourself in backwoods and the cold
Unfold
All crossing lead the same

The trees are whispering the way to go
A lure in covert down this winding road

We are...

Passengers
Riding across the sea
For all I know
We will miss again

What happened here will never go away
From nightfall til the early break of day
And this our life I fear it whirls astray
I see.

I know.
