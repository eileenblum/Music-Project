...and the fires burn with mere confabulation
Cast their flames into the wide
Draw an image of summer
That so long I put aside

Is this to be my fate?
To linger here in wait
To be a lightless beacon in a cutting storm?

Who are you to challenge my faith?
Demon of the flames
Who are you to brand your heart anew
Into the canvas of my heart

It laid dormant with the highest expectations
Ancient temple to the light
Chant the praises of a dawning
Through the fire came the mourn

Free of consternation
Ascending to depart
Clear of all the veiling
The end for the weak at heart

Are you forever my dancer in the dark?
Spirit and the spark
Are you forever the mirror without veil?
That kind that helps me see

Beneath the calm beyond facades
Tempests rage and scream for liberation
Cast my fist into the ground
Break the ice and melt the firn
Whatever word now shout it out
Spin and turn and run with open lungs
Gasping for another breath
Open up the soul
Condone and forgive

And turn your eyes to the sea
And give your thoughts to the breeze

And higher and higher and higher I go
And deeper and deeper and deeper the flow
And higher and higher and higher we go
And deeper and deeper and deeper we fall

So, what if all your dreams would slowly wither
And with time were to pass away
What if all the paths that you took would sliver
And you feel you were led astray
What if all your chances never taken
Were to fade and disappear
What if all your dreams were disillusioned
And you feel you were led astray

A breeze, we drift, like vessels, across the seas
In gales, we are carried, beyond,
The great unknown, let go

Set sails for new and distant shores
My dancer in the dark
Let's leave this place without a name
Today we will embark
The oceans sighs - allying
All remains unclear
The beginning of the end
In time we disappear

Beneath the calm beyond facades
Under heaven's morrowsun
In whispers and with seagull tongue
A tale is being sung
What is the dark, what is the night
Shadows around you
The beginning of the end they sing
And time ... will disappear

Set sails for new and distant shores
My dancer in the dark
Let's leave this place without a name
Today we will embark
What is the dark, what is the night
Shadows around you
Why not take heart in this new day?
A new dawn draws near

Away with shadows
No silent maybe!
From glen to glen from sea to sea
In solitude I wander
Drifting across the sea
A new dawn draws near

And higher and higher and higher I go
And deeper and deeper and deeper the flow
And higher and higher and higher we go
And deeper and deeper and deeper we fall

So, what if all your dreams would slowly wither
And with time were to pass away
What if all the paths that you took would sliver
And you feel you were led astray
What if all your chances never taken
Were to fade and disappear
What if all your dreams were disillusioned
And you feel you were led astray
