I bid you farewell, old friend
I'm leaving now
Good night and everlong dreams of the stars
Our lonesome paths are ending here
In the void and blackest snow
My voice is mute - your limbs are numb

I know your grief, your scorn,
The ties around your chest
The gelid air you breathe from gorge to crest
You persevered with ardent zeal and fortitude
I thank you so
But today I go

In everlasting evenfall
Where do we go
What do we know

Our river runs in vertigo
Where will it flow?
What do we know?

I embrace this day, alas you stay,
No more words I want to hear
I know your tongue and binds
Belief will break the weir
And then I turn, and dare to depart from here
I thank you so
From soul to soul
I thank you so
Now I leave you to your nothingness!

Nothing.

Tonight we are like stars revolving
Tonight we are in deepest craving
Tonight we light the empyrean

Where were you?

On nightward ways once upon another life
How can I even dare to return?
With assumptions in the air I can't breathe -
Dismiss - eliminate
We are one - our hearts are shattered

I hypothesize: the coming of the end
Cast your wishes to solstice fires and pretend
That you know- no! you don't know anything
Just breathe
This does not mean you're a betrayer!

Betrayer
GÃ³ra

What do you know?

And thaw sets in at evenfall
What do you know
A world aglow

Our rivers run in vertigo
Where will they go?
What do you know?
