With the morning sun came a sadness
Swift and silent. took luster and pride
Bereaved and forlorn, abiding the torment bright

It sparked outrage. Condemnation
Discaged flame to fire and heart
Let loose all of fetters, restraints and poses demure!

Turn your head now! To the sun
Turn your head now...

And run!

Over hills and mountainside
To the crests of monuments - rise to the sky
From glen to glen, from sea to sea
All burden shall perish, all doubt recoil
May your feet stamp all failures into soil
And cast all shadows far far away

Turn your head now! To the sun.
Turn your eye now! become undone

I'm staring at the firmament
From mires of regrets
The morning turns no pages blank
All remains unsaid
What have you done to me?

What lies beyond?
The great unknown
Cast your doubts into the wind
From glen to glen
From sea to sea
Pull me under
What have you done

Turn your eye now! to the sun

There are places in the vast and the unknown
I dare not ever see
How can I chase away all these fears
Of night has come the day
Keep all gates closed and lights dim in eclipse
Cause all I want is stay
And never leave
The brave new me
Vanished in the morning light
With no return at night

Brave new me - ha - afraid of things that he cannot see

I'm staring at the firmament
From mires of regrets
The morning turns no pages blank
All remains unsaid
What have you done to me?
What lies beyond? the great unknown cast your doubts into the wind
From glen to glen
From sea to sea
Pull me under
What have you done

To see what lies beyond this daunting ridge?
Lands of fire and demise?
And what if there were just another morrow waiting
In fraud and disguise?
