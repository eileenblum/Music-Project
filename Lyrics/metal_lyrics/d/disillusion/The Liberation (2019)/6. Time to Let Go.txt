Whatever we agreed on
Whatever we declined
Whatever we were dreaming of
Dancing in the glow of the sun
We are seasons ever passing
Harbors to the sea
The tides keep receding
And everything will drift away

In time we will reconcile
A halt without and end

It's time to let go
This was a fallacy
A dream in the dark
Time to let go
Shadows and mystery

In a maze of moments
Wandering in need
Begins a new beginning
In the shades of long gone days

Still wrapped in echoes
You stare across the sea
Turn to new horizons
Wherever they lead
You will see

And time will reconcile
A halt without and end

It's time to let go
This was a fallacy
A dream in the dark
Time to let go
Your demons and misery

It's time to let go
This was a fallacy
Let it drift away
Time to let go
The wintery heart will sail

Forever. Staring beady eyes and sunken cheeks
Barren lands, broken hopes and blackened leaves

At night everything will drift away
Tonight everything will drift away

Forever. Staring beady eyes and sunken cheeks
Barren lands, broken hopes
It's time to sail away.

It's time to let go
This was a fallacy
A dream in the dark
Time to let go
Demons and misery

Wherever we roam
Wherever we go ashore
Let it all drift away
Time to let go
The wintery heart will sail
