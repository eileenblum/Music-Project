[Music: Setesh, Nimerius,  lyrics: Setesh]

By "light" and fear
They've closed our eyes
To the power that was always here
Each time I lived, each time I died
But now I know the why

An essence so black flows in my veins
The stars align again with the scorching constellation

My eyes are open wide
Pupils mirror the Aeon
My name was Hae...the Keys are mine...

Imposters shall weep their lands
Their sun-god is no more!

"The chosen, the few, the Children of Stars
All they rise, awaken at last, to form the
Ichor Shrine Synagogue!"

They yield in fear
True faces are revealed
They were always here
Each time I lived, each time I died
But now I know the why

"Gather before the golden Altar of Impiety
Awe is the first step prior to Attainment..."

Utilizing an array of Mirrors I was able to see
The dark aura that flows through this cosmic endless sea

The stars align again with the scorching constellation
My name is Hae...I give the Key to you!
