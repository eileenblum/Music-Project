[Music: Nimerius, IakChaos, Setesh, Nazfell,  lyrics: Setesh]

I've walked so far beyond the Veil
Along the trail that led beneath
The Mist protects my secrets
That lie naked for the world to see

Myriad candles have melt
As I've searched for thine words
Deep in caverns where only the weak
Nocturnal eyes witness the Mysteries

"This Abyss is endless,
I can see no way out...
But what have I become
Who am I?"

Ruins so old, megalithic structures
Stairs leading down below the surface
The Mist protects my secrets
That lie naked for the strong to see

The north wind whispered echoes of the past
Phantoms I've left to wander this place
To guide my future incarnations
So they can reach the deepest chambers

This life, this place, this curse...this glory!

The trail suddenly stops on solid walls...

"Every step I took into this Abyss, led further into darkness
Perceiving the Negative Light I accepted All that Is
My consciousness was thus made perfect!"

I open wide the doors, the sinister faces have waited me so long...
