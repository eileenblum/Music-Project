[Music: Setesh, Nazfell,  lyrics: Setesh, Nazfell]

Arisen moved therefore unto His servants:
"Show yourselves in Power and make Me a strong Seething
For I am of Him that lives forever...

Rise! Under the Blaze of midnight forest's Moon
Wolves howl the Rites of the Night
I dress with my lust the reminiscence of His sacrifice!
Sinking my Hands in the Fog
I weave the Symbols to open the Gates

"With might stroke the heavens with fire,
Unholy winds, plague rotting fields,
Hymns of witchcraft's spells and witches' haunting cries
Bone and Flesh torn apart, the Scent of Death will always turn to Art
Every blessed Deed!"

Hear! The midnight howling carried by the Wind
Cold by the snow the Path goes on implacable
"And on to the Devil my wretched Soul I bear!"

"Look above me: Celestial bodies are held within the Embrace of Forces Unseen
That shape the Fabric that you call reality"
The Theurgist embraced their Mysteries

"Coloring the canvas with the shades of white
This never-ending painting
Is all that I see, all that exists
My only destiny"

The Theurgist embraced their Mysteries
Once immense Current devouring itself
Where Destiny is the purest Liberation

My Will shall be the Destination
