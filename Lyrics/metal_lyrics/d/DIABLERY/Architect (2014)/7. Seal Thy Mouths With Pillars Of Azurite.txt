[Music: Setesh, Nimerius,  lyrics: Setesh, Nimerius]

"Let them grasp the Shape of the Universe
For it is This which moves under the One Will
And this motion brings ascension
When ascension brings unity"

A voice unleashed by all cardinal points
Is now dissolving the silence
Igniting every mouth that will breathe in
Its fierce vibrational purity

Eyes looking upwards
The Ajna is open

"The last phase in the Cycle of Man,
The eclipse of his feeble, so-called God 
Initiate the withering of Cosmos
His eyes open for the first time as if thousand years meant nothing"

I float alone inside a vortex lying out of space and out of time
My lives have formed a trail of fire leading to the abode of my Self
as He speaks: "Embrace this torment, accept my Light and
Seal thy Mouths with Pillars of Azurite!"

Frantic movements disperse the dense ceremonial incense...

"I am the Source that nourishes the Tree of Life
Even if you all perceive as malignant my Essence
The impure Lead shall turn to Gold
Destructive forces always held the alchemic powers of creation"
