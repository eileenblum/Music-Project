[Music: Setesh, Nazfell,  lyrics: Setesh, Nimerius]

All is dead, all is lost
Lo! The Sun descends the sky
All is fading, all is gone
The Great Upheaval has at last begun
Thrice he passes the incense from the pile of Bones
Forsaken is no more the memory of the Eternal Vows

"Hidden in the Spiral Movement
Is the Key of Manifestation 
Blessed are those aware of the Cosmic Channel
and worthy to enter the Congregation"

Here I stand a sworn enemy of this world
Which is festering pathetic for so long
The Key I forge into the Pyre
Set aflame by those who see
Thine promised eternity

Dark waters reflect the skies
Sending their gleam into my fiery eyes
"What truths are held by the Waters, by the Stars
and what by the Light?"

Still a sworn enemy of this world 
Which is lingering pathetic for so long
The Key I forge into the Pyre
Fueled by those who failed to gaze 
This new divinity

"I offer this Empire to You, Architect of Manifestations!"

The essence of the Truth eclipses Sun from sight
Perfecting the Darkness now in a different Light
In every density His code already dwells
Reflecting the Cosmos inside the very cells
Harmonic formations extend towards every direction of Space-Time
All orchestrated by the Code of the Architect.
