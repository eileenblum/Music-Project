[Music: Nimerius, Setesh,  lyrics: Setesh]

Thine Light is unbearable
But it is an honour indeed
To let It burn my life
So that true potential can arise from the ashes

Gathered from a multitude of dimensions
They bound their fates with mine!

Silent are the stars, vacant graves sailing the void unfailingly...

Brighter than a thousand suns
Your Darkness permeates my being
Bearer of the endless gifts
That mortal hands cannot grasp

Trembling moans, cries of despair
The time is close now, the Aeon is borned

Behold! The Aeon is born!

"I am He who calls for no prayers but devotion
To unfold the key, the Sevenfold Key, and its limitless powers"

"There is no door amongst the stones of the Earth
Yet a gate is formed for those who know, who will and who dare
And those who keep silent..."

Blackness enshrouds this congregation...

Empires fall and oceans swallow mountains
Perpetually for endless millennia

The Soul is trapped inside the walls of impotence
Faceless as the voice of Cosmos
Stares the emptiness into the center of the Eye!
