Night of the dark Sacrifice
I sink my glowing wings
In the fire of the nocturnal skies
From my own ashes I shall reborn..
(with ancient power I shall rule)
..the Ursa Major astral kingdom!

I shall remain, I will prevail
The universe I will dominate
I shall remain, I will prevail
Beyond the cosmic rules

Reclaim the glory that is lost
Unleash your demons of the frost
The great new dimension
will born the army of the astral order
The Chariot of the Black Light will appear!
