I am the seeker of might
Through these years of decay
Bloody passage beyond
Drives you to the Light

Through the darkness I walk
Lord I was and Lord I am
Majesty! I glow in the Rot
Bow to the kings of grief

..We are immortals,
We live for eternity,
Giving the flesh, earning morality
We rule to the skies..

âThe first Light of Gnosis
Destroyed their lies,
Unveiled the Vanity of so-called Darkness
Only through this Light
One can see
Abyss derives truly from Withinâ

These are the days of grief
Christians worship a cross
Now Iâve reached myself to the edge
Now remember this Pledge

These are the days of grief
Christians worship the fucking cross
Heaven is blazing for them
Your god will never rise again

I am the seeker of might
Through the years of decay
Bloody passage beyond
Drives you to the Light
