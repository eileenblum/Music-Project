Black eyes staring - Dead long ago
Empty, gazing the torment of the weak shell
Crush humanity under the Scepter of Malice!

We are the heirs of His crown
Demission of the heads to the weak
we are the lords of the utter dread
Eternal night descending and Moon of Forever
..And Moon of Forever..

âI was Attila,
I was the Legion,
I was in Judas,
Behold the truthâ

At the night of the final battle
Thousands of Christians will die in sin
the bible of creation will be burned
No more lies from the followers of gospel
..And Moon of Forever..
