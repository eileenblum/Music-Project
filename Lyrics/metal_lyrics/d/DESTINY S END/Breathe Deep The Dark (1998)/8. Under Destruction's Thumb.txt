Breaking the silence: lonely screams that can't be heard
Casting the shadows, in your mind his spoken word
Famine and wars, prophecies are said and done
It's growing black, blackening.
Where's the sun? Where's the sun? Where has it gone?
Can you believe all forms of life just die
Atomic fate will show our eyes

Here lies the sad reality
Insight that saw forbidden destiny
A vision saw what was to come
Time is now under destruction's thumb

[Lead: Perry]

The eyes that saw tomorrow
Leads us to the road of sorrow

[Lead: Dan]

Echoes of thunder shout across the reddened sky
So in an instant existence will die
All for the power, money and its lust
Our politicians return us to dust

Here lies the sad reality
Insight that saw forbidden destiny
A vision saw what was to come
Time is now under destruction's thumb
Under its thumb...
