Searching for answers still unfound
Words and lies keep going round
Will I find the golden way?
Feeling lied, feeling betrayed

The times I've tried, the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied
The times I've tried, the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied

When I look up to the skies
Is there someone out there?
When it's time to say goodbye
Where do we go when we die?

Only knowing what you fear
Always fearing what you know
If you speak the thoughts you hide
You're an outcast being denied

The times I've tried, the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied
The times I've tried, the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied

When I look up to the skies
Is there someone out there?
When it's time to say goodbye
Where do we go when we die?

The times I've tried, the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied
The times I've tried, the times I've cried
For the ones who've always lied

When I look up to the skies
Is there someone out there?
When it's time to say goodbye
Where do we go when we die?
Where do we go?
