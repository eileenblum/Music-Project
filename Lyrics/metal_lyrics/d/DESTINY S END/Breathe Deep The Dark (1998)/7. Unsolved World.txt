Our every future has been foretold
The contradictions are growing old
Into the unknown we all were born
Suspense eats away, inside we're torn

An unsolved world before us lies
Our backs against the wall
A sea of teardrops will drown our days
We must endure them all
The hurt's forever, the endless search
Who'll free us from the pain?

[Lead: Perry]

A million questions have filled my head
That won't be answered until I'm dead
Then all life's secrets unfold they say
The mystery, was there another way?

An unsolved world before us lies
Our backs against the wall
A sea of teardrops will drown our days
We must endure them all
The hurt's forever, the endless search
Who'll free us from the pain?

[Lead: Dan, Perry]

An unsolved world before us lies
Our backs against the wall
A sea of teardrops will drown our days
We must endure them all
The hurt's forever, the endless search
Who'll free us from the pain?
