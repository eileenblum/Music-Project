[Inspired by the tale "The Fortress Unvanquishable Save For Sacnoth" by Lord Dunsany]

Night is the enemy men falsely perceive
Chasing pale spectres through a world within dreams
Fear is the catalyst to warp frail minds
At twilight's stroke phantoms besiege
Waking dreamers fall to an abyss of stars

Marching through the darkness where heroes always die
Comets blaze the way to nightmare's return
On feverish wings the creatures they fly
Fortress of dreams invincible you are

Fortress Unvanquishable - free my mind
Fortress Unvanquishable - let me dream

When darkness falls our faith dispells
Strength will break through castle walls
Illusions of peace are dwelling behind
Conquer savagery; time enacts its toll
Mundane is the curse others fail to see
Empty is the sky for those who cannot dream

Fortress Unvanquishable - free my mind
Fortress Unvanquishable - let me dream

Facing immortals shadows
Seeking the fortress tall
Escape the stark reality
Eternal, your quest of dreams

[Lead: Perry]

Men spin their tales of ages past
Leaves turning to ash, old legends die
Fear is the catalyst to warp frail minds
In lands beyond sleep, fleeing lost truths
Comets blaze the way to nightmare's return
Fortress of dreams invincible you are

Fortress Unvanquishable - free my mind
Fortress Unvanquishable - let me dream
