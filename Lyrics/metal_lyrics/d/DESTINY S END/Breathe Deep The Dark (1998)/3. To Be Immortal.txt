Man or a myth, I've been shaped by the hands of the master
Fiction or fraud, my path has been laid in this manner
Pride of creation, a god in the eyes that would view me

Forever - alone with the fears and the haunts that pursue me

King of all kings
From atop this throne I shall reign
Just fuel for my fire, the ones that shall stand in my way
Born to this legend, must I rise to such unholy ranks
A legion behind me, we march towards this life I must claim

Eternity becomes my destiny
Eternity brings serenity

I believe the hand of fate is guiding me
Be not deceived, false gods and their treachery

[Leads: Dan, Perry]

Alone I stand this world that I have made
No more a man, I seek to be immortal

Like lion and lamb, one beast must succumb to the other
I shall take for my own the spirit and dreams of all others
Selfish, filled with greed, this is the caste that shall mark me
Unto this end I shall lead all into my darkness

Eternity becomes my destiny
Eternity brings serenity

I believe the hand of fate is guiding me
Be not deceived, false gods and their treachery
