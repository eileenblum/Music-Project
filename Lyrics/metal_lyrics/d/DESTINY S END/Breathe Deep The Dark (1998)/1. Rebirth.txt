Waiting and watching the sands slip away from me
Looking into the eyes of eternity

I have feared the cold grip of death and the unforeseen
I have hoped the end of my life would begin all my dreams

Returning from an empty eden and shattering life's fantasies
To my rebirth, I owe my chance

Spiraling into the mouth of infinity
Fighting the haunting remains of my memory

I have felt the cold hand of death and the nothingness
I can hear the calling that brings me back from the abyss

Returning from an empty eden and shattering life's fantasies
To my rebirth, I owe this chance
To know the only hell is burning deep in the stars
From my rebirth, to Destiny's End

We were born unto the end
Our destiny's in our hands

[Trade Off Leads: Dan, Perry, Dan, Perry]

Emerging from the womb of the universe
Walking the path of my former existence

I can see a vision of life and it's beckoning
I can shed the thoughts of my past and live once again
I've seen the end

Returning from an empty eden and shattering life's fantasies
To my rebirth, I owe this chance
To know the only hell is burning deep in the stars
From my rebirth, to Destiny's End
