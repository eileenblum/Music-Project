Super god or so he claims
Making is living off of you
Addiction from the goods you receive
He knows what his poison can do
Lifestyle means nothing more
Distortion of values that were
Another fix only makes you smile
Vision now becomes a blur

Ruling this nation, on his command
Spreading corruption over this land

He hooks 'em first, his golden rule
Indulging his profits from our young
His empire, black market wealth
Richness while their necks are being hung

Beating the system, twisting minds
He rips your heart and leaves you blind
The law pretends that he's not there
Paying off bloody affairs
He runs your life, he's picked your crowd
You are his slaves, he's walking proud

He counts his victims, more each day
Your empty lives are cast away

[Lead: Dan]

Takes a life every now and then
Climbing his way straight to the top
The innocent only feel his pain
Will the killing ever stop?
The criminal who can't be stopped by any law of the kind
The overlord with the power of a sinister mind

Spreading corruption over this land

He hooks 'em first, his golden rule
Indulging his profits from our young
His empire, black market wealth
Richness while their necks are being hung
