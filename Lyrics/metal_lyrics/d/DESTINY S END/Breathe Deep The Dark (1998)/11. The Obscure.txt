[To the Memory of Frank Belknap Long (1901-1994)]
[Inspired by his tales "The Flame Of Life" and "Giants In The Sky"]

[Intro Acoustic Lead: Perry]

Out in the distance the voices are calling
High in the night, the sirens are blaring
Will we survive or just fade away...

Humankind bleeding with arrogance
To not realize they're so insignificant
Adapt to change and leave the Earth behind...
Behind... Behind!

Flame of life - reach the core of space
Suspend time - reach eternity

Won't you tell my future?
The unknown is waiting
Won't you tell my future?
Memory is fading
Won't you tell my future?
Words are forever
Won't you tell my future?
The unknown is waiting

When the final days are approaching
Watch the arrogant ones burn themselves out
Legacy of the obscure
The remaining force going beyond... beyond...

Flame of life the creative mind
Suspend time reach throughout the years
Flame of life reach the core of space
Suspend time reach eternity

Won't you tell my future?
The unknown is waiting
Won't you tell my future?
Memory is fading
Won't you tell my future?
Words are forever
Won't you tell my future?
The unknown is waiting

[Leads: Perry, Dan]

To die as a pauper, while memories remains
To live an outsider, outcast from this time
Masses fall into self destruction
Vanish from greed into oblivion

Won't you tell my future?
The unknown is waiting
Won't you tell my future?
Memory is fading
Won't you tell my future?
Words are forever
Won't you tell my future?
The unknown is waiting
