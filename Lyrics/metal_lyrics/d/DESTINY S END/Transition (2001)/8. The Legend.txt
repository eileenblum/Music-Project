The time has come to crack the sky
He wakes to rise once again
He closes his eyes and wonders why
His mission had come to end
Sent through time to give the world
Sounds of thunderous song
Fighting for victory that was his along

In his sleep the world did pass him by
Still he dreamed, his passion couldn't die

His powers taken from the gods, given to unworthy men
Creating naivete with no message to send
Feeding on the weakened minds, all who fell for the plan
Prepare for the end, his time is at hand

In his sleep the world did pass him by
Still he dreamed, his passion wouldn't die
With a vengeance in his torn heart
He has come to claim his glory
Believer of forgotten time
The legend carries on his story

A fire burns within him that burns forever more
The fight that he's been fighting, it's what he's living for
He's lives his darkest hours out on the street of dreams
A journey with no promise, but still he had to see

Through a broken sky he stands on top the world once again
The unworthy weakened minds, lives come to an end
The masses roar to hear, sounds of thunderous song
Praising his victory, that was his along

In his sleep the world did pass him by
Still he dreamed, his passion never died

With a vengeance in his torn heart
He has come to claim his glory
Believer of forgotten time
The legend carries on his story
The masses
All bow down to him
