I should have never been born
I'm all that festers in the human womb
My life's out of season
Out of space, out of time
Sires all deranged and unfit
Influences obscure reveal my path
Through landscapes bleak and chaotic
To planes of mythic dreams

Arrogant world of beings unlike me
In solitude forever
Against dreary nights and long days
Beneath these stars
Yet still I live
No one shed tears while I lived
In this world all alone
When time chases my black shadow away
I'll vanish from this place unto another

I'm more that what I seem
The gleam in your eyes
Not the same as my dream
My motives are forgotten
Another atom lost in dust
Overcome genetic code
Losing sense of innocence
My trail has vanished

[Lead: Perry]

[Chorus]

Sought after though all that's dark
Changed and shunned evermore
Benign intentions mistaken again.
Striking fear deep in a heart

[Chorus]
