[Lead: Dan]

A thought you always feared becomes reality
What can't be undone is driving you insane
Reaching for the past to turn back the hands of time
Retracing steps you've taken a wish that can't be made

All at once your world crumbles and shatters to the ground
The hand of fate now takes its place and comes without a sound
Knowing it was just a mater of time
How could not see the signs

You hear a symphony composed of misery
There's no one else to blame
Can't change what's taken place
Feeling the disgrace
Never seeing things the same

A polished tombstone, tears from livid eyes
A taunting crow overlooks this tomb
I'll rise to heights high above your dying dreams
Teaching the lessons, the ones you never learned

You had a choice of paths to walk, a choice of graves to dig
A burial before its time, this journey ends
Wasted potential and such bitter lies
I'm left behind asking "Why?"

[Chorus]

[Leads: Perry, Dan]
