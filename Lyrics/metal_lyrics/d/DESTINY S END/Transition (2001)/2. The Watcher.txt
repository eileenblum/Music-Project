Hopeless creator looks down on what was man
Digital lifeform overthrows his plans
His sculptured beings now fragments of steel
Countdown to chaos begins

Hear me calling, you are falling
From your world, your charade
Hear my warning, now I'm coming
To take the light from your eyes

Far beyond the black field of stars
Grieving the Watcher knows
Behind scopic skies in space
The Watcher sees he must let go

Angry creator looks down, he's had enough
Hatred is rising, survival's growing tough
Soulless inventions, machines run amok
Their programmed future is Destiny's End

What was meant for paradise
Has become computerized

[Leads: Dan, Perry]

Hear me calling, now you're falling
From your world, your charade
Hear my warning, now I'm coming
To take the light from your eyes

[Chorus]
