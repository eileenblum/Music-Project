[Theme Lead: Dan]

Days are passing and filled with sighs
Tears of blood cried
How you crucified
With every breath I feel the pain
Goin' insane from the games you play

Thought of your laughter keeps haunting me
The constant agony
Coldness has crushed me to the ground
Hearing the sound of your lies pouring down

I've become a prisoner
Storm Clouds appear
Always looming near
As my soul begins to die
Bleeding inside
Crying out, oh why?

Just couldn't read between the lines
I never saw the signs
Just couldn't see behind your eyes
The stormy devil in disguise

Hang your head to a lesson in life to be learned
Give your heart away at least once to be burned
Shivers in the night
Then place their prolonged stay
No one hears you cry
No one hears you pray

Storm Clouds keep on closing in
Bright days seem so far away from me

[Lead: Dan]

Just couldn't see behind your eyes
The devil in disguise
Insane from pain, you'll laugh, so cold
Hearing the sound of your lies pouring down

Storm Clouds keep on closing in
Bright days seem so far away
