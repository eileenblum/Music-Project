Burn for a thousand eons
Shot from exploding fire
Ride through a lifeless vacuum
Born at the dawn of time

Union with nature
Follow random paths
Rising from chaos
Becoming part of what we see

[Lead: Dan]

Struggle, focus, mutate and grow
Project, predict
Words connecting separate minds
Isolation lost
On the shoulders of the past
Concepts of today

From dust to life, unfolding mind
Consciousness, questioning why
A quantum world, outside the mind
Contemplate, our demise

Race through a thousand light years
Ripped from a white hot sun
Facing the countless enemies
Surviving endless storms
Rise from the yielding ice age
Chipping the stones away
Peer into every corner
Probing the world within

Mindless reflexes
Flooding the world
Compassion to survive
The effective response-emotion

[Lead: Dan]

Instincts, dying, a fragile form
Helpless, progress
Pressing on uninfluenced
Persistence is life
Unsubstantial differences
Unjust is pride

[Chorus]

[Leads: Dan, Perry, Dan, Perry]

Burn for a thousand eons
Shot from exploding fire
Ride through a lifeless vacuum
Born at the dawn of time

Ruthless intelligence
Standing alone
Universal truth
At the top how long?

[Chorus]
