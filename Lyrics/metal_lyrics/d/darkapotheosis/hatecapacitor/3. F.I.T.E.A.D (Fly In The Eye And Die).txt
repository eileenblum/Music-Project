All these people I hate, ugly mutant creatures
Just by looking at them, I get violent seizures
I am here to relax, but I can't when I see
Disgusting old human, naked on the beach

I start vomiting
Rage is gathering

All these parents I hate, with their slobbering kids
Overweight, fat bastards, eating their ice creams
Oh how I want to strangle, torture, rape and kill
Beautiful, pregnant women, that came here to swim

This is provoking
Soon I'll have to kill something

All these people I hate, ugly mutant creatures
All over the place, with fake tan features
I am here to relax, but I can't when I see
Disturbing adolescent parties at the beach

They're taking pictures with their phones
This makes me want to break their bones

All these insects I hate, on the ground or in the sky
They circle around my face, and try to crash in my eye
So I steal someone's bike, the last one I had I ate
Now I ride to the sunset, followed by pure hate

Suddenly I feel pain
It went through my eye in my brain

Suicide bombers, unstoppable force, living one day at most
Only one purpose: to kill and destroy human eye, fly

Fly in the eye and die
Fly in the eye and die
Fly in the eye and die
Fly in the eye and die

Proudly I stand up, I'm blind in both of my eyes
But I chose not to be the only one who dies
I grab a candy tightly in my right hand
Then I search for a girl, to fulfill my plan

This is sacrifice
Seven year olds demise

I find one in the sand, she's building a tower
I offer her a present, a lollipop and a flower
She starts to follow, I lure her far away
I strip her naked, my chainsaw leads the way

Insects now spawn
From her cadaver

Suicide bombers, unstoppable force, living one day at most
Only one purpose: to kill and destroy human eye, fly

Fly in the eye and die
Fly in the eye and die
Fly in the eye and die
Fly in the eye and die

Their dead corpse in your eyes they'll leave, your eye hole will bleed
Unbearable pain, you fall down, blinded you crawl on the ground

Fly in the eye and die
Fly in the eye and die
Fly in the eye and die
Fly in the eye and die

[Solo]

The whole beach is swarmed
And all will be destroyed
They kill a donut man
They destroy a pancake stand

All run in disarray
But they cannot escape
All die with violent cries
And drop their popcorn and fries

Insects around me fly
I stand on a hill
Of bodies of all who died
Capacitor will be filled

Capacitor will be filled
