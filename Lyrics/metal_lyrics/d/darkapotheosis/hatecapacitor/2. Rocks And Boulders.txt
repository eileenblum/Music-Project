Stones and rocks and boulders
Boulders and stones

Forced to live around all those who are happy
Kids that play outside are making me angry
A love couple satisfying their primal needs
The 'cause of their death will be my evil deeds

I cannot stand hearing the sound of this noise
Disgusted by felicity in their voice
New objective's set now I have to kill
Genocide at hand, tones of blood I'll spill

Soon I realize
I don't have a tool
To kill a man
Beside my hands

Then I look around
A weapon on the ground
A perfect tool
To slaughter this fool

I pick a rock
He will die in pain
In one blow
I open his head

The blood flows
Again I smash his face
He falls down
He lies dead

Stones and rocks and boulders
Boulders and stones

Panic strikes the girl, she then tries to flee
I follow up with haste, I hunt her viciously
A jump on her back makes her fall down
A stone in my hand buries her in ground

Her brains are now spilled but I still need more
A putrid satisfaction of my need for gore
Killer instincts kick in, I spot a new pray
Defenseless young boy just a glimpse away

He's playing with his friends, they are climbing a hill
A perfect place for me to enjoy my kill
Already on top I gaze at him with hate
My wicked smile serves me as a bait

I pick up a boulder that's big as his head
I start rushing down, velocity immense
I stretch out my hands, I'm ready to fire
I finally fulfill my murderous desire

The boulder flies
Time seems slow
Heart beat stops
Now wind blows

Feel as life
Is taken away
From a child
That has fallen pray

To me
But he won't die in vain
He is sacrificed
To test my device

The boulder hits
With a massive force
He hits the dirt
I piss on his corpse

[Solo]

Stones and rocks and boulders
Boulders and stones
