I'm on the bus
A crowded cage
I am enraged
No seat is free

A starving child
For money begs
He has no legs
It brings me glee

In corner reeks
A bum for weeks
Yellow fluid
From him leeks

Young-born yell
Death knell
With my own hands
I'll chop off their heads

My heart begins
Fiercely to beat
For in the front
I see a free seat

Wretched bastards
I push away
I kick a bum
I've cleared up my way

I use the kid
To clean my seat
From all the vomit
Covering it

I claim my throne
My possession
The final step
To my salvation

A shabby deformity
Enters the cavity
Old and brittle
Ready to drink blood

With bug-filled hair
She starts to stare
The search for a victim
Has already begun

She closes in on me
And that is when I see
What I've always feared
She wants to take my seat

The time is to fight
She will witness my might
I'll turn her into dust
And her face will be crushed

Fist in the face
Fist in the face
Fist in the face
Fist in the face

Skull breaks
Brains spill
Eyes explode
I feel the thrill

No old lady
No crippled man
No pregnant woman
Will make me stand

Two courageous man
They approach to help
But what they don't know
She's already dead

They take out their guns
I prepare my hands
I rip out their hearts
I eat them and I'm fed

Driver shits himself
Terrified he cries
Violently he pukes
He bleeds from he's eyes

I tear off his arms
I shove them in his ass
In the afterlife
He will find no rest

Fist in the face
Fist in the face
Fist in the face
Fist in the face

Skull breaks
Brains spill
Eyes explode
I feel the thrill

No old lady
No crippled man
No pregnant woman
Will make me stand

His head in the grip of my hands
His head disconnected around my arm bends
Bus full of casualties, like pigs they'll squeal
Destination chasm, I drop the wheel

[Solo]
