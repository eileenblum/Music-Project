A legend speaks of an ancient device that dwells inside every man
A device old as the time itself, it feeds on hatred of its host
And according to the prophecy the time will come
And one man, a very, very angry man
Will reach its full capacity
And awaken the
Being of pure
Hate

Hate, hate, hate, hate
Hate, hate, hate, hate
Hate, hate, hate, hate
Hate, hate, hate, hate
