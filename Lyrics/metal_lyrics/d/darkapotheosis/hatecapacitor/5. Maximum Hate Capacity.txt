First morning sun rays blast sharp through my eyes
I am awoken by hate
First breath I take is the breath of pure loathe
My mind in berserker's state
My eyeballs are blood red, my teeth swim in foam
I am empowered by rage
The exercise begins of my daily routine
I'm taking it to the next stage

The hunger is calling, I need to eat, I take a bowl
I fill it with anger, with resentment and abhor

Now I eat hatred
Now I eat scorn

My cats need to eat too, I open the fridge
There rests my neighbor's rotten cadaver I've ditched
I dig through his stomach, I chose his left kidney
I feed it to my pets, they die immediately

The fury in me bursts, I run to the streets
Suddenly I spot a bunch of emo kids
Desperate mutations, sick of their life
So I offer help: I kill them with my knife

One of them survives, hopelessly he crawls
With one skilled slice, his head in dirt falls
Joyfully I start to feast on his brain
In the next moment I'm hit by a train

I'm glued to the front, but I do not dread
I break through the windshield using my head
I attack the driver, his jaw I start to tear
He brakes, I fly out, I die in despair

From the rising of the first sun, to the fall of the last moon
I love the hate in my life, I dwell in my daily gloom
Colors of joy gather around me, when I slaughter my neighbor's baby
Rainbows, butterflies and hearts, spawn when I rip out its guts

Max, hate, max hate, max hate
Max, max hate capacity
Hate, max hate, max hate
Max, max hate capacity

Again I am awoken by suns annoying beam
Psychologist calls, I have to visit him
He tells me that I should try to stay calm
I dismember him when I burst like a bomb

With his lifeless body I mop the floor
My eye catches his kid crying behind the door
Traumatized and weak, devoid of all hope
He surrenders to me; I tie him with a rope

I chop his father's body into chewable size
I stuff him 'til he bursts; I laugh when he dies
Guts are everywhere, from ceiling hangs his spleen
I hear the front door open, his mom enters the scene

I throw her on the floor, without any remorse
Now I rape her on her child's dead corpse
Police surrounds the building, but I have a plan
I jump through the window and I die again

From the rising of the first sun, to the fall of the last moon
I love the hate in my life, I dwell in my daily gloom
Colors of joy gather around me, when I murder a man who gives me therapy
Rainbows, butterflies and hearts, spawn when I cum on his sons body parts

Max, hate, max hate, max hate
Max, max hate capacity
Hate, max hate, max hate
Max, max hate capacity

[Solo]

I love to piss on corpses; I love to rape in massive doses
I love to kill a kid that begs; I love to break driver's legs
I love to rage extremely wild; I love to mutilate a child
I love to induce insect slaughter; I love to sodomize my neighbor's daughter

I enter a fulfillment shock, when I kill a man with a rock
Ecstasy greater than masturbation, is young girl's desecration
Massive amounts of godlike grace, when I smash an old woman's face
Through my deeds the capacitor's filled, soon its purpose will be fulfilled

Tremendous murders cannot go unseen
I never ran from the face of crime scene
I did not care, I left too many clues
Now I am wanted, but I will not lose
Maximum hate capacity
Forced me to change my identity
I need a new life, new chapter in the book
Now I'm a cook

[Solo]
