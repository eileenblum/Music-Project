A devious drop
In a restless deep
Unsuspicious of the eve
Wake of carbon reaction

Pierce through the chasm
A mass that can't be explained
Can't avoid the attainable under none

Karma so inescapable
One into a colony
In metabolic steps
Gap the range
Beyond themselves reverberate

Out of nowhere resurrection
A drop of complexion
Thrives out of control
Complexity
No longer null

Unavoidable, attainableÂ 
Under none

Seed that'll ever be a seed
That'll ever outgrow
And will cover every shred of land
Feed that'll ever be the feed
That'll never halt or slow
And will cover everything that is

Just a step away from never sailing
Heritage grows close and we're receding
Just a step away from never sailing
Heritage grows close and we're receding
Just a step away from never sailing
Heritage grows close and we're receding
