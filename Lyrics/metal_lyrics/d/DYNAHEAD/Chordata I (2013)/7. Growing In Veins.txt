Expanding and overlapping
In complex pattern forms
Cutting sand like a rusted knife
Leaving scars in the soil
Contrast in the gray
Veins pulse through the clay

A thousand eyes overhead
Watch the bleeding
Fluids are coming alive
Wounds are healing

Out of the blue all is new
Flocks are breeding
Changing the face of a world
That's been waiting

Who've seen the miracle?
Now I can feel the Sun,Â 
I want to breathe in the Sun
Who's been alive?
I'm going to seize the day
I want to breathe in the day

Caressing with desire
The wind waves by
Reshaping the beasts, stones and seas
Burying the past times

Pushing through blue and red veinsÂ 
A hallowed leak of winey blood
Clotting and shattering, clustered coloniesÂ 

Forever bleed away, as now
I can feel strong, I can be more
Bleed, as the time to be aware is now
I can see the Sun, I can eat the Sun
