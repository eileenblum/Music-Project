No wildest shine on the briefest time
Would know what took it there to know
As the tide that we're in flows
No second will ever be the same again

Ingeminate the day in parallel reiteration
Happily doing more of the same
Lest this isn't all that remain as bright as the brightest day
Knowing all that's needed to know so far

Emergent new attributes on sand
Bred patterns, floating water remains
Stating itself forever in twisted chains
In constant revelation

Hear the nothing find its speak
Everlasting uncertainty
Generations led to breed
Fever permeate all that can breathe

Created on its own
Unleashed through the end
No loneliest cry from the youngest hatch
Will know what took for it to be here
And the melting rocks will grow
Like islands of mutual solitude

To do what's made to do
Fulfillment beyond karma
Inescapable malediction
Reiterating again, over again, over again, over again,

Ingeminate the day in parallel reiteration
Happily doing more of the same
Lest this isn't all that remain as bright as the brightest day
Knowing all that's needed know so far

Emergent new attributes on sand
Bred patterns floating remains
Stating itself forever in twisted chains
In constant revelation

Hear the nothing find its speak
Everlasting uncertainty
Generations led to breed
Fever permeate all that can breathe
