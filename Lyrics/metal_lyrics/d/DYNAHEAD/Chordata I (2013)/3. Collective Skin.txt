No more the same
Every shard met its own fate
Over a billion times
And is back
Cannot resist alone
No more
Resist to be devoured

Collective
Collective

An army like one transcending life bonded by sorrow

No longer alone as the world tries to swallow us
Together we will thrive

Utility was found in the same drawer as the word survival

To rearrange the order we're in
Transparently organize the nexus of the chain

I weld you, cling on you
We can't be told away
A link you can't escape
For I help you to see

Collective
Collective

An army like one transcending life in myriad forms bonded by sorrow

As the world tries to shatter us
And disintegrate into quantum
We're an army bonded by grief
With weaponry forged in blood

Spawning back from hell
