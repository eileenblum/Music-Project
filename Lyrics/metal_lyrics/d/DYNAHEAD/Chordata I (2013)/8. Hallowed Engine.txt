Oh
There's no place left in this globe
Where a flower is not in bloom
As the engine runs in full

Explosions keeping its march
A combustible thrust
Nucleotides yielding horsepower
The whole feedbacks its parts
An aftermath way beyond its current grasp

A single earthling is moreÂ 
Than Earth once was

Wipe out the hallowed land
Wipe out the immortal land

Add more power on each rotation
In guilds and tribes
In states and cries
This world pulses alive
The noise deafens the blind

Oh
There's no place left in this globe
Not stained by slaughtered blood
As the engine runs in full

Running, running...
