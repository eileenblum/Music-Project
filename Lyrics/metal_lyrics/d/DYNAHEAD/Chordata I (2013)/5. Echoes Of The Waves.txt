There's a mind
Looking back, longing
I can't see
What no eye ever will

As our moments pass
Bearing no actor or witness

I can't hear
Symphonies that won't come back
Undeservedly they play
For no audience

This is the serenade
Without a lover's ear to hear

We're lost in time
Trapped in here
I've lost my mind
Even my senses weren't here
We're lost in time
Wrecked in sea
I've lost my life
But can't escape theÂ 
Echoes of the waves
