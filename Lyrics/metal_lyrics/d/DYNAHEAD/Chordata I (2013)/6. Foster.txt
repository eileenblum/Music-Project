I need you to acquiesce to my pride
Forever bonded in mutual destiny

We're two proto legions summing our might
To foster and to protect now

I need you to breathe through my lungs

Would you help me growing
Through the time we're living at?
Would you help me blooming
Through the rocks that stifle us?
Would you help me crawling
Out of this god forsaken mire
Come with me and let us foster our child

Wandering, stepping the same
Keeping the pace that will take us away
Our essence living again
Outside ourselves but the same entity

Opposite complement, a knotÂ 

Both aiming at the same goal
Like arrow and bullseye we share a purpose
Our substance as a child remains
Outside ourselves but forever
