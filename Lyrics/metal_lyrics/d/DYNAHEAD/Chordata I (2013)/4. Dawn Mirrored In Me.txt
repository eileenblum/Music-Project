Right there, I can barely reach
Way above my further thoughts
Where dreams are little more than ghosts
The outer world pulsates
And dwarfs the one inside
But it's a mirror to me

Voar alÃ©m, rasgar a pelÃ­culaÂ 
Que separa o desafio da conquista
Quebrar o espelho e sangrar minhas mÃ£os
Rubi escuro, cristalino e inspirador

A claridade que ofusca e isola
Penetra a casca e redefine a dor
AtÃ© o limite, a vida por um fio
O pioneiro cruza o inferno resistindo fogo e frio

Invisible to us
Numerous stars glow faint
A million of dawns
A speck away

Can you see the light?
Oscillating through
The looking glass it's allÂ 
I want to see

Right there, I can barely reach
Way above my further thoughts
Where dreams are little more than ghosts
The outer world pulsates
And dwarfs the one inside

My skin shines like dawn

Right there, I can barely see
Way beyond my deepest fears
Where truth scares me more than ghosts
The inner world pulsates
And grows back outside
But it's all a mirror to me

I want to see the light of day
