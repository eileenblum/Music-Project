Ah, where are they?
Uninvited or absentee
Are we the only ones in this supper?
I gaze at my reflexive plate
No shadows dancing under the gate
This is such a lonely place

Behold the colorful meal
But Iâll starve as no hunger to feed
Can relieve the uniquely ill

Foolish thought, that itâs been one day
The roots coil around my shin
Weâre trapped

The wind whistle a cure
Like a maiden lure
A ghost beside me
Of my own design

I hear so many say
The game I have to play
But I'm not the center anymore
Look the other way
Throw yourself away
And let the sea take you from the shore

Thick walls are too damp
Hearken only my heartbeat
Plenty of room shouldnât bear only one seat

Nosce te ipsum (know thyself)
Fallaces sunt rerum species (the look of things are deceptive)

Iâve learned from the outset
That we are the ones
But why donât I feel accordingly
For the first time?
To be wrong is a matter of time
To be alone is to be alive

Egocentric foundation
Anthropocentric probation
Heliocentric creation
