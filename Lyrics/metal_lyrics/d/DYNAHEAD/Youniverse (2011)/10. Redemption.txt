I heard your complaint
No one wouldnât hear
You made it clear

I remember very well
Every second of every minute
Iâm already an eroded rock

We are in recess
But for me itâs labor day
Notes around me
Bring back every song weâve played

Please do not ignore me
Itâs not time to disregard the facts

You live in me
Iâm you
Hold back
You know itâs true

Weâre in the last day
And there is no afterlife
Thereâs no use to pray
And no need for goodbye

Spare me from your metaphysical bullshit
Thereâs no eternity or no reason to be
This is all, we are all, and thatâs enough for me
