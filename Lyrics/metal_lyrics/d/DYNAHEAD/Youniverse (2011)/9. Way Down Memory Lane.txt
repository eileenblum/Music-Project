I will take you back
To places you wish youâve never been
Rooms that were built
From tons of incoherent masonry

A life form in denial
Breeding in an unending orgy
A fatal error in any file
The bug corrupts every piece of me

A long time the past became
Cemented in walls of shame
But let us go
Way down memory lane

You are the whole
The sole commander of a world
That only remain
Existing in your brain

An irritant insect
Annoying the upper ones
Smashing lesser clones
In pyramidal penitence

A viewpoint in a billion
A lifetime of isolation
In a pool of information
The minority eyes can't see no way
