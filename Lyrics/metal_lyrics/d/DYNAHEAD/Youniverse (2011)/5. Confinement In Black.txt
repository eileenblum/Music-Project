Negligibly waiting
A clock stopped in now
Perspective collapse
Confinement in black

As specks we live
In less than a
Second to nothing
A minute too late

The place is nowhere
The time is never
The name is no one
All hope is long gone

Frustrated we see
Where else we could be
But this is our prison
Forever weâll live in this place

A countdown
And nothing else
Have mercy on us
The time will never heal
Have mercy on us
The time will never hear

Creation. Selection. Confinement. Extinction.

Our inquiries are
Graffiti in a cell wall
Distracting insanity
Diversion from reality
