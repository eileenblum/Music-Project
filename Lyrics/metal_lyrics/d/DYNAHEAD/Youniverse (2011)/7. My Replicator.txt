Endless levels within
Infinitesimal ruling
An eukaryote machine
Devolved to reproduce

Free will delusion, personality fallacy
Inescapable fate of automatic irony

Survival machine
Proudly chosen by fate
More than it fancies me
But I donât determine what will be

Screw the concept, civilization is inept
Give me blood and Iâll replicate
The behavior of the living

Doubling the copy
Imitating transcript
Meet my replicator!
Be my clone

We wish it was a lie
To know is our accolade
