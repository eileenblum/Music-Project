Have you wondered how itâd be?
When there are no more after-days
Consecutive rituals of daylight

Have you wondered how to feel?
When all your guarantees are expired
And your past beliefs have no meaning

Let the onset come to terms
With the disregard we gave her

No eyes sees no fear
Dreams and wake are nothing but impressions
Our future is out there
With its illimitable precessions

Have you wondered what would care?
When tenets melt and the shore is anew

Let the onset come to terms
And like our mother lead our way
Let the ending have its place
The forever begins today
