May we boil away
Elderly find a way
Precipitate from the clouds
Land on newer grounds
In matching drops of fate

Nothing is the same anymore
I wish it was like before
But no will or fantasy
Will change our way to be

May we be one again
Detach from the stain
The bleak of the autumn is near
Leave it all behind
Weâll be back another day

In circles we play
In trust weâll keep
In hope we disappear
Confound all our days

But I will never let you down
We remain the same
