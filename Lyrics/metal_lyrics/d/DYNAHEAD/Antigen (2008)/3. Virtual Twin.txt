[Music: Schmidlin, Duarte / Lyrics: Schmidlin]

Behind the mask of vanity
Lies the master of insanity
Encrypted look of who should be known
Old friends donât recognize
Their faces anymore

Behind the reflex of an heretic
Hides the devil of hypocrisy
Unspeakable words corrode his mouth
Faded embryo that should be dead

From the mirror comes the virtual twin
He hides my mysteries but reveal my sins
He, me, us in a splintered glass
Chromosomes of mutant me,
But not me

He moves like shadows envying me
And guess my attitudes before I begin
Rising enemy in a stolen corpse
The cocoon of a battle lost

From the mirror comes the virtual twin
He hides my mysteries but reveal my sins
He, me, in a splintered glass
Chromosomes of mutant me,
But not me

[Lead: Vilela]

From the mirror comes the virtual twin
He hides my mysteries but reveal my sins
He, me, us in a splintered glass
Chromosomes of mutant me,
But not me

[Lead: Mafra]
