[Music: Duarte, Teixeira  / Lyrics: Duarte]

Call my name
I wonât hear
Try to grab me back
From destitution
No, you donât
Donât have the strength
Just leave me, abhor me
Depart now

Out of my way
This is not a fancy play
God damn your aesthetic, needless ply
Ancestors never cared for this shit,
Why would I?

Pull my hair
It wonât distract me
From the line
Throw debris in front of me
Impose your useless mass
Thereâs more to care now

Out of my way
This is not a game you play
Fuck your aesthetic, needless cry
Ancestors never cared for this,
Why would I?

Donât you see
Thatâs why I dismissed you
Run
I donât want to believe
That in this dystopic, twisted world
I really need you
No

Perhaps we shall meet again
In an inspiring place of joy
Let go is not a choice
Remember it was a tampered lot
We will stay somewhere
In the end of time under cerulean blue
