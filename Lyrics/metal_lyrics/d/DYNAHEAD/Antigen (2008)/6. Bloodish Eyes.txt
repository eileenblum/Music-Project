[Music: Schmidlin, Negrello, Baggio, Duarte  / Lyrics: Negrello, Schmidlin]

Oh, youâre drowning
Drowning in your filthy times
Youâre expecting answers
That youâll never find

Run, run and hide
Cover yourself with lies
Run and die
Stare at my red bloodish eyes
Bloodish eyes

Now youâre crawling
Crying for you empty lives
I am the fallen angel
Your blackened foe now rises

Run, run and hide
Cover yourself with lies
Run and die
Stare at my red bloodish eyes
Bloodish eyes

[Lead: Vilela]

Iâll save you from oblivion
Come closer and taste my vision
You can be dead or be mine
To find you is just a matter of time

Run, run and hide
Cover yourselves with lies
Run and die
Stare at my red bloodish eyes
Bloodish eyes
