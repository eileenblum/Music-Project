[Music: Vilela  / Lyrics: Duarte]

Tell you stories to put you to bed
Knife at hand, the deal is to tame
Right through your medulla it cuts down your stem
There are no heroes, no stories

Ruling the ministry, decreeing your acts
Donât believe youâre more than a pitiful rat
Since the day that the first one came to Earth
This route places the frail

But donât worry
Your compliance will fail
Converted and proud
Listen the engross of the loud
Loud crowd

I see
They really need me to put it on the ground
Sorry if it took so long
I swear I wonât do it again
Surrender, remember
There will always be an eye on you

We count on you to be more of the same
Struggle if you want but itâs no avail
Yes, youâll think you are âoh so specialâ
Itâs as normal as it can be

But donât worry
Your life will be long
Not that we care if youâre abundant
My voice donât exist
And my mind is dispersed

I see
They really need me to put it on the ground
Sorry if it took so long
I swear I wonât do it again
Surrender, remember
There will always be an eye on you

Yes! Iâm so perfect
Healthy, conscious and in harmony
Yes! I have dreams
My moral is untouched and beyond belief
Iâm my savior and my best friend

I can be more and more
Love and wealth is my pursuit, my friend

Tell you stories to put you to bed
Knife at hand the deal is to tame
Right through your medulla it cuts down your stem
There are no heroes, no stories

But donât worry
They arenât coming back for you.
Dead they will remain
To anew the status
Untwist into plane.

I see
They really need me to put it on the ground
Sorry if it took so long
I swear I wonât do it again
