[Music: Duarte, Mafra / Lyrics: Duarte]

Go
Donât give up light
Just one second and it will not be here
Donât give up light
Donât leave it alone
For your duties can wait
And the time is at run

Close your eyes, them all at once
The useless in you wonât be, no more
Whisper to yourself with all of your throats
Caress gently the fleeing air full of lies

You burn today in a helium haven
Inexistent, without mass, just a solid field

Drink the wine that disappears
Like a fish into the core of you, soulless spirit
Look the streets, they donât exist
The working mobs are nothing but wish - feel

Made of timeless work of art
Your body lives more than time itself
Hopelessly infinite

So let yourself go
Donât give up light
Just one second and it will not be here
Donât give up light
Donât leave it alone
For your duties can wait
And the time is at run

I think I canât believe
The minor part of me is my actual be
Hide from your soul
Itâll find you as it exist as much as you

[Lead: Vilela]

Open your mind, a bit at a time
Broad your thoughts and spread it out like dye

Even so youâll die
Just one second and will not be here
Reach as high as your arms can go
Even if youâll just scratch your grave
