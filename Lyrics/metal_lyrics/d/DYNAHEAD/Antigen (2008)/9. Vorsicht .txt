[Music: Schmidlin, Negrello, Baggio / Lyrics: Negrello, Schmidlin]

Dark is the sky inside your mind
You canât meet him, you wanna hide
Perhaps one more try
Are you brave enough to fight?

Vorsicht!
When you face your sinister fiend
Vorsicht!
When you blame your demon within

Loneliness makes you need a friend
Then you remember heâs always there
Gas for your lethal pire
Lock your closet and make yourself alive

Vorsicht!
When you blame your sinister fiend
Vorsicht!
When you're face to face with him

Oh, you got it all so wrong
Like children crying when they are alone
You kept your fears and you lost the game
He gets your soul either way

[Lead: Mafra]
