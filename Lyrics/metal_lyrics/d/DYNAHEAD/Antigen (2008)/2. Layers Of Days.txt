[Music: Vilela / Lyrics: Duarte]

I could be the same forevermore
Disputed surrounds of my free will are gone

Holding in, dreaded
Wasnât my wish nor my sin
Just a past imposed
Echoing, deafening what was left of me

Youâre so uncanny
A leper dysfunction in our dream
Grip tight on the blood
Or itâll be on lungs of deceased

Kill it on
Kill it on, almighty
Kill it on
Kill it on, oh fiercely

None of that stands for what I am
Numb, bargaining parts of the old, old road

Not my business
Incognito, the stars wonât bother
Cloaked I strive without dignity
I see no oneâs land across the river

[Lead: Vilela]

Crawling, we live in the edge of mind
Spirited by all but the reason, we try
Hard bread on hard bread I kill back to live
Kicking the womb as the drill comes in

[Lead: Vilela]

Youâre so uncanny
A leper dysfunction in our dream
Grip tight on the blood
Or itâll be on lungs of deceased

Kill it on
Kill it on, almighty
Kill it on
Kill it on, oh fiercely
