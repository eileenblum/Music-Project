[Music: Duarte, Mafra / Lyrics: Duarte]

Clear as day
Is the scope of the blind memories
Shapes a world never seen

In synaptic past
All the faces will wane
Thoughts will drown slowly
In the instinct, instinctive sinkhole
Â 
No more condolence
Apologies donât work when
Misfortune canât be sighted
Â 
Now I recall
How easy was to grasp a pulse
Or to reveal whatâs lost in front of me
Necessities, mechanic
No sight can heal
A fact I canât see when I see

Clockwork
Â 
Like a cogwheel, like clockwork
Parting ways with my mind is vain
It was left behind long before
Â 
So shut them
The echoes in my soul
Leave no room for my very own mind

In synaptic past
Those faces will wane
Thoughts will drown
In the instinct, instinctive sinkhole

The scent of change
I feel rags rotting off my shoulders
Voices becoming louder
As in haste I go to shut them
Â 
Now I recall
How easy was to grasp a pulse
Or to reveal whatâs lost in front of me
Necessities, mechanic
No sight can heal
A fact I canât see when I see
Â 
When I see
The scent of change
The wind, the scent of change
Hunt them, shut them
Hunt them, silently shut them
Particles of dismay
