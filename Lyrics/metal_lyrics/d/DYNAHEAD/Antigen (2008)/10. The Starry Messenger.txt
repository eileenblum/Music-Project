[Music / Lyrics: Duarte]

You see the enforcements in the far
Feels like thereâs nothing to hold on, that this struggle is not yours
And itâs lost since long before

The path once clear now remains in fog
Idolatry flanks once flowery paths

Automatically inherited from dark, sterile times
Thereâs sand on poets eyes and mud covers graves
Of who defied sense and perception
In spinning revolutions

Clear your sight as what you know
Doesnât match the tales youâre told
The temptation of the souls
Is meaningless to the starry messages

Give a sound to your hidden scream
And a shape to what you canât think

[2nd Lead: Vilela]
[Trade-off Lead: Vilela + Mafra]

âTill the last moment
Your endeavor moves on
You will be free

A harmony of the worlds is palpable in your eyes
Like a masterpiece of light
Outshines the darkest shadows
The fog just makes a candle in the dark brighter

Clear your sight as what you know
Doesnât match the tales weâre told
The temptation of the souls
Is meaningless to the starry messenger

Till the last moment of breath
Your endeavor move towards death
Tiny piece of stardust
You will remain free
