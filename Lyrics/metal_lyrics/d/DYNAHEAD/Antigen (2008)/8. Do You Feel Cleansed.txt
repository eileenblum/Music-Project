[Music: Duarte, Mafra  / Lyrics: Duarte]

Do you feel cleansed?
When you see wrong done
But itâs not with you?
So relieved, orgasmic ego

Psychopathic vicarious
Blindfolded with wide open eyes
Look at me youâll see
An opportunity pawn denied

Think you can fool everyone
You probably do
Thatâs the play weâll act for life
And I just wonât do my share

Fear of death
Antibiotics despair
The demise can wait
And will wait

Since you have all

To dust weâll disappear
Since power canât buy the time flow
No matter how deep the trenches are
Poor menâs nails are bound to climb and peel

If you had nothing
Itâs pleasure enough to steal
And buy their children for veal

[Lead: Vilela]
[Lead: Mafra]

Youâll have the votes
Canonized at the end
In a high altar lie
Climb the truth that you bent

But every little crap
Thatâs left behind
Gets disgusting and choking
And will reach you sometime

The truth doesnât cease to exist
Itâs just waiting to arise
The truth doesnât give up
Just waits for the fire

Do you feel cleansed?
