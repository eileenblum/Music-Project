The blood red moon drips down to earth
While entering the void
Echoes and shadows in a world of illusion
The gift of life became a curse
Darkness inflames the spiral path
Deep inside our rotten souls
Daylight slowly fades to black
Bury my existence in despair
I watched the serpent's eyes
But got poisoned by words
I'm drowning in lies
In a burning world
Planting seeds of obscurity
In stillness and solitude we will remain
