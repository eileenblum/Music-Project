Born in dead embers and covered with loss
A wanderer on its path
The imaginary as a prophet
As a guiding light in the dark
Chasing time while seeking for knowledge
An insidious silhouette - born to fade away
Still building our temples to see them collapse
Through the gloom of the night
Whispered words of wisdom
