I lay down under the frozen sun
Next to the ones I knew
Glorious Gaia - please let me leave
A tale at its end
A story done and told
Cold air shrouded in darkness
Silent and beautiful
I walked for miles
I lost it all
It's a story done and told
Let me go, let me leave
A wanderer at the end of his path
