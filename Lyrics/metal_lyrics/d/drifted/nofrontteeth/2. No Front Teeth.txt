You built me up to bring me down again, your steps stay like prints in the sand, you built me up to bring me down again, my roots are stuck in this forgotten land.
I watched your burn your life to the ground, now the ashes are scattered around the remnants of our broken past, coward!
I lay here awake trying to remember the days when everything was simple, we were unbreakable, I didn't fall with a smile on my face and a swore that I would never leave, there's a light at the end, life goes on
You built me up to bring me down again, your steps stay like prints in the sand, you built me up to break me down again
My steps are stuck in this forgotten land
There's only misery
