You will not recover from this, this scarification, you live and breathe with no promise of realisation. Realisation is too much witness! Too much to witness!
Grasp at air, likes there's something there, grasp at air because it's all that's left.
Never did I stop reaching out
Never did I stop breathing
I thought you would never come back, this is the break in your bone, this is the wound is which we salt to put your life on the throne
Never did I think you would be getting out alive, through a force of you're own you have struggled through this strife. This is all a lie, you're born into this life, light is what you seek and black is all you find
Never have I witnessed such hardship among us, working your fingers to the bone just to suffer in your fucking home
Born into servitude, to live by their orders, born into servitude, you can't erase these memories
I will not come to live by their orders
I will not come live their dream
I need a reason to stay alive,
An excuse to stop you from breathing
