Unleash yourself
Untie your restraints, this is another lease of life.
You never knew what's stopping you, this is the final round
So pick yourself up off the ground and we'll burn it down
A new beginning awaits for you
A new beginning awaits for you
We never know where this road will take us
We never know where this road will take us
We never know where this road will take us, my eyes are blurring, can't you see the tears running down my face?
You said you'd never run away
