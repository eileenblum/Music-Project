We look around while this world lays to waste, we look around at this ugly place, what have we done
Failing to keep our paradise clear
Of plagues that sicken the youth while it brings down the old, who will be left to keep the story alive
Or what's left to be told
I feel the smoke inside me
I feel it tearing me apart
Your eyes stare into mine, like I'm the last thing you'll see. The colour is all you remember, it's ruining me
It's getting harder for me to see what's right in front of me
Your presence just sickens me. It's as if I can barely breath
Not just to one but I shout to all who fucked up the world or can you not recall,
Your eyes stare into mine, like I'm the last thing you'll see. The colour is all you remember, it's ruining me
Your presence just sickens me. It's as if I can barely breath
