You act like you're not the one to blame but deep down I know you feel exactly the same, your guilty conscience always keeps you awake until the sun come up in this city of hate.
Eurgh
There's something going wrong, and it's only getting worse!
Let the oceans rise and the skies get dark as your wildest dreams turn into nightmares, let the oceans rise and the skies get dark as your wildest dreams turn into your darkest night mares
I didn't know the complexity of this place I stand
Let the oceans rise and the skies get dark
We're all gonna suffer, we're all gonna die in pain, if we keep destroying our world again and again! [4x]
