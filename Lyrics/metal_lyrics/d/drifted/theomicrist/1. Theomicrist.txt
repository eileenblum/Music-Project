We don't deserve to be here, less worthy than the ground beneath me
If I ever get the pleasure (pleasure)
I'm taking you all down with me

The crows call my name, as your church is engulfed in flames,
You spend your time praying to a worthless God
Blood spills on the altar as I offer your heart.
You will witness the birth of the overlord

Designed to die with every breath you take
I watch you slip away
You slip away
Just leave me to rot
You, you will all watch me
Burn before you

Suffering comes naturally
There is no positive outcome
We are all design to die
I wanna feel everything
Pull me down
There is no positive outcome
Pull me down

Bring the end
Stop my breathing, at one with the dead
Never underestimate the power of the mind, a blackened sun is all you will find
There is no light around here
Just a black hole for me to disappear
Disappear
No smiles
No names
