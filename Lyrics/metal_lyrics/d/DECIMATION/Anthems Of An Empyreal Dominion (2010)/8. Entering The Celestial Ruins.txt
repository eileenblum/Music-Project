Obscure realm,
Their covenant,
Scripture,
Servant souls that saviors couldn't save
Are ready to divine banishment
At place that blasphemy consents skill
Invocations for anguish
For purify themselves with fire
Cause of one unforgiven sin
For eternal suffering
God's realm that circulated into darkness
They will never find the way
They will never see what can be seen
At time that ominous orb announce the dark apocalypse
Eternal heretics summon thee
Awakening has began with the breath of chaos
Angels' screams are too high to hear
At celestial ruins that massacre is desired
Emptiness that falling upon us
Nothingness grows, grows and grows
Divinity that angels fear of
And they stimulated with the holy
