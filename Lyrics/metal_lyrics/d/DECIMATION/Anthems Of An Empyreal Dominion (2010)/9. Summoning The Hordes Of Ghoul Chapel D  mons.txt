I have seen the Unknown Lands,
That no map has charted.
I have lived in the deserts,
the wastelands, spoken with demons.
Souls of slaughtered men,
Victims of the she-fiend
LAMMASHTA.
I have traveled beneath the Seas,
In search of Palace of Master
In search of Palace of Master
and I found stone of monuments
Of vanquished civilizations,
And deciphered the writings.
Civilizations were destroyed.
I have traveled among the stars,
and trembled before the Gods.
I have, at last found the formulae
By which I passed the Gate ARZIR,
And passed into the forbidden realms of the foul IGIGI.
I have raised demons and the dead.
I have summoned the ghosts of my ancestors to real
I have raised demons and the dead.
I have summoned the ghosts of my ancestors to real
And visible appearance on
The tops of temples built to reach
The stars, and built to touch
The nethermost cavities of HADES.
I have wrestled with the Dark Wizard, AZAG-THOTH,
In vain, and fled to the Earth
By calling upon INANNA
And her brother MARDUK
Lord of the double-headed AXE
I have raised armies against the Lands
Of the East, by summoning the hordes of fiends
I have made subject unto me, found NGAA, the God of the heathens
Who breathes flame and roars like a thousand thunders
I have found fear
