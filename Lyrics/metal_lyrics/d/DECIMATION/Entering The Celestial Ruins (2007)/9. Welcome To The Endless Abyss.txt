time shall come that shall unleash the great abyss
for the ones who shall beg for their pitiful lives
the great abyss, the finality of extermination

the great spirit shall reveal it with one breath
and they shall be greeted
welcome to the endless abyss

absolute distress in each level
they shall fall too slow to run
too fast to realize
they shall desire to be torn apart
in their ever-failing consciousness
they shall not pray for the life, but death
when their wound bleed internally
they shall accept their fate
and witness without deliberation
