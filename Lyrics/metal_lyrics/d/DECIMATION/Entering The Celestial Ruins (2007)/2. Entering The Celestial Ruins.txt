obscure realm
their covenant
scripture
servant souls that saviors couldn't save
are ready to divine banish
at place that blasphemy consents skill
invocations for anguish
for purify themselves with fire

cause of one unforgiven sin
for eternal suffering
god's realm that epoched to darkness
they will never see what can seen

at time the ominious orb announse the dark apocalypse
eternal heretics summon thee
awakening has begun with breath of chaos
angels screams are too high to hear
at celestial ruins that perish is desired

emptiness that falling down upper us
nothingness that growing and growing
holyness that angels fear from
and they stimulated with holyness
obcurity is the ritual
in this ungodly ruin...
