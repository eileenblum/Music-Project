dormant gods are waiting for the throne
this is the era of perish
time is flowing back
the earth is turning back to its origin
rising of Nippur

nothing is like the future
insurgency of past has begun
this is nocturnal terror
god's minions are loading the shelter
but he chose the reclusion
rising of Uruk

Nibiru is approaching era is changing
war god we reclaim thee
bury the false prophets into sands
vomit your loathing to them
who leave you into relics
show your ominious mystery
rising of Lagas

now the earth is two pieces
fifth era is the darkest one 
conquerers are the ancient ones
now Annunaki walks the earth
rules the world again
this is rising of Ur
