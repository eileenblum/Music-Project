obscure mithos - begins with death
demonic horde - orbiting the earth
they beckon Ki-Gal (path of dead)
molesting the holy spirit
return of prophecies beginning of conquest
dwellers of ancient times
they are catalysts who despise the god
in their hands scroll of martyrs
they summon perished
decree for curse the god
decree for inherit
eternal decimation has begun
we denied religion
we saw god when failing to obscurity
we saw darkness in depths of heaven
and saw god's paradox
vomit your divinity and your possession
creator of all
end of human being
beginning of everlasting anguish
tell us the meaning of our lives
why did you torture my soul

hate - rising from the ancient catacombs
will conquer your eternity
