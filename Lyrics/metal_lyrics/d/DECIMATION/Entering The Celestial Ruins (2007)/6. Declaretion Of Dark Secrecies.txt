retaliation has been declared
apocalypse has been unleashed
sworn for dark divinity my brother
reclaim the prophet
after flames it will
embrace the wicked
when entering the dark shrines
swarm for dominion
lust will make you stronger
on this way my brother
we are poison-who reborn from ashes
we are betrayers-with suffering
we are serpents-who chant for insurgency
who arise in dark
perish at light
dwellers at nothingness
I invoke thee
diminish your conscience
will you mourn for me
I summon thee
Devour your dogma your believes
will you consede your secrecies
when you condemn in darkness
will you offer your loathing
formulas for dominion, vital oath
