Dark is the sky, misty is the air
Recondite figures are whispering
Uninvited observers hiding in the haze
Sinister moans feeding the twisted sense of insanity
Last call for the end of the world, sacrilege to the gods governing it all
Beam of dark light is on the abandoned ziggurat
Growing hatred among the ruins
Unique escape is madness so delusion awakes
Revenge of distorted reality and ungodly agitation
Taking place mercilessly
Hordes of the servants of darkness are gathering
A gathering of dethronement and humiliation
Perishing of deep virtues of mythical fiction of creation
Weakening of melammus and dispersion of heroic valors
Let the mass eradication and infinite decimation of Gods' level begin
Priests are weeping in the slime
Who has already tasted inevitable brutality of continuous atrocities
Ever flowing river of gore and noble blood
Abdication of the pantheon in this inert grimness
Non-physical cocoons were matured
Timeless travellers of the dark side, all are coming for slaughter
Aberrant ablution of demoness Lamashtu done by black crassamentum
Infidel disease is spreading now
Malignant evolution sowing the seeds of wrath
Masters of darkness smite the ominous wisdoms
Collapse of the ancient order and repentance of impotent lieges
Cold death of the divine hierarchy in testimony of imps and djinns
New dynasty ascending the throne
An and Ki, the stars and the cosmos
Re-arrangement of the universe for a new order
Inauspicious army is ready to torture the humans
No salvation, no expectation, only death and devastation
Helpless cries of the mourning souls in fear, pain, grief and suffering
