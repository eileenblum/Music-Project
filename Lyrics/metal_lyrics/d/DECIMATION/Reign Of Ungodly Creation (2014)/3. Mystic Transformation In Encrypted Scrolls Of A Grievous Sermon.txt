God get old, growling in his last ages
Parallel paradox in time, prophecy tells, well in advance
In the time of creation and cataclysm, in the ruins of Nippur
In the tales of the ancients whispered to me, from different dimensions
Out of the concept of time is where it is flowing backwards
Energy flowing from earth towards to Nibiru opens the gate of portal
Ancients are coming back as in Enki's book, spiritual
Planets are adjusted, in the same way in parallel dimension
The world is divided into atoms, new age, prophets are helpless
Principles of human flesh in eternal torment, putridity, hypocrisy
Now it's over, the conflict of the god, the sun fades
Eternal boredom and loneliness, endless agony
All pulled towards to the black hole of Gayya
Time stops, the physical metamorphosis starts, theories decays
Unknown answers in the boundaries of the eternity
Nothingness twirls the universe, it is shrinking and drawn into
It is growing in parallel dimensions, new world emerges, new testament arises
Time begins again, gods reborn to decimate
Vicious cycle of endless, affliction begins again
Malignant sermons, hypocrite prophets of lie
Anunnaki watches, gods in Nibiru
In deep discomfort, screams from afar
Calls for a mysterious transformation
