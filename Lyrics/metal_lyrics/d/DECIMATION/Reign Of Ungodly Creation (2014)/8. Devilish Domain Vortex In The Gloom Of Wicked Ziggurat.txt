His curse, in these malicious lands
His anger at the level of this eternal paradox
Agony of the pitch darkness where souls are desperate
Demons performs the genocide in this evolutionary perfection
Altered mass of filthy mob, evil and ungodly
Millions of tormented souls
Their bodies are not in physical forms
Moribund souls, agonizing beyond limits of pain
Bondage of gloomy creatures trapped eternally
Falling into the cavity continuously
In the dominion of sacrilege and sin
Realms where earth and sky do not exist
A race which is called continuously from the vacancy
Whose origin cannot be understood for pure torture and agony
A race which has already decayed and deformed
Rising from the void, a demon tribe, they are emerging from the shadow of the ziggurat
Trying to be undermined by prayer, all are in desperation
Maledicted mass in this vacancy vortex
A vicious circle sinister and gloomy
A creation originating from the hunger for a human soul
Evangelized to 7 different directions, blackened in the void
Constantly shifting corridors of corruption
A deep abyss beyond the concept of time
Physical and spiritual, the cradle of meaninglessness
Those pervert races fed by profanity and sin
Ungodly circumambulating to crush the human spirits
God cannot save them
In these lands where soil is fed with sinful blood, wicked souls
Like the ancient ones, they chose the path of incineration, to be the master not the servant
But the masters have punished in the hour of penance
