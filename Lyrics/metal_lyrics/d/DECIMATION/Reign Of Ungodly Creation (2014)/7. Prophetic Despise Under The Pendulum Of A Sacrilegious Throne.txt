In parallel dimension, there exist time reflections, the ancient ones, I see them
Dark vision is for them, those who are from beyond, no concept of time
Portal of despair seems to be the salvation subconsciously
Not only darkness; chaos and rottenness
Obtrusive decisions and phantasies deploying the obnoxious malignancy, ungodly
Sinful souls embedded in void, incorrigibly
Consciousness reaches a physical form, the energy behind the gate of portals
Metamorphosis, modifications in a different dimension
Inaccessible, unfathomable, power can be felt inside
Appearing of the dark explorers from the other side, cardinals of delictum
Dormant for centuries, serving nothingness
Obsolete formations, putrefaction they created
Mercilessly, rise from the ashes from the ruins of Ur to the physical earth
Consecration commences by their eternal exile
Punishment in the shades of agony, peak of nothingness
As ever holy, the seed of god Anu
Weakened and diminished by prayers
Idolized by his holy desires
Ancient rituals rise from this ungodly ruins
Unholy, ancient and wise
d___ed ones in the swirl of eternity
Prostrating to emptiness, putrid and vulgar
Pure torture and eternal deep bondage are for them
Divine genocide...
