Beyond the obscurity, where nothingness flows backwards
Reign, governing the sphere of creation
Pathfinders of vacancy are a__igned for drowning in the darkness
They slept through the ages, now violent era of gloom and anguish has come
A race fed with rotten flesh of angels
A reign authorized to open the gate of nothingness, for the ungodly creation
Tribe of demons migrating for agony, unholy mass of wicked ones
Devastation and destruction on behalf of the eternal salvation from the eternal crypts
Agonizing sentiment is rising from the shadows, violently and cruelly
Avid pathetic words of pseudo faith, gathers and rises hate
A hunger for godlessness, to open the chaotic gates of dismembered fates
Reign of malfeasance inspires by the agonizing screams of human souls,
In the ancient sphere of Anu, human plague in the form of energy, in endless pain
Unidentified effect of nothingness, chaos, corrupted divinity
Inter dimensional kingdom in which ancient rituals are admitted
Obsolescence, continually resurrection, a vicious circle of darkness
Contaminated with the constant betrayal of faith, those who are punished in vacancy
God is falling apart, along with his angels and the prophets are being exterminated
In these ruins where dark theories are dominating and existence results in subversion
Lost and ominous creatures shape in physical forms
Bizarre serpent like conglomeration, fueled by godlessness
Where torture and madness are divine and the center of chaos
Desperate cries of angels are not heard in this ominous evolution
In this ungodly reign of creation
Cursed reign eternally, through the depths of veracity, apart from the reality
Condemned into circle of unholiness where invocations are replied with desperate cries
