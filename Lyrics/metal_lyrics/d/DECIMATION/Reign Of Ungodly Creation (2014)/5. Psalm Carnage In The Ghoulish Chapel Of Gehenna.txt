Congregation of council of the godless beings
Those who are fed with decomposed human bodies
Passing through the ruined bridge of gore
Knitted by cracked skulls and broken bones
Entering to altar, formed of blood clots and burnt human flesh
Obscure orb is absorbing, nebulously
Phenomenon of giant portal opened to the physical dimension
Malignant jinns, ancient orators of darkness, cursed servants of sinful Udugs
Summoning thee, pedrifious demon of the lightless sun
Resting by silent recital of desperate clamours and moans of unholy psalms
The disembodied entity, densified by pernicious souls
Desanctified by the reversible complex energy
Integrity of sinister figures ravenous for delicate and faithful wretches
Asag, the ungodly guard of sacrilegious laws
Supreme calamity of gods dethroned
Malevolent and furious, emerging from the deep
Greets the prostrating goblins
Herein after the shade of doom and destruction dominate
Impuissant ceremony of fallen angels and agonizing souls
In the immortal vortex of malfeasance
Desertion of divine intuition
Inevitable extinction and the silence of Sharur
