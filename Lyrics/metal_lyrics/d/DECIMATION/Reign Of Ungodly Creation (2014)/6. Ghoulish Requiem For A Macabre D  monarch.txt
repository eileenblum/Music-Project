From the heavenly realms of divine beings from the universes they reign
Portal gates are open wide for wrath
Following this vacancy, abhorrent unconsciously
A kind of supreme wisdom culminates the blasphemy which combines their immortal energy
Unlimited and huge kingdom of sin, a filthy reign without boundaries
The reason for the curse which human race consists
Theoretical but also dogmatic
The power which brings thousands of parts together has also been managing the time
Dull and mundane, god is helpless again, running out of his fuel of sins
Collapsed hopes for a reign where kings are all who have chosen not to be slave
That power shaping dark and light, now controls the gates
Has been transformed into physical form who resisted millions of years
That power controls time and energy, controls substances as well
Incapable souls' mental torment, eternal master of paradox
Commences the collision of planets, each end is a new beginning
Beyond the unknown there exists unlimited torture
Unperceivable pain beyond time and time is dormant now
Eternal power and wisdom of the ancients who controls all
which could fall into the emptiness of dark reign
The consciousness in the exile desires to return back to its own throne
As power, as brightness, as a filthy darkness for those aforementioned
The agony created by those gods equipped with immeasurable sources of sins
No opportunity for salvation for the cursed human spirits
Wisdom of AB-ZU can hear their pain
Howling and blaspheming souls all cursed on the borders of parallel universe
All left their locations to the presence of amorphous creatures, to an abnormal sect
In this endless parade of paradox
