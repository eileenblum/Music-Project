[Music: John - Lyrics: Thanos]

Metal-amps burning strong
Smoke is rising, inhale the storm
Spikes of might, fist the bitch
Moshing wild, release the beast!

[Chorus:] Raise your spiked fist
Hail devils wrist
Speed rites of metal

Now, mayhem feels so right
Make hell tonight
Electric down the spine
That's right...

Storming now with Satan's blasphemy
I'm coming through you cannot hide from me
Bullets of steel raising hell
Spikes of might sound death's bell

[Repeat chorus]

Shout the devil words orgy of mass destruction
Revolt, rejoice, nuclear noise
What more do you want? Start the attack

Possessed we fall!
Satan Rock
Hail to thee
Metal reborn

Savage pit
Drowns the screams
Maniacs hail
Hammer the scorn...

Destroy!

Red shroud dominates.....metal reigns
Summon you all....we are as one second to none
Sing the...riffs of death demon spell
Order dies....at fiendish lights...thus defiled

Let your .....Angel wings ...burn to dust!
Throw them....down....right hand path...always false!
Circle in sin....born to win...let 'em burn!
Raise your....spikes in the air...back from hell...demon spell...

[Repeat chorus]

Like a six shell revolver I'll fill your body with lead
Heavy fire, feel Satan's breath
Drunkard rising
Start the fight
Horned we rule
Spikes of might
