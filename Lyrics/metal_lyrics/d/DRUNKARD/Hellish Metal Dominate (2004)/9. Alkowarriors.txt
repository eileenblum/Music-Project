[Music: John - Lyrics: Savvas]

Under his strongest spell I wanted to attack
Drunk and paralyzed floating in my blood
Dead I found myself into flaming hell
I drank too much last night; I banged too much my head

It's very nice down here we're drinking lot of beer
Satan rings his bell
We wish you happy hell!

Sex drunks metal these lovely sins we made
So we're drugged unholy into this slutty place
Chainsaw bullets yea angels are so weak
Living and dying cutting our wrist

[Lead solo (on a crashcourse to Hades)]

It's very nice down here we're drinking lot of beer
Satan rings his bell
We wish you happy hell!
