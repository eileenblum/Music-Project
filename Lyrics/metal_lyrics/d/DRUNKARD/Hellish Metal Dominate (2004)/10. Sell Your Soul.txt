[Music: John - Lyrics: Thanos]

Seeking the gift, seeking the life, seeking the lusts that would fill a man's life
Why should you lose, why should you die what will you do if heaven's a lie?

Sell your soul
Fiends can reign
Be a master not a slave
Sell your soul
Illusions fall
Pride and sloth is yours to own

Give me hell...

The world is afire! No room for sheep
A beast has arisen, no sheppard for me
The contract is simple. Just let your self go
Sign in your blood let the good times roll

Reign in hell...

Gluttony's good evil is sweet temptation is here
How do you plead?
Forgotten betrayed a life of decay, you have a choice
Are you afraid?

Sell your soul
Fiends can reign
Be a master not a slave
Sell your soul
Illusions fall
If the devil offered would you say no?

Behold the altar of the seven tridents
Ride on the demons of creation
Take my soul away
Right now!

Wicked...foolish...insane...
A soul is offered by will unto pain
Grant us oh joy to the flesh!
My soul is yours to take to the grave

Seeking the gift, seeking the life, seeking the lusts that would fill a man's life
Why should you lose, why should you die what will you do if heaven's a lie?
