[Music: John - Lyrics: Thanos]

Light the torch
The star on the altar glows
Moon burns red
Casting a spell as the day that Lucifer fell

Take the knife
Under a burning cross
Bitch screams
Strike it hard
Let the blood run and the spirits of Evil return...
GO!!!

Feel them now
As they walk unseen
Spirits
Now you'll learn
We are the gods and we open the portal of Hell

So, be it!
Look on this sacrifice
Dark lord
Grant us wealth
Flesh with no sin is life with no death

Blessing the unholy
Within the devil's heart
A Rapture for the storm to come
A greet of terror

Evil here dwells Baphomet's ritual
Sweet song of hell
Living and dying Lucifer's demons
Will be our friends
Eyeballs of fire starring your face unholy place
Full moon blasphemic orgy of night this is our time

Temptation fulfilled; blasphemy ended, circle is free
The Dead leave their mark; full moon rites close in twilight of night
Figures in black under this beauty are leaving the mark
Priests feeling sick finding our heresy; we shall come back...
