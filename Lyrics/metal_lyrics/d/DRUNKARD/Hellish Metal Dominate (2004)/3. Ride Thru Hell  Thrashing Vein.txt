[Music: John - Lyrics: Thanos]

Unholy ride thru hell
Like crashing thunder
Pure violence unleashed

Colors of hell.....Burning in our poisoned minds
Rawest speed.....Darkening the brightest lights
Fallen from grace....Devil's roaring keep the pace
Leather! Speed!
Unholy ride through hell

[Chorus:] Satan smiles
Flaming souls we smile back
Flame inside
Riding on with demon's might
Fire so sweet
Crashing gates at highest speed
Pleasure! Strain!
Fall from heaven thrashing vein

The devil's mark casted hard into our face
Eternal inferno
We can't find a better place
Storming master
Falling fast 'n feeling good
Pray for us not
We're demons pounding, Devil's rule....

[Repeat Chorus]

Spread the metal in the air

Gather now burn 'em higher
Count the flames above the fire
Drunk in death sing the devil's words
Can you smell the dust and scorn?
Aiming high shooting harder
Fear not the horned one master
Free your demons cutting razor
Burning lust Satan's pleasure

Ride...

Colors of hell.....Burning in our poisoned minds
Rawest speed.....Darkening the brightest lights
Fallen from grace....Devil's roaring keep the pace
Leather! Speed!
Unholy ride through hell......

Notes of death rise!
Feed the flame born to reign
Hellfire unleashed
We're the laughter of the beast
Drunkard mayhem
Bashing heads slashing trends
Common demons!
Let's die in thrashing hell........
