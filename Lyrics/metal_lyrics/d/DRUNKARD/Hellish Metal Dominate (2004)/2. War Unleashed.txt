[Music: John - Lyrics: Savvas]

Pure war supreme metal race
Bombing unleashing true hell
Frontline massive attack
Bullet scream orgy demolish the gates

Face the fury, keep our fucking evil metal pace
Count all your bodies and fill in your graves
KILL KILL! Speeding your death
KILL KILL! Battle lust, let's unleash some war

Bloodshed your peace is denied
Faggots get ready to bleed
Fucking destruction we praise
Slaughter the weaklings no mercy at all

Face the fury, keep our fucking evil metal pace
Count all your bodies and fill in your graves
KILL KILL! Speeding your death
KILL KILL! Battle lust, now the war's unleashed

COME ON!
EXPLODING HELL!

Face the fury, keep our fucking evil metal pace
Count all your bodies and fill in your graves
KILL KILL! Speeding your death
KILL KILL! Battle lust, now the war's unleashed

Panzers are ripping the night
Fucking inferno you see
Covered in dust of your flesh
Ultimate pleasure now the war's unleashed!
