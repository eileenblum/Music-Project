[Music: John - Lyrics: Savvas]

Lucifer come I'll buy you some beers
We are going to drink and sent away our fears
The master of hell must not be sober
United and drunk hellish hangover

[Chorus:] Drunk with Satan, Drunk with Satan,
Drunk with Satan, SATAN!

Devil's desire for alcohol strong
True men are welcome to booze in your hall
Drinking all sinners drinking tonight
Thrown out from heaven hidden from light

[Repeat Chorus]

In the hell burning Satan's fire
In my heart burning leather
Rebel sounds, a crown of horror
Evil Metal terror
Drunk in hell and bleed
Revive the metal sins
Pump my vein and see
Blackened soul within

Loading our shotguns possessed by alcohol
Beer Sex and leather death is my soul
Hell is our battleground war is our life
Whip down the virgin
Bring us more wine!

[Repeat Chorus]
