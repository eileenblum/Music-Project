Wild waves of thinking brought me to the death of life.
Forgotten dreams, turned into feelings of rage.
The dislocation of a logic mind,
The interpretation of my insanity...

A desperate scream travels into perpetual time.
Pieces of a false reality erase my footsteps from the sky.
I tumble into the vacuum of a wounded society
And I create Gods from your unfaithful hearts...

I create Gods from your unfaithful hearts!

I seem to be the Madman,
Who reveals the sadness?

Parasite hopes, fighting the age of Truth!
Revelations forlorn, reigning upon the scorn!

Pride, against Humility!
Envy, against Kindness!
Gluttony, against Abstinence!
Lust, against Chastity!
Anger, against Patience!
Greed, against Liberality!
Sloth, against Diligence!

Seven Deadly Sins!
Seven Contrary Virtues!

Blind my eyes to all the things you control
And let me see to whom I belong...
Lock me into the cage of humanity
And let me paint my own sky...

I seem to be the Madman
Into the world of fragments.
I seem to be the Madman,
Who reveals the sadness?

"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy,
And keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand."
[Chapter I, 3]

"I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, and have the keys of hell and of death." [Chapter I, 18]
