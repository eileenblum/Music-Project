[Bonus Track]Under the light of the winterâs Moon,
I stand alone by the sea and
I hear the waves whispering...
I hear the sirens mourning under the skyâ¦

You are emerging from the froth,
And a bitter sorrow inside my heart is bornâ¦

O, my loveâ¦ why did you have to go?

A tear is falling from my eyes,
As your memory reigns inside my mindâ¦

And the echo of our past is rising,
Beyond the borders of eternal lifeâ¦

The days we were embraced by God,
The days we were flying together high above.

I remember the night when you told me,
One day our wings will be lostâ¦
And I hold you in my arms,
As your eyes were telling me Goodbyeâ¦
