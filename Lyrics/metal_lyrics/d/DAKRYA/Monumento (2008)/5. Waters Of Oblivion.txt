Let me taste the waters of oblivion
And heal the scars upon my heart.
Embrace me Velvet Sea, and wash my sins.
Come sweet Night and take my pain...

Everywhere around us, betrayal
Everywhere inside of us, pain
And we try to keep the flame
That show us our way...

Lost into the Limbo of our hearts,
There is no Heaven beyond our sky...
There is no Hell beneath our sins.
Alone we walk, alone we die.
Like statues in the garden of silence,
We cry out for a little sympathy.
Forsaken by Angels and God,
We cannot escape from the past...

Which is the greatest fear of all?
Is it the fear of dying all alone?
Is it the fear of loosing your soul?
Who holds the key to the greater wisdom?

There is no hope, there is no time!
There is no Heaven beyond our sky...

Let me taste the waters of oblivion
And heal the scars upon my heart.
Tomorrow fades within my memories.
And I keep staring the shadows of my past.

Endless Sleep, come and rest me in peace!
Close my eyes and bring me in front of the Light!

I deny you my heart...
For the desires I will never taste!
And I betrayed you, my soul...
For the lust that burns me away!

Lost into the Limbo of our hearts,
There is no Heaven beyond our sky...
There is no Hell beneath our sins...
Alone we walk, alone we die.
Like statues in the garden of silence,
We cry out for a little sympathy.
Forsaken by Angels and God,
We cannot escape from the past...
