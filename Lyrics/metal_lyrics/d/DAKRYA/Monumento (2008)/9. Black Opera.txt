All the truths and all the liesâ¦ (the dead wishes of a child) Written upon the grave of Life. Secret desires of my heart, deadly sins of my soul... Here, shall all be performed!
Tears of blood shall drown the past, Shadows and lust and mire lands. Agonies and pain, my sorrowful fate. No one will ever see, beyond the veil of my dream.

Behold...!!
Behold...!!
The kingdom of my Soul!

Worship the land of the broken hearts,
Embrace the Silence of the Fallen Ones!

Behold... the tears of heaven.
The days of the darkest skies have come!
The cruel beasts of mankind shall rise
And the night will fill with hollow beauties...
Here is the bloody end of all hopes.
Here lies the faith of those who have sinned...
Behold the kingdom of my Soul!

Sing thy woe!
Find words that make you cry...
Paint thy sky!
Choose colors that make you fly...

Now the dawn conquers my soul
And I rise from the twilight of Gods!
Now the wind embraces my sins
And the fire burns me no more!

Audi, vide, tace, si tu vis vivere in pace! [Hear, see, be silent, if you wish to live in peace]
Aut disce aut discedeâ¦ [Either learn or leave]
Sol est fons lucis illuminans omnia! [The sun is fountain of light illuminates everything]
Tempora si fuerint nubile, solus eris. [When the clouds come, you will be alone]

Pulvis et umbra sumus [We are dust and shadow]
Hora incerta, mors certa [Hour is uncertain, death is certain]
Nihil lacrima citius arescit [Nothing dries more quickly than a tear]
