I know, youâll never understand,
Why my eyes are filled with tears.
There are no words to explain why,
There are no answers, 
When your soul is desperateâ¦

Please stay away from meâ¦
Your hands are too weak to touch my pain.
Please stay awayâ¦
Your eyes have never faced the horror I live in.

I am not who you think I am,
There is no peace inside of me.
Listen to the echo of my inner screams.
There is no salvation for me.

Please stay away from meâ¦
Your hands are too weak to touch my pain.
Please stay awayâ¦
Your eyes have never faced the horror I live in.

You can not release meâ¦
You can not understandâ¦
Please donât try to make me speak,
The walls of my grief shall never break.

I am a Sinner without Sins,
I am the One without Dreams!

Please stay away from meâ¦
Your hands are too weak to touch my pain.
Please stay awayâ¦
Your eyes have never faced the horror I live in.
