Every step, another wound.
Every tear, another pain.
Upon the ruins of our world,
Falls the dust of our fate.

Donât pray for oblivion,
To drown the memories of the past.
Pray for remembrance,
To give you the wisdom of God!

Lux Aeterna luceat eis!!

The most deceitful view,
Is the one of your own mirror...
The most sacred Light,
Is hiding within you...

Psalms resounding from high above...
Preparing us to face the new dawn!
Praise the newborn hope...
And bit farewell to your sorrow!

I have seen the truth that no man sees...
I carry the cross of a sinner without sins...

"He who binds to himself a joy,
Does the winged life destroy...
But he who kisses the joy as it flies,
Lives in eternityâs sunrise!"

Lux Aeterna luceat eis!!

The most deceitful view,
Is the one of your own mirror...
The most sacred Light,
Is hiding within you...

Psalms resounding from high above...
Preparing us to face the new dawn!
Praise the newborn hope...
And bit farewell to your sorrow!

Credo quia absurdum non credere!
