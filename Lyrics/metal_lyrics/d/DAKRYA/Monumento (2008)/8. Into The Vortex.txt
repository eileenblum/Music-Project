Define yourself!
Define your enemy!

Into the vortex of time
The past, the present, the future...
The alchemy of life,
Disguised truths and lies!

Behind the mask of boldness
You try to hide your defeat...
Fearless eyes full of pride,
Lost into the vortex of time!

The clock is ticking!
Your soul is bleeding!

Again and again...

Fight with the nightmare
Against the cosmic powers!
Within the dimensions of fear
Die with your sins fulfilled!
Within the dimensions of fear
Die with your sins fulfilled!

Into the vortex of time
The past, the present, the future...
The alchemy of life,
Disguised truths and lies!

My wisdom is my shield,
Humility reigns upon the fear...

Behind the mask of boldness
You try to hide your defeat...
Fearless eyes full of pride,
Lost into the vortex of time!
Define yourself, define your enemy.
Find the virtue in your tears!
Fearless eyes full of pride,
Lost into the vortex of time!

The clock is ticking!
Your soul is bleeding!
