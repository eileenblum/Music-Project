We are the Gods!!
We are the Angels!!
We are the Gods!!
...of all sinful lusts
We are the Angels!!
...covered with blood

The pale sadness falls
And the eyes are closed...
Sinners cry now!
Pray for your pitiful souls!

Nothing innocent comes from temptation.
Nothing precious comes from filthy souls.
Bloody are the hands that asking for salvation.
And tears are falling ceaseless from the eyes...

A bloody Moon upon the sky,
And the beasts are coming...
I will not pray for my soul to be saved.
I wonât forgive those who gave me pain...

"Per me si va ne la cittÃ  dolente,
per me si va ne l'etterno dolore,
per me si va tra la perduta gente.
Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate." 
[Dante Alighieri]

Upon the thorns of punishment
Without hope we walk.
The pain in our hearts reigns
As we gaze our lies.

Nothing innocent comes from temptation.
Nothing precious comes from filthy souls.
Bloody are the hands that asking for salvation.
And tears are falling ceaseless from the eyes...

A bloody Moon upon the sky,
And the beasts are coming...
I will not pray for my soul to be saved.
I wonât forgive those who gave me pain...

Follow the shadows through the never-ending path...
