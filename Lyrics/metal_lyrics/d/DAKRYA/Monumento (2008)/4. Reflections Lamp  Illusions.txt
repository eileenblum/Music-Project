You are the puppet in the hands of God.
You are the clown of your insignificant world.

It is time for you to wake up.
Break the walls of insanity...
Clear the illusions from your mind.
Break the chains of reality...
The mirror of lies... the mirror of life!

A drop into a silent sea,
Is all I ever wished to be!
Nothing more but a dream...
A bird without its wings,
A star without its gleam...
I am alone and I weep...

You are the puppet in the hands of God.
You are the clown of your insignificant world.

Sadness and loneliness,
The dying words of a poet...
Shadows and whispers,
The reflections of a dream...
Shall I ever be released?
Are you still afraid to die?

I cannot seeâ¦ I cannot breathe...
I have no voiceâ¦ I cannot scream...
I am the puppet in the hands of God.
I am the clown of my imaginary world!
