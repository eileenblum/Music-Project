"Thousand years ago, a tear fell from God's eyes.
Into the most peaceful ocean it fell from Heaven,
And blue waters turned into black..."

The eyes of God are full of tears,
A black velvet sea of grief.
What is left for us to create?
Inside a world without mercy...

Another prayer to the Moon,
Another wish for Heaven...
Upon the cross our faith,
Clouds of guilt gathered upon us.

Whose eyes can see the Truth?
Our souls can not touch the Light.
Bloody lives, rotten liesâ¦
Is all thatâs left for us to cry?
What is left for us to create?
Inside a world without mercyâ¦
Upon the cross our faith,
And we suffer in the dark.

Another hope is all we longing for.
Another world is all we pray for.
To turn the Darkness into Light,
To clear the Truth from all the lies.

Another prayer to the Moon,
Another wish for Heaven...
Upon the cross our faith,
Clouds of guilt gathered upon us.

"Despair became the vanity of our acts.
An ocean of sins drowns our mire land.
Only pain walks inside our hearts."
