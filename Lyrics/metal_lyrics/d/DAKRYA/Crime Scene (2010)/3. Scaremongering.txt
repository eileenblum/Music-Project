Isolate and Conquer!
â¦for the greater cause
Isolate and Conquer!
My Free Will &amp; my Soulâ¦

Human! Welcomeâ¦ to the World!
Enter this majestic Fraudâ¦

It is all about the Greater Cause,
(We have to) extinquish every radical thought!
Nothing should stand against our sacred Fnord,
It is all about the Greater Cause!

Imprisoned souls â Furious minds!
Consumable goods: YOU and I

In a parallel universe of unknown things,
I can see myself outside of this prison cell!
Take me Juggler where my chiildhood still dwells
And Iâll neglect my vanity to ride your carouselâ¦

Isolate and Conquer!
â¦for the greater cause

This is the show called âWorldâ!
Where colored papers buy God,
Where ego reigns above all
And madness serves the Greater Cause!

Human! Welcomeâ¦ to the World!
Enter this majestic Fraudâ¦

Trembling fears, who fear the greater Fear,
We are addicted to puritanical ideasâ¦
Like Blindfold junkies we serve,
Without frontiersâ¦

This is the Culture of Fear!
Consumable goods: YOU and I
This is the Culture of Fear!

Isolate and Conquer, my soulâ¦ 
Isolate and Conquer them allâ¦
