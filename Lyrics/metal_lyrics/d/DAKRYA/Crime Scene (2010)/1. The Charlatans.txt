Jugglers and mimes,
Frustrated minds,
Open up your eyesâ¦
Witness your Crimes!

Take a few drops of panic
And a little sense of Time!
Stir your ego with your pride
And Welcome to Reality!

A dazzling haze of criminal minds,
Riddles, traps and horrible crimes,
The Civil â The LIE â The Nation!
A deadly race to the other sideâ¦

A dazzling haze of criminal minds,
Riddles, traps and horrible crimes,
The Civil â The LIE â The Nation!

The CIVIL â the LIE â the NATION!

Upon a stage,
Raped from a thousand lies,
A bunch of clowns,
Perform a monstrous crime!

I will sell you all my madness,
For a spider web and a tear of sadness!
I could save your world with a smile,
If you give me some spare time!

Sharpen blades shine!

Jugglers and mimes,
Frustrated minds,
Open up your eyesâ¦
Witness your Crimes!

A dazzling haze of criminal minds,
Riddles, traps and horrible crimes,
The Civil â The LIE â The Nation!
A deadly race to the other sideâ¦
