Just take another look around you,
And tell me what the world reminds youâ¦
A carnival of clowns and mimes
The Mass hysteria of our times!

Just take another look around you,
And tell me what the world reminds youâ¦
Gamblers, lawyers, holy fathers
Homeless children selling flowersâ¦

The Urban Tribe!
Fascinating scenery
Of poverty and crime!
The Urban Tribe!
The Urban Tribe!

Empty pockets, empty soulsâ¦
The seconds running out of the clocks!
Everythingâs upon a price!
Fancy hopes and friendly smiles!

Pathetic - Irritating
Citizens of Reality!
Egocentric beasts,
Unleashed from their cages!

The Urban Tribe!
Fascinating scenery
Of poverty and crime!
The Urban Tribe!
The Urban Tribe!

Just take another look around you,
