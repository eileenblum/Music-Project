All around, all around!
Hidden secrets, undergroundâ¦
All around, all around!
Weird sounds, evil clownsâ¦

Get ready to unfold,
Every secret and wicked thoughtâ¦
Get ready to perform,
Sing along our weird song!

Round nâ round nâ round nâ round
Can you see behind the mask?
Those who push you hard and laugh?
Round nâ round nâ round
Can you name the face you touch?
When youâre blind behind the mask?
Can you play the Blind Manâs Bluff?

Enjoy the game!
Masquerade
Round nâ round
Blind Manâs Bluff!

But you should know I know!
Every wicked thoughtâ¦
Iâm the Riddle, Iâm the plot!

Hidden secrets, undergroundâ¦
Weird sounds, evil clownsâ¦

By the wrinkles on the heart,
I can name the face I touchâ¦
I am wise inside my Dark!

Blind Manâs Bluff!

From the dreadful side-scene
The blindfold puppet cannot seeâ¦
The flickering light, the empty seats
The deranged clown prepares his feast!

Round nâ round nâ round nâ round...
