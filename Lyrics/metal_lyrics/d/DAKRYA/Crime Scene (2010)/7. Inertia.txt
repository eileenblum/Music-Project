Dark cell of freedom,
Cold space of mindâ¦

Mechanicalâ¦ Abiotic!
Obsessed kind of humansâ¦
Bring forth thy Will!
Petrify your sensesâ¦
Empathy becomes Divinity
In the spectrum of obedience!

Distort my beautyâ¦
Name my scars, signs of weakness!
Distort my beautyâ¦
Make me shiver by your lies!

Another secondâ¦ Stillness!
Another hourâ¦ Emptiness!
Another dreamâ¦ Stillborn!

The clownâ¦ the human
The Soulâ¦ the mind
A dazzling haze of perfect lies!
The jugglerâ¦ the human
The Soulâ¦ the mind
A crime scene for pervert eyes!

Dark cell of freedom,
Cold space of mindâ¦
Can I specify the exact point,
Where my whole existence,
Meets the senseless Void?

Distort my beautyâ¦
Name my scars, signs of weakness!
Distort my beautyâ¦
Make me shiver by your lies!
