Beyond the seas, 
Away from grief... 
I wish to be released, 
Can you hear me? 

Dark Prince, 
Into the Night 
I call for thee! 
Can you hear my screams? 

I feel your pain, 
I hear your screams... 
Into the Dark, 
Together we bleed... 

Come to me... Come to me... 

Dark Prince, 
Into the Night 
I call for thee! 
Can you hear my screams? 

I see your eyes, 
In my dreams... 
I feel your touch, 
When I weep... 

Dark Prince, 
Into the Night 
I call for thee! 
Can you hear my screams? 

"...I Shall Always Love Thee..."
