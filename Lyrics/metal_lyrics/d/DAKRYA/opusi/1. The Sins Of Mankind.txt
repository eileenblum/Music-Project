Bound with the chains of sorrow, 
I turn my wet eyes to the sky... 
As I see now my hope dying, 
I know that soon I shall die... 

An ocean of pain inside of me, 
Rotten memories in front of me, 
And the chains are burning me... 

I cry before the Angel of Light, 
But I'm denied from the skies... 
My soul shall never fly, 
My eyes shall never see the Light... 

I was born to cry 
For the Sins of Mankind... 

An ocean of pain inside of me, 
Rotten memories in front of me, 
And the chains are burning me... 

Who felt the Love and didn't Cry? 
Who faced the Truth and didn't Die? 

Into the depths of oblivion 
The last tear of a Sinner falls... 
As the veil of Night goes, 
I look into the eyes of my God... 

An ocean of pain inside of me, 
Rotten memories in front of me... 

There's nothing to confess, but I need to be forgiven. 
I have to be redeemed from all the things I've seen.
