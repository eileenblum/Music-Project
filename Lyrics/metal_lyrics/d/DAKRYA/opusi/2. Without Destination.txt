I follow the tracks of a mystery, 
A mystery that has no answer... 
I walk a path without destination, 
A hinded light is leading me... 

I do not know where this ends 
But I cannot wait to see the end... 
I do not know what I'm seeking for 
But I cannot wait to find the way! 

Maybe I'm lost into a romantic dream 
Maybe I'm sinking into my fantasies... 
I follow the tracks of this mystery 
And I feel no fear, with the Moon above me... 

Inside the silent sleep of the world, 
Only I can hear the moon singing! 
Inside the darkness of my thoughts, 
I dance with the wind that blows... 

I do not know where this ends 
But I cannot wait to see the end... 
I do not know what I'm seeking for 
But I cannot wait to find the way! 

...And I keep walking the path, 
Without Destination... 

I am blind but I can see the Truth 
I thought I knew it all but I was fooled... 
The Truth is hiding in our dreams, 
We have to seek for her deep within... 

Inside the silent sleep of the world, 
Only I can hear the moon singing! 
Inside the darkness of my thoughts, 
I dance with the wind that blows... 

I do not know where this ends 
But I cannot wait to see the end... 
I do not know what I'm seeking for 
But I cannot wait to find the way!
