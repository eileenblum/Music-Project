Endless war
The world to kneel
No way to escape
From this violent reality
Atomic radiations
Will burn the sky
There is no future
If not to die

Prison fields
You will convict
Mass of execution
Destined to die

Hatework!
Is our...
Deathwork!

We do our work
With satisfaction
Strongs and weaks to our knees
Don't make conditions
Armies in march
With hell in the eyes
Destroy and conquer
'Cause we fight

Prison fields
You will convict
Mass of execution
Destined to die

[Solo Luigi]

Underworld gods
Shout to the war
Hallowing the losers
With a crown of thorns
Metallization soldiers
Stand side by side
Forward through the battlefield
Forward 'til die

[Solo Luigi]

Hatework!
Is our...
Deathwork!

[Solo Luigi]
