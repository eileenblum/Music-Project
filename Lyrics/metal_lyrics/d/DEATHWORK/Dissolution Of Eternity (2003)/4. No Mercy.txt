No mercy for the weak ones don't care what they've done
Guilty and victims are all from the day we come on world
Feeding hell's fire, giving life to another holocaust
Nuclear warfare will crushes us like an hammer fallen down

To running
Away from hell on we live
Deads mounting
Paying with life the price
Guns shooting
Hate and violence have prevailed
This is the beginning of the end

No mercy for no one is command to execute
Destroying and killing is their cure the peace only excuse
With machineguns and cannons going together shouting no more stop
New violence joins to earth painting his tracks with blood

To running
Away from hell on we live
Deads mounting
Paying with life the price
Guns shooting
Hate and violence have prevailed
This is the beginning of the end

[Solo Luigi]

No mercy for no one and fucking no regrets
A better fate than this can't ones expect
Another war another loss another ruthless seeker of pain
Another fallen breathing Death she's going to take your lifes away

To running
Away from hell on we live
Deads mounting
Paying with life the price
Guns shooting
Hate and violence have prevailed
This is the beginning of the end.
