Killing to this world is not a crime
Returning to the fight with fight
Ripping the helpless never cry remorse no one
Go against suicide but not for the armed god
Protected 'til the bones and armed 'til the tooth
Sentence the deceivers to pay their fucking sins

On through the sorrow and the fire
You will hear his cry
Avengers just want new blood
Join to the armed god

The armed god have no rivals through his road
The devastation always will go on
On through the sorrow without stop this is sure
Your eyes will see the hell ever more turns pure
No regrets to what's done and what will do
Like will there are no restrictions to crushing up your skull

Followers are ready to kill
The smell of blood turns ever more strong
The rope of noose rip the skin
In the fields of death hangeds slowly to rot

Apocalypse is near
It taking away all victims to the hell
Your veins pumping with fear
Your life comes to the end

[Solo Luigi]

Hundred of kills, bloodbath
The unborn seed will shall crush

On through the sorrow and the fire
You will hear his cry
Avengers just want your blood
Kneel to the armed god.
