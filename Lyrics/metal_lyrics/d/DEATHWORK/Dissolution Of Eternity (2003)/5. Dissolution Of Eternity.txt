The sickness of the past
Has buried the rest of my reason
The eternity is fade away by my hands
Both in my soul and in my figure

The sickness of the past
Has broken what's will be my future
Taking away any feeling from my heart
And now alone I wait to die

The rage devouring me
It's tearing my flesh and devouring me
Evil's sensuality mangle the reflex of myself
An impure angel call my name
And with his throbben fade me away
Both in my soul and in my figure

[Solo Christian]

The rage devouring me
It's tearing my flesh vomiting the essence.
