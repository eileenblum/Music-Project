Kill to survive
Is the way of my life
A process that goes on
Without stop before the goal
The end justifies the means
So I do at my way
I've felt the suffering
But now I just make to suffer

[Chorus:]
Of terror and blood is the lunacy
That will bring down my sanity
My sanity

The strongers always go on
And all the rest no long
This is the reality of the world
Dark as if it were a curse
But nothing stops what I play
No one will change my ways
So I kill to survive
In this running of decline

No control!

[solo Christian]

[Chorus]

Kill to survive
Is the way of my life
A process that goes on
Without stop before the goal
The end justifies the means.
