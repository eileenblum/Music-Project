Damned
My life I befog
In the darkness I will reborn
Buried in a silent and frozen twilight
Left to die alone and forgotten

Buried by the dark
In damned screams of pain

Blind
My eyes see no light
In the torment of solitude
Down to the core I wish stop for end
Leading myself to the blackened fuckin' death

Buried by the dark
In damned screams of pain
No light I can find in this life
Trapped in my interiority
I'm the first destructor of myself
Dying is the only way to free this hell

Ripped
My soul is bleeding
Weak like the shine of a pale sun
So I close my eyes and let my life befog
'cause now in the darkness I'm reborn

Buried by the dark
In damned screams of pain.
