Roaming alone in the dark
In search of light
Spirits resound the litany of death
Into my mind
I'm walking through the flames but now
I feel no pain
The sadness has taken control of myself
It tear me down...
Inside

Like a powerless general
Makes his soldiers die
One by one I choke my feelings
Powerless, my soul fall prey

Victim!

Vomiting depressive words
The tearing screams of agony
My heart call revenge
My thirst wish blood

An existence in eternal conflict
Is too late to avoid

The visions of this reality burn my sight
I need to free my primordial instincts
Killing with no remorse and no control
No one fucking mercy in my own war.
