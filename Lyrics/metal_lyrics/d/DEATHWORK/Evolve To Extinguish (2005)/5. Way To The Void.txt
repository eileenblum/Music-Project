Trapped in a shell called life, freedom is an utopia
Speaking like a dumb and seeing like a blind, slave are the active minds

[Chorus:]
Towards the void
Far from the real
Towards the void
Reality hurts

People kill the emotions breeding standards without a sense
Limitations over imagination, full of hate to waste

[Chorus:]
Towards the void
Point of no return
Towards the void
Where you will be alone (with yourself)

An endless vertigo
Of desperation
You will never meet
Your destiny

[solo Christian]

Vanishing into the void so deep and wide is the last way out.
