Take a look around, get what you've found
Breaking all the rules that's was coming down
Seeking ever more, all is just like none
One by one the boundaries come to overthrown
There is no respect, no one can prevent
Leading on the human race towards a blackened end
Shout to revolution, seems the one solution
Set the world on fire for a total destruction

[solo Rick]

[Chorus:]
Lies and you will be rewarded
Spongers of society
Against every moral law
It's the rule of life
Put to die the world
Extreme demise
Against every moral law
The last defilement

[solo Luigi]

Feeding all needs, planting hate's seeds
Cared wounds return now to bleed
Grip the power tight, are you satisfied?
Fame it's a common sickness that devours mind
Growing misery, reveal the decay
Lies turned truth will not back the same again
No one opposition, victim of contradiction
Let the world to go through a sure termination

[Chorus]

[solo Christian]
