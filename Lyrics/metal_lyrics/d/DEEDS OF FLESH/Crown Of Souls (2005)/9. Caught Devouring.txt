Left as five, returned as one
Searching for bounty
Their findings are plentiful
Greedily, he wants all for himself

He kills the others in their sleep
Low on food, or perhaps a twisted fetish
He eats their remains,
Then blames the four men's death
On nature

On weather and wolves
Bodies supposedly maimed
By wild scavengers
But skeptics want more proof
Of how they died

Not believing
The possible
Anthropophagus
All are exhumed
For more research

Studies on the skeletal corpses
Tell a very different story
Butcher-like cuts on bone
Skulls fractures from hatchet wounds

[Repeat]

On weather and wolves
Bodies supposedly maimed
By wild scavengers
But skeptics want more proof
Of how they died

Blows and cuts
To consistent between them
No animals could have left these marks
Found guilty of the murders
And sentenced to death
The first cannibal
Caught with forensic science
