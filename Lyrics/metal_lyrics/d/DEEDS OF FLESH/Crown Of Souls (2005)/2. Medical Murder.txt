Systematic probing of the human body's pathologies
Sparing none

Mengele, madman of science
Divided from himself, empithiless
In a time of free barbarity

Unspeakable tribulations
Of genetic tampering to build better soldiers
Perfect armies

Wall full of eyes
From twins killed in experiments
Dissecting the code of the inferior
The unworthy of life

Put in cages and tortured
To see how long they could survive
Direct injection of caustic chemicals
Into the womb, Sickly consumed
Organs removed, sickly consumed

Live dissection of infants
Amputation, Obliteration
Twins reunited, resected
Organs removed, sickly consumed
Organs removed, sickly consumed

Thrown in fire, innocent babies burning
Can't escape the gasoline flames

Injected with deadly disease
And recorded the agonies of death
Stood full weight on the pregnant
Chronicled the length of fetus expulsion

Separating, Liquidating
Some would live, Most would die

Experimental torture without anesthesia
Medical murder

Retched doctor thrives
On the human pain and suffering
Decaying infant eyes hanging on the wall
Dead inside
Left to get away with homicide
Thousands died

Mengele, madman of science
Divided from himself, empithiless
In a time of free barbarity
Wall full of eyes
From twins killed in experiments
Dissecting the code of the inferior
The unworthy of life

Surreal clinical brutality
Killed for just examination
Kicking and screaming they were not dreaming
All who came, murdered and maimed
All who came, murdered and maimed
