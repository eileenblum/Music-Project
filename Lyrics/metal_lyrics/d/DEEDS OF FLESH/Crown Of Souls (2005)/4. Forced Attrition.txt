Massive artillery bombardment
Counter insurgency, the reckoning
Unleashed furiously upon
The inept and morally oblivious army

Exact execution of killing
Leaving limp and battered shells to fester in the sun
Delivering atonement for murder and mutilation
The enemy flees in panic

Leaderless, cowering to mercenaries
Retribution, hunt them down
Kill them all, forced attrition

Concussing the rebellion back
Through their own killing fields
Fleeing over a sea of maggots
Releasing the stench of a weeks death
Forced to a village of atrocities

They had just finished recently
Regrouped and hungry for more killing
The painted platoon picks off the exposed
Then creep in, to finish off the rest

Exact execution of killing
Leaving limp and battered Shells to fester in the sun
Delivering atonement for murder
Death was the errand and the fate they deserved

The sky's on fire, smell humans burning
Can't believe what they see
Unrelenting butchery

Entering a village deceased
Baring witness to thrawn barbarity
Raped, penetrated, and hacked
Were victims of genocidal attack
