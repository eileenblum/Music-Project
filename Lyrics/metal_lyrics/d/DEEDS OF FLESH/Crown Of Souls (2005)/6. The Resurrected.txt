Black magic or a trick of Voodoo priests?
Zombification, a reality in Haiti

Fear not the living dead
Walking the streets Fear becoming, that which is seen
Created slaves poisoned, then resurrected
The buried alive

Left in a catatonic state
Not aware of that horrific fate
But the hell is not over
Brian dead
Forced into a life of slavery
Never returning to humanity

Blackened eyes
Wandering endlessly
Not aware, not alive
Been resurrected
Been revived

Feeling nothing
Lost and confused
Empty inside
Life is refused

Violated the law
Of the secret society

Induced into a death-like state
Killed, revived, and maintained
By a black magic lord

Decreased to a freak devoid of thoughts
The living dead walking the streets
Blank inside
Mindless, Soulless, Devoid of life
Mindless, Soulless, Devoid of life

Blackened eyes
Wandering endlessly
Not aware, not alive
Been resurrected
Been revived

Violated the law
Of the secret society
Induced into a death-like state
Killed, revived, and maintained
By a black magic lord

Left in a catatonic state
Not aware of that horrific fate
But the hell is not over
Brian dead
Forced into a life of slavery
Never returning to humanity
