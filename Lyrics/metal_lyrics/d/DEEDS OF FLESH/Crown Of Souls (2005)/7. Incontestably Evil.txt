Excremental vision of an empire poisoned
Endarkenment of the early age
Power induced regression
From all moral thoughts
Murder was glorious to behold

In the mind of a sadist
Where freedom and pleasure
Expand and flourish from
From another's pain

Suffering, and Humiliation
Nero, the true anti-christ
Privately execrated, publicly admired, Obeyed

Matricide
Ingenious depravities
Extremes of procreative energy

Concatenations of filthy transgressions
Incest, adultery, sodomy, sacrilege

Unleashed upon the masses
Incontestably evil
Free form conscience
In the mind of a sadist
Evil is attractive, aesthetic
What an artist this world has lost

Excremental vision of an empire poisoned
Endarkenment of the early age
Power induced regression
From all moral thoughts
Murder was glorious to behold

Suffering, and Humiliation
Nero, the true anti-christ
Privately execrated, publicly admired, Obeyed
