Impulses encase my thoughts
Loss of reasoning ignored
Mutilating, my fetish needs fulfilled
Sickening horrific visions explored

Persistence to see blood spilled
Pools of my horrendous deeds
Disfiguring my perfect specimen
Creating my crown of souls

The impulse to destroy flowing violently
Resurgent, this sickness swallows me
Consuming, engulfing are these needs
Lost awareness of my humanity

Abnormal inhumane sick fantasies
The desires build inside of me
Lashing out at the weak
Fulfilling the world I wish to see

I'm the monster; commanding loathsome deeds
Compelled to create atrocities

I'm the monster; I decide how you die
Subservient, you will fear me
Servant, your soul is now mine

Bathing in my sub consciousness
My own personal mortuary
A writhing sea of dead souls
The emptiness of humanity

The impulse to destroy flowing violently
Resurgent, this sickness swallows me
Consuming, engulfing are these needs
Lost awareness of my humanity

Impulses encase my thoughts
Loss of reasoning ignored
Persistence to see their blood spilled
Sickening horrific visions explored
