Through a process of absorption and conquest

Rituals of blood to appease the divine
Offerings of life
To feed the gods' hunger
Captured in battle or from tribute
The war god is especially thirsty
To invoke the spirits of the sun and war
Prevention of plague, defeat, and famine
A scene of darkness and death
Royal libation of blood

Waterfalls of red fall from the pyramid
Producing lakes of blood
Covering pits full of corpses, piled a hundred high

Ritual sacrifice on a vast scale
Never seen before or since
Communion with superior beings
The gods are thirsty, they must be fed

With a steady supply of human hearts
And Crimson offering
The blood of sacrifice
For expiation, and perpetuating life

To honor the gods
Of the earth, and the rain, and fire

The horror, the honor
Surrounded by the unworthy
Spread eagle on a round stone
Content to die

Waterfalls of red fall from the pyramid
Producing lakes of blood
Covering pits full of corpses, piled a hundred high
With an obsidian knife
Chests are cut open, they're still alive!

Removal of still beating
Removal of still beating hearts
Blood flows like rivers
Bodies tossed to the bottom
One hundred high
So the sun will rise

Through a process of absorption and conquest
Rituals of blood to appease the divine
Offerings of life
To feed the gods' hunger
Captured in battle or from tribute
The war god is especially thirsty
To invoke the spirits of the sun and war
Prevention of plague, defeat, and famine
A scene of darkness and death
To ward off the fury and wrath
