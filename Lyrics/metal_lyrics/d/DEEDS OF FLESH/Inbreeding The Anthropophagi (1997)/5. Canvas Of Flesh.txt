Anticipating the moment
When this horrid torture will end
My body becomes more and more deformed
Lying there screaming
So deformed
So deformed
More and more deformed
So deformed

Something is tearing at
My intestines
Knife still deep in my cavity

How can this be
I am still alive
How can this be
I am still alive
He is torturing me

Anticipating the moment
When this horrid torture will end
My body becomes more and more deformed
Lying there screaming
So deformed
So deformed
More and more deformed
So deformed

I am still alive
I am still alive
Murder me

I am still being torture rabidly
Let me die
Carnivorous beast
Devouring me
Awaiting blackness
To overcome
