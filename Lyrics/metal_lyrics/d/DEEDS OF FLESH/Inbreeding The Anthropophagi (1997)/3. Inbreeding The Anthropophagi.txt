Waiting by the sea
Living by highway robbery
Attacking families
With an army of twenty

Ambushing
Ambushing

Bringing forth
Second nature

Ambushing
Ambushing

Hunters bring back fresh kill
The clan goes in a frenzy
Others fight among themselves
For the biggest chunk

So many deeds
So many deeds
Our cave is full of human pieces
Let our children devour the victims

Inbred to live by medieval urges
Primal acts
Taught by cannibal elders

So many deeds
So many deeds

Ambushing
Ambushing

All members partaking
In human ingestion
Knew no other diet
No other way of life
No connection to the outside world
No connection to the outside world

Pieces here
Pieces here

Bring forth a second nature

The animalistic
Instincts
To survive

Waiting by the sea
Living by highway robbery
Attacking families
Now an army of fifty
