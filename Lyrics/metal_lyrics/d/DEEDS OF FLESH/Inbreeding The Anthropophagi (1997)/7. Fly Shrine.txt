Decomposing into human soil
No one knows their location
But their maker plot before burial
Dosposal of human flesh gone forever
In the dirt
Identity vanished through time

Dumped body sits rotting away
flys begin to gather
Vomiting and eating
Murdered carrion

Fly shrine
Four months of eating
Fly shrine
Four months of eating
Fly shrine
Vomit eat it
Festering
Four month of decay
They frenzy in the meaty carcass

More and more survive
Atracted by the stench of flesh
Eggs immerse decomposed flesh
Unburied and to the teeth
So denied
The maggots infesting the flesh

They frenzy in the meaty carcass
More and more survive
Attracted by the stench of flesh
No more blood
Tons of maggots
Fill the empty cavity
No more blood
Tons of maggots
Flee the empty cavity

Decomposing into human soil
No one knows their location
But their maker plot before burial
Dosposal of human flesh gone forever
In the dirt
