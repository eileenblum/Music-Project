During world war II in one
South american tribe
Human consumption
Of an enemies offspring
Served as the highest
Spiritual ritual of battle

Captive men were killed
Slave women
Were impregnated
In order that their captors could eat
Eat their babies
Eat their offspring

On other occasions
Conscious victims had limbs
Removed
And were made to watch while
And were
Made to watch while they were cooked and eaten

Spiritual ritual of battle

Sometimes to underline the contempt
Felt for them
They were offered some
Sometimes to underline the contempt
Felt for them
They were offered some
