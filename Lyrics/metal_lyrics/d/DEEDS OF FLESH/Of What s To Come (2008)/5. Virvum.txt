There is an energy in this vast
Universe, which connects all living and matter
Infinitely known as virvum to all
It ties all, which is together
Since the waters of space flowed
It bleeds all which that is formed
Since the dawn of time
Ancient races of the galaxies
Millions of years old
Have found ways
To harvest this valuable source
Enabling them to bend distance for
Space travel far beyond
The temples will rise; the temples will rise
Mind altering psychic, psionic, arsenal weapons
Also are forged
Traveling through black holes of virvum
The temples will rise; the temples will rise
They are the youngest race
Of intellectual beings
Humans have the strongest concentrated
Amount of force
Running deep inside
Only one man
Equal hundreds of others
Mankind although the youngest
Race and not able to yet harness virvum
All around the world
The energy flows
Making life possible
They are the youngest race
Of intellectual beings
Humans have the strongest concentrated
Amount of force
Running deep inside
Only one man
Equals hundreds of others
