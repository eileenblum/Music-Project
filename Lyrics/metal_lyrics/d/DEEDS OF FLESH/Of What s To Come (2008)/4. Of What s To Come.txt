Now unrest civility and
No more control
With secret societies
Everything's planned with precise calculations
Leading the humans to mass devastation
Majority of all countries
Progress in nuclear armed cognition
And forging its sinister strengths
Energy depletion for normal life
Is exhausted and leads to
Desperate governments set upon war
The others expect from the skies
Until proper invasion allowance
Now worried on what was once foreseen
The newest values become irrelevant
Throughout worldly meetings
All eyes of the world are clear
Sanctions must be carried out amongst the known threat
All set on global dominance
Pods start world war three
For control of energy
Pod one now complete
Their waiting for their defeats
Only matter of time
Of what's to come
Awaiting for us in the near future
Only we hold our fate
The battle among the stars will soon begin
East, west and its supporters
Unleash massive attacks
Being over armed as the pods planned
Eighty percent of the worlds' population dies
From initial strikes
Fallout consumes creation
Countless nights with no sun
Ash clouds block above
The future winds of the planet
Will bear the strong
The rest confined to the impending
Doom that is forthcoming
They will become since lost and are now
Embraced in the arms of ruin
We have decimated all we have built
Everything created erased
What we have done has been undone
Beyond the waste we'll come together
