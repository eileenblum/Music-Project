Harvest temples for the purpose of manipulation
They are spread throughout the planet at strategic sites
The temples have been used for thousands of years
By others and is only one of the
Mechanisms used for collection
For precious life energy
Herds of the captured
Led under mind control
Hit by P.S. units follow to the structures
Once inside
They're separated
By gender and age
Unfortunate are used for coerce breeding
Transported up to waiting ships
And taken far abroad
The lucky who struggle to fight
Are killed instantly
Some are transformed
After deformation into slaves
Of the host
The majority remaining
Life forces are drained
After stripped
The shells are burned and buried
Converted psionic stealers
Are released throughout
Searching for survivors
To gather more for harvesting
They are equipped with
Virvum armed weapons used for piercing the brain
Hypnotizing its victim
There are ways
To deflect
The infecting beam
Specific metals Negate
Its overpowering effects
The Cerebral hemispheres
Must be covered
For the protection against psionics
The Ones
Who are overcome and hit
By the mind grasping erudition
Cease all
Action immediately
The structures pulse
Calling out
Unearthly frequencies
To the awaiting captured
Vast in number
They stand
Staring motionless, lifeless
Waiting for instruction
Subdued hone in on
Temple beacons and march until finally reached
These morbid monstrosities engulf millions
Again and again
They will not stop until all life is gone
Terminating all of us for universal rule
Mass Destruction
Of these temples is key for mankind's existence
Survival and first victory in the universal war
If they continue to multiply and function
The entire race will be absorbed
