Dawn of the next challenges lie ahead of us
They assumed the overtaking of our planet would be routine
Mankind's will possibly linked to being the youngest souls
Of the universe shows perseverance to overcome
Showing no fear
Against the invading foe
We'll fight to protect what's ours
Skeptics believers now
Their visiting
And making themselves
Known to us
Is our advantage
For new advancements
Enditing secrets for future space travel
Dissecting technology
For virvum harvesting
Harnessing life energies
Underestimating the humans will prove
To be their biggest mistake
The cozen pods
Have failed their mission
the race has not been quiescent
Inscrutable world reality
The Earth destined for demise
Space stations
Must be built
And outer stars
Planets and galaxies
Must be found for inhabitation
Our kismet depends on it
The race now comes
Together as one
The nefarious
Has opened our eyes
We're perdurable
Of its tasks
We will learn
The Arcanum of the others against them
Leaving us indelible
The glimpse at the horizon is aberrant
Mankind will never surrender
Therefore never be defeated
The accrued wisdom
Of ancient past must not be ignored as collective unconsciousness
Memory prepares us
There will be restlessness throughout Earth as the human race
Prepares intuitively for the coming of the next great
Catastrophe and following this human tragedy
Another mighty movement lies in wait which will bring renewal
In the form of a violent and visceral spontaneous morphology
The glimpse at the horizon is aberrant
The signs will be sought
And auguries looked for
Will we be prepared for what's to come
Mankind will never surrender
Therefore never be defeated
