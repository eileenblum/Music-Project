Virvum of the human is the strongest of all beings
They will be hunted for this mighty source
Not having knowledge pf the ancient power
They are the youngest of all created beings
Although the youngest they are the strongest
Unknown alien life forms
Living millions of years longer than us
The Universal war will begin
With the signs from the skies
Since the Gods of human force
Has set their seeds on man
Evolving at a frantic pace
Conceiving gaining numbers globally
The Gods instill the art of war
Which must be practiced amongst each other
For thousands of years
The arts are redefined
Demigods and rulers set standards for all battles
Intelligence grows
So comes forth gears of war
Advancement in eradication grows rapidly
Bomb upon bomb the earth is pummeled
Invention of air and water travel excels
The art of combat
Delivering, heightened, amounts of casualties
Redefining the primitive ways of the past
Though keeping archaic fighting secrets
Mankind's zeal
Is felt through the stars
Triggering response
To harvest virvum from beyond
Ship upon ship
Head out to study and observe the planet
Cloaked invisible to our sight, unseen
The others decide
From planetary archives go forth
On full virvum harvest invasion
Humans in the next one hundred years
Will learn and advance faster than
Any time period before
Twentieth century marks the first
Space travel and intellectual growth in discovery
What was not thought possible
Now Verity
Visitors spies being present for thousands of years
See the advancement shift
Worldwide structural collapse
Is planned by the others
For the insertion of the virvum harvest
And mass collection temples
But first the seeds
Of eradication pods are planted
To alter the future
