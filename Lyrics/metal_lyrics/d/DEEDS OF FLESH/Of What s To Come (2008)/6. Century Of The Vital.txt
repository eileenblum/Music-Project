Observing the devise of Earths human weakness
The next stage of invasion initiates
Unknown spacecraft drops gears for
Planetary takeover across the regions
Pockets of survivors stay distant from the
Arriving enemy
Determined to take back
What once was theirs
Stalkers and psionic stealers
Patrol as virvum harvest temples are constructed
First in hardest hit post war regions
Preying on the weak and crippled
The survivors in disgust unite
For realization of what is happening
Stalkers and P.S. unit's patrol
Herding millions worldwide to temples
For the process
Known as entity blanking
It strips the body of which
All is connected
It's collected for numerous powers
Including bent space traveling
Worldly tapping, psyche weaponry and force control
Stripping the body of which all is connected
At the same time
Pockets of strength among us
Combine to fight the growing threat
During the century of the vital
Man will combine
Wisdom between them
To begin to overthrow
Of the intruders
In the protected walls day and night
Looking for ways to combat and compete with this enemy
These close days ahead
Will determine our survival
