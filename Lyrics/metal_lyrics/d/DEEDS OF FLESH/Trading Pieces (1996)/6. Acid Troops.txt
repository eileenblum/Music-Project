Hunting the trails
Through a twisted mass
Dosed to kill
Rotting soldiers you now pass
Killing another
Human only to save your ass
Pushing forward now
Certain death comes fast

They take LSD
To change the world they see
They take LSD
To change the world they see

They take
LSD
LSD
LSD
They take LSD

Jungle
Melting
Veritably
Tripping
I am going crazy
Bodies are all bludgeoned and bloody

Hunting the trails
Through a twisted mass
Dosed to kill
Rotting soldiers you now pass
Killing another
Human only to save your ass
Pushing forward now
Certain death comes fast

Another human
As the troops on acid
Kill another human being
The enemy
will soon be gone
Another human
As the troops on acid
Kill another human being
The enemy
will soon be gone

Will be gone!
