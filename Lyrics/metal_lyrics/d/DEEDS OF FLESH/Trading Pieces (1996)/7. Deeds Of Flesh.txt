Massive blood gushes out
From exploding brains
Cranial fluids, mucous, pus
Squirting rotten veins
Massive blood gushes out
From exploding brains
Cranial fluids, mucous, pus
Squirting rotten veins

Bodies chopped apart
By a giant meat grinder
No such fatal
Onslaught
Can be so kinder
So kinder...

When you're buried alive
Buried alive

Organs are dust
Puss bubbles burst
Maggots have lust
Organs are dust
Puss bubbles burst
Maggots have lust

Chopping bodies endlessly
Searching for new souls
Chopping bodies endlessly
Searching for new souls

Deeds of Flesh - Deeds of Flesh

Massive blood gushes out
From exploding brains
Cranial fluids, mucous, pus
Squirting rotten veins

Deeds of Flesh

Compound fractures break the skin
Repeatedly
Sockets now empty
Your sight is lost
Until reborn
Your light is lost
Until born again
They're searching for new souls
They're searching for new souls

When you're buried alive
You can't breath
You suffocate rapidly
Organs now dust
Puss bubbles burst
Maggots have lust
Organs now dust
Puss bubbles burst
Maggots have lust

Deeds of Flesh
