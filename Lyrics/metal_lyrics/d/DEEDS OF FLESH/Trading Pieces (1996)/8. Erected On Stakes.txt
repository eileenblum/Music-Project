Dracul
The impaler
His sign is erected on stakes
Brought forth
Terror to the land
His sign is forever eternal

Loathing all symbols of holiness
The impaled

No pulse through his black heart
He feels no empathy
No empathy
For his victims souls
No empathy
For his victims souls
He is spiritless
Immortal
Living through centuries

Sharpened stakes
They stand before
Future dead
One by one
Thrust upon stakes

Erected on stakes
The affliction
Of the torment is immense
Not dying instantly
Left to endure
The torment
Splinters through the skin
Keeps the bodies
Raised

Never dying
Eternally sleeping
