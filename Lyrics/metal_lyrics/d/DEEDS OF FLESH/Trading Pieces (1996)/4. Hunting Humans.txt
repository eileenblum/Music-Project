Fearing death from war
A priceless scandal arises
Scared people's muscle tissue
To be sold to others as meat
The scandal will end

Human butchers have no remorse
For their choppings
It's only a job to them
Poor and homeless
He stalks away
Hunting humans

Hacking-Slicing-Chopping
To the streets to be sold
As meat to eat

Hacking-Slicing-Chopping
To the streets to be sold

Starving-People
Feeding on
Human meat

Hunting humans

Acting so innocent
Behind
Behind the scandal

People not knowing
Being cannibals
Friends and family
Died from the war
But they were murdered
And butchered
Sold to people as
Pork meat in the street
