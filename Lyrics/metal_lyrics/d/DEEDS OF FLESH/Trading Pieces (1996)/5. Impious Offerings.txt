Hired to do the job
For the breeders of evil
Killing the selected few
For their select religion

They're doomed
They're doomed

They chop the head off with a blade
Chop it completely away

Some of the butchers turn cannibal
The feeding was thought to be humble
Gobbling on guts and livers
Fluids flowed like bloody rivers

They chop the head off with a blade
Chop it completely away

Some of the butchers
turn cannibal
The feeding
was thought to be humble

Impious Offerings
Impious Offerings

Some of the butchers
turn cannibal
The feeding
was thought to be humble

The next victim
It doesn't matter
Stabbed two hundred times
They felt so entified
Left to rot
Need another sacrifice

They still
Need another
Victim
To sacrifice
They still
Need another
Victim
To sacrifice
Sacrifice

Hired to do the job
For the breeders of evil
Killing the selected few
For their select religion
