Enter a stage of bloody dismay
Where beast and man are cast
To be slain
Chants from the mob
Feeds their victims desires
Without fail, the crowd is there
To greet the champions
And their besieged

A test of strength and valor
Spirits of honor and courage
Upon every strike the mob is fed
Sickening, glorious
For no audience in history
Hath welcome death so greatfully

A test of strength and valor
Spirits of honor and courage
Upon every strike the mob is fed
With sickening, glorious bloodshed
Glorious bloodshed!

Power beheld by the slaves
Turn them into warriors
Commanded for engagement
In a realm of carnage
A realm of chaos
Dignified butchery
Relentless
Murder reigning
