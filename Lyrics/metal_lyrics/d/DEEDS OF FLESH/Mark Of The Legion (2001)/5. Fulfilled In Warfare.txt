Armies of antiquity
A federation of nomadic tribes
Scourge of God
We are the most feared
Exorting fortunes
Vanquishing empires
Our domain is the vast plains
An orgy of conquest
Swift and fatal in our execution
Pillage the enemy

Before they're aware
Filling the air with
Discordant cries

Unpredictable barbarians
Fighting in no regular order
Leaving all in astounding defeat
Without regard to personal safety
Without regard
Savage ways and elaborate tactics
Unpredictable barbarians
The most terrible of Huns
Our pleasures fulfilled in warfare

Pillage the enemy
Before they're aware
Filling the aie with
Discordant cries
