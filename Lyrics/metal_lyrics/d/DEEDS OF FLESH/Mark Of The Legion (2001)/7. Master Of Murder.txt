Master of weapons and murder
Execution in any way desires
Hit man by trade
With a serial killer passion on the side
Afraid of being caught
He killed all his friends
His only mistake, was letting one live
Gaining power and respect
With every kill
Ended lives silently or violently
Frozen evidence stares emotionless

Contract for human assassination
Shot a man in the face
With a crossbow just to see if it
Would kill him
Using cyanide was a method of his killings
Poisoning through food
Never thought twice to take a human life
Human life!

Cold blood heartless killer
Secrets hidden inside
Hit man by trade
With a serial killer passion on the side
