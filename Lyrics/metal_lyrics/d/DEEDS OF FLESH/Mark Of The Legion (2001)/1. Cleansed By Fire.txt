Apostasy, disbelief
Pure desolation of humanity
Demi-gods, the true monsters
And their dreadful multitude of massacres
Hypocrisy, insufferable unmercy
Deception, insufferable, inhumane
Led to slavery and torture
Appointing demi-gods, intrepid tasks

Immolating on its flame
Heathen martyrs burn away
Burn away!
Immolating on its flame
Heathen martyrs, cleansed by fire

The others soon faced
Unspeakable horrors
Incessantly tortured
Hypocrisy
Insufferable blasphemies
A reign on monsters
Worshipped blindly
Christians obsession with demons
Fostered what they tried to repress
Apostasy, disbelief
Pure desolation of humanity
Demi-gods, the true monsters
And their dreadful multitude of massacres
