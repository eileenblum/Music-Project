The sub-quarters of the craft
Harbors an alien juggernaut
Psilocybin has no effect in calming the beast
Thrashing around for decades
In the hull of the ship
The Scion of another world
The beast, a serpent enveloping its prey
Progeny of an alien

Abaddon
Spawn of
An altered
Hades forged in an abysmal alien
Inferno
The heir of alien demi-gods revels
In obsession
Compelled inheritably to feed upon virvum
Forever drawn
to virvum
Forever in desire

Kept in a remissive state weak and frail
Infantile, nurtured in
The womb of the ship
Scraps of alien flesh rejected
Weak beings with defects
Are cast into the pit

The emperor finds amusement in the feeding
salivating with excitement as he lurks from above
Resembling the age of Roman coliseum carnage
Alien peons, the beast, virvum juggernaut
Ritual feeding takes place frequently
Monitored carefully, fed just enough to sustain life
Inadequate to obtain the strength to overtake
Absorbing foreign cells, consuming all vitality

Its' thirst for Virvum is left unquenched
Awaiting the taste of blood

Once on Earth Virvum will explode
Into fountains of a ever-changing foreign hue
A flourishing Eden of life forms awaits
Eventually absorbed

The juggernaut
Awakened
To Consume
The Enemy
The ultimate
Weapon for
Collecting
Diadem
It's awaiting
In darkness
Staying hidden
Then Snatching
All forms of life
And growing Becoming
More powerful

The habitual life detector
Soon will rise from the void
Stewed down from the sky
Skattered about the doomed planet
Starved and unmerciful
Awareness begins to heighten
As the creature enormously grows
Cells continue to multiply
