On a starved planet with a slow dying race
An expedition to obtain Zeal has begun
Entranced in decades of psychedelic sleep
In the far reaches of space, a thirty year voyage has commenced

A forest of alien spores decorate the interior of the ship
Creating overlapping shelves of exotic foreign shrooms
Pods of slumber, mimic the layered strain

Each pod unique in design
Enveloped by terrestrial hieroglyphs
The scent of foreign fungus reeks pungent to
The human senses yet calms the alien soul

Synthesis
Not needed
To thrive
Xenogeneic
Psilocybin
Multiples
From within
The chilled
Damp chambers
Anxiously
Awaiting
To rise

Hallucinogens blanking the alien mind
Strains of bacteria bask in metamorphosis
Breeding hybrid strains, constantly strengthening
Melting minds into stasis

A canvas of intertwining rods of cells
Making residence of the stagnant air

Inhuman cyborg pilots the craft
And feeds the cells watching over them
Soon to grow into abominations
Advanced molecules unknown to man

The emperor
Preaches the
Scriptures of a
Foretold prophecy
As ancient
Alien
Shamans use
Psychedelics
As tools to
Become one
With the Earths
Mighty powers

Foreign color stream
Illuminates
Their window to the planets
Perception stripped of all matter
Revealing the paths to vitality
