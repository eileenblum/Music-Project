Once upon Earth's skin
They unleash the Xeno Juggernaut
Perceiving the world
Stripping of all physical matter
Entranced by humanoid
By humanoid Virvum gestures
Following fountains of Virvum
Seduce the creature
Yearning for the
Omnipotent resource to the pending
Destruction of Earth
Exponentially growing in strength, power, and mass
As it consumes then absorbs its' prey

A living weapon bred to harvest humanoid energy
Overtaking everyone and everything in its' path
White blood cell generals
Recruit cellular armies attempting 
To vanquish infection
Clashing with brute force against the Xeno-Virus

Creating microscopic waves of violence
Hordes of intruder organisms 
Storm soft tissue front lines
No match for the viral onslaught 
Humankind is overtaken
Xeno elements cavort in wedlock 
Writhing in the bond
Assimilation is complete

Systematic in its overtaking 
Digesting, absorbing, harvesting
Human soft tissue melts
Joined with alien flesh

Connecting, branding, imitating, the consumed
Overtaking the prey, conforming they become one

Gracefully blossoming 
Into a mesmeric sculpture of carnage
Beauty in its purest form

An abstract painting of life and death
Merged in carnal embrace
Thunderous gutturals roll throughout
The valleys of the damned
Earth quivers from the victory 
Structures burn before human eyes
Alien and human alike retreat
From destroyed harvest temples

Reduced to rubble at the hand of the beast
No escaping its' wrath
A human holocaust of bodies
Drained and discarded into shallow graves
No ceremony in death
The bravest of men are forgotten
