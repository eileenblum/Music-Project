Dweller of the night
Mutinous human
Body deficient of normality
An outcast
People hostile to his form
Others fear
In his enemy

Indigenous to the appalling
Dweller of the night

Force to live as an animal
Away from common man
Intensified eith time
Primal instincts forced to emerge
Finding a taste for young human meat

Indigenous to the appalling
Dweller of the night

Unaware that it's abnormal
Overtaking with bare handas
Biting into veins
With sharpened teeth
Draining existence
Consuming innocence
Only ones to blame
Are those who were afraid

Force to live as an animal
Away from common man
Intensified eith time
Primal instincts forced to emerge
Finding a taste for young human meat

Indigenous to the appalling
Dweller of the night
