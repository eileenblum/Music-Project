This feeling won't leave me
I need to relieve thee
By maiming and hilling this bitch In total secrecy
From some dark place
In my soul comes a new Realm of depravity
Like a beast
I overcome her and utterly destroy her

For I must surrender
To my feelings of anger
Hurting her
Derived intense erotic pleasure

Playing inside brings a new high
A paradise from which I can't hide

This feeling won't leave me
I need to relieve thee
By maiming and hilling this bitch In total secrecy

She suffers beautifully
As I rip and cut her internally
I know she still loves me
She was my wife
