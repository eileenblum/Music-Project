Locked in a world conflict
A species very existence at stake
Forbidden to exit occupied territories
Force to dig their own graves
Machine gunning thousands
Killed in full fury

Horrifying revelations
Heaving like a living sea

The mass starvation
And pain in their eyes

Final solution
Systematic extermination
Of a made to believe inferior population

Scenes of anguish and terror
bassing vans, cremation chambers
Deformed experiments

Assembly lines of death
So called detention camps
Imminently became death traps
The healthy slave all day

While the weak whither away
Marches of murder
Killed in full fury

The mass starvation
And pain in their eyes
Burned into history
