Into the psychology
Of a developing
Serial killer
Retribution for
Perceived abuses
Diagnosed bipolar
Effective disorder
Infantile behavior

Methodical personality

Never socialized
Remebered as a loner
Dangerous sociopath

Stalked the lowest of society

The killer spree
Continued for twelve years
Victims were lured by promises
Found all he would want

Women released
Into the wilderness
Hunted down
Honoring his stills as a hunter

Into the darkness
Into the wilderness

Thirty rapes
Never showed signs of remorse
Obsessed with getting even
His basement storage for
The human
Trophies
