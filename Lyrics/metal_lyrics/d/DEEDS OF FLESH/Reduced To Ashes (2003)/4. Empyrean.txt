Sky of fire of endless magnificence
Our souls united once more
To conquer and rule again as kings
Of the great halls of Asgard

Ancient legends to an ancient people
Viking might we drink all night
Boasting tales of great deeds
And to the battles eternally victorious
Victorious

Hail to our brothers fallen
And their blood sacrificed
For the righteous determinant
Slaughtering to attain

Flawless steal cuts down our enemies
With ancestral precision
Precision
Fulfilling our pleasures of war

Ancestors fulfill our glory
Gluttony soaring
Merciless groping
Offerings sent
From the mortal plane
Mortal plane

We send our strengths
