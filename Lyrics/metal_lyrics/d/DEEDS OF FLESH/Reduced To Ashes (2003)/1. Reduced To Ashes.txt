Human kind greedy for perversion
Existing as a disease type specimen
Spreading all across its host
Uncontrollably

Rendering all forms of extinction
Consuming all essential elements
The planet's response forced to rise
Weather shifts to heighten defense

Tidal reactions engulf whole countries
Imbibing billions
Increased volcanic aversion
Floods cities with rivers of red
Gradually melting
Everything and everyone

Unbearable winds
Makes movement
Impossible
Lightning gorged
Hurricanes
And tornados
Guard the land and seas

Nuclear level
Planet-wide quakes
Engross Most
Of the life which remains

Human kind greedy for perversion
Existing as a disease type specimen
Spreading all across its host
Uncontrollably
