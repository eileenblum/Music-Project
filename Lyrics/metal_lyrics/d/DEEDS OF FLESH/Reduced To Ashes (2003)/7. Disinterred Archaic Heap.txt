Drudgery in the smells of putrid human flesh
Over time insects devour all remaining tissues
Rotting and shifting remains
Sixty miles of carcasses

Making residence under an ancient city
Burial galleries of ritual artifacts

Countless Legends of lives past help preserve
The memory of battles wrath

Reptilian woman figure
Guards the keep from drifting souls
Skeletons of the afterlife
Piled high in the catacombs
Dark paths of dimly fit bones
Skeletons of the afterlife
Piled high in the catacombs

Acknowledging deaths place for man
