Remnants of existence
Stacked with one another
Profit for the twisted with insane
Burials

Disposing of human remnants
Beyond the mortuary
Family members praying to
Soulless urns

Foul soil seeping puss
Replenish the Earth
Lying motionless decaying as
Festering oozing stench builds
Like the profits from the dead
Rancid leaking matter
Replenish the Earth

Buried not cremated
Instead lie rotting
Instead lie rotting
Infested beneath the earth

Worthless, soulless graves
From unknown cremations

Buried not cremated
Instead lie rotting
Instead lie rotting
Infested beneath the earth

Foul soil seeping puss
Replenish the Earth
Lying motionless decaying as
Festering oozing stench builds
Like the profits from the dead
Rancid leaking matter
Replenish the Earth
