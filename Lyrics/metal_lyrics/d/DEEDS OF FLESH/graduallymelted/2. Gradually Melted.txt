Caught committing an unspeakable act
Thrown in a cell, unfed for a week
Unconscious from being too weak
Leaving the cell to sunlight
He thinks he's free

Think again, think again
Human executions will now begin
The crowd encourages
The courts decision

Gradually melted
As he now realizes his fate
Panic sets in
Bound, tied and raised in position
On a metal stake
They are, they are going to burn me!

BURN ME!

Think again, think again
Human executions will now begin
The crowd encourages
The courts decision

Melted human remains
Set the sights below
Slowly being lowered to join the huge mass
Puss bubbles start to form on the feet
The skin starts to fall quickly
Tortured, they lower him halfway
Until the legs completely melt away!

AWAY!
Gradually Melted
The tires are hot enough
To even melt bone
Half burned apart
But still alive
Intestines now dangle out
Insides now start to pour
Civilians stare in his eyes, laughing at his gore

Melted human remains
Set the sights below
Slowly being lowered to join the huge mass
Puss bubbles start to form on the feet
The skin starts to fall quickly
Tortured, they lower him halfway
Until the legs completely melt away!
