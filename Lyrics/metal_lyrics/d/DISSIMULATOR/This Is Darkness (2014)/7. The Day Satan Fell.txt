Show me heaven
Show me hell
Tell me of the day that Satan fell
Show me glory
Show me grace
let me gaze upon your sacred face
If God was standing right in front of you,
would you spit out hate like you always do.
If God was standing right in front of you,
Would you try to change your fate
Show me heaven
Show me heaven
Show me heaven, show me your face.
Lift me up into your presence.
I want to see,
I want to see
Satan fall
Face to the ground as his crown was destroyed
Cast down to the earth by
The wrath of a king with the heart of a lion
Did all of heaven weep,
or was there only silence?
When the hour came and his choice was made,
did he know that all his glory would fade?
did he know that all his glory would fade?
Show me hell
How does it feel to know that one day you will burn in hell
for a crime committed against the holy one.
Did you know you would not succeed,
you had too know you would fail against my God.
If God was standing right in front of you,
would you spit out hate like you always do.
If God was standing right in front of you,
Would you try to change your fate
Did all of heaven weep,
or was there only silence?
Did all of heaven weep,
or was there only silence?
When the hour came and his choice was made,
did he know that all his glory would fade?
Show me heaven
Show me hell
Oh no! My god has driven you away!
