Will there be a dawn?
This unseen war approaches
Like prey we are stalked
This darkness falls upon us
The darkness creeps in
They hide in the shadows
I can see them creeping
I can hear them breathing
Be on the frontline
Beyond the crowd
Behind the dangerous who shake the ground
Be on the frontline
Beyond the crowd
Beneath the barriers they make no sound
Do not be shaken
By the whisper of his name they will fear you
This is darkness approaching upon us
There is a veil that shields their world from our own
Rip apart the veil
Replace this darkness with light
Will there be a dawn?
Or are we forever fighting this unseen war
Resist the darkness
I'll bring the fight to you again and again
You'll run in fear with your tail tucked between your legs
For the power behind us is greater
Now you will never stand in our way
This unseen war approaches
Like prey we are stalked
This unseen war is upon us
Will there be a dawn?
Will there be a dawn?
Will there be a dawn?
Will there be a dawn?
Do not be shaken
You are not alone in the darkness
Do not be afraid
By the whisper of his name they will fear you
This is darkness
This is darkness
