Please God, can you spare some change for a beggar?
Night after night I scream but nobody's listening. (nobody's listening)
We are headed down a path where the rocks peel the flesh from our feet. (nobody's listening)
How much worse do things have to become before we rise up from the ruins.
We are a generation that will stab you in the back just to get a piece of the pie
Form a line to spare a dime as you watch countless children die
We are "moving forward" but we've never been so far behind
We're all just killing time by putting a knife through every clock that we find
We're all just killing time
Can you hear the cries of desperation?
Can you hear the cries of desperation?
Can you see the fire reduce to embers.
We are a generation that will stab you in the back just to get a piece of the pie
Where did it all go wrong?
When did we lose our way?
How can we fight for each other when we can't even stand our ground?
Where did it all go wrong?
When did we lose our way?
Why do we run and hide as we watch our children die
Can you hear the cries of desperation?
Can you see the fire reduce to embers.
Can you hear the cries of desperation?
Can you see the fire reduce to embers.
Can you hear the cries of desperation?
See the face of starvation
We form a line to spare a dime as we watch countless children die
We're all just killing time by putting a knife through every clock that we find
Killing time!
