Stray from the lepers
The hate that blinded you begins to dissolve
Pray for the diseased
That they may learn to embrace one another.
Stray from the lepers.
I see why you see the way that you do
This world hasn't given you much to hold on too
We're united as one and yet so torn apart
Stray from the lepers.
We're so engulfed with all these thoughts of hatred
Over and over and over again
The time has come to stand tall above it all
Before it leads to murder.
Run and hide (run and hide)
Terrified (terrified)
Stray from the lepers
The cowards heart
Stray from the lepers
Stray from the lepers and run until your feet go numb
Don't look back oh God never look back
Their hatred blinds them like a knife piercing deep in their eyes
Pharisees
Pharisees.
Stray from the lepers (stray from the lepers)
The hate that blinded you begins to dissolve
Pray for the diseased (pray for the diseased)
That they may learn to embrace one another.
We're so engulfed with all these thoughts of hatred
Over and over and over again
The time has come to stand tall above it all
Before it leads to murder
Hatred will bind your soul (destroy your shackles)
The cowards heart (the cowards heart)
Hatred will bind your soul (destroy your shackles)
The cowards heart (the cowards heart)
Break free the shackles
Don't look back oh God never look back
Break free the shackles
Before it leads to murder (before it leads to murder)
Stray from the lepers.
