[feat. Austin Dickey]Rain down fire [2x]
Put on the crown that you made for yourself
You wear it so beautifully
Not a thought, not a care for anyone else
You're just a poison and we are the vaccine
You're just a poison
Dripping off the fangs of a snake
You lack conviction
Your reign will end tonight
And I watched you rise from nothing
Just like a peasant living off the land
You think you're a god but you're barely a man
acting in charge when everything goes according to plan
as soon as you fail you quickly disappear
just like a snake hiding from the heat of the sun
We will set your kingdom ablaze
Rain down fire
Just like a poison we will bleed you from our veins
Cauterize the wound
Take your last breath tonight (take your last breath)
This will be the end, the end of you
And I watched you rise from nothing
Just like a peasant living off the land
Rain down fire
we will set your kingdom ablaze
Rain down fire
You lack conviction
You're just a poison [3x]
We will bleed you from our veins
You're just a poison [5x]
Your reign will end
Rain down fire
