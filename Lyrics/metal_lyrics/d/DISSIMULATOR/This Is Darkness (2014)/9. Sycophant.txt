Can you ever forgive me?
I will never forgive myself
I've lost the one I held most dear
All because of my own selfish desires
God forgive me, for I will never forgive myself
Heal me
I scream at everything I am broken
At everything I am
Free me
For I will never forgive myself
Cleanse me
For I am the disease
I am anger
I am hate
I am hypocrisy (I'll crush your face)
I am anger
I am hate
I am hypocrisy
Don't look at me
You were all that I held most dear
Now all that I regret
My hate has torn you apart
God forgive me
I cannot forgive myself
Heal me
I scream at everything I am broken
At everything I am
Free me
For I will never forgive myself
Cleanse me
God forgive me, for I will never forgive myself
I will never forgive myself
You were all that I held most dear
Now all that I regret
My hate has torn you apart
God forgive me
I cannot forgive myself
My hate has torn you apart
God forgive me, I cannot forgive myself
God forgive me, I cannot forgive myself
God forgive me, I cannot forgive myself
God forgive me, I cannot forgive myself
