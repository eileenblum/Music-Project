When there's nothing left to say
When there's nothing more to do
Where your time has run out
This is death for the dead
Death for the dead
Lying in your deathbed
So go, and feel the anger
shadows dance across the room
Though you scream at the top of your lungs
There's no one there to save you
I am the martyr
I lie here forever
They stand there laughing all around
Will you return to me when you die?
So go on into the night
Just know I will never leave your side
My bride
I am the martyr
Lie here forever
They stand there laughing all around
but I'll return when I am in the ground
When there's nothing left to say
Beetle juice
When there's nothing more to do
Beetle juice
When your time has run out
Beetle juice
When there's nothing left to say
When there's nothing more to do
When time has run out
When time has run out
I am the martyr
Lie here forever
Will you return to me when you die?
So go on into the night
Just know I will never leave your side
My bride
My bride
Death for the dead
Death for the dead
