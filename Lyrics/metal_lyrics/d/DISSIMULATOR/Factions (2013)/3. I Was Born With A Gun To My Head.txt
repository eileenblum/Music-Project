The hatred that I feel
Is born within this shell
The only redemption I have
Dwells within

I was born with a gun to my head
The chamberâs loaded and thereâs nowhere to run
Bullets forged by a malcontent cycle of life
Iâve disfigured all within thatâs beautiful

Iâm losing grip on all thatâs real and I begin to lose my mind
Where is my sanity?
Where is my sanity?
Running circles trapped inside a cage
Will you release me?
Oh God, release me!

I was born with a gun to my head
I was born with a gun to my head
I was born with a gun to my head
The chamberâs loaded and the time has come

Some people are born into tragedy

I need to find a way out of this hell
Is this an oppression of the mind?
Or maybe itâs something else

I feel you creeping upon me
Your claws digging deep in my skull
I will fight you with the strength of the One who died for me

I will fight
I will fight

He sends his demons in disguise
But we will not be deceived
They tear at our mind
But we will rip out their throats

Iâm losing grip
Where is my sanity?
