Father, take my eyes and hold them to the fire
My soul is black as night, and I canât see you there

Sever me; I need to bleed out this infection (I need to)
Cauterize, burn the flesh, and make me whole again

Once again I throw myself onto shards of glass
Just leave me on the ground
I will just do it again for I am the destroyer
I am the catalyst; you will offer me a way out
And I am the destroyer; donât expect me to ever be free

My vision is darkening; I need to bleed out this infection (I need too)
I am the destroyer, I am the catalyst

Sever me, I need to bleed, out this infection (I need too)
Cauterize, burn the flesh, and make me whole again

ITâS TOO LATE (I will never survive)
JUST LEAVE ME ON THE GROUND (thereâs nothing left inside)
THE CANCER HAS TAKE HOLD OF ME (into the ashes I fall)
THE CANCER HAS TAKEN ITS HOLD ON ME

I am the cancer, I am the cancer

I AM THE CANCER!
