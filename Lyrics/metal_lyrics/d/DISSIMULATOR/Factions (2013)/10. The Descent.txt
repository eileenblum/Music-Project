Lying here on my final day
I watched as the sky cracks open (burning red)
I stare at the earth as it falls down around my head

Here I stand, with a choice to make, golden fields behind, dark forest ahead
I know I should turn away but it beckons me
So into the forest I tread

Running through this forest endless and dark
Without a path to guide my way out
They told me I would never make it out alive
But I went in anyway; anyway, I couldnât help myself

Now I lay here, in a shrouded meadow
The mist trailing across my skin
Silently I watch as the forest closes in

The darkness seeps into my mind as vines pull me from the ground
And hold me fast

Silent voices whisper from the shadows
Their eyes glitter in the dark with perverse intent
They told me in order to escape I must leave my souls behind
And for escape I gave it willingly

I DESCEND

Then their hands burst forth from the ground
Reeking of death
Grasping, possessing
They pull me down

Now I find myself in a maze of prison bars, suspended on a bed of fire
My flesh is burning away, Oh my God what have I done
Iâve fallen into Hell, and now itâs too late
