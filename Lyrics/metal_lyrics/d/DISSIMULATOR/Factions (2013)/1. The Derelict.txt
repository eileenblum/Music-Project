Youâve lulled yourself into complacency
But the safety you feel is all in your head

Step down from your pulpit
Look and see the generation that youâve left for dead
Look and see the generation that youâve left for dead

Tear the veil from your eyes
And see that this is a war of attrition
No Father, tear the veil from their eyes
Give me strength to light the flame that will burn their world
(Tear the veil from your eyes, and you will see the generation you have left for dead, you have chosen to sit and watch from the sidelines, you have forsaken your purpose. Everywhere I turn, my brothers, my sisters, all your children have closed their eyes, they have
lost their focus, their hearts have grown cold, just say the word and I will light the flame that will burn their world)

You have fought the battle and bear the scars
And they turned you away cause youâre dangerous
But look around, you are not alone
You have fought the battles and bear the scars
And they turned you away because youâre dangerous
But look around, you are not alone
We will live forever!
Too many times have I seen someone come to you for guidance
Only to find a congregation who have turned their backs
Have you forgotten itâs not your place to turn his children away?
You cast judgment on the scars that mark them

YOU WILL BURN

Father, everywhere I turn, your people have closed their eyes
