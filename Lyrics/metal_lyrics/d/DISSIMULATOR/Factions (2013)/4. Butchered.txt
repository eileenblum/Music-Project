I was walking down a darkened stairway
I have never seen this place before
Rooms sealed by iron doors
Behind them lay unspeakable horrors

The lay inside the fire
Their homes inside the fire
They lay inside the fire

They lay inside the fire and they die and die again
All hope is lost

For reasons I do not know I was shown all these despicable images
Have you ever looked into the eyes of a man as his guts spill from his side?

Hanging from a hook like butchered flesh
He is lost, forever lost

Walking down this darkened stairway
I have never seen this place before
Rooms sealed by iron doors
Behind them lay unspeakable horrors

They lay inside the fire and they die and die again
All hope is lost

They lay inside the fire
Their homes inside the fire

Donât make your home inside the fire

For reasons I do not know
I was shown all these despicable images
Rooms sealed by iron doors
Behind them lay unspeakable horrors
