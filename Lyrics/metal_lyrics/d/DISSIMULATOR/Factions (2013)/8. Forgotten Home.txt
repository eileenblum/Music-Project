Yours was a soul that shined so bright
Now tainted and darkened
By anotherâs bitterness
By anotherâs bitterness

Now youâre gone
Now youâre gone

He took you by the hand and told you what you wanted to hear
You were lead away by a sirens song
Led away from a place that was made for you
Now youâre gone and I donât know how to bring you back

He closed your eyes and darkened your world
Now youâre gone and I donât know how to bring you back
He took you by the hand and told you what you wanted to hear
You were led away from the place that was made for you

He showed you a reality based purely on his own lust
He showed you a reality that youâll never be freed from
There is a special place in Hell for those who defile His children
You are dead

You are dead
Time is running out
You are dead
Dead and gone

He closed your eyes and darkened your world
Now youâre gone and I donât know how to bring you back
He took you by the hand and told you what you wanted to hear
You were led away from the place that was made for you

I canât bring you back
I canât bring you back
