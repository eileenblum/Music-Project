As I grasp onto your arm, I only look for acceptance and love
My heart is calling out to feel the warmth of my father (my father)
Is it too much to ask for you to wake up?
These scars on my face only remind me we live in a broken world
We live in a broken world

You threaten me with everything in your reach
Canât you see how pathetic you are?
You spit in my face and you call me trash
I look into your eyes and see nothing but anger
I look into your eyes and see nothing but anger
I canât take it anymore
I canât take this anymore

In this broken home I stand
Staring at a blank wall that has been smashed in
I feel as though I am looking into a mirror
Of whatâs inside of me, (of whatâs inside of me)

Running through the house I find myself running for my life
Why canât this just be a dream (why canât this just be a dream)
And when I think Iâm safe you are right behind me
Ready to strike me
Daddy

I wish I could run away, and never feel your hand again

Oh no, daddyâs drunk again, and Iâve made a mess, why did I make a mess?
I try to hide in my room but he calls me out, why is daddy so mad at me?
I didnât mean to upset you, Iâm so sorry, please donât hurt me
I didnât mean to upset you, Iâm so sorry, please donât hurt me

As you run away into the dark, you fall on your knees, begging Father please
Be the dad I never had
Be the dad I never had

In this broken home I stand
Staring at a blank wall that has been smashed in
I feel as though I am looking into a mirror
Of whatâs inside of me, (of whatâs inside of me)

Your hates inside my head
Your hates inside my head
