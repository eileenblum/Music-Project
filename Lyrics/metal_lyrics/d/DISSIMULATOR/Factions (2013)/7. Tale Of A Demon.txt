Let me tell you a tale of a time
When the world was veiled by darkness
Your children played in the streets like rats
And I stood by and watched them decay
Mankind is such a filthy disease
A plague upon the earth
I've looked into the hearts of corrupt men before
And found myself disgusted
Let me turn back the hands of time
You may not like what you will find
This will go on and on
And on, and on, and on, and on
You are a plague upon the earth
Wretched and vile
Wars, lies, death, and hate
The earth has seen over 100 billion burials
We all have looked upon the faces of broken men
There is despair in every generation
We watch our children die
So tell me demon, what are you trying to prove
There is a line that I will never cross
All of the evil that you are showing me
Will not break my faith
Let me tell you a tale of a time
When the world was veiled by darkness
Your children played in the streets like rats
And I stood by and watched them decay
Slither on the ground like a snake
Slither on the ground like a snake
Be gone from me
Be gone from my sight and slither on the ground like a snake
You will never get the best of me
My feet are planted on solid ground
You will never shake my faith
