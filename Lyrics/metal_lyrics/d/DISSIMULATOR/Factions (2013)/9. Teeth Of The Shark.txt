The world is dead
Youâve corrupted all
Your intentions have been warped and your words are false
You are ready to condemn all those who are suffering because of your hate
And I will not stand by
To watch you condemn all
The world is dead

There you sit upon your pedestal
Built upon the souls you corrupted
With hate laced into the Word of God
Lucifer is calling you home

Your vile words mean nothing to me
You will not infect my heart with hate
I hope that God will rip you from everything you love
And that youâll become everything you despise

Now youâve fallen
How does it feel to be on the receiving end?

How does it feel to know youâve caused so much pain, hurt, and hate?
All the lives youâve torn apart.
Your vile words mean nothing to me
You will not infect my heart with lies like youâve done so many times

If it were up to me, I would show you the wrath of God
I would tear your walls asunder and watch the vermin run

I would tear your walls asunder and watch the vermin run

I will not stand y and watch you condemn His children

For all the lives youâve destroyed, youâve destroyed

You will fall
You will fall
You will fall
You will fall

Your time will come, you will be judged
Your time will come, you will be judged
God will rip you from your pedestal
