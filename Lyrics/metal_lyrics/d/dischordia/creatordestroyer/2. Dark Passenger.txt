You donât know me, like i do 
No, you donât 
Whatâs inside me, bathed in sin 
A creeping darkness born within 
Now youâll knowâ¦ 

Loss of meaning, loss of hope 
Who can save me from myself? 

Since that day iâve made no peace 
Found no solace or release 
Forced to feel and conform 
Use the code to act the norm 

Saving face, no control 
Canât indulge my passenger 
Living the lie 
Scars deface my blackened soul 
Taking lives to feel control 
I am alive 

From the day she died 
Felt the pain inside 
Flame that wonât subside 
All pity cast aside 

I cannot not wait 
For my escape 
I am reborn 
I will avenge 

Blinding pain deep within 
Vastly dark origin 
Lingers on for all time 
Nothing less, nothing more 
Soon youâll feel my true pain 
Then youâll know my real name 
Cleansing fire from below 
Will cure you and make me whole 

Darkness fleeting unto you 
No remorse to help you through 
Rectify and clear your mind 
Time can wait itâs on my side 
â¦now you know
