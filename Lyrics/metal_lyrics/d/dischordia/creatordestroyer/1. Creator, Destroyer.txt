holding her hand one last time 
touch of guilt, so sublime 
no more sorrow, penitence 
looking forward, no defense 
no control, pining for the piece untold 
the weaker the mind, the stronger the hold 
the less we learn, the more we burn 
break these chains give no concern 

second chance does not exist 
live your life, do not resist 
fear me not, whatâs done is done 
rest in peace beloved son 
angels are falling, reason is calling. 
question meaning, nothingâs certain 
see the man behind the curtain 
fearless, stable, viral, fable 

you wear your armor like a badge of honor 
safe from the risk of knowing thyself 

saving grace, my disgrace 
sinful pleasure, your embrace 

fear of temptation, hope for redemption 
adorn this anchor my only lifeline 
waiting for my path to realign 
searching, pleading, fading 

crime of passion, âneath the shadows 
find the hangman near the gallows 
creator, destroyer 
deviant, voyeur 

will of the martyr, sin of the father 
loosen your armor, follow the hollow 

readily seeking my own life path 
parting with sin and the guise of wrath 
finding salvation within my grasp 
beyond illusion your words collapse
