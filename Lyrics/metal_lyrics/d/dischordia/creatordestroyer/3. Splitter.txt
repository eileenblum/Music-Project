Guided by light shown from within 
Meaningful life covered in sin 
All that is wrong is all that is left 
Trying to breathe my last dying breath 

Growing contempt, i canât repent 
Lost in a sea of your discontent 

Assigning the blame between the forgotten 
Resigning to always be nothing 
My failures are all that you live for 
My weakness for you, forever more 

Try to forget what was done to me 
Memory of love never forgiving 

I canât believe what was done to me 
How it fits the crime, iâm left behind 
You pray for change, i curse his name 
I pay the price, your sacrifice 
I canât believe what you did to me 
How it fits the crime, iâm left behind 
You pray for change, i curse his name 
You pay the price, my sacrifice 

The smoke collects behind the flame 
Iâm choking on my own shame 
The heats intense upon my skin 
My love for you is wearing thin 

Filtering reality, searching for a need to be 
I canât conceive, i wonât believe 
Splintering sincerity, pushing for prosperity 
I long to heal or just to feel 

I need something more than you can give 
I need something more than you have 

Guided by light shown from within 
Meaningful life covered in sin 
All that is wrong is all that is left 
Trying to breathe my last dying
