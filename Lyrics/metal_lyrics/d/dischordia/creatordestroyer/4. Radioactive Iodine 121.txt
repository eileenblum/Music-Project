Spinning towards the end i find myself locked in a spiral 
I cannot seem to breathe, my senses failing one by one 
My only hope is fading fast as life feels out of reach 
The icy hand of death, approaching me, calling 
Continuing down another seal breaks 
Revealing the path that i forsake 
Embracing his hand i find that his touch is soothing 
Relief from this cryonic state, i feel no pain 
A feeling unlike any other 
My angerâs at peace 
I see the darkness 
I am alive 

The fear of dying 
Rebirth, remorse, loss 
Fragile contentment 
My hate, my love 
Iâm fearing the hand that feeds 
Ending all those in need 
Behind the lies 
Above the cries 
Left behind despite my pleas 
To live, to die down on my knees 
I long for the sweet release 
Between fear and peace lies the end 

What keeps me here? 
I donât belong 
What is the cost? 
Suffer the loss 

To live is to die 
My life is a lie 
My story canât end 
If it only begins 
To feel without words 
To live without death 
There is no meaning 
Or promises kept 

What is my inspiration? 
There is no motivation 
Mind-numbing isolation, worse than death 
Existence is nothing 
Pining for something beyond 
Failing at living, i need more 

I call his name, a bold request 
For me to release him from eternal pain 
To kill death? Reciprocate 
The relief between two souls in agony 

Can i trust his word? 
Will my risk be true? 
Does he hold the key? 
Born in death anew 
In death is death, in death is life 
I take his hand 
A leap of faith 
A sense of calm 
Within my heart 
Closing my eyes for the last time 

Death be not proud 
In the end, thou shalt die
