Afloat in nothing, an ocean's worth of black
A single cord that looks like pain
I know what led me here (I know nothing)
A rushing sound (I hear nothing)
The tether fades
Motionless, I fly to another world
Reality awaits, but it is not here
Fade toâ¦
Where do you begin?

When there is nothing?
Look around and see
Everything you know is wrong
There can be no end
When there is no story
What is result when there is no cause?
What brings you here and what holds you back?

Reach out for help
Just to see
Just to feel
Just to know
Reach out for help
Just to see
This is real
This is wrong

Senses grow dim
Moving shadows in the mirror

The knowledge would kill you but nothing would change
So close and yet so far
The knowledge would kill you
The impossible can never be grasped by those who know theword
This is impossible

First sign of life
First sign of hope
An ear to hear, such a simple thing
A cry for help disguised in hopeless words
Prove to me that something still remains
Her answer is cold and fleeting
If looks could kill what would she do next
Trapped in reality that binds her too
Impossibility crumbling

Reach out for help
Just to see
Just to feel
Just to know
Reach out for help
Just to see
This is real
Fade to black
