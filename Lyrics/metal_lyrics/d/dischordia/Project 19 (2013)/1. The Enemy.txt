Itâs building up, itâs never stopped
He tried to fight against it
But what hope did he have
At first it seemed impossible
But as fear shut the world out
He knew the truth

The last man to walk the Earth
Heâs never been more alone
Faceless hearts of steel surround him
Teeth like wire and chrome
Grips of steel and no remorse
Eyes a bright and deadly shine
Calculated thoughts and actions
Smiles built from cold design
Left without a hope he knows that he must be the one
To meet these demons face to face and do what must be done
The stench of flesh and fire fuel his hatred for the enemy
Screaming of the truth he knows he slaughters on to victory

âItâs as I feared
They are too strong
I am the only one
I cannot win
There is only one thing left to do
There is only one way out
Swallow the judgment that I dealt
The only fight that I can winâ

Another machine to face
This time for it all
He knows he cannot win
But heâs ready for the fall
A blast, and then itâs over
Circuits, wires flood out
The stench of burning gears
Shutdown, engage
