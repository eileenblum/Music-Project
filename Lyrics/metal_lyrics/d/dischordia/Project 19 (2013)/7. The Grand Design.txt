Shimmering lies beget this life
Feeding negation born from deception
Severing ties between whatâs left
Temptress of cruelty devout and vain
Indistinct whispers devoid of truth
Echoing a distance unforeseen

She lives in me within my breath
Awaiting death, her punishment
I hold the key to her release
A fading hope with no relief

What is to come of this?
The end is not an answer

All I know, all I feel
Consuming what is real
Losing faith in my quest
Forging on dispossessed

Stripped of emotion
No regrets, only revenge

Sin of living, sin of love
Forged from below, created from above
Have no pity, have no care
Sublimate feelings, unaware
The sun becomes our center
The Heavens begin to flee
These spoken words are trivial
The madness is complete

Those unworthy of her grace
What is to come of us?

All I know, all I feel
Consuming what is real
Losing faith in my quest
Forging on dispossessed
All I want, all I need
Lies within your still heart
I know thereâs a place for me
For I carved it out myself
