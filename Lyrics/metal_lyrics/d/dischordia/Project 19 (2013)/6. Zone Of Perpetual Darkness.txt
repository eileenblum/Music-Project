A stirring soundâ¨Screams from withinâ¨Terror grips my gazeâ¨Where have I been?â¨Wiping sleep from my eyesâ¨A fading presenceâ¨Where have you gone?
â¨A room in disrepairâ¨Frozen in silenceâ¨She lies motionlessâ¨Blood stained sheets and livesâ¨Throbbing painâ¨A growing fearâ¨Between gasps of hopeâ¨I pray the endâ¨Darkness descendsâ¨A shadow withinÂ 
How did we get here?Â 
Whatâs left to live for?â¨Pushing on to surviveÂ 
Incomplete, all is lostâ¨She awakes, dead alive
â¨Lift my headâ¨Find my strengthâ¨The air is heavyâ¨Thick with fearâ¨Gripping cursed fleshâ¨As Death lingersâ¨Do not waste your tears
Cold, dead eyes

Vacuous, I amÂ 
Spiraling grovelingâ¨Succumbing to the voidâ¨Here and now make my stand

Itâs all coming into focus. As clear as death can be, fear lives on. They livethrough fear, for death is neither the end nor the beginning. My mind is attuned. Ifeel her presence againâa weightless existence. I know what I must do. I know...Â 

They walk among usâ¨Breathless, bruised, and batteredÂ 
Soulless, torn, and tatteredâ¨We live in shadowsâ¨Never safe from ourselvesâ¨They walk among usâ¨â¨Embrace the end times?â¨Are we forsaken?

Be quiet now, do not make a sound. I can feel her approaching with a deathly moan. My senses are failing, my nerves fraying. There she stands with a blank staredevoid of emotion and perception. She is soulless, yet still beautiful. Can she feel anything? Does she suffer?I must release her.
My blood runs cold. Breath is shallow. Iâve lost so much. Death rules the day.Â 

Silence shatters meaning, nothingâs left, my love is goneÂ 
Taken by the darkness, hope is fading in my eyesâ¨We live in the shadowsâ¨And die by the gallows
Fueled by our sorrowsâ¨No hope for tomorrowâ¨She left without warning, unforgiving, heartless creaturesÂ 
Loathing this existence in the distance between life and deathÂ 
Tearing at my being, senseless evil, burn it downâ¨I know what I must do, end the suffering and take her life
â¨Sheâs at peaceâ¨No going backâ¨A love once lostâ¨A life transformedâ¨Death rules the day
Death rules the day
