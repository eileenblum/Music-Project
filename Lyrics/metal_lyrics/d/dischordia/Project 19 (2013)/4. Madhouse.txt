I wake with gasps of wretched fear
Surrounded and trapped by darkness
Blood drips from mouth before I realize
The screams that I hear are my own

Reaching out, in the darkness I lie
Eyes open wide as the terror takes hold
Battered knees and bloody hands move me through the black
While the weight of isolation crushes every hope

Sleep no longer gives me rest
As this place haunts my every dream
Pain is all that separates
My nightmares from whatâs real

How long until I can no longer find the strength to stand?
How many twisted paths until my will begins to fade?

Entropy
Inside and out
Do these walls
Know my fear?
The spiral down
It never ends
One step up
Iâm back again

Infinite shapes lie before me
Iâll die before I find my way
A distant roar reminds me
Thereâs no way out but in (thereâs no way out)

Their faces linger past my feeble reach
Their eyes hold me to a promise to push on
Forcing my feet to move forward again
My beaten body bears another step

Rooms upon rooms mock my progress
Leading me where they will
Rooms upon rooms lead me here to leave me

floating

falling

motionless

An eternity of black
Her image burns itself onto space
Glowing brighter

Brighterâ¦brighter as if I can actually see
I can see, sheâs there
