Look behind, follow the line
Where did we stray?
What have we done?
This is no path beneath our feet
Our footsteps fall on filthy waste
We call these chains our jewelry
And refuse to see weâre trapped
(With their vomit in our mouths
We gasp for rotten air
Obey the command and swallow every bit
The clanking of machines drowns out the cries of the past
Whatâs it worth to you?)

Whatâs it worth toyou? The voices of the dead
Our machines will take their place
Gotta make âem dance, gotta tell âem what they want
Wrap it up and make it shine, put away those thoughts
You need the newest faces, listen to those looks
They didnât have to think at all, why should you?

You will choke it downÂ 
This is all you need
You will worship themÂ 
They need devotion
You will take this mind weâve made for you
You will fall in line

We stand in perfectly straight lines
The shining lights draw our eyes
Can we not look away?
Look down and see where we stand?
There is nothing for usÂ 
Giant shoulders wait and waste

(We are) pathetic
(We are) bought and sold
No price is too low
Theyâve got what we need
A plastic shield inside
For a plastic shell of art

You love a name, a pretty plastic face
Crafted by the masters
The machines are pleased

You call this your life
You call this your love
Take my bleeding hands
Take my battered brain
Tell me this is real
Tell me this is right
Tell me what you love
Tell me what you know
