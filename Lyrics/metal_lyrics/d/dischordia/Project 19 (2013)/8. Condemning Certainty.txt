Blinding reason sent from above
Missing the truth, being the lie
Compassion exists though I canât feel
Illusion of hope wonât let me heal

Leaving the past behind me
I seek the lie controlling you
Between a love deceiving
Manipulate to conquer truth

Deception, the fruit of life
The sweetest decision, bitter yet ripe
Contorting disciples shred His words
Endless perversion, grovel before
Retribution spawns new hate
My last confession, abacinate
Elusive justice, allegations
Miseryâs shame, am I worthy?

A lone man's sin, becomes a plague
Enslaving all from now on

Sign of my faith, supplicate, suffocate
Loss of my faith, violate,desecrate
Sign of my faith, supplicate, suffocate
What is my faith? Own my fate, recreate

Transcendence, ascendance
Condemning certainty
Cry out to your savior
Sentencing, conviction
See if he is forgiven
