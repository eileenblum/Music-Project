Hold on, cling to me
Abandon all sympathy
Free will, destiny
No choice, obscurity

Blessing in disguise
Wolf in sheepâs clothing
His body, its own worst enemy
Seeking to correct the soul
Ravage his mind
Demon inside
Rectify anew

All men created equal
Death pays no heed
He stands neglected
Shackled, arrested
Poisoned, infected
Dying, rejected

Never scared

No comfort in truth
For those who wish to feel
Soldier of misfortune
We carry your torch

She lives through denial
Rose tint, dulling eyes
Brilliantly shining
Time wonât heal all wounds

Becoming the impossible
Pessimist, beloved by all

Her strength, second to none
Pulling thread, sheâs undone
Unraveled, stitched together
Ripping seams, face the end
See him raptured

This too shall pass
This too shall pass
Shattered existence
Peace in cremation
Lost, not forgotten
This too shall pass
This too shall pass
