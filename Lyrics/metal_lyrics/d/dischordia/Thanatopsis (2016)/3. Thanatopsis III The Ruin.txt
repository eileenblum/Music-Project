Heat
Agonizing heat
Fortune smiled on the vanished, those erased from existence
Shadows of humanity begging for a name, they never glimpsed the blackened day
Heat
Agonizing death

A sickening dawn turns day to night
A night born in hell that lingers still
Skin drips from outstretched hands
Begging for relief or reason
Black rain mocks their dry mouths
The very air they breathe is poison

Those left here plead for Death
âFind us here, take us homeâ
Those left here plead for Death
The river is silent

Flesh and fire
Broken humans
Spreading sickness
The world is changed

Upon a foundation of unwilling flesh
We built a shrine to death
A tower of smoke and fire
Our last great monument

Scorched earth
Burnt flesh
Suffering and hatred
Shroud their world in hellfire
What can life be in a landscape of death?
There is no life after this

âYou thirst for me again, seeking ways to call my name
I am pleased with your devotion
The shrieking of these unfound hordes beckons me
As you all one day will too"
