I see your path, Iâve walked it myself
Youâre carried on the wind
Youâre led to nowhere

A world once stood where daylight fails
A world of waste, a world undone
The end was here where ruin prevailed
The end of thought, the end of hope
The dark would take what had no place
The dark that kept, the dark that knew
Complete and gone without a trace
Complete for them, complete until...

When light broke through
And the end failed
Judgment stood its terrible ground
They were gone
Gone were the walls that held the dark
Gone was waste that made the world
You would have been home

I see your path, Iâve walked it too
If itâs hope you seek, thereâs none
Although the daylight had broken through
No battle here was won
When the world was taken away
A void, a nothing took its place
If itâs hope you seek thereâs none
