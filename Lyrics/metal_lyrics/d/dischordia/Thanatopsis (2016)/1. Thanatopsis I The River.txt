He knows he is forgotten
Left to footsteps in the rain
His tethers to the world flimsy at best
Meaningless details ushered him to shore
The wait is long for the passage beyond
His guide will come in his own time

Clinging to life as his flesh decays, time slows
Day in and day out and day in andâ¦pain
The wait is long for the passage beyond
Why choose this path?
Meaningless suffering in place of a meaningful life
The sound of insects
A weakened soul
The longest path
Set by his own hand

âYou have been long preparing your way
Observing each step that leads you to shore
But as you must know, these waters are slow
The wait is long for the passage beyondâ
