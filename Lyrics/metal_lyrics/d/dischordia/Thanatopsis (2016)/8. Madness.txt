I sit and stare
No sleep from which to wake
There is no day or night
I sit and rot

I am no stranger to
Bending reality
But no clever story could prepare me
For the way itâs crumbled

I remember the first time that time slipped away
Hours lost to the old manâs words
Time means nothing now
Time means nothing now
Another ghost has come and gone

My door, the great yawning beast
Waiting, waiting like the house

In a broken voice I learned of my fear (waiting, mocking)
The walls tremble as all is confirmed (closing, suffocating)
Through the mouth of the monster
Across the old manâs map
I have found nothing
This was not for me
I still get nightmares
