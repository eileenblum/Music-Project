Awaken observer, is this your life?
Shrouded in darkness, a fallen light
Born of a new age without a name
Mindless existence for all who remain

Awaken observer, what is your life?
Haunting self doubt with each breath
Today is the day
What will be tomorrow?
A dying world growing colder with time
3 suns rose today
To live among the stars
Of gods and men, which will you follow?

Yellow eyes, colors shift in a growing vision
I question all of who I am and what I know
I seek a new path
I seek my own life

Beneath a fading sky
I will choose to become more
A world of color, bathed in light
A haloed path beside the sun
(3:31 Break)
âPlucked from obscurity to lead; follow no moreâ
âChange the world and free myself from the shacklesâ
âI have chosen wiselyâ
âI overcame my destinyâ
âWhat a gift to believeâ
âWhat beauty to receiveâ

I have found, I am at peace

I awake in nothing and cannot find my place
An ancient feeling taking hold within this void
Surrender to the fading memory and see the
Growing distance between what is and never was

Contort, distort, redshift, and a pale blue

Beneath a fading sky
The fear becomes so real
A void of darkness, absent of life
How can this be?

You are nothing but a mistake
The promised land is but a dream
You chose poorly, worshipping stars
Now you suffer from beyond
