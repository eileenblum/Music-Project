A cold reflection 
Its searing gaze forms a bold selection 
This metal cage is a living museum 
Haunting optics tell a story 
Delusions grow and cloud my mind 
A fleeting figure controlling our fortune through space and time 

Staring in the mirror I see all but me 
Another piece in its collection 
Framed within a world unknown 
Trapped between your final seconds 
No escape, recourse, or rescue 
Is there a lesson? A final word? 
Wantless reasons with screams unheard 

Ascending to his death 
He knows what is to come 
A cry for help in a vicious cycle 
Desperate pleas done only in vain 
Fueled by fear 
Breathing in, before it's too late 
Awaken despair 
Breathing out, accepting his fate 

In an instant it's gone 
Vanished, no trace 
A sign of hope in a wicked samsara 
No relief or change 
Its absence means more victims 
The shattered image of my deadly reflection 

Approaching the end, beginning again 
All is revealed by the Curator 
Reliving the past through shattering glass 
All is revealed by the Curator 
All are controlled, disposed 
All is revealed and known by the Curator 

This hall of mirrors, my gruesome gallery 
I am the Curator 
I will control all known 
Unrestricted by time, a limitless power 
I am the Curator 
I will consume all life 
Fear not the end, for I am above 
I am the Curator 
I will become all death
