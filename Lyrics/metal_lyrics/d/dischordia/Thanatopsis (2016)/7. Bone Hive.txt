Swarm

A new crown emerges
The rattle of bones
A timeless venture
To find a home
A sacrifice for the colony
Rebirth in destruction

Breath in the end and wait

She waits in darkness
The hostâs last sleep
Taking life from the source
Growing death with each breath
Breathing, bleeding, feeding
Breeding, bleeding, seething

Tear away this broken limb
In its place, a rigid skin
Heart of rock and dusty veins
Fading thoughts from a dying brain

Frozen, catatonic
This armor offers no protection

Bone, flesh of stone
Buried alive in this cocoon
Puncture, watch it bleed
Shifting eyes of misery

Tear away this broken limb
In its place, a rigid skin
Heart of rock and dusty veins
Fading thoughts from a dying brain

Bone hive

Encased in what was my body
This shell of a human prison
Shallow breathing, strengthens the hive
I feel the end within myself
Splintered, ripping at my insides
New life, reborn from my demise
I will return to nature
I will become the earth

Bone hive
