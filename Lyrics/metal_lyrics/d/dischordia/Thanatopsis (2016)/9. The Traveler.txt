Where am I?
Gone, lost to another world
How can a man behold such knowledge?
Yet I know nothing of this burden
Only that this curse will be my death

A handful of relief
Worldsâ weight in misery

Gone, lost to another world
How can a man behold such knowledge?
Alone, I sit and wait
âBack so soon?â
Shrouded in darkness, heâs waiting and watching
Sinister and smiling, what does he desire?
My hideous curse, my only hope

Trapped in this blackness thatâs thickened by fear
Stumbling blindly in hopes of escape
Light, hope, could this be my way out?
It grows
It grows
It grows still brighter
Burning light, searing pain

Shift

Shrieks grinding inside my head
Here our filthy hands mean death
They remember my hunger for their flesh

Dried corpses and flickering lights
What hideous design is this?
Ferried through the endless void
What hideous design is this?

Darkness casts a spell upon these wretched carcasses
Haunting my movements, mocking me with what Iâll never have
My family of corpses

Shift

Please let me stay here
I want a home
Why did I have to go?
Please take me back
Please
