Burned
Burned
Our last great monument
The works of mankind revered by ghosts
The works of mankind cursed by hollow men

A casket of Earth, a shroud of sky
Our fathers built us a mighty grave
Death was chosen for us
And death surrounds us
A skeleton tree, a winter of ashes
Spectral songs of hatred in the air
Death was chosen for them
And death surrounds them

For all the fleeting whims of man, I have learned nothing
Though choking on a world of dust, I have learned nothing
The corpse of our Mother shrieks on the wind
âTake this bitter end that you have given meâ
The corpse of his mother haunts my memory
âThere was no saving me, and there is no saving him
Take this bitter end, for there is nothing elseâ

âMy dear friend, you have toiled far too long
That unforgiving road holds you but a breath away
There is no life in your long and weary march
Rest your tired bones where we have spoken in dreamsâ
