I give for demons
My morbid mind
Look into my eyes
Look into my mind
I give for worms my body

The moon gave me rose of night
I'm falling in the lake of your eyes

Dancers of sphere
Drink my green blood
The energy come from cosmic space
Dancers of sphere
Take my blessing body
Dancers of sphere
Servants of cosmic dust

The birds of future
The birds of skyline
The shadow paints red line of the horizon
The unnamed is coming...
