I ask you father
If cosmos is yours...
I ask you father
Or maybe it's only...

And you leave for us
Key to gates of darkness
And all power of planets
And all star dust
I can learn in one nothingness
Then I strike
In Christ's face

And learn me star-father
And gave me power of stars
And prophecy for stars
About coming the mourning-star son

"I bless you - I scoffer lord
My cosmic dimensions
And I give you my fire
And chaos will be
Your paradise..."

So thank you
My almighty father
For your wisdom
And your splendor
And signify
My temple
Dust of mourning-star
