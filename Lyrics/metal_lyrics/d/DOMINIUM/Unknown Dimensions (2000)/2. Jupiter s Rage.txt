Orion show me your eyes
Feured show me your light
Don-Ogro show me the sky
Jupiter gave me the sign

I searched on the hills
I tried find him on the cross
I was beyond their understanding
In silent I pray

I'm talking to you....
Talking in dreams...
Whispering dark and cold...
Whispering memories...

Towards the blue horizon
Towards the cosmic night
I walk in celebration
I walk across the river of rage

Out of bleakness
Behind the planet's shadow
I see twin moons
The sun will never shine again
In place of solar federation
Under the scarlet star
Under Jupiter's rage
The prince reborn...
