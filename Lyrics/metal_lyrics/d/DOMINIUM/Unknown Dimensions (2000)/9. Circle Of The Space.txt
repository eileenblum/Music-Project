I'm standing in magic circle
And I rise my temple to clouds
From where my father
You look at me?
And your blasphemous eyes
Look at me?

Arms of your magic shine
Lay shadow today
In circle of the space
From where I take my energy

"I drink my father
Your poisonous liquid
And I see splendor of your throne
And blasphemy of your majesty"

Refresh me your power
And gave me infernal fire

Your splendor
Will be my inspiration
Your space
Will be my magic crown
Your sceptre...
Will be battle sign
