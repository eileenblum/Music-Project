I see words of chaos and destruction
Written in your lighting tain
The message of comet
The message of burning planet
The prophecy of destruction
The prophecy of devastation

Close your eyes and feel
I softly touch the moon

I'm chosen one
I'm immortal madness
I'm the warrior of cosmos
I'm the spirit of new world

In nocturnal light
I'm coming back
From madness of god
Kiss my lips
And drink the comet's juice
The message of chaos and freedom
Will be light...

In sin I'm falling
In fire I'm reborn
the cosmos is freedom
the power of blue
