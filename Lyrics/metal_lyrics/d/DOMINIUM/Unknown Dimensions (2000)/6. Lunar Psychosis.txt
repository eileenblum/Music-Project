Surrounded by crystal night
Forgotten by ghosts
I play with green worms
In unknown dimension
I observe
The outlines of my body
I observe
My greatest fear

Hypnotic in cosmic sea
Hypnotic in reflection of wind
Hypnotic in crystal walls
Hypnotic in black

I see death in knife
And I serve the sacrifice
I celebrate the psychic mass
I celebrate the lunar age!
