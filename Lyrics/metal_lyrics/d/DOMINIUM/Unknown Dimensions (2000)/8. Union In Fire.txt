I touch the dawn
And I born in the blood
Blood of my cosmic father
And in fire I reborn...

Fire of the new union
Fire of the new world
Fire of new millennium
Fire of the stars

"Take my hand
Please follow me
I show you
The gathering hill"

Like wolf in the night
Like vampire with blood on lips
I summoned the power of stars
I summoned the seven infernal planets
Dominus rex infernus
We unite in fire
In fire of chaos
In the flames of dawn

"I show you place
I show you temple
Temple with the sign
And fire will be good"

Like wolf in the night
Like vampire with blood on lips
I summoned the starfather
I summoned the cosmic covenant
