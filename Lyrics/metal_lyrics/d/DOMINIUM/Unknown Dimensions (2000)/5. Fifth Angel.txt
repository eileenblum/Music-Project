I remember
Like fifth angel
Covered my eyes
Robe that darkness call
And relief me
In ebony flesh of night

I remember...
They call me...
"Darkness is emptiness..."
Now I call them
"I'm fifth angel..."

I remember...
They call me...
"Go to path of truth..."
Now I call them
"Today the truth is unreal"
In darkness I see light

And...

Don't call me brother
Because they unreal
And I lift my hand with passion
Hand that covering dust of history
Here so on
I see everything and nothing

I remember...
They call me...
"Go to path of truth..."
Now I call them
"Today the truth is unreal"
The skulls of history laughing
And don't call me brother
Because they unreal
And I lift my hand with passion
Hand that covering dust of history
Here so on...
I see everything and nothing
Nothing I see...
The energy come from me
I relief your wounds
