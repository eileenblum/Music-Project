Go with the blow and start an explosion first
I fuck your opinion I'm feeling goddamn mad

I don't care about the world
Stop patronising me 'cause it's going insane

Clench your fists and join me
Law of the jungle is the only key

You're repulsive with your compassion

Violence is the tool, which reflects me
My birth is the moment that shouldn't be
