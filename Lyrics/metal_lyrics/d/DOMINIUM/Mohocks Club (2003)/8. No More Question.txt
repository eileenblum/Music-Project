Some people say, you're isolated
They suffer 'cause you're able to hide
Superstitions
Mystification
Form deranged altars of their minds
But everything is all right
And the best way is to bury your anger
In the name of the Master of Flies

Breath in all pollution
I'm trying to entertain our death

No more questions, go away
What should we do, they always care
No more questions, go away
We must devastate their insane structure
No more questions, go away
They taught us anthems, forbid to feel
No more questions, go away
I'm not a puzzle of your game

Release you dreams
and open you mouth to the TETA waves
absorb it gladly,
without shame
Surrounded visions, Unwanted scars
Ghosts will find your body
Be a shelter, welcome them
There's a secret you have to know
But then you won't stay alive

Be my Icarus and beware the sun
