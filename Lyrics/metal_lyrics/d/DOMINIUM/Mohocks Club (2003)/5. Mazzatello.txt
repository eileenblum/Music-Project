Liberty!
Oh, where can I find thee?
Mazza will demonstrate your poor dignity

I've gone way too far
Now my mission has turned against me

Don't waste my time
Your eyes won't see the hammer going down

I'm the hand of the law
Abandon your hope
And look around

They want a show
Symbolic masquerade
Mystery of Death

Pulsing veins of your neck
Will make my knife wet

Religion prevails again
Start preying to your god

Destiny!
Is this what you've prepared for me?
Do I have to suffer for the rest of humanity?

I've gone way too far
Now my mission has turned against me

I know it's the end
But I won't die in vain

The martyr I am

I see your world already dying
I know I'm only the maker of the cause
Let Mazza hit the corrupted Earth

My death will be your birth
Release your dreams and spread your wings
Be grateful and remember me
'cause I sacrificed my life for you

Kill me now
Change your brain
My vision remains
Time will be the judge of us

But you can't make my ideas dead
You can't...
