Fever
I want to touch you
When you take my clothes down
You're my asylum

Slither
Surround me
Let my fingers find the way
Burn baby burn

Shiver
Is this a spasm of pleasure?
Or am I alien here?
Is this what I want?

Quiver
But we're still apart
So close and so far
Paradox forcing me to leave you

I'm not a toy
My ears can bear your lies no more
The things you told me, empty words
They castrate my soul
I know
you're with
somebody else
I'm not
your marionette

Here in my brain
you're screwing again
pleasure of hate
makes me stronger

your voice hurts no more
I know you're a whore
The one to ignore
Feel my anger

Don't tell me lies
Depriving my mind
No mercy now
Die, die, die, die!

"Was tot uns nicht, macht uns starker"
