Dance, milady, in the mist
A rotting glow will follow thee
Even kings will bow to your knees

For you and because of you
I'm asking sages
Who or what do we think you are?!
Captured sadness
An artificial lily
A frozen lake
Unleashed fury flogging fettered horses

A kaleidoscope
A merry-go-round
You are a cog wheel
Winding up the clock of life

A hidden tattoo
A merry-go-round
A borderline
You're a part of it

Let my arms be thy cross
Spread on both the North and South poles
Watching fire in the sun
Yes, I can truly see you now

I await the inevitable knock on the door
For the time will come someday

Just when I discover what life is at last
But I know that this time will help me to fulfil my oath
Which was branded in us
On our birthday

Oh, death - what are you?
Where can I find your trace?

Is it in the grey hair of my grandmother
Or in my brother's fading eyes

Or in the depths of a human soul

You're the justice of the world
Baudelaire's fantasies
Goya's visions of war
Dance Macabre
Condemnation

Through the tunnel of light I crawl
And then into the Styx I fall
Charon takes my last obol
Est-ce que tou sa n'est qu'un fruit de mon imagination?

Pulsing light
In the blink of an eye
Like a united song
Everyone is equal
And it ends
"Not with a bang but a whimper"
