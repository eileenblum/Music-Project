Call me, call me...
I'm not your imagination
Your hysteria makes me stronger...
Call Daddy with a hook looking for salvation
I'll traverse mountains to be your shepherd
I'll do it especially for you
Everybody knows, but nobody talks
Polishinel's secret

People think I'm crazy - whatever
I'm the fan of killing - forever
I am the jack-in-the-box
Time to meet me baby - together
Welcome to my Urban legend

Follow me
Leave me be
Time to thrill

People think I'm crazy - whatever
I'm the fan of killing - forever
Welcome to my heart break hotel
Time to meet me baby - together
Welcome to fright night

Fear I sense
Dark romance
Time to kill

For me - Euphoria
For you - Agony
For us - damnation forever
Come to me my fragile bride

The hook in my hand
Unchains your pain
Hidden behind the mask

Give it to me
I feel what you feel
Till death do us part

Step by step through the centuries
My spirit will equal with the god's of mayhem

That's the end of mystification
Now you're down, but I want more
Every soul is my resurrection
Dark embrace and I'm reborn
I'm reborn
over and over again
