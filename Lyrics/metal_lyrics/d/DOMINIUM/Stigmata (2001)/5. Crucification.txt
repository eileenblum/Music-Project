Crucification
I'm the insane law creation
Condemnation
You're the breath I taken
Unknown
I wanna cut you down, suck your body
If you are not believer
I dream about evil of your children
No one can feel safe
Immolation
I'm the dweller of this location
Dispensation
All the things we loved
Are vroken
God of creation
This dream is unreal
Dog barking in my head
Murder's awaken to kill
Blood in your hands
Shouting in nightmares
Gun was prepared
I can't wait for the others
