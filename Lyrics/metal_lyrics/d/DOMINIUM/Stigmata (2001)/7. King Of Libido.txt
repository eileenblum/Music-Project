King of libido
The most silent wing
Bastard of daylight
Unholy womb for sins

Paint in black
Everyone
Now we'll speak
Legion of skulls
Ordinary, dustly and sick

Everyone want to sell you
You
Dude
Could I
Cut it
Now?
You made lust
Northern bizarre
Enemy of sanity
Give me back in liberty
Your name is Lucifer
Sometimes Belial
Left hand part
Isn't a slaves way
Go
Let me live
For a while

Goodbye
I'm the enemy of myself
