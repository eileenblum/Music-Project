War throne
Dark mystery
I feel something burning
In me
In you
I can't remember what I've done
Condemnation
Sadistically
Someone forced me to live with something evil
They chosen my religion
The religion give them power
I saw the hollow bodies
Wired by demons
MK-ultra
Date of birth
MK-ultra
Second life
Date of birth
Second life
Liars
Why
I'm not your doll
Now, I don't want to live for your fun
Hypnosis from your politics is over
There is no way to run
That's the point which I discovered
I know
You
Don't forget about it
