Freedom of choices hurts somebody dreams
In the night I started my day
So sadistical
Moving through mirrors and pictures
I saw they laughing at my...
I feel the dangerous
Allure my beast
So sadistical
All the fevers
Are on your list
Special gift, would you like?
Poison
Blessing
Strange kind of hate
Temptation
Vengeance
War for a while
I'm coming down
I don't know why
Take my hand or...
Save yourself and run
Listening
Whispering
I feel the voice of unknown
I'm the one
Only son
Your head will be my hole
Liberty
Dignity
Are verses from my womb
You're the one
I've waited for
Beckon the call
