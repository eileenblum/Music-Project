You think I'm easy cause I'm your child
I heard a message inside my brain
Today is no future to mankind
I'm waiting father for your first kiss and sign
I feel your fingers in my mouth
Please stop discover my thoughts
You made us unhappy, I'm shadow
Don't let
Let me down
Now
Is a knife
Eyes solution is my wave
Don't let
Let me in
Down
It's a kind
Soul rotation that's my fucking bride
Assassin way
Assassin fire
Together
But always apart
I'm walking in a strange town
Thinking about suicide
It's just looking for a friendship with knives, bullets...
To provoke her
Majesty
Give me father piece of your body, now
Give me truth, stolen from someone
