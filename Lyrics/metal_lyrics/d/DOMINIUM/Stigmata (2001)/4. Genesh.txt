I call your name in the darkest hour in solitude
Two years ago I was different kind of human
You made me strong Genesh
Wisdom
Mystery
Lividness of soul
Of soul
Altogether faded
Elephant Man
Winds talk to me I know that I'm touching strange individuality
If you were mine you will split yourself immediately
I live in everyone thoughts
Fragile souls dying in the predators crowd
I am the millionaire
Soul collector
In your will I'm the dweller
Bloody dreams untold
I got the plan for you
Start study somebody's face
When you'll ready I came
I'm the killer of myself
Thrill of the dark
It's stronger than me
Forcing me
It's like
Killing
