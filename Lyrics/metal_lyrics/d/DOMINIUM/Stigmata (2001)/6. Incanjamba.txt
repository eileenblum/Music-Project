For all this time, million years ago
I found the secret in their eyes
A thousands children, girls and boys
Embraced death, they cut the line of life
We'll meet at my waterfall
I'll force you
Howick
Waterfall
My name
Is...
Incanjamba
Sacrifice
Snake
Demonical possession
Sacrifice
Shaman
White scapegoat
My name
Is
Incanjamba
Die by your fathers hand
I want to be your confessor
Tell me everything about yourself
And I'll die for you
I was born to be your confessor
Let me became familiar with you
Jump through my mouth
Suicide
Gate
Slave
Lust
Everlasting
never
Stay away from me
I'm insane
I can't breathe
Stay away
World is sold
