Misfits children but I don't care
Brand new god
Flowers of evil
Changed the world
Don't forget your dreams

Salvador
JFK
They sucked their freedom from mothers milk
Time is yours
The our has come
I salute on you
You're the chosen one

There is too much confusion in your mind
I see the letter in the bottle in your head
Don't give up
You can't break your promises
My life without you
Won't remains the same
