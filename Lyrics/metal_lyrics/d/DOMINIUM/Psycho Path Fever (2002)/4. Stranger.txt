Just like a bird
In a darkned cage
I grew up in captivity
Now I know who I am
Feel me now, little whore!

I adore pain
The taste of lust I'm cravening for

No one can see me
Call me a number
Someone designed us to fall down again and again

She's lying naked on my floor
She wanted a special guest inside her
She is now beyond time

I feel the faul blood in my veins
I heard her scream but I don't feel ashamed
In the dark we trust

The evil horde took us deep beneath
The lightning strokes burning all everywhere
My body's falling and I don't know where

Help me, see me now
Believe in me, I know I lied
Embrace me, I'm a stranger here
