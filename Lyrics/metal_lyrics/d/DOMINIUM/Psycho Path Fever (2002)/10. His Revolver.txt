Once nested in human dust
The son of goats is hiding from the light
His vengeance is like a machine gun
Creating and destroying all humanity

Hey, girl on the wild don't drink the holy water
Future of mankind depends on his semen

Be prepared
Everyday
Something huge is coming
Seven seals
Open them
Until the beast is free
