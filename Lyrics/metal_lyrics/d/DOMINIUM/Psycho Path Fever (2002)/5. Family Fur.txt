I was born because my father didn't
Want to spank the monkey that day
We are the prisoners of our bodies
We learn and then we go away
Go away

You didn't even think about that time
But you created a beast
Now your son is insane
And world should be afraid of his cannibal fest

Give me back my liberty
I sucked it from my mother's milk
We've begun new revolution
Open your eyes to the wind

Why don't you treat me right
I am the product of your desire so why
Did you leave me alone I feel
People designed dolls to rule them
And they show their fury anytime they want
I'm not your toy
I'm the reflection of your faults
