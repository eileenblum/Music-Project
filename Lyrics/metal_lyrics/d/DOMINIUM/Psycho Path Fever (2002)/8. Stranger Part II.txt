Just like a bird
In a darkned cage
I grew up in captivity
Now I know who I am
Feel me now, little whore!
I adore pain
The taste of lust I'm cravening for

No one can see me

I an smell the danger is near
I cannot move my feet, I cannot breathe
It doesn't matter who you are
Someone starts hunting us, it's time to run
Hell hounds are chasing us with madness
A swarm of bullets is looking for a target
It doesn't matter who you are
Someone starts hunting us, it's time to run

When I looked into your eyes
The cup of life I saw
I couldn't resist to drink your blood
I let you free to meet your lord
Whore!

If you have a reason to live
If you have a reason to fight once more
Then it's time to be a man
Even though the ones you loved are gone

Say my name
Cry at my wounds
Let them bleed
My enemies are here but I'm not afraid

She's lying naked on my floor
She wanted a special guest inside her
She is now beyond time

Her steps are burning in my thoughts
I bought a knives and a silver gun
All I want is a touch of hell

Help me, see me now
Believe in me, I know I lied
Embrace me, I'm a stranger here
