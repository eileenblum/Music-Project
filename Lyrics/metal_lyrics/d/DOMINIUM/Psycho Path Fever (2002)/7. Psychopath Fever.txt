Put your gun in my mouth
Feed my ears with lies
Do it hard

I've destroyed everything I could
I can't remember anything
So give me something pure I devour
My mind is stripped of mercy
I'm laughing at your face

Give me fear that I can feel
Bless me with death that I'm looking for
Do your best to thrill my soul
I want more to become real
I can't pray anymore

Death is like an unexpecting guest
She comes to you when you're alone
...She's forcing us to cry even when we're cold
When our journey is over we'll find
Calmness and forgiveness
