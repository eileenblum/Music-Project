I want you now
It's just another bad dream that I lost
Somebody somehow
And you slipped
Between my hands
I want you back
Again
Wash away my suffering
I feel ashamed
Crying every night
That's the way it is
And this is the time
When I'm just loosing my mind
And before you awake
Wet my bed
Wet my shoes
I don't want to see you crying
Inside of me
I want you back
Forever
I want you back
