"Well, if you talk to the average teen-ager of today and you ask them what it is about Rock 'n' Roll music that they like, the first thing they'll say is: the beat, the beat, the beat"

Sexy lover dude
Lightning is calling you
When you shake the little thing you do
The dance-floor belongs to you

No matter what time, no matter what day
The beating, pumping, jumping rhythm is here to stay
It don't take long to read our needs
Just come on in and feel the beat
The beat

The devil will possess us both
Possessed us with the rock 'n' roll
Shake the night into the beat
We know what we love and feel

No matter what time, no matter what day
The beating, pumping, jumping rhythm is here to stay
It don't take time to read our needs
Just come on in and feel the beat
