From the dolls switching mourning
To a corner of life, who are hiding
One life is hiding as it cries
As the other hails the dolls like human lives

A shapeless god in a room of dolls did the yell
From the cradle goes the bell

Other rooms do the ticks
As the body goes in flips
One life still hiding as it cries

A shapeless god in a room of dolls did the yell
From the cradle goes the bell

Just let me see them all ticking through the hall late at night
Ticking with their bells, yes, ticking, ticking, ticking to my mind
Welcome to a world where you have to explore

They do the demon sign, could the sign be from Hell?

Just let me see them all ticking through the hall late at night
Ticking with their bells, yes, ticking, ticking, ticking to my mind
From the cradle goes the bell

Just let me see them all ticking through the hall late at night
Ticking with their bells, yes, ticking, ticking, ticking to my mind
Welcome to a world where you have to explore

From the cradle, from the cradle goes the bell

From the dolls switching mourning
To a corner of life, who are hiding
One life is hiding as it cries
As the other hails the dolls like human lives

A shapeless god in a room of dolls did the yell
From the cradle goes the bell
The Bell
