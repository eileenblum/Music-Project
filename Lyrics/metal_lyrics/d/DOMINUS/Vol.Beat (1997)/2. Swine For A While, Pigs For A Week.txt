Face me fool
And don't you dare to lie to me
I have the reason to get away from
All that is you
I can't refuse I been a swine for a while
But then again, I just give back all I can

Just fall down on your knees
But that don't help anymore
Like 1000 tears should help me when you are wrong
Don't start that smart-arse talk
The words are not your own
You are just a copy of another clown

Shit for shit
You know exactly what I mean
You should taste my fist
But that don't get us even
Just go away, I can't stand your fucking face
The yellow thing will fucking haunt you any way

Just fall down on your knees
But that don't help anymore
Like 1000 tears should help me when you are wrong
Don't start that smart-arse talk
The words are not your own
You are just a copy of another clown

Swine for a while
You were a swine for a while
I was a swine for a while
We were pigs for a week
