"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel and rhythm and blues; it sprang from that"

You know the kind of feeling
When you drink until you're sleeping
And you work between the hooters
Screaming rock 'n' roll

Can't remember fucking
But you know your head is knocking
And you say you're oh so sorry
Cause you puked at her door

I got the feeling that I'm wasting my time
I got the reasons to get fucked up some time
I got this funny looking chick in my seat
I got my baby, I got the booze, I got the beat

Lipstick on my body
As I'm cruising in the caddy
Do you like to show your moves in the car
You twist it and you turn it
And I'm shaking, cause I'm burning
Oh baby, baby, you so hot 'n' cruel

I got the feeling that I'm wasting my time
I got the reasons to get fucked up some time
I got this funny looking chick in my seat
I got my baby, I got the booze, I got the beat

You know the kind of feeling
When you drink until you're sleeping
And you work between the hooters
Screaming rock 'n' roll

Can't remember fucking
But you know your head is knocking
And you say you're oh so sorry
Cause you puked at her door

I got the feeling that I'm wasting my time
I got the reasons to get fucked up some time
I got this funny looking chick in my seat
I got my baby, I got the booze, I got the...
I got the beat!
