"What about today?
What?
Do you remember what you said, you would do, if you got a hit record, you said you would go out and preach His word!
Did I say that? That's funny, I don't remember saying that, I must have been drunk!"

A little less conversation
A little more, little more action please
Nonsense are the words you speak
Alway thinking how I miss your happiness

Beat, booze, is what I fucking choose
Let's call the rhythm from below
And see the devil do the hops
While we scream, that's what we love
This is what we love, love, love

Beat, booze, is what I fucking choose
Let's call the rhythm from below
And see the devil do the hops
While we scream, that's what we love
This is what we love, love, love
