"My eyes feel so heavy, must not fall alseep, must not fall asleep, must not fall asleep..."

Disturbing voices from the inside
The howling, screaming in my mind
Can't find the peace to do a thing
Ohh, baby, baby, baby, take these hands of me
And let me be

Remember the days with the first 9
I think they might drop by
Must not, must not, must not fall asleep
What do you want from me

My eyes feel so heavy
Must not fall asleep, must not fall alseep, must not fall asleep

I think I blacked out
Ohh, how blue I see
Ohh, how blue I see

It's not the heaven sky
It's the demon seed

Disturbing voices from the inside
The howling, screaming in my mind
Can't find the peace to do a thing
Ohh, baby, baby, baby, take these hands of me
And let me be

Remember the days with the first 9
I think they might be dropping by
Must not, must not, must not fall asleep

Disturbing voices from the inside
The howling, screaming in my mind
Can't find the peace to do a thing
Ohh, baby, baby, baby, take these hands of me
And let me be

Remember the days with the first 9
I think they might drop by
Must not, must not, must not fall asleep
What do you want from me
