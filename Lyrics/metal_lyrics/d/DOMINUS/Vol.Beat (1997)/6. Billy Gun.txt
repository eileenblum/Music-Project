So we meet again, Billy Gun
Pull your gun if you dare
They say you fast as the light can go
We'll see, we'll see

You don't have the time to blink
The grip will get you soon
You'll be nothing by dawn
Just show me your wildest move, my boy
But you'll bleed, you'll bleed

I can swallow your pity bullets, Billy boy
You can't do me no harm
Tell your dudes the law is back in town
They'll fear, they'll fear

When the sun is down, that will be the time
One man will go down
I just have to say to you boy
You'll sleep, you'll sleep
