"You take a white right hand and a black left hand and what do you got? Son, you got rock 'n' roll!"

I feel I need this path to get away
From the same old bullshit
We live in everyday
Just screaming, screaming where's
The path that leads to rock 'n' roll

Along with me I brought the demon seed
I let it click, click, click
And out came what I need
Screaming, screaming where's
The path that leads to rock 'n' roll

In this wood this house was going wild
All the devils and witches
Oh yeah, they were invited
Screaming, screaming here I come
I love the rock 'n' roll

Along with me I brought the demon seed
I Let it click, click, click
And out comes what I need
Screaming, screaming here I come
I love the rock 'n' roll

In the house the vol beat rolled
I can't believe I saw a priest who
Was stomping out of tune
The devil and the witches danced
With the burning, burning booze, booze, booze
In their hands

The priest was looking at this wild dancing girl
(he said) how do you learn to move this thing, you will burn
(she said) I felt it in the music and I feel, oh so good
The priest was so horny, that he ripped off her clothes

I feel I need this path to get away
Get away from the same old bullshit
We live in every day
Screaming, screaming I was there, I love
The rock 'n' roll
