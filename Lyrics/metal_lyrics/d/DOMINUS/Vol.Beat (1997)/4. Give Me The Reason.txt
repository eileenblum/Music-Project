"Your mama's right, it is the Devil's music"

Oh, yellow beat devil man
You play with my dream-state again
Remember the blue crystal days
You took me to a journey just to kill

Oh yellow beat devil man
No mercy's rolling in your head
Just tell me what you thinking of
I like to know, it turns me on

Your strength is so far beyond
Like cartoons, no limits at all
That may now set my questions free
Are you invented, are you real?

May his words now go away
Give me peace for one single day
How I wish, how I wish control
Over my dreams to let you go

Oh, yellow beat devil man
You play with my dream-state again
Remember the blue crystal days
You took me to a journey just to kill

One thing I know, the colour that you use
Have a reason to the things you always want to do
I can feel your prescence, your prescence in the night
Just tell me why, give me a reason, gimme, gimme, just give me a reason

Oh yellow beat devil man
No mercy's rolling in your head
Just tell me what you thinking of
I like to know, it turns me on

Devil man
