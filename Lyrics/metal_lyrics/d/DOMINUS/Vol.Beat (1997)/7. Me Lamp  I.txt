I saw the dancing clown in your eye
I don't know what you feel deep in side
Yuo scream and shout and howl at my walls
I say the demon doll turns you on

Just lay down, my friend
I got something to tell
The kind of things you see
Is not real in the end

The night is still on your mind
It's creeping down your spine
You have to face this fear
In this dream-state of mine

The paranoia goes on
Until you drop on the floor
Welcome to my world
My best friend of all
