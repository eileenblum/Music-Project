"Well, I really doubt that it's in the Lord's 'top ten'; rock and roll is the Devil's music!
That's right, that's right..
Rock and roll is rhythm, a feeling...
A feeling that emenates from the pit of Hell!"

I'm your sweet curse
The one to reverse you
Don't turn it back
It just don't work on me
The demon I hide
Will join you tonight
Your world is closed

You can do what you want to
But he'll tear you to pieces
No matter how many tears you whine
This is revenge for my weak days

You talk, you talk talk about seven
Deadly sins from heaven
And yes, I'm proud, I'm proud to do them all
The scars on my flesh
No more bring you pleasure
Your world is closed

You talk, you talk talk about seven
Deadly sins from heaven
And yes, I'm proud, I'm proud to do them all
The scars on my flesh
No more bring you pleasure
Your world is closed

You can do what you want to
But he'll tear you to pieces
No matter how many tears you whine
This is revenge for my weak days
