The moonlight, my eyes
The winter cold inside my heart
My horns now throw a shadow in the mist

The winter
Chains of swords
(Of) big warriors
In battle storms

My sword now glitter here
On the mountainside of a lake

This euphoria from the winter to the sea
Of the blade that now remain at it's place

The moonlight, my eyes
The winter cold inside my heart
My horns now throw a shadow in the mist

The winter
Chains of swords
(Of) big warriors
In battle storms

My sword now glitter here
On the mountainside of a lake

This euphoria from the winter to the sea
Of the blade that now remain at it's place
As I turn to frost and lay down on the glass
The blade in tales now still remain in it's place

I feel my winter coffin
As I lay in frost
The darkness becomes me
As I now melt in sleep
