Let me be your god in the sea of frost and cold
I'm buried by the florid song of the whales
In a ship from northeast
Come and take my kingdom of gold
As I now pass away and be the air
For an eagle and it's view
I cross it's hails in night so cold

(It) echoes now through the euxine
To bring the mistress of the forth coming sea
The gloomy blink of her morning in spring
Makes the shore so dim

I now bring the rain for the forest
To delight my path of dim
To become the darkest pest
For the weak light of christ

I'll be the air for an eagle and its view
I cross it's hails in the night so cold
The echoes howl through the euxine
To bring the mistress of the sea
The gloomy blink she bring

The florid song of whales
Do now breathe in me
Still I am the gloomy dim so delight my hell

Echoes now through the euxine
To bring the mistress of the forth coming sea
The gloomy blink of her morning in spring
