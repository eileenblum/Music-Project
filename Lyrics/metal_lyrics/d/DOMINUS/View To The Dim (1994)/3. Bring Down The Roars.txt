Here I bring my gloomy dim
To the forest of eclipse
I envoke thus the blackening cowls
Out in the woods all alone

While all was at night with all
They approach the nordic sea at dawn

To see the deep black ocean waves in storm
Now take farewell and set your sails as we flow

We enter this sea with swords in our hands
To fight the battle with 9 days of ale, gods and virgin blood

Here I bring my gloomy dim
To the forest of eclipse
I envoke thus the blackening cowls
Out in the woods all alone

Bring down the roars!

And those who might hear our roars
Upon the north-star of gold
Night carry on our horns
