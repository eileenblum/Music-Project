Behind the tears of black
I see my queen in red
Her river runs in tales
Her water breathe in me

Time pass by blinded eyes
Her candle's shade now guide
Beyond the water cold
A path of glass in snow

Now presenting a new dark age
My tears of black runs in tales

A grave of tears in ice
Icecold tear-drops are mine
From past around my dreams
She rest now in my wings

Beyond the frost, I now see her
Red shining light surrounds the river
Beyond the frost, I now see her
Red shining light surrounds the river now

Beyond the tears of black
I see my queen dead
Her river runs my tales
Her shining glitter me
