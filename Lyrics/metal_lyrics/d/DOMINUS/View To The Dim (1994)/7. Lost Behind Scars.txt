Lost is what my eyes now bear on
To judge now there's no god
Who can change the life to the good
There is just you

We feed the eyes
With the scars of light and lies
I see nothing in the end
Black cold wings of steel I bear
Lost... is this the angels of my past

I know the angel dust
Behind the scars there is a life
But that I give a fuck

There's no god
Who can change your life to the good
There is just you

Is this the gathering of my death
Leave me with my cold wings of steel
In the nordic air
