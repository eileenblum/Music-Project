Kneeling in dark and oldest grave
Oh mighty father, I never really saw your dead
What you left behind to me
Is standing on the darkside
Of your gravestone (there stands)
Find the old man in the mountain

I'm now sending my voice
To the world's four corners
To the ground, to the air
To all living black
Your spirit lives here
Mighty father

I never really saw your dead
But I know you are out there somewhere

Now mighty father, give me a sign
So I can find the old man in the mountain
A divine vision in deity falls
Covert in black fog
The guidance to the old god

The divine old god
Standing so high

Grossing the river of dead
There is no return
Cannot avoid the eyes
The way up to old man up high

Welcome my son of black
Enter the circle with no beginning and no end
Find your own mountain
Where there is no future and no past

Amon, god of life
Mictian, Aztek death god
Toth, god for magic
I'm your souls
Amon
Mictian
Toth
I'm your souls

I'm now sending my voice
To the world's four corners
To the ground, to the air
To all living black
Your spirit lives here
Mighty father
