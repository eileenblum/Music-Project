The lightning rain came so fast
And teared our sails out to the shores of ebony
Now awakening by the howling wolf in frost
And two staring eyes from the raven

I wonder why
The northern wind
Spoke out my name
As I stroll away

Now standing here
Where words only is a sound in the cold
And strength is a victory for the horned one
I know Fenriz will guide our way

Outside in the distance a horse in iron and steel
Who carried us to the kingdom
Where Odin's figure skimmed

The lightning rain came so fast
And teared our sails out to the shores of ebony
Now awakening by the howling wolf in frost
And two staring eyes from the raven
