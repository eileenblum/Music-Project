A taste of tears in horror colour
Now blind I search the sand
My growing voice now become
Sorrow of life they say

Colour of death
Blind I search the sand

Day filled with dark of endless search
Of something I don't know
The wind now guide me to the place
Sorrow of life they say

Colour of death
Blind I search the sand

The grief in my head now form a maze
Of voices who cry all in pain

A taste of tears in horror colour
Now blind I search the sand
My growing voice now become
Sorrow of life they say

Colour of death
Blind I search the sand

Day filled with dark of endless search
Of something I don't know
The wind now guide me to the place
Sorrow of life they say

Colour of death
Blind I search the sand

The grief in my head now form a maze
Of voices who cry all in pain

Deep in the dark sorrow scars
I dwell my colour life
Possessed by a vision of twilight
A journey through a colour world
In endless search
But still in fear I laugh groundless

Sidereal path, leave me to a lake of sand
Sinking into a never seen colour land
Confusion fears my mind
My soul appear
