Right or wrong
It's not a question to be right
It's how you do and cope your life

Fall for no fees
Kiss no arses to be loved
Unless your fucking fist is up

I could look up to Satan
Be the foe of Jesus Christ
But why
They are both my fans
So why
Hail nobody, let thy body be thy god
But please keep both feet on the ground

Skip into the life that you live
Fuck the hippies who called life a gift
My soul and pride stands high hell
Rather grow the horns from a goat
That being part of something you are not
I stand by my word, so burn

Don't, I say, don't wait for silence to be heard
Life is too short without a word
Fall for no feeds
Kiss no arses to be loved
Unless your fucking fist is up

Skip into the life that you live
Fuck the hippies who called life a gift
My soul and pride stands high hell
Rather grow the horns from a goat
That being part of something you are not
I stood by my word

Skip into the life that you live
Fuck the hippies who called life a gift
My soul and pride stands high hell
Rather grow, rather grow the horns from a goat
I stand by my word

Skip into the life that you live
Fuck the hippies who called life a gift
My soul and pride stands high hell
Rather grow, rather grow the horns from a goat
I stood by my word
