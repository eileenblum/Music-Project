Scan into the bones
Wicked flesh in need to tame its sorrow chip
Before all human emotions turn to nothing
The act of organic plastic is taking in to subvert the human flesh
To a numb product of evil itself

So burn me, replace me to plastic pain
So burn me, replace me to plastic pain

Mumbling high in code
Who am I talking to?
They say I'm wasting pain
A design for life is in sight

Programmed to defend
The arrival of code them
Hightech devil thrill
Is in countdown to present a darker age

So burn me, replace me to plastic pain
So burn me, replace me to plastic pain

A lifeform so abusive
In progression with effects to make
Excistance to a script
Their mastery in hightech take its form
Your mind is not your own
That's what your chip had told
You present a secret face
To cover up your hails for better days

So burn me, replace me to plastic pain
So burn me, replace me to plastic pain
