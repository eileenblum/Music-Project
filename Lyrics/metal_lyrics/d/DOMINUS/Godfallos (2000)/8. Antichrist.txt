I represent all the sins on this earth
I challenge the pity wisdom of God
I'm the flesh religion of joy
Join me if you dare

Look into my eyes and you'll see
A stare that can kill Jehova
Oh yeah, no lie shall be true for me

I'm the fallos that fucks Jesus' ass
Save your tears, you're under my command
I'm my own redeemer from hell
Join me if you dare

Blessed be those who think for themself
Waste no love on unknown faces
Be your own redeemer from hell
Join me if you can

I'm the nails in Jesus' hands
I am the anti, anti
I'm the cross, who suck his blodd
I am the anti, anti, anti, anti, anti, anti, anti, anti,
Antichrist
