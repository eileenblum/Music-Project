Born on a field, sucking blood from my enemies
Hear their cries for their mammy when I fuck them
The shining blade now tear their flesh apart
While Satan play his dick, laughing, beg for more

Born with a battle face
Bloodstains on my hand
I raise up the ironfist
For your mastery

Through a hall I carried 9 victims
I thought this story was over but no, no
The wellknown demon from the chapter of 10
Had caught me in a dream and another tale

Born with a battle face
Bloodstains on my hand
I raise up the ironfist
For your mastery

Woke me up as a light, cold sweat dripping
Can not find a clue, am I dreaming
Tried to walk my legs to the mirror
Voices in my head keep screaming

Born with a battle face
Bloodstains on my hand
I raise up the ironfist
For your mastery

Born with a battle face
Bloodstains on my hand
I raise up the ironfist
For your mastery
