Hello, angel's of a god
I can watch you from my window
See how you nurse the light
I can make it go away
Unresistable are we from the side of others
Where the flesh in need now paint our masterpiece

Noone creates my kind
I am beginning before birth
I was the thorn in Jesus' face with no remorse
Oh yes, I do behold my second life on earth
I was brought to from the eggs of Abaddon

I, I fertilize
God, God's angels in the night
I, I fertilize
God, God's angels in the night

So you angels of the light
I'll catch you with my claws
I am in route to fuck the pity out of you
The one with resistance I prefer to fertilize
To make the unborn master proud with a smile

I, I fertilize
God, God's angels in the night
I, I fertilize
God, God's angels in the night

Oh little angel, I see you, you're bleeding hard
'Cause of the life that grows inside you
You'll break in two when the horns will show
Your destiny was fucking made

Now the time is up, my mission is fulfilled
The birth of Abaddon will terrorize the weak
Beware angels of the light, I tell you he's in route
To firtalize your body with an army or two

Seed from the Beast

I, I fertilize
God, God's angels in the night
I, I fertilize
God, God's angels in the night
