Voodoo me, curse me, haunt me, fuck me
Scratch your name with poison claws tonight
Do your rhyme, nightmare time, blackened sky, bewitch me
Still I fear no creature of your kind

Never have I seen your eyes or face
So no respect for you, you dirty bitch

Speak my tongue, walk my legs, beat up my heart
You're eager to possess me goes too far
Mambo painter, symbols on the ground
We've powder pictures to attract

Never have I seen your eyes or face
So no respect for you, you dirty bitch

This game goes years back and now you return
Face me black witch
You took a piece of my soul
To create the perfect beast

Bosou koblamin gidigidi
No loa, am I to invoke your dreams
Diabolo (Boson) Ago-si Ago-la
Still you think I'm loa with the fucking hat

Never have I seen your eyes or face
So no respect for you, you dirty bitch

This game goes years back and now you return
Face me black witch
You took a piece of my soul
To create the perfect beast

In 1798 I promised you evilness
I gave you half of my soul for the fucking beast
The remnant of my soul, you'll never get, I'll behold
The face that wouldn't show

Never have I seen your eyes or face
So no respect for you, you dirty bitch

This game goes years back and now you return
Face me black witch
You took a piece of my soul
To create the perfect beast
