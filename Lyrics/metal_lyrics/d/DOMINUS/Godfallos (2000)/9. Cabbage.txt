Burn your christ inside
You'll never see the light
Your brainwashed eyes behold
The things you thought you saw

For a moment I reached inside
I could tell your life's a prayer
For a moment I reached inside
I could tell you were afraid

But your mind is gone for nothing
Inside your head is turning to a cabbage

Faith is just a curse
Unless it's build on trust
But how to trust a ï¿½manï¿½
Who never show his face

For a moment I reached inside
I could tell your life's a prayer
For a moment I reached inside
I could tell you were afraid

But your mind is gone for nothing
Inside your head is turning to a cabbage
Your mind is gone for nothing
Inside your head is turning to a cabbage

The holy cross is made
To those without a string
Like the puppets without a soul
You're an easy target to pull

For a moment I reached inside
I could tell your life's a prayer
For a moment I reached inside
I could tell you were afraid

But your mind is gone for nothing
Inside your head is turning to a cabbage
Your mind is gone for nothing
Inside your head is turning to a cabbage

Turning to a cabbage
Turning to a cabbage
Turning to a cabbage
Turning to a cabbage
Turning to a cabbage
