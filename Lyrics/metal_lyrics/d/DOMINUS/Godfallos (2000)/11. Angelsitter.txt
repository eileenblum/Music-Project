Oh little angel I see you, climbing down from the heaven, horny as hell
I thought you got your portions of cock with my horned brothers loading
I'm gonna do what your master (god) aren't capable of, I'm gonna satisfy your pussy like a crazy
Give god my regards and tell that his angels' flesh are sweet

Roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the doxy
Roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the doxy

No one is safe here
Unless you're horny
Flesh conspiracy

Oh little angel, I see you taking place at my table, horny as hell
Now feel satans cock while he pump you to one of his horned bitches
Do what I tell you to, you gonna be my little queen of hell like a mam
Yeah, give god my regards and tell him that his angels are filled with seed

Roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the doxy
Roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the doxy

No one is safe here
Unless you're horny
Flesh conspiracy

No one is safe here
Unless you're horny
Flesh conspiracy

Now to put an end to this romantic glamour, listen pretty angel
From now on to forever you will wear my mark, 6-6-6
Do what I tell you to, you gonna satisfy my flesh, and do it like a maid
Now that you wear my fruit, the chosen one will be born in fire

Roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the doxy
Roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the dox, roll the doxy

No one is safe here
Unless you're horny
Flesh conspiracy
