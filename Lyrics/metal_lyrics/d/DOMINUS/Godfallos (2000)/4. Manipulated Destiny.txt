You are a walking circus without a hold
What once was soul is now an empty shell without a heart
No scars of blistering pain from independent fights
Low kind of appetite for life

I'll keep on hating your design of life, your trendy ways through time
You are just a pity product of the so-called smart arse mind
Every green will fucking die in you before I'll count to 2
Let me bleed, that's what I need, for you it's far too late

Keep your fucking hands from me
Watch me as I bleed
Can you hear my cry for chaos

Your tears fall like acid rain, you're a breathing battery
Material that's what you are, but that wouldn't bring you far
Seek into yourself and cry, you're made of flesh as I
But you a lie, mirrorblind, wake up as you die

Keep your fucking hands from me
Watch me as I bleed
Can you hear my cry for chaos

You are a walking circus without a hold
What once was soul is now an empty shell without a heart
No scars of blistering pain from independent fights
Low kind of appetite for life

Their system will survive in you, your brainless eyes behold
Synchronizing pictures of the stuff you think you love
Apathy, that's what you are, the golden spoon will fall
From your ass, be a man, feel now if you can

Keep your fucking hands from me
Watch me as I bleed
Can you hear my cry for chaos
