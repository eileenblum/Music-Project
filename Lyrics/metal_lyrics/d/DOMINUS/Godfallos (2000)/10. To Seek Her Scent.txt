I throw my skin like a snake for thee
Oh godless beauty of the fourth coming sea
I have heard your calls and I would like to be
A flying eagle across your sea

My scream fills the air to seek your scent
My wings cast shadows over land
Reflections from your water blind my eyes
You sure leave your mark, you're mine to find

Upon the years I have walked the earth
I though I was insane, but now I know
Your vibes through nature, the beat of your heart
Have turned my instincts upside down

My scream fills the air to seek your scent
My wings cast shadows over land
Reflections from your water blind my eyes
You sure leave your mark, you're mine to find

My scream fills the air to seek your scent
My wings cast shadows over land
Reflections from your water blind my eyes
You sure leave your mark, you're mine to find

I saw you at the shore in red shining light
Drained for power, but now you are mine
It is sad with destiny when it ends
But now you rest in peace in my wings

My screams fills the air to vopice your death
My sorrow casts a shadow over land
Reflections from your water blind my eyes
You still leave your mark, you're mine for life
