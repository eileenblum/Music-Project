[CHAPTER EIGHT]

Beauty, beast or what you are
Born we are from the Horned One
Second palace here we come
With the eyes of the Emperor

2 wargods were gathered at the entrance
Prepare for no forgiveness

One I stapped with thorns from the Queen In Red
The second one was ripped apart
With help from Wolf's claws
A sacrifice was made to the First 9
Only 2 victims left
To feed the 9 from death

Beauty, beast or what you are
Born we are by the Horned One
Second palace here we come
With the eyes of the Emperor
