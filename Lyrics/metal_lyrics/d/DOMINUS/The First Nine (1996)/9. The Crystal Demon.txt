[CHAPTER TWO]

Help me crystal ball
I am he who inherit the force
The force to see me victims of fear
I believe my intention will now do

[The Crystal Demon]
Right at your side you have this ancient sword
Use it well and beware
Beware of fallacious men who
Think they walk among immortal gods
Kill them with your sword and say
You don't bring me down
You will be victim 9
You know the story too
So get on your knees and pray
From now on I'm your god

See what you serve is magic of a kind
Through your dreams you gave us birth
You gave us birth but only just for a while
Free us from the spell of 9

Confront the Burning Maid
And her Ancient Wolf
Slap her down to the ground in May
The Wolf will guide, the victim's hide
One part of our birth in rhyme

Confront the Burning Maid
