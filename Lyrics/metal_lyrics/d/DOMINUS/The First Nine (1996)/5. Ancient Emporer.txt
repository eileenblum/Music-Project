[CHAPTER SEVEN]

Evolution was teasing my soul
Me and the wolf were climbing on clouds above
All of our victims did try to believe
That they were something
But they were just part of a dream

One Silver Angel stretch her arms out for us

[The Angel]
Welcome to the five endless Kingdoms Of Above
Each place in the Palace will give you a life
It's time to meet the Maker of your past dreams in life

[The Maker]
Where have you been
Where you sent me
[The Maker]
Are you real
Like life itself
[The Maker]
The Emperor's eyes you want
Are still left to see
Cool

[The Maker]
Where have you been
Where you sent me
[The Maker]
Are you real
Like life itself
[The Maker]
The Emperor's eyes you want
Are still left to see
Cool

At the end of the palace
The Emperor stood with giving eyes
His body was old, as it was shaking out of time
But his eyes he held in his hands
Were sharp and strong
Like they could kill any mortal man

[The Emperor]
I know you are searching for life
A life to give to demons in another time
Take mine, while it still breathes
You see, we ancient emperors never sleep

[The Maker]
Where have you been
Where you sent me
[The Maker]
Are you real
Like life itself
[The Maker]
The Emperor's eyes you want
Are still left to see
Cool
