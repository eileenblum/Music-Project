[CHAPTER ONE]

By the end of the hall they creep
Just waiting to confront me
All these years I have believed what I have seen

Oh what they do I do not know
Time will pass or time will show
In this dead-white hall I'm passing cold

I walk the end of 9

White turns to black, I walk the end of 9
To confront by the end
Skin turns to blue, I walk the end of 9
Lurk, lurk, lurking they are

Eminent how they walk in silence
Is this the answer for my death
Slowly moving pictures grow within me
Is this the journey to my hell

Now I'm passing the first 9 demons
Ariez sign I grant you birth
Somehow I think it has a meaning
Their eyes are looking for answers

Eminent how I walk these halls

By the end of the hall they creep
Just waiting to confront me
All these years I have believed what I have seen

Oh what they do I do not know
Time will pass or time will show
In this dead-white hall I'm passing cold

Now confronting the book of 9
Victims is another time
A crystal ball with stories in rhymes
