[CHAPTER THREE]

I wear now her ashes as a chain
With 9 words of a spell
I wear now her ashes

In these woods alone
I went out to meet the Burning Maid
I went alone
But soon to guide a wolf will take its place

I wear now her ashes in this chain
With 9 words of a spell
I wear now her ashes

As I walked
The Burning Maid came out from the dark
Her eyes were sharp
As I slabbed her down to the ground

[The Burning Maid]
Oh my soul has finally come to an end
Use the 9 words in your chain

I wear now her ashes in this chain
