[CHAPTER NINE]

Through my final journey
A woman stood in glade
In her hands she's holding an hourglass with
Sand I held from the Burning Maid

[The Woman In Glade]
Now glitter her ashes
Through your fingers
And let it fall into the glass
You got 9 minutes to do a kill
In the Final Palace

Thousand men have been killed
By the eyes I now will see
This royal shape of a man
Made me feel the presence of one night with the beast

[The Royal Shape]
Take place and listen up
You simply have to look me in the eyes
Without no glint of fear at all

If you do that, this heart in my hand
Will stop beating, and a life will fulfill the First 9
The First 9 demon-seed

As he looked me in the eyes
He saw the emperor-look
He fell to the ground
With a burning 9 around his eyes
Around his eyes

Through my final journey
A woman stood in glade
In her hands she's holding an hourglass with
Sand I held from the Burning Maid

[The Woman In Glade]
Now glitter her ashes
Through your fingers
And let it fall into the glass
You got 9 minutes to do a kill
In the Final Palace
