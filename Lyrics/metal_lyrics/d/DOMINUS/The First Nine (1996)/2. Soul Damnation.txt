[CHAPTER FIVE]

Survival was my only friend
To give life a chance was bigger than ever
So I went with fate

A gate of frozen tears in thorns
Marks the path to my sorrow
A soul-damnation created by witchcraft songs

[The Crystal Demon]
Do not let your eye betray
Cause what you will find is full of magic
Of a kind

What I saw in that grave
Was the most beautiful Dancing Queen
Like the day with tears in black
She was all dressed in red

Survival was my only friend
To give life a chance was bigger than ever
So I went with fate

A gate of frozen tears in thorns
Marks the path to my sorrow
A soul-damnation created by witchcraft songs
