[CHAPTER SIX]

[The Queen In Red]
Eminent Son, I am the only one
Who can clean your throughts
Please suck blood from flowers
That I have thorned
My passion for love is near

But as I sucked
My world didn't come out clear
And the Queen In Red disappeared

I was bewitched by her songs
Songs of souls of old sorrow
The loss of a queen whose life was
Sucked out of a flower
Made the soul tears flow forever

In silence we walked out from the grave
To cross 5 new teardrops from
Creatures, beauties or what to become

I was bewitched by her songs
Songs of souls of old sorrow
The loss of a queen whose life was
Sucked out of a flower
Made the soul tears flow forever

[The Queen In Red]
Eminent Son, I am the only one
Who can clean your throughts
Please suck blood from flowers
That I have thorned
My passion for love is near
