[CHAPTER FOUR]

The dawn was soon to come
Her ashes kept me warm
From the howling windblows
8 victims left
To feed the 9 from death
Oh what a connexion

What about the wolf
Suspicious is its look
Like eyes in enemies
The chain around my neck
Was deadly for the next
Living obliging

As I strolled on these empty ways of dreams
Came 2 men and talked like they were kings
Without a single delay
I choked them in my chain

As I strolled on these empty ways of dreams
Came 2 men and talked like they were kings
Without a single delay
I choked them in my chain
What about the wolf
I said, what about the wolf

The dawn was soon to come
Her ashes kept me warm
From the howling windblows
6 victims left
To feed the 9 from death
Oh what a connexion
