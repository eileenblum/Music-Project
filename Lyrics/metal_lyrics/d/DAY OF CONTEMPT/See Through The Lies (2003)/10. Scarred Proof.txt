The army of darkness
Blackened corpse, continuous source
Victims of lost hope, lost will
Flame burned low through fault of mine
Strength left to clutch at the flames
Ive seen the depths of darkness
But there are those whod die before fall
Sooner claimed by blood than evil
By cold steel before your apathetic ways
I have seen the suffering
Scarred proof of battles lost and won
Society struggles on, through race, sex and specieism
Oppresion will divide the weak, unite the strong
The only victims are those who
Who give in.
