Any way you turn, you cannot escape
Your mind will be smashed into shape
The poison that is normality is everywhere
But I wont take the bait
You blink an eye, you cease to resist
A second's lapse is all that it takes
But my blood's seething with the antiserum
And I know that its hate
One by one, you fall from grace
One by one, you cant look me in the face
You gasp, you grasp to the sides as youre falling in
