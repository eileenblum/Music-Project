Hatred boils over into
Scald your face, in rage consumed
And it just feeds me
Decayed from the inside
Decayed from the inside
Flesh burnt face, what a waste
But its all that I know
Tried to let your actions slide
But the hatred shows
Every move shows the truth
I see you try to survive
Because all that burns in me
Is my one reason for life
Its coming down to this
I have nothing left
All the rage, Ive kept, I have nothing left
Its all that I have left, and it just feeds me
