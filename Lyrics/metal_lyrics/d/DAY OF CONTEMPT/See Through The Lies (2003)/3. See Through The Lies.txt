This world a fucking lie
Your life contained by their plan
creating all you see
You worship a fools gold
Live blind, I can see through the lies
Your goals implanted in your mind
Obey and fulfill their dreams
Its always just out of reach
hands tied, I can see through the lies
The life that I despise is all you have
its not enough for me
Content to die for nothing
theres more that I see
I can see through the lies
Ive come too far and I wont turn back
to accept this, to deny it
You live blind, but I can see through the lies
