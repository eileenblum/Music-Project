Pain all I feel, nothing remains
Wound will not heal, ever again
Never again
All my life Ive been decieved, never again
Ive buried hope with defeat, nothing remains
Ive been blinded by this life
See nothing but black
I wont forfeit the chance to bring it back
Ill stand up for what I believe
For every second I breathe
I have been doomed by fate
but theres another way
Ive been decieved all my life
I wont turn away, I refuse
I wont accept fate, I refuse to give in
