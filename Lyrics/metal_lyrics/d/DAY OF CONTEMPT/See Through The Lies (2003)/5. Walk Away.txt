Youve had control for too long, but Ill retake my own
And with your coffin nailed a final proof of your goal failed
You walk away from your mistake
Fuck your life, hate is coming down
You wont walk away
(freefall into the unknown)
From your last mistake
(burns right before me)
Without a shadow of doubt
Youre set to fall
Without a shadow of doubt
Weve got to take them out
