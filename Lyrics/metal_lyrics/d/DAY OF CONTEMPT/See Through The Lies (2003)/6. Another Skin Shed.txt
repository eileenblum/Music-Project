As ire is spawned, vengence is sworn
Another body bled, another dead skin shed
For granted it shall be taken
Our capacity to interact
A perfect expectation
Defiled by observed fact
A shrouded barrier
Too inherent for the mind to percieve
Emotions ensure that
the long term hopes are bereaved
Affirm your belief, hopes are bereaved
Another body bled, another dead skin shed
Are we striving for
An unattainable goal
Countless years of exertion
And what have we got to show
Others wrongs internally blamed
Our own externally caused
Our minds too feeble to
Change and reap the rewards
Hopes are bereaved
Another body bled, another dead skin shed
