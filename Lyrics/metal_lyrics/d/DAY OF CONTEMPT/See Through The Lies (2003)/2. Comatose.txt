Your watching eyes aint new to me
Nor your words of deceit
Since day one I had you down
Ready to dispose a mind
Comatose
Torn to shreds
Clutching to all that makes
Makes you a man
Shallow layer fabricated, still you pretend
Head held too high to see the ground, its fucking close
Today its coming around, to you
Comatose
Your lies uncovered for all to see
Youre still pleading, no one believes
This day youre unmasked
This day youre fucking last
Torn to shreds
