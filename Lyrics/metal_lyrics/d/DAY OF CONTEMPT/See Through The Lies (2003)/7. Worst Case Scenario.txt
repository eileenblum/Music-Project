Life lead in constraints til death
A billion more cant see the chains
My whole life, I have been provoked
Retaliate, alter fate, you choke
You choke. Fucking choke
Ive swallowed enough now its time
Too see the tables turned
Im coughing up blood thats not mine
And Ill see it returned
The pain that always comes my way
I think of you just the same
All the things I despise are the things you prescribe
Still I hide them all away. Hide them away
I will overcome, Ive promised myself
That I will see it done
With open eyes Ive become
The one thing you cant take.
