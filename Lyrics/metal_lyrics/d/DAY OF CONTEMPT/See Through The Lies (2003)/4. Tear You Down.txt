Whatever it takes to tear you down
You cant bring yourself
To look your face in the mirror
You cant bring yourself
Just to look at your face
Whatever it takes to tear you down
You scapegoat your victims
To escape the blame
You clean your hands too
With their tears
It dont mean shit to you
You take the easy way out
Too many lies to explain
Because I know the truth
And all their tears
It dont mean shit to you
How long will I wait for things to go my way
How long does it take til everything turns real
My passive days are through
Ill tear the floor from under you
For those you cheated Ill do
Whatever it takes to tear you down
