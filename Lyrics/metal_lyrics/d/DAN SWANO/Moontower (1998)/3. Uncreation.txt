A tale forgotten long ago brought to life again
Ancient wisdom ancient lies
Horrid lullabies for the earth
Time will turn my prophecies into reality and it will lead the world astray
Death found the remedy for its enemy
Ifs too late the seize the day
Time and my malicious spells live In harmony
They await the hour set
Rapture of all that Is alive
The reaper will arrive to invert the hour glass
Oh uncreation
The evolution in reverse
Oh uncreation
The death of universe
His reflections on the end still unknown to man
Dark predictions dark cliches in this recital of doom
The world is aging backwards
The young remains the young
We all know tomorrow will be yesterday reborn
The time and space deserted will hold no life for man
We face these final hours to be buried in the past
Something Is wrong with the sky tonight
The clouds are darker than ever before
There is unrest in the stars alight
As if they warned me for the distant roar
The sun is descending
Nevermore to shine
Light is lost forever
We are the last in line
