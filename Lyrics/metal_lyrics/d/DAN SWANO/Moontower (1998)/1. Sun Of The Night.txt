Shadowscapes form a web a cross the sky and steal the light that runs the engine of my heart
Decieved by clouds but I know it will soon return to watch my every move like an eye in the sky
Lunartic
Obsessed I am indeed
I will gain no strength this moonless night
Heavens heart or just a long forgotten stone
All Me lost or is yet to come
The stars will be alone in the (firmament tonight
Shadows grow stronger across the sky
The sun prepares for battle
The night is soon to die
Vicious beams will soon obscure the presence of the sun of the night
My soul dispise the dawning and the light that it will bring
Doomed to be nocturnal
A creature of the night
Another dawn dilutes the dark the void where I can live
The rays of light bum Ã²Ã³ skin and ravage my desire
I close my eyes and I await the vengeance soon to come
When the dusk will bring the unlight and heal me once again
I have to return to my tower before the twilight will drain me of life
Tomorrow I need to be caressed by the moonlit sky or my soul will be carried away by the light
Just like the sun of the night
The moon is mine
Oh how I long to be one with the sun of the night
Oh how I long to unite with the sun of mine
