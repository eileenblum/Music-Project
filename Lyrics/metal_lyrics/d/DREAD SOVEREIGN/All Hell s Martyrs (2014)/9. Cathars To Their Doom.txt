As I see it's by the grace of God
It falls to the sting thatâ¦
And they will pray in vain
As gold breaks on

And God will turn His back
We leave the cathars to their doom
And the gods in church
Are gone with no answer

They'll march to their doom
At the church ofâ¦
You feel the Devil's fire

You feel the Devil's fire

Cathars to their doom 
And the gods in church
And your God will not answer
666
Cathars to the fire

666
Cathars to their doom 
And the gods in church
And your God will not answer
666
Cathars to the fire

666
Cathars to their doom 
And the gods in church
And your God will not answer
666
Cathars to the fire
