This is the spear that pierced the side of Christ
Anointed in pain between two thieves

Is this the son of the living God
Who I betrayed with a kiss
Another Messiah
Bled like a pig

I am the apostle in triumph
Who ate your children
In the valley of Moloch we lie
A black god is on the throne
In the valley of the Sinai a black god sits

A black god is on the throne
Testament of faith
To the will of Satan

The dog of Yeshua
Cursed servant of Pilate
Bled on Golgothas mount
Like no other
Submit to the will of Satan
Praise hail Satan
