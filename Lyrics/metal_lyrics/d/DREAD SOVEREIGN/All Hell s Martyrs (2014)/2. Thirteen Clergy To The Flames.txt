Holy Mary the Devil is coming
The clergy they number thirteen
Trembling naked in the courtyard
In the city of Orleans

Burn burn they burn at the stake
Thirteen clergy to the fire

Dreadful fog over hallowed ground
As the condemned await their fate
Diocletian's shadow cast upon them
And they will burn at the stake

Burn burn burn at the stake
Thirteen clergy to the fire

They will burn burn burn at the stake
Thirteen clergy to the fire

Our blood is shed on these ropes
No reprise from King Robert
Their charred remains in 1022
Were scattered in the winter wind

Burn burn burn at the stake
Thirteen clergy to the fire

They will burn burn burn at the stake
Thirteen clergy to the fire
