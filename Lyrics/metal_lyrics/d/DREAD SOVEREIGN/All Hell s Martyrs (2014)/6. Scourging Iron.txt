I feel all the breath of unholy pyres
I fuss and less scourging iron
And I shout wicked whips
At the dawn, come all these deals

Fly out in the name of God
Let arms down - name of Satan
We are the council of Vatican
You will confess!

Terror, oh, I won't confess
Do your worst!
I shall not, I shall not bleed
I do not yield to any man
So do your damnest, do your worst
The will of Satan is mine
And I will not confess
Never! Never!
