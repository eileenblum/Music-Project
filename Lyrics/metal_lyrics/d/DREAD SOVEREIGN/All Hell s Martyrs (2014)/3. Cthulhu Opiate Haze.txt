A name is holy, behold thee
Between sleep and dream
In love, in the corridor
On my mind

A noted beast
Who's pride runs in my vein
Last of our supper, the feast
That note the foul

Of those who end
With knot
Pray, drapes clash
At morning comes

(There is no daemon, there is no game)
(You want to play? There is no daemon)

And this is the need of
Night takes me high
Cthulhu on fire
It was always wither
Missfenopian scraping
Surfing through my veins
