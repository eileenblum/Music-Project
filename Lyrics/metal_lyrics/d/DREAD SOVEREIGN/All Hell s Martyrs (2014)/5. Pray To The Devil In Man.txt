This is the left hand of God
That smites the children of Cain
Blasphemy that purges the flesh
We flagellate in the Lords frenzy

We pray we pray to the Devil in man
We pray we pray Lucifer son of light

We carve living words
That are as stone
Mine is the seed in woman
And fire in the loins of man

We are the fire in the loins of man
That pierces the womb of Heaven
The whore of Magadelene
Looks upon us with the Devils lust
So carry me to the chamber of flesh
And cry out for God is shamed
