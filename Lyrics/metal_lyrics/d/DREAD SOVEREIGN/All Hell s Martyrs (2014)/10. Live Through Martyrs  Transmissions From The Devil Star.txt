I woke from a dreadful sleep
His hands upon my throat
A breathless evil haunts me
And threw a small hour
He spans in the night
At the full darkness dead
He is holding His Santa Claus skin
And starring into my soul
He stares into my soul

Our hearts never knew what faith conjured
We life out through martyrs and die for life

What good can crawl from Nazareth?
A land of not-to-speak
But Father awaits His faith
And what is your God world?
And we shall flee and crucify
And wear his skin in mockery
And yet we stare into hearts
That dreams are of martyr men
