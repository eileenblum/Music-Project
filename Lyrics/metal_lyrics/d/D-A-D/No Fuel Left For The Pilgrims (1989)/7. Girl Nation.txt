I had a ticket to fly so I boarded a plane
When a combat dressed stewardesse shouted my name
I'm wanted alive yeah! I'm in for a trial
It's minimum mercy coz they found my file
Hijacked, kidnapped, trailed and trapped
They fly me in I'm gonna for all of my sins â now it begins
Yeah! I've a found place where girls eat men
Now I'm back in girl nation again
Girl nation Female civilization
Girl nation Female civilization

It's a female tale it's hard to use words
But I'm landed and stranded among oysters and birds
Bush and dangerous curves boys get what they deserves
Wild sisters dancing all night Round that totem
With a knife to my throat Round that totem
Yeah! They're chanting the oath
Singing 'bout mama all through the night round that totem of the red light
In girl nation Female civilization
Girl nation Female civilization
In girl nation by interstellar navigation
And sweet female persuasion
Globetrotting to ladyland Back where time began

One wild second then I was down
One full circle they stood all around
Counting my bones waiting to be dead
When a soft loving hand lifted my head
Tender lips kissing my chin, whispering:
- Honey, where have you been?
In girl nation Totem of the red light
Female civilization
In girl nation Totem of the red light
It's a female civilization Girl nation
Totem of the red light
By interstellar navigation and sweet female persuasion
Globetrotting through ladyland â back where time began
In girl nation ...
