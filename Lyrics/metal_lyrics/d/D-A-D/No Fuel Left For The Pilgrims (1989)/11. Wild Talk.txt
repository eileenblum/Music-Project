You've got a big red tongue
'Coz you've been talking too long
I wouldn't get it back if I lended you an ear
Syllables and sounds is all I hear
So please read my hips and get a hold on your lips
Can't ask you to stop it ain't no use
It's a verbal mess when your tongue is loose
'Coz R mouth is racing while your mind is standing still
Yeah! All that wild talk It's making me ill...
Wild talk Told you that I had enough
But you just babble along the lines
It's wild tlk Wild tlk Thought I'd never get enough
But you just babble along the lines Wild tlk

Yeah! But I have to believe
You'll use your eyes to see
- That I'd might like you better if we slept together
'Coz why discuss all night? - When there's room for a fight
You just linger on You're talking me down
It's a waste of words when I'm around
Yeah! But your tape is rolling while your brain is on stand-by
All that wild tlk It must be making you high
Ahh! Too high!!
Wild tlk Told you that I had enough
But you just babble along the lines
Wild tlk - Wild talking misses
Wild tlk - Could I get through with some kisses?
Told you that I had enough, but you just babble along the lines
It's wild tlk wild wild tlk...
Yeah! But your tape is rolling while your brain is on stand-by
All that wild tlk It must be making you high
Wild tlk Told you that I had enough
But you just babble along the lines Yeah! It's wild tlk
