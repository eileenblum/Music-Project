From the steamin Mekong delta
To the shores of Tonkin bay
Bombs of yellied gasoline
Is making night as bright as day
And the mogul's hard tank masters
Adore their new grenades
And the D.A.D. find their 9" shells
Are great for border raids

Yeah! I'm superfurious
I've done it again
I reach 50 when I count to 10
Jihad, I'm getting mad
And there's no fuel left
For the pilgrims
Jihad, I'm getting mad
And there's no fuel left
For the pilgrims

And you can shake your fist at the T.V. set
And you can slam your hand in the table
And you can cry and curse
Through tightlocked teeth
Just as hard as you are able
But you can't run away from trouble
'Coz there ain't no place that far
No fuel left for the pilgrims
Yeah! That's just the way we are

'Coz I'm superfurious I've done it again
I reach 50 when I count to 10
Jihad, I'm getting mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrims
Jihad, I'm getting mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrims

This is tower again, do you read me? You can get the girls and the videomachine but the fuel you asked for... You cannot have!

What?! Blow me to heaven!!
Jihad I'm getting so mad I'm getting so mad
..Who's mad I'm mad, so mad
Jihad I'm getting mad
And there's no fuel left for the pilgrims.
