Say if you see a vicious lightning on the nighttime sky
There's no use checkin' the starmap or aski daddy why
And if you get me on the wire I'll give you this reply:
See I'm comin' higher'n'higher over chimneypot'n'spire
ZCMI Yeah! I'm that high flyin' guy
ZCMI And when the moon sails by
ZCMI I smile and wave goodbye
ZCMI

Beyond the end of space to the future and back
In search of solid ground to plant our flag
Yeah! We planned to build a base but the sky was too black
See I'm comin' higher'n'higher over chimneypot'n'spire
ZCMI Yeah! I'm that high flyin' guy
ZCMI And when the moon sails by
ZCMI I smile and wave goodbye
ZCMI
ZCMI Surrender or die!
ZCMI I'm that high flyin' guy
ZCMI Yeah! I smile and wave goodbye...
ZCMI When the moon sails by....
Yeah! I'm the ZCMI
