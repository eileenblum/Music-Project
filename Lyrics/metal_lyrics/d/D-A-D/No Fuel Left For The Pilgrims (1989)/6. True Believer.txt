I have my hair high and low
Anywhere the wind blows
I'm doing M.P.H. anywhere my soul goes
I'm hell riding and gasoline d
That's all I need for the life that I lead

I'm a true believer Yes I am
You try and get me if I can

Yeah! I'm riding alone and I've drugged my senses
There's no one else to take the consequences
See when the is gone free and the night creeps up on me
I take my B.M.W. that's where I wanna be...

I'm a true believer Yes I am
And you try to get me if you can
Get me! Honk!! Honk!!! Argh.!!
True believer Yes I am.
True believer Yes I am..
True believer Yes I am...
True believer Yes I am...
