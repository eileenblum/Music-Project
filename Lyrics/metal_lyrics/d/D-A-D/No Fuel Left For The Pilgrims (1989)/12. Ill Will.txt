What we need isn't systems
Or some regulating plans
But bigger guns to shoot with
And a bigger type of man
Ill Will
For good or ill my iron will
Is unrivalled still Evil ill thrill
This is the curse to me and my friends
Ill will No patterns No sense

I hate mental exercise
Thinking gives me pain
I know don't turn out
That way
But here we go again:
Ill Will
For good or ill my iron will
Is unrivalled still Evil ill thrill
This is the curse to me and my friends
Ill will No patterns No sense

Rock'n'Roll!
Yeah! Ill will!!!
