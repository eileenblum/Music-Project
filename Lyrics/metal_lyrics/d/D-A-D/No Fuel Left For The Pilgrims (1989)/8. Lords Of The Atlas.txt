In my travelling heart, there's an urge to see
Foreign lands and alien birds, new stories that noone heard
To stick a pin in the globe and to believe and hope
There's a whole new world to unravel
As far as a boyscout can travel..
Company of adventurers On the secret track
Caesars of the wilderness Around the world and back
Cardcarrying members Lords of the atlas

To see God standing on a local hill
And to know there's forests unthrod still
Don't look back when you climb the stairs
I'm travelling on mental fares
Going through the eternal cloudland
To the ends of the world..
And after 2000 steps of climbing...
- I know it was the whole trip worth!
Company of adventurers On the secret track
Caesars of the wilderness Around the world and back
Cardcarrying members Lords of the atlas
- We're the lords Yeah, we're the lords of the atlas

Sitting crosslegged on a persian rug
Addicted to a 1000 drugs
Our flags nailed onto a mast
Captain says: Forward .!
