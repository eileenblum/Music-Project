I'll start your day with a shock
See one of these days 'bout 12 o'clock
The world will turn into a little rock
And it's going to fall down with the sound of a knock
See I'm one of these guys who's nice to know
'cause I know a place to go
It's just down the generation gap
I'll take you there in a red hot cab
And if you want I mean you really really want
I'll show you my hometown and it's down
Yeah, you can tell by the smell
So close you can hear them yell

They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
Oh Lord, let me live to tell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell

And meet your host lift your glass of a toast
Don't be afraid of the colours he wear
Look around: all your friends are here
Now don't say you've had enough, stay a while, stay tough!
Grab his horns like you just don't care
We'll eat his fire and drink what's there, yeah!
'cause if you want (I'll take you down down)
I mean you really really want (I'll show you my hometown)
Let's stay until the end, the very end!
And to be saved by the bell
So close we almost feel

They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
Yeah, you can tell by the smell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
To the edge and back and to the edge again
Too hot for the D.J. and too hot for his friends

C'mon party!

They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
Yeah! They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
Oh Lord, let me live to tell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
Please, I can't stand the smell
They throw the best damn parties at the rim of Hell
