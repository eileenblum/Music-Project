Yeah! I heard a phone ring from deep down within
A friendly voice whistling under my skin
Yeay! I have to stop my enterprise below
But I'm not so sure the guy will let me go...
Yeah! My girls says I'm overdressed and my God says nothing at all
Yeah! It's funny how I'm in hip-deep ls like the D's got my soul
Overmuch I'm too much I'm overmuch
I'm way over Overmuch
I'm too much I'm overmuch
I'm way out of reach and way out of touch

And I roll on the floor that's what the floor is for
And I walk out that door that's what the door is for
In the night I'm way out of sight
But in the I keep getting in the way Yeah!!
You see my friends says I'm over the top and I should chill out the wild
But, you can see it in my face and my smile I'm gonna stay for a while
Overmuch I'm too much I'm overmuch
I'm way over Overmuch
I'm too much Too overmuch
Much Much Much Much Overmuch AhhYeah!
Overmuch I wasn't born as such
Overmuch But I've become way I've become way
Overmuch But I've become way I've become way
Overmuch But I've become way I've become way
I'm way over overmuch Overmuch
That's what I am, Yeah! I'm overmuch
Yeah, tell me... Overmuch
I'm not like other men I'm too much I'm overmuch!
