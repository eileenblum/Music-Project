Mumbling goodmorning and raising my head
A breath kiss to my pillow pet
I take a look at the turns and stay in bed
Open my eyes when the have died
I turned the world and I slept allright
Now my mare is over I zip my jeans tight
Oh lord won't you bless this night...

From the pale lips of a youth who lay
I'm sleeping my away
And when the night comes to the city I say:
I'm sleeping my away
Yeah! With my pale lips in the pillow I say:
I'm sleeping my away
After dark is the game I play
I'm sleeping my away I'm sleeping my away

When my dreams begin I'd be proud to be letting you in
With a smile on my face I guide our dreamboat in
So if you wanna travel along with me
You better sleep tight the rest of the
You see I could be a sleeper it's not rest I lack
'Coz I hit the sack when the suns coming back

From the pale lips of a youth who lay
I'm sleeping my away
And when the night comes to the city I say:
I'm sleeping my away
Yeah! With my pale lips in the pillow I say:
I'm sleeping my away
That after dark â is the game I play
I'm sleeping my , I'm sleeping my , I'm sleeping my
I'm sleeping my away
I'm sleeping my away
Yeah! Now I've turned the world around yeah! I did it again
I'm sleeping my away
And now I have to wear my shades down sleepers lane
I'm sleeping my away
Yeah! All the good have gone to bed again
I'm sleeping my away
'Coz the devil's at work inside my brain
I'm sleeping my away I'm sleeping my away
I'm sleeping my away I'm sleeping my away away...
