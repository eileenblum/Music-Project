I am disintegrating
The man I used to be
Slowly evaporating
Still I fight the process
Longing to remain
If it were up to me
I would stay the same

But it's not up to me
And that sets me free
I rest in knowing that
Though I am a mess
I am possessed

You will never change
You will never leave
You always finish what you start and
You're working in me
And you will never fail

I am disappearing
Right before my eyes
Moving towards the clearing
Still I fight the process
Longing to remain
If it were up to me
I would stay the same

(But) You will never fail
