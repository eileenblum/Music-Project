You're still clutching to your broken heart
Standing on these hollow bones
Believing the lie that you can do this on your own

Just take it away

Take this emptiness inside
Give me something real
It seems I can't rely on how I feel
Take this pain away
It's killing me
I've had all I can take
Now set me free

You don't know what you're asking for

Take these pieces of my life
Put them back together
I keep losing this fight
And it's been forever
Take this pain away
It's killing me
I've had all I can take
Now set me free

You don't know what you're asking for

I'm making all things new
And it starts with you
Brace yourself for the end
For the end of yourself
