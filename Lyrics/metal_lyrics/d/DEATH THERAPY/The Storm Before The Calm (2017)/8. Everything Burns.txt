The flesh canât keep the ghost within
Once the voice has been heard
The bonds dissolve, the light increases
Underneath the skin

Break away
Make the turn
Walk away
And watch it burn

I know that the end is coming
I hear the beating of the heart
That sends all the darkness running
And brings a brand new start

The shadows growing longer every day
Darkening the surface
They still point the way, just in reverse
I know the dawn is coming
(When) everything will burn
