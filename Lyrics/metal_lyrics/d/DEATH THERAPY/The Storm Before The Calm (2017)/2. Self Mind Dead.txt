The door is swinging from its hinges
But you've no interest in escaping
The walls that you have felt so safe in
Become a prison of your making

When blind lead the blind
Only darkness they find

The road is paved with good intentions
But you've no idea where you're going
Betrayed by your own inventions
Without knowing

But you don't see it
Your eyes are clenched like fists
No, you don't even feel it
Oh, how your blindfold fits

Are you a parasite
Or a proselyte
Is it ignorance
Or arrogance
I see no difference
No light
