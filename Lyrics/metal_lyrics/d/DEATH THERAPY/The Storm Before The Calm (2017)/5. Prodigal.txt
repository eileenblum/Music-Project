Can you hear me
I'm dying, crying out
Show me something
I'm starting to doubt
Is heaven silent
Were you ever there
Give me a reason
To think you even care

(I'm) falling faster with each passing day
All the pieces slowly break away
Revealing hollowness inside
If you're alive then there's no need to hide

Show yourself
Don't hide from me
No worn out slogans
Just help me see

Run
Runaway
Run to me

Can you hear me
With my dying breath
It is finished
I'm swallowed up in death
But that's not the end
I am the victory
The grave is conquered
And you can be free

(You're) falling faster with each passing day
Little pieces slowly break away
Revealing hollowness deep down inside
If you're alive then there's no need to hide

Show yourself
Don't hide from me
No worn out slogans
Just run to me

I came to you when you couldn't come to me
