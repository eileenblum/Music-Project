Am I living or dead?
- unchecked aggression
Is it real or in my head?
- a learned lesson
Now I choose to defect.
- release

Desperation fueled by insanity.
Uncreation. Dead inside of me
All is unreal. Feel how I feel.

Internal peaks and valleys.
Cerebral maze of twisted alleys.

No escape. All will fall.
Broken will. Sunken pill.
Shallow hell. No feelingâs real.
Run the course or storm the walls.

Sick thoughts from a depraved mind
unrelent in visions of the wrong kind.
Desperation fueled by normality.
Recreation, unoriginality
All is unreal. Feel how I feel.

Create desperation
Am I living or dead?
- unchecked aggression
Is it real or in my head?
- a learned lesson
Now I choose to defect.
Iâm free.
