No disguise.
You cannot hide.
My quest is faultless when I despise.
Your death I seek.
Your presence weak.
Turn to me and see what I have see.

Pathetic man with a feeble hand that will meet my heel

I am strength, pain, &amp; suffering
Before me now kneel

True enemy

Remorse is heavy and repentance is futile.
I will give you none.
Regret is useless and you will remain rueful.
Absolution is vicious. Suffer.

Inner unrest, to thee I test
I am my own enemy

My aberration will be my damnation
Outside the line, with no command
Iâll be ruled by no puppet hand

Absolution from myself
No solution, no way out
Count the days feel the years
Like a hammer to your skull

Deceased alive, nightmare inside
My foe is me, his enemy is you
No escape, and how time begets you.
