Do not do unto me.
My disgust is unending.
Serve to me what you will.
Iâll not digest.
No, mercyâs for the truest
No, forgotten land awaits

Cleanse the earth of false assessment as
I make my way through.
Bearing alms for the deprived and
the end for you.
This is my promised land.
May you rejoice in me.
This is the forgotten land.
May you succumb to me.

Wretch

Dead is my patience
Tired is your method
The time for end is now
Enter the forgotten land

New eyes view only dirt.
Iâll make them see.
New mouths eat only shit.
Iâll feed them nothing.

Destroy the promised land.
Enter the forgotten land.
Forget mercy.
Forget me.
