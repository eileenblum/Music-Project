I see the truth, I know your lies,
Cowards avert their eyes
So donât tell me what I donât know.
Your faults, I will show.
Coward. I canât wait to watch your blood flow.

Stride intrepid walks, play like youâll
battle to the end.
Well I know the truth.
Lecture fearless talk, act like God is your friend.
No, you are a bootlicker
you cower with your hands.

Send me threats
Tell me lies, about my brothers
whom you despise
it must be hurt to be your black eyes.
I know the truth and where your crown lies.
Not here you gutless fuck.

Invincible, irrepressible, impossible to defeat,
oh yeah, âyouâll show meâ¦â while you are
six feet deep.

Stride intrepid walks, play like youâll
battle to the end.
Well I know the truth.
Lecture fearless talk, act like God is your friend.
No, you are a bootlicker
you cower by my hands.

Coward. You yellow belly fuck.
