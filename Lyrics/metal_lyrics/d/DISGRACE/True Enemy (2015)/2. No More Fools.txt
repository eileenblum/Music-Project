Bring me their heads with sullen eyes
Soaked in sorrow, no more cries

The hourglass flips, time stars anew
Bullshit shown to be true
Now live in it.

Send the message clear
No quarter given here
I wonât be made a fool.
(Iâll prove thee a fool)

Kill or be killed or not
Know not what I have wrought
Cowardice tenfold
So fucking sick of you.

Greyness buried in the sand
Kingdom, the risen land
Dust to dust to dust to dust
I bathe in ashes made of trust and blood.
