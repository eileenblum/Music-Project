Wait not on the threshold
Be with me in the dark
Become all the hallways
And now take your mark
Around your neck
Breathe your final breath.

At the gallows, youâll swing for me
Weâve lured you int eh shallows
1000 voices sing to thee

Shake and tremble
Is it darkness or 1000 suns? Euphoric, hysteric
Unmatched, the joy I feel
Feel the beat of the funeral drum
As the crows sing your final song

Now it be done, Amen.
You say forgiveness
I speak revenge

I canât look away as I watch you sway.
