Delirium drives me
Madness subsides me
Salivation, cupidity
Iâll drown in your deluge

Come and comfort me
Let me drink from you
Dive, sip, drip

Satiate &amp; satisfy.
No well will run dry
As the rain will cleanse (flow)
Overflow

Fulfilled
Unmoving, re-sinking
No will
No motion. No thinking.
Possession, protection
Chalice filled to brim.
Iâll drink again.

Satiate &amp; swallow
No longer hollow
The fix is in again.
