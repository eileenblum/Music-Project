Your eyes are like the city lights
Castigating yellow lies
and it burns to touch,
but I couldnât resist.
Canât see forward
My shame hides my eyes
No flame burns bright enough to light a path
for my stride
Singed by the weight
The longing charred
Take me home
To where I lie
You wonât tell me the truth now
You wonât hear my cries
Remember the pain
If you think to come back again
