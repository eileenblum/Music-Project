Rule the empire of shit
Rule the fool who steps in it
Cruel, the oppressing throne
Crush the remaining bones

The blind voice of time
Fissure of a vein
Everlasting hell flower
Veiled misery

Slave to the Lead God

Rule the kingdom of shit
Rule the fool who drinks from it
Cruel, the oppressing drones
Crush the remaining clones

No fear left to face
Immortal sin, born, the human race
Crooked and corrupt
Born reversed, they must be stopped

Pray for death to strike.
Die with hands that hold you tight.
Writhe furthermore.

Rule the kingdom of shit
Laugh at the fool who steps in it
Cruel, the oppressing throne
Become the force that tears it down.
