Dust settles
I catch my breath
Heart calms
I see nothing left
All dead.

No foes remain.
The fools who opposed shall never be named.
Never
Victory attained.

Used you as a stepping stone.
Your blood between my toes.

None left to conquer.
Victory attained.
The battleâs over.
The price was paid.

New dawn ahead is freedom.
When Iâm done there will be non.
Foes fought, hell was brought
Your beloved be hated.
Truths now known.

No allies.
No enemies
Only victory.

None left to conquer.
All laid to waste.
I win.
