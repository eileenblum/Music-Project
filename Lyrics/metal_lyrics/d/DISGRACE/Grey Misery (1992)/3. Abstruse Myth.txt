An absolution into futility
For the sake of of stony eyes
We betrayed ourselves
In crystal brightness

The blind... SACRIFICED

The silhouette of faith
The wall of sourness
A vortex in a blazing pitch
A drowning draw

Abysmal... invisible swamp

Abstruse myth
Do you see those trees?
Don't you feel it's true?
Mass of people inside my body
Nerves under my skin

Together we're watching
In the triangular circle
Thrall hangs from his neck
Hempen nose abrades

A tear absorbs the soil
The tear which fell from your cheek
And we just laugh
The lunatic laughter of life

Echoing through lands
Echoing through forests

Flowing so slowly
Black and abysmal
The altar of the earth
The stream of HADES

An amorphous culture
An absurd desert without a coast
Ten darkish mirages
The guardians of MORPHEUS

The blind... SACRIFICED

ABSTRUSE...

Lost entrances
Are dimly seen in the mist
Solitude monuments
Please hear my supplication

Subsidence under the waves
River, raise me up
Before the focus of the sea
... CATCH ME!
