Buried alive
Man amidst the pandemonium
In a trench
Of mud and blood... anticipation

A helmet full of brain
It's forbidden to use 'em
Ear drums spoiled
By pressure

Eyes are gazing at eternity
Among the corpses and smoke
There's no immortality
The order is life

Futility kills
It dominates and affects
One and a thousand
Are a hundred

Anticipation and combat
Waste of all
Those hypocrites
They won't awake

"Hallowed be thy name!"
The ditches of vanity are beyond
The flag is the last guilt
The one...

A gauze for the journey
Through the universe
You're flying
To the land of marble temples

Stories of a monster
And I've waited for my end
Fairy tales of pouring lands
The stench of air petrified

Golden temple
Porcelain stairs

Inheretix, my mistress

I adore your calm mask
Pictures of tomorrow

Obscurity in the azure

Your horizon
Reflects your infernal continence

An aberrant mind above us, a sanctuary
Missing wanderers
Filled by vacuum
The holy centre of universe...
