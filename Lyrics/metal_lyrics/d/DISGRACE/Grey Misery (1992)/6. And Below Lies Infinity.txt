Take a view inside the stranger's eye
A vacuum filled soul, mind petrified
Black fields of mortality
Burned again

Skies turned into deep red
Earth's fist melts down

APPREHENSION

Ominous serpent of time
Bleak entanglement thoughts

NO ENTRANCE

Sickness grows besides boredom
The symptoms of schizophrenia
Sneer echoing into the void
An agonised pressure

AND BELOW LIES ETERNITY

Your soul crucified
You're more sour than death
A widow raped by hatred
A spider in the ruins of consciousness

FOR YOU PEOPLE ARE FLIES...
