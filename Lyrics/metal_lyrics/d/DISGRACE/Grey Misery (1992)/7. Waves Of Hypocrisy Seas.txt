Darkness growls...
The last day of deranged man
No aim or future
For living on this globe

Tomorrow rises...
Weakened pilgrim gives up
Old man sits down on the glass rock
On the coast of purple sea

Last wizard, the warlord of lives
Has lost his empire of agony
In vain, he faces the truth
And dives into the heart of sea

Under the waves of hypocrisy seas
He finds his favour world
Flashing trees and unknown bees
Empty closets are smiling
