I wipe the dust from my eyes
Start to remember pieces
Of what has become
A strive for order as we die out

No... law
The hunt is on, go to war
We'll unite again

A fast decline
Lied to, slowly cornered
This is the day
We all face the consequences
They felt, they knew
They always saw it coming
Purity crumbled
Feels like fiction as we cry out

A new creation is upon us
Forceful dominion
The separation

What is one life worth?
A piece of gold or two
Or a drop of water
Left to fight and shatter
In my mind I see reunion

No... law
The hunt is on, go to war
We'll unite again

Their doctrine is now abandoned
They fled the scene, cowards
A race we're forced to enter
Feels like fiction as we cry out
No matter how unreal it is
To see you bleed
Though torn apart
What we share will last forever

[Solo - Sebastian]

Why do it come to this?
Where do we go from here?

A new creation is upon us
Forceful dominion
The separation

A new creation is upon us
Forceful dominion
The separation
The separation is now
