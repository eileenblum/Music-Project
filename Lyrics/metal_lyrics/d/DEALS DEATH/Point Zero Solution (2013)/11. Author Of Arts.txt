Open the gate
And step into the unknown realm
Inch by inch
Sense the sane
Resuscitate hibernate states of mind
Piece by piece

Born of slaves
No need to kneel anymore
Reborn slaves
The future calls

Fields of dust
One empire falls another one dawns
Born again
In the aftermath
In the piles of debris we rise
Inch by inch

When ashes don't rain

[Chorus:]
Become an author or arts
It will start from the ground unbound
Put it to rest though in our hearts
We professed an eternal, magical youth

[Chorus:]
Author or arts
It will start from the ground unbound
Put it to rest though in our hearts
We professed an eternal, magical youth

Open the gate
And embrace the unknown as yourself
Inch by inch
Eah
Sense the sane
Resuscitate hibernated states of mind
Piece by piece

Born of slaves
No need to kneel anymore
Reborn slaves
The future calls

Fields of dust
The counterfeit majesty has fallen
Born again
The spurious throne revealed
Inch by inch

When ashes don't rain

[Chorus:]
Become an author or arts
It will start from the ground unbound
Put it to rest though in our hearts
We professed an eternal, magical youth

[Chorus:]
Author or arts
It will start from the ground unbound
Put it to rest though in our hearts
We professed an eternal, magical youth

[Solo - Sebastian]

Born of slaves
No need to kneel anymore
Reborn slaves
The future calls
