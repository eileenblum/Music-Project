Structural flatline

Society's demise
Not only an imminent threat
There's no denying the collapse
Panic spreads 'cause the pipes have run dry

Structural flatline
A new set of rules
By nature dictated
A downfall of fools

The looting begins
Armed herds fill up the streets
Caught up by errors of the past
Blinded by faith
Mindless trust run amok

Structural flatline
A new set of rules
By nature dictated
A downfall of fools

[Chorus:]
The end of a paradigm has come
We have fallen down
Into a self-made hell
Prepare for tribulation

Denial is washed away as we face reality
What we held dear is gone
Panic spreads cause the pipes have run dry

Structural flatline
A new set of rules
By nature dictated
A downfall of fools

[Chorus:]
The end of a paradigm has come
We have fallen down
Into a self-made hell
Prepare for tribulation

Eeeh-bwah

[Solo - Erik/Sebastian]

Structural flatline
A new set of rules
By nature dictated
A downfall of fools

[Chorus:]
The end of a paradigm has come
We have fallen down
Into a self-made hell
Prepare for tribulation
