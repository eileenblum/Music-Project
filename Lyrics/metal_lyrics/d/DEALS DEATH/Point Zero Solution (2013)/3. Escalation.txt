Escalation, we all see the signs
What we cherished redefines
Nothing to do but await the day
Fallacies caught up with us
Soon we will pay

Those who know will disappear
We're stranded on this bloody scene
Nothing to do but await the day
Fallacies caught up with us
Soon we will pay

[Chorus:]
The truth is changing color
Rapid and merciless
In spite of all our innocence
Forward to punishment
Escalation
Escalation

Eah

The march goes on, faster and faster
A race against time
To prepare for disaster
Nothing to do but await the day
Fallacies caught up with us
Soon we will pay

[Solo - Erik]

[Chorus:]
The truth is changing color
Rapid and merciless
In spite of all our innocence
Forward to punishment
Escalation
Escalation
