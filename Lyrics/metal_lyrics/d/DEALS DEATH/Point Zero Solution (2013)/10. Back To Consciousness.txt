Time to put this chasm to rest
Time to close the gap between sane and insane
Time to see what a travesty we've built
Time to realise what it means
To leave it all to the top of the pyramid

A greedy hunt for possession
To borrow alleviation
Not again, no more

[Chorus:]
Revive, your mind has been down for too long
Back to consciousness
Crush, create
Design, a future constrained by no one
Back to consciousness, dominate

Rip open the mask
Expose the rottenness
Reclaim and reconquer stolen intelligence

Rise from slumber
Too much time has passed
Run the numbers
Back to consciousness

[Solo - Erik]

A greedy hunt for possession
To borrow alleviation
Not again, no more

[3x chorus:]
Revive, your mind has been down for too long
Back to consciousness
Crush, create
Design, a future constrained by no one
Back to consciousness, dominate
