Morality's strained
When no one is taking the blame
We call each other insane
They're gonna do it again to get away
With this...
... Impossible gamble, a calamity jungle
When humanity strangles
The insanity spirals

Repeat once more
To see if miracles happen again
Blindfolded truth
Through decades
Buried and pushed away
Soon to come alive

[Chorus:]
A bleak vision
Obvious but ignored
Facing the echoes
The fake smile stays on
When decisions never come we go on
Facing the echoes
With fake lives we carry on

Blinded by faith in what is going to break
We will repeat our mistakes
If we don't spot what is fake
We're lead astray

From obvious signs
Denied by devious minds
They say it's still undefined
You've got to wait for tomorrow

Repeat once more
To see if miracles happen again
Blindfolded truth
Through decades
Buried and pushed away
Soon to come alive

[Chorus:]
A bleak vision
Obvious but ignored
Facing the echoes
The fake smile stays on
When decisions never come we go on
Facing the echoes
With fake lives we carry on

[Solo - Erik]

[Chorus:]
A bleak vision
Obvious but ignored
Facing the echoes
The fake smile stays on
When decisions never come we go on
Facing the echoes
With fake lives we carry on
