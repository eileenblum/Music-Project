It started from greed
Passed on through fear and ridiculous needs
Can we possibly leave?
We lie in our filth, we diminish our breed
Diminish our breed
Forced to away what we cannot redeem

Everything has a price
To wallow in luxury is the disguise
A decaying design
Under the ground lies the heaven malign

A great life we've had
A fake life we shared
Society's demons will soon be declared

[Chorus:]
Point Zero Solution awaits us all
Dismissed as illusion to keep us conformed
We spent until the end
Point Zero Solution
Inevitable

Our way of life has strangled us
Clueless we sculpted the end
Empty, drain and cover with lies
There's no such thing as a bottomless pit
With endless supplies

[Solo - Erik]

[Solo - Sebastian]

A great life we've had
A fake life we shared
Society's demons will soon be declared

[Chorus:]
Point Zero Solution awaits us all
Dismissed as illusion to keep us conformed
We spent until the end
Point Zero Solution
Inevitable
