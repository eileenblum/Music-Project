All systems shut down one by one
It stretches our sanity
Leaving us, trapping us, ripping us apart

Supplies are gone
Prepare to kill
Or be killed
Are we still morally superior?

As we cling to life chaos aligns
You better watch your back
You have now become the prey

[Chorus:]
A passion for infinity
Comes crashing down in our face
Fervent until the breaking point
There is nothing but reality

Desperate measures, our only escape
Prepare to get primal
Or be killed, no free will
Freedom is utopia for anyone alive

As we cling to life chaos aligns
You better watch your back
You have now become the prey

[Chorus:]
A passion for infinity
Comes crashing down in our face
Fervent until the breaking point
There is nothing but reality

[Solo - Erik]

[Chorus:]
A passion for infinity
Comes crashing down in our face
Fervent until the breaking point
There is nothing but reality

[Chorus:]
A passion for infinity
Comes crashing down in our face
Fervent until the breaking point
There is nothing but reality
