As we start over again
In the haze of confessions
Beyond our wildest dreams
There's no structure to rely on
In the Haze of regression
We'll face our deepest fesrs

So now we have a choice
A clear vision or deception
A struggle as old as time
Leaders, step forward now
We cry out for progression
Free from odious plans

Natus in novum mundum

[Chorus:]
Somnum exterreri
Dark dream dawn...
Satus realitatem
... is now
Somnum exterreri
Dark dream dawn...
Satus realitatem

[Solo - Erik/Sebastian]

Now we have started over again
After shocking confessions
Beyond our wildest dreams
Leaders, step forward now
We cry out for progressions
Free from odious plans

Natus in novum mundum

[Chorus:]
Somnum exterreri
Dark dream dawn...
Satus realitatem
... is now
Somnum exterreri
Dark dream dawn...
Satus realitatem
