As we scan for reasons we find a reverence
A belief in eternity of what will fade

A path towards pollution of our minds
To only see what you want
To own all you can dream of
Blind design
Stained your mind

[Chorus:]
Sanity laid to waste
Credulity beyond reason
We thought that nothing would change
Beyond reason

Creating invisible money
That paves way for despair
Our filth was flooding the system
To a level it could not bare

A path towards pollution of our minds
To only see what you want
To own all you can dream of
Blind design
Stained your mind

[Chorus:]
Sanity laid to waste
Credulity beyond reason
We thought that nothing would change
Beyond reason

We brought this on ourselves
It was bound to happen

[Solo - Erik/Sebastian]

As we scan for reasons we find a reverence
A belief in eternity of what will fade

A path towards pollution of our minds
To only see what you want
To own all you can dream of
Blind design
Stained your mind

[Chorus:]
Sanity laid to waste
Credulity beyond reason
We thought that nothing would change
Beyond reason

[Chorus:]
Sanity laid to waste
Credulity beyond reason
We thought that nothing would change
(Would change)
Beyond reason

Beyond reason
