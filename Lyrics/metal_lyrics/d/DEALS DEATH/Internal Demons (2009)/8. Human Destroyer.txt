Donât say my name, I cannot fall into light.
A useless leftover tearing apart.
All that you worked for destroyed. Fuck you!

Donât say my name, a choice you can stand up against.
A feeling of wanting is heading your way.
All I can say is good luck.

Cause I donât give a fuck where you set your feet, where you go to sleep.
Itâs all just disgrace to smudge your name.

A human destroyer

Tell me the way, the way to salvation.
Still I have strength left to fuck up your day.
A crucial component is here.

Watch as I blow up your soul. Iâm out of control.
I donât give a shit about your god damn hunger.

[Chorus:]
Try to rid me of my enemy. A risk to be taken.
A force to dark to deny see for yourself what a souls power can do.
Its horrible insides. A plan that is yet to be complete.
A human destroyer

Now it is time. Wage war on the weakened.
A purpose to live by, a wishful design.
A fucking empire. Hell yeah!

Do say my name. Your boss stands before you.
A judge full of hatred is looking at you.
Itâs time that you pay for your sins.

And I donât give a fuck where you set your feet, where you go to sleep.
Its all just disgrace to smudge your name.

[Chorus:]
Try to rid me of my enemy...
