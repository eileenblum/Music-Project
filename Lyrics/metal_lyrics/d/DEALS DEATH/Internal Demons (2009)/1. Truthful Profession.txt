Itâs not my fault there is no one to blame
Iâm driven by my own hunger
A perfect world where there is no turning back
And nothing to reach for when all turns black

Mourning and suffering are well known feelings
Thereâs a history with me in denial
A work in progress yeah a fucking clichÃ©
Leave not for tomorrow what you do today

Let go your mind is free
Yet this is hunting me

[Chorus:]
Take this life, throw it away, this night is here to stay
Do as you please while Iâm still on my knees, I try to recall but itâs all forgotten
Take this life, throw it away, itâs as clear as the brightest day
A rescue mission on the edge of destruction, a smiling face in the arms of seduction

As I still linger on to find the source of solution
Iâm struck by a sort of confusion
Another mind who will answer my questions
Another life with a truthful profession

[Chorus]

Take this life, throw it awayâ¦
