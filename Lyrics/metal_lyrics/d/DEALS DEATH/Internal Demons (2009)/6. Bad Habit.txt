Leave me alone I donât want your offer.
Go take care of someone else.
Preach your salvation to the young.
A strange behavior I need what is wanted a lifetime of hunger.
I canât get out I am stuck.

Take what you need, I surrender Iâm beaten, a first class victory.
Just take my hand and give me peace.
As morning comes, the urge is to strong my life is forgotten.
Truth or dare? I want none.

The sigs of destruction is near, a feeling of wanting.
The rescue is all in your head. Try to forget.

[Chorus:]
Smoke, Its powers consume you. A worst case scenario is formed by the heat.
Itâs almost complete, just sit back and watch how you suffer defeat.

What to say Iâm down in the gutter, Iâve fallen way behind.
The genius head does not comply.
A lonely pleasure, a way to release all the shit that has filled me.
Iâm off to get another round.

[Chorus]

Smoke, Its powersâ¦
