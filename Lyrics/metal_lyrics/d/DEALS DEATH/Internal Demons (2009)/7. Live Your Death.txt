Walk in the night, forget about the riot
We`re a dying breed
The light has left us forsaken, thereâs not a chance

Let go, come into the shadows.
A perfect match.
Soon you`ll see what powers possess us.
You will make heads roll (come and join us)

You are an ant through a looking glass

[Chorus:]
All these lies in my head they all make me sick.
A trust made worthy is but gone.
All I know is that nothing stays inside, it all gets out.
Remember these words and live your death to the fullest

Let it all go, let it turn over
They are just bugs in our master plan
One day this thought will be well known
Even by those penguin motherfuckers

The power from a driven soul is ten times stronger
Than all the weapons in this world
Find your way in this haze of betrayal
One day you`ll die

[Chorus]

All these liesâ¦
