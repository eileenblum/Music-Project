Something came out to rule the wicked world of men.
Something that will fill you with hate.

All this time I canât believe we didnât see it.
But it has come to be.

Control their anger, control their hate.
Itâs the law that comes with wicked men.
Forever trapped in this hellhole of theirs.

[Chorus:]
You just woke up in a world without forgiveness.
A master plan at its peak.
We must fight, we must learn the liars truth.
And steal the right to speak.

Open your mind and let the thoughts of evil come this way.
Let them run right through your heart â¦you canât denyâ¦

A passageway to all the dreams that you hold dear.
Now go my child, get rid of all that stupid fear.

Control their angerâ¦

[Chorus:]
You just woke upâ¦
