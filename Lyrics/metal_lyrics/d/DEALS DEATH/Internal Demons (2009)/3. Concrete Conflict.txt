A trial by fire, I want to fly higher to smell the burning smoke.
I drift towards freedom, a dream to believe in, I am the first in line.

Hatred, the feeling is fresh. I feast upon your burning flesh.
Touch me and I`ll rip you apart, slaughter your soul and fucking eat your heart.

A tale of thousand lies is told as lightning hits me in the head.
I load my guns and fall in line.
I prepare myself for...

[Chorus:]
War, a time to feast.
A humble request makes me bleed like the rivers flow.
Friends in need. I wait as the days all go on as itâs all tooâ¦

â¦late to remember how it all once was.
How we were fighting for a different cause.
All that is left is now a rotting land.
A fallen dream as I get dirt on my hand.

I canât help but thinking thereâs a problem to solve.
A solution that will greet us all.
Come take a stand as you follow my trail.
All in despair shall know that we are Deals Death.

Hatred, the feelingâs still pure. Grab an axe itâs time to secure.
Open a hatch and throw a bomb inside.
Oh, later you can cry about all who died.

Wishful thinking, itâs hard to stop drinking, a leash to cut in half.
Now think of what youâve done.
Established world peace and killed everyone.

A tale of thousand liesâ¦

[Chorus:]
War, a time to feastâ¦
