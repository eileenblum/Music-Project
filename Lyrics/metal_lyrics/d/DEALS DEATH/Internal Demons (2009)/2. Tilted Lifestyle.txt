A gun pointing at me, yet the will to live is gone
A road to disaster. Iâve broken all my laws

Now I can sit back, sit back and just relax.
Become a storyteller, a way to find all ways

Crossing the line of death
This path will reveal itself
A reckless behaviour will tell me no more
My light is forever gone

[Chorus:]
They say that all that comes up will be shot down immediately
My plan is based on this agreement, 3 2 1 and face your extinction
Boom, your life will be flushed out
Fire, I can feel it inside
I need a break to take care of my interests
Fill my days with a lot of lonely pleasures
A ticket to the train that is bound for total madness

Please help me, I long for my own answers
Will my soul be forgiven?
Or will it be crushed like a bug on a concrete wall

Iâve read the final chapter. Iâve seen it all end well
But thereâs a risk to take, a fallen goal will tell

Crossing the line of deathâ¦

[Chorus]

They say that all that comes upâ¦
