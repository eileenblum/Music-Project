Aoh

A secret kept hidden
All questions forbidden for life
All knowledge dissolving
A quest for a merciless death

The victims are crawling
As misslies are falling like rain
With hope gone forsaken
With one blow ther'yre taken away

[Chorus:]
We are blinded by a curtain of insanity
Time will tell when we will realize
Realize it
The world has come to an end
Deserted civilization
There will be nothing left
We are forced to collapse

Commotion
Disorder
The ravaged existence of making
Is everyone's legacy
A world left in ruins
It's everyone's blame

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
We are blinded by a curtain of insanity
Time will tell when we will realize
Realize it
The world has come to an end
Deserted civilization
There will be nothing left
We are forced to collapse

[Chorus:]
We are blinded by a curtain of insanity
Time will tell when we will realize
Realize it
The world has come to an end
Deserted civilization
There will be nothing left
We are forced to collapse
