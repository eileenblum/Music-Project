A darkened sky is forming
In front of everyone's eyes
What the future tells of
Is all written in lies
The chosen elite of humans
Is letting it happen
They are waiting
To take us all

[Chorus:]
The future of humanity
Is written in blood
The making of a coming breed
Will cause the whole world to bleed

All the bonds are broken
Now we turn into beasts
This situation's bringing us
To where nobody's been
A civil breakdown
It has happened again
Now it's obvious
Man and beast
It's all the same

[Chorus:]
The future of humanity
Is written in blood
The making of a coming breed
Will cause the whole world to bleed

Elite
Excellence
The world becomes a tomb
Inherited
Eminence
Depopulated fields

Elite
Excellence
The world becomes a tomb
Inherited
Eminence
Depopulated fields

We pray for miracles
We pray to feel at ease
Self-proclaimed domination
You just wait and see
Our true nature shows
In the trails of chaos
When the end seems closer than ever

[Solo]

Yaaaah!

A quest for domination
One way esteem
Soon they're taking over
To forever reign supreme
The scorn felt by many
A fucking stab in the back
A sinister plan is complete
With the purpose to conquer
Enslave and to govern the earth

[Chorus:]
The future of humanity
Is written in blood
The making of a coming breed
Will cause the whole world to bleed

Elite
Excellence
The world becomes a tomb
Inherited
Eminence
Depopulated fields

Elite
(Elite)
Excellence
The world becomes a tomb
Inherited
(Inherited)
Eminence
Depopulated fields
Eoh!
