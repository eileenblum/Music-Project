Aaa-yaoh!

Don't really care
About your title
You must
Wake up
What really put you in position?
Trapped behind walls
Guarded by authority
Wake up
Why should we
Be under supervision?

Greed is the fuel that feed
These soulless corporations
Lend a finger
And your hand will soon
Be grasped by corruption

Hierarchy

Trapped in a world
Where ones misery
Leads to another's fortune
Wake up
Mind the knowledge
Of an equal
Isolation spawned by indifference
Wake up
Your prejudice will be your fall

The chains of apathy
Keeps restraining us
As we are
Pushed back
Preventing you from making
Your own decisions
Silenced because of what
You believe
Break through
To form your own destiny

[Chorus:]
Take back your twisted belief
Reason has been seized by fools
Break through
These chains of redemption
Treason is tempting me

[Chorus:]
Take back your twisted belief
Reason has been seized by fools
Break through
These chains of redemption
Treason is tempting me

Hierarchy

The hierarchy is an insult
That drains the human dignity
Watch as the future
Of makind's getting stupefied

Eoh!

[Chorus:]
Take back your twisted belief
Reason has been seized by fools
Break through
These chains of redemption
Treason is tempting me

[Chorus:]
Take back your twisted belief
Reason has been seized by fools
Break through
These chains of redemption
Treason is tempting me
