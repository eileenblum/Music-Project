Yaaaaaaah

Rebellion
The thought is still living in my mouth
A treacherous gift is falling apart
When all is said and done
Hatred is showing its face once more
In all our hearts
A master plan for all the damned
Comes written in stone to take us down

As fire starts to spread the word
A message that consumes their world
All they get in responce
Is a fucking act
Not much time is left for peace
As we force you down upon your knees
Let's cover it up
And let them die
Let them die

[Chorus:]
Eradicate them all
They don't belong
An army of determination
Will soon be here
Eradicate them all
Before they grow too strong
The secrets must be hidden
For all eternity

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Eradicate them all
They don't belong
An army of determination
Will soon be here
Eradicate them all
Before they grow too strong
The secrets must be hidden
For all eternity
