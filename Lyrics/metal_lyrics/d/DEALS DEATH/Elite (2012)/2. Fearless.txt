Aaah

Long ago I felt the need
The need to fall apart
It was all due to the rules
And the once unholy laws
I got my fix from burning
All the bridges that I had
I surrendered my soul to the world
And let my mind drift away
To darkened lands

I met myself and told me
That it wasn't my time to die
A more important fate
Had become my guide to clarity

[Chorus:]
I am fearless
There is nothing for me to hide
Fearless
All that was has become a lie
Fearless
A drop of blood to secure socitety
Fearless
I am all that I ever need to be

War is ocming fast
But in people's minds
Life goes on
The truth is coming
Believe it or not
But we will fall

(We will fall)
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus:]
I am fearless
There is nothing for me to hide
Fearless
All that was has become a lie
Fearless
A drop of blood to secure socitety
Fearless
I am all that I ever need to be
