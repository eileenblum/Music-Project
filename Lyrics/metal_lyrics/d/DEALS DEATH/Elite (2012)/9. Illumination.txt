I reach for the strength
In my damaged soul
Weakened by the values
Set by us all
Life was nothing worth
Without the fix
Fill me up
Or leave me to die

[Chorus:]
Insomnia takes its toll
Don't let me fade anymore

My existence is shaken
To the very core
Altered I stand
With all the answers gone
Your reaction is my illumination
To find serenity

[Chorus:]
Insomnia takes its toll
Don't let me fade anymore

[Solo]

Your reaction is my illumination
I'll find serenity

[Chorus:]
Insomnia takes its toll
Don't let me fade anymore

[Chorus:]
Insomnia takes its toll
Don't let me fade anymore
Don't let me fade anymore
