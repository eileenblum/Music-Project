Silhouettes on the hills
And plains are closing in
As I try to escape
Enemies are looking to wipe me out
Hunted down for what I believe
For what I said
Now my fate seems sealed
They thought I'd never speak
But I am not a slave
And I will never ever swallow their lies
Fortified

A cover up
Ancient secrets
Well preserved
Shackling oppression
I hold the answers in my head
By any means
They will stay in control
An utopia for the chosen elite
I never will conform
Cause I am not a slave
I am a warrior and ready to die
To bring 'em down

[Chorus:]
Painted black by the guardians
My verdict has arrived
I follow my calling
The voice that beckons me

My legacy is rebellious chaos
A seed of hope is growing
As my final dusk ends in blood
By any means
They will stay in control
An utopia for the chosen elite
I will not die in vein
The impact that I've made
Is everlasting for the ones who rebels
Fortified!

[Chorus:]
Painted black by the guardians
My verdict has arrived
I follow my calling
The voice that beckons me
