Standing by the edge of perfection
Prepared to leap for independence
Staring at the walls of redemption
Chased by the values
Defined by your soul

Struggling to achieve
Self-proclaimed believes
Of that which seems to be
Of value to me
Howling in despair
Deceived by greed
Reaching for goals
That can never be reached

Infected ambitions
Impossible is nothing

[Chorus:]
Don't... give... up
One step closer
Stand... your... ground
Yet too far away

[Chorus:]
Don't... give... up
One step closer
Stand... your... ground
Yet too far away

What is of purpose
What are my needs?
Consuming ideals
Swallowed by society
You always seem to fail
Where others succeed
Yet still you keep on trying
Sweet irony

[Solo]

Infected ambitions
Impossible is nothing

[Chorus:]
Don't... give... up
One step closer
Stand (stand)... your... ground
Yet too far away

[Chorus:]
Don't (don't)... give... up
One step closer
Stand... your... ground
Yet too far away
