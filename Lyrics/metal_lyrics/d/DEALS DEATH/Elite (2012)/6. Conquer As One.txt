I walk alone
Deprived of everything
We must shut him up they said
But I am back again
To spread the word
To unfold the truth
I will stop their visions
From infecting the world
Their reign must fall
Once and for all

My soul is calling
My body telling me to act
This age-old reverence
Must be stopped
Or the world will soon be lost
The error of our ways
Will manifest
Beyond our imagination
I'm prepared
I'm the last one to yield

[Chorus:]
Free yourself from their claws
And find out what is real
The solution lies within
The power is yours

Conquer as one

Filthy in the eyes of the pure
Who spreads their message
Through lies and war
Blackest of the black
In a golden sack
Despite the risk
Despite the pain
Despite what happens to me
I'll find a way
From which I'll never stray
And I'll conquer today

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Free yourself from their claws
And find out what is real
The solution lies within
The power is yours
(The power is yours)

[Chorus:]
Free yourself from their claws
And find out what is real
The solution lies within
The power is yours, conquerors
