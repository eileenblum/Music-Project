at deaths door, cards are dealt--take my hand, come this way--time to take my life, self-inflicted death--the doctor is in, heal
me help me die--have the right, to take life--no more faith, end this pain-- this angel for some, for those in great pain--this
monster to all, your god is man made--no more of shame, to set me free--thank you for jack, life is now passed--have the right,
to take life--no more faith, end this pain.
