so many rules, to this twisted sick game--stalking my prey, leaving them dead--fate worse than death, extreme fatal damage--dead
to the world, i will kill you--never kill those you know, never have a motive--never follow patterns, never keep your
weapon--never leave out traces, never save the victim--never hide the body, just flush them down a hole--armed to the teeth,
waiting for the chosen-- ready to kill, you're the one.
