stalking victims for his game--kidnapped, fragile, feminine prey--Bundy's instinct, ways to play--to the forest to be
slayed--strapped to a tree, scream--right before you, rape--forced to watch me kill--now you are next, die--no one hears you,
screaming help--between her thighs, forced inside--terror flows thick through his veins--reaching for his killing blade--strapped
to a tree, scream--right before you, rape--forced to watch me kill--now you are next die--your flesh i crave, your blood i
quench--will fix my greed, my lust for you--and all your screams--these gifts you have, are all i need--stalking victims for his
game--kidnapped, fragile, feminine prey--Bundy's instinct, ways to play--to the forest to be slayed.
