advocate, vanity--lord of lies, sell your soul--devils own, play this game--currency, paid in flesh--laughing hard, no
regret--born of sin, its too late--repent, suffer , power, stolen--morals, no forgiveness-- where is god, Satan's wrath-- trust
me now, learn your fate--you've been warned, now you'll pay--fallen path, see the light--to survive, you must wait--serve your
lord, die in vein--blind to see human greed--repent, suffer, power, stolen--morals, no forgiveness.
