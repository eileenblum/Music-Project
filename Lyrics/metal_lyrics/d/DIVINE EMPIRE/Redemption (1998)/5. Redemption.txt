Ive seen things that would make your blood run cold--a raging vigilante brings forth terror--reborn soldier, controlled
operation--combat ready, blood cold, for protection--armed and hostile, life or death, confrontation--motive lethal, kill you,
for redemption--two hundred dead one thousand wounded--more lambs to the slaughter, human carnage--squeezing off rounds at
someone with hatred--his head blown off for threatening your life--black hills, red skies, conflict, warfare tactics--increase
driven hunger, joining forces--chaos, noble hunter, indignation--justice, anger, menace, infiltration--reborn, soldier,
controlled, operation--combat ready, blood cold, for protection--armed and hostile, life or death, confrontation-- motive lethal,
kill you, for redemption--more lambs to the slaughter, human carnage--things that would make your blood run cold.
