sanctuary is his goal--to the devil sold his soul--resurrection this damn curse--everything gets worse--cold air rushes through
the air--what you've become is not fair--devastation all you see--dark reality--in this hell where you live--nothing more has to
give--warning to his enemies--i will make you bleed--get his pound of flesh--revenge in his eyes--body laid to rest--burned and
torched to death--aura of their sin--vengeance will begin--penance will be served--get what you deserve.
