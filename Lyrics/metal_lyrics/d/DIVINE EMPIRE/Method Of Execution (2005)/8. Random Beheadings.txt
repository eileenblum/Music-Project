Punished, broken into pieces
Process, no bond for my release
Mental anguish, give me freedom
Walk a straight line, doing hard time
Fall down, locked up, pending trial
Waiting verdict, judgement final
Bounty, county, jurisdiction
Inmate, status of conviction
Violation of probation
Charges result in confinement
Tension, grieving for my life back
Lockdown, survive these conditions
Headcount, defend prosecution
Fear my sentence, beg repentance
Back to this hell
Why must I pay severely for my errors
Behind this cage
Can't hear me screaming for someone to free me
Price I must pay for this pain
I do not deserve this treatment
Rule of the law, crime does pay
Without it you would not get paid
Punishment, broken into pieces
Process, no bond for my release
Metal anguish, give me freedom
Walk a straight line, doing hard time
