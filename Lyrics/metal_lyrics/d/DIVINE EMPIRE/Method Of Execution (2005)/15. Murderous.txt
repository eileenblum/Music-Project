Streets of disease, endless crime
Planning heinous deeds, your life denied
Stained in bloodshed, born on this hell
Murder frenzy, watching me kill
Lies and deceit, fatal are your ways
World of demise, morals begin to fade
You are the disease, I am the cure
Remnants of decay, hatred so fucking pure
Every last minute. Killing to tame
By day or night, death becomes your gain
I was born to commit murder
Taking your life is my pleasure
Homicidal thoughts pushed further
Increasing of this killing measure
Birth of terror, unleashed across the land
For your god you pray, victim of those called man
Streets of disease, endless crime
Planning heinous deeds, your life denied
I was born to commit murder
Taking your life is my pleasure
Homicidal thoughts pushed further
Increasing of this killing measure
