Incision, precision
Laceration scars
Bleeding, defeating
Present state of war
Condition, prediction
One shot at glory
Ravage and pillage
End in purgatory
Sent to kill, born to die
Hunting for freedom
This your war, not my war
Will create treason
Must obey, governed slave
Weakness born through strength
Grieving, deceiving
To live and die in vain
Invasion, domination
Prisoner of war
Casualty, fatality
Conquering your land
Sent to kill, born to doe
Hunting for freedom
This you war, not my war
Will create treason
Must obey, governed slave
Weakness born through strength
Grieving, deceiving
To live and die in vain
Born to kill
Incision, precision
Weakness born through strength
Bleeding, defeating
To live and die in vain
