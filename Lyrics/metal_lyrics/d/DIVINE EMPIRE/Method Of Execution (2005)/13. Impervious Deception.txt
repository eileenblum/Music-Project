Before me you tremble. Fear is now what you owe me
Your flesh will not have a chance. Because I have no pity
Never sage from my wrath. Forever haunting your dreams
Must kill
Watching a predator stalking his way through life
Blood spilled
Shattered your sense of guilt, living with no regrets
With skill
Masking of sanity will hide reality
Dominating my victim
Dead cold
Torture and decadence, murder seduces me
Dark soul
Suffering images burning into your mind
Foretold
Anguished mentality causes your agony
Deceive manipulation
Here I am the dragon
All you mean to me, nothing
Beckon your becoming
Approbate yourself to me
Bring forth the sacrifice
Through your open wounds, I bleed
Blood skies
Relentless pursuing the darkness beyond
I rise
Enter my world of unspeakable pain
You die
Forever trapped in his demon abode
Dark desires my take my soul
Man beast
Vile intentions creates your tormented fate
Blood feast
Cursing the god of this unwanted suffering
Deceased
Keeper of horror will take your last breath
Sadistic world with acts of death and murder
