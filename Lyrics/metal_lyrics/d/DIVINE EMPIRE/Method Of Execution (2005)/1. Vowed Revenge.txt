Assassination has begun
Repercussions spare no one
Generated rage inside
There's no way for them to hide
Prepare for annihilation
Brace yourself for execution
Vowed revenge is our reprisal
No last chances for survival
Lethal response rival calling
Denounced bastards die you cowards
There is no way to escape
Punished for your actions, no more chances,
We will overthrow
There is no way to survive
Systematic ways to die
Hunted down and slaughtered like a pig
Is how I'll take your life
Systematic genocide
Systematic ways to die
Hunted down and slaughtered like a pig
Is how I'll take your life
Systematic genocide
Aftermath of the attacks
Reawakened nightmares told
Still afraid we must be brave
Those accused will not be saved
Prepare for annihilation
Brace yourself for execution
Vowed revenge is our reprisal
No last chances for survival
Lethal response rival calling
Denounced bastards die you cowards
Vowed revenge
