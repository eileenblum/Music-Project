Your taken without warning
I will save you from your misery
Your existence is pathetic
I will make you fucking bleed
One more word will make me lose it
Piss me off again and you will see
Pressing firmly for incision
Stabbing twist confirms your death
Choking on your last breath
Body numb, left for dead
Long blade slices deep
Confirmed killing spree
Captured my verdict pleads
Sentencing death penalty
Denied rise of hate
Kept alive I escape
I condemn these man-made killers
Pleading guilty for this murdering
Armed with terror reinstated
Sanctioned judgement to kill me
Try to run from this conviction
Lethal shots are fired rapidly
Go down in a blaze of glory
Persecuted finally
Incarceration
Burning for genocide
Lethal injection
It's time for me to die
My execution
Will take me straight to hell
System of murder
I am just like you
Your death feeds my pain
Next in line to bleed
