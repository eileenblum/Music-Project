Overload of arrogance, swelling of your head
Think you're a gift of god, you will be when you're dead
I have come to bury you alive
Kill the king
No escape, your throne has been denied
Annihilate the king
Murder in my eyes, its time for you to die
Fighting to the death, your crown will now be mine
Just another cliche, over-rated trash
Your throne is self-proclaimed, these dreams I will smash
I have come to bury you alive
Kill the king
No escape, your throne has been denied
Annihilate the king
Ripped away the egos of your mind
Kill the king
Final penetration, unleashing the attack
Aftermath of battle, your worst nightmare becomes fact
Written in your blood, from his there's no escape
Force you to surrender, my vengeance filled with hate
Legion slaughtered, kingdom conquered
Termination, destroy your nation
Final penetration, unleashing the attack
Aftermath of battle, your worst nightmare becomes fact
Written in your blood, from his there's no escape
Force you to surrender, my vengeance filled with hate
I have come to bury you alive
Kill the king
No escape, you throne has been denied
Annihilate the king
