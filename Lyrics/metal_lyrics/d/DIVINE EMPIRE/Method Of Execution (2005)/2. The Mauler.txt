Foaming at the mouth, deranged and rabid
Possessed by evil, unquenching thirst for blood
Chased down and hunted, with nowhere to escape
Your scent has been detected, there's no way to be saved
Ripping and tearing, gashing and shredding
Pleading and screaming, you beg for mercy
Clawing and feasting, growling and barking
Weeping and bleeding, you fight for your life
Creature built to kill, gun powder in his veins
Abused by his master, taking his revenge
Teeth are sinking in, blood is everywhere
Feasting on your limbs, this is no nightmare
Ripping and tearing, gashing and shredding
Pleading and screaming, you beg for mercy
Clawing and feasting, crawling and barking
Weeping and bleeding, you fight for your life
When you least expect it, coming out of nowhere
Best of the devil, you don't know what hit you
Don't try to run, you you cannot hide
Time has come for you, pray that you don't die
Fighting for your life, holes are everywhere
Choking on your blood, gasping for your air
Your life flashes by, know you could be dead
Don't think for one minute, that you will spared
Foaming at the mouth, deranged and rabid
Possessed by evil, unquenching thirst for blood
Chased down and hunted, with nowhere to escape
Your scent has been detected, there's no way to be saved
Ripping and tearing, gashing and shredding
Pleading and screaming, you beg for mercy
Clawing and feasting, growling and barking
Weeping and bleeding, you fight for your life
