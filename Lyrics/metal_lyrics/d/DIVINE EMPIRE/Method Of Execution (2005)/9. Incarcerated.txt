House of execution, rise
Hosted by the warden
Residents of death row
Condemned by conviction
Governor plays god
Prisoner the victim
Strapped down to the gurney tight
Where your death is certain
Eyeballs leave their sockets
And your brain begins to fry
Teeth begin to shatter
Witnesses will watch you die
Chamber built for governed death
Dead man walkings worst fear
Sanctioned do not kill me
What gives you the right
To take away my life
Legs begin to go numb
As the current starts to flow
Pull down for connection
Minutes later you are gone
Up for committing murder
Penalties extreme
This chilling process
Applied frequently
Just like a mother
Watching her only son
Being executed
Your time has come
