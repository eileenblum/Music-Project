Put to death, for your crimes
One last breath, say goodbye
Time to die
Try to fight out of spite
Taste the blood, here it comes
Try to run, try to hide
Can't escape, your own fate
Must obey, governed slave
Hatred grows, indisposed
Kill the tame, death for gain
Try to plead, now you bleed
Terror zone
Take you down, you will see
How to pay for your deeds
Killing time
Your last rites will be told
Spare no flesh, gun will hold
Trigger pulled, rapid flow
Born of hell, watch me kill
Endless crime, life denied
Cruor pours, gun hole sores
Filled with lead, now your dead
Life deceased, rest in peace
Terror zone
Hood on head, tied back
Progress moves forward
Shot to death by execution style murder
In the line of fire, commanded killing
Slayed and sprayed
By ongoing penetration
Must obey, governed slave
Hatred grows, indisposed
Kill the tame, death for gain
Try to plead, now you bleed
Terror zone
