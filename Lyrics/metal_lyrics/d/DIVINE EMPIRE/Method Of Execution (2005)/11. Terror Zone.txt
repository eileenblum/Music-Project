Draw the needle closer, Headed to your vein
Lethal close of murder. Life now slips away
Forcing the injection. Enter liquid death
Fluids of transfucion. Induce your last breath

[Chorus:]
Live in fear, raping your will to live
No rights, punished for all your sins
Pray for death. Dying will set you free
Your pain. Blinded by tragedy
Paralyzed infection. Living on death row
Take anticipation. Let the poison flow
You will now be punished
For the crimes you made
Victory for victims. Guilty for your ways
Sanctioned homicide. begin to execute
Judge the guilty. Sentence you to your death
Strapped to the gurney
Terror of your worse nightmare
Lethal injection
Now complete, your defeat
Legal procedure
Dosage is intravenous
Purging syringes
Remedy, casualty

[Chorus]

Nothing left to do now
Vital signs will fade
Terrifying anguish
Now its time to pay
Forcing the injection
Enter liquid death
Fluids of transfusion
Induce your last breath
