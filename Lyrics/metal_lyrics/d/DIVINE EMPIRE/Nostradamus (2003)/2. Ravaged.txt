Gas fume vapors, infest the air so thick
One match now stricken,
this game will now begin
Flames of combustion
Spreading through your lungs
Spastic reaction, blistered
black your tongue.
Hair evaporates your skin
begins to melt
Inhale to scream, can't rid
this pain your dealt

Ravaged. Carbon released
Ravaged, your life deceased

Boiling point of your blood, see the death toll rise
Human wall of flames, no one will survive

Engraving flesh with flame. leaving his mark
Evidence left to burn, blackened at heart

Ravaged, serial killer
Ravaged, pleased by life he took
