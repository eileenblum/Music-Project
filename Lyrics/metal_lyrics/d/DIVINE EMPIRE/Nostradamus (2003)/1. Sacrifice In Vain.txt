Trained, from birth how to kill
Suicide campaign
Brainwashed to believe.

MARTYR

Blood, shed from years of war
Clamor for revenge
Human killing machines

MARTYR

Pray, to a deity you've been told
Raging your war hymns
Victims once again

MARTYR

SACRIFICE, IN VAIN
SACRIFICE, IN VAIN

Souls, many laid to rest
Now your time has come
You're the chosen one

MARTYR
