Slice of the blade, penetrate the flesh
Form pools of blood, your head I crush
With broken glass, in cruor you are blessed
Scream like a bitch, into your face my fist!

Your turn to pray, time to feel karma
Violent wrath, persecution drama
Enter my world, one thing you will regret
Mutilation, the concrete you have met

The nightmare has begun
charges have been pressed
I plead not guilty, no bond for my arrest
To many options, so very little time
Time served, I've paid for this crime.

Aggravated battery
You begin to bleed
Aggravated battery
Growing hate filled seed
Aggravated battery Time to feel pain
Aggravated battery I'm the one insane
