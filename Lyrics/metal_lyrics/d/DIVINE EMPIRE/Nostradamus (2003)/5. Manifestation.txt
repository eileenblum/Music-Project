Verge of destruction, past life a mess
Domesticated, father knows best
Schizophrenic, self centered freak
Won't see it coming, soul filled with hate

Haunted possession,
axe in your hand
Eyes filled with blood, psychotic acts
Hair trigger temper,
deranged and mad
Submerge in darkness,
coming your way

Day of reckoning, want to be the
thing inside you will unleash
Voices in your head they command
Carry out these dreadful plans

Awaiting the day in disarray
Stalking his prey, those he betrayed
Building inside, terror will hide
When it's released, horror will feast

Blood will flow, rage the beast
Hunt for you, life will cease
