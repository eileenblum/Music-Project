Distress inflicted upon, affliction and suffering

Sacrifice, death overthrown
Offer your life, pain is thy home
Bleed for me, I'll die for you
Tribulation of the one cursed by doom
Torment one way to survive
Only the strong will remain

Overcome, the wicked shall
fall, guided by forces unknown

Frozen terror inside your eyes
Look in the mirror see your despise

Heresy, abundant loss, dwell
and beware the path you cross

Paradise thrown to the ground
For disaster, where your life is bound
Victory, domination, last one to stand
Will rule tribulation

Distress, inflicted upon, affliction and suffering
Crisis, close to death
Defeat conscious sin
