Stabbed into the back
Your kind you betray
Lie into my face
False are the words you say

Last chance your offer
Grab the cash and run
Grand theft committed
Worse form of a con
The path you leave behind
With the damage done
Live a life of crime
You're the guilty one

Traidor
Cuidate del traidor
Traidor
Cuidate del traidor

Your small mind altered
By the drugs you take
Convinced of your own lies
You've become a fake
Take what is not yours
Back into hiding
Your acts are corrupt
Far from law abiding

Traidor
Cuidate del traidor
Traidor
Cuidate del traidor
