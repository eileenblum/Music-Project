Mass destruction, cities fall
The end is near, for life you crawl
Sirens holler, nowhere to run
Earthquakes shatter, disaster done

Volcanic eruptions, the death
toll will rise
Natural disaster, hear
tormented cries

Burning in fire, lungs explode
Not prepared to die
These events have been foretold
The world now gone, your life consumed

Tidal waves smother, engulfed in endless storm
Hurricanes swarming,
prophets predictions born
Un-fold the end of time, last
day of human kind

Collide with fear, demolished
state, Now forsaken your destined fate
Ten billion dead, crippling plague
No survivors, your life slips away.
