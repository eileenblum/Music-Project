I see the faces and the shadows of dark
I hear the voices as they scream for god

See your world through the camera's eye
Brainwashed society force fed lies
Root of the problem must not be denied
Propaganda and corporate ties
Government conspiracies conflicts arise
Speak of the truth if you have nothing to hide

[Chorus 1]
I feel the pain of billions in my heart
Souls bleeding hate breeding
I see the faces and the shadows of dark
Souls bleeding, hate breeding
I hear the voices as they scream for god
Souls bleeding, hate breeding
Souls bleeding, hate breeding

[Chorus 2]
Exaggeration, propaganda, corporation lies
Competition, entertainment, media glorifies
Opinionated, mass paraded, satan in disguise
The root of the problem must not be denied (2x)

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
The root of the problem must not be denied
Will not be denied
Must not be denied
Will not, must not be denied
