Shackled, taken from my home
By force, freedom now is gone
Victim, convict on the run
Punished for what you did wrong

Laws were made to be broken
Take my life and make it worse
Pay the price for all you've done
Fuck the system, fuck this curse

Warrant out for your arrest
Guilty tile proved innocent
Imprisoned, technically
Taken to a place not free

Mandatory punishment
Going by the book
This god fearing government
Labels me a crook

Mandatory punishment
Mandatory punishment
Stripped of all humanity
The light of day, you'll never see

Injustice has taken my pride away from me
Imprisoned my freedom, made my life agony
Senseless frustration fills me with bitterness
My hatred grows stronger, must prove my innocence

Desperate, life a living hell
No hope, confined to this cell
Morals, here they don't exist
Punished for your ignorance
