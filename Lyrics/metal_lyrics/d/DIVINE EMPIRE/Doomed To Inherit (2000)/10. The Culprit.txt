You call me your friend
You're nothing but a rat
Constantly trying
To stab me in the back

The words that you speak
Are so filled with shit
What comes from your mouth
Means nothing to me

Lies on top of lies
I can see it in your eyes
For your actions speak the truth
A blessing in disguise
When I finally realize
You're a snake without a clue

Talk behind my back
Afraid to show your face
All that you have left
Is a trail of disgrace

Time is running short
End is growing near
Continue running
Scared to face your fears

Lies on top of lies
I can see it in your eyes
For your actions speak the truth
A blessing in disguise
When I finally realize
You're a snake without a clue
Lies on top of lies
I can see it in your eyes
All your friends you try to fool
Hide behind the mask
Cause you're no fucking class
All your friend you try to fool
