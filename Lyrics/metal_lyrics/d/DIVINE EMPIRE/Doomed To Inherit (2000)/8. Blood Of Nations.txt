I am what you fear, your soul I hold for ransom
Return to claim what is ours, reasons we are driven

Strong in frame of mind, sins are unforgiven
Predator of vengeance, victims of demise
Put to the test, prove you have no fear
I have returned, time to make a stand

I come from a dying breed, conquer, survive, feel the need
Outlive all those who have tried, my blood thickens, we will rise

Paid are my dues, here to claim reward
Your loss my gain, watch as I grow strong
Can't stop us now, this force was meant to be
Surge through my veins, blood of nations

Killing machines we are, all the rules have been changed
Take down those who oppose, you will not live to see
You will not live to see, will not live to see

Strong in frame of mind, sins are unforgotten
Predator of vengeance, victims of demise
Put to the test, prove you have no fear
I have returned, time to make a stand

Killing machines we are, all the rules have been changed
Take down those who oppose, you will not live to see
You will not live to see, will not live to see
