Worshipped and praised, with constant suffering
Put to death for a cause or belief
Bow down to me, now you're just a memory

Your soul now cast, finally forgotten
Betrayed by trust, faith becomes despise
It took all means to hear my existence
Known from the past, futile is resistance

Abuse my pride, legend in your own mind
Prophet of doom, your life is out of time
No one survives, witness to my demise

Idolatry, brainwashes you to be
Supreme being, love hate excessively
Deity acts, ceremonial birth
Religious rites, performed to make you burn
