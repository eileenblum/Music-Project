Beauty you are not
Just too blind to see
Born atrocity
Trying to fit in
Purchasing your friends
Never to be free

You can't be saved

Can't go on this way
Blessing in disguise
No one hears your cries
Banished from mankind
Know your life is bound
Cast down to the ground

This is your hell

You will never see
Things are often dream
You pretend to be
Sub Humanity

Making endless lies
Your ways waste in time
Mindless fantasy
Keeps you entertained
Label those you don't know
Jealous of their ways
Inside you're afraid
To step up to the plate

Thou shall not judge

Beauty you are not
Just too blind to see
Born atrocity
Trying to fit in
Purchasing your friends
Never to be free
