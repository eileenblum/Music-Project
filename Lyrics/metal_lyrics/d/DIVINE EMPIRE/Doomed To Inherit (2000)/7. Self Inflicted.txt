Subconscious realization of your aberration
Indifference decreases your sense of morality
Respect is something that you have now forgotten
Your life has been served to you on a silver platter

Self-inflicted abuse, made pathetic loser
King of something you're not

Physical weakness is your downfall to exist
Taking and not giving back, lack of respect
No struggle for everything is done for you
awaken to realize you're going nowhere
