Loss of all control
Your next move is waiting
Planning your attack
Life is so degrading
Needless to be sane
You won't see it coming
Get down on your knees
Hands tied behind your back

Stalking, tyrant, hunter, killing
Victim, widowed, hostage, murder suicide

Unsheathed is your gun
Judgment is forthcoming
Time to take a life
Bodies scatter running
Take down those you hate
Sealed now is your fate
Victims of demise
It's you that I despise

Treaty, broken, shattered, combat,
showdown, bullets, terror, murder suicide

Loss of all control
Your next move is waiting
Get down on your knees
Hands tied behind your back

Stalking, tyrant, hunter,
showdown, murder suicide
