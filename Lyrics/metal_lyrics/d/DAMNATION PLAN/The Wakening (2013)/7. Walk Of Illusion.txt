world's growing dead to me now
I have got to be strong
ever searching for the answers
ever searching for the way
searching, breathing
burning bridges behind
having a chokehold on me
I have to find a way
or there'll be nothing around me
nothing left to burn
no more bridges to burn
I've been walking this earth
long enough to see
what it's come to be
it's no more an illusion - to me
self-righteous bastards surrounding me
I have to find my way
I have to prove them wrong
or it will all be gone
searching, breathing
burning bridges behind
having a chokehold on me
I have to find a way
or there'll be nothing around me
nothing left to burn
no more bridges to burn
realizing the need
to step up, make a difference
forced to face the truth
it's no more an illusion - to me
still walking this earth
had enough to see
what it's come to be
it's no more an illusion - to me
