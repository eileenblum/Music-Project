ghosts of my memory
ever haunting me
since I lost it all
what I have been fighting for
burning, my life's victories are burning
too late for re-learning
all shattered in pieces inside
I reach to the crimson sky
and in a fraction of time
everything can be taken away
shattered in pieces inside
I reach to the crimson sky
life's brutality keeps reminding me
of these distant scenes from memory
ever bringing me this agony
still I can't let it go for real
dwelling there, somewhere in between
even though there's nothing left to be seen
been through this a million times before
if only I could erase it all
dark clouds have gathered around
- as I reach to the crimson sky
could I've done anything differently?
and I know the answer is no
what am I still fighting for?
I am to face this death alone
the crimson is here
the crimson is finally here
undeliverance
of all the things I've kept of worth
life's too short to figure this out -
denial was never built in me
dark clouds have gathered around
final gaze to the crimson sky
it is a lesson we cannot learn until we've made it all through
how can I ever risk this again?
this life will never be the same
and as this time freezes
the dark clouds have gathered around
the moment of realization
I am to face this death alone
