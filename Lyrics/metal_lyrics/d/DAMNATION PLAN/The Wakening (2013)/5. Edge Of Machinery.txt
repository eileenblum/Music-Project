no one to hide from
nothing left to live for
not far from now
our souls will be forced to resignate
living off the radar
living off the radar of machinery
there'll be no savior
for the ones standing in line
it was supposed to be forever
there was nothing we could not hide
not a thing to last forever
our lives are fading away
in between the lies and hatred
they took our rights to pave their ways
no one has witnessed with their eyes
this hidden betrayal in disguise
no one to save us now
no one who stands by our side
as it finally came to our realization
came all too late to tear it down
too late to tear it down
too late to turn it down
late to tear it down -
too late to turn it down
no salvation for standing in line
too late to wait forever
your fates will be decided for you
not a thing will live forever
even this empire will fall
right now!
no salvation for standing in line
