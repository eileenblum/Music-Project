come the wakening
sudden rise of awareness comes by
it's set up and all written in the sky
come the wakening
sudden rise of awareness comes by
come the wakening
too late to open shut eyes
watching our lives fade away
chaotic disruption
lives lived without cause
disregarded lives forgotten
ways of civilizations
coordinated mass deceptions
forsaken - innocence faked
awaken - eternal sleep
all the signs we were given
to finally change the course
false judgment prevails
as the weakness grows in us all
come the wakening
yet to the very end
we believe we can wait forever
what lies beneath the corruption's
layers of lies hiding the truth?
an innocent man closes his eyes
- the silent blessing for the evil
shoot the messenger
spreading the information
provoked thinking - the enemy of the state
join the gray mass, focus on the entertainment
as long as it's not your life that's on the line
innocent bystanders
let the evil reign
come the wakening
we can only wake the sleeping
