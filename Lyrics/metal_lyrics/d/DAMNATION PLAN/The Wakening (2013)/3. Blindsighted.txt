I don't care what you want me to be
I wouldn't change myself
to fit your fantasy
to become one of you
shadows of my past
have made me ME - can't you see?
you've yet to prove yourself!
looking for some recognition
with your washed-out ideal?
it's all the same what I say to you
still I can't make you see
just keep on living as you've been told
among those of your kind
the way it's meant for you
in your washed-out ideal
life is burning at both ends
still you cannot grasp reality - reality
after all your mistakes made
still you cannot see what you've come to be
so you came here to prove yourself
declaring you've got something to say
blistering blindsights on me
expecting me to kneel?
you thought you could possibly change me?
talk without sense or reasoning
blindfolded speech of your kind
the path you've chosen yourself
led by the blind through all your life
custom-tailored just for you
a disfigured mind of fool
you'll get your recognition!
shadows of my past
have made me ME - can't you see?
you've yet to prove yourself!
you've yet to prove yourself!
