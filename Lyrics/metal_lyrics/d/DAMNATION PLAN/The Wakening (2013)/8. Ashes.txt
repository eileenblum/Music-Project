where's the world's sanity?
burning ashes of me
washing down to the sea
drifting ways part from me
as I'm set to be freed
these burning ashes of me
are washing down to the sea
and setting me to be free
finally setting me free
these burning ashes of me
are washing down to the sea
and drifting ways part from me
these burning ashes of me
they bid me farewell through my soul's eyes
these burning ashes of me
washing down to the sea
and drifting ways part from me
I always lived to be free
yet these burning ashes of me
are the ones releasing me
and setting me to be free
finally setting me free
these burning ashes of me
are washing down to the sea
and setting me to be free
where's the world's sanity?
burning ashes of me
washing down to the sea
drifting ways part from me
as they're setting me free
finally free
they're setting me free
setting me free
