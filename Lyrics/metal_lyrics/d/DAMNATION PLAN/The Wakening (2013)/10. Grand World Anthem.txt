our lives in this world
have been accounted for
once dragged to the cold, real world
living now on the edge of it all
this life - the resistance
rising up towards the system's
blindsighted rules we follow
one-sided views we hallow
controlled fear with greed - the fragile existence of fear
what have we come to?
living this life still without a clue
wish it was untrue
we are just racing towards our own doom
when will this empire fall?
- bring forth the new beginning!
nothing exhausts the monetary system's greed
depriving the other in order to overspill
watch the vortex wipe away the doomed
while you stand on the other side
waiting for your own judgment call
controlled fear with greed - the fragile existence of fear
the world untrue
manipulated by its masters' fools
the world is untrue
manipulated by its masters' fools
without a clue
people descend from a different truth
the world untrue
manipulated by its masters' fools
world untrue
