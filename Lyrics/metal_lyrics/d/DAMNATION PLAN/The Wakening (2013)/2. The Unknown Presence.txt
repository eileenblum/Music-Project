have I sometime been here?
I can't say if this is real
what is this place that we are in?
how did I end up here?
I've lived with myself
facing states of the unreal
trapped inside my body
waiting for something to set me free
- set me free
I'm trapped inside of this
paralyzed state I feel
it's come to tear my world down
no one to set me free
I am still waiting
this nightmare to be real
I am still waiting
still trapped inside of this
unknown state of fear
I can not hide
with this constant fear
I feel, I breathe, I live my life every day
I'm losing every way
living this life surreal
there's no soul in this room
yet I know it's right here
I feel its presence so near me again
waiting - my mind to set me free
I am still waiting
this nightmare to be real
I am still waiting
is this the reality?
or am I losing my sanity?
how have I ended up here?
still waiting...
still waiting...
for something to set me freeset me free
catatonic dreamlike projection
lone witness of the scene
breathing and following action
only my body stays still
I've come to terms with it
that with this disbelief
I can't face it for real
I'm never meant to be freed
there's no soul in this room
yet I know it's right here
I feel its presence so near me again
is this the reality?
or am I losing my sanity?
the familiar signs within
wake me up to this surreal
frozen inside I'm just waiting
still trapped inside of this paralyzed state I feel
what is the reality that we all live in?
