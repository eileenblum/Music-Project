free yourselves
nothing can break us now
within ourselves
nothing can break us now
and all the obstruction that we face
adds another dimension
step up and face the enemy
scorching free, holding back your intentions
and all the lies we've been force-fed
will be shown in a new light
our lives ruled by their stone cold hearts
all coming down to an end
reason for all of the pain we feel
is just to make us see?
open your eyes to see
what you've done to yourself
still looking over to the others' direction?
choosing them over yourself?
and all the obstruction that we face
adds the other dimension
the time is now - what are you waiting for?!
who says we can't decide our own fate?
free yourselves
nothing can break us now
within ourselves
deep down lies the answer
