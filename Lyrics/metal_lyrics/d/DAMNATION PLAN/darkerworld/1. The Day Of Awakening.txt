what is the reason why
it had to come this far?
what is the reason why
you have crossed the line
in the other side

was it reality
that made you feel so faint?
was it reality
that made you turn against
all the good surrounding you?

everything you've felt
has made your way
all that you've ever faced
have led to this day

[Chorus:]
come and tear us apart
you bastard!
whatâs the price of your soul?
burns too deep in heart of cold
no one makes on its own

what have you gained so far?
nothing but devastation
what have you ever done to
gain the trust of the ones
that have brought you this far?

life outside reality
your deluded immortality
trying to prove you're a god?
the side you hid so long
has seen the light of day

everything you've felt
has made your way
all that you've ever faced
have led to this day

[Chorus]

trying to bring it back
what there used to be
trust on the only fact
there's no one to cover your back

the awakening
comes the day
when you realize your own mortality
you will lose
your soul
at the end of your awakening day

[Chorus]
