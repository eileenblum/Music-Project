in your eyes I see greed
taking their lives to fill our needs
watch their extinction in heat
loosing their own will to live

once may come the day
when we all walk the same path to misery
and watch as we bleed
for the ones that we did not breed

[Chorus:]
world of insanity
ruled sadistically
what's the cost of it?
who will pay for it?

All we've done
comes back to me as a flashback now
In our dream
this was foreseen

live your life as you will
drain your full cup to refill
afraid to widen your view?
what all might it reveal?

All we've done
comes back to me as a flashback now

[Chorus]

they will burn for our sake

within your own mind
you shall make your peace
to live, to kill
you have made your choice

within your own heart
you will repent your choice
to live, to kill
you can't revert your own choice

all their dreams
turn to dust through our needs

[Chorus]

they will burn for our sake
as theyâll burn for our sake
