(courage to be) i could only hope to posses strength a strength as great and pure as yours.
while pitted face to face courage exudes while you ignore.
Adversity surrounds you it flows like streams of blood.
Still you rise to meet the day to stop the raging flood.
I admire your persistance as you refused to to die.
As you lay upon the road your head looked towards the sky.
I believe what i see courage from you it gives me strength.
I know what im searching for, courage from you it keeps me pure.
I draw strength from watching you never give up you see it through.
That is how i live my life, courage to be.
Scared, screaming, helpless as i watched over idly.
Blood pumping from the wounds i stared down breathlessly.
Frozen in time in disbelief of what went on.
Hysterical, excitable amidst a sea of calm.
I believe in what i see courage from you it gives me strength.
I know what, im searching for courage from you it keeps me pure.
I draw strength from watching you never give up you see it through.
That is how i live my life, courage to be.
((Sometimes i feel that life is weighing me down and that i cannot go on.
Then i look back and see your smiling face i know my pain is gone.
And when i think of all that you went through the pain, the suffering, the torment,
im filled with pride that you made it through. My life i will not lament.))
Your strength it gives me courage [x2]
