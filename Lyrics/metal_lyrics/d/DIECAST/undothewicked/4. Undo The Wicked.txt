Youll never plague them ever again because their innoncence is their right.
Youve crossed the line into a world of thuggery youll pay the price for your own lack of humanity.
For what youve done your soul ill crush to grains of dust you are devoid of a conscience and you must realize the pain that you have wrought will haunt you til the day you die your soul forever lost.
From now until forever your soul will burn repentence for the damned from now until forever your blood will burn.

A purgatory of darkness where youll 1,000 deaths where youll die in silent agony. Until we meet again.
