(You must unlearn what you have learned)
Your insecurity becomes you seen through a veil of untamed hate.
The compromised morals ill wade through compromising morals of your dreadful mistake.
And how can you hate everybody how can you go through life all alone?
Your racist ways limit your options youre only cheating yourself.
Your benediction of prejudice will only serve your emptiness.
How can you go on that what? Our diversity is a virtue skin color doesnt mean i thing.
We are all created equal, this much youll learn (unlearn your ways its time for change) [x8]
A day to day existence of hatred a bitterness you owe all to yourself.
Solitary solace it suits you a solitary life is no life at all.
As you sit alone in the darkness the walls youve erected will be your tomb.
Alone to rethink your value system, alone for eternity.
Your benediction of prejudice will only serve your emptiness.
How can you go on that way? our diverist is a virtue, skin color doesnt mean a thing.
We are all created equal this much youll learn.
I know that you hate, i know that you can change [x4]
I know that you, i know that you, i know that you can change [x2]
Unlearn your ways, its time for change [x8]
you will unlearn racist ways, you will unlearn time for change. Unlearn your ways!
