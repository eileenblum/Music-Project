I wait confined within the walls of anger waiting to explode bottled up i soon implode.
Suppressing rage eats away dissolving my mind anf its more, more than i can take.
And soon my (rage) ignites soon i will explode (anger) the cause i do not know (my pain) it knows no other wrath (unleashed) stay out of my damage path.
Rising, boiling, boiling, boiling up inside i feel no pity for them they were raised upon lies.
Though cheating force feeding the bow to the alter of a plastic god.
Through cheating lies and corruption comes my agression (rage) ignited soon i will explode (anger) the cause i do not know (my pain) it knows no other wrath (unleashed) stay out of my damage path.
All of you will learn to respect me, never ever will you neglect me.
All of you will learn to respect me, never ever will you neglect me.
I will always hate and despise you, tearing down your thoughts just to spite you.
I will always hate and despise you, tearing down your thoughts.
Get away from me, get away from me (fuck you) all (fuck you) all (fuck you) all.
Your all gonna burn [x4]
Get away from me, get tne fuck away from me you motherfuckers.
(fuck you) all (fuck you) all, your all gonna burn [x4]
