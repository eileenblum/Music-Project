Respect is a virtue that youï¿½ve lacked from day one
And you seem to think that you are the worldï¿½s axis
Donï¿½t you throw rocks if you have a glass complexion
Try to seal the crack that leaked all your common sense
Now youï¿½ve passed the torch or was it too hot to handle
I will pin my stars and Iï¿½ll command the uprising

Stop, look at yourself, the blame should truly rest on no one else
Donï¿½t start to dwell when your soul is just an empty cell

I command what youï¿½ve done but now I take this gift of power and I will flourish
You no longer have a string to dangle, simple threats held overhead are distant memories
As we bid farewell so bonded and united
The machine has been reborn to seize the new horizon

The respect that I held is now all but lost, scorned by jealousy and burning hatred
Itï¿½s not too late to give your hand, itï¿½s not too late to make amends

Drink the blood from my eyes
Drink and swallow your pride
Drink the blood from my eyes
Drink and swallow your pride
