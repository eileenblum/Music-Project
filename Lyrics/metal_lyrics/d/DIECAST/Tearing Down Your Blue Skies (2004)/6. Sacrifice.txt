Tear away from my life force
Torn away from my existence
Take me away from all reason
Tearing away

How does a soul solidify, and create destination
With ecstasy comes agony, how do I find a balance

Must... Must de-... Must decide... Must decide, sacrifice

Emotions set on high, living and dying by the sword
Weight of risk is great, I am ready for the passing
Turn the key, push the gate
Step by step, inch by inch

Now is the time, my day is near
Encompassing my inner fabric
Taking shape, will I approve of my current evolution
It takes two halves to make a whole
How can I be complete if Iï¿½m hollow
I must expand my life, for this I give my sacrifice
Can I travel this path alone... No...

Travel this path alone (this path)

Counting down all my days, until my future does unfold
Will you hold on, on to me, or just let go

Tear away from my life force
Torn away from my existence
Take me away from all reason
Tearing away

Know where my faith exists, undying and forever
Believe the words I script, invest all of your worth
Strengthen your sanity, it will reward in due time
In due time
Why?
