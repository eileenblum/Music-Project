You never understood any given could be your final one
No room for regret, donï¿½t ever forget your being followed by
The swinging pendulum, watch as it grows so close
Fall to the swinging pendulum watch as it grows so close until you are gone

Weï¿½re chased all through time not knowing one day from the next
Numbers coming up, when will you cut the golden thread
Maybe itï¿½s not my time, maybe itï¿½s not your time
But we should live our lives in case thereï¿½s no tomorrow

I wonï¿½t be another statistic, Iï¿½ll be ready for the coming of
The swinging pendulum, watch as it grows so close
Fall to the swinging pendulum watch as it grows so close until you are gone

Days turn into months, turn into years, realize that we cannot live forever [x4]

You never understood any given day, could be your final one
No room for regret, donï¿½t ever forget your being followed by
The swinging pendulum, watch as it grows so close
Fall to the swinging pendulum watch as it grows so close until you are gone

Maybe itï¿½s not my time, maybe itï¿½s not your time
But we should live our lives in case thereï¿½s no tomorrow
Maybe itï¿½s not my time, maybe itï¿½s not your time
But we should live our lives in case thereï¿½s no tomorrow
