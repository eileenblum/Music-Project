Hand are shaking, deny temptation
Bones are shattered, Iï¿½m still standing
Defenses are slowly fading, I wonï¿½t give in to your compromise
Never crumble, no not this time

I am sick of lying to myself, it wonï¿½t always be OK
The hole gets deeper everyday (everyday)
My nails are worn, and fingers bleeding, still I rebury myself
Thinking that there is another way, a better way
Thereï¿½s no way
There is no way
The walls have all decayed, so now I can burrow through and eliminate
One more obstacle
I will shed my skin, leaving me so sanctified so that no force can overcome

Challenged, this is my fight
Battered, I will not break
Beaten, I will seize the day
Again, make no mistakes
The final chapter seems so distant, still I carry on
My old path calls to me but Iï¿½m still unrelenting
With no shame I take aim, this will be my greatest stand

Challenged, this is my fight
Battered, I will not break
Beaten, I will seize the day
Again, make no mistake
