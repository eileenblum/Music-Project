Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Crowded by all that is lost, itï¿½s hard to find positives
Taken by blunt ignorance I give you no forgiveness
Donï¿½t try to block out all the memories, itï¿½s the pain that binds us
All to cause this, we unite to burn the cancer
Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Battle rages day to day, fought by our sons and daughters
All support is fading, it raises speculation
Itï¿½s not just one man, but a fungus that is slowly closing in on the world
Smothering all existence
Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Who decides what is right

Fear is fuel for cowards, throw a match into the fuel
Donï¿½t think that all is lost, read between the burning towers
This hit should make us strong, aggravated by their treachery

No end in sight, blinding, wish I could see the future
Day in day out questioning, what is tomorrow bringing
Though we are withered and beaten we cannot be broken
Fear of your pride, misery is soon upon us
Fire... Damage, who decides what is right
Fear is fuel for cowards, throw a match into the fuel
Donï¿½t think that all is lost, read between the burning towers
This hit should make us strong, aggravated by what itï¿½s coming to...
What it is coming to, everytime you turn the page you can see our world is a disaster
Rage rears its' ugly head in so many different ways
So deafening, our world is a disaster
Lost on a globe of disregard, clinging onto hope
We need to find what really matters
