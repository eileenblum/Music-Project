Traitor, donï¿½t you turn your back on me
Traitor, donï¿½t you walk away from me
I will break you, watch your entire world crumble
I will drop you, watch your entire world fall

Turn your back, look away, lost in false security
I trust you wonï¿½t be so corrupted, though it fluttered in your face
Did you need to steal a taste, Edensï¿½ apple was the last mistake by you
Our bond is all but gone, you canï¿½t replace your dignity
Our bond is all but gone, you escape your treachery

Your betrayal is my disgust, wipe your face my with my trust
You should change your name to Benedict
Close your eyes, hide away, whatever saves you today
Know that you can never escape me

I will have my revenge

You backed yourself in a corner
You tried to steal my self-respect
You backed yourself in a corner
Itï¿½s mine turn take and Iï¿½ll take it

Now you cower, pull away, pining for my sympathy
Face is turning yellow, no remorse for you
Our bond is all but gone, you canï¿½t replace your dignity
Our bind is all but gone, you canï¿½t escape
Traitor, donï¿½t you turn your back on me
Traitor

I will have my revenge

You backed yourself in a corner
You tried to steal my self-respect
You backed yourself in a corner
Itï¿½s mine to take and Iï¿½ll take it back.
