Stop pushing your faith, spreading disease, for it falls on calloused minds and empty stares
Bow to your icon, made from their clay, tainted by the lies and cold hypocrisies
You shun away all their beliefs, yours is the one true answer
Iï¿½d like to take them all and flush them all away
Why canï¿½t you see how blatantly they purify corruption
Just steer away, away from me, donï¿½t you see
Your prayer infuriates my anger, so I will find my savior
Right or wrong, Iï¿½m on my own, I will stand so strong
So strong

Watch your blue skies fall, within morality, believe reality will keep your faith
As long as it pours from your essence
I believe that there is one, but the robe that he wears
Is handmade, and not their polyester fiction
How ignorant are your beliefs, you think that youï¿½re so righteous
Iï¿½d like to take them all and flush them all away
You close your eyes and fold your hands, dropping down on your weakened knees
I turn around so all knowing you wonï¿½t see
Your prayer infuriates my anger, so I will find my savior
Right or wrong, Iï¿½m on my own, I will stand so strong
So strong

Standing strong
Standing strong
Push away, push away as if everyoneï¿½s standing strong
Push away, push away as if everyoneï¿½s standing strong, standing strong, standing strong
Standing strong
Your prayer infuriates my anger, so I will find my savior
Right or wrong, Iï¿½m on my own, I will stand so strong

So strong, standing strong, standing strong, standing strong, standing strong
Push away push away as if everyoneï¿½s standing strong
Push away, push away as if everyoneï¿½s going deaf
