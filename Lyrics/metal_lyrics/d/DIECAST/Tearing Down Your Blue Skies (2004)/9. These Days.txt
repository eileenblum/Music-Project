Come into my own, come into my own

Look inside myself, see the path that Iï¿½ve chosen
Itï¿½s time for me to lose the pain Iï¿½ve found
Hating everyday, never live for the moment
I want to scream until this cell corrodes
And Iï¿½ve thrown it all away, Iï¿½ve thrown it all away, Itï¿½s time for me to take this back myself

These days are all gone, waking to madness, in time to see the only life Iï¿½m living for
These days are all gone, living in the darkness, I walk alone, on my own

Look the other way, never saw the weakness in living life in chains that drag me down
Running through the maze, with no sense of direction, canï¿½t give in until I find a way through
Iï¿½ll take this bullet between the eyes, Iï¿½ll take this, now itï¿½s my time
Iï¿½ll take this bullet between the eyes, Iï¿½ll take this, itï¿½s my time

These days are all gone, waking to the madness, in time to see the only life Iï¿½m living for
These days are all gone, living in the darkness, I walk alone
All alone

Come into my own, come into my own, itï¿½s time for me
These days are all gone, now itï¿½s time to come into my own
These days are all gone, now itï¿½s time to come into my own
