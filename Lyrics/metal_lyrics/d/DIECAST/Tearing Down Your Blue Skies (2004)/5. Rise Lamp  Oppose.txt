Never underestimate your next opponent, it would be dark catastrophe of great proportion
The challenge has begun, when the hammer falls I know that we will all step
Forward, in the light, domination by the masses

Kicking you down, beating you down, we wonï¿½t falter
Beating you down, push you away, they canï¿½t deny our destiny, we wonï¿½t submit
Believe in inner power, David can crush Goliath
Fortify your confidence and your opponent will be living in failure, failure
Failure, failure

Taste the pungent stench abroad, the people scream in horror (hraaa!)
Boomerang effect is in full play, when instead the bullets scream your way
The people all will all applaud, applaud your demise

Bring down the opponent you most fear, you canï¿½t hide the burning
Donï¿½t ever deny the power within, you can defeat all that oppose
Feel my hatred... eyes burning red... radiation.... of our anger... we will flourish
As they fall we will flourish

Rise and Oppose
