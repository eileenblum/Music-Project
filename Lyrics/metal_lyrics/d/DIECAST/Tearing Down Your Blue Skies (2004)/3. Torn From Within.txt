Know, I can see, through your costume
That is concealing all your lies, your disguise
Meant to purify your defecation
You, donï¿½t look at me
You, wonï¿½t look at me
You know that your timeï¿½s forthcoming
You, wonï¿½t look at me
You, donï¿½t look away
When you blink your eyes I will appear

Fist to the face, tell me how does your blood taste
Fist to the face, tell me how do your lies taste
Fist to the face, tell me how does your blood taste
Fist to the fist to the fist to the face

I wonï¿½t describe all the pain that I will bring upon you
Look in my eyes, or did the shame destroy your vision
You, canï¿½t run away
You, wonï¿½t run away
You canï¿½t run away you coward
You, wonï¿½t run away
You, will face up
You will face up when youï¿½re in the ground

Fist to the face, tell me how does your blood taste
Fist to the face, tell me how do your lies taste
Fist to the face, tell me how does your blood taste
Fist to the fist to the fist to the face

Maybe I seem shrewd, I know we canï¿½t save the world
But I will do my part, so letï¿½s get started, say what you mean, mean what you say
Throw your fist in the air, Itï¿½s just beginning

Swing the broken fist of God
Faith is shattered

Swing the broken fist of God
Faith is shattered
Canï¿½t run away
