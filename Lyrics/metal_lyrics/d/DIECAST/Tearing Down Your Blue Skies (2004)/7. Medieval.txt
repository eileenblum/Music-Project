Loose cannons fire as they target shades of gray

Bone is thicker than stone, nothing could ever break your skull
Bone is thicker than stone, nothing could ever break your skull

Loose cannons fire as they target shades of gray
Nevermind a mind that never evolves from the medieval

Bone is thicker than stone, nothing could ever break your skull
Bone is thicker than stone, nothing could ever break your skull

Damage is far greater than you ever could imagine
Then when you pump your seed full of sewage
If you need someone to hate just look into a mirror
There youï¿½ll see who will be buried six feet down (down)
Buried six feet down (down), youï¿½re dead and buried
Ignorance breeds ignorance, breeds hatred and decay
Morals and sympathies start to fade
Nevermind a mind that never looks to find the truth
Just hold your breath until you turn blue, and never exhale

Iï¿½ll bide my time, for you to cross the line, cross the line, all it takes is time
Bide my time, for you to cross the line, cross the line and just trip the wire
You feel so justified in actions that you take, fabricating dishonest mistakes
You reap what you sow, the burden that you bear will be inhuman but fair,
It will be fair, it will be fair

Loose cannons fire as they target shades of gray
Nevermind a mind that never evolves from the medieval
Loose cannons fire, targeting shades of gray, loose cannons fire, targeting shades of gray
Nevermind a mind that never evolves from the medieval
Bone is thicker than stone, nothing could ever break your skull
Damage is undamaged
