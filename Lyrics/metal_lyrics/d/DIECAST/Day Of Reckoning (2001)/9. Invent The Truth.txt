How could you lie straight to my face.
All trust that we had is gone.
If only you would have told me.
The truth that i deserve deserve, deserve.
I tried so hard to believe what you said to me.
Even though I knew it would exploit how I felt.
With your dishonesty your ipped out my heart.
I was betrayed and hurt left in the dark.
I felt so betrayed. I felt beyond repair.
I felt so weakened and in despair.
Now you try to lie some more to cover it.
I want no part of this or you.
Never again will you lie to me.
Invent the truth soemone else can see.
Now that we're apart I see how much you needed me.
Do not look to me for support in anything.
You should have thought ahead before you tried to lie to me.
Now I hope you rot in hell for eternity.
I felt so betrayed. I felt beyond repair.
I felt so weakened and in despair.
Now you try to lie some more to help you cover it.
I want no part of this or you.
YOU CANNOT BREAK ME.
Now that your all alone I rejoice.
You deserve more but this will suffice.
I move on with my life to leave you.
Memories fade away so FUCK YOU.
I live for tomorrow-true love for myself.
For myself! Never agin will you lie to me.
Invent the truth soemone else can see
