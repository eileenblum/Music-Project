Cutting life short I will end you take all that you have all you wanted your goals and your dreams.
Destroying hope I will crush you take your spirit.
Leaving you empty and hollow inside.
Crush you slowly. Steal your hopes dreams.
Cut your life short I will end you take all that you have all you wanted your goals and your dreams.
Destroy your hope I will crush you take your spirit.
Leaving you empty and hollow inside.
See myself I die slowly.
As I waste away with this cancer.
See myself i die slowly.
As I waste away with this plague this plague.
Your life is slowly depleted.
I come to reclaim your soul your death I bring, I bring.
Inside my grip ever tightening.
I hold your life in my hands so prepare, prepare.
For death draws near you fight in vain.
You will not break me. You will not beat me.
See myself I die slowly.
As I waste away with this cancer.
See myself I die slowly.
As I waste away with this plague this plague.
Struggling for life to continue.
I will not give in to fear my strength will grow, it grows.
I will not submit to this cancer.
Sickness exudes its control over my mind.
Awaiting death draws near i fight I won't submit.
You will not break me. You will not beat me
