It is my life, my life.
I need to live my own life to be free,
out on my own is a world that is strange to me.
Let me go lose control my time is now why can't you see and leave me be.
I never had things go my way, you always had them go your way.
Now I will have it all my way.
I will have it all my way you will not beat me.
HOW COULD YOU RUIN MY LIFE.
Why can't you just set me free.
I never had things go my way, you always had them go your way.
Now I will have it all my way.
I will have it all my way you will not beat me.
For all these years you controlled my movements,
dictated all my actions, reshaped my thoughts.
Tore apart my dreams now that it is done endured the test of time my freedom I've won.
Now my life is my own stay far away.
Freedom addictive corrupts me each day.
Feeling myself beign drawn back to you I must relent and stay alone.
I must keep you from me.
You must keep you from me, from me!
This is my life, it is my own, I will not hide in the shadows.
HOW COULD YOU RUIN MY LIFE.
Why can't you just set me free.
