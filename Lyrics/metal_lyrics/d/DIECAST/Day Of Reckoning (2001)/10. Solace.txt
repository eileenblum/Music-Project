Time and time again I ask myself why should I believe at all.
You've given no concrete reason.
For me to hasten to your beckoned call,
And so I cry unheard a bitter testimony to my misery.
And so how can I pray to you.
When you take those who I love from me.
I can't believe what's right before my eyes.
We cannot see his promises were lies.
I can't believe what's right before my eyes.
This deity he does not hear our cries.
How can we believe in what we don't see.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
Can't you can't you hear us hear us crying.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
How can we believe in what we don't see.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
Can't you can't you see us see us dying.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
My faith waivers prayers go unanswered.
Deny myself I wont worship you at all.
WE MUST NOT BELIEVE.
In what he tells us because promises were lies.
First he says to pray to him and then ignores our cries.
I won't give up the one true thing I know is mine.
My faith my belief I swear allegiance to myself.
I can't believe what's right before my eyes.
We cannot see his promises were lies.
I can't believe what's right before my eyes.
This deity he does not hear our cries.
How can we believe in what we don't see.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
Can't you can't you hear us hear us crying.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
How can we believe in what we don't see.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
Can't you can't you see us see us dying.
WE CAN'T BELIEVE.
My faith waivers prayers go unanswered.
Deny myself I won't worship you at all.
I will not worship you not in this life.
Maybe once I wanted to that time has passed.
What have you done for me but bring me pain.
You'll get no love from me its you I blame.
My faith is gone you'll get no prayers from me.
An empty shell of a man.
I hate what you stand for stamp out your memory.
As this regret clouds my mind.
Now i'm Free
