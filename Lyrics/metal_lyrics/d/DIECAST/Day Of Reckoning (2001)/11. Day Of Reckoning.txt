BOUND THROUGH BONDS THAT CANNOT BREAK.
Forged in the heat of action, ties that we foster lasting.
Protecting each of us, maintaining what sanity's left.
Relying on my friends they help me through my hardships.
I know they will be there no matter what life hands to me.
WE KEEP ON FIGHTING STRONG.
Supporting what we believe. What we believe.
KEEP ON FIGHTING STRONG.
DAY OF RECKONINGS COME.
And so we remain,
Remain FOREVER STANDING UNITED.
Forged in the heat of action,
Our Strength relies in numbers.
Protecting each of us, without them I'd be lost.
Relying on my friends they help me through my hardships
I know they will be there no matter what life hands to me.
UNITED... WE STAND... FOREVER... WE SHALL REMAIN...
Breaking free from this guilt to destroy those who would stand in our way.
WE KEEP ON FIGHTING STRONG.
Supporting what we believe, what we believe.
KEEP ON FIGHTING STRONG.
DAY OF RECKONINGS COME and so we remain,
Remain FOREVER STANDING UNITED
