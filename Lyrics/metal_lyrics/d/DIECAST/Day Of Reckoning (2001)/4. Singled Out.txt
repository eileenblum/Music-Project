It's in my head. I'm full of doubt.
Trapped in myself I'm singled OUT.
I have taken much more.
Than I can take I don't know what my.
Limits and boundaries are what else to do.
Now that I'm gone damaged and broke worthless
and shamed who can I blame.
Insanity lurks pent up inside.
Answers I seek can be found in my mind.
I dealt with what's in my head.
Its in my head I'm full of doubt.
Trapped in myself I'm singled OUT.
I have endured far too much.
Insanity lurks pent up inside.
I want to release this hate onto you.
I won't forget I am not blind.
Answers I seek can be found in my mind.
I dealt with what's in my head.
Its in my head I'm full of doubt.
Trapped in myself I'm singled out, out, OUT!
Its in my mind I'm singled out
its in my mind I've always been singled out.
Its in my head I'm full of doubt.
Trapped in myself I'm singled OUT.
Its in my mind I'm singled out
its in my mind I've always been singled out.
i'm singled out
