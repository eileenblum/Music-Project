Internal revolution
That rapes my confidence
And leaves me bleeding

I cannot, I cannot bleed
Falter on my crusade
I cannot, I cannot stop
Trudging on

Internal revolution
Can't ease my bothered mind
Did I choose wrong
No time for
Inquiry
Time marches on

Through this lucid pane of glass
See your life I wanted for my own
Crystal clear pane of glass
Is it time for me to break through

Slowly losing sight
Of what I sought to find
Have I wasted
Oh, have I wasted
Wasted my life
Losing sight
Of the corridor I thought is
Right for me
The time begins to tie down faster everyday, everyday
Losing sight
Crushing my one vision to
See the light
The light that is so overbearing, try to see, try to look

Through this lucid pane of glass
See your life I wanted for my own
Crystal clear pane of glass
Is it time for me to break through

Losing sight
