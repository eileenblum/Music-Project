Stepping up
No excuses are welcome
Take the cog
It's not your time to show the
World you've come
Prisoners are not an option
So draw your guns
And show them who I am

Just another taste
Will heal everything
My arsenal has just been tapped
I found the cure
To insecurity
The phoenix will be released

Stare them down
Nothing can hold me back
Blocking all
Light that shields fear
Powered by
A source like no other
Show them why
You are the one who's strong

The crowd is getting restless
Conveying lack of heart
There's only one way to win
The purest flame
That's ever touched my lips
Will drag this fire out of me

Can't believe how I am
Falling down, falling down
I thought I wouldn't be
So dependent, so dependent
Now I am giving in
To my weakness, to my weakness
Can't stop giving in, giving in
To my weakness, to my weakness
Is this me?
Succumb to weakness

Is this me?
Succumb to weakness
Is this me?
Succumb to weakness
Is this me?

Running far
Run from all my problems
That haunt in me

Must escape
Taking the only poison
That sets me free

Running far
Running from all my problems
That haunt in me

Must escape
Taking the only poison
That sets me free
