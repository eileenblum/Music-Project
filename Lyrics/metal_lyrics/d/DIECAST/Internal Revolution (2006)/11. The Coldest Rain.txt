[Verse I]
Alone again
Haunted by all your shadows
And memories

Coldest rain
Hides emotions that are pouring
From me to you

[Bridge]
Crazy again
Forced to face all truth

And exist
And exist

[Chorus (2x):]
All you had to say
Was you want me to

Leave this life
Leave this life

And I be gone

[Verse II]
The torturing
That I put myself through within
Won't end

Dying within
Cracking up, breaking down
Down to nothing

[Chorus (2x):]
All you had to say
Was you want me to

Leave this life
Leave this life

And I be gone

[Verse III]
Oh, oh, oh
I carry on alone

Knowing that my dignity is strong
If I catch it all away

You'd still be mine today
But inside I'd be hollow

[Chorus (2x):]
All you had to say
Was you want me to

Leave this life
Leave this life

And I be gone

[Verse IV]
Then you walked away
With nothing more to say
I never felt this helpless

This helpless before
You couldn't carry on
I guess you had enough

You made your choice
You made your choice
And now you fade away

[Outro]
The coldest rain
Hides emotions that are pouring
From me to you
