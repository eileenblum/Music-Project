[Intro]
You're gone

[Verse I]
Such a fool
To think that I could go though life alone
A difficult rash decision

I refuse to see
How I needed your help to complete
And reinforce my existence

[Chorus:]
What's left to say?
Except for you're the reason,
The reason for me being

You gave me strength,
The strength to be something,
To be something better

[Verse II]
Searching for another way
To steal a second chance
I pray for resolution (resolution)

Now I know that I'm
Missing your calm clarity
You were the one that listened (one that listens)

[Chorus:]
What's left to say?
Except for you're the reason
The reason for me being (for me being)

You gave me strength,
The strength to be something,
To be something better.

[2nd Chorus:]
What's (what's) left to say
Except for you're the reason

Except for you're the reason
You're gone

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Nothing I could say
Could bring you back tomorrow (nothing I could say)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Nothing I could say
Could dissipate my sorrow

All I had to
Do was let you
Know

[Chorus:]
What's left to say?
Except for you're the reason
The reason for me being (for me being)

You gave me strength
The strength to be something
To be something better

To be something better
To be something better (what's left to say?)

To be something better
To be something better (what's left to say?)

To be something better
To be something better (what's left to say?)

You make me feel
Something better
