Suffering, stewing in all of this anguish
Why am I forced to just continue beating down myself
Standards forcing me to raise expectation
Am I too shallow for my own good?
The problem I have
Is me
Why can't I have what I yearn for?
Desire eludes me
Never satisfied
What will quench my?
Thirst for more than my world
Can provide for me
Is it a tragedy that I drink water?
'Stead of wine
Such a game that my minds playing on me
Shooting down who may be the perfect one
Contest what's right
For me
Why can't I have what I yearn for?
Desire eludes me
Never satisfied
What will quench my thirst?
I'm sifting through the sands again
To find the meaning
Why is it so hard to find?
The wisdom that eludes
I'm sifting through the sands again
To find the meaning
Am I ever going to find?
The solution that escapes me
Someone please give me the answer
Someone ask the question why?
Someone please give me the answer
Someone ask the question why?
Someone please give me the answer
To the question
Why won't you tell me why?
Someone please give me the answer
To the question
