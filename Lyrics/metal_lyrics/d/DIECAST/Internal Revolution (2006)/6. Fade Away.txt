We both knew the answers
To our misery and pain that stained our being
Lost in clouds of comfort
So afraid to take the fall into desolation

What could make you fade away?
I can't pretend that there's nothing left
What could make you fade away?
If there's something then I need it to fade away
Make you fade away,
Why can't I make you fade away?

Searching for completion
And so we venture separate ways to find fulfillment
I won't soon forget you
Your mark is branded on my heart and soul forever

What could make you fade away?
I can't pretend that there's nothing left
What could make you fade away?
If there's something then I need it to fade away

Nothing will make you fade away
Nothing

We stand alone
Bonded by our compliance
Examining exactly how this happened
You were the one
The only one I wanted
Your choice was made and
Now I need you to fade away

I need you to fade away

What could make you fade away?
I can't pretend that there's nothing left
What could make you fade away?
If there's something then I need it to fade away
