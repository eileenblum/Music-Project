You take, you take innocence
And give it such a twist
Life must be fought head to head
If you are going to win
I see, I see all the pain
That causes misery
Time and time again
We must face all that's beckoning
I believe in, I believe in, I believe in
Ourselves to take what is thrown our way
I believe in, I believe in, I believe in
The one desire to never fail
On broken legs I stand
Salute with bloody hands
I've signed my fate
A sea of endless cries
True honor never dies
Never forget, never forget, it's not too late
Divide, divide, everyone
A will to segregate
Never believe when you read
Their string of bullshit
Don't give, don't give into
What they are forcing
You must re-enforce
What you know is true
I believe in, I believe in, I believe in
Ourselves to take what is thrown our way
I believe in, I believe in, I believe in
The one desire to never fail
Re-enforce everything you know
It is our tomorrow
Re-enforce everything you know
It is our tomorrow
