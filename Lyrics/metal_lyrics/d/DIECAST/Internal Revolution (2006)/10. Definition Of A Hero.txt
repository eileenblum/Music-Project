Brother's fighting everyday,
With bullet is marked for them.
Your eternal sacrifice,
The truest and most noble.
Fire, that stops us.
Fire, that stops us.

Sometimes it's too easy to forget those who are pulled away from their
families,
Sometimes it's too easy to forget those who will never see their families
again.

Unite, fight for what's right.
You are the definition of a hero.
Unite, fight for what's right.
You are the definition of a hero.

Who cares? Weather all the bullshit,
Political propaganda.
Trying to understand half-truths,
Politicians are spreading thick.
Liars tell half-truths,
Liars tell half-truths.

Tell me, why did you give up your life?
You bring them freedoms throughout this world.
Tell me, why did you give up your life?
You give them freedom, give them freedom worth fighting for.

I will always stand behind our brothers, our sisters, our soldiers.

Unite, fight for what's right.
You are the definition of a hero.
Unite, fight for what's right.
You are the definition of a hero.
