Horrified
By what we've become
Glorifying
All the damage we have done
Our time is running out
Are you the one to change it

Hourglass is running short of sand
The candle's burning again

I don't want to live forever
I don't want to see this world decay
I don't want to live forever
To be the one to see the end of days

Take a look
The wounds aren't healing
You can't make all
The pain we're feeling fade
To restore all that's gone
To the way it was before

Hourglass is running short of sand
The candle's burning again
And I'm the only one to understand

I don't want to live forever
I don't want to see this world decay
I don't want to live forever
To be the one to see the end of days

And all the endless suffering will always grow and prosper
And all the endless suffering will always grow and prosper

I don't want to live forever and be the one
I don't want to live forever and be the one
