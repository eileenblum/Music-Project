[2006 "Vanishing Sessions" Track][Winter 2006]
[Composed in 1991 under the name âInternal Frenzied Infectionâ. Lyrics and new name given in 2006.]

It starts with the connection of cells
Nerves networking in unimaginable ways
Our whole atom-based reality
is turning into a single entity and race

Consciousness blending together
as mammals feel what plants feel
and fungus learns why mountains stand still
Surreal's nothing anymore, nothing's surreal

I learned to know how the world works
collected all the living information
Or lifeless, and those we haven't known before
What I've found gives me no consolation

All has become one
A great blend of variety
But as emptiness is filled with nothing
it's still nothing, still emptiness
