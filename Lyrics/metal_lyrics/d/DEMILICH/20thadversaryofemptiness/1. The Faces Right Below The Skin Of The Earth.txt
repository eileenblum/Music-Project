[2006 "Vanishing Sessions" Track][Winter 2005-2006]

They've spent their lives all alone
on six evenly placed sides of the Earth
Right below where we lay our feet on
they unknowingly give us our birth

While they ease us with gravity
we simply push them away
Sinking with visceral feelings of revulsion
they are sealing our fate

It won't take very long
until they can move no more
They will form the core
that will imprison them forever
