[2006 "Vanishing Sessions" Track][Winter 2006]
[Composed in 1991 under the name âCorporal Afflictionâ. Lyrics and new name given in 2006.]

They don't see the trees are gone
Nor birds, who think they can fly wingless
They don't feel the winds that don't blow
As the air's replaced by emptiness

It's not strange the mountains are holes
Holes like the seas that are waterless
The Sun's disappeared and gives no warmth
No one feels it as there is no coldness

One walks in the void
and sees nothing wrong
Another nightless day
and he will also be gone
