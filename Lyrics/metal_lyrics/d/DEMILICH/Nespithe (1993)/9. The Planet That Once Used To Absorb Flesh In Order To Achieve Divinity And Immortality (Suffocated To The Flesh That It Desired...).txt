A silent forsaken planet Its pores full of flesh It once used to be alive 
Now dead, condemned to loneliness Lying in space, completely alone Covered 
with tons and tons of piles of bone The former master of the Universe and 
its stars The former master died its cover full of scars Its core has gotten 
cool, the greed has shown fatality No more absorbing, no consuming, it will 
never reach immortality
