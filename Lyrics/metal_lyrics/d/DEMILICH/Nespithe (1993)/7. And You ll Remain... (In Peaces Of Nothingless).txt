In the backyard
you see a white stain
Nevertheless, looking unreal
like a tiny passage to emptiness

Thinking of touching the thing
you kneel over it
Interest exceeding carefulness
you'll be soon in peaces in nothingness...

The parts of the fingers you put in the hole
are now taken to another dimension
It's enlarging itself with the power you gave
Now a metre wide, you'll be dead in a while

Ruthless...

Now you have no feet
The thing has become ten metres wide
You can hear its masticating
and the silent, ironic laughter

Another victim suffering
You pray to god
Your screaming won't stop until your mouth has been
teleported thoroughly
