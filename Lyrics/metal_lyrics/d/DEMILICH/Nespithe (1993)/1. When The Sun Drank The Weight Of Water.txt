War of elements Water against the Sun The Sun leading a battle of the war 
that will never be done Sucking the weight of water Bringing its weakness 
back Now possessing an important weapon The weight that all molecules lack 
The water gets up to the sky People flying as wind goes by The seeds of 
their hate Never die, everything's too late The earth will be gone All 
because of the rage of the Sun
