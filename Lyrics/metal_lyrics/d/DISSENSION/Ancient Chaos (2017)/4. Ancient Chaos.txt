Unaligned stars that scream destruction
Devastated salvation
Sky is falling ground is trembling
City torched ocean of flames
Sun and moon at war
Death cloaked in red

Fallen creation
Burning in Ancient Chaos
Race of men lay dead
Man's creations in devastation
Race of men lay dead

Rapid disease sores bleed
Plagues that seek rotting flesh
Red waters infested by the dead
Smoke choked future caving walls
Wide spread famine dissolving heavens
Ash covered kingdom

Fallen creation
Burning in Ancient Chaos
Race of men lay dead
Man's creations in devastation
Race of men lay dead

Wrath of the ones from beyond the stars
Unlocked gates to these plains cursed are your names!
Nowhere to hide in this blood smeared night
Priest that preach lies
Never bound by holy ties

Unaligned stars that scream destruction
Sun and moon at war
Waters rising erased horizon
Howling tortured beasts
Forever burning in Ancient Chaos

Fallen creation
Burning in Ancient Chaos
Race of men lay dead
Man's creations in devastation
Race of men lay dead
