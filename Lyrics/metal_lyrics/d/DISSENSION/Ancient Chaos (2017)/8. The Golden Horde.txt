Our campaign
The dream of our rigid king
We shall impose our will on our weakened foes
And rid our enemies our sworn adversaries
The weak shall succumb to our dreadful force

Such a terrible looming menace heathen hordes
Daunting horsemen
With an unchallenged taste for war
After vain opposition,
Princes beseeched mercy denied
Suffer miserable slaves
Appalling unbearable fates

The devil's horsemen
Death will come suddenly for you
Crushing Christian orders
Rivers of blood we have crossed
Mountains of victims at our back
Golden Horde of Asia the Devil's Horsemen

The wrath of our sturdy king
We shall impose on our weakened foes
And rid our enemies our sworn adversaries
The West will succumb to our dreadful force

Gods of war trample weakness
With spear and the gleaming sword
Kings submit all doubts and uncertainties
Are eternally eclipsed
Princes reap devastation
Dejected men shall not escape their issued fates
For we are the pure flame, the conquering ones

The devil's horsemen
Death will come suddenly for you
Crushing Christian orders
Rivers of blood we have crossed
Mountains of victims at our back
Golden Horde of Asia the Devil's Horsemen

Amidst our slaughter of saints
Our minds turn to the East
For alas our father has passed
As Princes of Blood we return to our homeland
For we now know the hearts of our enemies
Our Westerly slaves kings
Ingrained with the shame of defeat
Forever scarred with despair and misery
