Banished to the never ending sands
Where the dark howls in tongues
Evades the moon from its secret art
He listens with hatred in his heart

Taste the flesh of the unborn
Your bed will forever be cold
My mistrust in you
Will not shame this throne
Enraged king utters and screams
Let the dunes be your open tomb

In this desolate state my soul
I trade for my vengeance
From this point I'll roam alone forever in pain
For I have felt the end of the world
I'll lurk in the unknown
And let my vengeance unfold

Alliances with the dead
Which your children know and dread
The flames will consume them
They know not your names
Though you have smelled the rot of my flesh and blood
I will forever be the fear within your hearts and thoughts

Two thousand nights beneath this shattered moon
I have come for you my once magnificent king

Your daughter speaks to me
On the top of temples to reach the stars
Your grandchild laughs faceless blinded defleshed
Now let this blade consume you with everlasting pain
Hordes of the sacred flame
Consume your soul 'til the end of days
The dunes await you...
