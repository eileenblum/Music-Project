Anu uttered the oath of secrecy
Foul beings in disgraceful scenes
No more tolerance for these wretched things
Advised by malice the hearts of the great gods moved them to inflict The Great Flood

Reed house reed house wall, wall!
A secret plan I divulge to you,
A secret oath was devised
A scheme to end all things
For you have roamed too far O Shurappak man
Confidence overgrown Father Anu enraged
This vengeful plague is conceived to abolish the fires of man
Tear down your house.
You must take refuge in isolation,
Craft us a vessel a fortress to house
Perpetuate all crawling things

What do I tell my people?
Tell them of an expulsion from your home
That your lord shall keep you
Tell them nothing of that oath
Of the foul inception to abolish their world

Day upon day slaughtered were the sheep
An army of kin building this dream
By sunset Shamash had set a stated time
There arose a black cloud inside
Within the wrath of the gods
Six days and seven nights
Came the wind and flood
Flattening the land
The storm pounded turning flesh to clay
Annunaki Shullat Hanish Erragal Ninurta
The raven has left me on the seventh day

Charge the violation to the violator
Charge the offense to the offender
Be compassionate lest they be cut off
Be patient lest they be killed
