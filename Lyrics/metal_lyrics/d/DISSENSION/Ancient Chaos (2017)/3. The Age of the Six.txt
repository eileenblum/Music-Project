Dying fifth sun your mistakes will be erased
Your solar flares will drag us to our graves
The absence of your successor has them in denial
Four suns before this terrible disaster

With our blood we give rise to the Sixth Sun
To house us beneath the astral planes
Forgotten are the ways of the age of old
New horizons unfold
With your purifying glow the moon shines brighter than ever before
Deceit will not be known
Never again ignorant kings
Never again disposable slaves

Aborted sons of god your mouths sewn shut
Last dawn of the sick give way to the rising sun
Aborted sons of god your eyes sewn shut
First dusk of the six free of the age of the sick

Palaces not built out of greed
No beliefs drenched in secrecy
Chains won't shackle us to fear
Paradise on land not in the sky but for all to see

Aborted sons of god your mouths sewn shut
Last dawn of the sick give way to the rising sun
Aborted sons of god your eyes sewn shut
First dusk of the six free of the age of the sick

Opened sixth gate
The cunning have evaporated
Wisdom and intelligence reborn
No longer torn,
Earth and stars Sun and Moon
No rich nor poor
No chosen few
Only virtues
