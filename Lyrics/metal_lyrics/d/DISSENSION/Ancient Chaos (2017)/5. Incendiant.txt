Great sphere of fire incinerates the weak
Their ashes blown and swallowed by the sea
Never foreseen by the ones they believe
Burned are the institutions of lunacy

Fallen is the father
Enslaved is the child
Great sphere of fire incinerate
Incendiant

Ignite burn destroy conquer

Swiftly moving winds that carry these flames of annihilation no salvation
Flame scripted fate in the book of doom
Fire proclamation of true devastation

Ignite burn destroy conquer

Unholy forces praise the enslavement of the child and the fall of the father
Ignited temples burned words destroyed image conquered religion

Fallen is the father
Enslaved is the child
Great sphere of fire incinerate
Incendiant
