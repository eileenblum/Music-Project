Treachery
In the shadows of their palace of worship
Bound! To the arts of destruction
Behind their anointed trinity cloaks
They crave the taste of human slaves
To feed to the flames feed them slaves

Contradictions of the righteous
Using the dead for their seduction

What lies in the dark
Is a secret that they murder to guard
Making you kneel
For what they know is a false god
So pray but the day will never come to be saved

Blind men don't feel the difference
Between the living dead
Praise the royal robe yet forget principles
Popes and disciples
Have never done miracles
Just tricks to wrap people
Around with their tentacles

Manifest things unknown
The pain will come seven-fold
Kingdom of God, comforting lies
That the church has promised and told
No questions to be asked
They swallowed the pill whole
Darkness veiled in light
Unknown masked as known

Blind men don't feel the difference
Between the living dead
Praise the royal robe yet forget principles
Popes and disciples
Have never done miracles
Just tricks to wrap people
Around with their tentacles
