Abandon this forsaken age
Advancing yet awaiting
A collision with our past
Progressing towards that inescapable fate
Victory in this age hangs by a cord
Narcissism will serve as an ally no longer

Victory in this age strained by a void
Perpetuation remains our only choice
Victory in this age strained by a void
Perpetuation

We will accept this amendment
Back into our past
The aged hammer is anxious
Held back eager to descend
We are strained to deal
With what we once were
The forefathers our prototype,
Enduring through the epochs

Victory in this age strained by a void
Perpetuation remains our only choice
Victory in this age strained by a void
Perpetuation

A hopeless world around fragmented
Into primeval dust
Forged from those debris are we
We, who accept this amendment issued from our past thrive from those debris

An ancient storm will arise

Mankind shall once again
Call upon his place in this world
And burn all beliefs to escape the past
Shall reign in our forsaken age
Recognize what we are destined to
Become once again as we're bound by misery
Forever leading us towards

Vengeance of our past
Descend towards retribution for our acts
