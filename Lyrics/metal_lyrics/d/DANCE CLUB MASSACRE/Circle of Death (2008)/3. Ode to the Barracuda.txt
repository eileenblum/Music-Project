Our story ends with a signature for something I'll never be.
But it didn't have to be this way.   
Your uniform was no different from the rest but you were cool, so here's a brand new song just for you.
It all began when I saw your face from the stage then your blood was drawn upon my command.
The return:
When you say you want some more.
No problemo.
Everything is cool, but I just can't bring myself to say "why don't you go fuck yourself."
The room is spinning as I'm down on the floor.
At least down here you won't bother me no more.   
The words you speak are perfectly clear, so I guess I'll have myself another beer.
Now you've got yourself a girlfriend.
Well...a dude who wears girl pants. 
Nonetheless it's safe to say he's a dork.
Funny how you hate the ska yet it reminds me of you everyday.
They say there's plenty of fish in the sea.  
Alas this is true.
I've reeled in a few.
Baby minnows at the most so I throw them back in.  
But what do you do when you catch the biggest fish of them all?
Now I could swim for years and never get tired.
But I assure you if I ever come across your boat one more time, I'll steal the bait.
And leave you waiting.
The words you spoke were crystal clear, now I think I'll go have another beer.
