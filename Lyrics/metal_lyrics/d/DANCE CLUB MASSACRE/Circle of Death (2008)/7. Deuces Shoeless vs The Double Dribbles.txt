Simply the greatest game of all time.
A 5 on 5 b-ball extravaganza.
Mitch and I shall be team captains and select the best from the best.
In my first pick at power forward I choose the Samoan bulldozer Umaga.   
In retaliation Mitch boosts his defense and steals with the Repo Man.
Fortunately enough I receive Jimmy Snuk for the distant shots, and Kamala as a towering center.
Now Mitch has chosen Too Cold Scorpio and D'Lo Brown.
But I know who knows the real low down.
Mr. Fuji shall play the perimeter on my shoeless team.
Mitch scrambles Santino Marella.
He thinks this is his casa.
Well a certain necro butcher thinks otherwise.
Poor shock master is with Mitch by default.
No one likes to be picked last.
In a game of razzle dazzle- jukes, spins, blood sweat and tears have flooded the court.   
In the final showdown, with 5 seconds left on the clock, my main man Mr. Fuji hits a fade away shot on the 9 point spot to win the game.   
Shoeless warriors of mine....
To the bar, drinks on me.
Fuck you Mitch.
