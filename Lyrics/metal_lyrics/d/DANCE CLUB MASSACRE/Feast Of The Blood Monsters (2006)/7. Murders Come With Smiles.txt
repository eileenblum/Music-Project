Drink up my dear, your time has come. 
can you feel the darkness rising above you? 
you're not going home tonight. 
just speak these words, "theres no place like home". 
now you're mine and no one else can please me but you. 
ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together, for tonights main attraction has arrived.
snap. stomp. clap. fuck. 
the four true demandments hold true.
i suppose i'll ask you to dance.
join me for a smoke outside i says.
this i tell myself, might bring opportunity.
i'm so lame today.
relax, this is just a detour.
look at her she's so fine.
beat me if you can, survive if i let you. 
now i know why you listen to poison, my little rose, my little thorn... 
life should be more like nba jam t.e. 
when all is lost you can still hit a nine pointer in the clutch
