I'll wash my hands with your blood just before I dine tonight. Sometimes when I'm with you I want to stab you in the heart, just like Rudy from Monster Squad when he's fighting them bitches in the street. Chill out, I don't think you're so hot when you look like you are already dead. I left my dirty work in the G.C.
Will you be my girlfriend? Circle yes or no. I left my heart in parts unknown.
