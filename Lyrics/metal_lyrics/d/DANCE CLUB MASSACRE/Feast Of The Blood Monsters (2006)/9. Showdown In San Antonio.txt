Hey im the champion of good times and funk
so move your feet and lets pawn these tragedies. tell me whats on your mind these days. 
i may not give a fuck now, but later? 
yes im cool as tex haywood and im fly like futureman
and i was just thinking we should do it sometime. theres no reason for us to stop. 
the car is parked and the mood is sinking, 
so we'll take things slow. 
soon enough i will indulge myself. 
this is an adventure place. 
your hands on my flesh. 
does this taste familiar? or have you come to realize a certain truth your plague is your profession
