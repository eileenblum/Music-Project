Don't bust my chops babe, you ain't no damsel in distress.  If so I'm your villain. If we embark on this journey upstairs, the shit's gonna hit the fan. For someone who wears expensive armor, you sure as hell can't hold your own. You best be ready to bust out the game Genie, cause I'm the final boss. I'm tired of one vs. one when you play with a handicap. Yes, i rock, but you sure could use a tutorial. I'm tired of half assed  HJs as i blister my fingers. No, I won't find a worthy opponent. What's that sound downstairs? Man I'm missing out. Global guts in on, and someone's making breakfast. What a waste of time.
