I remember when you and I used to be inseparable, kind of like Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in that one movie.
What happened? Where's the buzz I used to get from drinking you? Look into my eyes. What you've done to me, I liked you more when you were sexy.
Now you've gone from Miss Liv to Sapphire.
Relax baby I'm only kidding... But seriously, you go fuck yourself.
Flame throwers and machine guns can't keep me down cause I'm Balushi and you're Carrie Fisher.
Now do you feel somewhat cool?
Now that you're Princess Leia.
