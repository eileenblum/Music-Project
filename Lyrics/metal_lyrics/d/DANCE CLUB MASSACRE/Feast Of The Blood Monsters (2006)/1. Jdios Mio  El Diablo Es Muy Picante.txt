I'll treat you like the fuck you want to get fucked by then you can fuck yourself the way I couldn't.
I'll shake the maracas like a champ, like a professional, but you won't dance for me though. I know you like the blood on the back of my hand. 
What did you expect of me?
Prince charming is a faggot's tale, and I'm just staring in a bathroom mirror, into a montage.
Baby I'd pick your brain if I were a surgeon, but if I tried I'd end up in some desert heading for the same mirage.
