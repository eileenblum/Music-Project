Oh no baby, this ain't attitude, it's baditude. Have you looked into the devil's eyes? I didn't think so. Do you have the golden touch such only gods of great stature like Dr. Jones possesses? I didn't think so. Needless to say, I'm not impressed. Okay, here's the truth, I smashed a lot of empty beer bottles that night. Hey... dissed and dismissed... No, I can't blame her.
