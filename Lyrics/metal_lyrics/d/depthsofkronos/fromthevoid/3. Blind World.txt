Blind world

Darkness all consumes us
Into the realm of the dead
Find your way out or be lost in the depths.
Forsaken souls fade, await your fate
The ending is near, cast away your fear

Life drifts away in the mind of the decayed
As they linger on into the grave
Spiritless, spineless they march on
I will not bow down for the swarm
Spiritless, spineless they march on
I will not bow down for the swarm

Blind in a world so blackened
Blind in a world so deceived
Deaf in a realm so wretched
Deaf in a realm so corrupt

Darkness all consumes us into the realm of the dead
Find your way out or be lost in the depths.
Forsaken souls fade, await your fate
The ending is near, cast away your fear

What is fear in a world so rotten
What is death in a world so unreal

Blind in a world so blackened
Blind in a world so deceived
Deaf in a realm so wretched

Witness the blind world
