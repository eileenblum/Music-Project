I will live

My light was taken ages ago
Consumed by the lifeless void
These days will be smothered by doom
It will fade me away

When we begun
We walked these woods to see the rising sun
We were so full of life
But now everything we touch slowly dies
Together we roamed these endless fields
We created those unchained memories
We were free
We were free

The loneliness will now echo in these halls of despair
As I stare into the visions of our broken dreams
Will I ever see you again
Or will I live this woe alone

Follow the flow of the waves
And let it swallow you whole
Let it take you away
Follow the flow of the waves
And let it swallow you whole
Let it take you away from here

Drown to be reborn

When we begun
We walked these woods to see the rising sun
We were so full of life
But now everything we touch slowly dies
Together we roamed these endless fields
We created those unchained memories
We were free
We were free

The loneliness will now echo in these halls of despair
As I stare into the visions of our broken dreams
Will I ever see you again
Or will I live this woe alone

Follow the flow of the waves
And let it swallow you whole
Let it take you away
Follow the flow of the waves
And let it swallow you whole
Let it take you away from here

I will cherish these moments
I will live for these moments
I will cherish these moments
I will live for these moments

We drifted our own paths
The book now comes to end
I will cherish these moments
I will live for these moments

We drifted our own paths
The book now comes to end
I will cherish these moments
I will live for these moments

I will live
I will live
I will live
I will live
