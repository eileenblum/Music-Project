Enter the age
The age of deformity
The end of equality
We will not live to see the end
Into the depths we'll descend
The horizon will fade away
This earth will take the blame
Of mankinds shame

Humanities flatline
The end of men
Once greatness and purity
Now lost into eternity
Cast away for good
Taken by the flood

Mankind will dissolve
Mankind will all dissolve

I feel the world collapse
Beneath my own feet
I see the world die
Right in front of me

We all witness the destruction
We all witness the destruction

Chaos takes control
The storm rages on

Building towards the final hour
How pathetic to form our own devour
Always grasping for more power
Natures chapter comes to closure
This is vengeance, this is our last chance
This is the end of the world
This is hatred, this is carnage
This is the end of our dear world

Our dear world

I feel the world collapse
Beneath my own feet
I see the world die
Right in front of me

We all witness the destruction
We all witness the destruction

Chaos takes control
The storm rages on

This was our home, the place we built and broke down
Pass on the crown, the crown of our failed reign
Lower your heads, walk through the gates of despair
We all lived, but now dawns the end

We all lived, we all destroyed
