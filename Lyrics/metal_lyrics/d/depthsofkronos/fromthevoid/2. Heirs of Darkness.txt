The burning village lies before him
As a tear leaves his eye
The burning ashes blaze the sky
Hear the screams, of the innocent cry
Burning bodies, forsaken souls
Can't leave the sight.

As he ran into the forest
The haunting screams followed
How could death
Sound so hollow

Carved the memory of grief
Inside of skull and soul
Poisoned thoughts
Sicken the cautious mind

Risen from the ashes of hatred
What have I become
A being molded by inner darkness
Descendant of the void
Merciless entity, driven by vengeance
Son of malevolence

Carved the memory of grief
Inside of skull and soul
Poisoned thoughts
Sicken the cautious mind

Watch me slip away, into the eternal black

The path of no return
Suffer as I have suffered
Witness what you've created
The heir of darkness
