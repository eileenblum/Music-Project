Corrupted campaign

The wide sight of a legion uprising,
Rapturing through the lines of marble and stone
The Greek society stands alone
A single shout of hope, will not be told

Under corrupting command, devouring the land
This corrupted campaign
Will be won by the darkest reign

Kneel down as
The lords come to
Claim your death
Will soon be to blame

Uprising legion
Leaving a trail of death
Tormenting bloodshed
All over the torn land

Uprising legion
Leaving a trail of death
Tormenting bloodshed
All over the torn land

Corrupted campaign

Release the force
Of the divine one
All will furl into death

The wide sight of a legion uprising
Rapturing through the lines of marble and stone
The Greek society stands alone
A single shout of hope, will not be told

Under corrupting command, devouring the land.
This corrupted campaign
Will be won by the darkest reign

Uprising legion
Leaving a trail of death
Tormenting bloodshed
All over the torn land

Uprising legion
Leaving a trail of death
Tormenting bloodshed
All over the torn land

Greek soldiers will stand their ground
This battle will soon unbound
Silence before the storm
The enemy are at our door

End this endless campaign
For too long our Greek brothers bled in vain
End this corrupted mind, delusion of time
Waste of sacred blood, eternal rot
