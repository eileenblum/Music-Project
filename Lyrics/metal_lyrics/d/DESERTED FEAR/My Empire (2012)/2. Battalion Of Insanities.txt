The battalion of insanities watching over mankind.
Pestilence, suffocation will reach for every lie.
Disabled people will start a hellish cry and now I wait for you to die.

...to die!

Extinction of live, be pest or be hate.

Bombs are crashing down to earth and no one will survive.
Diseases sneaking there around, beat you to underlie.
Satanic blasphemy casts a shadow on humanity and now I wait for you to die.

...to die!

Extinction of live, be pest or be hate.

Chaos, destruction, fire, death, all will feel that survive is senseless.
Anarchy has broken out there, nightmare creatures come out of the darkness.
Chaos, destruction, fire, death, all will feel that survive is senseless.
Torture is the agenda there, chains rattling through the whole dark biosphere.

Biosphere.

Extinction of live, be pest or be hate.
