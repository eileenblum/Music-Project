You cut a piece of entrails out of my core.
No one can escape the rusty grasp with the blade.
No sanity, no law, dissection so raw.
I see the hell is coming near.

Lay down, down for pain. 
Right down for pain, so savour the moment right.

Flesh will be ripped out of your corpus and blood flows out.
Just like a morbid infection, expatiates my carnal lust.

I lay on the cot, my abdomen a slot.
Psychological terror, befalls me to my hour.
The passion in his eyes will lead me to disaster
Agony and pain, conquer me insane.

Lay down, down for pain. 
Right down for pain, so savour the moment right.
Flesh will be ripped out of your corpus and blood flows out.
Just like a morbid infection, expatiates my carnal lust.
