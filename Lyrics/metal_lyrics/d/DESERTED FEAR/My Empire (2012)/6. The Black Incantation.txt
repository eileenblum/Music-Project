I fall in pain, there is no second chance.
The stabbing pain is a soulful dance.
I realize that is all too late.
The nocturnal prayers have to fail.

Hate for solution, I will not be dead.
Brutal deadly confusion when the sky is red.

I fall in pain, there is no second chance.
The stabbing pain is a soulful dance.
I realize that is all too late.
The nocturnal prayers have to fail.

The guardian provides salvation.
Their eyes will see the black incantation.
Slaughter me, I agree.

I fall in pain, there is no second chance.
The stabbing pain is a soulful dance.
I realize that is all too late.
The nocturnal prayers have to fail.
