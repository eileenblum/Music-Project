Pestilential, the awakening of terror.
The innocents will call them irate.

Heretic, rape me.
Pestilence.

Fetidness and disgust, black bruises destruct me hard.
Screams penetrate my veins, nothing I have done anymore.

Pestilential, the awakening of terror.
The innocents will call them irate.

The rise of the infinite flame, supported by creators of the damned.
Cosmic supremacy appears, nothing I will see anymore.

Black flames burn, chased by black eyes of the ignorance.
Steal by pain, the dark and his threads to the underground.
Black flames burn, chased by black eyes of the ignorance.

Pestilential, the awakening of terror.
The innocents will call them irate.

Heretic, rape me.
Pestilence.
