I found the serpent kind and realize the change of mind.
Destroy the nation and the believers and now you can not find a way.
A way out of the vow.

Bury your dead and I see red.
Bury your dead and I see red.

Now they refer to preach, they withdraw like a leech.
Nightmare at eight and stabbed to death and now you can not find a way.
A way out of the vow.

Bury your dead and I see red.
Bury your dead and I see red.

Slap on the wrist, stab on the back.
Slap on the wrist, stab on the back.
The eternal recurrence, the essential question.

Bury your dead!

Bury your dead and I see red.
Bury your dead and I see red.
