Bombs, devastation.
I dig a grave for the whole bloody nation.
Anthrax, battlefield.
Decay of the trenches, the human protective shield.
Scars, barbwire.
Accepting commands on the ground of the liar.
Grenade, explosion.
My ears blown away in the world of confusion.

My empire, my empire of dirt.
My empire, my empire of dirt.

Instinct, execution.
There is no escape only the headshot solution.
Now my empire, I can not leave without leaving desires.

My empire, my empire of dirt.
My empire, my empire of dirt.
My empire, my empire of dirt.
My empire, my empire of dirt.
