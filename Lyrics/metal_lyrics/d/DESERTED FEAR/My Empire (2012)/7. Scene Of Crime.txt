Slicing in my death.
Flowing, embrace the life.
Suffer the war machine.
This hell to be, aiding mine.
Association, fall of the templars crown.
Fear of the crying breath, done of life.
Can be heard by your crown and my inviolate...
My inviolate rapture.

Of my inviolate...
Of my inviolate rapture.

Enticing, you are there.
Clawing, apply the knife.
Lover of the bloody sheen.
Respell the death rattle trine.
Asphyxiation, the lung seems scaled down.
Fear of the crying breath, done of life.
Can be heard by your crown and my inviolate...
My inviolate rapture.

Of my inviolate...
Of my inviolate rapture.

The way you be in line and now it is killing time.
Enter the scene of crime.

The way you be in line and that is the killing time.
Scene of crime.

I will divide me.
I will hagride me.

My inviolate...
My inviolate rapture.

Of my inviolate...
Of my inviolate rapture.

I will divide me.
Rapture!
I will hagride me.
