I wish I could be a stranger
If I was then you wouldn't find out
I've got a head full of violent pictures,
No way to work it out, and I know now

When I was young I wanted to grow older.
Now I'm grown can I take it all back?
I've got a head full of violent pictures,
I made them all myself. I know now

By the grace of God, I'll wake up in the morning with nothing
But my friends and memories of dreaming of you
I know, I need forgiveness, like a hole in the head
Take me backwards, I don't want to know who I am

You just walked away
By the grace of God,
I'll wake up in the morning with nothing
But my friends and memories of dreaming of you
I know, I need forgiveness, like a hole in the head.
Take me backwards,
Take me backwards,
Take me backwards...
I don't want to know who I am
