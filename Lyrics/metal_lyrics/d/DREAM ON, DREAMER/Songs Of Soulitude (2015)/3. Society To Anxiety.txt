Well Iâve been running from this story for years,
The ghost keeps chasing me,
The grounds keep breaking me,
Iâm not really lost, I just havenât found it yet
There is no place on earth where no misery exists,

Let me just say, let me escape
I know I can
(I know I can) [2x]
Iâve been alone, Iâve been so scared
I know youâre there
(I know youâre there) [2x]

They said
Breathe in just a little more [3x]
They said
Breathe in just a little more [4x]
They said breathe in just a little more

This has to stop
It canât go on like this
Just get me out of this sinking ship Iâm in

Let me just say, let me escape
I know I can
(I know I can) [2x]
Iâve been alone, Iâve been so scared
I know youâre there
(I know youâre there) [2x]

Itâs only pain when it hurts
Itâs only night when itâs black
The only thing youâll love is lost
And the light pulls you back
