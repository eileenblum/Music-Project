Waking up again in this fragile state we're in
Trying to understand what makes you a better man

Feel the raw emotion
This is who you're meant to be
They can see above our heads
They can see across this wasteland
On my knees I beg to leave every day
So sick of the air we breathe

If we compare the scars through our eyes
Close up, yours are just as bad as mine
But we know yeah we know we are innocent
I'm a criminal, you're criminal, we're all criminals
Innocent criminals...

We're on the edge
We're under attack
If this goes on we can only go back
We're on the edge
We're under attack
If this goes on then we both fade to black
