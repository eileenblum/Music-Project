Voices for the voiceless
Together we can change tomorrow

We are fighting for the answers
Don't hide between the shadows
We are the voices for the voiceless
Understanding leads to progress

Wake up and see what's in front of your eyes
Express what you feel and come alive
This is a story of you, living the truth
Only life itself is bigger than you
We are the voices for the voiceless
Together we can stop this silence

I want what I shouldn't
I tried but I couldn't
It's OK to feel like no one
Knows your name
They say
"Spend time for your riches
There's no rest for the wicked"
But that's what the evil say...
It's all just a game

We're killing all our heroes
They've been hiding in the shadows
We are the voices for the voiceless
Don't be afraid, we're making progress
Wake up and see what's in front of your eyes
Express what you feel and come alive

We don't know who we are
Until we shed our skin
No more fears
No more lies
Just strong within

I want what I shouldn't
I tried but I couldn't
It's OK to feel like no one
Knows your name
They say
"Spend time for your riches
There's no rest for the wicked"
But that's what the evil say...
It's all just a game

When I thought that I was dead
It was all inside my head

Only hope brings a new light
We are the voices for the voiceless
