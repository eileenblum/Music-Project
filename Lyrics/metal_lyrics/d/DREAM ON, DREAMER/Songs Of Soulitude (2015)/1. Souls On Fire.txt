Death is not the answer
We're in this together
It's dragging us down
It's pulling us apart
Don't be scared to set your soul on fire
If we fall we'll rise
We'll rise again
And if we fall we will rise again

I think I'm slipping, I tried this so carefully but I always end up the same
Something in me doesn't want to keep repeating the same thing
You'll always end up the same
If you're not listening

Disappear from the floor to ceiling
Realize that the walls are leaving me I found a place in my head
Realize that I'm not gone just yet
Disappear from the floor to ceiling
Realize that the walls are leaving I met a man in my head
He said he's not ready to die just yet

Now I stand looking up again
After years of silence
Pushing on and falling back
Swimming in a pool of blood
On my way to hell
Through an endless sea of stars
It was cold and still
Drag me down pull me apart
Every time you feel alone
It's not the end of the world
Every time you feel alone
Just know I'm there

I think I'm slipping, I tried this so carefully but I always end up the same
Something in me doesn't want to keep repeating the same thing
You'll always end up the same
If you're not listening
Now I stand looking up again
After years of silence
Pushing on and falling back
Swimming in a pool of blood
On my way to hell
Through an endless sea of stars
It was cold and still
Drag me down pull me apart
