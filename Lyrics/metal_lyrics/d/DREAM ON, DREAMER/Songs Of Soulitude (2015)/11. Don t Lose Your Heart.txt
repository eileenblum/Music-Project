[Bonus Track]Are you lost somehow, drowning in the crowd?
Are you on your own again?
Right back at the start
Kid don't lose your heart
Until you're were you want to be.

Down at the cold steps, where no light exists
That's where you want to be, feeling sick
You find your hopes and your abandoned dreams
That's where you find your purpose.

Sometimes I take another breath,
Another step to embrace what I have
Then I stare at you, staring back
And I know that I'm not dead.
It takes a voice to make a change
It takes courage to not be the same
If the world is silenced today
I make sure to scream my name

Take it in and let it burn

Are you lost somehow, drowning in the crowd?
Are you on your own again?
Right back at the start
Kid don't lose your heart
Until you're where you want to be.

Don't lose your heart
There are pains in life
It won't be easy

Don't lose your heart
Part of being accepted
Is to accept yourself

Don't lose your heart
It's the pulse that beats
And your voice that speaks.

Don't lose your heart
If you're willing to change, willing to fight
Promise meâ¦

Don't lose your heart.

Remind yourself
You're breathing
Remind yourself
That you are bleeding

Are you lost somehow, drowning in the crowd?
Are you on your own again?
Right back at the start
Kid don't lose your heart
Until you're where you want to be.
