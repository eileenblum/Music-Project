I lost my heart in the sea where all the angels sing
"We want to lead you and oversee you
We've been waiting here for you."
All that's left is your conscious
Everything you tried to drown
"We're coming closer, we're coming closer."
And I can tell by the way your hands speak when I'm holding them
"Hold me nearer, hold me nearer."
If you say you really mean it
Then I want to be everything that you say
Everything that you say

From the ashes of our past
Wisdom shall grow
If we see the light I won't pray for the unknown
Will I be damned in hell if I don't follow your beliefs?
When everything is changing
When love is the only thing we need
We shouldn't have to feel alone
We shouldn't have to feel alone
If we loved ourselves weâ¦
If we loved ourselves weâ¦
We would love each other more
We would love each other more
If we loved ourselves weâ¦
We would love each other more
