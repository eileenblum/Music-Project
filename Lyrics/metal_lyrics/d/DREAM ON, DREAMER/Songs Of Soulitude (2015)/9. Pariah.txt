Welcome back to the world
Believe in what you are told
We get confused, so we feel abused

Day in and day out I stare into an open sunset
Waiting for the dark to arise
Oh god I'm feeling so blessed
Devour all good we have left

I can't speak through my mouth when it's moving
I can't sleep cause like I'm losing the fight
You had something to love but you fucked it
Hold it in, this time just swallow your pride

Welcome back to the world
Surrender is the only way out
You're just a number dead or alive
Day in and day out

I can't speak through my mouth when it's moving
I can't sleep cause like I'm losing the fight
You had something to love but you lost it
Hold it in, this time just swallow your pride

It's the reason you're bent and you're broken
It's the reason you're not gonna give up the fight
You had something to love but you lost it
Hold it in, this time just swallow your pride

You're all just like me
Lose blood and break bone
Move stone to get home
Just to find what you believe

You're all just like me cause you're all just like me
We share the same hopes, choke on the same ropes...

I left my heart in the dark
Where it can't be seen
Thousand open wounds
They won't be hurting me
I'm the black sheep
That doesn't come when you call
Just treat me with respect
We're all made from flesh and bones

I'm stuck like a thorn in your eyes
I turn every living hour from day into night
I want you stab my soul once again
It's not gonna hurt
We are here until the end
It's not gonna hurt
We are here until the end
No it's not gonna hurt
Cause I refuse to be anything like them
Anything like you
I refuse to be anything like you
