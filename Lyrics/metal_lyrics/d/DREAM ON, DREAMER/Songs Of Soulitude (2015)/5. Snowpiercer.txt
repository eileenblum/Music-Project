As its passing by
All the time
It's a constant climb
As we forget the things we know
So where do we all go this time?
You said that I could rest awhile?
Did I get the feeling wrong
All we do is wait in line
Hoping just to lose our time, when you're on your own
You were on your own

The streetlights on again
I walk without a name
Strangely beloved, yet unrequited,
Do you feel like you missed it
There's safety in your eyes
To walk without disguise
I was wrong and you were right
There's no need to lie

Your giving it away this time,
How could you ignore your mind?
When you were on your own,
You were on your own

Your giving it away this time,
How could you ignore your mind?
When you were on your own,
You were on your own

I'll be careful with the soft spots I'll be smart,
If you're careful with my heart.
Everybody gets lost somehow
It's where we were meant to start
Now I was right and you were wrong
Every single night I sleep alone
You see some men can't face defeat
Some let it leak into their bones...

But not me,
I'm not scared of the things that I love,
It's with them that I sleep at night when the devil comes.

Listen, it was there right from the start, all along.
It was there right from the start, all along, it was there right from the start, all along.

I'm giving it away this time
How could you ignore your mind?
When you were on your own
You were on your own
Don't throw it all away this time,
Only just to lose you're mind
When you were on your own

When you were on your own
When you were on your own
