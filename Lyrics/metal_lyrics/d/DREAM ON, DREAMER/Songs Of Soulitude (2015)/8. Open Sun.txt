A visionary scene of bliss as we both stared into the infinite
Hidden hands drawing you in
All created by a nameless king
In peace together as on
We walk towards the open sun
What happened to the joy we shared
I know that nothing is permanent
I miss the truth
I miss the feel and I miss us being real

The words in my mouth set the screen
No, you don't understand me
I've been holding my breath in this room for years
And there's always something in the darkest corners of my mind
It keeps me alive
Tell me the truth
Don't tell me a lie
I want you to feel I want you to see I want you to know
Just know that this is real
There's a million different reasons why you're wasting all your time
Eternal, eternal eyes, holding the key to eternal life
How are we going to find out?
Who we are and what we love?
Are you connected to your heart?
Are you connected to yourself?
I want you to feel I want you to see I want you to know
Just know that this is real
There's a million different reasons why you're wasting all your time
Eternal, eternal eyes, holding the key to eternal life

Hey listen up
We speak of heaven and hell as if it's something that we've all been through
But usually, starting with a voice of reason, there's a landslide of people seeking the truth Mr.Self-righteous...
I'm talking to you
You've got some fucking nerve kid
You can't speak with a mouth of stones
You can't preach with a false set of bones
