It seems like this road
It doesn't go anywhere
It doesn't stop
But still we have to pretend

It's okay when your heart stops
Swallow, it will feel the same
Like everybody else does
Don't cry just numb the pain
(Don't try to hide the pain)

Cause it won't stop until your heart drops out
Don't think twice just chase the sound
No it wont stop till your heart gives out
Don't lose yourself to the crowd, of here and now

We're addicted to this thing
They call medicine
It won't beat your fears nor hide your tears
We're addicted to this thing
They call medicine
It won't beat your fears nor hide your tears

Cause it won't stop until your heart drops out
Don't think twice just chase the sound
No it wont stop till your heart gives out
Don't lose yourself to the crowd, of here and now

How can you think
We're blind enough
That with broken spines
We get ourselves back up?

You separate the good from the bad,
The poor from the rich and born from the dead

We get ourselves back up
We get ourselves back up back up
