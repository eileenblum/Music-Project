[Bonus Track]Here I am alone
Watching demons sing
I've feared their smiles
When they stared at me
Out of darkness springs the light.
From the fire we ignite.

I can feel it.
Can you feel it too?
My heart has placed itself right next to you.

We've lost the moon,
When we swallowed the sun
And then we realized we were not the only ones

We were not the only ones...

Who fight like we do
Who love like we do

If you could see the things I've seen,
There's a bright side to suffering.
It doesn't matter what you think,
You know that we're all the same.
It shows your colors and sheds your skin.
Where do you go, where have you been?

We have to wake up
Before we fall asleep
Hands on the pulse
Till it fucking beats

Here I am alone
Watching demons sing
I've feared their smiles
When they stared at me
Out of darkness springs the light.
From the fire we ignite.

I was dancing with the devil
I was kneeling to the cross
There is one thing I can promise:
Love is my only god.

If you could see the things I've seen
There is a bright side of suffering.
Show your colours
Shed your skin
Where have you gone?
Where have you been?

Where have you been?
Where have you been?
