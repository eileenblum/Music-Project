Itâs like every breath I take is a debt.
How am I going to pay it back by myself?
Like breathing without air.
How am I going to know that youâre there when youâre not?
So why canât death set me free?
I'm breathing but I canât believe in what Iâm seeing.
When I looked into your eyes life lost its meaning.
There is no such thing as failure let my words just be your savior.
Iâm still looking for the answer.
I hold my heart until the end.

Accept my flaws for life.
Accept me into your life.
Accept the person who I am will never give up this fight.
We always wake up from the deepest of our dreams just a little late.
Can you relate?
I see your backs have turned away.

When all the lights have been switched off, way too dark for you to see
Thatâs exactly my point when life suffocates me.
Iâm always trying not to worry, everything will be fine.
Iâm sick of empty promises and the fear in my eyes.

Itâs like every breath I take is a debt.
How am I going to pay it back by myself?
Like breathing without air.
How am I going to know that youâre there when youâre not?
So why canât death set me free?
Oh why canât love stay with me.
When all the lights have been switched off, way too dark for you to see.
And the loveless walk to the edge of the world with hope to be set free.

Because I live between the pages, thereâs no gain where love is lost.
Iâd burn the world, just to show you I love you most.
This dreamâs my one foundation, my futureâs held to sleep.
The only way I know, how to set myself free.

There is one thing Iâve learned and in fact I'm quite aware.
If the world wants to see you fall it only takes one second to spare.
Iâve got my eyes wide open so treat me right.
Iâve got my hands on my heart so I feel alive.
Iâve realized that the end isnât suicide.
I was born to live until I die.
