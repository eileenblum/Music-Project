Don't you take it away from me,
All the lights that shine so continuously.
You must be the one
Who lives inside me and guides my way.
Nothing is too hard to achieve
If you turn everything into an opportunity.
You show me what it means to follow my goals, to follow you home.

From struggle to a strength we become a heart of all men.
My advice is to follow you.
I'd advise you to follow through.
Somehow, I'm sure someday
I want to lift the weight of the world.
Hold it in my hands.
Feel the heat burn down my chest.

The air we breathe holds us together now.
The air we breathe in.
Where are the bright skies holding us together now.
Holding us together now.

Don't you take it away from me,
All the lights that shine so continuously.
You must be the one
Who lives inside me and guides my way.
Nothing is too hard to achieve
If you turn everything into an opportunity.
You show me what it means to follow my goals, to follow you home.

Follow you home.
Follow you home.
Follow you home.
Follow you home.

I said I'd follow you home.
All that I am is all around me.
We were born the same yet all die differently.
Don't feel threatened by a change.
Listen to the world calling your name.
For as long as we see, (For as long as we see)
For as long as we breathe, (For long as we breathe)
As long as we breathe we have the chance to make a difference. (To make a difference)
