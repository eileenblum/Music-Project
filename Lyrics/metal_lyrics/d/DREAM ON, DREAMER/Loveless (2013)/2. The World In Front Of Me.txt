I've got the world in front of me.
We are the ones to full fill our dreams
We're the storm chasing those lies away

Are you strong enough to be leaving?
Are you old enough to believe inâ¦

The fear is deep, the vision clear.
But what am I suppose to see?

It's all in your head, no clarity
Leave behind who you used to be.

Overcome your fears and sing
"We are the reasons for tomorrow's end"

We can change it all. We can stop this fall.
We are the children of the new world.

See you at the brightest of all skies
See you at the darkest of my nights.
Step by step I come alive
Years and years go by

I've got the world in front of me.

The fear is deep, the vision clear.
But what am I suppose to see?

It's all in your head, no clarity
Leave behind who you used to be.

Overcome your fears and sing
"We are the reasons for tomorrow's end"

We can change it all. We can stop this fall.
We are the children of the new world.

I'm ready to take on
what was put in my way.
If I hear that voice again I know
I've got the world in front of me.

Right in front of me

If you're lost and alone how am I meant to know?
Cause I'm just trying to help you out,
and every time I hear your voice
I've got the world in front of me

I still have your words in my head
They sound exactly like they used to
I'm sorry I didn't know what it was like
To be trapped and alone inside.

We are the ones to full fill our dreams
We're the storm chasing those lies away

Are you strong enough to be leaving?
Are you old enough to believe inâ¦
