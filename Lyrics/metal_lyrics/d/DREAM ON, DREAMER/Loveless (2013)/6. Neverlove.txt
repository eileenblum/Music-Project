All I fear is love. 
Let the world carry you, Neverlove will save you...
What feels like the end is the start of something new.
I know my scars will never truly heal. 
It haunts, it breaks me, Neverlove will never leave me

It's better to have lost you than never having loved at all.
This time I won't be there shivering right beside you.
For too long I've held these hands, followed hearts that never lived.
This time I promise you Neverlove will come and get you

All I fear is love
I know my wounds will never disappear.
It haunts, it breaks me, Neverlove will never leave me.

It's better to have lost you than never having loved at all.
This time I won't be there shivering right beside you.
For too long I've held these hands, followed hearts that never lived.
This time I promise you Neverlove will come and get you

It haunts me... It breaks me and I just can't give it away.
I want it... I need it... Neverlove will never leave me.
Embrace your memories, your past will now be seen.
Let's make history.
Neverlove will set me free.
Will set me free

All I ever feared is to love something beautiful.
It's better to have lost you than never having loved at all.
This time I won't be there shivering right beside you.
For too long I've held these hands, followed hearts that never lived.
This time I promise you Neverlove will come and get you
