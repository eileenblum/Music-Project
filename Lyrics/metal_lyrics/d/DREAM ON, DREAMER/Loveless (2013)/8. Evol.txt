I wake up,
All I want to do is shut my eyes again.

No this isn't who I am.
What on earth have I become?

You must be the light
Shining brighter from the inside.
You make love seem so alive.
Yeah I forgot what it feels like.
To love is to risk not being loved in return.
If you let it go and it doesn't come back you're better off alone.

If loving you is the risk
Would you love me in return
And if you dare to let this go
You're better off alone.

Nothing, nothing can explain the way you change me.
Nothing, nothing can explain the way you change me.

I keep forgetting,
I'm relying on a dream that has no fear of hurting me.
If I go back to sleep you will haunt me again.
I see your presence lurking out from a distance.
This can't be real, oh no.
I see you staring but your face is fiction.
This can't be who I see.
You must be the light
Shining brighter from the inside.
You make love seem so alive.
Yeah I forgot what it feels like.

I'm sinking,
I'm losing hope in everything.
I keep sinking,
I keep losing hope in everything.

I keep sinking,
I keep losing hope.
