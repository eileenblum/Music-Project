As the sun comes up
I feel the marks have never worn off.
I burned my name into the cold world.
And as the daylight dies.
It goes to show what weâve sacrificed.
These are the tracks we leave behind.

Memories of a golden time
I was a young man
Searching for the keys to my mind
And now I know when the skin falls from my bones.
Iâll be remembered from now until forever.

I look forward to a time (A time)
Where my life will be looked back on. (Back on)
When the tracks we leave behind (We left behind)
Will be used as inspiration.

It takes a while to let it go.
The only way I know for sure
That Iâm alright.

There is nothing you canât accomplish.
Look back on all the things youâve done,
Be proud of what youâve become.
Look back on all the things youâve done,
Be proud of what youâve become.

Memories of a golden time
I was a young man
Searching for the keys to my mind
And now I know when the skin falls from my bones.
Iâll be remembered from now until forever.

The greatest gift in life
Is the feeling to be recognised.
For years Iâve been screaming my lungs out.
Young at heart Iâve asked myself so many questionsâ¦

What am I capable of?
What is there to be scared of?
You need desires
stronger than anything
in order to achieve something.

In the old way with the new things that I canât explain
I donât want it to
Pull your mind into
But I canât breathe
with the hatred that fills my lungs
Itâs burning away my,
my, my soul

In the old way with the new things that I canât explain
I donât want it to
Pull your mind into
But I canât breathe
with the hatred that fills my lungs
Itâs burning away my soul
My soul,
My soul,
My soul
All my love was lost.
