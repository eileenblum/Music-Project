At the end of the day we are all the same.
With honesty we can achieve anything.
We can achieve anything!
Donât waste a possibility, donât wait for a chance to end.
Put your soul into what you love and make history instead.
Whichever way you choose to go it all happens for a reason.
We can all be there in the end, if you donât fear to fall to hell.

I wont hide my pride anymore.
I want to fill my heart with love.

I want to see the depths in things.
All you need is persistence.
At the end of the day we are all the same.
With honesty we can achieve anything.
We can achieve anything!
Donât waste a possibility donât wait for a chance to end.
Put your soul into what you love and make history instead.
Whichever way you choose to go, It all happens for a reason.
We can all be there in the end, if you donât fear to fall to hell.

Donât just watch me riseâ¦
Be the one who rises with me.
Donât just watch me rise.

Donât ever stop halfway through.
I can see the fuel to your fire.
I like the pain as the flame hits my eyes.
All the memories saved inside me, I now call mine.
