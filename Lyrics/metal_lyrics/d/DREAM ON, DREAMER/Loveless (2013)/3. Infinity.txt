Remember if you feel like you're rising.
Don't let anybody bring you down.
Be proud of the life you've created.

Every breath you take is starting to make sense.
Just follow my gaze, it will lead you up to the stars.
Come down in silence and settle where the oceans are.
So hold my hand in yours and never let me go.
Stuck in the cold this time, without a heart you'll never grow.
Remember who you are when you're falling from the stars.
You've got the world to gain. So remember who you are.

When you feel held down just know in your heart.
Life is the chance to prove yourself.
Prove yourself!

So hold my hand in yours and never let me go.
Stuck in the cold this time, without a heart you'll never grow.
Remember who you are when you're falling from the stars.
You've got the world to gain. So remember who you are.

World I never wanted you to step out of your cage but it's time for you to let me in.
I said world I want to thank you for lending me your ears.
This is who I am.

What your eyes are seeing, what your soul is believing,
What your hands are feeling is created for a reason.

What your eyes are seeing, your soul is believing,
What your hands are feeling is created for a reason.
