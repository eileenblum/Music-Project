I feel your presence fade away.
No, I won't give a fuck.

This is what it feels like,
When I'm climbing up your walls.
Don't ruin my progress,
Don't catch me when I fall.
A solid ground of truth.
Even though I'm on my own,
I will never pull back from the eye of the storm.

I buried the time you begged me to stay.
How could I ever think that this was the end?
I thought I could never get over this.

This is what it feels like,
When I'm climbing up your walls.
Don't ruin my progress,
Don't catch me when I fall.
A solid ground of truth.
Even though I'm on my own,
I don't feel alone right now.
Until I'm strong enough too.

If this is all I could have held onto are you really moving on.
I carried everything I couldn't leave,
I'm stronger than you know.

Something has changed in me,
About the way I feel but I won't give up.
Something has changed in me,
About the way I feel but I won't give up.

I've been alone and seen the worst,
These dreams are always keeping me awake.
I've learnt that holding onto hope
Won't ever let you down. (Down, Down)

I've learnt that holding onto hope
Won't ever let you down. (Down, Down)
It's a dream that doesn't sleep they say
So why do we dream at all?
I've been alone and seen the worst.
I've held your hand just to remind myself
How good it felt to let go.
How good it felt to let go of you.
How good it felt to let go.
How good it felt to let go of you.
How good it felt to let go.
How good it felt to let go of you.
