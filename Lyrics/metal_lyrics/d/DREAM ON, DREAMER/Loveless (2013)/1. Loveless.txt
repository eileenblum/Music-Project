Sometimes I feel like I've been parting away
with this so called world that has been fallen asleep.
Inside me, I can hear the voices, I can hear them calling.
Every time I look death right in the eyes. I see my fears crawl back to life.
From the out do nothing is show. All love, all hope is gone.

If you were missing me I'll try to stay alone.
If your soul is free will it ever find a home?
If you were missing me I'll try to stay alone.

My state of insecurity has pulled me into darkness.
All you need is integrity and a life for the loveless.
This is the sound of the Loveless. Can you hear it?
Accept the warmth of the Loveless. Can you feel it?
There're doorways waiting for you I want you to hear this my friend.
Step into the moment of truth.

Lets rise back up again. [2x]

Your mind will lead the way
