I see the world as an entire
When Iâm most alone.
Iâll walk a mile,
Just to take the throne.

We all have one wing,
But together we can fly away
I see myself doubting everything,
And everyone because itâs you
I sing this song to now.
Iâll walk alone as this is what lifeâs like now.
The cold will never be so cold, this is because of you
This is because of you.

Thereâs no life with clean breaks.
Or no chance we canât take.
Forgiveness lies too deep
To be vanished away.

So flawless from the outside.
Never trust a stranger.
Farewell to our hearts
Remember the so called desire
A brand new spirit destiny,
Wonât let my mind play tricks on me.
Closed chapters, opened curtains
To let myself be focused.

Through coldest nights we found ourselves marching.
Summer nights were meant to save us,
And stop us from aching.
I donât need another tragic ending,
No time for precious glorifying.
Whatâs left in me will be better shortly.

I learnt too much, Iâve seen it all
Was love suppose to feel like this?
I can only run away
Let my past drown inside of me.
Let go and leave it all behind.

Thereâs no life with clean breaks.
No chance we canât take.
Forgiveness lies to deep
To be vanished away.

When you piece it all together
Fragments of affection, come crawling back together
It will never stop unless you make it,
And grab the chances you have so take it.
