When the dark throws you down, and you learn to survive
You wake up and remember what it's like to be alive.

When I'm the sun, I'll count the worlds and make them mine.

I'm sick of making all the same mistakes over (and over) again
Will I ever be left alone to mend?
I'll never make all the same mistakes over and over again
Now I've seen what I could become
And I don't want to.

I carried these burdens for too long.
Went along with all the mess.
But it has made me who I am today,
Still standing after all these years.

We are the living dead
We are the living dead
We are the living dead

I know that this life is in our hands
And I know that we wont last forever
But let's make this chance our last.
Don't be scared of any new endeavors.

When I'm the sun,
I'll count the worlds and make them mine.
Because when I'm the sun,
I'll count the worlds and make them mine.

I'm sick of making all the same mistakes over (and over) again
Will I ever be left alone to mend?
I'll never make all the same mistakes over and over again
Now I've seen what I could become,
I don't want to become that no more.
I'm over it, and I'm over it all...

Stop pretending our world will keep turning.
