[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]SHOW ME WHAT MY DREAMS ARE MADE OF!

Believe me, we're coming home
We keep marching cause we're heading north
With the sun, guiding into every song
I swear we won't fail, we be taking too long
We shape our world with hands of stone
No matter how far we've come
Sleepless nights are our closest friends
With no clouds above my head
Keep singing,

In your own head, you feel the light dim fast
Find it and look no further
Deep inside, hiding from yourself
I won't hold you back no longer

What we said we want, we said we could
What you said we were, we ended up being
What we said we want, we said we could
What you said we were, we ended up being

When you burn for something
You're left with nothing
When you burn for something
You're left with nothing

When I swallow the fire, it doesn't burn no more
When I swallow the fire, it doesn't burn no more
It only sets alight the sparkle, in order to end this war
When I swallow the fire, it doesn't burn no more
It only sets alight the sparkle, in order to end this war

Show me what my dreams are made of

Believe me, we're coming home
We keep marching cause we're heading north
With the sun, guiding into every song
I swear we won't fail, we be taking too long
We shape our world with hands of stone
No matter how far things seem to become
Sleepless nights are our closest friends
With no clouds above my head
Keep singing

When you burn for something
You're left with nothing
