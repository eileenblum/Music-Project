This is what I had left when the sun began to fade.
This is all I ever felt would bring the fear in your eyes.
This is what I had left when the sun began to fade.
This is what I had kept in mind as we began to rise.

Do you believe we are the only ones?
Seems like we are the only ones, 
Who accept everything and get told nothing.

Will it be the same as it always was
Is it something that I always dreamt it could but never was.
Too many things remain untold
Donât hide your tongues. Donât hide at all.

Can you see whatâs changed, it wonât stay the same 
And now you take away the things I always dreamt about.
Too many things remain untold
Donât hide your tongues. Donât hide at all.

This isnât a joke for me, this is me not knowing what to believe.

You will stand your ground as the sky comes down.
You will stand your ground as the sky comes down.

Question everything.

I do not fear failure
Even when screamed it in my face
Iâve traveled on nothing to nowhere
Iâm here to hear my faith

I do not fear failure
Even when screamed in my face
So Iâll adapt you to all my surroundings
And thank all who took my place

Will it be the same as it always was
Is it something that I always dreamt it could but never was.

Too many things remain untold
Donât hide your tongues. Donât hide at all.

Could you see whatâs changed, it wonât stay the same 
And now you take away the things I always dreamt about.

Too many things remain untold
Donât hide your tongues. Donât hide at all.

Take to the skies, with your brothers
Question everything, question everything
Sing to the lost, with each other.
And you will love again, and you will love again.
