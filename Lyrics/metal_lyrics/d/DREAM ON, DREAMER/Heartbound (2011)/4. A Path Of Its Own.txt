Searching for whatâs too hard to find.
Expressing me being left behind.
All I ever wanted,
Has opened its eyes.

On my own for so many years.
Been trapped, been chased, been fighting fears.
Iâve seen the dead with its fake blushed smile ahead.
I choose to follow my dreams instead.

So who the fuck do you think you are?

I wonât float away, wonât let this grief abandon me.
Giving up our hearts, for the life we dedicate.
