[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Making my way downtown
walking fast
faces pass
and I'm homebound
Staring blanky ahead
just making my way
making a way
through the crowd

And I need you
and I miss you
and now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
do you think time would pass me by
'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
if I could just see you...tonight

It's always times like these
when I think of you
and I wonder if you ever think of me
'cause everything's so wrong
and I don't belong
living in your precious memory

'cause I need you
and I miss you
and now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
do you think time would pass me by, oh
'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
if I could just see you...tonight

And I, I don't wanna let you know
I, I drown in your memory
I, I don't wanna let this go
I, I don't

Making my way downtown
walking fast
faces pass
and I'm homebound
Staring blankly ahead
just making my way
making a way
through the crowd

And I still need you
and I still miss you
and now I wonder

If I could fall into the sky
do you think time would pass us by
'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
if I could just see you, oh

If I could fall into the sky
do you think time won't pass me by
'cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
if I can just see you
if I can just hold you...tonight
