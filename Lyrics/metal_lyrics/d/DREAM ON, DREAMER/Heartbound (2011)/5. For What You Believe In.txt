All thatâs said.
Has nothing to do with the way I want to see the world

And now whatâs left?
I canât find the answers to
The questions in my head

You know weâve seen it all.
We met the ones that live no more.
Deceived your children you said you loved
Fooled the ones that stood up for you.
Your light will shine on, until everyone receives
The hidden words of a million hearts.
Behold your faith and carry on

They make no sound, when theyâre coming after you
And I canât hear you screaming out my name.

Conquer the flags and capture your legs.
Stand for what you believe in.

Conquer the flags and capture your legs.
The only ones that keep you from breathing.

Stand for what you believe in.
The only ones that keep you from breathing.

Breathe in, breathe out
Behold your true faith and carry on

Read the headlinesâ¦
What they say is anything but real.

Now listen to what they tell you
Nothing else will be retold
These are the terms they gave you
Walk away without a soul

Because voices remain and mark your names.

If you take your hands from your eyes
You donât know where we have been and died tonight
With your eyes shut and reinforced
They wonât stop until you pray for gold.
As they begin to introduce their stories
Enlighten all their bodies.
What they do is pull you in,
Have we forgotten how to deal with them?

Weâre victims of stories
That donât make sense to us.

And we are victims of stories,
That donât make any fucking sense.
