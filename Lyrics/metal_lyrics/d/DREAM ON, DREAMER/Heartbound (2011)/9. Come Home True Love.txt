When every heart that you loved has gone insane,
When the smoke in your lungs doesnât feel the same,
And the pain in your head just won't go away
When souls donât remember your fucking name

Every word that you spat out was a single mistake
Are we just cursed or dead? Thereâs no room to escape
With lights shining bright and no goals to make,
Was everything I asked too much guilt to take?

You made me hate what I used to fucking love
Made up stories that seemed like they were send straight from above

They canât measure heart,
When love isnât what I want

Yet Iâm still here shaking
Yet Iâm still here believing

How can they measure my heart?
Does it go off the love or how many times Iâve been a broken man? 
Or how many times you left me here

When home doesnât feel like home,
Did you ever look at a picture of yourself? 
Itâs not the person that I see now
And home doesnât feel like home
No more, that stranger is you

Itâs time for letting goâ¦
Of everything I loved about you to
be washed away by those dreams and
Grabbed by better hearts I should have known right from the start

Of everything I loved about you to
be washed away by those dreams
Grabbed by better hearts I
should have known from the start

My hands around depression
My past to the crows

With both feet on the ground
I wont pick you up this time
Drowned everything I knew would hold me down.

You picked up the stones which were meant to stay forever
You teared down walls that were built to stay strong together

I've written songs about you
I wasted nights dreaming about you
I told the whole fucking world about you
Spent every day thinking about youâ
About you.
