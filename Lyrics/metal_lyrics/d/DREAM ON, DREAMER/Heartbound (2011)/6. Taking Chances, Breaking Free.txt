Burning passion against your gunfights.

We are the new bred hope
Minds wide focused on an endless road.

Never strayed from our path.
Donât forget that we came, stayed and will forever last.

The only difference between you and me
Is that you were scared of where you would be.

Iâm holding this child and call it love
Grab our history that we were tired of.

Iâm holding this gift and call it life.
After breaking chains everything becomes alive.

Everything becomes alive.

Have you ever believed in something?
Listened to tongues that shouldnât mean anything.

It goes on and on and I felt so alone
As I grew up and grew old life began to unfold
Heavy hearts filled with hope and the truth will be
That there is something there but nothing wrong with me.

And the truth will be
That there is nothing wrong with me.

With my head against those walls.
My eyes were covered, my hands tied up
And Iâm still the same as I used to be,
Sailing oceans just to be seen.

Taking chances, breaking free.

Thereâs one thing that I never did, its called giving up.

It goes on and on and I felt so alone
As I grew up and grew old life began to unfold
Heavy hearts filled with hope and the truth will be
That there is something there but nothing wrong with me.

And the truth will be that there is nothing wrong with me.
