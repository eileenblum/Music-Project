Judas gave away the Son of Man
When he was praying in the Garden
Angry apostles cried:
"Master! May we raise our swords?"
The time of darkness' power's come
The flame was stifled with envy
Caught by the chief priest
Battered with sticks
Peter was one of the disciples
Satan insisted on his death
The master asked him not to lose his faith
"Master", said Peter, "with you I'm ready to go to death."
"Don't swear! Today you'll deny me."
In the yard fire flared
They were sitting in a circle
Treacherous flames shone on their faces
"Galilean! You were with him. Your name is Peter."
"It isn't me, I don't know him"
The first cock crowed.
"You were with him. Your name is Peter."
"It isn't me, I don't know him"
The second cock crowed.
"You were with him. You - Simon Peter."
"It isn't me, I don't know him"
The third cock crowed.
Traitor denied three times for the fear of death.
Is it a sin?
When the cock crowed the third time
The master turned his eyes to Peter's face
He felt the bitterness of loss and shame
He left, conquered by fear.
