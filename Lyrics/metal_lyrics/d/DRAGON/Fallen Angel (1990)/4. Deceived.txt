Now you feel only pain
The scream vibrates
Terrible palms of fire caress you
Behind the throne of death no one is waiting
In fire - death!
Crime, man, verdict - suffer at the stake
For your thoughts the fiery king will devour you
Trampled - step by step you are crawling along
People are spitting on you

Where is your Lord now?
He deceived you, swindled and you are alone
Long nights of torture, bestial roar
Torture instructed you in your insanity
You are alone, the Lord laughs
You are wailing alone - heaven is hell
You are burning - he has won
You want to cry but you can't
Wild torment is tearing your throat apart
Satan, help me
I implore on my knees for your favour
At the last moment of pain I'm selling my life
Take my soul

Your Lord - a traitor, Satan - an oppressor
They are amused, you are dying
Your torment is their fun
The sweet sound of your scream

The ruler of the night is amused
Each of your groans is his delight
The Lord presents him with a soul
In return for the debt
