I am sitting in darkness, on the throne, in the fire of waves,
The Lord of creatures, my power reaches heaven's gates
Down on your knees, turn your prayers to me!
I'm your Lord, you're my amusing flock!
Through the prism of the night I'm looking at your wicked world
I burst out laughing when the flower of war blooms in flames
You miserable puppets, you dance to my tune
Cruel desire, I'm kindling in you a killing madness!

My heart turned black long ago, far from here
My evil thoughts devour the leprosy of wrath
I once spat down the drain and you originated
No one will save you, you'll serve only me
My soul longs for your blood
I want you to live in torture
Under curse: die and decay into blackness!
Countless are sacrifices which you'll bring me
Millions of souls which the turmoil of holy war will draw in

Your souls are evil, I poisoned, with blackness, your dreams
It's me who's flinging torches among you
So that in the horde's eyes explodes the flash of madness
Death is the title of the song which I'm playing today
I slip swords into hands, watching their cruel dance
