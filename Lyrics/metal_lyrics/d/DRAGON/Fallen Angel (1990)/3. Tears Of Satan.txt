I'm handing in chains
Infernal fire burns and tortures my body
I'm silent, too proud to cry
But I beg you to pity my soul
A bitter tear in my eye - I meant the best
I created the whole world of love
The Father envious of his power
The power of his fist has crushed me
Tears of Satan - I'm still a Son of God
Spurned, thrust down into the abyss
Tears of Satan - I am alone
I am silently crying
All's lost
Eternal darkness
No limit to my suffering
The hatred of the crowd follows me
Tears of Satan - I'm still a Son of God
