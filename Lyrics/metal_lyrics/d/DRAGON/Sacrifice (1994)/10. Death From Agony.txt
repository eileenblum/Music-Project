One day I saw
Dying man
Iâve stand over him
Felt disgust and compassion
I havenât seen his eyes
Iâve seen begeting death
Death begeting from agony
Death begeting from pain
Iâve heard the vioce of your world
Iâve heart your mercy
Iâve heart frightened and blind
Now Iâm thinking about agony
Thinking of suffering
I think when Iâll go away
Closed mouth
Say anything now
But thereâs all in the silence
And agony is saying herself
Oh, alien world
Burning
Tell, how to make you and ruin as well
âCause the death itâs only a mercy
Oh, alien world
Burning
Iâve heard your voice
Thinking of suffering
Silent with worse irony
I hear your voices
