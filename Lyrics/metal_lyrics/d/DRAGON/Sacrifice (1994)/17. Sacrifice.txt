Iâm giving you
My body
My rotted brain
Observe it precisely
Because that is the most foul thing
That you havenât seen earliner
Thereâs the pus in my veins
In my stomach worms are multipling
Crawling in the gut
Itâs difficult to breath
To have desire
Vegetation of live, Iâm living
Perhaps it is whole knowledge
Whole truth
If it is â I am a wiseman
Life is my sacrifice
Iâm giving you
My body
You can do everything
But donât mock at it
Iâve given you my body
