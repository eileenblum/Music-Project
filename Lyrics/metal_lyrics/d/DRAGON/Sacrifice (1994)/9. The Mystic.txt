Thatâs the end of my life
The time to get out has just come
The door are open
Of my life, of my death
Thatâs happened out of me

I was born to die
Iâve died to return
The mystic of death

From the other side of the world
My faceâs picture disappeared
The matter doesnât exist now
I joined the bevy
Of alive and dead
I donât search the retreat
The peace of nirvana

I was born to die
Iâve died to return
The mystic of death

I was born to die

I know theyâre like me
I can feel their presence, they can stay
But I know Iâve got to go
To return to become perfect
What does it mean the perfact

I feel I return
Iâm leaving nirvana
I feel I return
To born as a baby?
To born as an oldish?

The mystic of life
The mystic of death
