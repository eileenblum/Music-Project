I live and it seems to me
My life itâs a verdict
Lack of stable
Deformation of thoughts
Destroying old views
Incessant changes
Dreams that havenât fulfiled
Iâve been sent to that place
To make evil
Like a harpoon tearing
Gut of devil
Living and suffering
From inside of forebode
I extract the murder fire
Burning friendly hands
Making cheap good
Iâm in the dung
Of humanâs suffers â why?
Living and suffering
