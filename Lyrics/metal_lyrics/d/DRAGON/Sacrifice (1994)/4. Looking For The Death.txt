Open wounds
Of eternal victims
Gods â always demanded for manâs blood
Beating hearts of saint war
Sacrificed to the bloody sun

Mankind joins
Life and death
Rotting gut
Thrown for the gorge
Of hungry beasts
Thatâs the recollection of man

Massacre of thoughts
The wordâs slavery
The despair like shadow
Always near
The night chains cold
Like ice
Closed
In the mass of fear
Thatâs the recollection
Of man

Whole world
Stays in the sin
Full of spite, avidity and foulness
Looking for the death â chase
Loneliness â incessant changes
