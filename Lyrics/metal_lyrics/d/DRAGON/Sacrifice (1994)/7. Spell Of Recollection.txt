Night - black crystal
Moon faded long ago
Someoneâs sorrow has gushed tear
Someoneâs face has gone

Many shadows have gone past
And it seems to me
That someoneâs breath has left

Life is going by like a smoke
Leaving behind a stripe of recollection
And only tear will leave
In your grave

But I love the speel of recollection
Sad charm of the past
And I wonder in thoughts
Over the way forging from bronze

That night â the wind went mad
That night â the moon darkened
