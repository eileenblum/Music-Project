Master âwhom theyâre
Their sure dusk
Over the great river
The death has died here

Master â whatâs going on with me
Everytime I can hear the voices
Hereâs darker existence
For them
Than there
Flits so quick
Whoâd believe
That death caught
So many

The world didnât let them
To last in glory
Mercy and judgement
Donât help them
Behind the river
An immense black
Winds
Showing the route
Of unworthy rest
Master â hereâs a fear

I can see the death
Itâs getting near
Help me â take
Me back

The circles narrow
The bridges reveal
The sufferâs sea
Thereâs wilderness behind
With the sight imprisoned
In the brain
Where you go

Master â whom theyâre
