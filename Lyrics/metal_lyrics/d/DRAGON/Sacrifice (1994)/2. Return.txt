On the other side of heaven â brightness
Magnificent light goes on
I have left my body motionless
Some people mourn for it
They canât understand real freedom
They weep for my prison, the cage of soul
The pictures of life shows the pass
The pieces of life Iâve lived over
Iâm going to the place full of love
The place I know I have seen
Iâm energy
Iâm a thought
But something Iâve lost
Darkness disturbs to my thoughts
Wonderful light is dying
Something is pulling me down
I can see my cage
Iâm energy
Iâm thought
I can see those people
I can feel uneasiness
That restrain my energy
I can feel the pain of thoughts
They donât cry
Iâm in my body again
Wounded body
Suffering body
Why I had to return?
Why I couldnât stay?
Iâve returned to my body
Wounded body
Why I had to return
Why?
Iâm energy
But Iâve lost something
