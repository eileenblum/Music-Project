Those flowers
Put into
The empty orbits of skulls
With inscription- the last farewell
This is for you
All that is yours:
Memory
Tears
Despair
The presence of sadness
There is yet no time
No this time, no their time
Not itâs only yours
Open your eyes and rise
Time for you
Time, time is yours
Time
Time is for you
Those trumpets
And the leather shoulder â strap of grave â diggers
Carrying you like on the throne
Memory â 
Tears
Despair
The presence of sadness
Time for you
Time, time is yours
Time
The staring eyes of hungry rats
Slinks behind the black pageant
This is for you that crazy pomp
With the speech over the open grave
With the drops of the holy water
And the spilling sand
