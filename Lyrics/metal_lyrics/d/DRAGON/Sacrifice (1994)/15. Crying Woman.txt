Midnight has spread out
Call of owl breaks silence
And sobs of a shape dressed in white
Crying woman

Voice
Desperate sorrow
She is rinsing her pain with blood
Crying woman

She gave him love and her virginity
He left her bared
Leaving empty nights behind
Crying woman

She fell to his knees
"See you have two childrenâ
He shouted: âGo awayâ
Crying woman

Madwoman rushes along the streets
Her dress is stained with blood
Her weeping will wake us up
Till the end of the system of those things

This mother, mother will be calling
Her children, children killed at night

My children are unhappy
