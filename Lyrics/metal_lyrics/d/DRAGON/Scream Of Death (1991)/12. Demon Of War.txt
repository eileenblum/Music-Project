Marana - the spirit
Come, now it's time
I'm slowly losing my strength
Demon's evil temptation
Demon's conflict
I live on top
Of a huge tower
Someone has put a knife in my back
Demon's evil temptation

Hell down below
Burning glow
Waterless desert in blood
Demon's . . .

Silence in ether
Hammering my head
Awareness, loneliness, and I
Demon's

A dying wreck
No sleep, no complaints
I'm waiting for death - it's him:
Demon
No one will tell me
Where i should go
Darkness and night
Silence of stars
Uranium veins
Throbbing with death

Crusader's sword
Has reaped all life
Held in the claws
Of the demon
No one will tell me
Where I should go
Darkness and night
Silence of stars
Uranium veins
Throbbing with death

Corpses in the streets
Corpses in the womb
This will be the end of the world
Demon's . . .
After the battle
Coming through the fog
Marana - the spirit
It's you
