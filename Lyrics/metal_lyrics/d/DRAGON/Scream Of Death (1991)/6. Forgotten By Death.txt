Shadows, fog
Sign of the fall
A dwarf, a face-a monster
Without form

You, son of void
Eyes in decay
The dust in throbbing
With dead life

Forgotten by death
You've become a thing
A relic
Forgotten by death
It's horrid not to be able to die

Eternal life
Forgotten
Where is death

Tangled in darkness
Forgotten
A blind sin

Catacombs
On the Tombs
You've built your grave

You long for fire
That brings you
Salvation

Only one desolate world
Only one home uprooted
Only one shadow behind
Only the desperate moan

Forgotten by death
Tell them after thousands of years
Forgotten by death
A witness of the age of doom
