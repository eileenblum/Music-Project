Darkness
Closed the day
Immense buildings
All collapsed
Ashes, darkness
The world
You have known
Is gone into nothingness
Darkness
Memory has gone
On the wings of struggle
Survive
Just survive
Blodd  for blood
Remote past
Destroyed by the hands
Of hideous soldiers
Blood for blood

Struggle for life
Where to go
In this turmoil
Of raging death
The air kills
With fire and dust
Deadly glow
Where to go
All is gone

Shadows
Just fade away
And you know
That's the end
