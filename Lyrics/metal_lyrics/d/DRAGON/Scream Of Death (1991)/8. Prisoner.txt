Sick mind with no past
Blends all days into eternal light

A sick face
A sick mind
A shadow of tomorrow
Maybe it's me

A prisoner with a shavel head
A prisoner of nuclear shelter
As horrified as me

A sick face
A sick mind
A shadow of tomorrow
Maybe it's me

Open graves
Trampled holiness
Where are you going
There's nothing there
But his hand gives me a sign
You're the labyrinth
Of madness
You're sinking
Into dead night

Take me with you
Into the burning abyss
Into the bottomless pit
With no respite

A sick face
A sick mind
A shadow of tomorrow
It must be me
Take me with you
In the dimensionless pit
Into the immense sea
Of schizophrenia
