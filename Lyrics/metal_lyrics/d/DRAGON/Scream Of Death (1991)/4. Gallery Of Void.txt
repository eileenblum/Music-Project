Trembling in pain
You're suffering
Heavy rattle
Asphalt is burning
Your feet sinking
In the dark

Blood
Streaming blood
You're dying
And you know it well
'Black spots are whirling
The painis  gone
The clock is ticking back
Faster and faster'

The void - engulfs
The light - is fading
The clouds - fall down
The cold - is freezing
The kingdom of ice

Suffering
You must watch
The doom
The fall
Into whiteness

Ice
Ice in your eyes
In your dead mouth
In every part
Of your body
