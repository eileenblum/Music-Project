Sound of alarm
Played
On dried bones
By the wind
Cacophony of hollow sounds
All lost in empty skulls

And craters only
Will remain
Unhealed by life
Packs of hungry bloodthirsty beasts
Will eat the rotting scraps
Of human flesh

I am alive
I'm simply
Still
Here
Living in pain
Dying
With no future
Chance
Shelters full of
Survivors
Places
Where to survive
Means to kill
- Cannibalism -
Grey gloomy hue
Of bony faces
Look at me
At your future
Look at your
Concrete
Grave.
