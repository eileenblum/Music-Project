How quickly seconds fly
Pendulum in my hands
A mutant
In hopeless desperation
I know that's my last day
The day when my world will be gone

Horizon blends with the sky
Into a black and terrible mass
A mutant

Bloody veins of lightning above
Rotten earth flooded with puss 
Full of lumps of dried magma
Where are you, the Almighty!

I hear a hollow rattle
Strangers all around
Their distorted faces
Their throbbing flesh

Eyes burnt out by acid
Tumor-speckled skin
Waiting
For me to become like them

God if you are there
In this great dark sea
Have mercy on me!

Stinking grease floods the ground
Absorbing monstrous mutants
The last day!
