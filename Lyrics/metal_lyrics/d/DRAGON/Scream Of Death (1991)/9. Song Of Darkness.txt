A bird in agony
A dying shadow
I'm like a boat
Taken in the wind

Something is coming
Whispering
The song of darkness
Like a bell

A voice
Underground echoes
I'm like a colour
That faded away

The song of darkness
Nearer
I know that death
Is coming

A stormy sea
And massive clouds
I'm like the ashes
Like a waning glow

I know I'm dying
Screaming
The sound of darkness
Like a bell
