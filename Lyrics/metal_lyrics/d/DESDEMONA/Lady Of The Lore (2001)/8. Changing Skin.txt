[music: F. Torchia/lyrics: A. Marchisio]

Once upon a time I saw a mighty angel
Once upon a time his aura did shine
All the heavenly creatures came to see this angel
But now his glory is lost in the sands of time

Who am I? Why am I here?
What are you looking for in my eyes?
Am I the answer to all of your questions
Or an idol that tells you lies?

Changing skin, holy wine has made me thirsty
Dying like a martyr is not enough to be Christ
Changing skin, all this singing has made me deaf
Once upon a time I saw an angel and the angel was me

Once upon a time I saw a scary devil
Once upon a time his nails scratched my back
People were running scared when they saw this devil
But now his acts and thoughts are allowed to rule the world

Who am I? Why am I here?
What are you looking for in my eyes?
Am I the answer to all of your questions
Or an idol that tells you lies?

Changing skin, holy wine has made me thirsty
Dying like a martyr is not enough to be Christ
Changing skin, all this singing has made me deaf
I saw a devil and the devil was me

Being mocked, being loved, being despised and then forgotten
Is the doom of this clown with crazy eyes and cynical smile

I've been changing my skin
I've been changing my skin
