[music: C. Rosso/lyrics: G. Careddu-A. Marchisio]

Now the damage is done
no time for regret
but soul foreclosures
and the eternity to fall
My lover is waiting beyond the farthest places
so far away
the sun has made my eyes turn blue, and forced
and has forced my lips to pray

Here I stand
in front of love betrayed
while my blood rises
up to my head
all is lost
where is now the place
where their names can be whispered
starting revenge?

No, I wouldn't have believed this to happen
when I promised my heart to her
time will go by like blades on skin
and will cover my shoulders with dust and rain

Here I stand, facing love mistakes
while her life is running out of my hands
naivety's my crime, by punishment be paid
but somebody's forgetting my river of tears
My heart was blind
my eyes are crying
my self is dying inside of me
my heart was blind
my eyes are crying
my self is dying

Please wait
I'm coming close to you
towards that place
before we changed direction

My seas are still waiting for me
for the Moor of Venice forever sad
is violence worth enough
to recover the broken morality?
God tell me
