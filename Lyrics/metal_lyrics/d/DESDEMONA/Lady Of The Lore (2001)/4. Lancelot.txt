[music: F. Torchia/lyrics: G. Careddu-Desdemona]

Sorry for the time I kept you waiting
sorry for the silence you had to listen to
for the man who will fight to defend the good fellow
he will be precious and beloved to his land
for the man who will fight like the howling wind
his name will be written in the pages of history
for the man who will rise to protect his land
his will be the seat on the right of God

Slowly the night falls on me
silence and cold in my bones
I'm foreseeing omens here in the air and nothing seems to move
you and I
you are mine
oh, we're defenders of our land
and this will soothe my pain
and I'm still waiting
to put down my sword
far from my beloved one
staining the ground with blood
my heart's divided by two dreams

Rage taking over
the battle begins
I'm not the King
I'm Sir Lancelot
in front of the throne
I must kneel
legends are telling 
I did it for real
I come to get you
I'm Sir Lancelot
before my enemies 
I feel power
Sir Lancelot

Lightning is burning the sky
magical words are tracing my way
warriors are resting close to the fire
while girls dance all night
but I still wait to forget my damnation
Merlin cast spells for me
but he doesn't reveal
nobody's better now

Rage taking over
the battle begins
I'm not the King
I'm Sir Lancelot
in front of the throne
I must kneel
legends are telling
I did it for real
I come to get you
I'm Sir Lancelot
before my enemies
I feel stronger
Sir Lancelot

Rage taking over
the battle begins
I'm not the King
I'm Sir Lancelot
in front of the throne
I must kneel
legends are telling 
I did it for real
I come to get you
I'm Sir Lancelot
before my enemies
I feel power
Sir Lancelot
