[music: F. Torchia/lyrics: A. Marchisio]

You will realize all of your dreams here
By forgetting what they are worth
You will love each and every love here
By learning to love indifference

You will be given forgiveness
For all of the sins you haven't committed yet
Will your mind be ready?
Will your sky be big enough for its orbit?

Listen to this heavenly and hellish choir
Until your soul is totally impaired
Good and evil meet and balance each other here
This is the golden rule of creation

Behold the Great Contemplator
For such is its nature
For everything on earth and sky
For everything that's born will die
Neptune the Mystic dreams of you

And when you believe it's all over
We'll be ready to leave for another universe
Too far from everything you've ever experienced
Forever beyond understanding

Listen to this heavenly and hellish choir
Until your soul is totally impaired
Good and evil meet and balance each other here
This is the golden rule of creation

Behold the Great Contemplator
For such is its nature
For everything on earth and sky
For everything that's born will die
Neptune the Mystic dreams of you

Listen to this heavenly and hellish choir
Until your soul is totally impaired
Good and evil meet and balance each other here
This is the golden rule of creation

Turning your soul upside down
You will be shown the roots of creation

Behold the Great Contemplator
For such is its nature
For everything on earth and sky
For everything that's born will die
Neptune the Mystic dreams of you
