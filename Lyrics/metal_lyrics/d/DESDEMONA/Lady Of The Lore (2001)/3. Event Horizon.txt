[music: C. Rosso/lyrics: A. Marchisio]

Bending and moulding the space to increase the knowledge of mankind
Event Horizon has reached the limits of the universe
Get on board and join our happy company
You will be able to see some things you've never seen

Stay with me forever
Liberate me!
The darkness that's inside of me
Liberate vos ex inferis!

The visions are now becoming clearer
you don't have to be afraid
It is just a coincidence
if everybody here has died
After being shown the very content
of their poor human souls
Yours is the power to destroy
either without or within yourselves

Stay with me forever
Liberate me!
The darkness that's inside of me
Liberate vos ex inferis!
