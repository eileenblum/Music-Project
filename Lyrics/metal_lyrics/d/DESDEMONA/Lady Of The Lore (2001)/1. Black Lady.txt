[music: F. Torchia-C. Rosso/lyrics: Desdemona]

Small frightened man
what will befall you tomorrow?
small frightened man
afraid of the moment when you have to die
you won't be able to tell night
from day and the earth doesn't care

Childlike, smiling and sad I will be eagerly waiting
to caress my love and kiss this life goodbye
oh, another man dies and the earth soaks his blood
Oh, my black lady
come to me and breathe deep into my soul
oh, my black lady
blow your ice-cold breath into my lungs

Now I'm inside of her realms
her night is so charming
I was never afraid of the shade of any God
so I can walk free
I send her love and rage
listening to my teeth rattle
her black fire is burning
black is the love she spreads for me
inside her black forest
all the trees are staring at me
smelling her dark lust rising
the doors of the temple are opened now
in her charming and seductive sea
all my dreams sink and fade away
I won't get back the time I've wasted
in the arms of death I am alive

Oh, my black lady
give to me your otherworldly love
oh, my black lady
you're a cold jewel in the night above
oh, my black lady
come to me and breathe deep into my soul
oh, my black lady
blow your ice-cold breath into my lungs

Oh, my black lady
give to me your otherworldly love
oh, my black lady
you're a cold jewel in the night above
oh, my black lady
come to me and breathe deep into my soul
oh, my black lady
by tonight be my lady of the lore
