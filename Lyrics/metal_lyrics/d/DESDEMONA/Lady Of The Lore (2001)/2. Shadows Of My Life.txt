[music: C. Rosso-F. Torchia/lyrics: G. Careddu-Desdemona]

When I was younger I used to believe
my life would get better as I lived
look at this old boy who is older inside
his inner hunger, I don't know why
they just wanted to decide for me
a new generation for a family tree
I got no results but I'm doing all my best
and I want a chance to try again

I don't care about fatherland
too many times he raised his hand
for a strong morality
he gave me no excuses

I'm sick of it all
and I'll never be quiet
there's no satisfaction in living this life
that brings me closer to a bitter disease
I try to forget but I'll never be pleased
I'm split inside but I try to be one
and all the colours I see they confuse me
no more reasons to stop running and to rest
now I've got a chance to try again

I don't care about fatherland
too many times he raised his hand
for a strong morality
he gave me no excuses

Shadows of my life
will my dreams come true tonight?
Shadows of my life
I'm telling you next time

Can you read this story inside my eyes?
Innocence's something I've been losing soon
I'm still screaming for all the lies that I was told
still they are trying to change my mind
memories to forget my tears
increasing my lust they will disappear
maybe it's time to rise and stand
behind my smile a desperate cry
memories will deny my past
I'm here to see and understand
I won't live for yesterday anymore
it's finally time to deify my body
Shadows of my life
will my dreams come true tonight?
Shadows of my life
I'm telling you next time
Shadows of my life
will my dreams come true tonight?
Shadows of my life
I'm telling you next time
