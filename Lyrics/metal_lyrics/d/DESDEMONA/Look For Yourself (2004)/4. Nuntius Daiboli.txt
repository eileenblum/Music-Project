"You have behaved yourself
Isn't something starting to be clear?
But what you've just found out is not enough
Move to Italy, and somebody there will give you good advice"

Hearing the sound of my own steps
Echoing through the streets of this baroque town
Through these elegant buildings in this night
I am a lonely wanderer with no direction

That old building seems to be calling for me
So I find my way inside of it
A little wooden door leads to its cellar
From the bottom of the stairs, a dim light shines

Dressed in black and chanting
Around a fleshly altar standing
Candles burning, they take my conscience away

I am the night that flows in you
The whisperer in the darkness
Free t oroam wild, hunting for souls
Revelling in the flames and the sreams

The demon awaken, my presence revealed
The congregation is coming to me
Better run as hell, look for a way out
Finding salvation up there in the streets

I am the night that flows in you
The whisperer in the darkness
Free t oroam wild, hunting for souls
Revelling in the flames and the sreams

I am the night you'll come to fear
Rejoicing in rape and murder
Feels so good while my nails scratch your flesh
Making your soul and mine unite

The diabolus is he
And his Nuntius am I
