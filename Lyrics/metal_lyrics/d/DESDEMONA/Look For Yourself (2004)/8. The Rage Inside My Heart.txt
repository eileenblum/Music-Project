I've just found out that I am able to love
I've understood I'm afraid, I can't help it
All these years I spent to make up my identity, were they useful?
All I know, I understand now who I am

Forgiveness, the strengh to go on
Every moment spent to find a solution
Ther is no way out, I'm tied to my energy and to what I know
The heavens expect from me

I don't know how long I'll be strong
I love myself, I hate them, I'm always provoked
Blamed, I'm paying for a wrong decision
I'll leave them to their destiny
Can I ever kill them?

No more people around me, anybody could overwhelm me
I need people around me, I thought they were my
friends
But they turned their backs on me

The rage inside my heart gives me no peace anymore
The fear of being nobody kills me
Another myself is waiting for me
The rage inside my heart can destroy you unmercifully

Delusion, the road I walk on
Ancient fathers, what am I blamed for?
Who set my runes in such an unfavourable manner?
What guilt has stained
My immortal soul in the beginning of times?

All these people around me, I'll get in a cage to show them I am free
Love and pride rest inside me, and I can set my other self free

The rage inside my heart gives me no peace anymore
The fear of being nobody kills me
Another myself is waiting for me
The rage inside my heart can destroy you unmercifully
