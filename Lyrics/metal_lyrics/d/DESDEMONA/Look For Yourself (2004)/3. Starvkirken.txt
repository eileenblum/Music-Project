In the far and cold land of Norway
Up there in the rainy Bergen town
This is where my family came from
This is where my roots have been planted
The local church has got a big archive
With the names and the stories of the families

I went there to meet the local cleric
I asked him to help me look for myself
I went there to meet the local cleric
I asked him to help me look for myself

"I am sorry son, but no Nidhugsen family
Left for England twenty nine years ago
And no Michael Nidhugsen has been baptized here
About that many years ago"

I feel so confused now
It seems my identity has been erased
I feel so helpless now
In the land I thought it was my own
I feel so selfless now
Where should I go searching for truth?
I feel so confused now
It seems my identity has been erased

I am walking along the harbour
Through the old wooden houses of the Brygge
All of sudden, there is again
My mysterious persecutor in black

I stop and look at him in fright
Why did he follow me this far?
"You better go looking for yourself
Outside the walls of this town"
So out I walked, following my instinct
Hearing a call with my mind's ears

I reached a wood and there I found
The old Fantoft wodden church
I stepped inside and I fell on my knees
Looking at the altar, a vision had I

My spirit is singing
My joy is arising
The texture of my dress
Is made of pure light
With all the happy souls
Gathered around me
All along we're singing
Cheering for his glory
