Lurking in the shadows
In this foggy night
When I turn around the corner
He's always there in sight

Figure dressed in black
Wearing a thick cloak
His fade is hidden by a hood
The night it seems to soak

Nine days I've got followed him
Nine days my life's been haunted
Does he mean any harn to me?
What am I to fear?

"Look for yourself", says the man in black
"Look for yourself, shadows hide your past"
What do these words mean? Meaning so unclear
May it be my life is not what I've always thought?

This thing can't go on
Am I getting insane?
If I am to get hurt
At least I will know his name

So tonight I'll wait for him
Shall I live or die
I'll win my fears and face the man
Whether it is talk or fight

All these days you've keep following me
All these days you've been haunting me
I am not afraid no more
What do you want from me?

"Look for yourself", says the man in black
"Look for yourself, shadows hide your past"
What do these words mean? Meaning so unclear
May it be my life is not what I've always thought?

All my life I've left like something was missing
All my life I've thought something was untrue
