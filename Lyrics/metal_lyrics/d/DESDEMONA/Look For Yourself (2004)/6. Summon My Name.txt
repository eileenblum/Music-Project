Gloria in excelsis Deo

And lust to those who rejoice on earth
It is better ruling in hell
Than bowing your head in heaven
Power flowing in my veins like liquid fire

Desperate affirmation of the self
Proud, strong and tall I stand on my own
No one can tell me how to behave
Only my image to glorify

No use in wasting your love on ingrates
Just say the words and I'll be there
Smell the incense, let me smell the blood
Inside the unholly circle we'll be one

Desperate affirmation of the self
Proud, strong and tall I stand on my own
No one can tell me how to behave
Only my image to glorify

Summon my name, eternal delight
Summon my name, Fulfil your desires
Our flesh and blood will be as one
All our blackneed souls will be as one

Am I the black messenger of my rage?
Am I asserting my identity?
I feel like everybody's using me
Just a puppet in the hands of a twisted master

Desperate affirmation of the self
Proud, strong and tall I stand on my own
No one can tell me how to behave
Only my image to glorify

Summon my name, eternal delight
Summon my name, Fulfil your desires
Our flesh and blood will be as one
All our blackneed souls will be as one
