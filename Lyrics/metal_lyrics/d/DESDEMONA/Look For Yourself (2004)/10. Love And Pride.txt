The life I've got this time is mine
No claws or feathers on my wings
I've changed my skin one last time
Love and pride were the springs

Walking in the shadows
I can feel the night
It's got no more dangers for me
'Cause the danger was me

This flesh has started burdening me
A body to carry my spirit around
My spirit does no longer sing
'Cause the song used to be me

Will you let me, won't you let me
Be the voice that speaks in you
Put a drop of black, add a hint of white
The picture's now complete
Will you let me, won't you let me
Be the voice that whispers in you
Paint your heart black, stain your soul white

I look in the mirror, what I see is myself
An ark of flesh to acknowledge my name
Nevermore torn between above and below
After a fight between love and pride

All the time my spirit is singing
While I whisper in the darkness
Light as air, eternal delight
All is finally in me as one

I'll face the challenge to live every day
I will dream of myself everyday
So that all of my dreams
Can be made of flesh and blood

Will you let me, won't you let me
Be the voice that speaks in you
Put a drop of black, add a hint of white
The picture's now complete
Will you let me, won't you let me
Be the voice that whispers in you
Paint your heart black, stain your soul white

I look in the mirror, what I see is myself
An ark of flesh to acknowledge my name
Nevermore torn between above and below
After a fight between love and pride

The sun is my father
The moon is my mother
I will get inside their brown of darkness
And find out the secret rhythm
Crying like an animal
Dancing 'till dawn
And forgetting my mortal name
The sun is my father
The moon is my mother
When I am their son again
I will did you all farewell
