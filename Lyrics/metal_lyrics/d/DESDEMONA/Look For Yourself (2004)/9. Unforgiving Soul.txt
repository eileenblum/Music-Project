It is all so clear now
That I decied I wanted to be a man
Not inmortal, I won't cheer for his glory
Or be the black messenger of my rage

When I see the man in black again
His face is a mask of delight and joy
"My name is AdonÃ©, the only angel
Who is still your friend"

"But an unforgiving soul is the reason
Why you forgot your identity and your name
You can join the infernal swarm, but if you leave
You'll never be forgiven by an unforgiving soul"

"I followed all your steps
Since the day that you were born again
For your third and last time
As the mortal Michael Nidhugsen"

"I gave all the money you needed
To pay for the orphanage and the school
'Cause even if I doubt you'll ever come back
This is what a guardian angel's for"

"But an unforgiving soul is the reason
Why you forgot your identity and your name
You can join the infernal swarm, but if you leave
You'll never be forgiven by an unforgiving soul"

It has been a deed of love
It has been a deed of pride
The day I decided that I wanted
My dreams to be made of flesh and blood
Turning my back to heaven and hell
To find a way which was my own

If all knowledge comes fro mthe lord
May it be that I am the lord of myself?
If nobody asserts themselves with impiety
And the roots of the righteous will never moved
Have I planted the roots for a higher tree to grow?
