Summoned to present a baby to the font,
Or that's what I told him.
"Just a pinch," I said,
But then I took so much more than that.
What was she called?
"They named her Topsy.
A true little lady," she said.
"Middle is her name. A little marvel of a girl,"
Or that's what I told him.
"They've asked for me again to take a baby to the font,"
So I said, "What was she called?"
Groove, they named her.
A graceless child. The bottom of the barrel."
Butter's finished, all gone,
'Cause I ate it. Ate the lot.
Why'd I have to finish all the butter?
Scoffed it down.
What can I do about this pickle?
Maybe I can find a handy scapegoat.
A fall guy.
One who would eat all this lovely butter from our tun.
I could blame a tiny little fly.
Can this far-fetched tale really be true?
Just a little fly?
There the bastard is, let's get him now!
Lock the door! Let's trap the butter thief!
No escape for you, bedeviled fly!
Come here so I can smash out your brain,
The blasted creature has landed on my nose!
You stay still, husband.
I will hit you in the face.
Here comes your smashed out brain.
Strike it while it's still on my nose!
Strike it while it's still on my nose!
Strike it while it's still on the end of my nose!
