Cursed appointment. Yuletide murders.
Mysterious killings each Christmas Eve.
Vigorous farmhand, guarding the farmstead.
(Cursed appointment)
Lighting the candle, hiding in the wall.
(Yuletide murders)
Smells like humans.
March up to the farmhouse, like each year.
Time to kill some humans. Bring the silver.
Lay out all the silver: silver plates,
silver knives, silver forks, silver goblets.
Break the dog's neck!
Break the dog's bones!
Drain the dog's blood!
Throw his corpse through the window.
Lay out all the silver: silver plates,
silver knives, silver forks, silver goblets.
Smells like humans.
Daybreak! Daybreak!
You killed my dog and you danced all night long.
Daybreak! Daybreak!
I'll chase you back down.
Back to the water's edge.
Quick, back down to the lake, out my way!
Quick, lest we turn to stone, back to the lake.
Daybreak! Daybreak!
Smells like humans.
