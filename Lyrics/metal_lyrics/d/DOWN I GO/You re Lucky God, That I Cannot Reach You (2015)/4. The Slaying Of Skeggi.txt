Over battle, Ogress ran the red blood of the serving man.
Tore off his head.
Her deadly iron mouth did gape.
Tore off his head and let out life.
Tree-foot tree-foot, foot of tree,
Trolls take thee and thy company.
I distrust this version of events.
Let Grettis face the music now.
Over rations, Grettis ran the red blood of the serving man.
Opened his throat.
Will you go back home?
He must be tried. Skeggi avenged.
Will you go back home?
Or stay gone three winters?
Must be outlawed.
Lift the stone! Grettir's heave!
It was said a rock-troll, her weight did throw into Skeggi's throat a short while ago.
Grettis outlawed!
Grettis outlawed!
