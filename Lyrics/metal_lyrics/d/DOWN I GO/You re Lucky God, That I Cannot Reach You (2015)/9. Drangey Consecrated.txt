Prowling giants cross the fjord.
Turn to stone when faced with the sunrise.
Jagged cliffs jut skyward;
Home to puffin, guillemot, raven.
Fearless men descend the cliffs.
Severed ropes send them to their maker.
Whether threadbare or intact,
Fate provides the same consequences.
Torn apart while plunging to a watery grave in the ocean.
Every bone is broken.
Dashed upon the jagged rocks of Drangey.
I will come and consecrate this cursed island,
Rid this cliff of malevolent forces.
Send me down to consecrate this cursed cliff face.
Lower me and bring the holy water.
Threads away from plunging to a watery grave in the ocean.
Hasty consecration,
Dangled from the jagged rocks of Drangey.
Wretched hand, get thee away. Haul me up swiftly.
Save me from this hairy-handed bastard!
Prowling hunters scale the cliffs.
Fell to sea when faced with the knife edge.
Jagged cliffs jut skyward;
Home to puffin, guillemot, raven.
I see a rope, I see a man
And then I reach for my knife,
Clasped in my hairy fingers.
I try to cut; one strand, two strands.
Who do you think you are?
The wicked need a place of their own too.
The birds collect on heathen ground.
On heathen ground.
