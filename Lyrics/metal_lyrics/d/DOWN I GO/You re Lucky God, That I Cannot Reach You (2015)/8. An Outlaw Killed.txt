Riding over a glacier with your friends,
Drizzle and bracing wind whipping through your hair.
Stop, take a look over yonder,
I can see four mounted figures.
Turn back and run away as fast as you can.
Gallop faster, we can lose them in the hills.
Faster! Three left. Faster! Two left.
Faster! One left.
Dismount! En garde!
Crack! The cudgel strikes across the hand.
Wrestled to the ground.
Quick, tie the outlaw's feet together.
Bind his hands as well.
I will haunt your dreams
And I will kill you slowly.
Turn him over and unsheathe your knife.
Cut his tendons so he cannot flee.
Steel yourself against his bloody screams.
Taste my arse and try and haunt me now.
Riding over the glacier with your friends,
Drizzle and bracing wind whipping through your hair.
Heed this as a warning:
All the the things you witnessed today,
Take them with you to your grave.
Hand over my knife so I can slit his throat.
Heed this as a warning:
All the things you witnessed today,
Take them with you to your grave.
I am warning you to never talk of this to a human soul.
Never speak of this ever again.
