Tell me mother,
How do I make the most of this gold ring?
Put it under a ling snake my darling one.
How do I make the most of this gold ring?
Put it under a ling snake in the old chest.
Left it for a few days and came back to check
And the chest is falling apart.
The snake has grown so enormous.
That the chest is bursting at its very joints.
How has this made the most of my gold ring?
Did you put it under a ling snake my love?
How has this made the most of my gold ring?
Perhaps I gave you bad advice my darling.
Carry the wretched chest down to the lake.
Cast it into the watery depths
Sink the damned thing to the bottom
Get this ling snake out of my life forever.
The beast won't stop its incessant growing.
Terror!
The thing won't stop growing.
When is enough enough?
It's grown too big.
It's so big now we cannot cope with it.
It eats our people one by one.
It really is intolerable to see our loyal
Townsfolk gobbled up one by one.
The venom sprays are constantly poisoning us.
It must be slain.
Send for the Finns,
They'll know just what to do.
We know they are a brave race of men,
And true.
They have killed many a similar beast;
With the victors,
We'll celebrate with a feast.
We are Finns,
Brave and true.
Swim down under the water.
Brave Finns ready for slaughter.
It seems there is another:
The monster's larger brother.
Set chains fit to restrain them.
Bring an end to the mayhem.
We will try to grab its flippers and its tail.
We will try to tie it down,
Fight tooth and nail.
We must restrain it, fight tooth and nail.
