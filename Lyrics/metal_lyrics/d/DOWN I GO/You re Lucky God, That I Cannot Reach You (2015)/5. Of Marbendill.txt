Please let me down again.
I was fixing my mother's chimney.
Leave me alone, release me back into the ocean
You'll stay with me, you'll stay with me,
I'll head to shore when I'm good and ready.
You'll stay with me, you'll stay with me,
I'll stay and fish 'til I'm good and ready.
First joke: kick your loyal dog.
Second joke: trip over the hummock.
Third joke: embrace your cheating wife.
Release me back into the ocean.
I've got a secret. I will reveal it to you.
Just let me down. I will reveal it to you.
I'll take you down my friend.
Take you down to the ocean.
Just tell me why you laughed.
Just tell me why you laughed three times.
Dig up the hummock that you tripped over and under it you'll find something to make you change your mind.
Take me back down to the ocean.
I'll take you down my friend,
Take you down to the ocean.
You told me why you laughed.
You told me where to find the gold.
The time is well remembered
When Marbendill laughed of yore.
How fawning sweet the mistress
When her man came ashore.
Kissing him and fondling,
Perfidious to the core.
The foolish man distrusted and kicked his dog, therefore.
Gold!
You have done a good deed,
I will reward you duly.
Keep your eyes open
And seize the opportunity.
The time is well remembered
When Marbendill laughed of yore.
How fawning sweet the mistress
When her man came ashore.
Kissing him and fondling,
Perfidious to the core.
The foolish man distrusted
And kicked his dog, therefore...
