Come out, you crafty fellow.
You have my wife's whorl.
Don't make me pound your mound more.
Give me something now!
Give me a cow for milking, and a good one too.
Give me some grain for the pot,
Or taste my cudgel.
Kidhouse! Kidhouse!
Stop banging on my house!
I will give you just what you want!
Don't you worry on that account.
A ladder to heaven, was it?
I will give you just what you want.
Here, let me set it up for you.
Careful with your pails of porridge.
Give my regards to St. Mary.
Careful not to get too dizzy.
Bring me the tallest ladder,
To climb to heaven.
We've porridge for St. Mary,
Made of milk and grain.
Splattered across the world,
The porridge and the brains,
Splattered across the world.
The porridge and the brains,
Splattered across the world.
The porridge and the brains.
Splattered across the world,
The porridge and the brains,
From their splintered skulls,
Lichens of white and yellow.
Splattered across the world,
The porridge and the brains
From their splintered skulls,
Don't anger Kidhouse.
