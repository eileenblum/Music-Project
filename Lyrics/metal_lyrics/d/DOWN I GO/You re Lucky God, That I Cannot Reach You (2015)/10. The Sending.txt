Escape from the black death.
No corpses on the island.
One sent to investigate.
Go forth and dispatch our absent brother.
Thus is made the sending
Dead bodies everywhere.
Stone houses left wide open,
But here's a bolted door:
A sign of a survivor!
Trap the sending inside a lamb bone.
Codger's cave-skull, burning human bellies.
Fly released from his bony prison,
Like a mountain,
Trees flattened by wingbeats,
All consuming swallows other sendings.
Now everybody's dead,
And we are free from sendings,
Repopulate the Earth.
Incestuous new bloodline.
With the help of an old cave-dweller
(ugly face, but helpful)
We are safe from the rusty spectres.
Don't judge a book by its cover.

Mother in the pen,
Primp and charm the men.
Take my swaddling rags to don,
And dance with them.
