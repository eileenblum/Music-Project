Imperial Fist!

Now, the call to war
Walls of gold
Are turned to

Stone, are will
Stone our tool
To face faithless
Traitors

Now, the dark
The end closes in
These walls must

Stand, as one and face
The foe with
Boltguns.

So, let them come,
With madness before them
So, let them come
And break on our walls.
Like waves on stone unyielding
Their bodies will break.
His Praetorian will see it done.

Imperial Fist!

See his ships loom,
Crowd the sky like
Vultures

Bombardment begins!

So, let them come,
With madness before them
So, let them come
And break on our walls.
Like waves on stone unyielding
Their bodies will break.
His Praetorian will see it done.

Fortress Terra trembles
The Warmaster comes
Siege guns rumble
We do what must be done.
Our lives are forfeit.
Only death awaits.
We give them gladly.
The galaxy at stake.

So, let them come,
With madness before them
So, let them come
And break on our walls.
Like waves on stone unyielding
Their bodies will break.
His Praetorian will see it done.

Know that all stone crumbles.
Know all walls must fail.
Here the VIIth stands.
Here his Fists prevail.

Though we see our world come to ruin,
Though the light of man is fading,
We are a bulwark against the darkness.
Only our steel 'tween Order and Chaos

Though we see our world come to ruin,
Though the light of man is fading,
We are a bulwark against the darkness.
Only our steel 'tween Order and Chaos
