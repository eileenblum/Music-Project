War Unknown, slay your brother.
Purge the ranks of those once loyal.
Life Eater takes the world.
Firestorm wastes all life.

Skulls you claim, the gods will know your name.

Kharn, Gorechild
The axe of fate hangs over you,
Rage your strength and your fall.
One law on the battlefield, written sealed in blood.
Fight this war forever,
Betrayer!

Counter attack, no respite
Angron's sons lead the fight.
World Eater, skulls surround you.
Champion, blood has claimed you.

Blood for the blood god, skulls for the skull throne of Khorne.

Kharn, Gorechild
The axe of fate hangs over you,
Rage your strength and your fall.
One law on the battlefield, written sealed in blood.
Fight this war forever,
Betrayer!
