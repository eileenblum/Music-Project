Wolves unleashed fall upon
Transgression's seat,
Benighted Prospero.

For sorcerers, retribution.

Witches now hunted as prey.
Foemen in sight,
Brothers wet your blades.

Our lord's decree, the murder-make

Fire rains down,
Contrails of howling doom.
Know your death at the hands
Of the Wolves of Fenris

Leman Russ, fury unmatched
Bolts and blades, psychic fire.
Maelstrom of war, Astartes blood
Washes the stones of shining Prospero.

Magnus' Sons, a thin red line
Can't hold back the baying Wolves
He sees

From crystal hall, he sees them fall.

Psychic force, spent at last.
Maleficarum justifies fangs and blades.

One option left, his final gift.
The Crimson King, in wrath revealed.

Cyclops faces Wolf
In a battle of demigods.
Victory or defeat
Neither will know.
Fates sealed by sword blades.

Magnus and Russ forces matched,
Relentless battle, breastplate cracked.
The Wolfking's heart now pierced by fire.
No wold can aid their stricken sire.
Frost cold sword blade finds its mark.
Cyclops' eye now bloodied and dark.
Lightning cracks the blackened sky
As Russ breaks Magnus' living spine.

Embers fill the sky.
Corpse wind, rising ash.
The wolves' war-work done.
Leave Prospero to burn.

Legion Stormbirds fill the sky.
Rising pinions of flame.
The Vlka Fenryka, bloodied, howl
Victorious shadow cast
Blackest night covers all.
Empty shells masters call.
