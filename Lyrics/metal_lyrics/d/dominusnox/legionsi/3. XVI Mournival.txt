Worlds we've conquered,
The Spear's Blade.
Hopes we've fostered,
End in flames

Worlds we've conquered,
The Spear's Blade
Brothers fractured,
Shall end in flame.

Strike! The final thrust falls.
Worthless they die this day.
Kill! Let none remain alive.
Death on a dead world.
Abbadon! You've sold your soul.
A candle flame in sightless void.
Loken! You will not escape.
Lupercal's judgement.

Mournival,
Chosen battle captains are doomed to fall.
Bonds like blades are broken.
Cast down, the spear in his hand.

Lupercal,
The chosen son and the Warmaster
Mankind falls to laughing gods
Capricious beasts,
Let the galaxy burn.

Burn! Traitors where they stand.
Blood runs on ash and bone.
Death! Only then does duty end.
Grind on 'til nothing's left.
Slave! You don't understand.
Only he has the right to rule.
Traitor! You've doomed us all.
Now you must die

Mournival,
Chosen battle captains are doomed to fall.
Bonds like blades are broken.
Cast down, the spear in his hand.

Lupercal,
The chosen son and the Warmaster
Mankind falls to laughing gods
Capricious beasts,
Let the galaxy burn.

Left to bleed
Left to rot
Forever changed
Forever lost

In the dark

Mournival
Doomed to fall
Bonds like blades are broken.
Cast down, the spear in his hand

Lupercal
Warmaster
Doomed to fall to laughing gods.
Capricious beasts,
Let the galaxy burn.
