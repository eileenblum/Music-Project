Mortarion, imperious lord of death,
Rebellion denied, of home bereft.

Pain is an illusion of the senses,
Fear an illusion of the mind.
Beyond these only death awaits,
As silent judge over all.

The XIVth Legion,
Your unbroken blades,
Your chosen Deathguard,
Doomed scions, Host of Plague.

For the Emperor,
To your oath you're bound.
For the Emperor,
Your oath, you renounce

Pain is an illusion of the senses,
Fear an illusion of the mind.
Beyond these only death awaits,
As silent judge over all.

Mortarion, your pride your doom
Mortarion, your flesh your tomb

Mortarion, your pride your doom
Mortarion, your flesh your tomb

Cast Aside your master.
Be chained anew.
The Plague God Nurgle,
Has chosen you.

Mortarion!
Through the mists, silence comes
Imperious Lord of Death,
You are home.
