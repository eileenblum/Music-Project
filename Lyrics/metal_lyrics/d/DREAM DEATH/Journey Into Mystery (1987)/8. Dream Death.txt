Arriving home but feeling distraught
Life's not what it used to be
But that's the way it was taught
Leave behind the fear of sleep
And the oncoming visions
It's the battle of your mind
Of love and decisions

Because the mind knows weakness
And weakness is fear
In a land where you can scream
But no one can hear
Enter this timeless plane
Mind's torment and pain
You only have death to lose
And your life to gain

Dream death
Somebody get me out of this nightmare
Dream death
Never thought life could be so damn evil

Ask God to help but he seems to be blind
He would help you if he could
But evil's in the mind
Contemplate suicide
But the dreams won't go away
Death ends life and life starts death,
It's easier that way

Because the mind knows weakness
And weakness is fear
In a land where you can scream
But no one can hear
Enter this timeless plane
Mind's torment and pain
You only have death to lose
And your life to gain

Dream death
Somebody get me out of this nightmare
Dream death
Never thought life could be so damn evil

Hide in false illusions
Is that the only way you can escape the hate
Put away the past
Before your moral freedoms are taken away

Dream death
Somebody get me out of this nightmare
Dream death
Never thought life could be so damn evil
Dream death
Somebody get me out of this nightmare
Dream death
Never thought life could be so damn evil
Dream death! Dream death! Dream death!
