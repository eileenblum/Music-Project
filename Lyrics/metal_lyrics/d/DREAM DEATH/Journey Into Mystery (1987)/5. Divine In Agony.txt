Chaos prevails, living in a dying hell
But you can't change
It's just the world we live in
Rise above the rest, if you want to be my guest
But the odds are on that you wont make it

Torments as far as the eye can see
Looters sifting through the debris
The son of Cain turns in his grave
I feel I've reached doom at last

Shades of deception, cast your fate on me
Power of rejection, never leave me be
Corruption rules at my will
Ancestors of this demon in me

They call to me demanding uncivility
It broke my will, it laid my dreams to waste
Destroy or adore me love or abhor me
Hated ecstasy this joyous agony

Ambience of mourners,
Know that it's the end
Decadence only goes so far,
The other is blown away

Final time alone in shades
Where are my friends
They said they'll be here till the end

My pleas fall on silenced ears
The dark is coming the sun won't rise again
Recede to nothing I can't let that happen
You're the one who can be devoured by agony
