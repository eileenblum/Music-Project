Welcome to my funeral
My family and my friends
I hope you've enjoyed the living me
Because the dead one never ends
Your tears of joy
Are hid by tears of regret
You'll remember my parting ways
As the first time we really met

You count me out
You'd better have your doubts
Don't let my death go to your head
Because I'm back from the dead
Back from the dead, back from the dead

I've always been a loser
And settled for second best
Now I've got another chance
And I won't fail again
I crash through the window
At the will reading party's host
What's the matter dear family?
You look like you've seen a ghost

No time to run
Not till I've had my fun
This one time you won't forget
That I'm back from the dead
Back from the dead, back from the dead

??? reasons why
?? just the die
Laugh at me you'll regret
There's no stopping the living dead

I'm back from the dead
Back from the dead, back from the dead
