Look through the mystic door
At the hidden depths which all men share
Long and hard was the war
When man usurped the Earth
Last to fall the serpent men,
Driven into the waste and left to die
They returned as priests
Of their evil cult in human guise

Back to the palace,
Puts his trust in a man, he does not know
He can't believe the things he does who
His very chamber underlined with hidden halls
There is no idea what this night will befall

From the wars of old
Etched on all men's souls
Eldritch words only man can speak
Mystic runes, they must keep alive

Into bed, and feign deep sleep
TÃº the counselor knife bared creeps
Traitor slayed his face doth change
There leers in its stead a vile serpent's head

Can't you see they're coming back
To rule the world again
Plot revenge through their evil cult
The serpent men

He looks out and wonders,
Which are men and which are not
He speaks the eldritch words,
Which he was taught
They rush the dias,
Victory finds defeat
Burst through the throne room,
Someone in his seat

Blades unsheathed, totem's face
Which will win, tiger or snake?
Fight ensues, traitor slayed
To purge the Earth, the promise is made
The elder race
