A sickness in my body, disease within my brain
Psychic trauma emotional madness
My mind's filled with fear and pain
Enter my subconscious, memories not my own
Realities but a dream, that won't leave me alone

Blackness fills my empty void
Things not what they seem
Suicide reigns as tyrant
Darkness rules supreme

Watch in fear
As I take control of you
Panic stricken overridden,
Won't know what to do
Cannot men a broken heart
Past the point of madness
Tears you wear as you sleep
Only bring you sadness

Leave me be I'll tell you now
Quit screaming in my hear
When darkness comes to you
I'm the only one who'll hear you scream

Scream fighting for your life
There is no insight
Darkness rules supreme
No one hears you scream

My dear brain cries out
To those of you who've had
No one to stand beside you
When you're going mad
