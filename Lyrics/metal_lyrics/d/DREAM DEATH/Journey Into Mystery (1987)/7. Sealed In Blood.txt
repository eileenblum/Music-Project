Lurking in the shadows
As one with the mist
I'm waiting for you fair lady
To give you my bloody kiss

Run and hide
Time to die
Age old love
Sealed in blood

Put up your wall of crosses
Take refuge in benevolence
My hounds of hell will dispel
All attempts at defense

Come to me
Sweet child
Feel my touch
Taste my blood

Running and hiding through London's streets
On your neck I'll feed
Running fast, but I'm always behind you
Tonight you'll bleed for me

The look in my eyes
Will be the last for your willful soul
You raise the stake, but cannot strike
As my aura takes control

Be my bride
By my side
Fates entwined
Sealed in blood
