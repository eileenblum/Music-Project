[performed by Dopethrone]Indoctrinated 
Thereâs no way out 
Self-Righteous Violence 

Your devotion 
All your prayers 
They wonât be heard 

Dominating shadows 
Sip on your tears 
Bottom feeding maggots 
Thrive off your fear 

Kneel in silence 
to drink the blood 
you Let them rule 

Host is swallowed 
Enter the light 
Flames will follow
