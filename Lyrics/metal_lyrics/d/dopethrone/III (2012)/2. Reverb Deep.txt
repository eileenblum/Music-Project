Dopium Money
Stole Your Spirit
All For Nothing
But Endless Guilt

You Sleep
Where You Been Shitting
Down In Reverb Deep
Where You Been Hiding
Sweet Devil You'll Reap
What You Been Sowing
Down In Reverb Deep

You're Way Too Weak
The Demon Feeds
It's Way Too Late
There's No Escape
You're Fucked

You'll Weep
Where You Been Sleeping
Down In Reverb Deep
Where No One's Watching
The Great Eye Sees
Your Lies And Doings
Down In Reverb Deep
