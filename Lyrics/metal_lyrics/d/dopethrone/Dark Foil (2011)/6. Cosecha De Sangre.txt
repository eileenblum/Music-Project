Cosecha de sangre
In thy holy name
San la muerte
Black tar filling
My lungs and veins
Cosecha de sangre
In thy holy name
San la muerte
Sound dead, sleeping
For the moment
Against
Cosmic current
Oh blood

Along the path
I forever walk
Where death, God
The Devil and I
Can finally talk
So calmly, away
From the insipid flock
