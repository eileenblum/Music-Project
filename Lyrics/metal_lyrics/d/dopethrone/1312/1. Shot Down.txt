You're made out of lies
You creep around
Taht ain't gonna fly
You've been - shot down

It's always the same
All over town
So sick of your games
You've been - Shot Down

Shhh
Don't make a sound
Your life's gone to shit
You've been - shot down

The fear in your eyes
You're cemetery bound
Give up or die
You've been - shot down
