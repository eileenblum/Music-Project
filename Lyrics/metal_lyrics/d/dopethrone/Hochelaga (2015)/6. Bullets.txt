I don't need you to tell me
When I need to grow up
I'm going to hold on to my bullets
You just let me be

I don't care how you see me
I don't care what you see
I don't think you'll get rid of me

Just know that I am free

Don't you tread on me
You better let me be

I don't need you to tell me
How and what to be
I'm going to hold on to my bullets
You just let me be

Don't you tread on me
You better let me be
