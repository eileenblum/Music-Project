Raise your hands for me

Centuries of sun
Have dried our lands
Our dream of heaven faded away
Every hope of life from clay
Died with our wasted years

A smothering sky brought desolation
Will of the lords we loved
Their death released the essence
Falling as the loudest divine lead

Now
Run to the hills
And feel the essence of life
Live to never forget
How short life is
I was human scum thinking about giving up
Love, care, breathe, the essence of life

And betrayers like our gods was
Will suffer the loneliness
Of a forsaken divinity
Who could rule a world
Draining its force
And no one will let this
Holy crime happen again

Raise your hands for life
Walk with it, follow it
Now
