Crawling through clay
Shattering old trees as twigs
Calling for immortality

Masters of living
Devourers of souls
Invocating ancestral rites

I command you for eternity
My words will transform life into decay

Already dreaming of imperial
Anthems for me
I will enslave this world made of scum
And Iâll reign from the skies as the blackest astre

I will smother all of you miserable weak
I will be the last king of your history
I will slay you all in intense suffering and
I will spread the plague that all of you fear

I am the child of unending frustration
Broken by life forsaken
By the one I believed and trusted
As those of the same blood
Now they all have to pay

I will break you all I swear
Have made of your life a burden
I will make of your life a hell on earth

Die

Stars give me strength to take my revenge
Astres of light eradicate these lands

I am the father of plagues
I am the one to suffer the end
