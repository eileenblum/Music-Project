Approach and dare to stare
The one I've become
I am the reflect you have
Always feared to face

I'm not the fame you lusted for
And for this life I wasted
Nothing remains
In my old man's hands

I am the deception of a life of sins and doubts
I killed my pain and swear I'll take this revenge
But all I'm now is sadly shame and neglect

I walked with the dead and
Dream of this odyssey
A time of pride and glee
Condemned to be buried in oblivion

Face your failure you scum of a man
Your efforts will be as useful as you are
A fallen dream forever sacrificed

I walked with the dead and
Dream of this odyssey
A time of pride and glee
Condemned to be buried in oblivion
We'll die alone but not for it
Please take my life and my soul
Never come again in oblivion

The purple child that I was
The illusion of a night
And now I'm just a remain of the past
I'm waiting at the gates
I can't do one more step

I am not the waste of a life
I will fight for a decent end
