Centuries of oblivion
Drowned in the darkest water
Would never smother the wrath we had inside

We are the ones that never die
We are unbreakable
We are the bringers of decades of despair
The will of ruin and spread
Our dismal winds will never end
We are alive

Walk with us or die
We are the decades of despair
Give us your strength and make us
Stronger than ever
Walk with us and follow
The path of no regrets
A legion of legend
That never fails

Centuries of oblivion
Would make us bold and stronger
A time of desolation
Has come for you
