Astres of light disappeared
Unleashing violent darkness
Thrown into oblivion
Living of fertile lands
Were disowned by grace
All persisted in faith for light
A black veil covered the fields
Then every faith faded away

Where anything could rise or live
When earth suffered the last eclipse
For decades and decades
As the shadow falls
Upon the face of the earth
It stretches forth
Under the kingless crown
Beneath the veil a time before memory

Forsaken in blindness
With no mark to follow or trust and
Drowned into darkness
That smothers whispers of the wretched
All persisted in faith for light
Until a black veil covered fields
Then every faith faded away

As wise as serpents
Deified
Into the shadows of time
Stars give me strength
To seek my revenge
Astres of light eradicate these lands
