Winds whistling facing the sea, sails swelling we are leaving
To face the ink of our story
We're not afraid of Poseidon's thunderous anger
Crossing the oceans of eternal torment
Hunting the deep blue splitter
Cause hidden lives the white beast
The legendary creature of our story
We'll succeed where many men died in vain
We'll pierce the heart of the white whale

Beyond the foulness of the swell...

Last time I see the shore for a tale I don't know the end
Last time I see the shore for a tale I don't know the end

It's the last time I see the shore
Let me see it one last time
So I left the shore

Beyond the foulness of the swell
Amongst the swifting winds astray
Our hearts won't betray
Beyond the foulness of the swell
Amongst the swifting winds astray
Our hearts won't betray

We're not afraid of Poseidon's thunderous anger
Crossing the oceans of eternal torment
Hunting the deep blue splitter
Our impudence will lead us to our graves
Our incentives won't betray the ones we could have been

Last time I see the shore for a tale I don't know the end
Last time I see the shore for a tale I don't know the end
