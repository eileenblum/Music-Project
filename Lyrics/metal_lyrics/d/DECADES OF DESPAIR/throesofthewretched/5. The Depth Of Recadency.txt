Vexation and disappointment are my only associate
Under every steps attempting to surface and spread their plague
It takes me back into the ruins of my dire tragedy
Salt my wounds and remind me the man I died to be

Drowned in disgrace and loneliness of a faceless existence
Drowned in despair and loneliness weakened by disease

Surrounded by mirrors of my living death
Reflecting shredded faces devoured by their shame
Broken mouths and frowned eyebrows, sickened by my fate
Unable to remind the man I used to be

Digging through the past of my memories, seeking for what made me to be
Disgust and distate for life, grievance rancour unfaithfulness
Solely reaching the depths of humanity, watching the world that corrupted me
I'm sorry I cannot be sorry, distate for life
I'm sorry I cannot be sorry, distate for life

Drowned in disgrace and loneliness of a faceless existence
Drowned in despair and loneliness weakened by disease
I sailed the seas, found nothing but incurable disease
I travelled the ocean, my purposeless quest is ending dying on my knees

Waiting for my end, dreaming of a progeny that is able to care
Waiting for my end, dreaming of a progeny defying all despair
Waiting for my end, dreaming of a progeny that is able to care
Waiting for my end, dreaming of a progeny defying all despair
