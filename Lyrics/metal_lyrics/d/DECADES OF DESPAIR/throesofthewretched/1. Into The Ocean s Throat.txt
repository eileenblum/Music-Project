The ocean screams, a piercing voice from eerie dreams
The ship is dying for a bloody fight
Facing the whale, offspring of Poseidon's spell
We're not afraid, we'll get you in the end

Cannons, blow your fire on this monster
Cannons, release your deafening thunder

I can feel excitation growing and growing into my boiling veins
My heart beats raise the waves, leading the white beast to its grave
We are not our terror's slave, we are strong and we are brave
The breeze we seek lead us astray

Battle begins, spears crossing the howling winds
The creature feels its last breath approching
Stealing its soul as death breathing the old man's blow
The end of your life of destruction has come

Time for your death, return back to the darkest depths
Time for your death

Time has come and we're not afraid
Time has come and we're not afraid
Time has come and we're not afraid
Time has come and we're not afraid

Beyond the foulness of the swell, beyond the seas, beyond the ocean
The king is sinking

I can feel excitation growing and growing into my boiling veins
My heart beats raise the waves, leading the white beast to its grave
We are not our terror's slave, we are strong and we are brave
The breeze we seek lead us astray
Battle begins, listen to the winds
