Legacies bequeathed by the deaths and decimations
Vanquished by pureness and loyalty of a guileless heart
Crawling towards the forest of infernal legions begging to arise
Beyond the fringes of Belial they await their murk inception
Amidst the darkest paths, no light would bring them any solace
Neglected by the ones who once betrayed their ancestors

The abhorrent breed was summoned by deceit
Their unworthy misery we have strived not to foresee
Reaching for the very glee I'll never feel

The blackened gates of the old city are reminders of their own misery
Obumbrated by the overlapping forces
Amidst the darkest paths, no light would bring them any solace
Neglected by the ones who once betrayed their ancestors

It's reassuring for the weak to believe their eviction
When their insidious wrath will unfold tauting the sins we forbear
Nothing would cease this unerring unwavering march
Throes of the wretched
The clouds of inequity are glooming the sky above
Nothing would cease this unerring unwavering march
Throes of the wretched

Through swirling storms defying skies, diminished by the wretched legions
Their anguish will prevail
Impalement of the least afflicted, by no means of deception
Their torment will prevail

Defenders to the throne, defenders of the light
Rotting through corpses of eternal grief until the final relief
Defenders to the throne, defenders of the light
Rotting through corpses of eternal grief until the final relief
Sullen, glum and forlorn of hope, loathing the warmth of our souls
Crossing the bridges of eternal life to the wounds of our dominion

When their insidious wrath will unfold tauting the sins we forbear
Nothing would cease this unerring unwavering march
Throes of the wretched
The clouds of inequity are glooming the sky above
Nothing would cease this unerring unwavering march
Throes of the wretched

Tremors from the core of the earth
Digging through the depths of the forgotten wounds
Fire from the bottom of the earth
Consuming and destroying all existing life
Tremors from the core of the earth
Digging through the depths of the forgotten wounds
Fire from the bottom of the earth
Consuming and destroying all existing life.
