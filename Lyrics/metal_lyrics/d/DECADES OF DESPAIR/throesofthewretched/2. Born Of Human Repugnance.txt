Devastation through repellent hands

Down in a purulent cavernous breach
Cryptic earth's wound that seems outlandish
Unveiled by precious eclipse's glints
We won't turn back until we've seen the perishing core issue from sins
The sovereign called Gargaroth
Offspring of agony, odium and human repugnance, worship your emperor
Born of desire to admire life excruciation, bow down for Gargaroth
Offspring of hatred, despise and human repugnance, worship your emperor
Born of desire to admire life excruciation, bow down for Gargaroth

Unfolding the virtuous lair, walls of entrails
Columns of corpses and ground of cold flesh that are screaming their pain
Trampling the wretched souls
From the ages of our ancestors

From the silence inspiring anguish
From the darkness the screech will perish
Fire, thunder and flames from his horrid and repellent hands
Scourge and demolish all prolific lands

And I won't die in this dreary fortress
In sacred kingdoms we'll prevail
But in the end death's breeze will all embrace our chests
We won't deceive our dismal fate

Devastation through repellent hands

Down in a purulent cavernous breach
Cryptic earth's wound that seems outlandish
Unveiled by precious eclipse's glints
We won't turn back until we've seen the perishing core issue from sins
The sovereign called Gargaroth
Offspring of agony, odium and human repugnance, worship your emperor
Born of desire to admire life excruciation, bow down for Gargaroth
Offspring of hatred, despise and human repugnance, worship your emperor
Born of desire to admire life excruciation, bow down for Gargaroth
