i've been searchin for some time to find the question
trails of dead wrongs and missed rights
are any of you out there even living
or did we happen to fall in empty skies
i will never fall
to my knees again [x2]
this game is over you can't win [x2]
though this ship is headed towards the shoreline
we hit the floor as to not miss a beat
pack out the bar with motivation
now i know you feel it in your knees
i've got 36 twelve-ounce reasons
to forget my name
(i forgot why i came to this place)
tits tits tits tits tits tits tits tits
(celebration bitches)
