The bar fills up and the drinks star mixing
a cluster fuck of shame dispensed to lower your neck
by the time the bar keep hits the table
my sights are set on tonight's last pathetic attempt
movin like a huntress across the dance floor
we meet at the waist and re-discover our flaws
she's shaking hard when i sniffle so softly
she drops her glass and knees right down to the floor
as i show her to the basement apartment
that has been built on endless nights like this
i wont stop you your on your knees baby please
i understand that this might might come as a shocker
don't get upset you were somewhat still worth it
but at the top you gotta flip this shit fast
