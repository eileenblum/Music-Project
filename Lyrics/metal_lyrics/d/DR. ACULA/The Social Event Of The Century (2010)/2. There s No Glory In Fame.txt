We're live from the lowest point at the top of the world
and i can't help but notice I've been here before
the faces not too familiar but the drinks taste the same
i feel like i'm walking on water
but i'm told i'm no messiah
maybe i maybe i should take a seat
now if you'll hear what i say
you wont think to walk away
you'll be askin me to stay
until the sun fucks up the night
hey "little miss what's your name"
with your eyes like hurricanes
everybodys gotta play the game
just once to say they did
i'm here to make a stand
as soon as i find my feet
