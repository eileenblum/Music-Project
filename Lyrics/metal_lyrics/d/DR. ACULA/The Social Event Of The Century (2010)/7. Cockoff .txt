By a show of hands
who hates my band
when we showed up
we were what was hot
we never cooled off
we're going places you're not
no no no no
no reason to explain
you talk shit to mask
your face full of shame
its so easy to lose
but we decide what is hot
we never cooled off
we're going places you're not
just tell me how much it hurt
when you fell off this shit
and looked up to the peak
and we're reaching for it
damn right i'm cocky
fuck yeah i have no shame
weve been fighting to get up
weve been fighting to make our name
oh
they all come they all disappear
and its time that you realized
we are still fucking here
no need to apologize
we don't need respect
we know what weve done
so why don't you save face
were just having fun
