The days colors never seemed so bright
as when i look at them through shades of night
i can't recall
how or when i got here
all i can tell you
i don't care
puff puff pass
go a few cars back theres a man with a briefcase
got bags of fun you've been looking for all night
trade green for green just don't look him in the face
a couple bills gotcha feeling alright
as it hits my chest it soothes my soul
i saw the red in the eyes of the conductor
i caught the scent and i haven't left yet

out of the tunnel regain visual
i see myself in shades of grey and green
from a window where the clouds escape
i felt the air and remembered the taste
chapped lips and blood shot stares
everyone is listening but nobody cares

there are no limits on this ride
all aboard the train to the sky
