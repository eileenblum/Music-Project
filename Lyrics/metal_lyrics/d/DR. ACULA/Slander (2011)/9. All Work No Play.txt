Oh my god! What horrible things you've done. Boy, how in the hell are we ever
gonna clean this up? Oh good god. I thought I told you never in the house. One
of these days our luck will surely run out. Itâs on the carpet, it's all over
the walls. It stains your fingers and was dragged through the halls. Oh boy
you've gone and done it now. Oh boy you've gone and done it now, Oh goddamn, I
told you this shit time and time again. There's no excuse for it. This shit has
got to end. Oh my god. Oh good god. Oh goddamn this shit has got to end. All
work, no play has turned this dull boy into a monster. Monster. All work, no
play has turned this dull boy into a monster. Monster. All work no play has
turned this dull boy into a monster. Monster. All work no play has turned this
dull boy into a monster.
