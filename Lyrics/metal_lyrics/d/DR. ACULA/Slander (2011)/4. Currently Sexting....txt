What I've become is what you'd never want to see me be. I live a life thats
filled with filth, disgrace and apathy. I travel down a road thats paved and
made with this disease. So, I'd advise, don't waste your time and try to save
me. I am the perfect product of wrong place and time. I'd rather die than try
to better my life. There is nothing in everything. I see nothing in anything.
Now do you blame me for my lack of faith? Ignorance is my best weapon.
Ignorance is my best weapon. And I will use it till the day I fucking die. So,
what the fuck did you think? Did you think there was more? What the fuck did
you think? Did you think there was more? What I've become is what you'd never
want to see me be. I live a life thatâs filled with filth, disgrace and apathy.
I travel down a road thatâs made and paved with this disease. So I'd advise,
don't waste your time and try to save me.
Innocence, I gave up long ago. Innocence, it means nothing to me. Tell me what
did you think? Did you think there was more?
