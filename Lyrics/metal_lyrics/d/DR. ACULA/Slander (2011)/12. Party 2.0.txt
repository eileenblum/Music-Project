Nowâs the time to forget life and grab it by the horns. So take a swig, make it
big, its time get to get reborn. It's time to get with the program. Make
yourself a mess while trying to impress. Make yourself a mess and take another
shot. The time has come to put yourself to the test and keep in mind that you
are up against the best. SO GET READY! I can make myself a mess, I do it
everywhere all across the fucking earth and we don't fucking care. I can make
myself a mess, I do it everywhere all across the fucking earth and we donât
fucking care. We are all a brand new breed. We got no money but thatâs not what
we need. This is a celebration and we are all a mess; a drunk nation.
Everything is better once you accept that you canât win, that you canât win,
Pick it up and chug, itâs how we get down. We came here to fuck everybody up.
Pick it up and chug, itâs how we get down. We came here to fuck everybody up.
