Listen up everybody! Gonna have your cameras out. You sure as hell ainât gonna
wanna miss this one. Iâm about to make a scene, a little something for your
magazine. So keep a steady hand, so keep a steady hand, this is a day in the
life of someone who's lost themselves completely. So keep a steady hand and
donât you come back without that shot again. Misery loves money, theyâre as
ruthless as they come. Theyâre gonna make it look so good as they drag your
name through the mud. So drag my name through the mud. As far as this goes, you
know Iâm as easy as they come. All the scenes that we make everyday, Iâm like
playing with a loaded gun. Some get caught up in it but we do this for fun.
Imma put on a show and youâll know damn well that I ainât done. Hold down the,
hold down the fort and run with it. A constant feeling somebodyâs watching me,
a constant feeling somebodyâs watching me. So drag my name through the mud, so
drag my name through the mud. When will you change? When will you change? I
know youâre going nowhere. Youâll stick around and play the obvious role. I
know youâre going nowhere. Youâll stick around and play the obvious role.
