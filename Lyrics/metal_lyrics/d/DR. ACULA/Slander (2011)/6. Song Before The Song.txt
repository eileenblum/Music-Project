Pain is nothing if you numb it, overcome it and love it. Forced to focus when
my head is in the clouds and theres alot of things important to see but Iâve
accepted that itâs nothing to me, nothing to me at all. And all is well down
here in hell. And all is well down here in hell and I could you use a little
company cause all is well down here with me. If you ferment it then Iâll
swallow the sea and I could you use a little company. Cause all is well down
here in hell, cause all is well down here with me. Big sleep, big sleep, big
sleep. My futureâs written for me. Dive deep into an endless sea of no sleep. I
think my vices finally got the best of me. No sleep. And to the bar owners:
Iâll be the chosen one, because they know me as a drinkerâs son. And to the bar
owners: Iâll be the chosen one. And to the bar owners: Iâll be the chosen one
because they know me as a drinkerâs son, but I have failed him and I will fail
you. An endless cycle and its only just fucking begun.
