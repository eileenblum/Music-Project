Brace yourself for the fall. Understanding and over-thinking has saved many
from a life of false belief, my being one of them. Iâve learned to accept what
happens in the end and sometimes youâre better off if you choose to neglect.
There is a time and place for everything and I believe I never made it there in
time for fucking anything. Donât try to crack me with your therapeutic nonsense
and doing has turned me into what I have become. Because if I get my way and
have my way with you, I will destroy your every thought of what is right in
life. I dare you to get close to me, I dare you to get close to me. Iâve always
been a firm believer in this life is short nothing happens on the day that it
ends so Iâm here to clear the doubt in your head. Whatâs done is done and when
youâre dead, youâre fucking dead. I promise you, I promise you itâs gonna be a
bad one. I promise you, I promise you, its gonna be a bad one. So brace
yourself for the fallâ¦I promise you its gonna be a bad one.
