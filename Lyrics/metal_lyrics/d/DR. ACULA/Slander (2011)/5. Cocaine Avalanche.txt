As I proceed to speak a mile a minute. I'm going faster, yeah, I'm in it to win
it. My head and heart are gonna fuckin' blow another one and pace this entire
place. My losing streak is the only thing thatâs more sore than my face. Yeah -
let me tell you everything. Yeah speak to me about anything. My day, my week,
my month, my year, my life. I just wanna know anything about you. My day, my
week, my month, my year, my life. Blast off! Blast off, I canât feel anything.
Blast off. I feel like a god. Blast off. Blast off. Oh yeah fuck! Yeah, you
know I'm the million dollar man face first in a cocaine avalanche. The room
feels like its ninety-five degrees It's what keeps us coming. I'm burning up
from my head to my feet. It's what keeps us coming. It's not about the glamour,
its about the rush. I sober up at the end of the night with a twenty bag of
Kush. And you know I'm the million dollar man, face first in a cocaine
avalanche. So the moral of my story today, don't get caught up in shit if you
can't hang and just remember that these ain't your friends and you'll forget
them if this night ever ends. As I proceed to speak a mile a minute I'm going
faster, yeah I'm in it to win it. And just remember that these ain't your
friends and you'll forget them if this night ever ends. Will this night ever
end? Will this night ever end? Will this night ever end?
