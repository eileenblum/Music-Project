the moon is rising
your time is now
to come join me underground

I smell the blood in your veins
In the windows I will go

Silence. Footsteps.
Can't hear me coming

Your neck exposed
and I'll drink all I need
This plan of mine is so perfect
No one will know will know what to think of those two
Those two littles holes
Your screams fall on deaf ears

Tonight, my darling, at this moment in time
This moment is fucking mine
This moment is mine
