Standing over your bed with a bat and an axe you lay lifeless and cold
Oh my god how could you commit such a crime how could you tell such a lie
There is blood on my hands from your neck
You are now mine
Yes tell the judge this is what I had to do
Tell the jury I'm coming for them
There's splinters of wood and broken glass scattered
Around you like fucking flowers
Your pain is now beautiful
Now your dead
I leave you to rot
You've created a monster
I live for this
