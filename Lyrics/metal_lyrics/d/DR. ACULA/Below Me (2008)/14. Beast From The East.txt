Let's murder the fattest one here.
I'll drink like a gentleman, sir.

We'll party all night,
But by daylight, we are gone.
We. Are. Gone.

Your heart is the second course. [x7-8]

Now I see you,
At the hospital.
With your neck open wide,
I hope the doctor forgets you.

Now I see you,
At the hospital.
With your neck open wide,
I hope the doctor forgets everything that he knows.
