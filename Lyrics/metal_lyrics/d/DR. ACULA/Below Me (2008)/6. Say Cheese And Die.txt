We built this city on hate fueled by lust and dishonor
The birds are the only ones free
They can fly in to the sun and burn it's too late for their families
I'm torching their loved ones the ones they loved so much
They'd fuck someone without their wedding band
Tonight I'm torching this city down
The children will cry in joy they already know they're fucked
The buildings will fall, the cars will implode,
Tonight I'm torching this motherfucker down
Fucking shit
Tonight we're torching this mother fucker down
