Wasted time and health.
Pouring out your heart to secure their wealth.
A cold day in Hell,
my life will not be pitched as a product to sell.
Confessions of a fucked up soul,
fully alert and being raped of control.
Pretending nobody knows,
they drink to your accomplishments and call you a joke and if you think were not aware,
all eyes are on you,
this situation will not be ignored.
Don't bite what you can't chew.
Shutting out your input.
No fucking hold on me.
Your schemes are all old news.
Don't bite what you can't chew.
Don't bite what you can't chew.
This situation will not be ignored.
Don't bite what you can't chew
Aint got no fuckin hold on me.
Persevere rip em up from the inside out weakness showing when you turn your head.
A Silent flaw has surfaced leaving you for dead not a day in my life goes by
when I don't wander my thoughts and I'm wonderin why,
you're spineless you're spineless a venomous virus.
Contagious mother fuckers your about to expire.
We're tigers we're lions we're vicious and violent.
You'll be torn to shreds,
persevere rip em up from the inside out with your tail between your legs your final moment of doubt.
And you thought you could leave us alone in the dark but your bite didn't match your bark.
Next time you show your teeth you'll find yourself in the belly of a real beast.
We've taken our stand,
slaughtered the goats and fucked the lambs with your tail between your legs.
Useless pigs with severed heads.
