Come through hunting protectors of people.
Corrupt mother fuckers we can see straight through you.
And every sentence you state and every choice that you've made.
Is put towards your overpriced funeral parade.
Stone hands, rock chucker take you best fucking shot.
I'll fucking hit you in the face with a master lock.
Cause when the hands of the law.
Got blood in its claws, wake away your money and use your clothing as gauze.
A fucking clone war, this ain't no test.
This is not an act of misplaced emotion.
This is a citizens arrest.
Protect and serve is a myth and a fairy tail.
Breakin' all the laws you expect us to use ignorant coward mother fuckers.
Hide behind a badge while enforcing abuse.
Nation, a revelation we cannot support the scams.
Swarming in like an outbreak storm.
True justice will be had.
True justice will be had.
