I, The unhappy hole in the wall.
Parasitic life form preys and crawls.
Feverish falters modern day.
Enslaved by the suits who refuse to move.
Sanctioned off by the ones who chose.
To force their nails into unfit grooves.
To lose whats lost in a minor cost.
Evaluate pagan like iron force.
Thrown, thrown off course.
Born, born into death.
We are living in bludgeoning times.
Swimming in anger and crushed by the tides.
Long before they crossed the line.
Vowed they won't take us alive.
Push forward, Nation they can't take us alive.
Push forward, Nation they can't take us alive.
We walk on broken glass with shattered hearts were moving on,
Shark like mannerisms.
Picking up their scent of the bloodleft over,
From the violence shed.
Twenty first century trojan horse.
They welcome us in and they open the doors.
Once through the gates we fuckin' tore them apart,
Dismember the untouchables for posing as gods.
