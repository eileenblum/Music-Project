Hate on the ones who brought your name. To the place it is today, but you'd be the last to say. That anyone did anything... Wait, I thought you said that you won't change and still I sit right here today unimpressed with what you've done for yourself. Don't waste, your fucking act on me. Just be what you will be, and I'll remember you for what you are. Keep on running, running, running around, living in doubt, running. Keep on running in place but your getting anywhere. Keep on running in place but your not getting anywhere. Keep on running in place but your not getting anywhere. Honesty I don't want to know what you do when your alone. Think there's a reason nobody knows the person you used to be but I know something they don't know. You struggle with self image; your life has been a scrimmage. But when it's game time you never fuckin cross the finish. I'm minding my business and living for the minute, I hate your fucking kind. I'll wait for you to dig your own grave. I'll wait for you to dig your own grave. I'll wait... For you to dig your own grave. Pick up the shovel whenever your ready man. I'll even give you a hand. You made your bed, so Mother Fucker lie in it. Your life's a lie and a sham. Keep on running in place you'll get nowhere. Keep on running in place you'll get nowhere.
