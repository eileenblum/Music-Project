I don't fucking belong here.
Couldn't give half a dick who you are,
Left sided popularity contest.
Talkin' to me like I should know who you are.
I'm unimpressed, In fact I'm fucking sickened.
Don't know how much your drinkin' or how the fuck you get women.
Hollywood cosmetic mess, fuck your vampire songs and the way that you dress
(It's embarrassing)
Pilled out, washed up suckers on leather.
Dressed for transylvania in the boiling weather.
Please understand we ain't in this together,
With the force of a nation, closing in on you.
Crucified on the sunset strip,
with you transvestite crew,
Gross groupie chicken flock up in the van.
How man womna does it take to make, woah man.
Slow down baby dude you 'bout to get burned.
You're a long way from home,
wooden steak to the sternum bitch.
You know nothing about my kind,
Where I came from this shit won't fly.
Take you for everything no reason why,
I thought you said "You could never die".
Force you into the sunlight,
But you're not turning to ash,
Force you into a real life where you don't stand a fucking chance.
Fly bitch fly.
Lemme see your wings.
Practice what you preach and take a fucking leap.
Crush the creators of the night.
Cut them down to size.
Put to waste this awful place where wash up come to die
Crush the creators of the night cut them down to size.
Put to waste this awful place where wash ups come to die.
