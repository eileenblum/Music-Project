Your flesh will be my bride

Your sweet tasteful flesh
Will now be my bride

Swamped in the fluids
Into the vortex of forms
Touching the uncenced veil
Your sweet tasteful flesh
Will now be my bride

Awaken from lethargic state
Swamped into the fluids
In the vortex of forms

Your flesh will be my bride
The sleepers now awaken
Your sweet tasteful flesh
Will be my bride

Inhale the acrid stench
As it slowly spreads
The malignant growing inside
Feeding upon your flesh

Swamped in the fluids
Into the vortex of forms
Touching the uncenced veil
Awaken from lethargic state
Swamped into the fluids
In the vortex of forms

Bursting from within
As disease penetrates
Deep into your inwards
Antropomorphia

Your flesh will be my bride
The sleepers now awaken
Your sweet tasteful flesh
Will be my bride

Your flesh will be my bride

"...disease and illness, with whom we're married even before we're born, will feast upon our carcass 'til we rot..."
