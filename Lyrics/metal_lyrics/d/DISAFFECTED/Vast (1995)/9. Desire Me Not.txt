Child, listen to me, child
I'll take you into the land of dreams
Where you shall forever be...

Child, listen to me, child
There's a place for you in my dreams
But desire me not more than my flesh

You can flow in seas of trust
Like stars from the old stream
But do not ever want more
From me than you can take

All I can give you is only what can be seen
But never can you reach my soul
And desire my not more than my flesh

"...be strong, o man! Lust, enjoy all things of sense and rapture: fear not that any god shall deny thee for this, I am alone: There is no god where I am"
[-- From "Liber al vel legis", A. Crowley]
