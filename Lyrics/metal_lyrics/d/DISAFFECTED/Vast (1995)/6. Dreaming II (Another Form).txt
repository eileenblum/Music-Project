Night... oh, dark mother
Guide me... through my thoughts
Dreaming... of another form
Oh, night... dark mother

From the mountain top I'll wait for your sign
Take me... for I'm yours...

Reach for my hand, into your silent throne
Entwine my body and deliver, deliver me again

Oh, night... dark mother

Mother hear... I claim at your immensity
Reach for my hand, into your silent throne

Dreaming...

"...it's an ode to all creatures of the night who trust their sleep in the hands of Morpheus to carry them with his wings far across the lands of desire and delight..."
