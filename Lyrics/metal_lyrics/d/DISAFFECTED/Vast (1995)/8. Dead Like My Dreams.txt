Dead â like my dreams
Dead â forever they'll be dead...
I now acknowledge
As my senses relapse
Melting within the absurd
And unfounded deep

Remould me at your image
Disincarnate me

Control me, replace me
Expose all my will

I've denied my vow - control me
Drown me, grind me

Dead â like my dreams
Dead â forever they'll be dead...

I cannot confront the shattered
The twisted belief of gods omnipotence

Dead â like my dreams
Dead â forever they'll be dead...

"...this song is about a kind of living dead people. The sort of individuals who don't have dreams or don't believe in them, they are dead actually living only to fulfill someone else's dream. Of course I'm a believer."
