Ignoble decimation
Stands by myself
As death remains

Pain and confusion
Transforming my life
Happiness, happiness... dies

Gazing the blur inside
Dream in this reality of... lies
Blackened self co-exists in
Burdens of grief now ascending me

Clairvoyance of tranquility... cold

Idolize thee
Ruler of the deepest
Clairvoyance of tranquility... cold

No joy to live
Alone but we're gathered
Within this host, a deny

Within this host
We are gathered
Alone... a deny

Idolize thee
Ruler of the deepest
Clairvoyance of tranquility... cold

Cold

"...Is about someone who's trying to find true strength within himself, to face up this world of shit... and that is making him more and more "cold" towards life, frozen his emotions..."
