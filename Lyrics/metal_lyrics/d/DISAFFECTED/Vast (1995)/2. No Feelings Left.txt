Despair is queen of her own bleak bourne
Scattered through its wide domains
Tiny windows hanging in the void
Like mirrors left and castaway

Feel the eyes of despair upon you
Feel her hook catch and snag your heart

No feelings left or any last promise
No feelings left only this painful passion

Fearless through the gardens of grief
Neither I need sorrow or relief
I've got no feelings left

Her clammy cold skin, musky and pungent,
Like the skin snake crossing through your throat

As tangible as the old velvet, as a shredding rake-thin
Nothing is left untouched, nothing remains pure

I've got no feelings left

Feel the eyes of despair upon you
Feel the hook catch and snag your heart

Fearless into the gardens of grief
I've got no feelings left

"...the most faithful daughter of hate â despair. Yet hate is just inverted and twisted love, but despair is nothingness and emptiness inside. Everyone of us has a little of that, as for myself, well, I think I've no..."
