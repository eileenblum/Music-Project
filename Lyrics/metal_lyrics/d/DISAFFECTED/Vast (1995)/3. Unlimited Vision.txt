"I was standing in darkness beholding the signs of ancient wisdom,
To evoke the pagan gods,
As old as time itself,
Only to reach through visions...

And now I'm standing before its unlimited vision
Rise forth, ancient ones, I've summoned you
From the depths of earth
Standing before this unlimited vision..."

Solving in the cauldron of our ancient makers
The mixed limbs of raw matter and the pure essence of it all,
More than just simple life or any complex diversity
More than any pattern of thought that you can bear in mind

Even before time
The complex simplicity of life

Standing before
This unlimited vision

Was acknowledged by the ancient ones

Vision, vision

Now some claim to reach the realms of purity
But have they even seen the gleams of this quest?

Vision, vision

Are they even able to get close to it
By using unhuman like rational thoughts

I was standing in darkness
Beholding the signs of ancient wisdom,
To evoke the pagan gods,
Face its unlimited vision

Rise forth, ancient ones, I've summoned you
From the depths of earth
Standing before this unlimited vision

"...I believe in the tales of the ancient gods, creators of our world, who lay frozen in the depths of earth to rise one day and rule their land. This true belief can only be achieved through visions and I've been granted with that gift."
