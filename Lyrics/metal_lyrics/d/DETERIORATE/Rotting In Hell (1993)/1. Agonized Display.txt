See your so called savior
I hold his fate in my hands
Thou shall not pass judgement
But leave it to the people to decide

What will happen to his life?
Crucify him!
Crucify him!

Are you certain of your decision?
Crucify him!
Crucify him!

To the cross this man will remains in complete inversion
This blasphemy must be punished
On this morning you will die
In the city of Golgotha

Nail him to the cross
Watch him bleed as a mortal man
So-called son of god will die with thieves at his side

This is Jesus, King of the Jews
Dying on the cross
Come down off the cross
Lord, if youâre the son of god
Then take yourself down from that holy cross

âForgive them father for they not know what they doâ
Your father is dead and soon you will all walk
Into the kingdom of the dead
Bow your head and pass away
Demonstration of agony
Only knowing to disbelief
