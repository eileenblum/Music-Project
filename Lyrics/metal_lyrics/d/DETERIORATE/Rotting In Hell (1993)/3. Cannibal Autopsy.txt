Victim of the native clan
Culture of certain violence
Captive, hunters of the dead
A prayer to the gods of the falling fire

An edible religious sacrifice
Soon to be a tribal piece
Preparation of mortal meat
Puddles of helpless human blood
Exposed from curiosity
Searching for future medicine

Remains of warm mutilated flesh
Organ tissues decay on the earth
Bow to the leader of the sky
They prey cannot survive

Antidote for the medicine man
Cannibal autopsy
Blood soaked victims
Edible autopsy
Witch doctor ritual
Cannibal autopsy

Feast!
Diseased skin for worms to feast
Lacking limbs, extract of bones
