Anguish of a thousand years
Gods of flesh take their form
Angel born of everlasting hate
Conjuring sinners and whores

What perversity is this?
Fiendish spirits rape the earth
Visit graves of the slaughtered ones
Plague of mortality burning like a flame

Fall beyond the grace of God
Shadow of a certain end
Behold the names engraved in stone
Bells of Sodom begin to toll

Youâre burning deep in hell
Witches burning at the stake

Curse of the ancient one
Immortality of the gods
Prayers of everlasting pain
Persecute the holy one

Praying that their kingdom may not come
Infant soul of the son will die
Crown his kingdom in pain
Crucify the chosen one
Watch him decompose
