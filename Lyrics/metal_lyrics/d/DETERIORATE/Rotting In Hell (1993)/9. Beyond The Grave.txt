Putrid stench of horror
Reeking from the crypts of eternity
Sins of all men spawning intensified evil

Chaos, anarchy and hatred
Fill the world like a sea of blood
Files of decomposed bodies
Reeking the stench of death

Festering in diseased streets
Corpses lie rotting
Leaking body fluid
Sifting through the files of the dead

Cannibal savages sifting through files of the dead
Feasting on decayed remains
Inhuman with no emotion
Decadence prevails and evil lives on

Festering in diseased streets
Corpses lie rotting
Leaking body fluid
Sifting through the files of the dead

All life has seized
The world sees its end
Demons from beyond have conquered
The earth, a living hell is born
And human life is massacred
