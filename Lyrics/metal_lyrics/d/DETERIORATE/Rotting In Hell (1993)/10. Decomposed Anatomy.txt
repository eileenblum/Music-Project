From out of the grave
Comes a cold rotting corpse
Dead remains feasting for the feast
Pallid corpse on the wings of decay
Signs of life are ceased

To feel the end of life
And know the meaning of death
Decomposed anatomy left to wither away
Polluting the earth with a pungent stench
Maggots crawl on the flesh
Corpse tearing the decayed flesh
From its bone

Pus oozing out of infected sores
Eye sockets rot
Blood flow clots
Lividity becomes present
Liquids drift from the organs
Deterioration slowly grows
Veins turn black, organs exposed

Dehydrate
Skin turns a horrifying green
Cold, stiff and cold
Put in a box and placed in the earth
Left to rot in a cold dark void
Forever to decay
Never to be exhumed

Dehydrate
Skin turns a horrifying green
Cold, stiff and cold
Put in a box and placed in the earth
