Passed down through centuries
Of an unforgotten hatred
A bestowed obsession with evil
An effigy of the face of God
Impurities, pollution, my soul
Born into darkness
Everlasting hell fire

Holy cremation desecrates the light of heaven
With a blessing of execration

Demons of darkness chant my name in praise
By rite of birth I cast my soul into hell
Dwelling in sin and perversity
Praying for endurance to be rotting in hell

Burning my soul for eternity

Spit down upon your holy
For I shall die

Angels shed a tear bleeding Â´til they die
Sacrilege through sacrifice
Torment the evil ones to haunt
