Human life in a feeble state
Stranded alone in a hostile maze
Preyed upon by an undivine deliverance
Skeletal frames litter the ground
Demonic eyes peer out from the shadows
Cries of the damned echo aloud

The smell of decay, remnants remain
Organs inverted inside out
Dismember limbs, haunting screams
The remains of the dead are devoured

Corridors fill with puddles of blood
Vicious attacks from demons above
Sheds of flesh are ripped from your body
Blood pours out of your wounds

Beg for your life
Pray for forgiveness
The hand of god is too weak to save you

Demon apparition
Execration of pain
Evil is unleashed

Scream as your soul is devoured
Heathen souls cursed with damnation
In a stagnant domain of decay
No chance for salvation
In hell they remain
Remain!

Morally diseased creatures
Cursed with abomination
Harvesting the seeds of the suffering

Cast into the blackness of hell
Forever to rot in pain
Devitalizing the image of blood
Infernal majesty will reign forever
