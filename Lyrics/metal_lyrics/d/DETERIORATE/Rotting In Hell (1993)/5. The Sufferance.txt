The sun does not shine on this day or perversity
For a hideous creature of deformity will find birth
This torment placed upon by your so-called perfect god
This being of life lives life as a display

Being viewed by eyes of disbelief
Anger and hate can only intensify
This state of being

A world where the body decays and the soul cannot be seen
Where pain can be inflicted rather than absorbed
This voyage must be taken for peace to be found
Self-inflicted massacre, bleeding till the end of life

Reigning in the kingdom of decay
Revenge can be achieved
The haunting and apparitions send the others to the grave
They can be tortured for all eternity
As the endure the sufferance
