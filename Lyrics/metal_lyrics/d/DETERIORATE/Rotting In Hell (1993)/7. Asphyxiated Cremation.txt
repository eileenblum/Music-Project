Frigid hands of death
Grip my throat
Gasping for the breath of life
Suffocating rapidly
Asphyxiated cremation
Preparing to die in malignancy

Whereâs God now?

In my hour of darkness and despair
Strangulated fate
Soon to be a part of the earth

Complete misery suffering
Holding the key to the gates of the afterlife
Will my soul find rest or apparitional damnation?
Curse of mortality

Crucified in agony
In soul I will dwell
In eternity

Perpetual suffering
A tearing from the inside
The plague of death
Life ends at once

My prayers are not answered
As I am passing away
