Stricken by horror as I walk alone
Through the shadows of death
Endless torment, lost souls speaking
My name is vain

The grave is calling
Drawing me closer to the edge
The end of my life
Prepares to make its manifestation

To become one with the earth is a horrifying thought
What once was a thought is now a grim reality
Corpses lay lifeless, decomposed destiny
Withering away, purify endlessly

Suffering in torment
Decay becomes present
Body lies vacant
Desecrated by pestilence

A symbol of life is now a wretched mess
Lifeless lump of human being
Spiritual being, dying life tragically
I never imagined that I would be dead
Six feet of dirt lying over my head
Lying over my head

Maggots crawl on my flesh
Decomposed destiny

Corpses in the grave
Soul it finds no rest
