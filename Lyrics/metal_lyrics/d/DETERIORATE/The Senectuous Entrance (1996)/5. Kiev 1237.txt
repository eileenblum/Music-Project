Attack...
With conquest carved into their faces.
Riders emerge out of an eastern blaze.
Behold the tartars... Relentlessly
they storm... into battle, destroying all
who stand in their path...
Defeated adversaries, tarnish their trails.
With nefarious arrogance, thee invaders
march forth plundering the plains.
Beware the belligerent horsemen of the
heathen horde... Onward with force,
rides the wretched mongols...
towards the city of Kiev...
With swords raised, brazen tyrants
charge and crush thee impenetrable
fortress... Once protected by god,
the citadel crumbles. Besieged by flames,
golden temples burn to the ground.
As their shrines are desecrated and
robbed, christian blood flows...
Out of the ruins
the heathen horde soars...
