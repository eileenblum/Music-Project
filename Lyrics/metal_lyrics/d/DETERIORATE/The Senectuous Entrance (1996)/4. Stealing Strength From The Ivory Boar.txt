Across oceans of darkened dreams
my mind as searched for power...
Frostlike figures that influence me,
escort this husk to the forest of answers.
Here I receive knowledge under a stream
of celtic clouds... beneath me, fossilized
warriors, that fill my visions with tales of viking times. Lure me into the fields,
under the midnight crystals...
I have found the secret treasure
which glistens in the skies.
Forever my Norwegian brothers
thee unholy pelt shall be mine...
No longer will the knights of the
northern gates guard the throne....
