O glorious, deity,
your children praise you.
Accept this most sacred offering,
as a symbol of our everlasting devotion.
May you, forever reign...
All bow before, our lord.
The flayed one...
Xipe Totec...Reign... Xipe Totec...
Let us indulge in immolation...
Guide my hands, great one 
as I eviscerate the victim
Reiving the host of its essence...
I enshroud myself
in your ultimate image
Revel in skin...
All hail and pay reverence,
to the glutton of flesh...
Kneel... obedient
mortals and adore
the crimson lord...
All hail and pay reverence,
to the glutton of flesh... Xipe Totec...
Reign Xipe Totec...
