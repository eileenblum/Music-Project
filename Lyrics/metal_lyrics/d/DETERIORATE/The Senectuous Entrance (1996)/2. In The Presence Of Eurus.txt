Above the woods, among the trees, 
Demiurge of air
Takes flight... Rising over the mountains.
Flying into the high fog...
Since the commencement of creation, his lungs have sculpt the lithosphere. He is the omnificent of the skies, thee almighty wind king.
As dusk engulfs the heavens
I anxiously await his arrival.
Throughout the thundering torhills off in the distance, his roar echoes...
With anger and rage, Eurus appears...
Trumpets of blustering howls announce the forthcoming fury.
Accompanied by bolts of white radiance.
In a catastrophic current of tempestuous swirling squall,
His enormous vehement wings mangle the land...
Bless me Eurus with your foul blistering breezes...
Absorbing infinite energy, impious thoughts grow stronger.
