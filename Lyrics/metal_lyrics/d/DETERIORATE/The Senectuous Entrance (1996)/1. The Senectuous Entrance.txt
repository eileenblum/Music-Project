Come forth... My furious ancient ancestors,
Come forth... The Senectuous Entrance,
Shall now and forever be open.
Forgotten entities from the deep, enter me...
For I am thee celestial bridge that extends beyond this world.
I am the key to divulge thee impure...
Those who wish to discover... Join me...
Join me. Be not afraid, take my hand.
Close your eyes and envision nigrescence.
As we together wander downward...
Down into the forlorn bathyal...
Here the numinous seal of the forbidden shall be broken...
With inconceivable wraith, my elders shine...
Can you feel them,
Do you feel them manifesting within...
At last we the venerable legion can enjoin humanity...again...
Cross over... Freedom looms...
Above the murky waters of this dismal dungeon, our nemesising empire awaits.
