Traitors in the palace,
Across the ravaged land this lake is petrifying me.
Break bread with the heretic,
Calcified beasts bear witness to the symphony.
Angels sinning in the heavens,
Blinded zealots pay tribute to sustain the gluttony.
Taking cover in the sky,
But every single vessel's lifted by the rising tide.

Weaker begets weak begets strong begets stronger,
All born equal shall remain as such no longer.
Stronger begets strong begets weak begets weaker,
Swords borne of shackles as the sought becomes the seeker.
Weaker begets weak begets strong begets stronger,
All born equal shall remain as such no longer.
Stronger begets strong and the stronghold, it is weakening,
Traitors in the palace now make way for the king.

Smashing the hornet's nest,
Upon his land they drop like flies,
Baptised, screaming "I confess!"
This lake absolves and petrifies.
Where is he now?
A monument to tyranny,
Statues alive behind the eyes,
Their shadows grow as daylight dies.

Make way for the king.
Make way for the king.
Make way for the king.
Make way for the king.
All hail.
