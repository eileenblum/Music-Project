Welcome to a place where the cold is strong,
Where the winters are slow and the road is long,
The mountain is my master,
A slave to the climb but I must climb faster.
Who is that man walking into white?
He beckons to me and disappears from sight,
It tears at my face but I bear the storm,
It matters not for the bonds keep me warm.

Welcome to a place where you're far from home,
Where the walls are white and you struggle alone.
He cannot see my face, he's getting worse,
At the peak of insanity, climbing in reverse.
Storms in his eyes give light to my cause,
Saving his mind to animate this corpse,
His fits intensify, these bonds must tighten,
Trembling, his stare knows no horizon.

I feel no pain. I know no fear.
And I see no God up here.

Upon the frosted fang.
Who is that man beckoning finger aloft?
Though I fall I pick myself up,
It matters not for the rocks are so soft.
There can't be another, for I am alone.
Finding respite, sheltered by a stone.
I close my eyes and cover my ears,
The man disappears.

I see the mountain.
I see clouds follow me.
My eyes cripple horizons,
Beyond what man has ever seen.
I lust for the mountain,
The summit calls my mortal soul:
"Cast yourself from the peak.
That I might swallow you whole."

Welcome to a place where the river never dries,
Where the road goes on and the winter never dies.
This is my march where my will never bends,
Where the mountain is tall and my climb never ends.
