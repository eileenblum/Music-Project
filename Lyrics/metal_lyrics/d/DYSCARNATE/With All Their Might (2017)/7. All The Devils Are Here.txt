Mechanical behemoth, golem of the sky,
To be closer to the gods would be to burn alive,
Like a hound without a bone chasing cautionary tale,
Screaming for blood until the taste becomes stale.

The flames below appear, it's not fight or flight I fear,
I dread the dead, for Hell is empty, all the devils are here.

As the rounds run down and the rain seeps through,
It's deep in circuits where the blood dilutes,
And the gear's worn down and the sun dawns,
How light bathes the floor it storms toward me now,
As the rounds run down and the rain seeps through,
It's deep in circuits where the blood dilutes,
And the gear's worn down and the sun dawns,
How light bathes the floor as it storms toward me now.

The engines roar screaming murder!

The sun is an illusion, no light upon my back,
Airborne leviathan, all guns blazing, prepare to attack,
Howling at the trigger but the silence brings no pain,
Without means of murder, purpose ignites flame.

The flames below appear, it's not fight or flight I fear,
I dread the dead, for Hell is empty, all the devils are here.

As the rounds run down and the rain seeps through,
It's deep in circuits where the blood dilutes,
And the gear's worn down and the sun dawns,
How light bathes the floor it storms toward me now,
As the rounds run down and the rain seeps through,
It's deep in circuits where the blood dilutes,
Chaos carves across the sky,
I promise death and we burn alive.
