There's nothing left that's right,
There's nothing right that's left,
I've forgotten myself, this is all wrong,
The urge to close my eyes is strong,
Once more towards the light,
There's nothing left that's right.

My tongue is in the water where the tide is white,
My heart is in my mouth, and nothing seems right.
A drop in the ocean or tree in the hollow,
The truth of existence is a bitter pill to swallow.

In the search for my mind I tossed it over the side,
This doesn't feel right, this feeling's hard to describe.
What should I throw and what should I keep?
Who knew what we would find in the waters of sleep?

I'll keep the other vessel at arm's length,
For it is now crewed by men of ill-intent,
They break the bones of those outside their tribe,
Theirs is a scripture to which I will not subscribe.

I'm against the tide and time,
This feeling's hard to describe.

There's nothing left that's right,
There's nothing right that's left,
I've forgotten myself, this is all wrong,
The urge to close my eyes is strong,
Once more towards the light,
Out of mind and sight,
There's nothing left that's right.

They say a few good men is all the world needs,
But they're drowning in a hole which does nothing but bleed,
I've got one chance to pull it back from the brink,
But my boat is full of water and I'm starting to sink.
This horse is lame, it falls over waves,
It's pale and it's breathless but works like a slave,
My raft in tatters, it's sure to capsize,
My knuckles are white from holding onto the sides.

The keeper stokes the fires of the beacon at the top,
Of a tower that drives us all onto the rocks.
I thought the water would be quiet I was right,
They warned me of the lighthouse but it shines so bright.

I'm against the tide and time,
This feeling's hard to describe.

There's nothing left that's right,
There's nothing right that's left,
I've forgotten myself, this is all wrong,
The urge to close my eyes is strong,
Once more towards the light,
Out of mind and sight,
There's nothing left that's right.
