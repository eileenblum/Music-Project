I am the flail of God,
The sickness in me they admire,
I speak, hear no blasphemy,
I'd strike the sun if I desired.
Follow me to the Elysian Fields,
Where men are made martyrs by the order of my seal,
Our flame forever bright, no fire here extinguished,
We the divine! We the distinguished!

I soar like an eagle,
These dogs have never fled before such evil,
I stand before white, red and black,
We are the wolves and we'll tear the flesh right from your back.
Stand with me before the gods of old,
Proclaim my word across this world,
These worthless rats, this plague that I shall smite,
Mark my words, we'll hammer them down with all our might.

Break the walls, storm the gate,
I am Rapture Incarnate,
I am Rapture! (I am Rapture!)
Do you hear the word of God?
Loose your bows and draw your swords,
Draw your swords! (Draw your swords!)

Your eyes are wide and white, what a sight to behold,
You are crippled, blue and cold,
Your mouth is in the dirt, leaving a bitter taste,
Your body decomposes, I'm nourished by your waste.

Blasphemer,
Foul deceit runs through their teeth and rots beneath,
Redeemer,
Strain to drain the vein I taste to take the pain (the pain) away,
See me reign.
