Shadows provide the only sense of safety,
Seed of consciousness absorbed not just by living things,
Our race denied, existence our purpose,
Gears pushed through electric pulse, where power pulls the strings.

One man shall stand,
In the face of Armageddon,
All flesh shall feel the strain,
All hail new land,
In the lakes of retribution,
He is living revolution.

Aware, alive, overturn the fortress,
Find yourself a scattered camp, a denounced deity,
Between the eyes there's no soul or purpose,
One collective mind prevails, a cognitive machine.

I won't be bound by bones or blood,
I won't be dragged through the stones and mud,
I stand tall deep in electric lakes,
We bury our grave mistakes.

Hive mind, breach the fortress,
Evolve, second reign,
One pulse purges darkness,
Human, no bound, no chain.

Backbreaker, forsaker,
Destroyer and creator.

One man shall stand,
In the face of Armageddon,
All flesh shall feel the strain,
All hail new land,
In the lakes of retribution,
He is living revolution.

When the back breaks the kingdom will fall.
