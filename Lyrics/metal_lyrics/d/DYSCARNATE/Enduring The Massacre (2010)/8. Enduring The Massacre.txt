Arise, leviathan. He who seeks justice must bear witness to the betrayal. Cast down for most glorious treason: confined to the universe, chained to mortality. Â 

The ash of the titans, scattered amongst those so weak - the once majestic behemoth reduced to a pedestal. Pillar of the heavens - pinnacle of the Earth, bearing the disease - this encumbrance is terminal.

Begging for petrification, doomed to witness triumphant conquest. The infected spoils of war trickle upon his scowl. And with hands that heal to ruptures in the skin, the stream gushes unbounded to contaminate their sufferer.Â 

Despicably enveloped - beyond recognition, slowly crucifying the endurer of their opulence. Gratitude is a sickness, death is the solution. The march is now intensified, the massacre crescendos in accordance with the scriptures. Artificial extinction born of fire.Â 

The inferno spreads unbounded to contaminate their sufferer - with a smoldering desire to abandon his post. Like the blazing foliage now expunged from that scowl. Â The time has come and gone - occupation is complete. Thrusting the flags into his ward.Â 

Terminal infection is swiftly accomplished. Such a rancid contamination - injected through their triumph - his digits desperately plugging wounds. Spewing endless sewage - streaming unbounded to contaminate their sufferer.Â 

Stand and deliver - the pestilence is strife. Serve and protect - disease has become life.Â
