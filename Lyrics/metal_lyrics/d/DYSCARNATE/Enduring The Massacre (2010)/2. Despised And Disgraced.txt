Impoverished by negligence, a state which cannot be redeemed. An abused contentment plagues all who yield, for the price of this existence is as insignificant as themselves. Delusive efforts from those with rule; fail to encourage the sacrifice.

Fulfilling the purpose for what must be done with repeated mistakes that inflame the infection. As we work to build a proud dominion to suit the vagrancy and all its needs. They hand out more reasons to become part of the problem and provide more ways out of an honest solution. Thus completing this cycle of defeat. A catalyst to a foreseen depression, forcing more and more to succumb. Ensnaring addicts by sustaining their weakness, focusing efforts on an unworthy cause, helping no one but themselves. To revere this path to prosperity is to embrace the errors of a crippled foundation, an accepted status that carries no burden, a false sense of security. Disrupting the natural order of things to create anarchy. The menial shall despise these foes, although they proved the means to their trend, forever bound to this servitude. Serving a demanding and oblivious supremacy.
