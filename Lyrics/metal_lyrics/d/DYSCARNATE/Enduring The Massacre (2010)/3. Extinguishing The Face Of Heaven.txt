The entity is one never to be looked upon, with a wrinkled shroud â creased with loyalty
A sacrifice fulfilled with screams upon completion, the sharpened persuader reveals ruby secretion.
Emergence from pride â entwined with the soil
Meeting face to face but not in person
Desperate to fall â entrenched in the flesh
Before words ended worlds; âOpen Fireâ.
Destined for the land of the enterprising one - within the empire of the rising sun, where the dirt unfolds to reveal skin â flesh targets flesh â respond in kind.
Animation ceasing, life force decreasing, Operation Downfall, butcher them all.
All art is based on deception
The canvas torn â part of the masterpiece
Musing upon endless beauty â but making the mark before spewing creativity
The friendly silhouettes are all squatting before the camera.
Animation ceasing, life force decreasing, Operation Downfall, butcher them all
Animation ceasing, guns for hire
Operation Downfall, open fire.
The thousand yard stare â cut short by nine-hundred
Kill or be fulfilled â only then see the end of conflict.
