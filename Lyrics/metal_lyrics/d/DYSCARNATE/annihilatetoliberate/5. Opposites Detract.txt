Crimson faced and riddled with scars. Caricature of anguish - clutching at any cause and screaming faintly at the innocence. Blame free ignorance - whats done is won - standing strong and defiant: this war is fucking on.Â 

Take a look at the inner sanctum - infested with representations/interpretations. Those who wander the golden path await their rewards. Neon fruits are always ripe for the harvest, and the concrete messiah - with a stare so blank - advocates the disposal of all.Â 

Idolized in all of his forms - fashioned from plastic enthroned upon almighty convenience. Whores for mere pence per time - will you have a slice of salvation? Arrogance embossed in speech - scum filled declaratives insistent only upon themselves.Â 

Does the caricature scream differently? Infecting the words which all bear his name. Opposites detract from the obvious - gazing past the eyes of rational thought.Â Lines of judgement become blurred. Does desire spawn from need or lust? Instinct holds a certain power.

Launching offensive spawning from their enemy. Striking the charlatans with their own mistakes. Weakling bastards - whats done is won - crippled and beaten; this war has just begun.
