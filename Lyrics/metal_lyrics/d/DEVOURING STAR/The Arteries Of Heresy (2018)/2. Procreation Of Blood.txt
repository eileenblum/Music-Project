"Each act and form of sin are witness of God."

Witness the very essence of procreation:

An everlasting climax of rot, debauchery
And ecstasy blooming through ordeal.

The proclamation of divine work is all around us.

Every piece of it, is a part of the great paradigm.

And every soul lost serves as testimony for the grand work.

This world of flesh has sunk into the abyss.
And the crowning of sin is upon us!

If disobedience serves
As a divine service.
Then surely the heights of Heavens
Exist in the pits of perdition.
And surely this travesty of life,
Is the great tribulation.

We are nothing more than worms
Drying under the light of the sun.
Nothing more than a breathless breath
In a cosmos of feces.
But alas, we were given sin
And it is sin that determines us.

This world of flesh has sunk into the abyss.
And the crowning of sin is upon us!

Truly, so great is the love of God, that each act of sin would bring us closer to Him. For through men was sin conceived into the world.

We are His image. Every disease, famine and pest ridding the world, every birth to a deformed child is a part of His gospel.

So vast is His splendour, and so great is our blessing to bear witness, breathe and live through Him.

So tear our spirit apart slowly amidst time. This is your divine harvest. And we are its crop.
