"Ascension through Sin or how the act of Sin would be divine."

Cast me into the depths of insanity!

You holy whore, you decrepit whore.

Here is my vessel and here I present my arteries.

Fill them with the intoxicating fumes of your spirit,

For I have lost myself in it,

And thus I would see myself consumed by it.

And so I resent His word to the bitter end.

Have I not given all that I held dear?

And have I not seen that all my wishes would come null?
My bones are crumbling
Into the currents of time.

Here is my vessel!

And here is your testimony!
A body veiled in crimson scars,
To give manifest to your word.

As I wither away into the depths of time,

These grand revelations of the great nothing,

Turn my spirit hollow, and my will to ash.
As I gaze into the depths of her madness.

Oh holy whore!
Oh decrepit whore!

My ashes will add,
To the vast foundations
Of her perpetual altars!
