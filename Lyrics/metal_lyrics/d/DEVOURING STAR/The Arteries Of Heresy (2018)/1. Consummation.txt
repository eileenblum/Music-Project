"And sin entered the world through Adam."

The world is my temple,
See that it's halls are vast and deep with filth.
My word is a garden, spread throughout.
The thorns of its plants are my sanguine fruit.

Above is the sun,
Below is the void of your heart.
Behold, and see that therein lies your salvation.
If it was the depths of hell you were looking for,
You had found them here.

This is is the consummation of carnality and divinity!

Through these vessels of flesh and blood,
Comes a stillborn sacrifice.
Something far greater in splendour,
Than the triviality of banal subsistence.

Crawl my children, crawl through an ocean of blades.
Bleed and wither. Take of my body and drink of my blood.
Eat of my fruit, eat and perish.

Your sacrilege will serve as
A foundation for aeons to come,
And as a bitter monument for
The depths of purgatory itself.

There is no light bright enough to surpass this, and nothing that could exceed,
That which is found through her body, and the depths of your soul.
Our existence is the gateway to her spirit.
So open the veins to your hearts, act and draw closer!
