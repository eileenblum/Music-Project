As there is to all things,
So there is an end to us.
Not in the grandeur of salvation,
But in the arms of perdition.
For we are the progeny
Of a thousand year corpse.
The heirs of a hollow grave
And the apostles of whoredom.

Her arteries reside in the veins of this world!

And therefore her spirit breathes in our veins,
Like abrasive blades!
Let the soil of this world turn into infertile ash.
And let the hope of men be turned void.

With the passion of fire, we embrace our coming end!
And the consummation between her and this world.

Her spirit burns like the brightest sun
Cleansing this earthly tissue of its filth.
And once again it breathes
Life into another aeon.
Hope had never abandoned us
It never coexisted.
The heavenly image was flawed
And deceived by itself.

Through carnality and ecstasy,
Into the currents of time!
Through sin and blood,
Into the depths of Hell!
