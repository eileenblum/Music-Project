"The temptations of Sin and self punishment."

You, seekers of divine forgiveness;

I will lead you astray.

Your ordeals will bring you to the springs of drought,

And all that you held dear, will turn out hollow.

I will see that your ideals of divine splendour,
Are torn apart like carrion by vultures.
For my body is a vortex,
Awaiting to swallow you into its depths.

So shallow are the souls of men;

Fallen prey to temptation.
Bear witness you children,
To how I consume them!

Come to me you of the seed of Cain,

And I will caress you in the thorns of my embrace.

You feast on the fruit of my loins,
And nourish upon your affliction.

Take us into the arms of nothingness!

Your enthrallment complete, your nullification unrevocable,
You take a step further into the shrines of condemnation.

Verily, within Her lies the tomb of an era,
And the key to our descent to ascension.

And our inevitable end.
