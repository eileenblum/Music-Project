And hereby
Praise the sporadic relation
The beginning
And the necessary
For without one
There is no other...

You wish that time would bend
But it is merely a blind hope
Wish that it would not consume
But fulfill
It is the thought that bends
As does the other

And where this is a purpose to eradicate
The other is
And was
And will be
Perpetual change

And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.

And hereby
Praise the sporadic relation
The beginning
And the necessary
For without one
There is no other...
