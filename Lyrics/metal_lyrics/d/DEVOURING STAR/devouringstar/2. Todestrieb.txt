Come spirit that scours the earth
Let the womb fill with fire
And the thought awake from slumber
For this is the moment the seal is broken
And the bindings cut
For This is what He hid
For This is what He feared

Bring forth the anguished souls
In whom the cause is hidden
in the hands that commense the deed
When the flock is gathered

Fear lies in the mind of the blind
Who seek shelter behind the curtains of illusion

A preparation for the prayer
To become once one with all
Driven by the instinct of sin
Let the thought awake from slumber

This is not a place for reason
Nor a gesture, a dim unsettled cry for warmth
This is a salvation, a purpose
To see with vision that dwells in secrecy

Which entangles to a constant thirst when found
The womb will lie as another tomb
