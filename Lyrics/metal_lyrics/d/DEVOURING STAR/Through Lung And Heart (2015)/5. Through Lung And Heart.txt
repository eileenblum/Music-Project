And so...
The spear impales the gate.
And the light shines through the hole.
And all twists towards a certain center...

Even the air
And the very skies
The firmament is on fire...
Surrender yourself, for your heart is ready
And the eye opens
Light of an aeon
Fire of unknown terror
Shine through lung and heart for I am ready
Truly, the eye opens!
A compulsive voice
Which trembles even the smallest detail of the soul;
You must return
But you will never return

So the psyche merges into the fire
What was matters no more
For now you have become terror
The devourer of it all

Shine through me
For I will never return
