Oh, hear the gospel of the slit throat;
How all words vanish in complete harmony.
And they speak in perfect silence.
More than was ever given for them to pronounce.
And their eyes, empty as they are.
See more than was ever granted for them to see.

Those who now dream in abysmal dimensions.
Those who suffocated in their endless adulation.
Were broken by the supreme void.

Their suffering is what drives them;
It is brought to the extent
Where they overcome zealotry
And truly become a part of death.
Slowly as their earthly carcasses vaporize in their graves.
They dream of becoming once again.
And their dreams are of suffering!
