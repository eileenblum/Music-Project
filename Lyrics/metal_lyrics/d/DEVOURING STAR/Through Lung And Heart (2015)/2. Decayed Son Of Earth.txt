Worms!
You who feast upon the soil of the lost son of Earth.
You will perish in your gluttony!
When you flesh becomes redundant.
You will be devoured by your own insolence!

Then the very air you breathe will burn and blister your skin

And your sight will bleed out.
There will be no light left for your kind.

Perish!
