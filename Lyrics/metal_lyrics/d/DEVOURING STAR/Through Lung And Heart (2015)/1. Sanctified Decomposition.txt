Oh, brethren... how far have we come?
And furthermore, how far will we go?

Until the very last shard is broken
And merged
Only to be broken again
Perpetually
The sanctified decomposition!
To shatter the very cell until it rests in the intended form
In nothing. In everything
Complete us... Degrade us!

Rest assured
Our passion is fulfilled in the very root of our own absence.
Therefore the point of potential is reached when we are shattered in you.
And you in us. And all in singularity.
Let us sing in the choir of the cleansing fire.
Break us... Release us!
Only to merge again in nothing
