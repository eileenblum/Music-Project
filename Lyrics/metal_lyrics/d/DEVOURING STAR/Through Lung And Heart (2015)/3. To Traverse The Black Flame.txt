Thou lost spirit.
Tell me of how you searched.
Found and went through the black flame.
To eat of His idol
Was it replenishing?

To conquer the malign sensation
Of the profound blood.

And tell me how you were intoxicated
By the boiling chalice.
Was it to dim your vision...
...or rather clear it?

And last...tell me was it the point where you came to see
That the heavy climb higher...
...the one so weary...
Had never soothe you
But had only grasped you lower.

You are a cursed spirit
And hence you walk the earth
Drink of the blood
Eat of the idol
Until shattered
