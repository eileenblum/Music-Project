If death's true color is shining pure white
Then life is black like a demon soul night
Aspire - arrogance like funeral pyre
Envenom - kills but stimulate phenom

Hear me now - wolf pack will loom
Hear me now - where is our doom?

If end is found rotting under the grass
Then death is priceless - all in life surpassed
Free will - was mere a dream to kill
All lies - we're all wolves in disguise

Snake up an eager nun's thighs
Beckoning of hypocrite's reprise

Twisted your dream time and a half
Your truth it sounded like a laugh

Fuck you - poison fangs can't sink in through
Fuck you - where is our doom?
