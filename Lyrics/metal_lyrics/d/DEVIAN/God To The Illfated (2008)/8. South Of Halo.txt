Failing sleep, falling awake, impressions
of death's choking in its wake
Failing sleep, falling apart make impressions
to die for
Clenching fist - hand that feeds
Granting life sorting out the bad seed
Failing sleep, falling awake by impressions
at death's door

South of Halo
I'm a failing sun and a damage already done

Pain shoots in, sin after sin,
rotten scent of the forced upon must believe in
Pain shoots in, frost stiffens joints
make you lose your hold on to
Wide we gaze, scarred up face
Proof of a life outside of the maze
Pain shoots in, sin after sin,
tell me who gives a fuck now?

What have you been praying for?
Tell me what you have been praying for?

Why do you pray?
Fuck me; I'm blessed with time in Hell!

Hourglass, time has its pass,
absorb it you didn't - you don't own yourself
Hourglass, your time has passed,
your dirt-rest awaits you
Console your tears, realize fears
A coward's blind faith is a broken spear
Hourglass, time has its pass,
bow down, still get nothing
