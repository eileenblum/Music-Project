Filthy lord almighty and the timid
Gather coward's bleak
Cheer around your sacrificial pyres
Where dead children reek

Pariah am I
Messiah goodbye

Cancerous thorn
Merciless scorn
Abundant blood sore

Filthy king almighty, lay your eyes
Your manor draped in shit
Dispose of the reeking carcass
Lies, you're a monument of it

Nights of un-wishing well
Scared the little sheep to hell
No life put on display
I'll take you all away

Retarded, bastard, ill
Master revise
My ill voice lets rejoice
I'm a nightmare surprise
