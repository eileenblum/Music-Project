Better dig this in the deepest of holes
Only thing to be carved is your soul
Taken away

Apocalyptic, the hammer will fall
Personal eclipse lets blackness end all
Progeny betray

Enemy
Flesh debris
Absentee
Death flies free

The Unspoken

Better cloak this in the darkest of shrines
Blade of dawn lets blood flow like red wine
No remorse

Assassin from shadows a murder suspect
Creator of windows will leave you defleshed
From a life a divorce

Cause and effect will leave you dead and wrecked
Die

Surreptitious, all-seeing eye
Burning lead liquefies

Always cloak this in the darkest of shrines
Closed casket funeral far from benign
Taken away

Apocalyptic, the hammer will fall
Personal eclipse lets blackness end all
No remorse, a torn, limbesque bouquet
