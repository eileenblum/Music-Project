Abolish God through attrition I know what I choose
Don't trust the priest a paedophile wolf on the loose
A boiling-mass hysteria a cancer has grown
Death out of light lies deep within where power is overthrown

I want what's inside you to die

The dead are free to rise again in Hell they all roam
My hate is bright and ambitious I take risks on my own
Your pain is watched with empty eyes indifferent and cold
Alluring wretched mockery perverse sins of old

There is nothing for you here
There is nothing for you anywhere

I fuck your faith as a ninewinged serpent
There's seven ways to die and one to burn
I fuck your faith as a ninewinged serpent
To blindfold head like hole I won't return

Don't sell me fear my war with you is with eyes open wide
The screaming skulls all tell a truth you murder to hide
The revelations I adore you endure without choice
Somethings are better left unsaid listen closely to my voice

I want what's inside you to die
Fuck you farther so I can sin
Your murky tentacles can't reach within

I fuck your faith as a ninewinged serpent
There's seven ways to die and one to burn
I fuck your faith as a ninewinged serpent
To blindfold head like hole I won't return

Ministry is a misery by nature besieged
The flesh from bones are torn incite a beast off the leash
Broken halfblind you cry for help straight out of your book
I don't know anyone who's take a piss to even look

Fuck you farther so I can sin
Your murky tentacles can't reach within

There is nothing for you here
There is nothing for you anywhere
