Eerie sounds, binding curse, indiscrete perverse
Hunger ablaze, devious ways of thrilling thrust
The soul combusts
The hizzing of cloven tongues, screams yet unsung
The blaze in the flesh, the serpent will thresh
Burn out the lungs
Fire as cold as the burning of ice, pierce for demise
Venom entice, pierce for demise, as ice

Rise for carnal spree
And heresy
Angel sodomy
And heresy

And bind the darkness tight, shameful delight
That's dirty and stained, arraigned and flawed
Brings us closer to God
Bloodchilling, uncaging the beast, poison apple feast
The plunge and the trust, the animal lust
Daughter of the priest
The pain and the flesh is all of our own, snake unatone
Salvation's headstone, snake unatone, our own

Rise for carnal spree
And heresy
Angel sodomy
And heresy
Heresy

And get closer to God
I am poison of induction
I am an angel of destruction
I am lightning of desire
Wheres fates will perish in the fire
Burn!!!

A wretched smile where sunlight fails
Twisted moans ring the hall
The dead face, ominous disgrace
The pain is the truth, the truth in us all and our fall

Rise for carnal spree
And heresy
Angel sodomy
And heresy
Heresy
