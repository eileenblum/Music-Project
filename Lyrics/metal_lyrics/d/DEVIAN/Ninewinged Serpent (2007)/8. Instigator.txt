Beast from grace kills your face
Independence erased
Slaves in my embrace
Eat your spirit alive
The stench of my hive
On your suffering shits I thrive and thrive

Spawn of all
I am the break an the fall of all you morons who thought I was a force of love
I will send death and chaos from my heavens above

Narcissist monolith you die you don't get shit
A grusome flesh and soul split
My love is the one of betray
Forget life of day
Ravening - you pray and you're prey

Spawn of all
I am the break an the fall of all you morons who thought I was a force of love
I will send death and chaos from my heavens above

Die for me
I was born in instigate
Blessed be
I was born to instigate
Never free
I was born to instigate
Slaves eternally
I was born to instigate war

Preacher says I love you but I don't
Preacher says I'll save you but I won't
Just give me all
I never forgive you fro what has been
I'm a snakebite love you like a guillotine

I disturb you till your too tired to sleep
My grasping hand will strangle and I laugh
When you weep
I trample shatter put an end to dreams
Swallow you eternally I'll feed on your screams

Die for me
I was born in instigate
Blessed be
I was born to instigate
Never free
I was born to instigate
Slaves eternally
I was born to kill
