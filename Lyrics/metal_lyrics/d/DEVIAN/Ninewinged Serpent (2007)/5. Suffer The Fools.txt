Hand of blood - still sacreligious ill
Watch the blood, how it floods
Through sands of time - sworn belly of scorn
Sworn by death, by grimes
And plague will rise from the land of the sun where the misery speaks

And the angel of light are the wolves
For those who see fatalities, for those who fear no noose
Liquefy, annihilate or suffer the fools

Hand of wrath - grave cannot be saved
Watch the spawn, on and on
Cursed if earth beneath, perverted minds - hell's devotees
Cursed are we, and free

The angel of light are the wolves
For those who see fatalities, for those who fear no noose
Liquefy, annihilate or suffer

For those who believe in bitter tragedies
For those who see the misery Damnation's jewels - the fools
For they will bring you down
Suffer the fools and they will take your life
