The free will is in
Let the disobedience begin
To hate from glad
All your children have gone mad
The free will is in
Savages fucking drinking blood
In sin incinerate - on oppressor retaliate

Limitless I am distress I bow down to no law
I am the looting fucking fiend who eats the priest's flesh raw
Carnivore, a mammal whore, reborn for personal war
I don't believe what you perceive I take and live you just deceive
All your lies are fearful preachings - jaws of jackal shred your teachings
Feed the jackal

Jackal, jaws of the jackal discourage
Ravenous breeding you are bereft
Jackal, my jaws are your death

The free will you hate
Damn your cast outs but it's too late
To change to pain
All your children are insane
The free will you hate
This orgy of aging flesh is just too great
All none besides
In vice are allied

I don't believe what you perceive I take and live you just deceive
All your lies are fearful preachings - jaws of jackal shred your teachings
Feed the jackal

Feel your lies vibrating from ivory towers tall
Our bon-fire lit Pagan way of life impossible to enthrall
Feed the Jackal

Jackal, jaws of the jackal discourage
Ravenous breeding you are bereft
Jackal, my jaws are your death

A haunting tune that sticks
An ancient lunatic
Screams at the fullmoon
Where the untamed madness blooms

Feed the jackal
