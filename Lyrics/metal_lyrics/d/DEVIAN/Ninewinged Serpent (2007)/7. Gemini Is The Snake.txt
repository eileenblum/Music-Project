Death's in the making, the architect of doom opens your tomb
Cloaked in the dark, the amputation of God is on earth to draw some blood
Deep in wilderness pain shows a shimmering light
A madness to behold
Liars in wait chime damnation's bell, venom-fangs unwithheld
A tongue God's forgot
An acnient master-plot, biding-time - souls will rot
Deep in wilderness pain shows a shimmering light
A madness to behold

Evil death damnation's breath, faces of a carnage at the elders
Scent of fear through atmosphere - nafarious catalyst

The sin is in
Born in lust - turn to dust
Born in pain - life in vain, die insane

Cruel side, wolves allied - screaming ride the snake through seas on torment
Confront a death, smile your last breath - life hurts more than demise

The sin is in
Born in lust - turn to dust
Born in pain - life in vain, die insane

No fear - wreathed in flames we walk - Gemini
No fear - this storm will bear our mark - Gemini
Is the snake

Gemini

Evil death damnation's breath, the mad they dance in a ring of fire
Death you bring, devils sing - "You are death"

The sin is in
Born in lust - born in pain, die insane

No fear - wreathed in flames we walk - Gemini
No fear - this storm will bear our mark - Gemini
Is the snake
