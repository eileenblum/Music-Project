You thought you were all to me
For a promise - the great eternity
Cursed by all things we should dread
Leave me cold, the eternal night I wed

Endless grim scorn defeat
Deceived rejoicing at your feet
Pain burns as rivers of fear
Through this world, only ghosts live here

The wrath inside
The only way
Devious lust
To disobey

Dressed in blood
Henchmen of a lie
Dressed in blood to shreads they fly
Dressed in blood

Wolf of the black sun you beg to own
Save your prayers I stand alone
Loose the weight and rid the guilt
All are proud accessories of Babylon blasphemies
Make the law of what thou wilt

Dressed in blood

I can't deny the king - the king inside
Dressed in blood
I can't deny the king inside
All dressed in blood

The wrath inside
The only way
Devious lust
To disobey

You thought you were all to me
Your house beyond repair
With it's loathsome fear
And somber halls of bloodstained misery
You crave the virgin's blood
Theres no one here to save us now
So why repent and not become a self-made fucking God?

Dressed in blood
Henchmen of a lie
Dressed in blood to shreads they fly
Dressed in blood
