Walk through fire as Cain, throat of iron message the wretchedness and pain
Rattle the chain - the chain the paradise was feign

Misery
All I see

Dance with shadows pagan reign, sing as your reflection is staring insane
Rattle the chain, the chain - a cruel sadistic pain

Misery
Eternally

Rabid enslavement of ways loose momentum with dust in your lungs in the haze
Rip up the trace, rip up the trace where the phantasms finally showed their real face
Unbroken I follow the trace where the phantasms showed their real face
Unbound let loose in the chase where the phantasms showed their real face

No one will save us
And who wants to be saved?
No one will save us
There's no one here to save us
And who the fuck would want to be saved?
