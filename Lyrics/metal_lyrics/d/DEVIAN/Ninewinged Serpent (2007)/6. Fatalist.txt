Veil keeps on tangling with mind and sight
Sentenced in his own demise see delight
The killed one is buried her spirit unseen

The hangman's smile has judge demean
Rabid and frantic, the foam in the mouth
Rebellion of angels for nine days falls south
The screams of the demon - to prayers respond
The path has been altered by someone beyond

With teeth reborn, shrouded in winds ripped and torn
Leaves the fatalist forlorn

Recklessly broken and mentally ill
Injected with venom from God for a kill
Holy blood, holy murder, holy grail
King of creation sings songs of the wail

Father why do you forsake the ones who gave you everything they've ever had?
Father, do you feel lust in killing off the pawns who gave you everything they've had?

With teeth reborn, shrouded in winds ripped and torn
Leaves the fatalist forlorn
