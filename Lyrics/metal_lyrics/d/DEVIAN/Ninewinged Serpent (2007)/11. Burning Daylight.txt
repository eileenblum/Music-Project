Burning daylight fuelled by by bleeding ghosts crowd
Where the sunlight has faded the dead of night screams loud
Empty house lies restless, haunted on the hill
Where the killer waits and wants another kill still

Time to live in death I give, in death I give the love that love denies
No more wakes for lost ones' sake, for lost ones' sake grew too old too cold

For I am deah in vain
I who feed on endless pain
A woeful end in sight
Where the daylight burns

Burning daylight blazing shine for all that is to show
Starry eyes reveal the hurt with tired hollow glow
Days so bright and filled with pain no sleep and all the sin
Spiral bruises the mind to wreck what is there then to win

Burning daylight cage the beast and all that burns inside
Blurring out the borders where life and death collide
Lost inside a wasteland where creatures don't crawl
I have seen you - you are the killer on the prowl

For I am deah in vain
I who feed on endless pain
A woeful end in sight
Where the daylight burns

Onward old wings of pain
Swept away by death in vain
