Walls falling
Down to the ground
The banging

Start shaking
Hate is pounding on the door
Let me in you little shit
Your ass is fucking mine

Will ignore
How much more
Can I take
This man's mind fueled by hate
How could you
Just let him

To last another day
To last another day

I will lie again
Ignore the pain again
Please forget what I said
There's nothing wrong

I will lie again
Ignore the pain again
Please forget what I said
There's nothing wrong

The rain outside is piercing
I feel these drops start stinging
Afraid to go inside
Afraid to go inside

Afraid to go inside
Afraid to go inside
Afraid to go inside

She falls for love
She can not be alone
She bows for love

Don't fade away
Life is supposed to hurt

Don't fade away
Life is supposed to hurt

Don't fade away
Life is supposed to hurt

Don't fade away
Life is supposed to hurt
