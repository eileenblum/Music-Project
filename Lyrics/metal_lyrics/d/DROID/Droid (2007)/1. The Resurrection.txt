Pain â here comes the angel slayer
Pain â here comes the fire fight
Pain â here comes the final battle, hells on my side

Pain â I am the soul collector
Pain â I am the fear you fight
Pain â I am the one who stalks you, I live inside

There will be hell to pay
Let me through and I will end your pain
There will be hell to pay
Your flesh is mine your blood belongs to me

Your blood belongs to me

Did you cry

When will I shed
This halo of the damned
When will I breath in
One breath of confidence
Just one day of
Freedom from silence
Saving my mind from
Illusions of consciousness

Lost again
Rise
I'm lost again
Resurrection
Betrayed again
Rise
Slipping into
Desperation

Self inflicted, cut by the hand that feeds
Torn incisions, comfort in misery
These abrasions will start consuming me
Resurrection

This infection starts to cripple me
My will's broken torture and misery

I am the soul collector
I am the fear you fight
I am the one who stalks you, I live inside

Pain â here comes the resurrection
Pain â here comes the birth of night
Pain â here comes the reign of terror, I live inside

Pain â I am the dream destroyer
Pain â I am the parasite
Pain â I am the death inside you face of demise

There will be hell to pay
Let me through and I will end your pain
There will be hell to pay
Your flesh is mine your blood belongs to me

Blood belongs to me

Did you cry

When will I breath in
One breath of confidence
