No, you can't pretend that everything's alright,
When, all you know falls apart.
Blue Sun will rise and shine and burn its light,
You might lose this fight

She was a little girl,
All closed up in her world.
She dreamed of who she might be,
Never thought that it could all become reality.

He was a humble boy,
Enchanted with a toy.
He dreamed of touching the stars,
Never thought that dreams could ever make them go so far.

Running at the speed of light, out of reason out of time.
And then it crashed.

No, that you can't pretend that everything's alright,
When, all you know falls apart.
Blue Sun will rise and shine and burn its light,
You might lose this fight.

No, you can't pretend that everything's alright,
When life, you know, gets too bright.
Blue Sun will rise and shine and burn its light,
You might lose this fight.

Dreams really do come true,
But what will living in a dream, really do to you?
All people rise and fall,
But only few of them will need a trace to follow up.

Running at the speed of light,
Out of reason out of time.
And then it crashed.

No, you can't pretend that everything's alright,
When all you know falls apart.
Blue Sun will rise and shine and burn its light,
You might lose this fight.

No, you can't pretend that everything's alright,
When life, you know, gets too bright.
Blue Sun will rise and shine and burn its light,
You might lose this fight!
