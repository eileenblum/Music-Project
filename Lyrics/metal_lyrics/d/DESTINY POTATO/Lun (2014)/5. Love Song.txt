I can't define what a feeling
I'm lost for words
You don't see my heart bleeding
I can't stand it no more

You screamed, I laughed, and you break down
You say I'm mad
You know it's more than a game now
Maybe it's all in your head

Don't you know what I mean?
Is it possible?
Can we lose it all?
Cause you saw the worst in me
And I know
That I'll never let you go

I know, you know, yeah we both know
How this will end
Open you mouth, say you hate me
There's no need to pretend

Don't you know what I mean?
Is it possible?
Can we lose it all?
Cause you saw the worst in me
And I know
That I'll never let you go

Screw you, fuck you, mmmm, I hate you
This time for real
I simply want to forget you
This beaten heart needs time to heal

Don't you know what I mean?
Is it possible?
Can we lose it all?
Cause you saw the worst in me
And I know
That I'll never let you go
