Close your eyes now, and look around.
Describe all the places, that you have found.
Can you, can you, can you be around?
Do you, do you, really feel the sound?

Cut your skin and, reach inside.
Use your mind.
Don't be blind.
Can you, can you, can you be around?
Do you, do you, really feel the sound?
Can you, can you, can you be around?
Do you, do you, really feel the sound?

The pain is gone it's fading,
I cannot take this anymore.
My life is masquerading.
Walk away and shut the door.

There is no time for blaming.
All the things you have said and done,
The pain turns into hating,
And I cannot give anymore time.

Now is your time to realise,
A new day is coming.
Open your eyes.
Can you, can you, can you be around?
Do you, do you, really feel the sound?
Can you, can you, can you be around?
Do you, do you, really feel the?

The pain is gone it's fading,
I cannot take this anymore.
My life is masquerading.
Walk away and shut the door.

There is no time for blaming.
All the things you have said and done,
The pain turns into hating,
And I cannot give anymore time.

The pain is gone it's fading,
I cannot take this anymore.
My life is masquerading.
Walk away and shut the door.

There is no time for blaming.
All the things you have said and done,
The pain turns into hating,
And I cannot give anymore time.
