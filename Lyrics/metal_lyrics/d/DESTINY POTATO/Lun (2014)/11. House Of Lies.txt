There were days when I was down,
When I had no one around.
But the thought that you were there for me,
But you turned your back so easily.

There you were you spoke those words,
Of all the words I never heard.
And you try to break what's left of me.
I just wonder how I couldn't see.

I don't know who you are,
I don't know where to start,
When all our love you tore apart.
You don't know who I am,
And you don't understand,
That I will never let this end.

I used to think we had it all.
But you just loved to see me crawl.
And no matter how fast I would run,
You would always make me come undone.
Every time I seemed okay,
I would always feel shame.
I was trapped inside your house of lies,
And I try to leave but I'm paralyzed.

I don't know who you are,
I don't know where to start,
When all our love you tore apart.
You don't know who I am,
And you don't understand,
That I will never let this end.

All along,
So wrong,
I always thought you'd be here,
Never thought you'd disappear.
All along,
So wrong,
I tried and tried but I won't let you go!

I don't know who you are,
I don't know where to start,
When all our love you tore apart.
You don't know who I am,
And you don't understand,
That I will never let this end.
