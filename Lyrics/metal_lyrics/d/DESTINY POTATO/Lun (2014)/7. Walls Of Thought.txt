Just one moment in time is all that takes to
Make the hearts entwine for an entire lifetime.
Thereâs nothing that could ever break that,
Itâs too strong when two belong.
Just one touch of true spark was all it took to
Make a child smile without a clue.
That will made its truth, will make it hard to,
See the light that souls ignite.

These walls of thought,
They know how it feels.
Two different roads
All the same whilst flying, turning, falling, burning.
On their own way to,
Find what theyâve lost.

In desire chose to break them into,
Millions of pieces made by two.
Others burned out pages, hold the truth
This world between makes it hard to choose.

These walls of thought,
They know how it feels.
Two different roads,
All the same whilst flying, turning, falling, burning.
On their own way to,
Find what theyâve lost!

[Bridge section/solo]

These walls of thought,
They know how it feels.
Two different roads,
All the same whilst flying, turning, falling, burning.
On their own way to,
Find what theyâve lost!
