You used to tell me we'll never part.
But all you gave was a broken heart
Now I will bury your corpse outside
And I will tell you where my heart died

Give me eyes to see
People I once knew now they look so hollow
Give me flair to taste.
All of my pieces lost along the way
Give me hands to feel
All of my lost dreams in their world of shadow
Give me back my dreams

Now I have told you what was inside
The story of how my heart once died

Give me eyes to see
People I once knew now they look so hollow
Give me flair to taste.
All of my pieces lost along the way
Give me hands to feel
All of my lost dreams in their world of shadow
Give me back my dreams

[guitar solo]

Give me eyes to see
People I once knew now they look so hollow
Give me flair to taste.
All of my pieces lost along the way
Give me hands to feel
All of my lost dreams in their world of shadow
Give me back my dreams

Give me eyes to see (give me eyes to see)
Give me flair to taste (give me flair to taste).
Give me hands to feel (give me hands to feel)
Give me back my dreams (give me back my dreams)
