No, I do not dare to deny
Deny what I'm hearing
Counting always this as I cry

No, I do not dare to deny
Deny what I'm dreaming
And when I do I deserve to die

Someone saw what I
What I couldn't see
All the questions and dreams

Someone saved me when
When I couldn't breath
What I am inside feels so right

No, I do not dare to deny
Deny that I'm seeing
People's faces like once I sleep

No, I do not dare to deny
The voices around me
Screaming raging, how they wait for me

Someone saw what I
What I couldn't see
All the questions and dreams

Someone saved me when
When I couldn't breath
What I am inside feels so right

No, I do not dare to deny
Deny what I'm hearing

Counting always this as I cry
Voices around me
Screaming, raging, how they wait for me

Someone saw what I
What I couldn't see
All the questions and dreams

Someone saved me when
When I couldn't breath
What I am inside feels so right
