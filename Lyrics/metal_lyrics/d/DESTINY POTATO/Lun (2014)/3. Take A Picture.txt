Come take a picture
If only you knew, what I would do for you.
I want to feel you, and I can see right through.
What do I have to do, why can't this truth be told?
I want to get inside the dark side..

If only you knew, what I would do for you.
I want to feel you, and I can see right through.
What do I have to do, why can't this truth be told?
I want to get inside the dark side of you.

Come take a picture, as it could be the last,
Thing the remember, from your..
Come take a picture, no you can't run away,
I will hunt you down as if you were my prey.

Come take a picture, as it will be the last,
Thing the remember, from your past.
Come take a picture, as it will be the last,
Thing you see from a broken heart...

GRRAAAHHHHHHH

(Aaaahhhh)
If only I had you in my arms,
There is nothing that I wouldn't do.
If I could have you close to me.
Close to you.

Come take a picture

If only you knew, what I would do for you,
But loving someone for you is a taboo.
What do I have to do, why can't this kiss be true?
I swallow all the things you're pushing me through.

If I could have you close to me.
Close to you.
There is a story behind my smile,
I just don't know how far you could go.
When I let you come close to me,
Close to you.
