I know you at least I think I do,
You control my mind and my body too.

I thought I made myself damn clear,
But you would never disappear!
Inside this hidden room,
I'll try to fight with you!

I dropped you once,
And I'll drop you once again!
From myself, from my life,
But scar remains.

Feels like flirting with suicide.
All this pain is playing with my mind.
I thought I made myself damn clear,
But you would never disappear!
Inside this hidden room,
I'll try to fight with you!
Ah, oh, etc.

I dropped you once,
And I'll drop you once again!
From myself, from my life,
But scar remains.
One second becomes
Like a year when thoughts collide;
I wanna brake everything and stay alive!

[Scream]

[Guitar solo]

In this room, I'll fight with you!

(AH-AH-AH-AH!)

[Growling vocals:]
Pounding waves of liquid overload running through my nerves and my brain!
The carcass of dream lies dead.
I'm hopping to find 1 hole under these 4 walls to catch my breath!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! [Scream]

Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! [Scream]

I dropped you once,
And I'll drop you once again!
From myself, from my life,
But scar remains.
One second becomes
Like a year when thoughts collide;
I wanna brake everything and stay alive.
