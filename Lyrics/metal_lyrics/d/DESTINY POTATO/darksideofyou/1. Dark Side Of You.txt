Come take a picture.
'Cause it will be your last.
Memories will haunt you.
You can't erase the past.
If only you knew,
What I would do, for you.
I want to feel you.
And I can see right through.

What do I have to do, why can't this truth be, told.
I want to get inside the dark side of you. (dark side of you)
What do I have to do, why can't this kiss be, true.
I swallow all the things you're pushing me through. (pushing me through!)

I want you on my... Skin
Like one bloody, tattoo
But loving someone
For you is a taboo

What do I have to do, why can't this truth be, told
I want to get inside the dark side of you (dark side of you)
What do I have to do, why can't this kiss be, true
I swallow all the things you're pushing me through (pushing me through!)

What do I have to do, why can't this truth be, told
I want to get inside the dark side of you (dark side of you)
What do I have to do, why can't this kiss be, true
I swallow all the things you're pushing me through.

What do I have to do, why can't this truth be, told
I want to get inside the dark side of you (dark side of you)
What do I have to do, why can't this kiss be, true
I swallow all the things you're pushing me through
