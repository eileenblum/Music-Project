Fire and flames and funeral games undertaking the undertaker
Killing of kings in chaotic kingdom stand in my way and you will have war to pay
Frightened to sleep or look out your window
Crying in fright afraid of the night
Witches and wizards burn at the stake
Kings in castles fry up in flames
To slay is to carve, to carve is to halve
Cut of a head and another one dead
Vicious attack a knife in the back, a heart for an eye a soul for a tooth
Devils dirty work is in my hands, you'll be much safer in your coffin
Oh blood thirsty I'm blood vicious
