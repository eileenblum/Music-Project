We are just skeletons with a coat of flesh.
We drip blood when our souls are congealed
We pray for darkness and the horror we feel
Give me your hand and I'll rip out your soul
I am the evil one, you are with god
Scared of the devil
Hell is like Heaven
I am the evil one, show me your god
The devil was just an Angel who was kicked out of Heaven
Give me your prayer and I'll show you my wisdom
Wisdom for me is horror for you
May the blood of the rat be the blood of your soul
Dripping away into horrid infinity
