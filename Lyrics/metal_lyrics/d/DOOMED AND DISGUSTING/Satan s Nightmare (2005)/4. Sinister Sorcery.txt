Sinister sorcery wicked oblivion, sinister science eyes of amphibian
A call from the grave a spirit to save afterlife voodoo spell of the zulu
Voodoo witch will send you to hell gothic castle and torturous cave
Abra cadabra spell of the dead gothic witch will cut out your head
Eat my body suck my blood take this bread and be mislead
Enter the chambers enter her kingdom enter her castle of torturous oblivion
Don't melt the wax of the vicious dolls remove the hairs and put them in fire
Don't suck the blood of Dracula or play
Where zombies lay far away in a manger
