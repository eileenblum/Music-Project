Remember the old days of singing in the graveyard
Over the hills and far away
Singing with the dead, dancing for the zombies
Oh what joy we had those days
A bonfires lit and a crucifix is burning
Chanting is channelled thunders on its way
Bats are squealing rain comes pouring
Head for the vaults till the very next day
I inherited my first ouija board
When I was age of 7 we took it to the graveyard
And sat it on a stone
We summoned up the spirits who scared away the demons
The ouija board was burnt on a certain later day
A witch once told me to never play with life
A wizard once said to stay away from flames
And the Voodoo doctor told me don't put the dead in torment
I used to be afraid of ghosts

BUT NOW I'M ONE MYSELF!!!
