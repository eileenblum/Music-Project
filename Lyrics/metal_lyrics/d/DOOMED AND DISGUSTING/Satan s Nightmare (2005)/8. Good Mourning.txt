Midnight dead of night, fearsomes no longer there
Evil paranoia creeps upon you, bow down and say your prayers
Afraid of the dead, you are only misled, by demons who come to torment you
Frightened to sleep, astral travel will creep journey beyond reality

Masturbating over the thought of some bitch who possess a witch
Lust will always disturb you, the semen you spill is the being you've killed
Has this child my fate, has this child any spirit?
