I hate love and I love hate
My mind controls over human fate
Steeing destiny into my command
Candles are burning at the altars we stand
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
If Gods won't have you my temples must.
Welcome to my Torture Chamber
Life drags on in my torture chamber
Slowly dying in my torture Chamber
Nails shall squeak as I exit my coffin
Hinges will crack as I exit my vault
The old gates will smash as I leave the graveyard,
Candles are lit as I enter my chamber
Hear more evil, see more evil
Speak more evil, feel more EVIL
Welcome to my torture
Life drags on and on in my torture chamber
Slowly drifting away in my torture chamber
Spikes are sharpened on the Iron Maiden
Chains are tightened
On the dirty old rack
Voltage is added to the electric coffin
Let me out, let me out of here.
