In the name of the father and of the sun and the holy ghost
Scripts of blaspheme it's only a dream that you're a holy mortal
You think you're blessed but only possessed praise praising death
Our fathers who aren't in heaven hallow be thy name
Hail the beast disguised the priest deceiving all the nations
Subtle he chooses in the abyss he looses paying for his blasphemy
In the name of the evil and of the mental and of the unholy ghosts
