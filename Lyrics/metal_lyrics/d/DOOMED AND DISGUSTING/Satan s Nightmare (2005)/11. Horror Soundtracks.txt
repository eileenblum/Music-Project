We want your soul...
We want your soul...
We want your soul...

I was born in fire
And baptized in fire
[I of need hope to gather]
Summon the dead
And we want your soul
Keep away from my mind

I am the world domination

We summoned the dead
We summoned the dead
We are in your mind
We want your soul
We want your soul

Sinister sorcery wicked oblivion
Sinister science eyes of amphibian
A call from the grave a spirit to save
Afterlife voodoo spell of the zulu

This is the end
This is the end
This is the end
There is no escape
