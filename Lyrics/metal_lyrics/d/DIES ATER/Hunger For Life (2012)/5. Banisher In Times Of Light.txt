"Banisher in times of light,
haunted demon freezing blood
a howling in the dark - frightful

something's waiting in this wood
obsessing mortal life
screaming in the night sky"

Midnight creeps across the ground
devour all life slowly, a fire heretical
approaching like dreaded predator silently

and the wind becomes so cold... diabolical

"Watch out! Far in front a gleam
did you hear? ... somewhere a scream"

Prosecutor to human retake what once was lost.

A fate on a dark string, she sinned against divinity
But hell knows to welcome a queen

with raven chanting fanatic, she's drowning in blood
full moon reflects in yellow wolves' eyes - howling

"Watch out! Far in front a gleam
did you hear? ... somewhere a scream"

Prosecutor to human retake what once was lost.

The Sun dismissed by whirlwinds enraged

Arise father of lies

The church bells decline sounding

Arise father of lies 

fire-covered skies

a horned beast inflamed 

"Piercing me with a glance of the marauder
can't deny - starving to be your conspirator
and as seconds passing by, all my worries disappear
Hell to jubilate, seems our storm is getting near "

"Watch out! Far in front a gleam
did you hear? ... somewhere a scream"

Prosecutor to human retake what once was lost.
