Midnight has past long ago...
Twitching shadows on the wall - full moons visions
Tired my body and eyes, but no sleep for me
cause time is running out...

Midnight has past long ago, and I feel so cold
Twitching shadows on the wall - full moons visions
Sitting in my prison, isolation as gentle guest
waiting for sentence to come, to do my final breath

Burn a fire -
fertile on the funeral pile
Die in a holy blaze -
of bone and flesh - a dreadful clash

Teaching kings and tyrants in rules extreme through the nights
one hand reached for glory, the other played with fate
a defender by steel now at the point of solitude
knowledge supreme 

Burn a fire 
fertile on the funeral pile
Die in a holy blaze 
of bone and flesh - a dreadful clash

But treason spied my ways,
lurking in ambushes
life became a tormented woken dream
I am the curse of the dominants
The one who's planting fingers in open wounds
The knowing one...

This chapter is nearing perfection, thirsting for the end
shades grabbing for me, straining down to the bone
Now ceasing the game - I leave alone

As the Chapel bells starts a frenetic sounding,
swathed in uncertainty, the heart increases pounding
With doors open two deathsmen appeared
Down, down dark steps - I couldn't foresee

Midnight has past long ago, and I feel so cold
Twitching shadows on the wall - full moons visions
Sitting in my prison, isolation as gentle guest
waiting for sentence to come, to do my final breath

Burn a fire -
fertile on the funeral pile
Die in a holy blaze -
of bone and flesh - a dreadful clash
