Branded with a cross on my back inflamed,
a frantic look, sneaking through the night
hiding in the dark

never to be caught by star's glow
dreadful shine, why are they so sad tonight?

I came in a midnight clear, with sins in bag.
A fiery trance, a burning touch, bloodknife

I walk the path, it's the path I choose
Finisher at the last part, my friend

A death by a cold winterbreath
this night, it's all about to end

Aching stitches profound, a fading rose
why shouldn't I take her life?

I walk the path, it's the path I choose
Finisher at the last part, my friend

A death by a cold winterbreath
this night, it's all about to end

Frightful claws in me placed by anger
Murderer superb, an assassin glorious
to common eyes just a subtle stranger
a demolisher in the fog notorious

An art brought to mankind
before the dawn of time...

I walk the path, it's the path I choose
Finisher at the last part, my friend

A death by a cold winterbreath
this night, it's all about to end
