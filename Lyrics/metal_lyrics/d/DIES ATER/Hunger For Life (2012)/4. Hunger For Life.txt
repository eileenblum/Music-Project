Laying in bed her head in a daze
Blood on the wall, madness in her face

not able to die, even the mind mutated
this deceiving scene turns into crimson red

Never to be alone all cold in the dark

Possessed by a count of evil
a master of killing, herald of a new world
planting an anchor in her soul
mind's raging, long lost control

HUNGER FOR LIFE

The hunger for life as sense for being
Gripping last breath right from the lips

a vanguard to lead in eclipse
... to be forgotten until the end ...

Sacrificing eyesight, just to see the world's end

"Just his light makes me shine ..."

Possessed by a count of evil
a master of killing, herald of a new world
planting an anchor in her soul
mind's raging, long lost control

HUNGER FOR LIFE
