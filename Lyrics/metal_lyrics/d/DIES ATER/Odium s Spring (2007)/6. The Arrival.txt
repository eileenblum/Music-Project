On immortal steeds they ride,
Rampant with the wilderness of pride,
To where they can fulfill their task,
Temper rushing to choose (its) site

Feel the charming fearing breeze
Silently creeping through the woods
A messenger of tender dusk to come.

Hear the hunger for a death to last
Sounding desperately from the molten steal
Damned union rises in brutality
A merciless assault on mortality

Phantoms to welcome the wicked son
-I Pray-
"So come, sweet salvation - please, come"

"The Horizon turns black
And men shall die
For ours the deadly night
Visions descend from hidden sky"

Stranger in mind, brought to this world
Rape of sun - to tear and exhaust

On immortal steeds they ride,
Rampant with the wilderness of pride,
To where they can fulfill their task,
Temper rushing to choose its site

Countless blameless creatures murdered this infested day,
While the cursing spawn of evil carries on

"The Horizon turns black
And men shall die
For ours the deadly night
Visions descend from hidden sky"

A vagrant breed of a scorned god,
Borne by winds, destined to dominate
Stranger in mind

Shadowed souls igniting mantras

To see behind the void
Take a trip of this lasting shine
A cold return welcomes
Nine lustrous rituals to touch divine
