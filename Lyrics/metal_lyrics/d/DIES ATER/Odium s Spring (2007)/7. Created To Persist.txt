I can stand the chilling pain for a while
I can face doubtful storms of time
Just to see mortality
An enthroned, but outshining star

I can fly from fearsome reality
By slipping in unseen and furtive gaps
To hide my thousand faces
Formed to devastate
-created to persist-
A virtuous creature sent in rage to haunt a dissolving coast
I can endure the vicious everlasting poison
Gifted by deadly snakes - scorpion's breed

A scornful grimace burns right in the cut
To harvest an inhuman, disheartened seed
Experience the dripping sense of unveiled danger
An unseen sign of punishment across the breast

An amazing wish to pass away instantly
My limbs filled with draining substance
Dementia - licking wounds

I can fly from fearsome reality
By slipping in unseen and furtive gaps
To hide my thousand faces
Formed to devastate
-created to persist-
