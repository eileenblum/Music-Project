What if compassion retreats
Watching respect fallen behind
A malicious smile on lips
Cruel sun blinding the eye

"Legions, carve for my arrival
For instant success I'll bring
Would you resist odium's spring?

I'll be like the moonrise
Dim hunter on the chase for prey
While daylight misses the day."

Mist hidden wishes hold court
Secrets lying revealed, would you impose fault on me?
Servants of light - follow me

"Legions, carve for my arrival
For instant success I'll bring
Would you resist odium's spring?

I'll be like the moonrise
Dim hunter on the chase for prey
While daylight misses the day."

Praising evil
evoking sin anew
A vision of mourning
becomes true

Hush - Servants of light
For night sneaks around the place
A cold return welcomes
Filthy rituals to touch grace
Put hearts in this nasty land
Squeeze the soul out of form.

And a grim gloom sought victory
By darkened stars in the skies
Main concern is dawn to conceal
While midnight signed to deal

Virtue lost and been drown in sand
As sin sets free in a dreary swarm

"Legions, carve for my arrival
For instant success I'll bring
Would you resist odium's spring?

I'll be like the moonrise
Dim hunter on the chase for prey
While daylight misses the day."
