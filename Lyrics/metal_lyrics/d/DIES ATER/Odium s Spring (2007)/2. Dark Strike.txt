Where winds transform into crushing storms
And whispers grow to endless screams
Candles guide a fulminate fire to start
There you'll find us in the heart

A raging faction bridging waters godlike
Vicious kings with sword in hand
Hidden by skies dressed in flames
Hordes of morality - this is the end

Take command finally

"And we will fear not the ache,
Tonight we're storming their walls
Howling words of thunder
We are anger - we are slander"

"Dreadful orphans of distress
We'll free them all
Proper time to unveil
We are fire - you're our scale"

Awful kings shall reign supreme
With visions clear for revelations to come
Out of dusk we'll appear as in a dream

A dark heaven for a dark strike
Forced by acts divine
Heads up straight in the sky
Tomorrow's first light will be our sign

Where winds transform into crushing storms
And whispers grow to endless screams
Candles guide a fulminate fire to start
There you'll find us in the heart

"And we will fear not the ache,
Tonight we're storming their walls
Howling words of thunder
We are anger - we are slander"

"Dreadful orphans of distress
We'll free them all
Proper time to unveil
We are fire - you're our scale"

For we'll reveal hell on earth
As you will see
Unholy force out of the past
Leave behind a mischief to last

We'll appear as in a dream
