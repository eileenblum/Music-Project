Drowning in darkness, lost in oceans of misery
Sweet voices in my ears,
blinded by tears.

Mine is the throne, the throne of mourning.
Searching for you behind the veil,
condemned to fail.

Shattered and torn my emotions,
bleeding for my fault.
I`ve tried the crown of seduction,
but nothing else than pain I called.

Time to spread my wings,

FLY

The stars so bright,
the moon so full of might.
A winter breeze touches my skin,
Coldness deep, deep within.

Shattered and torn my emotions,
bleeding for my fault.
I`ve tried the crown,
the crown of seduction.

Ewig wandernd den Pfad,
den Pfad der Traurigkeit.
Suchend nach dem Kelch,
zu trinken des Gottes Leid

zu trinken des Gottes Leid,

kniend vor der Dunkelheit.
