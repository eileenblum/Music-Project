Faded in oblivion, as darkness slept,
embraced by dusk, a veil of conspiracy.
scratching at twilight's shores,
while grace decayed, freezed by sobriety.

Through misty long lost times,
it surveyed an endless, growing wideness
garnished with perfidious welling glory,
cruelty ruled, a triumph of senselessness.

"Seize hell's darkwinds and let them crash on these planes,
shake the dusty ground, devour all their bitter lifes.
Damn virginity and paint sin in its colour.
So might will fall and my star shall rise!!"

A filthy laughter drowned the storm,
as the black wizard, robed in evil passion,
summoned the beast, awaking fate's temper.
mortal souls cried, mantled by spiritual fire.

Just one spell to devour the day, a ban to bring darkness.

So winding in damnation,
ignorance slept a restless sleep.
Dreaming of vengeance,
thirsting for traitor's blood.

Cause Revenge will chain the pity soon
and the lost kingdom will be reborn.
