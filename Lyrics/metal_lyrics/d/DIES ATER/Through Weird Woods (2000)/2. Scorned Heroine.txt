Hidden in vaporous shadows the castle arises,
Guarded by winds a glance of beauty,
But malice lurking behind,
Where the countess gracefully lies.

Blessed by a velvet skin with ebony hair,
Cheeks like fresh snow, so white.
Gliding through the forest by innocence lead,
Being observed by a glimpsing satanic sight.

While tragedy rages through the lonely nights,
To find the pitiable sacrifice,
cause just slow death can her satisfy.

In fear the virgin whimpers, as the ravenous voice is
Tempted by lust of their sadistical choice.
Bleeding for beauty.

As desires brutality, disturbing infinity's sleep.
It find faith tortured, retention perfidious raped.

A funeral of promises, long lost its meaning.
A tomb of buried hopes, diseased by madness.

"You shall not fear the pain, nor the beast its knife.
Just fulfil my desire for an endless celestial life!"

Gripped by obsession's flame to rouse those pale demons,
Centuries of wait have all but gone, and the sin was done.

Spirits gather, preparing tomorrow's flight,
murdered for vanity, eyes stare in ecstasy,
as life flickers away.

Hidden in vaporous shadows the castle arises,
Guarded by winds a glance of beauty,
But malice lurking behind,
Where the countess gracefully lies.

While tragedy rages through the lonely nights,
To find the pitiable sacrifice,
Spirits gather, preparing tomorrow's flight,
Cause just slow death can her satisfy.
