"Divine leader of these thundering dark legions,
Blessed by the shadows' power, honoured by the twilight of proud.
We hail you."

In the valley of depraved thoughts, where retention disappears
Scaring, slightly shadowed lights untomb lost hearts
While an infernal gift of wisdom stoking a redeeming fire
Strafing life, as infinity winds in corroding, leeching fields.

- Dethrone the weak mortality -

I'd wandered around million places,
Seen hundreds of defiled souls, preserving humbling secrets
Blinded by hate, driven by unknown inner instinct
Still I was on a search to obtain higher values.

On a gloomy autumn night, spotted by a fatal glimpse
My consternated body, willing to run, not able to move.

A piercing scream, brightens the surrounding darkness,
An unsacred creature, haunting this bleeding place.

Hallowed senses growing wild,
open shadows mortal's shore.
To carve wounds deep in skin
A fatal scream for war.

With eyes up high, close to the infinite end
Reaching out for the tyrant's crown
To dominate this desired land by steel
An unstained dream to conquer yet reaching higher
To catch the luminous, oppressing moon,
the depraving fire.
