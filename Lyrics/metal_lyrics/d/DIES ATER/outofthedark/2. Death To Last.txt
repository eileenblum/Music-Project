On a quest to break out despair
I stare through the void at my
fated throne
Encounter dismal funereal skies

... a path to go

When stars are falling like guardians from grace
Masses of capturing thoughts
expose a distorted way

Trying to scream,
while the night sings my song.
Covered by fire,
That paralyzes my tongue.

Welcome to my world,
Burning skies for me
Mother thunder - feel my blood
... fallen enemy.

Welcome to my world,
Drowning in the past
Mother wonder - taste my blood
Thirsting for death to last.

On a quest to break out despair

...start to expose

Lost in a severe riddled mind.
Spared just for my dripping soul,
To rest in silence - lifeblind!

Welcome to my world,
Burning skies for me
Mother wonder - taste my blood
Thirsting for death to last.

Caught in worlds,
Torn by feeble hands.
I roam through
wicked lands.

With lunacy
Being by my side,
fear disappears
and rapture opens wide

Distant menacing methods
to slip in portraits dark
- Hide, Hide !! -
Still a gift to burn.

Welcome to my world,
Burning skies for me
Mother thunder - feel my blood
... fallen enemy.

And dawn will reveal,
A hidden shaded retribution
in a blaze of malice
a different sun to come.
