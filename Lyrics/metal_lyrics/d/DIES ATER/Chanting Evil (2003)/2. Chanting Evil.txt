Where sun refuses to shine, a shadowed might grows unknown,
Open wounds lie complaining, a fading Eden for lost souls
Roaming through blazing grounds, drained by freezing winds,
The will to rise again caressing sin-swallowed senses.

Glancing in virginity, led by stars of purity
while sadness can do no harm, such a veracious heart.
Stream of fire, attempts to lighten this dark abandoned place.
A junction for sadness and death to unite - creeping forward.

A retribution of drowning, charming evildrunken voices
Sounds from the depth of the woods carried by a whispering breeze

Hear the beasts chanting a solitude spell:

"A dreadful abyss for a lightened beauty to fall,
Barely a touch of madness, bathing in a grey sunrise,
Wish to see winged saints stumble through fields of evil,
Come follow me in the night, for heaven is blind 'round here."

See the face shine in the moonlight, soft as silk, pure as water.
But a dark affection, growing hidden in lonesome moments.
When just a breath disturbing the impermeable silence
"Drink deep from the fountain of seduction and treason,
corroding your absurd mind, let apathy take command.

Now feel the filthy power rising on far mental horizons.
Dragging you into infinite worlds, catching stars and moons."

"Live is here for me - distress is here for me"

Constantly, aging romance to creep on bent knees - feeble creature
Under the disturbing blindfold control of shaping fears
A raging new sun is born for darkness and cold,
so far - and dimness breathes for a storm, leaching this star.
