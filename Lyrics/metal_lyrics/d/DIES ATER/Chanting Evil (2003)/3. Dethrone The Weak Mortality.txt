"Divine leader of these thundering dark legions,
Blessed by the shadows' power, honoured by the twilight of proud.
We hail you."

In the valley of depraved thoughts, where retention disappears - disappears
Scaring, slightly shadowed lights untomb lost hearts - lost hearts
While an infernal gift of wisdom stoking a redeeming fire - such a cold fire
Strafing life, as infinity winds in corroding, leeching fields.

- Dethrone the weak mortality -

I'd wandered around millions of these soothing places,
Seen hundreds of defiled souls, preserving humbling secrets
Blinded by hate, driven by unknown inner instinct

On a gloomy autumn night, spotted by a fatal glimpse
My consternated body, willing to run, not able to move
A piercing scream, brightens the surrounding darkness,
An unsacred creature, haunting this bleeding place.

- Dethrone the weak mortality -

"A treasure to feed my hunger, to grant me peace?"

Hark! A nearing, provoking challenge for me to come,
Time to forget former battles of irrelevant insignificance.
A deserved catastrophe for all these grudging cowards
To dethrone this weak mortality - flame of darkness.

A forbidden, seductive strength, enchanting my senses
Mocking weakness in serenades of despise - free to rise

Valuable sins waiting for my unholy, deadly commands
Shadows flee in cold despair, a world is bleeding

An unstained dream to conquer yet reaching higher
To catch the luminous, oppressing moon, the depraving fire
