[Featuring Maynard James Keenan - Tool / A Perfect Circle]

[Chino:] Here I lay
[Maynard:] Still and breathless
[Chino:] Just like always
[Maynard:] Still I want some more
[Chino:] Mirrors sideways
[Maynard:] Who cares what's behind
[Chino:] Just like always
[Maynard:] Still your passenger

[Maynard:] Chrome buttons, buckles and leather surfaces
These and other lucky witnesses

[Chino:] Now to calm me
[Maynard:] this time won't you please

[Chino:] Drive faster!

[Maynard:] Roll the window down this cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in, who cares who sees anything
I'm your passenger, I'm your passenger

[Chino:] Drop these down then put them on me
Nice cool seats there to cushion your knees
Now to calm me
[Maynard:] Take me around again
[Chino:] Don't pull over
[Maynard:] This time won't you please
[Chino:] Drive faster!

[Maynard:] Roll the window down this cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in, who cares who sees, what tonight
Roll these misty windows down to catch my breath and then
Go and go and don't just drive me home and back again

[Chino:] Here I lay just like always,
[Maynard:] Don't let me go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Take me to the edge
