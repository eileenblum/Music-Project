When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
You like attention
It proves to you you're alive
Stop, parading your angles
Confused? You'll know when you're RIPE

When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control

You're pregnant
With all this space
Thick with Honey
But I've lost my taste

You're into depression
Cause it matches your eyes
Stop, the faux to be famous
Confused? you know when you're RIPE
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control

You're pregnant
With all this space

Thick with Honey
But I've lost my taste.

When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control

You're pregnant
With all this space
Thick with Honey
But I've lost my taste.
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
When you're ripe
You'll bleed out of control
You'll bleed out of control
