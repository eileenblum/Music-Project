I won't stop following you
Now help me pray for
The death of everything new
Then we'll fly farther

'Cause you're my girl and that's all right
If you sting me, I wont mind

We'll stop to rest on the moon
And we'll make fire
I'll steal a carcass for you
Then feed off the virus

'Cause you're my girl and that's all right
If you sting me, I wont mind
'Cause you're my girl and that's all right
If you sting me I wont...

Now now look at em, look at em now, look at em, sting.
Now now look at em, look at em now, look at em, sting.
Now now look at em, look at em now, look at em, sting.
Now now look at em, look at em now, look at em, sting.

I see a red light in June
And I hear crying
You turn newborn baby blue
Now we're all the virus

'Cause you're my girl and that's all right
If you sting me, I wont mind
'Cause you're my girl and that's all right
If you sting me I wont...

Now now look at em, look at him em, look at em, sting
Now now look at em, look at em now, look at em, sting.
Now now look at em, look at em now, look at em, sting.
Now now look at em, look at em now, look at em, sting.
Sting, sting
Now now look at em, look at em now, look at em
Sting......
