No!
It's not that I care
Truly
But you're that girl
With sharp teeth
Who grabs at the walls
And pulls meat down
Well, here's my new address
6-6-4 oh I forget
No
It's not like I care
Truly
But you're that girl
With gold teeth
Who snaps at the walls
And won't calm down
Well here's my new address
6-1-5 oh I forget

There's all your evidence
Now take it home
And run with it
Now,  write it down
Now did you get, get it?
So write it down
Now did you get, get it?
So write it down
Now did you get, get it?
So write it down
Now did you get, get it?
So write it down

Well here's my new address
6-6-5 oh I confess
There's all your evidence
Now take it home
And fuck with it
Now, so write it down
Now did you get it, get it?
So write it down
Now did you get, get it?
So write it down
Now did you get, get it?
So write it down
Now did you get, get it?
So write it down
Now did you get, get it?
So write it down
Now did you get, get it?
So write it down
Now did you get, get it?
So write it down
