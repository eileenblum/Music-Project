I climbed your arms and you pulled away
A new cavity moved into my heart today
The more i scream, the more it seems
That now I'm through
Now I'm through
With the new you

I drove you home, then you moved away
New cavity moved into my heart today
The more she sings, the more it seems that
now I'm through
now I'm through
with the new you
new you
