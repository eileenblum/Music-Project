Fuck, I'm drunk
But I'm on my knees
The police stopped chasing I'm her
New, cool meat
She pops the
Trunk, and she removes me
The machine takes pictures of us
And my jaw and my teeth hurt
I'm choking from gnawing on the ball
And just before I come to,
Move to the back of the car
She made me touch the machine
Fuck 'em
First untie me
Untie me for now
You said you would right? And you were right
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
Soon this'll be all over, well I hope soon
She'd say, soon this'll be all over, well I hope soon
So she sang
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
So she sang
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go)
(Soon I'll let you go, soon I'll let you go).....
