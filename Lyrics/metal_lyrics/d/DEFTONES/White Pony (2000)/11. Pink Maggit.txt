I'll stick you
Enough to take your oxygen away
Then I'll set you on fire
Cause I'm on fire
And I'm with you alone
And I'm so into this whore
Be afraid
I might lose her
So forget about me
because I'll stick you
Push back the square
Now that you kneed her
in the throat
Well there you go
Cause back in school
We are the leaders of all
Transpose, or stop your life
Is what you do
Push back the square
Now that you need her
But you don't
So there you go
Cause back in school
We are the leaders of all
So transpose, or stop your life
Is what you do
Transpose, or stop your life
Push back the square
Now that you kneed her
in the throat, now there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders of it all
We are
You are
All you are, all you are, all you are, all you are is meat.
Now pass the flask.
