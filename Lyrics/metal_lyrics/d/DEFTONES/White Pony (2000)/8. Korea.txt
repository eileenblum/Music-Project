I taste you much better
Off teeth taste
Of white skin on red leather
Check the claws we got

Night time, cavity, come in
Downtown, Pony, Work your pitch

I came to in feathers
Like leaves taste
You rub me together
With claws like we got

Night time,  cavity, come in
Downtown, Pony, Work your pitch
Daytime,  Dancer, I'll come inside up inside
Got my, Teacher, now and carve your niche

Check the claws

It's yours...
It's yours
Your turn to come inside
Night time,  cavity, come in
Downtown, Pony, Work your pitch
Daytime,  Dancer, I'll come inside up inside
Got my, Teacher, carve your niche
