Paint the streets in white
Death is the standard breech for a complex prize
I think its's sweet of you and your parents are proud
But I would expect it from anyone now to protect lifes indigenous sound...

Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play. Worship, play (Worship-Worship)
Play and worship, play, play
Play and worship, play, play
Play and worship, play, play
Play and worship, play (Worship-Worship)

How the streets they swell
While the animals make their way through the crowds
If you keep listening you can hear it for miles
And trust everyone quicker with every faint smile...

Worship, play, play
Worship, play. Worship, play.
Play and worship, play play
Play and worship, play play (Worship-Worship)
Play and worship, play play (Worship-Worship)
Play and worship, play play (Worship-Worship)
Play and worship, play play
Play and worship, play play
Play and worship, play play
Play and worship, play (Worship-Worship)

And the crowd goes wild
And the camera makes you seasick
God its so sweet of you and I know you're proud
And the car bomb hits quick click, click, click, faint smile...
It's the same sound...it's the same, same...sound...

And the crowd goes wild
And the camera makes you seasick
God its so sweet of you and you know I'm proud
And the car bomb tick ticks with the same sound
It's the same sound
With the same sound... Hexagram
