How neat
I'm impressed... how did you come to be so blessed?
You're a star
You blaze... out like a sharp machine...
Like a whale's moan... well I'm here if that's what you want

Here we are- You're pins- I'm needles- Lets play...
Here we are- You want this?-Then come on...

Tune out everyone in the crowd it's just me and you
Come fall in love with the sound
Make a pact to each other when no one's around
Put the cross between me and you
Who wants to fuck with us now?
