They'll some soon
I keep waiting... and I wait... won't somebody... come save me....

And if you're feeling lucky, come and take me home
And if you feel loved (If you feel lucky/If you feel loved)

You've crossed the walls
Excelled
Further along through their hell
All for my heart
I watch you kill
You always have
You always will
Now spread your wings and sail out to me...

So if you're feeling lucky, come and take me home
Come and take me home
Yeah if you feel love... (If you feel lucky/If you feel loved)

Crossed the walls
Excelled
Further along through their hell
For my heart
I watch you kill
You always have
You always will
You always have and always will
You always have
You always will
Spread your wings and sail out to me... (If you feel lucky/If you feel loved)
