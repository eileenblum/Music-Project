No more golden lights for the queen earth to keep you warm in your kingdoms
High on the waves you make for us
But not since you left the waves come
The bar is dead and the rocket's rain is keeping you wet in your deathbed
So high on the waves you made for us
And not since you left have the waves come... Have the waves come...
