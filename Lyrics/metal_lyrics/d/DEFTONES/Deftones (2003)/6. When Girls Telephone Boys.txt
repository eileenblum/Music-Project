Always the same old taste just new injury
Well I'll wear the claws if you'd like that
Yeah if you'd like that we can ride on a death horse
A great new wave Hesperian death horse
I can call you when I get back
Yeah when I get back I will call

But don't speak don't say nothing
In case we ever do meet again
Somethings's wrong with you
Well I hope we never do meet again

You always sharpen your teeth because you're like that
And you're like that everyone you pull heart back
And her compact's carving deeper in your lap
I would call but I forget where the phone is at
Guess I'll talk to you when I get back
Yeah when I get back I will talk

But don't speak don't say nothing
In case we should ever meet again
There are some things wrong with you
I hope we never do meet again
I hope we never do meet again
I hope we never do meet again

Something's wrong with you... and I hope we never do meet again
