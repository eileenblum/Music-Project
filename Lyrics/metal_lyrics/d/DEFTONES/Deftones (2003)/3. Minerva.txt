I get all numb when she sings it's over
Such a strange numb and it brings my knees to the earth

And God bless you all for the song you saved us...

You're the same numb when you sing it's over
Such a strange numb it could bring back peace to the earth

So God bless you all for the song you saved us...
For the hearts you break everytime you moan...

I get all numb...

We're the same numb and it brings our knees to the earth

So God bless you all for the song you saved us...
For the hearts you break everytime you moan...

And God bless you all on the earth
