Soon as you came in all the beasts went away
They noticed that you're warm wait till you leave then come back for more...
The ropes hang to keep us all awake and I should have known

As soon as you came in the agony it went away
I noticed what you wore to everything we spoke and more...
The ropes hang to keep us all awake and I should have known

It only takes one break of a pose to get oil
As soon as you came in is when I believed we both crashed course
The ropes hang to keep us all awake and I should have known
It only takes one break of a pose to get oil

And to save our place home with you all
That's all it takes

Well I should have known it's still the same song
