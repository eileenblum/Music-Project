You arrive in my dream
Beside me every night
You and me,
We explode through the sea
We try to drain the night empty

No one goes off in every way
Like you do

We got together
We weave our web
Tangled in the waves with you
We spray the scene in red

We both erupt in colors
And carve our names
You keep me aroused
I know you feel the same

You arrive in my dream
Beside me every night
Just you and me,
We explode through the sea
We try to drain the night empty

No one else has a hold over me
Like you do

You open up the covers
You lure me in
Tackle me anxious back into bed
Where I hope to discover all of your ways
This place is death
I know you feel the same

You arrive in my dream
Beside me every night
Just you and me
We explode through the sea
We try to drain the night empty
