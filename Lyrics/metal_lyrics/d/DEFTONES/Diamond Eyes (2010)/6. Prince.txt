I relate to your kind your design
(your devotion to wave)
(get get get get get)
Get your brain on the Prize
Then die INSIDE

[Chorus 1:]
The mindset of a killer
With your mind (out faith)

It's a game that we like, we crave
(yet nobody waves...)
Anyway you decide you try
Then you DIE...

[Chorus 2:]
The mindset of a killer
With your gaze you paint the room
Blood red with your tears
Born from the stains

Hey you can't stop now,row by row,I'm all doubt
Caught by the back day go,No one cares No one knows
Look into the world outside, it's okay I'm alright
Now open the empty land, in comes the bird, in comes the end.

Click the raise the device (get face)
Then clear out the room
Blow kisses wave them goodbye...GOODNIGHT...
Goodnight...[inaudible screaming]...GOODNIGHT

[Chorus 2:]
The mindset of a killer
With your gaze you paint the room
Blood red with your tears
Born from the stains

Hey you can't stop now,row by row,I'm all doubt
Caught by the back day go,No one cares No one knows
Look into the world outside, it's okay I'm alright
Now open the empty land, in comes the bird, in comes the end.
