I like you when,
when you take off your face
put away all your teeth
and take this weight underneath
cause you could die if you take it alone

I watch you taste it
I see your face
and I know I'm alive
your shooting stars
from the barrel of your eyes
it drive me crazy
just drives me wild

I kinda of like you when
when you make up the rules
take the phone in your room
stop the tape always soon
you could die if you take it alone

I watch you taste it
I see your face
and I know I'm alive
your shooting stars
from the barrel of your eyes
it drive me crazy
it drives me wild

everytime
everytime you try
ride
it's a beautiful ride
why
its a beautiful ride

I watch you taste it
I see your face
and I know I'm alive
your shooting stars
from the barrel of your eyes
it drive me crazy
it drives me wild
