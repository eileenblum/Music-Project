[bonus track]

When the room is quiet
The daylight almost gone
It seems there's something I should know

Well, I ought to leave
But the rain it never stops
And I've no particular place to go

Just when I think I'm winning
When I've broken every door
The ghosts of my life
Blow wilder than before

Just when I thought I could not be stopped
When my chance came to be king
The ghosts of my life
Blow wilder than the wind

Well, I'm feeling nervous
And now I find myself alone
The simple life's no longer there

Once I was so sure
Now the doubt inside my mind
It comes and goes, but leads nowhere

Just when I think I'm winning
When I've broken every door
The ghosts of my life
Blow wilder than before

Just when I thought I could not be stopped
When my chance came to be king
The ghosts of my life
Blow wilder than the wind

Just when I think I'm winning
When I've broken every door
The ghosts of my life
Blow wilder than before

Just when I thought I could not be stopped
When my chance came to be king
The ghosts of my life
Blow wilder than the wind
