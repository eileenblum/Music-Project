Don't wanna take it slow
I wanna take you home
And watch the world explode
From underneath your clothes
I want to watch the way
You creep across my skull

You slowly enter
Cause you know my room
And then you crawl your knees up
Before you shake my tomb

I wanna watch you close
I need to see for sure
After the tape is through
Who do you think we can show

I want to watch your world
Creep across the my sky

You slowly enter
Cause you know my room
And then crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

I want to watch your world
Creep across the my sky

You slowly enter
Cause you know my room
And then crawl your knees off
Before you shake my tomb

You enter slowly
You know my room
You crawl your knees off
And then you shake my tomb
