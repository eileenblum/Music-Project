Complex, priestess come down
Contact, reach us, go wild
I've chased your name,
I've sailed all through space to watch this.
Come down, teach us the ropes...
Your
Concept it keeps us provoked.
Now remove
Your veil and let me light you up.
I'm on
Your team...
Let's go...
Face to face, light
Stare.
My custom made nightmares.
Armed
With teeth in fashion.
Now all we need is
Action.
Complex, priestess, come down.
Now
Contact, reach us, go wild...
Remove your
Veil,
Let me light you up.
I'm on your team,
I'm the antidote...
The rocket's taking off...
Tonight, it's time...
Take me, I'll light you up.
Take me... up.
