I can't tell
How's this shit all my fault
It's at the time and
I feel like they should

And I say commands just because I can
Oh I can just imagine the difference it has

Straight out of your mind
You see I'm well aware
You're out of your mind
Its straight

I said your name
It slipped off my tongue
Pointed at the camera laughing at you
Ha ha
Once again
You see no one cares
Its how you wear it, not why it hates

Straight out of your mind
You see I'm well aware
You're out of your mind
Straight out

I can't tell, how's this shit not your fault
Bitch you're barbaricking off this earth
Switching command just because I can
I'd like to see you wear it
Why can't I stare

Switching command just because I can
And if I let my guard down
Who knows one day
Once again
Just because I can
Just because I can
