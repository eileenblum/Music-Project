You're so sweet
Your smile
Your pussy
And your bones
You're on fire
You move like music with your style

Let me think
(Let you think about what?)
About girls
(And what else?)
And money and new clothes
(And what do I get?)
Thirty nites
(uh huh)
Of violence
(yeah)
And sugar to love

Closer to the lung
Shove her over railing

You're sweet
But I'm tired of proving this love
See you're a bore
But you move me
Like a movie that you love

Let me think
(Let you think about what?)
About girls
(And what else?)
And money and new clothes
(And what do I get?)
Thirty nites
(uh huh)
Of violence
(yeah)
And sugar to love

Closer to the lung
Shove her over railing

Let me think
(Let you think about what?)
About girls
(And what else?)
And money and new clothes
(And what do I get?)
Thirty nites
(uh huh)
Of violence
(yeah)
And sugar to love
Fucking rock star

Closer to the lung
Closer to the lung
Shove her over railing
