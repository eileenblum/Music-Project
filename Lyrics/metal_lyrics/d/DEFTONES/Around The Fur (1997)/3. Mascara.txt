I feel soon
I will sink into you
What do you think
'Cause there's still blood in your hair
And I've got the bruise of the year
But there's something about her long shady eyes
I'm all about her shade tonight
I hate your tatoos
You have weak wrists
But i'll keep you
Well it's too bad
You're married to me
