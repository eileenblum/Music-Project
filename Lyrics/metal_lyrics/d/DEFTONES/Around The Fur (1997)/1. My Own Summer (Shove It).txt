Hey you, big star, tell me when it's over

Hey you, big mood, guide me to shelter
'Cause I'm through when the two hits the six and it's summer

Cloud
Come (shove it) [x 3]
Shove (shove it) [x 3]
The sun (shove it) [x 3]
Aside (shove it aside)

I think god is moving it's tongue
There are no crowds in the streets
And no sun in my own summer

The shade is a tool, a device, a savior
See, I try and look up to the sky
But my eyes burn

Come (shove it) [x 3]
Shove (shove it) [x 3]
The sun (shove it) [x 3]
Aside (shove it aside)
