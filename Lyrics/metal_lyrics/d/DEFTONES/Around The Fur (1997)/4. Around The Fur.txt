Hey vanity, this vile's empty, so are you
Hey glamorous, this vile's not god anymore... yeah

Speak, I don't get it
Should I ignore the fasion
Or go buy the book
I dont want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back aah
Coming back around the fur

Prostitute, climb back down from the floor
Please don't fuck around and die like this
'Cause I love
Her

Speak, I don't get it
Should I ignore the fasion
Or go buy the book
I dont want it
I just want your eyes fixated on me
Coming back aah
Coming back around the fur

Fur, the fur
Speak speak you're so bad to me
I don't want to get dressed over anyway
Come on have some fun
You're a liar
You're a liar and I don't care about aah
