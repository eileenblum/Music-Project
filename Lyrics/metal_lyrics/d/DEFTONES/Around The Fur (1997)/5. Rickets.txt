It's so simple to look at every little thing I do wrong
It's so simple to overlook every little thing I do right

I think too much
I feed too much
I'm gone too much
I skate too much
I snore too much
I'm blowin too much
I ate too much
I'm way too much
Too stuck up

You're probably right this time
But I don't want to listen
You're probably this time
But I don't even care

I dream too much
I think too much
I step too much
Those things too much
I am too much
I'm pissed too much
I need too much
I kinda want to throw

You're probably right this time
But I don't want to listen
You're probably this time
But I don't even care

And if it was mine to say, I wouldn't say it
And if it was mine to say, I wouldn't speak

You're probably right this time
But I don't want to listen
You're probably this time
But I don't even care

And if it was mine to say, I wouldn't say it
And if it was mine to say, I wouldn't speak
