Got back out, back off the forefront
I never said, or got to say bye to my boy, but
It's often I try
I think about how id be screaming
And the times would be bumping
All our minds would be flowing
Taking care of shit like
Hey holmes what you needing
As lifes coming off
Whack it will open your eyes

As I proceed to get loose
You seem to have some doubt
I feel you next to me
Fiending getting spacey
With the common love of music
Think of this as the sun and the mind
As a tool
But we could bounce back from this one
With attitude will and some spirit
With attitude will and your spirit
We'll shove it aside

Soulfly
Fly high
Soulfly
Fly free

Shut your shit, please say what you will.
I can't think
Sidestep around
I'm bound to the freestyle
Push down to the ground
With a nova dash but they watch you
Now climb up, super slide
The spirits so low it's coming over you

Soulfly
Fly high
Soulfly
Fly free

When you walk in to this world
Walk in to this world
With your head up high

Headup
