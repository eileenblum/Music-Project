Somewhere outside there are tricks and evil
Holler downstairs while I drive

I want to watch you buttercup
coming through the fog

Dying of bordem, I'll try it all

Sixteen olive
Skin bound by a voice

I dont want to go
But I want it well
At least you fucking care

Dying of bordem, i'll try it all

I'll be faint like a crook
It looks and feels great
But look at what it's doing to you
But that's ok, look how it feels
