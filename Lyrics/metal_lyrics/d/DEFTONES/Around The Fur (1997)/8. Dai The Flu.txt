I always wondered
What it takes
Fifteen stitches
And a soft parody
To make my eyes be like deceit
I believe the sting proves heart to me
And now I know that you love me
Thank god that you love at all
Dislocated at the joint
Timing is everything in the bed
'Cause you'll sleep for hours
To keep away
Then sink the teeth
And bat your eyes
Now I know that you love me
Thank god you love at all
What a surprise
I was right
Here going off and going on
At least now I know that you love me
Thank god that you love at all
What a surprise
I was right here going off
Going on dai the flu
