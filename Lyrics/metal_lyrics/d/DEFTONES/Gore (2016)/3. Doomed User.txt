There went your time, say goodbye now leave here
My fuse has expired fuckin' die just leave here

Powerless stuck in your web of shit
Open your eyes you only play yourself
Whoever's watching I hope they catch the drift
Collect your crown you're now the queen of filth

There went your life go and die I mean it
Loose and defiled you define the meaning

They're delusions don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you

I've been scared fuckin' repulsed by this
My only tale is one that I can't stand
Now I've become this core of rotted will
My heart is black and I will never feel

There say goodbye just retire from the earth
You've been exiled take you body elsewhere
They're delusions don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you
Go waste your breath somewhere to someone new

Your castle has burned down on you
Your kingdom in burning down

They're delusions don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you

They're delusions don't deny it
Don't make this out to be something about you
Go waste your breath somewhere to someone new
