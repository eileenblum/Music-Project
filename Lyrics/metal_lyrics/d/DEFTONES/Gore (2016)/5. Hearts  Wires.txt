Nothing can save me now
Is what I believe
The slit in the sky when you left
Is all see

Nothing to sing about
I've bared all my leaves
No vision or dreams about you
Came true for me

Cut through
This razor wire
And dine on your heart
Mine 'till the end

Stuck with illusion now
I drown in your sea
I hope that you'll first save yourself
And then come fore me

Cut through
This razor wire
And dine on your heart
Mine 'till the end
Break through
Clip the wires
And writhe in your heart
Mine 'till the end

A way a way out
Down deep into your veins all the way all the way
Down deep in your heart all the way all the way

Cut through
The razor wire
Mine 'till the end
Break through
Clip the wires
And dine on your heart
Mine 'till the end
