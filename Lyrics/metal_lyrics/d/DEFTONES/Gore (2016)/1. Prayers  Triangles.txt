There's a new strange godless demon awake inside me
There's a force divine terrorizing the angels I keep
While we dream
Prayers laid on the line, you will never be free

I'm a true slave to the fire and the air around you
While this cursed divine is slowly rotting away inside me
While we dream

Prayers laid on the line, you will never be free
Triangles placed in your mind--you will never be free

I'd beware

I will walk this street again
The only time I feel I'm not alone
I pull my heart out wave it in the air

Prayers laid on the line, you will never be free
Triangles placed in your mind--you will never be free
Prayers/triangles
You will never be free

I will walk this street again
The only time I feel I'm not alone
I pull my heart out wave it in the air
I pull my heart out beware
