I don't miss you
I don't care where you are now
You're a ghost to me
Left with my taste in your mouth

Taken away somewhere new

I'm used to it
This body here but I'm gone

When I re-awake
I'll re-awake in the waves

In a new realm
Catch this dream on film
You might just get used to it and you'll smile, and dive deep

I sail on these waves
Slip into the calming waves

You're an old hex
That just drained my will
So I put this gun to my head and I smile, and dive deep

I sail on these waves
Slip into the calming waves
Deep into the calming waves

We have created
Now we're gone

And now a reawakening
Another form of myself
I come right out of my skin

Slip into the calming waves
Deep into the calming waves
Slip into the calming waves
Deep into

Right now
Bear witness
This rebirth
Right now
