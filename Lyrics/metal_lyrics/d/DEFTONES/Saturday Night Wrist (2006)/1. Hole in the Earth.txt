Hey!
Can you explain to me how
You're so evil, how?
It's too late for me now...
There's a hole in the earth... (a hole in the earth)
I'm out.
There's a hole in the earth... (a hole in the earth)
I'm out.

Hey!
Can you explain to me now
If you're still able, well...
It's time I think you know the truth...
There's a hole in the earth...
I'm out.

I hate all of my friends.
They all lack taste sometimes.
There's a hole in the earth... (a hole in the earth)
I'm out.
There's a hole in the earth... (a hole in the earth)
I'm out.

Let's take a bow.
This is the end
Somewhere this is the end
Somewhere

There's a hole in the earth... (a hole in the earth)
There's a hole in the earth... (a hole in the earth)
I hate all of my friends.
I'm out.

[screaming]

WOO!
