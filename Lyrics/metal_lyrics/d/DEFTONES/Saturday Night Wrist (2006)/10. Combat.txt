This time the fingers pointed at you
Which side are you on? Which side are you on?
I ask you what side since you pointed it out
Which side are you on? Which side are you on?

A waste of time if you don't believe
Can't decide till you've hit the ground
Make your mind because you're holding me down
(And I want to get down)
And always did

This time the fingers pointed right at you
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
A waste of time if you don't believe
Can't decide, till you've hit the ground
Make your mind though you don't believe
Can't decide, till you've hit the ground
Make your mind 'cause you're holding me down
(And I want to get down)

don't think that I don't know 'cause I do
Nice try
Guess that's what you're really like, like

Let something out, say something else
Decide whose side you're on
Whose side are you on? Decide. Go on?
