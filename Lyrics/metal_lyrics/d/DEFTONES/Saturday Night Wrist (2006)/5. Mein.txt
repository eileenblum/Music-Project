[featuring Serj Tankian]

I've looked outside
but I never wandered out
I'd like to pull you into me intercept you in between
but I never wandered out, outside

That way I'll always stay away from you...

I've looked inside but I never wandered in
I'd like to pull you into me and intercept you in between but I never wandered in, inside

That way I'll always stay away from you
The universe breaking us down
