Two different types
The same kind of thread
different needle sewn up
hey hey
It's rapture
but it's a different style
It's rapture
the same kind of thread
Go ahead begin, begin
You'll like it, again it kills, and it feels... like

One's inside of me
The other carves you out for me
Two different views... different designs
Except one cuts you worse

I know how you are now
You twist everything else around
Now you're fucking with me
It's a waste of my time

You said "I won't again," I swear to God
You said "I swear to God," I won't again
You said "I won't again," I swear to God
You said "I swear to God," I won't again
Instead you just waste, waste, waste my time
Instead you just waste, waste my time

If one takes it away
Though other one makes up for it
It's just two different views, different designs
If I could choose one, which one?

I know how you are now
You twist everything else around
Now you're fucking with me
You just waste, waste, waste my time

You begin you begin, you like it you begin
Kills it kills...life

You said "I won't again," I swear to God
You said "I swear to God," I won't again
You said "I won't again," I swear to God
You said "I swear to God," I won't again
Instead you just waste, waste, waste my time
Instead you just waste, waste, waste my time

Two definite sides
the same kind of thread
Just different needles
It's rapture
but it's a different style
It's rapture
the same kind of thread
