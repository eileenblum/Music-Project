She haunts the roads
She waits for a new face

Her arms red and injured she wants to rest,
She can't till we have faced
I've cut your armies down and torn your heart

You wait, I wait
Outside awake

I cut your armies down and torn your heart

You wait, I wait
Outside awake

She haunts the road
She waits for a new face
