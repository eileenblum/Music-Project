Decide, decide is this it?
Is it? Decide
Is that your style? Is it?
Decide, decide, is this it?
Is it? Decide
Then everything's just fine
You wanted it

Was it like you dreamed?
you got it and is wasn't like it seemed

You know I wouldn't say nothing,
Nothing, not a thing
Well I should have said something,
Something, something

Decide, decide is this it?
Is it? Decide
Is that your style? Is it?
Decide, decide, is this it?
Is it? Decide
Then everything's just fine
You wanted it

Was it like you dreamed?
you got it and is wasn't like it seemed

Now I wanna say nothing nothing
Not a fucking thing
Just wanna take something something something
Now Was it worth it worth it
Just one fucking thing
I could've said something something SOMETHING

Decide, decide is this it?
Is it? Decide
Is that your style? Is it?
Decide, decide, is this it?
Is it? Decide
Then everything's just fine
You wanted it

Everything's fine
Everything is fine
Everything's just fine
Everything is FINE
LIAR
