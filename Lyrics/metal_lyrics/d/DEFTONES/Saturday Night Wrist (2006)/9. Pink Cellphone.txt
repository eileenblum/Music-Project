[featuring Annie Hardy]

Belief in the one true power

Can't stop the sound
Can you?
Can't stop the sound
Can't stop the sound, I can't stop you
X your heart, let the tape roll
Can't stop the sound
Can you? Can't stop the sound, I can't stop you
X your eyes I'll tell you when

So your troubles continue to multiply
your growth is a direct result of your being misguided.
Deceived. Misdirected. Or fooled.
All of these are variations of the basic ego gloried live theme,
in which you follow the gospel truth.

[mumbling]

Pursuing the wrong ideals and goals that leads you into sickness.
unto and from this sickness bring the belief in the one true power.
That cure that promised to erase the symptoms
that stood between you and your goal.
That's seductive pure that offered relief and comfort
without disturbing the faulty system of your beliefs.
the belief in the one true power.
Forever and ever, one nation under the belief,
of the father, the son, and the Holy spirit in Jesus' name, Amen.

Greasy filthy hand jobs in truck stop restrooms.
Hot Carling? All over my,  Hot Carling?
I turned that into a verb. I hope you appreciate it.
Carling. Hot Carling Academy. It's the school where you go to learn how to butt fuck.
It's In England. They don't have blowjobs there because they're uncircumcised and that is just disgusting.
So they have to buttfuck.
Which is also disgusting, because that extra foreskin trapped all the germs and the poop and the buttfucking residue.
It's sin. And that's why British people have bad teeth. Amen.
