The earth
Will see
Our lives go blank tonight
The earth
will rot away
Go blink your eyes
I, I really wish these snakes were your arms
I really wish you'd make up your mind

The earth
disguised a way
Don't blink tonight
The earth
Will see our eyes go blank tonight

I, I really wish these snakes were your arms
I really wish you'd make up your mind

No.
No.
No.
