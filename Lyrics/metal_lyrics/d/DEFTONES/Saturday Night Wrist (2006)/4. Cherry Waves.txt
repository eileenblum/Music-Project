In a sea of waves we hug the same plank
(Saw your end...)
Just as I had rehearsed it over in my brain
(I saw your end...)

If the waves suck you in and you drown

If like... you should sink down beneath...
I'll swim down...
Would you? Would you?

You hang the anchors over my neck... (saw your end)
I liked it at first but the more you laughed the crazier I came...

And the waves suck you in and you drown

If like you should sink down beneath...
I'll swim down. Would you?
Is that what you want?
You...well, that's what you've got?

Wave... after... wave...

If you should sink down beneath
I'll swim down.
Would you?
Is that what you want?
