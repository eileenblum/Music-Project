Universe (surrounds you)
When you're ready it waits (for us to) leave this Earth
Come on, they're calling your name out

I don't know, I could stay or leave
Either way 'cause the comet can take us either way through

Goodbye, safe, heaven, new
I'll be waiting
Goodbye, safe, heaven, new
I'll be waving goodbye

Return to see, everything looks the same
I don't know if the change it made was grave,
because the craving remains the same

Goodbye
safe, heaven, new
I'll be waving
Goodbye
Safe, heaven, new

I'll be waving (goodbye) I'll be waving,
I'll be waving
Goodbye
