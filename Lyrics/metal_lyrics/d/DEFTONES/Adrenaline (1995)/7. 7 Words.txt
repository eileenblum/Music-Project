I'll never be the same, breaking decency
Don't be tree trunk, don't fall on my living roots
I've been humming too many words, got a weak self esteem
That's been stomped away from every single dream
But there's something else that brought us peace
Keep it all inside until we feel we can unleash
I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone
I think it should be glorified, now your wrong

Suck [12x] they fuck with my head
Suck [10x] suck it you pig

You and me are here alone face flat along the edge of the glass
Well I'm not here to preach, I'm just sick of thugs
My parents made me strong to lift up that glass
So why should I try, act like I'm a little pissed off
With all that shit that needs to stay back in the shelf
Because your fuck ass made it up, your fucking mind is gone
Shoud've never glorified, now your right

Suck [12x] they fuck with my head
Suck [10x] suck it you pig

Shut up you don't know me, shut up you don't know me
Squeal like a pig when you big fuckin, big fuckin, ape!!
Well I'll tell you about my false dad,
What's coming back jack, Well dirtbag
Curse for in their words
Whether not your fucking hurt
I'm making no sense, what's coming as I jump in ya
I think I'm something naughty or most anybody
So thinking of me by now but you go grab it
And I can't think for who I am this shit
I belong where they be, 'cause we can not give back those lives
We exist to cease - understand
That god hates blacks shades and all the players
Mr. P.I.G could I fuckin see
Sure already done crushed all of my brothers dignity
And to the jury can't be no turnerson my skin this color
Does that mean I'm burned
Cause your fuck ass made it up, your fuckin mind was gone
Should've never glorified, wrong!

Suck! [12x] they fuck with my head
Suck! [10x] suck it you pig
