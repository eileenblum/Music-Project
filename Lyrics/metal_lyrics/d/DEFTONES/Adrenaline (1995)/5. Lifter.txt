Watch me With your eyes
Been giving God
A paedophile
I want to Be just like you
Then I'd be cool
Maybe not

But
We left our eyes
Big surprise
Kiss me goodbye
Whore

Without you being here
I've be giving fear
A bit more
I wish I could feel like you
When I fuck like you
Being sore

But
We left our eyes
Big surprise
Kiss me goodbye

It makes it more
That you work for
Every knuckle wiped into her
I know if I get more style
I will never get what I want
Inside of her

And this gift of mine
Resing, restring, unwind
My eyes are closed

A part of me gets pissed, a part of me gets sore

And it makes it more
That you worked for
Every knuckle wiped into her
I know if I get more style
I will never get what I want

Inside of her

A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sick, a part of me gets sore
A part of me gets...

...Inside of her

A part of me gets sore, a part of me gets sick
A part of me gets so fucking sick
