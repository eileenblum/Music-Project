We are beggers, we're blown
And I will meet you fourth floor
Then we'll make up -- no

No fist to fuckin save you from
You knock me out

I'll take the burden full blown
And then we'll, I'll be there -- no
Do you think I care?

No fist to fucking save you from
You knock me out
No fist to fuckin save you from
I'm going home

Everything felt good
Everythings right at first
When I was cursed -- maddog

Life before I would shine down unshy
It comes from the first one I
While I watched you

Makes me sick, makes me go
I would shine
I want to be much then more
While I watch you
Life before I would shine down unshy
I want to be much then more
While I watch you

Life before I would shine down unshy
I want to be much than more, while I watch you
I wanna be much then more, while I watch you
I want to be much then more while I watch you
I, much more while I watch you
I want to be much then more while I watch you
