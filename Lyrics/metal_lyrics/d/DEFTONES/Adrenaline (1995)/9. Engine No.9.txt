This ain't no motherfuckin stick up
Just pick the stick up and watch it roll real close
Rolling out my hand till it cracks to that fucking dome
Living of the curb that peels you from the curb
I lick the rest off do you dig, many in 93
Been making fools 'bout round, bumping around me
You'll want to run straight from underground
At the best walk the live from the verb
On the beats I won't see your fuckin whore
Peers I flow, and mother she
Won't drain herself and won't be caught to live
All live in a big world inside just because
My life is unrise wipe
The lyrical did did

Get straight quickley
Been making fools 'bout round, bumping round me
You'll want to see from underground
When no one else walks the live from the verb
Now come in and see you fuckin whore

Peers I flow and mother she
Won't drain herself and won't be caught to live
She did what, she did what, she did what
Just because my life is unrise wipe
The Lyrical did did
Wipe
Did
Last one wipe
Lyrical did

Begin in me because
My psycho wipe
What lyrical did
Stop the fucken wipe
The lyrical did
Big into the wipe
Wipe
Did
