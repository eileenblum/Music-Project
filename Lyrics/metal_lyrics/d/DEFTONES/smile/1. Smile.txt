We move together, we cruise till the end
Screwing and shooting our way out
You want to know what itâs like?
Then watch this
You want to feel again?
You wanted thisâ¦
Welcome to my world
Now, you want to feel again

Smile, youâre born again
Do you feel wet? Do you feel love?

Weâve sailed through hell knows
Theyâve sank but we float on
You want to go for a ride?
Itâs over you want to feel again?
Youâve always said that you knew my worth
and now you want to feel it again

Smile, youâre born again
Do you feel wet? Do you feel love?

We cruise togetherâ¦ Itâs me and you till the end

Smile, youâre born again
Do you feel wet? Do you feel love?
