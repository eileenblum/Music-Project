Itâs a mistake but go ahead, take a side
But watch how you choose
Iâll be heading for a ride
Cause I, I just donât know about you

I canât stop what you began
I canât fight for what you began

Youâve opened the gates
Now face the other side
Just go up, itâs cool
Now head into the fire
I, I just donât know if I could

I canât stop what you began
I canât fight for what you began

I know whatâs inside
For you to gain

Switch on your game
Stop wasting all your time
Cause surprise, itâs you
Who fakes what is inside
But I, I have known about you

I canât stop what you began
I canât fight for what you began

I know whatâs inside
I know what you think
I canât stop what you began
