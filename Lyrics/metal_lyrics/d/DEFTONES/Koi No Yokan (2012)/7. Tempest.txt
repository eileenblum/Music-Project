Take out the stories
They've put into your mind
And brace for the glory
As you stare into the sky, the sky
Beneath I know you can't be tired

Lay there
Stare at the ceiling
And switch back to your time
Just go ahead
Now try and taste it
I know it should be ripe

Thrust
Ahead

Turning in circles, been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival cut to the end
I'd like to be taken apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

I wonder just how you shaped it to get back to your prize

Thrust
Ahead

Turning in circles, been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival cut to the end
I'd like to be taken apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

Wake for the glory
I know you can't be tired

Turning in circles, been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival cut to the end
I'd like you to take me apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

Inside
Inside
Inside

Turning in circles, been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival cut to the end
I'd like you to take me apart from the inside
Right to the end
