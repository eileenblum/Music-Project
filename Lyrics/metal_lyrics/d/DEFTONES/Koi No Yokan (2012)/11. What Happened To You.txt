In the winds of your cape 
Iâve sailed with you 
From the shore to the gates 
We sway

Weâre alive somewhere else 
Far ahead of our time

In a game of display we break in two 
We perform the hornets escape

Weâre alive somewhere else 
Still asleep someplace new 
Weâre ahead of our time 
Floating through

The sky is falling down 
This night belongs to you 

Forty years in the winds 
Iâve played with you. 
For the rest of our days 
Iâll remain 

The sky is falling down 
The night is calling you 
A star is burning out 
The sky belongs to you 

Weâre alive somewhere else 
Still asleep someplace new 
Far ahead of our time
Floating through
