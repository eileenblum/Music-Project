What can I say?
I think I had enough
I think you keep playing to play
Knowing that I feel sick
Câmon show me
Just say you like to play
This game
Just to drive me wild

I let you pretend
But you know
Truth is that
I love you to death
Like you love this game

This time, thereâs a common thread
And so I sit and watch you play it dumb 
Iâd like to see you play with the odds
On your plate instead
Come on just say it
Just say you like to keep this pace
Just to drive me wild

I let you pretend
But you know
Truth is that
I love you to death
Like you love this game
It keeps me hanging tight

What can I say?
I think your headâs fucked
Go on drive me wild

This time
Thereâs a constant thing
This time
Thereâs a common thread
Keep me hanging tight
And it tells me somethingâs right

What can I say?
I fuckin had enough
I think you just play what you play
Knowing that I feel sick
Câmon just say it
Just say you like to play this game
Cuz it drives me wild
