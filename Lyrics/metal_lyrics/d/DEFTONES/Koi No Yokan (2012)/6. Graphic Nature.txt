Leave your trail open
Let me inside
Cause Iâm confused more or less
Shed some light

And tell me your secret
How are you trained?
I promise you I can keep it
Go on, explain

Tell me how you do it now
Your poison is glowing
Against the night
How can you lose
Just show them tricks we like

Iâm aware of the demons
That youâve tucked away
I like to watch you release them
Go on and say

Tell me how you do it
Every time it takes my knees out
Every time you do it
Iâm surprised, surprised
So go!

Show your strings, your wires
Check the lights
Provide me clues just go ahead
And break your silence

And tell me your secret
Can I watch you change?
Although Iâd like to believe it
Go on explain

Tell me how you do it
Every time it takes my knees out
Every time you do it
Iâm on fire

Tell me how you do it
Every time it takes my knees out
Every time you do it
Iâm surprised

How the fuck you do it?
Every time you take my knees out
Yeah every time you do it
Iâm on fire, fire
Iâm on fire, fire
Iâm on fire
