I carve my name across your towns when I'm set
Cut inside before the trends begin
I spend my time perfecting waves of contrast
Cutting out all the same shit I've outgrown

I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease, no sweat

I see the crowns and I forget the couture
Two at a time I watch the kingdoms fold

I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease, no sweat
I'm breaking in with all my friends
So are you in?

Designed for you... Designed by me...

Before we get down we must prepare the heart strings
To cut all the ties and watch the trends begin

I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease, no sweat
I'm breaking in with all my friends
So are you in?

Designed special for you by me
