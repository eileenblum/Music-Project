I process
Your constant changing phases
I watch them
Releasing right on cue

In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours

So why wait to discover your dreams?
Now hereâs your chance
I promise
To watch and raise your babies
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours

Iâm hypnotized by your name
I wish this night would never end

So why wait for the colors to bleed?
What do you expect?
So heartless we march into the fumes

In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours

Iâm hypnotized by your name
I wish this night would never end
I wish this night

Iâm hypnotized by your name
I wish this night would never end
I wish this night
I wish this night wouldnât end
I wish this night
