This is your chance, revolt, resist! 
Open your chest, look down, reach in. 
Shed your skin, showing your texture. 
Time to let everything inside you 
Youâre cutting all ties now and forever 
Time to let everything outside you 

This is your test, come forth, confess! Extend 
Your tongue, speak out, go on. 
Shed your skin, showing your texture. 
Time to let everything inside you 
Youâre cutting all ties now and forever 
Time to let everything outside you 

Shed your casing, show your lines and shapes. 
Wear your insides, on the outside 
Show your enemy, what you look like
What you look like, what you look like
From the inside, from the inside

Cutting all ties now and forever
Time to go

Shed your skin, showing your texture. 
Time to let everything inside you 
Youâre cutting all ties now and forever 
Time to let everything outside you

Shed your casing, show your lines and shapes. 
Wear your insides, on the outside 
Show your enemy, what you look like
What you look like, what you look like
From the inside, from the inside
