[Gilder, McCulloch]

[cover from Gilder, taken from "City  Nights", 1978]

Danger... in the shape of something wild
Stranger... dressed in black she's a hungry child
No one knows who she is or what her name is
I don't know where she came from or
What her game is

[Chorus:]
Hot child in the city... hot child in the city...
Running wild and lookin' pretty... hot child in the city...

So young to be loose and on her own
Young boys, they all want to take her home
When she goes downtown the boys all stop and stare
When she goes downtown she walks like she just don't care

[Chorus]

Come on down to my place baby, we'll talk about love
Come on down to my place woman, we'll make love...
