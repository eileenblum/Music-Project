[Lyrics Tommy Gonzales]

The sky is foreboding
As past lies disinter
From archives of the government
Lost and forgotten by time
Oppression is the key
To control society
Those who say we live freely
Obviously cant see

[Chorus:]
Monitored by the NSA
Molested by the TSA
Why do we live this way?
We can only hope
That its not to late i say
(No more police state)

[Solo Spencer]

Dark clouds of conspiracy
Brainwash us subliminally
Usage of the media
Renders us the think
Why cant you see
Where the lies will lead our nation
Our future is ominous
of our sure desolation.

[Chorus]

[Solo Tommy]

(No more police state)
