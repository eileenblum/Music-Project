[Lyrics and music by Tommy Gonzales]

Headed towards a mechanized future, spied on in the name of terror
Every things controlled by the party, welcome to 1984
We are all slaves to the system bred to hate fake terrorists
Like dogs trained to kill we don't know what for
But we kill for big brother

[Chorus:]
Welcome to
1984
With no hope
We surrender
Where freedom is slavery
War is peace
Ignorance is strength
And big brothers
Watching you

Psychologically tortured by a man on a screen
Controlling the masses with hate
constantly watched by the thought police
(You will think our way)
Propaganda turns us all into sheep
you will support the war
No thinking for yourself, no living on your own
your property of the state

(You are property of the state)

[Chorus]

Down with big brother [3x]

[Solos Tommy]

Is this our future [3x]
I think it is
