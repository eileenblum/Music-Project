[Lyrics and music by Tommy Gonzales]

He was a nerd just living with his mother (Hey)
Mopping up floors and working at the gym (Hey)
Wasting his life in the middle of nowhere (Hey)
here in Tromaville USA (Oi Oi Oi)

Until one day he was dumped in toxic waste (Hey)
Straight out of the nuclear reactor (Hey)
Morphed and mutated into a monster (Hey)
Now hes the Toxic Avenger (Oi Oi Oi)

[Chorus:]
Toxic Avenger [4x]

First hero outta new Jersey (Hey)
Killing criminals and cleaning up the city (Hey)
Hunting down bad guys saving the day (Hey)
Here in Tromaville USA (Oi Oi Oi)

Now the monster has saved all of us (Hey)
He killed the mayor, ripped out his guts (Hey)
Hes no longer just a nerdy ginger (Hey)
Hes the Toxic Avenger (Oi Oi Oi)

[Chorus]
