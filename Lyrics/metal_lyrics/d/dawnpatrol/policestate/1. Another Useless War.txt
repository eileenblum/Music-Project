[Lyrics and music by Tommy Gonzales]

Soldiers sent off to fight in another useless war
Our youth are dying and we don't know what for
Don't worry son your dying for the state.
Countries flag on your casket this was your fate.
You joined the army just to serve your country.
A respectable effort but it makes no sense to me.
The rich are profiting while your in your grave.
We must stop this insanity before its to late.

Another useless war [4x]

War is raging and death will carry on.
Pawns sent out with a helmet and a gun.
You support the troops well then lets bring em home.
War brings peace why does this myth carry on

Another useless war [4x]

War [3x]
Another useless war.
