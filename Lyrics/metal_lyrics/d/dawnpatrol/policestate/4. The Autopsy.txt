[Lyrics by Spencer Martin music by Spencer Martin and Tommy Gonzales]

[Stripped] From Gods helping hand, yet you still follow blindly.
Hemorrhaging, life's cut short, the final rites begin.
Malevolent, victims to their graves. start of a blistering end.
Lifeless eyes stare, a new atrocity, another deadly sin

[Chorus:]
Lies
Follow lies
and death, follows death
Salvation
Through immolation
(You're sworn)
To obey
The Autopsy

Misled sheep, a dim ray of light. is the lesson really learned.
The deities grasp pulled you towards a paradise out of reach.
Schizophrenic, the clergy thrives. The method of murder is divine.
Extermination, get on your knees, pray your not next in line.

[Chorus]

[Solo Spencer]
[Solo Tommy]
