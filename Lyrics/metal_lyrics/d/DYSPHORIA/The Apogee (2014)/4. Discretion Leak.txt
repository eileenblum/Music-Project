Do you still hope to conquer the system where flattery and mutual protection beat a path for the right person while defaming into dust the rest of unlucky ones?

Small people, sitting in their cozy comfort zones, do splutter violently while playing patriots and using paper orders to ship the armies straight to death, divide or merge the whole countries apart, as well as wasting millions of civilians and not giving a single chance
of pity to external enemy image helpfully provided (oh, well, imposing) by Big Brother.

At the same time people of slightly another sort are sitting in much more comfortable thrones and de facto implement waking dreams of dodgy herd.

However profit coming from their frauds is clear and available only to the narrow circle of most influential persons who enjoy national wealth and laugh up their sleeves with arrogance against poverty-ridden ants somewhere near the human hive bottom.

Nevertheless every bug is blindly concerned in its own unshakable rightness and is ready to defend humanityâs miserable positions till the last hair remaining.

How tragically it is to notice when cog in the machine considers itself as engine and core of the mechanism, and how united the screw is with those governing history millstones, thereby providing oiled path for rubbish projects of the rich supreme.

And though the engine shall require replacement, sooner or later, within this period a thousand of cogs shall be relegated to oblivion, straight before the memory about the nutters who led us into abyss is also wasted.

We may battle with injustice to fight for democratic laws and overthrow corrupted governors, but the only thing shall remain the same.

You are going to be gutted, and none of your existence traces shall be left.
