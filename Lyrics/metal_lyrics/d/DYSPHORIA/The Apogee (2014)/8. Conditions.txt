Disorder has become a basic factor of life and activities of bureaucrats who invented kleptocracy state and bound dependent population with volumes of transcendental laws and dualistic decrees.

When it is impossible to trust government propaganda machine any more and what happened yesterday may be fully forgotten tomorrow, moreover, marked as non-existing, then chaos shall legally take the reigns of government over the lambs and bald wolves.

Youâd only try to come out with ordered ideas in order to reform public principles and for improvement of its matesâ life standards.

Chaos shall immediately swallow you together with your plucks, simultaneously shielding with righteous court from democracy defendants and statehood stronghold.

It also shall find hundreds of reasons, law links and orders which expose the heresy represented by improvement process.

While not disdaining compromising evidence, the authorities shall absorb any attempt to shift wolves from lucrative job and to decrease for at least a little the impact of the power that be onto the slaves.
