Have you ever thought about His Majesty?
Hidden hand that pulls the tiny strings
Uselessness of which I confess in
Prevail upon my generosity
Mark up and violate
And in this wasteland
I crawl eternally on my knees
Pressure of success
Entrail your system
And choking in
I am not an overlording kind
For everyone of you
Narcissistic bitches thinking they are the only way
Through the woods of history
But they will get a slay
We are the slaves
Forsaken hypocrites
And never contradict your servile guilt
I am nothing
Improve the world
Affected by disease
God would be ashamed
To look like this
Wounded soldier
Pray for the mercy
Receive our dark seed
Eternal, unquenchable desire
To kill when the whole world passionate by dectruction
Based on blood-soaked human bodiesâ soil
Fortunes of war
You will regret you did it fast away
Something beyond somebodyâs wildest dreams
And more than you could ever hope for
I give you collapse as a highest present
Become the penetration
Behold to anger the hardly living
But those who are being supported
By faith till which you will not survive
Think twice before leaving the ruins
In order
To reach the formulated purpose
Pseudo-patriotism is your betrayal
In front of whole humanity
The last son of the fallen father
New religion
Self-titled hierarchy
