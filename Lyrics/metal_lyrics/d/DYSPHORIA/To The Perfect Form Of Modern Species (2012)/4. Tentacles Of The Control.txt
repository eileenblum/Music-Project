Shadow of the Big Brother
Is watching
Put you under observation
Every time you smile to the betrayer
Everything related to the freedom
Confrontation of the lords
For worldwide control
Like vultures tearing human flesh apart
You brick yourself a path to pedestal
To anathematize
Made of whole worldâs ruins
There is a reason of why we are placed on the earth
Human assault
And my purpose is not a consequence
Of destruction
In the benefit of all
I would only destroy
Your grasping dreams
Fakes and primitive clichÃ©s
Which you need to control with
Internal issues violation
Breeds despair
I speak of those born to be controlled
I speak of those born to be forgotten
Human-like, diseased and never alive
Inherited slavery absorbed
With motherâs milk
Obedience is unknown
To those growing up under oppression
Issues are being born in the brain
And both dying there
Choice is up to you
To let the invisible hand to possess you
Limitations are tortures themselves
Physical control
Doesnât equal to the mental one
Apathy desolation to everyone
Everyone
Multiply your kind
And fall into the sleep
You got stuck in flat reality
Which is denied by the
The tentacles of control
And visibility strangle hope
And rape freedom
Now do not trust, do not feel
These illusions of heaven are hell
I adore my dismal shell
False idols, false gods
Interpreting the righteousness like success
Guarantee they covering their horrible deeds
Jugulating the morality
