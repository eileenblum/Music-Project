Got drown in faith
Rise up your hands above the cross where faith is lost
Who is a prophet now?
How could thy sins be forgiven by a single word
Spoken from the mouth of a liar?
Now face the endless era of the tragedy
Accompanied by horde of insincerity
Make them feel scared by your antagonism
Mind distortion by the great hallucination
Break those chains of god
Servants, bow your heads and obey to the church
As well as holy fakeness and almighty deceiver
There's no god to worship, fuck it
You must unveil the layer of falsity
To take a look at terrifying reality
Of your possession
The origin of all failures is
In the blind unwillingnes
To think about the pother people
In the world of the total control
I stare at your vacant species
But youâll never be forgotten by the history
Under the sign of your Deceiver
Got stuck in treachery of prayers to your god
Why was I supposed to scream these lies?
Murder the neighbor to spite your lovely god
Every place is a shadow for memories
Why they must survive? Iâm faceless for disorder
I am abomination of aborted slaughter
Youâve chosen me to execute the prejudice control
I swear you will be removed
And never returned
