Â 
Wash your hands in terror
Save your perfect form
In front of the eyes of destruction
Finest form of mental rot
Visions of the dead world
Also a fake image
I wish you could remain the same
And keep the constancy of agony forever
I swear no one has ever hurt like that before
So that Iâm able to recover devilâs fame
I give my praise to egoism
Youâd better do not tempt the fate of the divine
Metabolical extension may be interrupted
In a very subtle but considerable way
Drown yourself in apathy and sins
Expendable materials are what you are destined for
Waiting for the darkest governor
What shall be now?
He who shall be worthy of us all
Cancer is your fate
Motivating by three vile principles
To feed the belly
For saving our world
Upon your fate
Release the truth
Show me your true nature
To purify our damnation
The emptiness is filled by your cry
Normal is being justified
As unacceptable
But how much of you do consider gloominess
As a perfect paradise?
Being animal
How could you spend day by day?
Itâs your grief
And emptiness is filled by your
Justifications
Of what shall be done or may happen
Because of the less questions I ask
