Hand down this filthy genocide
I am the one who made within this night
Enough of stupid soldiersâ eternal life
I declare this motor paralysis and donât give a fuck about
I tell ya what you should buy so that all the neighbours shall masturbate
Hate them all and bring them to the sacrifice
Another day another failure and you keep me provoked
According to the medical consumersâ philosophy
Luxuries of the middle phantom working class
Otherwise well kick you out to the social bums
Down to the rate it makes a laughing stock of us
The bad news is Iâll stop that diagnosis that you will not survive
Run in circle
We are in despaired century again
Walk for you
We breed in and in. We bring ourselves into hideous sin
The pseudo-science false to enlighten true reason
Of your disgusting flabbiness, spineless sheep!
Face it and you will get appreciation from the One
But spare the cash
Think about that, now we are also at the bottom and in the top of food chain
Of them, because you just need to watch the infectionable
One pill, drug-born, idiotic, left for dead
Tell me who I am or just feed the animal with its own waste
Cherish the fucking under-human
We wonât see a difference for few years and every problem in this world is
In the subway of the fucking human being
Prepare your fucking gun of your disgusting demise
Hyperactive turning
So that we all could see thereâs nothing
Hand down your wretched legacy
Plugged with chords into neurotic inheritance of you, fucker!
By the so perfect for the modern defective species!
Donât you believe me?
I am the one who made within this life
Enough of stupid sludgersâ eternal night
Neurotic asphyxia of melted mind
Your invalid morphosis
I spread my decayed wings
