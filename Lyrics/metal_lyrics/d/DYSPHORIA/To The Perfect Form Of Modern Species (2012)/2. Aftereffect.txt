Every time you move away
Further and further from the utopia
Which havenât ever exist
And shall never be real
What could be more beautiful than watching
The dusk of every day accompanied by human failure?
Manufacture the kind by yourself
To idealize the consumption
And paint it with blood of your brothers
Blinded by the will of a tyrant
A patriot
A child of god
Desolated, who submits to humanityâ order
Your life is none
You are the highest form of the manipulation
One more proof that people
Do not differ from the animals
Insane predators
Starvation manifest is kneeling
In front of the tyrant mother of earth
The physical solution of loathing and vice
Needs to be imposed to recreate
Premature beauty of the madness
There is something perfect to us all
Irrational consumers of all things living
A gene of distorted consumption
Such a beautiful failure
Of all mankind
The altar of essential needs
In the awakening
Of manâs incorporated instincts
Those who were nothing shall never become
Anything important
But the biological material
For the most perfect creation of the men
Delicious feed for virus
Some people can be proud of being born twice
But let us face the truth
The whole generetaion requires
Life support system
But which highest power
Shall breathe the intellect into the beast we used to call?
Our future brings dissimulation
And leads us to hegemony of the Overseer
Modern man, who are you?
The creature
That even gods started afraiding of
