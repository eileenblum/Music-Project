Trifling sum for flesh-trading
Is a poor excuse
For morality penetration
Once humans, today no-reason beasts
Finally Iâm done with the aggravant shroud
Always thinking
The father of all matters
We are lead tomorrow in the past
The easier your life shall be
But this is not my destiny
I absorb myself alive
Self-approach is the only exit for those
Which mind is specified as pathology
Sin is genetic
We cannot forget everything we faced
We are all the same
And I am similar to you
While I do not refuse from the idea
To defile our consienceness
Always thinking regarding tomorrow and past
Of the essentials
Father of methods
What a fucking sort of animal are you then?
Ready to rock through five or six decades
As a master of your own choice?
Or youâd like to choose decaying from the beginning
Under the pressure of consumers
Or societyâs moral norms?
There is no sense in hiding of our egoism
Subservinient similarity
Think and live now
Tomorrow may never arise
Children of the fatherâs mistakes
Grasping, heartless
Multyplying the guilt and deteriorate
We all are born with the right to life
But the only thing we could arrange
Is the place and the means of how shall we die
This is mutated virus
And youâre not the final evolution chain
Sin is genetic
Genetic origin of sin
