We live and die alone for the progress
There is no place out for the beast
Stare at world through the eyes of broken hope.
Wretched.
Â 
People we bear the same names
Torture their souls and variations of carnival masks
And a whore from a saint
Difference in the lost world of consumption
Because that day by the treat has been broken
No more gods, nor faith, nor god
This is it. Watch it. Hell.
Â 
Now you pray for setting free
But Iâll never let you up like the face of humanity
I watch your world apart
Who will disclose you from your dark?
Â 
Secure the damps please
We shall prepare this fatted biomass
The atropine wretched before
Â 
You take my fucking life and nothing stayed aside
But everything you've done in depths of pain you drown
Drown.
Â 
Taste the stench of life
Â 
Easily
Donât you fucking hear me, Goran?
Surgical intervention
I shall recommend the agony swollen
And youâre fucking dead.
Â 
So long you've been marking up this earth with filthy stamps
Immaculate - never dying, slowly, directly
Â 
THE LAST BREAK DOWN
Â 
I deny the human race
You will never walk before a god again
Trapped in cage of word, religion knows
A cancer that devours
Â 
Drown
The highest surgery
Abortion of the modern plague
This world is bleeding
Once again
