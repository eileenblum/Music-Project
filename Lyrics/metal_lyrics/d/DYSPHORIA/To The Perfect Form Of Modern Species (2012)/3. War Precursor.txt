Nothing in this wasteland left for life
Discovered hell
And let the slaves fulfill the endless jails
We hope you'll never feel the rest
And scent of death shall always follow you
Children shall remove their purity
My eyes still see
The heartbeat of an injured vanity
I am walking here
I'm alive, lethargic sleep won't prevail
And you're dead
Corruption is my grail
I condemn to failure humanity
Say goodbye to your extremities
I pray to devil for annihilation
The deception of the pure misery
Intellect is our private enemy
We slit our throats
With blood we ruined our world
Impaired humanity's function
Reveal the symptoms of disease
Enjoy your disability
Shall once replace you all
Proclaim fallen father
Why do have I sinned?
I shall be dead
No-failure machinery
Shall devastate you all
Don't you know how does it taste
To wallow in the vice?
My steps are silent and soft
Forsaken children will become precursor of fear
And it's all the same forever
Liar is tangible
Faded by reality's essay
Passing by highest seducer
When I saw your eyes fallen pleasently
When the poverty is set for you
Fade away. My soul is dead
Feeling is the same
Accept the fate and throw yourself in devil's charity
