I punctured my lungs
dont want to breathe
this poisoned air

I crippled myself
dont want to take
another step
on this poisoned ground

I burned I burned:. Once again
just to feel that I was alive

The flesh and the cage
are still the same
equal nothing

Cut the dotted line
do what you've been told
always and ever, obey
take the easiest route
never dare to thread
(another path)
always and ever
living in restriction

Still not satisfied
with it all
destined to tremble and fall
mankind loosing grip
only because the restrictions
