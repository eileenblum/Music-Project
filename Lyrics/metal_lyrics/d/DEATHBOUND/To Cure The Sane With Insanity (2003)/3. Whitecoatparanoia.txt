My walls are padded
stripped down I lie
the lights are on
whole day long
feel so sick
going blind
can't hurt myself
though so eager to bleed

These walls seem to bleed

I want to pound my head
against my knees
peel of my skin
or rip it off
my brain is crippled
can't feel a thing
smother me, under heavy weights

White coat paranoia
