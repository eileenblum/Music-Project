Fractured
but growing immensly
becoming
more than a man
ripping apart the core - the soil
manufacturing manslaughter

In the chambers of your beliefs
your children starve
there in the chambers of your beliefs
your god cries out

Do you as the insect you are
feel any regret
can you feel the neon worm
eat through your body

And god shall start to weep
in the chambers of the serpent
while serpents hiss
in the halls of the million dead
