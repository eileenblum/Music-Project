A sudden blow
couldn't defend yourself
a mindless attack
on defenseless prey
the chosen one
to take the suffering
a punch of reality
in your face

Gagged and bound
just one more victim
wrapped in plastic
counting the seconds
seconds turn into days
now feeling like weeks
no one cares
and you're still dead

Counting his kills
just one more victim
wrapped in plastic

Your head is one more trophy
on his concrete walls
the stench of your body
that disgusting smell
he ripped the flesh right through
