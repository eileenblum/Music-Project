The perfect world you seek
is just a decision away
to pull the trigger
or to carve the flesh to the bone

I will not try to help
nor to stop you
surrender to your faith
give up the false hope

Being nothing
life means nothing
wishing for everything
that you thought was real

This wont end
without sound or pain
no one will know
your end - the end

Find pleasure
underneath the skin
a newfound pleasure underneath the skin

The perfect world
just got blown away
where is your hope
where is your place
We are all but bone
And we're all scarred
