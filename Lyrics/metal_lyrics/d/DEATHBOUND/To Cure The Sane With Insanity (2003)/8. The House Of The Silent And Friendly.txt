"Skulls stripped of hair and skin
stashed on the shelves
-and in the fridge-

a pail full of hacked of hands
a torso in the kitchen sink
ripped open from the neck to groin

A jar containing a pickled penis
a severed penis lying on the sink
another severed penis in a lobster pot in the fridge
two 50 gallon garbage cans filled with rotting torsos"
