I want to throw myself
Off this stinking planet
Erase myself
From the population
Grasp onto something new
(I want to) remake the improved

To keep you alive
Just to fuck you again
My world this is why they need you
Lack of intelligence - Lack of instincts
Buried deep in the Christian heart
Lack of insight - Lack of comprehension
Bound down
Bound by god's almighty love

Allow me to leave
So I can come back again
Probably crawling on my knees
As human as it gets
So humane
And I hate it

To keep you alive
Just to fuck you again
My world this is why they need you
Lack of intelligence - Lack of instincts
Buried deep in the Christian heart
Lack of insight - Lack of comprehension
Bound down
Bound by god's almighty love

Allow me to leave
So I can come back again
Probably crawling on my knees
As human as it gets
As humane
And I hate it

They all will gather
And listen to the preaching
Forgetting everything else
And their brains at home

Sucking it in
And chewing every word
