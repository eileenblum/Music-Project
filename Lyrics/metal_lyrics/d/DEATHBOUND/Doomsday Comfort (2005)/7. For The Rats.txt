Won't burn though I'm drenched in gasoline
And the swarm is getting closer
Eat me alive and take my bones
As a trophy...as a trophy

Hang my family high
For the vultures to feed
All that I have
All that was me
Left it all for the rats
Left it all for the rats
Left it all for the rats

This is how it is
This was meant to be
This is how I went down
Supposed to be my end

Fuck!

For the rats!

Won't burn though I'm drenched in gasoline
And the swarm is getting closer
Eat me alive and take my bones
As a trophy...as a trophy

Hang my family high
For the vultures to feed
All that I have
All that was me
Left it all for the rats
Left it all for the rats
Left it all for the rats
Left it all for the rats
