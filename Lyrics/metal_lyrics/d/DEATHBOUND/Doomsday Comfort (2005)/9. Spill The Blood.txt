Spill the blood!

Breathe now while you still can
Get your well deserved rest
So many hours
Making this world a worse place to live
A worse place to live

Must make a man tired
Must make a man feel proud of himself
Must make a man tired
And all the work that he has done

Spill the blood one last time
Dare to watch it go
So many kills
Making more space for yourself to live in
For yourself to live in

Must make a man tired
You have to be proud of yourself
Must make a man tired
You have to be proud

Dare to watch them in the eye
Dare to shake their hands
Dare to say what you have caused
Put your life on fucking pause
