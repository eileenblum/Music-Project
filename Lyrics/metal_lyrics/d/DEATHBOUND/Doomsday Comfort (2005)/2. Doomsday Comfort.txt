Hide as you always do
Disguise into something new
Forget what you are
Ignorance will get you far

Unfair some would say
This life is here to stay

Deny as you always do
Regret nothing of your past
Forget what you are
This will get you far

Motionless and silent
Somehow it is soothing
Emotionless and brutal
Somehow it's more soothing

Deny as you always do
Regret nothing of your past
Forget what you are
This will get you far

Unfair some would say
This life is here to stay

Motionless and silent
Somehow it is soothing
Emotionless and brutal
Somehow it's more soothing
