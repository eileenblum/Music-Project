Can't keep the wolves out
Nor the sheep inside

Won't let the brain do the work
It might cause a riot

Extinct
We are extinct

Can't keep the hell down
Nor heaven free from clouds

Won't stop the free will
Nor the slaves who won't stand still

Extinct
We are extinct

A useless effort all in all
A mindless plan to use in this war
A sight to cause the inflict
To fight as long as we're extinct

Can't keep the wolves out
Nor the sheep inside

Won't let the brain do the work
It might cause a riot

Extinct
We are extinct

A useless effort all in all
A mindless plan to use in this war
A sight to cause the inflict
To fight as long as we're extinct

Extinct
We are extinct

A useless effort all in all
A mindless plan to use in this war
A sight to cause the inflict
To fight as long as we're extinct
