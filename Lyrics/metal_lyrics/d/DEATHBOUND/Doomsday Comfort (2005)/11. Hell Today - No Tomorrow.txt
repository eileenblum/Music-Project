I watch these figures pass me by
Wish they all were aflame
I watch these lives pass me by
It all seems so fucking fake

If they'd never read the rules
Would they have struggled as much?

I am passing by
I am losing faith
I am but a train
I have lost all faith

If hell was here today
Would they leave it all
And walk away?

I watch these figures pass me by
Wish they all were aflame
I watch these lives pass me by
It all seems so fucking fake

If hell was here today
Would they leave it all
And walk away?

...and walk away
