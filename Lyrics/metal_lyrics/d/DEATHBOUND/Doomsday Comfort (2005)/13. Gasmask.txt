Put your gasmask on!!!

Terror, suicide
Sweeping across this earth
Alone, you and I
Against this wretched kind

How long can we resist
The claws of this beast
The feeding shall begin
The bleeding from within

Unnatural it might be?
This serpent wants to be free
The slaves of your kind
Are more blind than the blind
Are more blind than the blind
Are more blind than the blind

Too much for my taste
Our lives, a fucking waste
Corrupt as I am
I, the genocidal man

How long can we resist
The claws of this beast
The feeding shall begin
The bleeding from within

Unnatural it might be?
This serpent wants to be free
The slaves of your kind
Are more blind than the blind
Are more blind than the blind
Are more blind than the blind
