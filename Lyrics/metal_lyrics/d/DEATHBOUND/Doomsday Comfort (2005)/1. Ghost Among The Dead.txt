A core as fragile as this
Not worth the fight
Not worth to miss

A hell as nice as this
Well worth the pain
I'm a slave for all of this

Unrecognisable
After all the years
Unchangeable
And living from their fears

Ghost among the living
Ghost among the dead
Lost the battle twice
Can't bring myself to an end

It is calm before the storm
It's a shame to be born
Or not to be born

Ghost among the living
Ghost among the dead
Lost the battle twice
Can't bring myself to an end

I ask you
Why leave this hell
Then I ask myself
Why the fuck did I leave

Unrecognisable
After all the years
Unchangeable
And living from their fears

Ghost among the living
Ghost among the dead
Lost the battle twice
Can't bring myself to an end
