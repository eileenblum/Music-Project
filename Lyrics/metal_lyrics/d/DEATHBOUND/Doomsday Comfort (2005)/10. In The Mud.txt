Come down with me
Come bark at the devil's tree
You'll see a lot
I'll show you more
I'll show you the bleeding whores

They're all crawling
In the mud I left them in
They're all singing in blood
In the blood I saw them in

To be and not to be seen
That's all my father taught me
To see and not to be seen
That's all my mother taught me

A killing frenzy is all I need
And to break all the chains that bind me
A killing frenzy is all I need
And to break all the chains

Come down with me
Come bark at the devil's tree
You'll see a lot
I'll show you more
I'll show you the bleeding whores

They're all crawling
In the mud I left them in
They're all singing in blood
In the blood I left them in

A killing frenzy is all I need
And to break all the chains that bind me
A killing frenzy is all I need
And to break all the chains

Why don't you...trust me?
Now tell me...why don't you trust me?!!!

So come and watch me
I live in cellblock three
I showed them all
I showed them all
I showed them all

A killing frenzy is all I need
And to break all the chains that bind me
A killing frenzy is all I need
And to break all the chains
