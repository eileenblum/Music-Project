Almost dead
But still struggling
Caught in the web
Trying to get free

This is not hell
It's all much worse
Man made heaven
And all is cursed

Nothing is
As it seems
Nothing is
As it reads

Took the easiest route
Strayed away from my path
Should've known this
Should've taken left

Forced to believe
You've bled on your knees
Forced to swallow
And you swallowed it whole

Nothing is
As it seems
Nothing is
As it reads

Took the easiest route
Strayed away from my path
Should've known this
Should've taken left

Forced to believe
You've bled on your knees
Forced to swallow
And you swallowed it whole

Almost dead
But still struggling
Caught in the web
Trying to get free

Nothing is
As it seems
Nothing is
As it reads
Nothing is
As it seems
Nothing is

Took the easiest route
Strayed away from my path
Should've known this
Should've taken left

Forced to believe
You've bled on your knees
Forced to swallow
And you swallowed it whole

Almost dead
But still struggling
Caught in the web
Trying to get free

This is not hell
It's all much worse
Man made heaven
And all is cursed
