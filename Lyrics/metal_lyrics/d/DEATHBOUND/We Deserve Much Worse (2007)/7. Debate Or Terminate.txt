[Music: Seikkula. Lyrics: Jaakkola]

Shut up! And silence the talker
He will terminate us all
Narrow minded zombie walker
Tactical strong words of war

We won't realize before it's too late
Lost our lives in a neverending debate
Swollen eyes see no future
Can't see the exit signs for the departure

Burn - this nation of oppressors
Lock - the doors for the successors
Find a scapegoat for everything
Just to satisfy the savage within

Rotten to the core are the ruthless
A stench so thick you can almost taste it

Shut up! And silence the talker
He will terminate us all
Narrow minded zombie walker
Tactical strong words of war

We won't realize before it's too late
Lost our lives in a neverending debate
Swollen eyes see no future
Can't see the exit signs for the departure

Burn - this nation of oppressors
Lock - the doors for the successors
Find a scapegoat for every goddamn thing
Just to satisfy the savage within

Rotten to the core are the ruthless
A stench so thick you can almost taste it
Those are the ones who will outlive us all
Safe in the bunker when the last bomb falls

Burn - this nation of oppressors
Lock - the doors for the successors
Hate - unites the modern nations
We - despise without hesitation
Hate - unites the modern nations
I am not part of this modern nation
