[Music: Latva. Lyrics: Jaakkola]

There's no time for repentance
And no time for tears

Time for acceptance
Your place is here
Unmerciful fate
It is your time

First in line
To pay for their crimes
High is the price
For being smart

Throw the dice
And end the guessing
Lay on your back
Pay for your revolt

The future is... here
Our future is... free
Just accept the fact
We won't be standing last

Throw the dice
And end the guessing
Lay on your back
Pay for your revolt

Dried out from blood
Dried out from all (and everything)
Sick and twisted
And you still want more
