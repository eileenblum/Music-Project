[Music: Seikkula. Lyrics: Jaakkola]

Open up the silverscreen
Cross your hands forget what you've seen
Like the other day
When all was fine you had nothing to complain
Like the other day
All was fine

Now you're just screaming
You seem to be awake yet you're dreaming

Preaching back to preachers
This is a oneway conversation
Preaching back to teachers
Double morals
Preaching back to teachers
Double morals (hidden) in the education
Preaching back to preachers
Oneway conversation

Now you're just screaming
You seem to be awake yet you're dreaming

Why waste your life being on your knees?
(It is beyond me)
