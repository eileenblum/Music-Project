[Music: Latva. Lyrics: Jaakkola]

I can not say - what's become of me
Nor is this anything - that is relevant
In this life - and beyond this hell
What I want - is to gain control

You decide
You will insist
You will turn
Against them all

I redefine - my everything
This is war - (you) know nothing
What is it worth - worth fighting for
System collapsed - you won round one

You sit on the side
You watch it burn
Burn to ashes and nothing more
There are faces
A million faces
Burnt to ashes

This is the mind - and how it works
To choose a side - since your birth and
Fight against - the weaker kind
What we need - is to die

You decide
You will insist
You will turn
Against them all

There are faces
A million faces
Burnt to ashes
