Can't compare me
We're not in the same boat
I'm not like you
I worship a different goat
I'm still here
You turned around
Can't blame your faliour
On temptations sound

Feeling desperate and you feel weak
Can't plan anything beyond this week

You can't crawl
Out of the haze
Can't rely on you
So much has faded
My friend beyond all hatred
Can't say I care
But I wish you would stay dead

Feeling desperate and you feel weak
Can't plan anything beyond this week
It's a disease, trapped in the maze
You feel lost and misplaced

Betrayal wears your face

Inside that flesh you're dead
Inside your veins the drugs flow
Despite the hearts slow
You keep on letting go

Feeling desperate and you feel weak
Can't play anything beyond this week
It's a disease, trapped in the maze
You feel lost and misplaced
