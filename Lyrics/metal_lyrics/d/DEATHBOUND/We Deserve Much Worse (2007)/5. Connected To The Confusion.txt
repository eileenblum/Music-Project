[Music: Seikkula. Lyrics: Jaakkola]

You master the art of confusion
You want this fear to continue
You want the world and nothing less
You got the means to make a real mess
You got the will to do what it takes

You like the fact that it's all in your hands
The ship will sink if they don't follow your demands
You give them a feel of power and fame
As long as they know who is master who is slave

Single handedly this would be impossible
As we all know the human heart is corruptable

You like the fact that it's all in your hands
The ship will sink if they don't follow your demands
You give them a feel of power and fame
As long as they know who is master who is slave

You master the art of confusion
You want this fear to continue
You want the world and nothing less
You got the means to make a real mess
You got the will to do what it takes
You got the will to do what it takes

Single handedly this would be impossible - you know
As we all know the human heart is corruptable - you grow
