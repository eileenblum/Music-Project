[Music: Latva. Lyrics: Jaakkola]

All hail this catastrophe
There is a war inside of me
If you want equality
Go burn your flags and set me free

Here come the casualties
With no will to break free

All hail the trickery
We're fooled again, it's so easy
Fenced in like a herd of cattle
Broken down and all battered

Like zombies staring through our windows
Watching the world as it blows

Design us again
New editions of the broken man
Lock us up again
Permanently the suffering man

Like zombies staring through our windows
Watching the world as it blows
Send the signal to horrify the masses
Tribal wars in suites and (cheap) sunglasses
