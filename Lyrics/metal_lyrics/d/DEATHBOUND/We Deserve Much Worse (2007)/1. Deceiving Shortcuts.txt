[Music: Seikkula. Lyrics: Jaakkola]

This is (your) denunciation
They laugh right in your face
Time to take a stand
And be a man

Can't take criticism
Can't take a look in the mirror
Can't stand failure
Can't sit still for (even) a minute

A must to progress
Must be better
A will for success
But getting deader

You haven't reached your goal
A complex plan with no soul
Inside you're dying
Shortcuts might be deceiving
