The shackles are just an illusion made by yourself
Still wallowing in despair and confusion
Can't get a grip of yourself
You cast no shadow cause you don't exist
You nameless one
Maybe you're the fortunate one
Selfmade hell
A hell you can't deny
Can't stop crying life cause life is misery
Can't stop laughing at others tragedy
Lonelyness hardens you
Sorrow is the trigger that makes you want to go through
These sterile hallways
...endless whire hallways
So easy to get lost here
And your demons are trapped underneath the paint
