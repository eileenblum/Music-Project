Continiung on the same path that lead us astray
The fault is none but ours
The falling plans of making things right
Will keep us small once and for all
Forget the blueprints
No way to achieve complete peace
Mankind is the sickness
We will always want more
To get ride of the problem?
Is to yet rid of yourself
This ratrace is everlasting
It goes on and on
