Save your prayers for god is not here
Left two days ago
He said he'll be back in a year
Lost his faith in you
Had to take some time to unwind
Corpses rotting
Man forgetting
Money talking
Drugs are ruling
Blood is spilling
Stupidity and corruption
Seas are boiling
Mountains crumbling
Birds are falling from the skies
Hate, fear, disgust
Paranoia, schizophrenia, ignorance
Madness taking over
