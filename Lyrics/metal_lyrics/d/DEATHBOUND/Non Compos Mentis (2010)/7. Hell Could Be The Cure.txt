Rise up from the sewers of hell
Climb up and take them to the underground
Decrease this sickened breed
Lowlife scumfucks is what we do need
Hell could be the cure
Cause madness doesn't work anymore
Insanity had it's moments
But faded too fast and had no impact
Deathbound in rusty chains
Endless is the journey to the grave
Decrease this sickened breed
Lowlife scumfucks is what we need
Fists hard as reality to bring these zombies to life
In a lifelong coma functioning without reason
Hard as nails they're stuck in limbo
Never changing just eating all in sight
