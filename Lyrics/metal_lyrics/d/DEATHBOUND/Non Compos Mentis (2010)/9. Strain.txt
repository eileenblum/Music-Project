I've drifted away from what you call living
Slepped back from the struggling you call life
Let all temptations take hold
Stopped reality to unfold
Much easier to watch you kill yourselves from way up here
Don't regret a thing i've done
It's so peaceful here
Can you feel the strain?
Cause i can't feel a thing
I don't miss it
Can you feel pain?
It's a feel i've lost
I don't miss it
