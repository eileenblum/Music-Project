I'll be your martyr and i'kk be your saint
I will be the one that you can blame
I'll take the bullets and i'll be crucified
With a smile on my face when i die
Put my face on top on the TV screen
Worship me fools
Come and worship me
Eternally i'm a reason for your fight
It is enough for me
I'm soaring in hights
I've hid my horus
Don't you feel the knife in your back?
Won't do a thing to help you through
Only thing is certain
I guide you to your doom
