Grey clouds are gathering on top of your head
You felt this coming days before
A run of bad luck you just might say
But i know it's much deeper than that
You've been bad
You've been stupid
You've been ignorant and goddamned useless
You've let it all go
You let your demons show
Hell comes for a visit
It's not a case of bad luck
Dark clouds been gathering all day
This doesn't come as a surprise
You feel cold shivers down your spine
It's about running out of luck
You've been cheating and stolen some
You've been foolish and realty fucked up
You've let it all go
You let your demons show
Death comes for a visit today
