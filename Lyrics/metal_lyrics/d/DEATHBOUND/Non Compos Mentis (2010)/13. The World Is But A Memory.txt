Swimming in the sea of flames
Nothing burns as bright
As holyness is put to flame
And all gods will die
The tide has turned
We're walking against the wind
Dreaming on the road to progress
Nothing leads that way
The signs have been taken down
And you are on your own
Can you hear the tune
That bitter sweet melody
That's all you'll have
When the world is but a memory
Now the walls are closing in on us
And we look a knife to a gunfight
It is nighttime for us
It is bedtime for mankind
This lullaby will kill
Such a goodtime so hush
