Don't hold you breath
And wait for the end, you might just die
Sleepwalk through life
Keep your eyes closed
Don't ask why
Don't hold your breath and wait for salvation
Cause he just won't feel like coming
Loosing is not an option and it might mean death
Focus on those little things that keep you sane
Just ride the wave... called misery
And try to stay alive
Don't hold your breath
And wait for salvation
Cause he just won't feel like coming
Carving - your name on the world and your flesh
Slowly but certainly
