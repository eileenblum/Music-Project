Feel like shit and the bottle is empty again
Intestines are on fire
And darkness creeping closer
Dead tired but sleep is miles away
Can't remember the last time i was sober
Nor the last time i got laid
This bed reeks of piss, shit and sweat
Can't move even if i wanted
All i can see are demons and death
Slowly passing his days
To have lost in so many ways
Lost it all
Nothing more to fuck up
The rest of living was high enough
