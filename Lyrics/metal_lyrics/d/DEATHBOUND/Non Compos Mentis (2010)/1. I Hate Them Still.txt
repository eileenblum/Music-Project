My mind grows old but memories remain
Can't turn the other cheek
Cause some deserve to die no matter what theu do
Too late to regret
Pounding i'm pounding your life away
Cutting and slicing
Cutting your days away
Carving and slicing your days away
The ones that hated me then
They don't hate me now
The ones i hated then
I hate them still today
We're equally dead
Nothing matters when we lie down below
Can't put a price on my death
When my times comes i'll disappear
I don't need a grave no one visits
