Do we need a great leap forward
To speed up the process of destruction
Do we need something to blow us off this planet
Push the red button if you think go
Oh yeah! We're all gonna die
This is the process of destruction
As sure as we are all going to die
This is what is needed
Raise your fist if you think so
The crawling beings that we are
Don't need a future cause it won't last
The fucked up beings that we are
We don't even learn from our own past
