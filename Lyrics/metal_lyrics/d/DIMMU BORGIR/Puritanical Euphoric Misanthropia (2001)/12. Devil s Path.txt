Thousand different paths
So many sterile ends
I chose the Devil's path

Never shall the sun kiss my face
And caress me with it's burning light
For I dwell in the shadows
And sleep side by side with death

In dark desire I embrace the whore
Giving her an escape from an unworthy life

For with the appearance of the Fallen Angel

[chorus:]
I serve Satan
I serve Darkness

I am a prince among the damned
As I've been for eternity
A monarch in a dark paradise
Cursed by life and the living

Oh tremble not my immortal heart
Though you beat in the shadows of death
Eternal life is the blessing
And I shall rule for another thousand years

I blew out the light
Abandoned Jesus Christ
Christian life forms' grief's
We buried their belief's

Waiting for their saviours rebirth
The dawn was soon to come
The dawn would soon be gone

There in that formless abyss was I made
A partaker of the mysteries averse
