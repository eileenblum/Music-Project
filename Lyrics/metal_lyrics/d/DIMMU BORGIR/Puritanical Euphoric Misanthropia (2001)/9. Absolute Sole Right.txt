As cyclones detach from the world above
And all the other worlds beneath them flow
Time winds caressing the dust of cold memories
Sought, to strive in twilight mist and penal fire

[chorus:]
As daylight suffers, night time recollects
For what wind hath drawn near, so near:

Death has a contract on life and hell in-between
What was once not certain is now foreseen

When the pendulum is in it's reverse factor
Rivers run red and skies turn black
Accuracies of bloodbaths liberate from within
Conquests of a crooked cross and its coming loss

A magisterial maintenance of diabolic education
Where the opposite of innocence paves way for intelligence
Where pearls are chained for each tragic event
The glorification of deviance in progress

Liars in wait tries to quench their thirst for more
Drowning victims of a parallel universe
The scum of the earth, a rejoice of fouls
The world hates you for being precise

[music: Silenoz and Shagrath]
