Annihilate!
The commotion breeding the perverse
For bloodbath is on your doorstep
A mass impending threat
The perfection of religion
Becoming our death

Do not respond blindly
To growing gardens in decay
Stand guard when visitors fall silent
Blow the candles out, end the road here

No solace will be found
Within elements of the tribe
When covered with filth from all sides
Compassion will fail

Their promises are honored
In a mind controlled state
The absence of reality, reason and logic
Prove failure of faith

Enriched by the presence of it's clarity
Darkness descends, everyone dies

[repeat 3rd and 4th verse]

For wisdom aligns in our favor
Illuminated before our eyes

Uncover!
A new beginning, the inevitable dawn
Justice will be given where justice is due
And guide the righteous ones
Back to the final resting ground
To perceive the truly hellbound

Demonstrate superiority
A grand gesture of liberation need no judge or jury
Demons rate inferiority
Scatter the remains of the prey

[repeat 2nd and 7th verse]
