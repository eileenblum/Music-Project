Devoted to your own opiate
In escapades from discontentment
Are you shutting off from the outside world
To reflect on your mind shallow gutter?

For this is your empire, this is your intrigue
Here you own them all, here you seal the deed

Contaminated from the spree of self salvation
To keep the fever flowing in the veins
Prominently manipulating heaven and hell
Does your sophistically discreet interlude
Maintain stories not to be revealed?

In your search for redemption
Greed and lies become the savior
Through the lecherous eyes disgust withstand
For are not these the windows to your soul?

Fatherly fornication of sweat lips in dismay
Repeatedly unlocking the vaults to the holocaust
The dormant prodigy seeks it's reason for rebirth
But it will never, never gain the strength

A surrender in superficial scorn
The rape of an ever unborn
Seeds have been planted in the name of the son
Until this day, ungodliness is yet to be gone

Sacramental suicide amidst the flow of virgin vine
The only way to comfort the defeat

[repeat 6th verse]

Regrets can no longer find it's ways
Streams of innocent bitter tears flowing down the drain
Mirrored in the haze of a partaker's eyes

[Music by Vortex/Galder/Shagrath]
