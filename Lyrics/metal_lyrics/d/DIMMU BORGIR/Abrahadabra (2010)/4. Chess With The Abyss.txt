Old dreams return
Disillusioned I yearn
Am I buried beneath sand and clay?
The caress of cold soil
With limbs crippled to the coil
Locked inside a nightmare womb

Tarnished and grief stricken
Emptiness within a void
Longing for the sun to shine
To discourage the demonoid

Salvation!
Darkness reborn!

We seem to keep fading away
Holding on to that last final sway
A doctrine of self salvation
Darkness reborn on resurrection day?

Stagnating in dead waters
While circling above the surface
Of the deep pale desert sea
Cutting that other life of lines

Salvation!
Wish we'd never met
Salvation!
And rather gone our separate ways
Salvation!
All times spent together
Salvation!
Are the darkest of days
Salvation!
Darkness reborn!
