Dare not to inflict upon my wishes
Dare not to obstruct upon my path
Dare not to pretend to lick my wounds
When all it means is opening another

Purity comes with rebirth
Reassigned through the slit
Spawned out of the shadows
The light is once again lit

False regrets
Deepest of despair
False visions
Reservoir of grief
False regrets
Whatever presence
False visions
That graced my spirit

Whiffs of clarity
And universal understanding
Come and go

I'm too young and too old
To continue this worthless fight
I've seen through the darkness
To understand the value of light

Though I seek validity
From the Ides of March
I watch the darkness
Open its jaws
Whatever presence
That graced my spirit
Is for whomever
I choose to inherit
