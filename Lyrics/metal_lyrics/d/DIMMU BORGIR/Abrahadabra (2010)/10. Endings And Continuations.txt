Ages of the past
Abrahadabra!
Forever to last

Enter the supreme unknown

From within the chambers
Comes expansion of thy own free will
From the outer rooms
Comes extensions of thy own free will

Through the confines of tomorrow
We reappear still
Timeless and elemental

From the ancient future
Comes the seamless and the endless
Ages of the past
Energies eternal
Forever to last

Seeing - Evolving
Willing - Achieving
Beyond the next worlds

Flee the cage of insecurity
Enter the supreme unknown
Expand the inn er and outer horizon
For it is as obvious as it is shown
