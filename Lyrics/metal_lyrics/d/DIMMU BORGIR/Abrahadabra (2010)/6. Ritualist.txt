Shedding the old skin
Procreating new sin
Incubation and isolation
A new storm is brewing

Ritualist!
Shedding the old skin
Ritualist!
Procreating new sin
Ritualist!
Incubation and isolation
Ritualist!
A new storm is brewing

Away with obstacles to progress
Those deficient in ambition to prosperity
Yearning but what already is gone
The remains digress
And start anew

Ritualist!
Aligned with the continuum
Ritualist!
Expanding the source at hand

Aligned with the continuum
Expanding the source at hand
Altering the past and the present
The future changes the chain of command

Transfusion of new blood
Congregation of the true blood
With no chains attached
We're letting the past rest
And things will never quite be the same

Transfusion of new blood
Mobilization of true blood
What' s leaving is already left behind
What's leaving is already left behind

With no chains attached
We're letting the past rest
Things will never quite be the same
When we are in charge of the game

Dispatching the chained ones
While being watched by the eyes of time
Everything is clearer now
The search is on for the next horizon

Ritualist!
Moving forward with silence and rapid pace
Ritualist!
Since the horror dawned upon our immediate race
Ritualist!
The veil has once again been extracted
Ritualist!
From the mist that dimmed our eyes
