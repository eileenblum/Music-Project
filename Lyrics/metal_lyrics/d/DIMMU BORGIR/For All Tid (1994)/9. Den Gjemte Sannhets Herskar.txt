Langt...der borte i morket
Gjennom tretopper der manelys driver
Langt...der borte i all take
Inn gjennom min sjel den sorte angst river

Pa de mosegrodde steiner de seg viser
Nar nattemorket har senket seg over
Ekkoene...fra deres grufulle jamring
Endelost: du kan hore

I horisonten langt vekk
Skimtes den sigende skodde
Horder av ild rider manelyset i flokk
Ved daggry de samles ved en bortgjemt odde

Den iskalde snoen
Har kommet
Denne gang
I evig fokk
