Langt...der borte i mÃ¸rket
Gjennom tretopper der mÃ¥nelys driver
Langt...der borte i all tÃ¥ke
Inn gjennom min sjel den sorte angst river

PÃ¥ de mosegrodde steiner de seg viser
NÃ¥r nattemÃ¸rket har senket seg over
Ekkoene...fra deres grufulle jamring
EndelÃ¸st...du kan hÃ¸re

I horisonten langt vekk
Skimtes den sigende skÃ¥dde
Horder av ild rider mÃ¥nelyset i flokk
Ved daggry de samles ved en bortgjemt Ã¥dde

Den iskalde snÃ¸en
Har kommet
Denne gang
I evig fokk

[English translation:]

Raabjorn Reflect Ghost Ship's Mist

Long... there away in darkness
Through treetops there moonlight shines
Long... there away in all mist
Inside my soul the black anxiety tears

On the moss-grown stones they show themselves
When night-darkness has fallen
Echoes... from their horror-full moanings
Endless... you can hear

In the horizon far away
Is glimpsed the talking mist
Hordes of fire ride in a flock
By daybreak they gather by a hidden-away headland

The ice-cold snow
Has come
This time
In everlasting snowfall

[Alternative English translation:]

RaabjÃ¸rn Reflects The Mists Of Draugheim

Way over there in the darkness
Through treetops where moonlight glides
Way over there in masses of fog
In through my soul the dark angst rends

On stones covered in moss they show themselves
When the dark of night covers over
The echoes from their horrid screams
Endlessly you may hear

Far away in the horizon
Apears a gliding mist
(like) hordes of fire the moonlight rides in throng
By dawn they gather by a hidden cape

The chilling snow
Has arived
This time
In eternal blizzard
