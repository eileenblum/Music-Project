[European bonus track]

From who or what have I
Received this gift?
For what purpose do I
Seduce this craft?

I know these answers
Lie hidden beyond
The powers that be
The power that is me

I will continue to decipher
And make it easier for you
Behold! Let it be told

Try and understand
That all and everything
Which I have done
I have done for you

I will continue to decipher
And make it easier for you
Behold! Let it be told
What is fiction and untrue

I will not leave you behind
With the burdens of belief
And divine misery
That means restless grief

For it is written
The times of old will come anew
And have the universe reversed to its origin
When the ancient winds blew
