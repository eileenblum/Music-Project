[North American Bonus Track]

Vengeance is mine
Neither sweet nor kind
Vengeance is mine

No longer am I held responsible
For the error of your ways

My conscience
Stand defiantly proud and rigid
So take my advice

Meet your opposition
Profane and disciplined
Take back your pride
With a pounding hammer

No longer am I held responsible
For the error of your ways

My conscience
Stand defiantly proud and rigid
So take my advice

As long as my icon has flesh
No one puts me to the test
And as long as my spirit permits
There will be no fucking rest

Vengeance is mine
Neither sweet nor kind
Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine

I owe you nothing
But scorn and contempt
From all that is holy
I will have my revenge

Vengeance is mine
No longer am I held responsible
For the error of your ways

My conscience
Stand defiantly proud and rigid
So take my advice

As long as my icon has flesh
No one puts me to the test
And as long as my spirit permits
There will be no fucking rest

With wisdom and fate
I design darkness
You keep feeding me denial and hate
And from that I will create

Arrogance and deception
Torment and bliss
How I envy your lack justification
When mine is so sincered
