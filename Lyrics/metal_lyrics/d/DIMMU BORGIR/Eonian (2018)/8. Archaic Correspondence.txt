Dead at nothing
Alive at everything
You travel time
And time travels you
As within so without
As above so below

When we set sail
Energy is our procession
The journey inward repeats
The horizon is our destination

Life is the trial
And the passage is death
Storming through oblivion
Life is a trial
And the passage is death
Storming through the veil

The transition from internal life
Repressed and unseen
Forgotten
Lurking in the shadow of your mind
Losing yourself is the key
To leave everything behind
Losing yourself is the key
The shadows become our past

The migration of the soul
Picks up where it leaves the flesh
And enters the finish line
Sustained through another time

Life is the trial
And the passage is death
Storming through oblivion
Life is a trial
And the passage is death
Storming through the veil

As within so without
As above so below
