Become through earned
And granted liberation
Rise above the secrecy
And silent deception

Clarity is determined
At the depths of murky waters
The potion of black earthed blood
Is the sludge draining the conscious

Essential learning
Corrupted and drifted
In this deceiving world
The modern savant has ignored the soul

Expose the dreamworld
We all believe to be real
Forgotten, forbidden
All the knowledge that is hidden

In the shadows
Our eyes are blind with confusion
The curtains hide the present
Leaving only rays of disillusion

Expose the dreamworld
We all believe to be real
Forgotten, forbidden
All the knowledge that is hidden
