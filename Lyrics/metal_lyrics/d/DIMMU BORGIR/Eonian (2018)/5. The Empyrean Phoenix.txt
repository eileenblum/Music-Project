Legionnaires of degradation
Ridden with disease
Disguised as martyrs
Preaching counterfeit peace

Unbound, glory forever untouched
Unbound, from its inception
To its final round

Through the tunnels
Darkness dims the vision
Yet, the light is kept guarded
Secretly

Unbound, glory forever untouched
Unbound, from its inception
To its final round

Risen anew from its humiliation
The fire has been awoken

The crossroads many
The highways few
Through desert storms it flew
The spirit of the phoenix wins
Restored anew

Unbound, glory forever untouched
Unbound, from its inception
To its last final round
