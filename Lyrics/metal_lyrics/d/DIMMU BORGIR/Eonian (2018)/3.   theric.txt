The word that has been spoken
Through time and time again
Is the light that inhabits our voice
The light that keeps us aflame

All retrospection is invalid
As we've been fed disdain
Confined to the fence of knowledge
We need to die, die again

To govern thyself
You must know your darkness
To govern thyself
You must know your past

All rise and fall
All is internal
All eternal
All rise and fall

Controlling matter with will
We withstand every storm
In and out of exile
Spirit, matter and form

To govern thyself
You must know your darkness
To govern thyself
You must know your past
