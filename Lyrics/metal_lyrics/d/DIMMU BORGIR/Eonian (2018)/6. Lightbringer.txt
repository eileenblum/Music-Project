Discover with courage
While facing the beyond
Uncompromisingly
Everything connects
As you detach

Truth foretold
Truth discovered
Truth always known

All growth comes at a cost
Moving forward means sacrifice
Enduring all paths crossed

Lucifer Lux Lucifer

The shadow is your dragon
Making the darkness conscious
Your wings open wide
Old souls becoming of age

Prosperity comes with a price
All growth comes at a cost
Moving forward means sacrifice
Enduring all paths crossed

Truth foretold
Truth discovered
Truth always known

The secrets of existence
Everything's within reach
The beginning is near
The end never draws fear

Lucifer Lux Lucifer
