By the light of the moon
And the beeings of the night
A curse has been laid upon us
To seek and tear celestial gloss to pieces

By the power of death
And the shadow of the reaper
A call has been brought upon us
To complete the infinite fall of heaven

Without the wit or will to end this journey
We continue travelling towards our faith
Harvesting helpless Christian spirits
Raping the sanctity of saints

The heavenly father is streching his hand
Pathetically begging for mercy
We spit and piss on his sacred flesh
As we breathe the breath of the unholy

For with the sign of the pentagram
Hellfire rage is for us to come
As we shall wander the pit

Uhallowed by the infernal one
We are forever captured
By the embrace of death
