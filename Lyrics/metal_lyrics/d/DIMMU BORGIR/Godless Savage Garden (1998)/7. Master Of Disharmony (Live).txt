Master of disharmony
welcome my tained soul
Take me from the hordes of the living
into the blessed darkness
Master of disorder
take my impure flesh
Lead me unto the path of temptation
save me from the cowardness

Save me from the cawardness

Master of sin
take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
for I am the damned

Master of death
take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain

Master of sin
take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
for I am the damned

Master of death
take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain
