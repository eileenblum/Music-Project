In perplexed dementia, where sanity is my vanity
With honour bear the mark of Satan
Triumphant beast in heaven defeat
Disguised in gloom, wear the mask of Satan

Ride the beast through paradise
Still vipers these mortal burdens
We arise as the portals take form
I leave my feathers again

Infidels and scarecrows all fallen from heaven
Captured by the sin of the beast
Mesmerized in total chaos
Engulfed in an overflow of selfish might

Swept through arcane mysteries
Forlorn in a maze of torment
Raped by the sanctity of the unholy
Reveals a Hell I never dreamed of

Bewildered by the arcane lifeforce mysteria-
I shed my skin once again

[lyrics:Nagash/Silenoz/Shagrath]
