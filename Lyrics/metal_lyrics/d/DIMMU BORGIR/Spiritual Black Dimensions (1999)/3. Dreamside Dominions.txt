When the ghastly mourners awakens from sleep
And the volant funeral crows are watching
Like evil omens in shadowed murmur
They welcome me again

Agonized and flattered to once become
A part of this horror scenario
I descend with arms open wide

Armoured and filled with painful pleasure
Reflecting streams of monstrous mirages
I will not hide

Losing control in seductive madness
Spiritual revelations, apocalyptic hypnosis
Dead colours appear within unshallow graves
Alone in awe I face abhorrence below

Trapped inside to suffer in silence
Torn apart in mind and sense
Baptized in this nightly glamour-
Rites of splendid essence

Agonized and flattered I once became
A part of the horror scenario
Armoured and filled with painful pleasure
I did not hide

Now when the gates are no longer shut
I withdraw from the light of the sun

[lyrics: Silenoz]
