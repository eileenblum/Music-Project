Unfolding her carnal desires to me
With tempting eyes she does receive
A hunter of the night devil's whore
May her cursed beauty haunt me forever

We embrace the madness gathered as one
Mourning dead passion...she comes to me
A fate awaits us in the night
In the ruins of creation we will unite

Unfolding her carnal desires to me
With tempting eyes she does receive
A hunter of the night devil's whore
May her cursed beauty haunt me forever

She comes to me - a shining beacon
Confused by the sensual innovation
Passion ... towards the image of mortal evil
Passion ... embraced by the image of united death

The enigma lies broken
Searching for those precious moments
Reaching for a higher state of existence
Like a newborn migrant in the void

I am smitten by the forbidden fruit
Possessed by moments of dark splendour
To walk the nightmare terrains forever
The enigma lies broken

Possessed by moments of dark splendour
To walk the nightmare terrains forever
United with new unhallowed grace
This cursed beauty haunts me forever

[lyrics:Nagash]
