In massing darkness we stand united
Raging above inferior sheeps
A convoy of souls swept into the night
Hearts strengthened with black fire passion
In us is fulfilled the prophecy of satan
Evolution of the inner shrine
In us is mantained the revelation of satan
Innocence brought to an end
In honour of thy unearthly creation
We bring forth thy divine form
Vanity throughout any conceptions
Blazed and bound for the days are coming
Infernal madness,unholy ascendance
Christian death abound in mouring perversion
Cherished sacred icons torn to pieces
They'll chase the serpent in everlasting nightmare
Disharmonic illusions of strings bending loose
Wrapped,penetrating skin
Listen to the music of their agony
Eyes made of glass,mirrors within
