Futile strikes, each for the rights
Proving a point for what we all fear
Deliver a gift, through air it shifts
Defeating the purpose and what we all hear
Ripping away, washing decay
Determines the future and what's to be done
Paving the path for a fragrant bloodbath
Smelling the death in what we've begun

Forming the hatred in shades of melting flesh
Destined for torture are those who could survive
Scanning the ruins, watching for signs of life
Befriend the reaper, for he is on your side

Casting them down on to the ground
Meeting the town. Bodies around

Destroying lives
Tearing the mothers from their child's arms
Nothing to last. Take a look around
What you enjoy most - gone forever

Holy man - question my religion
Kill my people for not wanting your God
Millions are dying while praying to live
So why should we look to the lies?

Bending our souls. Conform to your beliefs

They'll shoot you down then burn your home
If you do not see the light
Rules to protect the weak, to destroy the strong
And condemn all those that think

Why must we bow down throughout these times
When your light turns to darkness

Fire. Escaping the hand of god
Pages of unspoken guides
Lies, lies, lies. Die inside

Live our lives in fear of the ones we trust
And we wash away in our sea of doubt
Stop spreading faith while I start to sketch
A PAINTING OF WINTER'S DARKNESS

Banish thee - Worthless preacher

Blocking you out. Out of our minds
In to the grave. Deeper with time

Draw the line For you and your kind
Say what you bring to us
Things we cannot trust
You defend all you cannot see
Then you condemn all we want to believe
Book of fiction. Your contradiction
Premonition. False religion
Stealing hopes and visions from the youthful
Descend down the staircase to our fate

Winding path. Troubled past

Friends of Jesus Christ
Savior of all your minds
Hypnotized. Dictate lives

Paint has now been dried
As the stained blood of all who's died
In your wars of hate

Hang this painting high
As we wait to see the end of life
On Earth as we know it

Drill in to your brain
Hopes gone down the drain
Pointing all the blame
It will never be the same...
