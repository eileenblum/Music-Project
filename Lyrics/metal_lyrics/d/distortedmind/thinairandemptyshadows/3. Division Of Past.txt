The tears, dripping from eyes,
The pain, consuming lies,
The life I lead just to please you

DIVISION OF the PAST,
Your hopes shall never last,
You view me in a light that's not meant for me

The person I've become,
Far from what you want,
It's time to leave my life to me

Not good enough,
Not living up,
To your standards

The person you think I really am,
Is nothing close to the truth at all,
You think you know what's best for me,
But I'm better off if you let me fall

Why can't you see you're holding me back,
Can't move on with life if you don't let me

My only solace is in waiting to be free,
To rid of the past, creating me,
In finding what it means to be,
Having an identity

No more dreams of black,
No more depression,
No more monarchy,
Awaken by the light

Separation from the world at hand,
Moving on with my life's plan,
Expression of the mind,
A result of free will

No more giving in,
No more feeding lies,
No more molding me,
Into what i am

All that you put me through,
Nothing gained from it

All of your rotten ways,
I will forget

Time that you wasted,
Never coming back

Taking control of life,
Getting back on track

DIVISION OF the PAST,
Your hopes shall never last,
You view me in a light that's not meant for me

The person I've become,
Far from what you want,
It's time to leave my life to me

Not good enough,
Not living up,
To your standards

Life is not worth living in the past,
That's why I want to forget,
Choosing my own path to walk,
And never turning back
