When I scattered the pieces to father
Darkness was falling rapidly
Down beyond the hills
Waiting for the knowledge of immortality

Strange contact of a creator unknown
Allowances for the usual exaggeration
Long limbs grew rigid
In the most evil reputation

I reacted to the touch of the crucifix
I struggled and blasphemed
In my morbid state of mind
Wishing it remained

I seek distraction in the social life of the chapel
Half tearful and half defiant
The chapel rotten and alive with maggots
Illegal entry is denied
