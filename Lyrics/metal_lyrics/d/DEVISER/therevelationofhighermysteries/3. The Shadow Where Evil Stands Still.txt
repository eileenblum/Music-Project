The walls of an ancient stone chamber
Had witnessed many fearsome rites
The whole place reeked of evil
An intense bitterness surged through your mind

They perform an involved magical ceremony
To heal the wounds at the far end of the crypts
The curtains embroidered with the goat of Mendes
And the woman with the seven breasts

Upon the altar slab
The chalice and the book still reposed
The broken crucifix badly nailed
To retrieve some malignant unseen force

The terror inspired by the loathsome horrors
Of the pit would make you pale
For such Satan could drive men mad
Or strike them dead
As had proved the case with Crowley and Manson
