Those who attend respectable spiritualist
Many can be easily intrigued by a promise
The obtaining of power
For the real secrets

Starts like a rather intriguing affair
The thin end of the wedge
Promised revelations of higher mysteries
Hypnotized and dominated

A few ones survive to achieve the rank
And used only for obscenities
They soon degenerate into physical
And moral wrecks

Many of them end up as suicides
And all those who are rescued
Always prove useless...
