She was walking to the chosen place
Where the mass would be celebrated
Where the way would be opened
May eve

She wore a simple white gown
She walked through a dark forest
She could smell rotting mold
And wet wood

Her cunt tingled with electricity
Her belly and thighs glowed
Her legs wantonly wide
In the flickering torchlight

Shy glows red
Through budding branches
Evening is coming on
May eve
