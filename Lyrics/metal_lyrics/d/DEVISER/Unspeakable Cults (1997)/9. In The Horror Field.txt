A gust of wind flattening the tall grass
The noise around rose to a roar
As something gripped me around the waist
Pressing me until my ribs cracked
And a cold clast of air whispered...

Goddess of night
Lead me to your pleasuredome
Of debauchery
Where sunlight turns to darkness
Where the sun loses its power
And the wind changes

Bringing the icy currents down
Oh Hecate, rape me with malice
On the snow on top of the mountains

On my knees I pray
As the stars black out
And the forest shines under the moonlight
In a place where our love can be found
