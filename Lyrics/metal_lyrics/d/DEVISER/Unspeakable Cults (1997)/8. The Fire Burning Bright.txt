Lays on her back on a stone table
May eve of Walpurgis night
An obscene convocation Sabbat
With the power of moonlight

The figures contorting themselves
Some of them wear grotesque headdresses
Draped with the hides of animals
Still worship the mighty races

Degraded below the level of the beasts
Become the vessel for demonic forces
