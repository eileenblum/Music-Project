Battening on the fruits of evil
Abjure the ancient crypt of master
Forswear Satan now
Relying for all eternity

Lights flickered
And wisps of smoke curled up
Voodoo drums, horrid laughter
Recite the lords prayer

I sign a pact making myself
Over to him
Deny the Christian god and leave me
Free to fight

Bats squeaked and pigs grunted
Tongues of flame, betray the master
Snarling pandemonium
For those who are not prepared to serve

As light penetrates the semi-darkness
And the sound of chains are beyond all nightmares
Oh lord, defend us
To remain engraved upon all memories
