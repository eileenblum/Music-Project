An ungainly bird struggling
Light pouring from all windows
No warmth, no love
Leading deeper into the damp woods

To someone who could be spoken of only as
The dark man
The black goat

The execution of the sentence
In the ancient crypt of Abel Hopkins
Dressed in a hideous mask
And a coarse animal skin
Delicacy and tenderness
Sledgehammer
Wish to die
On the crude altar in the woods
Choking on thy own vomit
Yog-Sothoth
