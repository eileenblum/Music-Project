Walks at night and follows the dark
Showed signs of eagerness to come
(kindled) The flames of an anger equally beastlike
Gone temporarily insane

A pair of fantastic incidents
Occured in my flight
Incidents of no significance
Satyr, Hail!

Stampede and terrified animal
The fear-stricken beast which lies beneath 'us all
Demoniac in hideousness
Satyr, Hail!
