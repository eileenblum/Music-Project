Strange beliefs in a sharp and frosty air
An impulse of fear possesses me
Hysterical screaming cries so shocking
I lay on the ground hands over my eyes

When the wind is howling
Freezing night - Hades beating
A crash like thunder
Angels upon me

A pale moon casts some slight illumination
On the dismal scene
The gate opens at my touch
A stream of nightmares descend the path

I'm alone - no signs
Nothing that reveals the cause of my insanity

I'm obsessed - dangerously obsessed
A rebirth in utter blasphemy
Testimony to be believed
Black, shiny black...
