Stars seemingly visible in the sky
So dark by late afternoon
Armed with a script for tranquilizers
On frequences of chaos and squalor

A storm was imminent
Scenes of a dream drama

Shivering in the stillness
Upon a row of curbside trees
Sensitive to a certain kind of portentous mood
Were the little leaves

A whole galaxy of constellations
Contributing their light
Like eyes, shining in the white darkness
Frozen in endless infinity
