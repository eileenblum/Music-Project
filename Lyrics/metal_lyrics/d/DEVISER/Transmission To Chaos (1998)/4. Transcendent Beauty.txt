The edge of the moorlands
Purple sea of heath

From somewhere on the horizon
There poured a shaft of flaring light
Crimson and malefic
Transcedent beauty

There were vague flickerings of an inner fire
Ito an alien dimension
Which shines so strangely in the dimness of light
The twisting fabric of space and time

Sniffing the night air
Dowsing for darkness
Howling in appaling manner
And rushed in a wolflike transport of anger
