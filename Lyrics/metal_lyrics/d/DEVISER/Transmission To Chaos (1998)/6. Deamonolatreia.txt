The knowledge has been life long
Make it ligitimate in the eyes of the almighty
New prophecies and new flesh
Rent the fabric of reality

Fly on the wings of a raven
Let my love fly to you on swift wings
You and I are true spirits
Beyond time and space

My blackest love like the night
Skin like alabaster
Reflecting the stars of the universe
The promise of more than earthly joys

Mutual oaths of pleasure and pain
Learn the secrets of ecstacy
The blessed warmth of the womb
Polymorphous perversity

Eternal is my promise
And the promise is fulfilment
Forever and through endless changing
... Deamonilatreia
