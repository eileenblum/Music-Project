As the gold of the sky lighten the green of the hills
Distincly floated the tinkle of a bell
Of those who dwell in the Abyss
Across the clear mountain air

Tales of dancing lights in the dark of the moon

Misty dreams of shrill sounds
Sunless secrets and picture sights

The shadowy moving forms into the wide plain
Airy beings in white under the fullmoon
Ancient and solemn ceremonial dance
Fantastic formations beyond the pale of nature

Misty dreams of shrill sounds
Sunless secrets and picture sights
