My gate will transport you
Into another world
Far away from the reality
Where you come to feel insane delight

The key to enter through the gateway
Into those realms beyond
Taking you from the sane
Into an eldritch primal world

Sounds from beyond
Where rules the crawling chaos
A swirling of colours
That belong to unknown spectrums

The beginning of an immence passage
Through the endless gulfs of space
Drug-induced deleriums
Unearthly spirits
... Reality
