Crawling under the fullmoon
Blotting out the stars
Drown the rasp of a breath
Gasping and sobbing on the wet grass

My eyes burned with a hellish glow
Heart pounded beyond desire
Drown the thunder of a heartbeat
In tune with the infinite

Expose yourself and jerking on a suburban lawn
A wretched degenerate
Unlock the cageful of insane desires
And wipe the blood from my lips

Dreading seperation
Like captive serpent
The red wings of a butterfly
Are leaving below and bleed to death
