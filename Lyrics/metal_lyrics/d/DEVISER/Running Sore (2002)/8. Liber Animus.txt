On a journey into the sea of consciousness
Into its volume and into its depths
Awakening spiritual realisation of divine forces
Of inner power and strength
Standing in beautiful sandy cove
With high rocks and cliffs
The kingdom of the heavenly realm
Of seven immense energy fields
The vision of the seven spirits
Seven flames of fire burning
Singing under the moonlight
And blowing wisps of swirling
The lap of the black sea upon the golden sand
The whisper of the breeze in the palm trees beyond
The golden light, a reflection of the moon
Dark upon the waters
Follow me down through the unlight-filled depths of this ocean to the sea-bed
As we descend we submerge ourselves in the deep unconscious
Full of illusions, full of discovers
Full of illusions
Of beauties and treasures
