Like the formless fears of nightmare
The cold stars gleamed down
Under the slim horns of a crescent moon
Wave a magic wand and bring order out of chaos
Sakkuth the king - Sakkuth, king of night
The star-god
Cursed by the ancient prophets
Worshipped by sorcerers
And savages and demons
The seed of Kaiwan, the star-god
Descended from the sky
Long before mankind arose
From the starry voids
From the dark planet which circles the goat-star
For countless aeons
Served by countless demon-spawn
And waiting to spawn again
Before dawn
When the eye of Taurus and the Goat star are rising
Open the gate to Harag-Kolath
And perform the rite
Open the gate to thy world
Great mother
Witness this rite to the glory
The gate to other realms
