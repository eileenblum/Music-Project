Crossover into another world
A world beyond ordinary experience
Where the pale wash of starlight threw shadows
Beyond both ends of the known visible spectrum
This is a new beginning
In the mysterious world beyond mortal eyes
The next dimension of living
From the invisible realms of life
Death is the end of one phase of life
And the beginning of another
All pain and sorrow are gone
Astral travel, journeys in the levitation
Hold me close in your thoughts
For one last embrace
There are cycles to be completed
Help me rise
