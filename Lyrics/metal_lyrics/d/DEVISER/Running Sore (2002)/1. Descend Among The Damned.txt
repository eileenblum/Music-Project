I see ghosts dancing
On burning ice
Speechless and motionless
The realm of longing
Tear all crosses from their stalks
Nothing to be seen
I rise and smile at the ascending moon
Greenish cold blackened lake
Like an eye
Staring up into the sky
The lake just begins to freeze
The woods were like a poisonous spring
For pagans who danced around the fire
Like wicked dark creatures
All through the night it raged
Those hellish festivities
Descend among the damned
Bring fiends all over hell
Still alive but never to die again
Never ever to sleep
