As my blood drips from my heavy heart,
I yearn for that second start.
The seasons are unchanging,
How can it be?

[Chorus:]
Now I cannot see,
Cannot feel anything, anymore,
Now I've lost it all.
Oh how can it be?
How can I see anything, anymore,
At the end of it all?

Please forgive my undiscerning,
Questioning my yearning,
I was the transgressor,
Please hold me together,

[Chorus]
