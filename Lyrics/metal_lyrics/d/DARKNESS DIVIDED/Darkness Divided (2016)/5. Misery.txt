I've seen things,
I thought I could only dream,
I've read the book,
But I'm surrounded by misery.
Imperfect, yet inspired,
Life in the cracks,
Contradicting humanity.

I can't comprehend,
This twisted reality,
There has to be,
Substance in inconsistency,
Weaving time and reality,
Is faith the only thing holding up my belief?
In the darkness my eyes show me,
There is so much more that I can't see,
How defined can I be?
My fate is dependence fueled by needs,

Who will you help?
When the whole world bleeds,
How will you help?
When your whole world bleeds.

Oh Misery, why have you left me questioning,
My existence,
Father will You come and show us,
How to live again?

My lack of vitality,
Affirms my humanity,
I boast not of my sufficiency,
But to demand of Your authority,

Is this the point for everything that I'm feeling,
Is compassion supposed to drive my yearning?
The love You put on my heart,
Wasn't just mine from the start,
We were cut from the vine,
Pruned to be Your congregation.

[Chorus]

Every inch of my being questions,
How to repay,
The agony the laceration,
That cured my Misery.
My Misery.
