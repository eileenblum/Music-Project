I've been walking the line,
Following a life that binds,
You taught me freedom comes,
When you release conviction,
Commands to live a life,
Never learning what's inside,
I've been saved by birthright.

[Chorus:]
Quit pretending,
To understand me,
Doubt has consumed me,
I can't escape it.

I've been walking the line,
Following a life that binds,
You taught me freedom comes,
When you release conviction,
Commands to live a life,
Never learning what's inside,
I've been saved by birthright.

[Chorus]

I am starting to question why,
They say believe just because they know it's right,
Pick up your head and don't bother asking why,
I will not be convinced this time.
Give me a chance to question what is right,
Will blind obedience accommodate,
A soul that never knew the gates?
I've been saved by birthright.

[Chorus]
