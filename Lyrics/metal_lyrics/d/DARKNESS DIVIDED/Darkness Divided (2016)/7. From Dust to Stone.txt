Gaps filled with trusting,
A mind with no holes,
A heart engulfing,
The depths of my soul,
I searched the world that gave me no gifts,
I walked to the very end of my bliss,

And even vacancy denies my name,
My name,
And decency begins to fade away,
Away

[Chorus:]
Every essence of my being,
Leaves me questioning,
Who I'm meant to be,
Who I'm meant to be.

Corrupted society,
Breeding false propriety,
Popularity breeds promiscuity,
I can't buy back ignorance that I lack.

And even vacancy denies my name,
My name,
And decency begins to fade away,
Away

[Chorus]

Teach me to be a man,
Who doesn't need to understand,
Every fabric of my being,
Is this what it's like,
To end uncertainty,
Is this how it feels?

[Chorus]
