My heart breaks in the wake of the end,
The decay of flesh with no time to lend,
Years of endless trying,
Years of tithing for what's worthless,
With no purpose.

[Chorus:]
Where will I go,
When there's no hope at all,
And I am numb to breathing?

I look around at the world,
Conflicted by what I see,
Everything I lived for,
Is failing to birth growth,
Spinning to death,
I see him wait,
With his scythe at his side,
Spinning to death,
Relief will rise at it kills me,

[Chorus]

Where do I go when there's no hope?
Where do we go?
Where do I go when I am numb?
Where do we go?
