I am weak,
Omni potency,
A dream, unachieved by mankind's means,
The essence of your consistency,
Hold you from what you'll achieve.
I'm not the answer to earth's urgencies,

You can't pray to me,
You can't pray to me.
I am not the answer,

[Chorus:]
You are what I cannot be,
The answer to everything,
All that I need,

I am weak,
My infatuation,
Started at creation,
Soon after I was lost in the separation,
When I was the mirror of desperation.

You are what I cannot be.

[Chorus]

The only thing,
I could possibly need,
Is more,
The only hands,
That could hold up my feet,
Are Yours

[Chorus]
