I lived under the tree of life,
Feeding off whatever is left,
After the kings have feast,
Ignoring my every need.
The first will be the last,
But this strain will break my back,
The strings I pull are getting shorter,
And the flame is getting warmer.

What if You're nothing,
And I've been deceived by trusting,

[Chorus:]
Show me to believe,
Because life will claim,
All that I've ever known.

Everyday I've raised the sword,
To separate everything you left ignored.
With the words in my hand,
And the faith in my heart,
I've seen the sword rip existence apart.
Judgment burns you left and right,
Don't you dare cross to my side,
Rumors cripple the image,
You create,

[Chorus]

What if You're nothing,
And I've been deceived by trusting,

But what if I'm wrong?
I can't conceive a world without You in it,
I can't believe there was a time,
That You did not exist to me,
As my spine bends back,
And I'm about to break,
There You stand with my feet misplaced.

[Chorus]
