Accomplishing what's necessary,
To answer for morality,
Your forgiving nature seems to favor my side,
When I don't question what's intended what else could be mine?
To love in infancy,
Ignorance is ecstasy,
To trust and not to see,

[Chorus:]
Could you open my mind,
Revealing what's inside?
Denying everything you left behind,
Fear won't contain,
The others stray.

Destiny decorates my hand,
Decaying the worry of man,
To love in infancy,
Ignorance is ecstasy,

[Chorus]

Control decays,
As your years fade.

Following carefully to your end.

To love in infancy,
Ignorance is ecstasy,
You see me with eyes of envy,
You will know veracity,
To trust and not to see.

Fear won't contain,
The others stray.
Control decays,
As your years fade.
