Your heirs are full of lies,
Just when my soul,
Longs for more,
The world evens the score,
I want to admit that Your words are true,
But Your children slander all that You do.

How can You let them control,
What they refuse to uphold,
You claim to conquer the dead,
But it's the living that I dread.

Breeding disaster,
To please their master.

[Chorus:]
Deceiver,
You left Your mark,
Lost souls embracing the dark.
Believer,
Where is your heart?
Lost souls embracing the dark.

Judgment and condemnation,
Setting wars between the nations,
Death reigns in Your name,
How can I believe this is how it should be?

How can You let them control,
What they refuse to uphold,
You claim to conquer the dead,
But it's the living that I dread.
I am a victim of Your purging,
You sent Your sheep to bury me.

[Chorus]

As the sickness sinks in,
Where is Your plan?
