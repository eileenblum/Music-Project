Creator of life

We were made to be fruitful
To sow life into the earth
To heal the blind, the lost, and the hurt

O deliverer, I want to see the world through your eyes
To be an oasis of love when the well runs dry
Creator of life, I want to see the world through your eyes
To be an oasis of love when the well runs dry

Prepare for the storm

When the world goes cold and death swallows the sky
Will your waters flow when the well runs dry?
When the mountains crumble and the seas open wide
Will we still stand with our hands held high?

Sin won't outweigh the cross
Death won't erase the crown
We will remember the cost that was paid in blood

Shape us with your hands that built the earth from grains of sand
Creator of life, renew the earth you came to save

Renew the earth

Death will come
Skies will fall
Spirit come fulfill us all

A time will come when oceans will turn to barren wasteland
Our God will come revealing glory with his hands

Living water flow
