All life will lay its head where the dust will turn dead
Hearts pump what feeds the soul from the cup that makes us whole
Soak what earth sows as you accept struggles to grow
When the fabric of being fades, fate leads you to an earthly grave

Embrace the temporary
Human life is contradictory
To the never ending life that was purchased at Calvary

Take comfort in knowing precious earth is worth sowing
Blessed are those who seize the day
Because it will all soon fade away
This world will fade away

We will come to know this world is not our final destination
We werenât meant to occupy thrones that were built on condemnation
To live life without meaning leaves a stain of deceiving,
Blood stained earth meant for more than hurt

Your life is the warm wind
The leaves crumble in the sin

All life will lay its head where the dust will turn dead
Hearts pump what feeds the soul

Make us whole
