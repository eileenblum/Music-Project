Spirit and truth point to You

The yearning desire to fulfill
A well run dry, no drops left to spill
Can hands shape meaning?
Why are our hearts still beating?
When purpose is fleeting, our fate becomes deceiving

Is life an eternal thirst?
Dunes of sand hide the mirage of worth

Satisfy my heart
My hands stretched higher and higher
Spirit and Truth point to You
Burn like fire, my desire

You are my desire

Holes in hearts long for more than just a person to fill our core

My soul has left me poor
A beggar, vacant and torn
Spirit and truth point to you,
God come and make me new

You make me new
