Your nature will not overcome you
My soul willed but my flesh canât comprehend

In Your image, I pursued, to reach my end, fulfill my nous
Imperfectionâs a fatal excuse to why I canât seek Truth
I tried to use these filthy hands
I lied and claimed Iâd understand
A crippled white flag waving in the winds of pride and shame
Never to succeed, I am a victim
You are the victor

I have been consumed
I refuse to walk down a path of destruction
Show me your will for me, God

I place it all in Your hands
Show me your Will for me
I place it all in your hands, itâs up to You my friend

Your nature will not overcome you

The failure of man is to not try
But to give in when left behind

I did this all
I did this all for you

Your white flagged waved while you were in my hands
All while I paved your plans
All I ask of you is for you to listen to me
And to keep moving when you're done bleeding

Be a man
