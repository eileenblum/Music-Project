They tell me divinity knows why my pain overflows
While my hands are scarred and my sins are buried below

O saving victim, I long to hear your voice
Speak the words
Are my prayers heard?
The hands that bled
My story was written in blood

Holes showed the price
It poured from your side
My salvation was written in blood

My story was written in blood with the words sent from above
My voice is hoarse, death is my discourse
Where does my help come from?

The holes in my hands are the remnants of your Holy Word
Poured from your side, my entire life was written before I was born

You claim Iâve never felt your pain
But every inch of me was blood-stained
Iâve wept, I died, I paid the price all so you can live this life
