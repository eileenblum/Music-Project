Eternal rest lies at your feet

In your steps we follow, driven by the thirst for a drop
When our chests feel hollow, greed persuades vision to stop

I am an orphan
I am a slave

I am an orphan to the earth
A slave to mortal man
Who defines my worth as I search for the works of your hands?

O rescuer, have mercy
Eternal rest lies at your feet

This is my story written in the blood of Christ
This is your glory
You are the author of life
O safe haven, oh how we long for hands
For the sake of us undeserving
Have mercy on us

Remain in me as I remain in You

I am a traveler lost at sea
Longing for the shore
That grace that sets us free when we have fallen weak

For the sake of His sorrowful passion
Have mercy on us and on the whole world

We call you Father
We call you God
You are the potter
You are the saving God
We call you Jesus
The King of Kings
You are Redeemer
You've set us free
