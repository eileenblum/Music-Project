Of those who fed people on the great words no one survived 
The words are only left
Yesterday I thought the echoes of these words 
Are music inside
Today I really don't know who I really am
I thought that the sedition was my vocation
I've started to search for relief
For safety of indifference 

Today I really don't know who I really am
I hide in twilight of the grey cities 
Drunk with my bitterness 
With the remains of my strength
I'm trying to detain those dying great words 
I thought that the echoes of these words 
Which are the music of mind 
Were sounded inside
The beast has opened its eyes
Great words for those called for dreams!

An animal doesn't think about eternity
While struggling for existence 

From the ashes of those who fed people on great words 
We build the altars 

Of those who fed people on great words
Only these words survived 
Of those who fed people on great words
Only small people are left

From the ashes of those who fed people on great words 
We build the altars 
I thought I was from those who fed people on great words 
Nevertheless we are their nourishment!
