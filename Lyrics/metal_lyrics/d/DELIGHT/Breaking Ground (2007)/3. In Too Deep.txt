You make me see
the pain we left behind
we make-believe
we'll break the wall when it's time
grown within me, grown in you
matter of our dreams
all the ways are falling through
when you're in too deep
you're still turning to the one I used to be
I'm not over you I'm an afterglow
in too deep
all our past is gone but we've been here all the same
and I need you to know I can't cope with borrowed blame
grown within me, grown in you
matter of our dreams
all our ways are breaking through
but we're in too deep
you're still turning to the one I used to be
I'm not over with you I'm an afterglow
in too deep
don't you know what's wrong so many lies beneath
and I've been holding on too long
in too deep... in too deep...
you're still turning to the one I used to be
I'm not over with you I'm an afterglow
in too deep
don't you know what's wrong too many lies beneath
and I've been holding on for too long
