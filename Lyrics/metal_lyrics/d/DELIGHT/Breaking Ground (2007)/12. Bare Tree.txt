Your face comes back
Through cracks in usual days
I understand
Walk on and look away

I'm killing time
I know there's nothing to wait for
Rewriting my lines
I'll make my decisions tomorrow

There's so much to think about

I'll close my eyes just like the doll-house windows
I'll stop that image from coming back to life
A bare tree in love with the winter
I'll make my mind up another time

I turn my back
On hope, whatever it is
I won't lose track
Of just how I got to be here

I will renounce
My faith in reunion
I'll relearn how
To embrace things like before

I'll learn how to part with doubts

I'll close my eyes just like the doll-house windows
I'll stop that image from coming back to life
A bare tree in love with the winter
I'll make my mind up another time

And what if there is no oneness
It can't give your existence meaning
Another empty concept
The end's etched into the beginning

I'll close my eyes just like the doll-house windows
I'll stop that image from coming back to life
A bare tree in love with the winter
I'll make my mind up another time

I'll close my eyes just like the doll-house windows
I'll stop that image from coming back to life
A bare tree in love with the winter
I'll make my mind up another time
