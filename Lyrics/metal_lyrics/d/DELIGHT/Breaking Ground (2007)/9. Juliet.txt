Take a secret on your way
there's too many things not said
there was no way out of this maze
so I shut the door on my thread
'cause all the lines we had to walk
they brought us back again
and all the times I thought I'd won
I knew you'd lose again
I hope one day you will understand
see the blade I held the vial you drank
I hope one day you will understand
see the blade you held the vial I drank
the horizon's drawing closer
and there's no one to help move on
I left all the chains you've broken
but I had to go on alone
'cause all the lines I had to cross
they brought me back again
and all the times I thought you lost
my strength came back again
I hope one day you will understand
see the blade I held
the vial you drank
I hope one day you will understand.
see the blade you held
the vial I drank
I hope one day you will understand.
see the blade I held
the vial you drank
I hope one day you will understand.
see the blade you held
the vial I drank
I hope one day you will understand
see the blade I held
