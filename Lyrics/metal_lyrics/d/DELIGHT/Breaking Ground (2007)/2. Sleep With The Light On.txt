Better watch your back.
is your mother there is your mother there
you are like a baby
better be a man better be a man
someone overhears all you say and do
does it bother you who is gonna save you
is your conscience clear
if there's nobody that you fear
why are you so weak that you must
sleep with the light on
shivering in the cold with nothing to hold
why are you frightened
are you running scared
if you must sleep with the light on
(you know you know you know you know)
you must have done something very wrong
something very wrong
better get a grip are you unaware
is another there coming to delete you
it's the enemy that you never see
you better beware when you're not around
see the solid ground fall away beneath you
is someone out there maybe a ghost from the past
you can hear all those things you said that make you
sleep with the light on
shivering in the cold with nothing to hold
why are you frightened are you running scared
if you must sleep with the light on
(you know you know you know you know)
you must have done something very wrong
something very wrong
you can't run away from yourself
what goes on in the dark is never out of sight
it will come to light
sleep with the light on
shivering in the cold with nothing to hold
why are you frightened are you running scared
if you must sleep with the light on
(you know you know you know you know)
you must have done something very wrong
something very wrong
you must sleep with the light on
shivering in the cold with nothing to hold
Who are you fighting it's the beast inside
if you must sleep with the light on
(you know you know you know you know)
you must have done something very wrong
something very wrong
