Our world is divided
start everything over
our happiness like two hands joined for a prayer
an old faded picture like stale bread
our world is divided
somebody once so close suddenly a total stranger
start everything over make the best of bad times
leave my mind
sleepless nights in an empty house
now whisper says the echo make sure that all is gone
our world is divided
somebody once so close suddenly a total stranger
start everything over make the best of bad times
leave my mind
through your human reason you will never see unity
between what is beginning and what soon will not be
I still can't understand how
somebody once so close suddenly a total stranger
start everything over make the best of bad times
leave my mind
