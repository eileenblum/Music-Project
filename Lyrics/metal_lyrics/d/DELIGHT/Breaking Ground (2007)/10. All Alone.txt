I can see the reason that you're leaving
fighting something you're not seeing
'cause I know I know it so well.
I can tell when you stopped trying
no way out you can't deny it
you just knew you know me so well
I know I'll see this day again
all will change, you don't know when
afraid to see me taking my first step
I'm recreated here again
can't reject this phantom pain
you burned all bridges and became someone else
all alone
you're on top of the game but...
all I know
I'm on top of the game but
all alone
I can feel the absence in me
feel it shaping me and brimming
and I know I know it so well
I remember hands not granted
nanoworlds I had invented
and you know you knew me so well
I know I saw your face again
crowds of people, one of them
I can't find you staying where I am
I'm recreated here again
can't reject my phantom pain
I'll burn all bridges and become someone else
all alone you're on top of the game but...
all I know I'm on top of the game but...
all alone all I know
I'm so alone
I'm so alone
all alone
you're on top of the game but
all alone
all I know
I'm on top of the game but
all alone
all alone
you're on top of the game but
all alone
all I know
I'm on top of the game but...
