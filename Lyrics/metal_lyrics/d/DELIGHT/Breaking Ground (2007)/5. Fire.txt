I'm reaching too high but I know he will fall by my side
I'm fighting them blind but I know I will see his light
unfolding like a sun unfolding like a sun
I'm holding out my hand join me on my path
let this fire linger
I'm holding out my hand finding all I am
slipping through my fingers he's leading the way
over where we'll steal another day
we know what it takes never forgetting we're in a race
unfolding like a sun unfolding like a sun
I'm holding out my hand join me on my path
let this fire linger
I'm holding out my hand finding all I am
slipping through my fingers but I gave you all I had
let me give up where I stand
I'm holding out my hand join me on my path
let this fire linger
I'm holding out my hand finding all I am
slipping through my fingers
