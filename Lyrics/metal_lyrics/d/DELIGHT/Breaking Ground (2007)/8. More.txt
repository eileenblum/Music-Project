all you could have is still not enough 
every day it makes for less 
you silence your thoughts to make the pain stop 
no tears since lies are better to get 

all you can have 
but still not enough 

burning your way higher and higher 
you never care to look down 
ambition swallows your heart's desires 
you're watching it close this wall around 

just to think the world could end today 
picture yourself fading away 
faced with the end you'd see the real sense 
things you can have are nothing to gain 

all you can have 
but still not enough 

just to think the world could end today 
picture yourself fading away 
faced with the end you'd see the real sense 
things you can have are nothing to gain
