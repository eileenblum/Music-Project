He's hurting
got the truth too soon
unplanned. no reason to drag it out of you
clever sleight of hand
never forget how your doubt can fade
the stories that we tell lead our way
but why do you feel so trapped
but why why does it still come back
why do we second-guess what we can really have
but why is all I ask
how far should I go
your thoughts are way ahead of you
how did your sky fall
something someone said was it even true
what do you long to find would it even help
the stories in your mind that never end
but why. do you feel so trapped
but why why does it still come back
why do we second-guess
what we can really have
but why is all I ask
but why do you feel so trapped
but why why does it still come back
why do we second-guess. what we can really have
but why is all I ask
