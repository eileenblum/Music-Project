Every time I know a chapter's ended
every magic potion's tasting sour
you see I have calculated
all the outcomes of this game
and I know that this is real
but just before I can say this
you let hope back inside me
and I know that old road takes me far away
where to go
the room is spinning around
you're there for me but I don't know
I'll take a shot in the dark
every time I need a new beginning
I just wanna feel things are adding up
I'm sick of all these surprises
all the times that I trusted
all those bolts out of the blue
I scramble out of this mess to find some place where it's safer
forgetting it's always you I'll stumble on
where to go
the room is spinning around
you're there for me but I don't know
I'll take a shot in the dark you lead me on
I know I'm nothing without you
hope my fire engulfs you
you're still there smiling on
I hate the way that I need you
how I just can't betray you
and the way back from the edge
leads into your arms
where to go
the room is spinning around
you're there for me but I don't know
I'll take a shot in the dark and you lead me on
where to go
the room is spinning around
you're there for me but I don't know
I'll take a shot in the dark
and you'll lead me on
