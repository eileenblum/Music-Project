sadness and joy are two words, but just one name
ever since you went away
I'm waiting for a sign, I'd like to bring you back
don't know what to say
can't trust the silence that stayed a while in me
just to catch a breath
I heard it sing out in no language
what your one 'no' meant

words make lies, please read my thoughts
your one no breaks my world apart
words make lies, please read my thoughts
with one yes from you two parts become one

sometimes things that go on between us don't work out like I want
it's 'cause instead of you I'm learning who I am
should have learned that by heart
sometimes you hear things I did not want to say
many words but no meaning
and I keep forgetting what really matters
what I really mean

words make lies, please read my thoughts
your one no breaks my world apart
words make lies, please read my thoughts
with one yes from you two parts become one

don't you ever think we're here
we're here to realize
that we really need
need no words

words make lies, please read my thoughts
your one no breaks my world apart
words make lies, please read my thoughts
with one yes from you two parts become one
