don't ask me about this smile
I can't tell you what it is
another place, another life
don't know how it reached me here
now when we are perfect strangers
it all came back for one moment
all those feelings, smells and whispers
memories I thought I got over

one day I'll let your name out
like that night, in my sleep
everything is different now
but you're still a part of me

lying there, my eyes wide open
by the boundaries of your dreams
the air quivering, silence broken
that strange name fell off your lips
every night I count on your breath
to remind me where I am
cling to your warmth, hope your presence
keeps the clock from racing back

one day I'll let your name out
like that night, in my sleep
everything is different now
but you're still a part of me

all our love carves in, it will come back to haunt
I know I can't erase it, I have to go on
one day I'll let your name out in my sleep
though everything is different, you're still part of me

one day I'll let your name out
like that night, in my sleep
everything is different now
but you're still a part of me

one day I'll let your name out
like that night, in my sleep
everything is different now
but you're still a part of me
