Mother Earth is stained by the blood of her children
Hostile whine of wind announces Death
Dead silence in forests instead of birds songs
Knights of the Wild Eagle will take revenge!

Time of revenge
Fire and sword
Time of revenge

In the battlefield
Knights are asleep
The moon has started the journey
In the fields of death
The moon is relpected in the puddles of blood

Time of revenge

[written by P. Maslanka]
