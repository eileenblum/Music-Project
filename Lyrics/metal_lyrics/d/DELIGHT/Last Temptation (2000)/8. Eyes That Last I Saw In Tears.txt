Eyes that last I saw in tears
Through division
Here in death's dream kingdom
The golden vision reappers

I saw the eyes but not the tears

This is my affliction
Eyes I shall not see again
Eyes of decision
At the door of death's other kingdom
Where, as in this
The eyes outlast, the tears
And hold us in decision.

[written by T.S. Eliot]
