our happiness like two hands joined for an everyday prayer
an old faded picture
like dry bread

our world is divided into two parts
somebody once so close
suddenly a total stranger
cut it out for a start
make the best of bad times
leave my mind

sleepless nights in an empty house
now whisper says the echo
make sure a lot is gone

our world is divided into two parts
somebody once so close
suddenly a total stranger
cut it out for a start
make the best of bad times
leave my mind

through your human reason you will never see unity
between what is beginning and what soon will not be

I still can't understand how
somebody once so close
suddenly a total stranger
cut it out for a start
make the best of bad times
leave my mind
