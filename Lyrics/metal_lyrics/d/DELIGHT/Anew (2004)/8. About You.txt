can't find yourself where the shadows play
there is no God so you've got no faith
go hide away forget and meet peace in dreams
let thoughts melt and tangle let your mouth be sealed

mirrors show a face
but the eyes are strange
not yours
can you tell what's real
isn't it a dream
about you

mirrors show a face
but the eyes are strange
not yours
can you tell what's real
isn't it a dream

good dreams fade out at the touch of moonlight
you go deep for oblivion down in the dark
not to feel a thing, always be asleep, somewhere far away
'cause the mundane and bland long for the morning gray

see me
I'm right here
to wake you up
and fight nightmares off

stop running, you can't leave yourself behind
I am with you now and I'll always be there by your side
say love is the mold that can shape life with sense
then it seems only love can wipe away your pain

mirrors show a face
but the eyes are strange
not yours
can you tell what's real
isn't it a dream
about you

mirrors show a face
but the eyes are strange
not yours
can you tell what's real
isn't it a dream
