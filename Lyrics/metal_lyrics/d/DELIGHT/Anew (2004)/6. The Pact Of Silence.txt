so conveniently out of sight and out of mind
private offices, the handshakes, leisure time
daydreams, delusions, religion, law and science
the underworld, their pact of silence

nothing can keep me safe from the evil out there
the one thing I'm sure of will reach me just like them
the silence tempts me to start lying to myself
nothing hurts as much as to hear you just don't care

you say the world's always been run by this same pattern
individual rights would never really matter
majority rule makes you give in and stay silent
you say when I stand up I just declare that I'm powerless

it makes me scream to hear I can't make it change
it's people like you who make things stay the same
so don't you ever say that I can't make a change
it's people like you!!

nothing can keep me safe from the evil out there
the one thing I'm sure of will reach me just like them
the silence tempts me to start lying to myself
nothing hurts as much as to hear you just don't care

nothing can keep me safe from the evil out there
the one thing I'm sure of will reach me just like them
the silence tempts me to start lying to myself
nothing hurts as much as to hear you just don't care
