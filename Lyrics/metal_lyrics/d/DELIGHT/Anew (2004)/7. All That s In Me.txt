I felt something was wrong
a wave of hate sweeping over me
I saw the anger and pain
I saw her world
the silence around us swelling
with all the memories flooding back
the bubble burst
she was who I was

all that's in me
I'm broken hurt rejected
it's all she's got
she thinks that he is all that she's got

I knew that face, that hollow stare
my tears were in her eyes
I knew that cold, I know it so well
it echoed through my mind
I know I can't turn back now
I can't erase these wounds
I walked away with
her painful truth

yeah sure it was the last time
and I know it sure wasn't you
'course you don't remember a thing
these tears are honest, too
I know what you're gonna say
your every word is false
you're all fake
not this time, no
you won't trick me no more
I'm leaving I'm leaving

all that's in me
I'm broken hurt rejected
the nightmare is back now
back to a world I can't predict

just like her I hoped for a change
I thought that I was strong
there was no pain I couldn't take
now I know I was so wrong
fighting not to be alone
holding tight to my blind faith
together we would fall
now I know my mistake

everything I say to you
will seem banal and clichÃ©d
breaching the boundaries
of the closeness we fake
so how is this for obvious
all's fair in love and war
make sure the love is great, though
and what if it's not there
we're not there
that's all

all that's in me
I'm broken hurt rejected
it's all she's got
she thinks that he is all that she's got

all that's in me
I'm broken hurt rejected
the nightmare is back now
back to a world I can't predict
