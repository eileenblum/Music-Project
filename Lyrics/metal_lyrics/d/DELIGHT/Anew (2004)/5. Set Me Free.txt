imagine suddenly the world is gone
and everything around
is only a dream
imagine seeing the whole world shatter
knowing what you feel will never matter
there's nobody here
that's how I feel

come set me free
the ground's cracking open under my feet
come set me free
I'm falling down an abyss of disbelief
now madness is opening its arms
splitting my thoughts in two parts
come set me free

imagine you can't touch, can't see
all the ones you love
they disappear
imagine hearing the voice of god
his words are tearing your mind apart
there's nobody here
that's how I feel

come set me free
the ground's cracking open under my feet
come set me free
I'm falling down an abyss of disbelief
now madness is opening its arms
splitting my thoughts in two parts
come set me free
before there is nothing left of me

how did I deserve this curse
I can't stop these thoughts, these hurting words
forgive me, I don't know who I am
I'm slipping away into madness

come set me free
the ground's cracking open under my feet
come set me free
I'm falling down an abyss of disbelief
now madness is opening its arms
splitting my thoughts in two parts
come set me free
