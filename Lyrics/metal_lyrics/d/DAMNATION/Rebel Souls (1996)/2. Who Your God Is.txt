[lyrics: Les]

Infernal rain cleanses deceitful visage of our faces
Ravished by fury of insanity we last in the gloom of our souls
Anxiety comes over the hearts of intimidated children of fire
We wait for the spark that fire us with craving for destruction
Who your god is
Ordering you to creep
In front of his symbol
The blind lead the blind
Open your mind, I'll invide inside
And destroy the cult of idolatry
Holy pictures, illusive forms of human perfection hope
Fetishes created by the hand of abortive ascetics of god-cross
[lead: BART]
The gates of time will open soon,
Seal of the light's sons will crack
Legions of truth will invide into new world
Cults strangled by the cross will arise
Circles of fire will ignite
In the forgotten divine groves
Prepare the world for our coming
Open the blind's eyes
