[lyrics: Bart]

I can see the sign
Unseen for the mortals
I can smell the breath
Of forgotten centuries
I can hear some whispers
Penetrating my mind
I can feel bloody claws
Reaching far into my soul
[lead: LES]
(Demons) I know whom you are
At last you have come
(Demons) Ancient lords of evil
From the abyssland
Immortal warriors of darkness
Set free from anonymous chasm
Ancient legions of death
Will cover the sun and heaven
The opened gates of time
Broken up holy seals
Our time has come
We rise in arms again!
[lead: BART]
From the abyssland
[lead: LES]
[lead: BART]
(Demons) I can feel your evil
Pure, intact for ages
(Demons) I can feel your thoughts
Of blood, hate and vengeance
[lead: BART]
