[lyrics: Les]

I'm fire, darkness disappeared in my eyes
I'm the son of hidden root of life
Sons of the earth, listen to your teachers
Sons of the fire who came from the deepest
Darkness...
Son of fire
I'm their leading spirit and guide
When I begin my deed I'll build all
For effigy of the ancient circles
Of non-passing days
Fiery rotating gale
Will fulfil its mission in rotary move
Like a lightning pierce the fiery clouds
Son of fire
Here's dark space, descendant of the fire of truth
Since now let it be eternal darkness
Only fire, messenger of the ancient fathers last
Only fire...
[lead: LES]
