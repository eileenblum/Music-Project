[lyrics: Bart]

Closed before ages on the other side of the defined
Where black planets circulate without a goal
Where the births of creatures lie
Fettered with sorcery they never die
When the stars reach the proper place
In the Cycle of eternity
And the world is prepared for their arrival
They will emerge from the gaping chasm of dark dimension
Forgotten black flames will burn again
The battle hymn echoes in my soul
Free from fetters of the ancient magic
I wander boundless times and spaces
My name is eternal
Spoken turns into...
Damnation
