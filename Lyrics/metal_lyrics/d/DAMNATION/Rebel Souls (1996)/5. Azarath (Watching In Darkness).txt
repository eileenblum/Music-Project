[lyrics: Les]

I'm one of them
My mouth have drained the cup of immortality
Cursed is living among fleeting generations
Damned is lasting in the calm of anonymous grave
Formula of immortality placed by my side
Where are the mouths, which will vivify its substance
I'm waiting for the time
When my brothers find me
Bestial wings cut cold air
Courier of darkness flits to set fire
To hearts frozen by time
Extinguished before ages
Time of rebellion is coming
I'll lead my servants
I'll destroy the temples of false mysticism
No one will manage to see the
White hand of death
My name is Azarath
Watching in darkness
[lead: LES]
