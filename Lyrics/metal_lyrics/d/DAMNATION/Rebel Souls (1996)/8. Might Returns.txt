[lyrics: Les]

Dark edifice shrouded in the thick mist
Walls covered with shadow bathed in the purple of the sun
Master's throne wrapped in the attire of the ancient lords
Might returned to the old bewitched gates
Standing on the hill of truth
I reach out towards the abyss
Wind tousles my body
I feel the ancient power
Wild sea waves strike with crash against the walls
Power of nature unveils its mighty face
Let us be carried away by the force of element
Flesh, blood, lasting and death
Might returns
False symbols burn
Fire whirl devours
What the weak worshipped
In the times of darkness and deceit
so hope this will help you a bit nice site keep on going!
