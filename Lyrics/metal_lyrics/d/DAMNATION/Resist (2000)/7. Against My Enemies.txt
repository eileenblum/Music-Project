I wage a war inside my mind
Too late to take it back
I'm looking for the end
Controlled by pain inside
I battle with open visor
For this world in vain
I kill in bloody chaos
All of my enemies

I'm full of despair
Surrounded by eyes of hate
I never lose my might
My splendour will not decried

I've got the power to destroy
The symbols of hypocrisy
I try to find my path
And smashed'em all away
I'm ready to attack
I resist so I'm free
You will never break me down
Because I live to win

I'm full of despair
Surrounded by eyes of hate
I never lose my might
My splendour will not decried

[Lead: LES]
[Lead: BART]

To walk the path which sets me free
There's no way out!
I'd rather die
Than be like you
Over the edge
Never break through

I struggle to feel my selfish heart
There's no way out!
From genocide
Fire shall come
I'm one to blame
I will forever remain
