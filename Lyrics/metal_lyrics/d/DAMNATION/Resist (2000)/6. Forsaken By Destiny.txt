To look at people, welcome to corrosion race
I said goodbye forever to many my best friends
Confrontation against empty inside
So many things I regret, I'm thinking about suicide

Forsaken by destiny, from flesh to steel
In subconscious echo into chasm, I remove my sanity
Strength on the road to endless suffering
I will never forget my caustic memories

From beyond
From inside
To cease and to desist
To find my "sense" for the while

From the space
Beyond belief
From the blood to blade
To eliminate all my fears

"Maybe I'll die between people without glory?
Forsaken by destiny, there's no master for me..."
