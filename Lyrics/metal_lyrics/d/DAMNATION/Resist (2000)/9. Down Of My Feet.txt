I know there is no God for me - I am alone
Survival in a twisted world - more behind more
I am running to the path of the dead - who is my bride
Now, here and forever - I married the Dark
I married the Dark

[Lead: LES]

Darkness! Help me to live away reality
Count the dead! I'm waiting for infinite dismay
You'll shred the souls and shattered human sign of faith
At storms of chaos into fright christians will lost in hell Domain

My skin is dripping from blood - you fall apart!
The nocturnal hour is passed - the cross hanging around
Beholders of life you're dead - I'm looking your ripping heads
You're losing all your beliefs - You're down of my feet
You're down of my feet

Darkness! Help me to live away reality
Count the dead! I'm waiting for infinite dismay
You'll shred the souls and shattered human sign of faith
At storms of chaos into fright christians will lost in hell Domain
