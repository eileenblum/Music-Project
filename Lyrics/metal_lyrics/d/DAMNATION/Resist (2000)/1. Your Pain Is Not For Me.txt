Leading in a dark embrace
I look to your tormented face
You want to stand in my stead
Your pain is not for me!

You will fall!
Down the cross!
Demise of the crown!
I'm your thorn!

Praise me!
I am first who'll kill your sacrifice
Praise me!
You welcome death with open arms

[Lead: LES]

Blood runs like a rain, to inundate your pain
You are masochist? You're suffering, from my sins

I'm tread upon your flesh
To hear your silence breath
I see you feeble creep
Your pain will never be for me!

You will fall!
Down the cross!
Demise of the crown!
I'm your thorn!

Praise me!
I am first who'll kill your sacrifice
Praise me!
You welcome death with open arms

[Lead: BART]

Praise me!
