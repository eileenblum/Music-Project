Stand for resurrection - I revive my tears
To feel the bolts of thunder - I fight to exist
Conceived to be rebellious - Persist in a war
Stridden on different path - I've got only scorn!

Fighting at war with human waste
I'm burning obsolete ways
Ordered to lead the revolt
I fight to restore my worth
Absence in humanity
I will not stand in your "normality"
Burning worlds desire
I'm always standing higher!
Revolt!!

Shadows of hate surrounding me
In a world where all is deceit
Aggression in sadness and laughter in pain
Takes control of life everyday
This war we can't ignore
Persevered among the dying souls
Resolved on our way
We must abide and we must adhere!
Revolt!!

Stand for resurrection - I revive my tears
To feel the bolts of thunder - I fight to exist
Conceived to be rebellious - Persist in a war
Stridden on different path - I've got only scorn!
