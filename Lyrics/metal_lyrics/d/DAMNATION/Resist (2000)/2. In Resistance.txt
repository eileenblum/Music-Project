I've got no more respect
Enlightened in resistance
Rise to fight against - eliminate
Open minds will dominate

Now it's time to take control, now it's time...
Growing fear, revenge is so strong, now it's time...
I feel hate, there's no place for love, now it's time...
Of war!

Crucified people wrapped with greed
To control masses, mentally blind led
Christians lie indoctrinated, you and me
Waiting for severe impact, I clench my fist

Now it's time to take control, now it's time
Growing fear, revenge is so strong, now it's time
I feel hate, there's no place for love, now it's time
Of war!

Damned in flames - they will disappear
Destiny is waiting for us, I believe
When we'll finally reach the victory!
