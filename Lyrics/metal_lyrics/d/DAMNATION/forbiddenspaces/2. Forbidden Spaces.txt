Tangle of dark thoughts compresses my mind
Diabolic visions sculpture my brain
Slowly I am crossing the unholy gate

[Lead: BART]

Blasphemous illusions assume fantastic shape
Terrific chasms lead to forbidden spaces
Inscrutable passed time

[Lead: LES]

Maybe I died, maybe I born
I am on the edge of evil and goodness
Misunderstood whispers, countess shadows
They prompt me that the end became a beginning
