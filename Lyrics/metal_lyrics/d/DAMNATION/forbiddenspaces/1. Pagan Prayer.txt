I look at the abyss
On the altars of blasphemy
Hate, pain... Fruits of reality
My tears fill the soul's emptiness

Demon in my mind
Pagan prayer...

Sinful whispers... Sinful face
I surrender to Dark Side
I bow to unholy cults
Pentagram shines in light

[Lead: BART]

I trample the cross of hypocrisy
I derive the might
I despise weakness
My will exterminate everything!!!
