I've unveiled remote worlds
Entangled in universe glooms
Inscrutabled dimensions
Into chasms of chaos

I've revealed the dark secrets
Of terrible cosmic truth
I've been beyond the gate
Of abyss bottomless

Through my mind I've reached the stars
Beyond borders of infinity
I've used to summon demons
From deepest galaxies

Darkness - eternal
Evilness - infernal
Rapture - divine
Heavens' decline

Center of Infinity
Continuum

[Repeat chorus]
