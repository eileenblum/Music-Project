Absorbing us darkness
To the eternal rhythm takes away
The last chance given to us,
Lost solitude of being.
Cannot find a way
We roam in religious insanity
Slaves' children become slaves
Chain of faith in the vengeful god

Darkness, of the mercy gods' act
Darkness, nothingness is escape

[Lead: LES]

Wind blows away garments of skeletons carrying crosses
Dark retinue looks for its messiah
Nucleus of darkness

Who plays in god
Has his hands stained with blood
Life and death given into madman's hands
Crazy ones in cloths lead into darkness
Dark retinue drowns its banners into bloodshed

Darkness, of the mercy gods' act
Darkness, nothingness is escape

[Lead: BART]
