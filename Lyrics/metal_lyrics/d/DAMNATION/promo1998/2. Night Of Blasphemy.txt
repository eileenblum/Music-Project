Smeared the blood upon my face
I'm the creator of all pain
Tears are running from my eyes
Praying for my god
When darkness enshines...
Lord of all mortal filth
Invert my flesh for rebirth

He who kills!
He who kills this fuckin' world
The blood of vengeance - I'm his sword
In the battle with christian god!

Christians' scum!

[Lead: BART]

In bloody orgies my soul is released
Slaughter of the weak hail me into bliss
Through the flames I'll find the way
I ride the carnage night of blasphemy

He who kills!
He who kills this world of lies
I'm the pain - horror of mankind
The symbols of hate - my soul is blessed...

Born of plague!

[Lead: LES]

Master of dragon flames
Lord of destruction and damned
Spirit of the great abyss
Warrior rulers of the black earth
You serpent of the wicked
The ancient slumber
I ride the carnage
Night of blasphemy

[Lead: BART]
