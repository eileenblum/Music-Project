Boundless dreams tousling the mind
A space that terrifies
Sunken in fog of scorched ideas
I am waiting - Time of new prophets

Birth of life...
Crash with death...

Another world,
Another state of consciousness
The road of chosen ones
Lord of blood, Lord of duration
Heretic reign

Birth of life...
Crash with death...

You bring darkness
Lust fills my mind
Young beast demands a pray
Blood is the reward of time of illusion
