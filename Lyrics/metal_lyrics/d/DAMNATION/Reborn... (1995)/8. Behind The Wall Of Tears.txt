Behind the wall of tears
You can't see the sunbeams
Your consciousness surrounded
by the reef of oblivion
Prayers, supplications are the only hope

The hope of survival
Chance of salvation

Behind the wall of tears
You lose the sense of existence
You'll never hear own thoughts
You can't overcome your defeat

You've fallen down
Fallen dawn

Smashed into the rock of bitterness
You can't see the brightness
Your feelings - behind the wall of obscurity

Revelation of weakness
Wasted ideals
Walking the paths of hope
Remove the chance of existence
