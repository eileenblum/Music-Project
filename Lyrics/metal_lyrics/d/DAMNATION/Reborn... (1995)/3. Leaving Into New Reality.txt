Following the own perfection
I unite with you (for you)
Leaving into the new reality
I become damnation

[lead: BART]

I promised and believed
I found the real sense
I revealed the mystery of power
I conceived the magic of deeds
I trusted in my own destination

[lead: LES]

I tasted the fruits of rapture
I sacrificed my existence
I drank the chalice of bitterness
Leaving into the new reality

Here I am - for you
Waiting for your nod
Longing for my performance
Here I am - with my blood

[lead: BART]

[lead: LES]
[lead: BART]

Forever... with you
