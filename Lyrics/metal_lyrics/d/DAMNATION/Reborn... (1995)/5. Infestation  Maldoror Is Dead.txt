Purple heaven
In a blaze of darkness
Creator of destiny
He was father to me

My obsecrations - please hear me lord
Obscure magical flame's burning
Effigy of ignorance is vanishing
The other gods, the other side...

Rapture...
Infestation of sacrificials to Inferno
Shadows of blood appear...

Worship in black
Scorned sanctities
Lost conscience
Dominion of conquerors
