The last battle, the god's fall
Colliding legions of hate, all against all
Carried away by possessed wave
Bloody madness

Extermination
No winners

Absurd horror, dying without consciousness
United in fear, massacre in blood
In blasphemous rapture, wasted senses
Apocalypse of merciless rulers

Extermination
No winners

On the edge of times - HATE
Existence died - CALM

Darkness unite in brightness
The next abyss is coming
Crushed faces, fire and torment
The last battle... AGAIN!!!
