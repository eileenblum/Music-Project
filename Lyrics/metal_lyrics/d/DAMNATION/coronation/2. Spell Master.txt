Look into my burning eyes
Red clouds tear the space
Fading spark like broken bloody thread
It's my hands that play the harp of life and death
False tune sounds like a scream of life dying away
I'll play the song of death

[lead: LES]

Oh winds, come to me again
Abduct for me the souls searching for light
I'll sweep them into the abyss
I'm Azarath, the son of dusk

[repeat first verse]

[lead: BART]

I bite my lips, I feel blood
Sweet taste of life, with which I fill my cup
