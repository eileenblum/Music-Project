Mystery of power hidden in my soul
I've found the key to the ancient wisdom
Now I'm the supreme one
Day of my coronation is coming

I'm messenger of darkness
I destroy the harmony of the worlds
I create new reality
Red flames dance in my eyes

The bones of Christ's followers
Shall build my kingdom and my throne
Their blood is my only nectar
Souls of those gave me primeval power

[lead: LES]

Dark clouds covered the sun
Hymn of fallen angels resounds with victory

[lead: BART]

Impotent god, I disavowed you
Now kneel in front of me, the crown is mine
Coronation...
