The sound of bell disturb my peace
Eternal emperor of infinity
Nature died in fear
This sign reminds me of a far-away nightmare

Master of souls invites for a feast
The time of huntings and subcelestial extermination has come

Lightning disused grey of dawn
Dusted rooms revived with the movements of shadows
Humidity and smell of old age filled the air
The memory in dead objects revived
Life in dried bodies has awoken
I reach my hands towards the skies
Winged demons drink my blood

I'm his part, I know what he wants
