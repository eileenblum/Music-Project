At that moment the young boy came to know
that he was the new Chosen One
and the eldest was going to give him last lesson!
life's values...

Your life is short, the battles are infinite
trust in your self or you'll fall on the way
face what you have to and never surrender
if your heart is pure it will guide your fight

[Bridge:]
Remember the people you met in
the golden years
what they left you inside it will be...
it will be the weapon that defeats the enemy
and listen your Gods shoutin' revenge
for the suffers

Now is your time if you know how to use it
you won't give happiness but deliverance
remember the old days but don't get lost
tomorrow is better 'cause still have to come

[Chorus:]
The wind of tomorrow will blow
through your hair
tears will be shed 'cause killing ain't so easy
you're alone for defending your creed
and proud the victory will take your hand

So, your ideals can't be treaded with death
start to sing very grateful the song of gods
but after all bring your heart and your sword
to shine, tomorrow is another dream

[Bridge:]
Remember the people you met in the golden years
(And after the victory you must joy and reflect)
what they left you inside it will be...
(In Dark Horizon)
it will be the weapon that defeats the enemy
(Chosen One)
and listen your Gods shoutin' revenge for suffers

[Chorus]
