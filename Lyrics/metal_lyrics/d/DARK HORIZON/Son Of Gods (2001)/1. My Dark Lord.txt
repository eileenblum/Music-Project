[Prologue]

A long time ago, in the land of Garigard,
where Dragons, Elves and horrible monsters
lived, a powerful army was prepared to confront
the Dark Lord and his demonic soldiers.
Many were the battles but the war didn't seem
to reach an end.
One night, after a victory, a few of knights
were together in a glade near the battlefield
resting themselves around a fire.
The eldest of the group began to speak to a young
boy who was initiated to the Sacred Code.
"My fellow, your master is teaching you the arts
of Steel and of fighting, but you have to know
that you'll be a real knight only when your heart
and your soul will as one with your sword.
Listen with care to the story I'm going to tell you
cause it'll show you the way you have to follow".

Once, when the evil one had spread his black
mantel bringing only death, famine, destruction,
all the dwellers of Garigard's land had lost all
hope of salvation and had bowed their heads
before the power of the Dark Lord, leaving all
their dreams for the future

[My Dark Lord]

all the dwellers of Garigard's land had lost all

before the power of the Dark Lord, leaving all

[Chorus:]
Listen my Dark Lord my time is come
my sword and my life belong to you
I have not fear of dying...My destiny
my blood will flow into the brave-hearts

Only pain I can feel in the northern wind
the flames are burning higher
than the flashed sky
the landscape is turned into ash : weep!
My king from the fired storm
I hear your sharp cry

[Bridge:]
Stream of blood loaded by the red rain
invade my land full of pain
the wind still blows screams of sorrow
the fire won't forgive even tomorrow

The moon is covered by the demon's smoke
waiting for the sun that can clear the fears
my heart is suffering with anger by the stroke
warm, famine, death fill my soul of tears

[Bridge &amp; chorus]

My people runs away like the time in my life
there's no tomorrow for my unknown future
I hold the steel of my sword ready for the fight
I'll feel the whiff of the beast : the creature

[Bridge &amp; chorus 2x]
