Long ago its sign
Faded in a while
And black clouds covered the earth
We lost the sense of time
The day and the morning light
The colours of the dawn

We all lived in the shadow
a bad life in a bad world
We always prayed for a new sun
and its return on those wings that burned

Now It's rising high
From the flames to the sky
It's burning high
Where the sun used to shine
It's flying high
The Dragon's rising

We didn't know what we could do
In the night  - In the dark
we could only wait for the saviour
and its return on those wings that burned
