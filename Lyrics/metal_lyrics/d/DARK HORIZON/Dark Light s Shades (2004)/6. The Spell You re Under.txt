Somewhere tonight
Your restless heart and soul are taken
Don't waste your time
or you'll lose your mind

You don't know why
the magic evil's words are spoken
and what she hides
is hard to recognize

You can believe
The love that she feels is real
But you can't deny
to your eyes to see the light

She's the spell you're under
The hidden demon to your sight
She's the spell you're under
And you don't know if you're alive

She's the spell you're under
The hidden demon to your sight
She's the spell you're under
Someone calls her, death in life

Look all around
The  darkest gates of hell are opened
Don't make a sound
or she'll take you down
You don't know how
The ancient promises are broken,
And king with no crown,
you're falling to the ground
