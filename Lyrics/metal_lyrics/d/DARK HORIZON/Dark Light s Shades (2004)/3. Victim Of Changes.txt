Here alone my thoughts are moving slow
Just like a man behind the grey prison's walls
No words for what  I feel, no meaning
I can't find an answer .......  too blind to see

Nothing can change me
I used to say before
Nothing can hurt me
I thought to be so strong
But the circumstances
force me to wonder why
the man I used to be
now lives a lie

Victim of changes
I'm trying to go on

Lost in a world afraid of what I seem
I'm trying hard and hard just to be me
A Voice never heard says to guide me
Be yourself man, It's all you need

Nothing can change me
I used to say before
Nothing can hurt me
I thought to be so strong
But the circumstances
force me to wonder why
the man I used to be
now lives a lie

Victim of changes
I'm trying to go on

So I look inside of me to face the change
And find the man I thought I was
Sometimes weak sometimes strange
Always the same behind these walls
