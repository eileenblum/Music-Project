[Hanibal:]
I was an hero I was a lord
I came from a distant land to conquer the world
Strongest and invincible
Against the will of Gods
I defeated all my enemies along the way to Rome

Here I'm alone and far from home
Hunted and betrayed
While the battle in hot Africa is so close to come

I had the power, all the Romans in my hands
But they still believed  in their victory, so they rose again.
Guided by Scipio, thousand men of war
Came to my Chartago, and now  wait  for my fall.

Here I'm alone and far from home
Wounded and betrayed
While the battle in hot Africa is so close to come

Now that hero cries tears in the night
Miles away from his people, from his own brothers
Now that hero cries, tears in the night
Miles away from his people, from his own brothers
