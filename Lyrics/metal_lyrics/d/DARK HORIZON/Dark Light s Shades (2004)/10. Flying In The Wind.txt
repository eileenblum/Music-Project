I saw you in the light
Of a cold winter night
I could not believe that you cried
Surrounded by silence, you called my name
How many tears in the rain

Maybe it's late to say I'm sorry
I never meant to cause you pain
You know that my heart was true

Now I'm living here beside you
Whispering words of love again
But  you're searching for me too far

Don't you see, I'm a drop upon your skin
Tear of love, I'm flying
Don't you see, I'm a drop in a silver rain
Tear of love, I'm flying
Flying in the wind

I held you in my arms
If only for a while
I couldn't know it was the last time
Wounded by memories, you tried to live
How many years without me
