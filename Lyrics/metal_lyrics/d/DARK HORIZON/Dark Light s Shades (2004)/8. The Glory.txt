[Hanibal:]
Father, it' is time for me to fight
and your light begins to fade
I'm searching  for an answer..........
Who denies me your embrace?

I know, there's no way to kill my pain
but my tears are not in vain
I'll turn this rain to anger
remembering your name

What was once just a dream
Now it becomes so real
What was once only a child
Now is a warrior to fear

[Carthaginians:] Glory to the Lord
[Hanibal:] I'm here to guide you
[Carthaginians:] Glory to the Lord
[Hanibal:] I'm here for you
[Carthaginians:] Glory to the Lord
[Hanibal:] I'm here to guide you
[Carthaginians:] Glory to the Lord
[Hanibal:] Now is time; Now is time

[Hannibal:]
Brothers, there's a new voice from above
It's telling me to save you all
It's telling me you're my son
You're the chosen one.

Hold on, and we will ride the red sand storm
we'll be stronger than before
Face this war together
till the day, we'll see them fall.
