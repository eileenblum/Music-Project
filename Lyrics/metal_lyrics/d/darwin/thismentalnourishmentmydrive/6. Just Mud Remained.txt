I wish for a grey world. I wish I never tasted the snow.
For now I cannot turn my head. The sun is my love!
Snow beautified the landscape, but the mud beneath remained.

Clouds moved away merely light of the full moon.
Gave structure to an undefined road.
The sun would hold the answer, but the moon revealed the truth.

Snow beautified the landscape, but the mud beneath remained.
The light made me familiar with the beauty.
But again it's the sun that melted it all to nothing.
