I see someone I know, I knew.
But who seems a stranger now.
Maybe it's only me who changed you.
Gave you a new place in my heart.

As I close my eyelids firmly.
I picture the day my heart has killed you.
The echoes of lost feelings find my heart less frequent.

The fear of loneliness, eager to believe.
The fear of loneliness, caused the pain.
Am I willing to give it all?
Am I capable to love?
