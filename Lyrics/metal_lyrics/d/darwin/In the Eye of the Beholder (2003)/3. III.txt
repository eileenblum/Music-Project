The beauty made me bitter.
The warmth has made me cold.
The storm has made me silent.
Love has made me hate.

Colours of a grey existence.
Sounds of a silent past, tear me apart.

A silent acceptation of bitterness,
From the shadow where I stand.

An ash-grey sky drenched with many questions.
An unintruded cycle it is it was it will be.
