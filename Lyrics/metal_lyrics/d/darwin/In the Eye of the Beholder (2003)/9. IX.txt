What exactly was it that attracted me.
I repeat the name, that matched a face, still can't remember, what it was I fell for.

Swallow twisted wires, to deny the seperation, the feeling, the attempt, the escape.

I gave up, I failed at every point, knowing I'll repeat, makes it even worse.

Read and laugh, come on refuse to understand, my identity, captured in my fingerprints all over you...
