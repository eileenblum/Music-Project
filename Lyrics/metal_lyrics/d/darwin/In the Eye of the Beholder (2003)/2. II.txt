For you'd whispered in a willing ear, and cried an eager shoulder.
Knowing what I know now. Hate becomes justified

Camouflage your weary eyes, a glisten in a quiet night.
The reflections of the moon, rolling down your cheek.

Wrapped barbed wire around my heart.
To be sure you'd leave a scar.

If only I could erase what rewinds me.
If only I could erase what reminds me.
If only I could cross out your name.
Cross out the name that rewinds me.

Can a man survive the lack of water?
Can a heart pomp merely dust?
Can a man survive the lack of air?
Can lungs breathe merely dust?
