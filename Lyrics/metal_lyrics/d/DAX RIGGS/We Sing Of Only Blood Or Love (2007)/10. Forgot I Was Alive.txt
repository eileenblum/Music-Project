They took they drugs and left
You stranded down in Mexico
Half-formed wandering the desert
You had blood on your soul
But what did ya know
I been told blood makes the grass grow
Baby what do ya know
You got to let it roll
But what would I know?

I know how high the grass will grow
We'll leave our skins outside the door
It will be like it was before
I forgot I was alive

What do ya know
I been told blood makes
The grass grow baby
What do ya know
Ya got to let it roll
But what would I know?
I forgot I was alive
