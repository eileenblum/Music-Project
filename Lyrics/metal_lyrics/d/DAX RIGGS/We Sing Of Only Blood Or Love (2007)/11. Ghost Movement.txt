Gonna lay with a ghost by my side
Let the birds take to the sky
Gonna try and drown or drink
The river dry
May the ghost lay by my side
And the flowers will bloom
If you want them to
We spoke upon the stars up in the night
How'd you ever get so high
Gonna try and drown
Or drink the river dry
May the ghost lay by my side
And the flowers will bloom
If you want them to
Kissed a blue girl
While it rained broken glass
Rode a bolt of white light
With Satan on my lap
Everything is happening in the dark
And everything is happening all at once
Do we haunt the hearts of god
My love I bet ya haunt the heart
Of god my love
