Night is the notion
Everything sleeps beneath
We are the explosion
In which lies the dream
Maybe I will, maybe I won't
Maybe it dies or maybe baby it don't
Night is the notion
So I count the stars
In my dark cup and forget this all
Lord I can't believe
The earth ain't swallowing us yet
The earth ain't swallowing us yet
We are the explosion
We are the explosion
Night is the notion
We are the explosion
We are the explosion
We are the explosion
