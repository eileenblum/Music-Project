Along the highway
And the graveyard lines
Have mercy on the devil
He's a friend of mine
Sometimes
Dancing this phantom up
And down my spine
Have mercy on the devil
He's a friend of mine
Sometimes sometimes sometimes
We are living this suicide
If god looked upon us
It would surely leave us blind
Surely leave us blind
This living is suicide
Living is suicide
