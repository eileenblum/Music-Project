Got this shadow in my shoes
Got this blackness in my blues
If we're lost, how can we lose
You're askin' me, I'm askin' you

Scarlet of heaven nor hell
Scarlet of heaven nor hell
No rapture will do it now
Scarlet of heaven nor hell

Got this sparrow in my skull
A madness in its bones
If we're lost, how can we lose
You're askin' me, I'm askin' you
