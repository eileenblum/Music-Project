Nothing below or above
We sing of only blood or love
Nothing below or above
We sing of only blood or love
We sing of only blood or love
Can I only tell the truth in the dark?
Do I only exist in your heart?
Today there is no sun
Maybe there never was
Headless queen of gutter doom
Has locked inside a rented room
The phantom of the climbing vine
Buried in sunshine
Invert it but you know it's divine
We sing of only blood or love
We sing of only blood or love
