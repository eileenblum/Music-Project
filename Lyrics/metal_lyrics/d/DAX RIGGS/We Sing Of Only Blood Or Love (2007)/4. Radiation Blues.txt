Bury this and the rhythm of breath, there is only death
Maybe you're dead and ya just don't know
A shadow dressed only in sorrow
Tomorrow might not exist and ya should've been dead
Should've been dead like ten times over
Like ten times over
Should've been dead like ten times over
By the hand of your lover
By the side of the river should've been dead
Bury this song and the rhythm of breath
There is only death
There is only death, only death
These radiation blues sister
Gonna make me true
Movin' through the bones of you
These radiation blues
Movin', movin', movin', movin'
