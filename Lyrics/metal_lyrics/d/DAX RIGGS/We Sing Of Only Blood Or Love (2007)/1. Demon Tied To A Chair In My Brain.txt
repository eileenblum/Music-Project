Demon tied to a chair in my brain
Blackbird a tappin' on the window pane
Sick man smilin' at a stray dog in the rain
Demon tied to a chair in my brain
Demon tied to a chair in my brain
Lovers burnin' ghostly draggin' their chains
Met eyes from the window
Of that midnight train
Demon tied to a chair in my brain
Demon tied to a chair in my brain
Demon tied to a chair in my brain
Mad shriekin' woman weepin' my name
My skeleton is meltin'
My soul is in flames
Demon tied to a chair in my brain
