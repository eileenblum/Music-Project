We knew the devil's hands
We wish the king was dead
How we waltzed upon the tombs
Down at the carnival
I'm a black clown
In this prison rodeo
Struttin' like a dog-headed whore
Hopin' the moon explode
Hopin' the moon explode
Hopin' the moon explode
Little spider left for Germany
There's a hell of a whole lot of stars
Between you and me
Bless those black boots
That I kneel before
Struttin' like a dog-headed whore
Hopin' the moon explode
Hopin' the moon explode
Hopin' the moon explode
