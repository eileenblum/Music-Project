The wilderness and all its thorns
Tangled up around my horns
I ain't got time to die tonight
Climbing the stars
Into the midnight hours
The serpent is eating itself

My heart is on fire
With its death and desire
I ain't got time to die
Climbing the stars
Into the midnight hours
The serpent is eating itself

The serpent is eating itself
The serpent is eating itself

Tonight I ain't got time to die
