I hate, you hate - we all hate!!

Hate on the streets, school death increase
On the rise, crack suicide
Pre-teens with guns, perverted nuns, this life I hate it all!!
Blood in the east, western disease
Honest charities, rest in peace
Politician scum, fucking everyone, this life I hate it all!!

I hate, you hate - we all hate

Fathers teaching sons, hate the different ones
religious lies, brainwashed minds
That is the way kids are brought up today, this life - I hate it all!!
I hate you hate - we all hate!
Forgive me if I seem bitter
Forgive me if I seem cold
I've taken all that I'm gonna take
So leave me, leave me alone

[Solo]

I hate, you hate - we all hate!!

Girlfriend's a slut, I've had enough
Two faced friends appear again
That's their mistakes, maybe one day
Give me a gun, shot everyone
Pay back's a bitch, dirty tricks
End up in jail with no bail
On death row, you never know, this life - I hate it all!!
I hate, you hate
I hate, you hate
I hate, you hate
I hate, you hate - we all hate!!
