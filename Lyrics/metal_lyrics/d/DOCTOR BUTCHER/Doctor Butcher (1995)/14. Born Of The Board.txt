[bonus track]

I sit and stare upon my trembling hand,
as it starts to move once again
Still I wonder why, is this all a lie,
what does this all mean?

Midnight the board awaits in a circle on the floor
Many sins held within, many pleasures to behold

Life's, Hell, Birth, Death
Cast before my eyes
Spirits spelling out my fate
In a world that doesn't lie

It's like being crucified
No priest speaks my last rights
I can't pretend it,
I must confess it, no!

[Chorus:]
Born of the Board
As I lay me down to rest
Born of the Board
Will I sleep in peace tonight?

Come! Forth! Spirits!
I have summoned you

Give me pleasure, give me pain
Ya know, round and round and round it goes,
where it stops no one knows
Such a twisted game to play!

It's like being crucified.
No priest speaks my last rights
I can't pretend it,
I must confess it, no

[Chorus:]
Born of the Board
As I lay me down to rest
Born of the Board
Will I sleep in peace tonight?
