Sacrifice your life, working your way to the top of the ladder
Just a slave to the worlds decay
No way out, need a stiff drink just to get through the day
You can say

[Chorus:]

The Picture's Wild
The Picture's Wild
The Picture's Wild
The Picture's Wild, Wild, Wild

Everything's a rip off, everyone's uptight
Fucked up generation still can't get it right
Every G-Damn move you make is on file
You can say

[Chorus]

Terrorism, communism, on the streets every day
You can see it on the evening news, it's the way of the world
Can't take it, never will, it's life as we know it
You can say

[Chorus]
