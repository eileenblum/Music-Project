It's every man for himself now
That's the way it's gonna be
A nation armed and ready
Civil war that's sure to be
In a fitire as things just keep going on
Young people dies in the future for children

[Chorus:]

All for one, none for all
All for one, none for all - No none at all

It's a world of confusion
Got to look out for number one
If you don't no one else will
Leaves you under the gun
Alone you stand, a shadow by your side
On your face I can see the misfortune

[Chorus]
