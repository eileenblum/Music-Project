[bonus track]

Time after time I thought I saw this strange machine
A vision in black that appeared from a smoke filled dream
Terror - he play tricks with the mind
Murder - is there a killer to find?
I wanna know who it can be

I was drivin' alone on my way back home
Inspecter Highway
In his cloak of black armed to attack he's looking my way
Blocking the way we come face to face and he's smiling
It's too late to turn, are you ready to burn
Inspector Highway

You know the road I'm on is a winding path some say it's a legend
Fogs rolls in, icy dreams of sin, too evil to mention
Terror - - he play tricks with the mind
Murder - is there a killer to find?
I wanna know who it can be

I was drivin' alone on my way back home
Inspecter Highway
In his cloak of black armed to attack he's looking my way
Blocking the way we come face to face and he's smiling
It's too late to turn, are you ready to burn
Inspector Highway

[Bridge]

I just wanna know if what I saw was real
Should I be afraid to find out
A figure in black with a gaze of death
You know he's pointing his finger at me
He's calling me, taunting me endlessly my destiny
I just wanna find my way back home
Will I ever find my way back home
