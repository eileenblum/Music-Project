Life of desperation that's his way
Searching for a light to shine today, but I know that I won't
help me Jesus can't you feel my pain
I'm so tired, twisted and insane, taken a look in my eyes

There's no living! Forgiving! God help me please!

[Chorus:]

I'm lost in the dark
I don't know which way I'm facing
I reach to feel my way, a life caught in the maze

[Solo]

There's no living! Forgiving! God help me please!

[Chorus x2]

Institution, no solution, this is destiny I know
Living, living, scared of dying, wondering where it is I'll go
Oh no, no no
Oh no, no no
Lost in the dark
Lost in the dark
