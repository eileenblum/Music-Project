People try to tell me, they're all telling lies
I can see right through their evil lies
Alway try to make me somethin' that I'm not
Preach! Preach! Preach! Will it ever stop

[Chorus:]

Don't Talk to Me - I don't want to talk about it
Don't Talk to Me - Leave me alone
Don't Talk to Me - I'm sick and sick and tired of your talk
Talk - Talk - Talk - FUCK YOU!!

Parents always fighting whenever I'm at home
I just lock myself inside my room
Put on something heavy to get me through the day
I sometime wish that I could go away

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Don't you ever push me, don't push me too far
I don't care who the hell you are

[Chorus]
