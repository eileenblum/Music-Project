I'm an innocent victim, I live in confusion
Everything that I see, I see through misery
Have a soul, I've lost control, I need a fix of anything
To ease my pain, keep me sane, help escape reality

I'm losing my way

I search for solutions, Instead I find dillusions
You see there are excuses for these self-inflicted abuses
Rehab failed and so did jail, this twisted fucked up life I lead
Chose no hope, who can cope, with this cruel insanity

I'm losing my way
I'm losing my way

Why doesn't anymore listen
Souls cries out in torment
Out on the streets I'm looking
For anything I can get
Why doesn't anymore help me
Doesn't anymore care
It's easy for me to see now
Life just ain't fair

[Solo]

I'm losing my way
I'm losing my way
