[bonus track]

Wish I never been born at all,
to this world that seems so cold
You know there must be another way,
to make things different than they are today.

Time slipping away,
What once was green is now burning away
It all comes back to you

[Chorus:]
All these Bridges lead the way
To the place that we all live today
Now the times have changed,
can't seem to get along
Noone's right, when everyone's wrong

Air pollution, no solution, ozone's ruined
Claiming a life everyday
Now you've got needles on the beach,
AIDS in the streets
No heroes left to save this dying day

Time slipping away,
What once was green is now burning away
It points the finger to you

[Chorus:]
All these Bridges lead the way
To the place that we all live today
Now the times have changed,
can't seem to get along
Noone's right, when everyone's wrong

I guess it's all been said before,
the answers lie behind the door
I guess it's really up to you,
to make it different than we already know

Time slipping away,
What once was green is now burning away
it's all up to you

[Chorus:]
All these Bridges lead the way
To the place that we all live today
Now the times have changed,
can't seem to get along
Noone's right, when everyone's wrong
