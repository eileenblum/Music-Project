[bonus track]

Late night minding my own business
Speeding down the highway to hell
I see lights in the rear view mirror
Red, white, blue I know 'em well

What's the problem officer?
Was I movin' just a bit too fast?
He says, "Get out of the car YOU FREAK,
I'm gonna kick your ass!!"

[Chorus:]
HELP! POLICE?
To serve and protect is what I was taught to believe
Well it's just a cover for the violence,
ruling the streets and you can't fight back
Don't make a move or you're sure to be attacked
HELP! POLICE?

"Up against the car you mother fucker,
put your hands up, spread your legs.
You have no rights, stay silent,
or I will kick your ass again!" and went ahead.

[Chorus:]
HELP! POLICE?
To serve and protect is what I was taught to believe
Well it's just a cover for the violence,
ruling the streets and you can't fight back
Don't make a move or you're sure to be attacked
HELP! POLICE?
