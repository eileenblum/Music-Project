Who's that calling on the phone
Leave me the mother fuck alone
I just need to get some sleep
I've been up for half a week
Watching night turn into day
Spending all my hard earned pay
On bitches, bills, this and that
Leave the phone where it's at

[Chorus:]

Reach out and torment someone
Reach out and show 'em you don't care
Reach out and torment someone
Reach out and show 'em you don't care

Credit cards are overdrawn
When I call that bitch she's never home
But when I'm swimming in the cash
She's always there to give me ass
Bought her clothes, fed her face
That's the price for getting laid
When I think I'm over it all
That's when I get that fucking call

[Chorus]

[Calls]

[Chorus x2]
