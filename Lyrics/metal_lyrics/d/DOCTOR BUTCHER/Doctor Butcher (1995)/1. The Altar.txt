The stained glass lights the way
On their knees the congregation prays
Collection plate is passed your way
Jesus looks down from sky
A tear fills his eyes
In the fires of hell you're all gonna pay

In the rectory basement of sin
A meeting read to begin
Something in the eyes says
Holy father, you're telling me lies
Searching - Mother Mary finds the tunnel of love
Touching - In the name of the lord above

[Chorus:]

Step Up - Up to the Altar
Kneel Down - Down on your knees and pray
Step Up - Up to the Altar
A priest - Is playing his organ again

Sacrificial bishop cracks the sky
Upon the altar a virgin lies
No hail Mary gonna save you now
Looking - For choir girls and boys
Hoping - He just want a brand new toy

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
