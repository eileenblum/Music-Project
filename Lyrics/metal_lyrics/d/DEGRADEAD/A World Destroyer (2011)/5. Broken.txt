Destroy my idea, of a perfect
World that we could live in

That day, may never exist
Close your eyes to nothing

Still fear, all love has gone
No, but I only see we must die

When I see my own soul, I go through internal war
See I have a lost love, I cry for the broken home
Go through internal war

I feel now, is the time
Your blood has been shed for a reason

Fight back, for life it self
Take back what is truly yours

Still fear, all love has gone
No, but I only see we must die

When I see my own soul, I go through internal war
See I have a lost love, I cry for the broken home
Go through internal war

When I see my own soul, I go through internal war
See I have a lost love, I cry for the broken home

But I only see we must die

When I see my own soul, I go through internal war
See I have a lost love, I cry for the broken home
Go through internal war
