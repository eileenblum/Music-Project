Back down from the position you make
The righteous mark, is to be left here alone

No more, we are the last bloodline left
Blasphemy, it has been what we create

Buried alive
Suffocation a fact
Let us decide
We all shall burn

Fall down, let the apocalypse come
About to rise, we are the ones who shall swarm

ItÂ´s time, the hour has come to repent
Remember then,it was in cold blood

We could have been saved, instead we all choose
To take the wrong path, a world destroyer

Polluted our minds, now itÂ´s going away
We did it in cold blood
I need a new start, I know thereÂ´s a way
I fear itÂ´s too late, fear itÂ´s too late

Now come, the age of a putrid disease
The fire reign, let us evolve into dust

Stand tall, try to be proud of our world
Remember then,it was in cold blood

We could have been saved, instead we all choose
To take the wrong path, a world destroyer

Polluted our minds, now itÂ´s going away
We did it in cold blood
I need a new start, I know thereÂ´s a way
I fear itÂ´s too late, fear itÂ´s too late

Accept, we have been betrayed
What do you think that your life is Worth

Freddo sangue Che scorre

Polluted our minds, now itÂ´s going away
We did it in cold blood
I need a new start, I know thereÂ´s a way
I fear itÂ´s too late, fear itÂ´s too late
