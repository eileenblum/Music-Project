Grace denied, a lifeform ceases to exist
Kneel down before me, your life is through

Prepare for the final judgement, your time is now

Feel afraid, we all have been there before
Know that you owe us, the faith in fear

ItÂ´s like it all, has never, been clear, the primal fear
No, forever, lie buried in, a primal fear

Prepare for the final judgement, your time is now

Come below, a sense of hope you might feel
One thing you might know, your godgiven right to shed fear

Prepare for the final judgement, your time is now

ItÂ´s like it all, has never, been clear, the primal fear
No, forever, lie buried in, a primal fear

Give in, to your anger
Give in, to your hate

Give in, to your senses
Give in, to your fear, to your fear

Realize, the anger folds, after we, pocess control

Prepare for the final judgement, your time is now

ItÂ´s like it all, has never, been clear, the primal fear
No, forever, lie buried in, a primal fear
