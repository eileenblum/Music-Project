Completing, a perfect life
The nature, of insanity

The nature of insanity

Producing and throwing up lies
Make sense, destructive ways

Hold on, it comes to an end, it comes to end
Believe youÂ´ll descend                 
Living a lie, prepare, time is slipping away, away

Bring focus, the pain is real
A bleeding world, climactic force

The time has come, create a different choice in life

Hold on, it comes to an end, it comes to end
Believe youÂ´ll descend                 
Living a lie, prepare, time is slipping away

Consider, a thruthfull will
Fading, away to nothing

Appealing, to stay behind
Fatal flaws, fatal flaws

Certain fate, draws near behold
Happiness, it lasts no more, no more

So hold on, it comes to an end, it comes to end
Believe youÂ´ll descend                 
Living a lie, prepare, time is slipping away
