Bind yourself to me, can you spot the lies
Take your final breath, weÂ´re out of time

Come down now, this is your destiny
Look around, this is the end

You are near the end
We have been lost before, we try to fight some more
Now take your step trough the door and go for

The unknown is the fear, thatÂ´s eating away on your comfort
Know that itÂ´s clear, must be, there are no more regrets

Come down now, this is your destiny
Look around, this is the end

You are near the end
We have been lost before, we try to fight some more
Now take your step trough the door and go for the unknown

Hold on, the light is coming
Get used to a different setting
Fight on, keep on pushing
Yourself to a higher ground

Come down now, this is your destiny
Look around, this is the end

You are near the end
We have been lost before, we try to fight some more
Now take your step trough the door and go for the unknown

Just go, dont hesitate, just go
ThereÂ´s no way of stopping your fate
