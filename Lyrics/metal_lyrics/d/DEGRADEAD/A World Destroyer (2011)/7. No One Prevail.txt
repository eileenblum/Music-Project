Saviour, take me now
I feel lost in confusion
Find out, reach out
There are no exceptions

Be pure and keep yourself together
I stand alone
Find out, reach out
The broken promise

Because the truth has struck us all, a present fear prevail
Know youÂ´re not the one, still figuring out the last call

The final strike, no one will prevail
Nobody stands alone we are strong
Call, the final strike, no one shall be saved
Give it your best protect the survival

Infection, a cure within
It keeps spreading among us
Find out, reach out
There are no exceptions

And so we come this, our ending
A lost control
Find out, reach out
The broken promise

Because the truth has struck us all, a present fear prevail
Know youÂ´re not the one, still figuring out the last call

The final strike, no one will prevail
Nobody stands alone we are strong
Call, the final strike, no one shall be saved
Give it your best protect the survival

Slaying, before my eyes
Burning, the image stay

Bleeding, eternal pain
Freezing, complete collapse

The last call, the final strike, no one will prevail
Nobody stands alone we are strong
Call, the final strike, no one shall be saved
Give it your best protect the survival
