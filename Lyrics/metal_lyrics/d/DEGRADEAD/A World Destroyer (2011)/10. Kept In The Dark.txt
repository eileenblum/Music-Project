By now all you should be dead, no pride in denial
Now beg me, I see clear, a fallen shall rise

Make it all the way, sacrifice
Death is here to stay, thereÂ´s no escape

Save me from myself, become the lie
Save me before I die

Spend your life making it count, each breath will be cruicial 
Keep searching find what you seek, live in the moment

Make it all the way, sacrifice
Death is here to stay, thereÂ´s no escape

Save me from myself, become the lie
Save me before I die, before I die

Been dragged down for too long
Break loose from your chain
I wipe that smile of your face
I will wipe that smile of your face

Make it count, soon IÂ´m gone
Reaching out, save me now

Save me from myself, become the lie
Save me before I die, before I die

Vishnu is trying to persuade the prince, that he should do his duty, and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds'.
