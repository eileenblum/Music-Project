Lost control, an urge for sickening acts
Selfinflicted pain, you have no choice

Become alive, detach your soul and burn
Extend your hand, reach out to me

We are known, as degradead
They are known, as the ones who degrade themselves

Can you, can you, feel the fall, beyond your call
Can you, persevere stand stall, it will kill us all

Create your light, no aid is coming for you
Poison in your veins, set it free

Clouded judgement, society's last resort
Destroy the barrier, must stand your ground

We are known, as degradead
They are known, as the ones who degrade themselves

Can you, can you, feel the fall, beyond your call
Can you, persevere stand stall, it will kill us all

Weakness, the sorrow
Weakness, the sorrow

Can you, can you feel the fall, beyond your call
Can you, persevere stand stall, it will kill us all
