Im just a slave for, fate and a daily hatred
No way out of my misery, thereÂ´s nothing, nothing at all
That gets me, on the right path, I am lost

Give up on us, you have no choice
Take me away, it is over, it is over

No one knows, no one cares
About us, our hate will be there
Find yourself, youÂ´re part of the system
Our hope has been taken away

ItÂ´s just so hopeless, try and find the dark
Scream for help, no one hears you
Helpless, lying on the ground
Beaten, youÂ´re loosing the battle

Give up on us, you have no choice
Take me away, it is over, it is over

No one knows, no one cares
About us, our hate will be there
Find yourself, youÂ´re part of the system
Our hope has been taken away,away

You have been comprimised

Take my dream
Take my soul
My soul, out of control
My soul, out of control

React to my response
Feel the hate, itÂ´s storming in
Watch your back, no return

No, feeding me lies
No, fear in the eyes

Give up on us, you have no choice
Take me away, it is over, it is over

No one knows, no one cares
About us, our hate will be there
Find yourself, youÂ´re part of the system
Our hope has been taken away

No one knows, no one cares
About us, our hate will be there
Find yourself, youÂ´re part of the system
Our hope has been taken away, taken away
