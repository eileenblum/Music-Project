ItÂ´s been a pleasure, watching you fail
Pathetic lie caused you to make misstakes and fail

No more disgusting pain, youÂ´re a failure
Pain, kept us alive with grace, youÂ´re reviving

Out there we have the chance, to become what we want

We deserve that fate, and itÂ´s not too late
We can still make time, the gavelÂ´s falling

ItÂ´s not so easy, changing the nature
Destruction, come and see the evil in us fail

No more disgusting pain, youÂ´re a failure
Pain, kept us alive with grace, youÂ´re reviving

Out there we have the chance, to become what we want

We deserve that fate, and itÂ´s not too late
We can still make time, the gavelÂ´s falling

I will break you down
There is no more time to waste, this is the right moment

Out there we have the chance, to become what we want

We deserve that fate, and itÂ´s not too late
We can still make time, the gavelÂ´s falling

We deserve that fate, and itÂ´s not too late
We can still make time, the gavelÂ´s falling down
