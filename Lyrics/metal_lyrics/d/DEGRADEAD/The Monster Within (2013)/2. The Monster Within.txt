I've been extradiated to madness
With all my demons within
They're reaching out from the subconscious
Pulling me slowly down

Into the pit of depression
Where all I know is hate
Forgetting all what love is
And I know this is my fate

Without you, one part is missing
The emptiness inside, makes me insane
Without you, one part is missing
The emptiness inside, makes me unleash
The monster within

You have been gone for so long
It has taken me
You have been gone for so long
It has taken me

Anger and despair
Anxiety and pain
Only you could heal the damage
Only you can hear a dead mans cries

Without you, one part is missing
The emptiness inside, makes me insane
Without you, one part is missing
The emptiness inside, makes me unleash
The monster within
