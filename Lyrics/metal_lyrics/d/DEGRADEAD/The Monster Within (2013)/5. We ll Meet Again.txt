My lime has passed and you're gone
Leaves has fallen at last
The wind has started to whisper

Still, I am never alone
I take my breathe and go on
Visit me in my dreamland

Think, think of all that we have
I pass it on to my own
The bond will never be broken

Sleep, we will meet in the end
My memories we will share
Endless love you have given

You have not forsaken me
You are always in my dreams
I get my strength from you
Your light has passed me right through

Don't understand why you left
Nurture me with your love
Hollow shell need it's guidance

Reach, reaching out to the stars
A better world in the void
As long as you stay among them

You have not forsaken me
You are always in my dreams
I get my strength from you
Your light has passed me right through
