Leave me be get so sick of demanding ghosts
Have no right to he buried within

Fuck it all, and fuck all of you
Who destroys when it's me against the world
Fight on my own

All this time, that I'm wasting on you
No more cries

All my foes will drag me down
Let it happen this time around

Got no more to waste on you
Shadows face is shining through

When I fall, in the same
Pattern of lies

Don't believe in the words that you're telling me
I'm so sick of your false identity

Face the facts, I hate what I've found
No remorse, I see you for

What you really are, a parasite
Living to die alone

Make no more mistakes, ready to strike
Enemies down with force

All this time, that I'm wasting on you

No more cries
All my foes will drag me down
Let it happen this time around

Got no more to waste on you
Shadows face is shining through

Rise above and let go
A right decision

Face my fears and let it show
My own precision

All this time, that I'm wasting on you
No more cries

All my foes will drag me down
Let it happen this time around

Got no more to waste on you
Shadows face is shining through

I release, my storm
Never again shall I fall
