Destroy, my shattered fear
A sanction beneath me upholds you
Feast on, the global losses
You're frozen in time

And as I see we are no more

I, know that you're no one
I want to be
All of your failures
Will set me free
Set me free

As I've found out, most of you
Don't even believe in your power
Crumbles, all I see
Pathetic excuse

Lifeless, what you've become
Fight back for your will to be stronger
Breathless, drown while breathing
I'm lost in your light
And as I see, we are no more

I, know that you're no one
I want to be
All of your failures
Will set me free
Set me free

Dying out, while most alive
Dreams take over, inside the dark mind

Never, do it again, another battle
You will fall, you will fall
You will fall alone

I, know that you're no one
I want to be
All of your failures

Will set me free
