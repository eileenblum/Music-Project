Never believed in all the pain that you're causing me
Having an urge that someday you will set me free

Can't you see that you're always afraid
While creating reality

Crave, a stronger source and a direct link to all
Lying before you now
No remorse fighting the urges inside
Lie fallen while facing your fears

Drown in your fear
I face your hate

Never thought I would stay and no one fades away
In all the shades of grey, with my scars of misery-

Grabbing the loss and trying to fight through my blinding shame
Beating me down getting so sick of your frightening game
Can't you see I have lost through your will
Stand alone by my burning fear

No, don't accept keeping an eye out for self perception
I see it clear
Carry the weight of the truth that prevail
The path is gone and it's growing more narrow

Never thought I would stay and 50 one fades away
In all the shades of grey, with my scars of misery

Drawn to, lightning fast explosions
Mercy, finding the righteous inside

Never thought I would stay and no one fades away
In all the shades of grey, with my scars of misery
