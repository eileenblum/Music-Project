I fall behind, the darkness takes me
Feel lost in time, no wounds and I still bleed

My scars, they never heal
And my fire, keep closing in

Fortunate, I'm fortunate
To keep my heart, to keep my heart within

I am hiding the pain
Know all to well the story

And am I going insane?
Commit to the glory

The stars die out, my flame in motion
The needless shout, while fading to grey

My scars, they never heal
And my fire, keep closing in

Fortunate, I'm fortunate
To keep my heart, to keep my heart within

I am hiding the pain
Know all to well the story

And am I going insane?
Commit to the glory

Close your eyes
Believe the lie
Say your prayers

Been told to die

My scars, they never heal
And my fire, keep closing in

Fortunate, I'm fortunate
To keep my heart, to keep my heart within

I am hiding the pain
Know all to well the story

And am I going insane?
Commit to the glory
