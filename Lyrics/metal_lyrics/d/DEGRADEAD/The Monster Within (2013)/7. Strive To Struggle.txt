Bleed out, a darkened beast awakens
Inside you can feel it caving in
You've lost me, beyond all the

Thoughts of, consuming energy I'm weak
Release an overflow of hate
Don't need the burning inside

I never thought I would need
Nothing leaves today
Never listen to me

No one stays, when I fall
My fate will reign, I fall

I find all my anger running through me
Calling out to war prepare to fight
I will see, bleeding dying

Kill all, the greed that walks around you
Nothing ever stays the same
Keep up while I am falling behind

I never thought I would need
Nothing leaves today
Never listen to me

No one stays, when I fall
My fate will reign I fall
I fall

Promised a lie
My time to die

I, have another path to find
The murder will continue until
You can see the righteous sign
I'm screaming for a helping hand

My Swallow the fear

Take you in and spit you out
Know for sure what you're about
Leave me be lm sick you
Tell me what I have to do

I never thought I would need
Nothing leaves today
Never listen to me

No one stays, when I fall
My fate will reign I fall
I fall
