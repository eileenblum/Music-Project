Destroy
Going insane over the thoughts that bringing me down
The evil madness, leave me alone

Feeling the pain, rising above, and rather I die
Than living through this, hell I create

The changes will never come, until you are ready for them
Look beyond the fate, time to decide

And now, the dead becomes alive
And I, I'm falling behind
Walking the earth

Fall out, into battle
Inside, taking over
Wallow, in the ashes
Bloodlust, stay forever

Dealing with hate, nobody knows, except for the damned
Ripping my heart out, the final abuse

Choosing the path, leading to death, blinded by you
Growing more tired, of living a lie

And now, the dead becomes alive
And I, I'm falling behind

I have a lust to bring control, sanctify my life and go
Say no more just know, the truth revealed as an answer
