Cry out into a de.id new world
An empty space that lilies a blackened void
Die out, extinction masks itself
The Wrath has come to take the murdered soul

By the power in me
I'll set you free
The darkest of time creeps in

Blind leading the lost
Deceived by the cross
The era of might is here

I fight the demons grip, the sorrows force sets in
One sorrow that obey, who never will betray

Clawing, scratch the wall within
Espace a thought to be replaced once more
Fire bums the empty shell
I.eft in ash the sorrow burning black

By the power in me
I'll set you free
The darkest of time creeps in

Blind leading the lost
Deceived by the cross
The era of might is here

I fight the demons grip, the sorrows force sets in
One sorrow that obey, who never will betray
Sorrow that never betrays
