So now you've shown yourself
The truth I sec you struggling with
Another pain

And now you've realized
You are not eternally blessed
Another hate

Praise us all
For I am not you're sin
One of those
Sins arc closing in

Trapped with locked emotions
Waiting on that day
Where I'm still in motion
Inside my fear I stay

Stand still can't move at all
A freezing power taking over
My broken will

Praise us all
For I am not you're sin
One of those
Sins are closing in

Trapped with looked emotions
Waiting on that day
Where I'm still in motion
Inside my fear I stay

As I feel my body
Shrivelled up into pieces

Can't take anymore
The tight in me has gone
My inner light
Consumed by your hatred

Praise us all
For I am nut you're sin
One of those

Sins are closing in
Trapped with locked emotions
Waiting on that day
Where I'm still in motion
Inside my fear I stay
