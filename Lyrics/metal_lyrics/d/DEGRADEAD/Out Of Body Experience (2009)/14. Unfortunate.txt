The meadowâs green, with no concern in mind
Well you canât forget, all our past time 

Never again will I reason, you are an fucking disgrace too
Always and ever I think you should go and take your life, youÂ´re through

I have no lust to fear again, Iâm not your friend
Who do you really think I am

Itâs Unfortunate, unfortunate
Unfortunate, unfortunate

Thought you knew it all, you got it all so wrong
Got nothing but contempt, suffered too long

I hate this feeling that slowly consume and makes my body cold
You had no right to betray me, itâs too late your soul is sold

I have no lust to fear again, Iâm not your friend
Who do you really think I am

Itâs Unfortunate, unfortunate
Unfortunate, unfortunate

Itâs fucking unfortunate, unfortunate
Unfortunate, unfortunate

ItÂ´s Unfortunate, unfortunate
Unfortunate, unfortunate

ItÂ´s fucking unfortune, unfortunate
Unfortunate, unfortunate
