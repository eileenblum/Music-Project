Wasting my time on the wrong, situations and
Fading away into oblivion, some people are the same and some are not

This part is too heavy, to carry on
With the same over again, just set me free

They are, not complete
We are, so much more

I, donât even want to know it all
Future is now, keep your head up high
And preserve the moment

Lucky to still be alive, for what Iâve done
May not recover at all, think twice again before you act

You may not live, to see the end
Days are growing number, increasing at a scary rate I hate it

They are, not complete
We are, so much more

I, donât even want to know it all
Future is now, keep your head up high
And preserve the moment

Chaos, it all slips away
Fear, is closing in on me

Mercy, begging for it, please leave me be
Give me time, give me time to heal
