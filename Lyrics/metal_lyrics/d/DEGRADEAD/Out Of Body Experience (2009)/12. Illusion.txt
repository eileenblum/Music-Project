Existence, eradicate us all
We have this problem, I can see clear the solution

Bow down, to your king and queen
They are the ruler, of the spirit world

Stand up for the chance, to own your exclusive right
Dig deep for your turn, to be more than an Illusion

Illusion

Sanctify, your reality and pray
For a better reason, never to stop for another

Bow down, to your king and queen
They are the ruler, of the spirit world

Stand up for the chance, to own your exclusive right
Dig deep for your turn, to be more than an Illusion

Illusion

Be proud for all of time
Never give up your right
