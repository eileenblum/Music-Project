Searching for my way home, lost in the depths of darkness
Never seem to find, the right road to salvation

Will not try to face, this world alone
Constant fear of mutual, anxiety locked in me

Screaming, why am I left here unheard
Days have just gone by without me being heard

Oh, I ask, why am I left here unheard
The time, have passed me by

Never understood, how it all could be this way
All alone in my thoughts, pressing self-destruct

Screaming, why am I left here unheard
Days have just gone by without me being heard

Oh, I ask, why am I left here unheard
The time, have passed me by

Days have just gone by, without the chance to give a try
Sent to another world, just hate this state of mind

Days have just gone by, without the chance to give a try
Sent to another world, help me before I die

Screaming, why am I left here unheard
Days have just gone by without me being heard

Oh, I ask, why am I left here unheard
The time, have passed me by
