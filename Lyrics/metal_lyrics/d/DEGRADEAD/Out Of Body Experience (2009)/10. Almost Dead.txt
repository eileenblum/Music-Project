Dreaming, Iâm lost again
Screaming, lost in the chaos and the essence of time

I am, nothing more
Nothing more than I want to be

Canât fight back
I am a failure, trying to find my way back home

Now, stuck in this time
Stay for more, youâre almost dead

Pay, pay for your crime, and feel sublime
Youâre almost dead

Dreaming, Iâm lost again
Screaming, lost in the chaos and the essence of time

I am, nothing more
Nothing more than I want to be

Canât fight back
I am a failure, trying to find my way back home
Lost the track

Now, stuck in this time
Stay for more, youâre almost dead

Pay, pay for your crime, and feel sublime
Youâre almost dead

Lost in the chaos and the essence of time

Canât fight back
I am a failure, trying to find my way back home

Now, stuck in this time
Stay for more, youâre almost dead

Pay, pay for your crime, and feel sublime
Youâre almost dead
