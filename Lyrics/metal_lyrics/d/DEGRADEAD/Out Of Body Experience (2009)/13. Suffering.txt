Suffering, suffer a thousand deaths
All I have, go down

All the pain, pain that Iâm bleeding out
All my heart, go down

Why donât you believe I am your fate
Why donât you believe I am your fate

Why

Itâs always coming back again

The same connection to your fear
A fallen creation drawing near

The same connection to your fear

Suffering, suffer a thousand deaths
All I have, go down

All the pain, pain that Iâm bleeding out
All my heart, go down

Why donât you believe I am your fate
Why donât you believe I am your fate

Why

Itâs always coming back again

The same connection to your fear
A fallen creation drawing near

The same connection to your fear
The only way weÂ´re going now is there

Why, donât you go down

Same

The same connection to your fear
A fallen creation drawing near

The same connection to your fear
The only way weÂ´re going now is there
