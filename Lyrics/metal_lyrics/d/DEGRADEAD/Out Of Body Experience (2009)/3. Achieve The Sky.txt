Incarnation, feeds my youth
Repulsive halo attached

Suffocation, gasping for air
Trying to take one last breath

Why do you, deny?
Why do you, deny?

My Salvation, lies within you 
Past your body and mind

The Differential, that separates us
Makes us believe we are free

Why do you, deny?
Why do you, deny?

Why are you, reaching for that sky
And searching for higher ground

Which you canât deny
Follow your dreams

Reaching for that sky
And searching for higher the ground, which you canÂ´t deny

I am past this, behaviour of mine
Stuck in a vortex of reason

Have I missed, a part of the life
That stood there behind me for all of time

Why do you, deny?
Why do you, deny?

Why are you, reaching for that sky
And searching for higher ground

Which you canât deny
Follow your dreams

Reaching for that sky
And searching for higher the ground, which you canÂ´t deny

Can you set me free, from depression and aim for the light
You have the power, to give me a chance and a try

Why are you, reaching for that sky
And searching for higher ground

Which you canât deny
Follow your dreams

Reaching for that sky
And searching for higher the ground, which you canÂ´t deny
