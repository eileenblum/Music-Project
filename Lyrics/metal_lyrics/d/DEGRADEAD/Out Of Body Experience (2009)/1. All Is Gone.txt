Donât try to calm down, youâre worse then ever
You deserve to die, with a promising smile

Calm down

We have a reason, to take you away
Into a vanishing light, welcome to darkness

All is gone, weâre trapped forever
All is gone

We travel down , itâs not a distance to crawl
Stand up for your actions, never to cold
We breed a monster

You are the main guest, in a house of evil
Get overrun, by the naked souls

Calm down

We have a reason, to take you away
Into a vanishing light, welcome to darkness

All is gone, weâre trapped forever
All is gone

We travel down, itâs not a distance to crawl
Stand up for your actions, never to cold
We breed a monster

Youâre not alone, not anymore

Down, its not a distance to crawl
Stand up for your actions, never to cold
We breed a monster
