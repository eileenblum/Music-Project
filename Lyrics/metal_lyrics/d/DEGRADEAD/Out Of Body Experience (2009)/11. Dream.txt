Fighting to stay alive, each and every day
Time grabs hold, till the day I learn to let go

Days gone by, donât wake up, keep on, give a try
With your life

I give up, with my life
My dream is open for you

Stay, stay for a while
My dream has fallen through

Starting to understand, my mistakes and failures
Find your strength, itâs there but you have to find it

Days gone by, donât wake up, keep on, give a try
With your life

I give up, with my life
My dream is open for you

Stay, stay for a while
My dream has fallen through

Maybe someday I will be set free

I am so tired, just want to wake up
Out of this dream, feel so alone

I give up, with my life
My dream is open for you

Stay, stay for a while
My dream has fallen through
