I, donât know where to begin
With this story of mine

A total, eclipse, that draws me in
Try to blossom, instead I burn

My life is, the second best
Donât even try to rest

I change, into something worse
Stays forever more, I try to see the light
Oh I hate my shadow

I, tear myself apart for days
Have no reason to protect my putrid soul

Fade, away, with the light from ashes
Crawling back into my shell 

My life is, the second best
Donât even try to rest

I change, into something worse
Stays forever more, I try to see the light
Oh how I hate my shadow

I, have, no fear, Iâm not afraid to die

Never will be free, chain of hatred tightens
All slips away, broken hands of life

My life is, the second best
Donât even try to rest

I change, into something worse
Stays forever more, I try to see the light
Oh how I hate my shadow

I change, into something worse
Stays forever more, I try to see the light
My shadow stops me
