Hating to much, the worldâs going under
Sinking lowered level, weâre bleeding out

Fading away, youâve got to pay your respect

Doomed, to begin with
Fail, for eternity
I, am the everlasting hatred

Save yourself from others, itâs gone completely mad
Figure out the anger, your throwing stone in a glasshouse

Fading away, youâve got to pay your respect

Doomed, to begin with
Fail, for eternity
I, am the everlasting hatred

Front row seat, to your doom
The endless pit, drowns all our hope

Doomed, to begin with
Fail, for eternity
I, am the everlasting hatred

Itâs like murder, with out no crime
No one, sent to the jury

Killing, for all of time, we must pay our respect or we all die now
