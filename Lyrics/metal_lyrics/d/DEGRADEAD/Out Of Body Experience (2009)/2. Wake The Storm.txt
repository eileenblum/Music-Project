Victim, body, put to everlasting sleep
Voices, never, never  fail to earn itÂ´s keep

Rising, over, storming in you feel so bold
Feeding, frenzy, bloody hands are running cold

When I kill

IÂ´m losing it all, losing the fading call
A favour, struggle to keep your calm

Remember, never to lose it all
Wake the storm, ready to fall

Dream of, murder, scary thoughts are closing in
See no, further, feel the urge, commit the sin

Scream out, the pain, itÂ´s to hard to feel for you
Catch just, one look, realize my life is through

When I kill

IÂ´m losing it all, losing the fading call
A favour, struggle to keep your calm

Remember, never to lose it all
Wake the storm, ready to fall

Remorse, no more
Remorse, no more
