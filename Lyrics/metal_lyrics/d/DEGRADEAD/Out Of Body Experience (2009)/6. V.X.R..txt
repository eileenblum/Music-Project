Weâre going downhill, but never the less I fall
Into a never ending gap, carry on to hear my call

Open, are the gates to hell and awaits
The arrival of my soul, a deathgrip hold on me

Pain, all I have left is this pain
All I possess is my 

Pain, death, hate, all I have left is my destruction
V, X, R, violent extreme rage for you, for you

Weâre going downhill, but never the less I fall
Into to the trap you laid for me, an erratic path for us all

Open, is the guideline set for me
Being forced, I fail to repent, what do I have to see

Pain, all I have left is this pain
All I possess is my 

Pain, death, hate, all I have left is my destruction
V, X, R, violent extreme rage for you

Donât try to step on me, underestimate me
Who do you think you are?  I will kill you

I hate you so damn much, I hate you so damn much

Pain, all I have left is this pain
All I possess is my 

Pain, death, hate, all I have left is my destruction
V, X, R, violent extreme rage for you

For you, for you
