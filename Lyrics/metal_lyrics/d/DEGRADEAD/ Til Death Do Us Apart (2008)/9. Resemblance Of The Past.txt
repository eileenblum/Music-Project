You will not be answered
The question lies within
Timeline has been pushed
To the edge of eternity

There's no way to escape
From the past no way
To get out

Deliver it to them,
There's no complain
Deliver it to them
There's no complain

Nothing has been changed
Since the day that you were born
It's the resemblance of the past

There's no way to escape
From the past no way
To get out

Deliver it to them,
There's no complain
Deliver it to them
There's no complain

The chance of joy has disappeared
Time has given in

The days are labelled with no return
To an organized and normal world
The chance of joy has disappeared
Time has given in

Deliver it to them,
There's no complain
Deliver it to them
There's no complain

There is nothing, nothing in this world that could stop this
