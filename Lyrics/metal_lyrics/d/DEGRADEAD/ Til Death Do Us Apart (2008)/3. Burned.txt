Hell has broken lose, it's gone out of control
Worst pain that exists, my body and soul will die

FIRE
BURN
FIRE
DIE
My selfcontrol is gone, living in fear
Darkness is falling,
I am being burned
Because I can't stand this pain
I'm being burned

God you put me here through pain and misery
It's the work of evil,
It's the work of hell

FIRE
BURN
FIRE
DIE
My selfcontrol is gone, living in fear
Darkness is falling,
I am being burned
Because I can't stand this pain
I'm being burned

FIRE
BURN
FIRE
DIE
My selfcontrol is gone, living in fear
Darkness is falling,
I am being burned
Because I can't stand this pain
I'm being burned

All I have left is pain
The agony that has been caused by you is nothing compared to the fire
Hate me, hate me, hate me
I'm being burned
