The throne that I have is threatened by demons
They have arrived at my palace
My life is being hunted
Their eyes burn like fire
It's burning my presence
Enter the vicious circle
This is my end

When I pass away, my ending's being born
When I pass away,
When I pass away

The throne is taken by the devil himself
My palace's being burned
Life on earth is at risk
I fought him myself while you backed down
I saw him from my eyes
It's affecting my soul

When I pass away, my ending's being born
When I pass away,
When I pass away

Stand your post, possession gives in [x4]

When I pass away, my ending's being born
When I pass away
When I pass away
