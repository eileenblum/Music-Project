Remember the days of mine
When all of things were controlled
Chaos has entered your world
Look and see behold

I'm still here, while you turned your face away
On this horrifying day
Remember, that's what I said
It's the day of the dead

Fight it but there's no use
Sins are already made
Regrets is all that's stand straight
Fell the cold hearted blade

I'm still here, while you turned your face away
On this horrifying day
Remember, that's what I said
It's the day of the dead

Walking around that's what I said
It's the day of the dead

I'm still here, while you turned your face away
On this horrifying day
Remember, that's what I said
It's the day of the dead
