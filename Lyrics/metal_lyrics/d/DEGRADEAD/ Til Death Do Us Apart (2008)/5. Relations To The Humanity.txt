Ride the morning death, like your son
Your son, your child, the infant of your blood
DEATH ROW is coming up for him
He will bleed inside

Relations, to the humanity
Relations, to the humanity

Left at the altar with the rest of your gods
Stand there alone, abandoned of your soul
FIST DOWN been holding it for you
Take your breath and die

Relations, to the humanity
Relations, to the humanity

Standing at the edge of endless time
Abused my life is shattered
Aside, side by side with guilt
I will burn in hell

Relations, to the humanity
Relations, to the humanity
Relations, to the humanity
Relations, to the humanity
