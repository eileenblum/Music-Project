No one, will push me down
I am invincible, word goes around

Now I'm in charge again
Distant memories, they fade away

Slay your sorrows
And, take control

Destroy the horrors
And, take control

I am proud

Being fed, with all your bullshit
Sanctuary's near, joyful days must come

Hoping, for eternal joy
All the leaves, they must fall at once

Slay your sorrows
And, take control

Destroy the horrors
And, take control

I am proud

Do I live in a dream
It all makes me wanna scream
Get out

Slay your sorrows
And, take control

Destroy the horrors
And, take control

I am proud

Slay your sorrows
And, take control

Destroy the horrors
And, take control

I am proud
