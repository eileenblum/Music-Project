Falling down to the shadows
Laid the ground
For your own sake
Feel the cause of your death
Just plead and beg

Despair one explanation
Did you tumble on your way down
On your way down
I've laid my fear
Besides your dark grave
What are you craving for
Why?
Which part can you hear
There's only one answer
I carried the cross
I died for you

Bleed my blood take in the greed
For lust,
I'd kill you
With my bare hands waiting to pay
Decide your own way

Despair one explanation
Did you tumble on your way down
On your way down
I've laid my fear
Besides your dark grave
What are you craving for
Why?
Which part can you hear
There's only one answer
I carried the cross
I died for you

Pay strike you like a bomb
Pray for the good in this world
Decide the path you will take
Beside the grave you're stuck in
The grave you're stuck in

Despair one explanation
Did you tumble on your way down
On your way down
I've laid my fear
Besides your dark grave
What are you craving for
Why?
Which part can you hear
There's only one answer
I carried the cross
I died for you
