Never felt insecure
What's my disease?
Forever blinds there more?
Have I seen it all?
Show me where the world is
Feed me with all your lies
Chaos rising, the anger lives
Crushing the hard shell
Guide is now or forever ache
I've gone into lost worlds

Show me where the world is
Feed me with all your lies
Show me where the world is
Feed me with all your lies
I am reborn now
Reborn

Down on my knees
Show me the bloodstream of rage
Help us, we are lost in different worlds between us

Show me where the world is
Feed me with all your lies
Show me where the world is
Feed me with all your lies
I am reborn now
