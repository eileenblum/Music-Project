Daily routines, dissolve artistic concentration
Based on reality, pieces of life runs out

Start

Breathing
Save my soul
I produce toxic
Waste
Greet control
I clench my spirit inside

Generate a pulse, achievement always comes through trying
Rise up now, it still remains in a shadow

Start

Breathing
Save my soul
I produce toxic
Waste
Greet control
I clench my spirit inside

I feel, like I'm being sold
Same genetic slave

Collect, parts of the memory
Of the life I had before

Same genetic disease, across the globe
Spreading like a virus

Do you hold, the antidote
For all humankind

Start

Breathing
Save my soul
I produce toxic
Waste
Greet control
I clench my spirit inside
