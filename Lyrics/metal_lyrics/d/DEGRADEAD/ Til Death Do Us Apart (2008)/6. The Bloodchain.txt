The greedy take, your lives are being spilled
It's in the bloodchain, destiny's fullfilled
Sick, twisted minds, breeds the evil place
Anger is given, asking for grace

Stand by the rigid souls
Because there's nothing left for you
Only blood and hate
Because it's always in the bloodchain

You and me in the same position together
As one we stand, unite

Stand by the rigid souls
Because there's nothing left for you
Only blood and hate
Because it's always in the bloodchain

Stand by the rigid souls
Because there's nothing left for you
Only blood and hate
Because it's always in the bloodchain
