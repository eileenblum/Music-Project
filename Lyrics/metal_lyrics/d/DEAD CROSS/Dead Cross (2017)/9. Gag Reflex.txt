Be my war bride
Be my war bride
Be my war bride

Tampax

We can't remove the dark stain
An overdose of amor
Believe in what your gods say
A battle in vitro
We cannot stop the bleeding
Where fetuses roam
Suppress the gag reflex
Blehhhhhhhk

You're living inside the womb
Tampax Tampax

Yes please
Jesus police
Go
S&amp;M border patrol
Bible obedience school
You can't dig a ditch in Hell without burying a piece or yourself

The Jesus police
The Jesus police
The war brides screams

You're living inside the womb
We're dying outside soon
You're living inside the womb
We're dying outside

Sobredosis de amor
A battle in vitro
A loving war bride

Yes please
Jesus police go
Yes please
Jesus police
Yes please
Jesus police
I'll make the silence screech like new tires on the street
I ain't gonna say a thing
Jesus police
Jesus police
Jesus police
Jesus police
War bride

Tampax
