The paperwork explosion
The paperwork explosion
A slob on a slab
A Vegas whale
Pimps and johns and patriot scum
We're an updated outdated ocean of chum
The paperwork explosion
The paperwork explosion

Now
Holiday shirts and your hedge fund ghosts
Modest earns
The paper burns
And green interns
Nobody learns as the office buildings blow

Explosion
The paperwork explosion
There will come a day when the righteous will laugh and rejoice
And with a pure voice
Bathe your feet in the wicked's blood
Explode
