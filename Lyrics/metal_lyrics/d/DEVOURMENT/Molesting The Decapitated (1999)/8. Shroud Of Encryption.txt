Scum fucking bitch, cum guzzling whore
eating the dick like a revolving door
you suck on my cock but don't swallow shit
your nothing but a worthless ass bitch

So you've been raped, beaten and stabbed
Body contorts, rip you in half
I defecate on your blood splattered mass
Defiling the corpse, suffer in death

Evisceration - rape the bloody whore
Ripped up body â now I crave for more
Endless suffering - I will rape you in the ass

Skin forsaken, bruised and naked
My hands are shaking, I will kill again

Stalking the dark shroud of night
to claim a victim for my crypt
severed heads decorate the lair
which I'm on with sin
Grinding chunks of flesh into
a red and meaty paste
Feasting on these bitches pieces
soothes my minds decay

Come unto me objects of mindlessness,
torture's too good for you [x3]

Read into my ghastly deeds
and encounter sickness
slaughter of disease filled whores
Filth this world don't need.
