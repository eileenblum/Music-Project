[Lyrics By: Ruben Rosas]

Claiming my next victim for a filthy feast
Nauseating hunger for human feces
These lesion ridden cunts mean nothing to me
But their bowels possess the key to my nourishment
Unhealthy hunger escalating from the stench
Fortified fudge packed full of nutrients
Sexually abusing nursing home patients
As they shit themselves
I gorge on the caustic mess

Violently consuming shit

Pulverizing my fist in your fuckin' face
Postmortally - I feast on the wastes of the fuckin' elderly
Crusty fuckin' filthy beings, consuming their contaminants
Undying love for the blackened fluids of stiffs,
Boiling blood and brains of my victims, bleed.

Necrocopromaniac, pestilential being
The sight of feces rockets me into a fuckin' frenzy
Haemorrhoidal veins rupture slick secretions
Upon my tongue, sanguinary analingus.
Sucking on their cunts till they burst,
How I love it when they bleed on me.
Fist fucking diseased anal cavities
Plunging blades into their skin till they've died.
skin desclamates and slips right the fuck off of your bones
feeling no regard for the lives of these handicapped fucks
these hundred year old pigs produce my reward, their bodily wastes
Killing is what keeps me sane
so I think ill just rip your fucking head clean off
Coprophagia
I kill motherfuckers everyday
let these hordes of dead fucks unite
To mutilate the human species,
I take pride in killing

Nothing will ever stop me - from fucking murdering
Upheaving these human stockpiles of brown sediment
Extremely aroused by the sight of fucking pain
Masturbating feverishly to the rhythm of their prayers
cumming on their infected bed sores

Rectally (Rectally)
Bleeding, I sodomize the elderly
Spewing (Spewing)
Rapidly (Rapitly), A bed pan bon-appetite

despoiling, despoilment
raping these elderly pieces of shit
while slobbering sewage how sweet it is
toothless and sick swallowing cum
my blistering pecker seeps
Plunging my vile uncircumcised dick, enter the Alzheimer's wound
Now my dicks wrapped with disease
What the fuck, my cock now bleeds

Haemorrhaging - Blood drips on my feet
Sticking to your encrusted sheets
Wallowing - In pools of steaming shit
Inhaling the stench of filthiness

Bleed for me

Terrorizing me
The elderly have turned against me
Slowly
They creep to me like filthy zombies
Old bitches sliding sewing needles in my dick
Scraping at my bowels, smearing shit on their dirty clits
Chewing on my filthy meat within
lacerating every inch of my flesh
bleeding slow, my body bloats
pulverizing their fists in my fuckin' face.
