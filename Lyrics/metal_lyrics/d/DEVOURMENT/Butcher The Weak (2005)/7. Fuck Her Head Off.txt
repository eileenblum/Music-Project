I know now I am bred to kill bitches
I will hack them till they're skinless
Slice their face or beat them senseless
Until they are twitching
Devastate their battered senses
Torture them for their offenses
Violate their cunts until they bleed
They always bleed

I fill them with steel
Until they cannot feel
Next to me they will be dead and naked

Bleeding rotting stinking all the whores are
Screaming while I'm feeding now I have to
Cut them into pieces, so that I can
Eat them, God Damn I am hungry
This pig is so tasty but I have to
Eat her so I can find another
Female to violate and indeed
I'll fuck her head right off

More bloodshed is needed
So that I can be treated
To a feast of blood and carnage
Necrophilia is my weakness

More bloodshed is needed
So that I can be treated
To a feast of blood and carnage
Necrophilia is my weakness

Covered in gore
All this blood is making my cock hard
I'll pump that vile cunt full of my semen
Disgracing her immaculate body
Yes, I will take a shit on her beautiful face
Piles and piles of my own hot manure
I've left upon this lifeless bitch
I smear it all over my body
This has now become a rancid feast
My hunger soon to be fulfilled
I force handfuls in my mouth

Masturbating on the face of the whore I will now dismember
Head and limbs removed with crude precision by the edge of my blade
Finally I introduce my knife to a feast of her anus
Brutally I force it to the hilt with every cut I fuck her
Faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster
