Gone, is, all reason
Pitch darkness
drowns each season
Minds, fall, in despair
Stench of death filling the air
The pain surges swelling to release
Thoughts of mayhem flow so freely
Regard for life falls the way of apathy
Tearing souls apart, cursing divinity

Crimson dreams of what's to be
Torn to shreds, Food for the pigs

Rage will lead temptation
Pain begets salvation
Slaughter will set our demons free
We'll fuck this world dead
When they find the steal penetrate
the walls of their cold being
Eyes stare cold and lifeless, empty souls fall to their knees
No emotion in this wraith as the bodies rid of fluid
The pigs born of the flames below, consume all that is green

Death to all that cross,
tear out their beating heart, human gristle for the pigs
Death to all that
cross, tear out their beating heart, human gristle for the pigs
Fall of all
humanity, the violent end that was foreseen
The coming in the form of human plague

Gone, is, all reason
Pitch darkness drowns each day
Minds, fall, in despair
Stench of death filling the air

Rage will lead temptation
Pain begets salvation
Slaughter will set our demons free
We'll fuck this filthy world dead to
End to cleanse to cease the disease
Fall to hell man's fate will be
Rise will the beast a new dawn breeds
Seeds of hatred planted
Generations of bloodshed
Calling for a definitive end
