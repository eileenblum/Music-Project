Swarming mass of mindless humans spawning rancor
Scathing hatred festers swelling society imploding

Hatred pushed beyond the boundaries, explosion is upon us
War mass suicide, ingredients to push existence to a close

Human liquidation forced through hand to hand extermination

One by one the lives are driven with a violent predication

Loss of all once pure, lost within greed's lure
Pain becomes the cure, Pain consumes your
Soul
Death consumes your
Soul
God forgoes your
Soul
Hell within your
Soul
Death incitement

The falling of wisdom, raped of all existence, the gates of hell open
To kill without consciousness, the weak to be relinquished, violently extinguished

Victims fall to massive torment
Flesh is scalded bones exposing
Faces with their features missing
Saw their gruesome fate as they died
Bound to pain their bodies mangled

Loss of all that was once pure
Pain dealt to the weak and feeble
Life has fallen, hell's incitement
Murder to end the world of men
