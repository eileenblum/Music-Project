Rising, from the depths of filth
the worms will grub this fucking world
Scavenging for flesh
Filthy rotten
Creatures stalk consume the dead
Rabid beasts will tear the skin of
all the scumbags that dwell among us
Spewing spit from savage jaws that tear
the limbs from tortured bodies
Screaming masses destined to be strewn among
splattered seas of entrails
Feasting are these ruthless beasts that crawled
from the darkest pits of hell

The bodies pile in a filthy sea of blood
Disease and scum infect the half dead victims
Bleeding from their eyes,
festering demise lifeless
Blistering and torn, such a vision of suffering hell, dead

Tearing through humanity
Fiercely devouring
Munching on
shattered bones
Mutilating victims
Defecating human pieces
Scattering rotten
The putrid beast's hunger dies never

Commencing the slaughter,
beasts hunting fodder, carried before being eaten alive
Dripping with sewage,
covered in fluid, air becomes putrid, life has died
World population, due for
termination, human liquidation, the carnivores thrive
A new world of chaos, a
wasteland of ruin, iniquities ravaged, god has died

Corpses that fill the
streets will nourish the carnivore's lust for meat
Whilst scavenging carrion
endlessly and spew the death on society
Corpses that fill the streets will
nourish the carnivore's lust for meat
Whilst scavenging carrion endlessly and
spew the death on society
