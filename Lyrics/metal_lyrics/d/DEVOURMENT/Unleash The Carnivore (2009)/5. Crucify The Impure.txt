Lusting, for the death of every single sinful lusting whore
Dreaming, of the smell of blood that saturates my every pore
Cursing, the name of those who infect this world with their vile aura
Plotting, the ways I can terminate them with extreme domination

With my tools I prepare for my destiny
On the prowl for those who repel me

One by one I will crush with barbarity
Their screams of angst will fade away beneath me

The bleeding
The dying
The insides
Dissolving
Mass murder
Extinction
Destroying
I'll crucify the dead

Lusting, for the death of every single sinful lusting whore
Dreaming, of the smell of blood that saturates my every pore
Cursing, the name of those who infect this world with their vile aura
Plotting, the ways I can terminate them with extreme domination

The sky turns red
Darkened visions in my head
As my visions turn real
As I hear the filthy squeal
The blood sprays my face
As they retch in their disgrace
The hammer of hate
Cause their life to decimate
