Returning to this place inside my mind
The darkest place in god's creation
A place where life is brought to suffer
Without feeling mercy
First I take a helpless victim
Back to my lair where I can skin them
Slash at their eyes, assault their sense
Revel as they suffer
Deflesh the abducted

The knife leaves trails of blood coming out of its ghastly wounds
Force feed this piece of shit, piss from my rotting scab encrusted filthy cock
Covering, showering with piss and blood as it twitches, I spit on it
Over and over again

How lovely, it still speaks with a lust to exist
I rip out its throat, fucking me with bliss
Abduct the whore, deflesh her more
Fuck you til your dead, causing me to explode

No more, I can't stand it, something strange like before
A hunger that envelops me, a need for human meat
I rip this bitch's fucking face off, gorge it right down like a hungry boar
Biting on the warm wet skin, I'm in heaven

Now I will feed on this warm, filthy meat
My hunger frightens me, I don't know if I can tame it
I bite down on its tit, it explodes shooting fluid
I stab out my own eyes, the sweet pain makes me cum
