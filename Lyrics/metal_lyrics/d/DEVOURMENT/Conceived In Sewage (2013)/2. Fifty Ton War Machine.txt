Trembles in the Earth of the ground, it will rise, bleed the sky
War beats of hell sent to crush mankind!
Coal fuels the fire of gears grinding in the 50 ton machines
Steel behemoths of hate!

The solstice of the final clash of man has begun
Legions march, the dust will rise to drown out the sun!
Endless armies of the dead, lust for pain and hate will spread
No mercy shown, no unturned stone, until the war is won!

Machine of the war
Exterminate divine!
Machine of war
The reign of man will die!

Corpses burning, cities falling,
The tide is turning, shadow consumes
Steel devours, hell fire showers
Fear will feed the beast of hell
Corpses burning, cities falling
The tide is turning, shadow consumes
The soil runs red,
Population dead!

Rise, of the once forsaken
From the depths where souls are taken
Kingship newly crowned by legion
Hate and fire burn this region
Gears, of the 50 ton machine
Gears, of the 50 ton war machine!
