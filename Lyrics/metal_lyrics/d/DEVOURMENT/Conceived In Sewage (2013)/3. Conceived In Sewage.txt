Conception, of sickness
The blackest of souls
Creation, revolting
These eyes see death eternal
The wretched stench gives me the life force to slay you
The depths in which I dwell would cause a stalwart soul to tremble
Lecherous intent is the driving force within me
The dying screams of victims, a ravenous atonement
Abduction of a helpless pawn, over and over
I force the rusty knife inside, over and over
The blood sprays across my face, over and over
The urge to feed consumes my brain, over and over
Conception, of sickness
The blackest of souls
Creation, revolting
These eyes see death eternal
Gorging chunks of steaming meat
The sickening urge is now complete
But wait a new idea has sprungI'll fuck the dead until I cum
The pounding, the thrusting, the pleasure, disgusting
The violence, the torture, indulge me, forever
The pounding, the thrusting, the pleasure, disgusting
The violence, the torture, indulge me, forever
