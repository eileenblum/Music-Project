Vomit scalding blood, eyes explode from the pressure
Become something more than human
Cursed from the beast, with a tormenting urge to feast
Eyeless with supreme perception
Veins bulge from the skin, sharpened fangs bursting through
A form made to induce terror
Acid bile flowing free, liquefy the dripping meat
Darkness cowers before its evil
Heaving Acid
It hunts, it maims, it kills, it feeds
Its victims, dismembered, their flesh, devoured
It mangles, it tortures, eviscerates and butchers
Its victims, dismembered, their flesh, devoured
Drooling viscous pyre to break down the bloody victim
Melting flesh slides off the bones to simplify consumption
Gore slopped blood feast, rabid hell beast
Limbs and bodies torn asunder
Limbs and bodies torn asunder
Limbs and bodies torn asunder
Dying flesh, feeds the beast
Steaming meat, to satiate its hunger
Acid scalds, heaving torture
Swallowed whole, by the jaws of a monster
