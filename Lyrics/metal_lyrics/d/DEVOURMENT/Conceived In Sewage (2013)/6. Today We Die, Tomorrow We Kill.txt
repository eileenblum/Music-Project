The eve
Of plague
Destined
To rise
From hell
Again
Butchered forth
Heinous force
War torn dead
The enemy takes you
Darkness, is calling forth
Die first, to join the force
Undead, the army marches
The world will die and fall to darkness
Take souls, to feed the master
Bloodlines, the earth burns faster
Mercy, none to be given
Forced to serve the crimson legion
Dead
War
Plague
Rotting
Marching
Killing
Burning
Scorching
Genocide
Heavens
Falling
End of times
Resistance, breathless fight
Hopeless, eternal night
Apathy, weakness purged
Soulless cogs enslaved
Horns of war sound, dim waves churning
Free the beast trapped in postmortem
Fiends of the afterlife starve for murder
Reap the fallen, dead march onward
Today we die
Tomorrow we kill
Today we dieTomorrow we kill
Kill tomorrow, kill them
Kill tomorrow, kill them all
