Broken down
Love remembered
Clouds of angel dust
Sadness covers my mind
I still think of what you've said
Listening to my inner voice
Maybe too late to regret
You tried to capture me
I made a fool of you
If love is a lie what is it all for
Broken down
Love remembered
Clouds of angel dust
There's always silence in the end
Don't try to rearrange all your feelings
The ruin of your soul
Restless your inner waste land
Is there peace in silence
Broken down
Love remembered
Clouds of angel dust
