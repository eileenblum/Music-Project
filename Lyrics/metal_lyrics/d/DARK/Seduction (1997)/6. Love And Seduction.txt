I feel this longing so strange and so bizarre
Until I will find you I'll keep it in the dark
A blaze bizarre burns in my heart
Brighter than the flame of fear
It feeds my wish to reach your love
To touch you in our dreams
When everything is withering
You're still my bleeding rose
And neither hate nor death can divide our love
My mind writes serenades for you
Like melodies of silence
Your shadow is trembling when I
Touch your skin and kiss your fear away
It's not easy to conceal
Fear with a masquerade of joy
Tears from a bleeding rose
Even purity can't wipe away
Sharing both, pleasure and pain
Sometimes passion is the same
Addicted to emotion, love and seduction
