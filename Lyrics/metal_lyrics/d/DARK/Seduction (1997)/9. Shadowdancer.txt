Some dreams never come true
Some days change the point of view
God's hands divided
What love once united
One of them is gone away
And one of them is left in pain
This immortal love lasts
Beyond life and death
There's a secret between them
When she's down and sad
He's coming back again
As a shadow, as a shadow
To dance with her, like before
She is dancing with
The shadows of the night
She is lying through
A dark sky of delight
