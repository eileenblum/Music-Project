I saw angels - fallen from the sky
I saw immortals - afraid to die
Time is just a moment in eternity
But every dawn seems like the last one
With silent cries my life is passing by
Like echoes from the past that slowly fade
If love is a lie, what is all for
Remember every tear I've shed for you
Still you deny, what you feel for me
Your eyes can't lie to me
After all I see you behind a veil of distrust
Only your eyes shine like a pale moon
Through stardust
