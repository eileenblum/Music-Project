Senseless life
I'm born into a world so cold
I cannot understand
Why the fate has chosen me
I'm born as a living dead
Useless youth
I dream about a world beyond
I feel so helpless
Cause something's breeding inside of me
My life is fading with every day
The sands of time
Running fast
My life is near, near its end
With a soul of a child
Imprisoned in a body
Hundreds of years old
My life is fading away
