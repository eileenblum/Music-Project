It's so far away
Where no humans are
It's so high in the sky
Where the silence reigns
Come and take my hand
And close your eyes for another dream
This is a place where nothing is what it seems
With a view of a sea which unifies
All the sadness of our darkened world
This is a sea of tears
That thousand angels had cried
This is an island
of hopes and dreams
This is the hidden place
The dragon of grace
With a bleeding rainbow
In the heart of a crimson sky
This is a paradise
Beyond the veil of sleep
Only when the last sign occurs,
the angels will cry
And their tears will flow,
From the gates of heaven
Like everflowing floods of melancholy
Are you ready for another journey
Through the land of dreams
Come and take my hand and let us fly
To the sea of hope and fear -
To the godly place called Angeltear
Angeltear
