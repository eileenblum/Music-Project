After the sunset, cold winds blowing
Dark clouds are rising over raging seas
Deceptive silence - one of the signs
Desperation and the embrace of fear
An approaching flood
A lightning and pouring rain
The cyclone is coming again
Now run for your life
A black tongue from out of heaven
Is dancing over valleys
Absorbing everything
Uncomparable fear,
When minutes seem like hours
Natural forces out of control
And in the eye of the cyclone
The silence is still reigning
A celestial oasis of peace and hope
The desperation and the anger
The sadness and the fear
The devastation and the weakness
The turmoil and despair
Will there be a tomorrow
When the storm is gone
One day the dark clouds will rise again
