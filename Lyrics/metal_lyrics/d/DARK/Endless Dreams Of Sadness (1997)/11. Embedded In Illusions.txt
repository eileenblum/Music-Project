My sleep is unreal 
my dream is my life 
embedded in illusions
searching for the answer... 
to understand my life

What I see 
is weaved from my heart
emotions that I never 
felt before

Flames of water 
seas of fire 
a darkened sun 
and a burning moon

This is a world without hate 
this is a world of phantasy

Red painted heaven 
white painted ravens 
whispering trees 
and burning seas

My sleep is unreal 
my dream is my life 
embedded in illusions
searching for the answer... 
to understand my life
