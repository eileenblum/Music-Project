So far away 
there is a place 
untouched from human hand
saved from all bitterness

I had a vision 
I saw the light 
I felt the ease 
I saw Gaias Masterpiece

Is this the end? 
Will I meet my friends?
Life after death 
it's my final breath

My life has ceased

Tears are flowing 
my heart is bleeding 
don't forget me 
we will meet again

I had a vision 
I saw the light 
I felt the ease 
I saw Gaias Masterpiece
