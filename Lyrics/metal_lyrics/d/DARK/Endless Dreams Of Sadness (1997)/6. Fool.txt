Why do you play with fire 
and run towards disaster
your head is filled with drugs 
rid of all realizations

It slows time to a dimension 
you're flying through your brainspace
you've created a land of milk and honey 
where everything seems to be funny

You forget drugs' danger 
your life lost every kind of value
you fall into a hole 
but no one is there to help you

Why do you play with fire 
and run towards disaster
your head is filled with drugs 
rid of all realizations

You're a fucking fool 
with drugs you are a tool
you're lying with your stinking breath 
sorry you are near to death

Why do you play with fire 
and run towards disaster
your head is filled with drugs 
rid of all realizations

It slows time to a dimension 
you're flying through your brainspace
you've created a land of milk and honey 
where everything seems to be funny

You forget drugs' danger 
your life lost every kind of value
you fall into a hole 
but no one is there to help you

Why do you play with fire 
and run towards disaster
your head is filled with drugs 
rid of all realizations
