When the sky has turned to grey
like a neverending decay
frozen tears in your eyes 
dawn of the gods 

thandle with care they said
this will be our last arise 
do you see the world's disguise
it looks like a grave of ice

Dawn of the gods 
has begun right now 
it's too late 
to regret your mistakes

If you don't give a damn to gods advise 
the flowers will fade to black
then you know for whom the bell tolls 
and the shortest straw will be drawn
no mercy 
no life 
you'll suffer 
'til death

Dawn of the gods 
has begun right now 
it's too late 
to regret your mistakes

You've my master 
I'm your creature
but you must obey 
to what I say
