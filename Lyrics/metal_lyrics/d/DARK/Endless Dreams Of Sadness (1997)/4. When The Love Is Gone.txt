My love is lost 
she is gone forever 
now I'm alone 
for the rest of my life

My sweet love, 
I love you, 
until the end will fall
you're the only one, 
I will love you forever

I can't understand 
why you've changed those things
you left me without shedding a tear 
the remembrance in our past
is turning me insane

My dreams from eternal love are shattered I don't know what went wrong
the past is gone, but my life is going on... 

when the love is gone

Our separation has broken my heart 
but this is the real life
I thought that our love was made for eternity 
but this was only a lie

My love is lost 
she is gone forever 
now I'm alone 
for the rest of my life

My sweet love, 
I love you, 
until the end will fall
you're the only one, 
I will love you forever
