This hate goes back 
to the roots of mankind
but no one knows 
why it stays alive

This anger inside 
sick people's minds 
so many victims 
are already dead
The rage grows stronger 
when I see the pictures in the news
I cannot understand 
why no one stops these cruelties

They fight the wrong way 
for their political view
and if you're a stranger 
they'll also hate you

This anger inside 
sick people's minds 
so many victims 
are already dead
The rage grows stronger 
when I see the pictures in the news
I cannot understand 
why no one stops these cruelties

Brainsickness

They celebrate death 
on all the streets of this world
together they're strong 
alone they've lost

This anger inside 
sick people's minds 
so many victims 
are already dead
