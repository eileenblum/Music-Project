Moonlight burns your skin 
when you try to sleep
your sleeping dreams 
awake as nightmares

You fly across the sky 
on bloody wings of love
trying not to fall 
into a sea of sadness

Drowning in your tears 
suffocation's near
breathing your dead love 
like a taste of fear

Moonlight turns to dust 
when all is said and done
now all love is lost 
before it has begun
