Maybe some will say that Iâve gone too far
To climb up the stars Enchanting emotions bizarre

Passing the gates of deep black sleep
Drowning in waves of a black cold sea
The silence around me breeds new fear
Iâm at the edge of infinity

Flowing in streams of lifeless seeds
Senseless existence â no more needs
Hallucinations sets me free,
Iâm at the edge of infinity

Some may say I went too far
As I tried to climb at to the stars
The silence around me breeds new fear
Iâm at the edge of infinity
