I can stay, Iâll see the way
To cross lick without embers,
Space and time.
And one day, Iâll find the way
To the hidden depths, to make you mine.

Give me a pan and Iâll tell you something about the end.

And one day I will find the way, into your heart
And one day I will find the way, to break our love mischance

Your broken promises, Iâm sick of your empty words,
Whenever I see in your eyes, I know itâs another of your lies.
