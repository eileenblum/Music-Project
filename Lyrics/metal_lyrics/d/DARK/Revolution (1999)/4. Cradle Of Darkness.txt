No matter what comes, you follow your tradition.
No matter what comes, you stay on your position.

No matter what counts, you stay on your decision.
On poisoned ground, you realize your vision.

The cradle of darkness
Lies something beneath the brightest light
To forever shine beyond
So frightened the fearless
Discourage the brave to see what's might
And keep it all inside.

The cradle of darkness
