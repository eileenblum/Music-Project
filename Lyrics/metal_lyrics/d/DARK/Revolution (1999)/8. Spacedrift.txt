How I see it all in a different size,
With a muzzy minds from a higher ground?
Watch the sun dawn (sun down) twilight welcome sets those rhymes,
To the moon in its magician.

I see sin for middle day,
I spread my arms and drift away,
I lost a chance for relatives,
I took my arm and...
... in a galaxy

I spread my wings to fly
To those dividing skies,
Time lost its meaning,
The flowing stars and size,
I drift through a galaxy
Swallowed by eternity
And now I am one,
One with infinity.
