Remember, when we were happy,
Floats in cloudless skies,
We swallowed life right down our throat.

On that hill I stand and look into our childhoodâs past.
I recognize this unspoiled place â we called it paradise
And one day you disappeared without a trace,
No "save our soul" could reach my ears.

We miss you one stare with eyes wide open,
To the place we played with eyes wide open.

Parents cried but no one told me really everything
They all ignored my wondering eyes. What was happening?

Alone now, thatâs all I felt in these cold days.
The shadows raped in paradise
The shadows reigned...
