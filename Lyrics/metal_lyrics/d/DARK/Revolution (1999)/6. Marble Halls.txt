Through a darkened corridor,
They bring me in a room without a door.
No locks, no chains but still Iâm bound.
Like a distant voice without a sound.

Watch the insane breed
Look the crowd of freaks
The fire in their eyes,
Dancing in the marble halls.
Now Iâm coming home,
Back where I belong,
To the home of fools
Dancing in the marble halls.

In a darkened corridor,
Where no one dares to look behind the door,
I close my mind and still Iâm bound.
Number nineteen lost, and it wonât be found
