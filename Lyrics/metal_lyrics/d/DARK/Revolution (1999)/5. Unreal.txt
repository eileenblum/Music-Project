Whenever you sleep, I hold your life,
In my driven cross, mine for all time.

Close your eyes to see the unreal,
Relax your body, be part of this dream.
Drift the world to my fantasy,
The worlds collide, the dream becomes real.

What happens to the flood of hallucination?
Walk alone their path in twilight?
I can offer you, some nightmares to consume.
If life is boring I can give you pleasure.

Remember, Iâm here. Shout â itâs in vain.
Discover to me, join to the end of the real game.

In my eyes youâll see the unreal,
Close your eyes and see the unreal,
Fall to sleep and see the unreal!
