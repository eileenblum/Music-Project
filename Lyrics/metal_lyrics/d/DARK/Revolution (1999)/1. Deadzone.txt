A... deadzone.
Iâm in coma stage (stay),
My mind just stretched,
But not just fade.
I see the future through those eyes,
I see (nuke?) dead body,
Above my disguise.

Deadzone, I am control someone.
Deadzone, forever destination.
Deadzone, the future in my brain,
Deadzone, the fore coming tress my vein.

Will they wear (ware) tomorrow?
Will I wake up again?
Is it the right path I follow?
Or letâs make the sun enters the rain?

Thatâs the pride man say,
Time to change when bitterness is tasting sweet.
What I see is sad and grey,
This is my vision of mankind, say (climb?)

Iâm in coma stage, paralyzed and thrust,
Still in coma stage, paralyzed and thrust.

I can see the peopleâs see
Though Iâm blind, though I donât wake.
Mankindâs fading scuff and (stone?)
I saw it once in the Deadzone.
