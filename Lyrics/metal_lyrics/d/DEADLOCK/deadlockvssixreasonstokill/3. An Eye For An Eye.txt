but he was all alone and his fellows on earth were to weak. and the enemies were millions and started to seek for him. to show him their might and their cruelty. and by chance they would kill him that night. and they found him and tried to break his pride. but he stood there smiling and prayed to his gods with his arms open wide. i entered your realm unseen. silent and calm. i dared to cause this war. now let me die therefore. out of the depth of their world he cried to the lord. and he knew that he would die. when he reached for his sword. with a thousand against one no battle can be won. and after hours of fighting he died under the sun. and they nailed him to the cross. he was crucified. they hammered one nail in his feet and nails in his arms open wide. he came to his lord and laid down to sleep with his arms still around his sword. and if they will wake him once again by mistake worship or embrace. he will come like drumming thunder and along with him the end of the world.
