we have seen a thousand suns over a thousand nights. we`ve walked through thousand worlds and followed a thousand lives. but never before we watched a life so beautiful and so pure. should he follow his heart. they knew right from the start. that he was more than this human life. and that he was the one the innocent waited for to arrive. they gave him the chance to join their crimes and to become part of their earth-killing-machinery. and if he would fit perfectly. they could give him the crown. and make him king of their artificial world. but overwhelmed by the desire to end this exploitation. but he knew that words were uneffective and his tears could not end the slaughter. so he decided to bring back the war. a war against the rapers of nature. that`s why he began to strive for retaliation. to shatter mankinds` perverted supremacy. and he promised to give his life to bring them liberation and to purify himself of the guilt. to show them that there is no honor among the thieves of others lives he will not only kill. he will not only kill. one of them like a bee. he will kill their whole hive. and so he paced around from side to side. and began to pray with his arms open wide. he prayed for the rescue-party from the dead. not longer will to fell his dread. and soon the darkened sky opened for several times. and flashes of lightning began to burn down their lies. so he caused that the first of these bastards died. and he still prayed on with his arms open wide. he said death is now set without any regret. and no matter how many of you have to die. i will kill you and your bible an eye for an eye.
