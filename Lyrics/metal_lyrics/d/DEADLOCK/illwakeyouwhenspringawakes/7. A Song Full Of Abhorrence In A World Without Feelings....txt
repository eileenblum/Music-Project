Romeo an Juliet
a non existing fairy tale in a world where no one seems to have a heart
a big fashion show with unprincipled dollies and self-important midgets 
isn't it perverted that these wretched figures play a main part in our world
so look at all these beauties and try not to vomit
and instead of hating themselves they start with self admiration
so the real beauties die out while the dummies increase
