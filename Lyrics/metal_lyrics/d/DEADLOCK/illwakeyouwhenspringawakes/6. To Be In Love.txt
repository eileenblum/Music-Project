To be in love means jumping into hot water and freezing to deathdepression embrace my soulfrustration tears my hearttoo stupid to feel the warmth that you gave this placethe loneliness I feel becomes overwhelmingyou're disappearing from my lifeit drives me into despairto be in love means jumping into hot water and freezing to death
