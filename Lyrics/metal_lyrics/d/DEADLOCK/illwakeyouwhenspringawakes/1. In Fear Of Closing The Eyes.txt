In fear of closing the eyescause my dreams are not from this worldso crazy so dark so unrealsomewhere between life and death I wander around in this endless darknesslike in a desert without an oasislike a worm trying to dig itself into ironin fear of closing the eyesnever want to dream again never want to suffer againno way out of this underworldbut I can still see traces of the wallsthe walls between the good and the badso perhaps it's not too lategive me your hand please help metake me outplease help metake me outI can still see the traces of the walls between you and meshow me the way
