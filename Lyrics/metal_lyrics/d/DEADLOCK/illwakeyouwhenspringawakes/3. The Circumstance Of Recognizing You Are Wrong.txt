Arrogance seems to be the only cure from the unwised actions of our so-called peaceful fellowsconvenience makes them blind stone cold facts are ignoredeveryone even I seems to be part of this liewhat's the solution ok. just cling to your comforts and pass over changes in silenceyou can call me arrogant but first ask yourself am I responsible for your blindnessthere's no sense in preaching one's ideals and there's no sense in setting rules of a more peaceful livingarrogance seems to be the only cure
