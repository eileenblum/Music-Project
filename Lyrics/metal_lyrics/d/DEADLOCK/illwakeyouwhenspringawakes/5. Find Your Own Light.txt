I raise my eyes towards heaven and try to reach the suncause having caught one sunbeam itÂ´s warmth will resurrect mebut suddenly clouds appearclouds cover the sunmy world is cold againmy heart is cold againmy body is frozen againwith every day you leave me standing in the coldI build up a warmth deep in my heartand sooner or later the day will come on which I create my own sunmy heart my sun will be shining all day without sunrise or sunset an eternal lightand you shall never be able to sleep nightsI take a look inside myself and try to reach for my own sunsunbeams deep inside me and now their warmth can resurrect memy sun in all its splendour from the bottom of my heart will cast some light on your trackbut can you find your own way backnow it's up to you not to get lost
