Comrades come on, enter the boat
We are about to start the hunt of our lives
Comrades come on, the hunt is on
Let's get us some dead corpses

Hunt down the weak, predators of the sea
Oh, it's my life and I am proud of it
Comrades come on, the hunt is on
Let's start a massacre on the open ice

I still remember killing for the first time
I must have hit it one hundred times
And the snow turned red allover
It's a fucking pleasure flying the flags of my fathers

Respect the sea, respect the ice
For they are stronger than we are
And my son will soon be a hunter
This violence is perpetual

Comrades come on, enter the boat
We are about to start the hunt of our lives
Comrades come on, the hunt is on
Let's get us some dead corpses

Hunt down the weak, predators of the sea
Oh, it's my life and I am proud of it
Comrades come on, the hunt is on
Let's start a massacre on the open ice

Don't tell me we are cruel, while our children
Are being killed every day - homicide
And now you will tell me that anybody cares
About these babies being massacred in a barbaric slaughter

Respect the sea, respect the ice
For they are stronger than we are
And my son will soon be a hunter
This violence is perpetual

As long I will be, our tradition will continue

Kill, kill, kill...

Hunt down the weak, as long as I shall live

Now, die

As long as there is no law against the hunt
And the animals don't speak
With a cruel blow to the top of the head
We will kill and hunt down the weak

If he who sows the wind will reap the whirlwind
Doom will soon await us
