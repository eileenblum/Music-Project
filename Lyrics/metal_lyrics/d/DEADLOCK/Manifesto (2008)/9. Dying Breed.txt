(It is utterly exhausting, an awful bore
Such a miserable life, nothing left to adore
it is utterly disappointing, the most awful bore
Our miserable lives, nothing left to live for)

No instrument of torture, no weapon
Not any fucking technical horrible machine
Can put the disaster to the next level
Evocation of Armageddon

All that we can kill, has been killed before
In every single possible way
Where is the extreme
That beats everything!?

Humanity is always innovation
Improvement of a controlled
And dominated creation
Our breed has been elected

To discover all varieties of perversion
And become social neglected

No instrument of torture, no weapon
Not any fucking technical horrible machine
Can put the disaster to the next level
Evocation of Armageddon

All that we can kill, has been killed before
Even in the most unimaginable perverted ways
Where is the extreme
That beats everything!?

Humanity is always innovation
Improvement of a controlled
And dominated creation
Our breed has been elected

To discover all varieties of perversion
And become social neglected

Pain isn't what it was anymore
Rape somebody, kill a child, an awful bore
Pain has to be reinvented, putting murder and violation
On a higher non-human level, to become godlike

Humanity is always innovation
Improvement of a controlled
And dominated creation
Our breed has been elected

To become social neglected

Humanity is always innovation
Improvement of a controlled
And dominated creation
Our breed has been elected [x2]

(Ultima ratio, murder the murderers
Pile up their torment and let's throw ourselves straight into it
The next step is becoming godlike
And to steal his fucking throne)

Megalomania is creation
Extremism loved to distraction
Altruism is forced to rest
Such a sorrowful manifest
