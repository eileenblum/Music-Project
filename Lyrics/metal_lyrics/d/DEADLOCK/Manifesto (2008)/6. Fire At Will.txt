Me and my family love roaming the woods
It's all about hunting, live, learn and play
But it's not easy being a hunter these days
We have to find new excuses for our madness every day

Should I ever kill an animal without a reason
I will quickly fake up a new hunting season

Deep in the woods - I am the law
Man against nature - that's my war
Seek, aim and kill
Fire at will!
Under the cloak of tradition
An executing mission
Seek aim and kill
Fire at will!

There are so many of them
They need some killing
My instinct tells me to
And their heads make a good trophy, don't they?

Okay, I kill for fun and amusement
But don't blame it all on me
Because I am not the only and by far
Not the most vicious creator of misery

Wait, quiet now, shut up
I hear something coming
Thank you god
Finally I will get my trophy

It is time for a shot now
A shot for glory
My god made me kill
My own daughter Sophie

Deep in the woods - I am the law
Seek, aim and kill
Fire at will!
Under the cloak of tradition
An executing mission
Seek aim and kill
Fire at will!

Deep in the woods - I am the law
Man against nature - that's my war
Seek, aim and kill
Fire at will!

Mankind is made for hunting
And that is all we do
Seek, aim and kill
Fire at will!

(May for the last bullet in this game
my own head be the aim)
