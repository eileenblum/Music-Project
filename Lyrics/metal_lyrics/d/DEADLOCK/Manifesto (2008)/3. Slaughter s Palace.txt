Time to tell you how  became
A master in the most delicious trade

To be honest, I did not like to go to school
And I was not any good at it either
I did not have any friends or things to do
So i assisted my dad and soon I fell in love

With the art to be butcher by the tender age of 14

Come in, come in, and you will never find a way out
At least not in one piece

All that innocent and lovely flesh suppliers
Running into my abattoir
Don't know what they have to expect
Hahahaha!

Their one way ticket to hell
Always lead them to a sanguinary end
But that's just the normal way of life
Because one man's meat is another ones poison

Come in, come in, and become a part in my work
In the truest sense of the word

Don't blame me for killing animals
Because cattle is only raised to be part of our food chain
No cows or pigs could soil in our stables
If we would not take care for them

Their one way ticket to hell
Always lead them to a sanguinary end
But that's just the normal way of life
Because one man's meat is another ones poison

But if we really get back what we have done
I hope I won't die by a correctly applied captive bolt gun
