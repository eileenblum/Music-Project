What have we done, where do we want to go?
The city sleeps forever
It slithers away as we speak
And we tell ourselves to deny it

Their lies dominate our inner eyes
While the sounds of laughter shake our dying earth

We can't count on our old brothers
We know tomorrow brings consequence
But didn't we tell ourselves
To deny it?

Their lies dominate our inner eyes
While the sounds of laughter shake our dying earth
We meander ourselves through our daily lives
Why do we have to be tortured for all the lies

Humility it's creation
Altruism and freedom
Rethink traditions at last
Let this be our manifest

Their lies dominate our inner eyes
While the sounds of laughter shake our dying earth
