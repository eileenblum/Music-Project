Driving a truck was always my dream
King of the road letting off steam
Follow me while I check the truckload
Call me the master of life and death

Join the deathrace - come on

Hear their excited groaning which turns to painful screams
when i start my powerful engine

I am the king of the road
With my moribund load
Their tourment, pain and fear
Makes me drive in top gear

Where is the fucking difference
Between a living load and normal cargo
Arriving on schedule
Means getting paid punctually

Don't blame me for being one of the first parts
Of mankinds insane catering monstrosity
I just laugh about these pseudo guardian angels
That think they could change our world

I am the king of the road
With my moribund load
Their tourment, pain and fear
Makes me drive in top gear

If they could what should they pray for?
Dying in my truck on the road or in the abattoir
The ones condemned to death
Have not a single chance to win this race

Cattle crossing, keep silent
Man fated to be tyrant
No mercy, no barrier
Express cattle carrier

Animals can't speak but we can...

Look at the peak of evolution the food chain leader
Looking like the freight that he's chauffeuring to eat up
Ain't that some wack shit rolling to the shambles
Acting as a cab bitch slaying loads of animals
Imagine you all was cannibals and mankind the cattle dude
Locked up in a box small enough to get in rampage mood
I fucking disagree with the price and the fee
That these beings have got to pay so we can feast and fucking eat
I'm one with all fauna the animal persona
Raw and distinctive the beast master warned you all
Keep roughhousing and I will be the karma
For acting too supreme make me have to armour up
Testing chemicals and genocide to foreign species
Acts of our society so sick son believe me
We got to keep it real how the fuck would it feel
Locked all ya life behind rolling bars of steel

This is a story about this man in a slaughter house
Took me on tour and showed me all his whereabouts
And in my lurking doubts
He starts to light a cigarette and starts drinking on a genuisstot
You greenpeace fools we handle your food
And if you like fast food
Here's some examples for you
Livestock cows in dead, destroyed milk they use burger king meat
What they feed to the streets, no time to negotiate
Blood fills their death, when their alive when they breathe they lungs aspirate
You like veil, this will spoil your meal
The baby confined to no light and food and that's real
Respect to Islam for eating no swine
Here's some waist pits we use to feed them there time to time
He expressed no pain for four weeks pain a cut in the juggler-vain
Is something yo, I can't explain
