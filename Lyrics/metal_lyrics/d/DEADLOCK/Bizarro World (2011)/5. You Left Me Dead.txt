Nothing is what it seems (Fairytale figure media)
You are giving me the creeps (Preaching men fake behavior)
I was caught up in desire for the unattainable
I tried to start a fire but it was not sustainable

[Chorus:]
You left me dead, dead as dead can be
Now come down and devour me till there is nothing left to see
So I will never take part in your enormous deception

Send your creatures of night (while I lay me to sleep)
Take away every sparkle of light (now let them bury me deep)
Someone cast a spell on me thrice blessed catastrophe
Oh please let me use that spell, just take me from this hell

[Chorus]

After all that you've done I should hate you for what you've become
So I will never take part in your enormous deception

[Chorus]

You left me dead, dead as dead can be
Now come down and devour me till there is nothing left to see

So I will never;.. Take part in your... Enormous deception...
