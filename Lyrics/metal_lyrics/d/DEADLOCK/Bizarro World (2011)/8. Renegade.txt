All I asked for was a smile
To feel at least like one of your kind
And I waited for a lifetime
And will still wait for a while
I guess I never felt so cold

All I asked for was the truth
While your lies punched like fists in my face

And still I wait for just a statement but slowly frustration overwhelms me

Tear it down
Don't look back
Tear the world down
To regenerate
I don't belong here
Not at all
Refresh ethics
I am the renegade
All I asked for was respect
In a world without any self-esteem
But still I wait for someone
To wake me up
And tell me it was just a dream

But now the damage is done
And the cuts are far too deep
No more room for failure
No longer I will wait

Tear it down
Don't look back
Tear the world down
To regenerate
I don't belong here
Not at all
Refresh ethics
I am the renegade

I leave it all behind in chaos
Once I will build it back up stronger
Before the last buds of beauty degenerate
I will have my say

But now the damage is done
And the cuts are far too deep
No more room for failure
No longer I will wait

Tear it down
Don't look back
Tear the world down
To regenerate
I don't belong here
Not at all
Refresh ethics
I am the renegade

But now the damage is done
And the cuts are far too deep
No more room for failure
I am the renegade
