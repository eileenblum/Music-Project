Your world means nothing to me
Even though I am born from this soil
No soul no emotion not even a heart
Just like you.
Pray to whom ever you want
But they won`t save you now
As your world is going down.
Pray to whom ever you want
But it`s all over now as I start
To walk all over you.

I will cut you a smile from ear to ear
As your whole life`s a joke
Break your arms, break your legs
And ask for a dance,
What a brutal romance
What a brutal romance,
It always takes two to tango.
What a brutal romance
What a brutal romance.

Start to pray while I wait around the corner
And death is by my side
You redefined pain and torture
And now it`s up to me
To sail with the tide.

Pray to whom ever you want
But they won`t hear you now
While I spread the storm.
Pray to whom ever you want
But as far as I can tell
This is going to be the new hell.

I will cut you a smile from ear to ear
As your whole life`s a joke
Break your arms, break your legs
And ask for a dance,
What a brutal romance
What a brutal romance,
It always takes two to tango.
What a brutal romance
What a brutal romance.

I am with you
'Til death do us part
And I promise to kill
You state of the art.
