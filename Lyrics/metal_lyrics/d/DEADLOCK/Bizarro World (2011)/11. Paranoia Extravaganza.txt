Try to keep your dark secrets 
Always at the bottom 
But all those lies 
Will never
Be forgotten.

You find your own way and climb
The highest mountains behind
Those close drawn curtains. 
I will always keep my faith 
Dance all fears away.

Just pretended not to 
Remember all your false behavior 
Fake pomp leads 
You to 
Your downfall.

You find your own way and climb 
The highest mountains behind 
Those close drawn curtains. 
I will always keep my faith 
Dance all fears away.

Gifted wealth but no bills payed 
Fake love will rain on your parade 
The only one who really knows 
What you do 
Is your own shadow.

You find your own way and climb
The highest mountains behind 
Those close drawn curtains. 
I will always keep my faith 
Dance all fears away.
