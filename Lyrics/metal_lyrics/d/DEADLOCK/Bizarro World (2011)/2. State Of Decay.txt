Always trusting you blindly now here is your state of play
When you open your eyes you will find me in your state of decay

I believed in you deep in my soul never had any other place to go
Destroyed by your yesterday shocked by today

In fear of our tomorrow guess all my hopes and believes go astray

Always trusting you blindly now here is your state of play
When you open your eyes you will find me in your state of decay

Once proud yet can't imagine why as I see your bullets fly
Patridiots don't bother me three cheers for what you used to be
You changed my heart you changed my heart broke us apart

Come back to me should you ever dare if you have any love to share

Always trusting you blindly now here is your state of play
When you open your eyes you will find me in your state of decay

My hope is forsaken now let me sleep and try to forget
