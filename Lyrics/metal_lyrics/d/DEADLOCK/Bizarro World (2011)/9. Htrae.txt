I never introduced myself I am the opposite of all you ever longed for
You will call me the widow maker before you get even married
Today is the day where all your dream will be buried buried deep under wretched lies where nobody cares nobody will hear your cries
I love to watch you cry may you tears never dry forgiveness denied my lust can never be satisfied

Today is my day and you can be my witness beauty turns to pain while we dance in the acid rain
Horror to whom horror is due let's kill your mother earth and turn the world to and orphanage horror to whom horror is due

Leave the dirt where dirt belongs and this dirty world belongs to you dirt bag
The best to happen this century fake light turns into definite obscurity

You saw trees of green red roses too but now they're gone for me and for you
and I think to myself you dig your own grave
And I think to myself what a horrible place that lovely success will be based on your disgrace

This world is mine for a nickel and a dime
