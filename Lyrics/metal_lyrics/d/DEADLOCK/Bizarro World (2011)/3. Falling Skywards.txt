Grow higher my tower till in heaven we fall where saints will be devoured when ghosts and harlots brawl
Whore of Babylon oh how I hate being mean
Falling skywards to a paradise invaded by

My blood in your veins, my wicked love to reign supreme from heaven above
Rise up to the sky, my tower rise

In every language call my name it is my filthy will to entertain you with
Babylon the great I entertain you with

My blood in your veins, my wicked love to reign supreme from heaven above
Rise up to the sky, my tower rise

Grow higher and higher no one touches the ground again we set the world on fire
preparing a heavenly deathbed
May the sky be the limit while your beauty will die I am the beast of mankind
and I kiss it goodbye with

My blood in your veins, my wicked love to reign supreme from heaven above
Rise up to the sky, my tower rise

Grow higher my tower till in heaven we fall where saints will be devoured and
the world will my followers call...
