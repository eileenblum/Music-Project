by the light of the moon dark thoughts rise up
they haunt my dreams while the wind
carries their voices and screams

awakened by sirens, armed with the wrath of gods
we ride the storm, may our rage defend creation

awakened by sirens, armed with the wrath of gods
we ride the storm, may our rage defend creation

by the light of the moon dark thoughts rise up
now we haunt your dreams while the wind
carries our warcries

under cover of darkness
beneath the bleeding horizon
your end's now justified
