i accept the agony applause
brave as I am
an insane dance at the brink of death
in your circus of the obscene

far away from my home, caged behind rusty bars
beaten and mortified, you're shouting and cheering
would forever fall silent
you would be ashamed of clapping your hands

dear spectators - I'm coming from the boondocks
to your wilderness of mirrors
pretending to be dangerous and unpredictable
but look into my eyes

and all you will see is frustration and fear
disappointment about man
creation's crowning glory

but now it's time to go
march us prisoners off
may our agony entertain you
