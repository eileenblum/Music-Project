executioners
raise your swords
avengers
these lives are yours

let's start with the end now
prepare their graves
their lives are worth nothing
their hearts even less

so comrades come on
let's teach them respect
so comrades come on now
let's rip some flesh

let us start with the end now
let's rip some flesh

and in the end they will pray
that the sun also shines in hell
far away from the others
removed from the rest of the world

they will regret what they did
you will regret what you did
there is no peace for the insincere

and in the end you will pray
that the sun also shines in hell
for a person such as yourself
can only live under the earth

you're a worthless fool
rotten and stinking
even the devil himself
will not accept you in hell
