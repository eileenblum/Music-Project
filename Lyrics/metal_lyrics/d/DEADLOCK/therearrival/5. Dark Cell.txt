behind the doors of my dark cell
i wounded my hands on these chains
i've been locked for so long
so please, come take me out

a lifetime of pain cuts my body like razorblades

oh, I have got some plans for you
come, let me out and play
i've got some plans for myself too
i just want to live free

give me just one good reason
why should I believe?

why does that way to heaven seem to be too far for me?
what have I done to deserve this?
how much pain can I take?

why is that door to my cage always locked from the outside?

oh, that chains, what a torture
loosen them only if, only for a moment
let that broken heart breathe

the more time that passes
the greater my suffering grows
i drag myself forwards
and around in a circle
so come on, breathe
my broken heart
