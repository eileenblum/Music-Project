another heart, another life, just another test
another murder, another lie, just another death

and ours is to suffer - for you want always more
and ours is to suffer - you kill all that we adore

i don't need no master to command
i am the law by myself

paradise is falling down
and you try to leave this goddamn town
and your world is burning down
like rats forsaking a sinking ship
down to your knees and pray

but we shall all bleed
together eternally
for this is the hell we
the hell we all created

another heart, another life, just another breath
another place, another world, just another chance

what kind of paradise are you creating here?
what the fuck do you expect?

with every lie you whisper to our ears
a town underfed with love
born up from pain
