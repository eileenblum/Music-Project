all I asked for was a smile
to feel at least like one of your kind
and I waited for a lifetime
and will still wait for a while
i guess I never felt so cold

all I asked for was the truth
while your lies punched like fists in my face
and still I wait for just a statement
but slowly frustration overwhelms me

tear it down - never look back
tear the world down - to regenerate
i don't belong here - not at all
refresh ethics - i am the renegade

all I asked for was respect
in a world without any self-esteem
but still I wait for someone
to wake me up
and tell me it was just a dream

but now the damage is done
and the cuts are far too deep
no more room for failure
no longer I will wait

i leave it all behind in chaos
once I will build it back up stronger
before the last buds of beauty degenerate
i will have my say
