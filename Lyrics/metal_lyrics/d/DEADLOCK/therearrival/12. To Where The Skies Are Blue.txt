sun goes down once again
while I sit here and feel the tears
running down my cheeks
no - I am not afraid of the dark

but the darker it gets the more I realize
that there is no one to depend on
no one to believe in

and so I wait to die here all alone
like the daylight dies while it is fading away
because nobody knows for sure that the sun will burn
through that cold night once more

so I pray for someone to come and make my life seem like
it's still worth livin' it - so I pray for you to come

but still the hardest things to say
are the words that I mean the most
come on angel, say that you
love me and nothing in this
world will ever scare me again
take me to where the skies are blue
