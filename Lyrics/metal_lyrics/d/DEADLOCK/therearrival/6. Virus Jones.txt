it is simply not worth the price
Dr. Jones and his temple of doom
bow down to those maggots

of epidemic epic delusions
virus Jones on his last crusade

now world come breastfeed my cravings
your poisoned milk will breed my cancer
i bow down to those maggots

blasphemers preaching a viral god
rags and ruin of what once was human

every word reeks of failure
whether they kill us now or tomorrow
we all share that miserable sorrow

it's me, Virus Jones - all left alone
it's the darkest of all secrets - i give my life just to keep it
oh, either stoned or ashamed
and the world will not be blamed

i will waste no time hoping
while fear and sickness is beyond all bearing
i'd rather bow down to those maggots

while the stench of the wounded and hopeless
leaves that bitter mark of misanthropy

bow down

let me at least praise my dream
behind those lies
their penchant on my misery was not
plain to see
