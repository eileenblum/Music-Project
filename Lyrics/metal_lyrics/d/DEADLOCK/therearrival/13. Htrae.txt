i never introduced myself
i am the opposite of all you ever longed for
you will call me the widow maker
before you get even married

today is the day where all your dreams will be buried
buried deep under wretched lies
where nobody cares, nobody will hear your cries
i love to watch you cry, may your tears never dry
forgiveness denied my lust can never be satisfied

today is my day and you can be my witness
beauty turns to pain while we dance in the acid rain

horror to whom horror is due
let's kill your mother earth
and turn the world to and orphanage
horror to whom horror is due

leave the dirt where dirt belongs
and this dirty world belongs to you, dirt bag
the best to happen this century
fake light turns into definite obscurity
Dirt bag, dirt bag

you saw trees of green red roses too
but now they're gone for me and you
and I think to myself you dig your own grave
and I think to myself what a horrible place
that lovely success will be based on your disgrace
this world is mine for a nickel and a dime
