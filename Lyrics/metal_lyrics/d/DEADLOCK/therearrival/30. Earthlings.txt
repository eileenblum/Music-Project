thrown into your world
son of a gun
for sure the last man standing
when the sun is gone

thrown into your world
upside-down
i am the monster reaching out
for your crown

always - remember my words

as you make your bed you must lie
time to sleep, mankind - time to die
i think, tomorrow for you just won't make it
as I am the monster you created

humanity's bastard sons - are you ready?

humanity's bastard son
ready to do what has to be done
a funeral feast for all the deceased

bring back beauty while your priests preach
a life of decay
a call to arms for the weak - today is the day

let me free this world of all parasites
now as I am the only one alive
i thank your god, only once, for he created
suicide

when on earth - do as earthlings do
when on earth - earthlings, shame on you
