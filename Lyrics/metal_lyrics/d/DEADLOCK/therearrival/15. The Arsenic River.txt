underwater in the arsenic river
our lungs collapsed in our hollow chests

what have our demons done?
is this the shape of things to come?
what have our demons done?
what have we become?

every single spoken word monotone
each and every color monochrome  
every feeling, I am feeling (I am feeling) overthrown
and caught inside this monologue

we have become machine men with black hearts
and machine minds playing their game of crowns

iâm feeling numb
as always caught
only seeking forgiveness
the only way out

underwater in the arsenic river
no lungs to breathe inside our hollow chests
