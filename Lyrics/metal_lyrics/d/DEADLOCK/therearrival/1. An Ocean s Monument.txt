We put the fear of God into this world
We lost the war on the non-existent
We fought the greed of men among the dead
Altruistic, systematic.

Down your love so I can drown, so I can drown my shame.
Bring the drugs so I can numb, so I can numb my pain.

You cried out the pain in words like plagues
A serpentine monument for the lambs.
OâBrother â What made us fall from grace?
Destructive, systematic.

An ocean
Of broken glass.
An ocean
To drown the rats.

Down your love so I can drown, so I can drown my shame.
Bring the drugs so I can numb, so I can numb my pain.
Drown your thoughts to let me dream, to let me dream again.
And go with all the guilt and shame a thousand times â in vain.

An oceanâs monument.
An oceanâs monument.
An oceanâs monument.
An oceanâs monument.
An oceanâs monument.
An oceanâs monument.
An oceanâs monument.
An oceanâs monument.

Down your love so I can drown, so I can drown my shame.
Bring the drugs so I can numb, so I can numb my pain.
Drown your thoughts to let me dream, to let me dream again.
And go with all the guilt and shame a thousand times â in vain.
