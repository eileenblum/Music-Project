Sometimes the words of other people not having the same outlook on life are like beeshaving one sting you is not a real problembut when thousands sting you your attitude is exposed to dangerbut just like a bee-sting these words can insult you just onceand sooner or later you will send every attack back to them so they have to expect to get their fingers burned if they want to play with fire
