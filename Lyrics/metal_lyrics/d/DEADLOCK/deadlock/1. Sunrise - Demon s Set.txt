It's something like a demon and he tries to take possession of everything near at handonce under his control nothing will be like it was beforefrom that time on you lose you will lose everythingalone and hopeless in a world full of despair caused by your weakness your ignorance your incapabilityNo good will come of itthe sun goes down and you try to dream yourself away and in your dream you are walking through a garden but without flowers without trees- just devastation just ravageÂ and in your dream you are searching for a friend for a helping hand- but these hands just drag you down and in your dream there's no end in sightthere's no way out- these demons wrack everythingand so you sneak through the darkness hunted by the demonsis there any hope to get out or to find a place to hideÂno.no.noÂ because everything is just an illusionan illusionyou are deluding yourselfÂ so go out and face the demongo out and face your fearand if your will is strong enough you will be free againÂ xxx
