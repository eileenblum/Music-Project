another heart another life just another test
another murder another lie just another death

and ours is to suffer for you want always more
and ours is to suffer cause you kill all that we adore

I don't need no master to command
I am the law by myself

paradise is falling down
and you try to leave this good damn town
and your world is burning down
like rats forsaking a sinking ship
down to your knees and pray

but we shall all bleed together eternally
for this is the hell we all created

another heart another life just another breath
another place another world just another chance

and ours is to suffer for you want always more
and ours is to suffer cause you kill all that we adore

(are we so fucking exhausted with our lives or just so satisfied with being slaves)
what kind of paradise are you creating here
what the fuck do you expect

paradise is falling down
and you try to leave this good damn town
and your world is burning down
like rats forsaking a sinking ship
down to your knees and pray

but we shall all bleed together eternally
for this is the hell we all created

with every lie you whisper to our ears
(while you wander through all you created)
a town underfed with love born up from pain
(there will be no more water
while your paradise is burning down)

but we shall all bleed together eternally
for this is the hell we all created
