Do you remember all the innocent once were sacred
Do you remember the time we once all were heaven sent

These darkened clouds have lead us here
Oh how I wish that I could die
You faggot you ruined the code of honor

You ruined the code of honor and now we have to live amongst the dead
You ruined the code of honor no turning back

Do you remember all the beauty we once created
Do you remember the time our love seemed to have no end

remove me from this deception mankind called emotion
I have chosen my heaven while you create your own hell
your city of liberty out of decay is just a dream

You ruined the code of honor and now we have to live amongst the dead
You ruined the code of honor no turning back

I wish I could die now

(nobody will ever raise beauty out of decay)
oh how I wish I could die
just to live another day
you were heaven sent but now spread damnation
you ruined the code of honor

You ruined the code of honor and now we have to live amongst the dead
You ruined the code of honor no turning back
