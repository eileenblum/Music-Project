executioners, raise your swords
avengers, these lives are yours

let us start with the end now, prepare their graves
their lives are worth nothing, their hearts even less
so comrades come on, let us teach them respect
so comrades come on now, lets rip some flesh

Let us start with the end now
Lets rip some flesh

And in the end they will pray that the sun also shines in hell
Far away from the others removed from the rest of the world

They will regret what they did
There is no peace for the insincere

Let us start with the end now
Lets rip some flesh

executioners, raise your swords
avengers, these lives are yours

And in the end you will pray that the sun also shines in hell
For a person such as yourself can only life under the earth

You are a worthless fool, rotten and stinking
Even the devil himself will not accept you in hell
