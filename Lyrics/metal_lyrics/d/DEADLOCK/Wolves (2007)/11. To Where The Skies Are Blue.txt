sun goes down once again
while I sit here and feel the tears
running down my cheeks
no I am not afraid of the dark
but the darker it gets the more I realize
that there is no one to depend on
no one to believe in
And so I wait to die here all alone
like the daylight dies while it is fading away
because nobody knows for sure
that the sun will burn through that cold night once more

...to where the skies are blue...

So I pray for someone
to come and make my life seem like it's still worth living it
So I pray for you to come
(to push me out from that darkness
and take me to that place where the skies are always blue....
nothing destroys me more than the thought of loosing this feeling
nothing completes me more like you do)
And so I wait to die here all alone
like the daylight dies while it is fading away
because nobody knows for sure
that the sun will burn through that cold night once more
but still the hardest things to say
are the words that mean the most
So come on angel, say that you
love me and nothing in this
world will ever scare me again.
Take me to where the skies are always blue...
