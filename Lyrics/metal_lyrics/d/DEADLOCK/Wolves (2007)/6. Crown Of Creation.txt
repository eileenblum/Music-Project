Pass on these tidings my dearest friends
Today the blades of our knifes will turn red
Listen now everybody! You the crown of creation
we don't really care if you brake your neck!

You have perfected absolutely nothing,
In your world where lies, greed and intolerance reign
In your Kingdom of the blind, where the one eyed man is king
a picture of misery

Maybe some are born to wander blind
And some are born into that never ending night
But we are not, so lets unite
And bring to their cities the final fight

Because they will never know the real value of life
Without feeling pain with their own bodies
Lets break apart whats left of their hearts
(And bring creation to a new promising start)
we don't really care if you brake your neck!

Yesterday you murdered with one foot in the grave
Today we will bury you as credit to all the brave
In your Kingdom of the blind, where the one eyed man is king
a picture of misery

In your Kingdom of the blind there is nobody left that remembers your name
You the crown of creation, creation of shame!

Maybe some are born to wander blind
And some are born into that never ending night
But we are not, so lets unite
And bring to their cities the final fight

All lives are equal!
Who ever breaks this oath, knows the price to pay
crown of creation, drowning in blood!
crown of creation, creation of shame!

And tomorrow there will be nobody left that remembers your name,
You were the crown of creation, creation of shame!

Maybe some are born to wander blind
And some are born into that never ending night
But we are not, so lets unite
And bring to their cities the final fight
