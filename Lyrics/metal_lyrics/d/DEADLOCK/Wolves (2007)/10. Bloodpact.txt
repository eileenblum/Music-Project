they are no men- they are nothing
a carcass- bloated by shame
and as their blood fills the skies our love for humanity faded became jaded

this is our blood pact we are all brothers in blood!

It's not your world it is ours,
You are just a maggot in our flesh
and as their blood fills the skies it's time to remind them of their mortal lives

these false hopes for a never coming paradise

we once concluded a pact
a pact written in blood
and now that night becomes day
we go shatter their dreams

we once concluded this pact
this pact written in our blood
and we now love to spray fire
on their worlds burning down!

In our world you are useless
Not worth a single tear
And as your blood fills the skies we sit down and enjoy your very last breath your last heart-beat

this is our blood pact we are all brothers in blood!

now these old worlds fade away
while the wolves put their lives astray

this is our blood pact we are all brothers in blood!

in a night where all creatures are equal
it is time for the blood pact sequel

we once concluded a pact
a pact written in blood
and now that night becomes day
we go shatter their dreams

we once concluded this pact
this pact written in our blood
and we now love to spray fire
on their worlds burning down!
