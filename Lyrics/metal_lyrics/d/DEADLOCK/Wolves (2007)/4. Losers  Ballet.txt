come on now you sinners and angels without wings
the dance of the fools is about to begin
why should you fear what cannot be avoided
it is time to dance your lives away
it's the losers ballet
the mission is set - let it be done

put on your dancing shoes before you enter the heat of the ballroom
enjoy the masses coming to see you perform
while you dance in the fire of your world going down
and you will dance like the maggots in your flesh

come on now you sinners and angels without wings
the dance of the fools is about to begin
why should you fear what cannot be avoided
it is time to dance your lives away
it's the losers ballet
the mission is set - let it be done

so come on and dance like there is no tomorrow
and I promise that there will be no tomorrow for you
how elegantly you dance you little son of a whore
set by step till your feet start to bleed - bleeding to death
and you will dance like the maggots in your flesh

first position: wolves leave their marks in your misbegotten body
second position: blood stains each of your dancing steps
third position: you are alone on the dance floor - a dance with wolves
fourth position: they are howling while the hordes from hell come for you
the fifth and last position: close your eyes loser, before you grow cold

and angels soar into the sky
while hell is coming down on you
this was your last dance
in the losers ballet
