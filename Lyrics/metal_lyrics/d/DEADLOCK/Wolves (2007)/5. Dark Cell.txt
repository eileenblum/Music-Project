behind the doors of my dark cell
I wounded my hands on these chains
I have been locked into that cage for so long
so please come let me out

a lifetime of pain cuts my body like razorblades

I have got some plans for you
come let me out and play
I have got some plans for myself too
I just want to live free

give me just one good reason why should I believe

why does that way to heaven seem to be too far for me
what have I done to deserve this and how much pain can I take

why is that door to my cage always locked from the outside

oh that chains what a torture
loosen them if only for a moment
let that broken heart breathe again

why is that door to my cage always locked from the outside
the more time that passes, the greater my suffering grows
I drag myself forwards, backwards and around in a circle
so come on breathe my broken heart

why does that way to heaven seem to be too far for me
what have I done to deserve this and how much pain can I take
