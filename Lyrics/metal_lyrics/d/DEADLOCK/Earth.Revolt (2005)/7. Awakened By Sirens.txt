By the light of the moon dark thoughts rise upâ¦they haunt my dreams
while the wind carries their voices and screams over the land
Awakened by sirens, armed with the wrath of Gods, we ride the storm, may our rage defend creation
Under cover of darkness you raped innocent life
beneath the bleeding horizon your end`s now justified
By the light of the moon dark thoughts rise up...
now we haunt your dreams while the wind carries our warcries to your empires
