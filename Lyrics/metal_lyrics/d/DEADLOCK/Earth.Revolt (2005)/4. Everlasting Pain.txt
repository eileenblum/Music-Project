may your weapons melt like wax in the fire of the burning skies.
may your armies be torn apart while the storm goes berserk
now hold on to your life built on lies and exploitation
hold on to your wasted life and pray to your god
you hold on to your life and beg for salvation
still hold on to your life there is no place to hide
because we are reborn in flames and purified in our own blood
...and your pain shall be everlasting...
may your kindred watch us pronouncing sentence
now you walk the endless road from heaven to hell
with every step you take you can feel the pain
you filled thousands with sorrow and now you get it all back
...and you pain shall be everlasting....
