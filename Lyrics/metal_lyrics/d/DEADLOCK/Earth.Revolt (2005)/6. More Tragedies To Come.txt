away away from here beyond the reaches of the plague, the ravens return, demons rising...
they spew death across the skies and leave the world in flames.
Away away from here beyond the faces of the dead now drag me through this hell,
while the crows will cry for more tragedies to come.
Away away from here beyond the bloodred battlefields I try to spread my wings and fly...
Now as the end is near, sun is set -forever gone, beautiful days will never come again....
now as your end is near. Deeper deeper fall away from paradise, in these days we spew death across the skies...
Away away from here...
