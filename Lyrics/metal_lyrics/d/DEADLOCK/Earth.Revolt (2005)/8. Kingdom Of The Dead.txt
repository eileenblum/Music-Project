kingdom of the dead. world breaks apart. thunder spreads across the lands.
Now we`ve come here to kill you and we won`t leave until you died.
In your blood we kneel emotionless we`ll watch your end.
Now we`ve come here to kill you and we won`t leave until you died.
Soon you will be king in your kingdom of the dead...
endless torture laments of fear no mourning your kingdom`s near
While the earth is crying mankind`s slowly dying we stand in the ruins of civilization
Mankind`s slowly dying we spit on your grave the kingdom of the dead.
