"Fire! [12x]
The Arsonist! [2x]

No consolation - no you won't fail
Generations to be impaled
The order of old is non-existent
Is this death worth living for? 

What will remain - my dearest desire - is fire [4x]
The earth will turn to a funeral pyre - fire! [4x]

The aronist! [2x]

In dry rivers man seeks to drown
Keep desires, faith carves in stone
Now seek out, cut down the demon's curse
In vain... We perish with the earth!

Now! They die by words of fire...
Now! And this is what remains

Fire! [4x]

What will remain - my dearest desire - is fire [4x]
The earth will turn to a funeral pyre - fire! [4x]

The Arsonist! [4x]"
