"Once born in the arms of god
But only to surrender
To something greater than us
To a great pretender!

When you are walking- where do you go?
What is there to get? What is there to know?
When you are walking- where do you go?
What is there to get? What is there to know?
I will follow!

Once born in the arms of god
I ran into the storm
Into the hopeless sea engullfed
All visions broken, dropped and torn

We will prevail - They're blessed to fail!

When you are walking- where do you go?
What is there to get? What is there to know?
When you are walking- where do you go?
What is there to get? What is there to know?
I will follow!

We will never surrender to your great pretender
We will prevail - They're blessed to fail
We will prevail - Pretenders - They're blessed to fail

When you are walking- where do you go?
What is there to get? What is there to know?
When you are walking- where do you go?
What is there to get?

I will follow!

When you are walking- where do you go?
What is there to get? What is there to know?
When you are walking- where do you go?
What is there to get?

I will follow

I will follow"
