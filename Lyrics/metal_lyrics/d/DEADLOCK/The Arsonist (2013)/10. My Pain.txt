Night fades to day
And days fade to darkness
Please, let me out of here
I'm trapped in nothingness

Seems like this time is right to dry all of the tears - That I have cried
But I'm too weak - I feel so numb and isolated from everyone
A single tear escapes my eye - I cure my pain with a razor blade

Days have passed - Years gone by - Dreams torn apart
My cheating mind attempts to kill my aching heart

Seems like this time is right to dry all of the tears - That I have cried
But I'm too weak - I feel so numb and isolated from everyone
A single tear escapes my eye - I cure my pain with a razor blade

I cure my pain with a razor blade!

Seems like this time is right to dry all of the tears - That I have cried
But I'm too weak - I feel so numb and isolated from everyone...

Seems like this time is right to dry all of the tears - That I have cried
But I'm too weak - I feel so numb and isolated from everyone
A single tear escapes my eye - I cure my pain with a razor blade!
