I will lead you through a darkness divine
There is no light under a blood-red sky
...Take control of your world!

We are cursed 
Born in never-ending ignorance
We are cursed 
Seduced by words of sweet bitterness

There's no solace without a sacrifice
Ancient, diseased winds are going to rise
...Take control of this hell!

We are cursed 
Born in never-ending ignorance
We are cursed 
Seduced by words of sweet bitterness

Baptized in flames
Swim through the mire to come back as a new man
Atone for sins - a sacrifice of a heretic
Swim through the mire - break your empty visions
You won't find solace!
No you won't find solace!

...Take control of your world!

We are cursed 
Born in never-ending ignorance
We are cursed 
Seduced by words of sweet bitterness
Baptized in flames!
