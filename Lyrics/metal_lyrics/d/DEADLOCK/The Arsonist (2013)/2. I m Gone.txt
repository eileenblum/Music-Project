"Today we don't have dreams to chase - Just a promise
The hope is written in my face - I am gone...

The wish for better days - erased by memories
And buried under the soil
A promise in your blood, but nothings gonna change
There comes a point you'll realize

Today we don't have dreams to chase - Just a promise
The hope is written in my face - I am gone without a trace!

Too far - No eyes could see - a world in crushed dreams
It's touching me from inside....
A promise in your head, but nothings gonna change
There comes a point you'll realize!

Today we don't have dreams to chase - Just a promise
The hope is written in my face - I am gone without a trace!

A promise of a better place - forgotten dreams, forgotten past!
Times we've had were numbered days - in the end yesterdays wont last
Open your eyes just to make clear - no tears will blind your sight..
I apologize!

Today we don't have dreams to chase - Just a promise
The hope is written in my face - I am gone...

Today we don't have dreams to chase - Just a promise
The hope is written in my face - I am gone without a trace!

Just a promise!
Just a promise!
Just a promise!
Just a promise!
Just a promise!
Just a promise!
Just a promise!"
