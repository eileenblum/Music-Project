Pulling me under the water
Where human glory disappears
Escaping this life seems so easy
But I fear a thousand fears

Down to the bottom sand
Fragile life comes to end

Sailing in the sea of tears
Sorrow - I owe you everything
Sailing in the sea of tears
I can feel the hurt again

Guided by whispering voices
I feel the silence everywhere
Like memories from my past
Why should I live in a world where nothing lasts?

Down to the bottom sand
Fragile life comes to end

Sailing in the sea of tears
Sorrow - I owe you everything
Sailing in the sea of tears
I can feel the hurt again

Old thoughts are running through my head
Can I release myself from chains
Will I ever forgive myself

Sailing in the sea of tears
Sorrow - I owe you everything
Sailing in the sea of tears
I can feel the hurt again!

Oh I can feel...
Oh I can feel...
I can feel the hurt again!
Oh I can feel...
Oh I can feel...
I can feel the hurt again!
