We are sleepers in dead cities
This is what remains of our innocence
I die, I die a hundred times a day
Why has fate forsaken me?
Why has God forsaken me?

Only a broken lullaby
Dead city sleepers
Still taunts me
Through a sleepless night
Dead city sleepers

We are persecutors in pale shells
Who hide demons beneath their skins
We have planted dead and dying trees
Tell me why has God forsaken me

I died a hundred times
No more tears to cry
It's true that I'm caught in a lie
You ignored my cries

Only a broken lullaby
Dead city sleepers
Still taunts me
Through a sleepless night
Dead city sleepers

I died a hundred times
No more tears to cry
It's true that I'm caught in a lie
You ignored my cries

Only a broken lullaby
Still taunts me
Through a sleepless night

Only a broken lullaby
Dead city sleepers
Still taunts me
Through a sleepless night
Dead city sleepers

Oh through a sleepless night
