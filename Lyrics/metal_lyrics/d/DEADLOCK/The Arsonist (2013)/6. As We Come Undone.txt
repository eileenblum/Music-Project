Today we let the curtain rise
Generation occupied - 
Welcome to your empty lives
Led astray with blinded eyes
No more utter solitude -
Oppressive enough to escape your fate

We come undone
We burn away the path we're on
All hope is gone - as we come undone
While the great nations sleep

Idealists? Pacifists? Anarchists? Hypocrites!
Non-believers - starry-eyed
Drifted hope - comatose - social values - over-dosed
Gone astray with blinded minds

No more utter solitude -
Oppressive enough to escape your fate

We come undone
We burn away the path we're on
All hope is gone - as we come undone
While the great nations sleep

We die in slumber - escape
We die in slumber - from fate

We come undone
As we burn away the path we're on
All hope is gone..

We come undone
As we burn away the path we're on
All hope is gone - as we come undone
While the great nations sleep
