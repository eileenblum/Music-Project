With the three means of punishment words thoughts and acts ya shall not injure living things.
But what happens every day we lead thousands of creatures to the slaughter it is like the entrance in hell.
My thoughts gave my actions a battle and that's why I am here.
To give another battle to the ones who destroy the creation.
With humility I fall to my knees and pray for forgiveness.
But the immortal souls of the dead give rise to a demon.
That demon and his army of undead warriors prepare for reprisal.
And they will beat us with our own weapons.
Which means harm cruelty and death.
But we shall not cry we deserve to be punished.
And I will die with a smile on my face
