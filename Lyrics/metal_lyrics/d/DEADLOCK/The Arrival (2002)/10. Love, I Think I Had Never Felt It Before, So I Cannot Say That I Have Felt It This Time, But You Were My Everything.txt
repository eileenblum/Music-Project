Don't forget to kiss me before your train is going to leave this town.
I wish I had said it but I didn't.
And so you left this town and this beauty in the air was washed away.
My tearing heart remained.
Now cut it's arteries it shall bleed.
Let me die in your arms.
I loved you so much.
OK...
I had never felt I before so I cannot say that I have felt it this time but you were my everything.
The alienation became the bullet and the hatred became the pistol now pull the trigger and let me die in your arms.
You were my everything...
