The new prophets have arrived.
Let this be the battle cry for all these unlawful crowned heads.
They masquerade themselves as the bringers of freedom.
But shall we sell our souls to an institution in which freedom doesn't exist.
Then we will become truly victims of an ideology that keeps it's fellows small-minded.
They poison the innocence of our hearts by killing all of our dreams.
Let's stop carrying the crosses which they impose on us and which are the pillars of their heretical belief.
This artificial building will collapse and they will be buried.
The death of their thoughts is the birth of an overwhelming beauty that leads us through the darkest days.
And soon our lungs will breathe in the total freedom again.
"sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vrajo".
The new prophets have arrived they will enter the throne.
They are godlike now fall to their knees.
(and they will choose your fate).
The new prophets have arrived...
