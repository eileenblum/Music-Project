So sad of being here.
So glad of being free.
Not dazzled of your temptations.
The aim to live truly free is the first step forward.
In not giving in your pathetic life.
Carve your self-made cool guy mask and wear it whenever you can.
You are so overwhelming.
You are my hero.
You can change your style again and again it doesn't matter.
Never ever asking why.
Never ever live a lie.
Just to be seen in your scene
Every conversation you take and every smile you smile.
I'm so tired but...
(you will do it to it's bitter end it doesn't matter).
Oh no it's just the everyman's behaviour.
But oh my dear and beautiful god I recognise that I'm guilty of this too.
To bring me a relief is my belief.
So I will take the consequence and metamorph into a demon.
Shall I kill the time...
I never want to but I will kill and I will drink my victims' blood.
And I will squeeze it out of their bodies.
The vampire takes control.
Haemoglobin is the drug and I will kill...
