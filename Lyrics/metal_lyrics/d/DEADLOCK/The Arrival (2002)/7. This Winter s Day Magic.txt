This winter day's magic seems not to be noticed by me again...
Tired and uninspired.
Oh yes the song I listen to says so much.
But is it really my fault should I be more open-hearted.
Should I completely change myself to start being loved by people I don't love.
Or should I always smile and start talking to those people.
But I hate those conversations those I hope they soon run dry.
And the circle seems to close itself.
Apathy spreads it's wings.
This winter day's magic seems not to be noticed by me again...
So I wait for your call because I need you there.
But the phone doesn't ring.
Depression embrace my soul.
Frustration tears my heart again and again...
