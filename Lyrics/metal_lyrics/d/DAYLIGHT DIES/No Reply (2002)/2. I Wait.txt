things in this world
seem so far away
once again i wonder
where i am

somewhere someone's
speaking
but i cannot hear

and once again it all
falls apart
but still i wait here trying
to find some remnant of myself

my days a dull aching
please tell me what
i'm waiting for

things in this world
have never seems so gray
once again i wonder
what i've become

somewhere something's breaking
this world's so dead
when i cannot feel
what's in my head
