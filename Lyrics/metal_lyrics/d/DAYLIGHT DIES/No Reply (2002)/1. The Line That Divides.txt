there is a pain that comes
from holding on too long
a subtle knife that scrapes the veins

we both know i'm leaving
i'm already gone
even if i'm here today

the line that defines
the shape of our lives
slowly bleeds into gray

the line that divides
this world from my mind
can only lead me away

this ever present terror
of what each day will bring
that i won't find the strength
to live

alive enough to see
just how far away i am
from where i really need to be
