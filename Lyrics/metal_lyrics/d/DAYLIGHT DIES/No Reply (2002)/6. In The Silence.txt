now in this silence
this silence of my life
empty words
fall
though this sound

like falls dead leaves
i float down this stream
waiting
for the waters
to drown me

why can i never say
what must be said
am i too afraid
that they
will take it all away

now in this silence
i watch as my life
fades away
