four corners, neatly cleaned
bone white clock
counts away
seconds of life

another year
passes away
quietly, carefully
wrapped
in promises of change

how many times must i look back
counting my mistakes
how many empty lives like mine
begin and end each day

slowly moving, shifting shapes
dead memories, wandering
lost
stealing my sleep
