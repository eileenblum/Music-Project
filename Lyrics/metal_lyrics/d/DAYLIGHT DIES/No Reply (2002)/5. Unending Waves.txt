i have memories
clouded by sorrow
of a time in life
when blood ran though my veins

but these walls keep closing
suffocating
and now i'm trapped beneath
the weight of my own loss

in the company
of my misery
i gasp for air
only to drown
again

unending waves of memories
life's only gife bestowed to me

regret
every moment marks
a breaking of my heart
and now i'm left alone
with this ghost that i've become
for years i've built
this monument of pain
i must find a way
to never feel again
