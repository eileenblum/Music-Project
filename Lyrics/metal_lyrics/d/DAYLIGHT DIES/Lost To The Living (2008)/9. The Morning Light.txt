Blurred and pale
I saw your face
As my body rests
Everything has languished
But the sense
Of a memory fading

The morning light
So thin I can feel it breaking
It crosses the wall
Towards my body

The wall above
I saw it changing
In the morning light
Emptiness expanding
Wounds kept fresh
Through careful tending


Thanks to corteo for correcting track #9 lyrics.
