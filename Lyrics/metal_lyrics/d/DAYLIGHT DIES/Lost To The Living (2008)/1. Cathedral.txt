A monument
Of failure
A testament
To an unfailing will

Against the sky stands our cathedral
A picture of our isolation
In the dark we must build an answer
At any cost

Measured symmetry
Belies desperation
An attempt to write in stone
The dreams of the young

Against the sky stands our cathedral
A picture of our isolation
In the dark we must build an answer

A pillar to our fleeting solace

Against the sky stands our cathedral
Clutching at the passing time
It was built to be an answer
Take from it what you can
