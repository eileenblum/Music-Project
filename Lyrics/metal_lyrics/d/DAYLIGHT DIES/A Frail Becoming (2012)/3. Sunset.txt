Let's watch the sky fall
Consign to grave the dying day
In lingering amber light
An eventide's forgotten name

Yellow bleeds
Into cold gray hues
Stretched out and severing
Torn in two
Under these same skies
I lost myself

Let's watch the sky fall
Await the world to take us whole
Let's watch the sun fade
Abide in what cannot console

Yellow bleeds
Into cold gray hues
Stretched out and severing
Torn in two
Under these same skies
I lost myself
