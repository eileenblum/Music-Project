Ghost
Passing through
...faceless fleeting
Infidel
Shadows remained
And all else
Was cast out with the tide

I dredge the depths
To find a meaning
Obscured by time
I search horizons yearning for answers
To who I am

Voices
An echo of the past
Diminishing
Leaving silence in your wake

I dredge the depths
To find a meaning
Obscured by time
I search horizons yearning for answers
To who I am

Dredging the depths
For meaning
Obscured by time
Searching horizons
For answers
I'll never find
