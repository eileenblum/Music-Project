our dreams are ephemeral
an elusive blur
defenseless without devotion
compromised by indifference

adrift and asleep
unconscious to transgression
the noise of the world
the thief of what once defined

oceans of distractions
run rings round our eyes
awake enough to realize
we re tethered to the world

adrift and asleep
unconscious to transgression
the noise of the world
the thief of what once defined us
