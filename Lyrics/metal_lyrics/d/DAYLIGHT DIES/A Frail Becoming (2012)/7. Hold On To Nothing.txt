Edge of the world
Staring into the abyss
Gasping
As the hopelessness
That I have nothing more to give

When the ground
Has fallen from beneath
Grasp
At the void
As life slips from view
What remains
To hold on to

Hour of dread
Staring headlong at the end
Falling
Into nothingness
There is nothing left to lose

When life slipped from view
Nothing remained
To pull us through
