Hollow
Bereft of heart
Time hemorrhaging
Bleeding
Torn apart
Soul atrophied
The fires
That forged our souls
The embers have gone dark

Our eyes so blind we can't see
Our minds die as our souls weep
The life choked out by the hand that feeds

A final knife
In the back
The wound
Straight through the heart

Our eyes so blind we can't see
Our minds die as our souls weep
The life choked out by the hand that feeds
The air so thin we can't breathe
Our souls decay as our minds sleep
Our backs broken by the hands that feed
