Devoid of life
There is no light
Pursued by grief
Relentless
Undaunted

Loss of self
Into soullessness
Slipping away
To nothingness

Will to live
Cast aside
A hope
I cannot recognize 

Loss of self
Into soullessness
Slipping away
To nothingness

Haunted by sorrow
And perpetual death
Pursued by grief
Through this dominion of ruin
My kingdom of emptiness

Emptiness
