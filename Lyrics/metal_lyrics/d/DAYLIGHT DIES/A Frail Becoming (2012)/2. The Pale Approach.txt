Sun's warming light
Gives way to branches
Gilded in crimson and gold
A subtle chill
As shadows grow long

Autumn arrives
On wind in trees
Rust and firelight
Weave tapestries

Last glimpse of life
As color gives way
To impending gray
The pale approach
Of bitter, fucking cold

Winter arrives
On frozen leaves
Frost and candlelight
Autumn's reprieve
