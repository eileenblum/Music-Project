i have memories
clouded by sorrow
of a time in life when blood ran through my veins
but these walls keep closing
suffocating
and now I'm trapped beneath the weight of my own loss
in the company...of my misery
i gasp for air, only to drown again
unending waves of memories
lifes only gift bestowed to me
...regret
every moment marks
a breaking of my heart
now i'm left alone
with this ghost that i've become
for years i've built this monument of pain
i must find a way
to never feel again
i made the mistake of wanting
something real, and i saw it die
i paid the price for thinking,
it was true when it was all a lie
