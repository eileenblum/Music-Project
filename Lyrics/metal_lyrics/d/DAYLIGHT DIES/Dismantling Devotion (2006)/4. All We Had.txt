This pen
The cruelest blade
The power of
Merciless words to endear
With clinched fist clinched teeth
And burning words
I take my leave

Embers
Memories
Charred remnants
Of all that we had
The demise of all we were

Wisdom
Of futile years
Affinity
Ceasing this wintering of me
A final look
One last glance
And the burning words I take my leave

Embers
Memories
Charred remnants
Of all that we had
The demise of all we were
