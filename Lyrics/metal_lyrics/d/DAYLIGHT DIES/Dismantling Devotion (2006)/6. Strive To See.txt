This deadlocked
Our failure
Draped in vows
A dead letter
An altar stripped
To the ground

To all things
We could not overcome
And all we lost
For all the faith that
We will cast aside
And all we lost along the way

Dead silence
That echoes
In our stare
Dead ending
Abandoned lives
In disrepair

To all things
We could not overcome
And all we lost
For all the faith that
We will cast aside
And all we lost along the way

Dissolving
In slow motion
This deathbed
Of devotion
