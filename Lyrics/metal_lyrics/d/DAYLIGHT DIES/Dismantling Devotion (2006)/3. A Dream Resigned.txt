Around my waist
Are the stones I have tied
The weight
Of choices made
Diverting thoughts
Of a dream resigned

I repress
I evade
Total disregard
You bear the burden
And I will carry on

Throes of regret
That course through my mind
The Pain
Of careless ways
Divulging thoughts
Of a dream resigned

I repress
I evade
Total disregard
You bear the burden
And I will carry on

The price we pay for
The things that haunt us
