White stained red
Of vacant eyes
The hallow dreams
Of a barren life
Saline solutions
Yield no resolutions

Sleepwalk through
This pain induced
Coma of wakefulness
My lungs draw air
But in this body
There is no life

Pale washed red
Of crimson dreams
A lifeless glare
At a loveless world
Sanguine solutions
To hope's dissolution

Tomorrow's turmoil tonight
Carbon mirrors of my yesterdays

Sleepwalk through
This life induced
Coma of wakefulness
My lungs drew air
Now in this body
There is no pain
