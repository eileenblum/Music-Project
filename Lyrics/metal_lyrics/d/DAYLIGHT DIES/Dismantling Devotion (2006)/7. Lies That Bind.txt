Deafening
Quiet
That falls on
Blind hearts
Unspoken
Implicit
These words so

Faithless
Are the lies that
Bind us
With truth
Disclosed by silence
A fragile trust
Weathered and lost

Time may dull
But will never heal
Scars hewn by
Unspoken deception
And wordless honesty

Leaving nothing
But a broken life
A shattered lie
And all we had
Lost

Time may dull
But will never heal
Scars hewn by
Unspoken deception
And wordless honesty
