Paid to pretend,
means to oppressive ends
Say what you will,
plenty of truth to bend
Syndicate, simulate
stay away from authentic words
Reinforce the fear of what was not seen
and can't be heard

Take the fear, make it real
Tell them what they all should feel
Oblivious to what is true,
what you don't know will hurt you
Influence in the wrong hands,
model a puppet call it a fan
Lead the way, the world will follow
Entertainment today,
empire tomorrow

Appeal to primal nature,
provide the image of truth
They all would live and die for
Intimidate, contaminate,
annihilate their sense of right and wrong
Panic is today's hot new fashion

If it bleeds it leads, if it's pure just lie
And if it's innocent, then it fucking dies
Breaking news, this just in
We built the coffin you'll be buried in

Breaking the silence, removing the thorn
Repaying the violence, complacent no more
No concept of mercy, you taught us to hate
A disaster too late
