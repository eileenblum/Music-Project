What would you do
With a chance to
take back the past?
If you could,
Would you stand
to be a man at last,
I see, your'e nothing more to me
Than a pathetic wretch of society
You spit in my face
Displacing the blame
for your obvious disgrace
You tried to step on my name
just to bring yours up
And get a taste
of what you wasted

The past is obsolete
Events that won't repeat
Let go, while hanging on to this
Wake up and feel
This blood that you cannot bleed

I'm laughing as you spiral down
You're a self proclaimed king
who never had a crown
You're just a fool playing
on and on in your paradise
Echoing without a sound

A detriment that was left behind
You're a cheated king
only in your mind
Keep playing on but
You're a fool to believe
you're not wrong
Farewell, your reign is gone
