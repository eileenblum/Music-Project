A life in which time
won't carry on
Actions seen as neither
right or wrong
No reason, confused and
lost morals are the cost
Unaware, can't connect
a cause with its effect
Guilty of sequential neglect

World's sense of time
falsely inclined,
premonition denied
Life without sense,
no consequence, deliverance
Reckless futility, confined

Ignorance, futureless
Apocalyptic repetition,
live every moment
as if it were your last one
Reckless abandon
Chronological insanity,
sinners blind to the
error of their ways
Global virtuistic haze

All that you see,
and that will ever be,
abandoned
Life gone astray,
world in disarray,
price that you pay
Living without a reason
