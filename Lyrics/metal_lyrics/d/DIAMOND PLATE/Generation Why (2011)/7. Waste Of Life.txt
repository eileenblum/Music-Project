Obsession lies in
counting down the days
Afraid to die,
cerebral maze
Life, self preservation
Decaying mind,
disintegration

Fear rises,
the years go by
Contemplation,
psycho-analyze
Protection complexion
can't outrun
imminent outcome,
death prevention

Deathly afraid to die,
living a lie, waste of a life
Fear of the reaper's scythe
Avoid inevitable doom,
terror destroys and consumes
Disillusions are resumed, consumed

Release me from premeditated pain
Hate consumes me
Waste of life, already died

Release from panic is the prize,
futile existence realized
Solution suicide

Conquer despair, terror
Meet death without a care
