Victory is a long forgotten past
Memories never to outlast
Apparition of things I've seen before
My mind is a casualty of war

Enemies, vivid scenes,
violent screams
Nameless man, fallen land,
for which it stands

Fight - for god, for freedom
War without a reason
Kill just for the thrill

Lies
Lies that affected my
Mind
I just did what they told me was
Right
Was what I did justified?

Hope is gone, my final night
Sanity is a privilege not a right
Leave me, be gone, haunting no more
I am now a casualty of war

Fight
Their War
And kill your mind
