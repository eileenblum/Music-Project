The time is nearing,
indecision searing
Remain on the path that is not veering
It only takes one to decide,
the journey and the destination
The truth comes from the inside,
from your own vision

Breaking free, from the herd
Making fact of the absurd
Rise above the destiny that you've been fed
Heed the voice that's in your head
Strive for the life from which they've fled
Don't let their jealousy take its toll

Your tourniquet,
can't keep the will from my soul
When there's nothing left,
my spirit digs a deeper whole
Eyes that see today in a different way
Burying within you, a tomb with a view

Shed a tear for the oppressed
Scoff at the addict
Cry for all the pain that you see,
but not for me

Disregard what they say
Find your place another way
Keep pushing forward to your dream
until it's dead

This is your tomb, enjoy the view
