Witness the fall

I ask you why? Life isn't fair
Why should I pretend to even care?
I ask you why? My only plan
Is to run away as fast as I can

Wake up, it's that time,
18 years late for a life
You always fantasize, but only criticize
Purpose in disguise
What you believe
Is never wrong, but never right
A future once so bright
Shot down for an average life

Afraid of what might be
Don't care what could have been
Went down the wrong road again
The path of least resistance
Leads you to the suburbs of existence

With eyes of gold and hearts of black
Living by a clock that can't be turned back
The world cries because
we've left our future to die
With Generation Why?

(Why?) Can't I pretend
That it will all work out in the end?
Not bort to lead, why can't I follow?
I'll seize the day tomorrow

I get my dose of reality from a talking box
I take a pill and my problems are all gone
I slam the door when opportunity knocks

I ask you
Why ask Why?
