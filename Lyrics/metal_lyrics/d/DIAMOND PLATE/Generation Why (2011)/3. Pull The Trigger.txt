A deadly game of chance
falsely trying to advance
Enhanced probability, maximum futility
Expressive killings without vigor
It's time to pull the trigger
Pull the...

Falling down a path
A path that leads to nothing
The end all, be all of self destruction
Apex of stupidity
An honest piece of artistry
is something you wouldn't know
A gun to the head of the industry
ready to unload.

Free fall of integrity, constant meltdown
Renounce your sense of dignity
And spin the chamber around

Another round of cleansing
It might be your time to let go
Blacklist of six; you'll cease to exist
An entity nobody knows
Just one squeeze and it's over, no mistake
Death is something even you can't fake

When all is said and done
All that's left is none
Praised for victory
When the game is far from won

A practice in futility
Breakthrough in stupidity
Pull the trigger and see

Music filled with lead
Who has won when we're all dead?
