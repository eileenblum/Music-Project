Dive in. If that's all it takes
To forget all of my mistakes
It's all I want, and all I see
I'd give anything to be a part of this machine

What you see will never make you what you want to be

I hold this glass in my hand
In hopes to find and understand
You're at the bottom of the glass

Another drink, and I feel the sting
This life I've found isn't anything
In control, but You're still a slave
From the cradle to the grave. I found the ocean you can have
The wave

What you see will never make you what you want to be

I hold this glass in my hand
In hopes to find and understand
You're at the bottom of the glass
