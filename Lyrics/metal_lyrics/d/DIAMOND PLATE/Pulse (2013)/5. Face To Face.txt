Hold your breath don't make a sound
Abusing death to keep your feet off the ground

Turn on. Turn in. Drop out. Shoot in
Figure it out. Find a way out
Turn on. Tune in. You're out. You're in
Figure it out. Figure it out

Face to face with a state deranged
Reality just stays the same
Face to face. Now it stops
Then it starts again

Close your eyes
The snake that leads you blind
Is just a villain in disguise
That kills your mind ti stay alive

Turn on. Tune in. Drop out. Shoot in
Figure it out. Get rid of the doubt
Turn on. Tune in. Drop out. You're in
You figured it out. There's no way out

Face to face with a state deranged
Reality just stays the same
Face to face. Now it stops
It never stops

Descend into a state deranged
Reality just stays the same
Face to face. Now it stops
Make it stop
