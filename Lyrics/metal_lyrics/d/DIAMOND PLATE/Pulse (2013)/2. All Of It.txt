How can it be you feel the need to test my patience
Accusing me, haunting me, am I so selfish?
A day of rest too much to ask for
speak my mind and I'm put on blast
Answering the same old questions
How can you say you understand?

Swallow the anger, force the smile
Tell myself that I'll be over in a while
I know nothing's wrong
A worthless chess game, I am the pawn
Promise makes way to regret
I hate that I cannot forget

The pain, it just ain't a word
The hate, the lies, in vain, all of it

Back and forth you speak in circles
Cornering me with your words
It used to be so plain and simple
But it's easy to say you understand
Denial makes way to neglect
I hate that I cannot forget

The pain, it just ain't worth
The hate, the lies, in vain, all of it
Every last all of it

All of it amounted to nothing
Somehow it's crushing me beneath its weight
Playing the game the house of cards you built
Is burning me down, burning me down
All of it, every breath I ever wasted on it
Carried away
Never mattered anything I ever had to say... burn
Every last all of it
