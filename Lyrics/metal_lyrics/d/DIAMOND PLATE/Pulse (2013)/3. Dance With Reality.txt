One step forward, two steps backâ¦
To square one, easier said than done
Donât do what you know, but know what you do
It is what it is, you never had a clue
Know the ropes around your neck, how can you not trust yourself?

Dance with reality
This is my
Dance with reality

Give it to me straight, cut to the chase
Filling up with empty space
And the truth is the hardest pill to swallow
How could you trust yourself?

This is my
Dance with reality
This is my
Dance with reality

Trust me

Dance with reality
Will be the end of me
