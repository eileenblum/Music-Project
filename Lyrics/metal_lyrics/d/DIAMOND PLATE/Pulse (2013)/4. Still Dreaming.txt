How did I know, so long ago
That Iâd wake up missing all I know
How did I know, so long ago
Iâd still be dreaming, and so it goes

Fading in, without a doubt
Bleeding from the inside out
Iâm not moving on, time to run away
Save myself another day

Itâs all in your head, itâs all in your head
Feels like Iâm falling faster
Itâs all in your head, itâs all in your head
This dream becomes the master
Itâs all in your head, itâs all in your head
Iâll lie awake, Iâll run away
Itâs all in your head, itâs all in your head

Dig another hole, make it hollow
Show me what it takes to follow
Open up the door, thereâs nowhere else to hide
Guide me to the other side

Itâs all in your head, itâs all in your head
Feels like Iâm falling faster
Itâs all in your head, itâs all in your head
This dream becomes the master
Lie awake, run away
Itâs all in your head, itâs all in your head

How did I know, so long ago
That Iâd wake up missing all I know
Iâve seen it all, day after day
Nothing changes, Iâll still be dreaming

And now I know, day after day
Nothing changes, Iâll still be dreaming

Itâs all in your head, the dream is dead
