Living in the past, having been left behind
Trapped knee deep in the sands of time
Sinking deeper with each passing moment
Helpless as your breath is stolen
Caught up in a dream
Nothingâs as it seems

Where are you now

Let pass you by , keep blind your eye, the world around you
Keep on walking backwards all your life

Dismiss every piece of advice, never think twice
Owner of truth
So quick to put up a fight,
If youâre always right then thereâs nothing to lose
Problems mounting , disengage
Look for someone else to blame
The present never lasts when the future is your past

Where are you now

Let pass you by, keep blind your eye, the world around you
Keep on walking backwards all your life
Caught up in a dream, nothingâs as it seems
