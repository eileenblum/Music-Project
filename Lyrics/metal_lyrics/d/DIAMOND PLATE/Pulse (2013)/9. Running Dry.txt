Wake up to get in line. That's how it's designed
Another day it's all the same. They never change the game
Just killing time. There's plenty more to borrow
No hope. No cure for the disease they call tomorrow

Your life slips through your fingers
Insanity brings you to your knees again

Running dry. They've got you on your knees again
Running dry. Give and take it never ends

Searching for the beast that drives.
Struggle to win? Just survive
Live and die behind the wheel.
Remember what? What makes it real
Caught up. Caught up in a dream. Everything is as it seems
There's nothing left to say. The pulse that gives and takes away

Running dry. They've got you on your knees again
Running dry. Give and take it never ends
