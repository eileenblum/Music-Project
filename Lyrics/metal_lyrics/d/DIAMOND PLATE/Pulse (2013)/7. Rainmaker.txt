Life it seems goes on for miles. Just to pass you by
Disappears before it starts. Find the reason why
Carrying on,carrying on. You're not the only one
It's all in the way. It's all in the way you see the sun

Let it be, let it be, let the vultures feed
Take it away, take it away, end the suffering
Let it be, let it be, let the vultures feed
Take it away, take it away, end the suffering

Day turns to night in the sunset of his mind
Searching for an answer that he will never find
Carrying on, carrying on
The more you chase the more it runs
It's all in the way. It's all in the way. You'll never see the sun

Let it be. Let it be. Let the vultures feed
Take it away. Take it away. End the suffering
