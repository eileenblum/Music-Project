CAN YOU FEEL IT BUILDING
DEVASTATION IS ON THE WAY 
FEEL THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK
AS THE RUSH BEGINS

YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY 
I EARNED THIS WITH SWEAT AND BLOOD
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY
TAKE WHAT'S MINE

BREATHING NEW LIFE BACK INTO ME
CHALLENGING ALL THE POWERS THAT BE

CAN YOU FEEL IT SLIPPING
AS YOU LOSE YOUR GRIP ON ME
CAN YOU FACE THAT I WON IN THE END
I CAN'T KEEP FROM LAUGHING

YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY 
I EARNED THIS WITH SWEAT AND BLOOD
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY
TAKE WHAT'S MINE

BREATHING NEW LIFE BACK INTO ME
CHALLENGING ALL THE POWERS THAT BE
BREATHING NEW LIFE BACK INTO ME
CHALLENGING ALL THE POWERS THAT BE

DON'T YOU SEE IT COMING
WHEN YOU'VE CAUGHT ON, IT'S TOO LATE
WHEN IT HITS, DON'T FORGET WHO I AM
DON'T FORGET THIS FACE

YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY 
I EARNED THIS WITH SWEAT AND BLOOD
YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY
TAKE WHAT'S MINE

BREATHING NEW LIFE BACK INTO ME
CHALLENGING ALL THE POWERS THAT BE
BREATHING NEW LIFE BACK INTO ME
CHALLENGING ALL THE POWERS THAT BE
