[Bonus Track]Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Every time you trample across my peaceful mind flailing freely, want me to let it slide
How you hurt her, went so far beyond the wrong I'll burn you down to cinders, ashes now you're gone
And the scars you left behind slowly fade away with time
Ashes of what used to be now they tore you on to me

Begging mercy, shifting, playing on both sides cut your own throat open and ask me how you died
What was once respect has slowly headed south memory forces echoes better in my mouth
And the scars you left behind slowly fade away with time
Ashes of what used to be now they tore you on to me

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust

Well, I have no respect left for what you're about and sympathy won't come from me
Erase everything that you once could have been destruction of your dignity
I scatter your ashes into the wind regret is too short, now you're free
Leave here in shame doomed to fulfil your pathetic destiny
And the scars you left behind slowly fade away with time
Ashes of what used to be now they tore you on to me

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's history
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's history
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
