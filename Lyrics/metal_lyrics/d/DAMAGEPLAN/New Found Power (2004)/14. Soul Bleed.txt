NOW THAT I'M ALL ALONE
PAINFULLY AWARE 
I'M STARTING TO FEEL THE COLD
KNOWING YOU'RE NOT THERE

CAUGHT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MY FEARS AND 
DREAMS
AND ALL I HAVE ARE DEMONS HERE FOR COMPANY

COME AND LOOK INSIDE, HOPE YOU LIKE WHAT
YOU SEE
AND IF YOU RUN AND HIDE, YOU'RE SCARED OF 
WHAT IS ME
BIND MY IDLE HANDS, THEY ONLY CLAW AT ME
DROWN IN EMPTINESS, MY SOUL IS LEFT TO
BLEED

THROWING A SHADOW ON
EVERY THOUGHT I HAVE
KNOWING THAT SOMETHING'S GONE
ECHO'S IN MY HEAD

CAUGHT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MY FEARS AND 
DREAMS
AND ALL I HAVE ARE DEMONS HERE FOR COMPANY

COME AND LOOK INSIDE, HOPE YOU LIKE WHAT
YOU SEE
AND IF YOU RUN AND HIDE, YOU'RE SCARED OF 
WHAT IS ME
BIND MY IDLE HANDS, THEY ONLY CLAW AT ME
DROWN IN EMPTINESS, MY SOUL IS LEFT TO
BLEED
