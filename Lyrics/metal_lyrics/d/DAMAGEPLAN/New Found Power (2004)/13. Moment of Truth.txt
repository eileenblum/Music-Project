THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I QUESTIONED MY REASONS
THOUGHT I WOULDN'T LAST
SEEMED THE HAND OF GOD HELD MY HEAD
UNDERWATER
SOMEHOW I FOUGHT BACK

IT'S STILL NOT OVER YET
NO, IT WONT LET ME QUIT

FOUND MYSELF MORE THEN JUST ONCE
PRAYING DOWN ON MY KNEES 
MY SEARCH FOR ANSWERS ONLY LED TO MORE
QUESTIONS
SOMETIMES FOR FAITH YOU'VE GOT TO BLEED

BY NOW I'VE BLED MY SHARE
NOW IT'S MY TURN TO REDEEM

WHEN IT COMES MY WAY, I WON'T BE SCARED
I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL MY LIFE
PAIN HAS PREPARED ME FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
AND THE TRUE TEST OF TIME

GIVE ALL YOU HAVE BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE
SELL YOUR MORTAL SOUL
AND IF YOU'RE NOT A PREDATOR THEN, OH - YOU BETTER
PRAY
BET IT ALL NOW OR FOLD

BUT THERE'S STILL A DANGER THERE
DON'T BECOME ONE OF THEM

WHEN IT COMES MY WAY, I WON'T BE SCARED
I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL MY LIFE
PAIN HAS PREPARED ME FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
AND THE TRUE TEST OF TIME

FOR ALL I'VE DONE - SOME GOOD SOME BAD
DON'T HANG ME JUST YET
JUDGE ME NOT ON ONE THING I'VE DONE
SEE MY WHOLE LIFE INSTEAD

WHEN IT COMES MY WAY, I WON'T BE SCARED
I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL MY LIFE
PAIN HAS PREPARED ME FOR THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
AND THE TRUE TEST OF TIME
