I'M SICKENED
I KNOW I'VE BEEN BETRAYED
BUT I KEEP IGNORING 
THE WARNING SIGNS

YOU TELL ME
THAT I'M NOT BENEATH YOU
BUT YOU ACT ABOVE ME
KNIVES IN MY SPINE

NOW WITH ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD
YOU CAN'T BUY MY RESPECT
YEAH, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PRIDE
BUT THAT'S ALL I'VE GOT LEFT

I REACH UP
FOR YOUR HAND AS YOU STAND
LOOKING DOWN ON ME BUT
YOU TURN YOUR BACK

I BELIEVED YOU
NOW EVERYTHING THAT WE HAD
THAT I THOUGHT WAS SACRED
HAS TURNED TO BLACK

NOW WITH ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD
YOU CAN'T BUY RESPECT
YEAH, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF PRIDE
BUT THATS ALL I'VE GOT LEFT
