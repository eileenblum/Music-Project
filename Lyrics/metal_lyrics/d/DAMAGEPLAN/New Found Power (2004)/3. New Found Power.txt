WHY HAVE WE WAITED SO LONG
SUPPRESSING THE POWER INSIDE
TEAR AWAY ALL THAT WAS WRONG
SOMETHING TOO MASSIVE TO HIDE

IT'S TIME TO RIP THE CHAIN FROM YOUR NECK
LET GO THE PAST AS YOU PURGE
FREE NOW FROM EVERYTHING WEIGHING YOU DOWN
OPEN THE FLOODGATES AND SURGE

NEW FOUND POWER

CLEANSING YOURSELF OF THE PAST 
LEARN FROM MISTAKES AND MOVE ON
CONQUERING NEW GROUND AT LAST
UNITE AND BECOME TWICE AS STRONG

IT'S TIME TO RIP THE CHAIN FROM YOUR NECK
LET GO THE PAST AS YOU PURGE
FREE NOW FROM EVERYTHING WEIGHING YOU DOWN
OPEN THE FLOODGATES AND SURGE

NEW FOUND POWER

NOTHING VENTURED, NOTHING GAINED
HOPE WAS ALL THAT KEPT ME SANE
RISE ABOVE AND PROVE MYSELF
I'LL SURVIVE WITHOUT YOUR HELP
SHUT YOU OUT, MY STRENGTH COMES FROM WITHIN
