OUR LIVES ARE ENTWINED, CAN'T ESCAPE
BUT YOU AND I HAVE NEVER MET FACE TO FACE
STILL I CAN'T GET AWAY 
THINK THAT YOU CAN JUST STEP RIGHT IN
PUSH ME OUT AND THEN FUCK THINGS ALL UP AGAIN
IT NEVER SEEMS TO END

DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE BETTER THEN ME
YOU BETTER WAKE UP 'CAUSE YOU KNOW ITS A LIE
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE BETTER THEN ME
YOU BETTER WAKE UP

CLING TO SKELETONS, FEARING CHANGE
PARALYZED THINKING WHAT THE FUTURE WILL BRING
PURE ADRENALINE, I TEAR IN
HATRED IS MY FUEL
TRUTH DIESSECTS YOU AGAIN
AND YOU'VE RUN OUT OF FRIENDS

DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE BETTER THEN ME
YOU BETTER WAKE UP 'CAUSE YOU KNOW ITS A LIE
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE BETTER THEN ME
YOU BETTER WAKE UP

AND NOW ITS TIME, THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS
EXTRACTING THE TRUTH, WHAT WAS FROM WHAT IS
AND ONCE AND FOR ALL WE LAY IT TO REST
AND NEVER LOOK BACK AGAIN

I CAN'T BELIVE ALL THE THINGS DONE TO ME
SIGHT UNSEEN 
YOU DON'T KNOW ONE FUCKING THING BUT YOU
JUDGE ME

DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE BETTER THEN ME
YOU BETTER WAKE UP 'CAUSE YOU KNOW ITS A LIE
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE BETTER THEN ME
YOU BETTER WAKE UP
