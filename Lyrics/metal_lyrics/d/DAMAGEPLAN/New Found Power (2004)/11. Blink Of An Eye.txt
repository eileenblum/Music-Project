SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY THE DREAM
BECAME SO CLEAR
ALL WAS POSSIBLE AND GOD IT FELT SO NEAR
SO I SUFFERED AND I BLED, I TRULY DID BELIVE 
YEARS HAVE COME AND GONE, BUT JUST WHERE 
HAS IT BROUGHT ME

IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
SEEMS LIKE MINUTES AS THE YEARS FLY BY
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
AFRAID TO STOP BECAUSE I CAN'T STOP TIME

STROBING SNAPSHOTS OF MY PAST BECOME A 
BLURRING FLASH
JUST ONE THING CAN MAKE IT ALL COME FLOODING
BACK

IF I'D STOPPED JUST ONCE TO LOOK BACK MAYBE I
WOULD SEE
JUST HOW FAR I'VE COME, BUT IT TOOK IT'S TOLL
ON ME

IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
SEEMS LIKE MINUTES AS THE YEARS FLY BY
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
AFRAID TO STOP BECAUSE I CAN'T STOP TIME

BLINK OF AN EYE

THAT'S JUST HOW FAST YOUR LIFE CAN CHANGE
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, EVERYTHINGS ERASED

IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
SEEMS LIKE MINUTES AS THE YEARS FLY BY
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE
DON'T EVER STOP BECAUSE YOU CAN'T STOP TIME
