IDENTITY MURDERED, MALICIOUS INTENT
I'M RECREATING MYSELF AT LAST
RISE UP FROM DESTRUCTION, START OVER AGAIN
REBORN, I'M NOW ERASING THE PAST

DID YOU THINK FOR A SECOND I 
WOULDN'T BOTHER TO QUESTION WHY
YOU ALWAYS PUT ME LAST
CAN YOU LOOK STRAIGHT INTO MY EYES
AS YOU'RE EXCRETING ALL YOUR LIES
YOUR TIME IS COMING FAST

I'M REBORN
I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT

EVERYTHING NOW THAT WOULD STAND IN MY
WAY 
IS DOOMED TO TAKE THE IMPACT TO COME
YOU THINK YOU CAN STOP ME, YOU'D BEST THINK
AGAIN
YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME? COME GET SOME

DID YOU THINK FOR A SECOND I 
WOULDN'T BOTHER TO QUESTION WHY
YOU ALWAYS PUT ME LAST
CAN YOU LOOK STRAIGHT INTO MY EYES
AS YOU'RE EXCRETING ALL YOUR LIES
YOUR TIME IS COMING FAST

I'M REBORN
I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT

SO EVERYTHING YOU'RE THROWING AT ME
HAS ONLY HELPED ME MAKE UP MY MIND
AND ALL YOU DO WILL AMOUNT TO NOTHING
YOU CAN'T EFFECT ME, DONT EVEN TRY
