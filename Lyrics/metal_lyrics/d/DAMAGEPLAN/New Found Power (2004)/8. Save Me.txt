SAVE ME FROM MYSELF I CALL OUT
BUT NO ONE HEARS MY PLEA
BURN MY CANDLE FAST FROM BOTH ENDS
NIGHTMARES GROW FROM DREAMS

YOU DON'T KNOW YOU CANT SEE THROUGH MY EYES
SO YOU DON'T KNOW ME
YOU DON'T KNOW WHATS GOING THROUGH MY MIND
BUT CAN YOU HELP ME

SAVE ME FROM MYSELF IF YOU EVER REALLY CARED
SAVE ME FROM MYSELF, TELL ME YOU'RE NOT SCARED

INTENSITY THAT GROWS WITHIN ME
REFLECTIONS OF MY PAIN
I'LL CREATE OR I'LL DESTROY
BUT EITHER WAY IT'S ALWAYS IN MY VEINS

YOU DON'T KNOW YOU CANT SEE THROUGH MY EYES
SO YOU DON'T KNOW ME
YOU DON'T KNOW WHATS GOING THROUGH MY MIND
BUT CAN YOU HELP ME

SAVE ME FROM MYSELF IF YOU EVER REALLY CARED
SAVE ME FROM MYSELF, TELL ME YOU'RE NOT SCARED

SAVE ME....FROM ME.....
