I FEEL YOU STARE
WATCH ME NOT CARE
GLARE AT THE FREAK
YOU'VE NO CONTROL
FEEL YOUR EYES PROBING ME, JUDGEING ME
ONLY MAKES ME WANT TO EXPLODE, JUST EXPLODE

YOU DONT KNOW ME
BUT YOU FEAR ME
TAINTED WITH INK
RIDDLED WITH HOLES
STARING AND POINTING, STUPIDITY
ONLY MAKES ME WANT TO EXPLODE, JUST EXPLODE

STEREOTYPE ME
CATEGORIZE ME
BEHIND MY BACK, BUT I CAN SEE
THE UNCOMFORTABLE SMILE
ONLY HIDES FOR AWHILE
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY FEELING BENEATH

ALL THAT YOU SEE
SCARS THAT MADE ME
SEE IN YOUR EYES
ALL YOU DESPISE
JUDGE ME BY WHAT YOU SEE, LEAVE ME BE
GET AWAY I'M GOING TO EXPLODE, JUST EXPLODE

FEAR WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
IT WILL ALWAYS BE 
FEAR WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

AS IT ALWAYS WAS
FEAR WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
IT WILL ALWAYS BE
FEAR WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
I JUST WANT TO EXPLODE
