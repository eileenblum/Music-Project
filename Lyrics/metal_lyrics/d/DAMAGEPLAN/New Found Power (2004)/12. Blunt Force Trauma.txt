I NEVER SAW WHATEVER IT WAS
THAT CAME AND HIT ME FROM BEHIND
THEN I AWOKE ENRAGED AND CONFUSED
HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO BLIND

LIFE'S ESCAPING, DON'T PRETEND
JUDGEMENT COMES, BUT WHO KNOWS WHEN

SO WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT
THAT'S WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
A TRAGIC TWIST TO ALTER FATE
INSTINCT IS TO DENY
LOGIC DOES NOT APPLY
IN TIME WE LEARN, BUT IT'S TO LATE

BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD

BLAZING THROUGH LIFE AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
DON'T STOP TO LOOK AT THE SIGNS
SUDDENLY EVERYTHING CRASHES AROUND YOU
WHEN WE FORGET, LIFE REMINDS

CLOCK IS RUNNING, FALLING SAND
TIME IS SLIPPING THROUGH YOUR HANDS

SO WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT
THAT'S WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
A TRAGIC TWIST TO ALTER FATE
INSTINCT IS TO DENY
LOGIC DOES NOT APPLY
IN TIME WE LEARN, BUT IT'S TO LATE

BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD
IT'S TOO LATE

BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA

SO WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT
THAT'S WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT
A TRAGIC TWIST TO ALTER FATE
INSTINCT IS TO DENY
LOGIC DOES NOT APPLY
IN TIME WE LEARN, BUT IT'S TO LATE

BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD
