Horns in the distance, resound through the air
The trebuchet's shape standst tall
Attack is imminent, but I have no fear
I won't be dethroned
As in 1282, when flames reached the sky,
I am ready again to swing my axe
And sound the horn to charge the besiegers
The hunters are hunted again
I am born a king and will die a king
The blade of my axe is my witness
The deceivers' blood paved my way to the throne
Now I am here to stay!
God's fire of hate and destruction is here to kill, But I shall triumph once again by the steel of my axe!
I sharpened my blade for all these years
Waiting to take my revenge
The heads of those who tried to dethrone me
Will taste the cold steel, and then roll
I took my path, my decisions are made
I now cheer with blood in my horn
I reign my kingdom, your only choice to obey
Speak to my axe then to me
I am born a king and will die a king
The blade of my axe is my witness
Deceivers' blood paves my way to the throne
I am here to stay!
God's fire of hate and destruction is here to ki
I shall triumph once again by the steel of my axe!
I hail this land, my kingdom again
No mercy for the deceivers
Axe at my side, my reign is of steel
As of steel is my pride
