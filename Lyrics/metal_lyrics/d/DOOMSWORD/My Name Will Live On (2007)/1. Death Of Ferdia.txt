On this bloodstained land
I will make my stand
And my honour will defend

Ferdia oh, my friend
This will be the end
When this spear will leave my hand

Fight with me!
Choose your weapon today!
Let it be all or any, today you're both brother and prey

Draw your sword!
Cast your spear to me!
Ferdia! Come face your brother
Come face the Hound of Cullan!

I care not whether I die
tomorrow or next year
If my deeds live after me

My soul dies here with you
Brother, see you
In Tir nan nOg
My spear pierces your heart, and strikes mine twice as hard
Today, there will be no victory

Yet again, my brother
My hands are covered in your blood
This time not heal your wounds

Fate wanted us to live as brothers
And die as foes
Woe onto ?ireann, for the greatest of warriors has fallen
