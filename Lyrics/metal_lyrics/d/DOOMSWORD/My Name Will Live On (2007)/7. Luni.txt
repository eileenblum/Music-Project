Head toward the island
On its shores we saw a cross
Priests of the new white god
Who want to replace our pagan faith
Approach to a silent land,
On which holy chants resound
Give them a dreadful lesson
The Raven flies over the Dove
May I die in Odin's name, the monks shall be tortured and slain
This is now land of the greatest of all
May I kill in Odin's name
No crosses and churches shall stand against our sky
Guide me Odin,
Guide me, I'll leave this land burning for you
Guide the faithful to the end.
Lay me on a board,
Bring me to the priest
Let me enter the temple
Of the White Lord of the Heavens
Let me avenge my faters
By holding this priest's head
Go forth now my warriors
And burn this town to the ground
May I die in Odin's name, the monks shall be tortured and slain
This is now land of the greatest of all
May I kill in Odin's name
No crosses and churches shall stand against our sky
Guide me Odin,
Guide me, I'll leave this land burning for you
Guide the faithful to the end
