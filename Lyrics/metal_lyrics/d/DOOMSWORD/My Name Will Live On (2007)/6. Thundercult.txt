Upon this twisted land
And consecrated by the Gods' touch
I shall create the cult of myself
Where the sky and earth and divine fire
are one
I shall create my Thundercult

May the sensation of the Thunder
Descend onto me
I am thunder, I am divine
I am the Thundercult

May the thunder be in my hand
In my chest and my voice
May I be a living Thundercult

May the sensation of the thunder
Descend onto me
I am thunder, I am divine
I am the thundercult
This way the sentence from above
Shall manifest itself
Thus the cult was consecrated
The Throne of Thunder is mine
