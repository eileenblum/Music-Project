7 times a hundred roman souls
46 centurions slain on Gergovia's hill
700 skulls to celebrate the gods
As they bless the name of Vercingetorix

The eagle spreading his wings
Has darkened our sun
Our forage destroyed
Our crop is watered in blood
Legions invincible march of Gaul
One by one tribes are paying the toll
I heard of a hero who would stop all of this
And reign over Gaul as a king
I heard of a man who will triumph over Rome
Vercingetorix

Caesar entrenched camp outside their fort
And captured a high hill from where he laid siege
Centurions advanced
To ensure the Gauls have surrendered
Legions invincible launch the attack
One by one tribes pay the toll
Oblivious of what's hidden within the walls
Gergovia the glorious had a new king
Hailing their leader the Gauls shouted loud: Vercingetorix

Caesar roared as the legions charged
Ordering to retreat - recedite!!
Blinded by blood thirst his army attacked
and ignored his command
Crying for victory marching to death
Hailing "Caesar, Caesar!" to their last breath
