Through the tales
The legend lived
A Sword of Salvation
At the side of
The greatest kings
Brought Hope and Destruction
A light that shone
Of ancient strength,
Arose from the Earth
From green misty hills
To swing in frostbitten lands
Forged by the Gods
The Sword that was made for Man
Caladvwlch, bring us all to Victory!
Blade of Doom, ruler of Man's Destiny!
I chant your countless names:
Sword of Light, Sword of Doom
Caladcholg
The rainbow beam
Connacht's Defender
Caliburn
Cymric Heir
Of the best of ?ireann
A golden hilt
For a silver hand
Who ruled the first reign
Crusher of Evil
Its power will one day return
When the white lord is vanquished
The fire of our faith will burn
Caladvwlch, bring us all to victory!
Blae of Doom, ruler of Man's Destiny!
I chant your countless names:
Sword of Light, Sword of Doom
