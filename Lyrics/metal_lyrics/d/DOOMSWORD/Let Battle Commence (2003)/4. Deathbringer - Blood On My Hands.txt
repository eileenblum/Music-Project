Woman i never saw
It was hard to me
To march upon these snowcovered plains.
Woman i never saw
It was difficult to me
To wait before the fire the battle to come.
Woman i never saw
You don't know what i felt
When i froze my skin under this mail coat.
Woman i never saw
I was frightened yesterday
They were few in number, but the look in their eyes...

Of this land
Of glory battle and death
All i recall, is the look in the eyes of the dead.

Blood on my hands!

Woman i never saw
No ship will return,
None will ever warm your winter nights.
Woman i never saw
I am sorry if you can believe me,
I killed your man in my last fight.
