Seems to me a great vast black ocean
Yet it ignores the wind
Once you can see it than describe it to your lord.

A huge mass of shining polearms
The sound of battle horns, prepares the storm
Death is coming dresssed as a pagan horde.

Above this walls i admire my end,
This viking horde is beauty and death.
My lord forgive me for all my sins,
Please let me sing of our future heathen reign...

Woden's Reign.
