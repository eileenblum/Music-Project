The long northern winter has come
We march through the snow that reminds us our home
The three Lodbrok brothers command us
Ubbe, Halvdane and Ivarr the Boneless.

Sitting here by the fire
I look to the army that frightens the world
Loud norsemen laughters resound through the air
We don't fear the death for our life was decided by Fate.

The vikings have come
Here's the pagan horde
Aim to the walls!

Prepare the siege machines
Aim to the walls,
The assault has begun,
Attack!

Tear down the wall!

Come to me, Sons of the North
This quest will be always recalled
As the terror that came from the North!
