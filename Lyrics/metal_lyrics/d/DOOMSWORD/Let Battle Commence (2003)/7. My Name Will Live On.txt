Here in the battlefield, laying still on the ground
I just remember my native land.
I left on a spring sunny day
To lead my ship toward the west
Until we reached a green island
Vast and desert it seemed to be.

A White God house we saw so far
We attack the abbey without fear
Our flames grew higher to the sky
A tribute to the One Eyed God.

On a cloudy autumn day
A great army came to the camp
They brought the sign of the cross
Steel meets steel, the Cross against the Hammer.
My sons shall tell of this day
On which their father died
A glorious breed has been their one
Through their words my name will live on.

Father and Son, the glory will live on...
