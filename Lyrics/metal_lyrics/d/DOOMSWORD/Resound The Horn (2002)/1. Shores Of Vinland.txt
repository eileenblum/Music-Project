We were sailing towards
The unknown in the open sea
After the storm, our hope was lost
In the raging waves but
My old faith was never so strong,
My viking heart don't fear the fate!
Under Leif's christian command
Full of wild grapes was the land
To which we approached
And tried to live but no more
Hydromel was in our horns
Our viking hearts don't fear the fate!
Twice a winter, we messed our beloved.
Praying the lord,
Leif sought a blessing for our souls
Under his sign we abandoned our folks,
Now we are ready to unfurl the sails
Naglfar the ship will not have our nails,
Our viking hearts don't fear the fate!
Twice a winter we missed our beloved,
To these shores our hearts do not belong!
Our ship devours the ocean waste
The sea is the nature on which we where born
Approaching our bay resound the viking horn
The hammer triumphant,
The cross now is torn,
My viking heart still has faith!
Twice a winter, we missed our beloved
Who did enlight the way to return?
Mighty Thor bring me back home.
