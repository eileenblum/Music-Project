We chose our destiny
Fianna is the name
For which we shall live
To which our souls we give
Once again to the battle we march
Blow after blow
Swords spreading death
Witness your glory or
Your mates' last breath.
March! March!
We answer the call of the king,
From far you can hear
The army that sings
"Victory we bring!"
Lamp fires await for the dawn,
Coward would me the attack
Glory awaits when the sun
Shines bright.
March! March!
On the march
On the march again
On the march,
On the march!
