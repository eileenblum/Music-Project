He walks among strangers' eyes
Hearse of his unknown presence,
The world is still confused
And the balance was changed
By the DoomSword
The dark shape will rise,
A demon at side
The DoomSword will fall
On the world
The bell of fate sounds its toll,
The DoomSword.
For the whole world will fear
The sign and the name of the lord
Who bears the DoomSword!
Resign to the blade
Which in hell was made
Your soul is safe no more
It can't be your choice:
"Bow to the sword!"
Listen to the doom
And knell to the sword,
The blade rose tall it's now ruler,
Ruler of all for the whole world will fear
The sign and the name of the lord
Who bears the DoomSword.
For I am your god and you must obey,
I am the king, war I will bring,
Follow me or be my pray,
Be my pray!
