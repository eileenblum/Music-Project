If you look to the east,
On the ways of pilgrimage,
You can still see the trails,
Which they left behind.
Deserted sands on the slopes
Of what once where hills,
Hide a mystic mystery,
The quest for the holy research.
Nine knights for none years
Piercing the ground they all disappeared,
A secret plot disguised as holy quest,
Nine knights did want to disappear.
As above so below of the temple
Was the law, see the stars that shine
Upon dark shapes behind the cross
What was found has now been lost
Arcane knowledge they obtained
What they finally left be
Kind is what chosen few can see.
Nine knights for none years piercing
The ground they all disappeared
A secret plot disguised as holy quest,
Nine knights did want to disappear,
Nine knights, one might!
