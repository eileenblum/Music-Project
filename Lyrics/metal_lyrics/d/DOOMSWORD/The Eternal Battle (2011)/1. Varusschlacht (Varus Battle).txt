Xeru Sword of the Brave
Skos Shield of the Wise and Faithful
The Eye of Wotan casts its glance
Over wooded battlefields

Rin the Everflowing Blood
Guardian of the Sacred Land
Whala Spears shall fall
Donar is guiding us all!

Let the soil of Wotan's land
Soak the blood of Mars' and his legions
By Tiwaz's spear the empire ends here
We drew the line,
The empire ends at the Rhein
In Varus Battle

Armin leader of folks
Bringer of Unity and Faith
Lead us all to Triumph
By Wotan shall Germania remain Free!

Sodden paths our battlefield
Sudden ambush and assault
Roman blood paints the altars
Sacrifice and Victory!

[Solo: Sacred Heart]
