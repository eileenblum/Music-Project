Oh imposing forests
Of trees I've never seen
You make the way to my fate
So hard to walk

Of foreign rain
Stinging my face
How unwelcome I feel
Sinking in merciless mud
As if you knew
Of forests and rain
That we do not own this land
We do not own this land

Of foreign land
I came here to die
Or claim you as mine.

Of foreign seas
With skyward waves
Hail, wind and storm
My life
Is marching to my own death.

As if you knew,
Oh sky, earth and seas
That we do not own this land...
I came here to die
Or claim you as mine!
