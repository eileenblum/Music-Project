Blood, scars and wounds
I shape my own fate
False truth forgers
My life is my deeds
Wrath of the Gods
Or Envy of Man
Evil and Treachery
Shall never defeat me

Before the Gods
I swear to never
Give up the fight
Wrath of the Gods!

Fire of Anger
Of Trust betrayed
Spirit of Ice
Stillness of Soul
Wrath-Tempered Heart
Trial by Solitude
The Strong did survive
The Blade is unsheathed

Scarred and wounded
I rise once again
I am undefeatable, Unbreakable
Ostracised, exiled
Yet unvanquished
I am impassible
Indomitable
