...On a Chariot of Fire he left,
With a Crown of Flames he returns,
His Armour in Black, Blood and Gold,
A Hellish, Earthly Celestial god.

He was The Fulminant
Lightning in his Fingers
The Fulminant, The Furious
Beyond His Eyes Lives the Bolt Domain

All widows and warriors
Screaming by his tongue
The Battle Ecstasy and Tragedies
Two sparks in His 3 Eyes

I am The Fulminant
Lightning in my Fingers
The Fulminant, The Nameless

Beyond my Eyes
The Bolt Domain

[Solo: Deathmaster]

He looked through the River of Death and Time

Survived A Pure Warrior's Code
In the memory of a child
Hidden a trail... Still Untold

All power surrounds Him
For the Day of Reckoning,
Give Him The Sword and Belief
To Clear all the Standing.

For He's The Fulminant,
Shapeless Animal of the Dawn
The Fulminant,
Merciful face of Death
His is the Eye of the Scorcher!

[Solo: Deathmaster]
