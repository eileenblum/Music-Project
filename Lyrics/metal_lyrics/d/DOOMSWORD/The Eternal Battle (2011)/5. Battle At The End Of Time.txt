For all the lives
Taken by the sword
And the blood washed from its blade
For all the allies
Who fell side by side
Their pyres with sky reaching flames

With spear sword sand shield,
Armour of Steel
We're Liege soldiers at Fate's command

Man monsters and myth
Meet their end
The twilight of idols descends

This is the final day,
Hear the final battle horn
No victorious chants,
This battle shall inspire no rhyme,
The Battle at the end of Time.

For all the times
We defended or Name
For a future that is never to come

And the steps
On a path which appears as we march
And vanishes behind our backs.
