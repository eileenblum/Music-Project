I never thought
The legends were true
Now the golden hall open its gates
To its dying son

As one battle fades
Another one soars
I take my place, At Odin's side

Blood runs fresh and fast
Through my veins
I am now ready to fight
Forevermore

I can see the battle in the sky
Eternal battle way up high

Clad in a white wolf skin
Newly tempered blade at hand
My forefathers welcome their son
All father, here I am.

Should I be granted a wish
One last warrior's prayer
Then let my blade never null
And let me fight... for eternity...
