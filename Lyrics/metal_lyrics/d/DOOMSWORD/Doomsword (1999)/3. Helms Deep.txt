Goblinoid forces attack the fortress
aiming the tower with their evil missiles
Isengard banners and signs now shine
night is growing old on Helm's deep

Guthwine the blade of the mighty Eomer
Anduril the blade once broken now strong
King Theoden awaits for a last ride on his horse
Imminent dawn carries hope on Helm's deep
Will the horn resound?
Hear tremendous drums pound!

[Chorus:]
The battle at Helm's deep

Uruk-hai orks don't know their fate
Gandalf now returns on his gray horse
White rider brings with him the hope
The battle is raging in Helm's deep

Erkenbrand is coming with his red shield
Isengard's army now trembles in fear
From hills resound the horns of doom
A wood never seen
On the tresholds of Helm's deep

Resound the horn!
