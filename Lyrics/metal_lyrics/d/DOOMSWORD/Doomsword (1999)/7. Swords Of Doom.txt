We're the ones
we're the ones
the chosen to wield the swords of doom
we've got to fight to free from the curse
that made us the bringers
of scorn and war

[Bridge:]
"In countless battles I'll have to fight
'till my sacred blade will shine bright
this holy sword will guide my heart
and only death can do us apart"

"Fight, my warrior,fight
Show the gods your might"

[Chorus:]
Swords of Doom
