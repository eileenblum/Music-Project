Yrkoon the traitor sits on the throne
Elric is back now
to show how much his hate has grown
His thirst for vegeance
now brings no name his cousin must ruin
covered by shame

[Bridge:]
Elric the White Wolf and his black sword
this diabolic couple has no rivals on th world
Stormbringer is called his infernal blade
powers unknown in hellish flames made

Dragon with the black sword!Elric!

His powerful ships to Imrryr now sail
(with) the lords of the sea
he's sure he will prevail
From his voyage returns
the bearer of the Sword
protected by Arioch and his infernal horde

"Cymoril beloved, I'll set you free
Yrkoon must die no dawns he will see"
The dragon's empire a 10000 years reign
Collapses like the towers stones fall like rain!
