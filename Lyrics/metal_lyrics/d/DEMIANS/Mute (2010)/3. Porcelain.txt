Show me what
I have been missing
All this time
Echoes were right
Only thinking about yourself
Pixilate
Show me the way

Through the blue

Throwing stones
In your house of glass
Roll the dice
Echoes were right
Only thinking about yourself
Pixilate
Show me the way

Say what you're really
Looking for
And everything you ever
Wanted
When what you're really looking for
Breaks before your
Very eyes

Say you're really looking for
Everything you ever
Wanted
What you're really looking for
Breaks before your
Very eyes

Keep your eyes wide open
