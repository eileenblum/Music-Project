Secrets buried safe and sound
Tell me stories of thrones and crowns
You said all of this would be mine

Shimmering in silver dots
I hear a siren calling my name
She says choice is always yours

It doesn't matter much to you or to me
Whether we die on the land or on the sea
The sun will shine, a thousand rains will fall
But your generous grave will hide us all
Rip me open to see in front of me
Immerse me and all I know
What is untold is worth all the gold in the world

Sink with your hopes, burn with the city
I will follow the trail of this banshee calling me
This time, choice is only mine

It doesn't matter much to you or to me
Whether we die on the land or on the sea
The sun will shine, a thousand rains will fall
In your generous grave we'll unfold

I'll stay in here with you
Hold my hand, I won't let you
Drown in their plea for silence
But I know, what is untold
Is worth all the gold in the world
