When you throw me the stone
Listen for the ripples
The curls you will carelessly spawn
For they will cover your moans with the solemn low
Irresistible laugh of the undertow

Your world turned upside down
I swear I could feel you
I swear I could feel you from afar
Tearing your insides out
Never thought I would see you
Thought I would see you cry

Bask in your scorn
Feel the punch on your jaw
You're a coveted feast of self-pity and woe
With each stride you melt into the foam and the drift
I'm the black ride prowling under your feet

Your world turned upside down
I swear I could feel you
I swear I could feel you from afar
Tearing your insides out
Never thought I would see you
Thought I would see you crying out loud

Carry the fire inside you
The colors we unearthed are slowly turning blue
