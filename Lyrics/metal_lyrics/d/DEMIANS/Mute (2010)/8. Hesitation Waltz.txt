Dry lips, nothing can satisfy this bitter taste of denial
Of breathing a life that isn't yours
But where the souvenir tastes fine

Swallow a pride you call your own
And fight the thought that beauty knows
That your shell is hollow and the rest should follow
Just stay away from the noise

Stay away from the noise

Avoiding the light that burns your eyes
Playing this comedy you despise
Untouched, but covered with your lies
Safe in a drawer where the souvenir tastes fine
Swallow your pride, you can call it your own
If you stay away from the fire

Stay away from the fire

Please tell me something that I don't already know
To the sound of the violin, the sliding bow on an open wound

Please tell me something that I don't already know
I'll tell you a story nobody ever wished telling you

Please tell me something that I don't already know
I could wish you peace or love or whatever's pleasing you

If there is something that you should already know
We're caught in the whirl and all we have left is
Noise
