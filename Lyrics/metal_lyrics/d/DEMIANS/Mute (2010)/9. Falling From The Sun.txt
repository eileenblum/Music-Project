I stare at the rain
Tiny drops rolling on and down the windowpane
And as cliche as it sounds
I cannot help thinking about the way it had to end

When all is said and done
Falling from the sun

Appease me somehow
Hollow wraith shading, only memories remain
Every cliche has its day
I cannot help thinking about the brighter things lying ahead

And all is said and done
Falling from the sun

But I was falling for the sun in you
For giving me a whisper
Falling from the sun
Irradiate me in a whisper

Falling for the sunrise glowing on your face
In one last glance
For one caress
In one last breath

But now please turn off the light
Would you
