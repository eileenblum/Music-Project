Spare me your affliction
And abandon your own
Beliefs and believers taking control of
The way they all watch your sun enlighten their lives
Just blame it on the situation

Stand where I am and remember your aim
No apology
Read in me from the mud on your lands
Save one last breath, should you choke to your death
Cold is cutting through
Reading you from the blood in the palm of your hands

Quick to judge me yet so slow to understand
Slit your grudge and anger on what lingers on

Craving for attention
In your delusion
Your beliefs and believers taking control of
The way they all watch your sun enlighten their lives
Through mystics and messiahs
Art of persuasion, blame it on the situation
On the wolf in the sheepfold deciding who should live or die

Stand where I am and remember your aim
No apology
Read in me from the mud on your lands
Save one last breath, should you choke to your death
Cold is cutting through
Reading you from the blood in the palm of your hands

Quick to judge me, yet so slow to understand
Slit your grudge and anger on what lingers on
