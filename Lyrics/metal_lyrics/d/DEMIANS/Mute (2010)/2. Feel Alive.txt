I won't ask you why you're not smiling
Ask no question hear no lies
And your familiar tedious storyline is splitting our sides
But maybe it's time for you to find new colors
To radiate your own splendor
As the ugly girl who blames the mirror

Let me draw the lines of this world falling down
While you cry and you soar on your glorious road
We fought your lies, your chloroform
So long, let the wolves come
I'm already gone

Shine on little soldier
With your revolution smoldered in
Your familiar tedious storyline, wasting our time
But we're all gone now and remember
We'll be the flowers blooming on your gravestone

Unleash the wolves
Let them come

If you really want to look beyond this wall
Wait here for the punchline
All the lines are drawn
Unleash the wolves
Come
I'll keep holding on
But I don't want to die
Before I figure out some way to feel alive

Unleash the wolves
