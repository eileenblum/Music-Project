They strive to be gracious
You find a good reason for salting your wounds
I'm none of the above
So busy you are passing off ignorance as wisdom
See me on your way down
Wake me when you kiss the ground
Falling from your cloud

Let's try to be truthful
I found a good reason for salting your wounds
Coming from above
Save me on your way down
Wake me when you kiss the ground
I'm waiting for the rain to take me away

Now I know one day will come
We'll walk as one under the same sun
Raise your head up, forget the jury
Become the rain and come dance with me

Now stop and look around
When nothing's a given we laugh at your cries
Above and beyond

An invitation to leave me alone
As time passes by get back on your cloud
See me on your way down
Embrace me and we'll kiss the ground
Wait here, wish for the rain to take you away
Rain, please take me away

Been here, done that, and after all
We all bow down before the same sun
Raise your head up, forget the jury
Become the rain and come dance with me
