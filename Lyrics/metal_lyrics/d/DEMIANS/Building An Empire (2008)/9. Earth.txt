We are feeding the machine
From this inner cage I made your body
Be now, but don't stare at me now, I'm nearly gone
But go figure it all, was it worth searching far beyond?
Then I will carry on...

Gathering space and time
When I am yours and you are mine
This life will carry us away in the glimpse of an eye
The smile on your face today shows in everything you say
That this life will carry us away
But in this realm, I am eternal

Scratching the surface
From this inner grave I built you a country
My love, this kingdom's not the one we belong to
But don't be ashamed at all, it was worth hiding for so long
Now we are made of stone...

Gathering space and time
When I am yours and you are mine
This life will carry us away in the glimpse of an eye
The smile on your face today shows in everything you say
That this life will carry us away
But in this realm, I am eternal

Wake up, we listened to the waves
We found the world that could wash away your tears at your will

Stand up, we listened to the wind
We found a moment to just slow down and stay still

Now lay down and feel our love growing
Now that our hearts can beat side by side, now we can believe in ourselves
And what lies beneath
Us, the earth, and what lies underneath

Gathering space and time
When I am yours and you are mine
This life will carry us away in the glimpse of an eye
The smile on your face today shows in everything you say
That this life will carry us away
But in this realm, I am eternal

I won't say this every time
I won't let you say it's sad
