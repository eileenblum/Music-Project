I won't laugh now that your precious sun has gone
I won't pray for the rain to come
Words make me feel like a newborn
A new time has come, I will live it on my own

But how did it all come down?

Keep your head up now, your precious sun has grown
You'll have to wait for the rain to come
A blank page's worth a thousand words
When only one song could destroy them all

And why couldn't it be this one?
I wrote it on my own before the dawn

I won't cry now, the insiders are free to leave
And I feel at peace with the flood still waiting
I created these worlds, one by one, word by word
If there was a song that could destroy them all
Why should I sing it now that I feel all alone?

And why couldn't it be this one?
I wrote it on my own before the dawn

I was warned but now that my time has come
Please let me drown just one more time
Before the dawn

I was strong but now my kingdom's come down
I'll wear my crown just one more time
Before the dawn

How did it all come down? why am I the only one?
Leave the dark and see the light
There is no need to look back
Leave the dark, life seems so bright
We'll free yourself from your thoughts
Now that it's time to grow up
Don't tell me so when no one's around
Leave the dark, life seems so bright
We won't stab you in the back
But how did it all come down?

I was warned but now that my time has come
Please let me drown just one more time
Before the dawn

I was strong but now my kingdom's come down
I'll wear my crown just one more time
Before the dawn

But how did it all come down?
