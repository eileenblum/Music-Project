this is what i call a new day
i'll miss the worlds before the dawn
fallen or gone, i am your angel
make my wings strong, i'll keep you warm
i was sitting, tired but breathing
hoping the sun would touch my skin

come fly with me, anytime you want
my wings are made of our dreams
come make me feel anything you want
and nobody will show you we're not real

fallen or gone, i saw an angel
reminding me of what we wished to be
i was sitting, tired but breathing
hoping her hand would touch my skin
'this time i won't let them scar your wings', she said
'show them what they wished they'd never see'

come fly with me, anytime you want
my wings are made of our dreams
come make me feel anything you want
and nobody will show we're not
come have shelter anywhere you want
put out the sea and chase your fears
come and ask me anything you want
to thank you for making me feel so ...

this is what i call a new day
this is what i call a new day
my wings are made of our dreams
this is what i call a new day
this is what i call a new day
to thank you for making me feel so real
