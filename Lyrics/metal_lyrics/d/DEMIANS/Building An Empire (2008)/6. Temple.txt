imagine a temple in your dreams
where even all my fears won't make you disappear

imagine these feelings we could share
you'd keep them in your head, even when i'm dead

imagine now, imagine now... but you can't imagine...

remember this ringing in your ears
sounded like my biggest fear and you made it disappear

remember now these feelings that we shared
how they whisper in your ears even when i'm far away

remember now this temple in my dreams
where even all your fears won't make me disappear

remember now these moments that we shared
now they will stay in your head even when i'm dead

remember now, remember now...

i won't say goodbye this time
i won't let you die inside my mind
