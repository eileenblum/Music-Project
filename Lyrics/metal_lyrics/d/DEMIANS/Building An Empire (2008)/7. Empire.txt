saying goodbye is saying 'die'
will you ever remember, awakening or slumber?
i won't ask you to fly so high
but help me to lift that weight i'm feeling deep inside

and this place that's so familiar
will stay our temple forever
we'll see the light brighter than ever

whether you choose to stay
or choose to run away
your life is ours and there is no other way
and if one day i chose to run away
we'll be together when we remember that day

i still feel the sun is trying
but i remember deep within
that i will miss you all when you leave me

and remember now 
these moments that we shared
will never make me forget why i chose to stay

it's an awakening
down on slumber
awakening... it's the dawn of slumber

choose to stay
or if i choose to run away
your life is ours and there is no other way

contemplate now this temple in my dreams
where even all our fears won't make me disappear
remember now these feelings we once shared
keep them in your head
even when we're far away from awakening
down on slumber
awakening, dawn of slumber

i won't say goodbye this time
i won't let you die inside my head
don't tell me goodbye this time
or don't let me die inside my mind...
