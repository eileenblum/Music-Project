feeding the machine
from this inner cage i made my body
my son is staring at a sun that's still to come
but go figure it all
was it worth searching far beyond?

scratching the surface
from this inner grave i built my country
my love, i finally found the one i belong to
but go figure it all
was it worth waiting for so long
to become the stone?

follow me here, i'm on my way back
crimson, we've become the stone and my time may come
to see the man i've become
and follow the child inside until he's grown up
before he goes away

memories and expectations
all is moving in so similar ways
small rooms or huge surroundings
there's no use when you are the missing

i think i'm getting used to the fear of getting used to you
i think we're getting used to the fear of living for two

follow me here i'm on my way back home
you can bury me here or take my hand back stronger
