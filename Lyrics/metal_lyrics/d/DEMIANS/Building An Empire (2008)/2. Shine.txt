wake up
and listen to the waves
is there a word
that could wash away your tears at your will?

stand up
and listen to the wind
is there a moment
you can sit down and stay still?

now lay down
and feel your life leaving
is there a heart that could beat by your side
if you can't believe in yourself?
in you ... and what lies beneath
you ... in truth ... and what lies underneath

there's no need to learn anything
no need to forget anything
you never listened anyway

there's no need to learn any song
take my hand and we'll carry on
remember what you wished to be

now we're going home

there's no need to learn anything
no need to forget anything
remember what you wished to be
and now we're going home
