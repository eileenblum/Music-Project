deaf, numb and run-down
fastened-seatbelt homeward-bound
landing checks and gear down
a ten-hour flight hits the ground
and all that i once knew is gone

eyes open wide,
dawning on wasted mourning hours
an aerial slide
and a led screen counting down the miles
here comes the time i...
swirl on the downside world

gear up to take off
if anything is turning you off
next time, good son
don't look down while you leave the ground
head up, and...
swirl the downside world

now hours pass like centuries
and empty minutes feel like years
the engine rumbling in my ears
won't make the memories disappear

for family and friends, for passengers
a postcard's worth an open letter
we never met, we never will
they're scared and all i need's a thrill

all this is now so far away
and yet it feels like yesterday
when she was drawing lines in the sand
that i was holding in my hand
holding in my hand
hold it in your hand

all this is now so far away
and yet it feels like yesterday
did it have to end that way
when there was so much left to say?
for family, friends, for passengers
the show is over
when we are down
where are we crashing down?...

you know when hours feel like years
this cold and sleepless night aside
an engine's rumbling in my ears
a led screen's counting down the miles
for family, friends, for passengers
the show is over
may it all swirl
down on the outside world

you know when hours feel like years
from the pain and shivers that subside
like this cancer corroding our dreams
these needles emptying down the vials
for family, friends, for passengers
a postcard's worth an open letter
we'll meet again, i'm sure we will
you're scared and all i need's a thrill

you know when hours feel like years
in cold and sleepless nights you shine
in the engine rumbling in my ears
on led screens counting down the miles
for family friends, for passengers
the show is over
may it all swirl
down on the outside world

i'm seeing the earth from a plane
where precious space and time sustain
and you are drawing lines in the sand
i keep holding in my hand
no family, friend, no passenger
the show is over
when we are down
where are we crashing down...?

and i remember hours feel like years
hoping this pain and shivers would subside
like this cancer corroded our dreams
these needles emptied down the vials
no family, friends, nor passengers
the show is over
and now we all swirl
down on the outside world
may it all swirl
down on the outside world
swirl...

i'm seeing the earth from a plane
where precious space and time sustain
we'll meet again, i'm sure we will
you're scared and i just got my thrill
spinning around in my head
every word that you said
and everything we have been
that we were holding in our hands
holding in our hands

deaf, numb and run-down
fastened-seatbelt, homeward-bound
landing checks and gear down
a ten-hour flight hits the ground
and all that i once knew is gone...

all that i once knew is gone
