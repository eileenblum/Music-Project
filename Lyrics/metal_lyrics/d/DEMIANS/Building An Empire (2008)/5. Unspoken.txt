sometimes... so strange... cut up the pain
some thing... arrange... always the same
come into the scene... closer... and please smile again
come for a walk... together... in this wasteland

these comforting words i'd want to hear...
i'm only dreaming

this is the moment i was waiting for
i was burning to welcome you into my world
so tired of crossing you path once more
i thought we'd walk the same way after all

the words are yet to come,
and still i feel like silence is meaning so much more
to tell you what's unspoken but remains inside
i feel so quiet i will rise

sometimes... so strange... cut up the pain
these comforting words i'd want you to say...
i'm only craving

in this dream i never had before
the warmth filling me makes me crave for more
the space between us doesn't matter
within this time we spent together

the words are yet to come
and still i feel like silence is meaning so much more
to tell you what's unspoken but remains inside
i feel so quiet i will rise

tonight... you just... cut up the pain
nothing will ever be the same
i'll leave... the scene... but please smile again
thanks for the walk... together... we'll meet again...
