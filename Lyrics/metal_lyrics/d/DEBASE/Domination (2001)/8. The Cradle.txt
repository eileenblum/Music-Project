I am A, I am O - I am Alfa and Omega to
I'm the beginning, here it starts
I'm the end, here it stops
I created this world
From heaven I've been sent

The hand that rocks the cradle
The hand that feeds you

I am Black I am White I am David and Goliath
I am paradise, I am hell I am life and I'm death
I created this world from heaven I've been sent

The hand that rocks the cradle
The hand that feeds you

I am war and I am peace, I am hate and I am love
I am sex and tabou I am the man inside you
I created this world...
