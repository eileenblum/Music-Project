Silence is broken someone Is calling our name
In the corner of your eye A glimt is all you see
Whatever it is, What the fuck is this It is close now
What we're doing tonight
What we're doing tonight
Echoes in eternity

With full force - We're coming down on you
With full force - We command you

Sorrow is broken you are Chanting our name
The paleriders coming We'll follow
What ever we do Where the fuck we go
You will follow
What we're doing tonight
What we're doing tonight
Echoes in eternity

With full force - We're coming down on you
With full force - We command you
