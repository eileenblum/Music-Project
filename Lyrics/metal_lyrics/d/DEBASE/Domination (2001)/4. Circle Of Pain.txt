All those years I have listened I have learned
after all those Years came the point when it turned
You have the feeling that You're self in control
You try to stand up against it all
So many years of suffer and pain
So many years to learn The old mans game

I'm leaving the circle
The circle of pain I'm leaving the game
The old mans game

Father to son, Master to disaple
But one day we came to the point
When we said that's enough
We want to stand by ourselves
On our own feet, and take all control
So many years...
