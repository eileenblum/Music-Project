Nothing is your's, You've got nothing to say
Your thoughts belong to me Nothing is real
You're living a dream I'll give you what you need
What is true - what is a lie It's not for you to decide
The things you see, the things you hear
The things you feel, it feels so real

Domination - Is My Call
Regulator - Of You All

No more time for mankind I win, You loose, Again
Playing a game - feels so insane
On this board you're detained
Like a brick in the wall, on your knees you shall Crawl
My wish is your command
The things you see, the things you hear
The things you feel, it feels so real

Domination - Is My Call
