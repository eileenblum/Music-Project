Come with me, and you will see
your soul's mine and I'll free your mind
You will fall down, and I'll come around
a black hole, the remainings of your soul
I see you fall, I watch you loose your soul
I'll see you crawl Into the big black hole
Now hear me...

We're off to Gideons again
You'll become the Madmans henchman
There is no heaven no hell
We're off to Gideons again

Your heart's mine, this is your time
You will crawl and I'll free your soul
I see you fall I watch you loose your soul
I'll see you crawl Into a big black hole
Now hear me...
