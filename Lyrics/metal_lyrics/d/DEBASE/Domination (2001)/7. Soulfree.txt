I wake up on a stretch is this real can it be
I saw myself I looked up, saw my life passing by
can't do nothing more
I, I cannot die so tell me why
I had to be here It's not fair to put me here
so tell me why

My soul has left the body
At least I'm free
Condemned to loose my body
I'll never be free

I'm insane, watch the burning flame
I've got burned again. Demons voice in my head
tearing me apart I saw the flame
it burned my brain Felt so much pain
'cause I'm scarred inside, So tell me why
I don't want to die I want to know

My soul has left the body
At least I'm free
Condemned to lose my body
I'll never be free
