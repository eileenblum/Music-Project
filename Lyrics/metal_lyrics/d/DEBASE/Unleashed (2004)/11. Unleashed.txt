It's somewhere in the dark 
It's inside me and you 
go without hate in you 
and keep your heads up high 

Trust your dreams, feel no fear trust your dreams, 
Unleash the great 

See all the good in you 
An open mind for you 
Now the time is yours 
Hate will only bring you down 

Trust your dreams, feel no fear trust your dreams, 
Unleash the great
