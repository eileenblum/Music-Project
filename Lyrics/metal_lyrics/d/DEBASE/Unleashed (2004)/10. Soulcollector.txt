Cain is my name coming here to play a game 
I have the needle lets show your veins 
you can dream away an do what ever you like 
but I know you travel alone to the valley of death 
Cain is my name an everybody hates my game 

You will follow me my friend 
you will stay here til the end 
you will follow me my friend 

Panic you try to hold you down 
but i lift you up little higher 
suddenly you feel the breeze in you morrow 
you will leave your shell I wish you the best and well 
Cain is my name I'm the bringer of pain 

You will follow me my friend 
you will stay here till the end 
you will follow me my friend
