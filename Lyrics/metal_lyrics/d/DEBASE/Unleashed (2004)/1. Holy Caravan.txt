Living in a world of terror, drama
Living in a world of lies and hate 
Justice have no time 
We search for a sign 
Living in a world of false illusions 
Global manipulation in a world on fire 

In the name of the father 
We trust in the gun 
In the name of the father 
See diablo in his eyes 

Living in a world where collision rules 
Living in a dream with no colours 
We are all alive until we die 
We search for the sign
Living in a world of false illusions 
Global manipulation in a world on fire 

In the name of the father 
We trust in the gun 
In the name of the father 
See diablo in his eyes

War hate war hate war 

In the name of the father 
We trust in the gun 
In the name of the father 
See diablo in my eyes 
See diablo in my eyes
