The nightmare has started again 
a black raven sitting on my chest 
he drags me in to the house of hell 
on the bank of the bloody river 

Still hanging some strange fruits in the trees 
blood on the roots again 

Were ever i turn my head 
I see dead bodies everywhere 
I can not scream I can not breath 
I'm bound in my dream 

Still hanging some strange fruits in the trees 
blood on the roots again 

on the bank of the bloody 
river lies the house of hell 
still hanging some strange fruits in the trees 
blood on the roots again
