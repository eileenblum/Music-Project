Hear the sound of my wings I have landed 
Hear the wolfs cry in the night beautiful 
Invite me let me in 
let me kiss you and drink your blood 
Invite me let me in 
let me kiss you the kiss of death 

I promise you you will be my queen my precious 
come to me we will change you life together 
Invite me let me in 
let me kiss you and drink your blood 
Invite me let me in 
let me kiss you the kiss of death 

Blood of my blood flesh of my flesh 
you will be my eternal flame 
blood of my blood 

I've lived my life all alone so empty 
But when I'm with you you fill my veins with life 
Invite me let me in 
let me kiss you and drink your blood 
Invite me let me in And give you life 

Blood of my blood flesh of my flesh 
you will be my eternal flame 
blood of my blood
