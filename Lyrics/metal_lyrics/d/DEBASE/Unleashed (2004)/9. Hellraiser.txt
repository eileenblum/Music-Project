An old friend had visit us again 
an old friend who's always coming back 
we saw your face in dust over Berlin 
we saw your face when in napalm over Nam 

You show no color you show no race 
But you always show your face 

The face of you have been seen 
day of 9 eleven on the screen 
we saw your face in blitz over London 
we saw your face when you melted Japan 

You show no color you show no race 
But you always show your face
