Some people say that I'm strange 
A kind of different 
but I'm not the kind of man they think I am 
I hear voices voices that you don't here 
I need medicine to keep my head clear 

Come out, come out 
I hear voices calling my name 
Come out, come out 
I hear voices calling my name 

Sometime I think they are gone 
but suddenly I here them call 
that fucking commanding song 
that I'm he only one 
I hear voices that you don't hear 
I need a hammer my head is not a tool 

Come out, come out 
I hear voices calling my name 
Come out, come out 
I hear voices calling my name
