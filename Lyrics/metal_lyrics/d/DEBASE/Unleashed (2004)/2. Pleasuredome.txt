Let's leave the primitive life 
and go a new way 
Let us leave the history behind 
and lose all chains 
We have already used the sins 
the seven sins 
Get your acts together 
join the gathering 

To the big new world 
we are marching on 
To the big new world 
and the pleasure dome 

We have seen death up-close 
dance on the table 
He said "join my supper" 
"Let's eat desire" 
Consume wealth and fame, 
And feel my grace 
Get your acts together 
join the gathering 

To the big new world 
we are marching on 
To the big new world 
and the pleasure dome
