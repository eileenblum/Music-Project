Sitting here in my cage 
I'm a prisoner 
no one of us is a slave 
were only digging our own graves 
twenty century gladiator game 
no protection we are human shields 
I'm gonna stay here in my cage 

I'm the King, King of the cage 
I'm still sitting here in my grave 
I'm the King, King of the cage 
I'm still a prisoner 

To be a human and an animal insane 
to be a part of this sick game 
I'm gonna brake your bones in pain 
only one can win this ultimate game 
I'm gonna stay here in my cage 

I'm the King, King of the cage 
I'm still sitting here in my grave 
I'm the King, King of the cage 
I'm still a prisoner
