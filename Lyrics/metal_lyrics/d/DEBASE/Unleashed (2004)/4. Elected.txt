The time is right now for me to take over 
No more lies no more dirty alibi's 
I'm not the hypocrite like the others are
look at me your future star 

Vote for me an I'll be elected 
Vote for me the right man and respected 

We can all be one but we are not the same 
You are all a brick in my game 
You're future destiny in my hands 
Look at me your future star 

Vote for me an I'll be elected 
Vote for me the right man and respected
