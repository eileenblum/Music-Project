100 years forward 100 years back
No one remembers what the place looked like before I remember the crucifix in the holy sand
I remember the dessert land

There was a holy land I still feel the pain...
An evil blitz blind my eyes I was looking up in the sky I remember my birth I remember my childhood I remember when we were young I still feel the pain...
