I'm lying under your dollhouse
I put some poison in your milk
I watch when you fall to sleep
You're crawling around like a deadly creep

Dream girl dream You're so alone
and your mom's not home

You wake up from your nightmare
But here is the darkest night
I don't accept when you're telling lies
Can't you see that in your father's eyes?

Scream girl scream You're so alone
and your mom's not home
You're so alone - and your mom's not home
Run girl run You're so alone -
and your mom's not home
You're so alone - and your mom's not home
