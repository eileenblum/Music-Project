I'm walking down through the streets
A twisted sight is what I see
Broken people everywhere
But why should I even care
They live their lives in filth and pain
Down there down there
In the drain
They live their lives in human-hell
Down there down there In the drain
They're struggling for the white horse
A daily battle to go on
The same story every day
Down there in the devil's hood
They live their lives in filth and pain
Down there down there In the drain
They live their lives in human-hell
Down there down there In the drain
