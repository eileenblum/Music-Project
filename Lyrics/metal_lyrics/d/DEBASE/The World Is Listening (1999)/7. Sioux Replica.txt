Red sister raise your hands
White sister - doing the same
Red mother burn in flames
White mother - doing the same

Don't call the spirits in your name:
Don't let the spirits free if you don't believe

Red brother circle your head
White brother - doing the same
Red father recycle your pain
White father - doing the same

Don't call the spirits in your name:
Don't let the spirits free if you don't believe
Don't call the spirits in your name:
Don't let the spirits free if you don't believe
