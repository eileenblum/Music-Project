The bitter taste from your tears
Takes the hunger away
Please let the low weight stay
Take a look in the mirror and pray
Starving for a lie
Who am I - will I die?
The ideal now the heroin-chiq look
Taken from some model book
Take a look in the mirror and pray
Starving for a lie
Who am I - will I die?
