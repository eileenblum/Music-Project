Nightmare, pure fiction dream
And you can not hear your own scream
You are a strange fruit
Hanging in the tree
Blood on the roots
You're killing me
Missing the blood-red wine
And you're dead after 9
Feeling kind of strange
With the rope around your neck
You are a strange fruit
Hanging in the tree
Blood on the roots
You're killing me
A black shadow comes around your neck
And wonders if you want to be the sailor
Under deck
Six fucking feet under ground
And you still can hear the cathedral sound
Was this the people's choice
Or was this god's own voice
Darkness underground
And you can't hear a sound
You're bound
