Strong master we adore your cruel world
Sweet prince let the nighttime begin
Oh lord let whip all your chains
Oh lord please give us the pain

Black Caesar rules the world
Black Caesar is over us

Strong master we are only your slaves
Pain is a dance on the edge of misery

Black Caesar rules the world
Black Caesar is over us
And I'm lying down on my knees
And begin you more please

Your right is to whip all the chains
Your right is to give us the pain

Black Caesar rules the world
Black Caesar is over us
I'm lying down on my knees
And begin you more please
Sacrifice and whip me Lord Caesar
