Ten years in universe
allied in credulous sympathy
ten years of confidence
the world is getting back to shape again

ten years of evil birth
constructing for destruction
ten years unholiness
then the deathstar's back
and the empire strikes

the darkside's back
the empire
the darkside's back

the last few years has been good to you my friend,
now the napalm is falling like rain again,
desolation and fear is crawling around
cause the emperors back and he will attack !!

inevitable conflict's raising
you'll never thrust again
all your friends around you
you'll never see again
you think - you're safe no no no way
cause the empire strikes

the darkside's back
the empire
the darkside's back
