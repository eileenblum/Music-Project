"For me it's all the same,
To live or to dream...

Far beyond the world of light,
Exists my realm, desolate and cold, beyond all hope...

I cannot feel the heartbeat of time anymore...

Blind eyes see the stars,
Shining bright here every night,
Beyond them breeds another dream that I'll never reach,
Deep on the ground of the black sea is buried what once was joy...

For me it's all the same...all the same...emotionless as I look above the land...

Sitting on my icy throne,
Above a blackened sky,
Crowned as undivine divine,
In endless halls of loneliness,
Immortal but not eternal is my reign,
Without spirit, without a soul,
Within the darkness of my mind...

I fall in a black hole without end,
I fall eternally to somewhere far beyond..."
