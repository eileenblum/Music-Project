"Not made of flesh and bone are the minions of eternity,
But deadly as the cold, vast, void itself...

As nightmares they come and breed in our heads,
Neither dead nor alive...

Not personified, but always there,
Hunting our shadows,
Playing with our fears...

Unseen since the beginning of mankind,
Not personified, but always there,
With the strength of aeons they ride, and chant, the demons of your mind...

They feed their hunger, they feed their greed,
With fear, the demons of the deep abyss,
Beyond the small line you call sanity,
They wait eternally..."
