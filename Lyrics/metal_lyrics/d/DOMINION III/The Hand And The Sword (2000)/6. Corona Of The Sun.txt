"I am the corona of the sun, the ferocious wings of light, that burn your soul eternally...

Fear me, for I am the last who'll stand if mankind awaits its very end...

I am the corona of the sun, the ferocious wings of death,
I send my rays to burn your skin and what remains is death...just death...

I am the corona of the sun, the ferocious wings of fury,
If the universe collapses, and my journey takes its new route,
I leave this pathetic mess of time and you alone in your ignorance...

I am the corona of the sun, the ferocious wings of hate..."
