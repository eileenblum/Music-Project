"Darkness falls...from above upon the land,
As the fist of rage strikes the ground,
And perishes all mortal life...

Forgotten is humanity,
By the survivors in the cold...

Shadows of a joyful past,
Now alone in a dying world,
Forever damned to hear the screams of millions,
Again and again...

Now snow covers the burnt earth,
So cold...

The dead remain as a memorial,
For those who wander through the ruins,
Of a forgotten civilization,
So cold...

Ice is all they see,
Ice, from horizon to horizon,

There exists no more hope for those who belong to the wandering shadows in the dark..."
