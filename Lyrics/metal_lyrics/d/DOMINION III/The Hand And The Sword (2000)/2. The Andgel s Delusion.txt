"Did you really believe that you could betray,
The one that once held your hand?
You lose your wings my little angel,
And now you are on your way down,
Down where you belong...

Beyond your conscious breeds the truth,
Disastrous and dark...now you'll burn in the eternal flames...

Do you really who you are?
Remember the past, remember your blasphemy,
By blood your contract was signed,
Youth for soul, knowledge for damnation...

Now you are on your way down my little angel,
Down where you belong,
To sit beside the father in the fire..."
