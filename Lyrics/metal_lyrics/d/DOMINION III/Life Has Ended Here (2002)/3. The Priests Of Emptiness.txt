Silently...
I'm analysing the essence of life
I'm analysing the essence of the void
Fields of endless emptiness
Fields of the unknown
Fields where thousand souls
Await their harvest

I'm there, awaiting your sleep
I'm here to suck your thoughts
I'm analysing the essence of life
I'm analysing the essence of the void
We are the priests of emptiness
Bringer of illusions
The harvesters of dreams

Silently...
I break the wall surrounding your thoughts
I suck your dreams and grow with it
I came for you as I promised at your birth
The same way I once promised your mother
We are the priests of emptiness

I'm there, awaiting your sleep
I'm here to suck your thoughts
I'm analysing the essence of life
I'm analysing the essence of the void

I break the wall surrounding your thoughts
I suck your dreams and grow with it
I came for you as I promised at your birth
The same way I once promised your mother
Fields of endless emptiness
Fields of the unknown
Fields where thousand souls
Await their harvest

We are the priests of emptiness
Bringer of illusions
The harvesters of dreams
We are the priests of emptiness
Bringer of illusions
The harvesters of dreams

Silently...
I break the wall surrounding your thoughts
I suck your dreams and grow with it
I came for you as I promised at your birth
The same way I once promised your mother
We are the priests of emptiness
