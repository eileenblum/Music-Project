As the last ones dies
The hope disappeared
All is dead now,
A.I. reigns
And you are alone now
A dead heart in a dead world
Salvation is self deception
Salvation is self deception
Media brought us fatality
After the skies
Raged against us
The history of mankind ended
A dead heart
In a dead world
Salvation is self deception

As the last ones died
The hope disappeared
All is dead now, A.I. reigns
And you are alone now
A dead heart
In a dead world
Salvation is self deception
Salvation is self deception
Media brought us fatality
A dead heart In a dead world

Every thousand years
The world should die
The process of evolution
Has ended now
A poem for a dead heart
Has been written
Burnt in unnatural fire
Profanated in natural hate
Lame seem to be
The words now
No voice to speak them
No ears to listen to them
For a dead heart
In a dead world
Scabby,
Damned,
Forgotten
Like never spoken
Thousand voices were louder
Than one whisper

As the last ones died
The hope disappeared
All is dead now, A.I. reigns
And you are alone now
A dead heart
In a dead world
Salvation is self deception
Media brought us fatality
After the skies
Raged against us
The history of mankind ended
A dead heart
In a dead world
Salvation is self deception

Every thousand years
The world should die
The process of evolution
Has ended now
Thousand voices were louder
Than one whisper
Salvation is self deception
Salvation is self deception
Media brought us fatality
A dead heart
In a dead world

Every thousand years
The world should die
The process of evolution
Has ended now
Thousand voices were louder
Than one whisper
Salvation is self deception
Salvation is self deception
Media brought us fatality
A dead heart in a dead world

Every thousand years
The world should die
The process of evolution
Has ended now
The process of evolution
Has ended now
Scabby,
Damned,
Forgotten
Scabby,
Damned,
Forgotten
Scabby,
Damned...
Thousand voices were louder
Than one whisper
