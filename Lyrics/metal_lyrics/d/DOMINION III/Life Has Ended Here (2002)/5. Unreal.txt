I put down my mask
And I laugh into the shining sun
Bright it shines
And it laughs back
What I've thought of yesterday
It is blown away by this bright pride

My sorrow, my fears
They all die in this shining brightness
All die in this shining brightness
A discovery for the eyes
Of course the last one...

Many people told me
What they'll do in their last minute
I don't believe them anymore
I pit down my mask
And I laugh into the shining sun
I put down my mask
And I laugh into the shining sun

I thought about what I'll do
in my last minute
But what else could I do than staring
nothing survives...

I put down my mask
And I laugh into the shining sun
Bright it shines and it laughs back
What I've thought of yesterday
It is blown away by this pride

My sorrows, my fears
They all die in this shining brightness
All die in this shining pride
A discovery for the eyes
of course the last one...

One second to live
One thought remains
Is this unreal
Is this unreal
One second to live
One though remains
Is this unreal
Is this unreal

One second to live
One thought remains
Is this unreal
Is this unreal
