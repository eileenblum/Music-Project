Virulence stopped the traffic long ago
Silence lasts upon the cities
Pestilence and civil war
Have drawn their picture
On the streets
Alone I walk between the ruins
Of a fading world
Wandering between class palaces
And steel cathedrals

Rain drops are falling
On empty places
Where once children played
Wind finds it's way
In every little hole
Silence is imminent
No more stench, no more noises
Live has ended here
