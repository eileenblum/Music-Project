Winter is coming
With deep grey clouds
The fallout has just begun
The earth fades into dust
The last morning arrives
The last morning arrives

Unknown the future
No remorse for the past
Forsaken the future
We don't know regret

The nature of man
Unveiled in it's last breath
No one escapes
The apocalypse
Hypocrisy and false moral
Ignorance and failure

Winter is coming
With deep grey clouds
The fallout has just begun
The earth fades into dust

Unknown the future
No remorse for the past
Forsaken the future
We don't know regret

We dared to enter
The inner sanctum
The nature of man
Unveiled in it's last breath
Masters of wisdom
We never were

The revelation of the future
The unveiling of the past
The nature of man
And malevolence
