When the sky is covered
By black smoke
When the rivers are full of blood
Shadows of ages, take me back
Into the unknown, into death

When I open the gates to the unseen
I will fall into the abyss of weep

Black wind of the dead
Inflames my eyes slowly to red
The ancient cult will be again
I hear the gods of war and pain
