In silence my soul is crying out
My thoughts in pain with hellbound
Removing all the past illusions
That drift away into confusions

Darkened thoughts - in my mind
Coldness comes - to touch my life
Desecrator of the coming ghoul
Triumphator of my damned soul

My weeping soul is bleeding out
Sound of sirens in my mouth
I betray my perished existence
Into nocturnal adoration
