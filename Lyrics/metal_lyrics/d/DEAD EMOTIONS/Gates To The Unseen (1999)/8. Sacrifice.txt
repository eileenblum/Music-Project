I live in a world of hate
The feelings of guilt and disgrace
Tortured through my life
And praying for the sacrifice
Hope for a life that can be obtained
In a world that teaches no pain
In death my spirit rise
A new beginning to my life

Praying for the sacrifice
Praying for a new life

When the sund has died
When the angels are blind
Blood will rain from heaven high
And I can hear lost souls cry
Grip of dark eternity
Dwell in infinite misery
Through darkening they came
With agony they will reign
