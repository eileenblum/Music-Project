The nights of chaos and storms arise
Burning flames catch my eyes
Into the silent shadows I crawl
Upon the darkened throne so cold

Voices calling out my name
They want to take my soul away
Into the nicht of ravens winter
Into the darkened celtic winter

On black wings of destiny
Angels in black sanctuary
I can see the burning fire
Unite with me in dark desire

In the flames of a pagan blaze
I can see through cosmic haze
Silent screams of suffering
Souls in flames of torturing

Gods of flesh and dark desire
Grant me with the hellish fire
Through the long forgotten dreams
Through the mountains of dark gleams
