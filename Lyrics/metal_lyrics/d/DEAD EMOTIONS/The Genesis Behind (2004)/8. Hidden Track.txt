Behind an old empty building
I found you lying on a hidden track
I realized that all I've done
Might have been wrong
Nothing stayed the same after that conversation
As your face, your mind didn't change
But I don't know you anymore
The bad sides of your soul came out
In intervals everything broke into pieces
You'd kept the faith that everything
Would rutn into a happy end
I'm sorry, I must disappoint you
It's not easy to tell you these words:
Bye bye, baby!
I'm not a fucker
I have principles
I must do this
It's over now
Fuck the good things I clawed myself on
Look into the future, don't look back!
