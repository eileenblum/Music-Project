Look into the mirror and tell me
What kind of pictures do you see?
Disturbing and awful or clear and beautiful?
Again moving towards the end
Or a beginning that makes you smile?
Expensive heartbreak getting more and more
The mind seems to be erased and sour
A decade of misgiving soon begins
With a cold heart the first cluster arrives
One step closer to the end
One mile far from choice
I will do a sacrifice when you will do a sacrifice
An empire falls in glory and blight
Spring hasn't yet arrived
Soon the sun will shine
And life will flood my veins
The last aspiration comes true
Approved: the wish for a change
Reaching grace by by a fire-weapon
But this is murdering myself
The spreaded sugar tastes bitter
And so your blood does taste
