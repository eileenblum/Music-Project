My weapens are pen and calculator
To divide the good from the bad
Rawness isn't sexy, the beginning of the fall of Babylon
Congratulations motherfucker
What you did, you did wrong
Wiht my own eyes I saw
With my own ears I heard
That your world perverted more
That's what I can't accept
The exorcist inside of me tells me what to do
To divide the good from the bad
Helplessness is needful to break one more being
Sorry motherfucker, I can't leave your life as it is
All that I've tried made me insane
Why should I stand near you, see you drowning?
Don't want my help?
Then I'll send you to hell
I must start a war
To get you back on earth
