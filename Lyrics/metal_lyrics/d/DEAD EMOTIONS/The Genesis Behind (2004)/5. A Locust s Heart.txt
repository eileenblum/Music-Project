Everyone who'll fight the flow
Hasn't understood anything
It's not a plague
It's a purifying storm
I stepped outside
Full of hope that anything will clean me
Washing away the sins from me
No more bad rememberance
No more hate and pain
I am tranquill, I am my pure self
A thrill to break the rules
But soon it formed complete addiction
Dying for this satisfyless kick
But now I fee the first drops on my skin
It's not a cold heart, it's a brave step outside
