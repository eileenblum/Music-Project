With the knife in your back and a grin on my face
We are flying towards the sun, to erase what we have done
So alone dreaming inside means to hide
Far from grace my mind is saved
Once upon my shell remains here
As all the shit I did showed me that it was wrong
Inside the fire I did make it clear
That I am a sinner before myself, dealing with hopes
Now that I've understood what freedom is about,
I started to react in such a perfect way
No one ever survives this awful situation
We call substantly arrogance for one last day
Welcome me, we could never see what is within us
Seduce me, with what you need to stay in oblivion
Follow me to this room and let me lock the door
Pride is gone, nothing happens anymore inside of me
But I conquered another world
Blue turns black as white created grey
My negative mind formed the genesis behind
I bite myself until I will awake
From my sickest dreams with wrath and crime
I can't let them go, they belong to me
Again we play, again they die again they make me smile
No helping hand did get me back, I am lost in the trees
Will I return home? Is it yet too late? Nobody hears me sigh
I won't give up, it's not my end something will happen
Stay away my anger is completely fed
Nothing will make a sound when all of you are falling down
Give me just one more knife
And I will end your lives as you stayed in the frontlines
Open your eyes, it's over now. I hope that no one survived
Take my hand, it's really over. Now you can really hate me
I won't tell the truth. I lie to you. Everything is all right.
