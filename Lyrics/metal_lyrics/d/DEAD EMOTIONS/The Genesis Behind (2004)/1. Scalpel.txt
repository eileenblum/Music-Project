Spit all the pain out, slit your own throat
Watch catharsis coming nearer, fading slowly away
Get tranquill and silent, everything is passing by
So much went wrong (loosing faith)
The time has come (loosing hope)
Nothing more to say (poor individual)
Age won't come (the mind is tired)
Open fearful your bright eyes, still the heart is cold as stone
Still the hole is open, it will never be closed again
So easy to hurt a kid, the soul is broken, unrepairable
The mechanoid is out of order
No chance to move the extremeties
Speech turns into fragments of words
Burning down a mothers heart (if not silent)
The ears won't hear joy anymore
The fingers will just tough poisoned thorns
The mouth just spitting out fear
The eyes just seeing red
Only one possibility left
Living in this world of plagues no more
Just a child's suicide
Could save its mind
