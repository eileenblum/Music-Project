[feat. Chad Ruhlig of Legend]Keep this to yourself. This face that once was remembered will never be seen. Can you hear me now...? Can you hear me now? Here me now! And now you think you know about me and my friends. About me and my friends. Now just think how it is, when you have a family by your side. Standing side by side, stronger than ever and no one can understand that. This is why me and my friends are forever family. Keep this to yourself people will come, people will go. Real friends will be there forever, they won't let you down. If you want to know, the meaning of brothers, me and my friends have each others backs, till the very end. And now you think you know about me and my friends. About me and my friends. Now just think how it is, when you have a family by your side. Don't act like you know us. This is my family this is my life. This is my life. I wouldn't change it for the world. For the world.
