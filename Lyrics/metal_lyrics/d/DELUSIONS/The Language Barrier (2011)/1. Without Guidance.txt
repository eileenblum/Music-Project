Take advantage of what you have today, this world is cursed, look what its come to. Its slowly dying down and down, day by day, night by night. When the world comes to an end, you will see what i mean. It will finally open your eyes, you will see for yourself. I have a story that will make you realize what this is all about. Day by day you think you are free, well think again cause there out for us, save yourself, now you gotta live for yourself. Now they want you to believe, that we all are living life free, guess again they want you for themselves. The world will come to an end, there will be no hope for you my friend. Get out while you can. I have a story that will make you realize, what this is all about. day by day you think you are free well think again cause theyre out for you. When the day comes we'll all be machines, In this pathetic place you call a home. You should all run while you fucking can. Failure, to listen to me will haunt you. We're being watched every move we make. Do not cross the line. Just know that we will abandon the earth, They are always on their way to clear us out. Failure, to listen to me will haunt you. We're being watched every move we make, get out why you can.
