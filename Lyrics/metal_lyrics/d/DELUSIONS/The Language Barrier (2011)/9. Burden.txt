If this is what you want, then this is what youll get. No more bullshit the past is the past, this could not last. Mother fucking two timing bitch, youll never be any better than this. Wipe these tears you know i dont care, i dont care. When will these words sing to me, they never will be able to see, why i choose to write this to you. i am the posion that will burn in your fucking heart. In your fucking heart. These words are put in my head, were falling further up from gravity. These words are put in my head, they never meant much you never meant much now. If this is what you want the this is what youll get. youll get! what happend to me, what happend to you, what happend to us. just sit back and cover yourself. What happenned to me, what happend to you, to you!
