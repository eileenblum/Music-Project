Walking down this road to far, falling further. One step taken way to far, speechless, liar. And as i walk this road to far these memories are stuck in my head like they always will be. Where are you now, where are you now. do you recall knowing what the meaning of loyalty is. Stand true to all, no fakes are allowed on my time. dont let this let you think different of me. Of me, make these words carefully listened to. i wont let you down, i wont let you down. You will not be let, down on my fucking time. Take these words upon yourself. upon yourself. Walking down this road to far, falling further. One step taken way to far, speechless, liar. Take what i am saying, put it through your head. These words wont do you wrong. You wont be let down, you wont be let, you will not be let down on my time.
