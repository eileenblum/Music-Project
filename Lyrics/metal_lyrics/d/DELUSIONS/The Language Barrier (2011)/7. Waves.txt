Running circles again we dont know where to begin where are we now. Getting back on track would be the only way out or to walk these waves. When you go so far so far from here. youll see you have a home all along, right here by your side. Running circles again we dont know where to begin where are we now. Just ride these waves past your troubles, dont fear a thing. As we rise we stand tall and hold our ground x2 learn to trust me, dont lose your head, lose your head. Just watch how we can, can walk these waves, and well just say how we can walk these waves. Waves we can walk these waves, and ill say that we , we can all walk these waves. Just say how we can.
