Take everything away that you had, or that you wanted. Systems will take you down. They wont have mercy for you, acting like your the king of everything. Standing tall with no one standing behind you. Just so you know, its right in front of you now. take it or leave it now is your time to shine. You think so highly of yourself but why are you here , why are you here. own up to your own words and notice that your nothing that you say that you are. the time has come for you, take in consideration that the world doesnt revolve around you, it doesnt revolve around you. No it doesnt it. Just so you know. Its right in front of you now take it or leave it now is your time to shine. You think so highly of yourself but why are you here why are you here. Lies just keep, coming out your mouth. Lies just keep coming on and on. you lie like a useless coward. your lies are not being taken from me now. Dont speak to me [x3]
