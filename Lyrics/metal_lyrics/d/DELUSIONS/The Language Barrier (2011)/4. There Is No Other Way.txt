On top of the world, Look what ive done with my life, when you said i would be no where i strived for the best that i could make of it , and now look where i am. On the top of the world, on top of it all. and whose to say i would would be nothing , i told you all i had a dream, and i finally made this dream come true. a dream come true, i finally made it i finally did it. How does this feel now, when this is all turned around on you, i strived for the best. Now you could think twice on saying i am nothing. i couldnt let myself down. You all know that i can see you now, couldnt do that to myself. all of these years i told you that i would make it now. Now im here to say that the life i live is proof that there is no other way. of telling you your wrong, take this song for an example. Think before you fucking insult me. who do you think that you. You all know that i can see you now, couldnt do that to myself. all of these years i told you that i would make it now. a dreamer, a wisher, thats all you are. you think you know what its like, do you? you hypocrite.
