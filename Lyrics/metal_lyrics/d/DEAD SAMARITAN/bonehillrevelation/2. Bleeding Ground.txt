I heard their skulls crack against the walls
a sound of never-ending sleep
I hear those who once were flesh and bone
speak to me from the riverÂ´s deep

The haunting voice may never leave
as the war inside wonÂ´t cease
CanÂ´t escape this violent maze
the pounding sound of relentless rain
while marching on...

Bleeding ground
Only ashes will remain
There wonÂ´t be headstones with our names
on bleeding ground

Just left them lying down in there
truly cheap is the life of man
We thought theyÂ´d be easy to forget
But thickÂ´s the blood on our godlike hands

It doesnÂ´t matter what future holds
All I need is the sweetest rush
Must move on, the war drum pounds
How I love how the chaos sounds
on bleeding ground
