Awake the darkness
unveiling demon seed
Enchant the shadows
tempted by our greed
Death-ridden mind
reigns our hungry souls
Endless growing urge
to need it all...

[Chorus:]
The fire purifies
a mass annihilation
The only true creation
is to begin destruction
We are the...
We are the demons
We are the...
We are the end of times

Set the world afire
dance the cleansing flame
Love the sight of
the cities how they burn
Humans are like weeds
invade and multiply
Hell is all concrete
surrounding all our lives

[Chorus:]
All our sins awashed
no more chained to life
Demons are unleashed
become the ending kind
We are the...
We are the demons
We are the...
We are the ending kind
