Never forgot the twist
of the knife in my back
Words that were whispered
were said with the tongue of serpent
A venomous, deadly kiss
given when least expected
Each and every promise
given with false intent,
but now beware!

[Chorus:]
Now retaliate
the sweeter is the taste
Iâd love to see you crawl
Need to get even now
Iâll humiliate
The most of it Iâll make
It will be worth the wait
âcos paybacks are a bitch
Youâll know when I will hit your home

So now the stage is set
for the Grande Finale
The measure of my hate
is never known to man before
Watch your every step
always look behind
Iâll be in your sleep
a worst case nightmare to despair!

[Bridge:]
âNemesis, thy name
is sacred through revenge
Iâm your humble slave
to the endâ
