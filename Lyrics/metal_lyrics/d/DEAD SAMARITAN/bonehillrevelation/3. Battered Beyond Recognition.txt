Before I was made to taste my blood
I never saw what was to come
All that pain and endless horror
the storm after the calm

Hook! Jab!
Blows turn body numb
What a great macho hero

Die! Die!
Scum sucking pig, die!
All you really are is a zero

Never had a chance to realise
what the fuck was going on
But hope IÂ´ll get a chance to recognise
your sorry little ass from the line

[Chorus:]
You really must feel proud
Such a manly man
ThatÂ´s what youÂ´re about
but never understand

Strike! Strike!
Eyes moulding shut
Another hit cuts the night

Burn! Burn!
How could I forget when IÂ´m
battered beyond recognition?

The bones you broke may heal some day
but what about the scars within?
You sickest little fuck better watch yourself
if weÂ´ll ever meet in the dark!

âHey you pathetic, weak, little fucking prick
I know where you live and you better run fast Â´cos
IÂ´ll hunt you down one by one by one...â

[Chorus:]
You really must feel proud
Such a manly man
ThatÂ´s what youÂ´re about
but never understand
