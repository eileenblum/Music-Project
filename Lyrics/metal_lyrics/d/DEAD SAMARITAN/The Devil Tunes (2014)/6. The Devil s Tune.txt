Heading for the road
No oneâs in the way
A nightly revving show
High on high octane
Ride until itâs morning
Never gets too late
From twilight to the dawning
Join and seal your fate

[Chorus:]
Look into the mirror
I am what youâll see
I am the riding terror
on fiery wheels of steel
All I wanna hear
is the roar and boom
Itâs music to my ears
Sing to the Devilâs Tune!

Feel the full-on throttle,
speeding on the rammer
The night is getting hotter
with my Thunder Hammer
Pumping blood and gasoline,
a blinding flash of light
Life is full of ecstasy
as I charge into the night

[Chorus:]
Look into the mirror
I am what youâll see
I am the riding terror
on fiery wheels of steel
All I wanna hear
is the roar and boom
Itâs music to my ears
Sing to the Devilâs Tune!

Sing! Sing! Sing to the Devilâ¦
Sing! Sing! Sing to the Devilâ¦
