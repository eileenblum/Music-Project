Can you see this land, what's left of it,
scarred and soaked with blood?
In the ruins of those once proud towns
bones of my rivals lie

Yet I only did what I was told to do
to win this mighty prize
I followed all the rules and prophecies
to see the world through an emperor's eyes

Ready to fight
to take what is mine
I held my ground
Last man wears the crown
I'm on my way
to fulfill my fate
immortality's mine
Last man wears the crown

I remember the fighting
I remember the wars
It was a bloody symphony
The world had never seen such cruelty,
blood flowing like wine

Ready to fight
to take what is mine
I held my ground
Last man wears the crown
I'm on my way
to fulfill my fate
immortality's mine
Last man wears the crown

Mushroom clouds, viral outbreaks
screaming children burned with napalm
Mothers raped with branding irons
to satisfy my ambitions

I hail thee, Darkness, my only friend
Now that my world has come to its end
No Phoenix will rise from the ashes
of the land destroyed by my hands

Yet I only did what I was told to do
but the prize was just a lie
I followed all the rules and prophecies
to see the world through a failure's eyes

Here I am, the only one still standing,
the crown of thorns in my hand
I remain to rule this nothingness
bleak and radiated land

Ready to fight
to take what is mine
I held my ground
Last man wears the crown
I'm on my way
to fulfill my fate
immortality's mine
Last man wears the crown
