Shades that hide the fiercest of creatures
Crawl in the deadliest kind
Death shall rise in grimmest of features
Lurking at you in the night

[Pre-chorus:]
Itâs hissing and squirming
Itâs twisting and worming
The lowest of reptiles under your bed
While tossing and turning
youâre screaming, youâre burning
Itâs making you wish you were deadâ¦

The beast! ... inside your head!
The beast! â¦inside your head!

[Pre-chorus:]
Itâs hissing and squirming
Itâs twisting and worming
The lowest of reptiles under your bed
While tossing and turning
youâre screaming, youâre burning
Itâs making you wish you were deadâ¦

[Chorus:]
Into the mouth of the beast
The bottomless gorge!

Beware, behold, somethingâs in the air
You know itâs ready to shoot
Now thereâs more, and theyâre everywhere
Sizzling and spitting at you

[Pre-chorus:]
Theyâre hissing and squirming
Theyâre twisting and worming
The lowest of reptiles under your bed
While tossing and turning
youâre screaming, youâre burning
Theyâre making you wish you were deadâ¦

[Chorus:]
Into the mouth of the beast
The bottomless gorge!

The darkness brings the beast!
