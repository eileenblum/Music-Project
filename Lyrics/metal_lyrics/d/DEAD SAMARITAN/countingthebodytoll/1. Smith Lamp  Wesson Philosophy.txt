I am the only God
There are no other gods
I take shit from no-one

âWipe the trouble outâ
itâs what Iâm all about
I believe in my gun

Gotta compensate
their growing impotence
This gun ainât shooting blanks

Try to take me down
Iâve got plenty of rounds
One wrong move could be the last

If I ever got caught
like I never thought
Iâd blast my way out for fun

Iâm on a fucking roll
Counting the body toll
Blowing the smoke when Iâm done

[Chorus:]
Shooting my way right through
Guns donât kill but I do
Blasting is such poetry
Smith &amp; Wesson philosophy
