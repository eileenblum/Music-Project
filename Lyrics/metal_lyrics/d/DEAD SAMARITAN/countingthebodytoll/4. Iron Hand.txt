Scum of human kind who live off others' grief
The filth, the purest slime who should feel the steel
In every fucking way a disgusting little mind
I hate, I hate, I hate your kind

This is the final stand
Awaken Iron Hand

[Chorus: ]
Heading to the limit where none can take no more
Into infinity where all hope is long gone
Descending to the depths where no mortal's gone before
To the darkest city where it all is purest gore

Unleash the bloody fury, be an iron hand
Be the judge and jury of this forsaken land
Force to beg and pray, hear no pleading cries
Let the sword sway in their fearing eyes

This is the final stand
Awaken Iron Hand

[Chorus:]
Heading to the limit where none can take no more
Into infinity where all hope is long gone
Descending to the depths where no mortal's gone before
To the darkest city where it all is purest gore
