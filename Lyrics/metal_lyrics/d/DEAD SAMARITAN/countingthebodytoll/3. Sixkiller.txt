In a solitary cell out of time and place
Like an earthly hell until the end of days

Five years for each slug I put through their heads
Inside this grave Iâve dug like a shadow of what I used to be
There is no turning back but to dwell in memories
Just an empty human wreck, what has become of me?

[Chorus:]
Sixkiller â Am I out of line
Sixkiller â This ainât human life
Sixkiller â Iâve read every sign
Sixkiller â Iâm done doing timeâ¦

In a solitary cell out of time and place
Like an earthly hell until the end of days

Day after day all just the same, counting the ends of bricks
Grim words around the walls telling grotesque tales
Emptiness that is my heart, I remember you my love
My sweet, cold-steeled gun

[Chorus:]
Sixkiller â Am I out of line
Sixkiller â This ainât human life
Sixkiller â Iâve read every sign
Sixkiller â Iâm done doing timeâ¦
