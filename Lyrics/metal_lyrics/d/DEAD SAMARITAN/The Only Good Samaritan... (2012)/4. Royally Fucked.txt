Stabbed in the back
By a feeble little rat
Betrayed in the shittiest way

Feeding petty lies
Before my very eyes
The things you have nerve to say!

You shouldnât have shown your cards
The two-faced dead heart
Slippery little serpent tongue
I learned that youâre a fake
But hellâs about to break
So donât you even think you have won...

Your honey-covered words
Are not even worth
A pile of shit, it seems

To deserve the worst
It takes such a turd
A disgusting greedy leech

You shouldnât have shown your cards
The two-faced dead heart
Slippery little serpent tongue
I learned that youâre a fake
But hellâs about to break
So donât you even think you have won...

Soon enough youâll learn
That the tables will turn
When I pick up my weaponry
Hell is now unleashed
As the liberated beast
Is about to put you on your knees

Ready or not
Things are getting hot
Soon youâll know you just got
Royally fucked!
