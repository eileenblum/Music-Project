We are invincible,
Holy soldiers of god
Stand in our way and I
Swear you will die

Nothing can stop us now as
We're flying high
Say hello to our Fat Man, suckers,
As it falls from the sky

Up here I can't hear them scream
Or smell their burning flesh
Maybe they call me a monster
- Hell if I care!

Nothing can stop us now as
We're flying high
Say hello to our Fat Man, suckers
As it falls from the sky

This is our calling
To slay the enemy
By these two hands
Justice is dealt

Crash! Boom! Bang!
The damage is done!
Bleed! Burn! Scream!
Death to enemy!

They don't pay me for thinking
I only do as I'm told
The job is done and the setting sun
Paints our wings with gold

Nothing can stop us now as
We're flying high
Say hello to our Fat Man, suckers
As it falls from the sky

Have you ever seen
A more beautiful sight
Than is that fiery, flaming
Mushroom cloud in the sky!
