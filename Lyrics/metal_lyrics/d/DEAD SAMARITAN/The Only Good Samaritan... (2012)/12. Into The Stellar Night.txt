What is left of us
But a shivering, crumbling mess
This was the life we lived
This wasnât just a test

Weâve become a burden
It wasnât ours to keep
How could we be so blind
Weâve sunken far too deep

These are the last times
My beloved friend
Doom is now upon us
Into the bitter end

No time to mourn
I close my eyes
As mankind is to fade
Into the stellar night
