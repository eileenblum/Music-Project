Welcome to death zone
Population zero
Where blackened remains of a human face 
Greet you with a friendly hello

Welcome to the death zone
You crossed the point of no return
Now that you are here to stay
Our secrets will be revealed

Abandoned houses
Filled with dust 
Wind blows through the empty streets
Spreading invisible horror

Walking through the city
You wish there was someone there
Who would tell you just
What the hell is going on

Welcome to death zone
Population zero
Where blackened remains of a human face 
Greet you with a friendly hello

Welcome to the death zone
You crossed the point of no return
Now that you are here to stay
Our secrets will be revealed
Your life will end here
You will never, ever get home

You can't smell it, taste, see it, 
Invisible, lethal killer
Lurking everywhere

Did you wonder why your head hurts
Or why you can't seem to think straight
Your fever will only get worse
The sores on your skin won't fade
