Can you hear the rumble as theyâre closing in
or feel the tremors crawling on your skin
Those days of peacetime just a distant memory
as the mellow drama turns to horrid tragedy

Obliterate! Annihilate!
Rage the skies to this serenade
when human race is laid to rest
Laid to waste, forever

Do you sense the smell of burning skin
or taste the blood running down your chin
Soon it will be much too late to run
from the cannon fires as our flesh is well done

[Chorus:]
Obliterate! Annihilate!
Rage the skies to this serenade
when human race is laid to rest
Laid to waste
Obliterate! Annihilate!
A gruesome dance of hungry flames
we turn to dust, oblivion
Laid to waste, forever

Smell your burning skin
Blood running down your chin
It is too late to run
Much too late to run
