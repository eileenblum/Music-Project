From the dusk like nightmare rising
A feline prowling in the night
Blood red moon reflects in my eyes
I'm a demon, one of a kind

(I'm the - Deathbringer)

I'm the one
The only one
Your only one

Queen of darkness
Mistress of chaos
Saint of sinners

Say my name
Call my name
Scream my name

Say my name
Call my name, yeah
Scream my name
Deathbringer! 

I'm the one who dwells in your dreams
I'm the one who haunts your thoughts
Wish upon a star - I'll come for you
I'm the one who'll steal your soul

I'm the one
The only one
Your only one

Queen of darkness
Mistress of chaos
Saint of sinners

Say my name,
Call my name
Scream my name
Deathbringer!
Say my name
Call my name, yeah,
Scream my name
Deathbringer! Deathbringer thirteen!

Can you taste
The darkness in me
I am Death
Coming for thee
Ecstasy
Beyond your wildest dreams
Harmony
Of blood and steel

Call my name
Call my name
Call my name
