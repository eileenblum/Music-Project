Crackling from the surface
Tension bubbling under
Suspense is getting torturous, tearing you asunder

Take a listen, taste the fear
Eerie whispers in your ear
Take a look, petrify
The shadows move in your eyes

Every crack and rustle
Tremours down the spine
The deepest darkness crawls from the shadows of your mind

Breathing deep, panting heavy
Start to weep, holding steady
Sense the cold freezing air
Now you know, somethingâs in thereâ¦

Now itâs drawing near
Can you feel it, can you take it
Itâs feeding off your fear
Can you face it, can you make it

Take a good hard look inside
And see what you will find
The atrocities that hide in the shadows of your mind

Now itâs drawing near
Can you feel it, can you take it
Itâs feeding off your fear
Can you face it, can you make it
Can you make it?
Can you make it?

No!
