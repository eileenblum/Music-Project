In their search of eternal life
They made a monster of deadliest kind
I feel no regret, I know no remorse
Death will never unbind me

Thirteen swords impaled my corpse
I was a willing sacrifice
I had offered my life
To boost their fight
I was the biggest mistake they made

When I scream you'll fall on your knees
Unable to flee or fight
I'll drink your thoughts, empty your minds
And leave you dead in the night

Thirteen swords impaled my corpse
In their black magick ritual
I had offered my life
To boost their fight
I am their worst fear come to life

Once like them, I was a true Reichâs child
I was taught everything, I had no mind
But under their fÃ¼hrers horrified eyes
I turned against my masters, then all human kind

Thirteen swords
Impaled my corpse
In their black magick ritual
I offered my life
To boost their fight
I am their worst fear come to life

I will roam the world when youâre all gone,
When the doomsdayâs over, my shadow wonât fade
The only one of my kind, I will go on
I am the biggest mistake they ever made.

Sown in deceit, baptized in hate
I was the monster to create!
Raised in disgust, grew to revolt
I am to master my own wayâ¦
