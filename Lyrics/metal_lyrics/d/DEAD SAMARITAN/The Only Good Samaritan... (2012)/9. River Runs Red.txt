Seek retribution
In a fiery jungle hell
One true destination
As the voices urge to kill
Sounds of machetes
Swinging through the night
March to the cities
Hell is here tonight

A story once untold is now to be seen
Your true skin unfolds, my sworn enemy
Stare at this never-ending bloody trail
As the riverâs running red, in color of my hateâ¦

You are a rotten lot
A pack of heinous scum
I hope you will rot
For all the deeds youâve done
Oh it would feel so great
To see your blooded face
Disintegrate
Into the flames

A story once untold is now to be seen
Your true skin unfolds, my sworn enemy
Stare at this never-ending bloody trail
As the riverâs running red, in color of my hate
