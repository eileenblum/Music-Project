Tearing down the walls
Crushing all I can
Your shelters are no use when Iâll release my wrath

Can you see the light?
Can you hear the roar?
I am the rolling thunder and Iâve come back for more

Thunderbolt!
I am the Thunderbolt!
Thunderbolt...!

This is what I do
This is what I enjoy
I was born to wreak havoc, destroy!

The clouds are gathering
Waiting for the storm
Iâm so gonna see as some heads are gonna rollâ¦

Thunderbolt!
I am the Thunderbolt!
Thunderbolt!

Tearing down the walls
Crushing all I can
Your shelters are no use when Iâll release my wrath

Can you see the light?
Can you hear the roar?
I am the rolling thunder and Iâve come back for more

Thunderbolt!
I am the Thunderbolt!
Thunderbolt...!
I am the Thunderbolt!
