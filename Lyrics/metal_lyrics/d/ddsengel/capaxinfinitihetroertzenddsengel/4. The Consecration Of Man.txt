[performed by DÃ¸dsengel]I gazed into Her wondrous nothingness,
as it gazed into me!
As in the outer, so in the inner.
I saw the corroding poison
and my eyes drank deep.

Thrice blessed be the venom of Her chalice!
Thrice razed by the tower inner structures
for though they grant stability,
by nature they are marked as limitations.
Deny them!
Deny them!
Deny them!

The waters! The waters! The waters are upon us!
The gates! The gates! Are ripped from
their foundations!
A torrent! A torrent! Of nothingness flows and strangles!
Unformed, raging, torrent of dissolution!
Ahh, a world shatters.
The tree is ripped into broken shells.
And something new stirs in the womb of the Abyss.

Unborn One! Consecrated One! Anointed One!
The fiery Child is conceived!
And the sword of truth shattered
the rule of sedate comfort.
Yea, under the gaze of Nihil
did I behold the Consecration of Man.
