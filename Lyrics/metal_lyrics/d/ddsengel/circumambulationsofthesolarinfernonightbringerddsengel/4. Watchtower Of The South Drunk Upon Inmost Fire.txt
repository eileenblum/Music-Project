I have been given the flesh of the sun to eat, and the milk of the moon to drink.
I have pressed through the long night and been reborn through the realms of dissolution.

As a lone wanderer have I been lost in the unfathomable desert, the wastes of desolation, and I have won my way.

It is the time of the great reaping.
The great infernal star shines from its peak upon MY earth, as I claim my destined reward.

For now I am the lover of Ahator, Mistress of inebrity without end.

For now I am the ascending child, draped in the cloak of fire!

My ascent become me, its holy flames tear away my I.

In this DEATH, this moment of moments. In naked splendour as time stands still.

The past seems the life of another. The journey of a fool clad in many colours.

Yet upon this parzival, and those before him have I kindled my fresh leaping fire.
By those I were have I built my temple.

As I aspire with pure intent towards and beyond my starry throne, the temple of now must become a stone in the foundations of something infinitely greater.

The moment of truth.
The shattering of masks and mirrors.
The rendering of the last veil:

REALITY TREMBLES AS THE CHILD GOD IS DRUNK UPON INMOST FIRE.
