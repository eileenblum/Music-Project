He is risen, bornless one.
He is risen, the fiery child.
He is risen, the star of wormwood.
He is risen, the herald of dawn.
He is risen, who avenged his father.
Hi is risen, to conquer.

I lie in submissive adoration before the eastern gate.
The triumphal arch of the sol invictus
As the twilight eclipses the isolation of night

A momentous storm of fire and force shatters the dust of illusory conceptions as I beheld the self-creation of RA!

THE WILLED BIRTH OF A GOD!

The circumference has created the center.
The all has crowned itself with the point.
As my gaze is fixed, doubt has been conquered by sight.
