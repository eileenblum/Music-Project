Rotten embryo, distilled cadaverine
Cobbler's awl is dipped into the poisonous slime
Ether of the empty eye sockets reveals the hollowness of being
Worms tickle the miscarried children
Corpse striptease, rotten meat slipping down the bones
Protuberance of agonizing pulsations
Confidence became obsession
Where under gravity
All the human shit flows down
Cunt torn apart
This gurgling hole into microcosm of flesh
No longer crosses a man's path to comfort
Her ugliness spawns aversion only
Bathing in its own puke
Grimacing in vomiting convulsions
Sprinkling urine over body in intolerable pain
Soaked in sweat, covered with sperm
Down the infinite tunnels of veins
In search of immortal soul
Blunted but not yet rusted Vainly kitchen knife enthusiasm
Rips through layers of larvae and atmospheres
To reflect the truth on surface of its shiny steel
