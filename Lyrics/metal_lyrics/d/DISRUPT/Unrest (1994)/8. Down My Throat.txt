As individuals we have separate opinions,
some of them may clash while others concur but you,
you rush your views like some sort of Drug.

And criticize all who beg to differ.

Your views are shoved right down my throat I'm your equal,
no fucking scapegoat.

Your militant actions prove how shallow you are,
why cant you regard opimous that aren't your own.

Who are to look down on me?
So my discontent it grows and grows.

Your beliefs are forced right down my throat,
my respect dwindles as my anger bloats!
