Bunch of fucking mindless goons
We must rid the senseless fear and
Dare to evacuate your shell
Trendy fucks go to hell
We must break free of cliques and
Insurgents, outcasts, not allowed
Well fuck you and your limited thought
Your individualityÂ´s shit

[Chorus:]
No more mindlock

Why canÂ´t you think on your own
True feelings never shown
DonÂ´t be afraid to speak your mind
Leave your fears behind
Why canÂ´t you think for yourself
Instead of following everyone else
Take your rules that are so crass
And show them up your ass

[Chorus]

Fashions chains bind you together
Ruining sense of creativity
YouÂ´re drowning in your peers believes
Stricken to conformity

[1st verse]
[Chorus]
