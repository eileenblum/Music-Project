Sometimes when I'm falling down drunk
I may seem bothersome 'cos you're strag
But then again so are you

Same old shit

When I wake up tomorrow
I'll be my same old self
Without a single worry

Same old shit

But you, when you awake
You'll be the same ignorant fuck
That you were the night before

Same old shit
