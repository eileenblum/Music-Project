You're just a macho pig

Drink a 6-pack, ready to unload
Anger is building, ready to explode
Feel you must prove your courage and might
Find someone weaker, now you must fight

Macho pig

Your arms are big, your brain is small
If there's anything in your head at all
You're nothing more than a mindless jock
Pumping your iron, go pump your cock

Macho dick

You're just a macho dick

Stumble around, show off your muscle
Liquid courage, you're drowned in its puddle
False sense of strength, wound in a cocoon
Macho bigot, your day will come soon

Macho pig

Macho pig go fuck off!!!
