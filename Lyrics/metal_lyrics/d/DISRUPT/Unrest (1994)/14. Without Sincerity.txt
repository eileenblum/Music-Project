You strut around the stage like a fucking god
You're in your own world, that's where you will rot
In it for a buck, you're never sincere
The end of this dreamworld is all that you fear

Rock star fuck off - you make me sick
Rock star fuck off - your attitude sucks

People are just fans, all lower than you
They mean nothing, but neither do you
Girls are your groupies, pieces of meat
And end to this bullshit, I anxiously greet
