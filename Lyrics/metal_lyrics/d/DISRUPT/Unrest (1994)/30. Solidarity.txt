Narrow-minded views
Discolored red, white and blue
Proudly wave old glory
Hand on heart, it's the same old story

Faithfully defend your precious flag
How could you risk your life for a rag?
By choosing this path of nationalist pride
Feelings of solidarity stay bottled inside

Flag burners beware!
You'll be thrown in jail if you dare
This frame of thought's insane
Flush tradition down the drain

We'll never be free with such restrictions
Paranoia and false convictions
If there's a chance for solidarity
Let's step aside and let it be!
