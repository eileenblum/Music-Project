No sympathy or empathy
Only greed, fear and deceit
No unity or trust
For life you must compete
Striving for existence
A human stampede
Survival of the fittest
Oblivious to other needs

YouÂ´re damned to hell if you donÂ´t abide their laws
Another fault in an endless wave of flaws

Trampled by progression
Run into the ground
The carelessness of man
Never cease to astound
Selfishness, avidity
Fueled by dreams of wealth
Blinded by ignorance
Not hinking of our health

In a dog eat dog world itÂ´s are struggle to exist
An army of selfish pigs who want out to enlist
