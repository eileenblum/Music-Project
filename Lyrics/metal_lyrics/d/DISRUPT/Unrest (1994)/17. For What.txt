A minks fur savagely ripped from its back
So wealthy cunts can flaunt their riches
I can't see the glamour in wearing dead flesh
All they see is dollar signs as the animals perish

And for what? (glamour!)

Lipstick rammed down a rabbits throat
Hairspray shot into its eyes
So cunts can look and smell like shit
Why aren't they the ones that are made to suffer?

And for what? (sport!)

Electrodes strapped to their splintering skulls
Radiation surging through their bodies
Repetitious tests once again prove useless
But still you continue to ravage and destroy

And for what? (science!)

And for what?
