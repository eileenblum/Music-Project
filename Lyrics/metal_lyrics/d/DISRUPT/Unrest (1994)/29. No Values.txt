They live on the streets, can't get a decent job
You view them as bums, you label them slobs
You beat them up, you spit in their face
What the fuck would you do if you were in their place?

No values

Alone in the dark, the freezing cold
Only part of the famine that infests this world
You always put them down because you are rich
Well what would you do if there was a switch?

No values
