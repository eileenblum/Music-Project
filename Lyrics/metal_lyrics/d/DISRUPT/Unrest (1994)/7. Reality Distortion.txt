Behind walls of lies the plain truth,
which some attempts to deny and hide,
reality's grip is slowly loosened images falsified.

The media shit has your brainwashed.

Open your eyes stop being blind you clearly see the horrors are real,
miserable conditions,
agony prolonged,
yet you ignore the pain they feel.

Their propaganda has fucked your mind.

Chickens debaked,
chicks are smothered,
pigs are starved,
bulls castrated,
veal cows fed hormones,
antibiotics,
female cows constantly impregnated.

Mans tyranny over other living beings cannot be justified or proven safe,
people starve while doom cows eat what could be theirs,
factory farms are modern day concentration camps.

The conditions these animals are raised in are inhuman and extremely cruel,
forget these fairy tale images that the media has so conveniently led you to believe they are reared to live and eventually die in misery,
they've put family farms out of business you profit from the animals suffering so it's up to you and I to stop the torture!!!
