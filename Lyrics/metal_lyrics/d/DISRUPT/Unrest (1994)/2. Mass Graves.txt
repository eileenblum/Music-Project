Twisted dreams of a thousand-year Reich
distorted hopes of a master race.
From '33 to '45 the Nazis reigned throughout the years
racial hatred has sustained
innocent victims-wrongfully enslaved
endless corpses-buried in mass graves
The worst massacre in the history of "man"
To rule the human race was the fascists plan
6 million people slaughtered in vain
6 million murdered in Hitler's name.

[Chorus:]
Auschwitz
Dachau
Belsen
Buchenwald
corpses churned out like a bloody slaughterhouse
bulldozed into ditches like fucking trash
the graves covered along the consciences.
We must not let this ever happen again
to the whole idea we shall put an end
scum of the earth still exist today
We shall put them out of the way

[Chorus]
