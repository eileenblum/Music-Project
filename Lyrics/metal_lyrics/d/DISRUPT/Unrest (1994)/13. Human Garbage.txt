You're raping mother nature
As ecosystems collapse
Under the tremendous weight
Of a dominant mankind

Suffering earth - mankind's to blame
Suffering earth - reconstruction the aim

Wildlife expended
Exploited for human gain
All at mans leisure
All at nature's expense

Entering the woodland with your traps and your guns
Stalking helpless animals for sport and for fun
But your idea of sports is as sick as it gets
You slaughter and you maim without any regrets
Well someone's going to stop you, I promise you that
We wont sit back and watch it end as wallets grow fat
Millions of us out there know what you do is wrong
And together we're effective, our movement holds strong
