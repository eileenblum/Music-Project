YouÂ´re narrow minded
Building walls weÂ´re trying to destroy
Bigoted morons
WeÂ´ve had it with you, you fucking annoy

[Chorus:]
Smash divisions - and all who build them
Smash divisions - to hell with them

Black or white
Male or female, punk or skin
WeÂ´re in this together
TogetherÂ´s the only way weÂ´ll win

[Chorus]

What makes you better than anyone else?
Keep your foolish thoughts to yourself
Bashing gays
Just because theyÂ´re different from you
This isnÂ´t Auschwitz
YouÂ´re not Hitler and theyÂ´re not your Jews

[Chorus]
