Barefoot and pregnant
cooking his dinner obey his demands
he's the breadwinner
he comes home from work and slaps her around
forces her to fuck
then leaves her on the ground,
life without parole in this domestic prison,
since you said, "I do."
your life has been hell,
macho,
sexist,
bigot
captor of his cell never speak up
play the helpless role,
do what he wants
hes swallowed your soul

[Chorus]

macho attitudes stem from inner fears
your forced to hide your emotions,
never showing tears.
From the way you were raised to the image on the screen,
your true feelings still remain to be seen,
lash out in embarrassment,
your egos been deflated,
end dominance before it becomes instated,
Break free of the chains,
we want no gods or masters,
no one to be enslaved by chauvinist bastards,
domestic slavery
shall become the past,
destroy restrictions
liberate at last might just right
trust and honesty,
love and compassion
distributed equally

[Chorus]
