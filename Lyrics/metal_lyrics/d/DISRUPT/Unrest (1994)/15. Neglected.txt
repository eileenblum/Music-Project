Brought into this world on quite unfair terms
Subject to abuse, with lessons to learn
But no one to teach you, you're teaching yourself
Misery and fear is all you've ever felt

Left on your own - unfortunate soul
Fend for yourself - in this world you're alone
Screamed at and hit - treated like shit
With no one to trust - neglect's all you get

Beaten unconscious, a daily routine
Nowhere to sleep, hungry, unclean
Sift through the garbage and find your next meal
This isn't TV, it's quite fucking real
