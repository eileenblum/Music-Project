There is no competition
We're not striving to top the heap
Unity will never be
If we insist on judging others
Don't take it at face value
Why can't we just lend support
Instead of building obstacles
We feel impelled to overcome

This is no contest

Your opinion is respected
But you always cut us right down
Without bothering to give it a chance
Jump the gun, attach your label
By assessing, you're dividing
Constructing walls which need not be
Who are you to find fault
We're "only" human and you are shit

Life is no contest
