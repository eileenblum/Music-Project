I saw a black man on T.V.,
brutalized by authority,
he was,
He was beatened to the ground,
clubbed over and over,
just another case of abuse of power,
it just so happens all the cops were white,
6 on 1 the pigs prove their might!,
race crimes committed throughout the years,
police thrive off the public fears

[Chorus:]
now is the time to rise from this staggent slumber.

Stop the racist crime,
before its figures grow in number,
besides proof beyond a reasonable doubt,
amidst the angry ories and shouts,
the guilty party get off scat-free,
in their white-ex cop community,
basic rights stripped because of ones race,
among the jury,
not a single black face riots insure public outrage and anger suppressed for fucking ages,

[Chorus]

some times it takes more than shouts and banners,
we must fight back but not in this manner,
you haven't challenged those who are to blame,
your cells and innocence the ones you maimed,
these ignorant scum they have to pay but there's gotta be a better way,
human rights pertain to all the people,
we've got a long way to go before we're truly equal,

[Chorus]
