Another set of rules to keep you in line
They've reserved you a space so you bide your time
Something to look forward to, something to make you feel safe
So you gave all your support to the church and state

Religion, religion, religion is a fraud
And so is the myth you refer to as god

Send your kids to school, hope they'll fit the mold
Make them learn they'll be punished if they don't do as they're told
But it's punishment enough growing up in these times
They don't need a godwash to cleanse their minds

Something to keep you content until you die
Pray every day to Jesus and all will be fine
Why don't you grow up and observe all the lies
God's only in your head, when will you realize
