Exorbitant prices must diminish
Exorbitant prices must decrease

ItÂ´s gotten out of hand
More money they demand
Inflation rising
The economyÂ´s about to rupture

All your stinking cash
Shove it up your ass

Fortune their conquest
TheyÂ´re robbing us blind
Seeing to their own needs
Less fortunate forgot

Megalomaniac
Enough money to wipe your ass

Exorbitant process must diminish
Exorbitant process must decrease
