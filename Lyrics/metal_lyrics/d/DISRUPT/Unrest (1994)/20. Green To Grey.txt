More forests fall, more land is cleared
Progress and development instill its fear
Slowly but surely earth's wasting away
But they never fret 'cause they're still getting paid

Buildings replace forests
Earth turns from green to gray
A hazardous environment
Uncertain of another day

The sun is shining, it's rays burning strong
Your skin begins pealing, somethings gone wrong
But you see, without trees there is no shade
But they don't give a fuck as long as money is made

The soil crumbles and washes into the sea
No roots to secure it so it becomes free
Village water contaminated, unsafe to drink
When will these bastards fucking think?
