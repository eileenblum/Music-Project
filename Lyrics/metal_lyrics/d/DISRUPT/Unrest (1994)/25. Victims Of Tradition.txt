You grew up "normal", parents taught you well
Learn to trust in god or your soul will rot in hell
ItÂ´s natural to hate those different from you
Namely blacks, gays, Hispanics and Jews

CH: Victims of tradition

Obey your teachers, every word the speak the truth
Even if they say musicÂ´s the downfall of our youth
ItÂ´s wrong to deviate from what they call the norm
YouÂ´ll be condemned if you choose to not conform

[Chorus]

Turkey on thanksgiving, flags waved on the fouth
Steak dinner every Sunday, after mass of course
Get married in a church, three children and a wife
Safe and secure in your traditional life

[Chorus]
