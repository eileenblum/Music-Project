it's been said before,
well say it again,
won't stop screaming,
'til we make amends,
it's nothing new,
But nothings changed,
The fights not over,
we continue to complain.
Complain,
complain until you end their pain.
Our voices cry,
our anger mounts,
people who care,
that's what really counts,
instead of criticizing,
why don't you help,
we need support,
to free them from this hell,

[Chorus]
