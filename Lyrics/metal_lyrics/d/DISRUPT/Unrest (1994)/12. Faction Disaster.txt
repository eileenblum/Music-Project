Another movement - struggling to maintain
Senseless in-fighting - strengthens the strain

Factions hinder our dreams
So let's end them by all means
Learn to accept differences
And fight as a unified force

In a scene - where unity's achieved
Bigger problems solved - petty arguments relieved

Factions create divisions
