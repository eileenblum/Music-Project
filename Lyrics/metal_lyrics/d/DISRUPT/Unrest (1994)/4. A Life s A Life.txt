Countless creatures kept to die,
bash their brains to find out why,
electric shock includes stress void of results are these tests.
It hasn't helped us in the past,
so why do you make their suffering last,
of course it's 'cause you're getting-rich you don't care for life one bit,
we've beat disease by changing ourselves,
so take these cages off the shelves,
we only want them to be free,
a life's a life cant you see?
Test the limits of their mind,
it sheds no light on humankind,
the medical industry is a farce,
Here's where liberation starts.
Placebos to keep you content,
you know not where money's spent,
you find the labs which kill to cure but are they sure?
You cant be sure you didn't see what happens past those walls,
if you did,
you'd be appalled,
our bodies are not structured the same,
liberation our final aim...
uvisection is scientific fraud!!!
