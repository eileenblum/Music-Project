We've never claimed to be politically correct
Have you ever heard the term nobody's perfect
We do what we can to preserve the earth
No matter what you do, they estimate your worth

Fucking critics leave me alone

One false move the P.C. are there to tell
You want to seem better than everyone else
Have you nothing better to do than put people down
You're not helping matters, you're only making bounds
