Gallons of oil spilled into the seas
For constant advertising fallen trees
The atmosphere breached for senseless glamour
Careless bastards, with nature they tamper

What a waste
What a fuckin' waste

Cruelty practised for vanity's sake
Profit's from fashion, an image that's fake
A life's a life, why can't you see?
If only you'd end their misery

Our resources squandered for wealth and greed
Taken by the rich from those in need
Without conservation doomsday nears
As the ugly head of gluttony rears

What a waste
What a fuckin' waste
