Curse the serpent sire
It spoils beneath the mire
Six shades of green are seething
Corrupted by its breathing
Its breath is rife with disease
Black winds across the southeast
The blood sweating war beast

This hell of sucking earth and wounds
Where it feeds believers lie
The stench of burning mud and flesh
Where it wades the waters dry

This heat insalubriously dank
Where it breathes the air is taint
This beast, lord of halt and sick
Where it treads all is lost

Bane is wicked
Bane is wicked

Name it that loathes naming
Nine heads with eyes blazing
Kobold from the wind star
Plague that rules in Chtonia
Winding like the Mekong
Monsoon raining napalm
Skies were black for so long

This hell of sucking earth and wounds
Where it feeds believers lie
The stench of burning mud and flesh
Where it wades the waters dry

This heat insalubriously dank
Where it breathes the air is taint
This beast, lord of halt and sick
Where it treads all is lost

Bane is wicked
Bane is wicked

Bane is wicked, so wicked
Bane is wicked, so wicked
Bane is wicked, so wicked
Land is sick, so sick
Land is sick, so sick
Land is sick, so sick
Sky is black, so black
Sky is black, so black
Sky is black, so black

From the highland to the sea
Poison river flowing east
Trail of war follows beast
The lord is serpentine
From the highland to the sea
Poison river flowing east
Trail of war follows beast
The lord is serpentine

Bane is wicked, so wicked
Bane is wicked, so wicked
Bane is wicked, so wicked
Land is sick, so sick
Land is sick, so sick
Land is sick, so sick
Sky is black, so black
Sky is black, so black
Sky is black, so black

Bane is wicked, so wicked
Bane is wicked, so wicked
Bane is wicked, so wicked

From the highland to the sea
Poison river flowing east
Trail of war follows beast
The lord is serpentine
From the highland to the sea
Poison river flowing east
Trail of war follows beast
The lord is serpentine
