Shambling legion of fungi
Infecting, breeding, intensely
Hell winds, spreading black spores
Infiltrating feeble vessels
Slovenly, corrosive, shapeless
Flagellates, fouling, the earthly
Shuffling, hidden, in shadow
Shunning the sun completely
Hungering, lurking, waiting
Existing, solely to blaspheme

Denizes slithering forth from catacombs
Poison brethren
Moist lungs, tainted, intoxicated
Hemorrhaging with rust of ages
Unclean spectres, vehement
Thallophytes bent on ruin
Repellent, revolting fiends
Contaminated, heinous, horrific

Shambling, visitors, murderous
Intent to rule this planet
Insidious, secretions, languishing
Mindlessly seeding, defiling
Emerging, earth wide, on the mist
Impurity, infesting weaklings
Hideous, faceless, shadow less
Obscenity, putrid, division
Vulgar, sloughing, particles
Soil, filth of eons

Denizes slithering forth from catacombs
Poison brethren
Moist lungs, tainted, intoxicated
Hemorrhaging with rust of ages
Unclean spectres, vehement
Thallophytes bent on ruin
Repellent, revolting fiends
Contaminated, heinous, horrific

Watching, from sightless depths
Waiting, to infest
Grotesque, diseased mass
Suffocating, putrescence

Squirm
In excrement
Weak
Human flesh
Dreadful, malevolence
Ignorant, violent
Ancient, virulent
Conqueror, malignant

Squirm
In excrement
Weak
Human flesh

Sicken the blood of human
Sicken the blood of human
Sicken the blood of human
Sicken the blood of human
Sicken the blood of human
Sicken the blood of human
Sicken the blood of human
Sicken
