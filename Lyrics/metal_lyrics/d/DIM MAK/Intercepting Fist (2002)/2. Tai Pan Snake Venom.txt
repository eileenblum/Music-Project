Poison writhes
Insinuates, emancipates, demonstrates
All the weakest ways

Poison lies
Imitates, masquerades, demonstrates
All my weakest ways

Poison trees
To forget, can't forget

Forked tongue, elegance
Charm the weak, innocent
Sad, human, will less
Painless
Tai pan snake venom

Catch your death, bring it home
Waste the flesh, skin and bone
Die again, die alone
Morpheus
Tai pan snake venom

For his own
A warrior fights for his own
A warrior fights for his own
A warrior fights for his own, blood
His own
A warrior fights for his own
A warrior fights for his own
A warrior fights for his

Forsake the sun, wind and moon
Thicket of thorn, squalid room
Contaminate, blood ruin
Prisoner
Tai pan snake venom

Stricken, stained, turning grey
Puncture wounds, festering
Demoralized, feet of clay
Weakling
Tai pan snake venom

His own
A warrior fights for his own
A warrior fights for his own
A warrior fights for his own, blood
His own
A warrior fights for his own
A warrior fights for his own
A warrior fights for his

Poison tries
To forget, can't forget, demonstrates
All the weakest ways
