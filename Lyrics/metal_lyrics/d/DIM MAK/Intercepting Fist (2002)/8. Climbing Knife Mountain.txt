Soul, five spirits of the plague
Five lives and five lifetimes of pain
Soul, the sixth was spent in rage
Infamous and horrific in name
Soul, cut each and every time
Keen blades blooded by the climb
Soul, wounds mark a summit steep
Some scar forever too deep

Broken, never
Shaken, never
Weaken, never, never, never
Wanting, never
Sinking, never
Falling, never, never, never
Climbing Knife Mountain, surviving the test

Failure, never
Conquered, never
Vanquish, never, never, never
Weary, never
Pity, never
Mercy, never, never, never
Climbing Knife Mountain, surviving the test

Soul, escape the misery
Will the seventh ordeal set you free
Soul, with the sun upon your back
Let courage, not light, show the path
Soul, get out of shadows path
Ascending and righteous the kill
Soul, a warrior will soar
Bloody but just is the war

Broken, never
Shaken, never
Weaken, never, never, never
Wanting, never
Sinking, never
Falling, never, never, never
Climbing Knife Mountain, surviving the test

Climbing Knife Mountain, surviving the test

Soul, belligerent
Soul, the combatant
Soul, the karma spent
Soul, apocalypse

Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom

Soul, belligerent
Soul, the combatant
Soul, the karma spent
Soul, apocalypse

Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
Freedom, freedom
