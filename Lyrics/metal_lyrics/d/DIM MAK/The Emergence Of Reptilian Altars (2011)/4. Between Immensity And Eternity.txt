When the sun falls, woe until the world
A labyrinth of rolling thunder, Leviathan ascends
The gates fling open wide
From the depths of the ABSU....I command
Keeper of the primordial seal

I have found fear, between immensity and eternity
I have called upon the ancient ones
I have witnessed the perils of the forbidden realms
All this time, it has been fading away
Thou art one with prime evil things
From the blood of the ancient ones

When the sun falls, woe unto the world, for there is no sin
A labyrinth of rolling thunder, Leviathan ascends
From the depths of the ABSU....I command
Keeper of the primordial seal
Leviathan ascends
