They have sworn, to the point of death
Never shall it be revealed
Horned one of silence, remember
Knower of ways, remember
The secret of the tides of blood
From far beyond
From beyond the realm of the shells

Winged ones are stripped before me
Horned one of silence enters
Knower of the ways, remember
The shedding of blood shall adorn
The brow of the fallen one
There shall be no dawn for the breakers of the seal

And there comes a voice.......it is the dawn of the Aeon

Scaled ones before me
Horned one of silence confers
They have sworn to the point of death
The shedding of blood shall adorn
The brow of the fallen one
And there comes a voice.......it is the dawn of the Aeon

Heed this, slaves of the blind one, your Aeons of cursing have passed
Have passed away
