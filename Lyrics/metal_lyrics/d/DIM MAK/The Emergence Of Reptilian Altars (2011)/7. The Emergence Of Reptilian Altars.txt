Dark angel of the four wings, horned and rotting
Dead eyes bear no spark, no light
The pinnacle of DRACO
Shifting into reptilian form, the veils are lifting
The shadow kingdom revealed

I am the surrounding of the four
I am the sorrow which blackens hearts

The spaces open between the 3rd and 4th dimension
Fractions away, the interspace planes
Calculated in cold blood, the scaled beings return
With a cruelty that is fed, not weakened by tears

The emergence of reptilian altars

Blood born of black matter
Never will it reflect the light
Dark angel of the four wings, horned and rotting
Dead eyes bear no spark, no light
The pinnacle of DRACO shifts into form
The veils are lifting, the shadow kingdom revealed
