No cries or prayers can save you now
Strewn upon the altar, a carnival of carnage awaits
Destiny, lifeless and cold, drained of your life
A soul less piece of meat
Fully disassembled, chalices raised
Blood overflows, obscene excess
Vaulted into the dark recess of the void
Across the planes, the wanderers of the waste
The IGIGI feast on your flesh
In defiance of the holy ghost

The transformation begins
The thorns abruptly burn

No cries or prayers saved anyone
All strewn upon the altar, a carnival of carnage awaiting
Destiny, lifeless and cold, drained of your life
Soul less pieces of meat
Fully disassembled, chalices raised
Blood overflows, in obscene excess
Vaulted into the dark recess of the void
Across the planes, the wanderers of the waste
The IGIGI feast on your flesh
In defiance of the holy ghost

The transformation begins
The thorns abruptly burn

In this landscape formed of dismemberment
I administer the sacrament of pain
Their light has been plunged back deep within the abyss
Forced to wander the dark recess of the void

In defiance of the holy ghost
The transformation begins
The thorns abruptly burn
