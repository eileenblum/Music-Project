Alwass, the pact sealed, written and signed in blood
Angels, we will rip them to pieces
Bearing the mark of the beast,
Servant to the serpent lords
The high chiefs upon the thrones of blood

Now mercy fades away
And the most cunning
Most ferocious, most bloodthirsty
Thrice cursed shall set upon you
So it hath been ever, so it must ever be

Enter the kingdom of the grave
Where the countless fall, and soon they will all be dismantled
When all the light fades away, thrice cursed will be the believers
Into the lifeless depths of Oblivion, where all life fades away

And behold there is nothing for them but this desolation

Utter blackness, so it hath been ever
Born of blackness, so must it ever be
Utter blackness, so it hath been ever
Utter blackness

When all light fades away

Thrice cursed

Alwass, the pact sealed, written and signed in blood
Angels, we will rip them to pieces
Bearing the mark of the beast,
Servant to the serpent lords
The high chiefs upon the thrones of blood

Utter blackness, so it hath been ever
Born of blackness, so must it ever be
And behold there is nothing for them but this desolation
Utter blackness
