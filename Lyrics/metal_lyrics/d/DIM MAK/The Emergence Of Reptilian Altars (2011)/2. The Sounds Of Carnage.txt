One by one, we shall consecrate
Wings removed first, the implement follows
Ordain them all in suffering
Thousands writhing, the sounds of carnage
Heathens attack, breaching the walls of the Pearly gates
Unimaginable, legendary cruelty imposed
Witness the horrors strike
The Infernal resurrection

One by one, as we viciously desecrate
Blood-curdling screams of agony fill the air
Ordain them all in suffering
Thousands writhing, the sounds of carnage

A sea of lifeless litter born, destroyed the Pearly gates
Unimaginable, legendary cruelty imposed
Wings removed first, the impalement follows

The sounds of carnage
