I am before all things
The mighty and born less one
Limitless and unknowable
The all-containing, un-contained
Boundless extension, an indivisible point

A thing not composed of matter, I am before all things
The mighty and born less one
Limitless and unknowable

Born of the deep, not shadows but realities
Unfathomable the depths of the abyss
Beyond the five senses reach: KUTULU
