Drunk
With demons
Speaking
In tongues
Dancing
On pyres
With hell
In my thoughts
Fire
Turned water
Heaven
Turned hell
Drinking
And purging
Vomit
Away my life
Pathetic
Existence
Living
But no one

Pyre
Burning higher
Let the alcohol
Fuel the flame

Pyre
Burning higher
Burn my flesh
My flesh away

Pyre
Burning higher
Burn a drunkards
Sins away

Pyre
Burning higher
Let the ashes blow away

Dreams
Of liquor
Dousing my flesh

Set
On Fire
Silent
While I slept
Salvation
Conflagration
Cleansing
My disease
Damnation
For murder
For dying
While I lived

[Repeat 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th verse]

White fire purify, purify
White fire purify

The streets are my graveyard
The gutter is my tomb
My mind it grows weaker
There is nothing I can't lose
All my honor all my meaning
All my youth all my worth
Burn me bone to cinder
Release me
From this earth
