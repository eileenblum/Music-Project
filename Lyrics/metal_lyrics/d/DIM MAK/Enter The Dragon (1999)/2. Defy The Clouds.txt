Sky has fallen
And it's knocked me down
Clouds just crush me
Down to the ground
Cloaked in thick air
I can't be found
Clouds have sunk
They're like a shroud

I had no hope then
Can't help me up
The can was smoking
Can't help me up
The skin was broken
Can't help me up
No words were spoken
Can't help me up

Storm survivor
Defy the clouds
Pain may soak me
But I won't drown
Phenoix Rises
From bloodless ground

Cause I've fallen
I've fallen
I've fallen

Down
Fallen down
I fell down
Man I got back up

Sky has fallen
Phoenix rises
