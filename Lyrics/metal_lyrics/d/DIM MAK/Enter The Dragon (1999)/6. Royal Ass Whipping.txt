Same old stories
Same old lies
They complicate
Our simple lives
They undermine
They push our pride
We're not the kind
To let it slide
We're built like bombs
You light the fuse
Human nature
Will not refuse

Straight from the heart
Comes a royal ass whipping
Eye to eye
Toe to toe
Then it's done
Straight from the heart
Comes a royal ass whipping
Strike the flesh
With the bone
Damage done
Straight from the heart
Comes a royal ass whipping
Open wide
Deep inside
Violence sung
Straight from the heart
Comes a royal ass whipping
Code of rage
Heart of rage
Honor one

We use our fists
To communicate
Battle royale
Just escalates
A savage lurks
Beneath veneer
It lies in wait
Born of fear
We clench our fists
We grit our teeth
The well of violence
Is pure and deep
It will arise
It will command
Honor won
Honor lost
By the hand

[Repeat 2nd verse]

We can see no other way
When the blood runs to our face
When the blood gets in our eyes
When this anger makes us blind

Violence
It takes control
It takes control
It takes control
