Warchild
Womb of a whore child
Child of a crack vial
Born into a blackhole war

Born addict
Born with a habit
I didn't want it
This misery you've passed to me

Disgrace me
How much you hurt me
Then you blame me
For the sickness in your blood

Cracktorch
Watch my flesh scorch
Sell my life short
Cook it up, tear me down

You raised me with trouble
Raised me with pain
Raised me up twisted
But won't take no blame
I'm full of your evil
Even devils are made
I'm full of your evil

Hateful
You made me hateful
So I'm ungrateful
This is shit you taught me

Demean me
You didn't want me
You wouldn't free me
From this hell you built yourself

I got your problems
Your fucked up problems
But I can't solve them
I can't give them back to you

Not hoping
Never hoping
I am not hoping
For me to hope would be too much

[Repeat 5th verse]

I won't forgive but I will repay
All the damage caused to me
I won't forgive, I won't forgive

Won't forgive, and I won't forget
I won't forgive, and I won't regret
I won't forgive, I won't forget

And these paybacks for damages done [4x]

[Repeat verses 11 &amp; 12]
[Repeat verse 13]

Hateful
You made me hateful
So I'm ungrateful
This is shit you taught me well

Not hoping
Never hoping
I am not hoping
For me to hope would be too much
