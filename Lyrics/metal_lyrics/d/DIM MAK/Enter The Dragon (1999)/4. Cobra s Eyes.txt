Cold, so cold they can forget
All the violence beget in the name
Faithless, pure existence left
No soul was ever there to be saved

Cold like cobra's eyes
Cold like cobra's eyes

Clarity, purity of intent
Fear is just a weapon for the brave
Emotionless, frozen weapon set
Glacier slicing like a blade
Stoic in a bitter winter staved
Resolute, sentinel at the gate
Silently internalizing rage

Cold like cobra's eyes
Cold like cobra's eyes

Look into the cobra's eyes
A cobra's eyes
Look into a cobra's eyes

Purity
In a cobra's eyes
There is purity

Cold, so cold they can forget
All the violence beget in the name
Faithless, pure existence left
No soul was ever there to be saved
