The little dragon
Taught me well
How to find the strength inside
And how to use it well
The little dragon
Taught me well
How to focus and deliver
All my power held
Little dragon
Taught me well
How a dragon sometimes
Must whip it's tail

Dragon's will
Dragon's will
Dragon's spirit!
Dragon's will
Dragon's will
Dragon's spirit lives!

The little dragon
Taught to me
How to open up your eyes
And absorb all you see
The little dragon
Taught to me
Absorb all
Be aware of the periphery
The little dragon
Taught to me
How to make a circumstance
A possibility

[Repeat 2nd Verse]

Exploding forth from a dragon's will
Flowing forth from a dragon's will
Intensity born from a dragon's will
The Faijing born from a dragon's will

Dragon find it's pain
Dragon whips it's tail
Dragon spirit lives!

[Repeat 4th and 5th Verse]
