Straight up front and proper
I got no truck with you
I've got important knowledge
I must impart to you
I got a shot of anger
Pointed straight right at your face
You can gain respect
Or you could learn disgrace

I came to level the plane
Level the plane
I came to level the plane

Hell you know you're guilty
Your favorite of your sins
It leaves you feeling empty
Still you'll do it again
Don't cross a man who's righteous
It's thicker then the skin
Just like a ghost in heaven
Man they'll never let you in
Like an empty vampire
Looking for someone's blood
Cannot seduce
Man you killed the love

I came to level the plane
Level the plane
I came to level the plane

You've taken liberties with my trust
You kill the love in me
Can't kill my spirit thief
You've lost all measure of respect
You kill the love in me
Can't kill my spirit thief
You have my loathing and disgust
You kill the love in me
Can't kill my spirit thief
A shallow hole, a soulless husk
You kill the love in me
Can't kill my spirit thief
Blown away by so much dust
You kill the love in me
Can't kill my spirit thief

Kill
Kill my [2x]

Spirit
Spirit
Spirit
Spirit

Best you keep your distance cool
Play yourself a fool
A lion doesn't play with lambs
When they step across his land
A scrap or two
To make it through
And no love you seek
And no honor for a thief

If you can walk away, then walk away
If you can walk away, just walk away
If you can walk away, then walk away
If you can walk away, just fucking walk away
