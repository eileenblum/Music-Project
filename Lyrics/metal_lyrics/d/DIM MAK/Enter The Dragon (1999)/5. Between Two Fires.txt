How many times, have I been caught,
Between two fires
How many times, how many wars I've fought
Between two fires
How many times, how much my blood has cost
Between two fires

How many times, have I been taught
How many times, how many times
How many times, have I been burnt
How many times, how many times

How many times, I've walked unscathed
Between two fires
How many times, my flesh has payed
Between two fires
How many times, I've cried for war
Between two fires
How many times, strength in siege were born
Between two fires

[Repeat 2nd Verse]

My wounds justify me
My scars justify me

With a bombs conviction
To kill a generation
No excuse except I might hate them
There's no revelation, like devastation

I must take righteous action
Immortal satisfaction
Martyr of decimation
There's no revelation, like devastation

Between two fires that burn for war
Dry the blood of war
Lick the bones of war
The other side of fire is peace

The Sherman march of war
Scorch the loam of war
Parch the rivers with war
The other side of fire is peace

Raze the plane with war
Cleanse the earth with war
Blacken the skies of war
The other side of fire is peace

Beckon the beast of war
Apocalyptic war
Misanthropic war
The other side of fire is peace

[Repeat verses 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
