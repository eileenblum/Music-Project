I've lived and suffered
I've lived through pain
I've lived an angry life
Gas poured on flame

Flame burns within me
So I won't be played
I possess a faith in fire
That fire being faith in me

And my faith can burn you
And my faith burns strong
And my faith is only mine
So I feel I don't belong

Molotovs are flying
Shattering in my mind
Thought just fuels the fire

Burns away my time
So hot makes me blind
World around me dies

I've a soul that's tortured
Fir ekept me sane
Angry fire of resolve
No anger lost in vain

A fire pure and silent
A fire cloaked in ice
A fire worth one thousand words
A fire of my device

With the fire conviction
Of one soul alone
When the smoke finally clears
One conscious to atone

To me the earth is cinder
I remain the flame
Whoever dare comes close
Forever burned away

[Repeat verse 4 and 5]

I have contempt for this world
Angry fire in this world
I'll make a pyre of this world

Burning alone in this world
Burning alone in this world
Burning alone in this world

I have no heart for this world
No part of this world
No heart for this world

Burning alive in this world
Burning alive in this world
Burning alive in this world

I can survive I can dissent
I can survive I can dissent
I can survive I can dissent
I can rise I can burn it
