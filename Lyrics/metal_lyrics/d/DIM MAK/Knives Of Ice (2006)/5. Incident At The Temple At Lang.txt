A Most Cursed Expidition
Darkest Heart Of Asia Is Found
The Evil There Pervasive

We Met With Grotesque Natives
Led Upon A Treacherous Climb
To Find a Place Prime Evil

Ancient And Wicked People
On A Plateau Hidden From Time
They Built A Black Stone Temple

And They Want Me
With Skin As Gray
And Shark Like Teeth
All Worshipping
An Ancient Thing
That Sleeps And Dreams
A Portal To
A Calling Void
Of Nothingness
It Calls To Me
My Ancestry
In Blasphemed Depths

In That Most Horrid Temple
High Priest Guards The Portal At Leng
Creatures Spew From The portal

Webbed And Taloned Fingers
Bulging Eyes Elliptical
With Skin as Gray As shadow

They Are One With The Ancients
Tendering Threads Cold As The Deep

In Fitful Sleep
I See Myself
With Skin Like Theirs
Its Thick And Gray
And Coarse With Scales
And Slippery
And I breath
Effortlessly
In Darkened sea
I Now Perceive
That I belong
To Ancient Keeps

Lost In Asia, Never To Be Seen Again
Never, Never, Never To Be Seen Again
Last Seen China Never To Be Seen Again
Never, Never, Never To Be Seen Again
Northwest Province Never To Be Seen Again
Never, Never, Never To Be Seen Again
Through The Portal Never To Be Seen Again
Never, Never, Never To Be Seen Again

Ia, I Return To The Sea
Into Ebony Deep
Ia, To be One When It Dreams
A Batrachian League
Ia, Far From Weak Human Flesh
Down In Cold Ocean Depths
Ia, May The Anti-God Emerge
To Inherit The Earth

These Ancient Wicked People
On A Plateau Hidden From Time
They Built A Black Stone Temple

In That Most Horrid Temple
High Priest Guards The Portal At Leng
It Leads To Godless Chaos
