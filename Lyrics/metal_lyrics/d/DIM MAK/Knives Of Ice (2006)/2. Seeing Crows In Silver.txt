I'm Seeing Crows In Silver
Feathers Reflecting The Sun
They Have A Brilliant Murder
I'm Seeing Crows In Silver
Their Eyes Of Titanium
Their Gaze Is Sickening

They Radiate, Iniquity

I'm Seeing Crows In Silver
The Blinding Visions Of Death
They Have a Horrid Purpose
I'm Seeing Crows In Silver
Corrupting Pure Solar Rays
They Leave The Spectrum Poisoned

Shimmering, Twisting Things

The Haunting Scenes
The Sick Disease Sick Memories
The Days Blasphemed
The Silver Fields Of Butchery
The Sun In Dreams
The Incandescent Infamy
The Light Obscene
The Bright Electric Savagery

In Fields They Guild With Silver
In Their Insidious Way
They're Beacons Leading Me
In Fields They Guild With Silver
There's Carnage Off Of The Path
Bleeding And Glistening

Violent, Complicity
