At Connemara That Long Blackened Loch
The Beast Lost Its Spell To The Great Worm Of Hell
Ruined His Health Lost All His Wealth
His Insolence Quelled, By The Great Worm Of Hell
The Impertinent Fool, The Lesson Was Cruel
Cruel As Can Be Was The Great Worm Of Hell

Ancient Filth Of Godly Hate
He Is Nothing He Is All
Shed His Skin Contaminate
Spoil All With All His Waste
Feed The Roots That Stretch To Hell
Living On The Rot Of Flesh
With This Filth We Consummate
He Condemns He Liberates

This Larvae In Scope, Daring To Hope
To Descent And Tell Of The Great Worm Of Hell
Awakened By Words Spoken Unearned
Audacity Crushed By The Great Worm Of Hell
Infinity Roamed Slithering Old
Insulted Was He Was the Great Worm Of Hell
The Culvert Was Closed Stench Of Him Rose
So The Heavens Could Smell Of The Great Worm Of Hell

This One Did Not Finish His Spell
He Took it From Him For His Arrogance
The Fool Dreamed Of Ancient Summoning
Now He Rots With Him Below
He's Present Throughout The Mire And Filth
Flowing Through The Decaying earth
He Poisons All for their disrespect
And They Will Spoil With Him In the End

The Blackest Traits Of A Weakened Race
Swallowed Bt a Seething Entity
All The Death That He Absorbs
Swollen With The Evil Of Man
But He Belongs To The wicked mankind
The Communion Of Sinful Flesh
The Transgressions And Iniquities
And The Heart Of Waywardness

Filth Of All Time
Filth Of Continuum
Filth Of Mankind
Filth Of Eternity
