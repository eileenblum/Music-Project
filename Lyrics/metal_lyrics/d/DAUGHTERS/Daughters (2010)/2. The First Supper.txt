Captain John Boyd crawls out forkm under a mountain of death
with the warmth of blood running down his throat.
It tells our hero he's no different than a beast.
When a man sees another man as nothing more than meat.

All that blood finds it's way into a mans dreams.
Into his needs.

It's said that eating the flesh of a man will give the other that man's strength.
One can steal the soul by looking into the eyes when the teeth sink in.
"Turn from the gates of hell only to stare into the abyss."
You'd welcome death if you could find a noose that fits.
