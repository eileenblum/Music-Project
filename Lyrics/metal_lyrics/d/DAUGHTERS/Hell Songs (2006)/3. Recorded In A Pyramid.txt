I wear my sickness like a wedding band
I've been touching myself all day with a hammer and nail
I'm the flat-footed-mule-faced-fucker the shit-bird-derelict-king
I drew a portrait of how I think I'd look with my hands around my own throat

If you could see me now...
I have all the makings of a despicable man
All the qualifications of your best friends
"If that girl could see me now"
Fingers like a bookmark reaching into my chest and saving that empty page

If you could see me now...
I am just a face connected to an appetite demanding self abuse
I feed myself by the handful like your kids at a petting zoo
