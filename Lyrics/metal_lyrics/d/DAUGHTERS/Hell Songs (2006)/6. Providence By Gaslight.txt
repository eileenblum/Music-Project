That skinny frame
That tired act
She's uninteresting wearing all that black
Still she could be such a little girl sometimes
Whining and kicking
Throwing herself from moving vehicles

Running and running
Her raven breast empty and cold
Pushing my face up against the door
It's another night here in something city
It's another night with her going somewhere shitty

Into the cold city night she goes running and running
I wanna tell her "Little girl you run too far in the dark and you get yourself lost"
Then like a banshee she screams
And I say god damn

You may ask "She can't really be that stupid can she?"
