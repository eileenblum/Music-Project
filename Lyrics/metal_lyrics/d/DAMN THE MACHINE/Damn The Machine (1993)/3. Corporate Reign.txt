The best of times have gone
The memories carry on
The barriers invading
The prisoners are waiting

Among the simple minds
The emptiness will find
Home for the lonesome fortune
Home for the final warning

And we won't take it anymore
We are the leaders in the new world war
Once is never enough
In the eyes of solution...revolution!

Our message leads to the new way
We creep towards the fighting day
Now the corporate lie sends fools to fool and justify
We won't live in a world of corporate reign

The best of times have gone
My memories linger on
The barriers invading
The prisoners are waiting

And we won't take it anymore
We are the leaders in the new world war
Once is never enough
In time we take hatred home
We, we've got all we wanted
In the eyes of solution...revolution!

Our message leads to the new way
We creep towards the fighting day
Now the corporate lie sends fools to fool and justify
And we rebel in a world of corporate reign
