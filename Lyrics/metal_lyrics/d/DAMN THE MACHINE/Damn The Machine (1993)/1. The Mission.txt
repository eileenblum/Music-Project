Through these halls, a brand new invention calls
The reviews rave, the people we'll save, what a
weapon
We'll sell them fast now, we'll push them fast by
We'll bribe the E.P.A.
The owners sip to it, what a weapon

They'll breathe from my bottles, I put a patent on time
I'm blind to the world's decline

Freedom is paved
Freedom enjoy
Freedom is paved
We found a way

You got yours and you got mine
I'll fight you till the end of time
What did we mean to learn?
A page we should have never turned

Sad how science leads the way
Takes us to a darker age
Invention can't be done
This mission can be won

Science won't defeat my final word, my word

One of us will join the line
Takes us to a finer time
Invention can't be done

Wait, science won't defeat my final word
