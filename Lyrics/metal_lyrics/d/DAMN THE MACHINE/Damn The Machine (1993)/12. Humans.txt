And here we stand in the middle of doubt
The gods know well we cheated
United worlds will race their arms
The humans we will follow

In walks him with a grin of sin
To watch these crowds roar higher
To bend and break me of all will
The crowd was screaming for more

When the day turns to fear
The chaos will appear
May the final salvation be near
Let the hate pave the way
For the humans today
They will find you and break you down!

And here we sit in the middle of it
The gods know well we cheated
United worlds will race their arms
The humans, we will follow

And the day turns to fear
The chaos will appear
May the final salvation be near
Let the hate pave the way
For the humans today
They will find you and break you down!

When anger joins the race
With the human disgrace
May the final salvation be near

Let the hate pave the way
For the humans today
They will find you and break you down!
