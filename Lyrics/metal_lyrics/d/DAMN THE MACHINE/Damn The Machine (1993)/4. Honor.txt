Trust me with your freedom, bid man vs. man
Satisfy my deadly goals and hail my command
Fill you with lies and I'll kill who defies my honor
Fall to see me rise

Cast out to the quarantine to feel the future burn
You can take no more of me, a world soon to learn
Forget your beautiful savior today, I have come
To take your innocence away

And the madness will turn to the masses
In my eyes I see them die
A race of mechanical faces, of so wise
The eternal cry

Steal your forever and silence your endeavors
Take your world as you know, today I feed to grow
Deal to you power so giant you will vow to owe

And the madness will turn to the masses
In my eyes I see them die
A race of mechanical faces, of so wise
The eternal cry

Forget your beautiful savior today
I have come
Forget your beautiful savior today
I have come
