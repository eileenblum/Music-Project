Media paints a perfect view
Media sends their filtered truth
From far below the chosen parallel
Safely tucked away

Warfare to defend his empire
Defend murder for hire
Camera sighs, perverted eyes to the wall

I'm amazed at history's page
Writes me hollow, writes me off
Say save the people, freedom is choice
And call onto force

This is my only world
I can't let you bring me down
Yours is a lonely world
I can't let you beat me down

They'll follow the lonesome god
Leads them astray
They'll follow the mirrored world
The call of fame

Media paints a perfect view
Media sends their filtered truth
Camera sighs, perverted eyes, to crawl onto board

This is my only world
I can't let you bring me down
Yours is a lonely world
I can't let you beat me down

They'll follow the lonesome god
Leads them astray
They'll follow the mirrored world
The call of fame
They'll follow the lonesome god
Leads them astray...
