Ask me of reform
Ask me of home
Ask me as if I care
Tell you of chaos and morals of man
Tell you of a future plan
Ask me as warlords are breeding so well
Ask of me reason for change
Tell you to the edges of hope I roamed
Tell you it burns my eyes

Don't forsake my troubled times
We'll do just fine
My fellowmen can't wait to see the helpless in line

Don't forgive my dying race
We're in our place
Your judgmental face will never know
Until we are erased

I can't wait
I can't wait
A new fate
I can't wait
Can I trust a free world to care?

Ask me of chaos and good turned bad
Tell you the day we've had
Tell you of freedom and hope for the west
Until then we will not rest
My forefathers murdered, my followers will torture
And turn my empire mad
Can't see the outcome, good clouded by bad
Until then we'll do our best

Don't forgive my dying race
We're in our place
Your judgmental face will never know
Until we are, until we are erased

I can't wait
I can't wait
A new fate
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait for you now
