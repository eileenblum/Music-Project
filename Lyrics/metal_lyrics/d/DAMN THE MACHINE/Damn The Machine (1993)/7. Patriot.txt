I'm told, to ratify all that does not satisfy
Not sold, on public eye protest and they'll crucify me

Patriot, see the deepest wounds inflict
and predict the day
Savior, see the will of madness turn to banish all say

Change a world to embrace me
Follow me through anarchy
Change a future to face me
Follow me through anarchy

Unfold my promises see I sold tall nothing at all
My word, see it wither, I'm the winner,
for my take a patriot falls

Change a world to embrace me
Follow me through anarchy
Change a future to face me
Follow me through anarchy
Change, change
So follow me through anarchy
Change today for me
Follow me through anarchy
