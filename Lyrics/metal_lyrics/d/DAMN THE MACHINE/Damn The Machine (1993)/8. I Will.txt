Well who will control me
I will not fail

You best not do anything
You wait until my warning
Father you must believe me
I will

We do believe in you!

You best save your answers and
Save your prayers unholy
Father you must believe me
I will

As my new found world of
Independence crawls forward
I'm fool to follow so I lead
The world will beg me for more

And who will control me
I will not fail...

We do believe in you!
You and your dreams
Seems you'll never
See my way!
