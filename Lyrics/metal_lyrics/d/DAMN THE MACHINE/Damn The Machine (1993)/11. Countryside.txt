Death dance through no man's land,
today I face the trial
Last chance to make demands, today I face Belial
Innocence was hard to find,
my victims are sick in the mind
My grievance is not understood,
I profit in a trade for blood

Spreading far and wide, through the countryside
We are the people, we are angry

And so the white man came,
now we are the people in chains
For the profit our future waits on the will

So raise one more atomic tower
You know the people here will cower
So rape, destroy another world
My child will pay

Spreading far and wide, through the countryside
While the people, our people, wait on the will

Raise one more atomic tower
You know, people here will not cower
We aim, destroy your profit world
My child won't pay

Rush of it all is the burn on my face when
People disintegrated before me
Take to the seas in a war for my cash
I need one more reason to put you to rest
