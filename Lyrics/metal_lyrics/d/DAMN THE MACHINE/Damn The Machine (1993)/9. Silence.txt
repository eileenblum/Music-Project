Falling time's wasting away
I'm a long, long way from this castle I'm chasing
It's a mixed up world I'm in
So I'm calling on the gods to let me win

Far away father he listens
To what I say, to the truth he has given
Cannot wait till this journey ends
Hear me calling the gods to let me in

Can there be more to
This war?
Suspended in time
Forever more

Can there be more to
This war?
Suspended in time

Forever more

Forever more
