Cries for freedom
In a world of greed
A world in need

Taste my reasons
In the hate filled air
Fate wields no care, wields no care

We walk in the damage of mankind

To leaders, I warn of my charge
I threaten you...

We walk in the damage of mankind

Come and ride now, find now, that we can matter
Act now, look now, your freedom is shattered
Take now, burn now, we'll tear down the cities
On with the dream

Back to day one

Tell me Jesus
Tell me honestly
Man to man

Tell me readers
Tell me like it is
No charade, no parade

We walk in the damage of mankind

Come and ride now, find now, that we can matter
Act now, look now, your freedom is shattered
Take now, burn now, we'll tear down the cities
On with the dream...
