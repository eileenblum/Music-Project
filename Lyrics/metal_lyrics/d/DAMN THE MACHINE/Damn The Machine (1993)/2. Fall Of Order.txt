Most of all I fear the fall of order
Wealth and white man came, catastrophe again
Most of all I'll cry for the losing race
Madness joins the chase, the humans live disgrace
Down in the absence of law

Worst of all I'll see through the eyes of fate
And see no clear escape, the trial far too late
For the criminals of hate

See the world awaits a clearer sky...
And the promises will die
The elders lie...

History must change by work of the young
See the damage done, the lesser days have come
Knowledge of a future lying helpless
Who is to protect us? Time begins to rust
In the silent absence of law

See the world awaits a clearer sky...
And the promises will die
The elders lie and lie and lie...

Most of all I fear the fall of order
