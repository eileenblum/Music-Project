Under the starlight skies
I watch her snow white face
On sleeping leaves my angel's tears
shine light that's quiet and cold

In beautiful darkness
birds of death sing in the end

All these memories will be lost
all these dreams forever gone
Shadows dance in the quiet mist
What lies beyond the darkness...

In beautiful darkness
birds of death sing in the end
Beneath the starry skies
forever sleeps the angel soul

You drowned with Sun
You broke my heart
