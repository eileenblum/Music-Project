Into the night we drown with Sun
The blaze of light is dying down
There are no birds to sing our songs

Sleep with me, see a dream
In this darkness we may stay
far away from this world
These are silent goodbyes

Into the night I drown with Sun
Deep in the shades, fallen from light
I close my eyes to see you near...
