They told me lies:
there'll be no Eden nights
and thousand stars
will sleep in emptiness

I once believed
in words of human world
but they can not guide me,
not anymore

When life is gone and all is dead
you can not see me one last time
Where light will fade and time has come
this darkness takes the place of life

When time has come
this light will fade away
My thoughts are dark,
my dreams will die away

There is no light
in my shattered life
I leave this ground
in silence...
