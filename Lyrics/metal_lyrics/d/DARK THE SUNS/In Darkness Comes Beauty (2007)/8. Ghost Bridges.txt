Those bridges lay in the quiet mist
above the river between two worlds
Stream of memories and dying hopes
flows through the dark

Black towers are killing all the light
and hollow souls roam in the shades
In silence they will dwell
without faith

I buried pain into my heart
In silence I dwell
I'm one of them

I'd never say it's not a dream
timeless moment of everlasting grief
In silence they will dwell
buried by autumn leaves

Tears keep falling like rain
falling like rain to the leaves,
like frozen leaves to the ground,
and darkness into these hearts
