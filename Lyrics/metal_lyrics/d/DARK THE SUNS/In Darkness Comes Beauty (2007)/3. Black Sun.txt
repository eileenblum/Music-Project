I take a step towards dead end
my life is black when Sun descends
This darkness leads me for tonight
place where's silent, where there's no cry

I don't want to lose this all
all for one and one for life
Where angels take a restless soul
and give life for the final time

In darkness and the Sun
restless soul has found a place
where it will belong

Don't you see you have crushed this all
I do not want to take the forever fall
Why can't you see what I want
you can not lead my way

Watching through a mirror my life
I can not find myself tonight
the black Sun is on the ground
it leads me place where darkness kills the light
