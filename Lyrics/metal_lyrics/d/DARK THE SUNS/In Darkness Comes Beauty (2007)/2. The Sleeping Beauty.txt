I cannot close my eyes
I', watching sleeping beauty
the world without the fear,
the world without the pain

Tonight there are no tears, no cry
tonight there are no painted smiles
Tonight...

There is a ghost on the sun
when night has fallen on the ground
angels are dancing on the sky
I'm watching sleeping beauty

Tonight your voice is calling again
Everything is so perfect, you are here tonight
I buried you deep in my heart
and now our fate becomes one
