All is so quiet when darkness will fall
In this beauty the world seems to sleep

The sleepless angels, they sing their songs
The songs of sorrow, like birds in the end

In the sleepless nights
Everything's forever lost
Beneath the thousands stars
I don't want to be alone

I'm still awake, listening the night
Don't want to be, no more alone
The sleepless angels, I hear them sing
The songs of grief, the songs of the end
