In starless night crowned with black
There are no words to make all undone
We're the dreamers in frozen rain
Forever lost when love grew cold

I grieve in darkness
All ends in silence

The silent farewell with silent cry
We saw the dreams in sleepless night
Till the white light of final dawn
Our lives are fading from this world
