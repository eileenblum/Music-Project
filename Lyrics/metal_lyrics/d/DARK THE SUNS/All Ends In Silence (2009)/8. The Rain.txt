In this death scenes within my thoughts
Black dawn is breaking so deadly cold
I roam alone these empty streets
In silent rain, frozen inside

This mourning rain can't wash away these tears
Beneath the dead cold sun
This silent rain can't hide away these tears
Beneath the dead cold sun

In these death scenes within my heart
My world has turned to shades of grey
You draw these black marks, you made these scars
My memories are stained with grief
