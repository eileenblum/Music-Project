Dead sun shines upon the world
Through the darkest veil of sorrow
Black rays of light kill the hope
That once was here in our hearts
I stay here, so you may escape
From this darkened world

These chains won't set me free
These chains keep me here

In this world darkness blooms with grief
Kills me once again
Night by night black flames of light
Break me inside

Black crows soar upon the ground
They are silent like a sleeping night
In black landscape fragile

As my world within
When this silence unbroken
Is tearing me apart
