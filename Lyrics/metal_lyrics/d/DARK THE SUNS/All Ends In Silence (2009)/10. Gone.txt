Winter came and roses died
Faded away before my eyes
Like a lovely child
I'm still here, all alone

You saw an angel in this dying universe
Searching for solace in her dreams
When everything is gone
You saw an angel in this dying universe
Crying for hope forever lost
When everything is gone

With your broken wings
You will cover me
In the ice cold embrace
I'll lay down and sleep

When this pain exists no more
And silent night hides these scars
Let the wind sing to rest
The lonely soul with fading dreams
