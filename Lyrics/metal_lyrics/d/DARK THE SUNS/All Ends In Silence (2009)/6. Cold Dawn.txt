In morning shades I'm all alone
This loneliness is all you left
I saw you in my dream
Your eyes were darkened with grief
I tried to hold you
Your hand was cold as snow

Among the chaos
You are an angel behind the stars
Among the chaos
You are a fragile ghost in my arms

The grey light in quiet dawn
Won't brighten for me anymore
I saw you in my dream
The ground was covered by leaves
I tried to reach you
You were like an angel in the rain
