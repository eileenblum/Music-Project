In this world silent rain falls
All is cold, you can't save me

The black wings of grief
Are carrying me
Walk with me through the dark
Towards the morning sun

No way out
Nowhere to hide
I drown in fear
You can't save me

The black wings of grief
In darkness so deep
Walk with me through the dark
Towards the morning sun

In the end, morning came
And hid these tears
In the end, morning came
And broke these chains
