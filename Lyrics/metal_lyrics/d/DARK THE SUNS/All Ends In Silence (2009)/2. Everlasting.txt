In the starless night the everlasting song of grief
Is haunting my soul, is haunting me in echoes
In the end all is cold like november sun
In the end all is cold with everlasting grief

In the sleepless night the neverending sight of loss
Is breaking my soul, is haunting me in echoes
In this world, dead inside
I'm still here all alone
