In silence we dwell
Beneath the veil of winter
On this freezing ground
Buried by waves of snow

In cold lifeless light, in northern night
We'll lay down and sleep under the wings

We are still here, rimed with frost
There won't be dawn, no dawn for us

You were my angel
In this quiet world
Now we are buried down
By the snow that keeps on falling
