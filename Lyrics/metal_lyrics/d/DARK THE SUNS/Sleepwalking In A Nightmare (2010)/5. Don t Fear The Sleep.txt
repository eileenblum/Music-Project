You hold my hand in the end of the time and I hear you singing in eternal night
"Let the world become our kingdom where the darkness kills the light."
The world is weeping in forever rain and I hear you whisper don't fear the sin.
We fall into blind world in these haunted shores.

From your heart banish fear when night entwines the shadows around your heart.

Don't fear the sleep
In the end of the time two souls entwined
Sleepwalkers in a nightmare forever drowned in sin
Don't fear the sleep
In the end of the time it's our kingdom gone
Sleepwalkers in a nightmare forever lost they are

I look in your eyes in the end of the time.
Cold tears fall down like the angel's cry.
Shall the night become our everdream where the shadows embrace the light.
The world has turned into black and I feel your touch forever cold.
We fell into blind world and there shall we dwell
