In nightfall world is cold and drown in grief.
I fear to close my eyes and fall asleep.
Darkness keeps on haunting in my dreams
in dreams that become darker night by night...

Slow waves of sleep are carrying me...

In my dreams I follow you.
In my dreams I follow you.
You are like a ghost in these darkened rooms,
in these darkened rooms of sleep.

Darkness deepens
In my dreams
Night by night
Devoid of the Sun

The rain has kept on falling in my dreams walk beside me in these rooms.
Stay with me in weak candle light...
Darkness keeps on haunting in my dreams.

Black waves of dreams are breaking me.

In my dreams I follow you.
In my dreams I follow you.
You are like a ghost in these darkened rooms,
in these darkened rooms of sleep.

Darkness deepens
In my dreams
Night by night
Devoid of the Sun
Behold the world so fragile
Behold devoid of the Sun
