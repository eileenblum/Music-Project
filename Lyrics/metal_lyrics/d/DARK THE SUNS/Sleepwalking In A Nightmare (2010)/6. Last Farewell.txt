My time has come.
I know it will be my end.
I feel how light will fade away this day.

I know my path is walked through, no another wrong cross to turn.

Free my hand
Close my eyes
Drain your tears
And let me go
Do not cry or loose your hope
Drain your tears
And let me go

Light has fade flowing away...
now it's my time, my time to sleep.
