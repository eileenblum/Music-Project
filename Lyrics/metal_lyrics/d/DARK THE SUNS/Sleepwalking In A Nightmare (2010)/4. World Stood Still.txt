The time is stopped.
It's midnight again.
No sleep, no safe place.
No face for ignored looking for a thrill in the world standing thrill,
in the world that writes my will...
In the world that bring us down on our kness...
On our kness on the ground and crying.
I do remember us trying to find the reasons.

Hereafter...
The world stood still
There is no greater sorrow
Hereafter...
When angels cry
In a night the world stood still

The world stays still.
It's raining again...
No sleep, no safe place.
No hope for sleepless looking for a thrill in the world stading still,
in the world that wrote my will,
in the world that brought us down
on our kness...
On our kness on the ground and crying.
I do remember us trying to find the reasons.
