The chains around your heart tied as tight as the bonds around my arms.
You dare to laugh at me, even if you want to be like me.
Unfortunately this seat is taken.
The deepest circle is mine
Love is like the chain, a plague written: "so divine."
Unfortunately this seat is taken.
The deepest circles is mine.
Take the first steps and I follow.
I'm ready to risk everything to have some more.
After all this ends in the grave, so shallow.
I will follow you, "hollow", to have some more.

Could you be my savior or guide for me into the blind world?
This kingdom of night ins mine while keeping me alive
My savior, my guide, my life
In the blind world
I will follow you into the blind world

The chains around my heart tied as tight as the bonds around your arms.
I dare to laugh at you now, we said the vows, we've said everything we need to say.
On the edge, I will go and you will stay...
On the edge, I will go and you will stay...
'cause we've said everything we need to say.
