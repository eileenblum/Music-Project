In that eve rain fell like night and grave clouds carried the storm.
Black skies were crying so loud as the wraiths of dark were born.
When night descends we drown in fear.

Drowned by our sins
Wounded by broken dreams
Blinded by hope we were
This is the end of all

We all shuddered as the wreaths of sea mist swept by touching our hands.
We were swept away by the storm, sinking in black waters.
Dark waters flooded on the shores dark waves rose in fury.

World saw it's end.
We drown in fear...

Drowned by our sins
Wounded by broken dreams
Blinded by hope we were
This is the end of all

'till the sea was devouring all earth and there was nothing,
nothing left to hold

When the storm was over everything was suddenly still as death.
Silence lays upon the weeping earth.
We've drowned with our borken dreams.
