Somewhere down the line
Man created god in his image
Inadequacy on a pedestal
A basin for a lake of tears to drown in

And here we go again
Where there's blood there's hirudineans
Crawling from every hole, blotting blindly
A brainless mob on the prowl

Sycophants cough their amen
Follow the light at the end of the auricle
Egos inflate as the bugs migrate
Every blurp a revelation, an oracle

Fall, fall, fall, like flies from the heavens
The leeches slide from their slippy throne
Suck, suck, suck, till we drown in their muck
Still quetching away, splitting heads with their drone

I will not waste my time
I will not waste my anger
Trying to find the head on a worm
With a rectum on either end

A lie in a frame is still a profanity
A ghoul with a crown can never be king
Even crap will succumb to vanity
its own stench the measure of all things

Fall, fall, fall, like drunks from a tight rope
Nothing but a skidmark in history
Suck, suck, suck, empty heads run amok
Choking on self-digesting misery

Eyes will open
Only when the ass starts burning
Atrophied tentacles start groping
Always loping, never learning

Deeper and deeper
Into the swamp you sing with every word
To rot on its bottom
Until the stink heralds the next outpour of turds
