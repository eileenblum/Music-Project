A specter writhes
Too faint for mortal eyes
A mere ululation

A deathless witness
Lurid in demise
Spawned from pain and tribulation

Unsound
Undead

Evanescing
An orphaned want, marooned
In disembodied mayhem, howling

Just a shadow
Waning with the moon
Ever yearning, ever prowling

Doomed to linger, a wraith in a withered world
You will never sleep again
Lifeless eyes, forever haunted by the void
Gage upon the tomb of man

Cold and dried up
The ravaged plains lie dead
Buried ruins sing of the end

Faces fade away
Frozen in convulsion
In broken temples, gods quietly die

And gales roam unrestrained
Lick the horror from revulsion
Beneath the weeping scars in the sky
