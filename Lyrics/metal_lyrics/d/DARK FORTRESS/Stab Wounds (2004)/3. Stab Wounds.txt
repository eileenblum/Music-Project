All the pain I felt in "life"
Shall now be yours until your soul is torn apart
All the despair I had to bear
Shall now melt within your mendacious heart

With my final breath I curse your feeble flesh
To "life" eternal in a joyless labyrinth
Thousands of years of pain for you,
Every single heartbeat a stab wound within your soul

I am the witness of your fall,
I am the stab wound within your soul
I am the storm within the cold
I am the stab wound within your soul
I am distress, when you crawl
I am the stab wound within your soul

No benediction, no release
No remorse... this scars shall never heal!

... And wherever you may be, wherever you may go,
My hatred will follow
