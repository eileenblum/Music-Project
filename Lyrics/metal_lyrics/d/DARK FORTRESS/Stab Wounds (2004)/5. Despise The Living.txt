Nightmare, oh precious nightmare,
Be my guest, my only friend
In times of despair

Whilst "life" passes by,
Life that never were

Time heals wounds,
But I cannot forget
Time heals wounds,
But I cannot forgive

The gallows call for you,
The gallows call for me,
Can't you see the end is near?

Nightmare, oh glorious nightmare
Tell me within my dreams undreamt
If this is the life they all speak of?

"Unicus impulsus
Animi mei est
Mortem obire
Mihi mortem conscisco
At tamen tum
Demum vivetum"

Infamous hope,
Monolith of a dying race
I caluminate humanity
With delight

Pestilence, come forth to judge
Come forth and erase this final remembrance
