Hours get lost, every shadow
A fragment of the past
A scenario of the dead
In grievance for the hours we shared

Curse me, take my breath away
Life disgusts me
Touch me, take my "life" away
Life disgusts me

Years got lost, every single moment
A fragment of demise
For the bleak seasons never change
Within this desolating overture

Curse me, take my breath away
Life disgusts me
Touch me, take my "life" away
Life disgusts me

Life got lost, all hope forsaken
Again the shadows lead my way
To a distant place... to another day

Why?
