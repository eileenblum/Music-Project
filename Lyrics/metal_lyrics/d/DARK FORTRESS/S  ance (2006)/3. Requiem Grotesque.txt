"De profundis clamavi ad te domine
Domine ex ordi vocem meam
Tianc auris ture e intendentis
In vocem deprecationes meae
Requiem aeternam dona eis domine
Et lux perpetua luceat deis
Requiescant in pace"

Grotesque visions of paradise
Death bells chime for my soul's demise
Sharing eternity with the parasites
All alone with my cries
Embedded in silk my corpse,
Enshrouded in silence my soul...
Is this your god's paradise?!
Thought death may heal the wounds
But nothing can ease the pain
As I linger in my casket
Dreaming of death's domain...
