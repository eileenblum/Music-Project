The innocent skies torn asunder
Again the clock strikes 12
Opened the channel to your mind
I am the voice of egoism
The icon of arrogance
It's the devil inside of me
Celestial apostasy
I am the one fallen from grace
Unleash sadistic retribution
Reminiscence of cvhaos now revealed
A spiritual vacuum can't be broken
But an angstridden soul can be dejected
Until there's nothing left of it
Every night a part of you is dying
Paranormal obsession... this is the art of taking lives
Every night your soul is crying
Paranormal oppression... this it the way of sardonic tyranny
