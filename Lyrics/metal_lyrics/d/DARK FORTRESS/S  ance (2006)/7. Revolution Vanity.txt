Submissions of the 4th dimension machinery
Key to my soul's tranquility
Archetype of my ascendancy
Relinquish evanescent structures of humanity
Shapeless, into a darkened spiral I fade
The ignorance of man my masquerade
Metamorphosis of a stillborn creation
Opened wide my soul for spiritual illumination
Flesh, the quintessence of vanity
Spirit, the ultimate evolution of sanity
I am the secret, isolated in worlds beyond
I am the horror, the art of demand
