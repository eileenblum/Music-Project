I drown...
For too long I felt the winter's breath
The rain keeps falling down into my soul
Thorns cover my grave... they hurt within me
I wonder how death shall be eternal sleep
When I cannot close my eyes
I wonder how death shall ever set me free
When there's even in this darkness no place for us to be
Wish I could kill myself again
The spectral lights would fade away
And I...
A thousand voices in my mind
A thousand empty faces starring at me
A thousand lies I can't forget
And one single life.
A thousand lies I can't forget,
And one single life I do regret.

The only thing left of me... an aura cold and blue.
As the banshees embrace me,
Embrace me with a sigh.
I do regret.

I am gone...
The autumn's song is guiding me
With the sound of the weeping rain I fall asleep
And the thorns, that cover my grave? They hurt no more

I wonder how death shall be eternal sleep
When I cannot close my eyes
I wonder how death shall ever set me free
When there's even in this darkness no place for us to be.

The only thing left of me... an aura cold and blue.
As the banshees embrace me,
Embrace me with a sigh.
