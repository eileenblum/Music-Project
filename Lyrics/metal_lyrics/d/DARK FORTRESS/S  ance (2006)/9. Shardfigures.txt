All my life I searched for thee
To make me feel complete
But only bitterness spoke to me
In a language I had to learn throughout the years
All my life I was wandering through the dark
Without any spark of hope
Never knew, where I belonged
Weary of life and jaded
It was just too late to turn around
All my life I felt alone
No matter where I've gone
There's never a place for someone else
In the portrait of a lifeless soul
All my life I searched for death
To make me feel alive
Now as he came for me
I've realized, that I was just too blind too see
In the I search again for thee
To erase this painfully memory
These words of disconsolation
For they shall be my legacy
