Forgotten, the poisoned words of love
Tempted by the chalice of dissolution
Invoking the spirits of unholy origin
A flow of orgasmic fire dwells within me
Chaos is my prophecy

Never to be lost again in this
soul-consuming dimensions
Venomous emotions of love faded away
The enigma of death I've solved
For my salvation is your damnation

Can you see my shadow in the flickering
candlelight?
A shadow that offers you insight into
Uziel's visions
Can you feel the presence of woeful souls
in this moonlight night?
Somnambulists amongst a deceptive race

I've seen the truth
Desecration was the key that opened my eyes
I am your inner tyrant
Endless scorn is my revenge
Chaos, my prophecy - Asphyx is thy forseen fall
Asphyx is me
