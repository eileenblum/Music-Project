Pilgrim of the nightly spheres
Behind the sleeping cascades
You wander restlessly
In hope of finding the gateway - to eternity
Darkness your constant companion

When the ancients spoke of a realm
- a realm where nothing dies,
but yet all is dead
your visions where so clear,
but yet captured in a dying world.

Pilgrim of the nightly spheres,
child of sin, child of the dark,
yours is the monument of scorn
for you've left the trail of weakness
just to find loneliness

"...will you ever find the gateway,
will you ever reach the gateway,
the gateway to eternity
- to eternal life..."

Pilgrim of the nightly spheres
I know one night your star will ablaze
in the nocturnal horizon
to show me your traces in the dark
