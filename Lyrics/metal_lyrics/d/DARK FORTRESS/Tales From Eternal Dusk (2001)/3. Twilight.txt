Embraced by solitude I leave this world
As the last tear of blood leaves my veins,
I long for harmony
For the last time I look up to the night sky
And watch the stars in a black wind dying
For the last time I watch the fading
of the candlelight

... and I whisper my final breath into
Eternity knowing that all life ends someday

Oh, may the autumnal winds carry my empty soul
Into the vale of oblivion
Where I shall forever wander over
The fields of melancholy
To be a solitary shadow out of time

"Oh please let me long for silence, let
me walk the path of sin, but your
weepings - full of grievance.
Oh, please take my hand and follow me into
the night, just follow me to a place, where
darkness shines so bright."
