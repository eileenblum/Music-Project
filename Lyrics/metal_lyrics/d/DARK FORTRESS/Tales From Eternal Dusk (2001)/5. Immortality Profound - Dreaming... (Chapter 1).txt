Close your eyes and follow me to a land beyond the gates of agonizing dreams.
Ride with me upon hills of martyred souls, where once blood was spilled for the one, the master ring, created in the flames of Amon Amarth.

"One Ring To Rule Them All, One Ring To Find Them,
One Ring To Bring Them All, And In The Darkness Bind Them."

Feel the agic of the winds of wrath and walk with me on the blackened paths through Thaur-nu-fuin.
Enter this world beyond all human dimensions and close the gate of life forever
to unveil the secrets of this long forgotten tale of ancient glory.
A tale that seemed to be lost in the hidden shadows of Mordor...
