Mournful shadows rise,
dusk spreads her wings
- the tomb world longs for me
I kiss the withered rose
I still hold the flame that dies
I drink the wine of bitterness
for the last nocturnal caress

Night falls again - I feel the pouring rain
Melancholy - soon I will leave this void
called life
Solitude - as I fell the blade of my knife
Death - I adore thy precious art
I open my veins
a last tear freezes my skin

The dark surrounds me within
a veil to oblivion
I entrust my spirit into death's
merciless arms
And another void awaits me

Utopia is lost
