"From the kingdom of damnation we arise..."
As the apocalyptic dragon flies over the land
misery returns - set the world in flames

Thunder and lightning gather in the
nocturnal sky,
the stench of corpses fills the night -
we're the devil's scythe

We arise in a sea of fire, holocaust -
our only desire.
We the tyrants of doom,
the infernal spawn,
the prayers for luciferian dawn.
We bring you pestilence and pain
In the dark lord's name we shall reign!

As the apocalyptic dragon flies over the land
misery returns - set the world in flames
Christianity bleeds - forevermore!!
