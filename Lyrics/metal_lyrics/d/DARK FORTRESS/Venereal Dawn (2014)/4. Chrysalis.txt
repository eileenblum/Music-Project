Every day it seeps a little deeper
I have it in me now
I carry your mark and your curse
Heartrot creeps
Withers tainted sleepers
I know every day it gets a little worse

A little worse

From without, the torrent's fierce erosion
The undertow scouring from within
Hollow rapture spreads like corrosion
Mouldering me under my skin

My skin

Veins writhe
Bones tremble
Am I dead already
Or only excarnating

Gravid pulse
Something wants to waken
I wilt and wane
Into a membrane thinned
Between debauch leeching the taken
And septic rain
This day's poisoned twins

Twins

Mind bends
Breaks, disassembles
A chrysalis incubating
Cast away, barely alive

Mind bends
Breaks, disassembles
A chrysalis incubating
Cast away, barely alive
