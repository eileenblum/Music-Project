Dripping holes in turbid ether
And a dozen hovering throats
Join - turn - focus - speak as one:

My name breaks mountains
My plural is war
My form your undoing
My children your doom

Your mind is my vessel
Your angels my whores
Your nightmare my soul
Your body my womb

My seed is your cancer
Your thirst is my delight

I'm freed to exceed
A thousand young drip from the sky to feed
Bleed spectral seeds
From heaven have the lloigor come to breed

I've come to breed

My milk is your poison
My cradle your grave
My flesh your disease
Your passing my birth

Your fear is my nurture
Your masters my slaves
Your prayers my deceit
Your terror my mirth

Your madness my playground
I laugh at your plight

I'm freed to exceed
A thousand young drip from the sky to feed
Bleed spectral seeds
From heaven have the lloigor come to breed

I feed on your frailty
Your grief is my door
Your oblivion fells you

My gaze tears the welkin
My psalms rot your core
My shadow compels you

My coming destroys you

I'm freed to exceed
A thousand young drip from the sky to feed
Bleed spectral seeds
From heaven have the lloigor come to breed

Mirages howl and hover
Above the searing bog
The guts of earth encovered
Icicles on boiling fog

Into the fouling nether
The bane creeps breath by breath
Radiant whips constrict like tether
Forests blister, twined in death

Living light
Blasphemy in the atmosphere
Living light

Living light
Blasphemy in the atmosphere
Living light
