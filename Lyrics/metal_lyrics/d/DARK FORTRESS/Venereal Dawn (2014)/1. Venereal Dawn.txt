I woke at first cold wisp of dawn
To frightened mourners' quiet lament
From brooding death into rock withdrawn,
To see upon my hand descend

A giant moth with burning wings
And a face like the god of fever
From tortured lands a whisper brings
To further grieve the unbeliever,

Then fast decays to liquid rot
Wherein one insane eye still reels
Towards horizons misbegot
In lurking ill beyond the veil

The glow of monstrous fetid light
Begins to seep into the world
Flee to the last few specks of night
Ere cursed sun his plague unfurls

It is too late
Here comes the dawn

Goddess of love, morning star
Oh how you have betrayed us all
Beneath your beauty, ghostly, far,
Boils pestilence, and horrors crawl

A wretched huddle by the cave
We watch our planet rolling slowly
Towards the festering unholy
Abyss of light that is our grave

Focul tÄu (Your fire)
Nu ne mai Ã®ncÄlzeÈte (No longer warms us)
Distrugerea ta (Your perdition)
Peste noi din cer (Upon us from the sky)

Fleshless tendrils rake the air
Where once sweet pastures bloomed in peace
Sickening rays in malice flair
What once gave life now broods disease

Blind and lost we perish, shattered
Earth lies battered
Sidereal venom spreads

Venereal dawn
Defiles all living matter
Erupts supernal atter

Ethereal, venereal dawn
With putrid fists corrupts and twists
Pandemic glow subdues the world
Ruthless, imperial, venereal dawn

Trees once kissed to majesty
By soothing stellar bliss
Now scream in silent anguish
As they're wrenched towards the sky

Infested roots seek waning
Darkness as they die
Choking in the cankerous air,
Now a smouldering abyss

Focul tÄu (Your fire)
Nu ne mai Ã®ncÄlzeÈte (No longer warms us)
Distrugerea ta (Your perdition)
Peste noi din cer (Upon us from the sky)

Abominations stalk the land
Sublimed from void and spite
Vestigial grace's venal hand
Failing beast and man alike

The foul sun rising
Daybreak begets
On the horizon
A silhouette

A man-like shape
Comes at us, writhing
Snakes 'neath burnt skin
Seething eyes, mouths agape

On fevered wings he is upon us
From his gorge retches a flood
To drench us as he grabs us, one by one,
In putrefying stolen blood

Venereal dawn
Defiles all living matter
Erupts supernal atter

Ethereal, venereal dawn
With putrid fists corrupts and twists
Pandemic glow subdues the world
Ruthless, imperial

Under necrotic cells, with plasma stained
The sun's disease cannot touch me
I faint as I'm dragged across mangled plains

SÃ¢nge sÄ fi cu noi (Blood be with us)
SÃ¢nge cuprinde-ne (Blood embrace us)
SÃ¢nge ne va salva (Blood will save us)
Unul dupÄ altul (One by one)

SÃ¢nge peste noi (Blood upon us)
SÃ¢nge ne va proteja (Blood will guard us)
SÃ¢nge ne va salva (Blood will save us)
De soare (From the sun)

SÃ¢nge sÄ fi cu noi (Blood be with us)
SÃ¢nge cuprinde-ne (Blood embrace us)
SÃ¢nge ne va salva (Blood will save us)
Unul dupÄ altul (One by one)

SÃ¢nge peste noi (Blood upon us)
SÃ¢nge ne va proteja (Blood will guard us)
SÃ¢nge ne va salva (Blood will save us)
