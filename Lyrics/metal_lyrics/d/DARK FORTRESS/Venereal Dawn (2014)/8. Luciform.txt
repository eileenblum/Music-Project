Strip me of mind
Blunt, caged and blind
Strip me of thought
In falsehood wrought
In lies enshrined

Peel from me this deception
Expose the truth underneath
Pristine will and perception
In flesh diguised, in madness wreathed

Strip me of skin
The curse of my kin
Strip me of soul
Strip me of all
Holiness and sin

I withdraw, I forsake, I dissolve, I decease
All shape and world now below me
I succumb, shed my life wrecked by scourge and disease
I am, no more, no less, now show me

Luciform
All nightmares yield to sacred flame
Dressed in mortal frame

Luciform
The stars unveiled my secret name
Unreachable, unspeakable

Ain soph aur

Strip me of selves
The hunger that delves
Through shape and doubt
Imprisoned cells
Turn me inside out

Pour me into infinity
Where core becomes shell
Release my divinity
The boundless light in living hell

Luciform
All nightmares burn in sacred flame
Dressed in mortal frame

Luciform
The stars become my secret name
Unreachable, unspeakable

Ego to augoeides
Vi veri universum vivus vici

Luciform
All nightmares burn in sacred flame
Dressed in mortal frame

Luciform
The stars become my secret name
Unreachable, unspeakable

Vi veri universum vivus vici
