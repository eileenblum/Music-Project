I surround you
You cannot see or touch me
Yet I drown you
A tidal pest invades

I have found you
Insipid prey to wanton storm
I'll hound you
You can't escape, the snare is laid

Demise engenders
Sleeps inside your veins
That sigh in splendor
And tremble in disgust

Sheer and tender
Your naked vessels all apace
Surrender to my amniotic lust's embrace

I howl through you
Drink deeply as you breathe me in
I prowl through you
Devour you from within

I am the wind that swallows you
The chafing hurt that hollows you
The blind decay that follows you
Until you are over

Blasting flesh to fog
Gales are harrying
Aghast visages torn to carrion

I entomb you
My venom sheathes and flays
I consume you
The very air you breathe turns to razorblades

I'm inside you
Your every heave inflames
The spell that tied you
To horrors that beget
The plagues that despise you
With every pulse your heart's
Hell defies you
Tghtens the torniquet

I howl through you
Drink deeply as you breathe me in
I prowl through you
Devour you from within

I am the wind that swallows you
The chafing hurt that hollows you
The blind decay that follows you
Until you are over
And I begin

The seven corners of the world
Cannot hide you from me
When your I is dead my You will become Me

And once I've scraped the last layer of delusion
From the hallowed blaze
Buried below that feeble carcer you called life
This illusion rends and reveals
The truth this downfall shall destroy

I howl through you
Drink deeply as you breathe me in
I prowl through you
Devour you from within

I am the wind that swallows you
The chafing hurt that hollows you
The blind decay that follows you
Until you are over
And I begin
