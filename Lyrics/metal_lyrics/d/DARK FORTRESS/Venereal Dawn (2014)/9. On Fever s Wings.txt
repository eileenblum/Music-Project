Keep breathing, keep heaving
Though all those eyes will never see
This new world seething
Amidst ruin and debris

Keep weaving the spindles
Of astral thread that dwindles
Till tongues lick and rekindle
This embodied symphony

Keep sowing, keep glowing
And shattered minds respire again
Though plagues keep mowing
Seeds are growing from this bane

Transfiguring mankind
Extinguished, left behind
Ancient fabric unwinds
In deathless resilience

Beyond the whip of gods unknown
Beyond the grip of flesh and bone
Life seeks new luminance
Breathless in its brilliance

Subside
The empyrean ignites
The ether sings
Open wide

Alight
From the other side
On fever's wings
Beyond all light

We're swarming, reforming
Cloaked by invisibility
Wide awake we're storming
Towards the great epiphany

We're burning, returning
We have become the source
Feed carnal yearning
As this magic takes its course

Our auras
Auroras
Of pure elysian energy
Evoke ardent plethoras from catastrophe
