I came to

Tied in a circle
Everything stinks
Tremors the ground

Tarnished scars
Shadows closing in
Wild-eyed chanting
Quakes in the wind

AsÃ­ bailan (This is how)
Los herejes (The heretics dance)
Amor de sangre (Love of blood)
Cebo traen, (They bring bait,)
Y se caen (And they fall)
Amor de sangre (Love of blood)

Betrayal and vengeance
This is how the puppets dance
To the pipe of the black goat
The downfall has begun

Travelling through us now
A great brightness
Strung and hung
Then the blades

A crown of light
And skewered shades
Levitates into thick air
On a crimson cataract

AsÃ­ se mueren (This is how)
Los herejes (The heretics die)
Terror de sangre (Terror of blood)
Cada uno tirano, (Each one a tyrant,)
Cuchillo en mano (Knife in hand)
Terror de sangre (Terror of blood)

Betrayal and vengeance
This is how the puppets fall
To the scythe of the black goat
Wielded by their sons

Betrayal and vengeance
This is how the living crawl
In the dirt they go insane
The prey no longer runs

This is how the living pay
Kill their own for one more day
As unction against the sun

Betrayal and vengeance
This is how the puppets die
In the wake of the black goat
Cold rays spread like fire

Betrayal and vengeance
This is how the shivering sky
Fumes us out and bleeds us dry
And draws us ever nigher

Neh machitia ahmo (I know you not)
Pero neh oquimpiaya mati (But I have known)
Coyolxauhqui (Coyolxauhqui)
Teh huigui nian (You must come to me)
Teh ya tlanque (You're almost through)
Tehuatl nicmati (You will know me)
Ihcuac nin cocoliztli (When this ordeal is)
Ompa (Over)
