Upon my head
I wear this crown
Of primal incest, sludge and bone
I bear it or I drown

Regent of vivisection
Lord of spiral gruel
A scourge of airborn fauna black
From which a new me grew
From which a new me grew

I am unwound
I am in wound
I am unsound
I am in womb

I am unwound...

Darwin's weeping phosphor
In the blink of an eye
The mulch of a million dead
Reaching for the sky
My body's hook beaked monolith
With chromosome stinger tip
Spits life like mother nature's
Crippled shattered hips

Oh hive
God peak of all rot
Bless me with your strength
Free me of my lot
Subcore rusty razors
Cut the string of life
My primate culture cage
Sings for fight or flight

I am unwound
I am in wound
I am unsound
I am in womb

I am unwound...

Hide me from my horror
Push me into sight
Cast your gaze upon me
An ode to nature's slight
There's laughter in the changes
Tremors in the wounds
No comfort in the earthborne
Not in the malformed moon

Holy mountain
God peak of all rot
Bless me with your strength
Free me of my lot
Subcore rusty razors
Cut the string of life
My primate culture cage
Sings for fight or flight

I am unwound
I am in wound
I am unsound
I am in womb

First came light
Expanding like a culture
A cascading torrent sickle cell
Spreads wings like dancing vultures

First came light
Commuting to the void
A seed of tumour, horror born
A wound of perfect keloid

Festering mutation grizzles with my body's truth
I am the jigsaw of a mad god

First came light
Expanding like a culture
A cascading torrent sickle cell
Spreads wings like dancing vultures

First came light
Commuting to the void
A seed of tumour, horror born
A wound of perfect keloid

I, I am the jigsaw
The jigsaw of a mad god

Upon my brow
I carry it
This burden gifted, curse born taint
My new god's choice of wit
So I walk
Black the land
Share my gift, and forlorn hope
Till my bones return to sand

Return to sand
Return to sand

I am
I am the jigsaw of a mad god
I am
I am the jigsaw of a mad god
