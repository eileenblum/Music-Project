Your world
I want no part of it
I stay here
Close the shell
Or go to kill
What kills me
Again and again

As the waters rise
Wave after wave
Stab after stab
As the masses smother
Wave after wave
Stab after stab

Until there's no blood left to spill
The precious dark broken
Wasted, another silent breath

Better to let the waters engulf
No more awakening into living death
Better to sink into the deep
Let the oceans crush the ground
Than become one of you

Let me sleep
