[Music: Asvargr, Lyrics: Morean]

Petrified,
In sleep paralysis,
Swallowed by
Nightmare cataclysms,

Cohorror builds it's temple in me,
Erecting hydric elevations,
Under my cataleptic skin,

(... Dreaming and dead... still howling defiance...)

Even in this gruesome revelation,
The bottom drops from abyssal unreality,

Wrenching revulsion,
Cracks my skull, kills me again,
I know this epiphany,
Wearing my own face...
Who are you...?

Cohorror has laid it's eggs in me,
Parasitic larvae from beyond existence,
Raven the remnants of my decaying humanity.

This gnostic burst repels,
All life to unbeing, the essence of death,
Transmogrifies all,
To the pitiless laughter of the birthless.

"How resilient
Not to choose to flee,
Rather be
Consumed by us..."

"You have a name,
Long forgotten by men and their gods,
Eat my soul if you will,
But impart yourself."

"In your worlds,
We cannot be known,
There's no Here
For us to ever be."

"If you desire so,
To blindly see,
Seek the path,
That leads through the Eidolon."

Bedevilled
Into unearthly perplexity,
Frozen in horror,
My countenance stares back at me.
