[Music: V Santura, Lyrics: Morean]

Sparked by sentience in me,
Immense, the globed sky,
Marked by death in life,
The We hatches from the I,

Seek thee in me, find me in thee,
Izzu Tahuti, bearing Horus transfigured,

Catacrusis...
Metanova hurled down the dimensions,
Catacrusis...
Raving madness only to the profane.

Immanent transcendence,
Bearing down, I bring the fire,
The misguided shrouded,
In blissful nescience,

Seek thee in me, find me in thee,
Izzu Tahuti, bearing Horus transfigured...

Transcendent imminence,
Bearing down, I bring the fire,
My corpse awaits,
The universe my grave...

Catacrusis...
Metanova hurled down the dimensions,
Catacrusis,
Raving madness only to the profane.
