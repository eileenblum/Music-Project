[Music: V Santura, Lyrics: Mina, Morean]

Lethean crevasses magnetized,
Inebriate the fallen,
Forebode the Edge of Night,

In absence,
Discovery of luscious pain,
Volcano hushed,
Boiling licks, sculpting memories,
Merciless hand,
Lacerating to Devour.

Ever-seeing, sleepless drug,
Atramentous,
Atomise,
Forgetful, shunned by perjuring light.
Walking asleep,
The core hungered, deprived.

Asleep,
Lost the light of day.

At the borders of emptiness,
The dusk of debauched desire's seizure,
Revealed, on nadir enthroned,
A ceraunoscopic spectre,
A pulsing sclera wants me, spewing faces,
From her hideous nidus at the edge of night.

Severed limbs,
Jolting in spasms,
Convulsing to connect,
To lobotomized phantasms,

Asleep,
Lost the light of day.
