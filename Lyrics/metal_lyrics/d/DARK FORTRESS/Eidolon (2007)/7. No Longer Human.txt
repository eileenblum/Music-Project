[Music: V Santura, Lyrics: Morean]

Open the Aethyr with a creak like a quake,
And a hiss of newborn stars,
There is division, hither, homeward,
We call to life, the Anti-Janus,

The anti-door that splits the mirror,
We call to death, the inertia of incarnation,
Twirling the vortex, our gazes, hermetic,
Shall cause the tide of time to rip.

No longer morphically crucified,
Devour the form of all life,
In their star-engulfing grip.

Twin gaping black holes,
Consume your flesh,
In a halo of flaring, spinning worlds,

No longer human,
Your eyes are transcending,
The cortex of your burning soul,

Deep in the heart of Uroboros,
Rectificando Invenies Clavem Occultam,
Unmake all doors,
Let life and death be one,

Plunge with me,
Into the sixth dimension,
Embodied in us,
The phase-space of all life at once,

Twirling the vortex,
Our gazes spawn novas,
Have caused the void of space to rip,

No longer morphically crucified,
Devour the form of all life,
In their star-engulfing grip,

Born from our fire,
The shape of all death at once,

Twin gaping black holes,
Consume your flesh,
In a halo of flaring, spinning worlds,

No longer human,
Your eyes are transcending,
The cortex of your burning soul...
