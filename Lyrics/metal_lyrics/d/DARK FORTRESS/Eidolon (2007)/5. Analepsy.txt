[Music: V Santura, Lyrics: Morean]

To grim horizons, the I escapes,
The body broken, a hapless shape.
Thanatos rising, from Eros' womb,
From life awoken, my carnal tomb

Soon now... or never.

Amorphous angels eerily sing,
A glaring promise of deliverance,
From devastation and suffering,
Spark faint illusions of omnipotence.

Come, Analepsy,
Unmake me...
Take me away...
Analepsy,
Unbreak me...

My soul is gone, my mind is charred,
There's not much left, to be redeemed,
The storm has blown my Self to shards,
I drift, bereft of death or dream.

Soon now... or never.

Amorphous angels eerily sing,
A glaring promise of deliverance,
From devastation and suffering,
Spark faint illusions of omnipotence.

Come, Analepsy,
Unmake me...
Take me away...
Analepsy,
Unbreak me...

With broken eyes, I turn to stone,
Derelict, dissolved, I fade, alone...

The vision dies in a void beyond measure,
Unabsolved, the decrepit ruined temple of all pleasure.
