A black glock
A black glock my heart's pumping fast

They tried to strongarm my home homie who's done me right
If they would of hit him wrong it would have been on on sight
I ain't trying to act hard and I'm not about a heater
For sure my brother's keeper, you know it's getting deeper
What am I supposed to do when your back's up against the wall?
Be there to break your fall! Yeah!

A black glock my heart's pumping fast

We get fat props then lines get crossed
High stake stand offs, in a black truck I scened'em off
Feel the frost prayed for life that could be lost
Love over slugs, got my point across
What am I supposed to do when your back's up against the wall?
Be there to break your fall! Huh!

A black glock my heart's pumping fast
You better be ready
There's got to be a better way!
