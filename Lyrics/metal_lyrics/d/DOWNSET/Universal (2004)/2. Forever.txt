Forever we ride dedicated
All day, I got that gift it don't quit and when you hear the cuts kitchen stop hating and think of this
Embrace endless infinity, this never left me, technique mastery
It's always on

Forever we ride dedicated

Playing for keeps without a question , Tanach, Quaran, math thoughts, science sessions
Doing my best to keep Judas out my section, when your banging it out as a team ain't no questions
So what'cha knowing about this immortality now? The simple stillness, you know I feel this!
Kingdom children revealing the realness, like the heights of the pyramids, long time in
It's always on

Forever we ride dedicated
Forever dedicated
