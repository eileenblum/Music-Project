Our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Chicalinda, mujer pan preciosa, chicalinda, chicalinda
Child you're born with my mother's brown eyes
Your smile my refuge in dark skies
A constant reminder that I'm still alive
In the presence of angel why cry?

Smiles and cries on my way to heaven

You are the gold seed 4th downs the line
Your picture is kept close by my side
Ask me question got nothing to hide
My prayers for mercy and blue skies
Smiles and cries on my way to heaven
Chicalinda, mujer pan preciosa, chicalinda, chicalinda

You held him close 'til he passed away, my admiration for your loyalty will never dacay
Your precious blood is my blood! Your precious love is my love!
I'm holding it close every word that you say. The warmth of your heart is never far away

Smiles and cries on my way to heaven
Chicalinda, mujer pan preciosa, chicalinda, chicalinda
