We flip missions just like you flip'em
No gimmicks all in it, off limits authentic exhibition
Someone always trying to get a piece of the program
I'm always becoming advancing with a plan
Let them know! Working it out with an eye and eye flow
Let me go! Still got it with me wherever I go

Move move get out of my face step aside so we can make this happen!

Off the hook give me some breathing room to look
Not about to get took, plug me into a main channel input
Rebirth disciple nothing's final, you'll have to get close to me to know what I know
Let them know working it out with an eye and eye flow
Let me go! Still got it with me wherever I go

Move move get out of my face step aside so we can make this happen!

It's almost like they want to see you stay at the same place
That faint pace, make my way to the main gate
Accelerate the chase thought we couldn't shift shape?
One rob raised all day out the way!

Move move get out of my face step aside so we can make this happen!
