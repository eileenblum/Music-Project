Who orders balance? Who orders chaos?
Who inverts pentagramic symbols in a black magic saonce?
Who dares distorting the infinite natural forces? Clockwork timeline, metamorphic courses
Do you need to be controlled? Do you know what freedom is? The mob the masses
The beast with many faces gives in, next when? Passions trap you in, think thin, action, connection
I feel an all wise protection in the sun and the wind my kin

Hectic, uh uh, it's getting hectic uh uh, it's getting out of control, out of control

You know you wouldn't say anything about it. You must not trouble yourself
Invisible powers got so much to tell! As long as you listen is the only reality
Without a word escape captivity

Hectic, uh uh, it's getting hectic uh uh, it's getting out of control, out of control
Out of control!!! Out of control!!!

Who is rebel son? Who is rebel daughter? Ceremonial circles of sorcery bring to my lips clean water
Ain't no stopping in this digital data massive metropolis, if you ain't on the team step-off of this
Serving up sounds to a hyped up populous, on to this audio opulence, sonic astonishment
Who keeps the key to the leash of this free beast? Believe me I seek deep to the complete

Hectic, uh uh, it's getting hectic uh uh, it's getting out of control, out of control
