So you want to hear some rap shit? So you want to hear some rap shit?
Give'em what they want, give'em what they want, give'em what they want, give'em what they want.

When I think of rap shit! I think of blackness activist! Like that sista' Angela Davis!
Mohammed Ali knockouts are the greatest! Jackie Robinson, gospel and the nation
So what's the latest? Check the wack playlist. Don't hear city slick cypher science
Spittin' ghetto frustrations! Listen to this I want to hear Hip-Hop ethnic consciousness
Don't care if ya ballin' kid or catchin' cases. I ain't hating, ain't pumping fashion. Monopoly blatant.
Who's paying radio stations for hourly rotations?

So you want to hear some rap shit? So you want to hear some rap shit?
Give'em what they want, give'em what they want, give'em what they want, give'em what they want.

When I think of Hip-Hop I think of blackness and bee-bop, Billy Holiday, Chuck Dee and Scott La Rock!
City street blocks, outlined bodies with chalk, one-times swooping up like hawks
Graff crews bailing burners getting props, fat laced Pumas step to mark the spot
Asiatic ebony faces get shocked when they witness my pigment and penship shocked
No special effects, just developed text. This is a way of live live &amp; direct!

So you want to hear some rap shit? So you want to hear some rap shit?
Give'em what they want, give'em what they want, give'em what they want, give'em what they want.
