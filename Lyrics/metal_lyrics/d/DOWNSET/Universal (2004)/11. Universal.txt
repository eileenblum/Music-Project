Universal a universal, bring it to all bring it to all
Universal just like the sun, moon, star, man, woman and child
All relative out loud cosmic found sound, compound blend
Part of me harmony, we will transcend
Tell me that you care as i reach you
Out there I know there's someone who does
Something so simple as me and you
Can change it from the way it was
Universal a universal, bring it to all bring it to all

Universal, don't you get it?
Like the rhythm of heartbeats vibes all connected
The fusion of elements blonde dreadlocked, melanin, black, brown, feminine, masculine amend
Tell me that you care as I reach you
Out there I know there's someone who does
Something so simple as me and you
Can change it from the way that it was
Universal a universal, bring it to all bring it to all
A Universal!
