Its' jumping off!!!

Revival of the corner stone I could never be alone
You promised me the comforter, my armour is the conqueror
The meek will surely inherit the earth, inspirational guardian Victoria's cure
Under the wing of the most high, unshakable faith with a champions stride
Tell that you want me to, tell me that you'll see it through

It's jumping off!!!
