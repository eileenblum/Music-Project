Say come killer! You know it is sickness! You can't deny it sockness!
Yes greed is sickness! Greed is sickness! I am not a lower form of human life!
All none son nagging sense of nobodiness.
Deep disappointment slave among abundance.
Who lives it knows it as I flow the theme.
These conditions extreme deepest evil unseen I'm putting up with what is unjust.
But truth lifts with a swiftness just like dust.
Are we givin' the realm to reach our highest ability.
That's the question see word up 'cause I don't see it be!!
I am not a lower form of human life! Kill greed! Say come killer!
They taken the food from the mouths of the ones that need to be the most fed!
They taken the food from the mouths of the ones that been left for dead!
They taken the food from the mouths of the ones that have been treated as human debris!
They taken the food from the mouths of the ones who will embrace divinity!
Poverty is the worst form of violence! I am not a lower form of human life!
