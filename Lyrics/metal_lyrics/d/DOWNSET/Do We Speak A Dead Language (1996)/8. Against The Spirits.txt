There is a God and I bow and you will hate me for it!
Duty to humble my soul to a speck of dust and you'll hate me for it!
Ageless understanding of love from the heavens and you'll hate me for it!
Serenities balance is my innermost peace and you will hate for it!
Your world is against the spirits! This is day is against the spirits!
I gladly detach my soul from the lies that sicken this day.
Disregarding the metric wickedness that decays my inner space.
There is something inside myself that can't become this "sickness."
Reminded once more that the quest for the top is coldness!
I will love God of "Zion" with all my heart and you will hate me for it!
Intentions will be so helples and you will hate me for it!
I will love through resurrecting eyes and you will hate me for it!
Self exultation is the opiate of the masses.
Your world is against the spirits! This day is against the spirits!
