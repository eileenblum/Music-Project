One Blood!
One Blood United One Blood! United! One Blood One Pack!
We've done our best
To break down the walls
Only to become a stage for Flamboyant demigods
I don't believe we can
Express our truest moment
Until we embrace
The simplistic Nature
Of our fusion.
United! One Blood One Pack!
One Blood!
One Blood United One Blood!
I ain't gonna hold up
The dream will never foldup
Rebirth of the vision
That awoke us
Uprising side by side again Building ain't lost that feeling
Believing the new dawn
True bonds add on
Chain of strength
Tribal solid steel stand strong Score it like the same team
The same scene
Lock and link deep
You know what I mean?
United! One Blood One Pack!
One Mind! One Voice!
One Thought! One Blood!
