Make it back y'all 
Haha, check me out 
My enemies is in too motherfuckin' close, cut throat, zone association cold like stone, who'm I gettin' with, too connected with infected kids, who ain't done shit but strip my kit, can't believe what I see, sickening scenery, in the heat of things you won't be with me so flee my team, bloodsucker, yo, you think you got me ruffed up, you ain't got the stuff to cut my gut, what's up, check your people, check your camp, check your camp, check your people, check your people, check your camp, check your camp, check your people 
Check 'em what I got 
Who's got me like that, who's true like that, who's got my back in this pivotal pack of masks, bail my people outta lock up cause I got love when they caught up, will I get my grands back, testin' where they're hearts at, dead first before betrayal to my main network, visible signals, what's the move, cut 'em loose, check your people, check your camp, check your camp, check your people, check your people, check your camp, check your camp, check your people 
Slipping and falling I threw my pearls to swine, I parted my fruit to squandering flesh, who chase prestigious design, I guess that's what I get, a fool is dangerous company, who brings much regret 
[x2] You
Are so transparent [x2]
You are so transparent
You're so transparent
Transparent, take your piece and run, I'll become whole again with the sight of a new sun, take your piece and run, I'll become whole again with the sight of a new sun, you played me again, you played me again 
Keep it real y'all 
Check your people, check your camp, check your camp, check your people, check your people, check your camp, check your camp, check your people
Watch out, who you run with.
