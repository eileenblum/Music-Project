2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, precious souls before my birth gave their lives to change this mess, I know they saw something in the dawn, visions that would never let them rest, unborn generations inherited the multiple chain destruction to all of my relations, I've done what I can in my situation, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore 
Swift velocity, all up in your grill, optimistic conquest to rebuild, all responsible, not invincible audio obstacles, all irresistible, who's example should a brother truly follow, keep it tight with the inner spiritual and all will follow, I write this tight verse for new life-cycle arrivers, I'd give my life first for peace to work 
2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore 
You can come up on yours but then what, this may take sacrifices but I know I'm not alone, exit the gloom of this age to a hope that's cut in stone, lost into demise, lost into demise, lost into demise, lost into demise 
2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, 2000, 2000, this is not ours anymore, yeah.
