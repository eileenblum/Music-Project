Just, just, just because we rock the same style of tracks and we rock the same stage it don't put us on the same page like, like this 
Talk all the shit you want but you know I got you listenin', gifted in mic rippin', unlimited linguistic fitness, district by district groove, move units but you lookin' clueless to the roots of this proven movement, 300 and 60 degress of complete me, when you see these believe the meaning in 3D, full contact with fat tracks out the habitat I'm at, check the format, contrast to fad acts
Rock it steady, steady rockin'
Rock it steady, steady rockin', I rock the mic in Philly, rock the mic in New York city, rock the mic in LA, vicinities infested with gang activity, someone's always trying to test my agility, can't retreat, have to keep my game and strategy, handling tragedies rapidly I keep advancing, let it be heavy, deadly hybrid specialty, all about theory, beats, technique and relativity, seek out my destiny written way out before me
Rock it steady, steady rockin'
Rock it steady, steady rockin', while you lost the gold and platinum I rock this anthem for kids strugglin' up in universal project slums, consensus, objection while you get numb across the millennium, Shatan prays on division, millions with melanin feel the tension, humanitarian unsison must become one, spectacular speech patterns shatter chapters of debatin' slanderers, challengers, what are you after, all is not terminal, non-commercial circle, peace to the creator, who flows me through the hurdles, connection with my origin, alpha omega is my champion, get done what can't get done, El-Hajj-Malik, El Shabazz, El-Hajj-Malik, El Shabazz, El-Hajj-Malik, El Shabazz, El-Hajj-Malik, El Shabazz, rock it steady
Steady rockin'
Rock it steady
Steady rockin', uh
Keep it steady, keep it steady rockin', keep it steady, keep in my pocket, keep it steady, keep it steady rockin', keep it steady, keep in my pocket.
