Great perfection appears so defective, great fullness feels so very empty
Great sincerity at times seems so insincere, great triumph seems like such a loss, such a loss 
No more excuses, what are you running away from?
Intoxicant platform, you grow increasingly numb
At once you're so alive, so alive 
What up kid, you fallen off, what up kid, you fallen off, at once you're so alive, so alive, so alive, what up kid, you fallen off, what up kid, you fallen off, what up kid, you fallen off, what's up kid, you fallen off 
Great perfection appears so defective, great fullness feels so very empty
Great sincerity at times seems so insincere, great triumph seems like such a loss, such a loss 
No more excuses, what are you running away from?
Intoxicant platform, you grow increasingly numb
At once you're so alive, so alive, so alive, what up kid, you fallen off, what up kid, you fallen off, at once you're so alive, so alive, so alive, what up kid, you fallen off, what's up kid, you fallen off, what up kid, you fallen off, what's up kid, you fallen off 
You fallen off 
You fallen off 
At once you're so alive, so alive, so alive, what up kid, you fallen off, what up kid, you fallen off, at once you're so alive, so alive, so alive, what up kid, you fallen off, what up kid, you fallen off, at once you're so alive, once you're so alive, once you're so alive, so alive, so alive, what up kid, you fallen off, what up kid, you fallen off, what up kid, you fallen off, what's up kid, you fallen off.
