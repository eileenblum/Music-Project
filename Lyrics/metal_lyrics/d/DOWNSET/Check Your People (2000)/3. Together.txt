I'm a let you know, check it
Drop your guard, this time I come in peace healing bad blood, seeking foregivness and love, mad hyped to squash all beef and toy fuss, you rather turn your back but I'm asking you not to handle it like that, down to get right but you trip like I trip, both teams must come clean so hold up on your fronting, line drawn as I fight strong, this hate can't last lifelong, hyped on sights of my tribes bond together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now, together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now, now, now, now, now, now 
Crews that used to be thight lose sight, who's right, hopeful vocals flow from one, who knows that blow by blows gotta go, can't talk it, must live it moment by moment, future depends on present connections within my section, pages of ages laced with days, split many lessons to learn from worse ones dirts, done, bust a face, pop a grill, na, I'm a chill threatening enemies, entering tensions, building together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now, together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now 
We are growing again cause that's just the way you are, dig the beginning upon a place, without ever it felt from far, age sustaining in peace, this mockery your energy 
You're eyes don't mean the same thing to me anymore, your words don't mean the same thing to me anymore, your face don't mean the same thing to me anymore, your smile don't mean the same thing to me anymore, this day don't mean the same thing to me anymore, this words don't mean the same thing to me anymore, you're eyes don't mean the same thing to me anymore, your words don't mean the same thing to me anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
(Anymore) [x5]
Together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now, together, together, get together, together, together, it never meant as much as it does right now.
