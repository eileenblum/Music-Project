Go 
I'm still there
I'm still there so you think you're familiar with me, well, I passed long before you looked in these eyes, went on, vanished, left this temple young on a crowded bedside, piercing voices, high screams through a stained yellow wall, long before you spoke words to me I departed on perpetual nightfall 
I'm still there, pure trauma
Frame by frame pure trauma
I'm
Still
There 
Reach right through me and I know you question my unsteady motion, wanted to lay myself to rest long ago but my life sings on, on, thinking it would blow into a petty dust of gathering nothing but visions flourish through the hallways of my mind, holding, haunting, I'm still there, pure trauma
Frame by frame pure trauma
I'm
Still
There 
Pure trauma 
I'm still there, pure trauma
Frame by frame pure trauma
I'm still there
I'm still there, pure trauma, I'm still there
I'm still there, pure trauma 
Pure trauma.
