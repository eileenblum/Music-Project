Comin' back 
Comin' back 
Comin' back, comin' back cause I can and I plan to stand in these days to come, counter attack on image acts that craft, trend chaser listeners, who ain't serious, ain't hearing it, direct action is how I battle, subtract me from tragic masses
Why should I slay through my consumption, why should I build onto this mess, we will all be held accountable, we've taken more than we've needed 
Why should I?
Comin', comin' back
And you ain't gettin' my best yet, comin', comin' back [x3]
And you ain't gettin' my best yet 
Where's the long term results and changes, this is gonna take my precious life, inescapable concerns intensify, return alive, combine with a fight in mind, are we on the same side, high price, full time, self sacrifice, will we ever respect innocent life, comin', comin' back
And you ain't gettin' my best yet, comin', comin' back [x3]
And you ain't gettin' my best yet 
Do how I gotta do, won't apologize, purify, purify, won't apologize, do how I gotta do, won't apologize, purify, purify, won't apologize 
Why should I? .
