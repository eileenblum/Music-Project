Life is just a dream
On the way to death... Death... Death...

Mournful dusk
Sea of bitterness
Color of my dreams
Seed of tenderness

Seed of pain... Seed of anguish...

"Tuas cores intensas
SÃ£o silÃªncios... SilÃªncios de veludo
Tuas lÃ¡grimas imensas
SÃ£o gritos de um mudo

Crepusculo tristonho
Mar de amargura
Cor do meu sonho
Semente de ternura...
Semente de tortura...

Tu... Tu que choras sem pranto
DÃ³i ver-te assim sofrer
Tua morteÂ Ã© um desencanto
O cÃ©u deixara de arder..."

Don't go away...
Don't fade away...
Don't go away...
Don't fade away...
Don't leave me this way...

Don't leave me this way...

Don't go away...
Don't fade away...
Don't go away...
Don't fade away...
Don't leave me this way...

Don't leave me this way...

Your deep colours
Are velvet moments
Your eternal, perpetual, infinite tears
Are silent cries...

Oh! How I wish!
How I wish I could hide inside you
Lose myself in the sky's immensity
To cast myself into the death I once perceived...

You, who weeps without tears
It hurts to see your enduring
Your death is pure disenchantment
The sky will stop blazing!...

Oh! How I wish!
How I wish I could hide inside you
Fall asleep in your arms
And forget all the pain I have felt... Felt...

Mournful dusk
Sea of bitterness
Color of my dreams
Seed of tenderness

You, who weeps without tears
It hurts to see your enduring
Your death is pure disenchantment
The sky will stop blazing!...
