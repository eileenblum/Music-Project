Another fruit is falling from my eyes,
The seed... the last of the lies...
Leaving This Land Of The Eternal Desires,
I'm drinking from thy enchanted fires...

A Ride In A Dream Crow...
Seems to be the last to see below.
But, this sinister glimmer,
Made me The Purest Dreamer...

Shadow Dance...

My search begins here, alone...
Close to the fall I cry...

Shadow dance... swallow dance... Shadow Dance...
Infinity... the eternal spell over me... forever...
Infinity... falling forever... the eternal spell over me...
Swallow dance... Shadow dance...
Infinity... the eternal spell... swallow dance... forever...
I will dance forever...

...Infinity...
