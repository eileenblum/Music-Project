At last, I can feel it, the burning sky over me.
Am I falling or rising from this garden of suffering?
This endless agony will be always present
In this strange dance with my destiny.

The vast eternity touches my soul,
As the light that haunt me fades away...
Tears of blood feeding my hate
To that place of pain, that once was my fate.

For my Desire I cry... your Desire...
I cry for my Desire...

Thorns of trust in these moments of hidden pain,
Thoughtless sadness, yet so vain...
This yearning and painful farewell,
Will be endlessly heartfelt.

I cry for my Desire...

Ancient desires arrested in flesh,
Now and forever left behind,
I cry for my Desire...

Will be tirelessly and always remembered
To the last of the pleasures given.
I cry for my Desire... I cry...

My soul will be always grateful to the wordly pain and love.
But soon as I fall asleep, alone in this sinful sky,

I wish I went so far as my wings can fly...

I die... I cry...
So bring next to me, that Crow of immortality...
