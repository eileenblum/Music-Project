The mermaid... I wish... I fall...
But I need... to touch again that angel...
That woman... I blame... I call...
But I need... to feel again that passion..

Soon as I fall... asleep in this sky...
I wake up... flying in delight...
The cloud of dreams... joins me...
In this eternal flight... in sadness I'll
always be...

I dive into the infinite silent sea,
And swim through the purest cold waters,
The mermaid from the darkest untold stories,
Sings to me lost secrets from the sands of
paradise...
If her words are true as her eyes,
And her pain is the Tear that she cries,
I'll touch the Flame of her sweetness...
I'll drink the Tear, as it touches her
lips...

Welcome to me, kiss of Infinity...! Such pain, such pleasure...
Beyond this endless sea. Now without rest... I can feel...
Between stars and moons, at the gates of the naked dreams,
My mind is like a garden... awaiting the crestfallen love...

These are my dreams... my purest dreams...

I'm The Purest Dreamer...

Where the waters of temptation, bring mortality to the blind...
Dreaming without masks, in silence, I burn my scars...
Horizons of knowledge in the Mist of this twilight night...
Neverending will be this mighty fight...
