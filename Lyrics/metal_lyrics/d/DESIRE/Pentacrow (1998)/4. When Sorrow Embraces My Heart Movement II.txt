My Heart is torn apart, consumed in silence by pain
Shedding in tears and elegies for it's love
Ah, my anguishes, over whelming baleful of my passions
How I wished to blind them near to my chest, feel them and die!
Die... die...

Ah, so much nostalgia! So, so much loneliness!
Poor soul, how you are so fiercely cold
Your whispering sunken with tears, your hurted sighs
Are a seediness, a regret, a desolation
Desolation...

I will die... die...

Oh, how terrible is this anguish, this despair of can't confessing
In a screaming tone, in a last scream
My love with the heart bleeding
