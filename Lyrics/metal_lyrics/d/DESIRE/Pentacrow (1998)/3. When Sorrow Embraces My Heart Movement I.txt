Love have torn us apart...

In the touched silence of my aching soul
A big sea of emotion is heard inside of me...
It is the fury of all flames, the rage of all winds
The anger of all sullen seas

My heart cries... Cries...

And in that immense vastness, my heart cries
Cries the hopelessness, cries the pain, cries the grief
Raised by the love that burns in my frozen heart
Casting fire to my glorious taciturn quietness
The sorrow stream my grievous eyes with water
That floods my heart, that crestfallen sea of tears
