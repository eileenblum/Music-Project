Ah, sentimento funebre! Oh, lutuosa melancolia!
Deusa da negra escurid?o do sentimento que me esfria
Celeste e divina ? a lembran?a, a mem?ria do teu beijo
A arder-me no peito, esse c?u amplo de desejo...

Ah, gloomy feeling! Oh, mournful melancholy!
Goddess of black darkness of the sentiment that freezes me
Heavenly and divine is the remembrance, the memory of your kiss
(Oh sorrow, embrace me... In your arms I wish to die)
Burning in my chest, that wide sky of desire...

Here, just me and you and my shadowy sadness
With my soul already fed up of sighing and moaning
What I want, I want is to take, to take to death
My being overflowing of suffering, perish to suffer

And in deeply sad agony, my eyes ripped off by tears
With which my soul relieves the pain
Are fainting like the sky at daylight
Oh, what outermost of pain! Oh, what tragic misanthropy!

When sorrow embraces my heart, it dies alone...
True love never dies...
Love is suicide...
