My body's burning inside, I can't take this pain (anymore)...
Look at me, God!...
Can't you see me? My flesh starts to rot
And my bones are deformed too...
I am only infected, this is sordid...
And my eyes can't see the truth!
It's a morbid way to die, I don't deserve,
What can I do?!...

My suffer possesses me
Without mercy...
My soul blessed be
Can it escape from this misery?

This unholy sacrifice is very hard
Help me God, please!...
I can't believe in truth, I really belong
To the angel of disease
I long for my time to come
To be blessed by death
God, can I make a question? Why was I born?
Maybe just to die...

"There's nothing left in this life for you...
Apart from death... don't be afraid of it...
Death is just a moment, during your soul
Leaves your own body to the eternal life... life..."

You are my master
I am your son...
You'll take my soul
(And) we'll be as one...
I don't want to escape
From the power that you create
So take me away
To the Devil's reign!

I can feel death, closer than before
I am going to die!
Tears for what?! Life goes on
Even after death!
From the dark I see, I see my Lord
He is calling me!
To go next to him, it's time to close my eyes
So, please, bury me!
