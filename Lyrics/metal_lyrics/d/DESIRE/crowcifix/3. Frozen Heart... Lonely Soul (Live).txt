"Desde que em mim nasceste / Since you were born within
Naquela noite misteriosa / In that secretive night
NÃ£o mais morreste / You haven't withered
Na minha alma silenciosa... / Inside my mute soul... Soul..."

In a single tear I weep over my entire life
And you angel who remains within
Lay bare my lost happiness
Just for one last moment as I'm towards the end...

My heart lies numb, frozen
Out of utter bitterness
For the fire of passion burnt
In its sweet grave of loneliness

I'm the still darkness
I'm melancholy's ache
I'm the loneliness which cannot fill the void
I'm a cry of agony

I feel so lonely, so blank
So cold, so deaden
Locus horrendus in a gloomy world
Flame far down from deep hell

"Meu ser habita na Noite e no Desejo.
Mjnha alma Ã© uma lembranÃ§a que hÃ¡ em mim."

All I ever wanted was a kiss
All I ever wanted was to draw out a single teardrop from you
My whole being dwells on the night and in desire...
My soul lives under the bewitching moon

I'm the still darkness
I'm melancholy's ache
I'm the loneliness which cannot fill the void
I'm a cry of agony

I'm a cry of agony
My soul is bound to yours

I'm the still darkness
I'm melancholy's ache
I'm the loneliness which cannot fill the void
I'm a cry of agony

My soul is bound to yours
I cannot tear myself away from you
