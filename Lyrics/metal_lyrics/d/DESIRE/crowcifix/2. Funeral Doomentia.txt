"Don't stand At my grave and cry,
I am not there... I did not die..."
Cuts my soul as a knife
This pain of a suffering life
Tears are falling from the skies
I will die, cover my eyes...
Cover my eyes...
"Don't stand At my grave and weep,
I am not there... I do not sleep..."
On shadows I dwell alone
Among the angels made of stone
Hear my screams, hear my cries
I will die, cover my eyes
Cover my eyes...
Funeral Doomentia
This is your burial... Your funeral...
Earth to earth
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Funeral Doomentia
"Don't stand at my grave and cry
I am not there... I did not die..."
This shrine of desolate
Shelter of my last fate
Above my tomb a Crow flies
I will die, cover my eyes
Cover my eyes...
