When time and space
Lose their boundaries.
When past, present and future unite.
When my soul reaches eternity
Then my world starts leading
Out to the perfect way.

War - a terrible memory
Agony - forever extinguished
Fear - vanished from my soul
Greed - a forgotten concept

Close your eyes and start dreaming.
Dreaming of a perfect world
A world that probably never exists.
Look out for the perfect world inside
Your soul.

When time and space
Lose their boundary
When past, present and future unite.
When my soul reaches eternity
Then my world starts leading
Out to the perfect way.

War - a terrible memory
Agony - forever extinguished
Fear - vanished from my soul
Greed - a forgotten concept
