Endless nights
Painfull dreams

They show your real face

You're are looking for the bright day.
The time without fear.
Without fear on your own face.

Endless nights
Painfull dreams

They show your real face

Time, the hands of time are running against you.

Truth, you refuse to see it
Sick thoughts are sleeping
Deep inside of you
Deep inside of you

You're looking for the bright day.
The time without fear.
Without fear on your own face.

Time, the hands of time are running against you.

Truth, you refuse to see it
Sick thoughts are sleeping
Deep inside of you
Deep inside of you
