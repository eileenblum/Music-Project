The time of the awakening is near.
Your soul rebels inside your heart.

Cold wrath flows through your brain.
Full of hate you are lying there.

Humid walls the last boundary.
Steel cuts your stores.

Your peace has been destroyed.
Negative are all your feelings.

Marked by life.
Marked by life.
Marked by life.
Your peace has been destroyed.
Negative are all your feelings.

You are feeling the wounds of your body.
The bruises in your soul.
You're feeling the pain.

You're reaching for something positive.
But your hand remains empty.
In an endless distance lies your fortune.

The time of the awakening is near.
Your soul rebels inside your heart.

Cold wrath flows through your brain.
Full of hate you are lying there.

Humid walls the last boundary.
Steel cuts your stores.

Your peace has been destroyed.
Negative are all your feelings.
Marked by life.
Marked by life.
Marked by life.
Your peace has been destroyed.
Negative are all your feelings.
