He summons those who are standing
On the sideline of our society.
Those who have lost their way.
His behaviour feigns the noble heart
But inside is the thirst for might and profit.

He acts in the name of god
The one he's never seen.
He makes the rules,
He's broken a thousand times.
He preaches the apocalypse
For those who refuse to follow him.
He turns the disciples into slaves.

His whole life is a lie.
He loves to reap the fruits of this lie
The aim before his eyes
He forgets all human values.

His whole life is a lie.
The aim before his eyes
He forgets all human values.
The aim before his eyes.

He acts in the name of god
The one he's never seen.
He makes the rules,
He's broken a thousand times.
He preaches the apocalypse
For those who refuse to follow him.
He turns the disciples into slaves.

His whole life is a lie.
The aim before his eyes
He forgets all human values.
His believe is deadend
From which his disciples wanted to flee.
