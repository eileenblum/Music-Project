The way to hell is our soul
It's the entrance to the dark side
Of our brain.

There, where the demons are larking.
Do they wanne get our souls?
Or are they trying to lead us through
The darkness?

Fight your internal fight
Against the infernal might.
Feel the strength of your soul
Your fate is under your control.

Don't turn away!
Face the evil!
The evil inside yourself!
Confess to your dark side!

Find the boundaries of your soul.
The good side as well as the evil.
Look inside your mind.
The search will lead to you!

Fight your internal fight
Against the infernal might.
Feel the strength of your soul
Your fate is under your control.

Don't turn away!
Face the evil!
The evil inside yourself!
Confess to your dark side!

The way to hell is our soul
It's the entrance to the dark side
Of our brain.

There, where the demons are larking.
Do they wanne get our souls?
Or are they trying to lead us through
The darkness?
