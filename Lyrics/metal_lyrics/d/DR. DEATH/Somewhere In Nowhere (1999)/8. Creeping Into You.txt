[Heimann - Khemir]

Rage is not enough
Hate is not enough

Somewhere deep in me
My mind screams
Do I feel indeed

Somewhere deep in me
My mind screams
Do I feel indeed
That timehas gone?
Burn deep in me
My dying hour is coming
Bleed - veins split in me
Bite - bite in my heart
Pain - pain is like
Creep - dominance optimized
Bleed - things split in me
Pain - and nothing can stop it

The time of dreams is far away - the dead comes
Creeping into you
Omen of tears is far away
Creeping into you
The time of dreams is far away
Creeping into you
Is far away, the dead comes
Creeping into you

Somewhere deep in me
Bite - my mind screams
Pain - do I feel indeed
Creep - that time has cme?
Bleed - burn deep in me
Pain - my dying hour is coming

The time of dreams is far away - the dead comes
Creeping into you
Omen of tears is far away
Creeping into you
The time of dreams is far away
Creeping into you
Is far away, the dead comes
Creeping into you
Creeping into you
Creeping into you
