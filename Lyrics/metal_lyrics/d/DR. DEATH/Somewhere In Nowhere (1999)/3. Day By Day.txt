[Heimann - Heimann]

Solitude has me back
While losing any bearings, I pace with
Tied up throat
My eyes reflect, no hope
My hope for a better life
Passed by

Like an iceberg in the south - my power fades away
Day by day
Like an iceberg in the south - my power fades away
Day by day

I'm fighting day by day
But the pain takes all my strength standing there
Approaching phase of endless forlornness
Oh no, please god help me, met me die
Oh no, please god help me, met me die

I can not speak
I can not laugh
I can not breath
Pain blows up my heart
I can not speak
I can not laugh
I can not breath
Pain blows up my heart
Where is the train to a new life?
Where is the train which shows me a better world?
Where is the train to a new life?
Where is the train which takes me far away?

I can not speak
I can ...
Far away
Takes me far away
Day bay day
Takes me far away
Day by day
takes me far away
Day by day
Takes me far away
