[M. Preusser - M. Preusser]

I'm sitting here and the daze disapear
Slowly
Taken back into the real world
Just a moment ago everything seemed so nice,
Illusion of another world
But now I want back, tell me why
Tell me why

Isolation [4X]

Still sitting here, staring at the wall
All I want is being back in my own world
My second self left me alone left me alone
Can't stand the pain, need another chance,
Chance to escape

Isolation [4X]

(Hahahaha...)
