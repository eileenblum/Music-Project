[Heimann - Heimann]

You feel the fear inside day after day
You feel the pain that eats me slowly
Although I'm always searching for rapture
I can't see any sense, sense in my life
Fear and despair take my - will to live
- will to live
- will to live

Lost - behind dark walls
Pain - that never hasn't end
Lost - behind dark walls
Pain - that never hasn't end

Give me your hand I'll help you
I have no power, I can't do it
Give me your hand I'll help you
I have no power, I can't do it

Lost - behind dark walls
Pain - that never hasn't end

Lost...

Give me...

Tears flow over your face 
I can't stop them, I can't smile anymore
Close the door I've to leave now
Like your rose and farewell

Lost - behind dark walls
Pain - that never hasn't end
- behind dark walls
- that never hasn't end
