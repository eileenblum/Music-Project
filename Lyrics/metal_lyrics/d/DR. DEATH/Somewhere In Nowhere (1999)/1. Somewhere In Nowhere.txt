[Heimann - Heimann]

Now you lost, it's time you stick fast
In a tunnel of darkness, without return
You don't abandon, the hope there will be
The hope there will be light at the end

Somewhere in nowhere - time seems to stop
Somewhere in nowhere - a minute seems like eternity
Somewhere in nowhere - pain seems to be extinct
Somewhere in nowhere - you're standing covered with sorrow

Your rest for life, your laughter, your fortune
Are crushed from an oppressive, burden of pain
Now you're siting there, you're out of breath
you with the release, but it doesn't happen

Somewhere in nowhere - time seems to stop
Somewhere in nowhere - a minute seems like eternity
Somewhere in nowhere - pain seems to be extinct
Somewhere in nowhere - you're standing covered with sorrow

You don't abandon, the hope there will be
Light at the end but it doesn't appear
With a tear in yourface you stab at yourself
And disappear in the endless nothigness

Somewhere in nowhere - time seems to stop
Somewhere in nowhere - a minute seems like eternity
Somewhere in nowhere - pain seems to be extinct
Somewhere in nowhere - you're standing covered with Sorrow
