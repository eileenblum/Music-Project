[Heimann - Dr Death]

In my heart there burns a fire
The fire of hate
In my mind there burns a fire
The fire of pain
In my heart there burns a fire
(mmm mmm mmm)
The fire of pain

In my heart there burns a fire
The fire of hate
In my mind there burns a fire
The fire of pain

These two lights show me the way
Out these dark world

Lord of darkness - I summon you

- I summon you

These two lights show me the way
Out these dark world
The world around meis dirty and greedy
Is there no way out?
My brain, my heart are full of pain

These pain pushed me out of the dark

Into another world
Into another world

Lord of darkness - I summon you
Get out - of my way
Lord of darkness - I summon you
Walk - away

These two lights...
In my heart there burns a fire
The fire of hate
(Hahaaa hahaaa)

Lord of darkness...

I look into your eyes - oh lod
See only death - oh lord
I look at your souls - oh lord
Your souls are black
