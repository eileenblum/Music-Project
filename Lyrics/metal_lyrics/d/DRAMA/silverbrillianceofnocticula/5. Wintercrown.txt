Immortal solitude in my dark soul
i raise great temples of hard times
My mind is clean from interdictions
and emptiness is reigning by my heart

Oh, winter! I am your blood-brother
Your majesty and power is absolutely
Mother Blizzard, Father Frost, I will hear
I'll hear your burial song of eternity

On frozen fields and frozen lakes your sign
In frozen woods and frozen mountains your mind

In this time I throne my freedom
in this time! Oh, severe winter
I open thy soul to your kingdom
And my mind will dance in snowstorm
