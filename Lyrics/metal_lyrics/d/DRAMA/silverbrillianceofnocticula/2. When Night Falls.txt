When night falls and sunlight go away
From the glooms going after day
Midnight Father pierce by look the world
Dressed with gold crown of the full moon

Under the white cover of moon light
Everywhere night funeral gown
Dying illusions and doubt

When there will be attack of embittered beast
Bloody sparks will paint the snow
And when the wolf wise one will be satiated
He'll climb a knoll and world will fall silent

And Mother Ground, Moon and Forest
Will hear cry of despair and hatred

There is cry in cold empty darkness
And the storming wind will scream
And will pick up it
And will uplift above the pagan lands
Above Slavic oldest steppes
