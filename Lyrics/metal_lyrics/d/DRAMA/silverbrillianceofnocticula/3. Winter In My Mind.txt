Oh, winter, your shape all-around
I am feeling your ice breathing
Cover my body by your white shroud
Bury my soul in your coffin

On frozen swamps your unknown sign
Frost has drawn ancient runes
Blizzard sings a song of eternal abyss
And angels keep the deepest silence

...winter in my mind...

Winter has opened gates of Hell
And world has failed into the black dwell
Into the black dwell of oblivion
And blizzard song is your funeral hell

...winter in my mind...
