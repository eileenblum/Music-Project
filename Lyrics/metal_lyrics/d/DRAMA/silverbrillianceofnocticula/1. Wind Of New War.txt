Cries of battles break the silence
Flesh on the swords and blood on the hands
Triumph of power and total violence
Screaming death and pleasure to kill

Agonized bodies die in suffering
Bloody filth under the feet
Storm of hate covered the Earth
Returned from the dark pagan woods

Who's ready to die for truth
Who's ready to kill tyrant
Who's ready to break lie
Who's ready - follow us!

Blizzard has covered by wing
And souls of heroes have risen to sky
Little child feels a wind
Wind of freedom and wind of a new war
