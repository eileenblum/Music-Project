Mysterious icy idols are embraced by frosty wind
Silent statues are frown in the darkness of night
The secret spite is latent in every crystal of ice
Grotesque of these forms is demonized

They wait for a beginning of last battle of fire and ice
When the world will disappear in the abyss
They're demons of winter, of frost, of eternal ice
And chaos reflects in their eyes

I see the great movement of frozen air
I feel the great power on the crossroads of winds
I hear an ancient song of dying ones in last battle inside
The icy sculptures and inside my mind

An ancient song has woken them from a long cold dream
Blizzard The Great covered them by shroud
And began to tum them in the snowstorming dance
The dance of all-absorbing darkness and death

The storming north wind warms up their might.
Making them as dense as stone, as strong as steel
And darkness ... Havoc blizzard storms in cold sky,
And where their shadows covered snow valleys and icebound seas 

I see the great movement of frozen air
I feel the great power on the crossroads of winds
I hear an ancient song of dying ones in last battle inside
The icy sculptures and inside my mind

From chaos to chaos
Humanity must fall
The circle must close
And it is inevitable

From chaos to chaos
The icy sculptures
Are waiting that time
When they'll bury everything
In the icy grave

Icy sculptures in the severe frostland
