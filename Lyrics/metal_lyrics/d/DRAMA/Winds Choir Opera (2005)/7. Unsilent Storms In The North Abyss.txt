[originally by Immortal]Delight of the moon is burning inside
Spiritless I lay on cryptic stones
Mesmerizing snow wait silent above me
And my yeam for frost grow strongly

I am demon
A demon with a shadowed face
Entering to my wintercoffin
A waiting to see the dawnless realms
Staring into the ground of glass
A perfect view I could failed into my eyes

The unsilent storms in the north abyss
