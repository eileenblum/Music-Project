Between mighty mountains of severe north
In the icy coffin sleeps her magic force
Silver northern winds snake her cradle
And winterdemons are ready for decisive battle

Oh, Winter Witch, open your eyes and awake
Give great power of blizzard of your demons

Demons are ready for a battle on heaven or hell
Arise from deep abyss of restless sleeps
And cover this world by your shawl
The sun will never rise, it's the angels fall

Splinters of breaking coffin in my eyes
Grand awakening of the White Witch I'll see

Turn loose the pack of northern winds
Open the gate for the snowstorming beasts

Between mighty mountains of severe north
In the icy coffin sleeps her magic force
Silver northern winds snake her cradle
And winterdemons are ready for decisive battle

Splinters of breaking coffin in my eyes
Grand awakening of the White Witch I saw

I left northern winds pack will come soon
Hungry rage and hale under the wintermoon
Turn loose the pack of northern winds
Open the gate for the snowstorming beasts
