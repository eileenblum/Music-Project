Cold breathing of powers of Darkness inside
Inside the silent stones and the oldest trees
Whisper of the forgotten gods infront and behind
Invisible hands of all-absorbing Darkness

I am hearing any voices of black swamps
Reflection of Moon, evil eyes of misty lakes
I am feeling creatures of ni9ght wood
I am feeling their looks behind my back
Wings of night covered the trees
And this embrace so cold and black

Odd shadows are beginning the game.... and night is falling
and my mind is running away to the darkwoods' embrace

Thousands lonely souls
Find in this dark majesty
Long-awaited 9reat tranquility
And open the gate of immortality
Dark spirit of Misanthropic nature.
Holy cradle of immortal heathen souls
Unknowable power of masters of darkwoods
Its power stay from the other side of my mind

Cold breathing of powers of Darkness inside
Inside the silent stones and the oldest trees
Whisper of the forgotten gods infront and behind
Invisible hands of all-absorbing Darkness

Odd shadows are beginning the game.... and night is falling
and my mind is running away to the darkwoods' embrace
