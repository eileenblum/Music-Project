Passing a way of sorrow
I feel seclusion and aloofness
Which absorb reality in my mind
And blow away into the darkness
Of deep endless mighty winter forest
Wrapped in mystery
And magic witchcraft of moonlight
Dissipating above the arctic land
White cloth of valleys is embraced by haze
Dusky welkin is covered by silvery veil
Of bewitching dead-white moonlight

... Silver Brilliance of Nocticula

Only mooneye will see
The peaks of snowy trees
Only moonlight will bathe
Deserted glades in blue light
Glades and valleys without
Footmarks on the snow
Only white Goddess-Winter
Is able to rule here
There, where smooth of lakes
Is covered with crystalline ice
Mighty wood is whispers to me the words:
"Here I born by pagan Winter
And storming winds"

Oh, our Mother! Oh, full Moon!
Mesmerize my self
Reflect my shadow on the snow
At the great winter night

Oh, our Mother! Oh, full Moon!
Your silver magic brilliance - your light
Reflect dark silhouette
On flickering snow
