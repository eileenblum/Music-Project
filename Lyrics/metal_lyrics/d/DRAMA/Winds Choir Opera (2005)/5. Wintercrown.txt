Immortal solitude in my dark soul
I raise great temples of hard times
My mind is clean from interdiction
And emptiness is reigning by my heart

Oh, Winter! I am your blood-brother
Your majesty and power are absolutely
Mother Blizzard, Father Frost, I will hear
I'll hear your burial song of eternity

On frozen fields and frozen lakes your sign
In frozen woods and frozen mountains your might

In this time I enthrone my freedom
In this time! Oh, severe winter
I open thy soul to your kingdom
And my mind will dance in snowstorm
