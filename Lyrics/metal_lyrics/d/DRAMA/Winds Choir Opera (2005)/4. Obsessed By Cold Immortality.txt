Mirk and silence, time waiting for sunrise
Was groaning from pain
I was looking at the moon by bewitched eyes
Full of tears of delight

Noise of waves breaking over rocks
Was shaking the greatness of silence night
And wind was carrying clouds, hardly closing face of Moon
These instants found aeon under moonlight

I've remained alone with twilights silence
Queen surrounded forest with silver light
She comes immortal goddess
Mother of winter forest, Princess of night

Cold Night... She takes away my mind,
By carrying away unto shadows' space which haven't time
This night will last eternally,
While wolves wail, they summon She

Suddenly I've turned and Moon has made a circle
I have passed eternity with the Twilight Queen.

They serve faithfully, they worship to the Twilight Queen
They require new victim, they are thirsty blood and flesh
And I among them, among creatures of night
I wander in darkness, far from new day's light
As well as centuries ago. When the haze wind round hills,
When the forests cover by  darkness my strength revives
Wild blood warms up muscles, numbed by cold
Claws teethe in expectation of fight, anticipating flesh
