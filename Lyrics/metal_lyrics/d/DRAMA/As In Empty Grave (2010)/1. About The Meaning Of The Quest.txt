we was dumb
when the blizzard was knocking us down
we was deaf
when the heart was crying out in pain

the questions was falling down into our hands
from height which was reached not by us

we were blind
when we've cognized the meaning of the quest
when everything
we're searching for was so near

we were the foliage and the tree was not holding us
when the wind of the tragedies has blown

when the sound in silence was necessary only
we were avaricious on words
when everything we're searching for
was lying down in our hands
but even at that time we were staying dead

when night was bringing the rest
and soul was reaching to the heights
the question was falling down into our hands
from the height which was reached not by us
