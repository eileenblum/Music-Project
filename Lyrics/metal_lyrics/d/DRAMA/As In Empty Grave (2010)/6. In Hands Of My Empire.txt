enlighten the existence's dark enigma
enrage yourself and fight,enslave and shred
lunit moon keeps the mystic luminescence
sibylline words of ancient autumn wil never be spread

where all dimensions fall and time becomes the pain
when the ancient anthems are unsung
my internal world opens and my old throne unveils
the dark path through the naked tunnel to my coldest sun

i wonder how they can exist unter the false light
ice-cold downpour and storming hate will crush their dreams of life
i wonder how they all can breathe while the forests are on fire
mankind between the devil and the deep blue sea

in hands of my empire

enlighten the existence's dark enigma
enrage yourself and fight,enslave and shred
lunit moon keeps the mystic luminescence
sibylline words of ancient autumn wil never be spread
