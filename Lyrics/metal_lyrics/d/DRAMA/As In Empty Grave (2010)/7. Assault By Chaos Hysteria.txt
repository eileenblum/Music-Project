how can't they hear the echoes of fallen ones
don't hide in the depths of the dull mass
you can have the strenghts and mind - reload your gun
the sick ones of your evil bless you

assault by chaos hysteria

looking back through the vistas of the past
you could not feel the poisoned future's dust
abysmal chaos, madness, absurdity, hysteria of mind
stop the one-way in the time of lie

assault by chaos hysteria

come forth lifeless but open-eyed
blood-stained but yet so clear
be immortal guide for the blinded kind

how can't they hear the echoes of fallen ones
don't hide in the depths of the dull mass
abysmal chaos, madness, absurdity, hysteria of mind
stop the one-way in the time of lie

lick unto shape your possession, turn loose your wrath
