slowly i open the door feeling a thin side
night has fixed on me her thousand hungry eyes
and vacuum around...
chaos of broken prayers cuts my flesh
with disgust i spit it out
i nass, i see the way out - the gates to the outside...

hell inside - salvation outside...

burning out with flame of sin
ornament of incomprehensive
i rush in raging stream
of my hidden hell
and night throws me in thousand abysses
but i rise again in winds of comsic sea

hell inside - salvation outside...

irae nominem tui

tearing apart the aura of soul
tearing apart the flesh of revived
let my hell be full...
hell inside - salvation outside...

open, oh night, this last boundary
i can see the lifeless astral sea
open, oh chaos, this eternity
tear my flesh and drink my soul
make me one with cold shine of night
let me be the wrath of your names

hell inside - salvation outside...
