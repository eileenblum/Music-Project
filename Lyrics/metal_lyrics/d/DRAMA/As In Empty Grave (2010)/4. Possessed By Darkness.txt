light has struck me in the eyes
feeling stench of burning flesh
captured by fire ones again
i summon the beast to rule

possessed by darkness
not lost but eternal
possessed by void
calling for the endelessness of cold

take your time to bring the day closer
become deceased in waiting
phantom of hunger is calling you
you are the one flame out of the light

possessed by darkness
not lost but eternal
possessed by void
reaping the cornfield of death

temple is destroyed, we're on march
shadow will poison all around
light shall devour only my flesh
without taking quintessence

possessed by darkness
the sinful flame has risen
possessed by void
the night of blasphemy has come
