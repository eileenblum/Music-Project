the cold has burst to me
i've understood - it's death
she's come with heavy steps
to reap
to take everything away
to take the grain of life and soul
forever

the darkness pecks my eyes
i'm thrown into the abyss
no doubt
around me the emptiness
is shedding the reflections of salvation

where does she carry me
i've not been in need of this world
i've cursed the eternity
and with steel hand
she is pressing my heart

distant horizon
top of the world
behind my eyes
but just a wind
lashes my face
empty, cold and lonely

to fall from the tops
of rocks of mine
i was staying on the bluff
for a along time
the cold brook of life
has dried in my eyes

only hopelessness frightens me
empty thoughts of end
my cup is full
and i go bleeding,
shedding my life

it became colder
the pain has passed and
i feel the breath of sorrow
just a one moment
and silence will come
