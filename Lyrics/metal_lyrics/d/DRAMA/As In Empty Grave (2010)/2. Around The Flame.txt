try to realize you could not realize before
behold now mountains belch the poison lava on the earth
try to perceive the chaos theorem, destruction law
to all your questions i'm the thesaurus

tremble with the fear before me, i'm the conqueror
kneel and bow to me like lamb to the slaughter
i demolish theories to create my own
thou sowed the wind then reap the whirlwind

you found your only way, your life is error

the roots of hate and scorn are growing
who will dare to cool the boiling blood
the icy chains of humanity already are thawing
hail the anthems of twilight of the gods

just think what death will be in days of chaos cold
just think what life will be in nights of nifelheim frost

i'm possessed with madness, i'm obscure, i am unlight
and i shall create a knock-down drag-out fight
i'll not tell you anything else! have your cross to bear
the heavens will open with your blood, with pain and suffering

i annihilate the earth and all therein you've made
the howl of my wind sounds the death knell to existence
you are the moths around the lfame
you've found the regard action
