line of ages ends in pain
between the night and the day
behind the life and the death
the veil on the eyes, the ashes in the breath

spell of winds, prophecies of myths
come forth to me apocalypse
filthy stones of wastes
and still the thorn creeps in the veins

thousands of never-ending winters
i want this time to come
glowing thorns of cosmic chaos
will eclipse the dying sun

meaningless existence as in empty grave
smell the venom in the air
and feel inside you the stream of poison blood
this age is full of stench of realm of rats

line of ages ends in pain
between the night and the day
behind the life and the death
and still the thorn creeps in the veins
