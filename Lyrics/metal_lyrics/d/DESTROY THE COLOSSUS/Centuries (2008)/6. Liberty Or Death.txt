I need a coma more than anything.
But I am afraid of the dreams please no.
Separate me from everything separate me from everyone.
Drifting away from torture free your mind brain yourself.
I am longing for a heart so cold it kills.
All the soulless creatures prey upon the mind.
Bring this world down bring it down.
Destroyer bringing the dead back to life open your mind.
Here there be tigers here there be saviours.

My God give me your heart tonight.
The Judge strikes down his gavel.
Give me all of your love for.
Here there be tigers here there be saviours free at last!
