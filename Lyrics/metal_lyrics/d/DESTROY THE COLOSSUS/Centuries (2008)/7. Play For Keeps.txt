Play For Keeps!
This is indictment for this corruption you've laid upon the table.
You decide that you hate all that I've become.
I decide that its time for you to fucking die.
You're just a fucking waste of flesh until your ever lasting last breath.
I will not bend.

Please please wake me up from this nightmare.
I will put you six feet under and you will not forget my face and I hope you suffocate inside.
Cry. Cry all you want this time its payback, bitch. I will not fail.
You can lie there dead in a box. I play for keeps.
