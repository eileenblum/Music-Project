Terrorize them all because its an all out war.
Take no prisoners kill them all.
Give it all you got it's a massacre.
We're on the edge of fucking war.
Bring the storm for I am the ocean.
Bring the pain for I am alive.
Have no fear you aren't going to need it.
Push us and defy us we will take everything from you.
Chaos begins to spread we will strike.

I am the ultimate destruction. I am the ocean vengeance is mine.
On the edge of war.
Chaos begins to spread on the edge of war.
Prepare for the massacre your blood will stain the battlefield.
Vengeance is mine, dear boy vengeance is mine.

You have no chance for survival.
The designs of war have been borne unto this.
The designs of war have sealed your fate.
We'll tear you to fucking pieces your family won't be able to recognize your face prepare for the massacre.
The designs of war have been borne unto this and sealed your fate.
We'll tear you limb from limb and this place you call home will be ours.
