Fly fly my child from love into hate in mere moments.
Fly my child try to understand why these situations have lead me to burn.
Lead me to burn and I sit against this Charyou tree.
And I burn well this is how its going to be.
But it ain't how its going to end.

Satisfied for nothing for nothing my eyes have seen seen their share.
It isn't nothing I won't fight for well this is how its going to feel when I take my fucking power fist right between your scurvy eyes.
And as the blood rains down it will drench all of your enemies.
This is for all those who fight for your honour never give up
