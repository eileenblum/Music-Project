Death, but not for you, Gun Slinger.
Steel grabbing steel, they are smoking.
Iron seizing iron, they are bleeding.
O Father tear it up, you are the one to bring them down.
Tear it up, you are the one to save us all.
Tear it up. Charyou Tree I want you to kill them all kill them all.

Bullets will only prolong your pain I do not aim with my eye. I aim with my hand
I do not shoot with my hand. I shoot with my mind
I do not kill with my gun. I kill with my heart
Chaos in this land of Discordia, remember the forgotten face of your father
