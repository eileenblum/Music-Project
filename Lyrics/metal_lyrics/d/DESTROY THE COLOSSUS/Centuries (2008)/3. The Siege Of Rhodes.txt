Take up your arms, men the fight is coming to us.
Defend yourself defend your honour.
Laying siege to the city of Rhodes.
Hold the line hold this line.
Leave no survivors leave no one alive.
God grant me true aim.

Sever their heads and impale them on the spikes.
They will never leave this city.
Build up the walls burn down the bridges.
No way in but no way out.
Defend yourself brace yourself defend your honour, men.
Brace yourself defend your country, men
We have suffered we have conquered.
We will build it Colossus.
