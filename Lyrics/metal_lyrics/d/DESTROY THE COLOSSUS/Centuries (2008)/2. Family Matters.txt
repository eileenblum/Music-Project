All will pay heed to rotting corpses
They walk they walk with a curse
Nothing satisfies none shall take the prize
Worlds worlds collapsing give me light
Give me haven outstretched arms beckon you beckon me
Scream death is only time blood is the new skin.
Hand meets flesh meets earth meets mouth blood is the new skin

They will be torn up and eaten alive horror plagues deep within eyes
Transfixed on those of a hungry dead decomposing man eating all that shimmers from my heart
He is so familiar, so familiar he is my flesh he is my blood take me home
