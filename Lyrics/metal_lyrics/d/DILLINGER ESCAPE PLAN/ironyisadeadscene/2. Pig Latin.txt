Do you remember where you were on that day?
A day of life sentences and x-rays
My name was on that birthday cake

[Chinga]
Your mother, your father, your brother, and the thing under the covers
Your lover, the others, the leeches, and the serpents and the suckers
Your mother, your father, the babies and the nurses and the doctors
Your lover, the others, the waiting room, the gurney and the druggers
Your mother, your father, the comas and the way the spirits hover
Your lover, the others, I thought I wasn't smart enough to suffer

Speaking pig latin
Kiss me goodnight
Dreaming white satin
Kiss me goodnight

Freedom---tying your legs down
Freedom---fucking your brains out
Freedom---blowing the candles out
Freedom---waving to the crowd

And I hate long goodbyes anyway...
