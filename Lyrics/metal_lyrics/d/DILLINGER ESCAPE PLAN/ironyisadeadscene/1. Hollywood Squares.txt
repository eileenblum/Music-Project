Game over, you win.
Game over, I win.

The Sleigh bells are a-ringing, the children they are singing
The memories are fleeting, a little game of {Paper, Scissors, Rock}

The wedding Bells are ringing, the shotgun is a-singing
Now (?) your fingers steady, a little game of {Paper, Scissors, Rock}

A lion tamer yelling, your first piano lesson
A 4--leaf contraceptive, we play a game of {Paper, Scissors, Rock}

A sweaty palm reading, a lucky shot of whiskey
Now come and rub my belly, a little game of {Paper, Scissors, Rock}

O's and X's
Hollywood Squares
X's and O's
Bloody Tic-Tac-Toe

Not in your song
I'm not your singer
Not in your poem
I'm not your stanza
I'm not a color in your rainbow
But now which team
Are you rooting for?

We're Hollywood Squares
We're going nowhere

I'm an' 'X'
You're an 'O'

And this is the end...

The End.
