And now i'll hang my skin, this skin.
Transparent words of sin, my love so sweet.
Your name looks so good distorted like that.
Scrape off some skin, revealing crud, an hour
Before dark i'm walking through the rain and
Scratching on her window screen. i've come to
Cut cupid's heart out. i've come to take your
Breath away. break the door down. knock
The door down. angel i can't let you in.
Sundripped devil scratched out my eyes.
