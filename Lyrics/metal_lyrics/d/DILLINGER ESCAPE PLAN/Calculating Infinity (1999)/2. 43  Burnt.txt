I smell that whore. bring me back. bring me a brick.
Take my bottle and break it. pour it all out. i pushed
You too far. self absorb that pity. i want to knock you
Off your horse. i just feel it, everything is fine. spit on
Yourself, you're so beautiful. crack and chip off like
The sun won't shine down. take your medicine like a
Champ, while that sting can last a million years. self
Absorb that utopia so bad, i just feel it.
