Fill holes, dig hills forever gazing at backdoors. for once in a
Life, it's coming in inspired by our attraction. what we smell,
Bitter sweet pleasure. one phone call. one fine line of prison.
The walk. the smell. the spoiled. backdoor honey please come
Home. such a shame to throw away. don't you fucking spill it.
Avoid that, the best feeling possible. yes we do obsess.

From the liner notes:

The Dillinger Escape Plan would like to thank the people that have 
helped/supported us along the way, including all of the bands, labels, 
promoters, etc. Thanks to Andreas Minakakis, Paul Delia, Chris Tropea, and 
Mike Dodd for technical support. Special thanks to our families, Tom 
Apostolopoulos, and Suzie Bueno for their support from the start.

Sometimes words just can't express exactly how we feel. The deep complexity 
of our emotions is something I've always felt was better conveyed in song.  
Sometimes we are put into a situation that we don't always know how to deal 
with quite right. Here's my attempt at letting you know how I feel. All I 
can offer is my deepest thanks to everyone who sent a card, everyone who 
wrote about the situation in a zine, did a show, donated money at a show, or 
offered their sympathy to what amounts to be a stranger. You always put a 
smile on this cynical asshole's face and helped me get through the hardest 
year of my life. I hope I'll be seeing all of you soon.   Adam Doll
