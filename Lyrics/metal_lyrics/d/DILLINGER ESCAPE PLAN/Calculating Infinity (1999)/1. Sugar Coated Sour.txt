What rounding out breaks the silent barrier waiting
And waiting. can i pick your modest waste? i expect
No more than a simple regret. did i stutter, what? did
I stutter. yeah, you deserved it and you earned it.
Take a bow you deserve it. eat shit you earned it life
Would be so much better if you did not exist. and god
Bless you fucking queen. what pawns we have
Become in this bland little play: sugar. coated. sour.
