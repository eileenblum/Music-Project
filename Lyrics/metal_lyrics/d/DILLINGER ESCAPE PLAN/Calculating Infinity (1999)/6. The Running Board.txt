Soft fade circled around. turn loose goodbye. no
Attempt to look failure is king. are we ready?
Close those lips. try to lose me 3 more times,
Hush baby now don't say a word. 6:63 and
Where are you? run home, run far, throw your
Face in a pillow. screa out what you can't.
Fix that make up cover your tracks yeah you're
An angel. avoiding what games to play. was it
''less or more or more or less''? coward wisk
Away the fear. clean the air and jump. slide
Closer to the edge. say good night. it's the final
Curtain call. switch off, goodbye.
