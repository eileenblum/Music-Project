The chain linked fence surrounds the feeble child. gag your
Mouth, to hear sweet melodies. lifted your hand to swing the
Chair pounding my brain. love her and tell her, fuck her and
Smell her. don't fall for it, don't fall for me. fall child. one more
Thing, just one more time. kiss my lips and make me fly. i told
You not to fall for it.
