trapped infancy
what was lost in you
found in solitude
I've seen that all the fun and games
aren't that fair to play
I've seen that all the fucking games
aren't that fun to play

you should say everything you wanna say
leave nothing unspoken for the early grave
still you stay frozen when you need to leave
it's only through death or love that we'll be free

death or love and we'll be free

a fortress crumbles from inside
no fix when you're building on the broken
and happiness is just a smile

there's no way to replace the absence that grew cold like a sunset
finally there's a glimpse of light cracking over the dark once illuminated
