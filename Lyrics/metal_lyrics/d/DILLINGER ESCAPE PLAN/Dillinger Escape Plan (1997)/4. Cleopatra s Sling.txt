I've masked myself so long
so why have you nursed these tears
and now it seems so clear
the life you gave is broken
ugly humans round up razorblades
taste that steel
cold to the touch
warm to your tongue
cut it out
to speak evil
god how will i defend
to mother her
hands will wrap around your neck
she'll kiss you and call you ugly
it's O.k.
we'll just kill her too
