Ravaged skies
rain
did you forget
have you forgotten
liar
did you forget
cause it's not over yet
cheat
the digital reads
20to2
and the radio is screaming
static
rather burn you than love you
but i won't be fooled
into dreaming of parks
that breathe
instead
I'll have sweet nightmares of you
these days are over
I've turned the page
and burned the book
charcoal circles
around your eyes
no regrets
right!
