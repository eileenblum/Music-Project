I made a big mistake
With you tonight
The way our insides burned
Like moths flying to the light
As the sun begins to set I cannot find my way back
Walking with my eyes on fire I never found the payback
I know the games we play
Give us a way
A way for us to see if we still feel alive
We'll never feel like anything is wrong
The tragedy is not just our own sad song
Walls we have built and bridges we have burned
Deeper the hole the farther we feel from harm
Time is always right behind us
Like the lamb under the gun
I'll hold on to this forever
This is never long enough
