Drag the knife across the skin
tempted to succumb
carving fervor into flesh
holy weâve become
turning lips to everyone
giving heart to none
running backwards erasing time
seek the fire but never die

the cradle wipes blood red fresh
and through you the host has chosen a name
the cradle wipes blood red fresh
and through you the host has chosen a name
call the name out
call the name out
call the name out
call the name out

Iâll never be like you
late to my own funeral
Iâll never be like you
late to my own funeral
weâll never be so late like you to our funerals
Iâll never be like you
late to my own funeral
weâll never be so late like you to our funerals

push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages into the world
push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages to other worlds
push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages into the world
push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages to other worlds

push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages into the world
push decay inside me for then I can open all the passages to other worlds
