Youâre an image pale that points and laughs
White mistress in a fiery bath
Now tie me down and take me home
Iâm not afraid to go
Now tie me down and take me home
Iâm not afraid to go

[Pre-chorus:]
Shake the roots off the trees
Your conscience fades
Eyes have no vision to see
Your soul degrades
Grey follows in front of me
Youâve lost your way
Every life is but a death to me

[Chorus:]
Eventually the jokes arenât free and
Nothingâs ever fun and
Nothingâs funny

[Verse 2:]
Blunt self believe, too big to fall
Lead shadow stands just inches tall
I hope to God you never die
Your joke is just my type

[Pre-chorus:]
Shake the roots off the trees
Your conscience fades
Eyes have no vision to see
Your soul degrades
Grey follows in front of me
Youâve lost your way
Every life is but a death to me

[Chorus:]
Eventually the jokes arenât free and
Nothingâs ever fun and
Nothingâs funny

But now I see that the jokeâs on me and
Nothingâs ever fun and
Nothingâs funny

Donât be scared
Donât be scared
Donât be scared
Donât be scared
Donât be scared

[Chorus:]
Eventually the jokes arenât free and
Nothingâs ever fun and
Nothingâs funny

But now I see that the jokeâs on me and
Nothingâs ever fun and
Nothingâs funny

Your joke is just my type
