I just could not believe
that so much could be achieved
are you for real?
were you for real?
I caught you by the throat
and tried to squeeze
but you weren't real
you were not real

turn your boat you stow away
itâs better there hereâs not okay
Iâm sorry itâs so far away
you break your back for little things
like compliments and wedding rings
I hate that little song you sing
that song you sing

[Chorus:]
turn your boat you stow away
itâs better there hereâs not okay
Iâm sorry youâre far away

turn your boat around you stow away

seems you canât stop making sound
but nothing I canât read about
your 2 cents fall right on the ground
right on the ground

[Chorus:]
turn your boat you stow away
itâs better there hereâs not okay
Iâm sorry itâs so far away

turn your boat around you stow away

I just could not believe
so much could be achieved
are you for real?
were you for real?
cause you donât listen
you never listen
you donât listen
you donât listen
I've caught you by the throat and tried to squeeze
but you weren't real
you were not real
whyâd I never listen

[Chorus:]
turn your boat you stow away
itâs better there hereâs not okay
Iâm sorry weâre so far away
Iâm sorry weâre so far away
Iâm sorry weâre so far away
