You will never find anything
like a forest in search of its trees
you will never gain anything
take a bullet to kill a wet dream

I will always be anything
like a shadow inside of a cave
I can never give anything
break a sweat just to have some relief

you were always revolting me
like an echo held up to my face
you were always in search of me
takes a second to find what you seek

I will never give anything
break a sweat just to have some relief
I will always be everything
like a shadow inside of a cave

[Chorus:]
I feel you close, heating up my coals
but there isnât a hell that I would burden with you
death brings us close, isnât that morose?
but there isnât a fire that I would waste to burn you

we are both just a fantasy
wonât you please keep imagining me

youâve become such a piece of me
always were work that I couldnât see
I will never give anything
break a sweat just to have some relief
I will always be everything
like a shadow inside of a cave

[Chorus:]
I feel you close, heating up my coals
but there isnât a hell that I would burden with you
death brings us close, isnât that morose?
but there isnât a fire that I would waste to burn you

Iâll be with you when you die
always by your side holding onto nights
howâd we let this go so far
cause I donât know where we are
bring it back to life

Iâll be with you when you die
always by your side holding onto nights
weâll try to hold the earth still
howâd we ever get this far
cause I donât know where we are
bring it back to my beginning
your beginning

I could just go to sleep but I wanna scream
Iâd wake you up but then youâd see what I mean

Iâve manifested you in fever daydream

[Chorus:]
I feel you close, heating up my coals
but there is a hell that I would burden with you
death brings us close, isnât that morose?
but there is a fire that I would waste to burn you
