she moves abstract just
like a shadow dancing on the edge
like a storm cloud passing overhead
effort-less and free
as the hours rush by
through her I can sense the end of time
thereâs no way this can forever shine
make the sun not rise

[Chorus:]
in the air we tried to be
but you shot your arrow through me
now one of us must die
but the killer wonât survive

she moves abstract just
like a shadow dancing on the edge
like a storm cloud passing overhead
hypnotizing me
as the hours rush by
through her I can sense the end of time
stretch into eternity divine
and the sun wont rise 

[Chorus:]
in the air we tried to be
but you shot your arrow through me
now one of us must die
but the killer wonât survive

in the air we tried to be
but you shot your arrow through me
now one of us must die
but the killer wonât survive
and the killer wonât survive
survive
survive

[Chorus:]
in the air we tried to be
but you shot your arrow through me
now one of us must die
but the killer wonât survive

in the air we tried to be
but you shot your arrow through me
now one of us must die
and the killer wonât survive
and the killer wonât survive
