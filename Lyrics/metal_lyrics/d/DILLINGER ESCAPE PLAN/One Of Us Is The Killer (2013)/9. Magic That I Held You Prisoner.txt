out of the vile
I can see you hold the grace infinite
shine out the dark miracle
felt you reaching out
caught you as we were both falling down down

we were tricked and scared stiff
from the clock that ticks slow laughing
take this gift for nothing donât feel shame
sordid salted eyes slow burning from outside
closed swollen drop your shield
start searching donât look far

you had to be an angel stripped like Abel
out to burn for everyone
but still there is a glowing unconsumed that grows new
all of the stars meant to shine
but when falling mesmerize
donât look away stop and stare to catch your reflection
and move on to the light
for you deserve
you donât have to burn for anyone

you hold grace you canât see
a self that is no self
no shell depicts a true projection
caught you as we fell
now shine out the light from the dark
