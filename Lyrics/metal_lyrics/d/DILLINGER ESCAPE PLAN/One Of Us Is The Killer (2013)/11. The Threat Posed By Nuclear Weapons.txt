I spoke to the sky but God was silent because I knew
so easy to be rolled into a tomb
stripped of all desires
so easy to be
so easy to be rolled into a tomb
so easy to be rolled into a tomb
into a tomb
old tears spice the soil
new taste to pave the path
my medium

we were so compelled but I shoot when I saw you were the âIâ recognize
now that itâs cold and the core never thaws I found you to keep me alive

please run far and go faster
Iâm a cancer for your life so leave
but still youâre weaving your hair into rags

fast-forward to far away
weâve never changed
we just need to stalk our prey to make us stay
weâre fucking spiders spinning to pass the time
soul dividers eating our kind alive
you child donât you go forgetting mistakes or theyâll keep reliving
marrow numbered you awakened
now letâs burn this we created.


Thanks to sean-lp-rock for correcting track #7 lyrics.
