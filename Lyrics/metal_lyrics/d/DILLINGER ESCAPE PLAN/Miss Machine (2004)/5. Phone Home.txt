Take fire out of heaven's clenched fist
Cracks slip between my desire to keep your broken heart bleeding
Just hold tight and tell another fucking joke to pacify the urge for suicide
You know it won't keep waiting
So say, "Goodbye." 'cause I never want to hear another word about, "You and I..."
You know you never stop...

Now

We started out just running out spreading like wings and we are one
I pulled you right out of the gutter when I could have b-lined
We started out just running out spreading like wings and what were we supposed to do?
You belong to me and what were we supposed to do?

Suck it in -- spit it out -- you know that two's a crowd?
Expectant mother's stillborn baby beauty cries aloud and tries you what I'm about
Now don't you worry about a little thing like this
It only hurts just a bit I promise
I'm going take you a mile high
So don't you cry 'cause it'll be just "baby, baby, baby..." non-stop until the end of the night
So keep your mouth shut

We started out just running out spreading like wings and we are one
I pulled you right out of the gutter when I could have b-lined
We started out just running out spreading like wings and what were we supposed to do?
You belong to me and what were we supposed to do?

I can tell you're a good fuck just by the way you wear that innocent look
Don't you know that enough is never enough
I made you -- now you are property I can't discard

We started out just running out spreading like wings and what were we supposed to do?
