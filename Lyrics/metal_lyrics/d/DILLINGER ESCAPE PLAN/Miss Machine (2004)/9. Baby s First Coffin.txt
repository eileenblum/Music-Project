Dear god
Protect us
Come on
Blackest heart

She stares
Forever and then
Some never again

Polished barbed-wire
Smile
Tricks and treats

She's done
So cut her again
Gut her again

Dear God
Protect us
Come on
Blackest...

Silence tells us we're damned
Silence tells us we're damned

Jesus, we've gone and done it again
Jimmy's got a new gun in his hand
Jesus, we've gone and done it again
Jimmy's got a new gun in his hand

You're being a liar
You're being a liar
You're being a liar
You're being a liar

How could you doubt
We would never find out
You're being a liar
I'm stealing the show
You're being a liar
I'm ready to go...

You're being a liar
You're being a liar
You're being a liar
You're being a liar

How could you doubt
We would never find out
You're being a liar
I'm stealing the show
You're being a liar
I'm ready to go... home

The emperor is dead
The emperor is dead
Goodbye... to god

Dead...
So long...
Embrace...
Defeat...
You know we both agreed to it

Stick the diamond to it
Gust of wind to the face
Never returning favors
Take the prison to the man
I could promise the world if we could travel through time
Don't back out on me now
Relax and remember the promise of the sign
I wish you could see yourself now
You look at me like a child
The way you glide across the room
Instrument of seduction
Let go of it
Rapunzel, let it down
Wait for the signal then bring it down with a smile
Now...
Become the conductor
The way you slide across the room
How wonderful the connection
Did the last kiss still taste as good as the first?
Or is this just the opening scene of a new play
I look at you like a child
But not at all like you looked at me

But grace is already dead
Now is the time to come and face the master
You should never say yes
The grace is already dead
Now is the time to come and face the master
Grace is already dead
The grace is already dead
Now is the time to come and face the master
You should never say yes when you really mean no
