Is the can half-diseased or is the disease half-canned?
And is the man half-machine or is the machine half-man?
I'm unretrofied for you

Is the can half-diseased or is the disease half-canned?
And is the man half-machine or is the machine half-man?
I'm unretrofied for you

So come on...
So come on...

I'll just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song and leave dead in the end
Time is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again

Now they're looting our holes until there is nothing left
Calloused intentions it seemsâcoward's inventionâat best
I'm unretrofied for you

Now they're looting our holes until there is nothing left
Calloused intentions it seemsâcoward's inventionâat best
I'm unretrofied for you

So come on...
So come on...

I'll just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song and leave dead in the end
Time is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again

We're all dead

Jesus can't play the music 'caused he's nailed to the cross
And over gnawed-off feetÂ I find that I can't walk
I can't walk
I can't... even walk

I'll just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song and leave dead in the end
Time is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again

I'll just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song and leave dead in the end
Time is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again

We're all dead

I'll...
