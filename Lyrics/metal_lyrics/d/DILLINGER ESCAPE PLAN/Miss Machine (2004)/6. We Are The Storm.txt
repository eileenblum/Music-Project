Well they said we'd tear ourselves apart
And it...Â turns out they were right
'Cause I've never seen you so weak
Weak... and... so far
Out of breath
And I never saw the tide rise
So high
So fast

Watch...Â This pawn capture the queen
White... picket drive-by
Gar...gle the stench the storm brings

You'll never get enough
Watch... this pawn capture the queen
Yeah...
Now... I can't shake you
But I... I can't take you
Empty skin bag
You're my cum rag
And now the flood gates overflow
Now I see that too much is not enough
No...

This game...
Has been playing...
For... too... long...

Yeah...
Yeah you did it
Yeah you did it
Woah...
Yeah you did it
Did you get enough?
My sweet child of... fire
This love affair is so... lost
This love affair is so... lost

Cut through the sea
This pendulum swingsÂ near to me
We are the storm
So take your ship to port

Oh, it's time to let it goÂ (Time to let it go)
Right now it's time to let it go
Time to let it go-oh-woah-oh-woah-oh-woah-oh

'Cause this feels like half a million years
And I know you feel the same way...Â I do
Don't you?
Do you?

Well they said we'd tear ourselves apart
Turns out... they were right
Tear ourselves apart
Turns out... they were right
