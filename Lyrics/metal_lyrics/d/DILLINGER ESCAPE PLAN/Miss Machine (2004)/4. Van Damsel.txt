Surprise!
It's not what you thought
As it runs...
It runs a dead stop light
As it runs...
It runs a dead light
You're the fool
And we won't look back

Let's tie those ankles... to the... railroad
Don't stop to catch your breath

I bet your foresight... never... saw this...
Train wreck is right on time

A fucking punk
A fucking punkÂ rock
You fucking punk
You fucking punk
You prostitute
You fucking punk
You fucking punk rock
You fucking punk...Â prostitute

Pick the open vein to shreds
You should know that you're my... death... wish...
Bible-thumping, steeple fuck
You are the worst of all scum
Train wreck... right-on-time
You're my death wish

Yeah...

We were young and
We were god
Far away...Â from us now
We don't want it
What you've got
We don't want it
We don't want it
We don't want it
We don't want it
And you've got it
She took my hand
She took my hand
But I never took hers
