First off
Let me say you look so tired...
Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty... ambition
Blankets the sky
I'mÂ Thinking 'bout another world... toni-i-i-ight

Yeah right
Yeah right
Yeah right

So drop the gown
The game's over
Just push your face into the fight
And it breaks my heart
Like dancing up all night
Ride so high we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong
Like nothing we've ever... felt before-ore-ore-ore

Yeah right
Yeah right
Yeah right

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys in the back of every street
Close your eyes...
Tonight!

Baby you can have it
Baby... you can... have it

Oh, baby gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well, there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'Cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star...
Of my very last show

Let's go for a long ride
I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys in the back of every street
Stranger's candy...
Broken alleys...
Yeah...
Tonight!

We could... bring it all down
We could... bring it... all down

They think this body's a dead... note
Dancing... to the beat
But they'll never see this corpse
Coming...Â 'til it... kills them
