Cry your eyes bloodshot
While there's still time
'Cause soon it's gone
And you'll be so shocked

One queen-sized coffin
That was built for two
Is your death... bed
It belongs to you

Tease me, baby
Please me... with the fresh disease
Hope riding on a bullet
Alive tonight
You know we couldn't get it right
Come save... your life tonight
You know we'll never get it... right

Don't try to swim... to shore
Because you can't... go back

Say three words
Like they're the last you'll speak
Curtains drop
Concealing appearances of heaven

Destroyer!
There'll be another
Just... like... you...
You're not the only one
I'm not the only one
Destroyer!
Watching the fallout... fly... back... up...
Walking where time stands still
See how this love... kills

Love kills...
Love kills...

Dropping
Curtains down
Concealing
Appearances of heaven

Without my existence
You are... nothing
Without my affection
You wilt...
You wilt...

We fucked like a nuclear war
Release...
Fuck off...

See how I let you down
Watching
Fallout
Fly back up
