Mo...tions... that make gods cringe
Running in... cir...cles
As fast as we can
Take what you can 'cause now it's all over
Run hot and cold to break the skin
Break the skin

Oooorah!

And we won't take no for... an answer
For just when the door slams
The pill drops
Oh, my sweet unknowing partner
The perfect design

The... pill... drops...
So start the silent dance...Â slumping silhouette
Unforgiving hands... harboring regret
Play it just once more, for old times

Yeah....
You know...
You know...
You know you're all I ever wanted
Yeah....
You know...
You know...
You know...
You know you're all I'll ever want

How... we... laughed when we first saw each other
How... you... screamed when I saw your eyes melt
This... is... the end of every rainbow
And now... your face... shatters
Every... waking... second...
And now... your face... shatters
Every... waking... second...
And now... your face... shatters
