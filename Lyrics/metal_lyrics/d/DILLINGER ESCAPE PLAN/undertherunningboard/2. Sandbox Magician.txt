now who's the fool?
strip it off
and scale the wall
i am the mask
that talks inside the concrete flesh
i am the king
now tell me nothing
i am the fool for a day
concrete playground
hides the valley
make me the king
so i can strip it off
who is the fool today?
friend?
a new idea 
from your stagnant mind
and you must always
fall before the clown
i can beat you
i can cheat you
can
i
be you?
