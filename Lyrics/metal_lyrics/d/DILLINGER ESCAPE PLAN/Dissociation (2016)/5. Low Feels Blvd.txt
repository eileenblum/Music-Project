Lonely in a room of memories from another life
Waiting and chasing moments that elude
Why can't I escape

Waiting and chasing memories of moments that are gone
When first she looked at me
And sipped her drink across from me

Newborn hell was it all along
Right there with me inside reflecting on the outside

If it won't die can I
Some days I look at things as if they never existed
And others it's all right here

I've been thinking aloud about the way it went
I guess we're having a moment right now
Having a moment right now
I guess we're having a moment right now
Having a moment right now

Best of them all
Memories long gone
Lately I'm thinking were they all along

What then becomes of letters never sent
In stillness you can hear us
Never far away
