I'm lying here wondering am I dying inside
Am I diseased I'm feeling pretty weak
My lungs are full of fluid
will they continue to fill?
is this nearly the end?

I used to be so pissed off

Then I forgot
then I erased
Then I just fucking erased you

Not for nothing
I was born so happy
but now it just takes so much to keep me alive

I was born so happy
but now it just takes so much to keep me alive
I thought I'd be better without you
the past is always poison to me

Tried to forget
Tried to erase you

From the rain that never falls
From the wind that blows away from me
From the waves on the other shores
From the taste of air surrounding me

I'm stuck at the corner of how long
I'm stuck at the corner of how long

So hard to be awake
Like hell to fall asleep

Tried to forget,
Tried to forget

So hard to be awake
Like hell to fall asleep

Let me erase,
Let me erase

A time and place
I can't forget, I can't forget
Your face

I can't erase, I can't erase, I can't erase, I can't erase

Claw away at the wound inside
Rip into my flesh to find a light
It's suffocating in here
And it's only me
Come a little bit closer please
