Any thought of moving on
Is a loop without an end back to the beginning

Reliving this over and over and over and over
While everything around me moves
Detached to protect others more than myself
Well, I'm afraid of how this ends

No comfort in absolutes
No places without time
I am the beginning

Reliving this over and over, and over, and over
While everything around me moves
Detached to protect others more than myself
Well, I'm afraid of how this ends

Reliving this over and over, and over, and over
While everything around me moves
Detached to protect others more than myself
Well, I'm afraid of how this ends

Now a monumental waste

I refuse to be a crutch for your disease
I refuse to carry on your tragedy
I refuse...

All your secrets
Never shared
Programmed into me

All your secrets
Never shared
Programmed into me

Well, I'm afraid of how this ends
I never thought such things before
Ignorance is indeed bliss
And knowledge isn't just power
It's torture
I see you trying to get to me
But I'm alone even in the most crowded room
Screaming inside like an animal
Inside confused and scared

Trying to survive in this place
Over and over, and over

Trying to survive this place
Over and over

Trying to survive this place
Over and over, and over

Trying to survive this place
Over and over
