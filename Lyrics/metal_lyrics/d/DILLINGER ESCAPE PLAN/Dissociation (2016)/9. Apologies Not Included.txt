I'm finding nothing
No point just energy to burn
A pocketful of pointless and faded days

What have you done
This never-ending heart attack
Is spilling over self murderous assault

Late hours turn to blur
A boiling inner temperature

Late hours turn to blur
A boiling inner temperature
This never-ending murderous assault
Late hours turn to blur

Crowned waves torrid sea washing years over me
Myself into a knot in sudden overdose
Myself into a knot in sudden overdose

Someone is moving but who is staying still
Or have we grown apart
How selfish of you not to find
You didn't look for peace to gain from being alive

Fuck if I care it doesn't matter
Ignore the more things stay the same
Fuck I don't care the more things never change
I'm not sorry for you
Fuck if don't care it doesn't matter,
Ignore--
I'm not sorry, you didn't look, but

I'm finding nothing
No point just energy to burn
A pocketful of pointless and faded days

Make yourself present are you hiding
Do you feel guilt cause mine's dying
Worked through your waste now there's nothing
But maybe there's still hope
