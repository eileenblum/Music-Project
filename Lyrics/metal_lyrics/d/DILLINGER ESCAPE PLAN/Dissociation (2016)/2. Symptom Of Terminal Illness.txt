To those of you I loved this pains me to lose
I hate to feel used

I'm frightened in sleep thinking my world will be gone
Promise me I won't die
I panic in dreams from when I was still young
Please don't turn on that light I can't see it

To those of you I've lost that pained me to love
Please know that I tried,
Please know that I tried

I'm frightened in sleep thinking my world will be gone
Promise me I won't die
I panic in dreams from when I was still young
Please don't turn on that light I can't see it

Do you really think that I would leave you but I couldn't stand myself so I had to choose
Still you turn me on the wild in your eyes but now I can't trust myself to keep on the light
For us to see with

I'm frightened in sleep thinking my world will be gone
Promise me I won't die
I panic in dreams from when I was still young
Please don't turn on that...
