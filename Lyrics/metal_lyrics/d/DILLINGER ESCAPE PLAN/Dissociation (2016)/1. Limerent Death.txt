I'm amazed at how you'll reinforce your guard
'Cause deep inside you're still a son of a bitch
Mistakes forever haunt you a lie to persecute you
So thoroughly it's giving you fits, it's giving you fits

In your world make believe
No one knows you
Hold your breath count to ten

Peering through a vacant glass
That nothing can hope to ever fill
When movement ceases and everything is still
I thought that time was frozen
Instead my resting state
I thought we'd be forever
What was I to say

You were never alone
You just didn't know
Where to fucking go

But who will hear you fall?
If no one's there at all

Do you...
Are you a-OK?
...feel fine?
Do you wake up smiling?
Do you...
Do you feel alright?
...feel fine?
Are you always shining?

Do you feel fine?
Do you feel fine?
Do you wake up smiling?

I'm amazed at how you'll reinforce your guard
'Cause deep inside you're still a son of a bitch
Mistakes forever haunt you a lie to persecute you
So thoroughly it's giving you fits, it's giving you fits

Giving you fits
Giving you... fits
Giving you fits
Giving you fits
Giving you fits
Giving you fits

I gave you everything you wanted,
You were everything to me
I gave you everything you wanted,
You were everything to me

I gave you everything you wanted,
You were everything to me [9x]
I gave you

In your world make believe
In your world no one loves you
