In a lifeless memory you're not there a craving in the street
I'm alive and getting an urge to fill the void
With whatever I need
With whatever I need
With whatever I need

I withdraw you advance the move is complete
Are you able to see?
'cause it's getting too bright for me
Over time we'll dissolve
To a feeling we won't recall

Bring all your heroes down to their knees
I don't need nothing I do as I please

Destiny overruled through distance
I'm losing creation of your mind
Through distance I'm losing
Through distance I'm losing

All night I've been trying to reach out
How people naturally do when they're young
An attempt to live to feel weightless and free
In the abyss
In the abyss

For a time I felt completely alive
Still without legs we all just sink

In the past I would have tried harder
But now I know
There isn't anything there
And what you, I, we were reaching for
Is something I had in me all along

For a time I felt completely alive
Still without legs we all just sink

We see most clear
From lowest points

We see most clear
From lowest points

We see most clear
From lowest points

Through distance we're losing
Hope for our dignity

Bring all your heroes down to their knees
I don't need nothing I do as I please
