Dark night
Endless night
All consuming, trembling
Legs spread wide

Blood stained
By a thousand deaths
Widowmaker
Undertaker
Takes my hand

She is death courageous
Her soul has pinned in Hell's eternal fire

She is death courageous
Drink the blood from the chalice
Of flesh in her temple

She is death courageous
This me to free myself within her

Dark night
Stalker night
Coiling in the shadows
Of the tree of life

Blood stained
By a thousand deaths
Whore of Eden
Serpent goddess rise
