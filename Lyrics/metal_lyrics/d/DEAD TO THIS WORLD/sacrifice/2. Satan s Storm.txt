Up from the pits of Hell carving through soil
Into the catacombs and out
Arising from the graves to harvest their souls
Bringing death and damnation to all

The whore of the crucifix
Draped in the blood of the abomination of desolation
And from a throne of fire a calling was heard
To gather hordes to the sign of the one

With all the venom from the serpents of our lord
We rise to gather speed
Your children by thy sword forever drawing nearer
Speeding faster through the night
With relentless fury towards the light

For the glory of Satan and powers to be
We walk the dead of night beautifully
And all the angels scattered
Back to their graves
Leaving trails of semen and blood

Towards the throne of fire to receive the truth
Like wolves we gather on Christian youth
And from a harlots grave rise wisdom of few
Waiting, hoping

With all the venom from the serpents of our Lord
We rise to gather speed
Your children by thy sword forever drawing nearer
Speeding faster through the night
With relentless fury towards the light
Drawing nearer

Satan's storm
