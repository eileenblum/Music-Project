Devourer of all, for hers is the glory
Who creates with one hand
And destroys with another
Possess me now
Black serpent goddess
Kundalini ascends
With Lilith's embrace

Speak through me in ecstasy
It is all thou! It is all thou!
With divine flame she entered me
Storming through my veins
Together we shall burn the world
Feast on its remains

High hostess of infernal seals
My body is thy temple
In trade thou shalt reveal
The gates of flesh, unfold for me
Entering through you
Receiving him

Rejoice now in death
So that those oblivious
To thy throne of enlightenment
Shall kneel down before thee
and fall off the edges of the worlds
I have seen the trail
That illuminates the night

Fierce is the truth that poisons the lie
With the blood of the angels
The crown descending
Into the blood drenched soil
Of an atheist offering
Ashes for thee

Devourer of all, for hers is the glory
Who creates with one hand
And destroys with another
Possess me now
Black serpent goddess
Kundalini ascends
With Lilith's embrace
