Ancient rite of Sabbath
Speaks of (an) evil in the wind
That blows from the mouths of
The dead to rise temples within
Those gathered in witching hour
Receivers of truth
Drink the blood from the chalice now
Take the oath, raise the knife

Sacrifice

Pentagram prayer
Candles are burning bright
In this faustian dawn
A gathering to raise the one
To darkness give birth
Under a bleeding moon
A descendant to Earth
Protectors of (greater) evil
Holds the keys of death
Spill the blood on the altar
As above, so below

Out from the shadows and into the light
Rides the legions of doom
Osculum obscenum
Neophyte night
Devouring the flesh for the one

Bringer of torment, the horned emperor
Expulser of evil, receivers of pain
Rides out from the shadows of death
Osculum obscenum
Neophyte night
Devouring the flesh for the one

Evil be thy my good
Reverse for me so I can be
