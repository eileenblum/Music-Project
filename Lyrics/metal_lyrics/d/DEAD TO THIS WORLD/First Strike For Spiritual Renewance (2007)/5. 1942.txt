THE EXECUTION ENDS, ANOTHER ONE LINES UPWE WAIT IN SILENCE ON THE MISTED HILLSWE RAISE OUR BARRELS, AND THE STORY HERE BEGINSTHEY TOOK OUR MEN, BUT LET’S JUST SEE WHO WINSIT WAS A NIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO LAST FOREVERMOREWITH SPLINTERED BONES AND BLEEDINGS WE ARE APPROACHED OUR RANGEA BULLET WITH MY NAME THEN SHOT ME TO THE GROUNDI SAW TWO FEET IN FRONT OF ME, RED CROSS ON HIS ARMMERCENARY:“UNLESS YOU WANT TO DIE NOW, STAND UPRAISE YOUR HEAD, CHARGE YOUR WEAPON INTO WARNEVER GIVE IN TO THE ENEMYKEEP YOUR MIND SET ON YOUR SANITYUNLESS YOU WANT A SHALLOW GRAVE, FIND YOU STRENGTHPICK UP YOUR BULLETS. ON YOUR FEET. BETTER RUNWE NEVER GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT, NEVER WILLBE A SOLDIER. THAT’S AN ORDER, NOW GO!”WITH AMMO IN OUR GUNS AND GRENADE IN OUR HANDSWE LIT THE NIGHT WITH FLAMES SO HIGH. WE FOUGHT OUR WAYCOMBINING STRATEGY WITH A HUNGER FOR THE KILLWE MADE IT THROUGH THE BARRIERS. FIRE IN OUR WILLPILES OF BODIES AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEEA SMELL OF DEATH COMBINES WITH BURNING GASOLINEIT IS A VISION I SHALL BEAR INTO MY GRAVEI’D RATHER TAKE A STAB OR TWO AND HAVE THEM SAVEDWITH ALL THE HATRED IN THIS WORLD, WE SHALL AVENGETHE TWISTED BODIES WHO CANNOT SEEK THEIR REVENGEWE TRIED TO SAVE THEM, (BUT) NOW THE PLAN IS LAID TO WASTEGOT TO FIND THEM, HUNT THEM DOWN WE CAUGHT THEM ONE BY ONE.
