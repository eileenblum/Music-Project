THE CHRISTIAN MYTH PROJECTS THE BELIEF
THAT SUFFERING OF FLESH WILL SURELY SUCCEED
BEYOND THIS PHYSICAL FORM AND INTO THE UNKNOWN
BEYOND THE ANGUISH WE’VE KNOWN
HOW COULD A SOUL POSSESS EARTHLY FEELING
THE ESOTERIC THREAT DEFIANT OF REASON
SUBSERVIENCE WON ON THE MOST FEEBLE PREMISE
WE DEFINE REASON
MANIFEST THESE OBJECTIVES
RELIGIOUS FERVOR REVOKED
THIS IS THE FINAL SUPPER FOR FAITH
THIS REVELATION IS PURE
CLEANSE THE VIRUS OF BELIEF
INFECT THE PORTAL TO PROVIDENCE
CAN YOU FEEL THE FIRE THAT BURNS IN OUR HEARTS?
IT’S FORGED IN A BLAZE OF COMMITMENT
UNTANGLED WE ARE, SINGULAR IN PURPOSE
WE QUEST TO ENLIGHTEN ALL MEN
FROM OUR MANTLE WE’LL IMPOSE THESE WORDS UNTO YOU
A WEAPON THE LIGHTENED SHALL WIELD
A PLAGUE THAT DEVOURS THE CHOSEN SPIRITS
AND LIBERATES THOSE WITH THE WILL

MANIFEST THESE OBJECTIVES
RELIGIOUS FERVOR REVOKED
THIS IS THE FINAL SUPPER FOR FAITH
THIS REVELATION IS PURE
CLEANSE THE VIRUS OF BELIEF
INFECT THE PORTAL TO PROVIDENCE
CLANDESTINE IN OUR QUEST
WE LURK IN THE SHADOWS OF THE CROSS
TO SET A FIRE IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE ABLE TO HEAR
OBSOLETE (NOW) THE OLD LAWS
AND THEIR FAVORED REWARDS
WE ARE THEY WHO LEADS THE RATS INTO PARADISE
(TO SET) A SCOURGE UPON THE HEAVENS
GOD’S AN ILLUSION
A DELUSIONAL CRUTCH
THAT CAN NO LONGER TRUSS YOU UP

AKNOWLEDGE. ACCEPT. OBEY
