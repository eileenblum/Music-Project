CHOSEN I HAVE BEEN
TO CHANNEL THAT SPIRIT
VOYEURS THEY’LL COME AND IN NUMBERS
AUTHENTICITY THE SIREN, THE GRAIL THAT ALL MEN SEEK
IT’S WHAT I’M CAPABLE TO PROVIDE

I WILL CHANNEL MY WILL DIRECTLY THROUGH THEM
THEY WILL BE THE CONDUIT AND I THE HAND OF DEATH
I WILL BE THE FACILITATOR, THE CULT OF PANDEMONIUM
THE BLUEPRINT OF EVERY DEMISE

FOR I COMMAND ATTENTION
AND I’M AU FAIT WITH WHAT I AM SELLING
MY THROAT WILL BELLOW ODES OF PLAGUE AND PESTILENCE 
MY BREATH WILL BE PESTIFEROUS, CONSTRICTING EVERY LUNG
THE AURA OF DECAY WILL PERVADE EVERY NOSTRIL
ITS FILTH SCATTERED ACROSS THE SHOULDERS OF THE WORLD
I (WILL BE) THE ARBITER OF DEATH
I WILL USURP
I WILL PROVIDE
I WILL READY EACH AND EVERY MAN
FOR THE TRANSITION FROM LIFE INTO THE EYE OF ARMAGEDDON

WHEN THE SEED OF GOD IS BUT DUST
AND THE DREAMS OF SALVATION ARE CRUSHED UNDERFOOT

WHEN THE SMOKE AND FLAMES ARE ALL THAT REMAINS
WHEN EXQUISITE DREAMS OF HEAVEN ARE GROUND INTO DUST
AND EVEN THE MOST PROFOUND LONGINGS
ARE BUT RUST
COME DRINK FROM THE CHALICE OF CESSATION
SUCCUMB TO THE ENCHANTRESS’ LURE 
FORSAKE YOUR FLOCK, RELINQUISH THY FLESH
THE BLOOD IS NO LONGER THE LIFE

THE MOST LEGENDARY DEATH COULD BE YOURS
SUCH GRANDEUR IS MINE TO DISPENSE
COME BASK IN THE FIRES OF MY WILL
COME RELISH THE MAJESTY OF DESISTANCE

IT’S NOT INSANITY THAT I WEILD
BUT A PROMINENCE BEYOND ATTAINMENT
