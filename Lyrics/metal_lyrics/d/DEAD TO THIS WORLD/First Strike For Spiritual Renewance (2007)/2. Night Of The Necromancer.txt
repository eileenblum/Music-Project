TRANSCEND THE RELUCTANT FEELING
I RISE INTO THE SHADOWED LANDS
IN THE HOUR OF PERFECTION, HEALING
ITS ESSENCE PURE AND BLACK HEREIN
I BELONG HERE, MEANT TO BE
THEY SING FOR ME
IN DARKEST DREAMS I COULD FORESEE
AMONGST THE WEEPING
TERROR RISES, EVER WATCHING
BY BREAK OF DAWN WE STRIKE AS ONE
NEVER CLOSE YOUR EYES
NEVER LOOK AWAY 
RISING FROM GROUND BEHIND YOU
CAREFULLY, INSTINCTIVELY
NEVER STIR THE WATERS
NEVER MAKE A SOUND BECAUSE
THIS IS THE NIGHT OF THE NECROMANCER
THIS IS THE NIGHT OF THE DEAD
SPIRITLESS IN NOTHINGNESS
JAWS OF DEATH SET YOU FREE
CLAIMS YOUR LIFE
PIERCING PAIN, BURNING FLESH
PILING BONES INTO GRAVES
STRIP YOU DOWN
PROCREATE THE STORMING DEAD
INTO WAR, SPITTING FORTH
JOIN THE DEAD
WITH THE POWER FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE
WE SHALL AVENGE OURSELVES
NEVER CLOSE YOUR EYES
NEVER LOOK AWAY 
RISING FROM GROUND BEHIND YOU
CAREFULLY, INSTINCTIVELY
NEVER STIR THE WATERS
NEVER MAKE A SOUND BECAUSE
THIS IS THE NIGHT OF THE NECROMANCER
THIS IS THE NIGHT OF THE DEAD
