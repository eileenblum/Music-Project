[Music &amp; lyrics written by Dimmi Argus]

Will it happen or will it pass away,
will it disappear or will it remain.
Will it stay alive in me,
now and forever as itâs meant to be.

When it is over, when itâs begun
Staying awake or sleeping, difference is none.
I donât want to remember, I canât figure out
Why I was born, and why did I die?

[Chorus:]
You shouldnât stay in me, you shouldnât stay with me.
You just remain with me, but not the one who you are now
I will wait for you, I will long for you,
Iâm still in love with you, but not the one who you are now.

Years will pass by, people will pass by,
I know, so many things will cross our lifes.
Weâll get back as kids, and weâll grow up again,
And sometimes weâll cry, but who cares now.

I know weâll be happy, and also unhappy,
Weâll never be certain which one will prevail
Looking for comfort looking for passion
Dealing our hearts as a pair of dice.

[Chorus:]
Iâve been lost in you,Â  youâve been lost with me,
Iâve lost the whole of you,Â  but not this one who you are now.
Time is not around, death is still apart.
I wish I could create you back, but not the one who you are
