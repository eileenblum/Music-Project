So, welcome my friends â Iâm coming back
After all this long years.
Years of wasted dreams, Success and senceless immages.
I ware on my back The waight of the life,
Away from my motherland.
Iâve sung all my songs Before strangers and fools -
Iâve been so wasted and lonely...
Â 
[Chorus:]
Iâm riding my horse, Iâm riding alone,
On the road night and day, To find my way home.
Emptiness, cold and pain Iâve left behind.
In a life with no friends, Iâve been losing my mind...
Iâve been losing my mind...
Â 
So, keep up the faith â Youâve got it deep inside
Into the heart.
The life is too short and weâre living all
In a heaven and hell.
Thats why I will come Breaking the rules â
I will come with my music.
So, open your arms, Iâll give you my soul
Forever and ever....
Â 
[Chorus:]
Iâm riding my horse, Iâm riding alone,
On the road night and day, to find my way home.
Loneliness, fear and blaim Iâve left behind.
In a life with no friends, Iâve been losing my mind...
Â 
[Guitar Solo]
Â 
Iâm riding my horse, Iâm riding alone,
On the road night and day, To find my way home.
Emptiness, cold and pain Iâve left behind.
In a life with no friends, Iâve been losing my mind...
Iâve been losing my mind...
Â 
Iâm riding my horse, Iâm riding alone,
On the road night and day, to find my way home.
Loneliness, fear and blaim Iâve left behind.
In a life with no friends, Iâve been losing my mind...
