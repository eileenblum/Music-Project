My mind is black, my soul is white,
I have no fear, i see it clear
into the night.
My hair it black, my face is white,
I'm not affraid, without a shame
I live my life.
All my world is black and white...

My music makes me feel alright
unspoken words, into my head
into my heart.
I love you all, Oh god, bless my friends,
You are my future, you are my present,
You are my past.
All my world is black and white...

[Chorus:]
Black and white, is tearing my soul now
black and white, i'm giving you all now.
Alone and proud, i'm never to blame,
I'll be with you again and again.

My eyes are black, my hands are white
I'm all the same, i play my game
so, look at me now.
my clothes are black, my ass is white
don't be affraid, to be with me
I'm your best friend.

I wanna only rock'n Roll,
my favorite bands, my favorite place
to play my songs.
What you believe, i understand
What you wanna hear, what you wanna see
That's what i am.
All my world is black and white...

[Chorus:]
Black and white, is tearing my soul now
black and white, i'm giving you all now.
Alone and proud, i'm never to blame,
I'll be with you again and again.
All my world is black and white...
