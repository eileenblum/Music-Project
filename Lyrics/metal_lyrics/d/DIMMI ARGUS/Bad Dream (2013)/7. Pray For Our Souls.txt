[Music written by M.Galabov, D.Argirov, R.Doychinov, S.Petrov and S.Hristov. Lyrics written by R.Doychinov and D.Argirov ]

Oh, people from the coming generations,
please, donât reproach us with your evil words.
If you could treat us with some humble patience,
I know, youâll understand the truth for us ...

So we are dead now, hanged on the gallows.
It was so nice in our living flesh.
But now weâre nothihg else but stinking corpses,
and every bone is turning into ash...

[Chorus:]
To laugh at us is not a good reaction,
Just pray for us.
You better pray for our sinful souls,
Please pray for us.
To laugh at us is not a good reaction,
You better pray for our sinful souls...

So listen now you all my dear brothers.
Do not despise us âcause we are condemned
for when you take your own way to the gallows -
not every one is born with equal strength.

Oh, keep us Satan with your evil power,
because the sin is very much enticing.
And everyone will share our way to hell,
if you repeat the fault that we have done.

[Chorus:]
To be a saint donât spit on our faces.
Just pray for us.
You better pray for our sinful souls,
Please pray for us.
To be a saint donât spit on our faces.
You better pray for our sinful souls...

Long time ago the rains washed us away
The burning sun seared our skin and hair.
And flock of crows with pointed beaks like arrows
With malice spiked deeply ih the eyes.

There is no way to sit and cry.
The storm is rocking us in mortal dance.
We have no ears, no cheeks, we have no eyes,
But laughterâs still distorting our face.

[Chorus:]
To laugh at us is not a good reaction,
Just pray for us.
You better pray for our sinful souls,
Please pray for us.
To laugh at us is not a good reaction,
You better pray for our sinful souls...

Please, pray for us! You pray for us! Just pray for us!
You better pray for our sinful souls!
