[Music &amp; lyrics written by Dimitar Argirov]

My mind is black, my soul is white,
I have no fear, i see it clear into the night.
My hair it black, my face is white,
I'm not affraid, without a shame I live my life.

My music makes me feel alright,
unspoken words - into my head, into my heart.
I love you all, oh God, bless my friends!
You are my future, you are my present, you are my past.

All my world is black and white.

My eyes are black, my hands are white,
I'm all the same, i play my game, so look at me now.
My clothes are black, my ass is white,
don't be affraid of me, Iâm your best friend.

I only wanna rock'n Roll!
To play my songs only for you, with my metal band.
What you believe, i understand,
all you wanna hear, all you wanna see - that's what i am.

All my world is black and white.

[Chorus:]
Black and white is tearing my soul now.
Black and white, iâm giving you all.
Alone and proud, iâll never blame anyone.
Iâll be with you, when I come undone.

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus:]
Black and white is tearing my soul now.
Black and white, iâm giving you all.
Alone and proud, iâll never blame anyone.
Iâll be with you, when you come undone.

[Chorus:]
Black and white is tearing my soul now.
Black and white, iâm giving you all.
Alone and proud, iâll never blame.
Iâll be with you, again and again.

Black and white, all my world is black and white.
Black and white, all my world is black and white.

All my world is black and white.
