[Music written by M.Galabov, D.Argirov, R.Doychinov, S.Petrov and S.Hristov. Lyrics written by R.Doychinov and D.Argirov ]

Here lies my body of a martyr
Struck down by the god of love.
Iâve been a wrathchild, a poor(unhappy) stranger.
My name was Dimmi Fuckinâ Argus.

Iâve never had a shelter, on this world,
Iâve drunk and drunk day after day.
I shared with you my only bread and sky,
so go down on your knees and pray:

[Chorus: ]
âGod bless you, have a rest in peace,
be happy in your grave forever!â
In all my days, before i died,
My deeds were not always clever.
I was a victim of the need.
The vicious women and the wine.
So, âGod bless you, have a rest in peace,
be happy in your grave forever!â....

[Guitar solo]

They meanly forced me to drag my chains,
But they didnât manage to disgrace me.
Iâve tried to live some more, but in vane...
And I still never begged for mercy.

[Chorus:]
âGod bless you, have a rest in peace,
be happy in your grave forever!â
In all my days, before i died,
My matters were not always clever.
I was a victim of the need.
The vicious women and the wine.
So, âGod bless you, have a rest in peace,
be happy in your grave forever!â...

[Chorus:]
âGod bless you, have a rest in peace,
be happy in your grave forever!â
In all my days, before i died,
My deeds were not always clever.
I was a victim of the need.
The vicious women and the wine.
So, âGod bless you, have a rest in peace,
be happy in your grave forever!â...
