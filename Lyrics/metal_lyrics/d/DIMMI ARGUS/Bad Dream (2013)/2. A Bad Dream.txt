[Music and lyrics written by Dimitar Argirov]

My friends are talking about a bad dream.
My girl is so afraid, sheâs asking for answers.
Of what happens in my house every night.

Behind the locked doors nobody is entering.
The air is full of steam and stinks of hellish smoke.
Oh, what you see, you would never believe.

[Chorus:]
Moving shadows, come again.
Darkness falls down and eats the day.
Creeping spiders fill my bed.
Flying skull bones keep rockinâ and rollinâ
With me again.

Youâve gotta see me in the morning when Iâm awake,
Looking at me in the fuckinâ mirror.
It isnât me but just another normal man

The day at work among the every day people,
the busy streets â theyâre driving me crazy.
I canât resist until the next bloody ball.

[Chorus:]
Moving shadows, come again.
Darkness falls down and eats the day.
Creeping spiders fill my bed.
Rockinâ monsters from the hell.

[Guitar solo]

The storyâs goinâ on again and again
I canât talk anymore with my friends
(I donât care anymore about my friends)
And everybody tells me â you are a zombie man.

So, please wake me up, iâm gettinâ so crazy.
Itâs all a joke, my friends, you donât be afraid.
So, come on! Itâs party time again!...

Moving shadows, come again.
Darkness falls down and eats the day.
Creeping spiders fill my bed.
Rockinâ monsters from the hell,
from the hell, from the hell, from the hell...
