[Music written by D.Argirov and Dragomir Draganov. Lyrics written by D.Argirov]

So, welcome my friends â Iâm coming back
After all this long years.
Years of wasted dreams, Success and senseless immages.
I ware on my back the burden of life,
Away from my motherland.
Iâve sung all my songs in front of strangers and fools -
Iâve been so wasted and lonely...

[Chorus:]
Iâm riding my horse, Iâm riding alone,
On the road night and day, to find my way home.
Emptiness, cold and pain Iâve left behind.
In a life with no friends, Iâve been losing my mind...
Iâve been losing my mind...

So, keep up the faith â Youâve got it deep inside
Into your hearts.
The life is too short and weâre living all
In a heaven and hell.
So, Iâm coming back, breaking the rules â
Iâm coming with my music.
So, open your arms, Iâll give you my soul
Forever and ever....

[Chorus:]
Iâm riding my horse, Iâm riding alone,
On the road night and day, to find my way home.
Loneliness, fear and blame Iâve left behind.
In a life with no friends, Iâve been losing my mind...

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus:]
Iâm riding my horse, Iâm riding alone,
On the road night and day, to find my way home.
Emptiness, cold and pain Iâve left behind.
In a life with no friends, Iâve been losing my mind...
Iâve been losing my mind...

[Chorus:]
Iâm riding my horse, Iâm riding alone,
On the road night and day, to find my way home.
Loneliness, fear and blame Iâve left behind.
In a life with no friends, Iâve been losing my mind...
