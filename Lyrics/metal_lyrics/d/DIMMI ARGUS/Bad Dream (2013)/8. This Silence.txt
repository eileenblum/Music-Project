[Music and lyrics written by Dimitar Argirov]

Without saying a word, Iâll slowly step into your dream.
This darkness is calling my name.
The soft fingers of the dusk, caress my hand laying
on your eyelids, heavy with sleep...

So please, come into my world, Iâll take you out of this silence
From the depths of my mind, From the depths of my mind.

So speak in a low voice, seems like out of conscious.
A scarcely perceptible speech.
So please, tell me one word before you sail away â
The night is not ready for you...

Iâm the only one in this world, Whoâd take out of this silence,
out of this silence.... Youâll see it one day, youâll see it one day ...

Call me, remember, tell me how you were before.
Let me describe you how it looks like the promised land.
Youâll see it one day, youâll see it one day.
With a ghost of a smile, with a ghost of a smile.

[Solo]

Call me, remember, tell me how you were before.
Let me describe you how it looks like the promised land.
I wish you love, i hope youâll live, yeah...

Calling the memories, you believe in what youâve found.
Your time is here now, we are closer to the dawn.
Youâre dreaming now, Youâre dreaming now ...
Till the end of the night, till the end of the time,
With a ghost of a smile, with a ghost of a smile...
