[Music and lyrics written by Dimitar Argirov]

Will it stay or will it pass away,
will it disappear or will it remain?
Will it stay alive in me,
now and forever as itâs meant to be.

When it is over, when itâs begun?
Staying awake or sleeping, difference is none.
I donât want to remember, I canât figure out
Why I was born, and why did I die?
Â 
You shouldnât stay in me,
you shouldnât stay with me.
You just remain with me,
but not the one who you are now
I will wait for you, I will long for you,
Iâm still in love with you,
but not the one who you are now...

Years will pass by, people will pass by,
I know, so many things will cross our lifes.
Weâll get back as kids, and weâll grow up again.
And sometimes weâll cry, but who cares now.

I know weâll be happy, and also unhappy,
weâll never be certain which one will prevail
Looking for comfort looking for passion,
dealing our hearts as a pair of dice.

Iâve been lost in you,
youâve been lost with me.
Iâve lost the whole of you,
but not this one who you are now.
Time is not around, death is still apart.
I wish I could create you back,
but not the one who you are now.
Who are you now?......

[Guitar solo]

R1. You shouldnât stay in me,
you shouldnât stay with me.
You just remain with me,
but not the one who you are now
I will wait for you, I will long for you,
Iâm still in love with you,
but not the one who you are now...

Iâve been lost in you,
youâve been lost with me.
Iâve lost the whole of you,
but not this one who you are now.
Time is not around, death is still apart.
I wish I could create you back,
but not the one who you are now.

Who are you now .... Who are you now ....
