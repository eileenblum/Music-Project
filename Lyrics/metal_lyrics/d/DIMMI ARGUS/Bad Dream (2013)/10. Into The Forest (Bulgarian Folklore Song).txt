[Lyrics written by Dimitar Argirov]

Eeeeh, Goro Zelena, Goro, Goro ...
Itâs time for Sacrifice...

Come to the forest, come to me slowly,
I will be waiting, you and me only.
Donât be afraid to meet my sliding shadow,
Just follow me to the sacrificial cavern.
Beautiful Maiden, you are the saviour,
of your dying tribe, you are the defender.
Your death and blood are all I need for donation.
Come closer, don't make me losing my patience.

Your beauty and courage are bigger then ever.
This sacrifice will be remebered forever
The people will create songs and fairytales.
Theyâll raise a monument and you will become a saint.
Be ready to meet your cold, eternal night
I want you now under my sacrifical scythe.

Eeeeh, Come to the forest,
Forest, forest, Itâs time for Sacrifice...

Princess of suffering, you brought the salvation.
Your death is enough for me to set free your nation.
I here your last breath, I see your eyes wide open.
You are still alive just for a very few moments.
I have your blood now, thanks for your oblation -
The cruel wizard will stop this damnation.

Eeeeh, Goro Zelena, Goro, Goro, ...
Is time for Sacrifice
