Hellish deathstrike, flash of blinding light, destroyed all in sight
No time for fear, death becomes clear, destroying the sphere
Cities vaporized, life neutralized, apocalypse realized
The future died that day, nothing more to say, humanity fades away

Screams from the holocaust - still ringing in your mind
Nightmares relive the terror that you cannot leave behind
Screams from the holocaust - still echoing inside
Live forever with the horror that will haunt you 'til you die

Somehow you survived, to watch the world as it died, no reason to be alive
Everything crushed, skies of radioactive dust, watch the world rust
Walk the land alone, ruins of your home, pick through the bones
None left to blame, this nuclear game, proved utterly insane

Screams from the holocaust - still ringing in your mind
Nightmares relive the terror that you cannot leave behind
Screams from the holocaust - still echoing inside
Live forever with the horror that will haunt you 'til you die
