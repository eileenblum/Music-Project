Artillery pounding, thunderous death knell
Casualties mounting, earth turned to hell
Blazing inferno, munitions explode
Utter destruction, massive payload

The blasts from the bombing, the bodies in piles
Massive devastation, in all directions for miles

Earthscorcher
Burning down the land
Earthscorcher
Soil turns into sand
Earthscorcher
No escape, it's time to die
Earthscorcher
Kiss your ass goodbye

Stench of napalm, burning through skin
Corpses aflame, the wages of sin
Toxic warfare, killer instinct consumes
Barren landscape, homes turned to tombs

The blasts from the bombing, the bodies in piles
Massive devastation, in all directions for miles

Enemies dead now, and so is everything else
Death without sense, a man made kind of hell
The battle is over, but the war will never end
The missiles keep launching, no one left to attack or defend

The blasts from the bombing, the bodies in piles
Massive devastation, in all directions for miles

Earthscorcher
Burning down the land
Earthscorcher
Soil turns into sand
Earthscorcher
No escape, it's time to die
Earthscorcher
Kiss your ass goodbye
