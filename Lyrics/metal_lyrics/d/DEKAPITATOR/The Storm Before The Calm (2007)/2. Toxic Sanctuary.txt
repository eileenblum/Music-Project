Children of the atom, mutant strain
Barren wasteland, dead soil pitted by acid rain
Xenophobic, they allow no one within
All humans to them are guilty of deadly sins

Their word is law, their law is death
Their word is law, their law is death
Their word is law, their law is death
Their word is law, their law is death

Mutated aggressor now commands
Post-nuclear landscape ruled with iron hand
Deformed tomorrows, nightmares all come true
Stay out of sight or their next victims will be you

Their word is law, their law is death
Their word is law, their law is death
Their word is law, their law is death
Their word is law, their law is death

Their word is law, their law is death
Their word is law, their law is death
Their word is law, their law is death
Their word is law, their law is death
