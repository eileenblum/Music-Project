Run with wolves to keep one step ahead
If you run with us beware of where you tread
Ripping through the weak and faint of heart
For us the kill is only just the start
Apologies not given, so don't ask
Nothing to hide, don't need your mask
Energy exchanged with savage grace
Aggression, spewing venom in your face

Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack

Alive under the moon, we walk alone
Cold night air to chill your blood and bones
Nocturnal hunger stalking evermore
We live in shadows darkening your door
Hair on end, catching fearful scent
Under cover of dark we run hell-bent
Prey and predator, closest kith and kin
Teeth gleaming in the night betray a grin

Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack

Jumping at shadows that we cast
A kill, a fuck, a piss, a drink, a laugh
The hunt for us is all in a night's work
So come into the shadows, where we lurk
To walk the night our calling by birthright
So take it as you will, the bark with the bite
Nothing left to do but try your luck
Because you know that we don't really give a fuck

Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack
