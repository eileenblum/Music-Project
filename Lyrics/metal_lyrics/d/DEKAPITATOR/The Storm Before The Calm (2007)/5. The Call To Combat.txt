Beachhead reached in broken silence
Do or die is here
Rifle clutched in white knuckle grip
Choking back the fear
Bodies falling one by one
Upon the deadly march
Sky lit up with mortar fire
To death our only course

The call to combat - plunged into a firestorm
A tempest with no eye
The call to combat - knee deep in bodies
Baptized by cannon fire
The call to combat - the will to fight is shattered
No choice but to march on
The call to combat - a deadly game of life and death
Where meet our fate as pawns

Casings fall amongst the dead
Marking killing trail
We meet our fates on roads well tread
Slaughtered to what avail?
Soldiers calling two by two
Voices lost in battle's din
The earth split open, stained with blood
A coffin to crawl within

The call to combat - plunged into a firestorm
A tempest with no eye
The call to combat - knee deep in bodies
Baptized by cannon fire
The call to combat - the will to fight is shattered
No choice but to march on
The call to combat - a deadly game of life and death
Where meet our fate as pawns
