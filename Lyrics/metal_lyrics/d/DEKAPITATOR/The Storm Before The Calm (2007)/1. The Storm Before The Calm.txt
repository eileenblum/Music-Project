Storm - descends in hellish reign, a blight upon the skies
Run - all hope is now in vain, there is only time left to die
Fire - unfolds its choking grasp, a nuclear pyre upon which to burn
Scream - a nation breathes it's last, man is now ashes and the world is his urn

The storm before the calm
A darkness without dawn
All hope and life is gone
With the storm before the calm

Burn - in throes of genocide, breath comes in fatal fumes
Choke - on toxic winds death rides, decrying all our dooms
Lost - the game ends in checkmate, and this time no one wins
Dead - we'll see the truth too late, everyone dies for one man's sins

The storm before the calm
A darkness without dawn
All hope and life is gone
With the storm before the calm

We can no longer pretend
That there is beginning, without end
And now, we must come to the end

Skies - stretch blackened overhead, an endless ebony tomb
Earth - crumbles beneath the dead, despoiled and consumed
Dead - ashes shroud to the land, to bury all our bones
Calm - a somber day at hand, a funeral with none left to mourn

The storm before the calm
A darkness without dawn
All hope and life is gone
With the storm before the calm
