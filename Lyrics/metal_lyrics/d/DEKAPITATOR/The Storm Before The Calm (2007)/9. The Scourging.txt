Sifting through the wreckage - the empire of those killed
Sword of Damocles now fallen - brought down by totalitarian wills
Nuclear strike
Atomic might
Came crushing down
To split the ground

Crawling from the carnage - twisted, chaos breed
As it once was it shall be again - arise, archaic creed
Mankind has fell
Earth now a hell
Unspeakable things
Forgotten grotesque beings

The scourging
What for aeons slumbered is now awake
The scourging
A world that will nevermore be sane
The scourging
What for aeons slumbered is now awake
The scourging
A world that will nevermore be sane

From places deep within the earth - the elder ones emerge
A shattered world their new dominion - abhorrent demiurge
Tendrils unwind
Within human minds
Scions of decay
Become their slaves

The scourging
What for aeons slumbered is now awake
The scourging
A world that will nevermore be sane
The scourging
What for aeons slumbered is now awake
The scourging
A world that will nevermore be sane

Enclave of the repugnant - the reign of shadowy nightmares
Crawling up to rule once more - now all the earth is theirs
Sanity is lost
A new holocaust
This world descends
Into darkness without end

The scourging
What for aeons slumbered is now awake
The scourging
A world that will nevermore be sane
The scourging
What for aeons slumbered is now awake
The scourging
A world that will nevermore be sane
