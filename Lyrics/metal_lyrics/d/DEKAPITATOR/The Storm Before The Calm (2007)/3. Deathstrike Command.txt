The spark ignites the powderkeg, the deadly die is cast
Plunged headlong into a war, a war that will surely be the last
Command to bring the hammer down, a fatal blow to fall
Warheads aimed and now deployed, spelling death to us all

Deathstrike command
Deathstrike command
Deathstrike command
Deathstrike command

Explosive force, atomic might, careening toward the end
Riots break out and panic strikes, as the missiles begin to descend
Nowhere to flee, no way to run, nothing can stop your death
Survival is a fleeting dream, extinction - the only path that's left

Deathstrike command

Deathstrike command

War - the final war has come
Today - will be the last day of
Mankind - fulfilled it's destiny of death
Death - the only way this day will end
