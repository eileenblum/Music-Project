Nuclear holocaust is
All that awaits
Condemn the masses
To their morbid fate
Crushing death from
Burning skies
See the terror in
Their eyes

[Chorus:]
Make them die
Hear them cry
Watch them fry

This is the last day
Of your life
Nothing stands
Will survive
Burning and screaming
Till your end
Atomic flames consume
Until descend

[Chorus:]
Make them die
Hear them cry
Watch them fry
Make Them Die!!

Die [8x]

[Chorus:]
Make them die
Hear them cry
Watch them fry
Make Them Die!!
