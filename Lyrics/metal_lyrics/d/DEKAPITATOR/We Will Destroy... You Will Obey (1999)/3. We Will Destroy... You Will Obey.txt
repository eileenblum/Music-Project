First comes the fear that spreads 'cross the land
Awaiting the destruction that's so close at hand
Then comes the pounding of nuclear war
Now death is the only thing to live for...

[Chorus:]
We will destroy...you will obey
Crush all the false ones that stand in our way
Run for your lives 'cause in darkness we slay
We will destroy...you will obey!!

Under the shadows you hide from your fate
But for this whole dying world it's just too fucking late
Crushing like thunders the street takes it's toll
Thermonuclear inferno now warheads control...

[Chorus:]
We will destroy...you will obey
An era of darkness begins on this day
The sluts are all chained and then taken away
We will destroy...you will obey!!

Jesus has fallen along with mankind
In this nuclear winter you're forever blind
There is no judgement, no god heard your cries
So do as thou wilt or fuck off and die!

[Chorus:]
We will destroy... you will obey
Total devastation is the only way
Man's civilization has faded away
We will destroy...you... will... obey!!!
