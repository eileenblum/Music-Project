The thunder of the panzers ready to strike
Echoes of warfare haunting the night
Fire and bullets rain death from the skies
Living to fight, fighting to die...

[Chorus:]
Thundering legions - signals your doom
Turning this world into a tomb
Thundering legions - extinguish the light
Thundering legions - it's time to fight - tonight!

The crush of death metal drives you insane
The deafening roar that you'll hear as you're slain
Hell's thunderous steel crushes the ground where
You stood ironclad warfiend hungry for blood...

[Chorus:]
Thundering legions - heard 'cross the land
Through infernal crossfire hear death's command
Thundering legions - it's here - it's all that is left
When metal comes pounding, you'll fight 'til the death! Fight 'til the death

The heavens now fall, dying in flames
Shudder in fear when we call out your name
The unholy power that sets fire to the sky
And the last thing you'll hear before you die is...

[Chorus:]
Thundering legions - signals your doom
Turning this world into a tomb
Thundering legions - extinguish the light
Thundering legions - it's time to fight for...
Thundering legions - heard 'cross the land
Through infernal crossfire hear death's command
Thundering legions - it's here - it's all that is left
When metal comes pounding, you'll fight 'til the death! Fight 'til the death
