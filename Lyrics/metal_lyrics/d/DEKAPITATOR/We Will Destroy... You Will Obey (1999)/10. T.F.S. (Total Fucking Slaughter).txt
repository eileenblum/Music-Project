Storm gathers on the horizon
A never ending attack
A thousand blades and arrows
Bearing down on your back
Awaiting to begin the massacre
Axe blade raised at command
Killing without end unleashed
Down falls the iron hand

[Chorus:]
SLAUGHTER SLAUGHTER
It's all we do
TOTAL SLAUGHTER
We'll slaughter you
SLAUGHTER SLAUGHTER
Blood runs red
FUCKING SLAUGHTER
'Til you're dead [4x]

In the deluge of blood
We fight on in the name of death
Bloody flag impaled in your head
Mark the spot where we took your last breath
Cities laid to waste
The countryside's in flames
Burning bodies piled hundreds high
Mark the way by which we came..

[Chorus:]
SLAUGHTER SLAUGHTER
It's all we do
TOTAL SLAUGHTER
We'll slaughter you
SLAUGHTER SLAUGHTER
Blood runs red
FUCKING SLAUGHTER
'Til you're dead [2x]
