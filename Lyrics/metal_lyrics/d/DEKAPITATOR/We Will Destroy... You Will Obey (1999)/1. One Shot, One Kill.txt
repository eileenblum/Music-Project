Surviving on adrenaline
Lost hope and courage long ago
Ammunition is my only friend
Living for the kill is all i know

[Chorus:]
One shot, one kill
One shot, one kill

Friend or foe, no one knows
There's no more wrong or right
In the depths of the jungle's darkness
Burning napalm is the only light

[Chorus:]
One shot, one kill
One shot, one kill

One shot, one kill
One shot, one kill

I've forgotten what we're fighting for
It doesn't matter anyway
Just keep your finger on the trigger
If you want to live another day

[Chorus:]
One shot, one kill
One shot, one fuckin' kill
