Evil is a strength for each one can feel it
It's the image of what's choking and killing
But in fact I believe that's not such a wicked concept
Not like a simple effect making the corpses rotting or bursting our very eyes
Things are much more complicated to me

I don't want to suffer anymore as I have to drag an witchering body
Bruised inside as well as outside
I am learning to abandon myself to my fate in a languorous Lassa fever

We are just our own toys and I really like being conscious that we can be other's if we consent
I can be the black light that never shines, I can be the breeze that never blows

I'm living in the shadowy undergrowth far away from all conventions
I am the colour you can not see, the shade in the sky that can not disturb particles
I am the servant controlled by my own body's limits
People just see the face spitting death and feeding cerebral palsy over ten generations is me

No one can understand that I had to loose everything to make something better of myself
I don't know if anyone could understand me and my need to test myself everyday
To know if I still live

Each day I can contemplate the worm continuing his tiring work
Each day I can feel the icy presence of those thousand scars on me
Scars are victories, pleasure is a failure when it comes without violence
