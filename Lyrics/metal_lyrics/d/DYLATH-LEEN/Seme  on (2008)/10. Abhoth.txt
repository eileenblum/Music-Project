Limbs and gaping mouths are taking shape from the swamp
Pseudopods are drawing in this slimy liquid

My eyes can't free themselves from this greyish and syrupy substance
My eyes seem unavoidably filled with these images

I can feel the holling heat on my face, Is it for real ?

Obscene monstrosities continuously haunt my dreams
And try to drag me towards their last breath
You source of impurity that blemishes my sight and my reality
Stop crawling lasciviously inside me and suck my healthiness of mind
I'm no longer the master of my own dreams I'm dislocated and jaded
My heart's beating spread in a crystal clear and dull noise of which discordance upsets my stomach

Maybe the source of impuriry is only me ?

You infamous and appaling creature, get out of my pallid and confuse vision
Before I renounce forever to this quixotic life
To this eternal flaw that destroys the frontiers of my perception
