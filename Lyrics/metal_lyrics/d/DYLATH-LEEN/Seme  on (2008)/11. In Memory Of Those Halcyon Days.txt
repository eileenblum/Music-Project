Each sunlight is subverting our thoughts more than we could trust
Growing means learning to see the golden drawing made by embers on our skin

I feel so lonely everyday in the heart of this ivory atrium
Here I have to contemplate the silliness of smiles on totemic faces

I'm getting a than under the fire of dull disasters

What difference can I make between the one or the other ?
Wich bottomless horror would manage to wake my sleepy senses up ?

Each sunlight is subverting our thoughts more than we could trust
Growing means learning to see the golden damascening
Represented on the knife edge tearing our flesh
Blinding dampness drips on our rites

No strength can be tangible in those gardens of screes
Nothing can shock me anymore

This is why we're able to feel the real plenitude
We are the teratogenetic substance of this world

I have found my freedom in the ignorance of thing's worth
And particularly in human thing's
