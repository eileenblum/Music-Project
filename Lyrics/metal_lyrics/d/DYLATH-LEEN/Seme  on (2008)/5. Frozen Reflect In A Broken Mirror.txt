My mortal frame doesn't let me be what I want to be
Consuming my brain, my wishes dictate my acts like a machanical cog

Who am I ? Tell me !
What am I ? Please tell me !!

Now it's time for you to know you are arrayed in a coat
Made of ignorance and narrow pipe dreams
All your being is locked in a crack depending of my wakening
You are just a friend working for me
A petrified slave, the prophet's shade
I am your unificent shroud what anyone sees when you're asleep
What do you think about it ?

I've got to forget the other to better keep myself in mind
I've got to forget this " you "
Who drains me to be nothing at all
Ear me damned friend before devouring my soul

I need consolation but you never give hope
I need to know and to see the sooth but you are such a liar
I need to be loved but all you can give is hate
