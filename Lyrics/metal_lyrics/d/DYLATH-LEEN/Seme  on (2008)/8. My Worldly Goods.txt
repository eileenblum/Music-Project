I'm quite aware of what they say behind my back
I have to see beneath their apparent indifference

Why are you interested by me ? What do you really want ?
You can try to fool me but you'll never get anything cause I know

I feel their scratching claws upon my flesh
I attract them as I was made of solid gold but it's my own gold which is shining
They will never succeed in taking my goods

You can say you love me, I know you only want my empire
I'm delightfully alone and higher than those unclean insects drooling around me

I'm not so easy to convince, I know that everybody wants my worldly goods
My friendship is not for sale
Don't believe you can incite me to write your name on my testimony

I can feel their scratching claws upon my flesh
But they will never succeed in taking my goods
