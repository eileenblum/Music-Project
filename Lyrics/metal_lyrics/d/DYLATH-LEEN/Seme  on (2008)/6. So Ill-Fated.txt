Wretched one, I don't want to be your pawn
You wriggle like a worm
I'm feeling like your wreck
I cannot speak, I cannot breathe, as you try to wrest my tongue

You need to kiss my stinging lips
You need to spread your hatred in my dirty body
I need to kill the larva wich sullies my bluish skin

I'm climbing inside you to soak you up better
Like an animal tasting its prey
I laugh in your face
Before spitting your mephitic fluid

I'm on edge and it's writhing me with agony

Wretched one, fool of rage
You are so ill-fated
You wriggle like a worm
I cannot speak, I cannot breathe, as you try to wrest my tongue

My tight nerves can't hold you any longer
You twist like a worm

I look at myself with a chilling smile, my mouth is full of foam

My frenetic nerves are broken now
Result of my raving lunacy which will take your head, as it took mine
