Those thousand shadows are coming to feed the mill of my torments
Each one is a painful remembrace, a drop of icy light
A blinding flavour, a flagrance of blood

Is this fucking real or an I dreaming again ?

As stars are weakening and are becoming cold
As suns are dying and the space between stars is becoming wider
So the resistance I oppose is running low as my contact with the world

There are moments in wich I can not recognize myself
Sometimes, I remember all and sometimes, my jaws clenched by the horror
I discover the extent of damages I have caused, regaining reality

Everything has been written for me
And I can't do anything to turn the order of things upside down
Who's my master ?
I can't control my thoughts, my acts, myself
I don't wanna stay a witnes of my own life

By the emission of disparate frequencies I'm arbitrating lucidity and confusion
I'm lost in a lack of conscience, incapable of understanding what's happening

From the dephts of an undreamt abyss, advice are held
Each one is a voice coming with a purple reflect
Come to me scarlet lights, I can drink your putrid ray
