All my flesh is disappearing
All my bones stick to my skin
My veine are an infinite flow of pain and suffering
Like a puppet, I'm dead inside

Sometimes, I buy a smile
To forget I'll soon be dead.
To hold my own head on my thin neck make me bleed

What are you saying ?
I'm not mad !
What do you mean ?
Yes I'm fine !

Do you love me ?
Oh, I loathe myself !
And no one else can feel my distress

That's all, my movements are becoming a macabre dance
And my heart a dry rock
