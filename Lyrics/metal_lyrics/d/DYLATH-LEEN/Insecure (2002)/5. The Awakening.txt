While I was quietly sleeping, I still felt hungry.
The thunder broke the infinite skies
of my unsightly kingdom.
The infernal noise woke me-up,
I felt the impact and the vibrations it was creating.

Time means nothing to me,
As I got to endure all eternities.
Time means nothing to me,
My life is a waiting.
I will never grow, never shorten.
Nothing is gonna grow if not my hunger
And hunger is coming over me.
