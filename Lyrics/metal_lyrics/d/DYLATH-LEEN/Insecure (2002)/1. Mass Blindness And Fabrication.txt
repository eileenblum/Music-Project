Feeling complacently a deep enjoyment
as I am draining out my knowledge from the inside.
I just remember the channel,
losing my capabilities of abstract though.

My lifeâs a succession of screens
My brain is made of one million pixels,
blinded by my fabrication.

Becoming a reflect of reality,
losing my imagination.
Becoming a reflect of reality,
a reflect of my reality.

Drown under the fireworks display of negatron,
Drown in my electro-paranoia
Drug-addicted to information about my virtual world,
The only one I live in.
