Soon, Iâll be able to eat my fill.
Yeah, I will make them all lie down.

To feast is the most beautiful pleasure of my life :
To taste the remembrances,
To savour all the emotions which are growing inside of me.
To learn all the finest aspects of my desires.
There are the wealthies of rage,
The juicy taste of passion,
The exquisite flavour of fear and panic.

I eat all that, I digest all that, i absorb all that.
âCause that is what is feeding my soul, my essential need.
Now, I want her with her golden hair.
I will swallow her up by my eyes.
I will absorb her whiteness into my darkness,
And I will finally drink her mercy.
