One hand, the other one, nailed down, on the cross

Denied, three times, as knifed, one hundred times
Listen to the seraphs, who were in the skies,
laughing at the noise of nails

A doubt still remains in me
Whatâs the use of the love you have given
Now your dreams of confidence are trickling down your cheeks

One foot, the other one, nailed down, on the cross.

Life is like the way of the cross.
