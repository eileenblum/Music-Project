Feeling running down a flood of blood
In the hollow of my temples.
Feeling all the suffering of my kind
Entering into my veins like a shifty poison.

Nevertheless nothing stops the fervour of this world
Moving apart the joint of my bones.

Toughen!
This pain will feed your rage
And bloodlust will vanished.
