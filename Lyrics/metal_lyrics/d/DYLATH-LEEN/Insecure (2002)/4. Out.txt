I canât take anymore
The bitterness which is burning my soul.
I need an escape
Far away from my own demons.

Afraid by lifeâs beauty,
Frustrated in sorrow,
Lost in doubt,
Dismal in love.

Embalm me, my forever shade.
Achieve me, my shield is lowed.

Falling into the use of spirit,
To forget the past and leave the time.
Falling into the use of white fairy,
To forget the sadness and leave this earth.

Falling in love, that needleâs mattress,
Shapeless beauty poisoning the blinds.
