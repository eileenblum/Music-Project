The bloodâs running down slowly
On my pale skin
I am out of pain now
The blade shines in the sun.

Far away from my full of hatred sight
I wish you as much harm as possible.
Farewell murky jail Iâm leaving you,
The knife is my final friend.

A fine blade is laying on the blue line,
A crack hurts me and takes me away.

The knifeâs cold caress
Made my jailers run away
And delivery is born by my blood
To bruise and jeer at you.

Close your eyes, I donât want your pretty sullen
And I spit on your regrets.
Iâm naked smiling to death
Voluptuousness holding out her hands.
