[Music: Durkin]
[Lyrics: Durkin/Doty]

You fall before us, shattered in vain
You thrash about us, screaming in pain
Tortured and flaming, you're on your knees
You fucking whores, it's us you must please

[Chorus]
We'll give you merciless...
We'll give you merciless...
We'll give you merciless...
We'll give you merciless... DEATH!!!

Stand up and bang, till you fall to the floor
The sound is so deafening, it can't be ignored
The place is burning, your minds are destroyed
Devastated and helpless, you're left here to die

[Chorus]
[Guitar Solo: E. Meyer]

The angel has landed - judgement has come
Your death has arrived, faster than some
The darkness descending upon heaven's gates
Your soul is now promised and you know that
We'll wait!!!...

[Chorus]
