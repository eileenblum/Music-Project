You're pushed through the door single file
The smell of death is in the air
The pleas you scream are all denied
They have no love they don't care
You're strapped to the table
Your dark dreams come true
The sound of the saw blade draws near
It's finally happened the nightmares come true
Time has shown man's darkest fear

Welcome to the slaughter house
The teeth of the blades eat your flesh
Welcome to the slaughter house
Your darkest dreams become death

With silence and hatred they kill us by blade
These methods consuming yet fast
The legions of Hitler were never this cruel
This won't compare to man's past
These beings they kill us we fall to the rule
We're tortured and slaughter as last
It's finally happened the nightmares come true
Time has shown man's darkest fear

Welcome to the slaughter house
The teeth of the blades eat your flesh
Welcome to the slaughter house
Your darkest dreams become death

The butchering meat freezer is the final doom
No one survives tonight
They take you and hang you
Your fresh meat on a hook
Someones feeds well tonight
You're put on these meat racks
And hang up to dry
They butcher and slaughter death's near
It's finally happened the nightmares come true
Time has shown man's darkest fear

Welcome to the slaughter house
The teeth of the blades eat your flesh
Welcome to the slaughter house
Your darkest dreams become death
Welcome, welcome
