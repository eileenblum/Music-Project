You spilled the first blood
Now you must pay with your life
The death of my loved one
Which preys on your
Conscience brings strife
The night winds of vengeance
Whisper my hatred of thee
The bloodroom arising
Foretells the omen decreed

The thought of my anguish
Fills you with dread
My soul can not rest
Until I know that you're dead
[repeat]

I stalk you at night fall
Condemn you in anger by day
Fueled by my hatred
I'll not stop to rest, till you pay
You know that I'm out here
This fueling it tears you apart
But you'll not deceive me
Till I've ripped the life from your heart

The thought of my anguish
Fills you with dread
My soul can not rest
Until I know that you're dead
[repeat]

Vendetta, vendetta, vendetta
