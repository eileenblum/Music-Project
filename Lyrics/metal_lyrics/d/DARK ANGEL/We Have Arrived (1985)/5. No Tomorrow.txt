The soldiers, stand waiting
To vindicate this war torn land
The charge sounds, they march in
They're wondering, will they survive
The dawn comes, and then the light
We take lives, we hear the screams

No tomorrow, evil has it's way
No tomorrow, will I live through this day?
No tomorrow, my life's on the line
No tomorrow, there is still time

The valley, lays waiting
The enemy, is stocking
When night falls, we press out
Advancing, till early dawn

No tomorrow, evil has it's way
No tomorrow, will I live through this day?
No tomorrow, my life's on the line
No tomorrow, there is still time

Intrepid, our leaders
Decisive, the final blow
Destruction, great defeat
Carnage, across the land

No tomorrow, evil has it's way
No tomorrow, will I live through this day?
No tomorrow, my life's on the line
No tomorrow, there is still time
