I've seen the lights of destruction
Hot glow of death in the sky
Cities and buildings lay wasted
People left helpless to die

Watch the sky
Death is near
You are falling
The final day is near

Satan's death armies approaching
To capture lost souls of the dead
Implying his will as he pleases
The final damnation ahead

Watch the sky
Death is near
You are falling
The final day is here

The wrath of gods fury is searching
Calling the righteous abound
Decaying dead bodies are burning
Nothing left living is found

Watch the sky
Death is near
You are falling
The final day is near
