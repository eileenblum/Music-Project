We'll hit the blazing stage
In a glare of smoke and fire
We will provide the metal
Just for your desire

We have arrived [4x]

We're on the top now
And the lights are shining bright
We're faster than ever
Can you feel how tight
We'll thrash you with our spikes
Can you take the power
Can you take the strain

We have arrived [4x]

Now the lights are off now
And the curtain is closed
We'll keep moving on
Another town another load

We have arrived [4x]
