The master knows all temptations
He'll bring you to your knees
And when you think
That your through
He will spring on you

Hell's on its knees [3x]

He's coming to get you
He'll drive right through you
He'll burn you alive
When you find him
You fly right to him
You feel him breathe

Hell's on its knees [3x]

The ride is over you try to turn
Now it's your turn so burn
You go too fast your soul will fly
It will will fly up high
The master knows all temptations
He'll bring you to your knees
But when you think
That your through
He will spring on you

Hell's on its knees [3x]
