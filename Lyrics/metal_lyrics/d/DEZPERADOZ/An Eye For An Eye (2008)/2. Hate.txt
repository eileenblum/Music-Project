My daddy tried to teach me with the backside of his land
Wherever life will take me thereâs things that make a man
These holy lies, my mother cries, my only hope as times went by
To learn it on my own, leave this fearful home

The third thing is youâre all alone
Keeper of your fate
The second thing is the holy book
But at first...
At first I learned to hate!

My mother tried to raise me, to be a honest man
A savior she could not be, just swallowed up the pain
She closed her eyes, a wasted life, my fatherâs sins, my mother died
She left me all alone, the seed of hate was born

The third thing is youâre all alone
Master of your fate
The second thing is the holy book
But at first...
At first I learned to hate!

The first thing that youâve done to me, father
Was my procreation day

And at first...
I learned to hate
