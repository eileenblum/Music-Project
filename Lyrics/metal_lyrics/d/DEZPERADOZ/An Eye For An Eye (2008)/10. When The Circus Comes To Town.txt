Now I will be a hero from a town so far away
Stranger in a strange land of wicked lifeless shades
For sure Iâm gonna bring you, this bloody destiny
To execute for the love of God, his even handed will

The bells of justice chime for me
My step is quiet and cold
Real soon Godâs rage for all to see
Canât wait here anymore

When the circus comes to town
And the madness will invite you
Thereâs a sweet and bitter way
To get rid of things inside you

When the lights are turning âround
And the crowd is screaminâ and biding
Then the freak show has begun
When the circus comes to town

Where wicked clowns are hiding
They will creep into your head
Will be climbing down your spine
They will hide under your bed

The bells of justice chime for me
My step is quiet and cold
Real soon Godâs rage for all to see
Canât wait here anymore

When the circus comes to town
And the madness will invite you
Thereâs a sweet and bitter way
To get rid of things inside you

So I found him finally
On this place of Helter Skelter
And will kill him now indeed
With a trick and with a...

The audience eyes are scared
And before the curtainâs falling
I am bending down my head
The applauding crowd is calling

When the circus comes to town
And the madness will invite you
I stare my demons down
When the circus comes to town
