Now darkness falls across the land
Iâm still there on my way
I follow him through desert sand
Through haze and through the rain
Still canât believe what he has done
He took my love away
All or none, my chance is gone
...it might be that Iâm born in deep disgrace
My stony promised way
Live my fate to keep the faith
Itâs maybe not too late
For me to ride against the skies
With Jesus by my side
I pay the price for a paradise

When heaven will send a poor man down
And no one will be turned around
For those who pray for a judgement day
Iâll shot him to the ground
May heaven strike me down

That divine sight, it takes my breath
It takes my breath away
I raise my hands up to the light
With a gun and start to pray
Will climb the stairs into the air
To our deathless kingdom come
The sinnerâs head under my arm

Now darkness falls across the land
Iâm still there on my way
I follow through the desert sand
Through haze and through the rain
