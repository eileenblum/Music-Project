Still sittinâ here in my dead manâs coat
A lonely end on a winding road
That was my time, a wasted life
The devilâs waitinâ
I have to ride

The sun is up, I hear them come
To kill the man that Iâve become
Thereâs no way out, Iâll pay my dues
And eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth

So understand
The fifth command
