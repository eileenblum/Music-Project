Wild times until we die
Wild times wonât go by
This golden ace of thunder will be mine

I see you be afraid
Donât be charmed
You better lock your door
So be alarmed

There is no way to stop us now
There is no way to hide
Weâre ridinâ straight into your town
Weâre rollinâ in for those

Wild times will be
The best days left for me
Wild times we rise
We celebrate wild times

Booze and girls will kill us fast
Canât get enough
Forget the noisy past
Times gettinâ rough
