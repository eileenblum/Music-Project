What have you done?
With that youâve signed your doom
Was it a pleasured fun
To violate her dude?

She was just a little whore
A little beast, one thingâs for sure
Better be thankful
Better be glad
So donât be a fool
Get even not mad

If you want to stay alive
Donât cross my bloody way

So you want to play this bloody game
Iâll be here to stay
The sinner met the saint

I will hunt you for the rest of your days
Will find and will break you
Better start to pray
Once we were brothers
Friends all in fame
Now the worms in my barrel
Will crawl in your brain

Believe you stay without a scratch
Think even Iâm insane

Here comes the pain
Here comes the pain

And if you want to stay alive
Donât cross my bloody way
Here comes the pain
Here comes the pain

Pain!
