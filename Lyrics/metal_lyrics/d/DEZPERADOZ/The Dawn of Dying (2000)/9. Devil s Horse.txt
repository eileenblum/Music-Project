riding the devil's horseI'm riding the devil's horse the sinister curse has me in it's spelldegraded scalps that adorn me so welland every time when your death glare meets minea phantom is gazing through cynical eyesbounded so faithful by spiritual beastsscattering splendors of worshipping deedsno mercy will pump out the damned tears in mepredominant signs bring just tragedyto the perdition - that keeps me alive riding the devil's horseI'm riding the devil's horsethe devil's horse it whispers to me with languishing lipsthe evil is hunger and the fire I breatheI know that there're two ways for me to walk onwithin my rage under final commandand power was given to me by the swordthe day of my wrath who'll be able to standnobody surviving the passage of bloodand hell follows me when I'm rising upso follow my trace - to the destiny riding the devil's horseI'm riding the devil's horse...the devil's horse
