hells breaking loose when the daltons rodeterrorizing aims get off the groundfellows-hip by brotherhood in armsdespising law and order, got remandtheir soul has slept in cold eclipseroused by fighting spiritfollowing the promised way straightto the dawn of dyingdancing to the beat of the singing gunsanother soul is passing byat the dawn of dyingthe dawn of dying barrels sight their heads in coffevillelured into the trap the end is nearat least the dead await the final stormbaptized in fire, bodies to adornbullets flow dehumanizedbut the purge is donewithin the one who told the storywithin the truth about the gloryof the dawn of dyingthe dawn of dying forever crucified at the judgement's wooden spinethe final pulse of historyforever buried there where the others lieold west infinityperfect genocide is computerizedthe laughing face of death aroundthe warning that nobody realizedwill take us to the dawnthe dawn of dyingthe dawn of dying
