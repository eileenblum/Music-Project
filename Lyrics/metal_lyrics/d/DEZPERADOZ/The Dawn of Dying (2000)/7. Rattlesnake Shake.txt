a rattlesnake shakea rattlesnake shakepursued like a wounded deerbranded inhumanitycrime controlledwild instinct to stay alivethe morning that will never diefire down belowdeep in my mindcan't be deniedout of sight like a rattlesnake shakea rattlesnake shakelike a rattlesnake shakea rattlesnake shake when they set my skin on firelast resort desireI can't resistthe man they couldn't catchis the man they couldn't hangthey'll spiteful kissedbalanced on the edgeinseminated deathskeletons left behind by a rattlesnake shakea rattlesnake shakeby a rattlesnake shakea rattlesnake shake blessed by the godswhich path will he takevisions of freedomthat never awakethey don't shoot him downand they don't hang him upbut the rattlesnake's biteand the sun burning blacka rattlesnake shake...
