threatening predominant thunder growlssending felonious packs of houndsdust covered the peace from bad to the worsethe silly red breed was about to burst a place where the angels got prostitudesand gods are precursors of breaking rulescasting a gloom over those who believethat beasts could be changed into human beings in dodge citythat beasts could be changed into human beings in dodge city denaturalized in a sea full of bloodno security to find in this crimson muddishonouered town too tough to dielike a leaf that is caught in the endless tide a place where the angels got prostitudesand gods are precursors of breaking rulescasting a gloom over those who believethat beasts could be changed into human beings in dodge citythat beasts could be changed into human beings in dodge city
