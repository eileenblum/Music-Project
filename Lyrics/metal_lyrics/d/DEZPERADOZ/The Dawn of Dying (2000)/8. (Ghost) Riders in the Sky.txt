[Country song cover by Stan Jones]

An old cowboy went out on a dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged sky and up a cloudy draw.

Yippie aye-aaa, yippie aye-ooh.
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire
and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shining
and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him
as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders coming hard
and he heard their mournful cry.

Yippie aye-aaa, yippie aye-ooh.
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred
and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're riding hard to catch that head
but they ain't caught them yet,
'cause they've got to ride forever
on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting as they ride
and hear their awful cry

Yippie aye-aaa, yippie aye-ooh.
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him
he heard one calls his name
If you want to save your soul
from hell riding on your range
Then cowboy change your ways today
or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd
across these endless skies

Yippie aye-aaa, yippie aye-ooh.
Ghost riders in the sky.
