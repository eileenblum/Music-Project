praying to the wretched beastsmaybe they can forgivethe warriors of haunted soulsand common maverickssorrows of their inner lifeshope burned down in flamesa king would trade his finest crownto get out of their way hearts will break a thousand timesnot even just in dreamsguns will wait a thousand nightsgone with the windgone with the wind dying with their boots onthe shadows of the proudstill sounding in their earsthe mating call of goldpla-ces of immortalitymillions sacred tombsno medicine will ever healthat never healing wounds hearts will break a thousand timesnot even just in dreamsguns will wait a thousand nightsgone with the windgone with the wind upon a land where glory liesthe might of suns and moonseternally under the skycovered by the truthwhen gods would lay their weapons downand no more war to fightyou'll see em at the long horizonfinally unite gone with the windgone with the wind
