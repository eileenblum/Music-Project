I dreamt I was in heavenamong the angel's goldfeeded by a pleasant handthat dealt the playing cardsno sorts of bones whatevercreeping on the ground'cause bonds of faith may always severbut my gun is still aroundnow I just found a gamelike a mortal upper storyplay the final showdown scene'til you are gone to gloryboth friends and foes agreeaccused of breaking lawsthere is no money in this secret boxthe fodder to my pursemaybe I am wrongmaybe I am rightmaybe I'm not strong enoughmaybe I will dielike a tawny snakein a torrid climethe twilight'til the dawn of timemaybe I disclaim my honourmaybe I will jumping down the running train -jumping down the running train- jumping down the running trainthe ballade of Jesse Jamesthere was a little ladyshe was twined in golden hairdon't want to take her to my heart'cause dollars doesn't smellshe felt down on her kneesI cant forget the sound'cause bonds of faith may always severbut my gun is still aroundfrom the deepground of the oceanto the top of mountains highwhere love threw up the spongefear got the upper handan insidious bullet from behindthe coffin let me learnthere's no money in this secret boxjust fodder to the wormsmaybe...
