nowhere to runand nowhere to hidesing the songyou better keep insidewith loaded gunson holy groundlike a deadly punchdesperados in town nowhere to runand nowhere to hidedon't try to be strongdon't even try to fightfor when we'll be goneyou might still be aroundand you sing this song'cause desperados in town showdown has comewith deadly soundit's a quick draw gamedesperados in town nowhere to runand nowhere to hide...
