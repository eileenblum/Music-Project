Now I know - my time is coming
I'm waiting for - the curtain to fall
The sun hangs low - night is calling
All that remains - are trails in the sand
Washed away as my last day ends

The load was long - a hell of a journey
We've reached the end - and nothing left to say
Take out your gun - and do me the honors
Send me on my way - my dear old friend

I smile as my last day ends.
I smile when I'm angry, through sunshine and rain
I had my share - of good and bad, of passion and fame
I smile when I'm angry, I walked through the flames
From ashes to ashes, from sand to sand
I smile as my last day ends

I should have run - way across the border
I should have run - way down to Mexico
I changed my mind - 'cause I was longing for her
I went down this road to hell with empty hands

Now I know - my time is coming
I'm waiting for - the curtain to fall
The sun hangs low - night is calling
All that remains - are trails in the sand
Washed away as my last day ends
