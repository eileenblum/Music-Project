Can you feel the heat
Do ya avoid this town
The tempting city streets, I'll take ya
Down in the devils playground baby
Down in the darkest pit
Where they lace your palm with silver honey
And never let you quit
Till you cross the line
To the other side
For the perfect crime swallow your pride

Another day another dollar baby
Living on borrowed time
With each and every step I take I hustle
The Silver City Shuffle

Got a fist full of hungry anger
More than aces up my sleeve
The smile of an angel and the speed of the devil
And I'll never rest in peace
So don't step on my blue suede shoes
Don't even think of looking twice
I may look young, I may look nice
But look straight into my eyes
When you cross the line
You'll see my other side
Of Blood and crime pain and pride

Another day another dollar baby
Living on borrowed time
With each and every step I take I hustle
Another day another dollar baby
Living on borrowed time
With each and every step I take I hustle
The Silver City Shuffle

Another day another dollar baby
Living on borrowed time
With each and every step I take I hustle
Another day another dollar baby
Living on borrowed time
With each and every step I take I'll hustle
And again I hustle
Silver City Shuffle
