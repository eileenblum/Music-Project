People seem to walk faster
When they pass in front of the house
Mothers grab out of their children
And hope that they don't hear us shout

We take what we want when we see it
'cause no one can push us around
The states politicians
like dimes in our pockets
We make them dance to our sound

'Cause time and time again
Everything comes with a price
The crime that's in our hand
We're rolling it just like the dice

We stepped on one toe too many
And that's when it all went South
They call them regulators
They're trying to bring down the house

Daily our Numbers decreasing
We can't seem to find a way out
It's raining down fire
Blood and desire
To burn us down to the ground

Bullets and bones
Can break more than sticks and stones
Bullets and, bullets and bones
The Kid almost did it alone
With bullets, bullets and bones
