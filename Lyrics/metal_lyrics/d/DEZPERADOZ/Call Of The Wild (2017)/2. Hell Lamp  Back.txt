Gather round and listen to my tale.
Let me take you back before the train derailed.

What you know ain't even half the truth.
Come and walk with me a mile in Billy's shoes.

Things ain't always what they seem.
Sometimes your caught right in between.
When you feel the noose around your neck,
Then you've been riding down the road

To Hell And Back

Good is bad and sometimes bad is good.
A righteous man did what he thought he should.
He took a chance and hell broke loose broke.
Come and walk with me a mile in Billy's shoes.

It ain't never what they seem.
Sometimes you're caught right in between.
When you feel the noose around your neck,
Then you've been riding down the road

To Hell And Back
To Hell And Back
On Devils track
To Hell And Back

So grab a seat and better hold on tight.
Get ready for the dark and painful ride.
What you know ain't even half the truth.
Come and walk with me a mile in Billy's shoes.
