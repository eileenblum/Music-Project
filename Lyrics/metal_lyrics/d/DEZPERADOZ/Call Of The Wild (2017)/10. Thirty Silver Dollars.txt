They promised me to biggest name
If I would only play their game
I signed on that dotted line

For my promised land
And the devil shook my hand

Horse riding, gun slinging
Killer on the run
And I'm always one step behind
I won't rest, I can't rest
Until he meets my gun
And I'll know the price for my soul
30 silver dollars to hold

I'm trying every trick in the book
I'm dangling every bait from my hook
I'm sure that I can trade him in
A badge for another sin
He's proven one too many times
His tricks are so much better than mine
He won't let me take him alive
And the devil shook my hand
For my promised land

Horse riding, gun slinging
Killer on the run
And I'm always one step behind
I won't rest, I can't rest
Until he meets my gun
And I'll know the price for my soul
Horse riding, gun slinging
Killer on the run
And I'm always one step behind
I won't rest, I can't rest
Until he meets my gun
And I'll know the price for my soul
30 silver dollars to hold
