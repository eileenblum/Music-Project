Mine is the anger, mine is the pain
Toeing the line between laughter and pain
It all started easy, it all started sane
Mama used to say the world will know my name

Silver city and I'm on my own
A boy not a man from a broken home
All I could tell was right from wrong
Like ripping the flesh from my broken bone

When the darkness calls my name

Ain't no use in trying to fight
Take it in till the break of light

Call of freedom, call of the night
One hand on the bible and a gun by my side
I can see them, I hear them ride
They won't hold me from the call
The call of the wild

Mine was the anger, mine was the pain
I thought that I found some peace again
First came the thunder, then pouring rain
Bringing the anger right back again

Call of freedom, call of the night
One hand on the bible and a gun by my side
I can see them, I hear them ride
They won't hold me from the call
The call of the wild

Call of freedom, call of the night
One hand on the bible and a gun by my side
I can see them, I hear them ride
They won't hold me from the call
The call of the wild
