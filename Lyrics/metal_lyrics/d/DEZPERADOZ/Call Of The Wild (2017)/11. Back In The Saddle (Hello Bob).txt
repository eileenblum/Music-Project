Down by the river
At the break of dawn
Praying that the mountain creek can purify my soul
My hands in the water
I watch the streams of red
I thought that I had found my peace
But I was pulled right back

From New York to Arizona
Down to New Mexico
Everyone will know my name
Wherever I may go

I saddled up my horse
Grabbed my rifle and my gun
I'm not an evil villain
I'm an outlaw on the run

Oh, Lord
I'm riding through the gates of hell
Oh, Lord
Won't you guide me on my way?
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm taking my luck in my hands
Nowhere left but up
I'll fight right to the top
I'm the one who says when it ends
Back in the saddle again

An eye for an eye
A life filled with lust
I'll light the world on fire
And watch it burn to dust

Finally I'm famous
A price upon my head
I can hear them coming
Won't rest 'til I am dead

Oh, Lord
I'm opening the gates to hell
I say
Oh, Lord
You have to look away
While you guide my on my rocky way to fame

I'm back in the saddle again
I'm taking my luck in my hands
Nowhere left but up
I'll fight right to the top
I'm the one who says when it ends
Once again I say

I'm back in the saddle again
I'm taking my luck in my hands
Nowhere left but up
I'll fight right to the top
I'm the one who says when it ends
Back in the saddle again

Down by the river
At the break of dawn
Praying that the mountain creek can purify my soul

I'm back in the saddle again
Taking my luck in my hands
Nowhere left but up
I'll fight right to the top
I'm the one who says when it ends
Once again 'cause...

I'm back in the saddle again
Taking my luck in my hands
Nowhere left but up
I'll fight right to the top
'Cause I'm the one who says when it ends
Back in the saddle
I'm back in the saddle
'Cause I'm back in the saddle again
