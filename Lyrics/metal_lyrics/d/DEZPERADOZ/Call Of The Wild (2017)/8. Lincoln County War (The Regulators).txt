They found him one morning lying on the ground
His white horse lay dead by his side
They knew it was time to turn it all around
They knew that they picked the wrong fight

Amigos por siempre
Hermanos muerte

Smoke and blood and crying eyes
The only thing you saw
Was only what was left behind
The regulators call

The Kid and the others were thirsty for some blood
They offered their payback in led
Made the earth tremble and the sun was burning hot
They painted their bullets in red

Smoke and blood and crying eyes
The only thing you saw
Was only what was left behind
The regulators call

Amigos por siempre
Hermanos muerte

Smoke and blood and crying eyes
The only thing you saw
Was only what was left behind
Lincoln Country War

They saddled up the horses
And took their guns to town
Spilling their blood in the sand
Kicking in all doors
And they burnt it to the ground
Again and again and again

Smoke and blood and crying eyes
The only thing you saw
Was only what was left behind
The regulators call

Amigos por siempre
Hermanos muerte

Smoke and blood and crying eyes
The only thing you saw
Was only what was left behind
Lincoln Country War

From Michigan to Arkansas
from east down to the west
The story was painted in black
Good guys made villains,
the worst were made the best
The hangman was counting the necks

Amigos por siempre
Hermanos muerte

Smoke and blood and crying eyes
The only thing you saw
Was only what was left behind
The regulators
Smoke and blood and crying eyes
The only thing you saw
Was only what was left behind
Lincoln Country War
