Mama always told me,
Son grew up strong, act like a man
she brought me up loved and held me.
I try to keep word mom, if I can

OhhOh, I try to find my way of living and I live my way of life
Ridin' all the long way home

Now I grew up n keep on searching,
I am on my way... still on my ride
I am on the loose, but I just can't win
I think it's a story of my life

OhhOh, I try to find my way of living and I live my way of life
Ridin' all the long way home

Where ever you may be now,
watch over me and rest in peace
You've done more could have asked for
Don't you worry, there's no need

OhhOh, I try to find my way of living and I live my way of life
No more sorrow, all is forgiven
filled with passion, filled with pride

Ridin' all the long way home...

Mama always told me - now it's in my flesh... it's in my bones
Ridin' all the long way home...
