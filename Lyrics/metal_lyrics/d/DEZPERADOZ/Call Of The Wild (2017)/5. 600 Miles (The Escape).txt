Hot desert dirt and sand
Filling up my lungs
A sting in every breath
Under the midday sun

Head hanging low
600 miles and more
My steps are slow
600 miles to go

No rest for the wicked
Got gunmen on my trail
I ain't gonna kick it
Ain't going back to jail

I'm smiling at the vultures
I'm kicking up the sand
I know I'm gonna make it
I'll find my promised land

Head hanging low
600 miles and more
I'm treading slow

600 miles
To ride through the desert
Through wind and through the rain
Praying for some water
For shelter from the pain
600 miles of fire
The world will know my name
Head hanging low
600 miles to go

Let them try and catch me
Silver dollars for my head
Six gun right beside me
With a barrel full of led
