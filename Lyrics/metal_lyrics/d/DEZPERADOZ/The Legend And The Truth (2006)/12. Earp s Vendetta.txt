A loaded gun
A moving heart
Some people think
Revenge is the best part
Better not more
Keep your head low
You know when he gets you
Heâll do it real slow

Think if you may live or not
It takes much more than you have got
Raging uncontrolled
This is the Earpâs vendetta
Itâs gonna bring you down
This is the Earpâs vendetta
Judgement Day has come

Dressed in black
Right on his way
You know heâll get you
Itâs your turn to pay
A fistful of anger
Start to pray
The man in black
Has come to stay

Think if you may live or not
It takes much more than you have got
Raging uncontrolled
This is the Earpâs vendetta
Itâs gonna bring you down
This is the Earpâs vendetta
Judgement Day has come
