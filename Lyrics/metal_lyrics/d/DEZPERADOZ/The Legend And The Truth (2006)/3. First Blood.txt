Iâve gone and got myself
In trouble, full of hate
Changing all my ways
Before it was too late

Shade of red is all I see
I could not hold my tears
Fragments of what used to be
Another fate was sealed
Donât believe it wonât come true
Itâll happen soon to me and you
People say you canât deny
Your blood runs hot before you die

First blood
I never will forget
This day that changed my life
First blood
Is filling up my head
When I close my eyes
First blood

A dying man lies in the dirt
A bullet in his face
Heâs twitching as he wets himself
In this godforsaken place
For those who kill their fellow man
Donât you cross my way?
For you I am the law
On this, your dying day

Donât believe it wonât come true
Itâll happen soon to me and you
People say you canât deny
When your blood runs hot before you die

First blood
I never will forget
This day that changed my life
First blood
Is filling up my head
When I close my eyes
First blood
And even though you try
You can run but you cannot hide
First blood
Whoâs mamma gonna cry
As the time goes by
First blood
