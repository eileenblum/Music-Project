My father had no time for me
Drunk was all that he could be
Used to beat my mama just to see
If her blood is red and warm like me
I gotta put him six feet down
But I donât know where

Now Iâm old enough to know
My youth is what made me stone-cold
That is all you need to know
Why people really hate me so
Dodge City is the town to be
On horseback my whole bunch and me
Playing cards, drinking whiskey
Till Wyatt came and stopped the heat
I gotta put him six feet down
But I donât know where
I really donât know where

Câmon folks and dance with me
The Hell-, Hellbilly Square

This Wyatt is an angry man
The toughest marshal on this land
The last guy that will ever stand
His cut off balls back in his hand
I gotta put him six feet down
But I donât know where
I really donât know where

Câmon boys and make a stand
Take those ladies by the hand
And dance the Hellbilly Square
Dance the Hellbilly Square

He made us leave our guns or go
Dodge City ainât the same no more
Last night as I was with a whore
She said to me: One thing is for sure
You ought to put him six feet down
And you should know where
You really should know where

Câmon boys and make a stand
Take those ladies by the hand
And dance the Hellbilly Square
So letâs dance
