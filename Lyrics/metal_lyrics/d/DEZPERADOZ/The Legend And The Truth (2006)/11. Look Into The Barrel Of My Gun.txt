Down, down
Down, down

I tried to hold my, hold my head up high
You were the weight around my neck
When I spread out, spread my wings to fly
You tore them right off my back

Can you feel the power of my pain?
Come and show your face if you dare
Iâm bringing you

Down, down
Shoot âem all down
Look into the barrel of my gun
Down, down
Shoot âem all down
Do you think your time has come?

Iâm gonna meet you when the clock strikes twelve
Iâm gonna wipe that smile off your face
But I found you with a hole in your head
Well, I guess I came a bit too late

Can you feel the power of my pain?
Come and show your face if you dare
Iâm bringing you down

Down, down
Shoot âem all down
Look into the barrel of my gun
Down, down
Shoot âem all down
Do you think your time has come?
