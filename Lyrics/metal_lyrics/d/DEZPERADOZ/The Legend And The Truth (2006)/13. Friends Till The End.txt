Doc heard a man had come to town
As at his dying bed he lies
Heâs here to take his brother down
Docâs deed before he dies
He knows when they are gonna meet
He knows what he has to do
Heâs walking down the empty street
Got one more thing to do

Friends till the end - itâs more than a word, an eternal hand
Friends till the end - much more you understand
Friends till the â¦

Behold this man from far away
As heâs reaching for his gun
Heâs lucky on his dying day
This quickdraw game just won
He leans the man there on the tree
Pulls his hat down to his eyes
The only thing that he can see
His brother is longer alive

Friends till the end - itâs more than a word, an eternal hand
Friends till the end - much more you understand
Friends till the end - an act of forgiveness to finalize
Friends till the end - straight between the eyes

Heâs going back into his room
The challenge he has killed
He knows that death is coming soon
To save his brotherâs soul is fulfilled

Friends till the end - itâs more than a word, an eternal hand
Friends till the end - much more you understand
Friends till the end - an act of forgiveness to finalize
Friends till the end - straight between the eyes
