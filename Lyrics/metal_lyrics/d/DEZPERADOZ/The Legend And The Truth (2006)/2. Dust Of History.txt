Take my hand and follow me
Iâll open up your eyes
Letâs travel back in history
Now watch a legend rise
Wyatt never harmed a man
Never took what was not his
The devil had another plan
His own dirty little list

People spread so many lies
But this here is the truth
Our journey is ending as he dies
Beginning at his youth

Join me
I will show you
Follow me
Through the dust of history

The loss of love ripped out his heart
He lost his will to live
A good man had just turned to bad
He had no more to give
The man will not exist no more
He has to get it straight
With pride he fights, upholds the law
Powered by his hate

People spread so many lies
But this here is the truth
Our journey is ending as he dies
Beginning at his youth

So join me
I will show you
Follow me
Through the dust of history

Trust me
Let me prove to you
Come with me
Through the dust of history

Trust me
Follow me
So trust me
Follow me
