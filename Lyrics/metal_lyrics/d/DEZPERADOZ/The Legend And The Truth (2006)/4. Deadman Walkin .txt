Standing at the burning house
Memories going round
Of what he has done and what should be
Feels like falling down
Emotions keep on running wild
While loosing all around
Life seems like a tragedy
Lost what he had found
Packed up his belongings
Saddled up his horse
Left this town in agony
Left with this remorse
A gunman on his way to hell
The sun is going down
Has to do what must be done
Deadman on the run
Until the time has come
Had to carry on
Always on the run
Shadows of the past
It seems like a Deadman walkinâ
His loneliness is more than pain
Drying out his heart
Former leader of the pack
Looking for a start
He used to work hard every day
Rugged and handsome pal
Salvation, it has crossed his way
With the one so hard to find
Time for joy has been so short
And good has changed to bad
Beloved wife died in a year
And took with her his lad
He donât know what heâs fighting for
Glory and for fame
His past is buried in Lamar
The whole world is to blame
Until the time has come
Had to carry on
Always on the run
Shadows of the past
It seems like a Deadmanâ¦
All his life, all his pride
The bleeding never ends
All the shadows of the dead
Will get him now at last
He looks for reasons in the planes
Trouble is all he found
Just a man of circumstance
Gets back up the ground
The hangman has its bloody rope
Tied around his neck
The reaper is gonna have to wait
Your number is not up yet
Until the time has come
Had to carry on
Until the time has come
Shadows of the dead
Well, it seems like a Deadman walkinâ
