Justice Day, the time has come
Silence before the storm
Side by side theyâre marching straight
Four brothers face another fate

Did not go to sleep last night
Just waiting for the end of time
There is no way back
There is no return
Now guns will talk and skies will burn
Who felt the wind will earn the

Storm will live inside their minds
Nothing else can set them free
No guardians to draw the line
And they know itâs gonna be
The march to destiny

Behan got into their way
To give that scum security
He looked into the marshalâs eyes
And scared to death he stepped aside

Now they all will pay the price
You pushed me once, donât push me twice
Here is the moment of the truth
Throw up your hands and donât try to move
Who felt the wind will earn the

Storm will live inside their minds
Nothing else can set them free
No guardians to draw the line
And they know itâs gonna be
The march to destiny
