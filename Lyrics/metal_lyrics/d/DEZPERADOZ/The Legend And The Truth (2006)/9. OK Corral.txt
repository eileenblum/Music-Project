Now the Judgement Day has come
Clouds of hate will hide the sun
The seed of hate on fertile ground
Who sow the wind will earn the storm
There is just a man that you can trust
A deadman walkinâ through his past

The tongueless past now filled with sorrow
Infested like there is no tomorrow
At the OK Corral
Down at the OK Corral
So close to hell

Keep your hand close to your gun
And no confidence in anyone
Youâve been looking for a fight
You got your peace, so hold it tight
Smoke and blood get in your eyes
When brotherhood will rise to fight

The tongueless past now filled with sorrow
And infested like there is no tomorrow
At the OK Corral
Down at the OK Corral
So close to hell
