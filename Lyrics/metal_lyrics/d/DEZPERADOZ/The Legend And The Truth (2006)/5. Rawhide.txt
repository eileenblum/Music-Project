Rollinâ, rollinâ, rollinâ
Though the streams are swollen
Keep them doggies rollinâ?
Rawhide

Through rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather
Wishing my girl was by my side
All the things Iâm missinâ
Good vittles, love and kissinâ
Are waiting at the end of my ride

Move âem on â Head âem up
Head âem up â Move âem on
Move âem on â Head âem up
Rawhide
Cut âem out â Ride âem in
Ride âem in â Cut âem out
Cut âem out â Ride âem in
Rawhide

Keep movinâ, movinâ, movinâ
Though theyâre disapprovinâ
Keep them doggies movinâ?
Rawhide

Donât try to understand âem
Just rope and throw and brand âem
Soon weâll be living high and wide
My heart is calculatinâ
My true love will be waitinâ
Be waitinâ at the end of my ride

Move âem on â Head âem up
Head âem up â Move âem on
Move âem on â Head âem up
Rawhide
Cut âem out â Ride âem in
Ride âem in â Cut âem out
Cut âem out â Ride âem in
Rawhide
