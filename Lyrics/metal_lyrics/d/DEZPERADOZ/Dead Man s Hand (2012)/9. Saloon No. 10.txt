From my polished boots to my stetson hat.
I can  not loose, what you think about that?
I'm A well dressed man, I can feel them stare.
With just one smile I get offered A chair.

Painted cat sits on my lap. 
Got aces up my sleeve.
The others face is dripping wet.
One more hand and he will  leave.

Green eyed monsters by my side.
Pay attention, hold on tight.

Swinging doors, pull me in and open on their own.
A deck of cards. 
An empty seat. 
This whorehouse feels like home.

My pocket full with dollar bills to spend.
And so here I'm standing once again.
In my Saloon No. 10

High stakes only thats how I roll.
Am I too much? Are you afraid to fall?
My guns are blazing, you can see 'em shine.
I'm so amazing. What is yours will now be...

...Mine is better than yours instead...
...yours can't rival to mine.
Fortune and fame, got no regrets.
Mercy, I'll leave you A dime.

Green eyed monsters by my side.
Pay attention, hold on tight.

Swinging doors, pull me in and open on their own.
A deck of cards. 
An empty seat. 
This whorehouse feels like home.

My pocket full with dollar bills to spend.
And so here I'm standing once again.
In my Saloon No. 10

Swinging doors, pull me in and open on their own.
A deck of cards. 
An empty seat. 
This whorehouse feels like home.

Swinging doors, pull me in and open on their own.
The story ends.
Dead man's hand.
In my Saloon No. 10
