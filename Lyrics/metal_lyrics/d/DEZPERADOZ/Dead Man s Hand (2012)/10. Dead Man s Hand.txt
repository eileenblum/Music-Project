Misery likes company, that ain't my kind of game.
You know I've been to hell &amp; back, the devil knows my name.

Against all odds, I got the hand.
I won't back down, tonight it ends.
An ace of spades, A pair of eights.
And one more ace my friend.
A jockers sick and twisted glance.
Completes my dead man's hand.

My tired eyes, my heavy heart but still I'm holding on.
Been waiting for my  promised land since the day that I was born.

Against all odds, I got the hand.
I won't back down, tonight it ends.
An ace of spades, A pair of eights.
And one more ace my friend.
A jockers sick and twisted glance.
Completes my dead man's hand.

My dead man's hand.
Dead Man's hand!

Against all odds, I got the hand.
I won't back down, tonight it ends.
An ace of spades, A pair of eights.
And one more ace my friend.
A jockers sick and twisted glance.
Completes my dead man's hand.

My dead man's hand.
Dead Man's hand!
