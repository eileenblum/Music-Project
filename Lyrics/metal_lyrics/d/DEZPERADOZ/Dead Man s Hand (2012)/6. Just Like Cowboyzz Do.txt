When I wake up in the morning, the first thing that I do.
Pour me another tall one and I stumble to the loo.
I'm thinking, while I sit there, what this world is coming to.
What happen to old values?
Do it like the cowboys do, that's right.

How 'bout A manly handshake, A word that still has weight.
Few scars so you can prove that, life ain't A piece of cake.
Grinning teeth, lying eyes, words that aren't true.
Corporate suits for everyone, including me and you.

Let it roll, here we go, you are welcom to the show.
Take A seat, grab A drink and enjoy.
Let it roll, here we go, ride with me and free your soul.
Saddle up and put on your boots.
Just do it like the cowboys do.

When I go out in the evening, the things that suit me well...
...is old kentucky bourbon and A tipsy southern bell.
She won't let me see the bottom of my frosted whisky glass.
She's pouring like A kitten when she's grinding on my lap.

Let it roll, here we go, you are welcom to the show.
Take A seat, grab A drink and enjoy.
Let it roll, here we go, ride with me and free your soul.
Saddle up and put on your boots.
Just like the cowboys do.
Like the cowboys do.
Just do it like the cowboys do.
Like the cowboys do.
That's right.

Now listen:
When I wake up in the morning, the first thing that I do.
Pour me another tall one and I stumble to the loo.
Grinning teeth, lying eyes, words that aren't true.
Corporate suits for everyone, including me and you.

Let it roll, here we go, welcome to the rodeoTake A seat, grab A drink and enjoy.
Let it roll, here we go, ride with me and free your soul.
Be A man and stand true to your roots.
Saddle up and put on your boots.
Just like the cowboys do.
Do it like the cowboys do.
Like the cowboys do.
