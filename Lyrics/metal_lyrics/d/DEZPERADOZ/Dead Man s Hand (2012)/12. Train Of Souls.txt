Conductor with no eyes, looks at me and smiles.
And he's passing by, still hear my woman's cries.
As I hit the ground, where am I now?
A picture in my mind, of A crown of thorns.
And A fear of dawn, the deeds that I have done.
I can't take 'em back and I can't regret.

The lord has let me down, no use in praying.
There is no way out, out of this train.

'cause now...

I Ride the train of souls.
Which will take me down below.
No more tears, no more pain.
Hide your fears or cry in vain.
I ride the train of souls.
Which will take me down below.
I'm not alone, A thousand strong.
And blood runs cold, the train of souls.

The train of souls.

Little girl sits by my side, as she takes my hand.
She looks at me and says, "don't you dare, now won't you cry.
You are going down, you will wear that crown."

The lord has let me down, no use in praying.
There is no way out, out of this train.

'cause now...

I Ride the train of souls.
Which will take me down below.
No more tears, no more pain.
Hide your fears or cry in vain.
I ride the train of souls.
Which will take me down below.
I'm not alone, A thousand strong.
And blood runs cold, the train of souls.

The train of souls.
The train of souls.
The train of souls.

Stations running by, the seats are filling up.
Although we never stop, everyone who dies.
By A vicious hand, like A slaughtered lamb.

The lord has let me down, no use in praying.
There is no way out, out of this train.

The lord has let me down, no use in praying.
There is no way out, out of this train. 
Out of this fucking train.

'cause now...

I Ride the train of souls.
Which will take me down below.
No more tears, no more pain.
Hide your fears or cry in vain.
I ride the train of souls.
Which will take me down below.
I'm not alone, A thousand strong.
And blood runs cold, the train of souls.

I'm not alone, A million strong.
And blood runs cold, the train of souls.

The train of souls.
The train of souls.
