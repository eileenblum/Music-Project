People tried to dog me down.
Still  alive, I stood my ground.
I've walked the line, I've been around.
And trouble was all I found.

My hair is grey, my face is rough.
You see that I am man enough.
I've walked the line, I've been around.
And trouble was all I found.

I was there when Lennon found the wrong end of A gun.
I was there when Morison went with the setting sun.
Now that I am near the end and all is said and done.
I smile into the mirror, regrets I sure have none.
I had my share of good and bad, of fortune and of fame.
I treasure every memory 'cause none of them's the same.
As I look back I realize how well I played my part.
Deep inside this wild ol' rebel heart.

I never had A  lot to give but I gave it with A smile.
I never took the easy way, I've surely walked the mile
I had my share of good and bad, of fortune and of fame.
I treasure every memory 'cause none of them's the same.
As I look back I realize how well I played my part.
Deep inside this wild ol' rebel heart.
