You know well I did not start this. 
Sure as hell I'm gonna see it through.
Lady luck with her tender kiss.
Hides behind the truth.

My aching bones, my broken soul.
Have been down this road before.
I've paid my dues, I'll play this role.
On this winding road once more.

I don't do this 'cause I have to.
I do it cause I can.
Gonna wipe that grin off your face

Once again I'm the last man standing.
Once again I walk alone.
I leave another burned out town.
Standing on my own.
The last man stands alone.

You said that I could never make it.
(Now) you tell me who was the fool
I did some deeds I can't be proud of.
Things I just has to do.

You pushed me 'round, you kicked me down.
How much can one man take?
I've asked you once and I've told you twice.
Now it's time to even the slate.

I don't do this 'cause I have to.
I do it cause I can.
Gonna wipe that grin off your face

Once again I'm the last man standing.
Once again I walk alone.
I leave another burned out town.
Standing on my own.

Once again here's the last man standing.
Once again I'm walking tall.
I leave another burned out town.
Standing on my own.
The last man stands alone.
That's right.

Once again I'm the last man standing.
Once again I walk alone.
I leave another burned out town.
Standing on my own.

Once again here's the last man standing.
Once again I'm walking tall.
Another fuckin' burned out town.
Standing on my own.
The last man stands alone.
