Like an nunce in an opium den.
Like the fire of A dozen man.
Like smoke that clouds my brain.
I can taste the rage pumping in my veins.
Like two asian beauties on my left.
Like A snake I can taste their sweat.
Like the blade of A dear old friend.
Her tongue in my mouth reaching for the end.

Like A beast I can smell her breath.
Like the sweet bitter kiss of death.
Like A rattlesnake ready to kill.
I'm twirling around as the time stands still.
Like the sun burning up my skin.
Like my tears wash away my sins.
Like her body for my soul to rub.
I'm drinking lust from A golden cup.

I feel all I am is A lie, will I live or die?
Will I win in the end?
Blood in the bad, badlands.

Like sand up the hourglass.
Like A flame I can feel the wrath.
Like A coin falling through my hand.
Try to catch but I know I can't.
Like A roach crawling in my skin.
Like A saint I can feel my sin.
Like A roach running down my spine.
Oh, Lord can't you see that the nite is mine?

I feel all I am is A lie, will I live or die?
Will I win in the end?
Blood in the bad, badlands.

I feel all I am is A lie, will I live or die?
Will I win in the end?
Blood in the bad, badlands.

(Like an nunce in an opium den.
Like the fire of A dozen man.
Like smoke that clouds my brain.
I can taste the rage pumping in my veins.)

I feel all I am is A lie, will I live or die?
Will I win in the end?
Blood in the bad, badlands.

(Like an nunce in an opium den.
Like the fire of A dozen man.
...
Like an nunce in an opium den.
Like the fire of A dozen man.
Like smoke that clouds my brain.
I can taste the rage pumping in my veins.)

I feel all I am is A lie, will I live or die?
Will I win in the end?
Blood in the bad, badlands.
