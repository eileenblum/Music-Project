I got more than one good reason to keep A loaded Gun.
Payed too much for my freedom, ain't living on the run.
My eyes have seen the devil man, I'm slowly turning blind.
More than one good reason to say: yippie ya yeah.

A restless beast inside of me is waiting for its turn.
A california prayer book can make my fingers burn.
Until the day they lower me six feet in the ground.
Wherever there's A game of cards you'll see me hang around.
Now roll the dice.
Lady, luck is on my side.
One for the money, too for the show. 
Hold on tight, now here we go.

I got more than one good reason to keep A loaded Gun.
Payed too much for my freedom, ain't living on the run.
My eyes have seen the devil man, I'm slowly turning blind.
More than one good reason to say: yippie ya, yippie ya yeah.

When you're dancing with the devil man, you can't expect to lead.
I know that I can make him dance to the sound of my own beat.
He can't see through my poker face, nor through my dirty smile.
When the devil says my time is up, I'm going down in style.
Now roll the dice.
Lady, luck is on my side.
Common reaper deal the cards, A wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-bop-bam-boo

I got more than one good reason to keep A loaded Gun.
Payed too much for my freedom, ain't living on the run.
My eyes have seen the devil man, I'm slowly turning blind.
More than one good reason to say: yippie ya, yippie ya yeah.

That's right man.
I say:
yippie ya, yippie ya yeah.
yippie ya, yippie ya yeah.
yippie ya, yippie ya yeah.
yippie ya, yippie ya yeah.
yippie ya, yippie ya yeah.
yippie ya, yippie ya yeah.
yippie ya, yippie ya yeah.

I went down to the crossroads, to make myself A deal.
I gave away my rotten soul, had nothing left to feel.
I shook hands with devil man and as I turned away...
...I could hear the devil scream: yippie ya, yippie ya yeah.
