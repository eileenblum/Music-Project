Sing
For that is all that you can be
Sing
For that is how they can believe
Sing
For that is how you chase your dreams
And scream

I am not a song

Scream
For it's the only way they hear
Scream
To overcome all of your fears
Scream
Until you're dead and cannot speak

It scares me to know that I
Might simply be a product
Of my own convincing lies
I'm longing to see the time
To be able to externalize
And change the paradigms

I am trying
Desperately not to be what
I'm denying
Forging and faking the scars that
I am bearing
Proudly for them not to see what
I am hiding
Under the stars
I'm collecting down this road

Afraid
Of being forgotten, thrown away
Afraid
Of being gone without a trace
Betrayed
Afraid
Not to be more than just a name
Afraid
To keep on forcing, forging, faking

Afraid
To keep on searching for a chance
In vain
To keep relying on something
That might not even be a part of you

(Forgettable)
I am trying desperately not to be forgettable
I am dying to live with the monsters within my soul
