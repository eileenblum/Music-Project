A pair of wings
Formidable
Piercing through the night sky
Shadows the light
Reaching higher and higher
Only to find that the more you rise
The harder you fall
And you thought the dream
Could never end

See me falling from the skies
Shattering all hopes and left behind

And when you're down and out
It picks you up
Just to stab you in the back
With a trust-forged knife

A cage of steel
Invincible
Smothering around you
Blindfolds your eyes
Stops you from seeing who you can trust
Only to find that the more it hides
The lower you bow
And you thought the wounds
Would never mend

Your lies were only convincing me
To be what I'm not
Once I felt I was flying
But now my wings are paralyzed

Your eyes were only making me
A pale shadow
(Nurturing my darkest thoughts)
Crawling behind you when no longer
I had faith in me

[Solo]

And when you're down and out
It picks you up
Just to stab you in the back
With a trust-forged knife
