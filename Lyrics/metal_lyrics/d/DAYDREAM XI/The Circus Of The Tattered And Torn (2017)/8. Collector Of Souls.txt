Oh I've been down
That same old dark road
I've been down
Collecting souls

I've been down
That same old dark road
I've been down
Through the young and the old

I've been down
In a game of my own
I've been down
Not to be alone

No, I have been down
Loving no one
I've been down
Until I was done

I've been down
Who I didn't know
I've been down
Boys and girls

I'm down that road
I've seen before
Collector of souls
Going down once more

I long for your touch
Don't wanna hear you talk
You know I don't ask for much
You can keep the keys
But you won't see the lock

And when you're down on your knees
You're all I'm hoping for

Light the fire inside
I want to ignite the light in your eyes
I'm down that road once more
Collecting souls

I love the feel of your skin
And the way you walk
But I don't wanna hear a single thing
'Cause we're around the clock

I love the scent of your hair
And the way you moan
But I don't wanna be a friend tomorrow
Just give me your soul

And when you're down on all fours
I could not ask for more

Light the fire inside
I want to ignite the light in your eyes
And I thought that you would know by now
I'm down that road once more
Collecting souls

Look deep into my eyes
And maybe you'll see the lies
Walk down with me again
We'll pretend that is not a game
And when I'm the one who's down
You're allowed to laugh out loud
But I'll keep on dancing this song
With my collection of souls
