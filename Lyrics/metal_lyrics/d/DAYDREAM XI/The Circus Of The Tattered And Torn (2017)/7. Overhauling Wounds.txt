I once saw the world
With eyes painted red
And a spirit black
Sheltered from the light

I'd face the unknown
With fear in my eyes
And the weight of the world on my back
Drowning in lies

I wait to see
A wound that bleeds
Eternally
Forever breaking
The one that's weak
Naive and sick
Who feels so bleak
To change and to never reverse

As I cut myself breaking every bone
I am waiting, I'm just waiting to be gone
As I break myself and die to be reborn
I am molded by my aching
Overhauling wounds

I have felt before
With eyes burning soar
And a pair of hands that shake
Trembling in the light

I'm shattered and torn
With scars to remind
Of the one I tried to be
Tattered from the lies

I wait to see
A wound that bleeds
Incessantly
Forever killing
The one that's fake
Who'll cry and break
At all mistakes
He's done and could never accept

As I cut myself breaking every bone
I am waiting, I'm just waiting to be gone
As I break myself and die to be reborn
I am crawling without hope
As I cut myself down to the bone
I am waiting, I'm just waiting to see blood
As I break myself and rise once more
I am molded by my aching
Overhauling wounds

I used to see the world
With eyes that could not face the unknown
Like never I've been before
I'm tattered and torn

As I cut myself breaking every bone
I am waiting, I'm just waiting to be gone
As I break myself and die to be reborn
I am crawling without hope

And I keep bleeding just to keep feeling
And hear myself screaming but never healing
And I keep cutting just to feel burning
And never returning
To what I was running from

And I keep screaming just to be living
But never hearing and never believing
And I keep waiting just to be facing
The lies that I'm making
The ones I'm running from

As I see myself in a mirror of regret
I am trying, I am dying to forget
As I rebuild myself to be better than before
I am shaped by each and every one
Of my overhauling wounds
