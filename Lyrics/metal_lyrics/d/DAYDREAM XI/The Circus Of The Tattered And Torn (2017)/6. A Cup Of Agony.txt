(Flesh)
Allowing awareness
Of something right
Or something wrong

(Pain)
A warning of what not to do
Making you feel
All the damage done

(Mind)
Allowing regret
Of what you've done right
Or you've done wrong

(Pain)
Shaping reality
Making you see
Where you have to go

On the verge of breaking
Slowly sipping in
The bleary cup of agony
Drowning
And imagining adrenaline
But only hoping to awake

Endlessly nurturing the pain to ignore
The needless attention we're longing for

(Flesh)
Increasing the pulse
Pumping through your veins
Feeling strong

(Pain)
Allowing awakening
Making you scream
For what you have done

(Mind)
Revisit the past
Showing what is right
And what is wrong

(Pain)
Shifting conformity
Making you feel
You are not so strong

(Slowly sipping in)

And somehow we get used to that catapult of sentiment
Addicted to an imaginary adrenaline, to the closeness to danger
Caressing tragedy, just for a little taste.
Here, have a sip
It will help you to nurture the pain
Drink from the cup of agony
Just a sip

Endlessly nurturing the pain to ignore
The needless attention we're longing for
Endlessly trying in vain to restore
The needs of a heart that beats no more

(Slowly sipping in)

Endlessly nurturing the pain to ignore
The needless attention we're longing for
Endlessly trying in vain to restore
The needs of a heart that beats no more

Crying in vain
On the endless fields of suffering we ride
To get a taste of tragedy
And we are longing for awakening
Addicted to pain
From a catapult of sentiment we fly
And we drink

[3x]
Endlessly nurturing the pain to ignore
The needless attention we're longing for
Endlessly trying in vain to restore
The needs of a heart that beats no more
