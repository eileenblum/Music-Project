The dressing room
Packed with freaks and outcasts
Preparing to enter
And deceive, at their best
And in the mirror I see
Just make up and confusion
Before the spectacle begins

Come, take a seat and enjoy
We're about to begin
All the tickets are sold
But don't ever fear what you'll find
After all, just like you
We are tattered and torn

And in this twisted play
Forever bound to fail
I am the sadness disguised
Behind a painted smile

The seats are packed
Filled with ignorants and fools
Paying to watch
Just illusion and untruth
And in their eyes I can see
All hopes and dreams reflected
For this throat to swallow in

Come, take a seat and enjoy
We're about to begin
All the tickets are sold
But don't ever fear what you'll find
After all, just like you
We are tattered and torn

And when the lights fade
With no goodbyes said
And the curtains are closed
I stand in silence
Refrain from crying
For all the smiles that feel so wrong

And in this twisted play
Forever bound to fail
I am the sadness disguised
Behind a painted smile

[Solo: Masseti]
[Solo: Pereira]

And in this twisted play
Forever bound to fail
I am the sadness disguised
Behind a painted smile

They go on and on trying hard to feel
In every act a wound that heals
Like a dog chasing its tail
They keep running round and round
And we are all clowns
And I keep on acting trying not to feel
In every task a wound that bleeds
Dressed in color and in smiles
I keep running round and round
But I'm just a clown
