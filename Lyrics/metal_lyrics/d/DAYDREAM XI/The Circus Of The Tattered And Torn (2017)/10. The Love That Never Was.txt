Breaking in the clutch of rusty claws
Nurturing the ache of my own flaws
Back into a cage of rotten bars
Torn by every wound and every scar

Once again I'm judged for being lost
Astray from what you claim to be the norm
Even though you're one of the outcasts
You never hesitate on giving back

You say that you are keen to understand
But cannot reach beyond your own two hands
We never had a thing to be afraid
And yet you are so scared by things unsaid

We never had the chance to go to bed
But I can only wonder if we had
You say that we can go on with the talk
But keep all of your bullshit to your gods

Breaking in the clutch of rusty claws
Nurturing the ache of my own flaws
Back into a cage of rotten bars
Torn by every wound and every scar
Drowning in a pool of my own blood
Jaded by the love that never was
