[Music: Masseti, lyrics: Masseti]

For such a long time 
We have sat here in the dark 
Quiet observers of your mind falling apart 
We've faced so many days
When you were wasted
Trading power for lust
Hoping you'd become
Someone that we could trust

You have found
A sad excuse to free you from sadness
You have told
The same old lies again

You deny
The truth that's pumping 
Right in front of your eyes 
And don't even have the guts to assume
The choices you have to make

[Chorus]
Here we stand
Healing the wounds now the war is over
Stitching the shreds of our hearts again
Here we stand
Trying to find a reason to follow on 
A meaning for our lives
Keeping the dream alive

Forever we will be 
Thinking of all the places we could have seen
And all the battles that together we could win
Our fate was strong, it was great
I may forget but I'll never forgive, no
The way you failed on us 
When we needed you the most

You may cry
Until your soul is weary and black as the night 
But we'll keep riding on to reclaim 
The victory on every fight

[Chorus]

We must keep the dream alive
The daydream alive

[Solo: Pereira]

[Chorus]
