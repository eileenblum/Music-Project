[Music: CÃ¡ssio de Assis, lyrics: Masseti]

A shadow's been lurking
Deep within the labyrinth of my mind
A whisper of death and decay
Growing in silence
It won't go away 

A spark of insanity 
Glowing in the deep 
Beckoning me
And though I try to run from it
I know I will end up giving in

[Bridge]
(it was) Just when I saw
Life fading from dying eyes
That I felt whole and strong
In my miserable life

[Chorus 1]
Killing was the only way
For me to thrive 
(And rule like darkness)
And rule like darkness rules the night

I feel so much more alive than I've been before
Now that murder taints my heart
And life seems to have a reason
Now that my story is written in blood

I am the twisted face of hate
Invading your nightmares
The cold incarnation of your deepest fears
A scourge of madness

[Chorus 2]
Killing was the only way
For me to thrive 
(And rule like darkness)
Slaying is the only way  
To ease my mind
(And rule like darkness)
And rule like darkness rules the night

[Bridge]
Isn't it strange?
When at every minute of every day 
You just sit there, hoping to belong, longing to feel alright
Waiting for that especial moment, that milestone
That will turn your existence upside down 
And you will become 
Everything you've ever wanted to beâ¦

[Solo: Masseti]

[Chorus 2]
