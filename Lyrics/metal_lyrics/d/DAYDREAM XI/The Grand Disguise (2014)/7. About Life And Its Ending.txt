[Music: CÃ¡ssio de Assis, Tiago Masseti, Marcelo Pereira, lyrics: MaurÃ­cio Goldstein]

I have seen all of your fears
And I wrote them in my mind
I'm calculating the answers
Abstracting the concept of being alive

What's the meaning of a lifetime
To someone who foresaw the future
And patiently awaits for something
That the whole human kind is afraid of?

The knowledge of the centuries
And the understanding of the universe
Are locked far away inside myself
Hiding inside my deepest shell

[Solo: Masseti/Pereira/Masseti/Pereira]

Every time I get a little closer
It struggles to come out
And when it finally happens
A new existence will rise as old lies fall

It was about life
When I took my first step into infinity
And now it doesn't matter what I'm pretending
All my thoughts are about life and its ending
