[Music: Masseti, Pereira, lyrics: Masseti]

Crumbling skies
We are the last men alive
Crawling on the edge
About to face our own demise

United we stand
We have blood in our hands
Staring into the eyes of death
Just waiting for the end

[Bridge]
(But) we don't know
What's out there for us
So we will not give up
We'll fight

Lightning strikes
Igniting the skies
We struggle to stay awake
And live throughout the night

See the smoking clouds
Hear them crying out loud
As our world is burning
And there is no way out

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Beneath the wings of destruction
We must find a way to create a better life
And in our souls of corruption
We must find the power to cry our last goodbyes

[Solo: Pereira]

We have found a reason
To keep holding on for one more day
All we know is crumbling to the ground
But I have faith
Someday we will collect our fears
And throw'em all away

[Solo: Gonzaga]

(We won't give up
We'll keep fighting 'till the end of times
The skies are on fire
The world is crumbling before our eyes
But we're alive)

[Chorus 2x]
