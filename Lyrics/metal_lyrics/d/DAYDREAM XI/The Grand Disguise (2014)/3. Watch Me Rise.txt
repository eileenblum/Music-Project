[Music: Tiago Masseti, Marcelo Pereira, lyrics: Tiago Masseti]

Dance in darkness
Swing to your master, your guide
Claiming to be all I need
You're nothing but mischief and lies 

Scream in madness
Cry to your devil, your pride
Saying I need to believe
Now you are next in line

[Bridge]
Within the dark
I'll reap off your life
There's no way out
Just let me take you down

[Chorus]
The bringer of doom
Now I will have your soul
Forever I rule
On top I stand alone
My deepest desire's 
The fear inside you eyes
Get down on your knees
As you watch me rise

Crawl like a beast
Taste the venom of lust
Slowly infecting your veins
When I am earning your trust

Feel the temptation
To join me in my dance of death
And feel your life drain away 
When facing the final test

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Solo: Masseti]
[Solo: Pereira]

[Chorus]
