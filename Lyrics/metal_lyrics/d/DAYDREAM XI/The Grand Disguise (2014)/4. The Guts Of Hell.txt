[Music: Tiago Masseti, Marcelo Pereira, lyrics: Tiago Masseti]

Bleeding eyes boiling in corrosion
A bitter taste of ashes in my mouth
Acid clay clutching on my limbs
As a million blades of fire seem to crawl inside my skin
Need to break out

[Chorus]
Through the blazing walls
I seal my fate
For too long I've been tortured
Now at last I run away
For a long time trapped in shadows and oblivion
My damned soul finally can break free
From the guts of hell

Souls crying
Daylight dying
Death howls in endless fields of desolation
Life dying
Beauty crying
Tormented souls in eternal desecration

[Chorus]

[Solo: Pereira]

"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death" (Revelation 21:8)

(Souls crying, daylight dying)
I'm aware I can't be afraid
I have to fight to stop this agonizing wait
(Life dying, beauty crying)
What shall I do to find my own salvation?
What will I endure to reach my vindication?

[Chorus]
