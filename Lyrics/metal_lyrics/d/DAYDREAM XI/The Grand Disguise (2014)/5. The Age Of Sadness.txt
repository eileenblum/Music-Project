[Music: Tiago Masseti, lyrics: Tiago Masseti]

[Chorus]
Lights will guide your way
When all the colors fade to grey
And there's no one else to blame
In the age of sadness
Deep within your soul
When nothing seem to fill the hole
You will find the strength
To fly away from darkness

Breathe
Allow your senses to fly
And grieve
As our essence slowly dies

I know
We've lost our way
Killing each other
Draining the waters
With no salvation we live
But someday

[Chorus]

Oh no!
We're losing control
We're stripped of the life we used to know
We're trapped in cages of delusion
Forever lost with no solution

But I know
We'll find a way
Helping each other
Restoring the order
At the end of the tunnel I see

[Chorus]

[Solo: Pereira]

Deep within your soul
When nothing fills the hole
You will find the strength
To fly away from darkness
