[Music: Tiago Masseti, Marcelo Pereira, lyrics: Tiago Masseti]

Now the glory days are gone
The claws of fear are dragging us
Into an abyss of pain
Our pride and joy forever thrown away

Hard to forget who we were
For our story lives on
In the tales of those who dreamed
Of someday being like us

(We went too far)
The chains of pleasure have bound our hearts
(Became too great)
Loss have tore our worlds apart

[Chorus]
Like a phoenix she will rise again
Like a star upon your face
Shining over the sadness
Lightning upon the ashes of our disgrace
She will rise, over the sky
Like the burning fire of agony within

Now I see what they meant
A message of hope
(This is what they sent)
Find the key to the chains
And free your hollow hearts again
(You'll be free again)

She is not a person
A riddle of elder men
(Wisdom, courage and cure)
Wisdom, courage and cure
The firebird is those who are pure

(To heal the wounds)
The star in the prophecy is innocence
(The key to all locks)
The very meaning of existence

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Solo: Masseti/Pereira]

Now I realize we are all doomed
