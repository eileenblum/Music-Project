[Music: CÃ¡ssio de Assis, lyrics: Tiago Masseti]

The first of its kind
In secrecy has been designed
Carefully built to destroy
Without trace, with no sign

Thousands of lines of code
A new form of power unfolds
Cruelly lurking inside
Infecting, will grow

(There's gonna be a day that you will know
There is a weapon entirely made of code)
It's gonna rule the lives of men

[Chorus]
Life will never be the same
(It's the threat of our time)
The danger unseen
The most clever scheme
Lies dormant within
Our securities are failing
(As we face the other side)
We can't blame no one
For what they have done
So sad they found the gaps
The zero days

How did they make us so blind
Fomenting a new form of crime
One that could never be caught
Supported by lies

Millions of lives in their hands
So weak to this evil they send
Open to be redesigned
Making warfare a trend

[Chorus]

Hear my call
We want you all
Knights of the digital nation

Forgotten souls
The system will blow
Show us the road to salvation

[Chorus]

[Solo: Pereira]

[Chorus]
