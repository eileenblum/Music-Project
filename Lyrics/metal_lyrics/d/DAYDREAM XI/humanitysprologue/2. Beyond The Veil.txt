[Music: Assis, Goldstein, Gonzaga, Masseti and Pereira, lyrics: Masseti]

We all wear masks to cover our desires
Curtains of falsity, tool of all the liars
Brick by brick you build a wall
Keeping us apart, avoiding us all
Sailing towards a river of illusions
Looking for returning, leading to a conclusion

Can't you see it's consuming you?
Be honest, unfold what is true
Between you and me, I see

Beyond the veil that covers your semblant
I see the message emerging from your eyes
Your true intentions, your sins and your lies

You try to keep your thoughts away from me
But without me you cannot be free
Lies will lead you to nothing
But being by everyone forgotten
Disable the false person inside you
Follo me and behold the power of truth

We all wear masks to cover our desires
Curtains of falsity, tool of all the liars
Brick by brick you build a wall
Keeping us apart, avoiding us all
Sailing towards a river of illusions
Looking for returning, leading to a conclusion

Can't you see it's consuming you?
Be honest, unfold what is true
Between you and me, I see

[Solo: Gonzaga]
[Solo: Assis]

Beyond the veil that covers your semblant
I see destiny emerging from your eyes
Your cruel intentions, your doom, your demise
