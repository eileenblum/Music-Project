[Music: Assis, Goldstein, Masseti and Pereira, Lyrics: Masseti]

You know those things you wish you've never done?
Regret the way it's happened and don't like what you've become?
What if I say we could all make a change?
Bo back through the years, would it be so strange?

[Solo: Assis]

(The agony inside)
Can just be replaced with pride
(Caution and care you will need)
Good intentions can easily turn into greed

Blank files and pages of shame you wrote
Rewind the great song, recompose it note by note

Come back in time
Erase all the lines
Don't be scared, don't fight the temptations inside
Travel through time and rewrite the book of your life

[Solo: Pereira]

The sand keeps on falling, grain after grain
Watch out or your efforts in this journey may all be in vain
Never underestimate tha sandglass of fate
It will deceive you with power and in the void forever you will wait

Growing inside the desire to undo all your flaws
Wouldn't be better if you stayed and your problems solved?
Anything you erase can effect all the things in this time of your life

Come back in time
Erase all the lines
Don't be scared, don't fight the temptations inside
Travel through time and rewrite the book of your life

[Solo: Gonzaga]
[Solo: Assis]

Regret it but accept what you've done
Don't be a fool, deny this freedy temptation

Come back in time
Erase all the lines
Don't be scared, don't fight the temptations inside
Travel through time and rewrite the book of your life
