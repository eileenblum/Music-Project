[Intro: A Life of Dreams]

[Solo: Assis]

I gently close my eyes
And let the moon shine upon my face
I leave a cage of visions and lies
To share my energy with nature's grace

Far beyond our comprehension
Every kind of life's the same
Constant thoughts interacting
Forming a shapeless chain

Confused by light reflection
The eyes still hide the truth
Considering bones and mirrors
I'm standing so far from you

[Solo: Assis]

I'm looking up to a million stars
To rest my mind in a life of dreams
As you lay your body in a endless night
You can feel me flying across your skin

Close to a calm dark sky
I see distant Earth so small
The past gets so far away
And I start to wonder how

We may not share the same memories
But we wonder why life's so hard
We may have reasons to be apart
But we're fighting to keep open hearts

[Solo: Pereira/Assis]

I'm looking up to a million stars
To rest my mind in a life of dreams
As you lay your body in a endless night
You can feel me flying across your skin

I'm looking up to a million stars
To rest my mind in a life of dreams
As you lay your body in a endless night
You can feel me flying across your skin

[Solo: Assis]

All this time I've spent
Thinking about our lives
Imagination may be an universe
For those with open minds
