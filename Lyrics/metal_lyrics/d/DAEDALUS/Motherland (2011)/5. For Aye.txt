Day by day on our own
Why can't we stay together?
They say life is short
Believe it now or never

It seems so wrong and it feels so right, time goes by so slowly
Maybe it's a war or only a fight, I just can't tell
I've never felt as cold as today, I've got to find that meaning I'm searching for so long

The more you get the more you seem to wish for
I can't go on I know
Love's my only chance to keep me in control
And all I'm longing for is giving you myself
I'll choose a different way to make it through the edge
You threw my feelings back alive

You'll feel the world with my own feelings
I'll be your shelter from the storm
If there's something I believe in is you
I'll carry all that I've been dreaming
We'll built a castle on the sand
Don't be late, don't be scared
I have fallen deep in love with faith for aye

The more you get the more you seem to wish for
I can't go on I know

You'll feel the world with my own feelings
I'll be your shelter from the storm
If there's something I believe in is you
I'll carry all that I've been dreaming
We'll built a castle on the sand
Don't be late, don't be scared
I have fallen deep in love with faith for aye
