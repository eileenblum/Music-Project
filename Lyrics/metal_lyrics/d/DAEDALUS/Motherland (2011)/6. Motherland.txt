Mother can you feel me?
I'm calling out your name
I just can't stop the bleeding of my head
memories are taking my mind back to the day
I only meant to serve and to protect
I was full of pride as I had the chance to hold my gun and feel alive

Then the dust arose and got me in

Captain can you hear me?
It's deadly hot down here
my men are almost turning into sand
uniforms are melting with misery and pain
my life just keeps on falling from my hands
I turn my eyes in anger just to seek out anyone
who could explain the reason of this mess

Gainful sacrifice as you command

Take me back to motherland
my children wait for my cares
I cannot stand wasting my whole life this way without them

I try to run, I try to speak, but fear is all that I breathe
Is this the perfect behaviour taught in your instructions?

Simply humans pushed against their edge
All is misplaced, shield me in your lap and let me know

Take me back to motherland
my children wait for my cares
I cannot stand breaking down my life this way for God?s sake
Dreams and faith fade away again
I face the facts

What you do in one day can change your life
All life could not be worth that day
