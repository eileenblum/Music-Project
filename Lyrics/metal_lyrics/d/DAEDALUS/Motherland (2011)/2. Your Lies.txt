If there's a reason
to look at you for another day
If there's a meaning
in what you emit when you speak
I don't wanna care about
now stop crying, don't fall again on your knees
You failed believing
I could not think with my brain
so shut your mouth!

While I lose my faith in everything
you stand in front of me
to show how far a man
can spread his lies

Now take your seat please

I'll shut you down!

You still mirror of the darkest age
it's time for me to show
how powerless you are
without your slave
