Oppressive and overcrowded
no way out
you're trapped inside the maze
loudspeakers in every corner
no licence
to heave a sigh

Climbing high
sinking into the ground
creeping like a rat

Your place is ready, you're welcome
join this cheerful cattle car

Rushing down
pushing anyone
I wonder what you're missing

Through smell of rust and backwater
like rotting meat in a dump

If your eyes are lifeless
while you lean against the wall
at the end of the tunnel
will you find your redemption?

Talk in a loud voice about nonsense
find your heroes in a free newspaper
wasting your poor life performing
stupid rituals without understanding why

Don't get up late in the morning
this is your doom twice a day

If your eyes are lifeless
while you lean against the wall
you may think it's your duty
and you'll win your prize but
at the end of the tunnel
there's just another station
