Dismayed
my face is turning pale outright
lies
is going to be your last nonsense
just
in your sleep
I really possess your dreams and mind
I'll grab your deepest thoughts
crashing your head

All the time I've spent on your fads
if I could achieve a smile
just a simple sign of care

Sometimes
I feel that maybe I'm wrong
I bring forward my mind backwards in time
when a gesture full of passion suddenly created my world
around you

Your movie is over
you don't need to tell me:
"Jump through the fire!"

All the time I've spent on your fads
if you only gave me cares
you wouldn't be sad

Now is time for my cold revenge
'cos by now you're sand
