[music: F. Gremo, A. Rinaldi; lyrics: A. Brunetti]

Day after day we're searching
for our own way,
learning step by step
from mistakes and illusions.
New horizons give us
the strength to set up
reveries we believe
from the deep of the soul

Obscured clouds fall
on our poor lives,
making all like
a carnival masquerade.
Nothing remains
of your dreams and targets,
only find the power
to start over again.

No one but you can control
Your will to go on
The choices you make in this life
are the only real thing you have,
thing that you have in your life.

Obscured clouds fall
on our poor lives,
making all like
a carnival masquerade.
Nothing remains
of your dreams and targets
only find the power
to start over again.
Fight for your desires!

No one but you can control
Your will to go on
The choices you make in this life are
The only real thing that you have.

Use all your energy
Become what you want.
Destroy all your fears, your uncertainty.
This world is waiting for you.
