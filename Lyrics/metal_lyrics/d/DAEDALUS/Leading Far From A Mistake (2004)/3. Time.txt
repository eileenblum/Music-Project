[music: F. Gremo, A. Rinaldi; lyrics: F. Gremo]

Morning,
the sun has rubbed his eyes
in the air.
Rushing,
to search for a mail from my love.
Days passed waiting
for answers to come;
now I stand with this piece
of my heart in my hands.

All this time,
all the dreams I have,
all my life with you.

"What is changing in my mind?
I feel empty,
my thoughts are not the same;
forgive me, I belong to a new one;
Try to find a new way,
forget my name".

Sudden shivers,
realize that these words have
stolen the sweetest tears
from your eyes.
Sorrow, wasting your life
with someone.
Never let this rain mark
your fair innocence!

All this time,
all the dreams you have,
all your life renewed.
