[music: F. Gremo, A. Rinaldi; lyrics: F. Gremo]

"Progress is based
on development,
knowledge will show
the right decisions to take.
Cleansing is compulsory,
the aim is simple to justify".

Serving the cause I believe in race,
helping to grow a nation
safe and relieved;
numbers in the path of names,
I'm pleased and proud
of my mission and fate.

Towards insanity he's fading away
inside himself,
his visions break into pieces
all the sense of life.

Your faith may fall
don't waste the answers
you have in your mind.
The right choices seem so close
but don't think
it's all so easy for you.

Why are you consuming the blood
of your brothers?
They're innocent and dear.
Please stop this outrageous crime!
Who are you fools?
Just leave me rest now!
Listen to the sighs of the souls.
I'm acting right,
I heard the master!

Were they right, were they right?
I am confused now,
it seems so clear, am I so blind?
Too many numbers, not a face,
I heard the voices, what shall I do?

Towards a self regret he's climbing
to gain a way to exist
now his mind has changed
trying to recreate the sense of life.

Your faith may fall
don't waste the answers
you have in your mind.
The right choices seem so close
but don't think
it's all so easy for you!
Your conscience calls
don't miss the right sense
you feel deep inside.
The right choices lie so close now,
believe it's all within your reality.
