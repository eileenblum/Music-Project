Torture cause, bleeding force, any way.
A damned signifying curse.
Maggots pass, flesh upholds, bleeding wounds.
Impalement starts this scary age.

This is my addiction, a waste of crushing process.
Impalement causes blasphemy to march with the dead.

Dignifying causes blood for slavery
Upholds the open skies
Dying of humanity end emptiness
To crush your limbs

Purchase desolation
Compulsory
On inverted crosses recognize eternal suffer

Purchase desolation
Compulsory
On inverted crosses recognize eternal suffer

I still be manic, grown in the further greed of surgery
Great kill for worship, entrails scoll upon the neck of enemy

Pestilence ones appear, faithful hate.
Aggressions, according measures.
Taste of flesh, bloody walls, quenched life
Contradict and world demise

I'll take your suffer, cold flesh upon your face
Dead and murder, dying, entrails raped
Cold suffocation bleeds over me

Torture cause, bleeding force, any way.

Maggots pass, flesh upholds, bleeding wounds

Murder, Butchery...
According to rot....to rot......
