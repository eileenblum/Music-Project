Hands up sacrifice for coming death
You are caught in circle of everlasting pain
Death creeps slower as you want to do
You are dead and lie to me

Now, you kill and I cut your throat
You bleed with fear and everlasting pain
Death creeps slower as you want to do
You are dead and lie to me
Eternal suffocation of me

Blood runs out of you
Dead you are by me
Visions of crust and gore
Killing! I want more
Impending suffer will conquer
Blood my sacrifice
Impending suffer kill other
Feel my lovely knife

Infernal splash
The creeping death

Blood, screams and tears
The unholy resurrection
Penetrates through my veins
I shall be killed

Death I've lived
Corpses killed
Eating flesh
Dying

So, I cut your wounds deep
Looking for some meat
Don't finding; your body now cooks with infernal heat.
Total masturbation
Eternal suffocation
Putrid stench, eyes in cans,
cunts on strings, bloody hands,
torn out nails, ripped entrails,
flesh is torn, dead was born

Death, I've lived
Corpses, I killed
Killed! Now, you are dead
Died by sacrifice

Putrid stench, eyes in cans,
cunts on strings, bloody hands,
torn out nails, ripped entrails,
flesh is torn, dead was born

You are dead
