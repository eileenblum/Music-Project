We always bring you "suffer" and "brutality"
We take revenge of hatred
Condemned for penetration
And killing that measures
Perforate knife
Embarrassed killing
And go on, more hate
Bare hate exists

I still cum blood
For the victim of my own
I love ripping your skin
I am digging you down
You're the person of the dead
Screaming bodies so long

Crushing heads collective measures
There is no reason
Blood red burn and suffocation
Mutilation
Depths of filth, a vacant murder
For my survival
Burning skies for defecation
Exhumation

Flesh for only waste
Head is spite on fire
Carcass putrid stench
Carnivores desire

Condemned for hate
Condemned for fire
Condemned eternal
Condemned desire

condemned

The rules of the dead
Are your only importants
Any kind of flesh
For the appetite of mass
Collective ripping
With bloody teeth
To break the incantation of my damnation
Your head is spite on fire to kill splashed

Pure hate, suffocate
Hell awaits, condemned
