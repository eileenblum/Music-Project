Stormy fire, no chance to run away
No regrets for sucking weakness

This is the creature of demolition and war
You've got the power and richness
Mutual mortifying

Suffer is their goal
Endless power, soulless streaming
Burning eyes, the old
Fist of sorrow, angel feeding

Burning eyes, are bleed on my
No responsibility

After all excremental life
No being is the best
Suffer dying; suffer pain
Go up and try to rest.

Creatures with much blasphemy
No one is geranial
Fire; ice my destiny
Blasphemy is my yearn

Mutual mortifying my soul is going on
Mutual mortifying the beast the soulless ghost

Torture bastards' feelings, not for damned pestilence
Torture bastards' feelings, not for damned pestilence

This is the creature of demolition and war
You've got the power and richness
Mutual mortifying
