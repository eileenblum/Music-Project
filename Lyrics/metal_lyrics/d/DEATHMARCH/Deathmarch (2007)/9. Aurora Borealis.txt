Above this land from times untold
gazing down since days of old
on darkest nights the sky's aglow
reflecting dimly upon the snow
The gaze of all forgotten heroes
Reflected in this azure light
Graces now, my journey
As I sail into the night

Remember this, our endless song
Our dream of journey living on
From our course we'll never stray
The northern lights will guide our way
Carved in stone our names survive
Through our blood we stay alive
Though in this world we shall not stay
The northern lights will guide our way

Above this land from times untold
gazing down since days of old
on darkest nights the sky's aglow
reflecting dimly upon the snow
The gaze of all forgotten heroes
Reflected in this azure light
Graces now, my journey
As I sail into the night

Upon my side my sword is sheathed
And on my back my shield
The blackened waves my ship's upon
my true purpose thus revealed
The northern lights above me shine
The colours cascade down
Reflecting on my armour
As I sail away from town

Aurora Borealis, the heaven's are ablaze
As I stare towards the night sky
Its radiance meets my gaze
Aurora Borealis, the earth below it lights
As I look upon the ocean
On these never ending nights
Aurora Borealis, watch over me tonight
Though I sail into an unknown land
My soul will not know fright
Aurora Borealis, lead me on my way
Though my family wishes me at home
I know I cannot stay

Above this land from times untold
gazing down since days of old
on darkest nights the sky's aglow
reflecting dimly upon the snow
The gaze of all forgotten heroes
Reflected in this azure light
Graces now, my journey
As I sail into the night

Remember this, our endless song
Our dream of journey living on
From our course we'll never stray
The northern lights will guide our way
Carved in stone our names survive
Through our blood we stay alive
Though in this world we shall not stay
The northern lights will guide our way
