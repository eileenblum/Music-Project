Boundless forests dying skies above this empty world I fly

Through endless peaks and frozen skies
Above this empty world I fly.
Over snow topped forests gleaming white
As the sun gives off its dying light.

Upon my steed of rotten scales
I bear my rusted plate of mail.
And through my visor frozen tight
My eyes emit infernal light.

For I am the wanderer, legend untold.
Cursed to wander since the days of old.
Though the age of the living has gone and passed
My soul condemned shall ever last

Where seas did churn once all is still
Where the sun did heat once all is chilled
The lands are frozen with my hate
Emotions dark that can't abate

My brethren rumbles as it draws its breath
So much alike the time of its death.
His maw doth gape in eternal hate
for with me does he bear my fate.

For I am the wanderer, legend untold.
Cursed to wander since the days of old.
Though the age of the living has gone and passed
My soul condemned shall ever last

He spreads his wings, we fly away
And so ends another torturous day.
And though the day is but a blight
I find no solace in the darkness of night.

For time has passed and will again
and ever will until the end.
And so until this world doth die
Above this empty world I fly.
