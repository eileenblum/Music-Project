Written in blood
(Let it be)
Written in blood

On the darkest of nights
In a chamber of stone
Gather's round a black altar
Laiden with bone
A group of men robed
Watch with bright eyes
as a beautiful woman
let's out her last cries

As the woman in bondage
is shackled to stone
the men's faces gleam
and she lets out a groan
And from the shadows
A figure steps forth
Bearing a dagger
And a life ends henceforth

Written in blood
infernal vocations
an unholy display
of profane incantations
let it be written in blood!

Blood smeared on the altar
is left to conjeal
and the men draped in darkness
go down and kneel
another gift given
and more to come soon
The men ready for hunting
Neath the red moon

Torches die down
And all fades from light
and the men once again
embrace the night
They step through the darkness
Over grass and through mud
Their fates shall they follow
as it's written in blood

Let no man feel safety
For all can be found
Torn from their sanctum
To altar then bound
Remember these words
and remember them well
Treasure your daylight
for at night you're in hell

When the night sky is barren
save for a red moon
no man is immortal
That shall be known soon
So close all your windows
and lock all your doors
Though that shall not save you
from the nights horrors
