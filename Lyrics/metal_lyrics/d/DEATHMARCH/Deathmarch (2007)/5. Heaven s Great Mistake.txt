No longer shall angels stroke their harps with gentle hands
for the plague of Christian kind shall soon be banished from our lands
the heathen's shall unite, and the Christians soon shall fall
for they shall see the power of lord Satan straight and tall
once we were just exiles, banished from heaven's gates
but now we're coming back and we are fulfilling all our fates

For heaven's walls are falling down, the angels cry with pain
as our spears impale their winged bodies and they're puny god is slain
For haven's walls will soon crash down and we will see them break
for we have been the cause of this, heaven's great mistake

our armies amassed we begin the march to heaven's realm
fully armed and fully aware with armour from our feet to helm
through bog and bay, fjord and fall we marched it all the way
until we came upon that realm, in the light of day
and so we waited impatiently for the darkness to fall
and then we gave out wretched cries and charged to kill them all

For heaven's walls are falling down, the angels cry with pain
as our spears impale their winged bodies and they're puny god is slain
For haven's walls will soon crash down and we will see them break
for we have been the cause of this, heaven's great mistake

And with fiendish malevolence we stormed their battlements
cutting down spirit and seraphim alike
Without mercy, we set their temples aflame and cut down those
who fled. None were spared.

All around us rubble lies, the remains of heaven and its filthy lies
burning bodies, decaying flesh, and omipresent dying cries
running down our blades like tears the angels blood doth flow
anger filled but blood lust gone, our eyes with evil glow
exiled once, but now we are back, to claim our rightful space
to sit upon our thrones of bone in gods once beautiful place.
