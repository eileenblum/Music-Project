Darkness is falling and spirits arise
Hatred and evil now blacken the skies.
With every word chanted a new star will fall
And eternal darkness shall soon cover all

Time corrupts as one shall see
Through bleak and hateful misery
Enslaved for deeds to man unknown
Deprived of godly rightful throne
Where once was love it now bears spite
Where once it healed it now spreads blight
Forced to sleep against its will
Left in chains, that is until...

In robes of darkest crimson
And with purpose set in stone
Chant a group of men determined
to bring back what is unknown
Reciting words forbidden
and foregoing all restrain
In a circle charged with power
to restore an ancient reign

And so we shout his name for all the world to hear!
And so we let the heavens tremble in fear!

Nehebu-Kau...The great beast now awakes
Nehebu-Kau...Behold the lord of snakes
Nehebu-Kau...Hope has long since gone
Nehebu-Kau...For he has killed the dawn

Darkness is falling and spirits arise
Hatred and evil now blacken the skies.
With every word chanted a new star will fall
And eternal darkness shall soon cover all

And so we shout his name for all the world to hear!
And so we let the heavens tremble in fear!

Nehebu-Kau...The great beast now awakes
Nehebu-Kau...Behold the lord of snakes
Nehebu-Kau...Hope has long since gone
Nehebu-Kau...For he has killed the dawn

In caverns lost now to the world
a long gone evil wakes
under the sands of a forgotten land
sirring from a cold embrace
ragged breaths grow steady now
and closed eyes open anew
chains of bondage disappear
its strength is now renewed

Behold the serpent headed god
as he breaks free of his tomb
rising from the burning sands
From darkened places now exhumed
And as the skies begin to darken
the world lets out a cry
for all that once was good and pure
has now laid down and died

Darkness has fallen and spirits arose
Hatred and evil have vanquished their foes.
Every word chanted has left the skies bare
And shrouded the world now is in despair

And so we shout his name for all the world to hear!
And so we let the heavens tremble in fear!

Nehebu-Kau...The great beast now awakes
Nehebu-Kau...Behold the lord of snakes
Nehebu-Kau...Hope has long since gone
Nehebu-Kau...For he has killed the dawn

Darkness has fallen and spirits arose
Hatred and evil have vanquished their foes.
Every word chanted has left the skies bare
And shrouded the world now is in despair
