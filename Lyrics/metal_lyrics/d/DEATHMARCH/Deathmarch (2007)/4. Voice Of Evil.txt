Lo and behold! The angels die!
From the heaven's above, they plummet from the skies
and so demons come forth, to claim their minds
and to take them back into hells confines
pain and torture, two words they will know
for the angels in bondage, to the void they go
this voice of evil, we let it known
for the forces of hell have only grown

And now with hatred born of millenia of slavery, we break free of our
ancient bindings and strike out at what god holds so close

Out from tartar the demons ride
on flaming steeds into the skies
from blue to black the colours dim
paving the way for eternal sin
fires spawn where once were none
the walls of hell now shadow the sun
humans hopes now writhe in flames
the dying world now cries in pain

And now with hatred born of millenia of slavery, we break free of our
ancient bindings and strike out at what god holds so close

And so...The world is coming to an end
And so...The demons rear their heads
And so...Angels blood falls to the ground
And so...Bodies lay all around

Hell on earth is manifest
This wretched world is laid to rest
Christian kind now hang their heads
For their puny god is dead
