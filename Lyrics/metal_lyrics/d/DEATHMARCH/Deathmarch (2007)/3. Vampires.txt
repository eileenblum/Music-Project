Graveyard spawn, the night I choose
The blood is the life, my humanity I lose
from shadow to shadow, under cover of dark
From graveyard to alley, for blood I embark
White fangs a gleaming, my eyes light up too
A lone woman I see, at the zenith of the moon
Helpless and lonesome, a perfect delight
for me and my bloodlust, because of my blight

we are the vampires we are undead
we're coming for you our thirst must be fed

My teeth meet her white neck, her blood it comes forth
my tongue runs along it, she's restrained by my force
she lets out a sigh and then falls to the ground
I retreat into darkness with no trace nor a sound
Her body lies lifeless, found by her kin
put into a crypt and corroded by sin
and so cometh from death, a new plague is here
to feed upon the living, to breed upon fear

we are the vampires we are undead
we're coming for you our thirst must be fed
we are the vampires we are undead
we're coming for you our thirst must be fed

They send out their parties under blackness of night
to seek out my evil with their torches alight
strength in numbers or so they presume
I attack with my minions their control I assume
we are the vampires we are undead
