From the north our armies march to take the throne from thee
to take it back with blades in hand to take it maliciously
where once we ruled we now return with anger gleaming bright
to spill their blood upon the snow, bathed in pale moonlight

Through melees long
Through seas of spears
through showers of blood
through the gore of thousands
Through melees long
Through seas of spears
through showers of blood
through the gore of thousands

Below the hill we lie in wait for our time to kill
to taste their blood upon our lips this urge we must fulfill
the time is here and out we come the legion of the night
to kiss their stomachs with our swords and shed their blood in spite

March! [repeated]

Raising our weapons we cry out with glee
and the blood in our veins fills with raw ecstasy
headfirst and headstrong our armies collide
for the glory of our people, to bring us pride
and avenge our sons who died
