Our father which art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. [Matthew 6:9-11]

Praise ye The Lord. Sing unto The Lord a new song, and His praise in the congregation of Saints. [Psalm 149:1]

And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For Thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory for ever. Amen. [Matthew 6:12-13]

Praise ye The Lord. Sing unto The Lord a new song, and His praise in the congregation of Saints. [Psalm 149:1]
