You tried everything to take me along with you [1 Peter 5:8]
You thought that you could turn me away from Yeshua
Let me tell you that you got the wrong guy
My growing hate against you is the result

And now I feel closer to Jah [Psalm 9:10]
Jesus is Lord ! [Philippians 2 :10-11]
You can in no case make me fall over
I'm not from the same choir of your army of losers
As for me, I am victorious through Jesus Christ my Saviour
Because I've chosen to stay with my Lord [Romans 8:37-39]

And as it is written, you're going to be destroyed [Romans 16:20]

Jesus is Lord ! [Philippians 2 :10-11]

You wanted my soul to be damned
But Jesus never ditch me [Psalm 121]
You thought that I'll become crazy
But instead I'm standing firm

Jesus is Lord ! [Philippians 2 :10-11]
