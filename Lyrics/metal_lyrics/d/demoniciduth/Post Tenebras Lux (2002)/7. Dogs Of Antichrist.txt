Run quick!
Youâre running into the nocturnal forest
Chasing by a horde of antichristâs dogs
You hear their stepsâ noises on the wet grass
Their breath is approaching more &amp; more from you, you slip, itâs the end!

Your heart has stopped to beat
The dogs of antichrist have crushed it

Why all these things happened to this poor man?
Iâll tell you his story, he made a pact with satan [John 8:43-44]
Death is the result of his idiocy [Job 36:10-12]

Playing with spiritism &amp; dealing with the unclean
He gave his life, his soul to the devil
He thought that with belzebuth heâll reign [Revelation 16:13-14]
But he was wrong, wrong, caught by the bowels of hell [Psalm 106:35-37]

His heart has stopped to beat
The dogs of antichrist have crushed it

Now you see the truth,
Renounce to satan &amp; his horde of blasphemers
Or youâll draw your last breath
This story can happen to you, devoured by the dogs of antichrist
Take another way, orâ¦ [Psalm 1]

Your heart will stop to beat
The dogs of antichrist will crush it

Demoniciduth is here to show you the way
The path of life, where death no longer lives
The only way to escape eternal damnation
The Holy Blood of Jesus Christ,
Now you can come to Him! [Acts 4:12]
