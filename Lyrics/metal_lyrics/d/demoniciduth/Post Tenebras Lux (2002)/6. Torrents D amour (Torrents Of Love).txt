Come Lord, come to invade us of Your great endless love
âCause itâs the call of our hearts echoing in the depths of our beings

Love crush hatred

Like torrents that You pour out, such is Your mercifulness
And Your precious Blood that protects us from the devil &amp; its spells

Love crush hatred

When weâre depressed, You come to revive us
Buried into sadness, our cries come to You
In Your justice, You take away our souls from the grief
In Your kindness, You starve our enemies to silence [Psalm 143:11-12]

Where sin abounded, Your Grace abounded over [Romans 5:20]
O Eternal, we worship the holiness of Your Name

Joy grind sadness

Weâll publish all Your songs with joyful screams
May everything that breathes praise The Eternal, Hosanna in the most high places of Heaven! [Psalm 150:6]

Joy grind sadness
