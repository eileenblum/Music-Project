[Many people in the Metal scene are listening to satanic stuff. This song tries to warn anyone about the influence of evil lyrics unto people's mind. Satanic songs aren't innocent, don't let the devil an opportunity to possess you...]

A satanic metal music fan turning on his stereo, 
listening to stupid antichrist bands singing against The Holy One 
The way to hell has began for this young and totally blinded fan 
who do not know what is hidding behind these pervert and demonic chants. 1 Timothy 3:7
Reject it, vomit it, change your ways. 
Can't you see that you are going to self destruction listening to 
bands singing for the glory of belial the black lord? 
Till when would you understand that you are giving your soul to lucifer? 
come to the one true Lord Jesus Christ. Osea 12:7
Reject it, vomit it, change your ways. 
Follow satan and you will endure eternal sufferance 
Follow Jesus and you'll hear your heart beating 
So, change your ways and receive eternal life. Revelation 20:10-15
A satanic metal music fan turning on his stereo, 
listening to stupid antichrist bands singing against The Holy One 
The way to hell has began for this young and totally blinded fan 
who do not know what is hidding behind these pervert and demonic chants. 1 Timothy 3:7
Reject it, vomit it, change your ways.
