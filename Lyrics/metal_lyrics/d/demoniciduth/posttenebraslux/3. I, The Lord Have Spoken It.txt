[Music : Taanak]
[Lyrics : Ashtaroth-KarnaÃ¯m/Taanak]
[In today's society, many are rejecting God's Word, and many are mocking His Name. He that sitteth in the Heavens shall laugh, The Lord shall have them in derision. Then, shall He speak unto them in His wrath and vex them in His sore displeasure.]

Thus shall mine anger be accomplished 
and I will cause my fury to rest upon them. 
And I will be comforted and they shall know 
that I The Lord have spoken it in my zeal, 
When I have accomplished my fury in them.
Moreover I will make thee waste 
and a reproach among the nations
that are round about thee
in the sight of all that pass by.
So it shall be a reproach and a taunt
an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations 
that are round about thee
when I shall execute judgements in thee, in anger. 

And in fury and in furious rebukes
I the Lord have spoken it. 

When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine
which shall be for their destruction 
and which I will send to destroy you. 

And I will increase the famine upon you 
and I will break your staff of bread
so, I will send upon you famine and evil beasts 
and they shall bereave thee and pestilence 
and blood shall pass through thee 
and I will bring the sword upon thee. 

I the Lord have spoken it. 
[Ezekiel 5:13-17]
