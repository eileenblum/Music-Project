[Music and lyrics: Taanak]

This is my destiny as a child of God
Saved from my insanity, washed by His Blood [1 Peter 1:18-19]

Death has no power over me [1 Corinthians 15:55]
Heaven will be my home eternally [Philippians 3:20]

This is your destiny if you trust the liar
Burn without mercy in the lake of fire [Revelation 20:11-15]

No condemnation for those in Christ [Romans 8:1]
Now is the day of salvation [2 Corinthians 6:2]

I once was lost but now I'm found [Luke 15:24]
I once was blind but now I see [John 9:25]

Christ crucified â my forgiveness [Matthew 26:28]
Christ risen â my hope revealed [1 Corinthians 15:20]

Choose now your destiny [1 John 5:12]
