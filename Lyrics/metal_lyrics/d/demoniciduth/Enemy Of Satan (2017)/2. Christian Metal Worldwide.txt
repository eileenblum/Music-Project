[Music and lyrics: Taanak]

We are the Church of the last generation
Before the coming of The Morning Star [Revelation 22:16]

The dawn will rise
Unblack forces ravaging the land
We reclaim the names Belial took away
We'll fight 'til the end for the most holy faith [Jude 20]

Every place our feet shall tread shall be ours [Joshua 1:3]
We'll shine The Light of our Lord Jesus Christ [John 1:9]
We won't be silenced [Acts 4:20]
We'll set this world ablaze

I see Satan fall like lightning from heaven
We've been given authority on serpents and scorpions
And the Enemy's forces
Nothing, nothing shall harm us [Luke 10:18-19]

Every knee shall bow before The King
Every tongue confess Christ is Lord [Philippians 2:10-11]

We are the Church of the last generation
Before the coming of The Morning Star [Revelation 22:16]
