[Music and lyrics: Taanak]

The holocaust of our generation [Leviticus 18:21]
The decline of our civilization [Jeremiah 2:13]

In deprivation we trust
Godless liberals life's conception [2 Timothy 3:1-5]
Free choice they claim
Then they wash their hands in blood [Matthew 27:24]

The holocaust of our generation [Leviticus 18:21]
The decline of our civilization [Jeremiah 2:13]

Feeding their lust [Ephesians 4:17-19]
Killing the innocent on the altar of selfishness
Shall I not punish such a nation, saith The Lord? [Jeremiah 5:9, 29; 9:9]

Because iniquity shall abound
The love of most shall grow cold [Matthew 24:12]
Who shall hear their cries,
Masked by the sound of your tambourines? [Jeremiah 7:31]

Rise up, O Judge of the earth! [Psalm 94:2]
