[Music: Taanak/Lord Ekklektus/Rime, lyrics: Taanak]

Listen! We declare war to the darkness
The sword! Is ready to cut in pieces

The battle rages [Revelation 20:7-8]
Warriors for Christ
United by Blood
Holy massacre

Demons! Destroyed by the angels of Christ
Belial! Defeated by God's only Son [Revelation 20:9]

Mutilation
Lying corpses
Total destruction
Holy massacre

Brutal carnage
Burning sulphur
Supreme punishment
Tormented forever [Revelation 20:10]

Your flesh! Burned by the devouring fire
Maggots! Feasting on your rotting bodies

Evisceration
Carnal butchery
Dismemberment
Holy massacre [Revelation 20:11-15]

Victory! Legions of Light hand in hand
Freedom! Jesus Christ has come to rule [Revelation 19:15]

Mighty One
Holy Warrior
Eternal reign with Jesus Christ [Revelation 22:5]

Lion of Judah [Revelation 5:5]
Holy Majesty
Youâre The King of kings and Lord of lords [Revelation 17:14]

Mighty One
Holy Warrior
Eternal reign with Jesus Christ [Revelation 22:5]
