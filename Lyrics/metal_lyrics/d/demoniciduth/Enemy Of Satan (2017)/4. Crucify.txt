[Music and lyrics: Taanak]

Sin â deprived of inner peace
Sin â my heart now cold as ice [Hebrews 3:13]
Sin â sorrow and bitterness [Luke 22:61-62]
Sin â digging my own grave [James 1:15]

Crucify [Galatians 5:24]

Sin â corrodes my emotions
Sin â infection sets in [Romans 5:12]
Sin â separation from God [Romans 5:10]
Sin â wretched man I am! [Romans 7:24]

Crucify [Galatians 5:24]

Heal me Lord, I am but dust [Psalm 103:14]
Help me change, in You I trust

Create in me a pure heart, O God
Renew a steadfast spirit within me
Do not cast me from Your Presence
Or take Your Holy Spirit from me [Psalm 51:12-13]

Christ â my light and my salvation
Christ â the stronghold of my life [Psalm 27:1]
Christ â my strength and my song [Exodus 15:2]
Christ â my rock and my refuge [2 Samuel 22:3]

Cleanse me
Wash me
Renew me
Save me [Psalm 51]
