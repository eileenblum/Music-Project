[Music and lyrics: Taanak]

Liar and thief thou art, Mephistopheles [John 8:44; 10:1-21]
Perversion is thine art, Prince of darkness [Ephesians 2:2; 6:12]

Thy kingdom shall not last, thy kingdom!
Never to rise again, never! [Daniel 2:39-45]

The keys of death and hades belong to The Rock of Ages [Revelation 1:18]
Thy evil power is worthless against our Saviour Jesus [Luke 10:17]

O death, where is thy sting, o death?
O grave, where is thy victory, o grave? [1 Corinthians 15:55]

When Satan approaches like a roaring lion
Seeking for a prey to devour [1 Peter 5:8]
The Christian calls on The Name of Jesus
Soon, the shadows retreat [Philippians 2:10]

Enemy of Satan
Fear not the serpent
His fate has been foretold
In the pages of old [Revelation 20:10]

Worthy is The Lamb who was slain for thee
Praise, honour, glory and power
For ever and ever! [Revelation 5:12-13]

Thou hast been in Eden, perfect in thy beauty
Banished from heaven, corruption found in thee [Ezekiel 28:12-17; Isaiah 14:11-15]

Accuser, thou shalt be silenced, accuser! [Revelation 12:10]
Deceiver, thou shalt be consumed, deceiver! [2 Thessalonians 2:8]

When Satan approaches like a roaring lion
Seeking for a prey to devour [1 Peter 5:8]
The Christian calls on The Name of Jesus
Soon, the shadows retreat [Philippians 2:10]

Enemy of Satan
Fear not the serpent
His fate has been foretold
In the pages of old [Revelation 20:10]
