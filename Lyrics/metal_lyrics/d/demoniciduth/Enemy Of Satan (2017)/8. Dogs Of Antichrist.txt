[Music and lyrics: Taanak]

Running fast into the nocturnal forest
Hunted by a horde of Antichrist's dogs
Hearing the echo of their steps on the wet grass
Feeling their breath closer to you
Too late, it's the end!

Your heart has ceased to beat
The dogs of Antichrist they crushed it

Why all these things happened to this poor man?
I'll tell you his story; he made a pact with Satan [John 8:43-44]
Death is the result for his idiocy [Job 36:10-12]

Playing with the occult and dealing with the unclean
He gave his life and soul to the devil
He thought that with Beelzebub he'll reign [Revelation 16:13-14]
But he was wrong, wrong, caught by the bowels of hell [Psalm 106:35-37]

His heart has ceased to beat
The dogs of Antichrist they crushed it

Now you see the truth
Renounce to Satan and his horde of blasphemers
Or you'll draw your last breath
This may happen to you, devoured by the dogs of Antichrist
Take another way, orâ¦ [Psalm 1]

â¦Your heart will cease to beat
The dogs of Antichrist will crush it

Come to Christ â Be set free!
[John 3:16]
