Lurking in dormancy, unseen spore of hate
Insidious infection, festering in dreams
Rising from the hidden shadows of decay
In solitude and suffering, an eon of
malignant incubation
Unborn of silent fears and self delusion
The anatomy of sorrow
Soulless incarnation of disease

Contagion of aberration
The seed was once submerged
Incessant torment
Vile contemplation
Of repulsive fantasies
Causing imminent psychosis

Horrific alteration
Wrought from within
The source of revulsion
Withering away

Once concealed, within the twisted maze of psyche
Risen into dominance, obliteration of suppression
Unborn of silent fears and self delusion
The anatomy of sorrow
Soulless incarnation of disease

From the confine of shadows
Engrossed in depravity
Unchained spawn of hate
Inner transformation
The cycle now complete
