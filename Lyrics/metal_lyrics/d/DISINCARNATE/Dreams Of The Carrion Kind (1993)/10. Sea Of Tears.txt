Inflicted upon willing flesh
Obsession's punishment
Resculpted
Into deranged abstraction

Infernal equinox
Marks the time of configuration

The nameless one
Vasa Inquitatis
His labyrinthine machinations
Of blessed order shall prevail
The heart of damnation quells
The infection of chaos

Sweet textures
Of insane pleasures
Sensations so unreal
False punishment
Glorious deception
Born on a sea of tears

Purified in pain
Given structure, raped of human form
Recreated flesh
Embodiment of crystalline perfection

Pirified in pain
Clutching at the bossom of despair
Huddled masses weep
Eternal sorrow on a sea of tears
