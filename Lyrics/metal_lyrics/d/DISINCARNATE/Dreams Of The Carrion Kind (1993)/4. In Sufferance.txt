Rituals contrived to ease the mind
Mysteries revealed, or are they lies?
The ultimate truth remains unknown until you die
Feeding the madness of uncertainty

Fearful of revenge
But sowing the violent seed
A lifetime of transgressions
Mentally tortured
Self-inflicted punishment
No judgement more severe

A twisted course bound by fate
Spiralling plunge, shrouded in fear
Is there a purpose or merely destiny?
Master or pawn of life's cruelties

Fearful of revenge
But sowing the violent seed
A lifetime of transgressions
Mentally tortured
Self-inflicted punishment
No judgement more severe

The curse of life, anticipating fate
Aware that one day death will come
Infernal shadows cast upon our earthly shells
Does life just cease or are our souls reborn?

Enigma of the absolute
Useless to repent
What is the cost of paradise
A living death of righteous lies
Shackled by a mindless faith
Lamenting in vain
Falling deep into distress
Life spent in sufferance

Shattered mind, corrupted flesh
Cowering in mortal fear
Clinging to a fading life
Futile prayer as the end draws near
Body now a withered frame
Fallen prey to time
Final thoughts are a regret
Dying without ever knowing life

In sufferance
