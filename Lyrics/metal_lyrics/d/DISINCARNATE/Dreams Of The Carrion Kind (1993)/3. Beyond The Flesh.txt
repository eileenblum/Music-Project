Paralyzed as my life slips away
I'm mortified by my disease
Terrified of my mortality
But doomed to find what lies beyond

My conscience reawakens
As I shed my mortal shell
Drifting in the memories
Of a once embodied life
Lost beyond the carnal realm
Absorbed in desolation
Trapped within this labyrinth
Of faded recollection

Deceased and yet my mind remains
Endless mental excruciation
Tormented thorough memory
No life beyond the flesh

My body rotting in the grave
Its vital essence gone
My spirit writhes in nothingness
Serenity has been denied me
Afterlife of suffering
In immortal unconsciousness
I'm agonised eternally
By absence of flesh

Deceased and yet my mind remains
Endless mental excruciation
Tormented thorough memory
Why can't I rest in peace?

Wallowing in empty pain
I'm plagued with lust to live again
Damned to spent eternity
In disembodied misery

Imprisoned in this solitary hell
Anguished by visions of life
In mourning of my tortured destiny
Tantalized forevermore
