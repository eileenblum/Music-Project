Born with inhuman abilities
Communication with the dead
Necroscopic transfer
From the afterlife
Drawn to the fields of mortality
Beckoned by the restless souls
Nethworldly knowledge
Seeps into the mind

Deathless being, from beyond
A sepulchral voice, incorporeal
Unseen presence, ancient fiend
I bequeath the night into thee

Entity of immense evil
Lying stagnant, shackled in the earth
Undead and buried for centuries
Crying out in crimson lust

Corpses call, up from their tombs
Silently, dead thoughts are exhumed
Drawing strength from rotted minds
Defying death, transcending time

Echoing from rancid depths
Ghastly voices of unrest
Cries of fear from lives passed on
Summoning the deadspawn

Warned of the evil left behind
And of perils yet to come
Excavating wisdom
Of the teeming dead
Torm from his mortal existence
Retreat into the continiuum
Disembodied spectre
Necroscope lives on

Deathless being, from beyond
A sepulchral voice, incorporeal
Unseen presence, ancient fiend
I bequeath the night into thee

Entity of immense evil
Lying stagnant, shackled in the earth
Undead and buried for centuries
Crying out in crimson lust

Echoing from rancid depths
Ghastly voices of unrest
Cries of fear from lives passed on
Summoning the deadspawn
