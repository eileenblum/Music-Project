Horrid life of cruelty strips the soul away
Evil lies revealed, it's a presence undenied
Crumbling morality infects the swarming race
Flames of the unfettered, a fate beyond redemption

Cleansing fire, all consuming
Idyllic dream, lost in chaos
Suffer

Procession into darkness, descent to degradation
Contemptuous of impurity, inferno of extinction

Drowning in a sea of fire, the rapture of cremation
Entranced by lucid visions of paradise in flames

Writhing pit of misery from which there's no escape
Doomed before inception to end in suffering
Grovelling in decadence, in fear of retribution
Blackened corpse of paradise scorched and turned to ash

Procession into darkness, descent to degradation
Contemptuous of impurity, inferno of extinction

Cleansing fire, all consuming
Idyllic dream, lost in chaos

Drowning in a sea of fire, the rapture of cremation
Only death remains and the stench of paradise burning
