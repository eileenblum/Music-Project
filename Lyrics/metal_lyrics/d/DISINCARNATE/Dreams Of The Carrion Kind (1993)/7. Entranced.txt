Ancestral home in the twilight deeps
Beckons to me with unseen fingers
Forefathers haunt
Calling to me from this dark charnel house
Corrupted through lifelong seclusion
Driven by an unnatural force
Drawn to this vault
Declivity where the light reaches not

Enigmatic crypt of my bloodline
Place of ancestral remains
Temple of my fascination
Possessing me

Reversion to past generations
A decadent state of the mind
Return to repellant scions
Of the primitive

Enchanting black recesses of the past
Welcome me to my true home

Familiar far beyond the tenancy
Of the body which I now possess
Eyes affixed upon the dank portal
Alone I lie entranced

Echoes of my forgotten lives
Summoning me to the gothic retreat
Here I belong
My casket awaits, my heritage calls
Sinister flashes of supersight
Penetrate the veils of empiricism
Sanity wanes
I witness my lineage perish in flames

Enigmatic crypt of my bloodline
Place of ancestral remains
Temple of my fascination
Possessing me

Reversion to past generations
A decadent state of the mind
Return to repellant scions
Of the primitive

Delving into the terrors
Of my inherited scorn
Undeniable heritage
Innocent nevermore

Though but twenty-one winters have
Chilled my bodily frame
Blasphemy pours in torrents from my lips

Enchanting black recesses of the past
Welcome me to my true home

Familiar far beyond the tenancy
Of the body which I now possess
Eyes affixed upon the dank portal
Alone I lie entranced
