On the nightward shores of dream
Beyond the waking plain
Gates of horn and ivory
Bid welcome to Oneiro's domain
Enter the nocturnal world
Haunt of weary minds
Revel in the fields of nightmare
Dreams of the Carrion kind

Monarch of the sleeping marches
Creature of no end
Son of Hypnos, shaper of the dreaming
Abducted and imprisoned
With escape he takes revenge
His captors face the nightmare everlasting

Visit to the realms infernal
Come to reclaim his own
Domicile of damned souls
Demonkind and the neverborn
Taking flight on nothing winds
Through uncreated wastes
Wary of the perils
Beyond damnation's gates

Called upon by destiny
Conclave of the endless now begins
Dream taunted by desire
Returning once again to the abyss
Within the bounds, infernal now
Desolation reigns supreme
Forsaking his majestic realm
The first among the fallen sheds his wings

Cursed with the abysmal key
Tortured souls are now unleased
Possession of this black kingdom
Now the burden of Lord Morpheus

On the nightward shores of dream
Beyond the waking plain
Gates of horn and ivory
Bid welcome to Oneiro's domain
Creator of the dreamscape
Lord of weary minds
Revel in the fields of nightmare
Dreams of the Carrion kind

Monarch of the sleeping marches
Creature of no end
Son of Hypnos, shaper of the dreaming
Triumphantly resolving
The sovereignty of hell
Free now to return to his dominion
