wrath isnide my hate hatred in my souls is becoming an evilliving in fear..trapped in dismay..breathing in mental enslavementanother pray fro nothingness and worship for emptiness there's no salvationyour savior is gonedeath by your own words living in fear..trapped in dismay..breathing in mental enslavementanother pray fro nothingness and worship for emptiness refract the fact despise..i despise the way that you ruledefy..i defy your fucking wisdomdespair..we always live in despaircreating a vision of delusion mental pacifist inherit the diseasean excessive homage for enduring the agony and pain sermon of lies and deceptionbreeding seeds of vengeancemental pacifist inherit the diseasean excessive homage despair deceitdespair in feardespair in lies
