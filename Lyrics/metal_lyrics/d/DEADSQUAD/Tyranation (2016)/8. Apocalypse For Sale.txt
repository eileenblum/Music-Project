Nothingness is cold a machine gun
Maybe i'm only sleeping in asylum with fragment of broken dream
My mind is never free

I'm so closer to the helter skelter dawn of broken world and phenomenon
Sleeping in divine cemetery apocalypse as comodity
Vomiting in sacred grail of fragile faith

I'm crawling in nightmare reality
Scare is business and business is good for them

They create with deluxe package in factory of fear
Spreading the fear trip to heaven
Profits is goal you're just a target!

Confusion is the dope, biased blessed are the drugs

To wish miserable things to hope blur prevision
I'm  a xenosapien from realm of divination comedy
I see the danger, normal is the danger and always the danger

I'm crawling in nightmare reality
Scare is business and business is good for them

They create with deluxe package in factory of fear
Spreading the fear trip to heaven
Profits is goal you're just a target!

Nothingness is cold a machine gun
Maybe i'm only sleeping in asylum
With fragment of broken dream
My mind is never free
