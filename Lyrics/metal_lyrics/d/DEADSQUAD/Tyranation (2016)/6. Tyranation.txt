Their fake regulations are perfect mass guillotine
Greedy ambition is their sacred desecrated faith

Organize the rights of abomination
God money scream louder

Sadistic vision annihilation by the hidden hand of god
Material word we called it nation
Falling from grace

Tyranation tyranny station silence demolition
Tyranation barbaric vision from savage communion

We're drowning in sea of emptiness
And we ain't got the power anymore
Overthrowing lord of fraud
Harmony of injustice system still on the sorrow stereo

Their fake regulations are perfect mass guillotine
Greedy ambition is their sacred desecrated faith
Ruined our life

Organize the rights of abomination
God money scream louder
