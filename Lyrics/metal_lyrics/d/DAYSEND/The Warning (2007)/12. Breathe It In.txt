Turning pages of hours Iâm hoping to be there
To show you Iâm not alone
Blood stains on the road that we have traveled
Much clearer than you believe
Itâs a crying shame that youâre still here alone
Breathe it in
Itâs a colder life than it shines on you
Breathe it in
Well this is one world not meant for you
Sometimes I feel so complicated and frustrated
Sometimes it makes me die alone Iâm alone
Itâs a crying shame that youâre still here alone
Breathe it in
Itâs a colder life than it shines on you
Breathe it in
Well this is one world not meant for you
And I keep holding my shadow over you
Itâs a crying shame
A crying shame
A crying shame
Breathe it in
Itâs colder than life it shines on you
Breathe it in
Well this is one world not meant for you
