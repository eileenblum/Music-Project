The order of this is deterring
I hold the line while you extend this world untold
My character is so unstable
Iâm taken prisoner in this line that you once walked
Burning the fire I am walking the line for you
This story is clouded by blacker days
And Iâm waiting for you to say
That youâll never be cominâ home
Itâs always playing on my conscience
I built the walls and let shit suffer with you
And you would say
Thatâs inner peace
Take it down
Hold it out
Kill it with your lies
Burning the fire I am walking the line for you
This story is clouded by blacker days
And Iâm waiting for you to say
That youâll never be cominâ home
My vision
Calls my name
So today I am alive
And the fire is burning out
And just as soon as you arrive
Itâll keep on calling for you
This story is clouded by blacker days
And Iâm waiting for you to say
That youâll never be cominâ home
My vision
Calls my name
