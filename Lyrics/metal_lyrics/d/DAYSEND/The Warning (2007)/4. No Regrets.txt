Burn
Listen
There is no other way to compromise
Leave out the innocence
I know the answer to
This fucking question
Then hold out
Iâm old enough to feel
I didnât think you were
The last time I checked
You were still human
I didnât know it all seems again
Twice more this happened
And smashed alive
What you believe
What you foresee
The road to hell is long and painful
Let fire and flame take you
Hold out
Iâm old enough to feel
I didnât think you were
The last time I checked
You were still human
I didnât know it all seems again
No regrets
Itâs gone and done
No regrets
The damage done
No regrets
So seen it all
No regrets
Push them away and get to the side
Itâs the difference to change a life
Hold out
Iâm old enough to feel
I didnât think you were
The last time I checked
You were still human
I didnât know it all seems again
No regrets
Itâs gone and done
No regrets
The damage done
No regrets
So seen it all
No regrets
