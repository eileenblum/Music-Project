These words from a wise man
Handed out
The masses have taken them
The war is beginning (beginning)
All for one
One for all
The time is here
The time is now
They spoke
Of a silence
Silence
That theyâll be living
Ashen
From ashes and the damage done
This is a warning from a frantic world unknown
This is a warning where smoking guns will reign
A meat market paradox
Delivered from
The mouth of the loathsome
And waiting this vengeance
Will be swift and nigh
Now the damage is done
They spoke
Of a silence
Silence
That theyâll be living
Ashen
From ashes and the damage done
This is a warning from a frantic world unknown
This is a warning where smoking guns will reign
