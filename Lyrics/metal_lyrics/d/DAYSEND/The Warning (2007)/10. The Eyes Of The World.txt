From ashes
They wait for the moment
I canât stand it
To wait to be murdered
Itâs jealousy
Fantasy
Mutiny
Hypocrisy
Though you never thought you would see the day
Keep falling into the arms of death
Keep falling into eternal rest
War is given
Like deceit
Iâm coming
Crowds have spoken
And what is the verdict
Jealousy
Fantasy
Mutiny
Hypocrisy
Though you never thought you would see the day
Keep falling into the arms of death
Keep falling into eternal rest
For this comfort will only come to those here now
Keep on falling
If the eyes of the world could see you now
Itâs my gift to you
I can see the light
Keep falling into the arms of death
Keep falling into eternal rest
For this comfort will only come to those here now
Keep on falling
If the eyes of the world could see you now
