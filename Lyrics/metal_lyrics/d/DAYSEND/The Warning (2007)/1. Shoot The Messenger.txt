This fate unspoken twice written to page
Now burnt alive by a decision
And now removed until the angels fly
Thereâs a point where one of us will fail
Shoot the messenger
The winding road
Alone with destiny
Shoot the messenger
The consequence
Alone will take me
Well I broke the laws you wrote
Across your face the instrument of my destruction
Now youâll be forgotten âtill the end
Of the day
Nevermore will we look into your eyes
Shoot the messenger
The winding road
Alone with destiny
Shoot the messenger
The consequence
Alone will take me
The fight has come to your doorstep
To your doorstep
Some day
You will find me here
On that day youâll know
Youâll know this fate unspoken twice written to page
Now burnt alive by a decision
And now removed until the angels fly
Thereâs appoint where one of us will fail
Shoot the messenger
The winding road
Alone with destiny
Shoot the messenger
The consequence
Alone will take me
