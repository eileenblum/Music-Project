What is a life like to you
And though she never knew
They said she feels like you do
They said she feels like
And now itâs warmer today
Cold is still on her way
Find your way to my heart
Walk up the walls to find a purpose
I know the reason why I will not stand tall
Donât close the door to hide the curtains
I need to see the winter and I will not be heard
Why is there fools pride at stake
Why does she have to remain
When itâs still further today
When itâs still further today
Said sheâs still like you knew
They said she
Fears
Find your way to my heart
Walk up the walls to find a purpose
I know the reason why I will not stand tall
Donât close the door to hide the curtains
I need to see the winter
And I will not be heard
