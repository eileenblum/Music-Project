Create the waves
Of someone elseâs pain
My evil mind of society
Although you said the same I still believe it
You said Iâm not to blame I donât believe it
Forced down
Weâre not quite there
I know the end of what you see
Forced down
Weâre not quite there
To be the end of what we believe
The violence of silence
Is all Iâve known
The violence of silence
Go take me
I am the one who breaks me
Donât hate me
Just because I hate you too
Thereâs always someway that you live your life
Thereâs always someway that Iâll kill your life
Forced down
Weâre not quite there
I know the end of what you see
Forced down
Weâre not quite there
To be the end of what we believe
The violence of silence
Is all Iâve known
The violence of silence
I am living
Set the fire
Light the flame
The violence of silence
Is all Iâve known
The violence of silence
I am living
