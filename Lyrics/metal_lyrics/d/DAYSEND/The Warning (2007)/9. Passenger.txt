Hide
Under darkness
Itâs cause to stay the foe
The limitations were revealing
Now
The curse is gone
No one to save your soul
Kill the dying light
For solace Iâll remain
Move out and Iâll ride with the passenger
Theyâll scream for their souls
So what is so important you didnât know
Theyâll scream
Curse
The enemy and detonate from my side
Hold the weapon to the fucking temple
A sacrifice
Forcefed and bleeding inside
For solace will remain
For solace Iâll remain
Move out and Iâll ride with the passenger
Theyâll scream for their souls
So what is so important you didnât know
Theyâll scream
Hold the weapon to the fucking temple
Move out and Iâll ride with the passenger
Theyâll scream for their souls
So what is so important you didnât know
Theyâll scream
