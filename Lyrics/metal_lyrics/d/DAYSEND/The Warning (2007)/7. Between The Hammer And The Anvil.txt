The fallen conscience
Rivers of blood
From the fallen
Too easy to fall victim
Beyond what you control
Thereâs so much common ground now
You are born
Then die
Trapped in this place
Helion
Monster
Your final resting place
And youâll know that I am the hammer
Face the day and liberate
For youâll know not the answer
Iâve seen your kind before and
Choose your words
Waste on enemies
Helion
Monster
Your final resting place
And youâll know
That I am the hammer
Face the day and liberate
For youâll know not the answer
I am the hammer
Itâs so fucking easy to become a victim
Beyond what you can control
Hammer
Save yourself
That Iâll give to you
Save yourself
Your final resting place
And youâll know
That I am the hammer
Face the day and liberate
For youâll know not the answer
I am the hammer
