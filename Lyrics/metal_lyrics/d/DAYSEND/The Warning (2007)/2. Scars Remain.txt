This forceful fucking mind
Keeps on playing into the hands of another
Thatâs what you need
Thatâs what she keeps on saying
But you donât need it
Youâve already got it
So fight the pain
The worldâs on fire
The scars that still remain
Will burn
This is why Iâm not afraid
(So much for words unspoken)
When time is not your friend
(The scars that still remain)
And I feel so abused
Hold on
This fear is not the end
Once again youâll know
This is destruction
This is ruin
This is not the answer youâve been looking for
This is what you are
You are chaos
The time has come to open your heart
Open your mind
Open your eyes
So fight the pain
The worldâs on fire
The scars that still remain
Will burn
This is why Iâm not afraid
(So much for words unspoken)
When time is not your friend
(The scars that still remain)
And I feel so abused
Hold on
This fear
Is not the end
And so this time
They crossed the line
There is no more
Life
No more
Questions
No more
No more
No more
Answers
This is why Iâm not afraid

Hold on

Chaos
The time has come to open your heart
Open your mind
Open your eyes
