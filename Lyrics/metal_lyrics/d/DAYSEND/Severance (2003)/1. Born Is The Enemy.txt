Cold and freezing
Holding nothing
I did all this for you

Don't even call me your friend
You will not lose in the end
I see in front of me
Born is the enemy now

Cold and freezing
Holding nothing
I did all this for you
Now there's nothing left for me to do

This is the start of something new
Stains of your guilt are left for you
I see in front of me
Born is the enemy now

Down
You're trying to bring me down
You're not gonna break me

I did all this for you
You're going down
