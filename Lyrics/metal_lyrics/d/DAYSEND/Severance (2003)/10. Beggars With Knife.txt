What you wanna do?
What you wanna see?
Is it not the truth that you want from me?
Now you walk away filled with dignity
and your lies

These lies they wield with knives

No (another lie)
No (another knife)
I'll never let this pain be my enemy
No (another lie)
No (another knife)
You'll never be a part of me

Now you've seen the truth
Felt a part of me
What is it you spew when you're on
the street?
Now you walk away filled with dignity
and your lies.

How could you promise the fruits 
of yesterday?
I won't hold you

Will I concede?
