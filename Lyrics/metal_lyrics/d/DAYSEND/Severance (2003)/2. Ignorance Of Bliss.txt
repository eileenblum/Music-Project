Come down to earth he mentions
Full of his best intentions
It's now time for an occupation 
Time to make some money with that 
education

Come down to ground
Mortgage bound
So proud

Can't you see these dreams will never
end themselves?
Set me free, I will find the beauty of
this world

Come down to earth he mentions
Full of their blind intention 
It.s not time for a inoculation
Time to make some money with your
new foundation

Tied
I won't be tied down
