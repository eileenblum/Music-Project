Well it's safe to say your credibility
Went without your sensibility
All that's left are memories of
What you were supposed to be
I never, I never, I never wanna be
I never, I never, I never wanna be
The sold out lich that you are
Not even God can save you

How did you get conceited?
This is the price you pay
What will you do defeated?
Sold out, sold out

Well it's safe to say your credibility
Went without your sensibility
All that's left are memories of
What you were supposed to be
I never, I never, I never wanna be
I never, I never, I never wanna be
The sold out lich that you are
Don't you know that they hate you?

How did you get conceited?
This is the price you pay
What will you do defeated?
Sold out, sold out
Where was your sense of reason?
We didn't get a say
Wronged by the tides of treason
You sold out, sold out

(You're a fucking sellout lich,
You're a fucking sellout lich,
You're a fucking sellout)
