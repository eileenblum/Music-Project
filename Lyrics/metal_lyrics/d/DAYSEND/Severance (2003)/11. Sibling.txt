I needed a song for you
It's not too easy being so fucking positive
When your life is filled with pain
I nkow it's been hard for you
But now you're old enough
To find the strength within

Believe me it's wrong to do
All of that wasted time inside
Just to do it all again
I know it's been hard for you
But now I've had enough
You've got to learn to swim

Comedown do this for me
Pick yourself up and breathe in
But now I've had enough
You've got to learn to swim

Your feelings of hate for you
Are pretty fucking hard to shake
When your past is filled with shame
I know it's been hard for you
But know the time has come
You either sink or swim
