My life's been holding it's weight
Beneath a blackened sky
So hard I've worked just for 
the dreams to pass me by
Now when the time is right
for me to win this fight
You come along with all your
bells and whistles

Head... I'm in above my head for you

It's way too early or late
But never comes in time
Is this the hell i get for
all my other crime?
No matter how i try I can't
look in your eyes
I need to turn away before
this fills me

Head...
I'm in above my head for you
Head...
I'm in above my head for good

Why?
Turn away from this pain
I wrote this song for you but you'll
never know
