Take this meager offering
Accomplice to your conspiracy
Break down my configuration
Hoping to find a better day

It's never what they say
It's never what they say
It's all about the silence in-between

Into a pain that works for me
The blod of angels
Behind a door we learn to bleed
The blood of angels

Make this another sacrifice
Affording the vulture's appetite
Bring me a slice of consolation
Knowing that there's another way

All this had to bring around 
my ignorance
All this had to bring around
my innocence
