Is it a piece you want
or is it peace you want?
Is this your fatherland?
Is it the holy land?
Am I your enemy or a best friend to be?
Will you meet up with me
over the weekend?

All they say
Misconstrue
Word of war without proof
Can't you see I'm like you?
Brave

I will not live in fear
even with the bombs in sight
I will not disappear
This is the beginning of my life

Is this a holy war or an oil power war?
Is this another phase? 
Is it the end of days?
Am I your enemy or a best friend to be?
Will you meet up with me
over the weekend?

Precious days of our youth
Now a war, what's the use?
Can't you see I'm like you?
Brave

With all the pain and suffering
Brought from the choices they make
How can we close the gap?
This has got to end
Another fake democracy fills
our children with hate
What are our choices when it's 
us or them?
