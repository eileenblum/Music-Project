Burning fires in a perfect mind.
It's a hypocritical sacrifice.

I will not, fade away.
Solitude lives in clarity.

All I know, is all I show
And it's bound to you.

Simple minds.
You'll be my eyes and taint it with your lies.
'til the darkness comes down on you.

Waiting for this, to unfold.
It's a perfect world for a tortured soul

You will never separate broken
Words from a fragile hate.

Choke.

You will never separate broken
Words from a fragile hate.

This time I'll be letting you go.
There's your answer.
