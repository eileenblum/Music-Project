Here I am again, trying to exist, I'm alone,
In a world that's null of adoration.

I can't describe the pain,
Once again I've been betrayed,
The only difference is that I deserve.

I'll see you in my nightmares
With a noose on your neck
You'll be there in the darkness

I have called defeat,
You've anaesthetised my face.
Dissimilate. As long as you believe it I won't.

I'm alone again,
Fuck you and your happiness.
Stay away, with your
Self indulgent cess-pool.

I'll not falter,
To these words that will scar me.
Now I'm so forlorn. Kill me.

Now that piece is missing.
This is your final day.
How far would you go before it's too late?

I can't describe the pain,
Once again I've been betrayed,
The only difference is that I deserve.
