The shades are closing in
Blood stained and suffering
The conflict drives me insane

I'll be, forlorn,
You'll be the victim of this day

I'll chart a course to the unknown
And when I get there
I'll send a message to your home
One day you'll find your way again
Down this hole
These shadows hide what you believe

Try to erase what you've become
You've spread disease amongst us
Amongst us.
