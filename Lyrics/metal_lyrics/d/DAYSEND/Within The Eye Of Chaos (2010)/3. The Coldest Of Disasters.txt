These hands of mine,
Are washed of this fate.
It's pale white,
To waste another day.

You keep wishing for the end, though the
Truth is yours.

Here's another night alone again. Are you
Surprised that I would never let you in?

Well it's the coldest of disasters. Are you
Prepared to be the energy I need?

Collapsing, you've sucked the life from me.
You seem to forget,
That I am not your enemy.

Not your enemy.

I am not your enemy.

I'm falling away from this,
With a lifetime of affliction.

What the hell is happening,
It's pathetic, we're suffering.

When your worlds are so apart
It's easy to collide.

When the coldness of this anger comes
Again,
Well I will be saved,
I will be saved and I will.
