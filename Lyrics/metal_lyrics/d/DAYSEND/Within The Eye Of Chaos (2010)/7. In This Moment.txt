You might think you are perfect,
A specimen of light
And shifting blame with
Your middle finger.

You're so transparent,
Your words mean nothing
And once again you are the victim.

In this moment, you'll fall from grace

When they're calling out your name
Will you be there to answer
Or will you ask for an invitation
Will you be there forever.

I watched your beauty fade away
(You became nothing)
And it was sickening

There's blood on your hands,
Your broken fingers
And still you think you are the victim

Our lives are broken
We'll never get them back
This journey ends with you.
