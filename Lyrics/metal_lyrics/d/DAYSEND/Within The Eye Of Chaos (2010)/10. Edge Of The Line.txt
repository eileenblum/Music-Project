Just for the night, you've got to let it go.
And then you'll know, the edge is so close.

Forget the ties, they'll still be there
Forget the lies, it's only for a while.

Wake up and smell
The bullshit you've been saying
For they will surely see it

Hold it tight, you will swallow
Fight this fight, swallow.

I'll walk the edge of the line.
Where you will crumble.
I'll walk the edge of the line.
And we will let it out tonight

Once it's begun, we won't be letting go
Until the light hits, we won't be slow

So take a chance, and live it now

Wake up and smell the
Bullshit you've been saying
For they will surely see it
