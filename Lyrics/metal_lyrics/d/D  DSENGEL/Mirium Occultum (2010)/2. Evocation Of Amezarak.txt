Thee I evoke, whose iron grip claimed the heavens.
Thee, that didst awaken the fire of Man.
Thee, that didst defy the will of a God.
Thee, that didst ascend.
Thou art ASAR UN-NEFER

HEAR ME, Amezarak!
HEAR ME, Semjaza!
HEAR ME, Mastema!
HEAR ME, SHEMHAZAI!
HEAR ME; RAZIEL!
HEAR ME, LUCIFER!

Come forth, by thy own true name
Come forth, by my own true will

You WILL answer my evocation, you who have seen the name!
I WILL you to come forth, dread angel of ascension!
