A ruin of memories holds my earthly obsession.
I seek for things beyond all understanding.
I create an age where I am someone else.
Chaining my pantheon into life. My demon is my own.

Will your presence persuade me into nothingness?
Ex nihilo nihil fit.
The entity of chaos, shaped as a body of water rising from beneath the sand.
A monument from a forgotten time. Beyond what once were.

And as darkness sets in my eyes, I float from my core.
Unchaining from my forsaken matter of existence. Dying life, living death,
nails steps further into me, as a cloak of mirrors.

Gather the legions, gather the followers of the void.
All risen from the sands of forgotten winds.
A new form will shape the mind, Tearing and
unraveling the enlightened matter of the mind.
My eyes, my flesh, the soul of the idiot god.
Let me know the unknown, as I Gather the shadows.

Clothed in chaos, Pharan Noir
