Within the matter of existence, i journey through sculpted memories.
Neither dead nor dreaming, I slumber within the walls of water.
In a world hidden in nightmares, I mould the dreams of the cult.
i create a new death told in whispers, as I send you into a cycle of eternity.

Chaos inverted in glorious fulfillment. A revival from the stars.
Consciousness manifested by the inner eye,
as a glimpse of truth behind all life.
Reflecting the nightmares of my waking shell. Blinded only by a mask.
A face that no one remembers.

Alor mal ki
Place your visions in me!

TAULYWATH
Dwell in your madness!

YNAFRLTHA'FDA
From behind life and all matter!

WECN'CLUH
Star spawn of Algol!

GTALATHETRF
Arise from the chasm of stone!

All morals to waste, only desire left to fullfill. I emerge in a new form.
I carve the portal, I crush all that is known.
The only way for life to meet the Eye.
