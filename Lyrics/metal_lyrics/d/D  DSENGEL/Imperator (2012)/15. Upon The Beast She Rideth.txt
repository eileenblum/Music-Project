IO BABALON!
IO BABALON!
IO BABALON!

Divine whore, mother
of abominations -
womb of wombs.
Crimson, sacred and
profane-cunt of a
thousand names!

Are you not the well from
which all forms spring into
manifestation, and to which
they shall ALL return?

IO BABALON!
IO BABALON!
IO BABALON!

Mother and whore who birthed
me from oblivion, made
fertile by the seed of will.
Oh how this star burns within.
with the thrice holy lust to
CUM into your oblivion.
And beget eternity.

Forevermore I shall become
Forevermore I shall become
Forevermore I shall become
BEYOND ETERNITY.

For I am becoming itself
and I call upon thee!

THOU HAST CALLED
ME, OH ACCURSED
AND BELOVED FOOL.
MY JOY IS THE JOY OF
ETERNITY, AND MY
LAUGHTER IS THE DRUNKEN
LAUGHTER OF A HARLOT IN
THE HOUSE OF ECSTACY.
SET MY STAR UPON YOUR
BANNERS AND GO FORWARD
IN JOY AND VICTORY.
NONE SHALL DENY YOU, AND
NONE SHALL STAND BEFORE
YOU, BECAUSE OF THE
SWORD OF MY BROTHER.
INVOKE ME, CALL UPON
ME, CALL ME IN YOUR
CONVOCATIONS AND
RITUALS, CALL UPON
ME IN YOUR LOVES AND
BATTLES IN MY NAME,,.

IO BABALON.
