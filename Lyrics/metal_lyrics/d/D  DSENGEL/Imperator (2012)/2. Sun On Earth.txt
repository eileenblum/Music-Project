I have stood before the sun
In its horrifying glory

I raise my body, my earth and my wind
To receive the splendour!

I invoke eternity
I call for eternity
I invoke eternity
I call for eternity
Secret centre of the sun

Flesh reaches in agony to feel
the faint touch of its distant lover
To walk all roads that is not of Him
To make them His.

I invoke eternity
I call for eternity
I invoke eternity
I call for eternity

Sun on earth!
Eternity walks within.
