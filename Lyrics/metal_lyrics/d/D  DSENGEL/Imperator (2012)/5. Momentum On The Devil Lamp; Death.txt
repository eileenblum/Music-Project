I DESCEND!
As lightning, as a bolt of flame
Through the stagnant heavens
Drawn in hellish joy to
my dominion!
My completion! My birthright!
The Rubicon was crossed
upon my creation.
The stars themselves
sing with my flame
And the hearts of men
are mine by nature
I am the great opposer, I
am movement.
I am energy, I am
madness and lust
I am the momentum of the world.
I am the cosmic upheaval, the
all-encompassing ascent!

I build MOMENTUM.
ENERGY, FORCE
FURTHER FURTHER
EVER FURTHER
THROUGH AND BEYOND
THE GATES OF DEATH
Into the infernal core
of the SUN!
I scream in your soul, I
gnaw in your bones.
I will not suffer stagnation.
Rise, disciples of the
Goat and the Skull!

Take your fill of lust, and
abolish forever
The putrid doctrines
of grace(guilt) and
the second death
Drink from the cup of
abominations and embrace
the eternal inferno!
I build MOMENTUM.
ENERGY, FORCE
FURTHER FURTHER
EVER FURTHER
THROUGH AND BEYOND
THE GATES OF DEATH
Into the infernal core
of the SUN!

In every moment - a new death!
Every fraction of a second
- absolute change
My momentum is boundless
My lust unending.

And Hell is the Crown of All.
