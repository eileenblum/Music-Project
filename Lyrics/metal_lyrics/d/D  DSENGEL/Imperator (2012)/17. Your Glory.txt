You who are me beyond all
that I am, deep behind
those eyes of mine.
Stone by stone I have built
my way to your glory.

Blood and time, the essence
of my life are the tools of
this, my great work.
My foolâs journey.

Oh, luciferian soul, my tower.
And all these walls came
down upon me.
Yet, I'd do it all again just to
feast my eyes upon your glory.

I went from Cod to God.
In search of what I am.
Yet you were ever one.
We were ever one.
