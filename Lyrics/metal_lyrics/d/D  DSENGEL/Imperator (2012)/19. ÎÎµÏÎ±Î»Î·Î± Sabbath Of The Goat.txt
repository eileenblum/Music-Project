[by Sir Aleister Crowley]

O! The heart of N, O, X.
the Night of Pan.

Î ÎÎ: Duality: Energy: Death.

Death: Begetting: the
supporters of O!
To beget is to die: to
die is to beget.
Cast the Seed into the
Field of Night.

Life and Death are
two names of A.
Kill thyself.
Neither of these alone is enough.
