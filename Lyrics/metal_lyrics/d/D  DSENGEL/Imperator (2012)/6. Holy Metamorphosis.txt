My god why have I forsaken me
Turning inwards endless depths
Piercing the unholy
A holy metamorphosis
A murder by any definition
I I I...will DIE DIE...DIIIIIE!

To cum unto the Ã¦thers
Forsaking coercion
Leaving fish to rot in the desert
Gorging out the bullâs eye

Fear is I of Pan
Self is the night
Of sublime guiding light
Flowers of old death
Trampled by camelâs feet
Inside the lotus
Aleph blossoms by nun
Pain is thine saviour
Delight is thine destruction
Here with me lieth none...but all
In sweet madness benign
Seeking not above, nor belove
Never forsaken, never forlorn.

IOOOOO PAN!

Pain and suffering brought
Pleasure sought
Transcended... ecstasy wrought

LET THERE BE LIGHT!
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
LET THERE BE LIGHT!
