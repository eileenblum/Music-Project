INHALE!

The serpent breathing!
My heartbeat, my asphyxiant.

I translate my command
to your tongue!
I sustain by unleashing.

Fire of fire, water of water.
air of air, earth of earth!

Nun-Heh-Shin Nun-Heh-Shin.

With heart and tongue the three
concentric circles are broken!
Perfection in destruction!

EXHALE!

In the suit of water I
drown, in the suit of fire
I breathe the flames!

Immuta
