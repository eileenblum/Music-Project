I look into your eyes
But never see a face
Just something to be killed
We're turning to disgrace
If we end our lives this way
Is deception here to stay

They won't go away
We, have been led astray
No, they cover our eyes
We've, been desensitized

Don't ever stop to think
It's wrong to hesitate
Just point the gun and shoot
You can't make a mistake
If we end our lives this way
is deception here to stay

They won't go away
We, have been led astray
No, they cover our eyes
We've, been desensitized

Don't ever stop to think
It's wrong to hesitate
Just point the gun and shoot
You've got no choice

They won't go away
We, have been led astray
No, they cover our eyes
We've, been desensitized
