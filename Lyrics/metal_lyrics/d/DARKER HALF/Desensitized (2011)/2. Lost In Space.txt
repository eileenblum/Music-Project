Have I woken where I went to sleep?
Am I drifting now through time and space,
How to know when I've gone in too deep?
Can I get back from this other place

We've reached a turning point
We're on the edge
Time to save ourselves
Will it end
Life and death are just illusions
See the cracks form in Reality
Time and space Break from their union
Sliding through dimensions endlessly

Am I lost or have I found my way?
Back to this cold dark world that I have seen before?
Lost in another time, caught in another plane of space
Doing all I can to get back once to see your face

We've reached a turning point
We're on the edge
Time to save ourselves
Will it end

Life and death are just illusions
See the cracks form in Reality
Time and space Break from their union
Sliding through dimensions endlessly

Why can't you see
We're facing extinction
Fall to your knees
Pray for redemption

We've reached a turning point
We're on the edge
Time to save ourselves
Will it end

Life and death are just illusions
See the cracks form in Reality
Time and space Break from their union
Sliding through dimensions endlessly
Run Away
