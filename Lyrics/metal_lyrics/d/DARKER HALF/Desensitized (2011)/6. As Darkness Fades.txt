Living in a world of black
In a darkened life I see
We're bound up in the images
Our hands just guess for us
Taking one last step
Is the hardest thing to do
The simplest of tasks for me
Flaunted blatantly by you

As darkness fades and I regain
What was lost
A sight that sees through masks we wear
But at what cost
And I can tell you now
You're fooling no one
You won't like these things that
I can see

I've never known the mystery that is
Sight that is sound I'm forever bound
Can we ever tell what really is
The light, the mask,
That governs us all
How can we live with our head in clouds
What drives you on will leave you empty

As darkness fades and I regain
What was lost
A sight that sees through masks we wear
But at what cost
And I can tell you now
You're fooling no one
You won't like these things that

I can see

As darkness fades and I regain
What I lost
A sight that sees through masks I wear
But at what cost
And I can tell you now
I'm fooling no one
I don't like these things that
I can see
