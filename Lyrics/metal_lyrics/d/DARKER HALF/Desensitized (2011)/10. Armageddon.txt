No
Bring me back to earth
Rip me from the sky
Can I stop the rising tide
Vision starts to blur
Sweat runs down my face
Losing everything I can't replace

We're losing it all
Pushed to the end of my rope

Armageddon's coming down and nothing is the same
Try to run but know that I'm not gonna get away
Is this fear?
Still the silence is the hardest thing to fucking hear

Sinking to the depths
Are we gonna drown
Wind and rain they pelt the ground
Lives are blown to bits
Empires falling down
Short of breath I try to speak But I cant make a sound

We're losing it all
Pushed to the end of my rope

Armageddon's coming down and nothing is the same
Try to run but know that I'm not gonna get away
Is this fear?
Still the silence is the hardest thing to fucking hear
