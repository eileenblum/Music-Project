Wake me from a dream
Images get clearer
I'm here alone,
Nothings as it was before
Tried to speak
Words are just not there for me
Feel myself
Descending through a world of darkness

I turn to see your face
And cry in anger

If I saw into the future
Could I do it all again,
Would I put myself through agony
To get to ecstasy
Would I turn my back And walk away Alone into the dark
Would I live forever knowing...

With the morningrise
Waking life returns to me
Feel as though
I might as well have never slept before,
Long to close my eyes
To see yours in the darkness
But all I see
An Icy stare That looks right through me

This Dream is over
Will I ever sleep again?

If I saw into the future
Could I do it all again,
Would I put myself through agony
To get to ecstasy
Would I turn my back And walk away Alone into the dark
Would I live forever knowing
What was coming from the start

This Dream is over
Will I ever sleep again?

If I saw into the future
Could I do it all again,
Would I put myself through agony
To get to ecstasy
Would I turn my back And walk away Alone into the dark
Would I live forever knowing
What was coming from the start
