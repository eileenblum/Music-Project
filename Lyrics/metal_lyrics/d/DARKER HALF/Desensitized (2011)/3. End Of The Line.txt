Lonely and desperate
Nobody hears my call
Lives have been broken
Enslaving us all
Rhyme without reason
Bridges were built to burn
Nothing is sacred 
Nowhere to turn

We live in a haze
Polluted thought and cowardice,
End the malaise

Falling through uncertainty we're lost
We're cast into this world of madness 
Round and round we're tossed
Falling through uncertainty we're lost
We're waiting for a sign

Why were we taken here
Why were we made to pay
Forever forsaken
Forever enslaved
You think that you'll change the world
You're running out of time
Nothing will be there
It's the end of the line

Each passing day
We lose ourselves in ignorance
When will we pay?

Falling through uncertainty we're lost
Cast into this world of madness 
Round and round we're tossed
Falling through uncertainty we're lost
We're waiting for a sign

Falling through uncertainty we're lost
Cast into this world of madness 
Round and round we're tossed
We're never gone, we're
Falling through uncertainty we're lost
Cast into this world of madness 
Round and round we're tossed
We're never gone, we're
Falling through uncertainty we're lost
Cast into this world of madness 
Round and round we're tossed
We're never gone, we're
Falling through uncertainty we're lost
We're waiting for a sign
