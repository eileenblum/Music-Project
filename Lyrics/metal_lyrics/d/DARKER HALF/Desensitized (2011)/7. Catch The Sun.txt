Are you speaking without words?
Are you singing without melody?
Are you moving to the essence Of this world or of your soul?
Are you searching But not finding it
At all?

Is there anything you seek?
Is there anything you hear?
Are you blackened by a culture?
Of emptiness and of despair?
Are you living or just hiding it
From all?

Never knowing how
Never caring why
You give up everything To try to
Catch the sun
Only now you know
Only now you care
You're losing everything But the sun was black
And now it's gone

Are you hot or are you cold?
Chasing only what you're told?
Do you control
What you're looking for? 
Or has it taken hold?
Is it worth just what you blindly sold 
for it?

Never knowing how
Never caring why
You give up everything To try to
Catch the sun
Only now you know
Only now you care
You're losing everything But the sun was black
And now

What good is it for man
To take this whole dark world
Only forfeiting his soul?
But never out of reach
Never without words of truth
Never far from being whole again
