Out here nothing changes
Not in a hurry anyway
You can feel the endlessness
With the coming of the light of day

Talkin' bout a chosen place
They want to sell it in a marketplace
Just a minute now
Standin' on solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change
Keep blowin down the line

'Round about the dawn of time
Dreaming all began
Proud people come
Livin' in a promised land

Running' from a heart of darkness
Searchin' for a heart of light
Could've been paradise
Standin' on solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change
Were blowin' cold that night

Standin' on the shore one day
Saw white sails in the sun
Wasn't long before you felt that sting
White man white law white gun

Don't tell me that it's justified
'Cause somewhere someone lied
Genocide
Someone lied

Standin' on solid rock
Standin' on sacred ground
Livin' on borrowed time
And the winds of change
Are blowin down the line
