I feel the cold thud of hot lead
Against my beating chest
And as I fall the colours drain from me
All life I once posessed...

War began two years ago
When I was 17
I tried to volunteer
They knocked me back
I couldn't pass the screen
They said "Boy, you're too young
To go war, to fire a gun"
I wish that I had listened then
To what they said

I was untrained and unprepared
Never told I should be scared
(I saw things that no man should ever see)
Staring death right in the face
When I've not even run the race

The war was raging on 
For 10 years with no signs of ending
The men up top were scared
They'd lost so many troops they're sending

So we were sent away
To fight under the desert sun
Only to find our forces
Crippled, understocked and on the run
They came from all directions
They came from holes under the ground
But when we finally saw them
It was too late
It was too late for me

I was untrained and unprepared
Never told I should be scared
(I saw things that no
man should ever see)
Staring death right in the face
When I've not even run the race

I was untrained and unprepared
Never told I should be scared
(I saw things that no man should ever see)
Staring death right in the face
When I've not even run the race
Just a conscript sent to die
Without ever knowing why
So many sent to die in vain
Without a grave to bear their name
We lie unknown

We die so far from home
There's nothing left...
