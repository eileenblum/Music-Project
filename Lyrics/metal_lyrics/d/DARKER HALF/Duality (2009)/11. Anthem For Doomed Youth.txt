And as the sun has nearly set,
Upon this wasteland of regret,
The darkening horizon comes,
To lead the way,
Out come the creatures of the night,
In their thousands.

[chorus]
Why should we wander on,
To blindly follow,
Those who've gone before,
Stop looking to the past,
Start looking forward,
A nightmare future stands before us all!
Will we stand or fall!

Fight for your life!

Creep through darkened city streets,
Wide eyed with fear that never sleeps,
The screeching wail of guns,
Reminds me that I'm far away from home,
Will I see my life again,
Is it over!
