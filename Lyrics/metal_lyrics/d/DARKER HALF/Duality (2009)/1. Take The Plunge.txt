See the path laid out before me,
But there's no signs on the road,
The future is blind before me,
Which way to go,
How should I know!

[chorus]
I could've spent so many nights
wondering what might have been again,
Will I let fate come and take me by the hand,
I should've rolled the dice
and took the plunge
and see where I might land,
Don't know where I'm going
but I know that I'm not coming back!

I've got to make a decision,
Down which path will I go,
No more time to stand here waiting,
I've got to go, that's all I know.
