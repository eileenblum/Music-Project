Tried to scream,
Can't find my
Voice
Been denied of every
Choice
Why is it that they can't
See
The misery they're causing
Me
Made me follow all their
Rules
Time to break out - fuck the
Fools
Now it's time to get them
Back
Rally your forces all out
Attack.

[chorus]
You cannot escape us
We're gonna hunt you down
Darker Half is coming
To slaughter your whole town.

Tried to hold us in
Control
Brought about their own death
Toll
None of them will live to
See
The day we set ourselves
Free
Not a soul is to be
Spared
Torture, pain, now getting
Scared
None of you will live to
See
The day we set ourselves
Free.
