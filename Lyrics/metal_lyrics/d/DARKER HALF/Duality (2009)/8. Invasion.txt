I see the terror on your eyes,
Been forced to fight just to survive,
Always lived in peace before,
Shattered lives destroyed by war,
Ohhh, you came and took our homes,
Never from this day again!

[chorus]
Conquered from the sea and had our homes,
Ripped and torn away,
Fought back long and hard until we fall,
Being crushed again!

It's getting harder every day,.
Just to hold them back at bay,
Spears no match for musket fire,
We won't give in softly either!
Ooh, you came and took our homes,
Never from this day again!

NO! You came and we thought you were gods!
NO! You tore down our homes as we watched,
As you changed our world.

NO! You tore down our cities of stone!
NO! Replaced them with ones of your own,
As you changed our world.

Incas forced to turn and run,
Curse the sight of Spaniards gun,
Life will never be the same,
Claim these shores in our own name,
Searching for a land of gold,
New world richer than the old,
I know we'll find a way,
To take our homeland back!
