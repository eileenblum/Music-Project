You don't know me,
I don't even know myself,
Can't control me,
I will fight you til my dying breath schizophrenia,
Multi-personality,
Feel it taking over,
Suddenly not who I used to be!

[chorus]
Feel it taking hold,
All thought is drained from me,
Nothing I can do,
It's taking over me.

Trapped inside these,
Ever growing web of lies,
Why'd you show me beauty?
Now I know a monster lurks inside,
Integration,
As I break out of my head,
Know I seem a little crazy but,
I'll be right in the end.
