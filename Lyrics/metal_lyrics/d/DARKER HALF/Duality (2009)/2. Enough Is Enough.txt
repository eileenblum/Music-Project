Keep on believing you're
living your life your own way
Their influence just grows every day
All that you hear you will
instantly trust
What we're shown as diamonds
turns out to be rust.

[chorus]
Taking gladly what you're given
All too blind to see the way
Want a different world to live in
Can't take this one more day.

We live in an age that is ruled
by a blanket of fear
Don't know if to believe
what i see or hear
Might be true or it might not
there's just no way to tell
While they build themselves heaven
they're giving us hell.
