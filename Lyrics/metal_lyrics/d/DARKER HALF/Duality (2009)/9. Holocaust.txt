Senseless violence,
Breaks the silence,
Thousands slaughtered,
More were tortured,
Deadly chamber no escaping,
Careless for the lives they're taking.

[chorus]
Holocaust,
Holocaust,
Holocaust,

Persecution,
No solution,
Taste of death sits on your breath,
Concentration,
Mass damnation,
Death becomes a realization.

Bombs are flying,
Soldier dying,
Bodies corpses multiplying,
For what reason I can't see,
Brainwashed servants,
Kill for thee.
