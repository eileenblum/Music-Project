Decide our fate
We are the stains of life you suffer from
You uttered the words
They ascribe them to god
I opened their book
For the nightmares to stop
With the pages still burning
I turned to rewrite
So that she made of darkness
May step into light

World, ignite (dodati growl)
When the darkness calms the light
And everything in sight returns to nothing

Behold, she rises beyond your faith
Our mother, infested with your blight
Barbarians stab her with rusted delights
While she laughs at your gods
Dying stars ornament her eyes
She looks to her acolyte
As she turns the world into black and white

Glorify the nigh-black sky
Nature personified wills your embrace
The sum of earthly bliss to end all life
Primordial art thee

Decide our fate
Decide our faith

Humans are a plague upon the mother Earth
To meet the fates pursuing us
Accuse not nature, she hath done her part
The drought of life, to me it seems a bitter thing to drain
And see, in bitter truth, we spew it out again
