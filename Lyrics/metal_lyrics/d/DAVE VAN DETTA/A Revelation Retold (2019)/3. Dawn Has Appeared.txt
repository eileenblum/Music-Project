Few nations trapped
In pretentious faith
Of the sand god
I offer bitter truth
Of the flaming Jahannam
I am the sun
Rising from the west
I bring the chilled winds
Across the Red Sea

Are all your crimes forgotten?
Now that Ø§ÙÙÙ has fallen
My foot is of too high
To set in Medina and Makkah
Forget the name of your lord, the most high
Allah, I taunt thee, O false god
I lead the exodus of your slaves
Iblis, bless me
I am the son of the
Son of Dawn
The child murdering scum
Awaits judgement
Those who have raped
Will be raped by the sword
Every Kafir
Shall be freed from the "faith"
In the name of thee
No more war
No mosque can hear a prayer
No kneeling before thee, no more
My Nations, Dawn has appeared
Farqubin nasal mubim God is no more

Smoke rises from both sides of my caravan
And engulfs the sinking earth
O my friends come to me!
I am the one who has made your limbs and
given you sustenance
That we may return the light and his glorious might
The age of religion has come to an end
By unfaithful men who have shunned warfare
O how I dread thee, Allah, lord of genocide
No god but a corruptive human mind
O I've seen a world deny you,
Your hashahin melt to salt
As Dajjal I mold this world
And the world to come
