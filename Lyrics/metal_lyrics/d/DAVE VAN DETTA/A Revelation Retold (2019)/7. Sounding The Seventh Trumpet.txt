From the earth to the skies
Right in front of my eyes
I could see the world ablaze
See the devil rise
I've seen hopelessness
And wings disappear
In an endless war
That only brought tears

Is this the end
That we were promised
Or is it that our god
Never gave us notice
What have we done to be
Banished eternally
Who are we to be
The victims of this destiny

No, I won't give in to this torment
This ain't salvation its damnation, God!
Is this the price that we pay now
For having lived under you all these years

Now, when death echoes
Save yourself, I'll fight alone
So sound the trumpets to bring the end

Hale and fire, mingled with blood
Are thrown down to earth
As we drag through the mud
A third of the Sun, of the moon and the stars
Are darkened complete with the darkness that scars
The time has come for the woes to be carried
Hear our cries for those we have buried
So bring an end to this violence,
Soon after the wrath of the Lamb
Comes this maddening silence

Now, when death echoes
Save yourself, I'll fight alone
So sound the trumpets to bring the end

Eternal, the torment, delivered, rejection
The remnant, awakened, upon his second coming
Death, Destroyer, I see the angels falling
(now realize and save yourself)
Unfaithful, almighty,
(from our God)
Sounding the seventh trumpet
