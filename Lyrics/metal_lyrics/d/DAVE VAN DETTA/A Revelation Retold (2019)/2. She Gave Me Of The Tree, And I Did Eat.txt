I have resonated from the higher planes
And have emerged into mortal flesh
I have risen from the sea
And witnessed a world in decay
YWHW, agent of Enlil
Iâll rip thy throat apart
And drink in the name of apostasy
To end this divine comedy

I am the beast that came
To liberate this horrid earth
I am the Antichrist, the one who denies
The father and the son
I am Fenrir
The twilight of the old gods and the new
Come revelations, when their end is due

With your savior crawling
The End is calling me instead
Since your gods have fallen
The endless river
Flows beyond the night
Hidden forever in plain sight

The Earth was shaken
Long before I came to blaspheme against
God, and those who dwell in heaven
Denying us the truth of life

The bowls are spilt
The Elite blind the Earth
Who shall deceive the ones
Who deceiveth the world

I will ascend unto the heavens
Raise my throne above the stars of gods
I will sit on the mount of assembly
And make myself the Most High

Less than archangel ruined
She promised Iâll be freed
If I invoke what she offered
Coming from her seed
Of her hand no harm could come
The end would justify the deed
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat
When she gave me of the tree, I did eat

With your savior crawling
The End is calling me instead
Since your gods have fallen
The endless river
Flows beyond the night
Hidden forever in plain sight
The end is dawning
And masses follow me instead
Of the gods now fallen
The endless river
Flows beyond the night
Hidden forever in plain sight

On first mirrored sight
The coalesce became fact
Our spirit truly divine
In this being we said
I am forever yours
And you forever mine

I will oppose and exalt myself
Above every so-called god
Or object of worship
I will surpass the temples of gods,
proclaiming us to be above them.
For the promise of heaven
You gave them this world
They took so much
And it will never be enough
So I ask you
Will you eat the fruit
Or let them consume us
In the name of the father,
the son and the holy spirit
Amen!
