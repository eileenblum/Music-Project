I stand before the holy see, a storm
At last the ancient city burns under a new regime
The Earth will shake as the
Religions fall to shame
Let the ones with insight calculate my name

Now the numbers speak of innocence
Tav Resh Samech Vav

Do you accept the Beast as your friend and savior?
Take my hand and ascend with me
Into one last forever

I heard the anthem sung
By the ghosts of Babylon
I watched the world as one
Take off it's chains
And bow to no one
A rising song that set aflame
The hearts of men who once feared my name
Into a world that I create
Led away are the small and the great

Chime now the bells
For the ending anthem has begun
At last apostasy lives through the sound of thee
Upon my head the names of blasphemy
The sacred number of man
Has defined the Beast

Behold the blooded skies
Reflect the night
When the city of god is defaced
The cross has blinded enough
I tear their disguises
As the Vatican falls
Our Babylon rises

I hear the anthem sung
As I defend new Babylon
I saw us all transcend,
Myself become the shepherd of the damned
I saw a tower standing tall
I saw the Anunnaki fall
I saw your gods descend
With open arms I greet the end!

Out of the burning lake
I emerged untouched,
Lest I let the Lamb judge
For another 1000 years
I am
The number of Man
While they cannot buy, they cannot sell
The mindless sheep yell
"May Lord have mercy on your soul"
Your "Lord" does not exist at all
I stand before the holy see, a storm
At last the ancient city burns under a new regime
The bell of Marco rings,
A religion swallowed by it's flames
And their gods bow down to the Beast with many names

The earth quakes before us
And the heavens tremble
Only we remain
Challenging the very throne of god

Behold the blooded skies
Reflect the night
When rapists and gods are defaced
They've trembled in fear
As they might have sensed it
Who is like the Beast?
Who can wage war against it?
