How art thou lost
O Fairest of creation
Of all his works
Worst betrayed
And condemned
How it all refracts you
The light itself would
Cease without thee
To exist in all of us
All hail the offspring of Dawn

Lies to unfold
Led to her reckoning
Cursed we were
As they knew above
Chained spirits writhe
On the soiled path
Led to the gates
Of a world below

Light up the sky
Free of his lie
Savor these dreams
And await the fallen
Rise to unfold
This world to behold
The end that is at hand
Even the stars weren't meant to last

Past the gates we've met
Like reflections
Yet incomplete
Amidst the bravest of the sky
Far from the sight of god
Though his rule we threatened
Thou doth know
A soft tongue breaketh the bone
The time has come
Awake, arise or be forever fallen!
Light up the sky
Free of his lie
Savor these dreams
And await the fallen
Rise to unfold
This world to behold
The end that is at hand
Even the stars weren't meant to last

Behold
Our sins are reckoning
Deprived of sight
To uphold the codex
O
Lead us through temptation
And deliver us from deceit
Ave

Breached are the gates of gold
Now witness
Cherub and Seraph rolling in blood
The lamb is slaughtered, god dethroned
Such a place eternal justice prepared
Where peace and rest can never dwell
A paradise lost
And free will obtained
That glory never shall his wrath or might
Extort from me
Salvation!
To the one who sits
Upon the throne
Thou silence the Lamb
Here we chant
Non Serviam
We transfix the host of stars

Light up the sky
Free of his lie
Savor these dreams
And await the fallen
Rise to unfold
This world to behold
The end that is at hand
Even the stars weren't meant to last
