[Bonus track]

This is relentless
Your poor men forming in the streets
To live
This is monumental
Your children dying in the streets
For why?

This is a eulogy
The silent screaming from me
Eulogy
The only way we can never care

This is relentless
We journey in a world of disbelief
In lies
This is fucking hopeless
Killing the poets broken dreams
For why?

This is a eulogy
The silent screaming from me
Eulogy
The only way we can never care

The march of blind destruction
No longer will they sleep
Our own annihilation
What we sowed, we shall reap
We shall reap

This is relentless
Destroy the world with selfish greed
This is fucking useless
In our own hole that we create
For why?

This is a eulogy
The silent screaming from me
Eulogy
The only way we can never care
