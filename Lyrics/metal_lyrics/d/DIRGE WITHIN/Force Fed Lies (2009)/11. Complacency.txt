[Featuring Corey Beaulieu (Guest Guitar Solo), Virus (Guest Guitar Solo) &amp; Michael Angelo Batio (Guest Guitar Solo)]

Apologetic absolution revolves on an axis of hate
Referencing to the end of an age where darkness seeks out the light
And folds away the truth of a better tomorrow
There is no call, there is no sight
The only freedom left lies behind the eyes in the womb
There is nothing, there is only this

The seed has taken over
The lies are getting colder
Bullets replace the word and the visions make me sober
Raise your hands in praise, and forgive the fallen idol
Put the child to its death and perpetuate the cycle

Everyday I feel the same, even when I numb the pain
I'm like a slave in this complacency
Everything I've felt is wrong, all sign of hope is gone
I can't escape from this complacency

Waken ties of culture, and sever lines of structure
Find release in certainty and devour all the mortar
Terror for freedom
Freedom from terror

Everyday I feel the same, even when I numb the pain
I'm like a slave in this complacency
Everything I've felt is wrong, all sign of hope is gone
I can't escape from this complacency

The seed has taken over
The lies are getting colder
Bullets replace the word and the visions make me sober
Terror for freedom
Freedom from terror

Everyday I feel the same, even when I numb the pain
I'm like a slave in this complacency
Everything I've felt is wrong, all sign of hope is gone
I can't escape from this complacency
The complacency strain...
