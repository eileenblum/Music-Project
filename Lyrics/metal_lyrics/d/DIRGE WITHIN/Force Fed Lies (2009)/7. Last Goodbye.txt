This is the end
Realize that all hope is lost
We're living tortured every second
We can't pretend
Take my hand as we turn to dust
It only hurts you for a second
Here comes the pain
So...

Tonight, the time has come to say our last goodbye
I'll die before I walk away
Goodbye
I'm sorry
This might hurt so close your eyes
Don't cry
Turn and look away

Now is the time for the sickness to eat away
All the pain that's left inside
A cancellation
Emancipation of our love
Beaten down and broken down
Here comes the pain
So...

Tonight, the time has come to say our last goodbye
I'll die before I walk away
Goodbye
I'm sorry
This might hurt so close your eyes
Don't cry
Turn away and say your last goodbye

Tonight, the time has come to say our last goodbye
I'll die before I walk away
Goodbye
I'm sorry
This might hurt so close your eyes
Don't cry
Turn and look away

Tonight, I'm staring down the barrel of my life
Goodbye
Blow it all away
