There is a nightmare coming, a flock that's about to break
Away from herds that follow all the selfish names of hate
This is a new indictment, this is the final call
For all that love their freedom, this is justice for us all

This is a song for the voiceless
A psycho symphony
The anthem for all the hopeless
The voice of a new disease

One nation under god and one nation under grave
A little black book to bring all of the nameless to their knees
This is you passing judgment, this is your dying dream
Hope you're choking on it a the falling angels scream

This is a song for the voiceless
A psycho symphony
The anthem for all the hopeless
The voice of a new disease

Our blood and tears have built the world
Our hearts have give everything
Your lies have raped and killed our world
Our hate consumes us all

We're coming to your houses, and we're knocking down your door
We are the new beginning, here to settle up the score
A fleet of new arrivals, a flock of naked sheep
Your end becomes our freedom, this is the new reality

This is a song for the voiceless
A psycho symphony
The anthem for all the hopeless
The voice of a new disease
