[Featuring Edsel Dope (Guest Vocals)]

Your absolution
A false solution
You're no better off than me

No evolution
No retribution
For the words I don't believe

You can pray for me to follow

You can pray for me to follow
But... I have no religion
I can take the pain
God damn, it don't mean shit to me
You don't mean shit to me
I am my decision
I can take the blame
God damn, you don't mean spit to me

Your revelation
The masturbation
Of all that you believe

A confirmation
Your intoxication
Is the sanctity you need

You can pray for me to follow
But... I have no religion
I can take the pain
God damn, it don't mean shit to me
You don't mean shit to me
I am my decision
I can take the blame
God damn, you don't mean spit to me

I won't be your victim
You're fucking killing me
This world is killing me

I won't be your victim
You're fucking killing me
This world is killing me

I have no religion
I can take the pain
God damn, it don't mean shit to me
You don't mean shit to me
I am my decision
I can take the blame
God damn, you don't mean spit to me
