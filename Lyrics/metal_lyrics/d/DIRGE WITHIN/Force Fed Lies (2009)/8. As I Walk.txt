The signs are coming in from every direction, and all the things that we believe have turned into lies

We walk the path we have chosen
Let go
And you pray for nothing as the falling angel screams

I am the only one that understands, as I walk through the ashes alone
Of flesh and bone I understand, as I walk through the ashes alone

The streets are laid to waste as innocent victims fall from the sky
Because the devil burned off their wings

We walk the path we have chosen
Let's go
And you bleed for nothing as the falling angel screams

I am the only one that understands, as I walk through the ashes alone
Of flesh and bone I understand, as I walk through the ashes alone

Silently we bleed, for the American Dream
One more digression
Another suppression

We walk the path we have chosen

I am the only one that understands, as I walk through the ashes alone
Of flesh and bone I understand, as I walk through the ashes alone
