All alone, abandoned, upon the floor
Still inhaling the stink of you
Took away a loss that cannot repair
Still you live your life without a care

Sadist
Rapist
Inside I feel the hate that burns
She couldn't make a sound
This pain is real like a worm it turns
As her world came crashing down

I will rip out your fucking heart
I will draw a line through you
I'll repay the loss of innocence
A drop of blood for every one of you

Sadist
Rapist
Inside I feel the hate that burns
She couldn't make a sound
This pain is real like a worm it turns
As her world came crashing down

Inside I feel the hate that burns
She couldn't make a sound
This pain is real like a worm it turns
As her world came crashing down

Inside I feel the hate burn
All for you
The stain of humanity
