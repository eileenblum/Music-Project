Welcome home to the land of treason
Victimized by conspiracy
Marching on, it's the killing season
Join the murderous parade

Scan the Earth and release the soldier
Gun in hand he crawls through the mud
Sweat pours as you pull the trigger
And paint the walls with blood

Force fed lies
A plague of ignorance
Force Fed Lies
We'll burn it down, let's burn it down

Say a prayer for the unknown soldiers
On their backs they make not a sound
Give their lives for a badge of honor
Six feet below the ground

Force fed lies
They prey on ignorance
Force Fed Lies
We'll burn it down, let's burn it down
