[Featuring Wayne Static (Guest Vocals)]

This is my last chance to walk away from you
Forgotten memories peel off the faded truth
No more excuses, no more feeling left inside
The judgment has been cast
All morals thrown aside

Inhuman
I have become
Inhuman
Now there's nothing left of me
You did this to me

Deny one more time that you are all to blame
As my eyes start to twitch, my hands they do the same
No more excuses, no more feelings left inside,this very second, all the good in me dies

Inhuman
I have become
Inhuman
Now there's nothing left of me
You did this to me

Blood falls like rain
Will you scream again?
Through all this pain
I'll smile again
Fuck You!
Now there's no more...
No more words...

Inhuman
I have become
Inhuman
There is nothing left

Inhuman
I have become
Inhuman now there's nothing left of me
You did this to me
