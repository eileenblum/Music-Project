Everyday it's all the same, a vicious cycle
A parasite within the flesh
Silence closing in
Sick of all the stress brought by inconsistencies
Tight around the neck

All the hate I feel, it comes from you
And it's taking over
All my life I've had regrets
The scars, I bear tell all

Another life becomes a death, each day getting colder
Evolving to the hate inside, but darkness still remains
Needing a release from the walls that now decay
Succumbing to the madness

All the hate I feel, it comes from you
And it's taking over
All my life I've had regrets
The scars, I bear tell all

Breathe in the pain cause it's all that remains
Breathe in the fear cause it's all that saves you

All the hate I feel, it comes from you
And it's taking over
All my life I've had regrets
The scars, I bear tell all
