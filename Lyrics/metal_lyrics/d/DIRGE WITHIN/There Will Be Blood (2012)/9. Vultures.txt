I stand a martyr
Looking down upon all my failures
Why can't I see this is my new reality

I falter

This is the final breath of ignorance and denial
The pain inside of me is driven by the guilt and fame
And all this will devour

No one can see
The man inside of me
The breath in front of me
I must walk alone

I falter

This is not an illusion
I will not be the one who dies unknown
(You'll be the one who dies alone)
For the sake of vengeance
The vultures circle above my fate

(As I walk the road that stands in front of me, I will fear no death, I will fear no evil. Stricken by the hand given to me from God, I will find the answer.

The truth stands before my eyes, and I will breathe in forgiveness, for I am...)
REDEEMED!

I am the one who takes revenge
I am the one who saves his soul
I have the strength to carry on
I am FOREVER

This is not an illusion
I will not be the one who dies unknown
(You'll be the one who dies alone)
For the sake of vengeance
The vultures circle above my fate
