Remember when you said
That I would never amount
And never live up to anything
Saying that I would somehow lose control
And become a failure

Fight [4x]
Everyday was a fight to survive
'til I embraced this life
Put my middle finger up to the sky

This is a war
As I prepare for victory
Just admit defeat
Just admit defeat

Now I will take this anthem
And I will shove it down your throat
This is my turn in the spotlight

Tell me what is left
But killing fields of all that doubted me
'cause this is not for me
This is for my enemies

For every time you tried
Tried to make me feel like
That I would never become something more
And I'd never leave this place I called a home
This is me saying fuck you

Fight [4x]
Everyday was a fight
But now I can enjoy my prize
Knowing now that you were always wrong

This is a war
As I prepare for victory
Just admit defeat
Just admit defeat

Now I will take this anthem
And I will shove it down your throat
This is my turn in the spotlight

Tell me what is left
But killing fields of all that doubted me
'cause this is not for me
This is for my enemies

C'mon

This is for my enemies

Now I will take this anthem
And I will shove it down your throat
This is my turn in the spotlight

Tell me what is left
But killing fields of all that doubted me
'cause this is not for me
This is for my enemies

This is not for me
This is for my enemies
