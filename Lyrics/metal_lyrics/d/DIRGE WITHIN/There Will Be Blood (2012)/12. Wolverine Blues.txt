[originally by Entombed]What you believe
is the vanity you conceive
What you love you don't pen
to put in a cage is to put to an end

Enamored of the passion
life-sucking lust
you will never gain my trust

I'm a misanthropical breed
insatiable in my need to feed

Utterly fearless
for your luscious flesh
I've got an appetite like a war
and I always hunger for more

Vicious mammal
the blood is my call
pound for pound
I am the most vicious of all
