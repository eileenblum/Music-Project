Prepare yourself for the eradication
The extermination of the human condition
We clear the streets as all the buildings collapse
And all the fire from the crackers start to burn us alive

Your whole disorder unleashed

The Sun is faded as we destroy the skies
We find the truth from the lies
Now we'll never escape this
Remembering all the warnings they gave us
Our lives have betrayed us
And now we will all die

Your vanity has sealed our fate

The fires black the Sky
The air is choked with sulfur
Your arms cry out to Heaven
There will be blood
On our hands

This disease has infected
The cancer of our time
With our world left neglected
It swallows us alive
Swallows us alive

From the ashes a new order will arrive
They are the ones that survive
They are the new beginning
They rebuild just to follow
Countless acts they will repeat

The cycle begins again

The fires black the Sky
The air is choked with sulfur
Your arms cry out to Heaven
There will be blood
There will be blood
