A line has been drawn in the sand
I forbid you to cross it
Taking my time off the plague
Washing the sickness away
I can not stop this for it is my fate
Baptized in death I was made to erase all the swine

Blood has now became the only release
Of all the voices inside of my head
I will not stop till my job is complete
Dead or alive or just better off dead

Murder... savior
Look at your life
I am your death
I am the bringer of eternal rest
Look at your life
I am your death
I am nothing

Your simple regrets from the sin
I enslave to this process within
The mirrors gazes a unholy place
As I crushed it all over my face
I'll take what is rightfully mine
Denying the angels a plot of the lamb

Blood has now became the only release
Of all the voices inside of my head
I will not stop till my job is complete
Dead or alive or just better off dead

Murder... savior
Look at your life
I am your death
I am the bringer of eternal rest
Look at your life
I am your death
I am nothing

I will live, live forever
And through my days I will escape September
This is real, I am your murder... savior
And my heart set, I will end your suffering

You will not get away
And there is no escape
Just try to accept that you
Belong to me

Do you believe in God?
Do you believe in God?
