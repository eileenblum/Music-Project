This hate rising
Will it come and suffer me?
This is war on all sides
All the same fights
Are fought again
My fist, your face, my retribution
Calling all lies for this new constitution
And if this continues
We ll see the end

Every day of my life
I get sick of this fight
But I will defend my honor

Give me one more chance
To find your weaknesses
As the blood in my veins
Courses, unchanged
I will defend
No life no death, just execution
Setting my sights on this final solution

All your false pretenses
Will fade away

Every day of my life
I get sick of this fight
But I will defend my honor

This is absolution
There is nothing left for you to say to me
I am resolution
Apologies mean nothing to me

But I still repent

I will defend my honor
(HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!)

This is absolution
There is nothing left for you to say to me
I am resolution
Apologies mean nothing to me

To me!
