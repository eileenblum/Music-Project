Tell me now, how could I see this coming
One last kiss before we said goodbye
I still feel your finger tips upon me
I can't think no matter how hard I try.

When the walls are falling, will you leave again?

Every day I have to give up trying
I am dying here without you.
And everyday I have to keep denying,
I just can't live my life without you.
I cannot live without you!

Just one look
You had me falling to your every wish
You cracked this heart of stone
All my life I have been waiting for you
Now I'm all alone

When the walls are falling, will you leave again?

Every day I have to give up trying
I am dying here without you.
And everyday I have to keep denying,
I just can't live my life without you.
I cannot live without you!

Oh wooo [x4]

Every day I have to give up trying
I am dying here without you.
And everyday I have to keep denying,
I just can't live my life without you, without you.
