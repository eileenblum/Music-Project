Carry out my sentence with urgency
So I cannot pretend
I cannot fantasize
That this was just a passing phase
And when I
Look up and see your face
It burns a hole very deep inside my brain
Gave up everything
To show you the real me inside

The one I see
In my own reflection

As we wait for things to fall into place
Suffocate
With every breath that I take
And I won't believe that this was just a dream
'Til we're saved
So just prey on me

Please
Carry out my sentence before I bleed
And put me in the ground
Or help me rise again
Cause only you have the power to set me free
So
Do we tempt our fate
And take a piece of the poison apple?
We gave up everything

Just to prove that this is real
And not just an untimely tragedy

As we wait for things to fall into place
Suffocate
With every breath that I take
And I wonât believe that this was just a dream
âTil we're saved
So just prey on me

What is the story about?
Everything Iâve ever known
In my world comes crashing down
With all thatâs inside of me
My chest about to explode
Now this is my reality

What is the story about?
Everything weâve ever known
In our world comes crashing down
With all thatâs inside of you
Your chest about to explode
Now this is your reality

As we wait for things to fall into place
Suffocate
With every breath that I take
And I wonât believe that this was just a dream
âTil we're saved
So just prey on me
