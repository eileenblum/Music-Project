I lie asleep
A portrait of what we
Want to believe
This is never ending
You left me with uncertainty
If only I had listened
Everything inside of me
Will never keep you here

When this fight comes to an end
I just wanna be with you again

Here I am, with the memories
Back and forth again
Such a distant voice
And it calls to me, with the memories
That I'm drowning in
With my dying breath

No words to speak
No one to hear me scream
Uncertainty is still taking over
What's left of me, I cannot be
If only I had listened
Dying for an answer
As I stand above your name

When this fight comes to an end
I just wanna be with you again

Here I am, with the memories
Back and forth again
Such a distant voice
And it calls to me, with the memories
That I'm drowning in
With my dying breath
Once again...

What's understated
There will be an end
What's overrated
All the words we left unsaid

Memories...
Memories are all we have
Memories...
Memories are all we have

Here I am, with the memories
Back and forth again
Such a distant voice
And it calls to me, with the memories
That I'm drowning in
With my dying breath
Once again...
