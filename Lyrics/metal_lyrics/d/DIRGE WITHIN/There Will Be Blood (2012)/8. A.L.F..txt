Is this our final chapter?
Is this our final stand?
Will we have an answer
As the world dies by our own hand?
Can we escape the future?
Can we redeem ourselves?
As the time comes creeping closer
A bullet train to our own Hell

As the sky opens up
To reveal what s to come
What will we choose to believe?
(CHOOSE TO BELIEVE!)
As all light is fading
And all hope is gone
Will this truly be the end?
(TRULY BE THE END!)

Are these words too late?

Is this our Armageddon?
Is this the end of days?
Blinded ignorance and
Vanity have laid us to waste
There is no resurrection
There is no turning back
As we stare up to the heavens
Who knew this day would be our last?

As the sky opens up
To reveal what s to come
What will we choose to believe?
(CHOOSE TO BELIEVE!)
As all light is fading
And all hope is gone
Will this truly be the end?
(TRULY BE THE END!)

Are these words too late?

As the sky opens up
Who will we choose to believe?

As the sky opens up
To reveal what s to come
What will we choose to believe?
(CHOOSE TO BELIEVE!)
As all light is fading
And all hope is gone
Will this truly be the end?
(TRULY BE THE END!)

Are these word too late?
AS WE WAIT TO DIE!
Are these words too late?
