In the night I heard the sound of silence
I looked to the mirror of my soul
Dead body cold white skin
Behind in fog of me
I fell in bad emotions

A new hate entery my eyes
The sun may never rise
On the cross my mirror
I wished you death would crack my shell
I wished to god
I wished to hell

A step away
Something behind me
My brain stands still
In my vein boiled hate and hate

I took an axe to your head
A headless corpse
The dark side of my mind
In my mind I need to kill
I took your life from you
I'm not me
But my Death Voice in me

Death Voice in me

I feel the fire I feel the pain
Now you can't give me the blame
I'll follow the army of hate
I see me in an evil game

I feel the fire I feel the pain
Now you can't give me the blame
