I watched your steps, I studiet - your behavior every day
I know your way of thinking - And you will die today
No matter when - no matter where - cause you will not
Survive - I am the assassin - and I will take your life

You will cease to exist - there is no chance to resist
Take your final breath - enter the realm of death

The past had questions - the dark embraces
Lost Forgotten Guilt

I have got the power - master of life and death
Take care, because the next one - may be your final breath
My finger at the trigger - the bullet for your head
The moment I am puling it - you will be fuckin' dead

You were led by greed - which justifies my deed
You woll no longer be - there is no god for me

The state of haze and blaze - evokes bad blood between
My parade of dishonour - sets a sign for all others
The wall is down - in this world today
Why the sunlight - turns to darkness - for you

Cause and effect - your past strikes back
Cause and effect - the rope around your neck
Cause and effect - your past strikes back
Cause and effect - the bullet in your head

You will cease to exist - theres no chance to resist
Take your final breath - enter the realm of death

Feeling down an dout - feeling there is no doubt
But I'll teach you otherwise

I have got the power - master of life and death
Take care, because the next one - may be your final breath
Now I pull the trigger - the bullet hits your head
I am your judge, believ me - there is no regret

You were led by greed - which justifies my deed
You woll no longer be - there is no god for me
