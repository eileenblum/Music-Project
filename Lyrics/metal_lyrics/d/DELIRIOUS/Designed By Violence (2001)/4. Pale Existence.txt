You feel the darkness
Your father died by suicide
You feel the darkness
You mother died last night

You thought that was a dream
You thought that was a dream

You go to church - to pray!
You call to god - help me!!
There's still so much - to say
For Me!!!

Your path of doom - foretold
Your damned soul - is sold
And you blood - runs cold
Inside my mind!!!!!!!!!

Reject emotions
That ones filled your heart
Lost memories
And now you're off your guard
Broken hope
Your head will be served
And finally
You get what you deserve

Screaming out the pain that fortured
Your Pale Existence in the sight of
Violence - demise has been foreshadowed

You go to church - to pray
You call to god - help me!
There's still so much - to say

Screaming out the pain that tortured
Your Pale Existence I the sight of - Violence

Your path of doom's - foretold
Your damned soul - is sold
And your blood - runs cold

You will pray in then name of god
God help me to forget my sins
God help me to forget my sins
You will pray in the name of god
