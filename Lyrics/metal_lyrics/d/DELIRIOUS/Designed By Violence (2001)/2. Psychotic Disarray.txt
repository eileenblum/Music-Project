Are you paranoid?
Are you paraniod enough to take all this?
They are always after you
Running down the empty street
The men in black breathe down your back!

Are you insane?
Are you insane enough to stand all this?
They are always beside you
And keep disturbing your mind
The fear screams so loud you can hear!

Psychotic Disarray
Pounding in your brain

Blind and insane
But you're not to blame
Your mind's lame
And went out of frame
But your will won't break
When your life's stake
And for hell's sake
Let it not fade

Until you make them pay
'cause it's what they say
You're in the way
You're in a state of Psychotic
Disarray... Disarray... Disarray... Disarray!

Are you perverse?
Are you perverse enough to believe all this?
They are always chasing you
Breaking down the shields
The world for you has become a battlefield!

Are you paranoid?
Are you paranoid enough to take all this?
They are always after you
Running down the empty streets
The men in black breathe in your back!

You're not sane
You're not sane enough for all of this
They were madly driven
Not to let the knowledge spread
But in the end aren't we all dead?
