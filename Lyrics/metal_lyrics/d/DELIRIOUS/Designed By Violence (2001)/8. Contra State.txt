Near to a new way of life
Leaving behind all post strife
Everybody's snsing the change
We're players in a new game

Let us cross this border
We Princes of the New Disorder!
The old leaders and tyrants
Die in the blazing fires

We're no more workers of words
But builders of worlds
The chance of a lifetime at hand
To learn and understand

Ring out the old - Bring in the new
Ring out the false - Bring in the true
Ring out the false - Bring in the true

Contra State

Open wide the gates to the twenty-first century
Open up to total liberty
Let us make this our chance for a new home
The Golden Morning Dawn
Help us to raise our forsaken fatherplanet
To a greater glory once again
We take in our hands our future fate
Year two thousand - We enter Contra State!

The splendour of the risen star
We behold it from afar
And turn the page of another age
No longer bound and caged

On this earth of guns and graves
Wild flowers grow again!

Aeons of mental human evolution
Brought us conclusion
We know our lives won't end now
We just learned to grow

From the dark comes a shining light
Is our new star's spark!
For now and forevermore
Heavently wisdom leads us all
The state of grace on earth
Is the end to all our search
We have nothing to fear
When the year two thounsand is here!
