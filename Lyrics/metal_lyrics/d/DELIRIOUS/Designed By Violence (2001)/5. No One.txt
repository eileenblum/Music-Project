Vicious dreams
Days in march
The rain begins to fall
Every night and day
No one stops the rain of pain

Suffocation
In these times
The scenery of horror
Hour for hour day by day
In god's name people die!!!

To rise from the ashes
Infected breeding ground
The values of humanity
To justify the ending of life

No one
No one cares who lives or dies
No one
No one cares who lives or dies
No one
No one cares who lives or dies

Hungry eyes
Only rain no sun
To wear to an end
You are the controller of human lives
Water stormed from side to side
No time for ignorance
It's like a holocaust

Salvation here it comes again
The people are all shocked with fright
Nobody can ehar their scream and shout
Survivors turn to cannibals
M O S A M B I K
The devil sea!!!!!
