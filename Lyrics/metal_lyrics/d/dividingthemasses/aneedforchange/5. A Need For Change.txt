dont be afraid to live the life you deserve
we're all here with a purpose
i've been down to the depths
given up on love, given up on life
but it's times like these that have shown
true character can be found in even the most lost of souls
i was heartless. lustfull. losing faith
i turned my back on the things that i held dearest
and looking back on it now,
that was never me to begin with,
just the walls i'd built around my shell
personal demons will destroy you from the inside
i saw a side of me that i'd never seen before
but now i'm seeing how much more powerful love can be,
when it overcomes all the hate
dont let your selfishness tear you apart
trust me, i've been down that road before.
it took the love of my life to show me the light
and now i'll never look away
a new me is what you'll see
as a new beginning unfolds
everyone has demons they hold in their past
it's what we do to grow from our mistakes
that show who we really are
it's time to say goodbye
i'm leaving them behind
