how can you live with yourself knowing what you've done?
what drives a man to hurt his only sister?
she already lost her mother and now you're throwing away everything she had built
we all are searching for closure, but you're doing it in all the wrong ways
i have seen our family fall apart
now tell me, would grandma be proud?
it's been a year since she has passed
and not a day goes by that it doesnt hurt to face the fact
that she is never coming back
open your eyes, the search is over. you'll see that you're all to blame
just admit it, you've been consumed by your guilt
you took her life, took it for granted. now this is what you deserve

consumed by guilt
things will never be the same
