all i wanted was to be your escape,
but my presence was never enough
to match the burden you created,
or all the times you'd been mistreated
abuse made its way down the family tree,
and you were the youngest of three

who am i to talk of hardship when i don't know the half of what you've felt?
who am i to console your suffering when my own worst enemy is me?

all i wanted was to be your escape,
but some wounds will never heal
there is no easy way out
when the walls around your mind reveal an empty shell

i refuse to just sit back and let your name fade away,
as if you were successful in taking your life that day
with every word withheld,
and every uncherished moment filled,
i have become the worst enemy of myself

abuse made its way down the family tree,
and you were the youngest of three
