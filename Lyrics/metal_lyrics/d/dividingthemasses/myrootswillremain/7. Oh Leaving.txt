just like whole hearted pursuits leading to severed ends,
some things when broken will never mend

there is a solemn feeling of acceptance,
it rolls in with the changing of seasons
and the passing of time erodes away my mind
until i can't see with my own two eyes
but it's not a vision we strive for
more so a level of contentness
in realizing that we aren't where we wanted to be
and never were in the first place

i was blinded by the thought that a lust built love
meant something more than the passing of time
reminiscence shows only occasional true colors,
we see what our hearts choose to feel was real

all the while your face has been forever haunting,
in every snowbank, as our leaves turn over
but this world was never meant for you and i,
so after a year spent cold, i left it all behind.
