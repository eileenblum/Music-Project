after digging every last bit of myself into this town
i know that the community i built will live on no matter the distance
it was always us against the world
we swore we'd never change,
we swore we'd always feel the same
but each year it gets harder to keep from going our separate ways
as we are carried away by the dreams we aspire
embracing change can be difficult
when my attachable heart can never let things go

the hardest part of leaving is knowing my roots will remain
dug deep into everything i once took for granted,
the place i used to call home
i never really knew what it was i was leaving behind,
until i found myself lost in another life

i believe there is something to be said about where i've been
i will continue to give everything i have
to those who stand by me with every season's end
true friends share scars until they die
