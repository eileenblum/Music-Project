there is a message that rings in my ear
from voices built by fear
condemning hell while refuting the existence of a God
preaching acceptance while spewing hypocrisy
where is the hope that once rang so prevalently?
kids these days are saying that they'd rather be dead
existing under a cloud of regret
darkness is a comfortable shelter
but it is no place to call home
we all are broken, eager to just wither away
but there is more to life,
there is more to life than death

twelve months ago i lost myself
buried somewhere beneath this Midwest soil
but it takes more than one to raise the dead
apathy has no place in the heart of a man
