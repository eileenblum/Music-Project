what good is this voice if my words are never enough?
have my actions done their part to bury all the guilt?
i chose to live the good life,
and i'll wear it across my chest
because a life struggling for passion is a misguided ship

i still am no godsend,
but i know i'm better than this
i may never be fixed,
but i know i'm better than this

are my words empty?
or can you feel my pulse?
