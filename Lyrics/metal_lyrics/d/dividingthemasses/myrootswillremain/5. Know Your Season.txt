i'd like to say that you were everything that i needed this winter
it's just i've grown so weary of the time lost, we dissolve
as i found comfort in nothing
sleepless December left me to wonder
how i had fallen down to the rhythm of losing you
yet i could still seek comfort in finding you

i don't think you realize the way your absent face plagued me this past year
it took me all this time to realize that i had everything that i needed right here
no longer will i drown myself in the cold,
attempting to feel less alone
by filling my nights with empty pursuits and empty apologies

if you had never left, i would have never known where to call my home
i would have never seen all that this place means to me
i know you know what it feels like to be broken,
because i put you through hell to cope with you leaving
i know you know what it feels like to be broken,
because sometimes love isn't enough.
