my words are anchors, they hold me back
my words are anchors, and i'm easily attached
they teach me every day how much i've failed to progress
i try to live my life in reverie
but those thoughts will never set me free

my childhood dreams cover these sidewalks in chalk
will they ever be reached? 
or will the rain just wash them away?
time keeps disappearing as i lose my youth
every dream ends with a promise
a promise of something greater than this 
whispers of the past have traced an outline in my flesh
but theres nothing left to show
from the burden left around my neck

i just cant let my life be forgotten

if i can make it through these days of longing,
then i'll learn to sing a song of hope
but sentiment is all i have to remind me
that i was meant for more than this
