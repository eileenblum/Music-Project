sometimes i lie in bed and pretend i can control my dreams
i try to fake reality, but my conscience reminds me that you were never mine
love let me go, and this is what we've become

now i wont hold my breath for a reason to give you praise
i never knew how i'd get myself over this
the way your lips spoke as they pressed against mine
was so much more than a whisper in my ear

the coming fall air will be my best reminder
that what lies in the past was never meant to last
we were never meant to last

i opened my world up to embrace what we'll never know
and with all my hopes and dreams beating within you,
you just walked away
but even with the lungs you stole from my chest,
i found a way to breathe without you
