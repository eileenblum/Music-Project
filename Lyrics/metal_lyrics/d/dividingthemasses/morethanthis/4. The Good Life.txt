[feat. Grant of A Past Unknown]reflection,
this is my conviction

where am i drawing true inspiration?
what good are my passions if they aren't followed by action?
i know that i should be the one asking you what you stand for
like i've got it all figured out
some days it's so much easier to just hide from the guilt
i am no godsend
i am no walking saint

but they say we're supposed to be the change we wish to see
an endless search to fill our lives with purpose
i know that i have been selfish
but that's something we all can change
we all have the means to break our chains

we are supposed to be the change we wish to see,
but i get so lost in my own reflection that i forget what lies inside

what does it take to make a man?
i've made my amends
