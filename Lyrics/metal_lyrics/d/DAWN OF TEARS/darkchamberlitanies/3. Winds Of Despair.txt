Winter falls, the sun's swearing suffering
Taking dawn with promises of blood
Brings winds of despair

Staring in front of thy enemy
Meeting our fate, hearing the calm
Before the storm, before the storm

We're not afraid, adrenaline rush
Battleground is witness at last

Soon time will come, for me to know what I'm made of

I'll prove all my worth
Incoming charge of the heretics
Clashes with our blessed shields

Our Icon will lead to the final victory

Sunset rides carrying the darkness
Waiting for unhearing retreat
Fed with blood, mighty reinforcements
Awake from sleep

Falling down, weaking resistance
Exhausted resources
Seas of sweat covering
Oceans of blood

Now it's time to pay the homage
We won't resist till dawn comes

Lord hear my prayer if you are there take my soul away

I'll prove all my worth

Incoming charge of the heretics
Clashes with our blessed shields

Our Icon will lead
To the final victory

Growing woe filling our spirits
Fading out, by thy hands of black
Assamites, devils in the east
Will of win is not by our side?
