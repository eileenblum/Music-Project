Astonished by the bright of Antares
Obsidian night, auspice of wail
Crawling me to these shores of Hades
Where lovers rot in spirals of pain

An Absinthe of grace
Flaming the embrace
Fading us into the erotica
But when I wake up my inferno starts.

Downfalls o memories
She's just one shade
Floating in this bitterness
Absence of light

No, no one advise, thy satin beauty now it crushed away

Still feeling her warming caress of thy ivory skin where I used to live in?

No, heaven denies, thy promise of Eden blackening inside

Still remembering her embrace of thy
Gentle breeze what I used to dream in?

Laid on white hills fading the essence of my sweet heart
