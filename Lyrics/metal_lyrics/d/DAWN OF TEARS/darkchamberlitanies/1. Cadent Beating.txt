Beautiful agony, keeps my mind
And mortal flesh away
As the blinding selenian shine
Appears from her grave

Every breath becomes one life
And every word becomes one lie

Bondage my soul
When this wolfmoon caressing
Your pale skin of innocence falls
As I hover in your seas of scarlet, bereaved

Bondage my core
Why this lullaby ain't gonna last
Till autumn leaves falls
While I'm dreaming this moment
It's gone forevermore

You're drowning the march of time
Now in our dreamside there's nothing to hide
I wish that I could make your scars turn into mine

That's my obsequy, inside of me you will survive
Shed just one tears listening to his cadent
Beating
Requiem pire

On this eve when this obscure silence tells me goodbye
There's no consolation for thou small be damned without light

Unholy gift
When I'm touching the threshold of life which elements links
I still remember the purest breath of your lips

You drowning the march of time
Now in our dreamside there's nothing to hide
I wish that I could make your scars turn into mine

That's my obsequy, inside of me you will survive

Shed just one tears listening to this cadent beating

When the blackened maiden appears in the dark
No sign of life remains inside
