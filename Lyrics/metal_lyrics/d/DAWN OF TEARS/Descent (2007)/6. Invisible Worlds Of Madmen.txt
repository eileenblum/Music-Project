Go away from here...the madness of the mad
The priest of nowhere...can't believe that's my reality
Thoughts of destruction are all in my brain
Perceptions o' thy world isn't true or isn't real

I can see it, a world inside of this
I can see them between and inside me

I see the ghosts of mine outside my flest and
around these souls. Darkness surrounds me:
Can you see these worlds of this madmen the visions wake me down
Are all in my asylum tears are fallin' down

What is this world, a clairvoyant called mad?
Only for see a world that they couldn't see
Thoughts of destruction are all in my brain
Perceptions o' thy world, isn't true or isn't real

I can see it, a world inside of this
I can see them between and inside me
I see the ghosts of mine outside my flest, and around these souls.
Darkness surrounds me:
Can you see these worlds of this madmen the visions wake me down,
Are all in my asylum, tears are fallin' down
