Another dawn of misery
Another wasted breath
Trapped on this overcrowded purgatory

Too much I had slept
But her spellbound makes me wake up on a rotten field
No hell in the deepest of this distant lake of gray...

This moon silvered covers my hate['s] revenge
You're hiding behind the curtains of my last dream
As darkness falls Becomes an empty space
beyond my absent minded eyes

Just a twisted line lost in the verses of god's child
But now I had learn to move inside o' my mind
afraid to see beloved ones dressed in pain
No one will watch me cry again

Expire!

Too much I had slept
But her spellbound makes me wake up on a rotten field
No hell in the deepest of this distant lake of gray...

This moon silvered covers my hate['s] revenge
You're hiding behind the curtains of my last dream
As darkness falls Becomes an empty space
beyond my absent minded eyes
