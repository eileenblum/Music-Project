Come in and see the show of horror
(Time to see)
Beyond the gates of beauty Verona
(Eternal curse)
A tragedy of love, two immortal souls

In death they lay while
Brujah summon them in endless night

A cold crimson shine fall in disgrace
I must revenge,
his death can't bring back him again!

They drunk the wine of life
The twilight of a mortal soul, return!
From Death the shall reborn!

The poison that they tasted
no death at all it brings,
at night keep out the tombstone
and have the new embrace...

Whispers brooded as they comes
the new bride of the dark
they took them of their families
to give 'em their release

Welcome to the order of Brujah,
we saved you from sad destiny.
A brotherhood of blood,
you've become our members.

We've returned from the abyss
and now for evermore we'll stand still

Blood at the gates of Verona,
these necks will feed us to rest
forever and ever eternally,
their sons with their blood they'll remend

All the tears we had to cry,
Cannot pay!
All the fears we had to take,
Cannot pay!

In blood they'll lay!
Blood at the gates of Verona

A cold crimson shine fall in disgrace,
I must revenge,
his death can't bring back him again!

The drunk the wine of life
The twilight of a mortal soul, return!
From death they shall reborn!

The poison that they tasted
no death at all it brings,
at night keep out the tombstone
and have the new embrace...

Touching the life of eternal darkness,
Romeo and Juliette forever gonna stay!

In blood they'll lay!
Forever together they will gonna stay!
