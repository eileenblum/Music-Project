Fell my oath is over
My soul spreads its wings
A shroud will hide your beauty
No hope left inside me

I've traveled around the world
To reach eternal life
No signs of hope ravish my soul
I'll kiss the wind goodbye

I've persecuted the legends
Across Carpathian crests
Inside of rare old temples
They've lost their ancient [illegible]

Rumours of Tezimisces
Guides me to the old Prague
No rests of the vampires
Only tales and crazy fables

I can feel the pain
You won't see the life again
I wish to hear the echoes of eternal life

In my desperation the rope covers my neck
In my desolation the noose slips away

("Resting in my comma I can't feel anything
don't where am I there'll [be] no
more awakening")

The void will turn my soul to none[nothing?]
I feel you're dead inside my soul
There'll be no more sun in our eyes
I [haven't?] found the eternal life

In my darkest hour shadow took [illegible]
With a cold kiss she [fled?] me

Now you've chosen darkness I'll give you a new life
come with me I'll show you the wonder without sun

On that eve of full moon a dark angel gave to me
The gift of [eternal?] youth smiles my destiny

(New embraced...)

Finally is over the gift inside o' me
I haven't found it but it has found me

("You don't know the price of this you'll be my servant now
I ignore who is your bride but now I'm the only one")

The void will turn my soul to none
I feel you're you're dead inside my soul
There'll be no more sun in our eyes
