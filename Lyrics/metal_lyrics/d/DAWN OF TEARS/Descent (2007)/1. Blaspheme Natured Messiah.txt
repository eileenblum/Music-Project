So deep inside me, corrupts my soul
deep in the graveyard where he was born/one
spill the abyssal breath of the chosen one
I'm just a child after all

I hear .... that
Awake weak? from clarity
Through aeons of time arise

Fallen angels surrounding me
And brings me insanity
Too blind to see It's by my side

Why this damnation has been summoned in my room
Ending my entrails
The blaspheme natured messiah
I hear this spell? from beyond

Can you predict this blustery end
The enslavement come closer
Onto me!

Sorcerer holds the sign of the cross
Obscenity, cruelty and sodomy, twisting my mind

Lines of bastard, Christ obeys you
Blessing on me!

The father of (lies) sin!
Blaspheme natured messiah!
(I hear your calls)

Why this damnation has been summoned in my room
Ending my entrails
the blaspheme natured messiah
I hear his growl from beyond

I hear a voice that whispers
Awakes me from clarity
Through aeons of time arise

Fallen angels surrounding me
And brings me insanity
Can't you see it's by my side

... predict this blustery end
the enslavement come closer
