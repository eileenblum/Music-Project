Disheartened shadows of dreams that enslaves me
They bring me a new mourning full of chill I can't conceal

Who cares about
poisoned minds and shattered hearts
while the cold breeze of time
that heals the wounds leaves me behind

Crouch in the garden of tortured souls
I'm waiting for you
(Infected broken hope)

It takes my time
Seduce my inner shine [shrine?]
So many seas of misery

But I betrayed the crimson stars
One second behind
I will be where
The crucified collides the sky
One second behind

I kept my memories dying
On a muddy graved shape cage [grammar]
Beware the razorblade kiss

"Innocence turns into hate I fall into [oblivion's] well
Take my hand get calm and rest
Don't miss the rain cause she's back again...

I feed my senses with the venom of unspoken words

Walk in desperation fields!

But I betrayed the crimson stars
One second behind
I will be where
The crucified collides the sky
One second behind
