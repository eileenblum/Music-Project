I can't resist more
I can't stop it
I can't control it
No!

I can't stop this bleeding
The hurt is in my chest
I can't this bleeding
Wishing my [early?] death

I'm bleeding away!

This is my bleeding ulcer
Pain my body cell
This is my bleeding ulcer
Love don't forgive

Feel the sorrow in my empty veins, inside of me
(Show me the way)
See my scars I'm bleeding
Away again...
(Don't have regrets)

I can't control it anymore!
My life is missing now!
My soul is praying for the life!

Can you take me apart
Of these hands of doom
I want to choose now if
My life's open, my heart in siege!

Bleeding away!
My heart again!
Bleeds for this pain!
