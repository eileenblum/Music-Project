I suddenly awake in darkness
My brain is crushed,
Can't hear the beat of my heart
My throat is trying to shout in vain
I look around the ground
My grave are those leaves

Where is my soul?
Where am I?
I long for the life
I need a hope
(An) illusion
I'm lost in the dark

I walk along
The way of horror
Realize my bones [smack?]
I'm sinking in the [illegible]
With agony and desperate cry
soon my wishes will turn to dust
I'll fade with the mourning breeze

Where is my path?
My shore?
I wait for the end
I've lost my hope
Confusion
I'm turning into [me?]

Oh, uncertain life

How I feel you in my night
Resting over my eternal peace
Forever I'll stay without heart!

Darkening veins,
No answer, no scape
I'm here in nowhere

I've lost my future dreams,
No questions, I don't breathe
Uncertain life!

Eternal suffer into the nothing...

I am worm in earth

Oh, uncertain life,
How I feel you in my sigh!

Oh, uncertain life,
How I feel you in my night
Resting over my eternal peace
Forever I'll stay without heart!

Where is my path?
My shore?
I wait for the end
I've lost my hope
Confusion
I'm turning into dust
