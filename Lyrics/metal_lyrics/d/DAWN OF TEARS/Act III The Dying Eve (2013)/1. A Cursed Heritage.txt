Searching for words to erase my sins
The stains from my soul
I walk through the silent hills covered by mist
The muse is calling me

The keeper of threshold guides to me
Invites me to come in
Dozens of answers freeing my hints
Now my quest is over indeed

Despair

Between hidden melodies
Clarity comes to an end
Fragments of silence storming my memories
Why am I condemned to forget?

Ruins I see in front of me
With life of the ancient times
Choir of unrested tunes with fear
Rise from oblivion

When the 10th verse reverbs
Requiem in silence
And the white shining petrifies myself
The final curtain I see brings to me
A cursed heritage

Last notes forgotten
Defiance my night

Helpless frustration tearing you down
No hope for your prayers
Oh, Christ
What have you done to me?

Despair

Between hidden melodies
Clarity comes to an end
Fragments of silence storming my memories
Why am I condemned to forget?

Ruins I see in front of me
With life of the ancient times
Choir of unrested tunes with fear
Rise from oblivion

When the 10th verse reverbs
Requiem in silence
And the white shining petrifies myself
The final curtain I feel brings my will
A cursed heritage
