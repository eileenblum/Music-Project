Falling along cloudy walls
A dizzy dive through hazy fumes
Along the perfect body
Of dreamless clean white sheets

Falling like breaking adrift
Going with the tide where mortals can't swim
Along the perfect forms
Of empty peaceful shores

Falling from pedestal
From domain of searing hours
Falling down slippery stairs
Into the lush nothingness

I hear from this cavity
The world screaming without me
And I'm falling, falling
Deep down inside of me
