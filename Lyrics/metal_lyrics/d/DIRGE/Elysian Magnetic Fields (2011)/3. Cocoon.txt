Sheets like shrouds
Veils and curtains wrap the orphans
Silent clouds
Lost in closed-eyed crown

Ebb and flow
The sound of the rain is an echo 
That weeps diluvian tears
On pristine white snow

Lashing storm
Outside thuds weave
Voiceless laments
And blister moons, triumphant
