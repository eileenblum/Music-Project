Shut eyes are haunted cells
Sharpen lids rip the shell
Release ghosts unto light
Switchblade fear bleeding dry

Obsidian recalls your beasts
Those hounds breaking into my sleep
Obsidian, will you give me
A missing part, an effigy

So would you come tonight?
There's room enough in these dreams
But would you leave at dawn?
There's no place for you in this realm

But night is a dagger
A knife held by many hands
A barrel aimed, a loaded gun
And hundred tongues licking the trigger
