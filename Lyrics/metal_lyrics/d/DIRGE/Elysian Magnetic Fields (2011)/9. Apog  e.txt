The light extends
Wings outstretched 
Climbs within then shines
Forth from depths

Thousand hands
Slice the electric air
Catch my fists
Lift me up along dazzling glare
Dust storm flows
Through sandman's claws
Body, hovering
Into deep black stream

These giddy stairs
Twist and turn
Stroke the moon
As stars crash and burn

Raise me up
Higher and higher
From this glass cage
To the promise of slumber

Sandstorm blows
Around the gallows
The cage is in pieces
Shards of smothered screams
Scars of amber gleams
And light is growing dim

And light is growing dim
