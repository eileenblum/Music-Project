Strobbing stars light the way to you
Sparkling blades ripped your heart in two
Scattered all along your wound
Throbbing hums turning round and round
Motherchaos release me

Crippled angel, where have you been?
So much void, so much things
Is this life you gave me?
All those shapes I cannot see
I try to breathe, I have to learn
'Cause I know, into you I won't return

Smell the heady scent of rust
Frozen glare trapped inside
She was the night spitting dusk
Made of silk, made of dust
A million suns never set
These molecular threats
Pulsing fear, lurking eye
Motherchaos, one last time

Womb - is where all things must cease
Womb - peaceful home, never found
Womb - is where all things shall cease
Womb - is where all things have ceased
