How tall shall I grow?
How deep
Must I fall?
Grains of sand
Overflow
North in all
Nothing in all
The great in the small

Scary glimpse of infinite
Fear breeds fear, stretching slit
Aching breath pours sanity
Seconds as centuries
Hear the creaking of the wheel
Inside me, quite unreal
I make it spin, I make it scream
Screams like sirens
Screams like winds
Like sirens, like winds
All means suffering
Watching that Halo growing dim
In the flicker of their wings
Deafening is the pain
Pain as far as the eye can reach
Stabbing the sky from dusk to dawn
Waiting for stars to hit the ground
Waiting for the Sun to heal my wound
Sharp lines entwined, glowing thoughts
Grab my brain, clutch my throat
Push me close to a giddy void
Whirling swarms and deadly thrills
Poisoned feathers making spin
Making scream The Birdies Wheel
