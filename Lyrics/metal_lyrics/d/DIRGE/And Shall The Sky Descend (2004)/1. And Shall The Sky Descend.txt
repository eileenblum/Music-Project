We've all failed to find the bliss
Moon and sun bend into eclipse
Blazing crescents, crooked crosses
Banners hoisted by iron fists
Concrete plains and headless trunks
We've built here our horizon
A billion wombs feeding tombs
Sowing hate for one more...

WAR
WHILE
WALLS
RISE

And shall the sky descend
To smother this immense cry
And shall the sky descend
To give Earth silence
And...

WARMTH
WHILE
WORMS
WAIL
