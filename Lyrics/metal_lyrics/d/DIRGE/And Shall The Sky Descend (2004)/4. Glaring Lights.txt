The bright arch weep on our grief
Corrosive breath
Reddish trails lick the skin
Gnawing rust
Sickness flickers all around
Poisoned wings draw rotting wounds
Burned tissues, scorched lung
Staring at a glaring sky
Standing in those blinding lights
Praying hands, fingers crossed
Wait in vain
For a brand new Christ...
