Marble clouds stretch, over there
As I try to follow
This hazy shade
This icy shade
Twisting and blurring in the distance
Footsteps, elusive, disappearing
Far away in a million directions
Anywhere, elsewhere, nowhere

But I would murder a thousand deaths
I could stop the clocks and hold my breath
To grasp you for real
To grab anything
Melting wax, cracking glass
Multiply your face in many forms
Fragments and fragments and fragments

In a tunnel of mirrors
In a corridor of sand
There's a snowblinding glare
The horizons of maud land

And I roam and I crawl
Like drifting through aeon
Through iron walls abandon
I roam and I call for you

For I linger still
In this world of emptiness
I picture your fragrance
Through the afterflesh
Wings of lead over dormant seas
Burden of feathers
You, blue seraph, vanishing
Trying to flicker as you burn
In the hands of mighty sun
Incandescent solar flares
Consuming rainbows in your hair
Until you fall, hereafter
Far, far away
Dim lily-white light
Out of sight

And within smoke, within mist
Among dead and lying trees
I lose your track
I lose my way
And now this home is a maze
With children-headed walls
Spitting cries
Spitting wails
At my face
As I howl

And I die killing time
Counting hours, watching days fall
One by one
And I die spending nights
On the paths of grief, serpentine
Waiting for glows to heal
Waiting for whispers to speak
Wishing for sleep to come
And restart everything

There is a silence where hath been no sound
There is a silence where no sound may be
There is this silence
Drumming, beating, bursting my ears

She rises, rises, higher and higher
Scratches the roof of universe
Then dives, alas, sinks in my veins
Drumming beating, breathing in my brain

This is the morphic waving endless void
A ghostly orchestra for swarms of insects
Scarabs and locusts and furies play in my chest
Drumming, beating, without rest

Can you see those devouring fires
Spreading infinity and silence, this silence
Don't you hear the immaculate wings of absence
Drumming, beating in a deafening cadence

Humming blows, fractured ground, starlight in pieces
Dying haloes all around, melting seas and shrinking spaces
And where you as the world falls apart
Drumming beating, drowning in my heart

Silence will have taken your place
When I rise towards the surface
Six walls wide and blank
When I reach the riverbank
And now everything is nothingness
And nothingness is where I stand
Just a small twinkling star
Pulsing, carved in my hand
A green iris
Staring,
Gazing,
An eye wide open, a tiny fire
Tears and embers
Rolling along in my fingers

And in every searing moonbeam
Through aching mercury dreams
In every scary nightblow
I can guess your face through the floe

But anyway...
The claws of gravity can crush me
And nail me deeply
Down to the earth
I will stay at the gate
Waiting and waiting
To slaughter and trample on
Those unlighted saints
Lying on the floor
Those beasts of prey
Those stealing whores
Those starving supernovas
Those infrablack omegas
Eating love, spitting grief
From above, from beneath
Changing children into silence
This silence
This drilling, pounding presence
Endless
Soundless
Terrifying sentence
Whirling louder and louder
This silence
As a drummer
