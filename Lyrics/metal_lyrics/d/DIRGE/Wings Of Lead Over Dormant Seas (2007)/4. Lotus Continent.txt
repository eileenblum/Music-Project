Red sands whirl around
Horizon splinters
Stellar suns, spiral dawn
Seconds and lightyears
Petals and wings unfold
Arms outstretched
We wait and watch
For dreams made flesh

No bound hands or closed eyelids to hide
Soil and clouds and men collide
Blooming body-moths take flight
Blue haloes in a tangerine light

World drowns
All fall down
Lotus glows
Pierces the earth
Cross the gates
Of universe
