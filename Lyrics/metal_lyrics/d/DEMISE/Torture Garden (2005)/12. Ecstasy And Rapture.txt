In the garden of ecstasy
By sensual touch
Like a snake
I embrace your tender points
I know all your hidden dreams
But perform is a crime

Two faces of desires
Two faces of beings

I can lose my life and destroy myths
On the edge of values
I see the meanings
Intention inside of me
Destroy my fate

I'm following my dreams
It's just loneliness
Fear screaming through my body
Temptation became a target
And with my love my soul's gone

I serve you, and I don't care of nothing else
I comply in you and don't think of nothing else

Rays coming into my world
I'm burning inside like a firebird
I'm looking in evils eye and see myself
The power of your expression
Your sensitive touch is more important
Than everything, also me.
Now the universe is not the same
