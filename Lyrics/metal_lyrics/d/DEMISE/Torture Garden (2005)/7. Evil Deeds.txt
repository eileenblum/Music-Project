Love pain love
Penetraiting feelings in the devils eye
Look around through human beings
Describe your feelings and spit it out
Straight on their faces

Hate me, nad want me to kill
Love me, and want me to kiss

Ignore me, and piss on my face
Trust me, and give me your hand

Once again I participate
In this masquerade
Sweetly smiles, gentle gestures
Apparently love, apparently friendship

Hate me, nad want me to kill
Love me, and want me to kiss

Hidden feelings create a sick
Infect all contemporary world
Provoke a war, provoke a death
We loosing control...
Cheerful group of friends
Rotten stinking, and sick like a hell...
