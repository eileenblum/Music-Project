Remains of yesterday
Looking through times which pass
I'm trying to reach my memory
As deep as I can
I hear and see fly fairest remembrances
Independent wriring inside of me

Deep in me - only my thoughts
Deep in me - just my desires

The reality lost its meaning
I just know the secrets of my sins
Everything I did and what I stopped to do

Deep in me - only my thoughts
Deep in me - just my desires

Events went one after another
They're following me, step by step
And I try to escape but every next trail
Mission abandoned

Remains of yesterday
Tomorrow will not be the same
I see through times
I can not stop

Deep in me - only my thoughts
Deep in me - just my desires
