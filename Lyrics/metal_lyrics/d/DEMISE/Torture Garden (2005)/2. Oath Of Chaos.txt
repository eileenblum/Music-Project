Somewhere in the deepest space
Oath of chaos was appear
I said ti us in a digital way
Cancelled all synthetic rules
Showed us a different way
To go...

Chaos... Chaos...

We worship this oath
And become so strong
We feel the force
The force from the space

Different point of view
Means misunderstood
It's hard to go out of this circle
The truth is so hard to understand
But we can't stop it
The show must go on

We think about escape
Escape into digital world
Then into chaos
We can create
Our own world and rules

Chaos... Chaos.

Clear like a tear
Now I can stop to cry
