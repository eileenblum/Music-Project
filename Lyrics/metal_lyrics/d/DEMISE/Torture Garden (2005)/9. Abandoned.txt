To see the truth is to see the lies
False hope from the blasphemous one
Who invades of minds
Who invades of minds.

The original sin that has plagued us all
Throughout time
We know this well
We paid the price for your sin
Oh holy one you say
That yours is the only way
But hell on earth has it been today

Sorrow and pain throughout the years
My conviction of justice is my reward
For you abandoned me
When I failed

I have risen above it all
To take my place upon the wall
Beside the ones
Before me, I will not fail

To seek the truth of truths
And I will not fail
To gain riches and fame, I do not care
Tell everyone, everyone...
