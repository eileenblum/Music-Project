Humans will and have
Ravaged the earth
Now and forever
Looking for rebirth
Man knows no limits
What have they done?!

Only the creatures will suffer
On this dark day
To us they say
It will be too soon
When it all goes away...

The fields of joy have all been destroyed
The greed of man has killed them indeed.

No more is the dove
Or the fish in the stream
Oil and ashes
Cover everything...

When man think
They can take away life
From the forests
That keep us at night
And the wind thath lets us breathe
And take flight

It all could have beedn changed in a second
If they listened to the prohets of old
Who warned us what would happen...
