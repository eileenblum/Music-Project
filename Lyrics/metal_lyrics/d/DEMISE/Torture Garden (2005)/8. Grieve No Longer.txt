The Masses gather for another look
At the one who lays in the crypt
His eyes are closed
His arms are crossed

Never again...
Never again...
To walk this earth...
To walk this earth...

His worth was known
To all mankind
Things he did
And all to soon
He met with death
Before the rising of the moon...

Grieve no longer
He would have said
To all the people around his grave
I'll be waiting for all of you
On the other side from you I cannot hide.
