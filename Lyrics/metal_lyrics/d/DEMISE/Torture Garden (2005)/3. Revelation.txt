Through lies
The revelation is coming
Ancient orders crossing their ways
Celebrating the truth which I create
Delve in secrets of their sick thoughts.

Waiting for glory...
I create the universe

They worship and are bowing to me
I need human things
And they will do it for me.
Blinders and no ears
Beings with no soul

Revelation like a divine touch
Wonderful material for orders to make
Unconscious of their deeds and convictions
Escaping the fear
They...

Waiting for glory
I create the universe

They worship and are bowing to me
I need human things
And they will do it for me.
Blinders and no ears

The Revelation is coming
Night became day and continue into infinity.
