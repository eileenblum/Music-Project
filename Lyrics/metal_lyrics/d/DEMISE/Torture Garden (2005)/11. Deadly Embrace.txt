In the darkness, above us there are sleepers
I saw your arm
Stretched towards the strong
Bloody hand, which on earth
Has put your heavy sword

His arm, bent in a deadly embrace
I see it here before my eyes
The hand had been cut off

The brightness is reaching to the horizon
And beow Precipice is opening her eyes
Like a pyramid upside down

His arm, bent in a deadly embrace
I see it here before my eyes
The hand had been cut off

In these lights
Like ghosts or shadows
Are hunters, moving about hastily
The nights gone away
Her silence as well
I am drawing aside
The silver starry veil.
