In thy garden of torture and pain..
I wait in silence
For thee my God
Only for you
I reveal my sorrow
For us, there is no tomorrow..

The earth in ashes
And through my tears
I see nothig...

For it is
To you I descend my arms
Open from you
I can depend on eternal suffering
World without end
Everlasting pain
To me you have gave

The earth in ashes
And through my tears
I see nothing...

In thy garden of torture and pain
I wait, no longer in silence
For you, I am what you are
Unholy one too
For you Are I

The dark moon rises night after night
