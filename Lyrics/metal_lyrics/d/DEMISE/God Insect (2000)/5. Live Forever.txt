The light dazzling eyes
Drives a knife into your heart
Wants to learn humility
Or to kill as Kain killed Able
Could it do it?
Throw brightness on my grave
It couldn't, we couldn't
In your eyes I can't see a life
So close your eyes
And you wake up again
The elements braided by love,
That's sfairos
Wonderful compilation
They whisper, they can whisper
Still exist, don't be an object
Not like a dust in universe
Imperfection in itself
Unity without harmony
Which never was born from reality
The wonderful pain to feel,
To know the truth of distance
Live forever
