More I whisper, less hope I have
Knowing the pain of the truth
Everything in an evil's kingdom
I wish to be important on the way to affect
Genius destiny, which betrays itself
Extent of contrasts in valuable system
Inefficiently and out of date
The end of century, the end of humanity
It isn't known what is after millenium step
Perhaps I get back a freedom which I have lost
Passions of my soul will get alive
Not to be fool, it's difficult to many
In the beauty of mountain peaks they find themselves
I will open the gate of unpure era
Balancing on the edge of evil
With a double-handed sword
I cut myself from the past
