Sometimes I feel that I fall down
Sometimes I drop myself to be closer a death
Hundred clocks strike me without synchronisation
It isn't know which is right
I look for a prompt at my ugly dwarf
I wanna learn a human being
Which is unwere delusion
Effects brain and forms a picture
Fundamental symbol - six great circles
Seeing a fire - I leave
Feeling extreme perception - I leave
Hwen you wake up - you see
When you go asleep - you dream
When you see over the head - you feel a fear
Because inside you exist genetic base of falsehood
