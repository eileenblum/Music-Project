Tears are blazing as torches
Intertwining completely
Everything what is create
The world is burning and on its remains
Will rise a new unwanted material
Don't help me
Don't pull your hand out
A cold as a crystal and so indifferently
Dreams are drowned, this fair and pure
You are waiting for my end "novissima verba"
But you will hear anything,
My lips are close
I'm quite, but my thoughts are swearing
Flouncing in dark, I can't reach a breath
I hear freighting scream, I laugh at it
I have my own world in which I'm a master
