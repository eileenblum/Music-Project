Every alive creature I call a machine
This is perfection of nature
Perfection adjustment and indestructibility
The Cybernetics comes across my mind
God's finger - alien's finger
Plurality of assumptions aren't important
A free will and creation
Is this uncommon?
Mind is unusual being
Why a few percent, not more?
There were some more excellent
That's why called them gods
Through ignorance - murders
Through foulness - fear
Illumination doesn't exist
How many strangers - gods are among us?
