Blindness is in my mind
Powerful words are turning around reality
In my head chances come from a back
Santify love found its way
I still burn in your flames
Another day
They sun didn't rise again
Next time avoided my infinity cry
Suicide opened its destructive wings
Still dancing in your flames
I whisper calmly something again
My hurt lips, don't let me talk louder
Despite sucking blood from them
Sticking atoms together
I take away anger with a mechanical move
I ask why and what for?
Identifying a night with emptiness
I create changeable system:
A darkness
