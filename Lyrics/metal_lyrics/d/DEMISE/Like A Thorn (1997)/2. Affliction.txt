One body, one brain, one mind
Thousands of uncoordinated questions
Pervent thoughts crushing with a parabolic smile
Are getting inside with inexplicable power
Conditions of consciousness
Connected with a love embrace of scoffing paranoia
Never stopping downpour from the clouds of stagnation
White air is burning in indefinity figures
These figures are desirous
In the unreal liquid time provoke
Provoke the senses
Provoke me, you and him
Provoke to die
The fruit of affliction has grown ripe
The tear has flown...
