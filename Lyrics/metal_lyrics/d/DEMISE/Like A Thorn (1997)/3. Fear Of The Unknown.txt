I don't want to listen, understand and doubt no more
Imagination of shape has ripened in totality
I won't be passive but I will try to be active
Maybe I will fall asleep waking a destination
I close myself and go down in lethargy
I take leave of remembrances, they would be superfluous
I go away further and further
Feel I will not come back
Don't know where, I'm alone
I'm afraid I don't know what I will meet on my way
But fear of the unknown is something natural
Lightness, blissful rupture of flowe smell
Makes me serene and I feel closer
Transformation that I was undergoing
Persisting without my knowledge will consent
I became an infant, defenceless, crying
Destiny was with me, I was receiver
I stay with myself far away, no one else
I'm not subject to the law and to anyone either
Sky blue of thoughts suggests of this
I'm standing numbed and I don't know
Who I am
