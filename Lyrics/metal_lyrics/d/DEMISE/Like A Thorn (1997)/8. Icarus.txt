Many times I wanted to surrender to fulfilment
To accept a really different feelings
Shyness and hostility were a barrier
They were holding me in claws, I tried set myself free
I've made it at the end but results of slavery
Made my body and mind mad
Torn structure was still alive
And did everything to finish its mission
There were raging wings and storms in my soul
I was uneasy, fouled and angry
The inside was not visible through my eyes
It was grey and I didn't see anything
I decided to jump to feel it for at least a while
Fly like an Icarus but without the wings, go down
I knew what's gonna be when I reach the ground
The while was important, not the consequences
