In the bustle of fears and passion, flood of words
In the crowd of human's emotions, I'm lost without edges
I don't know my onw place... and scream
Awakened at night, I got hurt with the day
I didn't know where I was and then I hid
But suddenly I stopped and understood my thoughts
Being stupor but real, alive
From now I was painting my life as I wanted
I directed every important events
It was pleasant, laugher at their failures
Got me inside a tunnel without exit
I didn't want anything from that moment
Pride and satisfaction pierced my body
Like a thorn, signed with the will of existence
I was walking up and down my cage, locked from the outside
I wanted to keep on blowing my flame
Being in candles of people undesired
The light went out and with this flame my hopes and desires
