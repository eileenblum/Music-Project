Everyday the dreamers die
To see what is on the other side 
Now it's time for your fate 
Plant a demon seed 
You rise a flower of fire
See the burning crosses
See the flames, and higher
I'm free to fly the crimson sky
The sun won't melt my wings, tonight 
Do you see the light? 
It's the chance of life-time
Our future won't see the light of the day 
I feel the fire but I want more 
I feel the healding, the sweet sin 
But bitter the taste in my mouth 
I want to feel sunlight on my face 
I scorch the earth, set fire to sky 
Stop so low reach so high... 
I've spoken the tongue of angels 
I've held the hand of the devil 
I've dreamt a dream about the sun
I took the poison from the poison stream
