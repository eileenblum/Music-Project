In the empty corners of existance 
In the unreal world 
On the edge of life and death 
Last time you look at the sky 
Your life contained in the moment 
Which will never come back 
It prompts you what you lose 
And what you profit 
Oblivion
Your anguish, your nightmare 
Unreal hopes goes away 
Into oblivion, for eternity 
You made a decision 
And threw illusions away
Your life retires, death is nearer 
You got rid of a burden 
The world became so large
His mother cries waiting for son 
Who will never come back 
She retires into oblivion 
And follows the same way
