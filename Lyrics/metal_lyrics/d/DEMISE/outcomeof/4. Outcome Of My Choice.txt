Impurity of the mind, numbness
Decision not made, reflections 
Good or evil? Fight or surrender? 
Direction follows which will go my shape 
Passing over. unimportant events 
Reaching for the heart 
Of the problem hesitation is quite sure 
Which side to take, which way to go 
One decision, problem
Confusion, necessary suffering or happiness 
The point I'm surely stuck at 
Will I stay here forever 
Everything is the outcome of my choice 
The pain I'll feel, the pain I'll cause 
Shall I think about myself or others too? 
I'll find out, that's for sure 
If my decision turns out to be wrong 
Emptiness around me, nothing can be seen 
Everything is the outcome of my choice
I could have escaped that, do a different thing 
Make another decision, not the wrong one
