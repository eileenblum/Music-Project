Another generation of eternal circle 
Which persist in hope 
Of better tomorrow 
On the edge of centuries 
It came to the point 
Of final clearance with the past 
The day of fight, cry and blood 
The day without illusions 
Without the mother's breast 
The beginning of the end 
Somebody said that he will be 
The last man with blood and bones 
Who will cry for the future 
Who will dance with death
The answer to the question is only one 
It sticks inside, in feelings 
Every word, motion and deed 
Let's them lead the heart
