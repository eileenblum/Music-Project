If everyone is put on this world for a reason
Then why do I feel so fucking worthless

I stay awake hoping that you'll be fine
I can't sleep at night, with you on my mind
Your world is falling at your feet
And I can't seem to save you

I'm off to hear the stories of the ones who couldn't stand
I'm off to watch the water sinking slowly in the sand

You know you're a failure, âcause you have failed yourself
You have failed yourself

If everyone is put on this world for a reason
Then why do I feel so fucking worthless

You're nothing but a 6 out of 10.
