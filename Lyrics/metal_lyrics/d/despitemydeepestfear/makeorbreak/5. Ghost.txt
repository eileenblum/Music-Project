Insecure and underrated
We are not hopeless, we are just broken
So come back from this nightmare you're living

And I have seen it before, the reason why you walked out
And I'm led to believe that you've seen the worst in me
So save yourself

I've seen the lowest point of life
One day you'll see my ghost
Everything that you have ever said
Makes me wonder was it worth it in the end

But they're sealing the doors
Now I can't come home, I can't show them all
But they're sealing the doors, I can't show them all
Who we are meant to be

Let me love again

And I have seen it before, the reason why you walked out
And I'm led to believe that you've seen the worst of me
So save yourself

We're all looking for love in the wrong places
Searching for the one who clearly isn't there
When you lay in bed at night I hope you dream of me

You said you want it
You said you want it

Insecure and underrated
We are not hopeless, we are just broken
So come back from this nightmare you're living

Let me love again

And I have seen it before, the reason why you walked out
And I'm led to believe that you've seen the worst of me
So save yourself

You said you wanted it all
You said you want it
You said you wanted it all.
