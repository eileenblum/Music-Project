You always listen to the ones who have fallen
I will not be a victim to their lies
We all know that you can't be trusted
But I will not give up hope in you
I've had to pick up the pieces before
Now I need you, I can't be alone

I cannot be alone, alone

Another day just passes by me
I've given up caring, I'll be on my own
So I'll just sit and watch the world fly by me
I need someone to tell me to keep it calm

I've heard it all before, you're a devil behind closed doors
I am the sinner, I am the voice of the weak
You're playing with fire, you're swimming with sharks
You are swimming with fucking sharks

Listen to me, open your eyes, you will see what I see
It's not the way you wanted this to be

You're playing with fire, you're swimming with sharks
You are swimming with fucking sharks

Listen to me, open your eyes, you will see what I see
It's not the way you wanted this to be
I watched the fires burn, I drained the sea
Wash it all away with me and start again.
