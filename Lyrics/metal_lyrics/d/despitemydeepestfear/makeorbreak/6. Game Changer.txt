The figures that guide me have fallen apart
With nothing to follow my head is so hollow
How am I meant to be free
When these chains are dragging on my feet
Bounding me to the bottom of the sea
I'm starting to believe I'm the one who walked away

You know this attraction is fake
When the arms around you are filled with hate
I've watched your sky fall down upon you so many times

Now everything in this world is dead
I'm holding on to something I'll regret

And now I can see you for who you are
Someone that drowns me out
So when we look back on what we have
How could you leave me so helpless
Wake me up

This can't be anything we've ever wanted
You were there from the start, where are you now?

Raise me up, wake me up

Everything in this world is dead

And now I can see you for who you are
Someone that drowns me out
So when we look back on what we have
How could you leave me so helpless
Wake me up

You said you'd never leave, but you proved me wrong.
