Take a look around, your lives aren't painted gold
Nor is the ground that you walk on
So why hold your head so high?
This familiar home has become a feeding ground for insults
And your slick tongue fits in so well

I can't remember your face
I'm looking at you but there's no memory
I thought I had lost it all
But in the end you're all the same

So what's the point in living a lie when you change it day by day
You're spending all of your time wasting, just wasting it away

And we are sick of the same sights
And we are sick of being sheltered away
So put your feet on the ground
Magnify the world, come and see the shit we live in
Come and see the shit that we live in
And we are sick
And we are sick of it all
And we are sick
And we are sick of it all

So what's the point in living a lie when you change it day by day
You're spending all of your time wasting, just wasting it away

And we are sick of the same sights
And we are sick of being sheltered away
So put your feet on the ground
Magnify the world, come and see the shit we live in
Come and see the shit that we live in.
