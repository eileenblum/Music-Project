Desperation's weight beares down
Discovering the faith of a soul I've denounced
Left confound when aspirations are shattered
Inward in doubt

Divide and conquer
Contentions waged, this climb engaged
Defined by trial
When called to arms, only the strong survive

Desperation's end is now
An extrication from demons I have renounced
This I vow
Never surrender or break in the face of defeat

Divide and conquer
Contentions waged, this climb engaged
Defined by trial
Only the strong survive

Impossibility is fading
Sky is open finally
We've been waiting so long
Oh, we've been waiting so long
So shall I learn from experience
Forever as long as live endures

Give me conviction
With every breath
Constraint suppression
Now until death

Impossibility is fading
Sky is open finally
We've been waiting so long
Oh, we've been waiting so long
So shall I learn from experience
Forever as long as live endures
