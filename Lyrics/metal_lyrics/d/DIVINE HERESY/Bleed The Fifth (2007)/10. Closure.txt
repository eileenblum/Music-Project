All these memories
Distorted, confused, unaborted
You're discarding
As a product of
Circumstance granted existence
Bestowed to me

Give me closure
Searching for solace
Closure - am I still lost?

And so you've forgotten me
The boy devoid of your nursery
For these lifetimes gone by
I can't help question why
Through the years denied this

Give me closure
Searching for solace
Closure - am I still lost?

Tears gone uncried
Torrid inside
And no face to relate to names to reply
Especially when the memories
Cut like a knife
Left with just pages to which I confide

Give me closure
Searching for solace
Closure - am I still lost?
