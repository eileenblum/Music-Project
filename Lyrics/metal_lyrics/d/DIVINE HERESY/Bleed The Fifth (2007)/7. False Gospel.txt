An incantation speelbound to disease
A petrified existence on your knees

And I felt you slipping away
I felt you slipping away more everyday

You pray for a savior
Your cries fall on deaf ears
False gospels enraptured
This worshipping of thieves

A railroad crossing confined to the tracks
An intersection with no turning back

And I felt you slipping away
I felt you slipping away more everyday

You pray for a savior
Your cries fall on deaf ears
False gospels enraptured
This worshipping of thieves

Plant a seed festering
Sprouting a stem of dependency
Snort this bliss be dismissed
From depression temporarily
No!

It starts with just a taste
For some that's all it takes

Enter me and be free
The darkness consistent
Every dosage raised heresy
Accepting christ intravenously

You pray for a savior
Your cries fall on deaf ears
False gospels enraptured
This worshipping of thieves

And I felt you slipping away...
