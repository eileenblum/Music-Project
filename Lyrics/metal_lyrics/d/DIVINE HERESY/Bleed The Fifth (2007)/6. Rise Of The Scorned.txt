Enter
Consumed within the throes of loss
The stages towards acceptance
Have never felt so far
The recollection of what was
This broken consummation
And light dividing us

Ashes and dust
Rise of the scorned
Guilt self-distructs
Rise of the scorned

No justice no peace
This echoing unseen

Enthralled with this absence
It's consuming me

And I know that this frame
Holds a picture inside me
Frail hollow from the space
Where you stood
Behold your love come undone
Far before it's time all gone

Return
To pages of the past's mistakes
In hindsight to the part of life
Endured and undertaken

No reconciliation's grace
Could ever compare
To the state of this accomplishment

Ashes and dust
Rise of the scorned
Guilt self-distructs
Rise of the scorned

No justice no peace
This echoing unseen
Enthralled with this absence
It's consuming me...
It's consuming me...
