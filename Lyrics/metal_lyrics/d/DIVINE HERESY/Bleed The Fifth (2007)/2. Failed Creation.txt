Failed creation
In all his arrogance
Revelation has prophesied retribution
A plague of suffering
Castigations
Open your fucking eyes
Open your fucking eyes
Open your fucking eyes

Seas wash us away
Wars being waged
Famine stricken cultures still enslaved
Blind to the signs
A fate we've contrived
Marching headfirst into this...

Grand damnation
The final holocaust
Casting us as one into abyss
Submerged beneath oceans of self-disgust
All forsaken
And burning for their lies
And burning for their lies
Open your fucking eyes

Seas wash us away
Wars being waged
Famine stricken cultures still enslaved
Blind to the signs
A fate we've contrived
Marching toward the...

End of time
Are we so blind to the signs?
Suffer the fate we've contrived

Descending hollow shells
Precipitation of shrapnel
Falling from the sky

Chemical gassing the terrified masses
Engulfing the world in denial

Absolution cleansing their wicked minds
Extradition for sins comprised
Penitence, man kneeling before his cross
Ask yourself where...
Where does his judgment lie?
Where does his judgment lie?
Open your fucking eyes

Seas wash us away
Wars being waged
Famine stricken cultures still enslaved
Blind to the signs
A fate we've contrived
Marching toward the...

End of time
Are we so blind to the signs?
Suffer the fate we've contrived
This time their lies
Rendering our senses so blind
Suffer this fate we've contrived
