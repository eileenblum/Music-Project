Sacrosanct scriptures
These encryptions
Used for the evil of man

The disciples con to render his sons
Evoking the fear of creator
Throughout modern times
Ancient dated lies have controlled our lives
You"re no shepherd

Royal blood heresy

Abort dissected
Taint perception
Until it's origin is lost
Struggle for power
Has devoured
The messages preached in your psalms

The disciples con to render his sons
Evoking the fear of creator
Throughout modern times
Ancient dated lies have controlled our lives
You"re no shepherd

Royal blood heresy

Onward I pray
Falling from grace into sin

Stand on your own
To see them dethroned
This tyranny I have disowned
Falsified gospels
Slain the apostles
Don't live your life as their drone

The disciples con to render his sons
Evoking the fear of creator
Throughout modern times
Ancient dated lies have controlled our lives
You"re no shepherd

Royal blood heresy
