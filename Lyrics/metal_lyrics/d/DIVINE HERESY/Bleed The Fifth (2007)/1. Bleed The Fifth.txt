Forked tongues flicker in signification
My eardrums ringing again
Poised to strike, receptive eyes comply
To shades of light

Gossip whores with retracting claws
Seek invasive social ties
Smiling face to masking disgrace
Deceit your way of life

Bleed the fifth
Face smashed fist
Bleed the fifth
Case dismissed

Fools abusing their silver spoons
Of a false entitlement
Spoiled seeds that feed from their knees
Turn their nose up, toward the world

Bastardized by celebrity
It doesn't mean a fucking thing to me
Show respect and face me
With common human decency

Bleed the fifth
Face smashed fist
Bleed the fifth
Case dismissed

Look into their eyes
They're serpents in disguise

It's time to free the sentence
Now I will make you fucking...

Bleed the fifth
Face smashed fist
Bleed the fifth
Case dismissed
