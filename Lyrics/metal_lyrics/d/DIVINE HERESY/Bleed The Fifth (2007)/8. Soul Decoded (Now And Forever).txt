Lacerate incision
Peel the skin inner-self
Tear the folds down to bone
Stripping to reveal stone

Modified now presides
Transitions of body and mind
Plant this seed well within
Roots beyond injunction

Break free
Free from your control

Sever the stem
Torn from this state of
Beckoning end
Reinventing all

Once come undone in me
To set my essence
Free of your control
Squeezing blood from stone
Repression undone
Now and forever

Remerge - second birth
Free of this chrysalis
Shedding skin, spread new wings
Complete metamorphosis

Break free
Free from your control

Sever the stem
Torn from this state of
Beckoning end
Reinventing all

Once come undone in me
To set my essence
Free of your control
Squeezing blood from stone
Repression undone
Now and forever

Sever the stem
Torn from this state of
Beckoning end
Reinventing all

Once come undone in me
To set my essence
Free of your control
Squeezing blood from stone
Repression undone
Now and forever
