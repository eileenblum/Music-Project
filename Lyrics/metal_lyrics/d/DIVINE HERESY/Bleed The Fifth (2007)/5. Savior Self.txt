Now that we've got your attention
All else is clear
Must step to the plate
And redefine our fate
This inception a new direction
Turning the page
All eyes are upon us
This time is for real
Make no mistake

Driven by spite
Burning to rise
And disprove all
Who would take comfort
In my demise

Conquering the sum of fears
These screams all seemed in vain
Frustration desperation met with disdain
But as passion turns to madness
Obsession reigns
For honor of this legacy
Defiant we remain

Savior self from the strife of this world
That's all that we've known
Savior self from the knife to your throat
And hold to your own

The prime objective forced to achieve
Sacrifice the present for greater future gain
To retain some validation
For the choices we have made

As well as restitution for the sacrifices made
Savior self from the strife of this world
That's all that we've known
Savior self from the knife to your throat
And hold to your own

Driven by spite
Burning to rise
And disprove all
Who would take comfort
In my demise
