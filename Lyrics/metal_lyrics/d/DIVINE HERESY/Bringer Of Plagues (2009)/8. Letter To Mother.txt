You, you have entered this world with a virus
Tortured man, broken man, just a piece of filth
Devoured by your thirst and conquered by your lust
Taken by force, the victims left

Send the, letter to mother, tell how your devoured
Daughter, dismembered little girl

So
The sadomasochist
Ci
Devouring the flesh
O
You push the needles in
Path
To set this stage again

His skin upon him will bare eternal pain
Sickened man, withered man, he feels no shame
Inside his soul he mourns, the pain he has endured
Indulged in blood, they are now one

Send the, letter to mother, tell how your devoured
Daughter, dismembered little girl

So
The sadomasochist
Ci
Devouring the flesh
O
You push the needles in
Path
To set this stage again

In his sin, he found salvation

In his sin, he found salvation, innocence, means mutilation
In his sin, he found salvation, little sins, decapitation

Salvation
Mutilation
Salvation
Decapitation

So
The sadomasochist
Ci
Devouring the flesh
O
You push the needles in
Path
To set this stage again

Sociopath!
