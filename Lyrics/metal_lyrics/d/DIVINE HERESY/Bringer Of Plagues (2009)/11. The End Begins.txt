Try to prepare yourself for, annihilation
The countdown do devastate, lies, propaganda, predictions
Catastrophic, the eminent end
The blind lead the blind, they run
With nowhere to hide, can't escape death

The time has come
For man to
Be washed away

All that he knew of life will, be deceased
The countdown has come to an end, man tearing apart at the seams
Catatonic, from what is seen
Paralysed by the sight, nightmares
Materialize, the end of time

The time has come
For man to
Be washed away
The complete extinction
No one will live

The end begins
The end begins
The end begins
The end begins

In our most desperate time
There is no one to turn to

We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
We all fall down
