Sometimes I feel I'm drowning in the shallow,
The deep end is just too far for my reach
Eyes filled, with dirt, buried, in this
Shadow, maybe someone will pull me out
Pull me out

Ripping its way inside of me
Tortured the shell that confines me
Is burning, and redefining me

I try to be free away from this place,
To rise above the ruins and take a breath
Sinking under the ocean of hatred
Can I swim to the surface

Ripping its way inside of me
Tortured the shell that confines me
Is burning and redefining me

I will murder the negativity
Take back the strength that it's given to me now
I'm redefining it all

So long inside this place of solitude, I scratch the walls until my fingers are bleeding
The stains never seem to go away, no matter how much I rub they stay the same

Frail from all this place has given me, the cuts and the bruises burn like the blood stains
Crawling on the floor, slowly to the door, I try to open it up but it seems too far.

Ripping, its way inside of me
Tortured, the shell that confines me
Is burning, and redefining me

I will murder the negativity
Take back the strength that it's given to me now
I'm redefining it all

Take back
The strength that it's given to me now to
Redefine!
Take back
The strength that it's given to me now to
Redefine!
