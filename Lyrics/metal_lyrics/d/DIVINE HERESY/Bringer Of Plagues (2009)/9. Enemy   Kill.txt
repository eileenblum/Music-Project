Slay, the enemy, march through the dead
To, victory, kill off what's left
Forward, will take, this battlefield
Forward, fists raised, we shall not end here

Enemy - kill
We will show no mercy
Enemy - kill
We will show no mercy

Forged, in blasphemy, they take their stand
Eyes, set to kill, they storm this land
Forward, grounds shake, across this battlefield
Forward, death race, salvation

Left to stand in desolation all alone
All we know of life is now dead and gone
And now we face this life in dead space
With nothing to lose we stand

Doomed, this legacy, erase the past
Storm into the fire, on broken backs
Forward, war slaves, line this battlefield
Forward, to face, total extinction

Left to stand in desolation all alone
All we know of life is now dead and gone
And now we face this life in dead space
With nothing to lose we stand

Alone we face total annihilation
This time we make our stand

Enemy - kill
