In this silence, a blistering sound grows
A storm that's carried through, all of our hearts and souls
It screams rebellion, from all that holds us down
Like thunder from the clouds, this is our anthem

The night has fallen, rise up to be heard
We'll shake the fucking ground, and tear down all the walls
The screams rebellion, lift all that holds us down
Rain fire from the clouds, this is our anthem

Anarchaos, rise up to take this day, anarchaos, we will line these streets
Anarchaos, take back what once was ours, anarchaos, the end complete
Anarchaos, rise up to take this day, anarchaos, we will line these streets
Anarchaos, take back what once was ours, anarchaos, the end complete

Stand with me, walk with me
From shadows they're born to take the hands, of all the scorned, to make amends
And bring this fire, to torch their souls, ignite the light, to gain control
From shadows they're born to take the hands, of all the scorned, to make amends
And bring this fire, to torch their souls, ignite the light, to gain control

No longer silent, let your voices be heard
A roar that's carried through, all of our hearts and souls
A rebellion, no longer are we held down
The thunder from the ground, this is our anthem

Anarchaos, rise up to take this day, anarchaos, we will line these streets
Anarchaos, take back what once was ours, anarchaos, the end complete
Anarchaos, rise up to take this day, anarchaos, we will line these streets
Anarchaos, take back what once was ours, anarchaos, the end complete
