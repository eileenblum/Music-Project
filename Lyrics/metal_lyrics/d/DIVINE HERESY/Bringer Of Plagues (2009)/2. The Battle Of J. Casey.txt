I've been falling for so long now, forgotten what the ground feels like
I try so hard to be strong, but life seems so far away
Can I find a way through this, or do I lose the strength to hold on?
To hold on

As the bright lights of success fade, and the spark of glory dies
I look the shadows of failure, to understand the reasons why
I can't reach out for what's gone

Waking dreams haunt me, backward thoughts betray
Illusions of what was, cloud my mind
I can't keep the demons away

Impossible, to move forward
'cause I, I'm chained to yesterday

My visions keep me prisoner, harsh memories make me bleed
I must find the way to see beyond, the sun, to find, that which, belongs
To me, that which, makes me, stronger, that which makes me stronger

Waking dreams haunt me, backward thoughts betray
Illusions of what was, cloud my mind
I will push these demons away

Impossible, to move forward
Until I break, the chains of yesterday
