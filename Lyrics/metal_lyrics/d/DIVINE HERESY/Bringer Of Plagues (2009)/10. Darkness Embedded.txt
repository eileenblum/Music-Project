Open up the door to our room
Lined with darkness
A broken man sits and waits
As the razor separates the skin
He bleeds out the sin but the wounds heal
What was drained out grows back again

[Chorus:]
Skin so white
Pull back the porcelain to reveal the flesh
Forever, darkness
You will not make it through this night again

Stains on his hands
Left from all the poison bled within
Collecting at his feet
Drowning so far in all the regret of what was
Done, so lost in this
The soul is gone, the sacrifice

[Chorus]

Rise up from the blood that spilled
For memories of all you've lost here (the life you gave)
Rise up from the blood that spilled
For memories of a life you've left behind (the sacrifice)

[Chorus]

So rise up from the blood that
Has spilled for memories of the life you left behind
So rise up from the blood that
Has spilled for resurrection
The one you sacrificed
