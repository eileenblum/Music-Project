Conquest, given the crown, the Antichrist is born
Bring war, slay each other down, starving the whores rotting and burning them all

Sound the seven siren of doom, the fall of all we know
Reveal the seven symbols of doom, the coming prophecy

Slain for the word of god, the churches burn to the ground
Holy war, all the religions will tear each other down
Blood spills on holy land now

Sound the seven siren of doom, the fall of all we know
Reveal the seven symbols of doom

Sound the seven sirens of doom, bring revelations
Rise of seven angels of hell, bring devastation

Plagues!

Rain fire and blood, scorching the earth
Purging the lands, of all impurities

The descent of grey star to earth
Transform water to wood drought consumes us all

Darkness, cover the sun, black out the moons and stars
Endless, swallow them all, bring order to what's done
The judgement has begun

Sound the seven sirens of doom, the fall of all we know
Reveal the seven symbols of doom
Sound the seven sirens of doom, bring revelations
Rise the seven angels of hell, bring devastation

Devastation
Bringer of plagues
Bringer of plagues
