Damned!

Cut away the skin, carve into flesh
Tear into the soul, take my last breath
Under all the scars there is no one left
The man is dead and gone.

I can't explain to you, you never understand, can't open up to you, you are forever damned
I can't be one with you the blood is on my hands, I need to just forget
Just forget but I, Just forget but I can't

Drained till nothings left, an empty shell
Torn apart by this, the life that failed
I try, I try to see through all this
Darkness surrounding, this monster's burn

I can't explain to you, you never understand, can't open up to you, you are forever damned
I can't be one with you the blood is on my hands, I need to just forget but I.

Underneath this bastard filled with lies,
It's living breathing, tearing from inside

Drenched in blood, my lifeline severs, facebreaker, life taker, this is forever
Drenched in blood, my lifeline severs, facebreaker, life taker, this is forever

I can't explain to you, you never understand, can't open up to you, you are forever damned
I can't be one with you the blood is on my hands, I need to just forget but I.

Underneath this bastard filled with lies, It's living breathing, tearing from inside

Damned!
