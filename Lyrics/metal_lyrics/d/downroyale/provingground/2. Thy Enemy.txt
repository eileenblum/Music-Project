Life denied
Betrayed with your own lies

Replicate the hatred of a father now an only son
Manipulation of the words used as a smoking gun
Try pay the price for innocence judged as a guilty crime
Again the system fails us always murdering
The child survived
Without the feeling of this anger growing deep inside
Take away another feeling of dependency
Regret the day you threw away all of my dignity

Now we've lost
All of the trust in your words
Just deserves, taken from us
Tables Turn

These indications pointing to another place and time
To where the darkness faded all of my emotions died
This emptiness accompanies this destiny of mine
No peaceful death will come for you
The tables turn

Illusions confused reality
When will they become the art of thy enemy
All of my feelings are numb
Now the war is over
Liberate ourselves

Betrayal, The tables
Are turned around
I burn the crown, you and your false royalty
Time divides
Standards of our dignity
Now stand down
This throne is taken in vein

We won't betray ourselves
We won't deny you
We won't pretend your right
Trapped in denial
