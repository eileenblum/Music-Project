So fed up with this shit
The shattered mirror can't look back at itself
Your self Indulgence
And your lack of respect
So paranoid
It makes everyone a victim

We won't forgive you
Don't tell me
That you are sorry
It's not worth it

How can we waste all our time
Never a moment for ourselves to reflect
Humiliation fueled by years of regret
Ashamed, awkward and embarrassed the same

This point of view is formed by paranoid, minds
Misunderstanding how to prove your words, right
I can t escape this place
The walls around me fall

The structure crumbles
Your foundation is dust
I will prevail
I will prevail
