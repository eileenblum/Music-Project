Make up for the lack of reason
I tried to compromise
I can't forget that the shit that you fed me
Had been draped in lies

This circle is never ending
It's been broken before
I don't give a fuck anymore
I'm sick of trying

Every day is the same old shit
Don't try to judge me
Don't try to think i will never regret
There is nothing left

This circle is never ending
It's been broken before
I don't give a fuck anymore
I'm sick of trying

Now I am
In deceit
I'll break
I can't just back down
I'll break
On your knees to prey for salvation
Back down
It's set in concrete
And cast in stone

There's nothing left
Don't try to judge me
I can't just back down
