Deluded beliefs bring tragic dismay
Giving nothing but reasons and failure
These premonitions are all put to rest
Your one god has failed

Cleansing the blood
Faultless demise
Lay down, your
Weapons of choice
Pure thoughts, gone
Left you alone
I own you

There is nothing worth the blood that we've shed
For the lands that we can not control
Raping the planet we build our existence
Your fucked existence

Fuck your religion
The extinction
Of our own kind

I'm alive
I'm breathing
But I am not existing
I'm alive
I'm breathing
Show me what life's meant to be

Show me what life's meant to be
What life's meant to be

Waking up, forget dreaming
Nothing left it's all been done
Will we know the pain I'm bleeding
I'm bleeding

Fuck your religion
The extinction
Of our own kind
I'm alive
I'm breathing
But I am not existing
I'm alive
I'm breathing
Show me what life's meant to be
