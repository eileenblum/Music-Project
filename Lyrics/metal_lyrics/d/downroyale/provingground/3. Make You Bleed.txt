Burn my eyes out
For all the sins I've seen and hatred I've shown
You never meant to be my only answer
Eradication
The meaning of this life
Your suffering inside

These feelings try to haunt me
Blinded horror and torment
Broken pieces failure
They all manipulate
The gun is in your mouth with
My fingers on the trigger
Your empty soul less life will fade away in time

If you think I've forgotten
The torments weakened my mind
Don't pretend this bullet's meant to make you bleed

And now the blood has gone your body is cold
The sheet pulled over your lifeless eyes
Each time I tried
You failed me

Paint me a picture a life in submission
These guilty pleas, made with the best intention
Recreate, the meaning of deception
Plead insanity
We plead insanity

If you think I've forgotten
The torments weakened my mind
Don't pretend this bullet's meant to make you bleed

And now the blood has gone your body is cold
The sheet pulled over your eyes
Are you proud of me now
Are you proud of who I am
Why not now when I m found proving ground
Are you proud

The people we've forgotten
Have all but fallen behind
You bleed
