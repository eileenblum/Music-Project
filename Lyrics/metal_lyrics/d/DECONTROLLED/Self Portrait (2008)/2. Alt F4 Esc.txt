To find a way, to escape, to be free...

Loneliness cuts like a knife,
I can't stand this painful life,
Show me the way in the night,
Set my spirit free.

Tomorrow, I'll be forsaken,
My life cruelly taken,
My soul free from the chains,
My body free from the pain.

If this is all I am,
I'll find another way to escape, to be free,
If this is all I'll be,
I'll need another way to escape, set me free,
This is not enough,
I'll find another way to escape, to be free,
I will break my way out,
I'll find another way to escape, set me free.

Devil laughs into my face,
I know that I can't win this race,
He opens his mouth and swallows my soul,
Everything's getting out of control.

Damned to live my broken dreams,
In my mind these demonic screams,
In the mirror, that is not me,
End my life and set me free.

If this is all I am,
I'll find another way to escape, to be free!
If this is all I'll be,
I'll need another way to escape, set me free!
