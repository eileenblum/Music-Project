Well, I finally realize what meant the pictures,
Wedged deep into my mind, ever vivid,
No illusions left, they're all broken,
Feelings once lost now recreated.

No
Don't try to make this mind feel the sorrow
Now
I'll try and take this pain to history

I'm waking up, rearranging the pictures,
It's so hard to collect the pieces of broken consciousness,
Yet safe in my belief, so eager, I wait for tomorrow,
To outlive the world that forced me to murder!

No!
This time I'm staying strong, so free!
Now!
I'll try, deny this pain, this misery!

Why... I...
Why... I...

Why I had to try to die,
Someone tell me,
Why I had to try to die,
So I can be free.
