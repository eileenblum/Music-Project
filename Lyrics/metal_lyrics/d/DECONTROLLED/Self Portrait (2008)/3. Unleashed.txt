Walking down the dusty streets, I watch the concrete sky
And I know I can't escape from it, no matter how I try
Long time ago, somebody said, âOur fate lies in the starsâ
What should I say, I don't dig that shit, but sometimes I can't fight it

Always spinning in the circles, same old shit day after day
Always feeling fucking fragile, âcause every step I take betrays
Sometimes, I feel like dreaming, when I dream my life away
âCause the future rarely smiles at me, lurking like a bird of prey

I don't want to fade away like the sun into dusk
I don't want to be afraid to stand up and fight

God we never spoke much, I know I'm not a great believer
Still nothing costs to ask you just to listen up to this dreamer
I never asked a thing before, all I did, I did on my own
But now I beg you to set me free, scrape me off this misery

Or just look at all those people, simply walking down the street
Hope is long gone from their eyes and now they're dealing with their own defeat
So I write these rhymes for you, that's the only thing I can do
That's the only thing I've got left, when there's nothing left to cling to

I don't want to fade away (like the sun into dusk) like the sun into dusk
I don't want to be afraid to stand up and fight, (for life)
