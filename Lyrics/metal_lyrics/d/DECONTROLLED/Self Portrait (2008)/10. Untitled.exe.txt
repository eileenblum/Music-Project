When the world you know is grey, and grief is all you feel,
What's one supposed to do?
He walked these empty streets, no feelings lined his face,
Cruel peacefulness...

SILENCE!! PAIN! and... SORROW!!!

He tries to understand the scenes,
And day after day he fails, until, vividly clear it comes to only one way,
I'll end it now, no doubts impede my thought,

The real world around us won't forgive what we take lightly,
The sorrow that we make is so real,
We try to fight us, but we've got no way of fighting,
This perfect pain, oh, sweet ignorance.

Lay to bed at night, feeling all is well,
Satisfied with what you did today,
But what you did not do, reflects more who you are,
So tell me, are you really satisfied?!

ARE YOU... SATISFIED?!?
Lie to yourself, lie to your god, look in my eyes and smile!

This is just a beginning to your private paradise,
Just wait and see what the future holds for you,
And when the time is right, and all the pieces fit,
Keep trying hard, but you'll never swallow...

...your own shit...

(the sorrow that we make is so real...)

Swallow what we made to be so real!!
(the real world around us won't forgive what we take lightly...)
We try to fight us, but we've got no way of fighting,
Now this is all, this emptiness, this pain!!!
(the real world around us won't forgive what we take lightly...)
When there's nothing left to cling to, when there's nothing more to gain,
(the real world around us won't forgive what we take lightly...) PAIN!
