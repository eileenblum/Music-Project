Sometimes I feel so hollow,
Entire future melts to past,
Do I live this life too shallow,
For how long it's gonna last.

Even now, I will set this body on fire,
Just to find a way to ease through,
All the pain behind the desire,
I'll leave it all behind.

Burns inside of me, oh, my god, it burns inside of me,
So fucking hard...
Leave it all behind.

Words can't describe just how I feel,
There is no cure for this sorrow,
As if I never wanted to live,
I'm forced where I never belonged.

I will set this body on fire,
Just to find a way to be free,
All the pain will cease on this pyre,
I'll leave it all behind.

so time has come to lit a match and set the flames for my own savior
it seems , too many times i thought it will be OK
so why wont we all lit a match and set the trace to our own failure
it seems now its the only way to leave it all behind...
