All alone in the corner, his walls are closing in,
Constantly repeating this must be a bad dream,
Like a thorn within, like a weight in his heart,
Paranoia increases, it's tearing him apart. (APART!!!)

Do you know how it feels to be a waste of society,
Faceless without pride, or a dignity,
Now raise your voice, get your ass out of shadow,
Don't let them pull you down to the bottom. (to the bottom!!!)

Nameless spoke in name of all his kind,
This life is just another lie!
Nameless spoke in name of every... (hunter of the shadows)
I will leave it all be hind!
Nameless spoke in name of all his kind,
This life is just another lie!
Nameless spoke in name of every... (man without tomorrow)
I will leave it all behind!

Now break the chains that drag you down,
Don't let them push you around,
Spit in their faces, seek your revenge,
Show them what you're made of.

Once he was broken, now's finally free,
So stand up for yourself, âcause worse, it can't be,
If you just hide away in your fear of me,
Oppressed, nameless you'll be. (you will BE!!!)

[Ref.]

Stand up for yourself, raise your voice and yell, FUCK YOU!
Don't let them get away, don't be afraid to say, FUCK YOU!! 2x

[Ref. 2x]
