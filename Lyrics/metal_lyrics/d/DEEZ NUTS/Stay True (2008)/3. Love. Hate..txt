This life is what you make of it
Love it or hate it, this is the hand you were dealt
What happens from here is up to you
Keep true friends by your side and do the best you can do.

Life is a test, you gotta take for yourself
Knowledge is power and wisdom is wealth.

LOVE yourself, your friends, your family
Love where you at but fight for where you wanna be.
HATE anyone who don't show you respect
Just remember only give what you get.
LOVE your mother, your father, the hood you claim
Without these things you wouldn't be who you are today.
HATE anyone who crosses you, fuck 'em
Listen brothers and sisters, cunts will fuck you if you you let 'em.

This life is what you make of it
You only get back, what you put into it.
Nobody's ever gonna live your life for you
But when things get fucked up real friends will be there for you.

Life is a test, you gotta take for yourself
Knowledge is power and wisdom is wealth.

LET ME HEAR YOU SCREAM THIS SHIT, SO I KNOW YOU'RE FEELING IT!

LOVE yourself, your friends, your family
Love where you at but fight for where you wanna be.
HATE anyone who don't show you respect
Just remember only give what you get.
LOVE your mother, your father, the hood you claim
Without these things you wouldn't be who you are today.
HATE anyone who crosses you, fuck 'em
Listen brothers and sisters, cunts will fuck you if you you let 'em.
LOVE!
