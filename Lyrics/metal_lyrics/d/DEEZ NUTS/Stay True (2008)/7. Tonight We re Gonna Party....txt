Tonight were gonna party like there's no tomorrow,
Forget about our whoas and drown our sorrows
Don't forget about your boys when your tipping that bottle
Drunk till fuckin death yeah thats our motto

This shit is more then it seems
This shit is more then getting drunk in a club,
This time i spend, with all of my friends
This is the thing that i love,
The most, a toast to every friend i've ever had.
I love you all, and i hope you'll all be with me till the bitter fuckin end.

I love my dtd brothers and all my edge motherfuckers.
And if you got beef then bring the ruckas
But tonight forget that shit, yeah forget everything,
Skull whatever you drink and let me here you motherfuckers sing...

Tonight were gonna party like there's no tomorrow,
Forget about our whoas and drown our sorrows
Don't forget about your boys when your tipping that bottle
Drunk till fuckin death yeah thats our motto

Tonight theres no regrets about what we felt yesterday
And tonight tomorrow seems like a lifetime away.
We only care about now,
Living in the moment, loving every hour
I wish this shit would never end
What could be better then good times &amp; good friends.

I love my dtd brothers and all my edge motherfuckers.
And if you got beef then bring the ruckas
But tonight forget that shit, yeah forget everything,
Skull whatever you drink and let me hear you fuckers sing...
