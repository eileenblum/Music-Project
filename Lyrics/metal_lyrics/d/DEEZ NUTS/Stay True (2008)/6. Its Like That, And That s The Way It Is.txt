Day after day, feels like I'm dealin' with the same old shit
Pigeon holed by the status quo
They'll never understand the life I live.
Time after time, I'm going out of my fuckin' mind
Wish I could tell the whole fuckin' world
To keep their nose outta me and mine.

DAY AFTER DAY, TIME AFTER TIME.
DAY AFTER DAY, TIME AFTER TIME.
DAY AFTER DAY, TIME AFTER TIME.
DAY AFTER DAY, TIME AFTER TIME, I'm goin' outta my fuckin' mind.

But I won't lay down and die
You won't slow me down, you won't hold me back.
BOW DOWN? GIVE IN? I say FUCK THAT!
Never die attitude, perseverance yeah, I got that
You're not with me, you're against me, yeah it's like that
And thats the way it is!
