DN is back still down for whatever,
still not fuckin with fair weather fans,
still bout my friends and fam.
See to me that's the key to this game
show respect to every body
and the real ones give it back the same.
Its a damn shame so many fuckin fakes
true to your face
but then they talk shit like fuckin snakes.
but it's kool I keep fuckin with this shit
cause its fact no one does this shit like I'm doing it.

I make music for the ones who stay true.
that's what I do,
STAY TRUE.
I make music for the old and the new,
that's what I do,
STAY TRUE.
I make music for you and your crew.
That's what I do
STAY TRUE.

Don't get it twisted its still fuckin hardcore,
stage dives, high 5s that's what I'm in this for.
I ain't in this for money or fame
but if I stack a little change fuck it I won't complain.
