Cash rules everything around me.
Cream get the money.
That's why you gotta get yours, dummy.
This shit ain't funny.
Money is a must, love is cool,
But don't be fooled,
Alone it ain't enough.
Yeah I know it's shitty.
Yeah I know it's rough.
But find out when you're broke,
Love won't get you on the bus.

I'll be the first to say:
This shit's fucked up,
But when you get a bitch knocked up,
Who's gonna cough up?
For hospital bills,
And every other fucking thing.
Before you know it,
Ahe'll be aiming for that diamond ring.
Be my guest put your head in the sand.
But if I was you, man,
I'd formulate a plan.
Cause I'll tell you right now,
If it ain't in your pocket,
Some way, some how,
It's lining some other mother fucker's.
Suckers.

I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
Money cannot buy happiness,
It's true what they say,
But a motherfuckers still got bills to pay,
So I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
Money cannot buy happiness,
It's true what they say,
But a motherfuckers still got bills to pay.

I don't give a fuck who it is,
These days everybody gotta stack their chips,
And you know this.
I'm not saying that money means everything.
But you need a little bit for just about everything.
It can't buy love,
But it can buy food.
And some other shit you might need from time to time too.
Fuck materialistic, I'm realistic.
You can't pay for dinner with napkins, you get it?
Cause I'll tell you right now;
If it ain't in your pockets,
Some way some how,
It's lining some other mother fucker's.
Suckers.

I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
Money cannot buy happiness,
It's true what they say,
But a motherfuckers still got bills to pay,
So I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
I hustle everyday.
I hustle everyday, everyday.
Money cannot buy happiness,
It's true what they say,
But a motherfuckers still got bills to pay.

So..
Make money, money, money, make money, money, money.
Take money, money, money, take money, money, money.
