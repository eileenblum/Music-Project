Fuck everyone of you,
motherfuckin' rats,
you got so much hate,
and i guessin' is cause of the fact,
everytime were taking one step forward,
you take two steps back.

i do this shit for myself,
this is where i wanna be,
this is home,
cause i know everyone here treats friends like family,
go fuck yourself you ain't no one to us,
go fuck yourself you ain't one we can trust,
and when you got no one we'll give a fuck,
ashes to ashes dust to dust.

fuck everyone of you,
motherfuckin' snakes,
you got so much hate,
to face no good fakes,
it ain't on us that your life sucks,
and your a fuckin disgrace.

i do this shit for myself,
this is where i wanna be,
this is home,
cause i know everyone here treats friends like family,
go fuck yourself you ain't no one to us,
go fuck yourself you ain't one we can trust,
and when you got no one we'll give a fuck,
ashes to ashes dust to dust.
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

your nobody,
we don't need you,
you were never shit,
your mother should've swallowed you [x2]
