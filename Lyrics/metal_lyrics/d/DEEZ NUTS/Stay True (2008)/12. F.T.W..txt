This world we live in today
Thinks if you don't fit the mold you'll get left in the wake.
You're gonna meet a lot of miserable pricks
Who wanna tell you how to live but they DON'T KNOW SHIT!
Your best bet, stay true to yourself,
Do shit your way, never listen to a word they say.
Were all born in to this world, that's true,
One thing I know for sure this world DON'T OWN YOU!

It's my life
MY LIFE!
And I'll never let another man chose my path.

It's your live
YOUR LIFE!
Don't ever change who you are cause that's all you have.

FUCK THE WORLD!
Never let anybody judge you
For the way that you live your life.
FUCK THE WORLD!
If you rock a 9 to 5 or you hustle to survive,
Stay on the grind, this is your time.
FUCK THE WORLD!
If you drink up or you X up stand proud
Don't let anybody bring you down.
FUCK THE WORLD!
At the end of the day you gotta live with yourself
Fuck everybody else!
FUCK THE WORLD!

Fuck the world we live in today
And fuck any muther fucker who stands in your way.
Fuck all the negativity that they spit,
And always remember that they DON'T KNOW SHIT!
Your best bet, stay true to yourself,
Do shit your way, never listen to a word they say.
We're all thrown into this world, that's true,
One thing I know for sure this world DON'T OWN YOU!

It's my life
MY LIFE!
And I'll never let another man chose my path.

It's your life
YOUR LIFE!
Don't ever change who you are 'cause that's all you have.

Never let anybody judge you
For the way that you live your life.
If you rock a 9 to 5 or you hustle to survive
Stay on the grind this is your time.
If you X up or you drink up stand proud
Don't let anybody bring you down.
At the end of the day you gotta live for yourself
Fuck everybody else!

FUCK THE WORLD!
