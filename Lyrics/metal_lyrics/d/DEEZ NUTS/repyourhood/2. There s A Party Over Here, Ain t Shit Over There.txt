You know theres gonna be a party when we're up in the club
Soon as we step in the room, everybody shows us love
If you've got beef, better squash it on the double
You know my crew rolls deep, you don't want no trouble.

There's a party over here, ain't shit over there!
If you're drinking tonight, put you're drinks in the air!
There's a party over here, ain't shit over there!
If you're fucking tonight, say fuck yeah! FUCK YEAH!

There's a party over here, ain't shit over there.
We're in the back of the club, doin' shots, drinking beer.
We're all here to get loose, yeah thats whats up
Half my boys are edge, but they're still FUCKED UP!

There's a party over here, ain't shit over there
If you're drinking tonight, put you're drinks in the air.
There's a party over here, ain't shit over there
If you're fucking tonight, say fuck yeah. FUCK YEAH!

There's a party over here, ain't shit over there
If you feel Deez nuts say fuck yeah. FUCK YEAH!

There's a party over here, ain't shit over there
If you're drinking tonight, put you're drinks in the air.
There's a party over here, ain't shit over there
If you're fucking tonight, say fuck yeah. FUCK YEAH!
