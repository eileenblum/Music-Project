Things ain't the same as they used to be
Don't see the same faces that i used to see
Ain't the same love at shows that there used to be
I'll tell you why right now too many fucking fakes G.
That ain't a scene it's a GOD DAMN DISGRACE!

All you fucking fair weather fans,
when a bands hot you're all upon the merch stand
When a band's not you're all upon the broadband
talking shit online, think anybody gives a fuck?
You're out your mind.

FUCK THAT SHIT, EAT A DICK BITCH!
Keep talking that shit, don't nobody wanna hear it.
FUCK THAT SHIT, EAT A DICK BITCH!
Keep talking that shit, don't nobody wanna hear it.

All you new jacks hating, what the fuck have you done?
You need to stop running your mouth, start having some fun
This ain't a game to us, we fucking play for keeps
It's been said before, but talk is cheap.
That ain't a scene it's a GOD DAMN DISGRACE!

All you fucking fair weather fans,
when a bands hot you're all upon the merch stand
When a band's not you're all upon the broadband
talking shit online, think anybody gives a fuck?
You're out your mind.
