Life is tough, yeah it's sad but true
Not a day goes by without some bullshit or drama
Gotta keep eyes in the back of your head
Somebody's waiting to fuck you round behind every god damn corner
Still you gotta fight for yours everyday of the week
It's a mother fucking struggle to make ends meet
The one thing that keeps me going everyday.
I'll always have my friends, i'll always have my family

Make money
Stay true
Share the wealth
Keep it real
You gotta do it for them.
Because the'd do it for you

WHEN TIMES GETS TOUGH
I know its not the end, i can always depend
On my friends and family
WHEN SHIT GETS ROUGH
I've got the upperhand.
Because they've got my back
Till the bitter fucking end

Every day it gets hard knowing right from wrong
Gotta keep your eyes on the prize
Do the best you can
Everybody fucks up, i do it more than most
But i fight to be a better man
But there will never be a price on the from my friends and family

Make money
Stay true
Share the wealth
Keep it real
You gotta do it for them.
Because the'd do it for you

WHEN TIMES GETS TOUGH
I know its not the end, i can always depend
On my friends and family
WHEN SHIT GETS ROUGH
I've got the upperhand.
Because they've got my back
Till the bitter fucking end
