It's a cold fucking world, getting worse every day
We've gotta make this money, yeah we've gotta get paid
No matter how hard times may get
I always know where I'm from, I fucking love where I'm at.

No matter how you're living, this is the life you've been given
You gotta hustle for yours until your pockets are fat
You gotta know where you're from, you gotta love where you're at.

Pour some liquor out, for the ones we've lost
But the ones that survive, always keep by your side
Till the day that you die, throw your first in the sky
REP YOUR HOOD!

My friends have always got my back when we walk these streets
So i keep them close to my heart like a Jacob Piece
We'll be down till we're dead in the ground
We're the kings of this shit, you can't touch this crown.

No matter how you be living, this is the life you've been given
You gotta hustle for yours until your pockets are fat
You gotta know where you're from, you gotta love where you're at.

Pour some liquor out, for the ones we've lost
But the ones that survive, always keep by your side
Till the day that you die, throw your first in the sky
REP YOUR HOOD!

From the dirty fucking south to the wild fucking west
You gotta hold you and yours down, who gives a fuck about the rest?
From the dirty fucking south.
REP YOUR HOOD!
To the wild fucking west.
REP YOUR HOOD!
You gotta hold you and yours down.
REP YOUR HOOD!
Who gives a fuck about the rest?
REP YOUR HOOD!
