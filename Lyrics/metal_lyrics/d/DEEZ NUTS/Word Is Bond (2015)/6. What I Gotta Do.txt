you gotta do what you gotta do.
hope you make an educated choice when you take that stand.
i gotta do what i gotta do. i know right from wrong, ainât no choice, ainât no line in the sand. everything you did you did for yourself and nobody else no matter the cost. everything you did you did for yourself at all our expense no matter whatâs lost. you gotta do what you gotta do. hope that you're enjoying that view with your head in the sand. i gotta do what i gotta do. know where I'm needed i wont rest âtil I get there in the end. no matter what was lost. no matter what the cost. no matter what was lost. you did this to yourself.
