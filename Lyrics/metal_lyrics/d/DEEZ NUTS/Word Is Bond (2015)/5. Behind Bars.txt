[feat. Andrew 'Goose' Neufeld]was warned this is a slippery fuckinâ slope, but i climb that hill again and again, never come down though.
the repercussions, shit they ainât nothin' and iâll do whatever it takes to keep numbinâ myself from all that shit that turns my stomach.
that shit that twists my brain till i gotta shut off from it.
all the evil in the world takes it toll, ill face it all tomorrow i swear.
today just let me do this one more time.
the walls are closin' in. the airâs ripped from my lungs. my mind it freezes up. the words elude my tongue. just give me one more time.
the walls are closin' in. the airâs ripped from my lungs. my mind it freezes up. the words elude my tongue. the light is to bright exposes all my scars, only place to escape is right behind these bars.
all i need, all i need is one more time.
