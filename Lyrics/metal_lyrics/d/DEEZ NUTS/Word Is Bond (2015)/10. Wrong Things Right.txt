i wouldn't wish on my worst fuckinâ enemy what i feel every god damn day and night. my heart beats outside of my chest, won't rest until i make the wrong things right. had the most precious thing to me torn from my arms
but i refuse to lose in this scenario. what goes around comes around in the end and when it does i hope this same pain buries you.
you cant replace whats irreplaceable. you cant deny the undeniable.
all i ever been is a good man, like my father and his father before him.
