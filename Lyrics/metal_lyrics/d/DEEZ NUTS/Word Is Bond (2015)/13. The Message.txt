pick myself up, dust myself off, never let nothin get the better of me.
keep my chip up, get my head straight, shit, i gotta be the best man i can be.
yeah i know how it feels to wake up fucked up, tough luck times is tough, so i better man the fuck up. easier said then done huh? my mind full of paranoia creepinâ round mine with my blinds shut.
gimme pills gimme powder, take em till i feel numb. chain smoke them cigarettes till i got the black lung. here come the come down, drown it with that Hennessy .my hearts heavy, my hearts racing, got me pacing in concrete boots. feel the weight of every situation but i rise to the occasion.
pick myself up, dust myself off, never let nothin' get the better of me.
keep my chip up, get my head straight, shit, i gotta be the best man i can be.
yeah my mind fucked, running circles in my head, but im stuck to my bed wishing i was fuckinâ dead. more money more problems, fuck i feel you big, make a little cake, so called âfriendsâ cant stand the kid.
dont push me cause im close to the edge. im tryinâ not to lose my head.
