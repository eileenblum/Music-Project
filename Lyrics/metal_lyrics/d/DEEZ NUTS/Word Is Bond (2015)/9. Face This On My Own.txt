there aintâ nothing quite like this life we live, shout out my brothers yaâll know what it is we've all walked the line we've all paid our dues, but at the end of the day this is the life we choose.we've all walked the line, we've all paid our dues. proud of each and everyone one of us, carved out our own niche never leaned on a crutch. sometimes we take a fall aint easy st,
you got our back if we trippin' help us back on our feet. and you know weâd catch you if you fall.
donât have to face this on my own, i got my squad with me everywhere i go. your never ever on your own, no matter where you're at you got fam, never alone.
differences are few similarities many if you 4204, 24 or 420. through adversity we made it face problems head on, all for one, one for all kid. through adversity, yeah we made it through. this shit aint for the faint hatred,
and we all new that way back when it stared. different patterns cut from the same cloth, got the game stitched up cant tear us apart.
donât have to face this on my own, i got my squad with me everywhere i go. your never ever on your own, no matter where you're at you got fam, never alone.
been round the world and back so many times, i know i never would have made it without you by my side. and all i need to know, is I'm never alone, and i don't need to face this on my own. don't have to face this on my own, i don't have to face this on my own.
