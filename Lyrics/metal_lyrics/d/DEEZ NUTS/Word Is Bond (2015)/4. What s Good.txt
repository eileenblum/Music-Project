Bet.

Yo whatâs good?
Yeah thatâs whatâs up.

Lets get shit straight, you cant take nothing from us
Cause we've done this shit our own way since we came out the gate.
Quick to jettison you freshman, surround ourselves with veterans
Better men on our worst day then you could be on your best you can bet.

Yeah thatâs whatâs up.

Oh ye of little faith, I pray for you're demise
Don't get that knot twisted cause I'm quick to cut those fuckinâ ties.
And donât ever mistake kindness for weakness,
We heard about that sneak diss little bitches can't keep secrets, for real.

Yo whatâs good?
Yeah thatâs whatâs up.

This a no flex zone little homie blow me,
Pause, and if you could do it any better youâd show
Cause you fake what you make what I state is just fact.
Heavy lies the crown thatâs why I got a strong back.

Whatâs good?
Yeah thatâs whatâs up.

Oh ye of little faith, we pray for you're demise
Don't get your knot twisted cause weâre quick to cut those fuckinâ ties,

Whatâs good?

Speak your mind but...

Motherfucker stop lying
Yeah right uh-huh.

Yo whatâs good?
Yeah thatâs whatâs up.
