Don't call it a comeback,
We've been here for years,
Travelled the world and now we back with this.
Made a few enemies but more friends than we can count.
Got fucked up in towns that I can't even pronounce.
And we've got nothing to prove got nothing to lose,
Do what the fuck we want this is the life we chose.
And you can catch DN at a show near you.
Know how we do stay true,
Because you haven't seen the last of us yet.
We're still here no you haven't seen the last of us.
Fuckin' haters no you'll never get the best of us.
We do it for the ones who,
You know who I'm talkin' bout if you ain't with us
take our fuckin' names out your mouth.
