Sometimes it feels like the world is against you,
Lookin' out your door is like starin' down the barrel.
Problems piled up like the bills on your table,
It feels like there aint no fuckin' way you can face 'em.

We've all been there,
But it's easy to forget when you're on top of the world,
Think about the ones who aint.
It's the struggles in our lives that make us who we are.
So grab your fuckin' glasses put 'em up!
Put 'em up!
This one's for you,

When the grind's gettin' to you all my blue collar brothers.
For our lost loved ones and the heart broken lovers.
Broken home kids and the people doin' bids.
We all face hard times shit there aint no one above it.

Sometimes it feels like it aint ever gonna get better nothin' goes your way,
Everyday you get more fed up.
Don't see the light at the end of the tunnel right now,
But trust me when I say you'll make it there somehow.

We've all been there,
But it's easy to forget when you're on top of the world,
Think about the ones who aint.
It's the struggles in our lives that make us who we are.
So grab your fuckin' glasses put 'em up!
Put 'em up!

The downtrodden,
The disenfranchised,
This one's for you here's to making it through hard times.
The lonely the lost,
You down on your luck,
Yeah this one's for you here's to never giving up.
So grab your fuckin' glasses put em up,
Put em up!
