When it rains, it fucking pours,
Until I'm soaked to the bone.
Trapped in a pattern of self destruction,
This shit's been coming far too much to ignore.

Then again, who gives a fuck?
Bad luck when I'm gone ain't nobody gonna miss me much,
Guess I'll live fast, Guess I'll die young,
Even if I could, don't think I'd wanna hold on.

So give me one good fucking reason why I should tighten my grip,
I'll give you hundred of reasons that you should abandon this ship.

Ooooooh... OH!

God Damn,
I don't claim to have the answers or the keys,
To be honest life's mysteries scare the shit out of me,
I'm just a man doing the best that I can,
But these locks just seem to get the better of me everyday.
Damn.

You don't know shit if you think you know me,
Don't owe you nothing, don't just gushing fucking blow me,
My heads a fucking mess, my heart is fucking cold,
And if you don't know now you know.

Oh.

If you don't know now you know [x5]
If you don't know now you fucking know, Yeah.

When it rains, it fucking pours,
Until I'm soaked to the bone.
