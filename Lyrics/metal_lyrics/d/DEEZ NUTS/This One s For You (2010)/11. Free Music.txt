I remember way back when I discovered this shit
From that first moment I fell in love with this shit
Didn't matter who you was didn't matter who you with
If you were there for the music you got love and respect
I knew right there, I knew right then,
HARD CORE would have a place in my heart till the end
Nowa days get judge every move you make
Who you with what you wear, motherfuckers so fake
Who the fuck are you to judge those who do there own thing
Mind your business mother fucker stay in your own lane
Don't come up in here with a closed mind
Don't see this bout freedom then you aint our kind.
Didn't start this shit, but one things for sure
Freedom of expression aint shit no more
Old school new school, need to learn though
No love for this shit mother fucker there's the door GO
Never forget what this shit is about
Us against the world this is ours no doubt
This supposed to be a family
This for you this for me supposed to be FREE MUSIC
Fuck the drama fuck the bickering the bullshit
Aint about that supposed to be about the music
Voice your opinion but keep mind open
Don't get caught up in new trends every moment
Seen a lot come and go but I aint sweating it
Met a lot that will be there till the end you can bet on it
Everybody here should feel welcome
When the world shuts you this is somewhere we can all turn
Didn't start this shit, but know one things for sure
Freedom of expression aint shit no more
Old school new school, need to learn though
No love for this shit mother fucker there's the door GO
Never forget what this shit is about
Us against the world this is ours no doubt
This supposed to be a family
This for you this for me supposed to be FREE MUSIC
This still means something to me
This supposed to be a family
This for you this for me supposed to be free music
