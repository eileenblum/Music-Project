Look me in the fuckin' eye
Tell me to my fuckin' face [x2]

Same old, same old, that's why you fucking need us here
Too many oxygen thieves and we the breath of fresh air
Offended your conformist sensibility, I'm sorry but we don't need your help
And we ain't goin' mother fuckin' nowhere

Paid my dues you can keep the change
Read the chapter and turned the page
So sick and tired of the same old shit
Gotta flip the script cause I can't resist
Better part of ten years spent on tours livin' in vans, sleeping on floors
Home's where the heart is, love this no doubt
So don't try to tell me what this shit's about.

Cause I paid my dues you can keep the change
Read the chapter and turned the page
So sick and tired of the same old shit
Gotta flip the script cause I can't resist
Gotta flip the script cause I can't resist
Gotta flip the script cause I can't resist

And we ain't goin' mother fuckin' nowhere

Look me in the fuckin' eye
Tell me to my fuckin' face [x3]
