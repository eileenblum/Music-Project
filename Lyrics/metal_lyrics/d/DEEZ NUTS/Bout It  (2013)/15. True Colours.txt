Taught you how to paint the town red, now your green with envy.
Made sure everybody eats, claim your plate was empty.
Now I see your true colours, your a waste of space.
Can't stand either one of your fuckin' two faces.

DFL to my face, talkin' shit under cover,
You a ladder climbin' dick ridin' bitch motherfucker
