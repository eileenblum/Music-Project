[feat. Sam Carter]I've got my band of brothers
And we're taking it to the streets
If we don't wake up tomorrow
It's cause we drink til dawn, we ain't trying to sleep
You'll never take this away from us
Cause we don't give a fuck
Throw caution to the wind
We all know the best part of it
Tomorrow night we'll do it again

There's a time where we're looking for the time of your life
We are feeling it so I guess that tonight is the night
At it again with your boys who came in game
No fucking around, we gotta do this right. Alright?
Grab your weed, smoke til your eyes bleed
Pop anything you got, drink everything in sight
Grab a pack, smoke til your lungs black
Sum it up with no one spewing up until the daylight

I've got my band of brothers
And we're taking it to the streets
If we don't wake up tomorrow
It's cause we drink til dawn, we ain't trying to sleep
You'll never take this away from us
Cause we don't give a fuck
Throw caution to the wind
We know the best part of it
Tomorrow night, shit, we do it again

Yeah we all want
Taking this city by storm
Yeah, we'll drink your bar dry
And then move on to the next one
If we wake up with memories we can't render
Then we'll know for sure we had a night to remember
So grab your weed, smoke til your eyes bleed
Pop anything you got, drink everything in sight
Grab a pack, smoke til your lungs black
Sum it up with everyone in love til it's daylight. Alright?

This is the time of our life and we'll live it up
This is the time of our life and we'll live it up
This is the time of our life and we don't give a fuck

I've got my band of brothers
And we're taking it to the streets
If we don't wake up tomorrow
It's cause we drink til dawn, we ain't trying to sleep
You'll never take this away from us
Cause we don't give a fuck
Throw caution to the wind
We know the best part of it
Tomorrow night, shit, we do it again
