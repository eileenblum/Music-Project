Yo let me tell you something, there's always gonna be people in your life
who think they know what's best for you better then you do. Next time
someone tells you how to live your life tell 'em yo, shut you fuckin' mouth
when your talkin' to me.

OOOHHH

This is the life we fuckin' live. We won't apologize for shit.

Everyday I never stray from the path that I've chosen.
Never cared I'm the loose thread, in the tapestry this world has woven.
Gravitate towards the ones, who share like a mind.
If that ain't you stay out my lane, I'll stay out yours, we'll be fine.

Respect is give and take, real recognises real.
Don't second guess yourself, live by this and keep it trill.

This is the life we fuckin' live. We won't apologize for shit.
This is the life you fuckin' live, don't you apologize for shit.

Don't you apologize for

SHIT

OOOHHH

Anything you do, do it for yourself, you hear me?
They all want a piece, don't you ever give it to 'em.
Anything you do, do it for yourself, you hear me?
Live life with no regrets.

BRAAAHHH

This is the life we fuckin' live. We won't apologize for shit.
This is the life you fuckin' live, don't you apologize

Never apologize
