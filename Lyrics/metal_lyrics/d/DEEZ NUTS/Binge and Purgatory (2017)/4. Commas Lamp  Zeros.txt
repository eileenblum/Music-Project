How many ways can you tell the same tired story?
Heard you forever, and you never said somethin'.
Bored me to tears, but I never felt nothin'.

When you put your pen to paper if it's not a cheque are you still inspired?
It's like you've all been cheating off the same sheet. 
Ideals laid to waste to pave the way to mediocrity.

We need some inspiration, at the cost of your high rotation,
we need some inspiration, not another hit on the radio station.
We need some inspiration, at the cost of your high rotation,
we need some inspiration, not a fuckin' hit on your bullshit station.

Yeah, got the same bills as the next,
but refuse to dance for dollars while management cash cheques.
Guess in ethics you boys were skipping classes, 
used to have the juice, watered down to feed the masses.

It's a damn shame, ain't a damn thing funny.
Watch a grown man turn tricks for the money.
It's a damn shame, ain't a damn thing funny.
Watch a grown man turn bitch for the money.

Ideals laid to waste to pave the way to mediocrity.

They think they can put a price, on any man's soul,
just a matter of the commas and zeros.
