Why you try so hard to break 
a leg with every fuckin' step you take. 
I've got the remedy, 
all I've gotta do is jog your fuckin' memory. 
Why you try so hard to prove 
yourself I know what we've been through. 
I've got the remedy, 
remember that I'm not the enemy. 
Try so hard to tempt fate 
with every single move you make.

Why you try so hard to prove 
yourself I know what we've been through. 
I've got the remedy, remember. 

Go dig that ditch, 
but know your limits I won't bury this. 
Chose battles 
wisely, this war is something I'm feeling to win. 
Do what you wish 
and count how many fucks I do not give.
