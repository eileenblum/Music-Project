[feat. Scott Vogel (Terror)]Clarity's a luxury I cannot afford. 
Sometimes I gotta face my demons, just to make sense of it all. 
Path of least resistance, so easy to find.
So I step outside myself, just to see what's on my mind. 
True what they say, idle time's the devil's play thing. 
So why the fuck I only sin when burning candles at both ends.

In dark corners of my psyche I find all the answers I need. 

And I'm getting closer, I think I'm getting closer,

But if I take another dose, might just find what I need. I might just... 

Cannot see straight, life has blinded my eyes for to long. Another dose, it brings me peace. Or digs my life a deeper hole.

In dark corners of my psyche I find all the answers I need. 

And I'm getting closer, I think I'm getting closer, 
I might just take another dose, might just do it over.
I think I'm getting closer, the antidote's within reach. 
But if I take another dose, might just find what I need. I might just...
