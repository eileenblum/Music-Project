Fast path is a straight line. 
The hard way littered with the things they'll never find.
Never follow suit, we raise the bar. 
You gotta break the mold, if you wanna set the standard high.
If you looking for the ones who fugazi as fuck.
They're a dime a bakers dozen so I guess your in luck.

Spit barbs with a sharp tongue. 
There ain't nothin' nothin' I won't speak on. 
Find freedom in this medium. 
I'll never let 'em never let 'em put their chains on.
Break out, break out, break out
let em know who you are. 
Set the standard, raise the bar. 
Break the mold let 'em know who you are.
Break the mold let 'em know who you are. 
know who you are.
