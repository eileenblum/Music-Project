Back then 
we always talked about how it was gonna be if we all made it to now. 
Now and then 
try and analyse how and when it all went wrong, no answers ever ease my mind. 
when it all went wrong, no answers ever ease my mind.
how it all went wrong

We always used to see eye to eye, 
now I guess I'm in your blind spot from time to time.
ain't no suprises there, but these people really fuck with my head

We always used to stand side by side, 
strength, who new numbers would divide the vibe. 
Times change, 
ain't no suprises there, but the way it change my people really fuck with my head.

Can't look back with out snapping my neck, 
only option keep it pushin', focus on the task.
Can't look forward without stacking my chips 
were the only option is to go against the house and win. 

Don't you remember how things were when we first struck a chord?
Played in our own key, now disharmony has taking it's toll on me.
Don't you remember how our rhythm had us stepping in tow?
March to our own beat, now we're out of time 

Can't look back with out snapping my neck, 
only option keep it pushin', focus on the task.
Can't look forward without stacking my chips 
only option is to go against the odds and win.
