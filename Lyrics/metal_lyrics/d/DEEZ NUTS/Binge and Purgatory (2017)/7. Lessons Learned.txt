[feat. Jamey Jasta (Hatebreed)]Who the fuck am I, am I unrecognisable?

that you'll never see me in the same light that you did.
Every single memory is underlined in red.
So much face lost, it's hard facing that.
One more table turned every bridge I burn. 
There is no going back.

Lessons learned doesn't change the fact,
what we had never coming back

Lessons learned doesn't change the fact,
what we had

doesn't change the fact
what we had â never coming back

One more lesson learnt every bridge I burn.
Doesn't change the fact
Every lesson learnt, doesn't change the fact
Doesn't change the fact

Who the fuck am I, am I unrecognisable?
It's just me, myself and I all three of us are fools.
You fueled the rage but I struck that match.
One more lesson learnt every bridge I burn.
