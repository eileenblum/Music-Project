Now's not the time, no matter how you tell it. 
That's not my style, any way that you address it.
Now's not the time, got real shit that I'm dealing with.
That's not my style, you can leave me out with all that mess.
Not enough hours in the day to deal with mine. 
If your woes ain't really real, I really don't have time.
Let's trade shoes, so you can see. My life ain't a cakewalk, I just make it look easy.

The world remains on it's axis, regardless of your movements.
You put my name on the guest list, but you won't see me at your pity party.

The world remains on it's axis
Before you cue the violins,
there's something you should know.
Just because I don't speak on them, doesn't mean I don't have problems, 
just means I'm man enough to handle shit on my own.
