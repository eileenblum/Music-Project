Do not what I say, do not as I do.
I bleed my father's blood, but this life may be the death of you.
I tread thin ice with a flaming boot, 
I preach of excess and live an introverted truth. 

Lay here with me 
I'll lie to you.
Tell you we'll make angels from the demons of our youth.
Demons of our youth
But if history writes my story right then let it tell, 
a life of sin does not await the after life to bring you hell

[2x]
Do not what I say, do not as I do.
I bleed my father's blood, but this life may be the death of you.
