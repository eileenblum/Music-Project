Since the days of my youth, 
in the search for truth I've only found one absolute.
That's the guarantee there is no certainty. 
How you embrace the unexpected means everything.

What you want and what's it worth?
Price only counts if you pay it.
What you want and what's it worth?
Risk only exists if you take it.

Since the days of my youth, 
in the search for truth I've only found one absolute.
That's the guarantee there is no certainty. 
How you embrace the unexpected means everything.

Can't change the past, can't control the future.
If this is news to you there's nothing I can teach you.
But we're the kings of the present, of the immediate.
The plan is going in and we never deviate.

[3x]
What you want and what's it worth?
Price only counts if you pay it.
What you want and what's it worth?
Risk only exists if you take it.

For what it's worth. What it's worth
For what it's worth.

Since the days of your youth, 
in the search for truth you never found one absolute.
There is no guarantee, there is no certainty. 
The fact you can't embrace it undermines everything
