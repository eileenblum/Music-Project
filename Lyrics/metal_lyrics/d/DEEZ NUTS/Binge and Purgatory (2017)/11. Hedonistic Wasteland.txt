Questioning my legacy 
as I traverse this hedonistic wasteland. 
When I'm gone, will my loved ones tell my story, 
or be grateful that its come to an end. 
Come to an end.

How did I end up here, this hedonistic wasteland.
How did I end up here, this hedonistic wasteland

My only property is no man's land. 
So I stake my claim on every single grain of sand. 
That slides the hour glass of time. 
But as time slips though my fingers I find no peace of mind.

How did I end up here, this hedonistic wasteland.
