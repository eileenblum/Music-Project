I made my bed, I'm forced to fuckin' lie here.
Heart broken, cold sweatin' through this nightmare.
See the end of the tunnel, there ain't no light there. 

Tasted the kiss of death, every day I savor it.
Every day, a hopeless plight. 
Vicious circle, one constant in my life. 
Juxtaposed, only lifestyle I know.
I want to end it on a high note. 

But there's no death or glory for me, 
binge and purgatory. 
See the end of the tunnel, there ain't no light there. 
But there's no death or glory for me, 
binge and purgatory. 
Tasted the kiss of death, every day I savor it.
But there's no death or glory
binge and purgatory

God blessed the child, cause I got my own. 
But I still danced with the devil so my debts forever set in stone. 
I morn for my youth, I pray for the end. 
But I live on for my seed and face the flames to forge a better man.

But there's no death or glory for me, 
binge and purgatory. 
See the end of the tunnel, there ain't no light there. 
But there's no death or glory for me, 
binge and purgatory. 
Tasted the kiss of death, every day I savor it.
But there's no death or glory
binge and fuckin' purgatory
