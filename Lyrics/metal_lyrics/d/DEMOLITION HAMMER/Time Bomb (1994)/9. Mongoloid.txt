Mongoloid he was a mongoloid. Happier than you and me. Mongo-
loid he was a mongoloid. And it determined what he could see.
Mongoloid he was a mongoloid. One chromosome too many. Mogo-
loid he was a mongoloid. And it determined what he could see.
And he wore a hat. And he had a job. And he brought home the
bacon. So that no one knew. Mongoloid he was a mongoloid. His
friends were unaware. Mongoloid he was a mongoloid. Nobody
even cared.
