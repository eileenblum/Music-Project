Shards of glass fill the air. Shattered bone. Stench of gas-
oline smoke and blood. D.O.A. Loss of control. Intoxicated.
Final approach. An early grave. Merging man and machine. Syn-
thesized. Impact breaks your neck like a twig. Integrate.
Twisted crucifixion - contorted. Unidentified. Once a human
being. Now gracefully distorted. Mass velocity. A grotesque
twisted portrait. Obsessed with power and destroyed by speed.
Abuse of power melding man and machine.
