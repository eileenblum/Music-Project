The wars that they wage
With violent murderous rage
The hungry soldiers of fortune
Care not who they oppose
Relentless assault
Of assassins for hire
Destroying at will
All that stand in their way
Specialists in destruction
Is their life's only function
Mercenary onslaught will be
Brought down on you
Mercenary aggression
Devastation obsession
Countless victims cry out
Against their brutal oppression
Forced into bondage
Their captors show them no mercy
They fear the wrath of mercenary aggression
Ruthless brigade
Dealing tactics of pain
Planning their strategies
Of bludgeon at strife
With a government issued
Contact of death
They attempt to besiege
A tyrant deranged
Insurmountable impact
Gladiatorial combat
Politicians terrorist
Soon fall their prey
Mercenary aggression
Infiltration prevention
Ammunition repels
Military contention
Disarming a strong hold
With chaotic precision
Overthrow a regime with
Mercenary aggression
