Red bag in the tide
Unknown origin
Deadly contents
A floating pile of pestilence
No one suspects
The impending plague
Imposing multitudes
Lethal strain
Swept in by tide
Epidemic coincides
Bulging contagious
Infectious hospital waste
Blood via tidal wave
Lab rats culminate
Bacteria
A festering reservoir
Putrid menstrum
Gushing sea of pain
Corrosive genesis
Serum death
Cultures decompose
Healing implements erode
Coastline reaping
Infectious hospital waste
Low tide, revealing a display so vile
Preys upon the unsuspecting
AIDS, link vials of unknown serum beached
By deliberate acts of dumping
Virus, absorbed by a school of fish
Wields a cuisine of demise
Caustic, wide spread harmful influence
Of microscopic agents
[Lead Sykes]
E.P.A. denies
Raging venomous decline
Of the ocean's infestation
Certain death compels
Irritating toxic smells
Beaches wreaking sick intent
Greed, constitutes lies
Pay off complete
Now it's too late
Barge, eludes a mandate
Clinical waste
Caustic shoreline
Scum, cripples a beach
Carcinogens
Toxic release
Germ tainted torrent
Hydraulic death
Containment
[Lead Reilly]
