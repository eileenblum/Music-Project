Ritual sacrifice, dreadful visages
Slain to consume, archaic butchery
Carnivorous obsession for flesh
Anthropophagy

Warfare contrived
To devour enemies
Fundamental lust fueled by blood
Abhorrent practice, savagery
Violent effigy, obscene unmerciful
Brutality

Fresh bodies strung by their limbs
Inverted corpses punctured
Drainage of the blood
Corpulent victims stripped of skin
Tortured and blistered remnant of mortality

Gorge, ingested human feast
Carve, embroiled, gored, dismembered

Infinite crania and jaw
Splashed and encrusted, fetid
Massive rack of skulls
Vast scale of slaughtered carcasses
Barbaric cannibals reveling in flesh

Cull marrow from split bone
Maul, englut raw viscera

Manducate a choking mess
Of victimized carnage
Cauldron distills a boiling human broth
Carnivorous obsession for flesh
Anthropophagy
Warfare contrived
To devour enemies
Mutilated hulk charred and burned
Dermis bursting violently
Shattering the skull, extract
Consume the brain
Gaping death head
