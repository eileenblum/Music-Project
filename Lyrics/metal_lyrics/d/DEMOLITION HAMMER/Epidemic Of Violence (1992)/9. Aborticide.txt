Surgical embryonic murder in the womb
Termination abominates
Dead--a lifeless tumor
Premature, suctioned through a uterine syringe

Forcible cervical drainage

Blood expelled from the womb
Massive hemorrhage flood
Noisesome afterbirth
Vile wrenching surgery
Abolished embryos
Genetic massacre
Aborticide

Mutilate, umbilical entangled on a hook
Laceration evacuates
Torn--a split placenta
Cauterized, electric current
Desecrated birth
Abrogate, savagely deformed

Blood expelled from the womb
Massive hemorrhage flood
Noisesome afterbirth
Vile wrenching surgery
Abolished embryos
Genetic massacre
Aborticide

Death, cesarean, hysterotomy
Kill internally, dead before it's born
Pain, mortality, fetal homicide
Mass prenatal death, morbid genocide

Intense hemorrhaging
Hostile dilation
Menstrual extraction, probing catheter
Septic vacutage, rancid void

Profuse teratogens
F2 injection
Hypertonic salt instilled in the womb
Felat teratoid, stillborn

Bludgeoning, damage of the amnionic sac
Tranformation perforates
Skull--a fatal lesion
Amputate congenital abnormalities
Sterilized, tubal butchery

Blood expelled from the womb
Massive hemorrhage flood
Noisesome afterbirth
Vile wrenching surgery
Abolished embryos
Genetic massacre
Aborticide
