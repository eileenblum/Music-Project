Searing with the pain of ravaged world
Destined to collide
Struggle, in vain, to exist
Knowing you soon will die
Unable to accept, your forthcoming death
Burial a crime
Carbonizing cremation
Consummation horrified
Double insulated stainless tanks
Liquid nitrogen
Housed, within a concrete vault
Preservation capsule
Biological suspension
Sub-zero bloodless state
Hypodermic continment
Cryo-hybernate
Deanimating life
Is your only chose
No hope for cure
Injected with
Cryo-protestants
Perfusing your body
Another frozen corpse
awaiting resurrection
Desperate human beings
Mortal guinea pigs
Dreams of cheating death
Experimenting, freezing
Waiting, thawing
Life extension
through neuro preservation
Human souls on ice
Recessisting metabolism
Flesh solidified
Pumped with anti-freeze substitute solution
Minus 320
Sub-zero capsule
Preserving tissue
Sustained by cryostat
[Leads Sykes, Reilly, Sykes, Reilly]
Immortality seeking customers
Repressing destiny
Gelid remains, residing in
Eternal dormancy
Cryonicists maintain a frigid cannister
Metallic sarcofagi
Animation suspended
Carnage petrified
[Repeat 2nd verse]
