Outcast wretched mongrel hound
Roaming canine madness
Incisors ripping painful force
Viciously clamps down
Rabid vector, fit of violence
Unprovoked assault
Bloodstained lethal quadruped
Poised for attack
Viral laden infected saliva
Contaminates your wounds
Plundering your neural tract
Genetic genocide
Bearing a trifling insignificant
Mad dog puncture wound
You realize not the tortured Hell
You're about to be put through
Broken skin
Rabid jaws, contaminate, rabies
Viral plague
Infiltrates, spinal cord
Foaming mouth
Boiling spit, fevers rage, rabies
Destructive
Mania, compulsive, rabid death
[Leads Reilly, Sykes]
Rescinding incubation
Plague ascends to the brain
Torrid fever seething, furnace in your head
Frothy secretions spill and dribble
From your gasping mouth
Voice distorted, phonetics like a human dog
Hydrophobic spasms, deny your greed for water
Your face depicts a mask of terror
Drooling uncontrolled
Interment mental derangement
Exploding from restraints
Bicuspid flailing brute creation
Veracious rabid feast
[Repeat 2nd verse]
Your last mortal hours spent
Bound to a post
