Progressive evolution
Spawns a hybrid breed
Through natural selection
Neanderthal conceived
Barreled chest and heavy limbed
Bony ridge atop his skull
Beetled brow, immensely strong
Bi-pedal locomotion
Ape man, short statured
Slouching dim wit brute
Homo erectus
Modern sub-species
Packing spears and heavy clubs
Stalking giant prey
Neanderthal attack
A migratory herd
Mammoth charges with malice
Tries to feast upon his death
Armed with a broken ranpike
Impale it's massive chest
Butcher with stone tools
Carcass of their prey
Savage intention
Carnivorous feast commence
[Lead Reilly]
Intruding hostile cave bear
Slay the vicious beast
Snare a wooly rhino in a
Camouflaged abyss
Massive haul of bones in tow
Retreating to his dank abode
Embossing his icy lair
With a skull and bone complex
Slaughter for pleasure
Instinctively possessed
Killing the symbol
Of his dominance
Skulls of fallen enemies
Crushed by scathing blows
Mastication of their flesh
Burn the bones for fuel
Human bone, cut, smashed and charred
Neanderthal has left his mark
Severed heads, disjointed limbs
Cannibalic butchery
Emerge, cro magnon
A higher form of life
Violent, fierce battle
Neanderthal's demise
