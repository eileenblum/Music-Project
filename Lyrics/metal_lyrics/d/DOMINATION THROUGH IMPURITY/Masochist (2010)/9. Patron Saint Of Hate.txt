Oh my god I have forgotten what it means to be in control. 
I have completely let go. Now itâs impossibleâ¦now itâs impossible to save my old self. 
The light is getting dimmer. Coldness consumes my soul. All my fears and all my hate now control me. 
The stench is getting stronger. Iâm rotting from inside. All my fears and all my hate will destroy me. 

I am a prisoner of fate. 
I am the Patron Saint of Hate. 
I will forever fall from grace. 
I am the Patron Saint of Hate. 

Oh my god is this stranger in front of me. Is this stranger before me my reflection? 
Distorted eyes staring at me from the mirror. I see nothing but a heartless monster. 
The darkness is getting blacker. The cold has consumed my soul. All my fears, all my hate now control me. 
The stanch is getting fainter. Thereâs nothing left to rot. All my fears and all my hate have destroyed me. 

I am a prisoner of fate. 
I am the Patron Saint of Hate.
I will forever fall from grace. 
I am the Patron Saint of Hate.

I am the meaning of lack of self control. 
I am the meaning ofâ¦I am the meaning of hate. 

I am a prisoner of fate. 
I am the Patron Saint of Hate.
I will forever fall from grace. 
I am the Patron Saint of Hate.

I am the meaning of lack of self control. 
I am the meaning ofâ¦I am the meaning of hate.

Oh my god what have we done? 
Oh my god what have we become.[X2]

Oh my god [X3]

Oh my god what have we done? 
Oh my god what have we become. [Fades Out]
