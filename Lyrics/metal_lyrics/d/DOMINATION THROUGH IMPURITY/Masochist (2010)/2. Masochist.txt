Looking at myself staring back in the mirror
The person looking back at me is clouded in white
Razor lying next to a pile of powder
I start to feel again, so i cut another line

I have lost all emotion. i'm beyond numb
Feed my addiction. i can't kill myself fast enough

To me, i'm already dead
Too fucked up to look in the mirror
I still feel those eyes staring deep within me
The razor in my hand cuts another line
I don't ever want to feel again

I have lost all sense of self-control
With every hit, i feel it taking hold
Pale and sleepless, i find myself alone
I tear open another bag of blow

This disease has planted its roots deep within my soul
The blood flowing through my veins is running cold
Rail after rail, gram after gram, it takes control
No matter how much i take in, i can't seem to kill myself fast enough

It's taking over
Infection spreads
I feel my body rotting
Empty inside

I must submit to the will of this evil in me
Inhaling every single speck of dust
I cannot deny the power it has over me
Killing who i used to be and who i am

Contaminate my veins with pure evil
I've found my path of self-destruction
I sink deeper in the depths of addiction
Reality: nothing more than a blur of gray

Why can't i just fucking die?

Peace is just another bump away
Numbness snorted through a rolled up bill
Death waits at the end of this dark tunnel
I have become a fucking masochist

Pour out. cut the line. inhale. infect

Hope no more
Dream no more
Feel no more
Bleed no more
Live no more

I have lost all control
Inevitable is the day that this addiction destroys what is left of me
There's no escape
There's nothing left to save
Irrelevant is the fact that with every hit i knew i was sealing my fate without remorse

Numb. i've found my peace
