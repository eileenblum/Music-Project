Fear what I have become
Fear what I am
Remember my name
Your flaccid tongue has been flapping uncontrollably
It's time to pay
Your efforts to bury me have been in vain
You've had this coming for a very long time
Now taste the pain
Keep talking your bullshit now that we're face to face
Look in my eyes while I cut out your tongue and think about
Why you are where you are today
Keep talking your bullshit now that we're face to face
Look in my eyes, look me
Dead in the eyes and know the youth you violated will now be safe
You piece of shit
I am the future
You are the past
You waste of life
You'll be forgotten
My name will last
Your time is done
I am the future
You are the past
My time is now
You'll be forgotten
My name will last
I'll bleed you dry
I'll paint the walls with your blood
I'll harmonize my laughs with your screams
You pedophile
How many kids have you raped
How many childhoods have you scarred
Your time is done you know you're going to hell
If it exists you know I'll see you there
My time is now
I stand above you and smile as you beg like the coward you are
No need for last words
My ears are deaf to your grunts
Death is a reward at the end of the punishment you will
Receive by my hand
Bow down
Receive your fate
So hard to say "I'm sorry" without a tongue
Bow down
Respect my name
And feel the power of what I have become
Keep talking your bullshit now that we're face to face
Look in my eyes while your tongue's on the ground and think about why you are where you are today
Keep talking your bullshit now that we're face to face
Look in my eyes, loot me dead in the eyes and know the youth you violated will now be safe
