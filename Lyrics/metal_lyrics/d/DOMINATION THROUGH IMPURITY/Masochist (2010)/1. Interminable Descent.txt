I thought it was just another day
5 a.m, wake up to begin the daily grind
Another stupid fucking day of what i thought was happiness
Another stupid fucking day of being a slave

On this day, everything changed
My superficial life crumbled right before my eyes
On this day, i lost my fucking mind
I thought it was just another day

I struggled in vain to hold on to what was left in the ruins of my life
Nothing left to show for years of self-degredation and sacrifice
Nothing left from a lifetime of slaving and bowing to others
I should have transcended above who i once was and walked away

But like a fool, i begged
I begged to remain a slave
I begged to remain faceless and walk among the lost

I screamed at the top of my lungs until my voice was gone
My bleeding eyes have no more tears to cry
I cursed god and myself and the day i was conceived
I cursed this whole fucking world before me for what i did to myself

There was nothing left for me except for pain
Starving and sleepless, i began to rot inside
I could no longer even fucking think without
Feeling disgusted in what i have become

Paranoia and lunacy constantly grew within the
Tattered remains of what was left of my sanity
I have nothing but anger and regret within my soul for
All that i've done for anybody i have ever loved

I don't give a fuck about this pathetic life anymore
I no longer have any interest in what this world can offer me
Pain is all that is left. it consumes me with every breath that i take
Pain is the only comfort left in this rotted hollow shell

You did this to yourself! you fucked yourself!

The thought of my demise soothes my jaded mind
I pray for the reward of death to whoever will answer my call

You did this to yourself! you fucked yourself!

I thought it was just another day
5 a.m, wake up to begin the daily grind
Another stupid fucking day of what i thought was happiness
Another stupid fucking day of being a slave

On this day, everything changed
My superficial life crumbled right before my eyes
On this day, i lost my fucking mind
I thought it was just another day

I thought it was just another day
Another stupid fucking day
On this day i died inside
