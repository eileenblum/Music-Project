My blood runs colder each day in this environment of fake smiles and empty formalities
I can see flesh and hear laughter but
There is no real sign of genuine emotion or intelligence
What little humanity left within me is constantly being chipped away
By each withered soul I see
This is not life
This is a game
This is the pinnacle of thousands of years of human existence
This is a game we all will lose
This is a game that we all will lose no matter how far ahead we think we are
I pretend to feel
I pretend to care
I pretend to live..
Just like you
I know I should feel something but instead I do as the rest
Of the world and just pretend
Feelings have done nothing but hold me back so I shut them out until I forgot how to feel
This
Game has turned what used to be my heart into a solid ball of ice all of my emotions have steadily been replaced with disgust
With each day that has passed I am numb where I used to be cold and I am cold where I used to feel
Scavengers surround
Me and wait for my death to consume who they think I am
My gratification comes from knowing that my disgust will always
Outweigh any false emotion you project
It is necessary to be less than human in order to survive this pathetic joke we call
Society
Your life is a joke
The cold blood that trickles through my body is the only sign of life that remains within me
I am
Perfection according to the laws of this world I am empty and devoid of human life...
Just like you
I pretend to smile
I pretend to care
I pretend to live...
Just like you
