We stand in awe before the presence of unadulterated power. so pure... so intense... the boundaries of my reality are torn
Apart. this is the kind of power that can make a coward feel like a man. this is the kind of power that makes a man into a
God we feel as one. we grow as one. the person i see in the mirror is no longer me. i am abhorrence. i am cruelty. i am
One as both yet i am nothing until i become complete our hate is my religion. our wrath is my salvation

Tread. i must submit. reveal our fate. as one. we mature as one, we adapt as one, we will prevail. i am divinity. i am
Complete. i have formed an unholy trinity with my cruelty and hate. my fragile physical form is the only human part left of
Me. this trinity defines the purpose of our existence. we exist to isolate and erase the mistakes of our past
