I embrace blasphemy.
I embrace heresy. 
And I denounce your apathetic god. 

I embrace blasphemy. 
I embrace heresy. 
And I denounce everything I once believed.

So many years Iâve ignored the signs to make myself believe itâs right. 
Live in fear of his power, believing twisted words. 
So many years Iâve looked the other way and refused to see the truth.
Iâve found my path to righteousness lies within myself. 

I embrace blasphemy.
I embrace heresy. [X2]

I embrace blasphemy.
I embrace heresy. 
And I denounce your apathetic god. 

I embrace blasphemy. 
I embrace heresy. 
And I denounce everything I once believed.

Faith is fear of that which canât be proved.  Faith is never questioning the power of something nobody can see. 
My faith is dead. I will not fear the wrath of he who turned his back on me. I lost my fear when I lost my soul. 
I do not deny your existence  I only deny your graceâ¦the grace that I felt when I lost everything. 
Take a look at me. Iâve become everything I never wanted to be. Believing in you has done nothing for me. 
I bless myself by believing in my own capabilities. Iâm capable more now than ever before. 
I bless myself by destroying whatâs left of who I used to be. Eradicating any weaknesses left within. 

If I still have a soul anymore let it be consumed with profanation. 
Religion no longer applies to me. Blessed is he who blesses himself.

Salvation awaits me. 
I piss on the image of my former self and I spit upon his beliefs. 
Iâll cut my own throat before I accept religious deceit. 
I donât want your church. I donât want your lies. You have nothing to offer me. 
I praise my strength. I praise my will. My god is myself. 

Pray out loud while youâre begging in the streets. 
Pray out loud while youâre lying though your teeth. 
Pray out loud as you take anotherâs life. 
Pray out loud and fill your soul with sin

Pray out loud [x2]

I embrace blasphemy.
I embrace heresy. 
And I denounce your apathetic god. 

I embrace blasphemy. 
I embrace heresy. 
And I denounce everything I once believed.
Everything I once believed
