Tonight i'm raising the dead. i lie awake.. another sleepless night. my stomach turns. i can see him fucking her
Now. you should have just killed the bitch. at least you know you're gonna see her in hell

She leads him by the hand to an empty bed... the bed where i used to sleep. his hand slips down between her
Legs, though he doesn't know her name. how could you still love such a whore? you have to make her bleed for
What she's done. i resurrect decayed skeletons that have been eating away at me over the years. i resurrect
Ancient skeletons that have been haunting me for far too long. tonight i raise the dead. i can only imagine the
Look of panic on her face when she sees us standing at her door with a loaded 12 gauge. you know she
Deserves what she gets. she needs to taste the pain that you've felt. i stare deep within my soul in search of a
Way to kill lingering memories. negative reciprocal is guiding me to the most effective resolution

Justify. rectify. justify. nullify. raise the dead within myself. raise the fucking dead to feed my vehemence
Tonight we're raising the dead. together we grow, together we persevere
