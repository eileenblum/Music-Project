Pray for the weak, God bless the deaf and the dumb. Where's the pride in watching our sons suffer? Democracy--the only way. Force-fed into starving mouths, now you're free. Kill their morals and social standards....all who oppose. Freedom is here. Destroy their past...their way of life. Reshape their world. Freedom is here. Burn this world until there's nothing left. Innocence is irrelevant. Nuclear war erases life. Scar the earth with their shadows. Violence begets violence. The cycle will not end until our kind ceases to be. Blood of those who've died justifying this world-wide killing spree. The only end: nuclear winter. Stop this madness before it's too late. No remorse. No Mercy. No life. Burn.
