I envision your face with a dead and empty stare. Not a tear will be shed for the loss of rotten flesh. I know that I will make you pay for the lives you've torn apart. I can't wait to see your carcass lying in a pool of blood. Now they see the real you. You were spineless all along. Poisoning the daily bread with your sickness and decay. All your scabs have fallen off. Your body bloody and exposed. Now it's time to face the truth: you've built the walls that trap you in. I will sew your eye lids together and blind you as you have blinded me. My eyes wide open, and now I see everything I should have seen before. I am coming to rip your life apart. Now is the time for you to pray in vain. The time is now. You have awakened the sleeping beast in me. Now revenge is mine. My pleasure is your pain. Waiting in silence, death fills the air. I can hear your heart pounding as you lie in your bed. Essence of Brutality-I drag the blade across your throat. Can you hear hell calling for you? I vomit on your fucking corpse. I smile as I watch you bleed. Justice has been served. Revenge is mine.
