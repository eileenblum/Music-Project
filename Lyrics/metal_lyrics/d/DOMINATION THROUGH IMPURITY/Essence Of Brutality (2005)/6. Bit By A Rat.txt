Rabid demon in the street knaws my flesh so it can feed. Blood pouring in the spot that i stand, makes a feast for the vermin attacking my hand. Attached to my palm, I scream. The burning pain it needs. Rabid beast knawing my flesh. It shakes and twists. I wish for death. Red, all I see. Rat won't let go. Devouring my fingers, watching blood flow. Rabies entering my veins, infection growing. No feeling but pain. I cannot escape this relentless attack. BIT BY A RAT. Conciousness fading fast. This scar will forever last. With red, fiery eyes it screams. Taken down by its disease. BIT BY A RAT
