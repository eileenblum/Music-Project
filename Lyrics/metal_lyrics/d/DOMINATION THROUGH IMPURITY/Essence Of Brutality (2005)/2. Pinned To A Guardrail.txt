Step out into traffic. Your life is lost....worthless. You can kill yourself now. You lie to others--lie to yourself. You live a lie. You can kill yourself now. I'm watching your death come around the corner....your brains splatter on the windshield. I'm laughing. I've watched you kill yourself through the years. Too late to salvage what's already gone. There's no peace with what's left behind. Empty shell of what used to be. I'm watching your limbs fly off your lifeless corpse.....me spit in your face as you die. I'm happy. Pin yourself to a guardrail. End your pathetic existence. You're dead to the world--dead to me. A bleeding waste of flesh is all I see. Your life is fading further away. DIE. Your violent death is here today.
