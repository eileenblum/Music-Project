Dyssentary develops. Suffer in starvation as your stomach eats itself. There is no light, only punishment for the crime of existence. Dyssentary devours. Your body is consumed. The disease of hate has taken you. Light is returned. Your death is revealed. This race is purified. Purify--rid the earth of lesser filth. Euthanize--murder those not fit for life. Purify--the time is come for genocide. Euthanize--millions of lives are nullified. Merciless murdering--no escape from the jaws of inhumanity. Death--the only escape. When you live under the reign of the beast. He promised prosperity....salvation....unity....lies. He lied. Burning flesh--the ashes rise into the night. Motherland--stained with the blood of impurity. Now your fuhrer is gone. Hail to his glory now. Fucking supremecy ended with cyanide. Now your fuhrer is dead. Hail to his glory now. Fucking stupidity ended with cyanide.
