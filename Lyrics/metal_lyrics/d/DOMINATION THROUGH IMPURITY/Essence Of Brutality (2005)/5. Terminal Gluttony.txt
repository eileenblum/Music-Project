Glutton--over consumption. Consume it all, everything in sight. No control, never-ending feeding frenzy. Laziness--don't move, let your dinner come to you. Lie in your filth. Expand and rot. Dig your grave. Eat the soil. Vomit. Bury yourself repeat. Keep digging. Eat yourself into the grave. The path is paved with the garbage on which you feed. Let your huger consume your every thought. Do not stop until you cease to be. Feed your fat ass. That's it, keep eating. Eat your life away. Keep filling your stomach until it bursts. You live in disgust with yourself. There is no cure where there is no will. Morbid obesity spreads throughout the masses like a disease. Self-control has become obsolete. We all must feed far beyond our needs.
