There's no escape. Hide you stupid cunt. Retribution is knocking at your door. I feel your presence. I hear you breathing. I must stop your blood from flowing. I follow your footprints. Stained with blood. Your lover lies bleeding on your bed. I walk into the bathroom. I smell your fear. My shadow lies upon you. Your end is near. I grab you by your hair and throw you in the bath tub. I run water over your face. I make you choke on your blood. Beg to me now. Beg for forgiveness. Plea to me now. Plea for your fucking life. No escape. Bleed. Choke for me. Bleed for me. Cry for me. Die for me. I wrap my hands around your neck and shove your head under the water. Take a deep breath. Inhale the liquid. The pain will stop when your lungs are filled. Slip away. I take your life away. I put an end to your stupidity. Your lies can't affect me now. All emotion turns to hate. My satisfaction arrives with your demise. I know you want to scream. Your dying eyes scream for you. Die for me.
