I am the lack of trust,
malformation of self-respect
I am cursed by internal void
I am re-designed organic lie

I'm not the one who can make your dreams come true
I leave scars, control all life
I'm your God now, as cold as ice
Read my lips, I'm the trigger for all pain

I am the seeds of hate,
mannequin of fear and corruption
I preach the words of scorn
I am your two faced God

I'm not the one who can make your dreams come true
I leave scars, control all life
I'm your God now, as cold as ice
Read my lips, I'm the trigger for all pain

I'm the core of all lies
self-destructively vain
core of all lies

I am the sound of rage
??
I feel no remorse
I'm reborn through your hate

I'm not the one who can make your dreams come true
I leave scars, control all life
I'm your God now, as cold as ice
Read my lips, I'm the trigger for all pain

I'm the core of all lies,
self-destructively vain
core of all lies

I'm the core of all lies

Core of all lies Core of all lies
Core of all lies Core of all lies
Core of all lies Core of all lies
Core of all lies Core of all lies
