Beware, I'm here to despise your master
I am the human machine filled up with hate
You are crawling under his eyes
Your ignorance makes you suck his lies

I don't care if your god rejects me
I'm already failed in front of his eyes
I've lost my faith in religion,
in excuses and lies

I don't believe in those twisted tales
how Jesus is paying our sins with his blood
Amen! I owe you nothing
you sick, old and weak nazarene

From where comes the guilt that we
have to carry inside our hearts?
Nazarene, we should crusify you again
From where comes the guilt that we
have to carry inside our hearts?
Nazarene, we should crusify you again

My christ is unconcerned
deaf by lies
frozen from inside
Christ in me is DEAD

I will erase all his words from your heart
to make sure that the flame won't ever rise again
I release myself from your guilt
from those excuses and lies

From where comes the guilt that we
have to carry inside our hearts?
Nazarene, we should crusify you again
From where comes the guilt that we
have to carry inside our hearts?
Nazarene, we should crusify you again
From where comes the guilt that we
have to carry inside our hearts?
Nazarene, we should crusify you again
From where comes the guilt that we
have to carry inside our hearts?
Nazarene
