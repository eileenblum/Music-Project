I show how others' pain can relieve my soul
I am a morbid face of mankind

I embrace all the things she considers too filthy
I suck pleasure from strangers' flesh
I crawl in vanity - hide my insanity
I tear apart your life again

cos' I can't help myself
I desire all in flesh
in its simplicity
I have found my way

Elegance in black    so cold
Elegance in black    in me
Elegance in black    so cold
Elegance in black    in me

I make her a victim of my sick addiction
I close my eyes from her suffering
chronic deception in this empire of lust
no-one can hold this flame forever

cos' I can't help myself
I desire all in flesh
in its simplicity
I have found my way

Elegance in black    so cold
Elegance in black    in me
Elegance in black    so cold
Elegance in black    in me
