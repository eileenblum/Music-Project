Shock is what you feel
when you see that you have to face all my sins

Truth always hurts, it's always painfull
and now it's too late to change my way

I am the years you lost
I am the tears you cry

Pride is dead in your soul
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Pray! That's all you can do...
That's all you can try out to heal the wounds that I caused

I am the years you lost
I am the tears you cry

Bleed...I'll make your soul bleed forever
Fear...I'll make your eyes blinded with fear
Bleed...I'll make your soul bleed forever
Fear...I'll make your eyes blinded with fear

Now take a look at yourself 
Your suffering eyes are full of tears
It is time to let me go
Say goodbye to the life we once had

I am the years you lost
I am the tears you cry

Bleed...I'll make your soul bleed forever
Fear...I'll make your eyes blinded with fear
Bleed...I'll make your soul bleed forever
Fear...I'll make your eyes blinded with fear

Distorted    Distorted
Distorted    Distorted
