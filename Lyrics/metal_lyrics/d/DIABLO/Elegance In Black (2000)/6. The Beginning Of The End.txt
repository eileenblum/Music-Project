A reflection of trauma pulls you under again
Your silent aggression turns to suicidal thoughts

Pain crawls without sound in your soul
Pain remains the same if your life goes on

All the glory of your life is slowly fading away
Your screaming inner voice, your crown of thorns

Pain crawls without sound in your soul
Pain remains the same if your life goes on

The beginning of the end
The beginning of the end
Corrodes your soul
The beginning of the end
The beginning of the end
Corrodes your soul

I say:
Pain crawls without sound in your soul
Pain remains the same if your life goes on

The beginning of the end
The beginning of the end
Corrodes your soul
The beginning of the end
The beginning of the end
Corrodes your soul
[Repeat verse]
