We come from north from the land of the thousand lakes
Only able to express ourselves with violence

Some of us waste their lives by drowning themselves in the bottle
Some of us live their lives saying nothing at all

It's not hard to see
that we're pleased to be
engaged to the circle of misery

We use no words to tell what is wrong with us
This desperate land needs its desperate ways

Some of us take the rope and hang themselves
Some of us live their lives avoiding that fall

It's not hard to see
that we're pleased to be
engaged to the circle of misery

Triumph of misery - that's all we have
Triumph of misery - in this ice-cold land
Triumph of misery - that's all we have
Triumph of misery - in this ice-cold...

Triumph of misery - that's all we have
Triumph of misery - in this ice-cold land
Triumph of misery - that's all we have
Triumph of misery - in this ice-cold land
