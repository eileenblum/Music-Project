It all starts from a broken dream
from a memory of disgraced human body
Your raped mind is tasting a bit of humiliation
The spirit that makes you want some more

A need to raise the flame of desire
to make your soul complete, divine
Every time you have to go beyond the pain
That is the price that you have to pay

We make penetration into our souls
To purify our minds
We replace love with pain
to clear out sights for life

Penetration
We replace love with pain
Penetration

A need to raise the flame of desire
to make your soul complete, divine
Every time you have to go beyond the pain
That is the price that you have to pay

A need to raise the flame of desire
To make your soul complete, divine
In this game both roles dominate each other
But without one there is no other

We make penetration into our souls
To purify our minds
We replace love with pain
to clear out sights for life

Penetration
We replace love with pain
Penetration
to clear out sights for life
