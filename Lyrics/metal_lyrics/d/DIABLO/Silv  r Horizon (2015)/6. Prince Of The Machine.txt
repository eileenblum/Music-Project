One for all when we are all done
He took the fall and passed it on
Somewhere out there
Out where our nightmare came true

So many things I should have said
Unspoken words vanish in death

Grief is the price we pay for love

We are drifting further apart
In this apocalypse of stars
Into the heart of the dark
With his Legacy

To be alive is more than just breathing
Remember to tell everyone
That you care when you see them
Be proud of yourself and
Don't be afraid prince of the machine

And i just can't find the right words to say
It is true that the deepest longing is silent
Farewell my Comrade to the wind of eternity
May we all meet there one day

Buried in flames but the memory remains
