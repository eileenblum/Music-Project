I have seen the future but it doesn't have a name
And I have become the sentinel of the lost world
In the cradle of despair

Our primal instinct to survive

Even if we are forever lost
We need someone to blame or design
A prophecy for us
This curse of the human race

"Now your captain has gone insane"

I have looked down the pinnacle of fear long and hard
And now I am too afraid to face myself
Cos' I've lost so much more then just my faith

Inability to construct a future

Even if we are forever lost
We need someone to blame or design
A prophecy for us
This curse of the human race

"Now your captain has gone insane"
But remember (my words) "one heart, one purpose" shall remain

Oh, I will give them one heart and one way to fear me
Here between hell and a hard place
As we travel across the universe
Uh, I connect our fate to the Serpent Holder

I disconnect myself from the pain
I've lost my sense of reality
Master, do you know my name?
Cos' I'm leading this freighter of souls to hell

Master, now you know my name

I'll never leave
I'll never fail

And when day and night becomes one
My mind is crystal clear
We share the same routine
We obey the Serpent Holder

We obey the serpent holder
