Marathon of life and death
They had a dream to take the place of God
The desire to bend the rules of existence

Soon we will sing the Anthem for Slavery
Who wants to live forever?
Once earth was the cradle of humanity
But a man overcame the gravity

The real secret of my magic
Lies in the technology
Incarcerated because of information
But now useful for a purpose once again

They locked me up in it's heart of steel
And throw away the key

Now I'm the bridge
Between mankind an machinery
"All hail Silver Horizon!!"
And it will rise from the ashes of insanity
"All hail Silver Horizon!!"

I've chosen to write this sequel
To the prophecy

So let the show begin
