Somewhere beyond our Solar system computer restarts
Experimental Cryotanks saved our souls
This point must be the watershed
Between desperation and hope

I cannot describe it as lunacy but it's extremely close
So now we're refugees in space heading into the void
I heard someone saying 'this can't be real'
But it's no longer our choice

This was a rude step away from our beloved Mother Earth
To save fuel and electricity some of us need to reborn...
Whole new meaning for the Final Frontier

This must be the year of Capricorn

Our Heavenly Father, hallowed be your name
Save our souls cos' we cannot turn this broken war machine
No, once it was precious
But now technology has failed us again

I am safe, but not saved
In Isolation no one can hear your scream

Now Earth is too far, too far to reach
We, as the keepers of this secret are set to
Keep the truth away from the other's eyes,
keep them forever blind

Our Heavenly Father, hallowed be your name
Save our souls cos' we cannot turn this broken war machine
No, once it was precious
But now technology has failed us again

I am safe, but not saved
In Isolation no one can hear your scream
