I knew my way, I can see it now so clear
I hear the sound of the heat alarm
But I feel no fear

Don't need you sun
To ever show its shine again
I'll switch on the brightest light
Soon I'll bring it in!

And it takes more then time we have to regain
What is lost inside of me

I drained those cells of heavy water out to waste
Accelerating chain reaction now
Brightens this traitors face

May this fallout be my piece of art now
Through all the alarms and warning lights
Will I pass

And it takes more then time we have to regain
What is lost inside of me

Despair! Insanity!
Show level 7 to me
Vengeance! Vanity!

Let the spirit of Vodyanoy wipe all away
Wipe it all away

Oh Thorium, lay eruption over me
Be my revenge
And the stars cry out my name forever
When I turn all black
To a shine, To a shine of a thousand suns

Take me, radiate me
Burning sensation like never before
Hold me, shine on me

For better and for worse
