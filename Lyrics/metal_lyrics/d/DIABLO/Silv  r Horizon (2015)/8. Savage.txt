Third round has begun
Stakes are getting higher
I pray for my soul
Pressure is crushing my mind

There is no winner in this game
Not anymore

Thoughts are running in circles
No relief in sight...

I became a savage
Just as I feard
An eye for an eye
Is the cause for this

Now the die is cast
Walls are closing in
Thoughts are running in circles
No relief in sight...

And I cannot even force myself to cry
Feeding the flames of hate for years to come
Radioactive contamination
Dreams of death, a reactor controlled by my dying flesh

With five keys in my hand
I will curse you all
I stare into the great abyss
But I feel no fear

I'm ready to unlock
Something unpredictable
I will make this
Journey to eternal oblivion
...And I wont fail

Soon there is no one alive to bury the dead
Inhaling radiation fumes

Forward to termination, I presume

Radioactive
Contamination

Radioactive
Contamination
