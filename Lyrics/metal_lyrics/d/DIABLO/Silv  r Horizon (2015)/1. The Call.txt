We had the liftoff during the war in 1944
I can still remember our journey to the heavens
Once and for all

This was my goal for many years
And I believed that nothing could go wrong

But back in mission control...
Oh, they knew...

Now I can see the flames on the outer surface
I'm paralyzed within
And I ask myself what can be done to fix it
Before it's too late

This was my goal for many years
And I believed that nothing could go wrong

But back in mission control...
Oh, they knew...

That our hope was long gone

All action stations, all action stations
Evacuation starts in sixty seconds
The call into the dark
And all this I have gone just for the fame
So say we all

Engine failure in fuel supply
The call into the dark
We must be patient beyond the pain

The call

Explosion on board
EECOM is now gone
This ship is out of control
Please, pray for our safe return

All action stations, all action stations
Evacuation starts in sixty seconds
The call into the dark
And all this I have gone just for the fame
So say we all

Now I watch Earth against
The black and uninviting vacuum
We're lost between Earth and the horizon

Across the light into the dark
...Into the dark
