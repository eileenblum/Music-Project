Once I I was playing God with deception and lunacy
"Deception and lunacy"
I used to measure the heavens
Although my soul was from hell

Now I dare not to look at myself
For me there is no cure "For me the is no impure"
I Twist the truth into something obscure
Far from profound and pure

It's true that love can change us
...But never quite enough

And I'll be goddamned
If I'm leading here before the day I die
Oh Gods, This makes me feel so sick inside

And I still dare not to speak the truth
About the things I've tried to leave behind
Preparing for suicide

Into the void

What once was courage is now a curse
I have a clue how I'll write my Final Verse
Through the airlock without a sound so gracefully
A humble man in front of the inevitable

I cannot change the past
Nor look into the future
