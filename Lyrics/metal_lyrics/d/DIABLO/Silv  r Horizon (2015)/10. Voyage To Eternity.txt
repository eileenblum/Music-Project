For me the curtain has now descended
Red light alarm
Colour of my skin begins to fade
Last technician on the stage
This machine is running out of time

The first requisite for immortality is death

As the stars look down as my witness
I'm heading into oblivion
Where my shadow will blend with the night
In this silence I can even hear
How Destiny is calling me
Back home across the sea far from pain and depravity

No more reason to pretend
This is the beginning of the end

And now, when there are
More days behind me than in front
Death is still waiting for me
In this Final Hour

Yet long after we're gone
Our voices will linger inside these walls
For as long as this ship remains

So now I have come to you...
With open arms
Through the tides of space and time
I am the last in line
And I cannot tie back the hands of time

No more reason to pretend
This is the beginning of the end

And now, when there are
More days behind me than in front
Death is still waiting for me
In this final hour

Yet long after we're gone
Our voices will linger inside these walls
For as long as this ship remains
On its voyage to eternity

Across the dark into the light

No air left in my oxygen supply

Across the dark into the light

Oh, it's so far away and yet it's still
Right here in my heart
