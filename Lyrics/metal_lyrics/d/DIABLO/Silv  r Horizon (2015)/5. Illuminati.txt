Once I had a dream about life
Something we can take for granted
Covenant in zero G

Oh, here I am staring out with empty eyes
We're among the star yet so alone
For years I've been so insincere
Making promises never for real again
I've caught myself from despair

The dark deference for paranoia and fear

Where do we go from here?
Take a look around you and you will see just what I mean
There are no signs to follow
Gods are no more the for you and me

And you don't need to hear the whole story
Just one chapter from this tragedy
If we stay here we may drown into the Ocean on Tranquility
The light can be so hard to find if we have faith only in death
