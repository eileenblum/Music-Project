(I KNOW YOUR HATE AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY
IT'S BETTER FOR YOU TO RUN THE OTHER WAY
BUT IF YOU INSIST WELL IF YOU CAN'T RESIST
JUST CUT THE BULLSHIT I AM HERE FOR YOU
CONDITION RED)

I suppose you'll never learn when it's time to admit your war is lost
So you keep pushing me without caring what is costs
You've tried so many times but I'm sure that you cannot beat the odds
You can bet your life for it cos I know what I'm talking about
Since there is no justice I will show you my lethal point of view
Fight fire with fire well that's not even near the truth
Eye for an eye results in making the whole world blind
But I'm not that kind of a man who can just leave behind
Show no mercy when you don't know what to say
Show no mercy is this the game you want me to play
Show no mercy release your anger show me your rage
Show no mercy then you will see if I care
