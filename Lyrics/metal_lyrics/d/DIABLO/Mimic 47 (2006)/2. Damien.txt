(GOD ONLY SEES THE PHILOSOPHER WHO IS LOST
GOD ONLY SEES THE BITTERNE AND BROKEN TRUST
GOD ONLY SEES THE PROPHET BLINDED BY LUST
GOD ONLY SEES DAMIEN)

You take what you can and some more
You take more than they can give
Me myself and I that is the only way you know
You are the devil in disguise, the prayer in neon lights
You've always tried to take your chance of someone else's misery
Inside you the hunger never sleeps
You're always you're always gaining more sympathy
You're something something that makes me creep
You're now reaching supremacy
You don't know the world called shame you don't even have a clue
I just wish that someone would shut your face for good
How low can you go with this you sleazy son of a bitch
You've crowed the line of decency but in the end well enjoy your tragedy
Inside you the hunger never sleeps
You're always you're always gaining more sympathy
You're something something that makes me creep
You're now reaching supremacy
