(AND THEY ASK WHERE IS YOUR GLORY GONE
ICON IS CRASHED DOWN
QUESTIONS LYING OVER YOU MIMIC 47)

You role the dice lice never before you know this game
Your future is already written for you take all the blame
When all the fingers start to point at you
You need to pray c'mon you can't deny that you wouldn't
Do anything for the victory
Great victories in the past will be erased
They'll find all your sins
Feel their malicious breath on your neck
Now the show begins
The worst nightmare of your life has begun
You fell adrenalin pounding in your veins
Cold sweat on your skin
Life flashes before your eyes
You're just human waste
