(HATE IS THE FUEL TO THE FIRE REVENGE THE MOST SATISFYING FEELING IN THE WORLD
NEVER FORGIVE NEVER FORGET OBEY THE MASTER OF THIS SHADOW WORLD)

Revolution of lies and greed is here ready to ki your a goodbye
Guided by the man who can twist the truth, the truth as he likes
He is the preacher of commercial suffering where there's a way
There's a will
You will testify this new king of fools, of fools like you
This is the king that you cannot mi, he doesn't scream that good old 666
He's offering a new kind of a bli uh yeah
