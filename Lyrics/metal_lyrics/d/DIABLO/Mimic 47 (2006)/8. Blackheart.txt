(BLACKHEART I'LL BECOME BLACKHEART BLACKHEART)

The pride is surrounding me seducing me holding me
Altering my perception of reality
What's wrong with me am I drive by the desire of vanity
Aggression in these words I speak circle of anger is now released
I cannot see what it means cos I'm enslaved by my own will
The pride is controlling me corrupting me abusing me
Feeding my my mind with thoughts that are not real
Now I cannot feel when the dark is closing on me
