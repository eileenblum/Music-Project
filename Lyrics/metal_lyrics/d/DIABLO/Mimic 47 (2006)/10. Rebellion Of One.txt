(THEY'VE TRIED TO CHANGE ME BREAK ME
FORCE ME TO BE SOMETHING I'M NOT
I DON'T WASTE MY TIME TO BLAME THEM
I JUST KEEP ON GOING WITH MY REBELLION OF ONE)

Hey I try to let go but I know that they will remind me
Of the past and all the things I've done I cannot believe this
How could I be so blind blood is thicker than water but
Now this shit has gone too far
Deep down inside me it's screaming endlessly
Rage keeps me alive rage won't ever die
To see things the way I do just walk a mile in my shoes
Cos I know what it fells like
When someone tries to steal the air I breathe
Blowin' out my flame scorn and disbelief partnership for my needs
I'm going nowhere fast and now there is no turning back
