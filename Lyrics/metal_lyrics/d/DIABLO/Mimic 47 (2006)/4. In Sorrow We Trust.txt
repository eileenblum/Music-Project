(NO ONE KNOWS NO ONE SEES NO ONE CAN SHARE NO ONE CAN FEEL IT BUT WE DON'T CARE
THE DESTINATION IS UNKNOWN FOR US BUT IN SORROW WE TRUST)

I know a man who's still brave enough to say things straight without
Hiding behind those cryptic words and that strength will last until the world burns
I will always remember those words he used to say better not to have been born
Than to live without glory and that man has now reached the point of no return
He's got nothing to lose nothing to win he doesn't have to pretend anything
Against our lives yours and mine is lady fortune not so kind
Still we want to face her as one sharing our future as it comes
