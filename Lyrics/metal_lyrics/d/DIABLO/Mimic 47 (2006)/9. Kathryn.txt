(KATHRYN I SEE YOU DON'T BELONG HERE
WHERE HEAT IS ON CAN'T YOU SEE YOU'RE FEEDING ME
YOUR FLESH SO BITTERSWEET IT'S KILLING YOU IT'S KILLING ME BABY)

It's 5 in the morning and she is starting at the doorway somewhere out of touch
She fells the rain falling down on her face and her tears tell us something about her state
Only in the shadows of the night she is safe from the nightmares the pain felt in daylight
Soon she'll realise that here everything is nothing and her heart will be broken once again
