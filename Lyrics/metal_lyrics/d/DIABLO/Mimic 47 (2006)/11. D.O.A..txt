(D.O.A. SOMETIMES I FELL IT'S CHASING ME
D.O.A. SOMETIMES SOMETIMES I FELL IT'S CHANGING ME
D.O.A. SOMETIMES I FELL IT'S TAKING ME
D.O.A. THIS TIME I FELL IT'S KILLING ME)

It's pain from the start all your dreams are ripped apart
You fall down with this shit with all this hate
With this creature of mine shut me out of your life
Before I reach your heart poison in poison out
We tear ourselves apart
Behind my eyes I keep my truth away from you
I can say that there is nothing new
I've got way to keep you by my side
Holding you till you till you decline
Like disease where I dwell
I leave ruins wherever I roam now you see
I cannot change I cannot feed your love
You told me this you told me that
Ha just like talking to a deaf can't you see
We are on a journey through unforgiving hell
The price I pay in the end will make even angels cry
My hourglass of hope is now running empty of sand
I've tried to run I've tired to hide
But everything remains the same
And all the love that you have bled
