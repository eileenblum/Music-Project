(NOW YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR YOU'VE BECOME A PATHETIC
PORTRAIT OF MANKIND SEARCHING FOR THE SENSATION AT ANY COST
YOU AND YOUR TWO FACED GOD ARE TOGETHER AS LOST)

Your devotion for this new faith
Makes me sick makes me see red
Behold that human sacrifice
Fourteen years on the road
Straight to hell and now
I have I have this story to tell
You must be blind cos you can't see this
The thin line between their love and hate exists
But your way of life is something
Something that no one can fix
