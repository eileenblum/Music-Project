Flesh is all that you want,
it's all that you see in this
crushing game of yours
Life itself never satisfies
you in your twisted act in
this theatre of power

Perfection in pleasures,
fatal flash of joy
And no-one will ever cross
this infernal love

Can't you see what you're doing
to those who believe in you
and your psychotic eyes
Smile on your face, insanity!
They belong to your circle of misery

Perfection in pleasures,
fatal flash of joy
And no-one will ever cross
this infernal love

All hail, hail the flesh!
You never care of anything else
All hail, hail the flesh!
You never care of anything else

Just sacrifice everyone
in the name of your god
but remember that your time will come
Sick addiction, and years tradition
Pride has been taken away from your soul

Perfection in pleasures,
fatal flash of joy
And no-one will ever cross
this infernal love

All hail, hail the flesh!
You never care of anything else
