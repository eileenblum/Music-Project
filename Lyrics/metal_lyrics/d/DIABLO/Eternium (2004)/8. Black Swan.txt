I hate myself and my way of life
This time it makes me bleed from inside
Cos I was too weak to stand by your side
and now it's too late for me to say goodbye

Crying into the night,
that's the only thing that I can do
Cos now those wings of darkness are holding...

I blame myself and this choice of mine
Sometimes I just can't make things right
When I turn around and look into your eyes
I know that dreams, they will die

Crying into the night,
that's the only thing that I can do
Cos now those wings of darkness are holding you!

Black swan of death
The game has come to the end
Black swan of death
The game has come to the end
to the end!

Crying into the night,
that's the only thing that I can do
Cos now those wings of darkness are holding you!

Black swan of death
The game has come to the end
Black swan of death
The game has come to the end
