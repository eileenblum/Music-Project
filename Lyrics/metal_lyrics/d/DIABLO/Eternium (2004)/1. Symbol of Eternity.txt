Here we go!

You can take me back to the place
where I could watch the sky
and see those signs!
You can show me their lies,
show me the disbelief in their words
Oh, these burning times!

And now, I can choose my fate
Within my heart I will seal the symbol of eternity!

You can take me back to the time
where I could stand so proud
with my mind open wide!
You can wash away all those lies,
the burning rain which blinds my eyes
curses my way!

And now, I can choose my fate
Within my heart I will seal the symbol of eternity!

You can take me back to the dimension,
to the state of mind
where I could be myself again!
You can clear my mind,
you can clear my thoughts
You can take away
all these fears from my soul!

And now, I can choose my fate
Within my heart I will seal the symbol of eternity!

I'll open my heart and turn my head against the northern wind
I will listen to the call, call of the eternity!
