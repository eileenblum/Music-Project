Voi perkele!

The time has come for you and me
To reveal the truth from inside
I am not of the kind you want me to be
I'm going nowhere but down

Forgive me father for my sins
Forgive me for the things I have done
Hey, just look at me I know the reason
You just can't see it from that far

When you look into my eyes
You see a dead part of your life
We are still together as one
In your world, build on silence and greed

Forgive me father for my sins
Forgive me for the things I have done
Hey, just look at me I know the reason
You just can't see it from that far

I will go on my way from the cradle to the grave
I am the one who you should not blame
Take care of your soul, I'll take care of my own
Cos you make me a preacher as you know

Forgive me father for my sins
Forgive me for the things I have done
Hey, just look at me I know the reason
You just can't see it from that far

I will go on my way from the cradle to the grave
I am the one who you should not blame
Take care of your soul, I'll take care of my own
Cos you make me a preacher...
Cos you make me a preacher as you know
