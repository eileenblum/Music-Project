I can remember the times
When the grace was
shining on my face
Don't you see, don't you feel
those days are gone
They've vanished in the air.
Now I could not care less
of you and your poisoned mind
cos I have already seen
this thousand times

My emotions are hidden
in a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
that we once shared
on these frontlines,
frontlines of mysteries!

Oh hell yeah!

I can remember the love
At some point it became
one with my hate
I can see how
you are wasting your life,
wasting your dignity
The light in my eyes is fading away
But I bleed no tears
cos I know your destiny

My emotions are hidden
in a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
that we once shared
on these frontlines,
frontlines of mysteries!

How blind can you be?
Don't you know what I mean?

Love divided, love divided
Extending agony!
Love divided, love divided

I hate your empty words
and the grin on your face, ah!

My emotions are hidden
in a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
that we once shared
on these frontlines,
frontlines of mysteries!

How blind can you be?
Don't you know what I mean?

Love divided, love divided
Extending agony!
Love divided, love divided

I hate your empty words!
