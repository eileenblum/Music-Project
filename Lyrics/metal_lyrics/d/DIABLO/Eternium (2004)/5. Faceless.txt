I am no-one
I am no-one to judge you
who cannot read between their lies
Oh, I can't blame you

They're hiding into the shadows
of those words
Guiding you into the sea of lies
Never telling you
who is god of all this misery

I am no-one
I am no-one to take the
pain away from your soul
Wake up and open your eyes

They're hiding into the shadows
of those words
Guiding you into the sea of lies
Never telling you
who is god of all this misery

Wake up!

Faceless
You will hate yourself
Faceless
In the end of the line you will see

I am no-one
I am no-one to save you
But I still can't understand why
they have done this to you

They're hiding into the shadows
of those words
Guiding you into the sea of lies
Never telling you
who is god of all this misery

They're hiding into the shadows
of those words
Guiding you into the sea of lies
Never telling you
who is god of all this misery!!

Faceless!
