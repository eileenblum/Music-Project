What kind of a man is a man
who lives in the kingdom of tyrants
What kind of a man is a man
who calls you with the voice of sirens
That man hates everything
in you and your existence
That man takes everything
from you and gives you nothingness

Still you keep crawling before his eyes
Still you refuse to,
refuse to reach into the light
and the pattern keeps repeating itself

What kind of a man is a man
who can blame someone else for his sins
What kind of a man is a man
whose image becomes clear
when darkness descends
That man does not have a name,
some call him Master
That man does not give you choice
Still you feel some kind of attraction

Still you keep crawling before his eyes
Still you refuse to,
refuse to reach into the light
and the pattern keeps repeating itself

God of reptiles!
God of reptiles!
Beware!
God of reptiles!
God of reptiles!

You will betray yourself, you will
You will hate yourself, you will
You will lose yourself, you will
You will see your finger on the trigger

You will see, you will feel
That your world is in flames
And everything you've got is emptiness
You will see, you will feel
That this is not a game
And your god is merciless

Still you keep crawling before his eyes
Still you refuse to,
refuse to reach into the light
and the pattern keeps repeating itself

God of reptiles!
God of reptiles!
Beware!
