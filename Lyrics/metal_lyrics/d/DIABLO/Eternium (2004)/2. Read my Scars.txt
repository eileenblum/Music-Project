Soon they will see what I mean
When I've said that stones won't bleed
So that they don't have to waste
their lives wondering why
They've been dreaming all these years
All these years I've been hurting
It is my answer to their world,
to everything I see

Have you ever seen
the weight of the world
crushing someone's soul
You will see me in hell cos
I have opened myself
for this god of emptiness

I have painted it in my flesh
So that the whole world can see
There is something very cold in me
they don't want to believe
I've said stay away from me
from my sick morality
My life goes on without your love,
without your prayers now

Have you ever seen
the weight of the world
crushing someone's soul
You will see me in hell cos
I have opened myself
for this god of emptiness

Read my scars!
Read my scars, it's okay for me baby!
Read my scars!
Read my scars, it's okay for me baby!

Have you ever seen
the weight of the world
crushing someone's soul
You will see me in hell cos
I have opened myself
for this god of emptiness

Read my scars!
Read my scars, it's okay for me baby!
Read my scars!
Read my scars!
