Welcome...
Welcome to my world of hate,
damnation of my soul
Here we could be together
with my dreams of death, you know!

Tell me what you feel
My queen of entity

Welcome...
Welcome to this bitter
state of my mind
I'm a dying dream
This is my imitation of life
Replica of sanity, yeah!

Tell me what you feel
My queen of entity

This isn't love,
it's something else
Still you can't see
why my heart belongs to you
with all it's secrecies

But I hold the key just one more time
and I open myself for you
But I hold the key just one more time
I would love to kill myself for... you.

Tell me what you feel
My queen of entity

This isn't love,
it's something else
Still you can't see
why my heart belongs to you
with all it's secrecies

But I hold the key just one more time
and I open myself for you
But I hold the key just one more time
I would love to kill myself for you, queen of entity!
