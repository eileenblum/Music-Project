Again I find myself in this confusing state of mind
From a place that I once tries to left behind
Now I know that I can't survive
In this labyrinth of sin has taken my soul

Misfortune along my side
Of killing kind

I can't find a way out of this state of mind
God only knows how hard, how many times I have tried to
I cover up the lies, I cover up the lies
Those empty words produced by my broken soul

Misfortune along my side
Of killing kind

Difference well hidden in insensibility
Holding only hatred
A contradiction from which emotions arise
Catch 22

Self-commited suicide
It seems to be the choice of mind
Maybe I'm weak but I can't stand the pain that I cause
Now I know that I am one step closer
To the end of this meaningless life

Misfortune along my side
Of killing kind

Difference well hidden in insensibility
Holding only hatred
A contradiction from which emotions arise
Catch 22
