I'm looking back at my life
And what do I see?
So many times of pain, sorrow and agony
My life has fallen from grace

Ten years ago they used to say
Let go, everything remains the same
Piece by piece my dreams fell down
The world is becoming colder

Memories lie six feet under
Screaming for vengeance
Holding tight on our lives
Losing faith once again

Ten years ago they used to say
Let go, everything remains the same
Piece by piece my dreams fell down
The world is becoming colder... everyday

Face the hollow point in me
The hollow point in my soul once again

I bleed no tears
I feel no sorrow
I reborn through hate
When I hold those dreams in my heart
