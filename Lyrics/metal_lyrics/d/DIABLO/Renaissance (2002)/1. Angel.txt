I prepare for war inside my head
I close my eyes and reach the point
Where everything is meaningles
You strike on my nerves
You have dragged me down

But now I'll do the same what you've been doing to me
Before you can say a word
I'm gonna get you, break you and throw you away

[pre:]
Can't you see your oncoming suffering?
Why can't you see the revelation?

The pressure of blood is singing in my ears
When I heard that you've been spreading lies around me

I strike with fear A cry of war

And I pull the strings that you hold before
I will pretent the shock wave of your life

[pre:]
Can't you see your oncoming suffering?
Why can't you see the revelation?

[chorus:]
Today you see the end of the line
'Cos now my hatred is open wide
Then you will know who I am in this game
The Angel of Revenge

You're about to see what is like to be haunted and nailed down
My lust for war will lead us to this bitter state

Where pain is so real and paralyzing

The price we have to pay
But like a phoenix I rise
To tear your soul apart
