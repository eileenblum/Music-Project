When I see the reconstruction of souls
Evolution that is built on lies
I just watch how they create
This so called new form of life

"Should I glorify those who will
lead the blind, and preach the words
that they don't even know?"

And when I hear those twisted lies
Just some seductive stories
I wonder how you can be
So anxious to swallow it

"Should I glorify those who will
lead the blind, and preach the words
that they don't even know?"

No... one cares for your soul
No... one cares what you feel
I don't see how you can survive
In this cold atmosfea

As I watch your empty world
Amplified by that spiritual void
I can only close my eyes
And pray for God to save your soul

"Should I glorify those who will
lead the blind, and preach the words
that they don't even know?"

No... one cares for your soul
No... one cares what you feel
I don't see how you can survive
In this cold atmosfear
