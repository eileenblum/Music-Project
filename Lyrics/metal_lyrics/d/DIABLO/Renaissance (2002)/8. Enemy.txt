Now as the days are becoming much more shorter
You journey is slowly reaching the end
Cold wind reminds you of me
As you crawl on this frozen soil

Life filled with hate
I am leaving the scars
That make you bleed
The bloodred tears

Now coldness reaches your flesh
And frost creeps into your heart
Again I drift to my past life so fake, so wrong
I am the creation of lies what you told
And I'm feeding the pain I never reach for

Life filled with hate
I am leaving the scars
That make you bleed
The bloodred tears

You start to sound like a broken enemy
Enemy... enemy
As the last leaf floats on the soil
