Onve we were able to see
Behind this shroud of mystery
Searching for the truth
Searching for some signs fo divinity

Presentation of souls
So much suffering
The truth cannot be found
Without facing reality

Now we are lost in this maze
Unable to communicate
Suffer from the life which was
Burnt at the stake of vanity

Presentation of souls
So much suffering
The truth cannot be found
Without facing reality 

Behold those Creatures of Deception

We have become so weak
Cynic, so insecure
Now we can not even see
What is behind this heresy
