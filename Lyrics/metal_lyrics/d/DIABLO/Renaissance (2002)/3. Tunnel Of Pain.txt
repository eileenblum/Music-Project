I can't deny that I want to see
Through your soul, through severity
But I'm afraid of knowing
When kind of a sight
When kind of a message I will find

My crusade is doomed to fail
But I still carry on
Like father like son
I'm frozen inside

I know that I can get lost on this
Left hand side of the path
As you can see
My time is running short
In resisting the decaying of my soul

My crusade is doomed to fail
But I still carry on
Like father like son
I'm frozen inside

I begin to see
When my role will be
In this Tunnel of Pain
