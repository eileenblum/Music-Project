Please, just take a look at her soul
She belongs to lies
Enslaved by the desire
To dance on your grave
For all this you can't blame
But yourself

You never know what is
Going on in her fantasies
You never care about reality
You always think that you can resist
The pleasures that she is
Holding inside

Now you're blinded
By those moments you shared
...Perversions...
You will become a slave to higher level of pain
She's the one to take your breath away

You never know what is
Going on in her fantasies
You never care about reality
You always think that you can resist
The pleasures that she is
Holding inside

Icon of flesh... no more, no less
