Screaming I'm falling deeper into depression
Four walls around me. Oh, what have I done?

Even asleep I cannot know if I'm awake
This is what it feels like to lose control

Deny me. Another nail to pierce my skin with blame
I feel shame for the sin I know I can't make up

No more reasons to live and breathe
This what it takes to reach the end

I know my life is getting harder day by day
Now I don't know what to do or what to say

I have been counting down my days but I see no release
I cannot save me from myself as you will see

Through difficulties to defeat
...That's the way the wind blows down here

Through difficulties to defeat
...Tears are just a waste of good suffering
