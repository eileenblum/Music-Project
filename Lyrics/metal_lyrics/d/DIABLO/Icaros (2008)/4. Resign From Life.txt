So here I am, conjuring the ghost of Cain
I was born into this world,
one foot in the grave
but you can still see the grin on my face

Soon I will come and go,
out of order, raving through the show
Trembling hands, smell of death
I disregard bone and flesh

No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try
You still cannot face what I have become
It's never me, it's never you
There's nothing else, there's nothing new
But I've just got one more thing to say:

"Yes, I am my brother's keeper"

Hey, now I have reached the point
where there's nothing left to say

I am crusading on this serpent of disgrace

Life, just one more,
just one more connection to let go
Well, let's propose a to for the loss!

Destiny waits for no one
and now my time is near
I will resign, resign from life

Now I have given all the excuses I could give
Still you try to read between the lines,
keep acting like you knew it all
