The sign of target is painted red,
the trial shall begin
A new form of supremacy
One more declaration of war

The pulse of death is now released,
unstable killing machine
Tearing down the state of illusion
Slaughter of believes

...Propaganda...
...Lack of Faith...
...Circle of insanity...

Oh, Lord, I don't know how to
forgive to this messenger of agony

...Cult of submission...
...Pathological addiction...
...Revolutionary transformation...

Behold the disciple,
of tyranny and fame

Cross my heart and hope to die
Clock is ticking your 15 minutes of prime time
You will become a part of the show

"Living Dead Superstar"
The last episode of your story cannot be rewound
