A heart is broken, another prayer in vain
It was the moment, oh, when all began
Angel of sleepless nights
I barely know your name
but I can see you even
if you're a million miles away

Navigation for desire
for the flesh and for nothing else
In the still of the night
the poison calls her name
And she feeds her soul
with the needle of deceit
before million eyes
in the great dark hall of fame

A disciple of the new God
who has no name
designer of unknown
Adoring servant for everything
between zero and one

Chagrin
A dream of insanity

I have never even heard your voice
but I miss you so

Chagrin
I thought I knew it all

but the more things change the more
they will stay the same
