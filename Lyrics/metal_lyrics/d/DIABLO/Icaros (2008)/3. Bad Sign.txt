He was born in a place
where the shadows
grow upon the grain

Not far from here

It was the time when dreams
were taken away
Oh, it flings him down to despair

And he can't cry for what it might have been like
He can't 'cos he has no more tears
Now he is standing in silence,
holding his breath
Before they know it the blood runs red

One
"For the pain"
Two
"For the shame"
Three and four
"Just in case"
No need for words
Eight will be a secret

Bad Sign

He can't take back all the things he has done
Redemption will remain

He has frozen his fate
and now it's far too late
to find the reason to go on
