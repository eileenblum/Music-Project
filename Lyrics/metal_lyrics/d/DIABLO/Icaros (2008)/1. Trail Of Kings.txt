Time's up, you cannot change a thing,
cannot regret, cannot explain
When all the mistakes
have been cast
you try to take your freedom
with eight shotgun blasts

Right now you don't know what to say
Cannot find no-one else to blame
This time you have gone too far
This time you can kiss your ass goodbye

Soon you will see that justice takes it's toll
No, the punishment will knock you out of the door
There's no excuse. There's nothing in your sight
No-one to help you out, to help you find your peace of mind

Old man you're wasting your breath
Trail of kings is far ahead
There is no grace in your defeat
Your suffering will be legendary even in Hell

Trail of Kings
