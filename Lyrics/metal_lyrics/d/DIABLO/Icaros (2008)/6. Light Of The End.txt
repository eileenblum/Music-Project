I came from nothing
into existence, to live
from your shame

And right by your side
is where I'll stand
Your journey begins
and ends with me

I am the way the truth
and the life and my
salvation is for sale

So if you're looking for a shelter
just stick around
I'll seal your fate

In this land of temptation...
well, I know how sorrow creeps
So pray with me,
children of the night
I'm alway on your side
Until the end of time

Follow me into the
light of the end
Oh, I say... Follow me
A heart that bleeds will never die
Amen!
