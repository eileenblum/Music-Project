If you dislike to wade into my water
I'll only end up losing
I am Moses without the beard
and I saw a greater sun appear
among the muses
in the sunlit corner
some distance from the rattler
I found that favour
cutting all the pieces to size
this time I'll be braver than before
it makes no sense infecting all the people
it feels alright to find a few
I mixed an eye-salve for your blind eyes
let you see what I see
the vultures eat your mind
among the muses
in the sunlit corner
some distance from the rattler
I found that favour
being just like mine
open wide the doorway
just give me four quieter minutes in the park
seven reasons to laugh
six monkeys and a harp
five senses come apart
four pieces I regret
3,2,1...
my last cigarette
here in the sunlit corner
I found that peace
being just like
mine
