He sat and blinked
safe in his partly drenched old-fashioned seat
and licked his lips
I know for sure he'd like a brandy, neat
he sat and smiled
in tribute pauses faced a consequence
the subject made him able to ignite the speculum glance
I will sing you the sad song of the elephant man
trying to get off the stages because he never had performance plans
don't you know you are the sad song of the elephant man
heat and flame
burn down the stage
before the final nail is driven in
in finest bodily proportion he could let me stare
get rid of the unwanted fat
he said and eyed me up, bared
your adaption is a fake that makes me shudder so
pile on the pounds or cut your candy fingers off
garlands hang low
I will sing you the sad song of the elephant man
trying to get off the stages because he never had performance plans
don't you know you are the sad song of the elephant man
heat and flame
burn down the stage
before the final nail is driven in
