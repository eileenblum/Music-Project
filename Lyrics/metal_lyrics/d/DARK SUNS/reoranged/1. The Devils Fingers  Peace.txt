And then came the time when alone his naked body wallowed in the wooden mud of a
pandemonium forest
every night
walking over the edge's green
my body's aching since I've jaded for the spotlight will
an applauding tune
skills bound tendency
you faked it perfectly
you pulled the strings like every boy plays real life with a toy
walking over the edge's green
drink water from the spine
the offer is notorious but I won't refuse
every dread a pill
entrusted milk I spill
you hear my call across the water
drink to me when your bodies expose
her body sweats no more
it keeps me waiting
completely naked
sinking to the floor
walking over the edge's green
swim over fields of gold
I slipped into the Hamlet pose
a continuous prose
let the fever run
I am the orange one
count the lambs that scamper by
before we fall asleep tonight
before we fall asleep
I could gently keep on doin' what I like
her body sweats no more
it keeps me waiting
completely naked
sinking to the floor
and the last thing that you will see
the devil fingers' peace
