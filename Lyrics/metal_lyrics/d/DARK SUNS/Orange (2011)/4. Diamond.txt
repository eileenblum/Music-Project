Here in the private dark
you are the brightest spark
nap on my lap and hark
there is no transience
I feel the permancence
you are the real essence
shine, little diamond shin
you keep me alive
shine, let the diamond shine
shine, you're the purest I've ever seen
still my heart is in ashes
I'm a neophyte of love
still my heart is in ashes
I'm a neophyte of love
shine, little diamond shine
you keep me alive
shine, let the diamond shine
shine, you're the purest one I'ver ever seen
