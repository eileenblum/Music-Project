This is all that I can bring today
somehow I don't know the sum will tell
some ideas might be good, some not
separate the brilliant from absurd
calculate the price for every speed
welcome home, come in, sit down and eat
this is all that I can bring today
somehow I don't know the price we'll pay
what if the extracted ones unfold
just before the latest haul is sold
don't you think we'll both the scaffold meet
welcome home, come in, sit down and eat
flowers are closed and lambs are sleeping
while the birds are silence keeping
flowers are closed and lambs are sleeping
I composed the very night
here's the place where I can hide
turn a blind eye to the day
the people we betrayed
here I carry on the dream
goin' back to the edges' green
to redeem the scars of life
for just another dive
the feast is over
this is all that I can bring today
somehow I don't know the price we'll pay
in the alphabetic sort sequence
indicate the most extravagance
what if only one of the extracted thoughts repents
let me go before the test will end
scared to knock when all the knuckles bleed
don't you think we'll both the scaffold meet
please let the children know not of our crime
we've pretended every thought was mine
from the gramophone a bitter suite
welcome home, come in, sit down
flowers are closed and lambs are sleeping
while the birds are silencing keeping
flowers are closed and lambs are sleeping
I composed the very night
here's the place where I can hide
turn a blind eye to the day
the people we betrayed
here I carry on the dream
goin' back to the edges' green
to redeem the scars of life
for just another dive
