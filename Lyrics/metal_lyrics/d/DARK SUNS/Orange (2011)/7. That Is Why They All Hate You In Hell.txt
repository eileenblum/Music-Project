Wells were dry beside the door
we came here in anticipation
double feet
enormous speed
unsettle my congratulation
parody fills lungs for free
a handshake for your armageddon
flip a coin who pays the debts
drink until the fear subsides
you spell it wrong but read it right
she's very coy 'bout her own age
she trades in torn off human body parts
kindly brave another slave
declaiming loudly to the world
I know my curse
have crowns in my purse
my flesh is weak
I pay for every creep
while the bitches talking high
climb into (the) chariot
climb into (the) chariot
they might have seen my blood
wells were dry beside the door
we came here in anticipation
double feet
enormous speed
bedevil my congratulation
parody fills lungs for free
for now bid farewell armageddon
before you go out
pay the rest
my harp that once its music shed
me often through the arches led
lies broken in the chariot's wreck
my cape, the key, my god...
I've lost my head
