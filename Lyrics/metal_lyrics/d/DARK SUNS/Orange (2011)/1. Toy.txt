Walking over the edge's green
my body's aching since I've jaded for the spotlight will
an applauding tune
skills bound tendency
you faked it perfectly
pulled the strings like every boy plays real life with a toy
walking over the edge's green
drink water from the spine
the offer is notorius but I won't refuse
every dread a pill
entrusted milk I spill
hear my call across the water
drink to me when your bodies expose
Sing with me that song
I spread my wings today
Get round to bend my way
