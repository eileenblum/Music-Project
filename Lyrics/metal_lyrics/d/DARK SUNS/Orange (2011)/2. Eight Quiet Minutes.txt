If you dislike to wade into my water
I'll only end up losing you
I am Moses without the beard
and I saw a greater sun appear
among the muses
in the sunlit corner
some distance from the rattler
I found the favour
cutting all pieces to size
it makes no sense infecting all the people
it feels alright to find a few
I mixed an eye-salve for the blind
let you see what I see
the vultures eat your mind
among the muses
in the sunlit corner
some distance from the rattler
I found that favour
being just like mine
open wide the doorway
and give me eight quiet minutes in the park
seven reasons to laugh
six monkeys and a harp
five senses come apart
four pieces I regret
3, 2, 1...
my last cigarette
