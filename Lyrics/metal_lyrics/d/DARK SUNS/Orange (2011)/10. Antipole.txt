Hide me under buildings
fix me in a wall
cage me down the sea bed
otherwise you fall
mighty spirit cleansing, burning
may all your love convince antipole
nevermore to judge alone from what henchmen spray
demons on the rise committed human eyes to serve it
hide me under buildings
fix me in a wall
cage me down the sea bed
otherwise you fall
I was torn between the stages
until he broke me beyond repair
hear me now
I'll try to walk on with no body
I am one of those that fly the highest
fall the hardest
everyone felt the same
when my life became corrupted in the bane
now to your great dismay
a coin on my forehead lay
burn me away
and this is for all I bedevilled to swear
my certain shame to bear
mighty spirit cleansing, burning
may all your love convince antipole
nevermore to judge alone from what henchmen spray
demons on the rise committed human eyes to serve it
and this is for all I bedevilled to swear my certain shame to bear
I speak to you now as I close my eyes
I'm sorry for my despite
I'm smeared with the gold of the opulent sun
depraved your purity again
