You haunted from the cradle in the chamber room
unseen, declined, denied
a human torch deserves no fever
if you see the horrors we defy
I told you we could easily exchange another fear
handle it softly, tenderly or else it will appear
your alien hand landed on my skin
we embraced each other tight and became one
is anybody there
are you in my dreams
how alienated I feel
silence became loud
reanimate our nerves
one mind, divided when the synapse trees collide
I'm tangled in your spiral maze
electrified by all the things we hide
I told you we could easily eexchange another fear
handle it softly or else it will appear
your alien hand landed on my skin
we embraced each other tight and became one
is anybody there
are you in my dreams
how alienated I feel
silence became loud
here I am, so...
save me
love me
find me
bring me home
