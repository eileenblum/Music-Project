âIntension:
Lay down these habits of a vanished past
forget them for a while and quit
too many hours cursed by false lies
enough of modest advices
cause first and foremost I decide

âIntervention:â
Shallow clones performing copies of a copy
faces swirling into semblance
I think it's only human to appreciate...
who nailed man to laterally masking attitudes?
who nailed man to envy?

âIntuition:â
Am I sleeping in between the right and left halves of your brain?
...just open wide and set me free
Am I sleeping?
