"You're a mysterious human being
For all your vitality turned in on yourself
And maybe I have never attempted to understand you..."

I don't trust in the sweet silence
Snakes revealed their very virulence
Take me for sick
Save me from mine
It comes closer
My thorns entwine
In that mania it grows stronger
I am tired of self-test hunger
Take a spoon now
Just taste my spine
Crunch it slowly
Its taste to refine

Once I've been a happy clown
But my smile turned upside down
Just like one and two make three
I corrupted irony
I'm the one whose name I bear
Hang around and just don't care
Unsure how to live among
All these tender psycho-drones

How I long for ancient dawns
Crazy sessions at the bar
Self-destructing therapy
Intoxicated ecstasy
Progress filled the open space
Murphy's law in any case

How could I dare to leave the children?
Why could I never keep hold of your arms,
...of your dreams?
What wrong has happiness done to me, my friend?
None! (I never saw the lie)

Why the silence?

How could I dare to leave the children?
Why could I never keep hold of your arms,
...of your dreams?

I will never be the sort of a special friend
I could never let you go, not until the end
(how could I dare?)
Do my fingers jam around for a distant sun?
Will I ever be complete, leave the sick undone?

What wrong has happiness done to me, my friend?
None!
I will never be the sort of a special friend
I could never let you go, not until the end
Do my fingers jam around for a distant sun?
Will I ever be complete, leave the sick undone?

Who made the lion mild that day?
I lost it all along the way
Builded castles in the sky
Never saw the lie
First laughter, then again depressed
First being sure, then confused
Am I the snake slowly squeezing my own neck tighter?

Remember the promise you have made

How could I dare to leave the children?
Why could I never keep hold of your arms,
...of your dreams?

I will never be the sort of a special friend
I could never let you go, not until the end
(how could I dare?)
Do my fingers jam around for a distant sun?
Will I ever be complete, leave the sick undone?

My time is slipping away
Leaving the city behind
Take a close-up of comfort in evidence

Goodbye old friend, goodbye

I don't trust in the sweet silence
Snakes revealed their very virulence
Take me for sick
Save me from mine
It comes closer
My thorns entwine
