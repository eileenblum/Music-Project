Let the dice roll
A random aspect to receive

Leave the beaten track
Chaos as a constant

There's no valid system
But still one key you hide inside

A forty letters maxim
The artwork illustrates

How painters climbed the ladder to understand
Break this crust apart from the inside
For too long you've been controlled by dogmas
Hagridden by facts full of lies
A turning web of trivialities
Quit, scorn, burn, change this daily grind
Stereotype thorns in the flesh

But you don't mind...
Bugging vibes

Grating pipes
Condemn the veiled trash
And don't give a shit about its hype

...Sorry, "Maybes and Wannabes" ...you suck!!!

Faded flies in amber we are
The adornment of the unveiled

Madness grinding harmony

If you only tried to recover dreams you've tainted

Prophet-rhymes foresee
Make a plea

No sunset for the depraved...

Sink down in a hole
To see how little you've gained

And how vast the unattained
Time is shifting
Ripping at the base

What lingers fades out at last
And what leaves you cold is dead

May I never be dead again

Listen!
Don't believe that walls would never cede

In mind I shift them
Ninety degrees to create a paradoxum

Well, I mean...an open frame
Inflamed delirium

Somehow I know you'd feel the same

Whining doesn't help building bridges

Cross the borders of perception
Blow your golden cage

Turn the page
There's beauty in unexpected places

Leave the pile
Once in a while
You'll hear a voice

Bringing quitessence:
There is an inspiration that is so strong

I run, I run, I run
HUMAN WILL

Faded flies in amber we are
The adornment of the unveiled

Once again they smashed over miles
Too many hours cursed by chessmen

I won't any longer agree
Could there be anything left?

Smirking ones try to fake my tongue

But hey...
I don't think you'll keep me under control

Corrupt your hole

Tired friend, ...join the band

We won't pretend healing
Therefor mesmerize
