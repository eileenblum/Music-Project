And now I am free of you
lying in a flower bed, forlorn
the clashes are down
I come apart the seams

I've seen the wild horse running
while looking in your eyes
instead of bright crescendoes
the stalemate hangs us high

I stare into the mirror
staring at what looks like me
all signs point to be alone again
the forbidden fruit at his hands
a sudden waste
why?

I need time to count the things that went wrong
time on my own
made for idly caring days
I'll have the scars and you the memories
until I give vent to my anger

Jealousy...
the speculative nature of jealousy
silent fact of lust
a greed for the lost
or simply a sign of affection

One term will remain
the domino effect stays the same
my dreams are coming again
coming again
they're coming again

A lonesome pleasure kidding with melancholy
clinking glasses tell me I matter
abashing black and white
keep the nails out of mine
out of mine

These rainy days are yours to keep
I'll better fade away
I need to find some way out
someway to make me stay

I need time to count the things that went wrong
time on my own
made for idly caring days
I'll have the scars and you the memories
until I give vent to my anger

My fingers harvest the dark
a winding confession glides along my bones
you seemed to play by the rules
but somehow it turned out to be more difficult
don't take me for a freak
don't fool me any longer
take the memories with you
and enjoy them when you feel down

One term will remain
the domino effect stays the same
my dreams will revive
coming again
they're coming again
(Am I free? Am I free? Am I free?)

I need to be wanted
and want to be needed
alone I get out of hand

I'm tired of giving my love to you
tired of the stupid things I do
I'm tired of getting nothing in return
tired of being unable
to learn
