She's been quite happy in the sun
She would have liked to spend the whole day
Swimming in the palm lake of his hands

Tallest man
Now I need you in devotion
Carry me up to the world's
Highest mountains
From upon your shoulders I will rise

Not a day went by without her wish to fly

Winter fell upon her, overnight
She gave a promise to the living
Before her words broke slowly from her lips

Tallest man
Now I need your feet in motion
Carry me up to the world's highest mountains
From out of the ashes I will rise

She caught a snowflake on her tongue
And crossed the line

Spread out across the sky and open wide
She tried to escape with the sun
Even aware of a downfall her flight goes on

Her flight goes on
