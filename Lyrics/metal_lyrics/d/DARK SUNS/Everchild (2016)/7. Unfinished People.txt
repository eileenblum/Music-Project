Ramshackle house
Home of the longing
Ark for the brave
Isolated hideaway

Call out for love
Voice of the angry
Your burden engraved
Deep into the melody

Harlequin boy
Schoolyard pariah
Smells like routine
Sketches bled out of your pen

A sunbeam fell onto the laughing
Domesticating the wild
Drill me your love and teach me a lesson
Trapped in a box
The scared child

A sunbeam fell into the classroom
Broke off a biology mess
The dead birds flew out of the window
Brought back the songs of gladness

Run, forsaken child
Get out of what was shelter

And maybe we fall
In love with the days bygone
He made us more and more complete

I call him a friend
Since first we drank from his fountain rain
We drank when we were just young boys

A sunbeam fell into the church room
Verses on Palm Sunday read
And all the girls felt pretty unfinished
Crowned by the gold on their heads

A loud sound left holes in the dwelling
Knowing that you had enough
And I remained inflamed by a fire
A song that entertained us

Run, forsaken child
Get out of what was shelter

Run, your old guitar will always be in my hands
...
I cannot let you fall
You painted faces on our heads
You are the echo of my youth
