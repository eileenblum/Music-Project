I take a deep breath for one more flap
Put flight into my torn wings
That I may once more reach the sun
Catch fire
Burn up
Fall to pieces

As rain my traces vanish into the sea
Into uncertainty
Reborn on a cloud
Dissolved in water
Coloured by an unfulfilled dream

I've heard the stories of forgotten shores
I've heard the stories of a million
Will you tell me yours

Wherever you are
I will bleed for all we've shared

And even if it is too cold for a swim
And the siren calls of wrong way directions
I'll cross the ocean
Be aware by the strength
Of a young hearted

Wherever you are
I will bleed for all we've shared

A hundred years in silence I dwelt upon the isle

I will find you
