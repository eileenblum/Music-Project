There's a man with a tree - shaped shadow
Painting by the sea
From his eyes
My own face looks back at me
As a child

See his branches draw a skyline
Like human hands
His arms outstretched
Lay open his ornaments
Wait for the morning rain

See his branches draw a skyline
Like human hands
See the colours of his lifetime
Around him blend
This is the morning rain

Red balloon
I am falling out
From the corner of his eye
Guide my mind
Slow me enough that I can land safely

See his branches draw a skyline
Like human hands
His arms outstretched
Uncover his open chest
Here in the morning rain

See his branches know
That he loves her
Now as when a boy
On a canvas never ending
They draw him joy
Here in the morning rain

Maybe drinking is not the only cure
To find some rest
The music praise
To flower and then collapse
Here in the morning rain

He's been dragging on
To find peace among those metropolised
When the night turns into day
Renew my friend
Bliss is the morning rain

I am not to know how much a heart can take
Not to prove that you won't fake heart ache
I am but to maybe let the fallen find forgiveness
I need you to glorify
That there's a loophole in our dreams at night
For you and me
By the sea
When all our wounds bleed on
In pure silence

I am not to know of what befell my mind
Not to know a better place than this
Bliss it is to know my daughter to arrive
I woke up to find my body
Sleeping in the arms of familiar embrace
Here I belong
Place a kiss
Raise a smile
A slightest touch
To cause a chain reaction

Come on, little giant
Let's break the silence
Come on, little giant
Pillow fight
