We talk in codes
Since caught in a trap
Will they now force on us their plan
I see no other way but to congregate
Will they now force on us their plan

They tie the knots to hang us from the trees
Lay tarot cards with tainted hands
Don't try to figure out of what nature we are
Will they now carry out their plan

We should endeavor to escape
Hide or run away
Tonight I'll make it up to you
Brave enough to bite the hand that feeds

I will untie you from the trees
Better come with me
The flood has taken shape without a warning
How little do they know
How less what we may be
Escape now

I alone brought evidence
That could explain how peaceful we really are
And always have been

I let them see how we should have lived
How we should have lived

We should endeavour to escape
Hide or run away
Tonight I'll make it up to you
Brave enough to bite the hand that feeds

There is a place beyond their reach
An ark for those in need
Of many different origins
Born out of the nothing but the wish to love

You ride a wave against the wrong
Knowing we are strong
We finally mutated into angels
Tried to break the flood down into tears
And found fear
