This is what we are
Dreamers in a car
Hanging out on the hill
Waiting to fulfill

Ready to leave tonight
Before the rain falls down
What could have made you so late

It's gonna be alright
We're gonna paint the town red
What could have made you so late

We break out
Suddenly there's no fake in my smile
We'll break off
Running free

Damn the way
They have control over you
Over all your life
I know where the jasmine grows
We lie in wait

You were always dressed with real fleur
But all that you need
Hides in the belly of the whale
What could have made you so late

We left signs along the road of modern decay
Stopped the rain from falling
We know you're gonna find us

We break out
Hopefully there's no fake in your smile
We'll break off running free

Damn the way
They have control over you
Over all your life
I know where the jasmine grows
Now they got us on the run
You are on the run
Come up now
Push the spiders downhill
