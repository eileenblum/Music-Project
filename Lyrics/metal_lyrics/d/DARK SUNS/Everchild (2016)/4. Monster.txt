You planted my mind with a lie
Dry my eyes
Before we're gonna try to sleep

Could you leave the door halfway open
Mummy, let your broken heart go
Leave the staircase lighting on
To not fear the gloominess in my room

I fade into an image of my mind
An unfamiliar garden
Overgrown by the voices
Of your game, just the same
I've done my little bedtime prayer
Hoping that your thoughts are on me
Let me think that we are not alone
May the angel at hand
That we've made out of clay
Let all the black winged,
Illusive creatures and monsters
Be anywhere far away from home

Claw marks underneath my bed
Don't you see
Paralysed
I know it is in silence waiting
Don't you see

As long as we hide under blankets
It can't make us out in the dark
So I do not move
I'm wide awake
Daddy fights the monster
Walking up and down the hall
Calling my name
The monster, it is more than just a fable
Told to frighten us
