Time runs like a river
We're folding paper boats
Run run ever
Swim against the flow

Just let us go where the river is made to arise from
Where soft green grass spread like a carpet to my feet
I would not have been left upset
Spent to much time trying to find ambivalence

May we have burnt brightly enough
To maybe turn into a child

Waiting to become
While all around the coming grows
People run in circles
Like heaven's planetary eyes

Just look around
I remember the scent of magnolias
The fountain water that we drank in infancy
Every burden falls from mine eyes
Out of my mind
Sliding into oblivion

May we have burnt brightly enough
To turn into a child again

Waiting to become
While all around the coming grows
People run in circles
Like heaven's planetary eyes

Waiting for the sun
To break out from between the clouds
I know that we've been here
And maybe even many times
