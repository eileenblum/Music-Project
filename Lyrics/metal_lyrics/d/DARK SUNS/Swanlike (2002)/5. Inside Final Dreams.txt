Do not stand at my grave and weep
I am not there, I do not sleep
I am a thousand winds that blow
I am the diamond glints on snow
I am the sunlight an ripened grain
I am the gentle autumn rain
I am the soft stars that shine at night
Do not stand at my grave and cry
I am not there
I did not die

When I the song of life have sung
My soul's relesaed, its flight begun
Do not stand with grief-bowed head
My soul's just free, I am not dead!
I'll wait beyond the silent wall
With the hordes who've gone before
I cannot heed your pleading call
My soul's been freed forever more
I've found a place of peace and quiet
And boundless beauty rare
The day's not broken by the night
There's naught of trouble anywhere
Rejoice, ye earth-bound one, with gathering
My soul is free inside my dreams

I will come down at night
To these resounding beaches
And the long gentle wind of the sea
Here for a single hour in the wide starlight
I shall be happy for the dead are free

And after many a summer dies the swan
