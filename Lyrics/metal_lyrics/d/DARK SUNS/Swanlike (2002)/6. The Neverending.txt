The woods decay and fall
The vapours weep their burdon to the ground
Man comes and tills the fields and lies beneath
And after many a summer dies the swan

When the days of all golden dreams had perished
Even despair was powerless to destroy
Then did I learn how existence could be cherished
And fed without the aid of joy

Then did I check the tears of useless passion
Weaned my young soul from yearning after yours
Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten
Down to that tomb already more than mine

My dreams
My life
Away
Now I'm here
The abyss near
Neverending

And even yet I dare not let it languish
Dare not indulge in memory's repturous pain
Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish
How could I seek the empty world again?

Fall asleep and die in harmony
Under the bright shadow of Dark Suns tragedy...
