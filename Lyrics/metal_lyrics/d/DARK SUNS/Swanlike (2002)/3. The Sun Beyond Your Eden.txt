I hold my breath for a moment
A soft breeze passes me by hiding this place
In the palm of bloody hands
Emotions playing through the rain

When is the new beginning
The pale-faced picture in the mirror of tears
Has been waiting for so long
-torn-

In my beginning is my end
Life that in me has never rest
In my beginning is my end
All beautiful moments pushed away

No coward soul is mine
No trembler in the worlds storm-troubled sphere
Dreams in light, faith shines equal
Arming me from fear

We shall have no time for dances

There is not room for death
Nor atom theat his might couldrender void
We are here
What we art may never be destroyed

For sunlight in your Eden

Emotions and man were gone
And suns and universes ceased to be
I was left alone
Every existence would exist in me

The sound of belched words lost in the wind
A few embraces dying
The sound of whispered thoughts lost in the wind
A few commandments lying
