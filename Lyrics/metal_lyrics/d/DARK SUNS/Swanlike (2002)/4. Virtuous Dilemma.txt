My youth was filled with forlorn dreams
Brothers from the same ground like me died soon
But I awoke from this virtuous dilemma
And in that moment I knew

No more pain inside my mind
When it all falls apart
No more death beyond my name
Loose a grip of all control

In life I saw the Black at all
Bleeding with the sunlight never again
We wouldn't touch
Your breath running dead and cold
Survive the sound
So better you know

No more pain inside my mind
When it all falls apart
No more death beyond my name
Loose a grip of all control
