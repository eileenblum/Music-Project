(it is not my memories which haunt me
It is not what I have written down
It is what I have forgotten, what I must forget,
What I must go on forgetting all my life)

There is eternity this night, an endless light
Signs from above reminding me of home and love
I hide my face amid a crowd of velvet stars
See great rings all around my head
I'm looking back
Created to pretend we never die

I feel like one coming out of an upper room
To fret no more and walk abroad so confirmed

There's time in hours, in days and years
Driven by the spheres
The child, the place, their warm embrace
What abiding space?
Created to pretend we never die

I feel like one coming out of an upper room
To fret no more and walk abroad so confirmed
The houses shine in silence
And the child in me steps in so deep
In this unshaded place
A soul on its lonely path
