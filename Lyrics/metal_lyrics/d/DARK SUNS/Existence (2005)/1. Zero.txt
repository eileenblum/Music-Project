All appeared new, and strange at the first;
Inexpressibly rare, delightful and beautiful.
I felt like one coming out of an upper room
To fret no more and walk abroad confirmed.
The houses shone in silence and the child in me
Stepped in so deep in this unshaded place;
A fine kingdom that meant to be home.
All things were spotless, pure and alive,
Free and immortal,
So I didn't want to know
What I was going to be.

All time was eternity.
