...her voice...
But it was more than that
Theatrical distances
Bronze shadows heaped on high horizons
Velvet atmospheres

Shine - ardent beauty
Your drowned face
Always staring
Towards the sun
Flush - arcane fire
In her mind
A desire
For kindness

So it is me who walks with you
In the maze of enclasping flow
Heat and sound
Your life is spiraling down
Showing me the mirrors of your own
You're the one...
I'm blinded by the light
...harking at the clament dirge of winds
And the waves have now a redder tone
I loose myself
And converge
Her and the element

Words so untainted
Your mellow voice
Sending me into raptures
Drown - once again
Take my hand
Leave nothing
Undone

So it is me who walks with you
In the maze of enclasping flow
Heat and sound
Your life is spiraling down
Showing me the mirrors of your own
You're the one...
I'm blinded by the light
...harking at the clament dirge of winds
And the waves clash into cliffs
Now forming sculptures of
Decay

It's her and me in the element
It's me and her in the element

...her voice...
But it was more than that
Theatrical distances
Bronze shadows heaped on high horizons
Velvet atmospheres

They come
The early morning hours
Lay down with me and let it end
