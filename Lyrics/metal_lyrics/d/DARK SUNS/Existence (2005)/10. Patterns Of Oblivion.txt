Take me down to nowhere
How long did I crawl?
Daydreams fade away now
Patterns of my fall
Let me understand it
Oblivion was my state
Dumb from human blindness
Did I seal your fate?

There is someone waiting for you

My ancient pulse of talents
Has shrunken hard and dry
And every spirit upon earth
Seems fervourless as I
So far from all the living
But finally not alone
Voices from the outside
Pray for coming home

There is someone waiting for you

I'm not alone
But they don't know that

These bloody days broke my heart, my loving,
My youth, my hope... all departed from life
Now I must disguise my face with a mask
Of pure seclusion
Feel me, I'm old now
Still searching for answers
Hoping that you know
My eyes behind this mask
A child goes along with me until the end
I'm longing for the past

...
A new dimension?

These bloody days
Searching for answers
Feel me, I'm old now, feel me

There is someone waiting for you

(peering out of my deadlight
I'm looking for another
Wandering voiceless among the voices
That throng my hiddenness
At all the tragic scene they stare
And have to turn away sometimes)
