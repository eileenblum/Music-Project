(the estate of innocence)

A world neverending
Renounce of time at all
See children tumbling in the rain
Green fabulous minds
Dancing within their young lifes' walls

Look into these eyes and see
The balance of a child
Dreams keep on falling and I know
There's no cause for concern
But a fathomless world outside

All time was eternity
What sacred instinct did inspire
My soul in childhood with a hope so strong?
What secret force moved my desire
To expect my joys beyond the seas so young?
(in my beginning is my end)
