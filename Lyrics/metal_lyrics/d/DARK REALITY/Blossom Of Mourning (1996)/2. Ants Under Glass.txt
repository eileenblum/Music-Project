The flower spreads, and wisdom staggers clue disperses
moreover sense has melt away unintentious, but with great effect
"Motionless attitude, never selfmade attitude fearful,
common laziness, fearfully conscientious never ever consciousness,
consciousness is fear frostbitten sight, obstructive spite: be eternally received..."
These thoughts, they cross the crumbling sky,
the nearing end is their impulse fulmination fills the air,
a flower of sound takes over
"Ants inside the head paralyze the head
close up and pass by, eternal will:
to deny under glass, to be and stay..."
