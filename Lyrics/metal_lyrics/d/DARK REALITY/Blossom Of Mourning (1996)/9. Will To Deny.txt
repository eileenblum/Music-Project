This is no god, this is but me a shivering spine with eyes that see
behind that faces souls whose dimensions
controlled by fear, and no comprehension
Educated eagerness, erase from consciousness
I am no god, I am but me a shivering spine with eyes that see
Darkness is falling... still don't comprehend
yesterdays calling the future to bend
thoughts are deralied, thoughts are deflied,
thoughts are deflowered and denied thoughts are abused,
to be abjured we are but tools, we are but food
Grey are the clouds, low is the sky hoping this clouds
may feed my disguise hiding the sun, thickering the air
if justice is done, there's no need to care... No way to care
But foaming outside, mankind and its depths
them to abide? Their emptiness to forget?
Now look at these skies, they're crumbling, at least
they will to deny, within me a beast? All together, get estranged!
Look around, taste the air, freedom joy, no despair
nothing is what it seems close this eye, live this dream
educated eagerness, enthralled by emptiness
