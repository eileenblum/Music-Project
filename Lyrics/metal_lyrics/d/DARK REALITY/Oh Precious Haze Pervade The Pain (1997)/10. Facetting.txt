Surrounded by colours
Of shimmering light
A display of splendour,
continual shine

Delicious flower - iridescent dye
A turmoil of flowers - miraculous lie

Refracted illusions,
Hidden behind a facetted partition,
transfigure the scene

Delicious flower - iridescent dye
A turmoil of flowers - miraculous lie

Tinted the air by millions pf sparkles
That tickle and shiver and flourish and swirl

With joy on the face
A hand reaches out and grips disappointment,
The smile fades away
Like the million of sparkles
That tickled and shivererd
And flourished and swirled
Long ago
