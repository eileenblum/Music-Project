You call me conspirator, you treacherous spineless serpent? Now throw off your mask and take a dip in the lake of honesty, where meek dogs turn to rabid and tame sheep become wolves, it washes down the blindfold that covers your weak eyes. You're the blameless king of lies who enthroned his fucking self, the guillotine thirsts for your crown on your severed head. The crown is made of vipers by the hands of jealousy, but wear it proudly amongst your servants in the kingdom of putrid rats. I should have seen the coward buried beneath your skin, but my eyes were fucking covered with the trust I put in you. The same mistakes are made, friends became enemies I paid the price for my blindness and naivety. You ignited the bridge I just let it burn, the veil of confidence is drenched in doubt. You call me conspirator, you treacherous spineless serpent? Now throw off your mask and take a dip in the lake of honesty, where meek dogs turn to rabid and tame sheep become wolves, it washes down the blindfold that covers your weak eyes. You're the blameless king of lies who enthroned his fucking self, the guillotine thirsts for your crown on your severed head. Fuck yourself! You're the boy who screamed wolf, just a liar nothing more.
