This is a new beginning without you I'm everything that I wanted to be. You're always here for me except when I really need you, oh God I want to forget you! You can't turn the wind with your hands. I gave you everything but it was never enough. Be straight and tell me what you want my mind is not your playground. You are the past, you are the present and the fucking future united in a person. Stand up for yourself and choose right now to turn left or right, you're ready to fly or fall from the skies and break your legs and arms. You sink into the filth that you created, now your ripped heart beats on the floor. I gave you everything but it was never enough. You cut the line that braces us, now it's the time for penitence. Be straight and tell me what you want my mind is not your playground. You are the past, you are the present and the fucking future united in a person. Your time is up now, our history ends now. Your time is up now, our history ends right now.
