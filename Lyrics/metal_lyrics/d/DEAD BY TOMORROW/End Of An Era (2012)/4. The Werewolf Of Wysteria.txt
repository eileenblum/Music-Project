A cutting wind blows out the candles the moon's reflecting from the knife, tonight the evil Gray Man will send another soul to the afterlife. Grace Budd lies before him tied, tortured, naked and raped. Blinded by murderous fictions to taste the virgin. âJust weep you little siren" - he whispered the lullaby then slit her throat, and covered her little neck with a crimson scarf. A gushing blood reddens the Gray Man the torment's coming to an end, when the imploring eyes become glazed he has a violent climax. He grasps the dying bosoms to duplicate the pleasure, this mutilated little angel his cold and blue treasure. His cold and blue treasure. Stabs her in the chest without a shred of grace, cut the flesh to the bone with blood soaked face. The Werewolf lost his sanity and craves for virgin blood. As cutting her up into pieces he becomes erect, slits her mouth from ear to ear and fills with caraway. The skillet will be her casket and the oven is her grave. Jaws bite into the roasted tender virgin fucking flesh. Kidneys, liver, nose and ears with salt, pepper and celery, the royal feast is served up for the self-possessed child-murderer.
