The rising waves are striking the dark, abandoned seashore, the storm is coming I can smell the rain. We're standing on a sinking ship our lungs are filled with salty water. Can we survive this together hand in hand? The sharks are circling beneath our feet, I can't wake up, because it's not a dream. The wind is blowing harder, the waves are getting larger we can't help it just going with the tide. If we reach the bottom we will lose each other in the deep. I try so hard to follow you in the dark, but the raging ocean works against us I can't hold your hand anymore, the raging ocean separates us I can't hold your hand anymore. I can't take a breath I'm drowning, I'm drowning inside. I try so hard to follow you in the dark. Cut your anchors and let you sail away.
