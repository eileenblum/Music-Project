I hear the sounds of past slowly fading away, my eyes are searching for a brand new way. Can we turn back time and change the here and now? The future has no ears it will never stop for your request, the choice is yours our fate is not carved in stone. But the stone is in our hands so grab a fucking pencil, grab a goddamn pencil and write it down! Grab a goddamn pencil and write it down! But it's so hard to write with broken hand my volition will be the medicine. Let's open your ears now and listen, your heart and your mind are not the same. Now I'm looking in the mirror and trying to stop the claws of change but who can turn the desert, the desert into ocean? And who can guarantee that I will not drown in the sea of a hopeless future?
