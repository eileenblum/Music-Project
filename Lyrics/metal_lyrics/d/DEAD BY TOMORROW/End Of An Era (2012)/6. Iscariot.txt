I followed your destiny until now but it's over. Now our fellowship is just a shadow locked deep in your room. I see the pictures on your wall, those remind me of everything what you've stolen from me, I'm blinded by the smoke of your burned principles. I followed your destiny but now it's over. You are the burden on my shoulders I give you the necklace of the traitors. âWe will be friends forever" - it's just a slip of a liar's tongue, friends will be enemies and enemies stay the same. I'm walking with your knife in my back and searching for your lost respect, so much treachery has come but I won't give up. âWe will be friends forever" â just a slip of a liar's tongue, so much treachery has come but I, I won't give up. You are the burden on my shoulders I give you the necklace of the traitors. You've always wanted more and more but your actions betrayed your words. I believed in you but now I've got nothing to lose 'cause you take away everything and the fate has always tempted. I know I can't hang you twice but this is a chance to try. I hold a mirror before you but you're so fucking blind so I dig the grave for your honesty. At least now I know who you really are just a foe not a friend anymore. I gave you all my faith and trust but your lies made a wall between us.
