Goddamned deceptive words like venom flowing through my fucking fragile veins. It slowly makes me suffer to give my fainted body to eternity. You put me in a cauldron boiled me with the human scheme, sentences are like acidic cancer corroded my wretched soul. You've forsaken me in trouble but my faith was unbreakable, by now it's just a broken glass you forfeited your last chance. Maybe I die alone but I won't drown in a fucking swamp of deception, a loathing for you makes me stronger âcause you stabbed me in my back. I won't fight for you anymore. Deceptive words as creeping insects in a weak sacrifice, squirming among the entrails and tear the nerves apart. I despise you, scorn you, hate you! I despise you, scorn you, fucking hate you! Your empty words have flooded my mind but a sudden grip has changed my sight. My point of view has turned, our common past is burnt. Another friendship is terminated and the wounds entirely healed. Now you're just a shade to me. I slake my thirst by revenge.
