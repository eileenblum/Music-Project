So many friends we left behind, some of them are dead and gone. So many faces are fading away, we have each other to ease the pain, 'cause life is waiting with open arms, we let the past be the past. And we will grow old together, remember the times when we were young, we know yesterday never lies. We will remain the kids we used to be. One soul, one destination and countless days we've spent together, with our instruments and some bottle of wine, these good memories will forever be with us. So many friends we left behind, some of them are dead and gone. So many faces are fading away, we have each other to ease the pain, 'cause life is waiting with open arms, we let the past be the past.
