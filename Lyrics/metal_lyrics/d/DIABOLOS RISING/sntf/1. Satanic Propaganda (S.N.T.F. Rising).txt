Your God is dead
You were never saved
Just cleverly trapped
Your God is dead
There's no heaven and Hell
Your priests are deceiving you
Your God is dead
Your divine holy bible is a book filled with lies
Your God is dead
Your World is an illusion
Your church fornicates you
Your God is dead
The only use of your cross is when it's nailed on your coffins
Your God is dead
He died the day the holy ghost raped your virgin
Your God is dead
You are drawn in misery and you damn love it
Your God is dead
WE KILLED HIM!
Your God is dead and Satan feasts upon his corpse
