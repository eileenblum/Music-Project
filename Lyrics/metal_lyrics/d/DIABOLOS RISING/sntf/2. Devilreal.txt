Revelations come riding fast
Sweeping the Earth from pole to pole
An age of pain and rebirth
The rise of Lucifer's bright star

The swords shall taste flesh again
And waters will be turned to blood
Diseased black angels (will) spit their seed
Into the wombs of mankind

DEVILREAL
Satanic reality
DEVILREAL
The Dragon's Triumph

The weakest parts will fall apart
Scattered by the infernal winds
Fiery revenge with no remorse
To the witch-hunters of the past

Wisdom will tear the veils of lies
The false Empires will collapse
And in the Dawn that few will face
Right will be served by fang and claw.
