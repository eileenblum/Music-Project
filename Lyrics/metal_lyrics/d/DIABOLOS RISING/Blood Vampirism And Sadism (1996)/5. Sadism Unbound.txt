Hear my poisoned laughter
As the thorny whip tearing the flesh
Leaving the naked bone to kiss the air
A burnt offering to the venus of violence
The most pure unbound form of sadism
Is purification of the beast-soul
As beautiful as a tempest of angels
Seductive power of erotic fascism
My sunless catacombs resonant
With the etherial distorted screams
Of mutilated nuns in ecstasy
As sharpened hooks slowly enter their wombs
Pledge obedience to your new master
Conjouring forth the pain of your lord
A perfect murder in your splitform
By the leader fangs of misanthropy
All paths lead to hell
In torment's depth I'll let thee glimpse
All paths stream from hell
