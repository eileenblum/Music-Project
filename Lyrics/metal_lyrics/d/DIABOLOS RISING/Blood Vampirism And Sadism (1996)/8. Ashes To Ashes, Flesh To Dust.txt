Shifting black turmoils of ghosts
Lost in the maze of an afterlife
As ultraviolet undead forms
Rise from the kingdom of mud
Gothic remains of necrolatry
Hanging from the lips of charon
And frozen moonfog of thanotos
Whispers wonders in my ears
Like an astral tale of a psychonaut
A harvester of souls on halloween
Are the comforts of the silken touch
In a black mirrored living coffin
Eternal beginning of a dreadful end
Lies in the orchid covered tombs
Pale beauty of necranthemon
Drowned in aura of lethal vanity
