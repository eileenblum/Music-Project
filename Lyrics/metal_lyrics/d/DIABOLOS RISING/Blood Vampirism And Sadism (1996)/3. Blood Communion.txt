Suddenly from her scarlet mouth
Like serpents dancing on hot soil
Words of bewitchment start to crawl
"I keep, the antique demon of
Remorse at bay
All sorrows die upon ma breast
Old become young into my arms
As I suck nectar from their veins
Just for a drop of moonburnt lust
They give the blood I love so much"
And from the night she kissed my soul
Wolverine visions ride my dreams
Killing my mortal human side
In a greedy orgy of blood
I will soon turn my back on death
I will deny it's cold embrace
Just like the phoenix rises from flames
I'll be reborn in vampire's grace
