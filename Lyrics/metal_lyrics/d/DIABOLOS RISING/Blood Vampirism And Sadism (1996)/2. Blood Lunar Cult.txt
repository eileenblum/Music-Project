White throats filled with burning fluid
Blood-red angry rivers of life
Boiled in the odors of sin
Flowin with a mesmeric sound
Like offsprings of primordial chants
Blind by the uncoloured light
Raging children drink each other
In the red lakes of ever life
Where rebel priests sink their fangs
With a twisted demonolatry
Into the breasts of devil-whores
Lies the fortress of life force
In the shrine of blood
I let myself to crawl in
A sadomasochistic trance
Of a bizarre vampirism
