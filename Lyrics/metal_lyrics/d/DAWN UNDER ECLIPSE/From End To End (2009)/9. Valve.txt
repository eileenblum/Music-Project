I wish to know how fast grows the fear inside us
And let it go, expanding ache my mind will break
Refuse to know that deep inside you grows a monster
Denying your name trying to escape from what you need
Feed my soul with the fire remove this fragments from my past
Evacuate my mind because itâs starting to collapse
Penetrate with violence the poetry of your dreams
With a stolen word came from the nightmare of your sins
I will try to remove all the ghosts carved inside your thoughts
I will close all the wounds of my new life
I was crawling praying, searching for the light
I was crawling
Through the night of my mind I will find a light
If I am able to get outside I will survive
