I canât recognize the dusk from the dawn
My eyes are still opened but I canât see no more
Iâm trying to touch the shape of my soul
Crossing the distance between me and you
My home is deserted my name is erased
My brain is damaged âcause I didnât feel pain
Try to wake me up just try to complain
One word at last before we all fade away
Just breathe in collapse your light into my darkness and loose yourself
Redispose your frame analize your shame
Recognize that your mind is delayed
Just bring me your heart and switch off your brain
Open your ears and receive our pain
Your ethic has nailed you, your instinct has failed
Iâm ruining the fortress you built with your shame
Try to wake me just try to complain
One word at last after nothing remains
Just breathe in collapse your light into my darkness and loose yourself
Release me, spit all your pity into my sadness and go away
