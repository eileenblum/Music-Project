Raise
This cold prison that withholds my thoughts
Never has been so dark
Still gives me a moment to look
To the light that shakes on the walls
Give me another moment before the storm
Raise me before the storm when clouds collide
Remind me that Iâm alive
Prepare me before the hailstorm
Before to go, give me back just what is mine
Give me another fragment to devour
Give my another speck for my sand glass
This cage built around us
This frame of love and death
Give me another moment before the storm
Raise me before the storm when clouds collide
Remind me that Iâm alive
Prepare me before the hailstorm
Before to go, give me back just what is mine
