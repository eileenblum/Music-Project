Erase a lifetime with a breath
Take this song right to the end
Choose the color you want to dress
And then put this knife right to your chest
I need to feel alive at the end we will meet again
I donât need a cure I just wanted to be alone
Give me back my words theyâre all painted with blood
Delete my mind and clean up my soul
Take this song and build up your words
Choose the name for the new born
And then run away before it comes
I donât need a cure I just wanted to be alone
Give me back my words theyâre all painted with blood
