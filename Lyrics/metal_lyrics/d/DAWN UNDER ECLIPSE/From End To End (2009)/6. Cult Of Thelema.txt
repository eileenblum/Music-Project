When the night kills the light I canât try to sleep
Through the void of my mind I canât find relief
The walls of my thoughts are all painted with blood
Feed me with fuel âcause Iâm losing control
You cannot extinguish the fire that burns in my veins
You cannot stop the time that slides under my wheels
Feed me with death âcause Iâm losing control
I need your feelings and a fragment of your souls
Feed me (let me) get my time back I want what is mine
Voices that come from the void in my pit
Evoking the frightening shadows carved in my dreams
Ghosts came from the past crawl on the walls
Eradicate your conscience and burn it with your soul
Iâm running wild through the woods of my instinct
I sense the presence of my good old fiend
Hunting my ghosts through the shapes of these threes
I feel the rain that is washing my skin
Feed me (let me) get my time back I want what is mine
I want to impress the tissues of your emotionality
I just tried to press my voice through your ears into my mind
I like me to express that your mediocrity disgust me
But I spat out my impressions for the pleasure of my thoughts
