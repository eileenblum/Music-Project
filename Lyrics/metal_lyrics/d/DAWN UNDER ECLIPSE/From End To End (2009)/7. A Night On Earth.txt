Am I supposed to let you go
Am I going away
Am I suppose to ignore my will
And let it fade away
Am I supposed to erase your smile
Am I wasting my time
Am I supposed to blur away
Like a vanishing light in the rain
I burst my soul in the darkness to bring the light
I watched the eyes of our frailty drive us down
Am I supposed to let you go
Am I losing my faith
Am I supposed to be alone
And feel myself with my loneliness
I donât need to forgive I donât need to clear out your name
âCause time is ascending and Iâm going down again
I burst my soul in the darkness to bring the light
I watched the eyes of our frailty drive us down
