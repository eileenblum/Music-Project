The river brought a secret
It belongs to me
Told me that obscure dreams
will fall on me
Dance to this discordant system
Move your eyes and
Try to disconnect your wire
Try to escape from
This caleidoscopic rhythm
Try to escape from
Take me through a new road
And my mind discover new forms to express
I will look the grind of your mind
Trying to confront yours with mine
I canât to change my name
I can only raise raise my death
My own prison is now closed
I can only try to fold
Why canât you see that Iâm afraid
And you are gone and Iâm alone
All the time we used to spend alone
Is drifting through our shadows
All this time we waited to hold on
Every moment we shared through our words
Belongs to my past life
All this time we waited to hold on
The river brought a secret
It belongs to me
Told me that obscure dreams
will fall on me
Itâs time to run away
Itâs time for my decay
Through the night of mind I will find a light
I will lead the way deep inside the cave of our lives
If I am able to get outside the labyrinth
I will try to kill you to survive
Eradicate your thoughts from your brain
Be sure to forgive all that you learned
Voices that comes from the void in my mind
Ghosts from a past of a life thatâs not mine
Wrapped around the wires of my life
Try to convince me to give up this fight
Voices that comes from the void in my eyes
Shadows that crawl on the walls of my mind
The wires of my dreams are still wrapped to my life
While Iâm running wild through the wood of my pride
