I watched all the deep caves in my thoughts
Searching something I have lost
Try to figure out my illusions
Try to feed my roots
Our past rolling down my knees
Day by day I change my creed
I'm trying to heal my coscience using my deasease

Some days I think faster
Some days my time collapses

Soul breakes I'm coming faster you can define my
Soul waits my thoughts are restless my mind is shapeless

Try to feed your nightmares with my pain
Try to heal them with your brain
Try to figure out my thoughts and let them fall like rain
Steps that take us close to the end
Carve the surface of our land
Man will self distruct and push the limit to the edge

Some days I think faster
Some days my time collapses

Soul breakes I'm coming faster you can define my
Soul waits my thoughts are restless my mind is shapeless

Trying to feed your nightmares with pain
Trying to feed my brain

I watched all the deep caves in my thoughts
Searching something I have lost
Try to figure out my illusions
Try to feed my roots
