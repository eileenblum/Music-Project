Walked through the desert of life
I traveled for miles into my mind
Deep in the caves of my eyes
I found a light that burns through this night
I have seen the night fade out
When the sky pulled me down
I believed in your soul
Trust me now
I want to see it in your eyes to compose
I've got to see it going down
I want to feel it in your mind
To come over
I've got to see it going down
Lost in the sound of our cries
We give up the search for our lives
Circling around our time
We found a light that burns our eyes
Tear away my world from 
This abstraction of life
Meaningless emotions
Starving maggots move on
Believe me
Your name is painted in red upon my walls
A new born takes a breath
Grab your name you are my promise
For a new day
I want to see it in your eyes to compose
I've got to see it going down
I want to feel it in your mind
To come over
I've got to see it going down
