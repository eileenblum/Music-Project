I face my mirror every day
When I'm awake
I wash my eyes
And brush away the pain
Tear away my world
Blinded eyes will see
The lights that change my form
Shadows blurring
Tear away my soul
Blinded eyes will see
Those lights that slowly grows
Shadows burning
I try to focus every day
But I can't find
A sphere to hold my mind
Tear away my world
Blinded eyes will see
The lights that change my form
Shadows blurring
Tear away my soul
Blinded eyes will see
Those lights that slowly grows
Shadows burning
