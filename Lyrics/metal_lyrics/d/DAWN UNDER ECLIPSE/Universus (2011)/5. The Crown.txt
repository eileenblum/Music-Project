There is a crow that stares at my back
When I'm around the sky becomes black
I sense a primitive need of possession
Obscure words are my obsession
I wear a crown that i made with my tears
On a throne that I carved with my fears
I believe in darkness and torture
What I need is what i don't need
Inside I hidden all my love
I fear the mocks and the jokes
No I'm not a loser
Please please look at me
Frightened from my own shadow
Pretend that I'm a king
I need to escape from this tunnel
Deep through the void I'm falling
I must hide before the sunrise
i need to feed on your despise
Let me be free
The violence I ate to pervert me
Now is taking control over me
Inside I hidden all my love
I fear the mocks and the jokes
These spirals flow away
From my tongue nailed on this cross
Burning my time here is going to end
Awake
