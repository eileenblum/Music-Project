I cannot pray with my mind
Fulfilled with death
Grabbing his memories to hold fast
I need a place for my ceremony
Look at me I'm just a prism
Who decompose the lights from the stars
Trying to reach the sky
And now you're feeling for the last time
The words I break
And now just take me for the last ride
'Cause I'm insane
Music is falling from the sky
I lick the sound that I needed
This electricity that I am dreaming of
Is falling inside my dreams
is falling inside of me
The serendipity circling around
My name is slowly taking me
To my ceremony
I'm running free because in my heart
All i can see it is my agony
Nailed upon my creeds
I'm running free in my heart
All I can see it is my agony
That I hide nailed upon my creeds
I cannot pray with my mind
Fulfilled with death
Grabbing his memories to hold fast
I need a place for my ceremony
Deep into the light
There is a crawling life
That's keeping me alive
The source of our pride
The spiral fade through this maze
Now I can recall my name
