Deep blue melt with my eyes
I'm dancing and crying
To release this grudge
From my veins
The discomfort that we felt
Took our lives through
Sounds of our lost desire
There's a home for our homicide
There's a home for our lies
There's a place for our mind
Where to cry
Clouds move into the sky
My perception of time
Lose the rhythm
Of my own heartbeat
Deaf words into my mouth
I found out a lost room
Hidden inside my conscience
Will you come for purity
Or the visions I hide
Will you come for healing me
Or watching me die
Waves behold the old sailor tonight
Waves are ways in this night
Crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl, crawl
There's a home for our homicide
There's a home for our lies
There's a place for our mind
Where to cry
Will you come for purity
Or the visions I hide
Will you come for healing me
Or watching me die
Will you come for purity
Or the visions that I hide
Will you come for healing me
Or watching me die
Deep in the cave of our lives
We'll find a path to go outside
All the emotions we fed realize
Your desire when you're old
Away, escape from the fears
That behold your nightmare
Hide the sun that
Rose on my mountains
Feed the beast that
Lays on these fields
Pray my demons to leave
Boy, you've something to die for
Your eyes show me that I am right
Deep blue melt with my eyes
I'm dancing and crying
To release this grudge
From my veins
The discomfort that we felt
Took our lives through
Sounds of our lost desire
