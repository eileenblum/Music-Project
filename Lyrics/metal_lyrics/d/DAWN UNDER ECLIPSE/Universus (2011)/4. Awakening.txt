Touch me when I'm awake
Until the end of the day
I will be safe
Far from my eyes
You shown me that I forgot
To read a letter I wrote
With words of blood
Within my lies
My thoughts are my prison
My life steal my reason
Set me free
Recalling your life
I call for absolution
Sank in my dreams
Down from your feet
I'm diving
Into my dreams
Deeper than I can see
I don't need
Sank in my dreams
Down from your feet
I'm diving
Into my dreams
Deeper than I can see
I can't see
Set me free
Recalling your life
I call for absolution
Awake show me the time
That I was dreaming of
Awake show me a sign
For my redemption
I can't stay
I've finished my time and I must go away
Escape from the sorrow that I made
Leaving from the words that I cannot explain
And I'm losing my name
