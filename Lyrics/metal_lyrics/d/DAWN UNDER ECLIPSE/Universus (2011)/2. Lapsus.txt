Flashes of hate burn my irises when I'm afraid
I cannot keep working on strategies to run away
Burn my irises
Burn my hypothesis
this desert beholds me, controls me
My hypothesis is burning
I'm blurring
And morphing
From stone to sand
I'm still here observing
A building
That is growing moldy
And burning
Collapsing in front of me
Tonight I see that the black house is burning
I feel that all my ghosts are moving
And I would, I would
Run away from darkness is dancing around me
The sand in my eyes (it) is hurting
And making me bleed
I'm still here observing
A building
That is growing moldy
And burning
Collapsing in front of me
Tonight I see that the black house is burning
I feel that all my ghosts are moving
And I would, I would
Run away from
This desert behold me, controls me
My hypothesis is burning
I'm blurring
And morphing
From stone to sand
Flashes of hate burn my irises when I'm afraid
I cannot keep working on strategies to run away
