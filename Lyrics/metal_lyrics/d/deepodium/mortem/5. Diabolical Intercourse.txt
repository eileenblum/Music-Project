Trough the eyes of humanity
A light of doom, a falling star
It's the right moment to give the last funeral ritesA craving for life
A last breath in his chest
Abandoned by his god
Celestial tears becoming prayers
Weaping an angel falls
Burning wings, shattered heart
A poisoned gift offered...
Oferred by his God! "As you die, I spit in thy flesh
Receiving thy blood as a trophy
Your life his complete and fullfilled
You have served me well, indeed!"
An angel corpse descends from above
Spreading his wings, a trail of blood
Leaving the sky in purple red
As tears of pain are shedWhere his your creed now?
