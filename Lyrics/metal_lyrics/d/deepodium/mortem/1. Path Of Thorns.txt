Fire ravish from shore to shore
Burning, feeding upon our sore
Grim land, burned land, ashes our fall
Taking from us the essence of allWe are the sons of desire
We're burning in a ring of fire
The sons of desire
Burning in a ring of fire "Feel the flames as they rise to the sky
Embrace the flames as they purify" Scourge of all men
Fire sweeping the land
Ashes become our fall
Scourge of us allThorns! Trowing us into our path of thorns!
Sending us into our path of thorns! We are the sons of desire
We're burning in a ring of fire
The sons of desire
Burning in a ring of fire
