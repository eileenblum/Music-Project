[Music: Darkwater, Lyrics: Wassholm]

Nothing rocks this perfect world
All is locked in place
All is tried and true today
We have found our ways

Stuck
We're stuck in static motion
Repeat
Repeat and fade away

Same old answers to every new question
Same old reasons for everything
Same dismissal for every new suggestion
Nothing ends here so nothing can begin

Nothing rocks this perfect world
All is locked in place
All is tried and true today
We have found our ways

Let me go down
I need to hit the ground
Break this habit, turn around
Find a new direction

We are where we've always been
No one's surprised by this
We take no chances
Oh, this is well rehearsed
All words have been said before
But I repeat them still
What I wouldn't give for changes now
For another game to play
This is just by force of habit now
There is nothing left to say

Let me go down
I need to hit the ground
Break this habit, turn around
Find a new direction

If I could take it back
If I could make amends
For all the mistakes I've made
Why would I hesitate

We've been walking the beaten path
Played the parts we think we're given
It's so much easier keeping it up
Than admitting surrender
We've blamed and we've grown away
Everything exchangeable
I have only myself to blame
If I don't change directions
Only mirrors
Stand in my way
From today

Let me go down
I need to hit the ground
Break this habit, turn around
Let me go down
I need to hit the ground
Break this habit, turn around
Find my way
