[Music: BÃ¥th / Sigfridsson, Lyrics: BÃ¥th]

All these eyes that I face
Black and numb, cold, disgraced
Reveals me and laughs at me
Into these eyes I stare
An endless deep, I can't bear it anymore

You break me down
I'm lost, I'm found
I can not see
Is it all about me?

Shattered
Reveal the truth to me
Shattered
I'm far too close to see
I question every part of this
I twist, I turn, forever bound
I'm shattered
Will I hit the ground

One step up two steps down
Has broken me to the sound
Of tattered dreams soiled with screams
I've lost the meaning of all
I try to rise but I fall again

You broke me down
I'm lost. I'm found
Too late, to see
It's all about me

Shattered
Reveal the truth to me
Shattered
I'm just too blind to see
I question every part of this
I twist, I turn, forever bound
I'm shattered
Once again I hit the ground

I question every thought inside me
Just to break down this
wall you once built
Seeing things never meant to be seen
I try, I fly, then I die

Shattered
Reveal the truth to me
Shattered
I'm far too close to see
I question every part of this
I twist, I turn, forever bound
I'm shattered
Trust in nothing reach for bliss
Shattered pieces on the ground
Reveals the truth to me
Lies projected in my mind
I'm far too close to see
I question every part of this
I twist, I turn, forever bound
I'm shattered
Will I hit the ground again
