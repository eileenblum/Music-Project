[Music: Sigfridsson / BÃ¥th, Lyrics: Sigfridsson]

You made me fall again
The fear won't go away
tears never stop to fall
I made a sacrifice
I gave it all away

Shadows call again
I fight my fears in vain
I can not stop the pain
I guess I'll live this way
until you fade away

I'm trying to forget

Oh, again and again I try
But your eyes will not leave my mind
Oh, again and again

I may seem well, I'm not
My body's just a shell
for an inside hell
I am your sacrifice
you gave me all away

I won't take this fall, I won't
Fera may still be there
my tears still remain
But my wounds will heal
no more for you to steal

I'm trying to forgive

Oh, again and again I try
And your image will leave my mind
Oh, again and again

I guess that the remorse you feel
For what you've done
Is too strong for you to wield

Oh, again and again I try
Your image will leave my mind
Oh, again and again I try
Your sin won't end my life
Oh, again and again
