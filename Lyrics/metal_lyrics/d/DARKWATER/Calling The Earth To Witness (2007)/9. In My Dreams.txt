[Music: Sigfridsson / BÃ¥th, Lyrics: BÃ¥th]

I can't believe this
progression meets the skeptic eye
Even a child can see it
how can they be so blind
Forward I'm reaching
trying to cope
Touched by discretion
is there no hope

close yet so far
Lead me and you'll see me turn
Rise all my stars
Leave me and you'll see me burn

In my dream there'd be nothing
that I could not do
In my dreams you would find me
just as good as you

Trespassing my mind
a thousand tears I hold inside
Have I no integrity
or should I just close my eyes
forever we've seen this
power abuse
I need your help here
cause what if we lose

Close yet so far
Leaving me breathless again
Rise all my stars
Come and let me fall asleep

In my dreams you would find me
talking like you do
In my dreams you would find me
just as good as you

How long will we believe
How long will we deceive
Will you ever confess
I'm calling the earth to witness

Close not so far
Follow and I'll show the way
Rise to the stars
Let us turn night into day

In my dreams you would find me
just as good as new
In my dreams there'd be nothing
that I could not do
In my dreams you would find me
touching like you do
In my dreams you would find me
just as good as you
