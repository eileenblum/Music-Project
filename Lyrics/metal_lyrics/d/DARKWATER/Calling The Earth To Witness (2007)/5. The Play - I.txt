[Music: Holmberg / BÃ¥th, Lyrics: BÃ¥th]

"To those it may concern", a full page of words. I'm leaving you
Though the fire inside s till burns, this shell I've become is consuming me
As painful as it can be, I'm open for you to see my enemy
As though I've never been close to anyone I still feel it, I miss it

And I can see no sense at all
I've tried so hard to break my fall
And all around me people say
"He's turned his life into a play"

Quietly I'm there, one step closer to despair, they do not see
this struggle within me, I thought stronger I would be, God, I was wrong

And I can see no sense at all
I've tried so hard to break my fall
I never meant to fly this way
But in the end it's all a play...
