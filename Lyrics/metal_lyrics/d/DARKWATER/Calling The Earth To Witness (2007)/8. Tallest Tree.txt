[Music: Holmberg, Lyrics: Wassholm]

A winter's on its way
I feel it coming closer
Colder every day now
But I will let it come
I'll let it wash me over
'Til all my limbs go numb
Then I won't have to move
Then I'll have lost my way and
You will tell me: "My baby,
If you can't find your way
Then I will find it for you
Don't you worry"

Look at me
Did I think that you'd be there for me
After all I can see through this
I'm not blind
It's as if I had made up my mind
Not to go any closer than this

You're not the one for me
You're not the one I dream of
No, you're much too close now
I've always been this way
I only dare the lowest branches
Of the tallest tree
But I will change my ways
I will face my fears
I'll climb up to the top of
You are my tallest tree
And I will keep on climbing
Don't you worry

Look at me
Now I'm where I've been wanting to be
I have waited so long for this
I've been blind
I have been such a coward at times
Now I've finally opened my eyes

Good things come to those who take them
Nothing's left for those who are waiting

A winter's on its way
I feel it getting colder
Closer day by day now
And you'd be frozen stiff
If you were on your own
But this time I've got your back
If you can't find your way
Then I will find it for you
I'll be there for you baby
If you can't find your way
Then I'll find it for you
Don't you worry

Look at me
Did I think it was not up to me
Did I think could wait for this
I'm not blind
Though I've been such a coward at times
All it took was to open my eyes
