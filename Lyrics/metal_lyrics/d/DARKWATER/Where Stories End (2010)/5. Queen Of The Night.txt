[Music: BÃ¤th, Holmberg - Lyrics: BÃ¤th]

I feel, I breathe, I have my life right in my hands
Still I fear my command is not enough
Take this weight off of me
Watch me break constantly
Just one touch and I come to light
Queen of the night
I'm down so deep cannot sleep without you now
Break the trust you break my lust for life again
Ever step that I've taken
Has brought me far and wide
But every chance I've forsaken
Has slowly ripped my from my pride
In shadows life's begun
All I do you make undone
Take this weight off of me
Watch me break constantly
Just one touch and I come to light
Queen of the night
Breathe my pain
And let me in
Under your skin
And slowly go insane
I won't fail this time
I may not break the chain today
But I'll try
And I'll die
And I'll fade away
Never turn to life
Take this weight off of me
Watch me break constantly
Just one touch and we reunite
Far from the light
Take your eyes off of me
And I'll break constantly
Just one touch and I come to light
I cannot believe
How can I believe
You will not deceive me
Queen of the night
