[Music and lyrics: Sigurdsson]

When night and day unite
And dreams turn to dust
Another day to be
Consumed in tragedy
Calamity
You're set up to be free
But the mirror lies to you
Wafting every fear within me
Downing inside
Fatal was your mode this time
Know that, you're the one who follows
A fool's utopia
Leave this season in its color
Your standing on the edge
Beneath a troubled sky
Your faith was all you had
Now it's shattered on the ground
Calamity
Not set up to be weak
But the mirror lies to you
Walking every fear within me
Downing inside
Fatal was your mode this time
Know that, you're the one who follows
A fool's utopia
Leave this season in its color
Calamity
Waking every fear within me
Drowning inside
Fatal was your mode this time
Know that, you're the one who follows
A fool's utopia
Leave this season in its color
Remember, you're the one who follows
A fool's utopia
Leave this season in its color
