[Music: BÃ¤th, Holmberg - Lyrics: BÃ¤th]

For as long as I can recall
I've been misunderstood
Every step and every heartbeat
Has felt denied
I fear change will never come
So clear nothing will be done
Break down life itself and see
Bow down to what is left of me
I can't believe I'm still alive
But this time is mine
Still I must dream just to get by
Slowly fade away
This is why I bleed for this world
Take on the pain as my own
See tears falling down, crash to the ground
This is who we are
I feel I cannot breathe anymore
Until this world comes alive
This is why I bleed
This is why I bleed
Many years has passed since then still
The memories linger on
As I wake and turn from my dreams
I see
Wake now feel the changes come
See how this madness comes undone
Break free, our inner self we'll trust
You will see believe not turns to dust
I can now feel I'm alive
This time is mine
I can now dream, I'll get by
Never fade away
This is why I bleed for this world
Take on the pain as my own
See tears falling down, crash to the ground
This is who we are
I feel I cannot breathe anymore
Until this world comes alive
This is why I bleed
This is why I bleed
Lost in a world in between
Sorrow and pain is what I've seen
I can now feel I'm alive
This time is mine
I can now dream, I'll get by
Never fade away
This is why I bleed for this world
Take on the pain as my own
I feel I cannot breathe anymore
I crash to the ground
This is why I bleed
This is who we are
This is why I bleed
Bleed for this world
Take on the pain as my own
I feel I cannot breathe anymore
Until this world comes alive
This is why I bleed
This is why I bleed
