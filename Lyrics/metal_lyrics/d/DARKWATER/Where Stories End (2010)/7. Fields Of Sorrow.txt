[Music and lyrics: Sigfridson]

I fear, that I'm losing it all
I hear, there's nothing I can do
On this, path where I've been so long
I seek, for now my soul is torn
An ever waking mind claims their might
And every day for them is a wait for night
(I've seen then) they dwell within the shadows
Outcast be their kind
I've seen them running i fields of sorrow
The forsaken ones
I feel, that I'm losing it all
I bleed, for things I can't control
I've tried, to leave all my fears behind
I am joining the forsaken ones
An ever waking mind claims their might
And every day for them is a wait for night
(I've seen then) they dwell within the shadows
Outcast be their kind
I've seen them running i fields of sorrow
The forsaken ones
In despair they flight for their lives
All because or your sacred delusion
Blinded, I started at the sun for too long
I cry, how I ever could come clean
I breath, the that's spread everywhere
I know, I don't want to play this scene
An ever waking mind claims their might
And every day for them is a wait for night
(I've seen then) they dwell within the shadows
Outcast be their kind
I've seen them running i fields of sorrow
The forsaken ones
