[Music: Holmberg, BÃ¤th - Lyrics: BÃ¤th]

Welcome winter, ice and snow
One last breath then leave forever
Once more she wakes up
A dream she knows well
A feeling of sorrow just won't leave her side
Just a block away
He leaves his home in anger and dismay
He leaves it all behind
But nothing can erase it from his mind
All can change in the blink of an eye
We can hear the screams from inside of her mind
Leaves the scene in one beat of his heart
But nothing all can change in a blink of an eye
Welcome sorrow, pain and dirt
Meet the emptiness we're made of
Walks just this one time
A fear something's wrong
A moment so desperate for an instant change she'll fly
Make her fly
Somewhere deep inside
There is  a sense of coldness he can't hide
The feeling makes him blind
We can't erase the picture in his mind
All can change in the blink of an eye
We can hear the screams from inside of her mind
Leaves the scene in one beat of his heart
But nothing all can change in a blink of an eye
She breathes in deep as fears growing stronger
And sees the lights one second too late
A scream and she ain't there no longer
We prays to all
Let her breathe, let her breathe
All can change in the blink of an eye
We can hear the screams from inside of her mind
Leaves the scene in one beat of his heart
But nothing all can change in a blink of an eye
