[Music: BÃ¤th, Holmberg - Lyrics: BÃ¤th]

All I need from this life is forgiveness, nothing else
But all I see all around me is madness, so what's it like to
To be seen, be loved, be touched, be safe and feel alive
Won't you just be kind enough to try
Leave me, where can I turn, be safe and not get burned
Why is life so painful
Won't you find me a place to call home
So I won't be alone, blind me with your lies
It's time to fly
Every step of the way has been tearful, but I've done my best
To hold it in and not be fearful, like all the rest so
I have crawled, I've kicked, I've screamed without a sound
And I've quietly turned to the shadows cause you'll have done
Is acting like I'm air to bring me down
Leave me, where can I turn, be safe and not get burned
Why is life so painful
Won't you find me a place to call home
So I won't be alone, blind me with your lies
It's time to fly
If I can't bear this pain, and I can't find a way
The darkness will remain, no reason left to stay
Leave me, where can I turn, be safe and not get burned
Why is life so painful
Won't you find me a place to call home
So I won't be alone, blind me with your lies
It's time to fly
