[Music: Holmberg, BÃ¤th - Lyrics: BÃ¤th]

See there is one we
You can never be a part of me
I have always thought I would never find some peace of mind
But now I'll see I've left fears behind
Just one final touch
Feel my weakness go I can't see
This is just too much
Coldness covers me
Take me with you
Into your dreams
Cause you're the air that I breathe now
Take me to your
Fantasy
Cause you're the pain I need now
No one see the scars  when they're deep within under my skin
A secret so obscure, let me in
I can feel it burn
In every breath and ever tear
Will I ever learn
Nothing left to fear
Take me with you
Into your dreams
Cause you're the air that I breathe now
Take me to your
Fantasies
Cause you're the pain I need now
