[Music and lyrics: Sigfridson]

Surrounding me, walls of deception
From what I believe
In my heart, tears of rejection
For what you've become
I'm bound to this pain
And time will never heal this wound
Expected to return
To what I once was
I will not walk that way
Expected to be strong
But I'll not give way again
Relentless I'm
When the walls came down on me
I refused to believe
When the sky grey dark on me
You were to blind to see
Silence form you hurts me more
Than I ever thought
The words from you, they built the wall
That came down on me
You said you brought the solution
To us, I not ean recall it
You go, wherever they lead you
To weak, to resist their ordain
We're all in the same field
We're all in too deep
We all have to face our sorrow
I guess this is your creed
These days, to nothing we yield
And together we bleed
Silence form you hurts me more
Than I ever thought
The words from you, they built the wall
That came down on me
Expected to return
To what I once was
I will not walk that way
Expected to be strong
But I'll not give way again
Relentless I'm
