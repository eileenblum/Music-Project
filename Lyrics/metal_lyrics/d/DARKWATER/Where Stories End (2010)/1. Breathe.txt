[Music: Holmberg, BÃ¤th -  Lyrics: BÃ¤th]

Lost in this fear, my wrongs are so close
Much too late to make amends
Ripped from my hands, deprived from my life
All will soon come to an end
I can see you, still can hear you
All with me, torn apart
I feel you breathe beside me
I won't let you go without me
Time cannot heal, this pain so unreal
Life has been no friend of mine
It twist and it turns, by failure I learn
All too late cause this could be divine
Nothing lasts in my hands
It slips through like sand
I can see you, still can hear you
All with me, torn apart
I feel you breathe beside me
I won't let you go without me
Life could be divine, but nothing lasts in my hand
It slips through like sand
I feel you breathe beside me
I won't let you go without me
So just breathe
I feel you breathe beside me
I won't let you go without me
