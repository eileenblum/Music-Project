On the outside looking in
Everything appears okay
Right here

We'll do what we want
Our destiny may be our own
No matter what?

But why refuse to see
Why bear a cross that can't be seen
That no one else can feel

How come you hide your self within
An archetype that is so old
Now, there is so much to know

I'm here, right in front of you
I can not believe that you can't see this too
It's right in front of you
It's right in front of you
I'm right in front of...

Another heaven awaits us
Utopia to come our way
Another fairy tale

They'll do as they please
Our future deemed in unknown hands
No matter what?

But I refuse to be weak
Carry a burden 'cause you can't see
The way things really are

How come you just hide your self
Inside this monumental fortress
When we can make it fall

I'm here, right in front of you
I can not believe that you can't see this too
It's right in front of you
It's right in front of you
I'm right in front of...
