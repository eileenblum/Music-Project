In the frozen winter
Through the ice and through the snow
I'm walking right beside you
But little do you know

I broke your trust, forgive me
But I was only ten
My hands, they slipped, I'm cold now
I'll never fall again

I was only playing with my friends
I was on my way back home

Into the cold
Over the mountains
I will follow wherever you go
Over the seas
Across the oceans
I will travel through space and time

And like a silent whisper
Confiding in the wind
My strength in life has always
Been coming from within

But you're no longer near
And all I feel is fear

I wish you could see me
Fading in the dark
But life has turned against me
I wonder where you are

I can't find my way back home

Into the cold
Over the mountains
I will follow wherever you go
Over the seas
Across the oceans
I will travel through space and time

"As darkness closes in
The coldness grows stronger
And as his journey has just begun
Mother nature won't take him to the ground"

And he can hear their voices now
Calling in the night
But he grows weaker so just how
Will he find the light

Breaking through is sunrise
A ray of light on skin
A sense of desperation
They all feel within

And now he only sees them
From a distance far away
One last "goodbye" he whispers
"I can no longer stay"

Into your dreams
Into the sunrise
I will always be there for you
Out of the dark
Far from the shadows
I have finally found my way back home
