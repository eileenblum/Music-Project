Deep, cold
Lost strength now, drown

Thought I'd never see the light of day
Will I ever be awake?
Will I ever reach that dawn once more?
In the evening I will spread my wings and try to fly again

"I am king of the night, yet I haven't conquered the day"

I will fly!
Into the light of dawn, leave where I hide
Try to find a way to break this cage
Time to emerge!

I sense the dawn but I'm turning to the night
Feeling secure in the shadows where I dwell
Hunting for prey by the pale light from the moon
But I will return

Rise, breathe
Swim ashore, emerge!

I will rise, but you hold me down
But I will try reach the tallest tree
Into the morning when I finally leap and fly with all my might

I will fly!
Into the light of dawn, leave where I hide
Try to find a way to break this cage
Time to emerge!

Leaving the ground, leaving this scene now
I see the landscape change beneath and I
Hold my head high
No longer I fear
I know I can fly

I will fly!
Into the light of dawn, leave where I hide
Try to find a way to break this cage

Night or day
No matter when I fly, I will not hide
If I fall I'll learn to rise again
Learn how to live
