I know, we have our burdens
But I feel that we could be
So much more than we are
Is this why we leave?
I know that we're fallen
But I can never let it go

In a heartbeat we could
Turn away from all we have
Our days of old, be passed away
Like the sands through the hourglass

I would hate to see us here
Falling for another lie
If we could mend our mistakes
Maybe it would take forever, for us

If I confide in you
Would I be redeemed like you?

I can't keep the dark out
It always seems to seep right through
I just cannot fathom
The wisdom you're suppose to carry

If I would dare to meet you
Turn away from all I have
Could it wash my sins away?
Would it take us through forever?

If I confide in you
Would I be redeemed like you?

I know, we have our burdens
But I feel that we could be
So much more than we are
Is this why we leave?
I know that we're fallen
But I can never let it go!

If I confide in you
Would I be redeemed like you?
If I confide in you
Would I be redeemed like you?
Oh yeah... oh...
