She could never see beyond
The color of her own skin
No matter what tomorrow brings her
So hard to change within

She grew up into this darkness
It's in her mind
In her soul
But we can always break the silence
No matter what we're told

You can run and you can hide
But remember you only have one life
Never take for granted
What you've got and what you're given
I might lose and I might fall
But I will fight against it all
One last time
One last try to make me feel

He was never satisfied
No matter how hard they tried
But greed will always make you weaker
So find another way

He was taught to feed his hunger
Always wanting more
So much more
But we can always make us stronger
And change us at the core

You can run and you can hide
But remember you only have one life
Never take for granted
What you've got and what you're given
I might lose and I might fall
But I will fight against it all
One last time
One last try to make me feel
Alive

"When we're giving up
And when we're giving in
And let the colors fade in this world
We will lose it all"

One last time...
One last try...to feel alive

You can run and you can hide
But remember you only have one life
Never take for granted
What you've got and what you're given
I might lose and I might fall
But I will fight against it all
One last time
One last try to make me feel
Alive
