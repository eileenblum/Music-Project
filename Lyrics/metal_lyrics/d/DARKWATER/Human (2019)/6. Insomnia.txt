Now if you hold me dear
If I am close to you
Then life could alter in the night

If I would speak to you
And you would answer me
Then we could turn this darkness into ever lasting light

We, can we ever make it through
Oh, can I ever trust in you - you leave this up to me

And so we fall for the lie
That we will never find
A time to abide, and leave this all behind

When I close my eyes
Within this withered place
What can break this malice course
Here I lie awake
Embraced insomnia
Without you there's nothing left to perpetuate

The lights are off and I am lost
Strike my mind and let me dream (insomnia)

If we embrace our fears
And help each other then
We can walk ways that we did not dare before

Why don't I care to take your hand
And choose this world with you
We could fly beyond where no-one else have ever been

We, can we ever make it through
Oh, can I ever trust
We, will we ever make it through
Oh, can I ever trust in you - you leave this up to me

And so we fall for the lie
That we will never find
A place in time, to leave this all behind

When I close my eyes
Within this withered place
What can break this malice course
Here I lie awake
Embraced insomnia
Without you there's nothing left to perpetuate

And so we fall for the lie
That we will never find
A place in time, to leave this all behind

I lay these words to rest
Never to be found
I leave this place, in my heart and mind

When I close my eyes
Within this withered place
What can break this malice course
Here I lie awake
Embraced insomnia
Without you there's nothing left to perpetuate
