Waking up into a silent world
I open my eyes, a broken earth I find
A time will come for us to rise and change
So we tell the stories once denied, and let our colors fly

See the coldness all around you
Take control over what you've done

I can't take anymore
So I'm turning pages
Need this world to come alive
Or colors will fade
Turn into cold grey
Nothing more than empty lies
Feeding our society

Walking down the road of fame and greed
(Give me more, so much more)
The more you show the more you will succeed
(...take...it...off...)
So take control, forgive and let it go
But you bring the stories to the ground
And let your spirit die

Feel the darkness that surrounds you
Take it in and see what you have done

I can't take anymore
So I'm turning pages
Need this world to come alive
Or colors will fade
Turn into cold grey
Nothing more than empty
Lies
Feeding our society
Lies
Breaking what we could have been
Lies
Tears me up inside

I will not
Break the trust that I have been given
Or feed your lust to be in control
And veil the sun, it's all just a misconception
I will not
Break

All that we are is falling to pieces
Will we ever break these chains?
We need to find our way back home

I can't take anymore
So I'm turning pages
Need this world to come alive
Or colors will fade
Turn into cold grey
Nothing more than empty lies
We can't wait anymore
We're turning pages
We need this world to break these
Lies
Hiding what we would have seen
Lies
Breaking what we could have been
Lies
Feeding our society
