I can sense you
Through the mist in the moonlit night
Shadows dancing
To the beat of the pounding heart

The nocturnal breeze
It whispers my name
It alters my spirit and feeds my pain

I can feel you
In my veins and inside my mind...

I cannot believe
It's tearing my mind, and I
I cannot deceive
My hunger for pain, though I tried

Wake me up from this slumber
In the morning I stare at the face of despair

I cannot hide
Dreading for the day
I fear the moment
The moment when I'm lost

I can see, but I won't believe this
The reflection of me; nothing lives, nothing dies
Will I see this forever?
In the morning I fear the mirrors truth

Darkness will rise
It's holding my heart
Taking control of my senses

Take me!
I will not run
Break me!
Use my soul and
Own me!
I will not feel, I'll embrace this beast

I cannot believe
It's tearing my mind, and I
I cannot deceive
My hunger for pain, though I lied

Waking to the state I've been turned
Darkness all around and in my mind
You will stand before me, loosing hope
Waiting for the screams to be heard
Feeding on your fear, it's my reward
You cannot escape this, that's when you bleed

Am I lost now?
Will I wake up?
I'm numb and lifeless
Will I fight this... or loose?

Through the window shines the crescent moonlight
The empty wall reveals a missing portrait... of me... it's lost
Seeking for myself in desperation, am I gone?!
The mirror shows me my reflection turned to stone

Scream and say my name, but no-one answers
Can't remember how I used to look like
Now I'm gone

The night's approaching
It's close but I won't turn into... you

Cause I won't let you
Take my spirit nor take my soul!

I will not fear
Searching through my mind
The mirror shows me
Reflecting what is real

I cannot believe
It's tearing my mind, and I
I cannot deceive
My hunger for pain

I cannot believe
Reflecting my soul, and I
I cannot be free
Until it's gone, this beast inside

How I tried...
How I lied...
How I cried...
