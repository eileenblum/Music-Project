Breathe and let the poison in
Inhale the words in silence
One more soul consumed by fear
You have broken every rule
You've fallen way too deep now
Just one more can bring you down
Just one more will bring you to the ground

It's been like this for ages now
The truth has been condemned into your dreams
By all their schemes
But I could never follow you
The lies you told are ripping at the seams
And the broken ones will see

So I will never fly with you
My fallen angel
I feel time is over due
For your tomorrow
This time you will see... me

You are hiding your intentions
Deceiving your own heartbeats
But I could never play that game
Wait just a minute more
Someday the truth might find you
One of these days it will be clear
One of these days all you'll hear is

(Will you) turn the page
Turn this sleeping darkness into day
Right from your grave
Will you ever close the door
And find a new beginning if we fall
So we can rise above it all

So I will never fly with you
My fallen angel
I feel time is over due
For your tomorrow
This time you will see me

So I will never fly with you
My fallen angel
I feel time is over due
For your tomorrow
No I will never fly with you
My fallen angel
I could have lived and died for you
And your tomorrow
This time I will be... free
