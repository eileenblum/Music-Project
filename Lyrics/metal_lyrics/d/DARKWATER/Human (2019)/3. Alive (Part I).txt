What is there to be done
About the world today
A thousand million stars
Surround us as we lay
Turning from the light
And falling into sleep
Wondering who we are
And are we in too deep

But people everywhere
Keep falling in between
The truth will set you free
Is that reality?
Where am I coming from
Where am I going to
I will go to rest
Thinking
I am just like you
