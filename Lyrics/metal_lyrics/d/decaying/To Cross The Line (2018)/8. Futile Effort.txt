Sent on a mission
The standard has been met
Pain and misery are awaiting
A steady advance
Through a cruel terrain
Paving the way
With a daring stand

Across the field
Proceeding in a strict formation
Retaining a steady pace
Over the top
Let another wave enter in
There's no chance of turning back

Shelled away
A field ridden with barbwire
Centered on the sanctity of war

The slaughter begins
At easy targets on open ground
Defenses have sustained the shelling
Gunned down
No option to answer back
After great plans devastation prevails

Looking at the result
No further adjustments
Not a single meter gained
