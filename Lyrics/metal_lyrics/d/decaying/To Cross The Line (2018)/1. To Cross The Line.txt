Crossing the line
Now involved in a conflict
To calculate arsenal and relocate
Strike without a warning
Exploit the occasion, interfere
Reverse the outcome

Throwing the best into the fray
Undermining obsolete tactics
Ignite well-oiled machine
Trigger an onslaught
To protect own needs

The science of domination
Regionally based reasoning underlined
