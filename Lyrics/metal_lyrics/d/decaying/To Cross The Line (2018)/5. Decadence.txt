Hungry for power
Ridden with a disease
Spewing lies, a necessity to divide
Depending on control, causing detest
Authoritarian by nature

Thriving on money and deceit
Being as corrupt as one can get

Living in a safe zone
Free word is denied
Spreading conflicts across the region
For one's own good

Thriving on war, money and deceit
Being as corrupt as one is able to get
Paying tribute to one's own benefits
Doing favors
While getting rid of the rest

Thriving on war and deceit
Being as corrupt as one is able to get
