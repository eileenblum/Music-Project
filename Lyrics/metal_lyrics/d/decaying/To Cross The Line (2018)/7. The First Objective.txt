Enter, being the first to charge
Careful plans in motion
Area softened but unswept
Mines have been laid
Setting foot on hostile ground
The sand hinders the movement
A quiet moment now ensues
The invasion has begun

Entrenching is out of question
Landing force is in total disarray
Barbed wire and obstacles
Pinned down in heavy fire

Looking for a cover in a quick manner
As the defensive guns blaze
More troops are pouring in
Wave after wave
Objective is to push through
Beachhead must be obtained
Clear the surroundings
Just to get through

The first step in a greater plan
The landing, if successful
Push the enemy back
A beachhead provides the groundwork
Next, unleash the logistics
And aim for the heartland
