A sudden change of power
Volatile situation is worsening
Causing friction
The system is rigged

A covert operation
Object to destabilize
They incite foreign interference
To receive help from overseas

Soon finding common ground
Arming up the revel factions
Downing aircraft with modern arms
Surprise the foe

A crucial factor
Expand structure
Funneling more funds
It's called attrition
Force them out

A goal is reached
Yet neglect will cause disorder
