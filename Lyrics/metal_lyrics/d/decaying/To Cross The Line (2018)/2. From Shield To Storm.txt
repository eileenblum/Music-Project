Launching a new phase
Which marks a shift as
The desert shield is now over
Destroy the enemy radar
Guided strikes with maximum effect

The fields of fire
Annihilating resistance
At an early hour
Communications are down

Swarming now above the desert
With ease rendering the outdated foe useless
Advanced warfare, correct sighting
Laser guided modern precision

Defying the odds
Invading, a lack of common sense
With even worse timing
All alone, having only the option to dig in
Assumptions have been proven wrong

Total disarray
Low on morale
Many surrender
Without a fight

Forced into retreat
Totally devastated
Scorched earth
A major defeat
