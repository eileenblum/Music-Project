Desperation begins to mount
It's high time, take the needed action
The source of income is again threatened
Much better to secure the supply
There's no standing aside

Distributing peace and order
The end justifies the means

Taking care of the needs
Fueling up industries
For the sake of common good
Declaring great success in a rightful way
This is new found unity
A pile of ashes and dust

Distributing peace and order
The end justifies the means

It's a modern perception of freedom
To wage war in distant locations
Always seeking for peace and order
As the end always justifies the means
