In search of a region
A territorial dispute
Thereâs a need to recapture
Without knowing the cost

Invasion force
To capture the key targets
A coordinated blow
The goal has been reached

Mission successful
As the ruler has been switched

A quick response
To an undeclared war
Gathering an elite force
The glory must be restored

The plan was successful
As the ruler was finally switched
But the destination is in the horizon
At dawn comes the strike

Face the facts
As nothing comes for free
Impending action
A conflict is now in sight

With a clear advantage
Bases situated nearby
Still unable to fully defend
Against superior arms
All in vain

Face the facts
As nothing comes for free
Can't take everything for granted
Now just lay down the arms
