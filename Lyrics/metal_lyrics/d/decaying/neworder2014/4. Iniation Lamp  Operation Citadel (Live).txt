Eight thousand tanks clashing
In the Operation Zitadelle
A German offensive
To help retrieve the initiative in the east

The largest armoured battle
Campaing launched in 1943
After the crushing defeat of Stalingrad
Pin them down, once and for all

Planning on encirclement
But suprise factor was long lost
Good soviet intelligence
Preparations were bold

The line of defense
Built to slow the spearheads down
Anti-tank, vast minefields
With blitzkrieg Wehrmacht again marches forth

The northern operation is a failure
Germans fell short
In the southern face:
The battle of Prokhorovka rages on

Merciless outburst of lead
Steel rain from every direction
As motorized battalions collide
On Russian soil

When the stakes were high
Soon short of fuel, out of armor
As waffen-SS spearheads meet
The Russian superioty, T-34

Tide finally turns
The operation is called off
Axis fails to conquer
In the battle of Kursk
