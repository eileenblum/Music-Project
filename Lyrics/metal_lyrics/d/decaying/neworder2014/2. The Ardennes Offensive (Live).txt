Calling for the last reserves
For this great attack
No mercy will be given
Striking through the Ardennes
Once again with a formidable force
From the scattered remnants
Logistic miracle of some sort

Firmly depending on this
The last hope, even if desperate
Extreme fuel sortage
Along with exhausted men
Fed with propaganda
Expecting to create confusion
And neutralize the western front

It had to be under bad weather conditions
Only option was an surprise attack
Absolute Allied air superioty above
As the German planes just wouldn't be able to fly

Just too proud of letting it go
Even though the chances on Antwerp were abysmal
Heavy planning at last offers a solution
To mess up the Allied game
Drafted so long, firmly in secrecy

Beginning the offensive with great sensation
Ninety minutes of artillery strikes
The heavy winter storms are raging on
The roads are blocked, it's nobodies gain anymore

Heavy casualties on the rise
A cruesome realisation to the enemy lines
The initial success quickly goes sour
This advance is forced into an halt at Bastogne
The Battle Of The Bulge
