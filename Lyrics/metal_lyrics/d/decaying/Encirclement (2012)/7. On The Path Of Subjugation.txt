Frozen bodies
Lines of destroyed tanks
Cold and relentless
Weather unforgiving
Fierce winter warfare against
Operant guerilla movements
Charging the Mannerheim line
With a three to one force ratio

During the phoney war, 1939
Others stay far away
Waiting for the imminent to happen
Stalin's orders  
Written in the secret pact,
The spheres of influence
Allowing the Soviet advance

Alleged shellings  
The excuse of Mainila 
Given as a reason to conduct the campaign
And to spread the thought, to annex the land
Preparations for a parade
Bad failure, embarrassment

Forty degrees below zero
One shot, instant freeze
Alligned to head forward
To heed the generals' inexperienced pleas

Affected by the Great Purge 
Encircled to an massive extent
Never ending areas of forests and snow
Failing to subjugate, major surprise for Kreml

Frozen bodies
Lines of destroyed tanks
Cold and relentless
Weather unforgiving
Fierce winter warfare against
Operant guerilla movements
Charging the Mannerheim line
Experience the Winter War
