Receiving orders 
Down from the high command
With plans to move forward
Once again in this mess they call war

Final words were shed
In this hell, this battlefield
Machine guns will not fail 
As the bullet rain hits the flesh

Endless casualties
Over one million dead
Obsolete tactics blended with
Modern armament

Entrenched
In the battle of Somme
The indecisive event
Once a morbid mess

Blood spilled everywhere
Thousands of men now lay dead
First battle to introduce tanks 
An unforgiving hell
Fighting for the fatherland
Desperately making a stand
Trench warfare supreme
All the divisions clash

Indecisive result
Nobody in benefit
Five months of bloodbath
The fierce fighting for the Somme

The startup of the encounter
First day of July, unbelieveable carnage toward the brits
Exit the trench when the order is whistled
Few seconds to live, machine gun torrents mow you to bits
The failures on the tactical side
Human wave assault, the death toll will mount
Unprepared for the misery - just a mad waste of human lives

What's the price for a mile?
Is there any substance behind bravery and honour?
To enter the no man's land
Or to die in the distress of those trench lines
Unable to reach the objectives
Set by the old men around the stuffed tables
Experiencing the hell, horrors of war
Depending on luck, not on reason
