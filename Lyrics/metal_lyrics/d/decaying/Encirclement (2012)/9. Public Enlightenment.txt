Feed on the information
Lines of data sent straight to your brain
Reading it so blindly, a necessity to gather knowledge
Follow the news, and all the papers you hold trustful
Hear the politicians speak and adopt to their vision so true

The public's opinion is fragile
Always controlled by the machinery hidden so well
Behind the curtains of the so-called free, unbiased media
Which the interest groups aim to heavily dictate

From a child to adult, environment guides the direction
Shaping the starting point, later just to be enhanced

They say that you live in a world without any worries
Where everything is going to a right direction, no matter what

Pictures, articles, video footage, the truth
All they have to offer is that one, narrow-minded view

Limiting information
Propaganda, public enlightenment
A constant stream of different agendas

The people's opinion is fragile
Always controlled by the machinery hidden 
Behind the curtains of the so-called free and unbiased media
Which the interest groups aim heavily to dictate, deceit
