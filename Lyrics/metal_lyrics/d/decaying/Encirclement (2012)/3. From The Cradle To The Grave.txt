Old hierarchy long gone
New ideology holds the power
Executed are those once in rule
Constitution is rewritten, other parties in denial

Confliction in theories
Contrasts seen, now waging war
No matter with any politics
Driven by greed, leading to casualties

From the cradle to the grave

Perishing in battle
Brutally agonized 
Believing all words
The leaders say
Being guided to death

The human body
So fragile and weak
When exposed to pain, and suffer
Paralysed, wounded or be dead

Extreme right-wing or the radical left
Political message differs, 
Forms to an hostility

Now awoken to a conflict
Of imagination based ideologies
Where the other side seen as plain infidels

Cities now ruined, millions meet their graves
Later on judging it all
It's tragic how hallow things can be

Placed deep into the history
Another conflict, relates to it's time
