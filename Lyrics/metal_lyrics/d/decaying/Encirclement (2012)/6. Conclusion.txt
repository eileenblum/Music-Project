Feel the rope tieing around your neck
No more luck, this will be the end
All the things accomplished
Now withered and vaporized
From ashes to ashes
From dust to dust
Now just losing control
And watching as it falls apart

Not once in a lifetime
The opportunity nobody had
Offered salvation
Through a upsetting revolution 

Losing grip, the end - it draws near
Turning insane, increasing fear
Paranoia and hopelessness
The nation razed to the ground

Staring the papers 
Trapped inside
Should I let go?
Who can be trusted?

The final blow
Full society collapse
The foundations shake
Tyranny cripples down
Useless appointments
Before the overclass
Elite, organized groups
Now just meaningless, meaningless

Once strenght in numbers
Grimly deceased
Rulers are gone
Enemy at the gates
Hopeless people
In ongoing chaos
What can be done
The options are non-existant, they are gone

The occupier
The celebrated victory
World renowned salvation
In the general people's eyes
One tyranny has fallen
While the other grew stronger
The worldwide balance
Not greatly improved

Feel the rope tieing around your neck
No more luck, this will be the end
All the things accomplished
Now withered and vaporized
From ashes to ashes
From dust to dust
Now just losing control
And watching as it falls apart
