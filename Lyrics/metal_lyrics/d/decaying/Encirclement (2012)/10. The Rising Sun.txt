Rising to arms
An glorified existence
The empire of the rising sun
Above all, the choices were set
To expansion
"All the world under one roof"

Expanding the territory
To boost the industrial strenght
Gaining more influence
And seeking space from the near west

The conqueror of the seas
Their mighty fleet
Full control of the Pacific Sea
Seems at first unstoppable force
Devastation in Pearl Harbour
Astonishing the Allied corps

"May the sacred one lead
Respect the divine"

Destined to rule the whole world
By the sacred emperor
The descedant of the sun goddess
Entitled to dominate

Seized the occasion
First rapid area control
Then plans to defend
To wipe out the US force
"Greater East Asia war"
Conflict in multiple theaters
Invading China
A puppet state on the way

Staking a claim to the sea
A race for the superioty
Two fleets engage
Offering an flying assault

Kamikaze squadrons
Soldiers willing to sacrifice

To the bitter end, for the greater cause

Truculent crusaders
Gruesome jungle affrays
No surrender in sight
The enemy is too weak

To the bitter end, for the greater cause
Old traditions will not ever expire
Once designed for domination
After all the sun will always ascend
The rising sun
