Mounting an offensive
The target's acquired
Merchants of destruction
Everything will be burnt

The target is acquired
And everything will be burnt

Offering no mercy
Calculations are done
No plans of turning back
The howitzers howl endlessly

Immensive power
Cracking the ground
All guns blazing,
Taste the artillery barrage

Victims of surprise attack
Of concentrated force
Aiming for domination
Striking the ground

Hear the sounds, which are
Pounding in the air 
As shockwaves rattle
Feel the artillery barrage

The voice of thunder, 
On the receiving end
Mixed with fear
Thick smoke, shells away

Explosions offer no mercy
Destructive force
Shockwaves pound the ground
Striking with no remorse

Immensive power
Cracking the ground
All guns blazing,
Endure the sound
No remorse for the victims
Victims of the artillery barrage
