Cold calculations
With plans to bleed the French army white
Forcing to a defensive stance
Launch the indelible insanity

War of attrition
Colossal borbarment strike will begin
Erich von Falkenhayn
The architecht of it all

Solid preperations on the German side
Vast amounts of weaponry and equipment
Artillery in form
Naval guns, thousands of cannons - big berthas in use
Howitzers lined up, millions of shells in store
Railways built before, everything geared up
For the first nine hours of immensive fire

Starting it like never witnessed before
Expecting to move at a rapid rate

Harsh, muddy soil 
Shelled to shambles
Unexpected resistance
The French are defending it at all costs

Capturing Fort Douaumont
"Without a shot"
Closing the village
In heavy snowfall
"They shall not pass"
Supplying through the sacred way
Arriving to the meat grinder
Into the hell of Verdun
To the hell Of Verdun

Initial plans of this operation Gericht
Not so fulfilled, resulting in a mess
Trying to reach all the forts, strongpoints of Verdun
The resistance was strong, losses turn out to be high

Poison gasses spread over, 
Flamethrowers annihilate
Going over the top
The rats are eating the rotting corpses
The stench of death is overbearing
Soldiers exhausted, grinded to the muddy soil
The stench of death is overbearing

French finally succeed at repelling
Pushing those Prussian scums back
They're now struggling for Le Mort-Homme
Battling over hill 304

War of attrition
Desperation, on village Fleaury
Eventually charging for fort Souville
Catastrophic bloodshed
Resulting in useless battle
Mincing machine of Verdun
Determination to hold ground
At any cost, misfortune for one
Misfortune for one

Started it like never seen before, then
Slaughtered witlessly in this great abattoir
Laying in their muddy graves
