Strangulation
The helpless feeling
Activates the instincts of fear
Ever increasing suspension
The awareness of death
Growing agony
Enduring asphyxication
Setting up the last prayers
Craving the torture to stop

The tension of the muscles
Begings to fade rapidly
In this desperate state
You're gasping for the final air
The last, the closing breath
Time begings to twist like hell
A second feels like infinity
Retribution's waiting there

Finally heart stops beating
Sweat pouring down the forehead 
Sickening memories flash in front of your eyes
Thy final fate
Nothing left behind
You've killed them all
Deserved was your mortal share
Impending doom
