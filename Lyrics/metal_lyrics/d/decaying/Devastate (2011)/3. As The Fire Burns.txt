Comprehensive plannings
Preparing the assault
Contrived divisions, strike!
Purposes merged as one
(Purposes merged as one, one)

Setting the stage
Seeing to ammunition
Commencing an attack
The waves of "justice" will sweep

Securing resources
Over the landscapes
Government fundings
Rolling treads crush the sand
(As the rolling treads crush the sand)

"Preserving the peace"
Start of war
Over manufactured excuses
Devastation
As fire burns

Devastation, On dead soil
As the fire burns

The ongoing operations
Ripping their soil apart
"Advancing forward"
Always searching something to gain

Facing guerilla warfare
Focusing howitzer fire
Prosperity lacking
Failure to come, soon to come

Prosperity lacking
On dead soil

"Secure the peace"
Start the war
Over manufactured excuses
"Preserve the peace"
As fire burns

As the fire burns, the fire will burn
"Securing the peace"
