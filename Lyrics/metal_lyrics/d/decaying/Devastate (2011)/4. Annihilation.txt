[PART I:]

Cannons roaring
With a forceful sound
Flames blazing
All across the ground

Moving armies
From east to west
Strategic bommings
Never put to rest

Blasting howls
With resolution
As they march
Can you feel?

Immense campaings
Aided by led
Termination
To the bitter end

From the starboard side
Closing torpedoes
Blackened cloud arises
Sunken in the chilling sea

In the cockpit
Meeting resistance
A fiery ball of flame
Down to the certain death
"Now you're free"

(Now you're free
Down to the certain death)

[PART II:]

Now as they say those things that mean nothing
Empty promises, propaganda machine handles it in all
Facing mortality, but loyality covers it in whole
It's the soldier's duty, blindly to follow

Down in the depths
Fear for their lives
Deep in the pits of no return
(Deep in the pits of no return)
The battle lives on

Closing armor
As tanks roll
Missiles flying
The countdown is on
(Missiles flying, the countdown is on)
Securing the existance

Airborne
Jets fly (to die)
Formation leads to damnation
(In formation leading to damnation)
Preparing to crush

Battalions advance
Under the command

[PART III:]

"The bombing runs started 4AM, and they caught us by suprise
Then the flames surrounded us like inferno, and all hell broke loose
Filled with misery and hatred, we watched as our homes began to burn down
This shouldn't be the way it ends, we had to promise to ourselves to keep being sane
The planes soared high as the second enemy raid approached us
This time we would be prepared to fight, and then we aligned to strike back"

"So close to being killed, without any regret
Remorse is for the weak"

Cannons roaring
Missiles fly
No fear of death, to terminate
Moving armies
Aided by lead
Preparing to crush
Offensive to the end, end
