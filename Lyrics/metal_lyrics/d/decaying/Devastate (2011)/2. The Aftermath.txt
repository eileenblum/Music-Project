Screams of despair
Echoing beyond
The piles and mass graves
Of fallen men
Weeping in silence
Above the smoldering ruins
The unforseen terror
Withering defeat

The search for power
Endless wrangle
Never peace
A twisted illusion
Servants of war
Structured to death
Only in figures
Carrying out orders

Mobilizing masses
Against who oppose us
Blindly they follow
No matter what the price is
The remnants of joy
Now swept away with force
Tools of destruction
World covered in flames

"Never again shall this heinousness happen"
These words were told after the war
No matter the assertings, the conflicts shall occur
The greed of human nature
The feebleness, wars shall go on
