Lust for power
Beneath the core of lies aiming for the kill
Through corruption and disorder
Seeking the path for the cause of annihilation

Lord of pestilence
Falsification of common belief and mistrust
Spreading morbid lies upon you
Proclaiming to offer peace and freedom

Expelling the regions
Of unified opposition to the cause
The profecies ordered to be told
Witness the propaganda and new rules

The flames will burn high
Above you, destruction holds the key to eternity
Perish and suffer
Controversies solved only by war

We will writhe

Brainwashed to obey 
The so-called higher form
Shattering in pyres of our downfall
We're set to decay
