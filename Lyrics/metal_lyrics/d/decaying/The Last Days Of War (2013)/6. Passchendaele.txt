Finding the way through barbed wire
Only mud and death remain on these desolate plains
Shelled is the groundscape, filled with water and blood
No trees or plants left alive, madness and sorrow to offer

It raises questions, about the usefullesness of Passchendaele
Strategy which was bound to fail on these autumn rains
The third battle of Ypres

Setting positions on these unclear trench networks
Four million shells of artillery have modified the scenes we see
The enemy charges, bodies fill the ground
The ultimate goal has been set to break the Hindenburg line
End the  war once and for all

It raises questions, about the usefullesness of Passchendaele
Strategy which was bound to fail on these autumn rains
The third battle of Ypres

Gazing behind as the front row now falls to this endless fire
Hoping a breakthrough will come after all, maybe one day
Battle after another they fought, still no ending in sight
Desperate grasp for honour, death and sorrow, nothing more

It raises questions, about the usefullesness of Passchendaele
Strategy which was bound to fail on these autumn rains
The third battle of Ypres
