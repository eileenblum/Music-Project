Taking over the charge of the 15th Panzer Division
Fighting over Libya with Afrika Korps
To assist the demoralised Italian troops
The siege of Tobruk goes soon wrong
But the thrust concentrates on Gazala
The outcome brings an havoc to the British armour
Rommel crowned as the Desert Fox
The allied forces not all-out defeated
They're still firmly in the game

Advancing toward the sands of El Alamein
The steady thrive for Egypt

Bringing in Bernand Montgomery
To ease this expanding pain
Now the British army prevails at Alam Halfa
Forcing the Fox to think again
The second battle of El Alamein commences
Ultimately bringing the Axis to defeat

Orders from Hitler not to back down
But this is lost, Germans on the run

Sealing the North African theatre
The oil fields are now lost
They are lost
