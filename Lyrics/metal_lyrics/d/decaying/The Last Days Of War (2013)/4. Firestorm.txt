Preparing for the lift off
To hit the target yesterday still unknown
A city besieged
Planes fill the night sky above
With a deadly payload
Tons of high explosives aboard
Incendaries of various kinds
All this to give the devastating blow

Approaching the target
As air raid warnings wail below
The hatch doors open
Bombs begin whirling
Factories, civilian buildings are hit
We are part of the war effort
No mercy will be given
Hear the orders, level it all down
Burn everything, melt the steel
A wall of fire, deadly shockwaves
Pressure that evaporates the bone

Looming flames over the horizon
We return to refuel
Another mission waiting ahead

We are part of the war effort
Hear the orders, level it all down
No mercy will be given
Burn everything, melt the steel

The city is in ruins
B-17s had caused the devastation
Charred bodies everywhere
Oxygen ran out, engulfed, burnt to cinders
Inside the firestorm

Sought salvation in the air raid shelter
The homes demolished, all the sanctuaries were gone
Scorched the earth below with a terrible practice
An deadly aftermath, awoke unease
It burns like hellfire
Inside this firestorm
