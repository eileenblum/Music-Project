The scenes of the last army destroyed
Struggling there to meet the bitter end
Those who remained loyal are being pushed aside
Filled with bullets and scrapped away
Useless for the new rule

Weeping here in despair
Wandering amongst perdition

Millions after another had lost their lives
Bodies piled up unless already burnt
After many fierce campaings they had fought
Turned to be a failure in seeking the upper hand

Behold the sight 
Of the last days of war

The smell of past, evergoing anguish
Tormented ambiance reeks
Fear is felt in the very air
In those who are fortunate to breath 

Deep inside this concrete hideout
Gazing upon this doom one has wrought
All the events turn into fierce reality
The amount of suffering, there is no equal

Weeping here in despair
Wandering amongst perdition

The choice of taking poison
Or just a shot in the head
Between considering to live the day
Regardless trapped within this bloody mess
