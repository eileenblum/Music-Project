Proceeding in the line
Soon the battle ignites
Transport ships advance
Objectives are set
Carefully trained plan
To storm the beach
Break the fortified defenses
Expecting no defeat

Aiming for a total victory
Crush the opposition
With over one million troops deployed
It is the Code Name Overlord

Breach the atlantic wall
On the sixth day of June
Operation Fortitude used as deception
Overwhelming manpower
Storming the Omaha Beach
Thousands of ships in line
Coastal fight like never before

Aiming for a total victory
Crush the opposition
With over one million troops deployed
It is the Code Name Overlord

Rommel knew it would happen
Invasion that will open up the western front
Leading into a certain German defeat
Capturing Paris, taking back France
Closing on the German border
A race to Berlin to end the war
Which engulfed Europe in flames
Now time has come to retaliate

First phase successful
Enemy in retreat
With overwhelming resources
Strike force to be reckoned with
Building the pressure up
Withstanding the two front war
A task hard to fulfill
The conflict will be soon brought to an end

Aiming for a total victory
Crush the opposition
With over one million troops deployed
It is the Code Name Overlord
