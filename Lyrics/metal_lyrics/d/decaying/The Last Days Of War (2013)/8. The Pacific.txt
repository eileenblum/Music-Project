The Combined Fleet now destroyed
Torn to bits
After the Battle Of Leyte Gulf
Heavy casualties
The Imperial Navy is no more
Once ruler of the sea
All the power is now gone

Once occupied were the islands in the Philippines
US forces grab them all
The general staff is left hopelessly to watch
All the former glory with force taken away

Fighting for a piece land on Iwo Jima
Mount Suribachi offers an element of surprise
The thirtyfive day struggle for the ultimate goal
Japanese fought on, down to their bitter end

Inflicting huge damage, thousands take hit
Bodies beyond numbering, the fierce loyality binds

The typhon of steel commencing, a smell of rotting flesh
The back bone of aerial bombardment
Okinawa turns into a gory mess

Mass suicides among the population
Banzai charges with a battle cry

The last resort, using kamikaze strikes
This new tactic put on use in which bushido strickly binds
During the war Midway marked a turning point
But now the burden of invading the mainland, nothing obliges

Ryuichi Tamura - Withered Leaves:

"and
they died without even shedding green
blood

before they return to the soil
they change to the color of soil
the color of
the silence that has died one death

why does everything
seem transparent even though we walked endlessly
through the border of day and night
through the withered leaves

a man
whose star is fixed
does not turn back"
