Following the second war
Countries lay in ruins
World order is shaping up
The old agreements 
Prove to be unsustainable
Mutual distrust is deepening
Between war-time allies
Nothing is eternal
Adhering on one's interests
Step by step 
The contacts shift to silence

Their future is truly entwined
The balance of power
Stays firmly in question
Who'd commence the first strike?
The attacks would surely rebound
Missile sites scattered along the frontiers
On the borders, troops stay on high alert
Nothing to be left off
Readiness to be retained on maximum

The theory of equal parties
A balance to hold the peace
Not willing to ignite the state
Always having the full readiness
The division in central Europe
Provides a solid ground
To answer the provocations
Tactical weapons will stay on hold
