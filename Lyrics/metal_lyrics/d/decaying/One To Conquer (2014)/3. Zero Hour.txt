Ready for the engagement
Remove the camouflage
With superior numbers
Armored brigades maneuver

Regain lost territory back
At the Golan Heights
Seven to one
With Soviet steel
Charging at the high grounds
Surprise the Israeli
During The Day of Atonement
Two fronts open with Egypt
The Syrian army stands tall

Appearing out of the blue
Shells tremble the ground
Fighter jets, artillery pieces
Open the fire
Tanks aligned in the distance
Starting the action 
At the Zero Hour

After the first shock
The night time falls
Without the proper gear
Still holding the line
Against overwhelming force
Reserves to be mobilized
Israeli tankers up the ante
No compromise

The reserve troops arrive
Straight into the battle
A baptism of fire
Inferno at the Golan Heights
Starting the action 
At the Zero Hour

With growing numbers
The help of jets and artillery
Push back the aggressor Secure the grounds

Great amounts of bravery 
Shown on the both sides
Many days of constant battle

The heavy losses 
At the Valley of Tears
Shifting focus out of the heights
Heading toward Damascus

Soviet threat of intervention
Situation is out of control
Imminent call for a cease fire
With the help from abroad
No holds barred
Inferno at the Golan Heights
Arab forces capitulate
Heavy casualties on both sides
At the Zero Hour
