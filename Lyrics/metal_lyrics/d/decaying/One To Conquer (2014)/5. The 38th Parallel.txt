A country divided between the two powers
Line is drawn across the 38th parallel
Ousted the former Japanese rule
Two governments built
Modeled after their own views

The result soon turns becomes unstable
Two-pronged attack shows its true nature
Only one side would exist on this land
Both gearing up to wage a war
Capture the full command

A quick charge over the DMZ
UN forces answer at Inchon and Pusan
China joins the fight to assist the North
The Korean War, a bloody battlefield

Stalemate on the front
Fighting to gain close to nothing
It all goes on and on
But when does it end?
