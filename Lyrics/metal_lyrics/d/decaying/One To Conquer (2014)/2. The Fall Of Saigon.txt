The tide is about to be turned
South is on a brink of collapse
Rapid advance toward the capital
Red flags will dominate the scenes 

It was a just warning
That war had been done
US operations on foreign soil
To halt the red disease
Cold war at its peak
Stop the communists
Interest of the west vanished
At the fall of Saigon

Hastily retreating on a large scale
The republic was caught off guard
Total fall on all fronts
Foreign aid cut to meaningless

It was a just warning
That war had been done
US operations on foreign soil
To halt the red disease
Cold war at its peak
Stop the communists
Interest of the west vanished
At the fall of Saigon

The war is over
The republic has fallen
