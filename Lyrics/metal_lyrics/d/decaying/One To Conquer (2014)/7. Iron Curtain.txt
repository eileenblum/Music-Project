The Red Army is proven relentless
Unstoppable, the triumph awaits
Annexing area with this solid war machine
Mowing down the opponent
Taking hold on things that rightly belong

Let the Iron Curtain fall
Across the half of the continent
Welcome the liberators
The justification is victory

Enemies of the regime are ought to disappear
Beria and Molotov will play their roles
The prominent expansion of the idea of communism
These great plans are soon to be fulfilled

Arranging staged elections
Greatly expanding Stalin's rule
Gearing up the propaganda 
Around the puppet states of the Eastern Bloc

Let the Iron Curtain now fall
Across the half of the continent
Welcome the liberators
These tensions will lead to Cold War

With the newly addition of China
Red states begin to spread in the east
Aggressive stance toward capitalism

Building up the police force
Subjecting the people to a constant fear
Collectivization of the economy
The goal is, indeed, toward prosperity

Let the Iron Curtain fall
Across the half of the continent
Welcome the liberators
Because the justification is victory

The western countries are now threatened
Soviet political power is truly unleashed
The outcome of Stalin's reign of terror
Would determine the future's geopolitical events
