Along the lines of southern Laos
NVA, focused on guerilla warfare
With countless tons of ammunition 
Thrown straight into combat

Moving vehicles and manpower
This supply route reigns supreme
Fueled by something worth fighting for
A solid way to avoid a plain defeat

Determined to strike it down
But the trail is always shifting
Maintenance during the day and night
Tireless work force is unleashed

Carpet bombing on a daily basis
B-52s sweep the sky
The US air force, throttle set on full
Fulfilling a task which seems pointless

The origins are from a previous struggle
Baptized in battle 
During the First Indochina War

First-rate engineering by VC
The group 559 assigned
Perfected all the concealment
Paved roads and vast bunker networks

"Build roads to advance, fight the enemy to travel"

Soviet supplies are in a firm use
Anti-aircraft defenses set up to the task
While the South Vietnamese morale collapses
The trail is steadily upgraded

The public opinion in the States is in turmoil
And the vague truce is shattered
After the Tet Offensive
Westmoreland's army starts losing the hold
Cannot maintain warfare with the lack of funds

The tide had changed
Keep up the pressure and continue on building up
Pushing forward to end the conflict
It is time to force Saigon down to its knees

Moving vehicles and manpower
A solid way to avoid a plain defeat

With countless tons of ammunition 
Thrown straight into combat
Carpet bombing on a daily basis
On the Ho Chi Minh Trail
