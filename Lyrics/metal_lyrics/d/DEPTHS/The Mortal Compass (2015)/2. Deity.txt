You bring new meaning to ignorance
Convictions of a child and deceit of man
Coiling downward into your darkest fear
Too blind to see truth, to deaf to hear reason
An arrogant display of substance abuse
Wired comprehension from an artificial truth

We look so insignificant
Standing on your pedestal
Wearing a mask of dignity
While inside it eats you alive

You think we don't hear the whispers
Or does it mean that little to you
Years of favor left to the ashes
Revel new found wisdom alone
You think we don't hear the whispers
Or does it mean that little to you

A construct of fantasy and fiction
Save your judgement, we're all sinners here
Tired excuses and a obstinate mind

We're all sinners here

The hallowed one has come
And the foolish will burn in the sun
