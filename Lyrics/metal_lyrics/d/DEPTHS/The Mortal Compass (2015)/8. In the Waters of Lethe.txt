So few years and so many faces
What happened to the old days?
All the memories of the past cast aside and forgotten

Nothing has changed but the people around me
Disappearing into obscurity
Momentum taking hold of everything
Then you lost what you had

Your passion is now a fleeting thought, a faded illusion of sanity
Becoming the incarnation of animosity
Who the fuck have you become?

In another time, in another place
We will reclaim what once was there
As for now the void will swallow us whole

So few years and so many faces
What happened to the old days?
All the memories of the past cast aside and forgotten
