Shape the minds of the young and the free
Break them into conforming
Numb the will from their consciousness
Expression conforms to compliance
We forgot our dreams, now we're living the nightmare

Generations of mindless machines
Raised in a world that never wants you to think
Follow the mold of the one that came before
They tell you what to think
Tell you what to feel, and who to be

We are slaves to our distortion of life
Walking the lines of society's expectancy
Brainwashed into an infinite crisis
Mass genocide of universal knowledge

Break the sequence
And mend the rupture
Become the embodiment of forever

If everything we are is everything we will be
Why bother to carry on?
Revert the fiber of every being
Wasting every breath we receive
Break the sequence
And mend the rupture
Become the embodiment of forever
