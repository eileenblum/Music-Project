So many lines have been clouded
Losing comprehension of right and wrong
To see heroes become oppressors
Security comes at a fatal cost

They have abandoned us all
Leaving any last chance of promise
The chosen savior has forsaken mankind

We've become the villain
We've become the perversion
In this place hope is a fantasy

A colossal return of virtue
But who chooses the road we take?
One self appointed emancipator
Control flowing blue and red
When the end is near
We have no faith in one another
To save us from our transgressions
We all pray till kingdom come

Our dream is dead
Replaced with fear instead
In the end we're just fading away
Waiting in hope for another day

When the end is near
We have no faith in one another
To save us from our transgressions
We all pray till kingdom come
