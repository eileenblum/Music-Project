Bow to the eternal pain

The mortal compass on which we adhere
Living our lives searching
Yearning to hear the voices
Seeking that which we will not find

I thought I had it all worked out
Seeing the vale of mystic presence
Believing what was spoken to me
But I never heard a god damn thing

We're all sinking, but we're not dead yet
Realize we have the influence

Break down the barriers to reveal true animation
We are the conquerors of fate
The endless unknowing

Bow to the eternal pain
The endless unknowing
A drop in an infinite ocean
To questions that will never be answered
The insignificant truth
