The gears of war keep turning
As modest blood fuels the machine
The beast of greed take hold
Ever churning for the fortune

Senseless pieces in a aimless endeavor
Who succeeds in the games they play
Vile intent composed with suffering
Living the prophecy
We have been losing an endless battle, fighting our flesh and blood
The foolish pride of narcissistic minds

These maggots feeding on the lower man
Nursing the motives of a sickening plan
They eat the riches, we eat the fucking infection

Materialistic theories of a lethargic collection
Assembling their throne of gluttony and filth
If this it and the world is at is seems
What will be left for those we leave?
The history will speak in magnitudes of our demise

This is the mutiny
Ignite the revolution
