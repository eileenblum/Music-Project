All these people staring blind into deceit
The liars at the door, and a demon where you sleep
Raping the mind of the population
Peel the parasite from your eye

Castrating those who don't care to listen
Then they'll never have to speak a word
These flawed fallacies of existence
Lobotomize the mindless cattle of man

Eliminating intelligence through influence
Our being is rotting with deception
Sew their mouths shut, so they can't say a thing
Expose the cloak of supremacy
The power of a corrupt reign
The power of a corrupt reign

Believe everything
And never ever question anything
Control of reality
Then weâll never see the truth

Don't heed to the perjurer
Emancipate actuality within
Cut off your ears, gauge your eyes
Reveal the secret of a concealed authority

Sew their mouths shut, so they can't say a thing
Expose the cloak of supremacy
The power of a corrupt reign

Nothing is real
Nothing is absolute
