Remember my name

This disease eats at me from the inside
A pathetic hero of my meaningless existence
Life is an extended void of opportunity

I was a good man, now I'm the one they fear
Blood is thick, but control is forever
My conscience slowly wearing thin
Shedding the virtues of yesterday

The mind of a savage is a corrupt nothingness
Once free I am now it's prisoner
Embrace what we all will become
I am the one who knocks
I am the fucking monster

This is my empire, this is my legacy
I will be the end of everything
All hail the new king

They say my time has come, but I've only just begun
My kingdom of blood and gold, they'll never forget
The hero has fallen
Everyone I love will suffer at these hands

This is my empire
