From nothing to a spark
The futures seed is planted
Yet you're rotting from within
A disease of desire and greed

Created so pure, infected with filth
The fiber of purity burns no more
Strains of immeasurable failure
The few who stain our failed integrity

The precipice of existence
Open your eyes to the force of origin
Darkness bringing forth light
And the light brings shadows
Their minds are naive, but their souls are corrupt
You had potential, you had purpose
Now you have nothing but a mouth of ashes

This fucking world is eating you alive
