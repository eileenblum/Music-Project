This, the land of captivity
Nothing but puppets to corrupt intent
No care for the mortals, no remorse for consequence

Distraction is a weapon
And rule the design
The blood that spills decay
While wealth for few

The time to dethrone is at hand
Stand to be something of worth
If we're living blind, then we're not living at all

They murder for progress
Over indulgent worthless parasite
Reckoning upon the judged

Reality is never definite
Alter the blueprint of purity
Perfection is a distorted invention
The delusion of safety
