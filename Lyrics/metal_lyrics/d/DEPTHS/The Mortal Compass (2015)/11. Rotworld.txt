The balance is torn
We've been dying for so long
Eating the shit that they feed us
Birthing decay, nurturing disease
The earth is weeping, as we cut the flesh
Three entities at war
Shifting the symmetry
Restore the equilibrium

Wait, can you hear the screams calling?
Whispers in your ear calling out
They can hear your purpose, and they smell your fear

Tell me, what have we left for those to come?
Why don't you heed the warnings?
Will you stand in the coming bloodshed?
Weâre all just rotting flesh

Go forth to the scarlet kingdom
Feel the embrace of the essence of flesh
As the parliament chooses their fate
We return to the swamp from where we came
