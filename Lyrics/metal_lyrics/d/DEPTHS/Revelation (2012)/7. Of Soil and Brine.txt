Arise the malevolent mercenary
Crowned beast of darkness
The void opens it's mouth
And trembles at his knees

Spit forth the words of deception
The transgressors will burn
Soil will give birth to the betrayer
The transgressors will burn

We will be stained with horror
Scared with the blasphemy
Drowning in the dread
He yields to the Antichrist

Of soil and brine they awaken
To condemn the remaining ones
They are the rotting endeavor
Scared with the unholy mark

Arbitrators of decay
The void opens it's mouth
Cast to the reign of fire
There is no hope for the rejected

Of soil and brine they awaken
To condemn the remaining ones
