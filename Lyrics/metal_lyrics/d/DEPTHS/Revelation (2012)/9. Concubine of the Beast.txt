She is the one who will be left in ruin
Mounted on a horned beast of swine
Named godless prostitute of Babylon
Holding a cup of infidelity and smut
Drunk on the blood of the saints
Polluted by the life of martyrs
Impaled on the ten horns of kings
The fallen monarchs yet to come

Damned will gorge on her flesh
Consumed by the flames of detest
The great city will fall
Over the leaders of the world

The plagued empire will die
Mother of whores and the disgrace of man
The beast will devastate
Behold the destroyer of morality

They will be absent in her decay
Embraced by repulsive dominance
She is the slut harlot of the earth
Cleansing in the shit of us all
Intoxicated on the holy ones
Chocking on creation of the pure
And pierced by the spine of man
Departed rulers to come

Flesh of which she claims to be
The plagued empire will die
The chosen will destroy us all
The plagued empire will die
