The beast lingers to consume
Mans expectancy of tomorrow
He stands as a patient slayer

His heads enthroned with hate
The sky is torn with the tail of a god
Remaining to devour the bloodline
The wretch waits to devour the bloodline

She cries with the pain of genesis
Secure in the hands of the immortal
The descendant who is prophesied
The origin of design

He stands at the shore of the main
Cast down by the saints of eternity
Waiting for the servants of ruin
Waiting for the servants of ruin

Annihilation of all isolation
The demise of all liberation

Descendants of the chosen ones
The consumption of creation
The savage waits to devour
As a tolerant slaughterer
The consumption of creation
