We are nothing but the grain of time
Spilling what is left of our souls into the morbid abyss
We are waiting for a reign to come
And wash the salt and grime from our infected wombs

Ages are decomposing as they abandon hope
We have lost the will to survive
We have lost the desire to exist

When the dead rise
Will they be my keeper as I walk on this broken path
A disconnected isolation
Will they save our fallen hearts

The scolding flesh betrays the mark of gods
And let it manifest what is left of our souls
We are the remaining ones
Open our eyes to the truth that is imminent

I'm waiting for the cold retreat
When our voices are lost in the decay of history
Hold my hand and be engulfed once more
For we are the disciples of a broken world

The one thing I crave is the one thing I fear
These shadows are coming where I fear to tread
Damned and forsaken, there's no sign of home
There's no one to save you, they're all dead and gone

I'm praying for absolution
I'm begging for deliverance
