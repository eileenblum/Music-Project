The numbered chalice of filth
Drown the earth in abomination
The oceans will writhe in agony
As we feed on our flesh

Apparitions of malevolence
Summoning the monarch's of man
Congregate in Armageddon
The day of judgement is near

The ground will tremble in fear
And the sun will bleed

The population will curse divinity
As they bathe in suffering
Humanity has fallen to the vile
As they damn the blessed

Disgust upon existence
We cry, as we are mutilated
By every torment we ever felt
There is no way out, there is no way home

Existence is finished
Death is imminent
