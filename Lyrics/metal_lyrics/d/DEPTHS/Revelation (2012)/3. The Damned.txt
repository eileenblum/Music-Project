The ordained corpse of the lamb
Seven eyes of dynasty
Divinity will fall to it's knees
As the proclamation collected
The conqueror mounted on pale death
There is no safe place, no refuge
So the seals are broken
We will annihilate humanity

Retribution of the blood of martyrs
The sun turns black and the moon it bleeds
This is the plague we receive
This is the curse we deserve
Servants of the ascendancy

Wrath will pour upon the earth
Tormented corpse of the damned
And so the seals are broken
There is no hope for mortality

In the end there is nowhere to hide
We will annihilate humanity
