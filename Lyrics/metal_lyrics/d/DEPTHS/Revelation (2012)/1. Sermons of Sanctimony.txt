I have seen the maniacal depravity
Witness to the shameful indifference
A honored denomination, the praised cult
Established upon the fabrication of history

Faithless leading the blind
Their souls blackened with the wealth of the lost
Wolves in the masks of lambs
An ignorant audience of the damned

The sermons of sanctimony
Deception concealed in misconstruction
The rituals of hypocrisy
Arise the disgusting endeavor

Morality is such a fragile desire
Fracturing the substance of existence
They are the deceivers
We are the hopeless ones

We are the hopeless ones
