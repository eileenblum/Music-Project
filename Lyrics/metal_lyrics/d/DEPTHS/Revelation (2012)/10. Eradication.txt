They weep and mourn over ruination
Sultans of the damned and unfaithful
Existing in contamination of reality
Lords of the cursed and the traitorous

"Fallen is Babylon the great
She has become a home for fiends
And the hold for every corrupt mind
A cage for every venomous man

For all kingdoms drunk of the wrath
She'll be devoured in flames"
The great city has fallen

The world cries for death
But nobody's listening

Stand and wail over extermination
Rulers of the condemned and faithless
Writhing in the filth of the world
They are masters of the cursed

The great city has fallen
The director of eradication
