As the sky turns red
Combustion over populace
The masses will fall, we all will fall
Prominence spews destruction
We all will drown in blood

The seals are opened
And they stand with ascendancy
They are the seven executioners
The infinite terror approaches

The great star is falling
There is no end to abyss
Slaughter those without inclination
The plagues are released

And with the head of a beast
Spitting devastation
With the body of mules
The infinite terror approaches

Conquest reigns down concealed in white
Your false prophet and redeemer
With a fiery mane of bloodshed
Wielding the blade of war
The black plague will devastate
Holding the scales of famine and fate
Do you feel the reaper?

We will drown in blood
