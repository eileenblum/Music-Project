This is a barren wasteland
This is isolation
I am a prisoner of silence
The secret you hide

We are cold, and we are alone
Choking on the default of humanity
We are cold, and we are alone
Drown in the mortal abyss

Blood runs black
They show me an endless reason
I warn of the path they tread
A calm death of traitors

Like the whore of Babylon
It is an empty beauty
Like the depths of darkness
It is an empty beauty

The wounds may heal, but you cannot hide
They show you an endless reason
You were warned
I am the answer to your fucking debt

Come and cleanse in the depths of nothing
