Their tongues drip with deception
Breeding in hypocrisy
This is the birth of the end
This is the death of your god

The overgrown majority to an unseen minority
Call it what it is, not what you wish it was
The realization that we're all the same
Call it what it is, what you know it is

They live like the vile
Loathing in swine
This is the nightmare
This is your fucking hope

Let judgement be born
Laid down to the hands of waste

This is the age of compromise
