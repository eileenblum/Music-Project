We watch and avoid while we separate,
From our conscious minds
The judgement of our transgressors and crimes
This will be the end of our sincerity to solidarity
We are the ones that we are hiding from

Close your eyes to an imploding universe
Dream to be taken away from this world of the cursed
Close your eyes into forever

You damn these roads that you no longer desire
Barricading the defect of humanity

She sways from side to side
Moving from room to room
She won't wake up, she can't wake up

Give in to slumber, give in to the unreal
For it's better to smile in a fantasy
Than to lie with the bones in your closet

Close your eyes, you won't miss a thing
Close your eyes into forever
