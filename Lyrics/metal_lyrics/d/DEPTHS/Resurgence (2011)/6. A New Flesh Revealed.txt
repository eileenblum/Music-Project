This man is dead
He's lost and not coming back
Can't find what he was looking for
A new flesh revealed
Though senses deceive
This is not the man who stood

Hardened and cold
From the fire and scold
This soul is getting old,
It's getting much too old

And as they look down upon
"It's time to grow up son"
Only is it in death revealed
The end is upon us

So he'll wait
For vindication, for conviction
For a reason
The end is upon us

Standing at the edge of the world
Thinking back on my life and those who knew me
I vow to take what's mine,
And to kill those of you keeping me alive
This is my mindset changing
I feel it deep inside
Nowhere to run and hide,
This is my new flesh revealed
