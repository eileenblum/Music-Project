Closed doors in my minds depravity
White walls in my minds insanity
I hate what I've become
Who have I become?

I am the moulded disease
Worshiping a fetus of broken dreams
I am everything they say I am

Heartless, soulless, worthless
You've been deprived, but I've been dead
This is the illusion of sanity

I look inside and the spirit is lost
The days of the old are gone, buried underneath
This is coursing through my veins, changing everyday
Fate is lost on me

Hollowed eyes speak the story of one
Who was left behind under a blackened sun
We pray with deafened ears
Our faith soaks in fucking tears

Now we rot in the jealous stench
The decay of human thought and culture
We are everything they say we are
