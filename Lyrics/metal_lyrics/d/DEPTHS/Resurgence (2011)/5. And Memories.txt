I can't breathe, I can't speak
I can't forget, oh god I can't
All these memories are passing in my head
All I want is not wanting
All I want I can't forget
They're haunting me

You lead me through the darkest times
Now I cannot see a thing
The sky descending down
I see the truth exposed
My eyes are opened for the first time
You dragged me down to fill your need
Fingers clawing at desperation
Your world is coming down
To an impending end
The demise is at hand

You dragged me down to leave me wanting

You spineless scum
Feeding on the excrement of my dead flesh
Your desire is oblivion

Take heed
The nonexistence of humanity
Is the very thing to kill us all

These times are changing, you cannot last
All of these feelings left in the past
Your time of reign is ending
Return to the trench from which you came
This sense of a failure is all but the same
Your reign is termination
