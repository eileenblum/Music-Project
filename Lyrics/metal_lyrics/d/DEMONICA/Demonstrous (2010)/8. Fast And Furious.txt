Moving forward nothing to stop me
I thrash my self so incredibly
The harder it's done the more it's a pleasure
To haunt a prey and lose some pressure
Break through time and find eternity
Is a dream so real but impossibly
I'm right in the middle of nowhere
And I'll take what I can get... Yeah

My desires are totally uncontrolled
I do deeds that has never been done
I please a nun and as we play for fun
She tells me things that has never been told

Long legs soft round shapes
She makes me rage as long as it takes
And before my knees she's in my hands
As if a devil controlled the race

Define total orgasm
Is it being drained for blood
Watch your step and take your turn
Get raped by the succubus
I get dizzy just from thinkin'
What is and never was
The beauty of your eyes
The pool of tears and lovers lost

Long legs soft round shapes
She makes me rage as long as it takes
And before my knees she's in my hands
As if a devil controlled the race

Counting the seconds one by one
In a last attempt to hold on
Time's running fast and me with it
Soon I will be gone
My sixth sense makes me curious
Forever fast and furious
I'm alive alone and left to rot
The secrets are gone all is lost and forgot...
For God.
