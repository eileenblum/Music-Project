Iâve got nothingâ to be afraid of
I can endure any hurt
I am blessed with mortality
For whatever it is worth

You canât kill me no more
Iâve been killed again and again
The life that makes me suffer
Prove it worth in the end

I canât be replaced
Iâm the prototype of unending waste
I fly on winds of random
With wisdom so innate

From a butterflyâs wings action
I got my will and sense intact
I climb the steepest mountain
And repel all attacks

Ghost Hunt
Iâll track you down into the sun
Ghost Hunt
Iâll win the war that canât be won

I chase the living dead
I hunt the greatest ghost
I hunt to be haunted
Eternally lost

I am the strongest entity
I am so much more than war
I am love eternal
You travel aeons searching for

Iâm your guide through mazes
I will never ever deceive
I have only one demand
I feed on your belief

Ghost Hunt
Iâll track you down into the sun
Ghost Hunt
Iâll win the war that canât be won

I chase the living dead
I hunt the greatest ghost
I hunt to be haunted
Eternally lost 

Red turns to blue
Wasting energy pursuing you
Blue turns to green
The most beautiful thing Iâve ever seen

Magnetism that reveal
Confused mists and broken seals
Color changing tone
To never ever finding home

Lost in your entangled trails
You flee from your past
Turn all into black
You cover your slimy tracks

Infect the next dimension
Never leave your path
There is everything to be afraid of
You canât endure the hurt

I cursed you with immortality
For all that it is worth
You can never ever be loved
Youâve been hurt too much
Your breath that makes me suffer
is forsaken trust

Ghost Hunt
Iâll track you down into the sun
Ghost Hunt
Iâll win the war that canât be won

I chase the living dead
I hunt the greatest ghost
I hunt to be haunted
Eternally lost
