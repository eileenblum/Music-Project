I am so scared - What I've become
So much despair - For much to long
I walk in circles - I crawl the floor
I can't get through - To you no more

The judge and the jury
And the prosecutor too
You falsely accuse me
For things I didn't do
I stood on trial
Never wanting to hurt you
So you just forced me
So you could get your proof

Under the horizon
I watch Orion
I am Sirius
Below zero

I think I am - More than a man
You do not care - To understand
I walk in circles - I crawl the walls
I cried for mercy - What is it for!

The continuing source
To the well of disbelief
You made me your victim
Of things just not real
I can only scream
As you push me away
Fulfill your predictions
You demand, I obey

Under the horizon
I watch Orion
I am Sirius
Below zero

I just don't know - Where you come from
Or who you are - And what I've done
I walk in circles - I crawl the floor
I need that love - for evermore

Master of my own misfortune
You put me to the test
Turn love into hate
You called on plague and pest

I am so wounded
By your demons caress
You took me to the brink
And wrote the witches pledge

"An unconscious defence mechanism
Through which an attempt is made
To reverse a psychologically unacceptable act
By doing its opposite
Usually repetitiously
In order to relieve anxiety"

...nothing can be undone!
