Alien sensation
Come creeping over me
Eternal damnation
Served before my feet
Forever my intention
To hold you off from me
Fall into temptation
And I will never get release

Gravitation hold me down
The wanting makes me sick

Belonging to the broken
Alien six
Belonging to the broken
Alien six

Warped insurgence
Speeds right through me
Damaged and depleted
How can this be real
Disturbingly unholy
The feelings that I feel
I have been alienated
And drained for energy

Manipulate me to the ground
The wanting makes me sick

Belonging to the broken
Alien six
Belonging to the broken
Alien six

Planetary g-force
Pulling me away
From all I know
I can only pray
I have lost all meaning
The meaning of life
When moon collides with earth
I will wave goodbye

To the pain and the pleasure
The wanting makes me sick

Belonging to the broken
Alien six
Belonging to the broken
Alien six
Belonging to the broken
Belonging to the broken
Alien six six six
