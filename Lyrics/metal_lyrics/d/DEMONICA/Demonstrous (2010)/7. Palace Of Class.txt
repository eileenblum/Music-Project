Environmental disorder
And no warnings heard
Money's got the power
And the victim is earth
Wealth is man's god
And Satan's spawn
He'll be buried withe he's manna
Before he meets his lord

Cloak and daggers
No one knows who they are
They live in the shadows
And bare no name at all
All the while he watches
The suffer of the world
As it bends to its knees
He's at sleep - At peace

We're living in a palace
A palace of glass
Throwing tombstones at the chapel
This will never last

Try go up against it
Get pinned down like a bug
Keep feeding on the carcass
And start to count your loss
We run on god damned fumes
It's total overkill
As they sit inside their bunkers
Counting on your will

We're living in a palace
A palace of glass
Throwing tombstones at the chapel
This will never last

Cut down by the root
Demolished from the top
Severed on the middle
Forcing blood out of rock

Co-operated finance
Strawmen of demise
They will suck it all dry
And leave us to the fire

Spinning gold on neglect
Turning man into slaves
Leave chaos to our children
With nothing left to safe
Let us sing our swan song
Let the past behind
Let's devour ourselves
Let madness... inside!

Lay the world to rest
Put the beast to sleep
Eradicate hell on earth
Set our souls free
What is all that suffers
Supposed to pretend
If there is a higher order
Let this be the end

We're living in a palace
A palace of glass
Throwing tombstones at the chapel
This will never last
