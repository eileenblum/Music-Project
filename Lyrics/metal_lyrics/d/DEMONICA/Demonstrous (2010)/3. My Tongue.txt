Itâs the epiphany
Itâs all I would ever want
A scent of eternity
And aching taunt

Sheâs the silky skin
The ultimate touch
My favorit sin
And perfect lust

The moon is laughing
The planets allign
Iâm in total control
Just not my own

As I am gently allowed
To go down
Blinking fast
She got murder in her eyes

I beg her to relax
And spread her thighs
The Moon is laughing
The planets allign
I enter the void
And float in thin air
In her divine lair

Luscious Damned
Walkinâ quicksand
Luscious Damned
Wolf like lamb

Bloody mistress
Elegant distress
Tripwired fur
Nothing but her

Luscious Damned
Enchanted like a rat
Deny me life
Just not that!

Luscious Damned
Walkinâ quicksand
Luscious Damned
Wolf like lamb

The Moon is laughing
The planets allign
Stars shine brighter
As she becomes mine

I enter the void
And float in thin air
Without a care 

I EXIT the voidâ¦
