I will never worry about when
Wonder about what to be
It's not possible for anyone to see
What becomes of us in the end

Could a process keep my soul in function
My spiritual existence remain
In a fusion of two dimensions
My soul I might regain
Absorbed by the giant masses
Turning flesh into ash
When all is lost when all is gone
Will I be summoned once

I've been terrified of the fact
That one day I will disappear
But who would want eternal life
When God is all you fear
An insect defenseless flying
Seeking hideout before it dies
Maybe one day in heaven
Again it flies

Could a process keep my soul in function
My spiritual existence remain
In a fusion of two dimensions
My soul I might regain
Absorbed by the giant masses
Turning flesh into ash
When all is lost when all is gone
Will I be summoned once

Shamans priests and medicine men
With tales of what might be
And still there is but nothing
For the blind to wait and see
Summoned

It's a certain proof of life
On it we all depend
It brings to us its destiny
Our fate to us my friend

Could a process keep my soul in function
My spiritual existence remain
In a fusion of two dimensions
My soul I might regain
Absorbed by the giant masses
Turning flesh into ash

When all is lost when all is gone
Will I be summoned once

Born with its intuition
It's going up against the wind
Blinded with holes instead of eyes
Taking turns as it decides
It really has not target
It really has no goal
It's just uptaining life
There is no other rule!
