It's the epiphany
It's all I would ever want
A scent of eternity
And aching taunt
She's the silky skin
The ultimate touch
My favorite sin
And perfect lust

The moon is laughing
The planets align

I'm in total control
Just not my own
As I am gently allowed
To go down
Blinking fast
She got murder in her eyes
I beg her to relax
And spread her thighs

The moon is laughing
The planets align
I enter the void
And float in thin air
In her divine lair

Luscious damned
Walkin' quicksand
Luscious damned
Wolf like lamb

Bloody mistress
Elegant distress
Tripwired fur
Nothing but her
Luscious damned
Enchanted like a rat
Deny me life
Just not that!

Luscious damned
Walkin' quicksand
Luscious damned
Wolf like lamb

The moon is laughing
The planets align
Stars shine brighter
As she becomes mine
I enter the void
And float in thin air
Without a care

I exit the void...
