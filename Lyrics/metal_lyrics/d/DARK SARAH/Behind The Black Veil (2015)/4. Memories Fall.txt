[feat. Manuela Kraller][Sarah:]
I should welcome yesterday and live the ache and pain away, you say
This life give me many tears, and now my dreams are full of fears
[Fate:]
Weep no more Sarah, the black veil will rise and change your sorrow to a new life!

[Sarah &amp; Fate:]
In the flames of your pain, you must walk until the rain comes.

[Fate:] Listen to me Sarah.
[Sarah:] Yes, I hear you.
[Fate:] Welcome to a different dawn!

[Sarah &amp; Fate:]
Memories fall, memories fall, memories fall, memories fall-
They will be gone!
Memories fall, memories fall, memories fall!

[Sarah:] Memories. There'll be life for me too!
[Fate:] Memories, they will finally leave you.
[Sarah &amp; Fate:] Memories fall, memories fall, memories fall!

[Dark Sarah:] I know now tears are left behind, and there's something new to find for me.
[Fate:] I see the world fades, behind your black veil.
[Dark Sarah:] Now I've conquered all the pain, this new strength running through my veins
[Fate:] I see your world fades, behind the black veil.

[Fate:] The fear leaves you Sarah.
[Dark Sarah:] Yes, but who are you?
[Dark Sarah &amp; Fate:] See how the black veil rises!

[Dark Sarah &amp; Fate:]
Memories fall, memories fall, memories fall, memories fall-
They will be gone!
Memories fall, memories fall, memories fall!

[Dark Sarah:] Memories. There'll be life for me too!
[Fate:] Memories, they will finally leave you.
[Dark Sarah &amp; Fate:] Memories fall, memories fall, memories fall!

[Dark Sarah &amp; Fate:]
See, it is true, you will find strength in you just let the memories fall
This new life will give so much more!
Memories fall! Memories fall!

[Dark Sarah:] Memories, there'll be life for me too!
[Fate:] Memories, they will finally leave you!
[Dark Sarah &amp; Fate:] Memories fall, memories fall, memories fall!
