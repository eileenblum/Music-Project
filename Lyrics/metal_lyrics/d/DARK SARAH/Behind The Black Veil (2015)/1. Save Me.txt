Look at my bleeding heart.
See the tears, you caused these scars.
Confused and lonely,
I guess I was in this only.
Why did you trick me this way
when I was planning happy days?

Tell me why you led me on,
but save me from your weeping songs.
Stronger by anger IÂ´ll make it
but tell me one thing:
What, what took you so damn long
to decide that our love was gone?
Instead you fooled me!
Save me- uuuuu- Save me -uuuuuu!

If I were you I would listen to
every word I have to say
there is no safety for you wherever you stay.
Look, look at your creation!
Now, now you`ll need pure salvation
to keep me away from you!

Save me- uuuuu- Save me -uuuuuu!
So, I fell into your snare
but what do I really care?
Save me, save me- uuuuu!

Save me- uuuuu- Save me -uuuuuu!
Now youÂ´ll pay for my heart,
revenge is much sweeter than your love.
Save me, save me- uuuuu!
