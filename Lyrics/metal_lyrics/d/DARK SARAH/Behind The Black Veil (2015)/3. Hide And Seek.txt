I need your light
I need your guidance
Something that takes away this pain
I was sincere the others were lying
So, where are you god?
Iâm going insane

I tried to be myself and you despised me
And when I was not you was still the same
Iâve got no power to disguise you
When you got me eternally in your game
When you got me eternally in your game

Maybe I was happy when my dreams were guiding me
And maybe I was sad
I think Iâm playing hide and seek
But you never find me
Never again

So maybe I was happy when my dreams were guiding me
And maybe I was sad
I think Iâm playing hide and seek
But you never find me
You never will
