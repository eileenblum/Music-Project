Sarah: âlallalllaa! Perfect night, perfect sleep, perfect morning!
I cannot wait to see how my flowers feel today.
Be a rose, be a sage, a tulip or a bluebell
Motherly joy it brings to me
To give them love and care, water and
What is this?

âThe garde once so red is now full of death
All is gone, torn apart are my dearest friends.
Maybe I wanna hurt you violently
All is gone, torn apart are my dearest friends!
Maybe Iâm gonna hurt you violently
Silently you will payâ¦
Dark sarah: â¦ you will pay for this.â

Dark sarah: âpoison ivy, thorn and broom, lily of the valley
They are now my new best friends, helping me to revenge!
Snakeroot, dollâs eyes, oleander and deadly nightshade.
Belladonna, how convenient a name for a plant of baneâ
(Evil flowers: Belladonna what a name!)

âAll my roses torn and dead, but hail my new friends,
Poisonous and spiky are they!
Look at this venomous gardenâ¦ hahahahahaha
Powerful, sneaky and quick!
Now I got itâ¦ a poison apple!â

âMaybe Iâm gonna hurt you violently!
Poison ivy, thorn and broom, lily of the valley!
Maybe Iâm gonna hurt you violently!
Snakeroot dollâs eyes, oleander
And maybe a suicide treeâ¦ hahahahah!â
(Evil flowers: Lalllallaa!)

âLallallaa, into the oven goes this pie I made with âlove and careâ.
How I always loved to cook, make you a supper.
(â¦ The poisonous pieâ¦)
This time you will be surprised but only for a while,
(â¦ Now take a biteâ¦)
Cause once you swallow a piece of this pie of poison apples
(â¦ Just swallow the biteâ¦)
I will just watch while you are squirming in your pain.
You little snake!â

âThe garden once so red, is now full of death.
Poison ivy, thorn and broom are my dearest friends.
Maybe Iâm gonna hurt you violently
Me and my deadly plants have now evil plansâ¦â
