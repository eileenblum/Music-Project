[feat. Inga Scharf &amp; Van Canto]Sarah: Hiss the evil tree, and its roots they squirm like eels
They lead me downwards to the kingdom of evil deeds
Queen of no good: Sarah, did I get it right
That you tried to fight against my might?
If this is right I will drag you down towards the night
Sarah: I surrender to the power of your evil roots!

Queen of no good: IÂ´m the queen of no good!
Together: Serpent tree,
Sarah did you know it has taken thee?
ItÂ´s the wicked leaves choir!
Evil roots, you will be entwined to their embrace
SheÂ´s the queen of no good!

Queen of no good: YouÂ´ve lost your name
In the fight against the night.
Sarah, you must know that the
Darkest water is too wide
Sarah: The queen of serpents
I have now turned my back to light,
I know my chances and IÂ´m willing to start the fight.

Together: Serpent tree,
Sarah did you know it has taken thee?
ItÂ´s the wicked leaves choir!
Evil roots, you will be entwined to their embrace.
SheÂ´s the queen of no good!
Together: Serpent tree,
Sarah did you know it has taken thee?
ItÂ´s the wicked leaves choir!
Evil roots, you will be entwined to their embrace.
SheÂ´s the queen of no good!

Queen of no good: Hiss the evil tree
And its roots they squirm like eels.
Sarah gave her soul for the power to be cold
Sarah: ItÂ´s sad but true, this is a story thatÂ´s not new.
The fairest mind that was kind has now changed too
Queen of no good: Evil roots, merciless
And cruel, they hold on to you.
Evil roots, your blood runs in them too

Sarah: Be ready for part two!
Together: Serpent tree,
Sarah did you know it has taken thee?
ItÂ´s the wicked leaves choir!
Evil roots, you will be entwined to their embrace.
SheÂ´s the queen of no good!
Together: Serpent tree,
Sarah did you know it has taken thee?
ItÂ´s the wicked leaves choir!
Evil roots, you will be entwined to their embrace.
SheÂ´s the queen of no good!
SheÂ´s the queen of no good!
