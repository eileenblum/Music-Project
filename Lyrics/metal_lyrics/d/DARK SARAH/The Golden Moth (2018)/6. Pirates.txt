[Dragon:]
Quickly now into the shadows, we should not make a sound
The village swarms with people who guard their desert town
I know there hides a vessel that can fly above the ground

[Dark Sarah:]
You think they've seen us?
[Dragon:]
No, but they will hear us if you keep on talking
[Dark Sarah:]
It is you who keeps on talking here...
[Dragon:]
Grrâ¦ you can be so annoyingâ¦

[Dark Sarah:]
Wait a while, someone's coming, you think they've seen us here?
We're thieves in the desert of gods, they're everywhere
Let's board the ship in darkness and hope that no one hears

[Dark Sarah:]
Towards the sky! We're passing by! This is not real. It is surreal!
[Dragon:]
Towards the sky this ship can fly
[Sarah:]
I did not believe
[Both:]
Sail ahead, the winds are mild, oh fly oh fly the ark just might
Take us right to where there is light, take us, the stars our guide!

[Dragon:]
This time it is not our fight...
[Dark Sarah:]
...But no longer we can hide

[Both:]
My mind's now playing tricks on me, i think we're not alone
There's an army of dead men near, their hearts are still as stone
They're searching for something to release them from their loan
[Dragon:]
It's the key... it's the key... it waits for me...

[Both:]
Sail ahead, the winds are mild, oh fly oh fly the ark just might
Take us right to where there is light, take us, the stars our guide!

[Dark Sarah:]
We're here to fight for our way!
[Both:]
For our way through the gate!
[Ghosts:]
Death to the mortal! Death to the mortal!
[Dragon:]
For all this time, i will fight, i will fight, i will fight!
[Dark Sarah:]
For all these times we all should fight
We all should fight against the lie!
[Both:]
For you I'll fight, you saved my life!
[Ghosts:]
We will fight, we will fight!
[Both:]
We'll make it right what changed our lives!
[Ghosts:]
We will fight for what is right!

[Both:]
Sail ahead, the winds are mild, oh fly oh fly the ark just might
Take us right to where there is light, take us, the stars our guide!
[Both:]
For you i'll fight, you saved my life!
[Ghosts:]
"We will fight, we will fight "
[Both:]
We'll make it right what changed our lives!
[Ghosts:]
"We will fight for what is right!"
[Both:]
Sail ahead, the winds are mild, oh fly oh fly the ark just might
Take us right to where there is light, take us, the stars our guide!
