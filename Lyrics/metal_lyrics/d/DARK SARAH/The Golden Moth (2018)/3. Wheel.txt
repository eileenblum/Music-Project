[Dark Sarah:]
The wheels are burning The world is turning
[Dragon:]
We keep on driving Despite the warnings
[Both:]
Hold on tight, this frantic ride will lead us right towards
Our fight!

Take a bow for yesterday
That led us to today
Take a bow for yesterday
And dream away!
Take a bow for yesterday
Where we were left to stray
Take a bow for yesterday!

[Both:]
The wind flirts with my hair
We speed as lightning flare
I feel fire in my blood
The stream is burning hot
The wheels are burning, steaming and howling!

Take a bow for yesterday
That led us to today
Take a bow for yesterday
And dream away!
Take a bow for yesterday
Where we were left to stray
Take a bow for yesterday!

[Dragon:]
The desert rose is back, the gods will pay back! I will
Help you with your task and all that you ask
[Dark Sarah:]
Ah!

Take a bow for yesterday
That led us to today
Take a bow for yesterday
And dream away!
Take a bow for yesterday
Where we were left to stray
Take a bow for yesterday!
Take a bow for yesterday
Where we were left to stray
Take a bow for yesterday!
