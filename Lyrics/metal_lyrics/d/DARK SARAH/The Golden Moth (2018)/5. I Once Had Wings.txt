[Dragon:]
I once had wings, and held a godly string
Among these kings, but oh how did I sin?
I fell from grace and became the one displaced
What happened next I did not expect
They punished me for my sins, burned my wings â you see the scars?
Once they had stolen my wings, I left the kings to live in the dark

[Dark Sarah:]
Let history just tell its tales
Your scars will fade
Another day will break
We all have made a few mistakes
But you have paid them back
With your heartache
Today

[Dragon:]
Lost everything just for a small fling
I had nothing, and welcomed death to bring
Bring me some guidance I got back my highness
And in the silence I moved to the world's end
I could see all the stars, all the time, 'cause it was dark
One part of me died when I couldn't fly and then I left the sky

[Both:]
Let history just tell its tales
Your scars will fade
Another day will break
We all have made a few mistakes
But you have paid them back
With your heartache

[Dragon:]
I am here... 'cause I want it all what was taken away from me
I want it all and more!
I know there's a hidden door
I've seen it once before
There lies everything that used to be
All we need is to use your key
I just can't wait to hold it once more

[Both:]
Let history just tell its tales
Your scars will fade
Another day will break
We all have made a few mistakes
But you have paid them back
With your heartache
Your scars will fade!
With your heartache!
Your scars will fade!
