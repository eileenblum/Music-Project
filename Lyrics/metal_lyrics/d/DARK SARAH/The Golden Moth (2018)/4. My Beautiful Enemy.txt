[Dark Sarah:]
Against all odds we're here
Two souls in despair
I'm going to trust in you although I may be
A fool
I'm going to trust in you,

[Both:]
Alone in this world
We're both as doomed

[Both:]
In the wilderness
Our path is beaming
There you will find me now
There, you will find me

[Dragon:]
Many years have passed
I found this place at last
I promise you now I do, I do trust in you
I promise you, believe now that it's true, our
Fates lie in the hands of us two

[Both:]
In the wilderness
Our path is beaming
There you will find me now
There, you will find me

[Both:]
My beautiful
Enemy trust in me
Endlessly until we're free
And we'll meet all the demons we seek
And who seek us

[Both:]
I want to stay awake
When the night is freezing
To know I'm not the only one
In this world, who's breathing
My beautiful enemy
Trust in me
