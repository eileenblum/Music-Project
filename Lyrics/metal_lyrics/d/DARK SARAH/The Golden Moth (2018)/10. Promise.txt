[Dark Sarah:]
You promised to help me...
[Dragon:]
I have no kindness in me
[Dark Sarah:]
But you promised, you promised...
[Dragon:]
In the end, we are all on our own
[Dark Sarah:]
And I thought the word 'promise' would at least mean something!
Watch me leave now to meet my fate, 'cause in my death there's more kindness!

[Dark Sarah:]
Promise me you'll spare a thought for me...
[Dragon:]
Promises are not made for me
[Dark Sarah:]
...when dreaming the darkest dreams you hold the key
[Dragon:]
I don't know
[Dark Sarah:]
Think of me through your eternity
I'll be the darkest star
The only star, that you can see

[Dragon:]
I watch you leave now, it's the end
[Dark Sarah:]
It was close, but here my days end
In the afterlife I'll have my vengeance
[Dragon:]
Into my world there's no entrance
[Dark Sarah:]
But you promised, you promised!
[Dragon:]
I really have no kindness!

[Dark Sarah:]
Promise me you'll spare a thought for me...
[Dragon:]
Promises are not made for me
[Dark Sarah:]
...when dreaming the darkest dreams you hold the key
[Dragon:]
I don't know
[Dark Sarah:]
Think of me through your eternity
[Dragon:]
Promises are not made for me
[Dark Sarah:]
I'll be the darkest star
The only star, that you can see

[Dark Sarah:]
I'll become a ghost in your town
That no one knows, and no one hears but you alone
I promise to haunt you wherever you go
I promise to watch you, you'll never be alone
I promise to haunt you
I promise to watch you

[Dark Sarah:]
Promise me you'll spare a thought for me...
[Dragon:]
Promises are not made for me
[Dark Sarah:]
...when dreaming the darkest dreams you hold the key
[Dragon:]
I don't know
[Dark Sarah:]
Think of me through your eternity
[Dragon:]
Promises are not made for me
[Dark Sarah:]
I'll be the darkest star
The only star, that you can see
