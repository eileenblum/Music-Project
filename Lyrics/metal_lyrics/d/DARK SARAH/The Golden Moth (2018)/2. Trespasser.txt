[Dark Sarah:]
Who are you, what do you follow me for?
You've shared my dream for years, that is real
What you've left behind I know you can't find
Leave me alone this path is my own

[Dragon:]
I come alone, I come alone in peace, my dear
But you opened the door for me to seek more
Now I've come here to find what's mine

[Dark Sarah:]
Stay...
[Dragon:]
You'll see we share the pain right here
[Dark Sarah:]
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way
[Dragon:]
I've come to guide us out from here

[Dark Sarah:]
Why you're here it is hard to see
I think what you need is something from me
[Dragon:]
But there's nowhere to run under the ardent sun
[Both:]
You need me like I need you

[Both:]
Stay...
[Both:]
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way
[Both:]
Stay...
[Both:]
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way

[Both:]
And I feel alive with you, how strange and new for me!
[Dragon:]
For years I kept inside the darkness I know too well but now
There's light!
[Dark Sarah:]
Don't you play with me......and don't you lie!

[Both:]
Stay...
[Both:]
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way
[Both:]
Stay...
[Dragon:]
You'll see we share the pain right here
[Both:]
The heat is here to stay, it burns our way
[Dragon:]
I've come to you guide us out from here
