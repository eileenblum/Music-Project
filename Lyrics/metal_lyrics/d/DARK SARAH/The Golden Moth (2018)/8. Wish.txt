[Dark Sarah:]
Look how far
We are, I can almost
Catch a star
I think they look different
When seen from a distance

[Dragon:]
Everything
Here is so familiar
It almost hurts
But do you know what is worse?
I'm stuck on this lousy ship

[Dark Sarah:]
Come here and see how high we are now!
[Dragon:]
I know, I'd rather stay where I am now
[Dark Sarah:]
Are you afraid of the heights?
[Dragon:]
I'm not
[Dark Sarah:]
You're afraid of the heights!
[Dragon:]
I'm not. You know that once I did fly!

[Dark Sarah:]
You and I will now fly
The moon shines so bright
[Both:]
From darkness we both will climb
Reach higher and higher!

[Dark Sarah:]
Look Dragon, no hands!
[Dragon:]
You're such a show off...

[Both:]
Here two castaways
That's us, drift along
The Milky Way
They're hoping that someday
All of their dreams will come true

[Dark Sarah:]
I wish, I wish upon a star that my
Heart will be found there where you are...
[Both:]
We're going to the hills
Where the dreams will be real
The gods will see we have the key!

[Both:]
You and I will now fly
The moon shines so bright
From darkness we both will climb
Reach higher and higher!

You and I may find, find
You and I, with you I'll find â finally peace of mind
