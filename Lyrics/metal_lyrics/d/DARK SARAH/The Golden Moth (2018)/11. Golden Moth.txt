[Dark Sarah:]
Hi, is it you? I have to go
I know I have to, I have to go
I felt inside me that you would leave me
I have to go

Is it you, is it you?
I'm cold, I'm cold
Is it you, is it you?
I'm cold, I'm cold

Where have you been? I've been alone
There's so much darkness, I thought you were
Gone
But here I am now with you and your mind
I thought you were gone

Is it you, oh is it you?
I'm cold, I'm cold
Is it you, oh is it you?
I'm cold, I'm cold

[Dragon:]
Like a ghost
From its host
The golden moth flies from the innermost
Where has it gone?
Towards the sun
Dropped her wings one by one!

[Dark Sarah:]
Is it you, oh is it you?
I'm cold, I'm cold
Is it you, oh is it you?
I'm cold!
