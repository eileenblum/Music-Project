[Dark Sarah:]
The pale ghosts as our hosts are gone
And the journey's begun to the sun!
We keep our thoughts in the clouds and fly
Beneath the sky we made this right!
[Dragon:]
You will find it's a new day!
And you, you will find it's a new day!

[Both:]
The clouds move fast
We are sky sailing
Our ship is flying like a storm!
Gods, look at our cast
We are sky sailing
The fury of the sky is born!

[Dark Sarah and Dragon:]
The golden dunes look unreal from here
We are sailing high to the sky!
The treasure, the city of gods is there
Above the stars and we've come from afar
You will find it's a new day!
And you will find it's a new day!

[Both:]
The clouds move fast
We are sky sailing
Our ship is flying like a storm!
Gods, look at our cast
We are sky sailing
The fury of the sky is born!

[Dragon:]
So many â of my few smiles â begin with you
You're one of a kind...
[Dark Sarah:]
...so many of my few happy days I've shared with you. I love how you're so..
[Both:]
...dark are our hearts and who knows if
We have met there somewhere some other time when we were
Different in so many ways

[Both:]
The clouds move so fast
We are sky sailing
Our ship is flying like a storm!
Gods, look at our cast
We are sky sailing
The fury of the sky is born!
