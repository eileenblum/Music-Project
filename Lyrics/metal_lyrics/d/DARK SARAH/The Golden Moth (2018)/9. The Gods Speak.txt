[Dark Sarah:]
I made it here, the gods, they are
Arriving! Look there, they're like angels with halos!
How strange, they're fierce with their white
Spears. You know, they're not welcoming me nor you

[Dragon:]
The world is ours, I've redeemed my sins
But I'm not welcome here, not anymore?
[Iron Mask:]
The more you try, the more we
Fight to keep you there where you belong, the underworld!
[White Beard:]
The world was ours! You've
Returned to us but you're not welcome here, it's not your home!
[Dark Sarah:]
Home, I am here to find my way back home!
[The gods:]
But you're not welcome here! Not anymore!

[Dark Sarah:]
I, I've tried to find a way to
Reach the skies but today I know the gods don't
Hear, there will be no tomorrow

[Iron Mask:]
I see, you walk now with the mortals
It's sad. She will pay this with her life
[White Beard:]
We burned your wings for a reason
And now you bring a mortal here!
[Dragon:]
I did not bring her to you, you see, she has
Her own reason to be here!
[Dark Sarah:]
Here in my hands I have the keys to
You so please now let me pass the gate of time

[Dragon:]
I, I've tried to find a way to
Reach the skies but today I know the gods don't
Hear, there will be no tomorrow

[The gods:]
Hear now, we won't change the plan
The universe has spoken. Can't you hear how it's raging
The storm is coming closer!
Raging for the world the order
The white spears ask for blood!

[Dark Sarah &amp;Dragon:]
I, I've tried to find a way to
Reach the skies but today I know the gods don't
Hear, there will be no tomorrow â tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow!
[The gods:]
It all ends here, time runs out so see how
Life disappears from her and fate is drear
