[feat. Manuela Kraller]The ferryman came
to end this game
lift me up, let me rest in the rain
and float on the golden tears

This shimmery boat
Made me think of you
looking up, watching the moon
and towards the light I headed in the night

Where do you take me with your white boat?
On these golden tears this ferry floats
Be welcome, healing rain, take away my pain
- Be welcome to make me whole again!

I've found my way on the misty island
looked the sea in the eyes and 
I've danced with death himself

This journey's my own
My path far from home 
but where does it lead from here?
- In these streams!
Will not disappear!

Where do you take me with your white boat?
On these golden tears this ferry floats
Be welcome, healing rain, take away my pain
- Be welcome to make me whole again!

Fate: 
You've found the fountains of light 
after all this time
You have chosen to live now use the chance wisely
Together: I/Promise to follow the path of light, 
not to stray 
Fate: 
Let the rain of golden tears fix you and make you 

whole again

Where do you take me with your white boat?
On these golden tears this ferry floats
Be welcome, healing rain, take away my pain
- Be welcome to make me whole again!
