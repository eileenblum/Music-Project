[feat. Jp LeppÃ¤luoto][DRAGON:] 
I know why you're here,
don't try to escape my dear,
you've been naughty I know
by trying to steal something of my own

[DARK SARAH:]
I have no idea, why I have been dragged down here...

[DRAGON:]
Don't lie!

[DARK SARAH:]
...Nor what you're talking about,
and sir there's no reason to shout!

[DRAGON:]
And sure there's a reason to shout!

[DARK SARAH:]
I saw the key but didn't steal!

[DRAGON:]
You saw the key and tried to steal!

[DRAGON:] 
I see... What do we have here?

[DARK SARAH:]
What?... nothing...

[DRAGON:] 
Now I know why you're here, you are a mischievous thief, 

[DARK SARAH:]
...  just can't lie to him...

[DRAGON:] 
But if you want the key, you need to earn it my my dear!

[DARK SARAH:]
He sees right through me, oh 
bugger! He just..

[DRAGON:]
This is how we treat our
guests who are trying to cheat, you need
to earn it my dear!

[DARK SARAH:]
...took the only ticket I had, I guess I have to

[DRAGON:]
so you will be my rag doll tonight, tonight,

[DARK SARAH:]
see where this leads

[DRAGON:]
At the dragon's ball!

[DARK SARAH &amp; DRAGON:]
Take my all, I surrender, surrender!
Look at me and the way I ask for forgiveness, kindness and help!
Take my all, I surrender, surrender!
You/I will die another day, another way

[DARK SARAH:]
I think we're done now

[DRAGON:]
You think so?

[DARK SARAH:]
...I have to go! 

[DRAGON:]
You're not going anywhere!

[DARK SARAH:]
Why are you, making this

[DRAGON:]
You don't know...

[DARK SARAH:]
...Harder than it is?

[DRAGON:]
I cry on my own...

[DARK SARAH:]
You have the key,

[DRAGON:]
In this lonely place...

[DARK SARAH:]
That you don't even need

[DRAGON:]
That is why...

[DARK SARAH:]
You're standing here between me and my life.

[DRAGON:]
...I'm standing here between you and your life!

[DARK SARAH:]
...I'm sorry to say...

[DRAGON:]
What now?... just get off with your tail! 

Hahhah!!!

[DARK SARAH &amp; DRAGON:]
Take my all, I surrender, surrender!
Look at me and the way I ask for forgiveness, kindness and help!
Take my all, I surrender, surrender!
You/I will die another day, another way

[DARK SARAH:]
Aaaah, you best moves...

[DRAGON:]

[DARK SARAH:]
I just need the key, I'm trying to get out of here
I know that it's a bad deal
And disappointed you must feel
But please help me to escape

[DARK SARAH &amp; DRAGON:]
Take my all, I surrender, surrender!
Look at me and the way I ask for forgiveness, kindness and help!
Take my all, I surrender, surrender!
You/I will die another day, another way
Look at me and the way I ask for 
Forgiveness, kindness and help!
Take my all, I surrender, surrender!
We will die another day, another way... another way...another way...another day...another way...!
