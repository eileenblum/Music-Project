[feat. Charlotte Wessels][DARK SARAH:]
The eye of the sea is looking at me...

[EVIL SIREN MERMAID:]
I can take you there if you only dare!

[DARK SARAH:]
I've reached out into the darkness long enough now it reaches out to me!

[EVIL SIREN MERMAID:]
I am the sea and I'm calling!
Look the sea in the eye - it's hiding, it's waiting in the shadows!

[EVIL SIREN MERMAID:]
Hear me now, don't fight back or this ocean will be your watery grave, and the sea, it will entomb your barrer bones for eternity, forever and eternity!

[DARK SARAH &amp; EVIL SIREN MERMAID:]
Down, down, down the eye of the ocean sees you
Down, down, down the depth of the ocean owns you...

[DARK SARAH:]
I've dragged down by a monster of the sea and night, I cannot fight!

[EVIL SIREN MERMAID:]
Be warned my friend - an angel and a mermaid are never the same, are never, ever the same!

[DARK SARAH:]
Down, down, down the eye of the ocean sees you
Down, down, down the depth of the ocean owns you
Aquarium - if you gaze long into the abyss and darkness
Aquarium - the abyss will gaze back into you

[EVIL SIREN MERMAID:]
Take my hand together we dance!

[DARK SARAH:]
Into the depths under Aquarium!
the abyss of Aquarium!

[DARK SARAH &amp; EVIL SIREN MERMAID:]
Down, down, down the eye of the ocean sees you
Down, down, down the depth of the ocean owns you
Aquarium - if you gaze long into the abyss and darkness
Aquarium - the abyss will gaze back into you

[DARK SARAH &amp; EVIL SIREN MERMAID:]
Aquarium, if you gaze long into the abyss and darkness
Aquarium, the abyss will gaze back into you

[EVIL SIREN MERMAID:]
AQUARIUM,

[DARK SARAH:]
I'm ready to dive...

[EVIL SIREN MERMAID:]
AQUARIUM!

[DARK SARAH:]
...I'm ready to die - it's hiding, waiting in the shadows!
