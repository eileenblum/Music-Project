Marching through the tidesâ¦
If I could change, I'd change what's mine to change
Marching through the tidesâ¦
Give me a sign and I'll jump from the heights
and they can wonder why 
I fell down and died
Marching through the tidesâ¦
Give me a sign and I'll jump to the sky 
Marching through the tidesâ¦
give me a sign and no one asks you why 
you still loved me 
or why am I still here,
the morning comes turning to a day 
and I'll be colors in the..

Rainbow world 
You'll out it changes you
Rainbow world 
you'll out how strange it is
In the Rainbow world 
You'll be the foam on the sea
It's a rainbow, it's a rainbow world for me 

Marching through the tidesâ¦
Rainbow world!
Marching through the tidesâ¦
You fantasized about the dark, 
and let the evil light its spark
Marching through the tidesâ¦
give me a sign and I'll jump to the sky 
Marching through the tidesâ¦
give me a sign and no one asks you 
why did it become real, 
and why am I still here!

Rainbow world 
You'll out it changes you
Rainbow world you'll out how strange it is
In the rainbow world 
You'll be the foam on the sea
It's a rainbow, it's my fall and the afterglow!

At the brake of dawn 
The Cliffhanger falls
At the brake of dawn 
The Cliffhanger falls

Rainbow world 
You'll out it changes you
Rainbow world 
you'll out how strange it is
In the Rainbow world 
You'll be the foam on the sea
It's a rainbow, it's a rainbow world 
It's a rainbow world, a rainbow world
it's my fall 
Rainbow world 
You'll be the foam on the sea
It's a rainbow
it's my fall and the afterglow!
