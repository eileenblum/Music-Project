I'm searching for a getaway, a better day,
but where are all the people, I cannot stay
in this awful place a minute longer
Hey bird is this is the way?
This labyrinth is missing with my head
- hey don't flay away!
There's a little gate â goodbye, bye muddy hole!

I'll dance the night away
swaying like the hay in the wind of change!
I'm moving to the beat, surrendering to heat, 
the moment's holding on!

Who are these little men with little hacks 
who dance around the fireplace? 
A funny play 
on this awful day, maybe they can help me to f nd a 

way to f ee this place- a stinky pile of dirt and the 

muddy caves 
AND the little men... â goodbye, bye muddy hole!

I'll dance the night away swaying 
like the hay in the wind of change!
I'm moving to the beat, surrendering to heat, 
the moment's holding on!

I'll dance the night away, 
feel the rhythm in my veins!
I'm dancing on the stars, moon, 
I hold you in my arms! Aaah!
