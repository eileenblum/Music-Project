And there is no redemption for me,
And there is no forgiveness for my sins.

How did I get to this place where nothing is the same?
Have I lost everything somewhere along the way?
When did the world pass me by?
When did I become oblivious?

Where do we go when we must die?
Is this my chance for redemption?
I will find hope someplace not far
Somewhere, deep within myself.

Where do we go when we must die?
Is this my chance for redemption?
I will find hope someplace not far
And in my desolation, a prayer.

And in my desolation
In my darkest hour
In my despair
In my desolation, a prayer.

And there is no redemption for me,
And there is no forgiveness for my sins.
