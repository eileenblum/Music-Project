Here I am
A symbol of human tragedy
Here I stand
A deplorable broken man
Why do we ask the questions?
Of answers we do not wish to know

Broken, haunting memories of times old,
Searching, for answers to unfold
The mystery that leaves me torn between
Two worlds in a darkened corner
Weeping softly I tear my flesh.

The sun is gone and what is left my dark
I bury the past in the empty wasteland of despair

Times have changed and we count hours
Of Solitude and despair
Turmoil breaking, senses waking
Leading me no where.

The sun is gone and what is left my dark
I bury the past in the empty wasteland of despair
