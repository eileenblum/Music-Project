A storm is brewing somewhere far beyond
The clouds are in motion and the sky is growing dark
The howling wind is approaching fast

The diminishing feeling of the quiet calm
Frantic beating of a fragile human heart
An infernal terror sweeps through the land
The storm is upon us and destiny has deceived us all

Destiny has deceived us all and we brace ourselves for a catastrophe
