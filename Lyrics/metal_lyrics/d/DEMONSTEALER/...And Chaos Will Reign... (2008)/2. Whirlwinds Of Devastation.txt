Follow the storm, the path of destruction
Encompassing all, the whirlwinds,
Leaving a trail of devastation.

Wrath of god, the force of nature
Gone in a flash, it makes them disappear.
There is no escape from destiny.
We are at the mercy of this fury.

There is no escape from what we fear
There is no stronghold to save us
We must find a way

Spiraling doom, into blackened nothingness.
Ravaging lands, leaving nothing taking all into darkness.
