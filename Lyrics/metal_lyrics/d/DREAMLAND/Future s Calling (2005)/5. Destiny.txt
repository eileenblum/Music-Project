[Eriksson / Lundberg]

Once again I'm back where our journey started
I'm frozen lost and all alone

Met my enemy through hell and heaven wandered
Day fades to night I must be strong

And even if you know that every single step you take.
can be your last
you must carry on your fight, see your demons die
life is not a game

Hand in hand with destiny. come take us higher
flying to eternity destinyÂ´s calling calling me

ThereÂ´s a different world outside, a cold windÂ´s blowing
I see life pass before my eyes

IÂ´m searching high and low for answers I canÂ´t find now
IÂ´m lost inside the crystal ball

and even I you know that every single step you take
can be your last. you must carry on your fight see your demons die
life is not a game

Hand in hand with destiny come take us higher
flying to eternity destinyÂ´s calling calling me

Maybe I am wrong but shouldnÂ´t we be proud of who we are

If the hand of fate, directs our lives
I do believe this world is full of lies

and even I you know that every single step you take
can be your last
you must carry on your fight see your demons die
life is not a game

Hand in hand with destiny come take us higher
flying to eternity destinyÂ´s calling calling me
