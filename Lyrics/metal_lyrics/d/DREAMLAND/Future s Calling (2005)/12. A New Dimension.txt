[Eriksson / Lundberg, Cans]

Do you still remember how it used to be
Flames burning higher enlightens thee.

Magic light always surrounds them
Their destiny, who gained them strength to rise and see

Universe collides
The stars are falling fast towards the ground

Daylight's on the run The ones who's left
is searching for the answers we can't find

A new dimension
A secret time a secret life

A new dimension
searching for the answers we canÂ´t find

As they're fighting for a way to see I am searching higher for a way to be
On a journey to the history

Magic light always surrounds them
Their destiny, who gained them strength to rise and see

Universe collides the stars are falling fast towards the ground

Daylight's on the run the ones who's left
is searching for the answers we can't find

A new dimension.
