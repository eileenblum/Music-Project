[Eriksson / Lundberg]

As the morning comes another night is gone
The sun enlightens the plains where victory was won

So many tales to tell how generations failed
To make this world go around without the sign of red

All of our lives we live and fight for our beliefs but what if we could find

A way to travel through time together
And see how long we would survive

So we could travel to hell or heaven
and make a difference for our sons, destiny

He used to be the so strong so proud of what he's done
His hair is gray so many medals he has won

He speaks about victory how many lives he's freed
He is a hero left with deadly memories

All of our lives we live and fight! for our beliefs but what if we could find

A way to travel through time together and see how long we will survive

If we could travel to hell or heaven and make a difference for our sons, destiny

DREAMLAND
No religions or prayers for salvation
DREAMLAND
No more deathÂ´s caused by hateÂ´s devastation
DREAMLAND
Side by side people live in one nation
DREAMLAND
No one knows what the word means to cry

A way to travel through time together and see how long we will survive

If we could travel to hell and heaven and make a difference for our sons destiny
