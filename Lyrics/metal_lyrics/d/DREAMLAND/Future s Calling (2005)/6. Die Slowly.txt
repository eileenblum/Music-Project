[Lundberg Rendlert / Lundberg]

I looked in his eyes I realized
how could he do this to me while I'm still alive

I had plans but they stay unfulfilled
I look dead to you but pain I feel

Why can't you see I'm lying here bleeding alone
this is my fight IÂ´m gonna make it all alone

I die slowly
I got a message from above
I am forever I will carry on

I die slowly
I got a message from above
I am forever I will carry on

As he searched to find a sign of life
I remembered how I tried to smile

Suddenly I saw my friends in tears
the machine was dead and so the pain inside of me

Why can't you see I'm lying here bleeding alone
this is my fight, IÂ´m gonna make it all alone

I die slowly
I got a message from above
I am forever I will carry on

I die slowly
I got a message from above
I am forever I will carry on
