[Lundberg, Rauti / Lundberg]

Someday the truth of pain
I know youÂ´ll understand
That every single day is one day closer to the end

I've lost my patience
but It is time for you to see
All of you who's fighting but your deeds ainÂ´t worth a thing

Look at me a man who's free
Every dayÂ´s the same
for you but not for me

Breaking the chains
Seven fires burn within your mind
Breaking the chains
Seen from my eyes, you live a lie
Breaking the chains
One step higher, ItÂ´s time youÂ´ll see
Breaking the chains
Tomorrow may be, the last for you and me

I know how you feel
I've been there by myself
but when this universe explodes, I will be somewhere else

Why can't you tell me
What happiness can be
Decades made of misery but finally your free

Look at me a man who's free
Every dayÂ´s the same
for you but not for me

Breaking the chains
Seven fires burn within your mind
Breaking the chains
Seen from my eyes you live a lie
Breaking the chains
One step higher ItÂ´s time youÂ´ll see
Breaking the chains
Tomorrow may be, the last for you and me
