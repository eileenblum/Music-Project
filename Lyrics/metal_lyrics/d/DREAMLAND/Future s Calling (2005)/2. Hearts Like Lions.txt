[Eriksson / Lundberg]

I had it all clear in my mind my path of life to go
already chosen before my birth even was to come

A life made of dreams of others believes their way to gain control
Mind games that pledged my directions I couldnÂ´t take it no more

Daily we see what can happen to life
We live like immortals and then we die

Searching for answers, for why we are here
the force inside us all to live another day

With hearts like lions
we are stronger than them all and it will take us higher
Hearts like lions
we are stronger than them all

So here I stand
back on the road where it all began
if I had listened to their words were would I be then

But I have gained strength by standing alone
They failed they did wrong

With memories left in your mind! my future stands right by my side

Daily we see what can happen to life
We live like immortals and then we die

Searching for answers for why we are here
the force inside us all to live another day

With hearts like lions
we are stronger than them all and it will take us higher
Hearts like lions
we are stronger than them all
