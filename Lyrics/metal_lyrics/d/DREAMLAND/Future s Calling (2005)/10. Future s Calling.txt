[Eriksson / Lundberg, Cans]

If we could see their world
ItÂ´s getting colder

And let us pray tonight
As they grow older

On and on on and on
They say

The future is calling
They search the world but no one is there
Children of the night

Losing faith as they're falling
As they're out alone
Children of the night
Children of the night

So many years have past
A revelation
As we prepare to die
For our nation

On and on on and on
They say

The future is calling
They search the world but no oneÂ´s there
Children of the night

Losing faith as they're falling
As they're out alone
Children of the night
Children of the night
