[Eriksson / Lundberg, Cans]

Daily we feed our perfection
How come we've been walkin' this way
Watching the world growing everyday
But it's killing itself in someway

A heartbeat away from the place of no return
Sworn in the name of the ancient rites to change the world

Gently the rain hits my shoulders
This street's been my home since she died
I do this to show every human mind
It's time for a change you and I

A heartbeat away from the place of no return
Sworn in the name of the ancient rites to change the world

A new way of freedom
The sign is here believe us
A new way of power
For every soul

Surrounded by thunder and lightning
Is this what we want it to be
Surrender your pride, it's time to believe
Something is calling for thee

A heartbeat away from the place of no return
Sworn in the name of the ancient rites to change the world

A new way of freedom
The sign is here believe us
A new way of power
For every soul
