[Eriksson / Lundberg]

What if time could be erased, what would you do
I would have chosen the day we first met

Our love was magical. Love meant to be
we had the future in hand

I gave you everything, you threw it away
Tell me so I understand

You're all I asked for
Now I'm alone, Why can't I make you stay

You're all I needed, Made me complete
Our love has gone away
Fade away

As I lay me down to sleep
I'm all alone, I wish that tomorrow
Our love is reborn

Our love was magical
Love meant to be
we had the future in hand

I gave you everything
you threw it away
Tell me so I understand

You're all I asked for
Now IÂ´m alone
Why canÂ´t I make you stay

You're all I needed
Made me complete
Our love has gone away
Fade away
