We are all together
Forever and ever

Well someone told me this is where you want me
And we've been told what we belong in hell
But we don't care about it
Cause here we are to make this night immortal

Devil in disguise
Riders in the sky

Pray today
This day won't be our last
All for one
And one for all

Side by side
United we stand tall
We are all together
Forever and ever

As you all know we have the same opinion
We own same legacy metal never dies
We tour the earth to show you the strength of steel
And you can't melt it down

Judgement day can come
Together we belong

Pray today
This day won't be our last
All for one
And one for all

Side by side
United we stand tall
We are all together
Forever and ever

Pray today
This day won't be our last
All for one
And one for all
We are all together
Forever and ever
