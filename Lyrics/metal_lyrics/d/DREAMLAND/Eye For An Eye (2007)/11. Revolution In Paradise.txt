I did just realize that all the things you see
I am not immortal as the guy on TV
There's no religion that can save me from the pain
I was a superhero now I'm just insane

It's a false charade
We can't end this masquerade

Revolution solution the price we must pay

Face your fears rely
On the force you have inside

Revolution delusion there is no one to blame

Demons are calling from another sphere
Chained in your mind there's no remedy
Complex reality

On another sun
On another sun in a world beyond
In a world beyond
Now the time has come
Put your fears aside
Put your fears aside
Raise your hands and touch the sky
Send a message to all
Revolution in paradise

You see another dawn there right before your eyes
Take it for granted as your children and your wife
What I remember you were a replica of me
We made a promise we should follow our dreams

When the curtain fall
I have sailed the seven seas
Revolution confusion
Which leg should you lean on

If you told your eyes
Let your senses be your guide

Revolution conclusion
Put an end to this game

Demons are calling from another sphere
Chained in your mind there's no remedy
Complex reality

On another sun
On another sun in a world beyond
In a world beyond
Now the time has come
Put your fears aside
Put your fears aside
Raise your hands and touch the sky
Send a message to all
Revolution in paradise

Revolution in paradise
Revolution in paradise

On another sun

Revolution in paradise
Revolution in paradise

On another sun

Revolution
Revolution

Revolution in paradise
