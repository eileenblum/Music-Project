Come take my hand and tell me
That I can rule the universe
But something's
Get stuck in the wheel

Diffusing eclipse and illusions
We're caught in their web alive
The ladder to the sky to short to climb

We are the chosen ones
We live 'til the day we die
Surrender your leaf and explore what surrounds you
We are the chosen ones

We walk the blade believe me
I would have done it all again
But something is
Now what it seams to be

Diffusing eclipse and illusions
We're caught in their web alive
The ladder to the sky to short to climb

We are the chosen ones
We live 'til the day we die
Surrender your leaf and explore what surrounds you
We are the chosen ones
