You're all alone
And you are staring into nowhere
A bright reflection comes before your eyes

Satisfaction grows stronger
A conformable hunger

Ooo
Spread your wings and fly
Aaa
Destination beyond the sun

A brand new life
Sometimes it's hard to see the picture
Life's upside down
A new tomorrow in another world

There's no reason to cry
There's a way to survive

Spread your wings and fly
Aaa
Destination beyond the sun

But with time you'll see
It's a game to me
But I threw my aces
And now I am standing
Here with empty hands

Spread your wings and fly
