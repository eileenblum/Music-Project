You were left behind in
A rain of cries
All you see behind is a wall of lies
Were your sacrifices justified

Don't you realise
See the truth before your eyes

The world is falling for my eyes
The price you've paid
You threw away your future
You gambled and you lost your pride
Reverse, deny
Or sacrifice your life

As you feel the wind blowing from behind
They are closer now you're running out of time
Fate is watching you with his own black eyes

You must throw the dice
Or the key to hell is mine

The world is falling for my eyes
The price you've paid
You threw away your future
You gambled and you lost your pride
Reverse, deny
Or sacrifice your life
