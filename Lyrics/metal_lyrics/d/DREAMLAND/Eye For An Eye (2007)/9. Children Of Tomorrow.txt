The day the curtain fall
We turn a blind eyes to reality
A selfish sanctuary
Where our wisdom is concealed by greed
Always forget the fact we're no the only generation here

Cause now the time has come
To open up our eyes and face our fears

This is a message for us all
Make a change tear down the wall
For the children of tomorrow

We're running our of time
To make a change we need to realize
But the postpone the problems
And hope the someone else we make it right
As we deny it all
The world is falling and there's nothing left

And soon the day appears
When our children have to clean our mess

This is a message for us all
Make a change tear down the wall
For the children of tomorrow
If the judgement day appears
We have failed our destiny
And the children of tomorrow

Ohohohohohohohohohohoho
This is a message for us all
Make a change tear down the wall
For the children of tomorrow

And the children of tomorrow
