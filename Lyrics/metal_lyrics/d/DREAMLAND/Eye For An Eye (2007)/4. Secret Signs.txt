You fight for freedom but you
Run away from justice
A combination devastation or harmony
You spread the word this is the final liberation
The sands of time has turned
You'll drown in the see of greed

As long as you think you're a cat with nine lives
Wake up 'cause the flames of fury
Comes against you and no one survives

Communication through the air between the borders
A cryptic confidence relying on your mistakes
So many hearts to save a world to keep in order
Strategic missions where the minds eye reflect their pain

As long as you think you're a cat with nine lives
Wake up 'cause the flames of fury
Comes against you and no one survives

Will you fight for me
Get ready to die
Get out in the field to defend your pride
Secret signs appears on the wall
We'll show them our sign
And together we stand tall
