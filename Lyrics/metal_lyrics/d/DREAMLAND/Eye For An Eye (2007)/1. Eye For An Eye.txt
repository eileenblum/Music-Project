When you're tired of running
Your frustration appears where you cannot hide
And the bones in your body
Starts to shake one mistake
And it blows your mind

Rise or fall
You aim for the white line
To sell the score

An eye for an eye
One more and you're falling
Addiction
An endless mission
My life for your dreams
My heart for your soul
And your freedom for my beliefs

Each day ends up in sorrow
As it runs through your veins you have justified
To surrender tomorrow
Cause tonight you will fight
Til you hit the ground

Misery
Inject it directly
I fear no evil

An eye for an eye
One more and you're falling
Addiction
An endless mission
My life for your dreams
My heart for your soul
And your freedom for my beliefs
