Whispering voices silent cries
Rising from the dark
Secret quests another world
Where fire rules the heart

A dÃ©jÃ  vu
The truth concealed
There's thunder in the air
Memories of misery
Until we're born again
Force of evil lust and pain
Devastation who's to blame
Resurrected
From the grave

In the shadows of the night
Forever free
Lock the door and throw away the key
On the threshold of our lives
We realize
Eden's burning as the sand runs out

No remorse to backup plan
The syth of sympathy
Cross the land the shortest way
We're living in the fast line

There's no option to surrender
We're fighting to survive
Casting shadows on the wall
Just as the bloodred sky

Force of evil lust and pain
Devastation who's to blame
Resurrected
From the grave

In the shadows of the night
Forever free
Lock the door and throw away the key
On the threshold of our lives
We realize
Eden's burning as the sand runs out
