Riding through the night
Reaching for the bright horizon
All is left behind
Painful scars inside my mind

Surrounded by fire
An endless desire

Feel for me
Once again
Set me free
Life is a carousel of pain
Why can't you realize
The demons inside you
A creation of life in despair
Carousel

No more past to see
Future's calling out for me

It's my liberation
Soul recreation

Feel for me
Once again
Set me free
Life is a carousel of pain
Why can't you realize
The demons inside you
A creation of life in despair
Carousel
