They thought they had it in their hands
As they searched on the bottom
A secret life nothing compared
To one that we share

Geronimo
Scalp my mind

If you have it all
Desire
For a higher life supreme
Take a ride beyond
The heavens
To a broken destiny

If life is heavenly designed
There are more questions than answers
What's the meaning
Where's the sign
When you're crossing the line

Napoleon
Let's sail away

If you have it all
Desire
For a higher life supreme
Take a ride beyond
The heavens
To a broken destiny
