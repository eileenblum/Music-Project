Same dream
Lifeline
Sweat runs down my spine

Questions
Predictions
Her eyes start to flatter

No
Leave my future alone

Please let me out of this world
What I see for my eyes
How we're all gonna burn
Follow the line in your hand
The path of your life
Like a map in our heads
Please let me out of this world
What I see for my eyes
How it's all gonna turn
Just like exploring new lands
Our future is written in lines you can see in your hands
It's the curse

Broken
Mirrors
And some start to shiver
Lucid illusions
For those who are collusive
