Snow is falling
Stormy rains
Darkness everywhere

Below zero
Always colder
Today than yesterday

Trapped inside
We hoard our food
And ration our lives

Some believe that
The sun is a myth
It's time for me to fly

Oh, this ain't wonderland
It's a place on earth
Where nothing works

Come feel the Nordic rage
I can't
Stand it another day
Can you picture it all
Life in a hollow shell
Born in hell
Pray
This is my revenge
Nordic rage

Finally airborne
On the run
From these godforsaken plains

Judge by my surprise
When I land
In the flaming burning drains
