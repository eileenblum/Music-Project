I've been driving this lonely road
For a couple of reasons you don't wanna know!

I will find what I'm looking for
No is the last thing they say
I am collecting souls

I drive through the mist
There she's standing on the side
Can you gimme a ride

She'll be the next in line
A heavenly design
Just like a holy sign
At exit 49

What came to be the end
And my walk towards hell
Where hell on earth is to be found
The exit 49

There's this weakness inside of me

What you want ain't the thing you'll get
So I decided to change that
I've never regret it

Right from the start
She just looked the same
And I
I thought she was
Into the game that I play

A mist before my eyes
And a blur I can't define
I'm buried alive
