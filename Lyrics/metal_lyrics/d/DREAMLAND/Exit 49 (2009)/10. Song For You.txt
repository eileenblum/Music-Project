I light a candle
Keep staring at the rain
I'm picking up the pieces
What was love transformed to pain

I look at photos
As tears fall from my eyes
Would love to hold you close
To be near you for a while

And even if I know you're gone
Oh, I'm still holding on to the loving memories

I try to find out
Was it me that couldn't see
I'm looking back to figure out, was it something in between

We never even argued
We never even shed a tear
But suddenly you flipped the coin and next day you disappeared

And even if I know you're gone
I sing this song here all alone
For the love of you and me

I sing this song for you
Wherever you may be
I hope you sometimes think of me

I hope you understand
The pain that I'm going through
