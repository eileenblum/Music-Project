I wake up cold
Turn around
You're still asleep

I dreamed that we belonged like this
Side by side
A silent kiss
But who am I fooling

Afraid to see
We're meant to be
It's a venture

My innocence
Leaves no room
For feelings that I have to prove

Angels are crying
And so is my heart

When the moment comes
And you feel alone
Then you try to remember what went wrong
Then you realize
It's too late to cry
Spread your wings and learn to fly

I take my clothes
From the floor
And close the door

I've started my journey home
A cold wind blows
I walk the road
Another adventure

You lose your hope
To find the one
You're looking for

Instead you take what you can find
Another night with steamed-up lies

She knows in the morning
That you will be gone
