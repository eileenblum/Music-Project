Searching for a purpose
A conclusion that defines
The thin line crossing borders
As I speed dial 911

Different innovations
As a flaming ball of fire
Change your aggravation
And the platform for your anger

So now I know you never let go
Carved in stone
As the truth reveals

You know I long for you
You know I'd kill to be
Could give up my life for
You are all I need
I'd buy the stars above us
Consort with enemies
But that doesn't matter
A touch of evil

Time is just a conduct
So we know how long that's left
Until the final curtain falls
Inhale our final breath

Say it doesn't matter
As it circles in my mind
I never dare to ask you
So you never will reply
