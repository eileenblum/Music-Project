I may not live until you die
But maybe my ghost will survive

I'm letting my ego prevail
Continue the game that we play

Lick my skin clean
I've designed
Your own medicine refined!

When I'm far away from you
A puzzle with two pieces
What's been missing on the run
A wound which never ever heals
When I'm far away from you
It used to be so easy
Intertwining into one
A wound can heal

Time's come to harvest the seed
And you'll see what time's done with me

And nothing can stand in my way
My scars are my memory lane!

Come and take
Me in your arms
As the countdown has begun
