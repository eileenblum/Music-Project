[music: Dark Embrace, lyrics: Oscar Asunder]

Tears are drowning me
I can't live with this sorrow
I want to escape from this dream
I dream about a thousand people dying
The end of summer... the beginning of the death
Two candles burning... this is the end 
The end of feelings
The end of hope
The end of dreams
The end of all
Revenge is what I scream
Everybody has the right to live
Nobody wants his own death but
Religions kill
The end of summer... the beginning of the death
Two candles burning... this is the end 
The end of feelings
The end of hope
The end of dreams
The end of all

But while I behold the candlelight... there is hope
