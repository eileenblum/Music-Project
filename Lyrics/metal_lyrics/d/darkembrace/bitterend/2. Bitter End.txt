[music: Dark Embrace, lyrics: Oscar Asunder]

Dying in a world without sky
I'd give my life to see the light
But all I can see is pain and suffering
Crying in a dream without hope
I know this is my bitter home
I'm waiting for the end
Dying in a world without sky
Crying in a world without hope
Spring, it's when we begin to live
Summer, it's when we learn to fly
Autumn, it's when we begin to fall
Winter, this is our bitter end
It's when we're born, the beginning of our life
It's when we're born, the beginning of our death
Breathing in a world without air
I can't find the meaning of life
But all I can feel is sorrow and death
Sleeping while I cry for the end
I don't want more pain
I'm waiting for the truth
Breathing in a world without air
Sleeping while I cry for the end
Spring, it's when we begin to live
Summer, it's when we learn to fly
Autumn, it's when we begin to fall
Winter, this is our bitter end
Bitter End ! ! !
Dark light is on my side... it's my shadow
Everyone has the same destiny... and I'm afraid
Weeping inside my mind I feel so alone
Awaiting for my bitter end
Dying in a world without sky
I'd give my life to see the light
But all I can see is pain and suffering
Crying in a dream without hope
I know this is my bitter home
I'm waiting for the end
Dying in a world without sky
Crying in a world without hope
