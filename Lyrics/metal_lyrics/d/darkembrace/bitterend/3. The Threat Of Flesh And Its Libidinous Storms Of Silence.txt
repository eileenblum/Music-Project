[music: Dark Embrace, lyrics: Oscar Asunder]

Scourges through the endless pain is what thy mind preached for years.
A gift of torture from a labour of love. Loather in your black eyes full of blood.
Your love in vain had been sodomized for years in a constant decay of our libertine race.
In the shadows of our lives. A sigh despites the Christian lies.
Unholy rites of darkness is our way of life. Storms of pleasure every night. 
We are making war against Christendom. We are the threat of flesh in the altar.
Church are violated by our libidinous thoughts and deeds.
The tongue of darkness penetrated you and then you whimpered and cried forever in our bloody lives.
A dead poem is what I see when I look at your carnal pleasures.
Poetry from the past is the meaning of your present life full of lust.
In the shadows of our lives. A sigh despites the Christian lies.
Unholy rites of darkness is our way of life. Storms of pleasure every night. 
We are making war against Christendom. We are the threat of flesh in the altar.
Church are violated by our libidinous thoughts and deeds.
We have been sinning against god and his stupid lambs.
A crescendo of sins and pleasure is what we became and what you had wished.
Scourges through the endless pain is what thy mind preached for years.
A gift of torture from a labour of love. Loather in your black eyes full of blood.
Your love in vain had been sodomized for years in a constant decay of our libertine race.
In the shadows of our lives. A sigh despites the Christian lies.
Unholy rites of darkness is our way of life. Storms of pleasure every night. 
We are making war against Christendom. We are the threat of flesh in the altar.
Church are violated by our libidinous thoughts and deeds.
