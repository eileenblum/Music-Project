[performed by Dead Congregation]Kneel - Behold - And praise!

Cast the penitent man
In perennial blasphemous affliction
Repentance is for the oblivious
Followers of him!

Kneel, behold and praise
Deeds of orthodox damnation
Indulgence of the flesh?
Alas!
Distort the path of God!
My soul - exempt from you...

Hereditary plague is the deceit
...of Jesus Christ
Force-fed to follow his path
Castrated from all lust

I give into temptation
As I thrive on carnal ecstasy
Dead hope of admittance
To your fucking paradise
