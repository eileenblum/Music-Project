Wrecks of vanishing faith
Long lost herd of self-deceitful
Entrapped in pseudo morality
Sanctimonious disciples of blatant hypocrisy

Sin after sin, you commit
Yet hide in the veils of repentance,
only to sin again!
You repulse me...

Terminate... the bigotry

I assail your paltry messiah
I deflower the immaculate whore
I invert your symbols of worship
For I am the envoy of Satan!
