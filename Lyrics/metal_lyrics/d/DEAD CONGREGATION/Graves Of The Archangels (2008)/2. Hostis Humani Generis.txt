Goat burned god of plagues
In thy name I carve my flesh
I wish to be reborn!

Cast your darkness so I can see the light
Let it perforate my soul
the sun will set no more...

Lay me down on the bed of death
Allow me to return redeemed
Quench my thirst with vigorous bile
Bestow upon me hate

Hostis Humani Generis

Purge the earth from human pest
Manifestation of satanic might
Spit forth thy utmost wrath
An epitome of doom!
