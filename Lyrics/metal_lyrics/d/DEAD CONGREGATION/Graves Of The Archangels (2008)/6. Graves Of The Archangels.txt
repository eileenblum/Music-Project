Rotted bones turn in earth
while eye almighty gazes
Sealed behind its lid
bound by triangular coffin.

Rotted bones turn in the earth
beetles crawl undivine tissue

Soil shifts by movement
remnant seeks another ---

A predator's decayed wing
decorates foreign torso
A lion's claws, old horns of ox
and a manlike face rises monstrous

Rafael, Sandalfon, Michael, Uriel
fourfold immortality rid of life
Debased in mortal graves
In a shameful uprising rejoined

Fourfold immortality rid of life,
fourfold renunciation of ÎÎ¿Î³Î¿Ï
fourfold blasphemy of death.

Denying their father once holy:
on arbitrary anatomy
This hideous mass rises
to replace ÎÎµÏÏÎ¹Î±Ï
