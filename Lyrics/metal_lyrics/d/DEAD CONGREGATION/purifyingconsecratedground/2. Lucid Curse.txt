I curse the stars
And your fire desecrating the wishes of all
In a pool of piss and blood I drown you
And I will laugh until I vomit and my eyes are dead

Conquering the swamps follow his light
He shows me the way, is my guide
Descending like a vulture these bottomless cliffs

The sun never burnt this god's wings

(I curse the stars) and your fire
Desecrating the wishes of all
In a pool of piss and blood I drown you
And I will laugh until I vomit and my eyes are dead

Conquering the swamps follow his light
He shows me the way, he is my guide
Descending like a vulture these bottomless cliffs

A god with horns...

I curse your scars and your desire
Bitter creator, conqueror destructor
No resurrection no crystal spirit lifeform
You spoke lies of salvation and triumph
