Drug-addict Christian minds, waiting to be manipulated
Sheep to follow the teacher, but you were the first one lost, cunt...
Destructive, driven by demons, Christfucking the temple above
I now have you blindfolded on your knees...

This is the end of your fairytale
The crown is deep in your skin

I shall carry you in a cage of claws and flesh
Till the dusk of time, to face his rise in darkness

Abandoned, terrorfilled, disgraced
This will be your hell, no redemption
Tears of fright...

Nuclearchrist
