Trapped in this twisted
Visionworld of yours
You are the god and king
(Incarnated in one)

Deprive me the disgust of eyes
For I have no mirror in your kingdom
The fall is harder than ever
Drowning in this river
That never seems to end

Gates of black open before me
...Undead
I am no longer your son...
I spit in your face
The taste of my fury
Angelcunt whores raped

Your lifegift collapsed like blood in me
And now this blasphemy is my offer
