Once foretold through scriptures of a time now past
Etchings scribed in complex tongues hidden from man
A tale unfolds depicting an eternal war
For ages sealed, now unleashed; a timeless horror

One final set, a light-giving star buried by darkness
Sinking below the earth, the sun shall now forever rest

Doomed to wage an endless battle
A conflict fought but never settled
Buried flesh long since perished
Lies beneath this destined quarrel

A battle fought between an abandoned earth
And its birth-giver, the timeless universe
