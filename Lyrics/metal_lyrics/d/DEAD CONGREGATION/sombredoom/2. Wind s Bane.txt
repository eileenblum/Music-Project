Dead wind howling
Bodies bend like trees
Praying, kneeling, worshiping

Thousands of them crying for salvation
Hoping, gazing, dying

Robbing their corpses
Stripping them under the eye of their savior
With open armsâ¦

Dead wind ceased, bodies cracked like twigs
Decayed orthodox obscurantism, our vindication
Doing the Devil's work.
