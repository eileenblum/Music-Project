...Alone...
...Scared...
...Empty...
...Once king...

Blood running down your fingers,
Last minute thoughts,
Dripping on the floor.
Corpse collapsing in a pile.

From your rotting and open flesh,
Armies of worms swarm out,
Like waves of black water,
Emptying you from inside.

Until the white of bones,
Rises above your bloated cadaver.

For the first time your existence
Is overwhelmed with life and beauty

Redemptive immolation, redemptive self-sacrifice

Your body for once is a vessel to receive,
But the angels of joy are now silent,
The angels of joy are now in agony,
As they gaze upon this shrine of Holy Death.
