Shades were riding the winds
Towards me, to fill my lungs
Snakes unreel from my hair
As walls crawl closer

Image blurs, stirring cauldron
Suffocating black fumes
Immaculate poison
Descent to maddening silence
Entering this sleep
Dreamless deathlike sleep

Shades were riding the winds
Towards me, fill my lungs
Snakes unreel from my hair
As walls crawl..., crawl... closer

Never to return
Locked inside
Abyss Eternal

Tentacles rising
From the surface
of the subconscious

Immense cliffs of flesh
To satisfy his lust
Forever nailed alive
Nevermore fucking Christ.
