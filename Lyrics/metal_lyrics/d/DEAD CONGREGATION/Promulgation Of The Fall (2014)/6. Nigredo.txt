Black waves drowning the horizon
Ocean swallows ocean -
Earth and spirit flushed away
As reason disintegrates

Black waves drowning the horizon
Hounds leap forth from the waters
Each of them tearing at the throat
While waves wash the body

Black waves drowning the horizon
Admire the beauty of fear
Love the star in the dog's eye
House of the soul falls to the waves

Black waves drowning the horizon
Overwhelming roar of elements
Wading waist-deep into fright
Plunging into infinity

Black waves drowning the horizon
A flickering light in the depths
Sea vomits body ashore
I ollowed by one who walks upright
