Bleed!
Covered in a sheet of guilt
Cold wars, machines will be built

All built by the gods
Collapsing in, collapsing into us all
Machines become maker
Become creator, the eraser

Marching through remains of humans
Violence becomes greater
Drugging humanity into a narcotic coma
A narcotic holocaust

Tubes filled under the skin
Feeding the power
Lighting the sky's
Architectural nightmare

Bodies spread into fluids
Soaking up the machine, blood becomes fuel
Bio harvesting
Internal evil is growing
A time for metal

It will destroy us all
Searching our minds
Your thoughts are not real
Necropolis

Praying for world domination
Harvesting knowledge raped from the dead
Damning us all
Blinding lights fill the sky over and over
The earths grave yard

We bleed the prices of our technology
You built this, now lay down
Before your child

Blinding lights fill the sky
Illuminating a vast graveyard
Machines built spill through catacombs of our country

We built this curse
Victims of a human harvest
We are but cattle, feed the machine
Human harvest
