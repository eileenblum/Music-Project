This is my life
End of all and everything
No belief

This is the fall of man
In seconds we crumble
Unable to piece us back together

Destroy everything inside our world
Its only meat, its only trees
Human plague, it's a true tragedy

Fuck you

I want to rip your insides out of your fucking mouth
Destroy your brain and it leads to chaos
Cause they say this is what I am
Into eternity, this is war, this is

Disease waits to infect and corrode
The beast consumes the man of which I was
I am animal, I am beast
A mutation from disease
Crushing down on you like the jaws of a shark
Like the jaws of a shark

Caving in, collapsing into self
Peel back ribs revealing corrosion
I am now ridding of mortal flesh
I am now infested

Waiting under the skin
Thriving, worming its way out
Thriving
