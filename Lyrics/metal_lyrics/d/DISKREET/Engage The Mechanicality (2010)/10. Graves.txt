Colonies of destruction
A fateful night
Signs of mental danger
Institutions of the devil
Controlled by your faith
Guided by the flames

Endangering the world
To dig ones grave
Unearth the flesh
Releasing the soul

Searching for separation
The visions come with a price you will always pay

Never return onto earth
Bound by soil I'm searching you

As we fall into our own graves

You are to stay here, never to leave this place
The rhythm of decomposing pulses right through my veins
Beats to the heart like a hammer to a nail
A salute to the king of flies,
before being ripped and torn apart

Endangering the world
To dig ones grave
Unearth the flesh
Releasing the soul

Insects fill you, eaten inside out
It is the wretched that binds you to earth
Sink into the flames

It is the soil that binds
Digging hopelessly, not to be found
Forget the flesh

Dissolving the weak

Signs of mental danger
Institutions of the devil
Controlled by your faith
Guided by the flames

Endangering the world
To dig ones grave
Unearth the flesh
Releasing the soul

Searching for separation
The visions come with a price you will always pay

As we fall into our own graves
