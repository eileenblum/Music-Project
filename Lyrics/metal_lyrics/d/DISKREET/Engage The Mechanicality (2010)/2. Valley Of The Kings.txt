Glancing down upon the edge of the black abyss
Blood roars in my ears, I have to resist

Weak...
Alone...
Is when I will fail

Darkness consumes me
As I bask in the glory of the bloodlust
Darkness consumes me
This evil pores from the bastards glass

Man shall drop before desecrating monuments of past
Was this too much for you to take
Begging the war inside us all
March on tear down these walls

No flesh will follow me
Marching through the valley of the kings

These walls created to separate us from ourselves
Something hangs in this air
Spoiling what's left of the breeze
Run from your enemies run from your fate
I'm leading the war
I'm guiding your ruin

Corpses rotting, decomposing with hate
Ten thousands souls won't rest
Concealed within your flesh vultures will rip them out
His hatred is a cannibal that eats the hearts out of men
Consumed with fear you tremble on your knees

Glancing down upon the edge of the black abyss
Blood roars in my ears
I have to resist

Weak...
Alone...
Is when I will fail
Fail
