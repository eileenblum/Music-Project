Born in this you must admit your life is a waste
And you'll never forget
I cancer the world
I breathe in the sick
I hope you die inside

See your ghost
Relive a life of that you hate the most
Controlling a nation, migrating to slave, you are a slave

Mindless creation
Refined in darkness entombed with fright
Those eyes are wide and bright
Teeth grinding coma
haunting panic
dispersed under the skin

The chattering teeth
the cold in the air
the hunger subdues
The eyes of tyrants stare back at you

Born in this you must admit your life is a waste
And you'll never forget
I cancer the world
I breathe in the sick
I hope you die inside

You cant hold us down or stop the solution
We will rise and burn the pollution
Refining, rebuilding, releasing the bishop of war returns
My eyes are open and aiming to stare
I wont blink for a century
Looks like you lost

Refining, rebuilding, the bishop of war returns

We will rise and burn
