hMy actions, they are routine
This demon devours me
My way of life, eternal bliss
No one will miss you or find your remains

Calculating the depth of the knife
Temptation none, I begin to slice
My collection begins

Grey matter pours from your vertebra
As I saw through roots of your spinal decay
You will become screaming pain
I hack into your skull
Your dead eyes watch me

Reaching shoulder deep I rip the fetus from its womb
A stew of maggots seeping on the ground
I take the child, I take your life,
hydraulic acid and a knife.
A feast begins, You fucking cunt!

Wrapping up the body and waste
Tie down the trunk
Wipe up the bloodstain
I seek out the weak, seek out the forsaken
So easy
Your soul dissolves before me
I can't be caught, I cut your beautiful face

Pooling at my feet
A pollution consumed
Food in my gut they start to squirm

Bile brakes down the worm inside them
I plan to keep them with my spines
Your spine breaks
You will become screaming pain

I hack into your skull
Your dead eyes watch me
Searching for answers
You won't find them
Searching for loved ones
It will never end
