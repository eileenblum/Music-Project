Haunt of fear
I am horror, I am grim
A monster to all the haunt of fear
Maker of hell, your end is near

It's good to hurt other people
It's good to make them scream
I forget what look like
I forget about the fear
The screams, so horrid, the screams

The dead turn in their graves
Moaning and begging and praying to the gods
You fucking abomination
I can't hold back
I scream, I snarl, munching like an idiot child
Stripping the bones clean

Tortured by the sight of your face, despised
Choking back vomit and spit
My god, what a mess
My suffering

I am horror, I am grim
A monster to all the haunt of fear
Maker of hell, your end is near

Grueling and watched by spineless spectators
Become vengeance, demented
Changing all the rules, tormented
Choking back those lies
Condemned to shadows of the world
Disgusting though their eyes
A two faced creature on all fours

A dark place, so lonely, so hungry, so starved
Pale blue flesh, boils and blisters
A slack jawed retard
I am haunt of fear
Fear
