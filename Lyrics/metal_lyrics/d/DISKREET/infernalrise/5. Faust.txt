Nails upon upon his hands. Though...Would save you
Searching for hope, your soul is lost
Demons took control...The beast rules you now

What is there to do? You beg for your life
Angels stabbing...Little hope I have left.
Angels stabbing...Little hope I have left.

The cross fell off your back...He forgot about you
He forgot about you...He forgot about you

Soul...It burns...Fire will consume your forever eternal soul
Never will I have compassion for you
You're a waste of time; You sold your soul to sin
To sin...Sold to sin...You're sold to sin
