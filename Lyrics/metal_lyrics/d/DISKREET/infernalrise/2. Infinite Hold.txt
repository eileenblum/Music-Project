Be...Now be
Destroyed by time...Never ending line
When did it start? When will it end?

When will it end...Never. It's just begun...Why can't you see the light?
When will it end? Never...It's just begun. Why can't you see the light?
Deep inside I will try not to see life pass me by

Follow the only path that leads to death
There is no escape from your soul's fate
Fate destroyed you...

It's destroyed by time,
Destroyed by time...A never ending line
When did it start? When will it end?
Time only tells...Is this the only way?
Welcome to my hell. Now feel my pain
Burning inside. Burning inside. Burn...
