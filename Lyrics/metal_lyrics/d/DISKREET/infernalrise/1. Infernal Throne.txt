Smell the skin burn...See your hair singe
Smell the skin burn off your red hot rotting carcass
See the hair singe to black smoke...Where is your god?
Gasoline, poured in your sleep...Awaken
From the burst of your toenails
Rotting meat drops like the rain
Drops like the rain

My hands did the killing...My hands took your soul away from you
My hands...My hands...Took your soul away from you
My hands...
Now you have come to death. Bleed.

Now you have come to death
Brought to ashes, condemned to
Burn for eternity...Eternity
Burned in to ash...Condemned to burn for eternity. Infernal throne.
