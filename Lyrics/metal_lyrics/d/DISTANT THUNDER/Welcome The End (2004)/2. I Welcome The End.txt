A distant thunder cracks the sky
Theyâve run out of sands of time
Apocalyptic, catastrophic
Never seen by human eyes

[Pre-Chorus:]
They thought it would last forever
Whatâs called humanity
To try to love they could never
So ends the misery

Of my discoveries, there is no future
For these beings that thrive on war
Star ships aligning, targets in focus
Disintegrating, theyâll be no more

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Wipe the tears they cry
Let the darkness die
With open arms I welcome the end

In a flash, the world is ash
The colonies melt away
A world in flames
Themselves to blame
The suffering ends today

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
