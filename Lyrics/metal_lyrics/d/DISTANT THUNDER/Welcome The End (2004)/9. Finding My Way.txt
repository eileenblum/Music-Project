Waiting for whatâs brought tomorrow
Yesterday is a memory
The hours passing faster day-by-day
We linger on time thatâs borrowed
Searching the golden dream
Canât seem to find my way

[Pre-Chorus:]
Feeling no sadness
But feeling no gladness
Fighting for my life

[Chorus:]
Dreams of faith waiting
Nightmares that haunt fading
Finding my way through life

The mystery of existence
So many horizon scenes
Seeking for answers
Confusion burns inside
In twilight feeling persistence
Unknown force guiding me
Will this well of dreams run dry?

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
What is the essence of time?
Where it ends, do we want to know?
Our destinies have all been planned
But is it where we really want to go?
Living on borrowed time
Where the sun never shines
In the sea of madness
In dark waters we tread

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Outro]
Dreams will await
Nightmares will fade
Finding my way (twice)
Find your way, find your way
Fight your way through this life!
