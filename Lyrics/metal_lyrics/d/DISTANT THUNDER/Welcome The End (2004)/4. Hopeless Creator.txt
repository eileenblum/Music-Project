Looking down, what a disaster
Was it part of your intentions?
After all, you are the master
Of this chaos and its creation
Hurling up to the heavens, the cries of every nation
Turning the page, the book closed, final retaliation

Head in his hands, the timeâs at hand, heâll make a stand
So many tries, hopeless he sighs, gently he cries

[Pre-Chorus:]
The time has come to put an end to this charade
The mockery of what you planned, of what you made

[Chorus:]
Grieven by hateful crud, great animator
Saddened by spilling blood
Hopeless creator

Launch prepared, awaiting command
Warning ignored by masses
Masterpiece only sculpted by your hands
Into black, ashes to ashes
No faith, the final decision
Controlled, computerized life
No hope, attacks with precision
Turn back the hands of time

The timeâs at hand, he makes a stand and gives the command
Hopeless he sighs, softly he cries, brings their demise

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Looking, what a disaster
No part of your intentions
Show them you are the master
So ends civilization

Head in his hands, he made a stand and gave the command
So many tries, so many sighs, softly he cries

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Looking down, what a disaster
Was it part of your intentions?
After all, you are the master
of this chaos and its creation
Hurling up to the heavens,
the cries of every nation
Turning the page, the book closed,
final retaliation

Head in his hands, the timeâs at hand,
heâll make a stand
So many tries, hopeless he sighs,
gently he cries

The time has come to put an end to this charade
The mockery of what you planned,
of what you made

Grieven by hateful crud, great animator
Saddened by spilling blood
Hopeless creator

Launch prepared, awaiting command
Warning ignored by masses
Masterpiece only sculpted by your hands
Into black, ashes to ashes
No faith, the final decision
Controlled, computerized life
No hope, attacks with precision
Turn back the hands of time

The timeâs at hand, he makes a stand
and gives the command
Hopeless he sighs, softly he cries,
brings their demise

The time has come to put an end to this charade
The mockery of what you planned,
of what you made

Grieven by hateful crud, great animator
Saddened by spilling blood
Hopeless creator

Looking, what a disaster
No part of your intentions
Show them you are the master
So ends civilization

Head in his hands, he made a stand
and gave the command
So many tries, so many sighs, softly he cries

The time has come to put an end to this charade
The mockery of what you planned,
of what you made

Grieven by hateful crud, great animator
Saddened by spilling blood
Hopeless creator
