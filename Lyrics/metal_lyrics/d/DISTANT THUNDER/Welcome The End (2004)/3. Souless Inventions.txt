Endless wars engaging
Unstoppable eruption
On the brink of destruction

Blasphemy of all time
Mocking the great creator
Cloning killing machines, programmed eliminators
Bringing forth corruption
Deleting path of mankind
Machines run amok, digital minds

[Pre-Chorus:]
Man has crossed beyond forbidden zone
Heâs created life to call his own

[Chorus:]
Mindless, heartless creations have begun
Mindless, thoughtless, soulless inventions

Change the great master plan
Cyber world revolving
Computerized beings emotionless evolving
Legions march through the streets
Wiping out the divine
Annihilate the meek
A human decline

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

Out of control, no warning
Devastation in path
The price for blasphemy, man tasting his own wrath

[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
