Where the is fire, there is smoke, and in that smoke out comes the inevitable day of men's downfall. The day when they finally and self destructibly turn its weapons against its own kind. The day of the blade in the sky, when your cities lay buried under radioactive rubble, and the sea is a dead sea, and the land is a wasteland, in which there will be no place for humans, and that day is upon you, now!!!
