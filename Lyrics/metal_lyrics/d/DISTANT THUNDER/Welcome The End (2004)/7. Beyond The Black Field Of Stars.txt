Through space and time we travel
Through endless nights we soar
Passing the darkened horizons
Pitch-black mist
Eternal blackness surrounding
Starlight passing by
The universe everlasting what does exist

[Chorus:]
Far beyond the black field of stars
Through ancient voids, see who you are

Spiralling on through this dreamscape
Endless starlit black skies
A journey for a new sunlight glowing far
We see the lair of creator
Silhouettes of his domain
Empire of the great master
The burning star

[Chorus:]
Far beyond the black field of stars
Through ancient voids, see who you are
