The doom awakening foreseen light years ago
Punishment in flames approaching like a molten sky

[Pre-Chorus:]
Wrath in his eyes blazing
This burning god appears
The watcher out gazing
A distant thunder draws near

Creator of what was righteous awaits to make his stand
Targets the world with his anger, his hammer strikes down

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Vengeance burns within his eyes
Fire in the skies
[Repeat]

[Bridge:]
Across the sky his torching course
Such agony, blistering force
The flames engulf, fires collide
Burnt to a crisp, ashes remain

[Repeat chorus 2x]
