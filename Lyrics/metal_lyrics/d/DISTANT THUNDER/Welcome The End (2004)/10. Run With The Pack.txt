[originally by Helstar]Midnight, can you hear the wolves are howling?
No light but the evil ones are prowling
Pitch black and their wicked eyes are on you
They attack âcause thereâs nowhere they can find you

Swirling you round, taking you down
You are the chosen one
Youâre looking back, you left your track
So now you run with the pack

Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack

Screaming wind from the valley of the dead 
Theyâll win the soul from you of which they led
They lie, but you listen just the same
You cry, but thereâs no one else to blame

Swirling you round, taking you down
You are the chosen one
Youâre looking back, you left your track
So now you run with the pack

Run with the pack
Run with the pack
Run with the pack

Midnight, can you hear the wolves are howling?
No light but the evil ones are prowling
Pitch black and their wicked eyes are on you
They attack âcause thereâs nowhere they can find you

Swirling you round, taking you down
You are the chosen one
Youâre looking back, you left your track
So now you run with the pack

Nowhere to hide 
So run with pride
You run with me
You wonât be free 
Why donât you see itâs not a dream?
No turning back
Run with the pack
