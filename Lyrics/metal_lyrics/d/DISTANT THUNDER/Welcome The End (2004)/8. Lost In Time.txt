Hereâs a tale of lonely dreamers
A tale of hungry hearts
It stops to make you wonder
Just where you are

Let me speak these words of wisdom
Just say itâs nothing new
Thereâs a sea of drowning thinkers
The lonely few
That the dreams they had vanished into nowhere
All the borrowed time only took them somewhere
Without sight
Running blind

The dreams youâve cherished have vanished in thin air
All your hopes have perished so why should you care
Rainbows you were chasing have vanished away
Now you crawl through halls of darkness
The sadness in your eyes
The look of no tomorrow
You wore a false disguise wading in your sorrow
Sighing, walking down the street of broken dreams
Was it all it seemed?

[Chorus:]
Look at the sight you didnât see
Caught in the grey reality
The road to madness destiny
Lost in time

The borrowed time you wasted has you in despair
The simple life youâve tasted has always kept you there
Longing for a future, but never reaching out
Youâre lost without a doubt
