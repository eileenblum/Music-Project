In the land of the lost horizon where the queen lies dark and cold
And when the stars won't shine then the story's told yeah
When the world was milk and honey and the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knew oh oh that the chains were on that the chains were on
My my my in the land of no tomorrow where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand as it moves and whispers come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me and that's free but still your chains are on
Yes your chains are on still your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water you've seen flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness they had rainbows in their eyes
When the world was milk and honey and the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knew yeah that the chains were on 
That the chains were on that the chains were on that the chains were on
Oh my the chains were on in the land of the lost horizon where the chains are on 
In the land of milk and honey still the chains are on 
Where the queen lies dark and lonely still the chains are on 
And the world was low and magic but the chains were on 
The chains were on oh the chains were on yeah the chains were on oh the chains were on
Yeah the chains were on I've seen them walking on the water
Yeah the chains were on I've seen them flying through the sky
My the chains were on they were frightening in the darkness
Yes the chains were on they had rainbows in their eyes
