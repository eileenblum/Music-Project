Hide in the midnight turn out the lights you'll see them anyway
Sail into never they'll follow wherever you can go and take you to the places you don't know no no
It's the call of the city the way that black's pretty to the purest heart
It's places of pleasure they promise you treasure if you fly and then there goes the soul of you and I
Oh do you ever think about the way I caught the rainbow I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm gonna give you the look that opens up the skies I've got evil eyes evil eyes evil eyes evil eyes
Yes evil eyes oh those eyes
Hide in the night time turn out the light they'll see you anyway
Sail into never they'll follow wherever you can go evil eyes evil eyes evil eyes evil eyes 
Evil eyes evil eyes take your lies evil eyes you're a thin disguise for what you are evil eyes
Say that you never the'll follow forever 'cause they're evil eyes evil evil evil evil evil evil eyes
