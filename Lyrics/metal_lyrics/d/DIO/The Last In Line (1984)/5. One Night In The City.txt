Oh Johnny was a dark child he was promised to us all
But riders in the night can lift you out of sight when they call that's all
But Sally was a princess and she was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound of one night in the city one night looking pretty yeah
Then someone opened doorways and Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright where dark is always light but there's no day no way
The princess saw the dark child and the dark child said her name come steal away we'll play the game
Do you watch do you see do you know the people in me I'm the bite I'm the bark I'm the scream
I'm the poor I'm the sure I'm the holy I'm the pure I can tell you tales you just might not believe
One night in the city one night looking pretty one night in the city one night looking pretty
One night one night one night one night one night one night
Yeah the children shared the wonder of the leather and the lace
But one child went away and one child stayed to play for one night in the city
One night looking pretty yeah one night in the city one night touching pretty 
But chains don't make a wall and dreams lay where they fall
Dark is never night when dreams make up the light one night in the city
One night feeling pretty yeah one night in the city feeling pretty pretty pretty 
Pretty in the city one night in the city yeah one night one night one night one night
One night in the city one night one night oh one child went away
And one child stayed to play chains don't make a wall
Your dreams are made up where they fall one night in the city
