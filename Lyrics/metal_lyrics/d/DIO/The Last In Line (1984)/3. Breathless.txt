No no no no no no no
You said a single word but no one really heard sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night when darkness kills the light you're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart you know it's just the start
'cause you're breathless ready to burn breathless the circle still turns
Breathless willing to learn you're breathless yeah
Living inside your mind who knows the things you'll find there could be hell or rainbows
But it's a funny thing the more you feel the sting you're just a leaf that the wind blows
You've been this way before one step and you're through the door
And you're breathless ready to burn breathless the circle still turns
Breathless you're willing to learn you're breathless yeah alright
Yeah you said a single word but no one really heard sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night when darkness kills the light you're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart you know it's just the start
'cause you're breathless ready to burn breathless the circle still turns
Breathless willing to learn you're breathless yeah
When you're breathless alone in the night breathless but you fear and you're right
Breathless ready to burn you're breathless 
You said a single word no one really heard 
It's always worse at night 'cause when the darkness kills the light 
Then you're breathless yeah you're breathless ready to burn
Breathless you're willing to learn breathless oh the circle still turns 
You're breathless breathless come you're breathless
