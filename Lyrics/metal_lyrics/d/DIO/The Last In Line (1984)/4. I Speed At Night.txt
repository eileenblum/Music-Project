Alright dark touches send rushed through the brain black's whiter burns brighter than the flame
No shadows just whispers in the wind no faces just places to begin
I just come seeking pleasure I hate the light I speed at night at night at night alright
My demons they seem to disappear no vision I only see to hear
Protection I never needed none direction just nowhere near the sun
You've got some stairs to heaven you may be right
I only know in my world I hate the light I speed at night 
I speed at night I speed at night I speed at night alright
Dark touches send rushed through the brain black's whiter burns brighter than the flame
No shadows just whispers in the wind no faces just places to begin
You've got some stairs to heaven you may be right
I only know in my world I hate the light I speed at night
I speed at night I speed at night I speed at night yeah
I speed at night night night night night I speed at night night night night night 
No shadows no faces just whispers in dark places
I speed at night I speed at night I speed at night I speed at night alright
