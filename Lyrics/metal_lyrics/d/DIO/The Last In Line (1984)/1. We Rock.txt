You watch their faces you'll see the traces of the things they want to be but only we can see
They come for killing they leave and still it seems the cloud that's left behind oh can penetrate your mind
But sail on sing a song carry on 'cause we rock we rock we rock we rock
We pray to someone but when it's said and done it's really all the same with just a different name
So many voices all giving choices if we listen they will say oh we can find the way
But we'll sail on sing a song carry on 'cause we rock we rock we rock we rock
We rock we rock we rock we rock we rock we rock
You watch their faces you'll see the traces of the things they want to be but only we can see
They come for killing they leave and still it seems the cloud that's left behind  can penetrate your mind
But sail on sing a song carry on 'cause we rock we rock we rock we rock
We rock we rock we rock we rock ride out stand and shout carry on sail on sing your song carry on
'cause we rock we rock see how we rock we rock that's rock we rock we rock we rock
