Well it's a long hot road I've been upon through the desert of your soul
I've looked high and low for water but it's not there no no
And all the promises of springtime turned to lies so cold
But I'm stronger than you know and I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out you've been a bad bad girl you've been hungry all of your life so eat it out
I've been a prisoner just locked away inside your velvet jail
It don't matter at all some things can grow without the light alright
Spinning cages for her pleasure weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer all on fire and then he dies
Eat your heart out you've been a bad bad girl you've been hungry all of your life yeah
We speed across emotions and then we lose our hold
We turn on wings of passion that we can't control no
And all the promises of springtime turned to lies so cold
But I'm stronger than you know and I've come to let you go
Go eat your heart out you've been a bad bad girl you've been hungry all of your life so eat your heart out 
Eat your heart out you've been a bad bad girl you've been hungry all of your life so eat it out
Eat your heart out run to the shadows of night eat your heart out
Spinning cages for her pleasure weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailer all on fire and then he dies then he dies
