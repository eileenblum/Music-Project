Yes!
The best steel goes through the fire
And you seem to burn
The dead man's always a liar
Look out! There's another one learning!
Too late for tomorrow
There's only today
So take your magic carpet ride

Ooh
Hide in the rainbow
Hide in the rainbow

Ooh
The last one out of thunder
He will always survive
But if you are starting to wonder
No no, you can never surrender
You see through the mystery
And now you can fly
So take your magic carpet ride

Ooh
Hide in the rainbow
Ooh - to hide - yeah
Hide in the rainbow

You hide in the rainbow
Ride to the sun - yeah!
Now the best steel goes through the fire
And you seem to burn
The dead man's always a liar
Look out! there's another one learning!
Ooh - ooh
You got to hide in the rainbow
Oooh - oooh - oooh
Hide in the rainbow
