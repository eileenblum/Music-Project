And then the dark, the dark...

I've been way beyond your universe
And I've seen things that I should never tell
But here I go again I just can't keep it to myself
The story of my world and how I fell

Round and round
The square inside the circle
And still I shake the same
At the rhythm of her name

Electra
Electra

I believed in love and miracles
So how can I be blamed for what I've done?
And if it's still a sin to hide the best parts for yourself
Then I have sinned but only just begun

There's no thunder, no lightning
Just a gentle breeze
To warn you that something
Will bring you to your knees

Round and round
You're caught inside the circle
Still I shake the same
At the mention of her name

Electra
Electra

Hey, I've been way beyond your universe
And I've come back to introduce to you
The fear of the heart, just try to keep it from yourself
And it will be the last thing that you'll do

Round and round
You're caught inside a circle
And you will shake the same
At the magic of her name

Electra
Electra

I am here to show my changes
Not to change what I've become, no, no
I'm not alone and she will testify
That it's the best thing that I've done, oh, oh, for

Electra
Electra
