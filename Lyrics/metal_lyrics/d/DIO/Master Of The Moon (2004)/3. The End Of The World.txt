If I could sleep at night
Then somehow I'd see
Why everything's wrong
Or maybe it's just me
Does anybody know this place that I'm in
Why I might be alone
Imagination is a terrible thing
What if I'm wrong
But here's what I've been thinking
It must be the end of the world

What ever happened to the rock and roll song
Breaking your brain
Making you stronger
They say you never hear the bullet that kills
And I don't hear a sound

It's not about a change or revolution
What's gone today is still called substitution

Don't get emotional but we're out of time
The melody's gone
And fools have got the sunshine
If I'm mistaken and I see you again
Don't leave me alone
Maybe tomorrow
Could be the end of the world

Don't make wishes
Don't waste time
Call the ones you hate
You'd say I'm sorry but they'll have to wait
Fot the end of the world
Bye bye bye bye bye bye
