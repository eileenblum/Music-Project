Help me - save me
I've just crossed the line
Where reason might betray me
Wake me - shake me
Send a message to my brain
Before they take me
How can I get through to you
That wishes just come true
In dreams

Don't go - don't dare
Cause the journey drives you made
Before you get there
Help me - save me
I'll be glad to give you back
The hand you gave me
How can I get through to you
That wishes do come true
In dreams

If I'm a river - then you're the sea
Somewhere you'll find me
Alone and swimming here in ecstasy

If I am silence - you must be scream
But I don't hear you
I'm in a place that I've just never seen before

Don't go - you'll never save me
I've just slapped away
That helping hand you gave me
Don't wake me - Don't shake me
Here's a message from my brain
You'll never take me
How can I get through to you
That wishes do come true in dreams
In my dreams
