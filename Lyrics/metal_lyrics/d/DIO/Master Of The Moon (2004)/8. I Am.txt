I think I'm through with just pretending
Knocking at a door
That I've been through before
Congratulations - at last you've seen my light
Now it's you against the night

I think I'm never coming after - after all
Now I've become the cat
Who always lets you know that

I Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am - stronger without you
I Am

For all the words gone unspoken
Silence isn't gold
Or the story's never told
Investigation - at last I've found my light
And we shine

So now I'm like the cat
Who always tells you this that

I Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am better without you
I Am

I think I'm way outside illusion
Breaking down the door
That locked me in before
Congratulations - now that you've see my light - after all

And when I become the cat
I'll always let you know that

I Am I Am - stronger than the wind
I Am I Am sin
I Am I Am - stronger without you
I Am

I Am I Am - brighter than the sun
I Am I Am everyone
I Am I Am - better without you
I Am

I Am I Am - stronger than before
I Am I Am more
I Am I Am - ready to go on
I Am
