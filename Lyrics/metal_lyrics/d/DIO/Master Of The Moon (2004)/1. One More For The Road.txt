Well I've never been here before
But I'm coming back tomorrow
For the real pain - a cold rain again

Nice day for a crucifixion
Heard a new prediction
That we can all be saved - so I'll have

One more for the road - play it again
One more for the road

Never heard this before
That a child can tell who's evil
But it's a good thing if we sing along

Cold day - we can make a fire
Burn another liar
Can witches ever die - hey let's burn

One more for the road - gimme the same again
One more for the road

Well I've never been here before
And the room is really empty
But there's a big line waiting for the show
Nice day for an execution
Another wrong conclusion
But someone's got to pay - so let's burn

One more for the road - same again
One more for the road

There's a child who just sees evil
And a man who just loves pain
But I've heard that we can't save them
So gimme me the same again

There's a cross that you can't carry
Cause it's heavier than hell
And if you should meet your maker
Just pray that he won't yell
One more for the road

One more for the road
One more for the road
One more for the road
