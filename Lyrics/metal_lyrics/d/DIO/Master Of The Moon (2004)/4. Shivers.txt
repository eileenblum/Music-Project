Fingers scratching blackboards
Make cowards of the brave
A natural reaction
From the cradle to the grave

Rats and bats and spiders
And little things that crawl
Never make me tremble
I'm bothered not at all

Then I saw you
Something new inside of me
What's this shakin'
You made me shiver

Cemetery midnights
Walking on the dead
Never seemed to matter
It's all inside your head

Names are only letters
Mentioned on a stone
And If you're going somewhere
You're going it alone

Then I saw you
Something new inside of me
What's this shakin'
You made me shiver

Magic charms and voodoo
And all those other spells
Didn't make impressions
I never slept so well

If I had a nightmare
I'm sure that I would know
I really don't remember
But I'm sure it isn't so

Then I saw you
Something new inside of me
What's this shakin'

Turn out the lights it won't matter
A bucket of blood and I'm still fine
A black cat's only a color
But you can do it any time
