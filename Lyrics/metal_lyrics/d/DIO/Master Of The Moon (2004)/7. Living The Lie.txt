When a milion miles from no where
Is still too close to home
You're with a hundred thousand people
And you still feel all alone

She was never in the circle
Or the round would be a square
And the more she seemed to want it
The less they seemed to care

Sold out and no admission
Too late to buy
It's never who it's only why
She's living the lie

When you're on your way to somewhere
But the elevator falls
Do you look for stairs to heaven
Or wander through the halls

He was only dedicated
To the ones who make the law
But they burned with too much fire
And his heart was made of straw

No ticket - no admission
Too late to buy
It's always he and he knows why
He's living the lie

Break down
How bad do you want it
How far will you go

If you're looking at tomorrow
To forget about today
Then the past will be your future
And it's there you'll always stay

What about the pictures
That smile from magazines
The ultimate temptation
Our new kings and all our queens

Such heat and too much pressure
Not worth the try
No more for them
Now it's I
And no more living the lie
Living the lie
Oh why
Live the lie
