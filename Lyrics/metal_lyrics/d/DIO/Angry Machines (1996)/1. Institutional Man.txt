Inside the walls I've made
To keep out all who reach for me
I might have lost my way
And I can't come out again

Don't come around here anymore
You may infect yourself
Don't ever cross this line
You could see monsters in your mind
There just like me

Have I erased all sense of touch
I don't feel anything
Sometimes they say I need
Sometimes I think I need
Sometimes I know I need
New parts for my brain

Most dreams, they're black and white
But I must color mine
Each day's another end
Less night of screaming
Shouting at the outside
Someone let me in

Set me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Stop the water, bags of sand
Institutional man

Sometimes they say I need
Sometimes I think I need
Sometimes I know I need
New parts for my brain

Set me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Lock the cages, tie my hands
Institutional, institutional man
