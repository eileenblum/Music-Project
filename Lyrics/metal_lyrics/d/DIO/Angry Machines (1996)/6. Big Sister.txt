Who controls your mind

There have been changes
No more giving it all for free
There will be changes
Now woman is all you need
A-ah

Here is a number
You've been given an another name
We will be watching
One might fall but you'll all be blamed
Shame, shame

Here's big sister
We're big sister
Hear big sister
There's big sister
Dancing on your grave

Who controls your mind
Who's in charge of hearts
Who controls you time
We're in charge of you

There have been changes
Even mother's a soldier now
There have been changes
You can touch 'cause you don't know how
No

Here's big sister
We're big sister
Hear big sister
There's big sister
Dancing on your grave

Pretty faces, young and clean
Watching you from magazines
All they want is something more
Kill the king and then we'll crown the whore

Here's big sister
We're big sister
Hear big sister
There's big sister

Who controls your mind
In charge of hearts
Controls your time
In charge of you

Here's big sister
We're big sister
Control
