Hush now children - lullaby
Steal what you can't borrow
Oh how brave you are
And your world has
Come so far

Are you saved
Have you been told
Right is the enemy
Too bad, too late

Write this down
(I) don't believe in sanity ???
Or reading the instructions
Throw 'em all away, hey

Golden rules, Sunday school
Crazy

Wheels go round
Angry machines, designing your destiny
Digital dreams, with no heart, no soul

Golden rules, Sunday school
You're all crazy now

Here's the situation
The rest are gettin' pretty
You're melting in the city

Father says to mother
Yeah, if you really wanna trash it
Go ahead and smash it

Are you saved
Now when you go to sleep tonight
One way or another
If you don't die before you wake
Do it unto others

Golden rules, made more fools
Sunday school, you're all crazy

Hush now children
Don't you cry
We've just killed tomorrow
How sad you are
That your world has gone too far
