All you see down there
Could be yours for the taking
All your heart's desired
Would be yours but you don't want it
You don't want it
You keep telling me

Stay out of my mind
Stay out of my soul
I can't get you out of my life
So stay out of my mind
Stay out of my mind, yeah

What do you want from life
What do you keep living for
Is it worth the price
It'll cost you nothing
But you won't take it
You won't take it
You keep telling me

Stay out of my mind
Stay out of my soul
I can't get you out of my life
So stay out of my mind
Stay out of my mind

Stay out of my mind
Stay out of my soul
I can't get you out of my life
So stay out of my mind
Stay out of my mind
