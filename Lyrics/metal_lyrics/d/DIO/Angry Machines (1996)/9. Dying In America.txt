Once upon a high
The streets were gold and blue was
In the sky riders gone
Never could belong
Maybe you still can dream
Sleep through screams
While we're dying in America

Once upon a child
The carnival would stop and stay a-
While you were gone
Everything went wrong
Too soon, cartoon
Dying in America
Dying in America

In places where aces outnumber the queens
Jack is afraid of tomorrow
Colors are changing to red, white and green
As we all fall down

Once upon a hate
They told us they could fix it if we'd
Wait for awhile
Killing you with smiles
Maybe you still can dream
Sleep through screams
While we're dying in America
Dying in America

Sex, sex, sex
Even bigger, even better
Don't lose out, be a winner
Save more, save time and save now
One hundred thirty per cent American people
Would like to be like everyone else
