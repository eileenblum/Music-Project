[Japanese CD only]

One more nightmare
No place like home
You see a picture of angels
I see a nail in the wall

Make him over
No time to lose

And if you've heard this one before
Don't stop me
Don't stop me

We learn slowly
Evil's in the holy
Incidental
God hates heavy metal
So I know he must hate me

Lazy-crazy
Must be my name
Why are you running to nowhere
Why do you listen to noise

So if you've heard this all before
Please stop me
Please stop me

Live don't preach it
If you can't don't teach it
Accidental
God loves heavy metal
So I know he must want me

We learn slowly
Mind control is holy
Stir don't shake it
Move too fast you'll break it up
Incidental
God is heavy metal
So I know he must need me
