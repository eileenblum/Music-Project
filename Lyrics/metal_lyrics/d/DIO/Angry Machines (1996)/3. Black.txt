Identify the real world
Investigate the real world
Intensify inspection
There for all to see

Here's what lies do
All things turn to
Black, black
Yeah, no

Now desensitize your heartbeat
Regulate the heartbeat
Sterilize all emotion
Justify your needs

Here's what love does
Dies and fades to
Black, black

There are no champions
Who saves the lonely ones
In the corner

Black, yeah
Black

You must identify
You and the real world
Interrogate the new real world
Then generate intention
Information, please

Here's what i know
Soon we'll all go
We must fade to
Black
