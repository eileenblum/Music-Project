When you're alone and the sun's gone down
One more time
Must you prentend that some light still shines
Sounds like double Monday
Yeah

Each time you think that you've just begun
It's the end
Oh, someone you love wants to just be friends
Sounds like double Monday
Yeah

Feels like snakes and spiders
Crawling up your body
Every someday double Monday

Like a fly against the wall
Just when you think you've seen it all you
You lose your special place to hide
So get ready for the ride, ride, ride
Yeah

Every someday double Monday
