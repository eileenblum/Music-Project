The old ones speak of winter
The young ones praise the sun
And time just slips away

Running into nowhere
Turning like a wheel
And a year becomes a day

Whenever you dream
That's when you fly
So here is a dream
For just you and I

We'll find the Sacred Heart
Somewhere bleeding in the night
Look to the light
Got to find the Sacred Heart

Here we see the wizard
Staring through the glass
And he's looking right at you

You can see tomorrow
The answer and the lie
And the things you've got to do

Find the Sacred Heart
Look to the light

Oh, sometimes you never fall
And ah - You're the lucky one
But oh - Sometimes you want it all
You've got to reach for the sun

And find the Sacred Heart
itâs Somewhere bleeding in the night
Oh look out for the light, the light

Find the Sacred Heart
Itâs bleeding in the night

You fight to kill the dragon
And bargain with the beast
Then you sail into a sight

You run along the rainbow
But you never leave the ground
Still you don't know why

Whenever you dream
You're holding the key
It opens the door
To let you be free

And find the Sacred Heart
itâs somewhere bleeding in the night
Look tor the light
Got to find the Sacred Heart

Run along the rainbow
Before it turns to black

Attack

Youâre the last in
Youâre the last in
Youâre the last in
Youâre the last in
You got to reach for the sun

Youâve got to find the Sacred Heart
