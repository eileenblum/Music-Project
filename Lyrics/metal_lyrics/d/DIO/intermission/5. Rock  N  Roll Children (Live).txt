Rock and roll

It was starting to rain
On the night that they first decided
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they ran away
They were found in the dark
But they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door â bang!

She was meant to be wild
He was nearly a child
But they only could feel each other
They were paper and fire
Angel and liar
The devil of one another

Then they were thrown to the ground
With a terrible sound
Just like somebody slammed a heart

Rock 'N' Roll Children
Alone again
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Without a friend
But you got Rock 'N' Roll

You got Rock and Roll

All right, Rock And Roll

At the end of a dream
If you know what I mean
When the mist just starts to clear
In a similar way
At the end of the day
I can feel the sound of writing on the wall
It cries for you
Itâs the least that you can do
Like a spiral thatâs on the wind
I can hear it screaming in the air

Long live Rock and Roll
Long live Rock ânâ Roll
Long live Rock and Roll
Long live Rock ânâ Roll
Yes, Rock ânâ Roll

Long live Rock and Roll
Long live Rock ânâ Roll
Long live Rock and Roll
Long live Rock ânâ Roll

I'm a wheel, a wheel
I can roll, I can feel
And you can't stop me turning
I'm the sun, the sun
I can move, I can run
You'll never stop me burning

Get down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me holy again

I'm the man on the silver mountain
The man on the silver mountain

Get down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me, make me holy again

The man on the silver mountain
The man on the silver mountain
In the man on the mountain
The man on the silver mountain

Well, Iâm the man, Iâm the man, Iâm the man
Iâll give my hand, Iâll give you my hand
Give you my hand, Iâll give you my hand, Iâll give you my hand
And for you; hereâs my hand
Together we will fly, together weâll fly, weâll fly, fly, fly
Just you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Weâll go way.... to the mountain
Youâre the man, youâre the man, youâre all the man
Weâre all, weâre all, weâre all, weâre all the man

It was starting to rain
On the night that they cried forever
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they screamed goodbye
They were lost in the dark
And they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door â bang!

Alone again
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Without a friend

It was starting to rain
On the night that they met
It was blinding with snow
On the night we let them go, go, go, go
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Alone again
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Without a friend
But you got Rock ânâ Roll

Long live Rock ânâ Roll
Long live Rock ânâ Roll
Long live Rock ânâ Roll
