Hot night - summer in the city
Just about to smoke and burn
Look out - he's evil but he's pretty
And oh he's gonna twist and turn

He's got the midnight madness
He's got control
He's the King of Rock and Roll

Bad blood - everybody knows it
But everybody doesn't care
He's got the only way to show it
They want to see it everywhere

He's gonna give you fever
He'll scratch your soul
'Cos he's the King of Rock and Roll
The King of Rock and Roll

Bad boy - always on the cover
Gettin' the story told
Fast, fast - one way or another
Cause he'll never never never never never get old

He's got the midnight madness
He's got control
He's the King of Rock and Roll
He's gonna give you fever
He'll scratch your soul
You are the King of Rock and Roll

Rock and Roll
Rock and Roll
Rock and Roll
Rock and Roll

He's the King of Rock and Roll

Yeeeeeeeeeeees
