The Rainbow in the Dark

When there's lightning â you know it always bring me down
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic â see it floating in the light
It was cold - lost my hold
To the shadows of the night

No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow in the Dark
Just a Rainbow in the Dark

Do your demons â well, do they ever let you go
When you've tried - do they hide - deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture - just an image caught in time
We're a lie - you and I
We're words without a rhyme

No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow in the Dark
Just a Rainbow in the Dark

When I see lightning â you know it always brings me down
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic - feel it dancing in the air
But it's fear - and you'll hear
It calling you beware

No sign of the morning coming
No sight of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow
Just a Rainbow in the Dark
Youâre a Rainbow in the Dark
Just a Rainbow in the Dark
A Rainbow in the Dark
No sign of the morning
Youâre a Rainbow in the Dark

I see youâre all, youâre all, youâre all a Rainbow
Youâre a Rainbow in the Dark

Thank you
Thank you
Good night
