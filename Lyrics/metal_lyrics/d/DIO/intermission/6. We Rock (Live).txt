For you this song is called WE ROCK

You watch their faces
And you'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see

They come for killing
They leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Just penetrates your mind

Sail on, sing a song, carry on
Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock

We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same
Just got a different name

Too many voices
All giving choices
If we listen they will say
We can find the way

Sail on, sing a song, carry on
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock!

We Rock, We Rock, We Rock

Watch their faces
You'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see

They come for killing
They leave but still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Just penetrates your mind

Sail on, sing a song, carry on
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock

Ride out - stand and shout - carry on
Sail on - sing your song - carry on

We Rock
What do you do?
We Rock
We Rock
We Rock

We Rock
We Rock
We Rock
You Rock
You Rock
You Rock
We Rock

Thank you
Thank you
We love you
Goodnight
