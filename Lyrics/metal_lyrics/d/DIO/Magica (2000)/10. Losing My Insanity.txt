Someone said
You'll light up the universe
It's there in your head then
Crazy comes to call

Break me down
I'm only an everyone
Running from free
Running from me

And though it's not of my choosing
I'm losing my insanity
Again

Someone said
Forever was yesterday
So open your head when
Crazy comes around

Break me down
I'm only an innocent
Howl at the moon
Knowing that soon

And though it's always confusing
I'm losing my insanity

Round and round
Like the wheels in my mind
Round and round and down and down and down
And down and down

Someone said
Believe in your otherside
It's there in your head and
Waiting for a ride

Break me down
Ah once I was everything
Breaking the law
Quick on the draw

And though it's not of my choosing
I'm losing my insanity
Again
