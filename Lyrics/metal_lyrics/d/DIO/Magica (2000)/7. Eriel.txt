Now that my dreams have gone dead
I see them burning in the fire
Just like the words that I've said
Ashes turned to ashes once again

Look for a sign in the air
A light that dances in the sky
Maybe you'll see it somewhere
Oh, shining like a diamond
Promising that hope will never die

I might know the answer
Well, it's back there in my brain
Someday soon I'll be rising again
Higher than the sun

I have been father and son
I cry for children of the night
Just because tears have begun
Beware of quiet voices
Thunder comes from silence - I am light

Oh, look for a sign, is it me
No don't believe with only eyes
Speak to the blind 'cause they see
Truth is just a circle
Spinning round until it meets the lies
Then dies
