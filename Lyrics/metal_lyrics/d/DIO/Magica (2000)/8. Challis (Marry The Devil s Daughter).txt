I am a rock
And you are glass
Never broken - never last
And if you're in my way I'll knock you down

If it's a joke
I'll never laugh
Here's exactly how I see you in the light

You're like a tear in the ocean
Dust in the wind
Like a stone in the water
I'm gonna sleep with the devil's daughter

I am your shock
I am your shame
Another face without a name
And if you think I'm angry just come over

I need to tell
Just who you are
My description of the world I've seen so far

You're like a tear in the ocean
Dust in the wind
Like a stone in the water
I might marry the devil's daughter

I am a rock
And you are glass
If it's a joke
Nobody laugh
And even - When you know you're guilty still you're right

You're like a tear in the ocean
Dust in the wind
Like a stone in the water

Like a spark in the fire
Dust in the sand
Like a stone in the water
I'm gonna run with the devil's daughter
Run, run, run, run, run away!

Require, explanation. What is love? 
Who is love? When is love? Where is love? Why is love?
