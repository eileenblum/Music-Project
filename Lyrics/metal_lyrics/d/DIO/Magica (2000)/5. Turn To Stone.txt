Welcome to sun down, welcome to the dark
Could it be that evil has heroes

Bring everybody down - Celebration
Passing of the light
Giving up your spirit to the night

You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone
Just for ever
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone

Here comes a fire
We'll burn it to the ground
Inside the page lies the power

We've turned it all around - Celebration
Words have control
To take away your heart and then your soul

You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone
Just for ever
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone

Oh pray for a miracle
But the wishes in the well have all gone dry
There's no way for a miracle
It's not the way you live, it's how you'll die

Welcome to sun down - Welcome to the dark
Could it be that the evil has heroes

We've turned it all around - Celebration
Words have control
To take away your heart and then your soul

You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone
Just for ever
You'll turn to stone
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone

Concerning the inhabitants of Otherworld.
There are many similarities to be found, parallel to our own society.
The individual must be absorbed. The collective must be as one. Feed my head!
