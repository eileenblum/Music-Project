From the first time we touched with our eyes
Only magic could take away my heart
I am always afraid for my heart
So lay beside me now and tell me lies - sweet lies
As long as it's not about love

Shall we sail off the edge of the world
Fall forever and never look behind
But I must keep my heart from my mind
Lay beside me now and tell me lies
As long as it's not about love

Oh the last time we touched with our eyes
And the magic was stronger than the heart
Oh, I can't run away with my heart
So, lay beside me now and tell me lies
As long as it's not about love

Shall we sail off the edge of the world
Fall forever
Take my heart away but no
You can't say words about love
Ooh

If the magic comes between us
And we never meet again
Take a part of me away
'Cause maybe it's all above love
Love, ooh
