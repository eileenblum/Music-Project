I love the night
So many shadows
Unholy light
Putting out the spark
Leave 'em in the dark - forever
Ooh

I can wait for you
Your end is my life
All lies are true
Secrets of the heart
And you can take them all - To heaven

I don't feel pain or sorrow
The child's a man tomorrow
Crossing the line - Then he's mine

Don't care which god you follow
Whose promises you swallow
Time and again
We must meet at the end
Aaah

It's all right
When the music is over
Come on and dance
For the lord of the last day

I love the night
So many shadows
Unholy light
Secrets of the heart
Leave 'em in the dark
Forever
