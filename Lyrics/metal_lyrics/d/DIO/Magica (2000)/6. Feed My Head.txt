Hiding in a corner
Waiting for the storm
Maybe they'll forget about me
Avoid connection
Still they say you always surrender

All the smiling faces
Promising the sun
Another way of breaking you down

All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my head

Hope is gone
The spell's been said
Fill my mind
Feed my head

Ah
Waiting for my number
To climb upon the cross
Maybe they'll forget about me
Must avoid detection
But they say you'll still go down

Safe in dreams
Away from where they are
Let me be nowhere
Just another star

Safe in night
The shadows cloak their eyes
Take me to nowhere
Where everybody flies
Oh!

All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my head

Hope is gone
The spell's been said
Fill my mind
Feed my head

All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my head

Hope is gone
The spell's been said
Fill my mind
Feed my head

All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my head

Hope is gone
The spell's been said
Fill my mind
Feed my head

All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my head
