Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
it looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it
I never heard it all

Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
and they all know what you feel

And here it comes again
straight through the heart
straight through the heart

Oh, never tell a secret
with your eyes
it's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
it's the only way I've found
Oh, here it comes again
straight through the heart
straight through the heart

Shout to the wind
how can you hurt me this way
Oh, once it begins
it looks like it's coming to stay

[x2]
Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
it looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it
I never heard it all

in the middle of the heart
No, don't stand still
they'll get you right through your heart
here it comes
here it comes again
straight through the heart
