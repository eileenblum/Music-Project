When there's lightning
You know it always bring me down
'Cause it's free
And I see
That it's me who's lost and never found

I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold,
Lost my hold
To the shadows of the night

No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark

Do your demons,
Do they ever let you go?
When you've tried
Do they hide
Deep inside. Is it someone that you know?

You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I
We're words without a rhyme

There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark yeah

[Solo]

When i see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free
And I see
That it's me who's lost and never found

Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear
And you'll hear
It callingâyou bewareâlook out

There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah yeah you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark whoa oh oh
