Yeah gypsy

She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white

Well, I was on the free, just me and me
And just about to sail
When I heard the voice saying
You've got a choice
The hammer or the nail

You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
I'm a gypsy

Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
But need to have a little sin

So I'm ridin'
Well, I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen

[Solo]

Well, she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'cause you were blinded by her light
And so she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right

So I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin',
Yes, I'm ridin' on, on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean
