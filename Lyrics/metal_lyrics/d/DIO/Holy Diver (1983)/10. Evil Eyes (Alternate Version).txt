[2012 Deluxe Bonus Track]Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go
And places that you never never know, no, no, uh

It's the call of the city
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart
There's places of pleasure
They promise you treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I

Oh do you ever think about the way I caught the rainbow?
I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm going to give you the look that opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes

Yes, evil eyes
Ooh those eyes

Uh, hide in the night time
Turn out the lights, you see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go

Oh, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Evil eyes, evil eyes
Protect your lies, evil eyes
You're a thin disguise for what you are, your evil eyes, eyes

Sail into never
They'll follow forever
'Cause they're evil eyes ( eyes)
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil eyes, oh, they're evil eyes, just evil eyes....
