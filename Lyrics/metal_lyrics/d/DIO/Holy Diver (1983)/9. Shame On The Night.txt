Shame on the night
for places I've been and what I've seen
for giving me the strangest dreams
But you never let me know just what they mean
so oh oh so shame on the night alright
And shame on you

you've stolen the day
snatched it away
but I saw the sky and I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I say oh shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
so I think I'd better run
Shame on the sun

for the light you sold
I've lost my hold
on the magic flame
but now I know your name

Oh lord just go the way you came
again oh oh oh
shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
so I know I'd better run

Shame on the night
for places I've been and what I've seen
for giving me the strangest dreams
You never never never know just what they mean
and oh oh so shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
here I go... I've got to run

Shame on the night
shame shame on you
Shame on the dream
shame on the sun and you
shame on the night

When I lost my hold
on the magic flame
but now I know your name

Shame on the night
shame on you
shame on all of you
shame on the night
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
