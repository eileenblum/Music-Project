[2012 Deluxe Bonus Track]well, hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
it looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it
I never heard it all

Living in a world of make believe
you can hide behind what's real
wearing your emotions on your sleeve
and they all know what, what you feel, yeah

And here it comes again
straight through the heart, no no
right through the heart

Oh, never tell a secret
with your eyes
it's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
it's the only way I've found
Oh, here it comes again
right through your heart
right in your heart

Shout to the wind
how can you hurt me this way
Oh, once it begins
it looks like it's coming to stay
Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
it looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it
I never heard it all, yeah

here it comes again well, straight through your heart
right through your heart. right in your heart yeah
Shout to the wind
how can you hurt me this way
Oh, once it begins
here it comes again right through your heart, right through your heart
no, don't stand still, they will get you, right through your heart.
here it comes again, here it comes again
right in your heart.
