Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know ooh ooh
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow

You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while it can

I walk along the bloody road
Like the hero who never ends

You'll feel it,
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all
Oh ooh oh oh oh oh

Flying away in the clouds
You're no more losing your control ooh
And finding your way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul

You'll feel it,
You'll see it,
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
I feel it,
I see it in your eyes

You're caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know ooh ooh
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river of nowhere send you flow

You can feel it
You can see it
You'll know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes

You're caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again

Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle

You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You're feeling caught in the middle
