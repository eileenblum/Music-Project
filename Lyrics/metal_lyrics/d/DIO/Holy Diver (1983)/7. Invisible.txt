If your circle stays unbroken
then you're a lucky man
'cause it never, never, never has for me
In the palace of the virgin
lies the chalice of the soul
and it's likely you might find the answer there

She had thirteen years of teenage tears
never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
she saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
a smile inside a frown
And then the light
the answer right inside her coming down
She said
I can go away I can leave here
I can be invisible
I'll go away

He was just eighteen and in between
a lady and a man
His daddy's girl in momma's world
that was when he ran
you know the word "confused" has been abused
but that's just what he was
And in the spark inside the dark
the answer came to call it said,

You can go away
you can leave here
you can be be be invisible

Well, I grew up quick and I felt the kick of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and took a fast look
at just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
from the two that came before
The only way to really stay
is to walk right out the door
So you can go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible and go away again
I can go away when I leave here
I can be invisible
I said when I've gone away
lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just became invisible
I went away,
I disappeared before your eyes.
You never touch me you never feel me
you'll never see me again
because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
we're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
to be invisible
to go away
