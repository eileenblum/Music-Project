There's perfect harmony in the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness hunted by the lion and the lamb ah ah ah ah
We bring you fantasy we bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle or we will disappear never to be seen again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away sailed away
We bring you beautiful we teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe or we will disappear never to return again
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away they sailed away sailed away
And as we drift along I never fail to be astounded by the things we'll do for promises and a song
We are the innocent we cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle and a miracle is something you need
They'll take your diamonds and then give you steel
You'll be caught in the middle of the madness just lost like them and part of all the pain that they feel yeah
And all the fools sailed away all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away leaving nothing nothing more to say all the fools sailed away
They say you're beautiful and they'll always let you in
But doors are never open to the child without a trace of sin sail away
