The night has a thousand eyes but he moves in only places where the eyes can never be
The night tells a thousand lies and when you wake up in the morning were you dreaming screaming
Tryin' to hide your burnin' heart before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman
Somebody start the game and the dark will just get louder as it shouts away the light
A shadow without a name but when he wakes up in the morning he just won't know was he a hero
Tryin to hide his burning heart before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman anybody can sunset superman
The night has a thousand eyes but he moves in only places where the eyes can never be
The night tells a thousand lies and when you wake up in the morning were you dreaming screaming
Tryin' to hide your broken heart before somebody cuts it all away
Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman
Sunset superman sunset superman superman oh oh oh
Sunset superman sunset superman sunset superman oh oh oh
Anybody can anybody can sunset superman oh oh oh 
Sunset superman sunset superman superman oh oh oh
