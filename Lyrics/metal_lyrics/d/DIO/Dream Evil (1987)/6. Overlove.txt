Seems like heard this song at least a thousand times before 
He just wanted her but she wants more so build a wall keep it all to herself oh oh
Always never seemed to be too much reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains sad remains another victim of overlove overlove
He was just the devil in a thing disquise jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page close the cage on another victim of overlove
Overlove yeah overlove overlove overlove overlove
Mamma never left her baby all alone baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone and come the dawn you got another victim of overlove
Overlove overlove overlove love love love love overlove
