Give me shelter shelter I can face the day then I'll just fade away give me shelter give me shelter
Sleep comes slowly the fire starts to die you open up your eyes 
Faces in the window noises in the night
Faces in the window hiding from the light faces in the window
We are evil and we are all divine creations of the mind we are pleasure
I see clearly who's behind the wall yes I can see us all
We're faces in the window noises in the night
Faces in the window hiding from the light faces in the window
Give me shelter shelter shelter give me shelter shelter shelter
Faces in the window noises in the night faces in the window hiding from the light
Faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window
When the fire starts to die and you open up your eyes there they are in the window faces in the window
We are evil and divine just creations of the mind and faces in the window faces in the window
Faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window faces in the window
