Two faces on fire no traces something has swallowed the night you know that nothing can make it all right yeah
Like candy emotion too much and sugar can turn to sand you scream but nobody touches your hand
Are we just shouting at the pain or do we see just what we are we're naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children guns loaded take aim and blow all the dreams away too late for anything better to say hey
Are we just crazy with the pain or do we see just what we are we are 
Naked in the rain naked in the rain maked in the rain
Two faces no fire no traces fever has turned to snow hearts break to show you the way as you go oh
Are we just running from the pain or do we see just what we are
We're naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain naked in the rain
Two children on fire emotion burns higher guns loaded blow all the dreams away
Naked in the rain naked in the rain frightened by the pain naked in the rain
