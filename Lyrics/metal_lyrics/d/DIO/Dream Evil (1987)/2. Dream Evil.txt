All's well at the midnight hour you're ready to fly
Don't think about the darkness or the rumbling in the sky
Somewhere on the morning road just waiting for you
Somethings that just could never be are calling up a spell so you can see yeah
Dream evil the dark that you find in the back of your mind dream evil dream evil
Don't go to the edge of rainbows don't close your eyes
Like things that can't be real the truth is really lies
Don't wish on a rising star you should open up the door 
Where things that just should never be are calling up a spell so you can see yeah
Dream evil the dark that you find can come out of your mind dream evil take you away
Oh no it's the midnight hour don't leave me alone
Those things that just should never be are calling up a spell so you can see
Dream evil dream evil dream evil dream evil dream evil
Oh no it's the midnight hour don't open the door
Don't go to the edge of rainbows don't sleep any more
You'll dream evil you'll dream evil you'll dream evil dream evil
