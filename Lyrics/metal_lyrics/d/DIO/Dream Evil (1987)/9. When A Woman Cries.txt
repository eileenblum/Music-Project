Oh rain falls thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move they're shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire burning through your brain turn to face the train oh oh
Hey it's magic said the mother to the child it's stronger than a smile let it go
When a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah when a woman cries when a woman cries ah aah
Just when you think it's pretend here it comes over and over again
And if we should live forever maybe we'll still just never know oh oh
Oh rain falls thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky everywhere
Stars move shakin' all the earth show you what you're worth here it comes when a woman cries
Fire magic shakin' all the earth when a woman cries
Oh oh stars move thunder cracks the air lightning from the sky when a woman cries
When a woman cries aah when a woman cries yeah yeah 
When a woman cries when a woman cries oh
