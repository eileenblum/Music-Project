Did you ever believe in your dreams before were you always afraid of the dark
Is the edge of the world always in your head does the gun point straight at your heart
It used to come just when you sleep but now it's only a shout away
You always seem to find the sun but this time the sun is a fire
Bring down the rain this house is burning again put out the flame bring down the rain
You were told that the storm would just roll on by that the thunder was made in your mind
And the heat in the night was to keep you warm and the truth could be told by a liar now
You always seem to find the light but this time the light is a fire
Bring down the rain this house is burning again put down the flame bring down the rain
Shake up break up everybody make up everything's always the same
Trapped down trapped down everybody back down bring down the rain
You always seem to find the light but this time the light is a fire
Bring down the rain this house is burning again don't play the game 
Bring down the rain put out the flame bring down the rain
It's the shake up break up everybody make up well it's always the same
Trapped down cracked down everybody back down won't you bring down all the rain
