Good night we're closing again come back we're open tomorrow
We've finished today I'm just staying away we know what's good for the brain
Oh plastic dreams and fast machines pushing it to the limit
Girls and boys who think that noise is music in the air
Twisted felon stay awhile here's your invitation dirty rags and body bags evilution
Hello we're open once more come in you need no appointment
We're thinking in time that you'll move down the line and represent the business in hell well well
Tell her hope is gone but you carry on we can set the soul free all is lost so what's it costs to listen anyway
The world upstairs where no one cares is just about to crumble see it through we'll burn for you evilution company
Oh neon names play neon games showing it to the public I hate you and you hate me and everybody smiles 
So money talks and no one walks but everybody's crawling golden rags and body bags evilution
Hello good night it's me I'm open again come back come in good bye we're closed
