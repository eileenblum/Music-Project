She heard this song before daddy's at the door just to say I love you
Please please don't let him in is it all beginning again tonight somebody make it right
I say give her the gun look at him run away
Give her the gun before the next one comes along and doesn't pay
He dragged into the cold momma sold her soul for one more ride to heaven
Please someone let him in is it all beginning again tonight can anyone make it right
I say give him the gun look at her run away
Oh give him the gun before the next one comes along and doesn't pay
Simply unforgivable destruction of the heart does anybody tell
Make yourself invisible be blinded by the light we're hiding away what would they say yeah
She played this song before daddy's at the door just to say hello ah
Now in a different world is it all beginning again tonight oh I got to make it right
I say give her the gun look at him run away oh give her the gun before the next one comes along
Give her the gun look at him falling down oh give her the gun before the next one comes along 
'cause it goes round and round and round and round and round and round and round
