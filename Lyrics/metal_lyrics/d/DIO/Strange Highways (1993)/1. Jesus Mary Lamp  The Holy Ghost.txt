Prime time nursery rhyme did you see the teacher sister black and white what she's gonna to do
They say eye for eye tooth for tooth but don't hurt your brother cross road overload
Oh I I testify they just showed me Mary she was stoned stoned danger zone there was nothing in her eyes
And then there there in the air nailed to the cross was Jesus cross road overload
Now I lay me down to sleep pray my soul to keep away from the holy spirit holy ghost they're hiding in the dark
Oh nightmare electric chair you might not get to heaven bad boys shout for joy watch him to cry
Prime time nursery rhyme love just needs religion cross road overload
