Came to the sunset scene to find out who's inside of me some lies I've never seen
But this one lies on the silver screen in between real and dream like a scream
Hollywood black I'm caught in the middle Hollywood black
Same story different eyes here's where the hero never never dies
Can't you tell that all the wishes you've made have filled up the well
Hollywood black caught in the middle Hollywood black yeah 
Oh Hollywood black right in the middle too late to little
Back to the street again or was that yesterday another yesterday's gone gone
Back in the jungle running with the animals howling at the sign of the spotlight oh
Those dreams are made of glass you throw just one stone and then there goes your last window
Can't you tell that every wish that you made filled up the well
Hollywood black caught in the middle Hollywood black
Hollywood black right in the middle yeah Hollywood black
Hollywood black caught in the middle too late to little
And only fools come back 'cause Hollywood's black
