It's a crazy world we live in and I'm leaving it today for another institution we crazy people play
Every time I climb the mountain and it turned into a hill I promised me that I'd move on and I will
I I good for nothing going nowhere so they say hey someone give me blessings for they say that I have sinned
That when I crawl inside myself and ride into the wind on strange highways on strange highways
Hey you I want your number don't even wonder we do things our way here
Questions these are forbidden we got no answers believe us anyway
So here is my confession it's the only broken rule sometimes I crawl inside of me
Where I can be the fool on strange highways on strange highways oh
You can see the other side and you shall come over you can't leave the other side if you say I will
Everytime I climb the mountain and it turned into a hill well I promised me I'd disappear and now I know I will
So someone give me blessings for the times you say I've sinned
So I can crawl inside myself and ride into the wind on strange highways on strange highways
Questions they're forbidden hey you what's your number oh we've got no answers 
Don't you even wonder on strange highways aaah
