Oh you've been surprised again pulled like a leaf to the waterfall
Everybody's just pretending I thought that you'd learn by now
Oh think about it one more time what have you got when the god is gone
Clouds don't have a silver lining and all you ever get is rain
'cause you can't get blood from a stone you can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone you can't get blood from a stone
It isn't once upon a time when nobody falls and the hero flies
That victims got to fit the crime and nobody goes down with you you you
'cause you can't get blood from a stone you can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone you can't get blood from a stone no no
'cause you can't get blood from a stone you can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone no you can't get blood from a stone
No blood from a stone go on and leave me alone and I know it's a shock
To learn you can't you can't you can't get blood from a rock
