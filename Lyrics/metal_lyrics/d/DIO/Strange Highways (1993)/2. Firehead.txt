Who's that angry man I see is he coming closer 
Well I'll just make believe that I've never been afraid
Crackle crackle you're all dead feel the heat from firehead
&gt;From spooky stories that he's read they put pictures on his body
Living out a fantasy to be the last one left alive hah
Crackle crackle you're all dead feel the heat from firehead
He's lost the instruction no control suicide fever he won't be much older I know won't go away
What's that smoke that I can see rising from the ashes
Well it seems that there will always be someone just like you
Crackle crackle and you're all dead feel the heat from firehead firehead firehead
