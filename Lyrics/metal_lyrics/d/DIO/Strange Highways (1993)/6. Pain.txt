Give me a choice between pleasure and pain I choose pain
Another day without a heartbeat how can your heart beat if they've taken it away
For the first time just don't think about it take the water and wash your face with pain
You can take away the power your finest hour it's when you laugh in their faces
For the first time just forget about it take a hammer and pound yourself with pain aaah
Bury my bones on the moon if they never should find me it would be too soon
Give me a choice between power and pain I choose pain
Oh bury my bones on moon if they never should find me it would be too soon
For the first time just forget about take the water and wash your face with pain pain
Oh just forget about pain forget about the pain pain pain pain pain pain
