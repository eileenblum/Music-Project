Here's to you here's to me masters of the universe the curse of destiny
All for one it's one for all now you can pull the trigger as we're knocking down the wall
When you finally shoot too high the lie will always bring it down
You resurrection angels look what we found that the wheel goes around so here's to you
Come on raise the dead heads will roll cancel the infection we can purify the soul
Do the crime then write the law there's no wrong you can change it where a change you've never saw
Hey you desperation angels here we found that they all fell down so here's to me here's to you
Here's to you here's to me here's to reason oh here's to me here's to you raise the dead here's to freedom
