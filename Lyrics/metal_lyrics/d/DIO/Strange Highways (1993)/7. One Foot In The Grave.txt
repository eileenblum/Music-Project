Here we go again must be delirious can't close my eyes sleep is just a drug 
This must be serious this must be serious does this go on and on forever
Sometimes in the dark I feel invincible I wonder why 
I hear voices out of shadows and shadows never lie
Helter skelter now give me shelter use the children like toys
Eat your lover then find an another there be good little boys boys will be boys
I got two hands to hold you two arms around you the master and the slave
Two eyes to watch you two hands to help you put one foot in the grave
Here we go again must be delirious can't close my eyes no sleep is just a drug 
This must be serious this must be serious
Helter skelter now give me shelter my brain is twisting again
I could be dreaming this no I'm screaming this no more no
I got two hands to hold you two arms around you the master and the slave
Two eyes to watch you two hands to help you put one foot in the grave
