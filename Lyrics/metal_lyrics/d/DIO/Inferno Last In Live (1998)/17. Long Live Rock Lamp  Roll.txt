[Rainbow Cover]

All right
Rock and roll, yeah

At the end of a dream
If you know where I mean
When the mist just starts to clear
In a similar way
At the end of today
I can feel the sound of writing on the wall
It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screamin' in the air

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll

In a different time
When the words didn't rhyme
You could never quite be sure
In a similar way
At the end of today
I can feel the sound of writing on the wall
It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screamin' in my mind

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll

Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock 'n' roll

I'm the man, the man, Iâll give you a hand
I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the day, the day
Iâll show you the way
I live up on the mountain
Iâm the man on the mountain
The man on the silver mountain
Go down with fire and Iâll lift you higher
Iâm the man

Youâre the man, youâre the man, youâre the man
Weâre all the man
