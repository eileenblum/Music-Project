[Japanese Bonus Track]

I am anger
Under pressure
Lost it cages
A prisoner
The first to escape
I am wicked
I am legion
Strength in numbers
A lie
The number is one

[Chorus:]
I - I - I
Everything that I see is for me
Yes, I am giant
I'm a monster
Breaking windows
In houses
Buildings of glass
Rebel rebel
Holy outlaw
Ride together
Don't try it
The power's in one

[Chorus:]
I - I - I
I am standing alone
But I can rock you
I - I - I
On the edge of the blade
But the knife can't cut the hero down
I am virgin
I'm a whore
Giving nothing
The taker
The maker of war
I'll smash your face in
But with a smile
All together
You'll never
Be stronger than me

[Chorus:]
I - I - I
Right here on my own
But I still rock you
I - I - I
Don't follow behind
Just leave me on the outside
I - I - I
I am standing alone
But I can shock you
I - I - I
On the edge of the blade
But no one makes the hero bleed
( No, no , no )
I am hunger
Feed my head
All together
You'll never
Never make the hero bleed
( No, no, no )
