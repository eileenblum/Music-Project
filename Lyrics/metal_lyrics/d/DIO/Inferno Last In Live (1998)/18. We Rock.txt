You watch their faces
And you'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see

They come for killing
They leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Just penetrates your mind

But sail on, sing a song, carry on
Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock

We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same
Just got a different name

So many voices
All giving choices
If we listen they will say
That we can find the way

But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
How We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock!

We Rock

You watch their faces
You'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see

They come for killing
And they leave but still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Can penetrate your mind

Sail on, sing a song, carry on
Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock

Ride out - stand and shout - carry on
Sail on - sing your song - carry on

We Rock
We Rock
You Rock

Rock ânâ Roll
