[Rainbow Cover]

I'm a wheel, I'm a wheel

I can roll, I can feel
And you can't stop me turning
I'm the sun, the sun
I can move, I can run
You'll never stop me burning

Get down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me holy again

I'm the man on the silver mountain
The man on the silver mountain

I'm the day, the day
I show you the way
Look, I'm right beside you
I'm the night, I'm the night
I'm the dark and the light
With eyes that see inside you

Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me holy again

I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the man on the silver mountain
Iâll lift you even higher
The man on the silver mountain

And now for something completely different
