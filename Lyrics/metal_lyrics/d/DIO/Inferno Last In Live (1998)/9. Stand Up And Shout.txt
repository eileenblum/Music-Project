It's the same old song
You've gotta be somewhere at sometime
And they never let you fly
It's like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes

You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout
Stand up and shout

You've got wings of steel
But they never really move you
And you only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know you've got to want it all

You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Shout it out
Stand up and shout it out
Stand up and shout

You can shout

You are the strongest chain
And youâre not just some reflection
So never hide again

You are the driver
You own the road
You are the fire
Go on explode
You've got desire
So let it out
You've got the power
Stand up and shout
Stand up and shout
Stand up and shout

You gotta shout
You gotta shout
You gotta shout
You gotta let it out
Shout, shout, shout

Stand up and shout
Shout, shout, shout
Shout, shout, shout
Stand up and shout

Alright!
