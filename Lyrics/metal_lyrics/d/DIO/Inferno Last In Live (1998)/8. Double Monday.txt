Tracy G!

When you're alone and the sun's gone down
One more time
Must you pretend that some light still shines
Sounds like double Monday

Each time you think that you've just begun
Well, it's the end
Someone you love wants to just be a friend
Sounds like double Monday

Feels like snakes and spiders
Crawling up your body
Every someday double Monday

Like a fly against the wall
Just when you think you've seen it all you
You lost your special place, where you can go to hide
So get ready for the ride, ride, ride

Every someday double Monday
