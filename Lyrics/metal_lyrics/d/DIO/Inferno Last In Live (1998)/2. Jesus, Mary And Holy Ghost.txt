Prime time
Nursery rhyme
Did you see the teacher
Sister
Black and white
What she gonna to do
They say eye for eye, tooth for tooth
But don't hurt your brother
Cross-road, overload

Well, it's I, I testify
They just showed me Mary
She was stoned, stoned, danger zone
Nothing in her eyes
And then there, there in the air
Nailed to the cross was Jesus
Cross-road, overload

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray my soul to keep away from
Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost
Hiding in the dark

Oh, it's a nightmare, electric chair
You might not get to heaven
Cool boy, shout for joy
Watch him 'till he cry
Prime time
Nursery rhyme
Love just needs religion
Cross-road, overload

Jesus
