Hey liar, tell me your intentions are good
Knowing it could be a lie
I see how you rise
To question the eyes of anyone who promises pain

Contagious, something like a virus of love
Making the pleasure seem real

Another killing by the villain
Another body on the ground
Here comes the master of destruction again
I knew you from the start
Hunter of the heart

Cat crazy, never the predictable one
Asleep in the sun now the strike
Possession today, then send it away
After all the joys in the taking

Yet another beating by the villain
And another angel fallen down
Here comes the master of destruction again
Perfect for the part
Hunter of the heart

Another burning by the devil
And another diamond turned to glass
Here comes the master of destruction again
I knew you from the start
Hunter of the heart
Hunter of the heart
