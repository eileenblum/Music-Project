[Black Sabbath Cover]

On and on, on and on
Itâs heaven and hell
On and on, on and on
Itâs heaven and hell
On and on, on and on
Itâs heaven and hell

Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The devil is never a maker
And he less that you give, you're a taker
It goes on and on and on, it's heaven and hell
Oh well

The lover of life's not a sinner
And the ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
Well, the sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
And it goes on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell
Sometimes weâre are fools

Oh, weâre going down

Something is evil down there
Someone is coming to take your soul away
I see some trouble up there
Youâll not make it to another day

Thereâs a big black shape looking up at me
He said: âI know where you ought to beâ
He said: âCome with me and Iâll give you desire!
First you got to burn, burn, burn in fire!â

Down we go
Iâll take you there, Iâll see you there, weâll alway be there
Somewhere in hell

Well, they say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Whoâll blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh well

And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh no, no

Fool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool, fool
Look for the answer
Alright, alright
Heaven and hell

Well, itâs heaven, itâs heaven, itâs heaven and hell
