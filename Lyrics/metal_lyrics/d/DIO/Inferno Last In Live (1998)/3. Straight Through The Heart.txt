Alright

Well, I'm hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it, I never heard it all

Living in a world of make believe
You can hide behind what's real
Wearing your emotions on your sleeve
And they all know what you feel

Here it comes again
Straight through the heart
Straight through the heart

Oh, never tell a secret with your eyes
It's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
It's the only way I've found

Oh, here it comes again
Straight to your heart
Right in the middle of your heart

Shout to the wind
Say; how can you hurt me this way
Oh once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay

I'm just hanging from the cobwebs in your mind
It looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
And I never heard it, I never heard it all, no!

Here it comes again
Straight through your heart
There it's in your heart

Now here it comes again
Goes straight through your heart

Now don't stand still, they'll get you
Right down inside your heart
And here it comes, here it comes again
Right in your heart
Straight through the heart

Say, it's right, right, right, right, right in your heart
