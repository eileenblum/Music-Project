[Deep Purple Cover, but in the Concert, Dio says that it is from the Rainbow's album: "Rainbow Live: On Stage."]

I've been mistreated
I've been abused
I've been struck down-hearted, baby
I've been confused
Cos I know, yes I know
I've been mistreated
Since my baby left me
I've been losing my mind
I've been lonely
I've been cold
I've been looking for a woman
To have and hold
Cos I know, yes I know
I've been mistreated
Since my baby left me
I've been losing, I've been losing
I've been losing my mind
I've been mistreated
I've been abused
I've been looking for a woman
I've been confused
Cos I know, yes I know
I've been mistreated
Since my baby left me
I've been losing, losing
I've been losing my mind
Oh woman I've been losing my mind
