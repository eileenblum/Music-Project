Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean

Gotta get away
Holy Diver

Got shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you, look out
Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right

Gotta get away - get away

Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
Say, the vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel

Holy Diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid
Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen

Well,Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me
Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean

Gotta get away â get away
Gotta get away â get away
Holy Diver
Holy Diver
Youâre the one whoâs clean
Holy Diver
Youâre the sole survivor
There a cat in the blue
Heâs coming out for you
Holy Diver
Get away â get away â get away
Holy Diver
Holy Diver
Holy Diver
