I'm all right - I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night - black as heaven
So no-one saw the gun

Running with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark

Oh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back around

Clutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark

I'm all right - I'm crossing over
I can disappear - gone

Clutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Better in the dark
I just shot the sun
