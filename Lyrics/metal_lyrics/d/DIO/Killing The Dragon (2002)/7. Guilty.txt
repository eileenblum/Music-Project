He'd never tell her lies
And she believed in magic
But when the magic died
She could see that all along he's just been

Guilty - a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty - burn in fire
Guilty

It's time to say goodbye
Don't tell another story
Another alibi
Now you see that all along he's just been

Guilty - a liar, liar
Guilty
Guilty - you burn in fire
Guilty
Guilty - the great pretender
Guilty
You're guilty - just surrender cause you're guilty

Broken promise
But please forgive again
One more time for me
It's the very last time - you'll see

Guilty - liar, liar
You'll burn in fire
Guilty - liar, liar
Guilty

Guilty - the great pretender
Guilty
Guilty - just surrender, you're guilty
Guilty, guilty, guilty
A liar, liar
Guilty - you'll burn in fire
Oh guilty, you'll burn in fire
Surrender - guilty
So guilty
