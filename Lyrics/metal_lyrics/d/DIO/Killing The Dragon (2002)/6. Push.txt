You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingers

Sometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once again

Before you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save you

You gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more push

You're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls again

Before you're in the water
Can't sail away
Here's a way to save you

You gotta push
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better push

You gotta push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
You can turn the wheel
Go on and push
Push
Push
Push
Push
