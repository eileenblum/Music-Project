Oh-oh, the sun's gone down
Her day begins
And the rhythm of the darkness
Wakes the dead

Don't answer eyes that smile
Don't let them in
They see the lonely child
She feels their sin
But it's getting so much colder
And she's afraid

Never going back to where the pain was
She'd rather face the pain that's here and now

Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child

I'll make you safe and warm
Words she needs to hear
What they really mean is no more little girl

Don't see her anymore
They disappear

Yesterday they said that she was dying
And just today I heard that she was dead

Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child

Someone's thrown away their children
You can hear them only if you try
Sing for the runaway children
Goodbye

Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child
