Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's all right
No confessions - not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll do

The first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down
Along comes a spider

Suddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers' candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyes

Now I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Along comes a spider

Don't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wild

Why do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hear

Now you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
Along comes a spider
A spider
A spider
Inside her
