Someone had a dream
Never been to London
Never in a limousine

Something made him go
Could it be the voices
Coming from the radio

But somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fall

Someone joined the band
But he never heard the music
Couldn't really understand
No, no no

Don't know what they mean
Where's my picture
Shining from a magazine

But somewhere down the line
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fall

Someone ran so fast
When he saw the future
He was sure that it was just the past

Someone had a dream
Only this one ended lost
Inside the old machine

And somewhere down the line
They'll say that his is mine
And all that's left is time
Time to fall and stumble, ah
