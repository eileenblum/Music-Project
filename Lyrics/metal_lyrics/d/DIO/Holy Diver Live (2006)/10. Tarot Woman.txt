[Rainbow cover]

I don't wanna go
Something tells me no, no, no, no
But traces in the sand
The lines inside my hand Say go, go, go

Beware of a place
A smile of a pride shiny face

I'll never return up to your love
Tarot woman
I don't know
I don't know

She can take you there
The answer's to the fear
Mine, mine, mine

Like a carousel
And cast a magic spell
You can fly, fly

Beware of a place
A smile of a pride shining face

I'll never return up to your love
Tarot woman but I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

Something in the air
Tells me to beware, no, no, no
Her love is like a knife
Should cut away your life
So go, go, go

Beware of a place
A smile of a pride shining face

I'll never return up to your love
Tarot woman, I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Hey, I don't know
