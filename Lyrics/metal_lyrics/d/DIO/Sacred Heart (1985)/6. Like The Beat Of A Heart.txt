Tonight we run we can hide in the dark when the moon steals the light from the dying sun
Oh run it's a better thing than we have ever done
There's a beast that lives inside you and it's screaming to get out
Like the beat of a heart like the beat of a heart
Don't look behind 'cause a tear that never dies can only make you blind
You've got to try 'cause the future's never never gonna die
There's a beast that lives inside you and it's screaming to get out
It's a storm that's never ending it's a truth without a doubt yeah eh
Tonight we run we can hide in the dark 'till the moon steals the light from the sun
There's a beast that lives inside you and it's screaming let me out
It's a storm that's never ending it's a truth without a doubt
Now love can be a whisper but pain will always shout to you
Like the beat of a heart like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart like the beat of a heart whoa beat your heart
