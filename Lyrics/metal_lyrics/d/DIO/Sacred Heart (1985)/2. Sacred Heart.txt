Hey the old ones speak of winter the young ones praise the sun and time just slips away
Oh running into nowhere turning like a wheel and a year becomes a day
Whenever we dream that's when we fly so here is a dream for just you and I
We'll fin the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Look for the light and find the sacred heart
Oh here we see the wizard staring through the glass and he's pointing right at you
Now you can see tomorrow the answer and the lie and the things you've got to do yeah
Oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
But oh sometimes you want it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night oh look to the light
Well you fight to kill the dragon and bargain with the beast and sail into a sight
You run along the rainbow and never leave the ground and still you don't know why
Whenever you dream you're holding the key it opens the door to let you be free yeah
And find the sacred heart somewhere bleeding in the night yeah
Run for the light and you'll find the sacred heart
A shout comes from the wizard the sky begins to crack and he's looking right at you quick
Run along the rainbow before it turns to black attack
And oh sometimes you never fall and ah you're the lucky one
Oh sometimes you need it all you've got to reach for the sun
And find the sacred heart yeah bleeding in the night yeah yeah 
We'll find the sacred heart
