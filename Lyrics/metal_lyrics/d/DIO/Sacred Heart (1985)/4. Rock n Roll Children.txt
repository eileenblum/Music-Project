It was starting to rain on the night that they first decided
It was blinding with snow on the night that they ran away
They were found in the dark but they never returned just like somebody slammed the door bang yeah
She was meant to be wild he was nearly a child but they only could feel each other
They were paper and fire angel and liar the devil of one another
Then they were thrown to the ground with a terrible sound just like somebody broke a heart
Rock'n'roll children alone again rock'n'roll children without a friend but they got rock'n'roll
It was starting to rain on the night that they cried forever
Oh it was blinding with snow on the night that they screamed goodbye
They were lost in the dark and they never returned just like somebody slammed the door
Ah rock'n'roll children alone again rock'n'roll children without a friend 
Poor rock'n'roll children caught up in the spinning wheel poor rock'n'roll children alone again
It was starting to rain on the night that they ran it was blinding with snow on the night we let them go
Poor rock'n'roll children oh oh children rock'n'roll children children of the night
Poor rock'n'roll children poor children lost poor souls rock'n'roll children oh ho oh ho oh ho
Rock'n'roll children rock and roll
