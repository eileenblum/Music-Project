She's a rumor in the night it's crazy you can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light it's crazy but you go anywhere
It was just a summer night maybe when a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away maybe to go where where where
She crouches the hunter ready to tell you another lie another lie
You could see the side of someday feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway you were wrong wrong wrong
She jumped at the moment a chance to tell you another lie another lie another lie
It was just a summer night maybe when a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away maybe to go where where where
She jumps at the moment she crouches the hunter yeah
You look and you know she's telling you another lie another lie another lie
Why it's crazy when you feel you're getting stronger another lie
Why it's crazy all the lies are getting longer another lie
Who oh yeah another lie another lie
