You never sing for pleasure you only make the sounds
You never feel the magic 'cause you think the world is round
And you never dance in moonlight you run but you never move
You don't believe in someday and the truth is what you prove
But it's alright well it's all right just another day
Too many chains around you you laugh but you never smile
You don't belong in heaven but you're here all the while
And it's alright well it's all right just another day another day another day
Another day to let you down another way that they have found
Yes another day another way another way another day
You never sing for pleasure you only make the sounds
You never feel the magic 'cause you think the world is spinning round for you
But it's alright yes it's all right well it's alright just another day
