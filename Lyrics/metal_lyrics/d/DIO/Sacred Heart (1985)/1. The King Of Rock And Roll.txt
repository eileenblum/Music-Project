He's the king of rock and roll yeah all right yeah
Right hot night summer in the city just about to smoke and burn
Look out he's evil but he's pretty and oh he's gonna twist and turn
He's got the midnight madness he's got control he's the king of rock and roll
Bad blood everybody knows it but everybody doesn't care no
He's got the only way to show it they want to see it everywhere
He's got to give you fever he'll scratch your soul
He's the king of rock and roll the king of rock and roll
Bad boy always on the cover gettin' the story told
Fast fast one way or another 'cause he'll never never never never never get old
He makes a special magic and you've got control you are the king of rock and roll
He's got the midnight madness he's got a soul
'cause he's the king of rock and roll king of rock and roll 
Rock and roll rock and roll rock and roll the king of rock and roll yeah
