Yes you know the feeling all alone your back to the wall
And all the doorways are starting to close in front of you
Well there's no confusion oh no it came in a spell I found it in a wishing well whoa
Now it's a matter of mind you know you can be free forever
So the next time someone points a gun at you
Say shoot shoot I don't care shoot shoot
Hey someone if your chains are heavy for you
Hey someone let it rain while I show you the way this could be your lucky day
It's a matter of mind you know you can be free forever
And the next time someone points a gun at you hey
Say shoot shoot I don't care shoot shoot
Hey shoot shoot anywhere shoot shoot bye bye
Yeah shoot shoot it's a matter of mind shoot shoot you know you can be free forever
Shoot shoot so the next time someone points a gun at you hey
Say shoot shoot I don't care shoot shoot
Oh no shoot shoot anywhere shoot shoot
Yeah shoot shoot I won't go away shoot shoot yeah whoa oh aah
Shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot
