Screaming out alone in the night just a time and place but it's real all right
We are diamonds that shine without fire we're climbing the stairs
Going down and never higher we're fallen angels 
Something came to me in a dream the crack of a gun and a bloody scream
The I could see the faces and why I was holding the gun and the world began to die
For fallen angels falling down fallen angels come gather round yey
It's a criminal world and we all get to play you're a criminal
Sins of the children never get washed away
We're fallen angels goin' down oh we are fallen angels gather round
Screaming out alone in the night just a time and place but it's real all right
We are diamonds that shine without fire we are climbing the stairs
Going down and never higher we're fallen angels fallen angels fallen angels
If something comes to you in a dream open your eyes and scream it out
Remember that the evil will rule it's waiting outside bringin' pain for you fallen angels
