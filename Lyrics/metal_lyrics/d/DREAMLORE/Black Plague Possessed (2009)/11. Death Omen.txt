Driven to the edge
Misplaced faith I cannot move on
In my sleep a recurrent nightmare
I'm desperate for a sign

Searching... drifting...
Losing... control...

Sentence of death
Under its grasp
I turn around and see myself
Taking someone else's life
Sentenced to death
Under my grasp

[Chorus:]
All I see (is) a metaphor of the way I'll die
Pray to keep my sanity
All is lost
Screaming death is everything I see

Sleeping in the arms of death
Dreaming of its realms
I'm immortal I cant be brought down
I'm tired I got left behind
In a pool of blood

[Chorus:]
All I see (is) a metaphor of the way I'll die
Pray to keep my temper
All is lost
Screaming death is everything I see

Take a walk to try to clear my mind
From all the contradictions clouding my sight
I see a noose begging for my neck
I see a black gun and a bullet
Dripping blood with my name on it

Searching... drifting...
Losing... control...
