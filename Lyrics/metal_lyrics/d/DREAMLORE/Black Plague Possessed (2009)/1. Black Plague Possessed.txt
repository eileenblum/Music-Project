These never-dying tunes
That pervade in my soul
Filtered and transmuted through my mind
Are the laments of the hopeless and the damned?

[Chorus:]
Exalted
Violent, obsessed
Black plague possessed
Violent, obsessed

I feel nothing but terror
Words of doom rise to the sky
Like voices calling up from down below
I hear the bells of hell begin to chime

[Chorus:]
Exalted
Violent, obsessed
Black plague possessed
Violent, obsessed
Corrupted
Sickly obsessed
Black plague possessed
Sickly obsessed

Invaded by fear
Chills run down my spine
Legions of undead spirits
Lead my soul to rot
Infected skin
Bloating corpse
Filled with hatred
And lust

[Chorus:]
Exalted
Violent, obsessed
Black plague possessed
Violent, obsessed
Corrupted
Sickly obsessed
Black plague possessed
Sickly obsessed
