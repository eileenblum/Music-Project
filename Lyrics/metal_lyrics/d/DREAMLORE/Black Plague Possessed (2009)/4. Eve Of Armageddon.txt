Passed on in the dark

Warnings
Signs of the future
Fast-forwarded by us
Signs of chaos

All the lies we've been told
Our trustâ¦ betrayed
The blood we spilled, still in our hands
Our lustâ¦ for death

[Chorus:]
Brutal putrid massacre
Brutal putrid massacre
Brutal putrid massacre
Brutal putrid massacre

Eve of armageddon

Tasting the sarcasm
In destiny's behavior
It's morbid
Blind, brainless soldiers
Fate gave up on us

Scorned

All the lies we've been told
Our trustâ¦ betrayed
The blood we spilled, still in our hands
Our lustâ¦ for death

[Chorus:]
Brutal putrid massacre
Brutal putrid massacre
Brutal putrid massacre
Brutal putrid massacre
Eve of armageddon
