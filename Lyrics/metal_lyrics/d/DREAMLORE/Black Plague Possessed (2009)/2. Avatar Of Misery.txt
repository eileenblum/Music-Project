The sight of you, the sight of you
Exhuming my frustration
Full of envy
My thoughts, my stupid thoughts

Your eyes
Burning through my skull
The taste in my mouth
So bitter

[Chorus:]
Share my misery
Feel my disease
Share my misery
Feel my disease

See my face, stare into my eyes
Filled with distrust
I hate the way you look at me

Unable to breakthrough
I need to see you suffer
Share my misery

[Chorus:]
Share my misery
Feel my disease
Share my misery
Feel my disease

Murder your own breed
Kill your family
Drown your children
Kill the bastards
Rape them, burn them, kill them

Seeing through the dark
Finding a way out
I need to see you suffer
Share my misery
Need to see you suffer

[Chorus:]
Share my misery
Feel my disease
Share my misery
Feel my disease

Feel my disease
Feel my disease
Feel my disease
Feel my disease
