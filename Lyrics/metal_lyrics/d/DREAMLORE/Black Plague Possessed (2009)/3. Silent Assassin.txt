Powerful gain, supremacy triggered
By all the shit you've done to me
My soul is on fire, you've given me power
Draining your strength that my spirit devours
Stabbing your neck, I speak with my knife
Eating your brains, my greet is my axe
Waiting to die, bound to get old
Apathy controls
Dealing with truth: problems ignored
Silencing fools with terror and gore
No damage done, we reap what we sow
Cross the threshold as you die

[Pre-Chorus:]
Spreading the infection, to live without a care
No reign of resurrection, our path is damp and cold

[Chorus:]
Hate is fuel, thirst for blood surpassing
Can't refuse the thrill-Kill
Beware, I'm a silent assassin

We all have our demons, but to tell you the truth
I'm a master of pain and disgrace
This is no joke; I'll show you motherfucker
I'll wipe that smile off your face
Stabbing your neck, I speak with my knife
Eating your brains, my greet is my axe
Waiting to die, bound to get old
Apathy controls
Dealing with truth: problems ignored
Silencing fools with terror and gore
No damage done, we reap what we sow
Cross the threshold as you die

Traveling back and forward to the point where I began
More, I still want more: bloodshed and slaughter
Burned alive! The need to kill is eating me
I feel nothing, I never cared at all

[Pre-Chorus:]
Spreading the infection, to live without a care
No reign of resurrection, our path is damp and cold

[Chorus:]
Hate is fuel, thirst for blood surpassing
Can't refuse the thrill-Kill
Beware, I'm a silent assassin
