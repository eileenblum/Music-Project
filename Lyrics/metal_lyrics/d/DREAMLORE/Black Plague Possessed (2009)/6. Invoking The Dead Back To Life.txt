Summoning forces of the occult
To bring back the dead from beyond
I speak to the hidden ones, they tell me what to do
I need bones and rotten flesh to finish my job
Corruption of nature, abomination
Defying the rules of the world
To help the afflicted and corrupt

[Pre-Chorus:]
Plundering cemeteries
I leave nothing but hollow graves behind
Robbing the dead of their bodies
To perform the dark ritual on a corpse

Mutilate everyone in sight
Can't wait âtill everyone has died
Bury them alive, my edict can't be questioned
Ironical curse, my dark gift is yours
Life offers no answer, necromancer
Hell's oversold
Fuckers need to be zombified

[Pre-Chorus:]
Plundering cemeteries
I leave nothing but hollow graves behind
Robbing the dead of their bodies
To perform the dark ritual on a corpse

[Chorus:]
Invoking the dead back to life
Stitch them together, there's no time
Invoking the dead back to life
Sewing dead body parts, come alive
Invoking the dead back to life

Corruption of nature, abomination
Defying the rules of the world
To help the afflicted and corrupt

Demons, powerful forces of the underworld
Brought forth, grabbing your soul as you die
Imp, shape-shifting face evil fiend
Devouring sins, putrid feast
Out of the dim dark abyss
Welcome back into the pit
Monster, disturbing figure in black
Vulture, rabidly eating dead flesh

[Chorus:]
Invoking the dead back to life
Stitch them together, there's no time
Invoking the dead back to life
Sewing dead body parts, come alive
Invoking the dead back to life
Stitch them together, there's no time
Invoking the dead back to life
Sewing dead body parts, let the dead come back alive
