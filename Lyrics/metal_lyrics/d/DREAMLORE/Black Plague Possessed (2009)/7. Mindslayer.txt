Our eyes are burning with a ghastly gleam
Right now, all of our hours are trances
And all our nightly dreams
Are where the dark eye glances

[Pre-Chorus:]
Zombies rule the earth
A power so greatly controlled
By the prince of the flies
Our rituals celebrate our own demise

[Chorus:]
Why persist on a faith full of spite
Make your own mind, get over the rite
Why persist on a faith full of spite
Make your own mind, get over the rite
Make your own mind

Our will is weak; it's the return of the ghost
Now all of our moments are spellbound
And all our thoughts
Are poisoned, hell-bound

[Pre-Chorus:]
Zombies rule the earth
A power so greatly controlled
By the prince of the flies
Our rituals celebrate our own demise

[Chorus:]
Why persist on a faith full of spite
Make your own mind, get over the rite
Why persist on a faith full of spite
Make your own mind, get over the rite
Make your own mind

Hundreds of clowns parading
In plastic, vomit and disgust
Fallen, lost, afflicted
A kingdom of filth and distrust

Rituals of human convention
Blind faith annihilates our sense
Earthworms get too much attention
We're brainwashed, deceived and mislead

[Chorus:]
Why persist on a faith full of spite
Make your own mind, get over the rite
Why persist on a faith full of spite
Make your own mind, get over the rite
