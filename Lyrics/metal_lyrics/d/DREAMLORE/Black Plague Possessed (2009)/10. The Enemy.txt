Let me have a moment of peace
Before i give myself in
To this eternal nightmares
Let me taste a feeling of relief
(That'd be here) compensating
For every hidden... Fear...

[Chorus:]
Don't let me obey
To the inner enemy
I feel like I'm losing myself
Because of the enemy

Let me have a day unchained
For every infinite night
Of this bitter agony
Let me see a sign of hope
Substituting the torment
Reigning

Any second now i could
Disappear or drift away
In the blinding light of our emptiness
Of this overriding void that's
Devouring my will to live... Dead...

[Chorus:]
Don't let me obey
To the inner enemy
I feel like I'm losing my soul
Because of the enemy
