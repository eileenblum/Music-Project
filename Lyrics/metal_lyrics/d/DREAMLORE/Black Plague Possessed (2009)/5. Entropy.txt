Fed to the wolves
Terminally sick
Drowned in mud
Blood-spit hit
Wasted reminiscent
War-driven moron
Time has taken
A heavy toll on

[Chorus:]
Superstitious terror
Creeping by degrees
Gore deadly error
Infesting killing spree
Centuries of progress
Just to wake up in the dirt
Dead-calm still
We get what we deserve

Your advice
Nothing but empty words
Chants of doom
Promoting rites without meaning
A brutal disease;
Through the alchemy of destiny
A stairway to nowhere
A fucking downfall
All around is horror
Panic ridden spirit
Everything is lost
At the bottom
Of the abyss
Waiting

[Chorus:]
Superstitious terror
Creeping by degrees
Gore deadly error
Infesting killing spree
Centuries of progress
Just to wake up in the dirt
Dead-calm still
We get what we deserve
