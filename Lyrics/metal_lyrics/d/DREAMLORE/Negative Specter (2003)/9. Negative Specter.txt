You remind me of
What my role's here
I hear you trying
To save me,
I hate this place
I've been given
I am what they
Call a lost soul
I hear their voices
Raising high in clamor
But where am I going to go?
When I get together
When I finally
Get it together
Savior: you're
Fighting a lost cause
My mind's set off reality
And I like it better there

I like it better there
I like it better there

[Chorus:]
Lost in the ways of an
Out of focus dream world
I can't tell apart what is real
And what' not
Before I sleep I wear the chains
I have to bear... In the daytime

Smoother yourself
With those sick lies
Cry yourself to sleep
Wondering why is it
So hard to get there
(But) what will you do
When you get there
When you finally get there
What will you do?
What will you do?
What will you do?

[Chorus:]
Lost in the ways of an
Out of focus dream world
I can't tell apart what is real
And what' not
Before I sleep I wear the chains
I have to bear
(In the daytime)

We travel through
Places no one knows
Travel through places
No one understand
We see beauty
No one knows
See in beauty in what
No one understand
We live outwards

In the daytime
In the daytime
In the daytime
In the daytime

(Waiting for me in the
Black, bodiless
Monsters in pain,
I scream
They won't attack
Draining energy
From my soul,
Transforming my
Life into their death
When I sleep: in my dreams,
While awake: when I think,
I'm losing my sanity,
Every second
One step closer,
Closer to their hell,
Further from reality,
I'm the shadows
Of what's left
From what I used to be)
