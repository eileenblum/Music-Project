I feel them take rise
In my terminal fall
Shadows of perversity
This horror I refuse to accept
I could die and I'd like
To relieve my spirit
I can't go on like this

An abnormal specter
Takes over my mind
When facing adversity
I'm living a nightmare
Resting in me... Eternally
I'm running from silence
I got nowhere to run to
Dammed by that ghost

Shadows
Stalking my torturing
Road towards death
Specters
Ever-watching my existence
I get no rest

Ritual denied

Spells
I'm far from redemption
Hallucinations
Distorting my reality
I get no rest

Denied

Help me escape
Ritual denied

Doomed to die
Stay here forever
Without crossing
Threshold towards
Heaven or hell
