Two different worlds
Are inside my head
Contradicting, I'm not the same one
My death is announced,
Fatal convulsion, eternal screams
I'm breathing ashes

I'm trapped in your eternal cycle
Feeding on... Memories from... Past droughts

[Chorus:]
I keep moving forwards
By the promise of Future Winters
I keep on drowning
By the promise of Future Winters

I already think of
My own destruction
Black holes in black universes
I live my life looking backwards
I'm suffocating 'cause
I'm breathing ashes

I keep on drowning
I keep on drowning

[Chorus:]
I keep moving forwards
By the promise of Future Winters
I keep on drowning
By the promise of Future Winters

Awaiting you aeon
So I can understand...
The sense of this...
...Infinite spiral

I keep on drowning
I keep on drowning

[Chorus:]
I keep moving forwards
By the promise of future winters
I keep on drowning
By the promise of future winters
