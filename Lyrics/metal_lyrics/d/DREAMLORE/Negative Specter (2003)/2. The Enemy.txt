Let me have a moment of peace
before I give myself in
to this eternal nightmares.
Let me taste a feeling of relief
(That'd be here) Compensating
for every hidden... tear.

Don't let me obey
to the inner enemy
I feel like I 'm losing myself
because of the enemy.

Let me live a day unchained
for every infinite night
of this bitter agony.

Let me see a sign of hope
substituting the torment
reigning.

[Solo: Rex]

Any second now I could
Disappear of drift away
In the blinding light of our emptiness
of this overhidden void that's
devouring my will to live
dead.

Don't let me obey
to the inner enemy
I feel like I'm losing my soul
because of the enemy.
