Every day a struggle
Every night is infinite
For that who won't listen
Avoiding celestial light

In the trance of the waiting
But without anything to think
I still can't digest
The series of events
Senseless, pointless

Sordid sequence
It left me neuter
And inexistent
Black penitence
It left me... dead

I see your eyes in the mirror
Millions of eyes speculating
In the trance of the waiting
But the usual happens:
Dramatically and absolutely:
Nothing

Every day a struggle
Every night is infinite
For that who won't listen
Avoiding celestial light

Eternal winter solstice
