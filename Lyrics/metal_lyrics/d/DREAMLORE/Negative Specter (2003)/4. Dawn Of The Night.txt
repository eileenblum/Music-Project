Beyond truth
Loneliness and frustration
At the end of illusion
Bitterness and desolation
Sometimes you're a lot like death
Sometimes ego takes over

[Chorus:]
I don't blame despair
That lonely unforeseen visitor
I don't blame this glacial mood
That reigns in the ruins of my life

Dawn of the night
Forever my soul bleeding
For those gardens
That were in my dreams
Are now... Dwellings of fear
And the halls of my destiny
Today... Are tombs
Sealed with silence

[Chorus:]
I don't blame despair
That lonely unforeseen visitor
I don't blame this glacial mood
That reigns in the ruins of my life

Dawn of the night
Motion obsolete

(How I'd like to)
Wake up
From this deceiving flare
I need rest
From that unstable storm

I want to for out
This killer brain
Murderer of my aspirations

âA sleep... mercifully...
Devoid of my dreamsâ

A pathetic wave
Enters my senses
Once again I'm at the mercy
Of the cosmos
My motion becomes
This oscillation...
...of decay,
Straight to death's chaos
Seeking rest
By other's punishment

I read it in your eyes
Memories of
Forgotten gods
A vision of ice with hate
You won't let go of
The dawn of the night
Stuck in my mind
Forever
