From the enormous
Dismal household
In the ancestral
Iced woods
Of grey clouds
And dead logs

Terror fog rises above
Surrounding
The terrifying outcome
Unmentioned

Whose faults is it?
The sad faced
Desolated one's
Phantasmagorial's

Author of disgrace
Bringer of misery
To everyone around him
His possession

Fear and hopelessness
Cost him the sinking
The crack in his soul
Cost him the sinking
