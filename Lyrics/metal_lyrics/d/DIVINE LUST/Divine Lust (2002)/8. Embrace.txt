Vain words of promise
roaming through time
burning souls that can not see
the laugh behind the holy desguise 

Like a serpent in the dark
longing for the prey
spreading fear and scaring with threats
within the speech there is dismay

"Crawl to me, I carry the light...
don't say a word-you know I'm right
embrace these lies that lock your doors
don't ask a thing-the faith is yours"

So wait and see
fate's coming to me

Without a question there are no doubts
for those who nod are those who bow
to something which they hope there is
the helping hand-"down on your knees!"
