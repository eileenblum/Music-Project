Like a sky full of clouds
my heart's full of empty words
wounded by you, I cry
the remains washed away

True love never dies
So I sit and pray
for your return, love
form ashes to dust

Bleeding heart cried for you
remembering how happy we were
but only dreams survive
and our love was reality

Livin' in a river of death
soul closed to the world
feeling burned inside
no hope to live on

Alone in the dark

Darkest skies above me
pain comes in silent screams
Now I know, my love
the guilt is in me

Drowning in the blood
of some strange creatures
I've just murdered
my only wished future
