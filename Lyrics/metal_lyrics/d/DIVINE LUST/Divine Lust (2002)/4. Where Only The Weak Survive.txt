Beyond the lands of time
lies an eternal treasure
its core is always much too far
for an open eye can always be blind

under the rain of nonsense
the wise raises up his fortress
and the darkest blindfold
after all can be the guide

Leaving all senses behind
living on the verge
leaving all senses behind
living on the verge
prove the truth and taste the lies

Break the ice
look inside
and see the flames are burning everwhere
so afraid to look
a little higher
in this pathetic realms
where only the weak survive
