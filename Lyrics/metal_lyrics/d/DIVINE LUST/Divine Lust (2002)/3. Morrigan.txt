You're kissing me
with the same feeling as before
but now it's gone
like the few moments of Summer's rain

A creeping love
that's all you gave me
but now it's gone
fake tears dropping in treachery

My heart is wounded
another snake has seduced me
waiting for Winter
left with my remains
I'll pray for Morrigan

Morrigan

That poisoned kiss of yours
a glimpse of anguish
your grief will be eternal
prisoner of a pointless life

I really wanted to feel the same
I really wanted to forget your touch
all I have is the past
cold memories of a slow death
