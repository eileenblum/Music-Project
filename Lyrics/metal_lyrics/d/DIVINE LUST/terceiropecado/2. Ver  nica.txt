...And the sky was made of blood and tears
...And my heart was full of hell and spears
Lost I am inside her burning sea
while her flames consume the life of me

[Chorus]
Fogo infinito minha alma emerge
Terras do Demo que Deus nÃ£o protege
enquanto os cÃ©us morrem
VerÃ³nia rege

...And the sky was like a crown of thorns
for which I bleed, die and reborn
to all who cross this path
Strange domains where life meets death 

[Chorus]

...And the sky was no longer there
but if you looked you should know whyrising from her scarlet domains
to hold the ones who love Samhein

You cannot see me, I am the night
you cannot touch the rain inside

[Chorus]
