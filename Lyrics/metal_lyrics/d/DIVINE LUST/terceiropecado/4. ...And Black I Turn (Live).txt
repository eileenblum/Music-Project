Forgive me Father as well
For in eternal flames of hell
will be thy christian wife
took by the cold kiss of a knife

...And black I turn

Aphrodisiac sights in my mirror
having eyes was my mortal error
catastrophic clash of devotions
breeds everlasting lack of solutions 

...And black I turn

I refuse to live in your shade
I refuse your soul degradation
at least at flames I won't be a slave
of eternities of isolation

...And black I turn
