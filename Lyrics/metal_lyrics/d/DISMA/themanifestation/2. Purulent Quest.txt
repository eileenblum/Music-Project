For, the nameless interred
A Purulent Quest

Aghast mouths, cracked open
Work of dread, Liquefy...

Dread of revelation
Beneath black mourning
Veils, a pervading sense of Grief...

At the frozen lakes of blood
Observe your sidereal journey,
Brothers at the end of time,
Descend in spectral glory [repeat]

Through the massive gates we pass
Gathered in titan halls of gold...

The thundering rage,
Of Victory...

Despotic fiends weigh you soul,
Weighted against the feather of truth
Cascades Burning, Human...

Open Into Darkness...
