Within the deepest chasm of thoughts
An ocean of infernal depths
Beneath Charon's vessel
Moaning faces twist below the surface
Bloodied limbs breaking like gnarled hooks
The screams of conquered souls...
Enter the Chasm of Oceanus...
Crossing the Archrusian lake
Of unbreakable oath
To this shadowy place
Where nothing is real
Souls unburied, the rotting robbed figures
Past the streams of Oceanus
And down flowing waters
Approach the palace of blessed sin
Befouled in pleasure
Mourn in debauchery
Drink and touch the spirit
Writhe before the golden bow
Eridanus near wide wastes of emptiness
Drink and touch the spirit
Writhe before the golden bow
Eridanus near wide wastes of emptiness
Within the deepest chasm of thoughts
An ocean of infernal depths
