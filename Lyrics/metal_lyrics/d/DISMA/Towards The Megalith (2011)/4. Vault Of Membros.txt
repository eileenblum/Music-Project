We are proprietors of the abyss
Compatible with the incomprehensible
Our last known, vestige, now entered
Within the depths of wisdom
The vault cannot be breached
Preparing for our rapture
We are preoccupied with anticipation
With anticipation... Our lament is our ecstasy
A vestige in ruin, a vestige in ruin
Interment of the undesirable
Embodiment unbecoming
We are proprietors of the abyss
We are proprietors of the abyss
The abyss, now lets rejoice...
