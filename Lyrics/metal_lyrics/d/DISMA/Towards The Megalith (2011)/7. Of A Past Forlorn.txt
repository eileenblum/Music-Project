Purge and emanate
In hideous transformation
Into the embrace of the grave
The dark suffering of obscurity
Within obsidian caverns, ten million pits rotate in a maze
Permeate and embolden the bestial structure
The wrath of beauty, shall infest with desire
To be whole before, the grace of death's presence
Where plagues swarm and infect, agonized flesh
Around intricate and deadly columns, absorb and become
Through pestilential graveyards, in moldering torment
Elongated over time, the agony of purification
The call of great thundering aeons
Resounding from the deep
Shattering mountains
As the seas gives birth
To the coming dawn
To the coming dawn...
Purge and emanate
In hideous transformation
Into the embrace of the grave
The dark suffering of obscurity
Desecrated memories, of a past forlorn
Lay burning in the fields of paradise
My enshrined soul perpetuates and expands
Into the dark beyond...
Of a past forlorn...
