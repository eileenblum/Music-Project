Covered in a blood soaked shroud
A holographic glaze of chrome
A sea of naked bodies, heaves in pain
A burning sun rises, on the abyssal plane
The abyssal plane...
Desecrating fiends feast, in tremendous rage
Thundering entrance... Storm of death...
Sinking into an ocean of filth
Upon your throne of flesh,
Dominated and destroyed
Hammered into dust, into dust...
Sealed in diseased coffins, coffins...
Crushed in spectral domination, domination...
Sinking into filth, into filth...
Living crypts, procession of the damned
Cold in rotting, caskets
Enter in eternal sleep
Praying for death
Within your throne of flesh
Dominated and destroyed...
