Towards the Megalith...
Among the last vestige of humanity
To survive in broken ruins
Paths of smoldering, twisted steel
This refuge has become a tomb
A colony without hope
Torn from the womb of life
To exist in desolation
Congregation of the damned
Of the damned...
Massive quakes unearth painful cries
Giving way to the collapse
Crawl to your coffins
Within obsidian graves
Entombed in steel...
