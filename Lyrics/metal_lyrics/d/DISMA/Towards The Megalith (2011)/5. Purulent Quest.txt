For the nameless interred
A purulent quest...
Aghast mouths, cracked open
Work of dread,
Liquefy...
Dread of revelation,
Beneath black mourning
Veils, a pervading sense of grief...
At the frozen, lakes of blood
Observe, your sidereal journey
Brothers at the end of time
Descend, in spectral glory
At the frozen, lakes of blood
Observe, your sidereal journey
Brothers at the end of time
Descend...
Through the massive gates we pass
Gathered in titan halls of gold
The thundering rage, of victory
Despotic fiends weigh your soul
Weighed against the feather of truth
Cascade burning humans...
Open into darkness...
