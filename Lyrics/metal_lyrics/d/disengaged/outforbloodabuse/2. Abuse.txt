You've grown too comfortable preying on who you need,
It's gone on too long growing stronger like disease
You used to bring me down now I'm back on my feet,
Now I know who I am and I'll see you bleed

No more hits
No last kiss
No more fucking words
Take your life back victim of circumstance
End this abuse

Innocence you'll never see, too far this time
Selfish is all you'll ever be, human parasite
Too long I've been living in hell, I know what to do
Even if I'm by myself, end this abuse !

No more hits
No last kiss
No more fucking words
Take your life back victim of circumstance
End this, end this abuse
