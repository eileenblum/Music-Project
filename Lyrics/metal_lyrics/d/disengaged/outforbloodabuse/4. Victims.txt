Knocked down by life again
On the ground, head kicked in
There's a choice to be made
How can I stand up ? Should I just give up ?
It's time to fight, it's time to bleed

Never been beaten, never show weakness
Won't be a victim, won't be a victim of this

Can't be broken no fear of pain
Won't be victim, refuse the name

Won't be another lost will
Win or loose this falls on me

I've heard the lies know what they say

I don't need your lies for council
Use my own eyes to see !

Been there before never again I will never be broken

Worthless
I won't believe it
Victim
Not this time
Throw down
I've got my fists up
Victims
Aren't we all

Can't be broken, no fear of pain
Won't be victim, refuse the name

Can't be broken
Won't play victim
No fear, no fear

Never been beaten, never show weakness
Won't be a victim, won't be a victim of this

Can't be broken no fear of pain
Won't be victim, refuse the name
