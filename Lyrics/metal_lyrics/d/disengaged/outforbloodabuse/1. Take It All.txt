You numbered their days, justice to fall
I know they kicked, I know they screamed, I know they fought back
You deserve this
Take it all

I want to take your family, I want to hear them cry
I want to kill your family, I want to watch them die
Blood on my hands, flows in your veins

Blood of my girl, blood of my son, blood of my own heart, you'll pay for each one
Isolated a constant thirst, there's nothing I need more

I want to take your family, I want to hear them cry
I want to kill your family, I want to watch them die
Blood on my hands, flows in your veins

Such sorrow for the losses
More blood for justice
Such sorrow for the losses
Blood for justice

I want to take your family, I want to hear them cry
I want to kill your family, I want to watch them die
Blood on my hands, flows in your veins
