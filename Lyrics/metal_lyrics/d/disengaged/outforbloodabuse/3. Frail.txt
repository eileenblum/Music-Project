You're made of everything I've done for you
Now I couldn't stand to spit in your face
You aren't even worth my hate it's true
Choke on failure, savor the taste

Without me, you're nothing
You're so weak, you're so frail

You've been cut off, so fun to watch you fall
Catharsis for the way you treated me
You burned your bridges for the last time
Embrace the ashes of your life line
Still pretending you bled for anything

Now far beyond broken
I won't pull you back

Without me, you're nothing
You're so weak, you're so frail

You're so frail
