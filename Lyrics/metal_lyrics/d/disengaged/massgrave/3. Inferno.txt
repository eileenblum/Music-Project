Im a raging inferno of malice and hate
your actions alone made things this way
once brothers in arms, now enemies
wont let your shit get the best of me

beated down, treaded on
you wont stay ahead for long
I'm coming after you 
with vengeance to pull me through

Stabbed in the back too many times to count
I'll uncover your face and 
prove you undevout

Im a raging inferno of malice and hate
your actions alone made things this way
once brothers in arms, now enemies
wont let your shit get the best of me

So useless to try, to plot, to go through
it's the burning hatred and a bad attitude

Im a raging inferno of malice and hate
your actions alone made things this way
once brothers in arms, now enemies
wont let your shit get the best of me

ripped and torn to the core
on your chest i pound
aggression evermore, I fucking knock you out

So useless to try, to plot, to go through
it's the burning hatred and a bad attitude
