It's just a matter of time
until they catch up to me
a war inside my own head
It's your fault these sleepless nights
It's your fault you didnt fight
Broken down just an empty shell
ghost of a man walking through hell
been awake for days trying to sort it out
can't find the way, no direction now
It's me against myself in an onslaught now
I'm coming down
wrap your hands around my throat

Kill Me! 

Coming down to the end
I'm going to make it offend 
all of those who can hurt me now
sick of all their lies, sick of all their hate
bringing me to an unrelenting state 
I can't dread it anymore, not the one to adore
I can't give it to you, I'm not the one that can be
oh God just let me sleep

Kill Me!
