(I am the devil, and I am here to do the devils work)

[4x] I am, I am the devil

I am the devil, inside your head
I am the devil, alive or dead
I am the devil, keeping you strong

Behind the eyes of all who see
there is no life, no love without me
in your hand as you pick up the knife
in your blood as you take the life

I am the devil, in your dreams
I am the devil, the disease
I am the devil, the siren song
I am the devil, in the end
I am the devil, always a friend
I am the devil, you're never alone

I live for the hate, I live for the kill
I live and breathe in the blood you spill
The darkest side, but the one you choose
guided by hate, and subterfuge

I am the devil, that is all
I am the devil, watch you fall
I am the devil, feels so wrong
I am the devil, one last time
I am the devil, look inside
I am the devil, been here all along

break down the walls of convention
use it for self preservation
the dark, is coming on strong
let it control you, or take it on
