Not the norm by any means
unpredictable and obscene
rebel against the world, unchain, unfurl
leaving these chains behind all in due time
only together will we die

Betrayed by the world
back turned to you
cant avoid the mass grave you were born into
Mass grave- not going down alone
Mass grave- blood runs cold
Mass grave- unearth now
fight back now with claws out
drag them down six feel underground

Hatred drives the nails 
through the hands of the martyr
fear keeps them from actions of honor
vacant expressions against diversity
taken in silence never to extinguish
the flame slowly focusing rage

Betrayed by the world
back turned to you
cant avoid the mass grave you were born into
Mass grave- not going down alone
Mass grave- blood runs cold
Mass grave- unearth now
fight back now with claws out
drag them down six feel underground

We waited we suffered
now marked as wanted
