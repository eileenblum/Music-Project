Circles of worship in Circles of Christ
Winds of temptation and winds of remorse
They dragged me and bound me To shadows of  light
Where I tasted affliction And despair

Circles of madness in Circles of wrath
Storms of my darkness destroyed my old past
They dragged me and bound me To shadows of night
Where I remained to rest And to say

I invoke you Evil
I invoke  Evil

Death then casted itâs spell
And told us to gather to spill the blood of a child
In rituals that tear down our souls
To enter the gates of the Finsterkult

Forsaken means nothing, no words no more
Symbols of power in circles of blood
I call them and bind them to swear to the dark
Possessed and obsessed, Echoes resoundâ¦

I invoke you Evil
I INVOKE OUR DEMONS!
I invoke you Evil
I invoke Evil
