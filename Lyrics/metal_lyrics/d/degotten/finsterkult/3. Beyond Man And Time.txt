6.000 feet beyond man and time
The mighty eagle still traces circles in the sky
This is the midday for mankind
The total-man shall finally arise

Print the seal of eternity on life
Listen to the chthonic voices inside!
They are calling from the very heart of Earth
I tell youâ¦
You shall live again!

I am the incarnation of unknown powers
All symbols are coming to me
IÂ´ll turn your science into black magic
The wheel of time doesnât count for me

I walk among the ashes of men
Cosmic mirrors are forever broken
The eternal recurrence of all things
Is through the third eye revealed.

Print the seal of eternity on life.
Listen to the chthonic voices inside!
They are calling from the very heart of Earth
I tell youâ¦
You shall live again!
