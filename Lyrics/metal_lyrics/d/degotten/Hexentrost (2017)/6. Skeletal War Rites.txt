Shivering child in fear
At dawn of evil night
Trumpets of death call
Soon their time to die
Fade back to the never
In lack of the light
Be aware of the coming
Of deadly fire rites

Demons of the Panzerforce
Have now begun to slay
All weak, all poor, all average
Just beasts are here to stay
Load your guns for the Battle
Raise your horns to the sky
Shield yourself with the might
Of the Skeletal War Rites
â¦.
Hurry those who have the guts
Immortal magic ride
Leave behind the somber ones
In pain they shall all die
As they ask for the never
In lack of the might
Be aware of the coming
Of deadly fire rites

Reject their fucking cries
And separate from their path
Drop your mask and grab your axe
To join the force of I
Load your guns for the Battle
Raise your horns to the sky
Shield yourself with the might
Of the Skeletal War Rites
â¦..
Obstructive lines of elegy
They vanish with my hate
Stabbed by nails of destiny
But not this time in vain

Shot down by the thunder force
Reborn eternal flame
Burned away by lightning thorns
Forever rise again
