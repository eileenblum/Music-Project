Darkness is falling from the sky
Fire is the only one that lights
Death winds destroy before my eyes
The forces of amok took this night

Blazing with hate, thereâs nothing to say
Infernal storm cuddles me, forever to stay
The forces of Satan shall wait for the day
Stunned by his spell I will forever remain

Doors of my shelter have been closed
Whispering to me never to return
Is this finally the path I seek?
Frozen in Blackstorm

Inhale the disease of power
That kills your heart
And let it spread like cancer
That drowns your soul
Face the fear and sorrow
That feeds your scars
Embrace them strongly
In the coldness of Blackstorm

My consciousness flows as a river black
Shadows of my mind stab my iced heart
Forever trapped in a timeless abyss
Frozen in Blackstorm

Blazing with hate, thereâs nothing to say
Infernal storm cuddles me, forever to stay
The forces of Satan shall wait for the day
Stunned by his spell I will forever remain
