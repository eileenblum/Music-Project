Gods of Death, face to face
Storm the gates of the earth
with restless pace
Flaming tongues lick off the
crowded ground
Raped by fire â Human worms die

Raping Fire
Rising!

Instincts fail, bestial rush
Turn off life with wide open eyes
Men shall fight
or pay the fucking price
Raped by fire â life will die!

Raping Fire
Blazing!

Why to warm the chamber
later to be burned?
If it only quells the urge
Why to spread your legs
to the wisdom of the world?
If true men are defined by war
Do not warm the chamber
break the course of lies
Use the sword
impose your words with power
Do not spread your legs
enforce your own tonight
Let the blood to fill the holes
with fire!

Boil your blood
unsheathe the hardened flesh
For the doglike laying whore
wonât submit
Enter demon state â
trigger weapon force
Raped by Fire â
finish mankind scourge

Raping Fire
Rising!
