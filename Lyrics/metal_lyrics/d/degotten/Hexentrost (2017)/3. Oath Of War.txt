Time weighs like a blade I can not wield
Nothing left to conquer, nothing left to achieve
Many ones I sent to a dream upon my steel
True glory only awaits for a fire undefeated

Oath of War!
Storm the gates of death

Years have passed but the blood never dried
Leading to the void as my spirit dies
Riding to a Battle in a trip of no return
Wine fuels my veins and hate leads my sword

Oath of War!
Storm the gates of death

No one ever saw the end of this maze
Standing against the tide, moving across the flames
And there, where the weak lay down to die
The truth of the strong was left to rise!

Burning a pyre as black as the night
From which even Phoenix could not ever rise
For all that has been, and all thatâs to be
I have being a killer, a betrayer and a thief

Oath of War!
Storm the gates of deathâ¦
