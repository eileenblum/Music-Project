There are too many slaves waiting to be freed
And they will surely die in the wait
An uncertain future is the only threat
For the ones who praise the weak

Misguided mortals, drown by the Maelstrom of life
Awake the titan inside, and face these black clouds

Redeemer of lost souls
Sows the seeds of destruction
That blind us before
The Skyless Reborn

Pain, Agony, Time, Death
Stop complaining!
Strenght, Power, Fight, Kill
Moving forward like a tank!

The white light comes from the depths, not from the sky
Reality will be erased and reconstructed in my own blood

Wolves walking beside me, vultures surrounding
Against the world, sight of ice, freeze their souls
I follow my way, hush de voices and shed de blood
As my darkest dream becomes your true defeat

Misguided mortals, drown by the Maelstrom of life
Awake the titan inside, and face these black clouds

Redeemer of lost souls
Sows the seeds of destruction
That blind us before
The Skyless Reborn
