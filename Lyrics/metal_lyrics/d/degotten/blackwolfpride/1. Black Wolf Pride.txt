Born unbound and ravenous like fire 
As if creator would have raped it fucking hard 
I can feel the speeding up desire 
For entering lifeÂ´s maze and tear apart 

Iâll determine my path 
Iâll write it down on stone 
Iâll ignore the riverâs wrath I live on my own! 

Now stand still and behold 
Iâm in search of the masterâs throne 
When I arrive you will feel the vibe 
Of the beast thatâs rising tonight 

Hail to the sword 
Fuck the whore 
Black Wolf Pride 
666 

Howling strong, awake for the battle 
Taking my last piss on the tide 
What seems so deep may not be In shallow waters starts my sea 

Iâll determine my path 
Iâll write it down on stone 
Iâll ignore the riverâs wrath I live on my own! 

Bitch, lie down and inhale the scent of power 
Feel the alpha horn inside 
Be deflowered between my jaws You worthless piece of shit 

Hail to the sword 
Fuck the whore 
Black Wolf Pride 
666
