The burden of time joined the endless fighting 
Branded in the memory of my blood 
She beheld the fall of many armies 
And her skies wept at the graves of my sons 

Enduring are now the deeds of my father 
Despite the overwhelming enemy march 
Under a bronze sky fate and death will gather To burn the scrolls and crush the ark 

No names 
No faces 
No history 
No exitâ¦ 

The ancient thunder still resounds 
Here, on the slopes of the hills 
The storm of Baal inflected the wound 
Carring the voices of an immortal realm 

If you are not blood be the sword 
Where i walk all kings fall to kneel 
If you are not dead be the stone 
Where i stand all legions shall fall 

The land of night eternal 
This is my country and here I face the dusk 
Held on to the name of valour 
This is my country and here I face the dusk 

Titans walked this land before the swords 
And time now finds me at the very wolfÂ´s fangs At the very wolfÂ´s fangs! 

âMy roots were entrenched before the birth of time 
And before the opening of the erasâ (M.D.) 

I am the voice calling from far beyond the sun, Beyond the stones and the fury of the ages 

My name came out from the void across eternity My breath is a mountains roar 

I am but a violent stream I lead the fate of Lions 

Where i walk all kings fall to kneel 
Where i stand all legions shall fall
