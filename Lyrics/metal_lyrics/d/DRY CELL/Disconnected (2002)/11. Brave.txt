Reach out! Nothing's there, I can't see
Black out! Gets so cold I can't breathe
Who's there? I'm sweating, though I'm freezing
I'm scared, I'm venting, releasing
Rewind! Just enough to know what's behind
Does anybody know trust?
In fact, has anybody seen me?
Look back! Life is but a daydream

Satellite's receiving
Are all my loved ones grieving?
And does it matter at all?

If I was brave enough to fall
I'd find the answers
But now my back's against the wall
Forever
Big world and I am feeling small
The slow are faster
And I know I don't have it all
Together

Today everybody's slacking
Within I wish that I was back in
High school where everything's easy
No cares, just childhood teasing
In fact, now it gets depressing
Relax. Everything is stressing
I don't know if I can take this
But I'm somehow gonna make it through

Satellite's receiving
Are all my loved ones grieving?
And does it matter at all?

If I was brave enough to fall
I'd find the answers
But now my back's against the wall
Forever
Big world and I am feeling small
The slow are faster
And I know I don't have it all
Together

Go ahead and look at me now
It's like I'm stuck in between
Getting up or just falling down
Is anyone there to catch me?

If I was brave enough to fall
I'd find the answers
But now my back's against the wall
Forever
Big world and I am feeling small
The slow are faster
And I know I don't have it all
Together

If I was brave enough to fall
Let's fall together
