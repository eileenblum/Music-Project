Finally recover
And the mood is right
Looking up into a neon sky
The child in me takes over
Guess it's been too long
Since the last time that I tried to fly

Finally I find
When I lose control
Inside my body crumbles
It's like therapy for my broken soul
Inside my body crumbles

All I need's a moment
A chance to get away
From the stressfulness of every day
Know if I don't question
And I never doubt
Everything is gonna be okay

Is it okay to be myself
Why do we always have to fight
It's alright

Finally I find
When I lose control
Inside my body crumbles
It's like therapy for my broken soul
Inside my body crumbles
