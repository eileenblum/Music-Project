Day
Day of reflection
After day
A life of rejection
Slip away
Sometimes I need to
Slip away
Want you

Say
Say that you'll help me
Please don't you let me
Slip away
Sometimes I need to
Slip away

Are you
So far gone
Every time it starts I try to slip away
So far gone
Every time it starts
Finally when I'm at my end
Something inside is gonna break you... Stand up
Nothing's like it was before
I so wish I could just pretend
Something inside is gonna break you... Stand up
But there is nothing left to adore

Time
To be remembered
After time
Something I'll never
I find
Whatever I do
Defy

Do you
Take
World that I live in
And take
I'll never give in
Slip away
Whatever I do
Slip away
Love you

So far gone
Every time it starts I try to slip away
So far gone
Every time it starts
I don't understand this world that we are living in
People give you things so they can take them back again
I don't want to be part of history
I just want my life to be the way that it should be
Every now and then I find a way to slip away
Cuz every now and then there's only so much I can take
If I find a way I would leave today

Way
Day of reflection
Home
Life of rejection
I don't know if I can find my
Way
Say that youll help me
Home
Please don't you let me
Though it's hard sometimes I still try
Way
Day of reflection
Home
Life of rejection
I don't know if I can find my way
