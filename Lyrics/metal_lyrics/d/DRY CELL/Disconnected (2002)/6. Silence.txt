I believe that I'm hanging by a string
And I'm feeling so small in a world full of big things
Undone and I'm ready to explode on the things I don't know
And I just want to let go

Understand that the way that I am
Is a product of the scam that you pulled on the last man
Undone and I'm ready to explode on the things I don't know
And I just want to let go

Surprise my eyes were open
Don't suffocate what's broken
Are you ever done?
Are you ever free?
Silence makes me numb without you

You believe that you're changing everything
And you're feeling so tall that you can't even see me
Undone and I'm ready to explode on the things I don't know
And I just want to let go

Understand that the way that I am
Is a product of the way that you underplay my hand
Undone and I'm ready to explode on the things I don't know
And I just want to let go

Surprise my eyes were open
Don't suffocate what's broken
Are you ever done?
Are you ever free?
Silence makes me numb without you
How can this go on?
Take it all from me
Silence makes me numb without you

Never meant to cause you pain
Fighting, aggravation
Causing suffocation
I won't let you
Surprise my eyes were open
Don't suffocate what's broken
Are you ever done?
Are you ever free?
Silence makes me numb without you
How can this go on?
Take it all from me
Silence makes me numb without you
