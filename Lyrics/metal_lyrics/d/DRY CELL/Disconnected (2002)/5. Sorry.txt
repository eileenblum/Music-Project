I don't want a change inside of me
In respect to effect your life
As we both grow cold (we both grow cold)
It's the very first time that I can see
Would you believe in me
If I told you so (if I told you so)

Now you know how sorry feels
Now you know how sorry feels
Now you know how sorry feels
Now you know how sorry feels

A little bit of space you said you needed
You cheated, repeated, conceitedness (conceitedness)
You say you made a big mistake, you fake
But I won't take you back
For you're too much mess (you're too much mess)

Everything you find, you want to take, take
Everything that's mine you want to go, go
If it doesn't shine, you think it's fake, fake
I'll be doing fine and you won't and now you know

Now you know how sorry feels
Now you know how sorry feels
Now you know how sorry feels
Now you know how sorry feels

Now you know
