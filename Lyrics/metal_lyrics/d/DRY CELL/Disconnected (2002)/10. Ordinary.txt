I saw a vision of you (today)
And I won't do anything to make you feel betrayed

Can't find the time to look inside
And realize that I can't hide
I can't be me unless you're there
This situation's so unfair
I look at you and tell myself
That you're with me and no one else
You need some help
If not for you than for myself

It's hard to be honest with myself
I need some time so I can figure out
So I won't be ordinary (ordinary)
I solved the mystery of you (today)
And I don't show everything to everyone that way
Can't find the time to look inside
And realize that I can't hide
I can't be me unless you're there
This situation's so unfair
I look at you and tell myself
That you're with me and no one else
You need some help
If not for you than for myself

It's hard to be honest with myself
I need some time so I can figure out
So I won't be ordinary (ordinary)
I solved the mystery of you (today)
And I don't show everything to everyone that way
I can't decide if I'm all right
I feel inside I need some help
But I'll deny the things I hide
If not for you than for myself
I know there's better ways to be

It's not easy and it's hard
It's hard to be honest with myself
I need some time so I can figure out
So I won't be ordinary
So I won't be ordinary
'Cause I'm not ordinary
