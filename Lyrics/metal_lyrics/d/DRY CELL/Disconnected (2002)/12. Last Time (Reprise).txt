They say it's true
Something's not right
They laugh at you
Hurting all the time and you just don't know why
Destined to lose
It's not right
What can you do?
All you do is fight and you're losing your insight

It's alright
It's okay
You're never far away
It's so real
It's so right
This is the last time
Hurting all the time
And you just don't know why

Who made this true?
No, its not right
You make it through
Hurting all the time
And you just don't know why
They don't know you
Not inside
They have issues
Fighting all the time
Has made them lose their insight

This is the last time

So fall asleep
Be peaceful as you lay
Forget about the world
You're going to be okay

Fighting all the time
And you just don't know why
This could be the last time

They say it's true
Something's not right
They laugh at you
Hurting all the time and you just don't know why
