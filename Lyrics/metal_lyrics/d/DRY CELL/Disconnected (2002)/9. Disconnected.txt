Jilted- From a place in the back of my mind
There's no time for a reconcile
Tilted- In a way that I cannot define
Gonna take what I know is mine

Close your eyes and watch me fly
Everything I've left behind
All I want is piece of mind
DISCONNECTED
How in the world did I get so free
Nothing's gonna get to me
Cause I'm far too happily
DISCONNECTED

Deny- All the shame that you're feeling inside
Runaway from the sense you hide
Don't try- We don't all suffer from lack of pride
So get back to your so-called life

Close your eyes and watch me fly
Everything I've left behind
All I want is piece of mind
DISCONNECTED
How in the world did I get so free
Nothing's gonna get to me
Cause I'm far too happily
DISCONNECTED

All of my life
Answering to someone else
Living to die
Never asked for your help
Buried inside
It was here once nevermore
Nowhere to hide
I'm still alive, won't die

To get rid of this pain
I gotta fight, fight
To get rid of you
Is my right, right
Take it away
I don't need this anymore
It's time to delay
My disconnected life

Close your eyes and watch me fly
Everything I've left behind
All I want is piece of mind
DISCONNECTED
How in the world did I get so free
Nothing's gonna get to me
Cause I'm far too happily
DISCONNECTED

Close your eyes and watch me fly
Everything I've left behind
All I want is piece of mind
DISCONNECTED
How in the world did I get so free
Nothing's gonna get to me
Cause I'm far too happily
DISCONNECTED
