I just want you to know
That I want you to be safe
Was it fate?
No, I can't remember
So much pain in the world
I hate feeling this way
They took you away

I wish that I could be strong
I wish that I could be brave
I wish that I could be over and over
True to the world
Another summer fades away

Forever beautiful
Don't ever think that I could not appreciate
We all come full circle
Whatever I'm to give
I'll only complicate

I just want you to know
It isn't easy to face
It's growing vague
But I will remember
I hear your voice every day
It doesn't seem quite the same
Took you away
From me

I wish that you weren't gone
I wish that you could be saved
I wish that you could be over and over
True to the world
Another summer fades away

Forever beautiful
Don't ever think that I could not appreciate
We all come full circle
Whatever I'm to give
I'll only complicate

This isn't over
There's no way
I'm still denying everything
This can't be right
And possibly...
I don't know if I'll ever

Forever beautiful
Don't ever think that I could not appreciate
We all come full circle
Whatever I'm to give
I'll only complicate
