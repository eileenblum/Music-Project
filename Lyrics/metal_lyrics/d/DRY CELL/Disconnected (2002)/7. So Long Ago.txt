I was thinking back today
And I remember everything
Like all the things we used to say

I will be
And I will show
Follow me wherever I go

But that was so long ago
You assume that I've forgotten
But how could I ever forget you?
I know I'm having trouble letting go
Though it was so long ago

I was over you today
But now I've dug up everything
Sometimes it seems so hard to face

I will be
And I will show
Follow me wherever I go

You're the sunlight on my face
And you're the one I can't replace
And everything just seems to fall apart without a trace
But that was so long ago
You assume that I've forgotten
But how could I ever forget you?
I know I'm having trouble letting go
Though it was so long ago
