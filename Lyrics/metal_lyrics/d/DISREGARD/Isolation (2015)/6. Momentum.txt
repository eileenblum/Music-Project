Becoming psychotic from the ashes of your soul. Your deception of free will leads us to damnation.
My hallucinatory reality, and my senses are becoming more real and shapeless. Bereft of my senses, as they cry. This is what you become, monstrous.
From beginning the shape of the eyeless. Processing the brains of the creation.
Embolizing with influence of the gods. Taking the soul and point it to the sky.
Mortally introvert people encaged in this prison of lies and the misapprehension of hope, leaving. Deceive yourself that all that is around you will dissolve or fall into place. It might.

You are leaving

I will part from this sanity, from the perception of reality,
Creating my own existence beyond comprehension.
Reborn into a new realm where, my dreams are.
Lucid, vivid, stronger, all-embracing.
Lucid, vivid, stronger, all-embracing.

For one brief moment, I felt like a god.
My nebulous thoughts, as they appear from my inner self.
Fragile as they deplete from my memory.
Tattered and like my temple it stands, forever.
Forever.
But I am no one to judge, for I have seen reality
I am hypnotised, I am trapped in my dream.
The jury of my fears.
Fears.
Momentum, the wheel of chaos. Eradication of your being.
Complete apocalypse, erasing your spirit, nothingness in you.
Eye of the tornado, The calm before the storm.
Becoming psychotic from the ashes of your soul. Your deception of free will leads us to damnation.
My hallucinatory reality and my senses are becoming more real and shapeless. Bereft of my senses as they cry. This is what you become, monstrous.
