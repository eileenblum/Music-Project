Disease, anxiety, unreflected. Crippled and lying in despair.
Oh maker, I will dissolve.
My marrow bones, this hostility.
Struck down to ash.

I cannot commit to a sacred life, carnation and biblical fanatics.
I believe in a much higher purpose. There no man can walk or utter a word.
In a world that man has misunderstood. Where spiritual perspective will bloom.

Time in essence, radical treatment, Eisa is in que.
Cell renewal, controlling the bleeding.
God give us bread.

I am nothing of what I was before.
Something has changed me
I, renewed man.
Who am I now.

Destroying me. Will lead you into damnation.
I am here. Feeling totally misunderstood.
This earth is controlled by monkeys, that has destroyed our society.
Change is present. But will I hold.

I am, nothing of what I was before.
Something has changed me
I, renewed man.
Who am I now.

Why am I here.

Where is my heart.
Have you taken it from me?
Where is my heart.
If it isn't with you.
