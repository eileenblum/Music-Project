Into the void between the atoms. Percept the motions of what you see, thy entities that you erase from your memories.

I am one, the solutions in your dreams,
I will perish in your matter.
I am hidden in your thoughts.
I will create, unconscious.

Into the void between the atoms. Perceive the motions of what you see, thy entities that you erase from your memories.
The world will perish and bleed. Into my soul as perception is unaware. I am Grey, I am life. I am death.

I feel the fire inside me, my world seems so endless, my body evaporates.
As the voices echo trough my ears, I am deaf I am life, maker., the making is now done, make our worlds come together, now separate.

"We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita; Vishnu
Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."
[Oppenheimer]

Sun
Oh sun
Now separate
Son
Separate
