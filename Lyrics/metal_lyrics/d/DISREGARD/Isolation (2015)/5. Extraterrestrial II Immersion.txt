Willing not to dominate but set terra free.
Extra-terrestrial come, from the womb of the liquid.
Make your will come forth. Born from the blood.
Blackened oil. Crumble our earth, liberate.

(Follow the limp, follow the limp, general)
(Follow the limp, follow the limp, general)

"Light bearer come to me, am I light bearer"

This matter, shatter from the wounded men of Kali, Vishnu.

On the crying ridges,
The fateful betrayal,
Worthy not for a single abduction.
Society bows down to the throne.
Cleansing our souls, evidence burnt.

To the galaxy of the greys, shall we wander along with righteousness. Though our feelings are shattered, the light shall accompany us all. Trough the unknown sphere.

(Follow the limp, follow the limp general)
(Follow the limp, follow the limp general)

Onward to battle, with the gods.
World is unchained, cloven society.
To the encrypted scriptures, marching with our governed minds.
Believing the oppression words of the democracy. Unwilling to believe the prophecy of truth.
This matter. Shatter from the wounded men, of Kali, Vishnu.
