Sum of all fears
I stand alone, I will make you see the truth. I will make your world burn. I am the possession. I am watching.
Your pathetic life.
I am nothing, you won't make me. I am a delusion of hope and you won't let me in your life. Tear down the statues of angels, and make the false prophets, slit their own throats, I am not real.
I won't let you, destroy my creation.

Let me hear you scream, erase all of hope, let my wings go numb, your polluted breath.
I am not real. I am not
I stand alone, I will make you see the truth.
I will make your world burn.
I am the possession, I am watching.
Whispering in your ear,
You will come to me, and I will make you warm
I will make you feel the fire, burning.
In yourself, feel the hate, transpire.
Your life is temporary, now you must choose.
I am real though you can't see me, your feelings are introvert and you won't listen when I speak. Your ego is becoming an obstruction. Now I'm entering this body to show you the real enlightenment of your own world.
I stand alone, I will make you see the truth. I will make your world burn. I am the possession, I am watching. From your eyes.
