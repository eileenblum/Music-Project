At the height of our evolution, our imagined enlightenment, we saw a glimpse of truth. Our reality demolished, millennia erased, visions blinded, and we fell.
Our machines worthless, our weapons without impact. Paralyzed we watched.
The mirrors cracked, the metal melted, naked, we understood.
We are liberated servants, domesticated cattle, sacrificial slaughter, denial, eradication.
Resist defy, my liberated cry, my occupied soul, governed by fright.
System, breaking, going under the banner, of desertion, absence of sovereignty.

Our machines worthless, our weapons without impact, paralyzed, we watched.
The mirrors cracked, the metal melted, naked, we understood.

System, breaking, going under the banner, of desertion, absence of sovereignty.
To the winds of creation, we know nothing, of the new world.
New world order.
