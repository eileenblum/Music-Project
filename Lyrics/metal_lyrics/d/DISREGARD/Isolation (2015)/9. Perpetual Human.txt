Whisper and echoes from divinity.
Surrounding in an orchestra.
Will is becoming your ego.
My thoughts are incomplete.

Flesh and bone, we hath done unblessed. Maketh surpass my mistakes and heal me. Oppress my motion until I complete. Burdens shall be undone by the sword.

The symbols of right shall company your soul. Don't let though be fooled, though I am not.

Scriptures of false, nor thy feelings is right.

Our sun, our son. Come to me.
Not until thy fight is done.
Not until thy fire burns.

We are the sons, that can make our world burn. Believe this will not be your former life, ashas.
Human, Sun.
Human, Son.
For the false is upon you. Thy power of thy flesh will haunt you.
