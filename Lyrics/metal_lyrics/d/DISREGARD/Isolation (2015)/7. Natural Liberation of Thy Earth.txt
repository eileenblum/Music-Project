"We are suffering... "
Evolution, making
Fires, exploding
Glaciers, melting.
I am, nothing
The earth crumbles.
Atoms derails from the fires of eternity. The vibrations will succumb to my fears. My soul is connected through our soil. Yield to destruction and give in.
Ruined souls, ruined earth, weeping in anxiety. Manipulated man, empty companions, withered earth, withered soil, empty his cup, existence derailed, trembling in agony.
Crawling from despair, faulting government, lying congress, a defeated leader.
Ruination, my defeated intentions, Apocalypse, misanthropic Eden.
Atoms derails from the fires of eternity. The vibrations will succumb to my fears. My soul is connected through our soil. Inevitable rapture comes forth.
Unworthy messiah, unholy prophets, scriptures manipulated with blood,
Marching with agony, within control, natural liberation of thy earth.
Ruined souls, ruined earth, weeping in anxiety. Manipulated man, empty companions. Withered earth, withered soil, empty his cup, existence derailed, trembling in agony.
Eyes bleak, the sun dies, imploding earth, crumble my body.
Dreams shattered, races extinct, morality restored, Salvation.
Leaving behind, all the work, useless monuments,
Tear down myself, transition interrupted, Fearing entities, of the ancient.
Like the arms of Kali, oh the limbs of Vishnu, let them embrace the realms, let them tear through our stones. Let them fear those who do fear them. Fearless I walk, Shiva, let them hear the roars, of kingdom.

You won't reach until it's done and over.
We are the one, who will make our world, come together.
As it crumbles and kneels, under our feet.
The blood, spills from its veins. And our salvation, Will succumb to despair.
Lose your ego, or lose your soul. The transition is not for both.

Like the arms of Kali, oh the limbs of Vishnu, let them embrace the realms, let them tear trough our stones, let them fear those who do fear them. Fearless I walk, Shiva, let them hear the roars, of kingdom.
