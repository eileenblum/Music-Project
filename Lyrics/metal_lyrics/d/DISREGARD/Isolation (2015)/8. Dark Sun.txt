This is the end of the time we have spent. Of all those of womb who have perished.
This is all what we are in time. The sun will appear as you plead.

Ambition of the fear in isolation. Of thy folks that speak false through the tongue.
Oppression is now immersing from heart and soul as it is false, so false.

Dark sun oppress me, dark son, Iscariot, dark sun, thy false, will make you as it were.
As you did and as you do, the fear in dark sun burning. As you will, you will.
Let it speak, let it pronounce, without tongue.
Let us bleed, let thy head be done.

Ambition of the fear in isolation. Of thy folks thy speak false through thy tongue.
Oppression is now immersing from heart and soul, as it is false, so false.
What we perceive and who we understand, makes us half of ourselves, as we are or could have been. Who we are now is superior.

Oh, sun, oh son, oh perceive my making
Oh Son, oh sun, understand me.
Oh sun, oh son, conclude me.

Matter, sun, dark sun.
Son, oh sun, my Son
Matter, sun, oh dark sun.
