Save me from my humanity
Save me from my human self
I will submit to computer god
And give myself away to you

Double click for friendship
Double click for love
Salvation is under my palm
Click here for serenity
Double click for security
Bliss was here all along

Blessed with this new gift
Bestowed onto me
Everything I want
Within my grasp
Nothing but self
Is sacred to me

Click here for power
Click here for sex
Email to make sure I keep all my friends
Double click for comfort
Double click for all
Cyberlord you heard my call

Giving a window for them to look through
Sacrifice privacy, all that you do
How you live and what you think
Delete your freedom
Click by fucking click

Click here
Click here for all life to fall
Click here
Click here for the enslavement and death of us all
Delete environment
Delete the mind
Humans will kill themselves given the time
Cries of "what happened?"
Or did you forget?
Your fingerprints are human
And you are a piece of shit
