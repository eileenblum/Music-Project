Take a long look at the past to unlock a greater future
Sift through the wreckage of failures
In the hope to make things better
Like more efficient ways to kill in the name of human progress
How to crawl and crush the will
So that no one dares to question.

So what of the past and this "so called" better future?
If past and future don't exist then where does that leave us?
Lost in a quagmire of lies built upon the lies of before
Echoing endless through time
These legends of false perception

Identities lie... built on ego and habit
Beliefs kill. why are these institutions sacred?
So what of the past and this "so called" better future?
If past and future don't exist where the fuck does that leave us?
To bathe in the excrement of old and back in the "glory" of what is to be

I hang my head in sorrow because the now is too disgusting to see
The past does not exist.
Only the now remains

The future is a myth
Only the now remains
The past does not exist

Only the now remains

The future is a myth
Only the now remains

Genocide was someone's now
A tool to make things better
Once a madman's future, a vision that has ended
Atrocities are mimicked, carried forth to this day
Only names and faces have been changed

But the now remains the same

The past does not exist
Only the now remains
The future is a myth
Only the now remains

The past does not exist

Only the now remains

The future is a myth
Only the now remains
