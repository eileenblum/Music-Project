[originally by Carcinogen]Love your god. God loves all
So called "love" is so confused
So called love starts all wars... racism... genocide
Jesus, fuck your love
Based on a book with no interpretation
Liar, user, faker
Use this tool to rape and fuck this nation

America, where's your love?
Show your love with the deaths of many?
Country founded on the bloodshed.
Keep the masses fighting over money

Fuck you. You're a lie and I won't be part of it
Trust you. I will not bow.
I've seen too much to ever fucking love you
Faith built on other's pain

Christian: another way of spelling genocide
Conquest: the name of god
Nation: controlled by the moral right
Based on all that is wrong

Love for country, love for system
So called "love" is so confused
So called love murdered million, justified
The death of your son

And you'll never be happy
Fuck your love

Jesus, fuck your love, and the USA
Nailed to your cross, it should have been a dollar sign

We can't be part of you, hate all that you do
No love I can see, for god or country.
