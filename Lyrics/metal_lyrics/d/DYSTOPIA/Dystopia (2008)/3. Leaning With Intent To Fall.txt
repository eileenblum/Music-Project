Another friend found dead in the street
A painful death of self-defeat
The reaper killed by the seeds that were sown
Another mother destined to be alone
See the world through sunken eyes
Infected soul, infected brain
Feel your flesh turn stone cold
And endless downward spiral of misery and pain is what remains

You used to do that shit for fun
A steady march of slow death
With no intention of turning back
Feel the pleasure, you taste the pain
Getting high just to get sick again
You don't seem to be having much fun
Wake up, wake up from this lucid dream
Nightmares, nightmares are what the future brings

See your spirit fly with the angels
Fall from the heavens
Fall through your fingers

You say you're hurting? I'm hurting too
Am I to love you? I hate the things you do
You say it's over. you say you're sober
You're fucking clean
And then you fucking O.D.?

So you chose to take your life away
Suicide is an easier way
See the world through sunken eyes
We tried to change the path you were on
Feel your flesh turn stone cold
A night alone, a spoon, a needle in the arm, and now you're gone

Can you climb out of this hole that you've dug?
I wish I could help you but I can't
Watching through my eyes is misery
Dying in your eyes, that's all I see

See your shadow fall from heavens
Fall through your fingers
Fade into nothing
