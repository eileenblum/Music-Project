Rape consume exhaust abuse
rob the earth of fossil fuels
we kill ourselves with fossil fuels
Think weâve tried we failed we die
With our hands tied
Canât you see we have no choice
you lie about the true effects
Lies... expose the facts that you canât hide
Please, donât insult our intelligence
hemp is illegal cause it threatens your wealth
DuPont Exxon and a thousand other companies
Would rather see you die than lose money for your health
price of living
Funeral procession
Modern ecology
I wonât bow
I wonât bow and sit and sigh
cowards
the world goes to shit as you sit and cry
bigotry apartheid Jim crow laws
tools of prohibition to put hemp in its place
Put a black man in shackles
because he smokes weed and had a smile on his face
Fucking racists
fuel oil plastic
all from a plant that natures blessing
paper wood food
stop deforestation save this planet
Now, we must utilize a source that can be grown with ease
Save our habitat and stop killing wildlife and soil by removing trees
Land is in scarce supply and hemp roots help anchor soil
Which stops erosion nutrifies land while rainforests spoil
we must put aside myths and legends based on lies
Hemp the weed of wisdom will help wipe a tear from natures eyes
