with all the flaws of technology 
we are forced to destroy 
to keep with our "needs" 
but our needs are superficial cause the best things in life are the things that
are free 
solar energy is perfect 
it's abundant and free 
But they cannot sell the sun
so they pollute the air we breathe 
if there's gas burning over that then there's money to be made 
It doesn't matter if we choke
just as long as they're paid 
humanity is digging it's own grave 
from the master in his high rise 
to his hunched over slaves 
we are all to blame 
we're all wasteful and greedy 
In our own ways

Examine your actions retrace your steps
the oblivious fool is the fool who breeds death 
You cannot attack the whole until you kill the fool inside
so much can be done 
But you must first use your mind
you'll never be perfect unless you drop out of life 
You're guilty just the same
We must realize we're either making things worse or helping things changeâ¦

there is no better place 
save the earth 
why all die in misery 
Break the chain
we can't change in our graves 
save the earth 
And we're damned to count on you
Break the chain
