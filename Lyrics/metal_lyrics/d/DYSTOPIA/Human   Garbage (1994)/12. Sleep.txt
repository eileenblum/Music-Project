searching for my soul
through chasms of my minds
longing my own desire
to make me apart of life
round and round this circle turns
never coming to end
hideous games played on my mind
driving me insane
This ring of painful delight
resides deep within my brain
Insanity comes so naturally
when my arms bleed
crossing the sky
deep within these dreams
crashing back to the sea
the sleep numbs my mind
From todayâs reality

sleep
the dreams will come true
my life will be over soon
Sleep my child and dream
sleep
Your life is doomed
