hands that kill mold illusions of peace
their fucked up pseudo-security
destroy to give birth to technology
to quicken the killing of you and me and him and her

blind. us humans think we are so smart
creating challenges
how. our sky bleeds in your hands
it's nothing

build and build and build some more
industry fucks nature like some kind of whore
quest for invention intelligence gone too far
synthetic environment we're doomed from the start

and I guess we're all gonna die (my home)
and take everything under the sky (is nothing... to you)

skies they bleed infecting the land
oceans they vomit onto the sand
wind so foul, a putrid reek
animals they scream in disbelief

and I guess we're all gonna die (our lives)
and take everything under the sky (are nothing... just used)

humanicide // humanicide

black trees, dead seeds, dirt weed
how much longer do we have?

humanicide
human beings should have never evolved at all
your heart... your heart as cold as the concrete that you lay
your mind... clouded with the pollution that you make

hide... lies... from all of us, the ones you have chosen to die
smother our earth, blacken the skies
your quest for progress, convenient demise

man... kind... to whom are you kind?
the peace that you mold is a lie, a lie, all lies
our lives float rejected down the stream
they are nothing, not you or me
