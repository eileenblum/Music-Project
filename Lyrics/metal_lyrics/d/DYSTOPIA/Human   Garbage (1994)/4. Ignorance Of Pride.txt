you killed again today
she was 12 years old
you killed her mother too
when she bent down to help her
and you killed again today
He overdosed on drugs
he was a friend of mine
I know that you donât care
except for money and power
and the force to make everyone cower
the system makes its money off you
kill each other off just like they want you to

Ways to survive donât involve killing your kind
poverty is colorblind
the systems fault not yours or mine

Kill again - for more respect
Kill some more - to make you look tougher
Kill again - but look who is losing
poverty is government made
Kill again - for more respect
Kill some more - to make you look tougher
Kill again - but look who is losing
stomping out your own fucking race
racism starts with a twisted idea
genocide starts with the squeeze of a trigger
both are easy to do
both are fucking stupid
