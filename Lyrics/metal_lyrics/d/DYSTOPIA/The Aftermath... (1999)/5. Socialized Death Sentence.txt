i am just a fucking slave
bust my ass for minimum wage
before im paid...
the system comes and takes half away...
for bombs someday
my boss hates my fucking guts
i was never good enough
if im injured on the job
he'll say tough luck
he'll find someone else to fuck
my job... my life
landlords pissed, rent is due
havent worked in a few
i dont pay i get evicted
im fucking screwed
what am i suppose to do
each day... i die
your..... your job sucks
the system fucks
a timeclock head...im dead
employed... mind void
destroyed... cant avoid
i try... to survive
...losing...
work work
socialized death sentence
system system
fucked all around
work work
like taking cyanide
system system
washing it down...
and i die again tomorrow...
when i wake up
