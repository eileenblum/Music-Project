endless voices
shattered thoughts that cloud my head
sleepless nights of agony
wretched and twitching in a pool of sweat
searching for the words to say
babble spills out of my mouth
starring into space
i didnt hear what you said
i wish i could explain whats wrong with me
why cant i think straight
im lost because i think to much
about...
misery of life
no esteem from proding eyes
my confidence mistakes
scarred to sleep or stay awake
lifetimes pass in a blink of an eye
i am dumbfucked
all my pride sucked
i fight to gain control
of what the fututre holds
but im fucking lost
because i think to much
about misery
of life no esteem from proding eyes
my confidence mistakes
scarred to sleep or stay awake
lifetimes pass in a blink of an eye
i ambumbfucked
all my pride sucked
nails dig into my head
tossing and turning in my bed
biting my lips
blood stained mouth
need something more to calm me down
will i end up dead
or can i digest it all this shit im fed
endured for so long
i am suprised that ive made it this far
in my lifetime
i watch people waste their lives away
it makes me sick
to think i could end up like them
but i wont
