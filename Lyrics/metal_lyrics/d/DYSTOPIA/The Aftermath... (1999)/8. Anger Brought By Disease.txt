if i die from a disease
when i die im taking you with me
maybe tomorrow or when im fifty
misanthropic
hate you like i hate me
show no pitty for me
you show no pitty for me
you hate me anyway
now i must kill you
motherfucker
stripped of my pride my dignity
my rational thought
revenge i seek
(pay) for your existence during my existence
(pay) for being at the wrong place at the wrong time
(pay) for your existence during my existence
(pay) for being at the wrong place at the wrong time
maybe you know me always such a quiet boy
or maybe you hate me
never thought id amount to anything
maybe youre the nazi fuck that i dont like
maybe youre the teacher that kicked me out of school
maybe youre the pig that kicked my ass
maybe youre the fat fuck boss who got me fired
the pain of never reaching my dreams
a pain ive suffered all my fucking life
diseased i am not of man kind
i die and i take you at the same time
