eduacation stable career
join the army
become a murderer
kill for god and country
return to be a hero
to tell you the truth
i hope you dont come back
courage
it takes a big man to push a button
fight with your honor
like shotting children
and cutting their parents throats
go to the frontline
watch your friends
get cooked by napalm
and theyre murderers just like you
getting education by killing people too
bodies blown apart
you feel a sharp pain in your stomach
now youve lost both of your legs to a grenade
blood and vomit spew from your mouth
no career education
and youre sent home in a doggy bag
waste your life
while taking others lives away from them
left so empty
just a pile of shit to me
and your parents looking stupid
their son reduced to a pile of shit and dog tags
but he did what he was programmed to do
such a good soldier
i hope youre fucking proud of your son
fuck your son i hope he fucking dies
