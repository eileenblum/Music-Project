malignant cancer of the ecosystem
gnawing at a mother
children she loves
cankered womb and body
nurtures a pathogen
that feeds too much
no respect for life
endless degredation
of the whole environment
generalist species
adaption comes so easily
feeding on all that lives
theres no end to what it eats
withstands natures forces
affluent where ever it lives
ending symbiotic relationships
it takes and takes and never gives
slowly spreading the cancer
leaving scars
erected buildings and industry
aviation freeways and cars
no respect for some
all for profit mentality
the end of earth has begun
the tumors feed and grow
all the land turns to stone
biodiversity reduced
from a parasites abuse
the airs not safe to breathe no more
oceans push bodies on the shore
ecosystem that was built
poisoned by a mother milk
and there is nothing it cant endure
every sickness theres a cure
consuming all that exists
blackened brown beauty drowns in cicts
a mothers body covered in sores
a putrid odor reeks from pores
with her fever running high
human dont die off we fucking multiply
we are hazardous to all life
population multiplies
nothing kills us in the end
this blight abominations genocide
total annihilation of human parasites
world healing chemotherapy
put an end to natures blight famine
mass starvation limiting factors of our own
natures savior human error
population birth control
