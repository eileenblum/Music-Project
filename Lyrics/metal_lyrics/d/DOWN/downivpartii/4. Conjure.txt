Snort the powder of Ibn Ghazi line up on ash, trembling swiftly
Weekly rising, taking the nightmares somewhere
Stripping it clean, drag it clean into the the system
The blind business that blinds a voice that's not a voice
Waiting in the old place serpents of vacation wind to the feet
Beware the conjure beware the conjure

The bulk of mortals walk alone with Eidolon unseen and foul
It's the lock under the deeps take a look at the blood that drips
Expectation of a blow servants of mission on to defeat
It's all the conjure

Now commencing blasphemy is addicted trail
In glory spread death on now come and see
Cut off spectrum, intercourse a terrible thing to hear
No earth born free not insane of this fear now the wisdom is born without guidance
A blind business that blinds a choice without choice
Waiting in the old place servants of occasion want to defeat
Beware the conjure beware the conjure

Beware the conjure beware the conjure
Beware the conjure because in the end, you will find out you cannot win
