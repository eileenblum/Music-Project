Dark of December lying with wraith of the dying times
Cries in unison sing with the sufferer's breathing spoil
Match that fleeting toil and catch the fleeing soul
And open the gate fold graves I hate this time of year
A recall of long gone names I hate this time of year through the suffering all

Stark doom impendor draught in home and tomb entwine
Cries in unison sing with the sufferer's heaving lull
Match that beating's toll and catch the fleeing soul
Falling from an attic helped to feet dead

Dark of December rattle shrunken over glazing eyes
Cries in unison sing with the sufferer's breathing spoil
Match that fleeting toil and catch the fleeing soul
If you can open the gate fold graves I hate this time of year
To visit the ghosted names I hate this time of year
Through the suffering all falling from an attic helped to feet dead
Cries in unison sing years count
