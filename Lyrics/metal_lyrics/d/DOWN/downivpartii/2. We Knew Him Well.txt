Consume it All....

So Drink up!

Distrust the honest
Say enough to be hanged
From Troubled Tree tops
Word of Death to Men

Was it not good enough?
A ten year steep decline
Tangled in a mother's mother's mother.
A history of a brother

Distrust the honest
Say enough to blind
Genius Eccentric
Sympa-fucking-thetic

Hedonistic headlock
Versus old better times

Control with anothers other other
Ripped out hearts of brothers

Distrust the honest
self ??? anxiety
subsided into lethargy
self confessed to fate

rise up good luck
rise up good luck
rise up good luck
