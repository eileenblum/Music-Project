Hogshead matted bastard loading pitchforks for war
World brain bite me blood red corner is the head of the dog

Lantern of spotlight habit caved in like an eggshell
World brain bite me blood mist colour in the head of a hog

Making a devil right palm leaf wizard's smite rides on
Making a devil right annul the deep malign
Put a match to the prisons but the damned can't burn despite
Put a hammer to the human the reap biding its time drops

Dogs head matter factor caved in pitchforks of war world brain bite me
Blood red corner is the head of the dog
Blood mist colour in the head of a hog
