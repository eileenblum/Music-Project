The 1800s, before the inception
Of modern day ideals
Fake grip of appeals
Straight to the street run, no barroom virgin
Double vision, cocaine
To a whorehouse of pain

New Orleans is a dying whore
Naked she sleeps on my floor
New Orleans is a dying whore

The spreading highway
To the underwater staircase
Leading up to a black room
To leave there you're a fool
Mob world politics
So broke it can't fix
Trapped in a time zone
There's no place like home

New Orleans is a dying whore
If you're not seen break down the door
New Orleans is a dying whore

New Orleans is a dying whore
Stripped down and beat to the floor
New Orleans is a dying whore

New Orleans is a dying whore
Blood covered, stuck to my floor
New Orleans is a dying whore
