It took a lot to sell my soul
The same thing happened yesterday
I paid my price, then felt alive
But no pulse is within my veins

Never will I lie and say I'm still alive
Come what may to me, there's something on my side

I'm left with heart, 'cause inside me's gone
Compulsion drives me anyway
I play my part and my part is large
Makes me stronger every day

Never will I lie and say I'm still alive
Come what may to me, there's something on my side

One year and it ain't so bad
I'm trying to see things clearly
The clearer it gets, the more I'm confused
I'm thinking more about blindness
Thinking hard about blindness
Thinking purely of blindness

There's something on my side
There's something on my side
There's something on my side
There's something on my side...
