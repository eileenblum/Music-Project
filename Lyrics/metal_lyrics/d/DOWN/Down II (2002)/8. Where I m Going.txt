Now don't you worry none
Leave this part of yourself behind
I'm giving you back to yourself

So should you make the change
Or could you right them wrongs
For I cannot replace where I'm going
Where I'm going

So you're angry with me
What could be better, my love
Have most of everything for yourself

Hateful and deserved
Charlie Manson's eyes
Are looking through you back to myself

So should I act my age
Or should I just not belong
For I cannot replace where I'm going
Where I'm going...
