Started from the start
Wearing out the headstones
Was the end, was the right
Taking out a life loan

Hey, old man
When I'm going six feet down
You gotta make that promise to me
A stained glass cross lay behind my head

When taken by the undertaker
No questions anymore
It's higher than the black sky
Get you lower than the floor

Hey, old man
When I'm going six feet down
You gotta make that promise to me
A stained glass cross looking down on me

Hey, old man
When I'm going six feet down
You gotta make that promise to me
A stained glass cross hanging over me

I was just a young boy
My father sounded crazy
My death he couldn't bear to see
Either joking, sleeping, lazy

Hey, old man
When you're going six feet down
I gotta make that promise to you
A stained glass cross lay behind your head

Hey, old man
When you're going under and down
I made a sacred promise to you
A stained glass cross looking down on you
