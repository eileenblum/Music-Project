Sometimes I feel like a man that has two broken hands
All of this thrown at me, sinking me neck deep in sand
They can't kill me no more, I don't know what to say 'cause it's lies
Lies

Underneath all this, they should see the man that I am
All of my life I've been tried and then persecuted
They can't kill me no more, I don't know what to say 'cause it's lies
Lies

Underneath all this, they should see the man that I really am
I've been tried and persecuted
Lies

Undenied
Cold shackles inches from the knife
I defy
What's mine shall be but nothing stands the time
Not surprised
It's the same to sleep as it is to rise
Lies

Undenied
Cold shackles on my hands, inches away

Death or life
Look deeply into my eyes
Fire on fire
Way to be and get a fucking ride
Some desire
A "fuck you" soars through the sky
Lies
