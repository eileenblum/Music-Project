Slow time, deaf to all the hearing
Blinded to the seeing, nothing's so revealing
Some day I might leave here
I'll get what's comin' to me one day
These days my eyes are empty
Hard times for the son of a bitch

Self inflicted, I'm gonna fall flat
Unpredicted, that's where I'm at
So addicted, dog tired in the fast lane

Break down, devastate to kneeling
Suffering to bleeding, all the chance of feeling
Some day I might destroy here
I'm gonna get what's coming to me one day
These days my life is empty
Hard times for the son of a bitch

Self inflicted, I'm gonna fall flat
Unpredicted, that's where I'm at
So addicted, dog tired in the fast lane

Dog tired in the fast lane
Dog tired in the fast lane
Dog tired in the fast lane
Dog tired in the fast lane

Self inflicted, I'm gonna fall flat
Unpredicted, that's where I'm at
So addicted, dog tired in the fast lane
Dog tired in the fast lane...
