Smoke up, do what you must do
Wake up, inhale the earth grown fumes
Higher than mountains, but oh so goddamn deep
The morning star we reach, think for yourself
And that's you, you times a million

Look around, we surround the fields
On guard for the perfection of the seed
Perfection of the seed

Try hard to stop us which you can't
Outnumbered by the marijuana camps
Larger than nations, I can't name one without
Must kill the king of drought
Planting of pleasure, rising up, stretch towards the sky

Look around, we surround the fields
On guard for perfection of the seed
Perfection of the seed

This way of life has become an addiction
Despite right or wrong and their closed superstition
This way of life has become an addiction
Despite right or wrong, despite right or wrong
Despite right or wrong

Perfection of the seed...
