You can't fool the fool, 'cause I know it in my head
I just want the people to get some before they're dead
You can take my body and dry it in the sun

Seeing vultures circle overhead
This is the home of the beautifully depressed
Life is just a moment that rushes all at once
Letting the vultures surround me when I'm dead
I am the lord of the beautifully depressed

Endlessly, cum for me
Faithfully, bend for me
Lifelessly, hang for me
Endlessly, endlessly

Push me to the limit
I ain't afraid to die
Drive me to the limit
I proudly pledge to die

I dispell the madness by forgetting all the rules
You say I follow in the footsteps of pre-existing fools
Begging vultures to bury off my head
This is the hard life of the beautifully depressed

Endlessly, cum for me
Faithfully, bend for me
Lifelessly, hang for me
Endlessly, endlessly

Push me to the limit
I ain't afraid to die
Look before you're in it
Are you afraid to die

Then join the beautifully depressed
The beautifully depressed...
