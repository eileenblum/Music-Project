Pray to someone
I'm going out of my head
Dislocate
Stay safe in your unmade bed

Lysergik funeral procession

The world is watched
Straight from your TV sets
Makes you ill
Turn off and drop out in spurts

Lysergik funeral procession

I get up, get ready to face this world
I come down
I come down so hard, I hit then bounce
In a pool of piss I lay

Once revived, I was better off like I was
In so many pieces
And I'm so damn mad, so fucking mad
To lose that special darkness
I've got nothing to lose
