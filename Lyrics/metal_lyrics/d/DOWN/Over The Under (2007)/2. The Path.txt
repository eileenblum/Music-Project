Crawling...to the path of the righteous
Crawling...to you again
To you again
Crawling...up then down a mountain
Crawling...then up again
Then up again

Could you ever admit to yourself
That you must walk in the light of the blessed?

Not invited
To cry out loud
I'm a brother
Stone cold truth
Love and suffer
(The) Siamese-cult
Held divided
So I trudge on
Now

Could you ever admit to yourself
That you must walk in the light of the blessed?

Not invited
To cry out loud
I'm a brother
Stone cold truth
Love and suffer
(The) Siamese-cult
Held divided
So I trudge on

Eyes wide to reality
Crawling...to the path for the righteous
Crawling...to you again
Eyes wide to reality
Crawling...up then down a mountain
Then up again
Eyes wide to reality
Crawling...I'm crawling to you
