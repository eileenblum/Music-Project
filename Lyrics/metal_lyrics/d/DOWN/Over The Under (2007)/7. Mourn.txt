Hotel room of doom
I can't find a clue
Confusion broken hearted woe
Sheets and pillows soaked
(My) telephone seems broken
I'm calling crucified
Blacklisted no reply...

Be my eyes
Stole my sight
But not my heart
I miss my 2nd home
(Your) adopted son doth morn adopted son

Doth mourn

Sermon served in praise
In a sacred empty space
Pit no ones sorrow against your own
Seven days in vain
The last three spent inflamed(in prayer)
I stand crucified
As they're stricken blind

Be my eyes
Stole my sight
But not my heart
Missing the lone state home
My blood runs cold
I mourn
Stole my sight
But not my heart
I miss my 2nd home
(Your) adopted son doth morn adopted son

Doth mourn

Be my eyes
Stole my sight
But not my heart
Missing the lone state home
My blood runs cold
I mourn
Stole my sight
But not my heart
I miss my 2nd home
(Your) adopted son doth morn adopted son

Doth mourn
