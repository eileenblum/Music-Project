All scorn me
A monster should be feared
Witch hunt blame
Regret and damn the day

I scream

Fallen leaves
From the same family tree
Wind blows halves
Regret is all that's left...all that's left
Words cut deeply
(There is) no secrecy
So long since seeing
My lifetime appealing
The two are not healing
I cannot help feeling regret...regret

Reflecting on our memories...
We know the pains of living...
And i know he's seeing both of we...
Regret he would not want to be

I scream.
