[Bonus Track]

She's got samples of the best
Nag-champa taste upon her breath
Full lips whisper "opiate and sex"
She's the sweetest fuck you've ever had

(no fear here now [?])

Pin-cushion aura mocking death
Sharing blood with beer on fucked-up trips
She has turned you on inside yourself
A wall of curse that no one can get past

Invest in fear

You're in love
Brown sugar in your blood
She's a drug [2x]
(she's a drug) [2x]

And again I swear
You're in love
Brown sugar in your blood
She's a drug [2x]
(she's a drug) [4x]

Alone with death a drugged-up succubus
A retrovenous sense is left to spread
Six feet down she's stretched into an 'X'
Black flowers resting on her breasts

Invest in fear
You invest in fear [3x]

You're in love
Brown sugar in your blood
She's a drug [2x]
(she's a drug) [6x]
