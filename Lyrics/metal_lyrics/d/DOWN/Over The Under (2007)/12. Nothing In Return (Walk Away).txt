Fast..a cleansed soul rebirthing
See..to be..and understand your flipside...

You want nothing in return

All...is cry until the laughing
There is more between the sky and earth
That is beyond our philosophy
Unknown

You want nothing in return

The closest who need you
(And) the closest surrounding you
Will walk away

You want nothing in return

And when we walk away there will be no coming home
