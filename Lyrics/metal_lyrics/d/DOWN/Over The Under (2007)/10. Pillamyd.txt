Been to this place before
An excavation
Scrawling a name again
Touch stony face restored
Can't read the name
Collapsible fingertips

Weeping within the hot of desert weeps
To brood inside the skull of
Wax and time
Taking no step alone until you can
Crying on the downed stones

(Pillamyd)
By handfuls you will build a pillamyd
(Pillamyd)

Lust in the vessel head
Working with slaves
Dust in the eyes of men
Offer nocturnal prayer
Alter a blaze
Magic obtained
Deciphering pain

Moving inside you when you seem asleep
Influence all to step beyond the gate
When you're slipping in preservative
Hydro-glyphic downed stones

(Pillamyd)
By handfuls you will build a pillamyd
(Pillamyd)
A pillamyd built
The pillamyd guilt...inside

It's etched in stone

(Pillamyd)
By handfuls you will build a pillamyd
(Pillamyd)
