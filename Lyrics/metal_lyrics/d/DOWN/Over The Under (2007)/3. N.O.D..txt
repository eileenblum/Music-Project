Sick of a sickness
A reoccurring nightmare of
Convulsing through slow tempo dance
Liberation requiem
Stamped out curriculum
On that doppelganger laughing (manifesting wings)
The dark side
Drop trip

Lost on a trip
No acid can supply
Because L.S.D. ain't what it used to be (for me)
Inside of dead weight standing
Speaking with authority
Black smoke is swirling upward masking...

The dark side
Misanthropy skin deep
The dark side
(We) the children of extremes
The dark side
Will warn a fool indeed
The dark side
You'll have to carry that weight..
I fight
I will fight
Against the strands so ill advised

The dark side
Misanthropy skin deep
The dark side
(We) the children of extremes
The dark side
Will warn a fool indeed
The dark side
You'll have to carry that weight..
I fight
I will fight
Against the strands so ill advised

We'll never know when
Some day will bring our own
(Sudden)...last time

I will fight...you say you want a revolution?
I will fight...and carry that weight
