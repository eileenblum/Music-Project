Close the door
Lay in bed
Cigarette
Aching head
Never try...
You either do it or don't waste your time

Frustration
Out patient
Hand-cuffed man
To himself

Navigate slowly
A step at a time
Towards the law
Never try...
You either do it or don't waste your life

Shreds of life
Eyes cried dry
Touch no-thing
Burned outright

Navigate slowly
A step at a time
Towards the law
Never try...
You either do it or don't waste your time
