It's the strength of defiance that defines a life...
Can't give it clout anymore...
Bless the bravest attempts to tear us down...
Good luck and fuck your retort...

A graven world...
(There's) A grave in the sky...
I don't trust your face...
(Because) my coffin's still open...

It's the bullish minds that weaken the herd...
Can't let them suck all our blood...
Restless fools will cry, likes wolves overheard...
Tainted and reeking of spoils...

A graven world...
A grave in the sky...
They don't trust my face...
(Because) our coffins are open...

It's flawless black and white...
Our heart is on our sleeves...
I'm fucking serious...
We wear our hearts on our sleeves...

Trust is hard to find (but) decipher the worst...
Money ain't much anymore...
Use the strongest minds to soften the fall...
Deploy your warrior blood...

A graven world...
(There's) A grave in the sky...
I don't trust your face...
(Because) my coffin's still open...

(It's) The wayward horde...
(It's) The weight of the bribe...
Don't like this face...
(Because) our coffins are open...
A graven world...
A grave in the sky...
They don't trust our faces...
(Because) my coffin is open...

DEPLOY YOUR WARRIOR BLOOD
