Dead sing through me Uprising in shaman's translation...
Archrival souls (of) squandering Transcending the threat, the tarots are burned...
There'll come a time/to gloat in the light/don't stop there... levitation...

This flesh claims dreams Mars haunts the skies, crimson and gleaming...
Lay thee rebel arms free Throttle their bones, wrangle its beasts...
There'll come a time/to brave the blind/(but) don't stop their... levitation...

Laymen's translation Morals be damned, its ignorance paramount...
(But) Kiss sin's feet in worship...
What we can't grovel in will master our fate...
There'll come a time/the cause will die/(but) it won't stop there... levitation...
Levitation will knock you down to size...
