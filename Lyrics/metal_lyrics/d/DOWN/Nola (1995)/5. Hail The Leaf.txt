Brave River
I can't sail
Lone Feeling
That I might Fail
So I just, Smoke
Let me tread, Stoned

Sixth Hour
Fail to Rise
And I cower
In reality's eyes
So I just, Smoke
Let me tread, Stoned
(Smoke)
(Stoned)

I have fallen
Scattered away
Alone I'll Cry
Broken Shame
So I just, Smoke
Let me tread, Stoned

I can't feel you
You Can't breath
No more sadness
No More pain
Not what feeds your broken ways
No more sadness
No more Woe
