Woe to me, battered man
Raise the monolith
Deities my spirit rise
Like days the world forgets - down the
Drain - laid to lame
A fool-ass hearty bliss
Borderline suicide,
Celebrate before my death
Your promised land divide,
That's why the world lies.
I give up.
That's enough. I give up.
I'm underneath my life.
Dog in heat, beware the street
Its there you'll meet your end
Poverty is not for me,
But I'll take her back again
To prove a point,
To laugh it off, to cross you off my path,
Grip the night, pull the cord,
A much inspired wrath.
Your promised land divide,
That's where the world lies.
I give up.
That's enough. I give up.
I'm underneath my life.
Carry me back from the war
And from the lord.
