Long day lay me low.

Lay me low.

Head burning drunk.
I don't need none
That's right man I'm fine
But what I've got to know,
Is have I wasted time?
My eyes are blind
To almost everything you see.
And I'm drowning through sorrow
- you recognize me -
Be me for a change (fucked)
Under the silk,

In a box of pine,
And that's dying -
Not a single other life
Ever will have felt my price
Is it worth the risk to be revived?
And I'm dying, I'm hollow
- It won't deny me -
Be me for a change (fucked)
How long will I stay?
They'll take the pain away
On and outta my mind
Gimme some medicine...
And I'm drowning through sorrow
- it won't deny me -
Be me for a change (fucked)
Yeah, one more time...

Long day kill me long
