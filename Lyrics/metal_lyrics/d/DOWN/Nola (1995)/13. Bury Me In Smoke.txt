Windows are closing to keep me locked away
No chance was given to find myself today...

My time of aging wonder when I'll die
But when my time will come I know the reason why!

I have an escape, alone it keeps me safe within my home
I have a reason to keep me satisfied until I'm gone

Don't regret the rules I broke
When I die bury me in smoke

Under the world I wait for my fate
My soul is resting beneath my blissful haze

My time of aging wonder when I'll die
But when my time will come, I know the reason why

I have an escape, alone it keeps me safe within my home
I have a reason to keep me satisfied until I'm gone

Don't regret the rules I broke
When I die bury me in smoke
