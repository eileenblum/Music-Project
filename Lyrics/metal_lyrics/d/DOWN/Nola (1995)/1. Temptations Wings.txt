I feel the pressure, it lightens
To judge this spirit of mine
To be like the judgement
To be the king that is left behind

To hell with I miss you
I said I do it alone
Feeling the problem
A broken vision to call my own

I gave my life to reason
And now I'm watching my life go

My wit is falling apart

I can't shake temptations wings
I can't shake temptations wings

Bury my head with frustration
I look at others and wonder why?
Feeding my cancer
A broken vision that stole my sight

I gave my life to reason,
Now I'm watching my life go

My wit is falling apart

I can't shake temptation wings!
I can't shake temptation wings!
I can't shake temptation way

That's right, temptations way.

Temptations wings...
Temptations wings got me pale
Why?
