Goddamn!
This time it's real,
It's a love that I feel.
I may be tainted but god knows
It's good to me, 'cause you see -
I leave my woes at
Stranger's road dispose,
And let the sun back in my face.
It's a soul sense of pride,
Good lord the south is blind,
But she gives me
So much suffrage with my pain,

I feel the strain
When I get behind a big slow day
I've fucked it all
Was that down? was that family?
I leave my woes at
Stranger's road dispose.
And let the blood back in my veins.
It's a soul sense of pride,
Good lord the south is blind,
But she will never
Let me go back to being sane
But please let me die there...
Cold world leaves me there...
Let me die there...
