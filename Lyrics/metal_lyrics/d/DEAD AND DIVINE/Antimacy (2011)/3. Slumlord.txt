The ground is giving away beneath me
Worms are feasting on my feet
Soon enough youâll find more places to sink your teeth
Something tells me Iâm far from dead
I can still feel them gnawing at the meat
You can preach all you want
But if thereâs one thing Iâm sure of
They couldnât medicate me enough
To believe a single word
If there is a god
If there is a god
Sinâs taken hold of my hand
And welcomed me unto it
Weâve been the best of friends
If there is a god
If there is a god he rejected us
Once he saw what we were capable of
Fasten your hands if you want
Look at me now
Are you proud of what you have created?
Another âdead-headâ whoâs left faithless and vacant
And Iâd willingly sell my soul
To feel anything more
But thatâs what got me here before
I will harness the finest burial shrouds
Itâs a shame I wonât be lamented
There is no grave deep enough for low lives like me
There is no grave
There is no grave
There is no grave deep enough
All my god damns got me nowhere
All my god damns got me nowhere
Theyâll take my head apart
Examine it carefully
So there wonât be others like me
Look at me now
Are you proud of what you have created?
Another âdead-headâ whoâs left faithless and vacant
And Iâd willingly sell my soul
To feel anything more
But thatâs what got me here before
Are you proud?
Have I made you proud?
Are you proud of me now?
I am all I am
I am all I am
I am all I am
Cause it never
Cause it never loved me
