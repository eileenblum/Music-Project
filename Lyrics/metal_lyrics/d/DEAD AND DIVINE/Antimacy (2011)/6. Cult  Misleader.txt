We corrupt our young and we speak in tongues
Weâre content with lust cause weâre in love with our guns
Hallelujah, put your hands in the air
You bare the grins of dead carps
Do you love him enough to bring blood?
Iâll praise he who counsels me
But so far Iâve heard nothing
And I ainât shaken
And I ainât shaken
Youâre the product of kindred love
Parade around the cross to cover it up
You thrive on the faint like rats on remains
Who think they need you like a needle to the vein
Sh sh shoot it up and drift away
This faction is only fashion
And itâs fallen on its face
They lure you into their dead lights
Holy spirit compels them to
So it makes it right
So it makes it right
I truly resent you
Or maybe its envy Iâm feeling
But Iâve already come to terms with feeling nothing
Weâre content with lust cause we love our guns
Weâre content with lust cause we love our
Youâre as charismatic as a strung out fanatic in need of new holes
Keeps you fiending for more
You captivate with your words
You spit em out like clock work
And I bet it keeps your bones nice and warm
You thrive on the faint like rats on remains
Who think they need you like a needle to the vein
Sh sh shoot it up and drift away
This faction is only fashion
And itâs fallen on its face
You captivate with your words
You spit em out like clock work
And I bet it keeps your bones nice and warm
