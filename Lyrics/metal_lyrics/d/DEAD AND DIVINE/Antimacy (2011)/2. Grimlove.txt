I canât say I will miss these tender moments
Of acute hemorrhaging
It seems the only love that I let
Is that which smells of death
Iâm so tired of these appendages
My skin wants off my bones
And these phantom limbs are starting to itch
Take from me and leave something
Of the nothing you bring
We found us a grim love
The kind of love where everyoneâs expendable
You gnash your teeth and lash your tongue at me
I wanna bury you all
Now Iâm loaded up with a bad blood
I thought I was incapable of
All you kids will be the death of me
And I will gladly let you lead me to my grave
Cause you are all just as dead me
Cause you are all just as dead me
I canât tell if youâre hanging up here with me
Or youâve been the ones banging in the nails
I will grin on the day I leave you with nothing
I will grin on the day death becomes me
We found us a grim love
The kind of love where everyoneâs expendable
You gnash your teeth and lash your tongue at me
I wanna bury you all
Now Iâm loaded up with a bad blood
I thought I was incapable of
Youâve confused me with someone who gives a damn
The only love I let is that which smells of death
The only love I let smells of death
And I will welcome it
