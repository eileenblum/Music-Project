My hearts riddled with stitches
Iâm that âasphyxiatedâ kind of blue
And Iâve become arthritis from touching you
Iâve become arthritis
Oh, anesthetic donât come cheap
We all float
We all float down here
We all float
We all float down
Youâre white and tasteless
Wide eyed and shameless
Do you get it yet?
My conscience ainât clear
How the hell did I end up here?
Do you get it, get it, get it yet?
Get it, get it, get it yet?
Reaping machines taken hold of me
And led me underneath
So it can be âalways a part of meâ
Weâll be fucking inseparable
Weâll be fucking inseparable
I canât breathe (what have you done)
I canât breathe (what have you done to me?)
We all float
We all float down
Youâre white and tasteless
Wide eyed and shameless
Do you get it yet?
My conscience ainât clear
How the hell did I end up here?
Do you get it, get it, get it yet?
Get it, get it, get it yet?
We all float down here
And youâll float here too
