For their sake will you ever give up?
Or is it something that you have no control of?
Youâve fashioned a tear that cannot be repaired
By the hands of Jesus Christ
That pale horse brings out the finest whores in us all
If you could only learn to close your mouth
Youâd be loved by now
Iâve been displaced by your lack of grace
And I know sin
What a fucking failure love is
Yeah and I would pray
Yeah and I would pray only to hear you say nothing back to me
Itâs quite the shame
Yeah quite the shame cause now youâre the one to blame
Come on, letâs all get high on eucharist tonight
I often question who has been steering your brain
This war will never reach an end unless I grow some
Grow some fangs or bestow my blood
Spit your sermons, cast your spells
Instill upon the weak willed
That they are aimed straight for hell
There is no devil, there is no need
Iâve found a far worse evil in front of me
Yeah and I would pray
Yeah I would pray only to hear you say nothing back to me
Itâs quite the shame
Yeah quite the shame cause now youâre the one to blame
Now youâre the one I blame for everything
Come on, letâs all get high on eucharist tonight
Come on, letâs all get high on eucharist tonight
While it sleeps in bliss
You will breed an ignorance
And your children will get the worst of it
You will breed an ignorance
And your children
And your children
And your children
