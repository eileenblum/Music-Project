My words they wonât impress the people I want them to
They wonât make a goddamn difference to any of you
Yet I keep spilling my guts and Iâm so fucking sore all the time
Iâve lost all but one tooth
Iâve lost all but one tooth
Iâve lost you all
Itâs all just out of some deformed act of love
Iâve tried my best but I guess Iâm not fake enough
I cannot help but think I am part of the rot thatâs tainted you all
The bullshit used to be so easy to sniff out
I thought I had found you out
My ruin lies upon my tongue
No one will care to notice when Iâm gone
The impression I leave will be a weak one
I plan to kill this teen delusion before Iâm done
Iâm insignificant and Iâm well aware of it
I can promise you this will be the last time I give a shit
I can see now that I have been part of the rot that has tainted you all
The bullshit used to be so easy to sniff out
Now itâs leaking from my mouth
Assemble yourselves in accordance to
The deaf, the numb, the blind
And you will find yourselves standing in the same line
My ruin lies upon my tongue
No one will care to notice when Iâm gone
The impression I leave will be a weak one
I plan to kill this teen delusion before Iâm done
Iâve lost you all
Iâve lost you all
