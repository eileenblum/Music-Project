Iâve been foolishly biding my time
But itâs fangs are sharper than mine
Paranoia has taken the place
Taken the place of god
But thatâs all his purpose was
Keep your faith
Keep your faith
If itâs what you got
By all means believe what you want
Iâve been spitting on my own grave
No amount of grace can get me saved
And yet Iâm surprised
My heart has become the dwelling place of demons
One of these days
I wonât wake up as much as Iâll come to
It has something to do with you
I feel you coursing through my veins
Hell knows if you leave I wonât be the same
Now that youâve made a name for yourself
I only wish I could cast you out
But thereâs some appealing about you on my mouth
Iâve been spitting on my own grave
No amount of grace can get me saved
After Iâm reduced to waste
And this worldâs washed its hands of me
God forbid I come back with the only instruction youâll need:
Get off your knees
Get off your knees
Iâll be alright
Believe me, Iâll be just fine
Get off your knees
Get off your knees
My heart has become the dwelling place of demons
One of these days I wonât have the lungs
To beg pardon for what Iâve done
And even if I do, it wonât be poetic enough
Iâve nailed my coffin shut
