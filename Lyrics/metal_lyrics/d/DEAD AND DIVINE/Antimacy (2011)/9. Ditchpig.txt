Goodness gracious how can you kiss without lips
My fingers keep getting stuck in your ribs
Have you learned nothing from this?
Skeleton skeleton skeleton
You siphoned the hearts of all your loved ones
Youâve lined your pockets with everyoneâs despair
If you search the places youâve destroyed
No one, no one will greet you there
Should you come back
I will rend you limb from limb
Itâs a shame suicide ainât in
If you come back
I will rend you limb from limb
Lord knows youâd be all over it
Do you don the red hood or act the wolf?
Your teeth are filed down from gnawing on the bullet
But you canât help it after all, we are as animals
You were born into this, a soul turned to shit
Wont be something I will miss
Were you staved of love? had you not enough?
There is no amount of attention that will seal the crack inside your heart
Youâre as desirable as a kick to the head
Blessed be all your deathbeds
All your deathbeds
But you canât help it after all, we are as animals
You were born into this, a soul turned to shit
Wont be something I will miss
Youâre worse, far worse, than the cancer you fake
Than the cancer you fake
Iâll see you at the troth
You fake fucking pig
