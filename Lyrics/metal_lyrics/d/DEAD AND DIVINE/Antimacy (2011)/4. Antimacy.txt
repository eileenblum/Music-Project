Youâre so damn good at making it hurt so bad
Are you feeling anything yet?
You havenât loosened your grip around my neck
Your love is amphetamine
Iâve lost all feeling in my extremities
But I could be
I could be your one and only
Convince yourself your not rotting inside
And that tonightâs the best night of your life
Weâll be serpentine..joint intravenously
We could be the perfect disease
But you donât belong to me
We could never belong
And I want to tell you that I surely do give a damn
But I cannot tell you cause Iâm sure as hell scared to death
Are you feeling anything yet?
This is my skin youâve been crawling in
This is my skin youâve been crawling around in
You perch atop the skulls of those persuade (looking down on me)
Pleased by the mess youâve made
You are the perfect drug in the sense that you keep me stoic
And detached and I love you for that
If this is love load me up
If this is love load me up
If this is love load me up
If this is love
I want to tell you that I
And I want to tell you that I surely do give a damn
But I cannot tell you cause Iâm sure as hell scared to death
Are you feeling anything yet?
Iâd love to have you, but you donât belong to me
This is my skin
