Iâm about as holy as a bullet riddled body is
Iâm crooked, Iâm bent, been left for dead
And Iâm malcontent
With the fact that Iâm feeling fine
Aside from my blackened lungs and misshapen spine
I gave myself to the night
And if you come to me in search of faith
You will find me rotting in the bowels of a saint
Weâve polluted our own
We reap what we sow
And nothing can save our souls
Do we want it? no
Do we need it? no
Do we believe it?
Are we compelled to care for love
To find a love we know nothing of?
We gave ourselves to the night
We gave ourselves to the night
I believe in sin cause sin believes in me
It carries my head on a stick and worships it
How can I forgive when Iâm up to my neck in this?
You better repent
Youâve carved yourself a witch
Youâve carved yourself a witch
Come on, come give yourselves to the night
Come on, give yourselves to the night
Do we want it? no
Do we need it? no
Do we believe it?
Are we compelled to care for love
To find a love we know nothing of?
We gave ourselves to the night
You will find me rotting in the bowels of a saint
You will find me rotting in the bowels of a saint
