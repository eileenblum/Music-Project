I stand here, helpless, star struck, by the starlet at the masquerade. Spare me the dramatics
I get where I am and where I'm heading.
But you see I've realized my wrongs, I know I can't take them back.
But I'll spend eternity taking every chance I get.
I am doomed and gloom has it's harrowing arms wrapped around her.
Just listen to the words, in every love song...
They're all about us, every single word. Every single lie. All great romances start with you and I.
I am jealousy's advocate, and for that I have nothing.
I am the man who invented the excuse, woe, me.
Just listen to the words, in every love song...
They're all about us, every single word. Every single lie. All great romances start with you and I.
Can I say a word without you interrupting me? Or do I not have a choice?
To take your hand, is to let go of all else.
And I lack that commitment.
