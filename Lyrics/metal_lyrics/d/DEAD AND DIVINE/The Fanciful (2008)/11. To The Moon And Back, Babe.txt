Pretty you are, enough to be in magazines,
But I know and you know, you're worth more than that to me.
But my desire to kiss you completely diminished.
Due to the fact that your lips on my lips just might as well be your foot on my throat
Holding back the hidden "I love you"'s in all the songs that I've ever wrote.
Until the day... That his swells have come to suck you in and steal you away from me yet again.
To drown everything important to assure you forgot about me.
To remain embraced by something stronger than me, warmer than me, better than me.
More suitable to best accommodate your needs.
And the moment he touches your face, caresses your body, just to feel
I will break at the knees,
And I will combust.
I will..... I will....
And his swells have come to suck you in and steal you away from me yet again.
To drown everything important to assure you forget about me.
So it won't hurt so bad to see you love again.
So it won't hurt so bad to see you love again.
So it won't hurt so bad to see you love again.
So it won't hurt so bad to watch as you... forget about me.
