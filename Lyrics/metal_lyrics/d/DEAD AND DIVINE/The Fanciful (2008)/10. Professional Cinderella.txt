...And you may have a bulletproof smile, but you are easily penetrated where it counts.
If it's the sex that you love, I'll give you something to lust about.
Goddamn, it's happening again - I'm running out of time.
I've got a gaping hole in my chest but it's alright, it's alright.
Cause I'm a hopeless romantic by day and a sex machine by night.
So cock and load your vocal cords and scream like you've never screamed before.
You wreak havoc upon my world, but yet you're so worth waiting for.
If I'm the kind of clichÃ©s, then you're the God of catastrophe.
We are ever lasting, we are what love is made of, nothing can stop us now.
I am lovesick with the machine gun blues.
Goddamn I cannot shake it out. I am lovesick with the machine gun blues.
And I can't shake it out, shake it out.
