We are but sinners, swimming in the stomach of the shark.
But I'm making it out, and I'm making my way to his heart.
But a lot like the world, this beast is heartless. And a lot like the shark, I'm hungry for your kiss.
And I've been set in stone from the day I was born.
I'm but a thief, stealing the teeth of wolves while.
They sleep. I'm charismatic in the way I captivate!
I cannot believe I made it here, I deserve the worst
Come on, get your asses of the floor.
And prepare to witness something like you've never seen before.
It's enchanted, it's romantic, it's everything you've ever imagined.
Just for a second let's pretend that I give a damn.
I lost my dignity to a lousy girl. And I abandoned my compassion at sea!
Lord I can't deny my appetite... Come on.
I've been cast out of heaven, and I've been spit outta hell. I'm a walking desperado...
And I am empty as the 'o' in God.
