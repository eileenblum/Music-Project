My name is in lights above a rundown tavern. And it calls me.
It's where the women want and need, and bleed for you.
This is the kind of place where dreams come true.
And God is shaking hands with the devil.
They've got bids placed on my head! And it seems as though god is routing against me.
And the devil is my best friend.

And I swear I won't give in, to this feeble attempt.
To try and stop me from seeing you, from feeling you.

2, 3, 4...
There is something about the way you move it dull this shiv of a man I am and my love for you.
She was bad news, she smoked her cigarettes slow.
She killed rock and roll.

And I swear I won't give in to this feeble attempt to.
To try and stop me, from seeing you, from feeling you.
From feeling you, from feeling you
