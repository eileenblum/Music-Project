This is a lot like sleeping with loaded shotguns, and a lot like kissing fingers crossed.
Did doing what you did make you feel important?
Or was it just another worthwhile reason to spread your legs.
I think I'm in love with you baby. Or at least I love to think so?
It's on nights like these that heads will roll, and we will feel. Feelings like we've never felt before.
Tonight will signify everything I've eradicated, I hope to leave you shaking.
So I'll face this apathetic crowd. I'm unarmed, but I'm ready to fire. Yeah!
I've loaded up on ambition, and I've got myself a good/pure soul.
Its simply just the sex that's killing me. You're killing me.
Can't you see it? Coward, I won't lie when I say. I've always found you weak.
I won't stop until your by my side. Counting down the seconds until our ribs collide.
