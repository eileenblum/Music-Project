I'll be honest. My patience has come and gone. I messed up real bad this time.
So I'll apologize for my poor appearance, and ever awful pronunciation.
I'm shot, full of hope and I'm slightly intoxicated. Yet I'm searching for something more.
And I long for a little bit more.
It's the disappointment that's far too much to cope with when everything is a fabrication.
Our lives, our hopes, our dreams, our love was all exaggerated.
Yet I'm searching for something more. And how I've longed for so much more.
Here I am to admit defeat, I've never been one to beg pardon, but yet I'm on my knees
I've tried my best to smile, but its hard when you look up at the stars and ask the sky when they're coming back.
