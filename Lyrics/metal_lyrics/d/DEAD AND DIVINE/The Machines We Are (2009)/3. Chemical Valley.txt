We somehow cannot grasp the concept of steady feet,
we dance amongst our sins which only brings us to our knees.
I can't say I'm any better cause I've been her a time or two before.
But I lie...
Cause I'm a stubborn fuck who keeps coming back even though I am shit out of luck.
Let's see what tonight throws up.
Maybe a lung, maybe a slew of tongues, maybe some old fashioned lonesome.
Really, its you who keeps dragging me back by my larynx and my lack of common sense.
Everyone has been dying to have you but I've been the only one killing for it.
Line 'em up, one by one.
Hell hath no waste like us.
Ain't being empty fun?
It eats it's way right through your head, so you never remember the nights we spend.
We are all victims to some form of chemical bliss,
but I think deep down you really need it.
Kill off this desire, before it kills me first.
Unload whats left in the clip,
Really, its you who keeps dragging me back by my larynx and my lack of common sense.
Everyone has been dying to have you but I've been the only one killing for it.
Line 'em up, one by one.
So stick me I am done.
