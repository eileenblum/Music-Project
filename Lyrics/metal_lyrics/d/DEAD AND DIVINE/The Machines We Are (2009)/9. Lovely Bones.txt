It's party night tonight, just like every night;
And once again, you've death defied.
And how are those things that crawled up inside your head?
Polish off this bottle and pour yourself into bed.

Let's shoot some drugs and fall in love,
'cause I feel like...

And you're sick all the time
It's a constant battle with sunshine
But I love the way you electrify.
There's something very damaged about you,
But I've got a bad habit of never giving up
Even when you want me to.
(Touch me)
I
(Come apart)

Let's shoot some drugs and fall in love,
'cause I feel like getting tangled up in your bones.

Someone gave you up; you were prosthetic in love,
But I will keep you carved inside my gun
Until morning comes.

I can feel the dawn peering in,
And I'm gonna lose you all over again. (Over again, over again, over again, over again)

I've been so high on you, I never quite came down.

Let's shoot some drugs and fall in love,
Cause I feel like getting tangled up in your bones.
Someone gave you up; you were prosthetic in love,
But I will keep you carved inside my gun
