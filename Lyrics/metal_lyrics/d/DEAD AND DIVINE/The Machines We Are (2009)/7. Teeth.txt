Sink 'em in, loving how depravity tastes.
As it runs down your lips, relief showers your face.
We sleep all day, just to stay alive, just so we can all go out and die a little at night.
Aropax princess got herself a case of the shakes. She gets her fix too little too late.
Being easy ain't pretty my sugar coated baby, my achromatic, post-traumatic baby.
You are barely alive.
Something wicked this way comes. I've been looking for you along horizons.
Maybe that's why it took me so long.
If I don't beg you to stop, would I become one of them?
Could I be irresistible to you?
Could I be that shine in your spit?
Could I be the breath that you don't have?
Could I be the reflection that you seem to lack?
If it could kill me, would you let it?
Something wicked this way comes.
Something wicked this way comes. I've been looking for you along horizons.
Maybe that's why it took me so long.
If I don't beg you to stop, would I become one of them?
Sink 'em in, sink 'em in. Come on, come on.
Sink 'em in, sink 'em in. Come on, come on.
Sink 'em in, sink 'em in. Come on, come on.
Sink 'em in, sink 'em in. Come on, come on.
