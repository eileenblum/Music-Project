You're only out to lose yourself in a whirlwind of hedonistic sunsoaked, booze drenched, depraved fornication.
How is your spine?
It's been quite some time since it packed its shit up and left you behind.

We've all been fooled into believing we're well;
I was crazy to think you had a chance in hell.
I love you so much, I've been contemplating removing your head [x2]

I've grown weary of watching you twist and coil your tongue,
In and around all the ones I love, consuming what is left of all of us.

You lack any ambition, your godawful habits are starting to sting.
You like to think that you're capable of getting away with anything.
Drink up and further dull your ability to feel.
And I'll pray that your lack of sobriety softens the blow when your face hit the windshield.

I know what you want. I got for ya!
A one way ticket out of here, so you can die in California.
Oh you rebel you, oh you Casanova you.

I've grown weary of watching you twist and coil your tongue,
In and around all the one's I love, consuming what is left of all of us.

We've grown weary of watching you twist and coil your tongue,
In and around all the one's we love, consuming what is left of all of us.
