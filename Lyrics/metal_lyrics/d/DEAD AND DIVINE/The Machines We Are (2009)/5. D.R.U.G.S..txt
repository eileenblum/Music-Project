We found religion amongst the party people, we found the answer beneath our nose.
We gave in to our intoxication and sexually transmitted our self-centeredness onto those who cease to admit how badly they wanted it.
Stellar in our dope-indused malevolent ways, keeping the blood flowing all through our veins.
Let's get comatose tonight, let's have ourselves a good time.
Let's overdose on fluorescent light, cause we ain't dying yet, right?
We cough up debauchery from our pseudo lungs,
Makeshifted by what we've lost.
What has happened to us?
What has happened to us?
We don't make love anymore, that is something the hopeless adore.
So what are we here for?
The drugs.
Cause it makes the world look prettier, cause they make everyone look prettier
Let's get comatose tonight, let's have ourselves a good time.
Let's overdose on fluorescent light, cause we ain't dying yet, right?
