This is not where we're supposed to be.
Causing ears to bleed,
And hearts to ache,
Is this us improving?
Apparently my lips.
Apparently my lips are stale.
Cast me into the sky,
Just as you've done with everything you've ever loved.
Please,
Can we meet at the end of it all?
I'll bring the wine,
You bring the heartache.
Hand-in-hand we'll drown.
This must be love,
Because you're still not dead to me.
Just shut up and kiss me.
And we're both still standing.
Cast me into the sky.
Just dead to me.
We're fine I think.
