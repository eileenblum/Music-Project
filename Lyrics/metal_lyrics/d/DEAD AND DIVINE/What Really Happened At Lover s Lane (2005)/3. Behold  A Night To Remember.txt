There is panic in the streets.
The women and children are screaming.
They're running with glass in their feet,
And it's getting harder and harder to see anything.
So we'll just sit here,
Waiting and watching the world illuminate like a new sun.
From here,
We see like god.
And it's a...
Burn,
Baby,
Burn.
Abandon all ships,
The end is coming.
We can't stop this from happening.
Love can't stop this from happening.
Love can't stop this from happening.
So we'll just sit here waiting and watching the world illuminate like a new sun.
From here,
We see like god.
And it's a fucking party.
We thought we could make it through hell and back.
Just you and I,
Two star-crossed lovers.
But we were so wrong.
Now who is going to save us?
Somebody save us.
Somebody.
We can't stop this from happening.
