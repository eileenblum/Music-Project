Thank you for your words,
They are truly needed on nights like these,
When lungs collapse and hearts become lodged in throats.
You make me choke.
You make me.
You make me choke,
Preventing the right words from escaping.
It was only a kiss,
One fucking kiss.
Where did he come from?
This was ours,
I have so much love to give and the "dead" need it more than your whore of a heart does.
We drove dead highways into oblivion,
Shooting every star with our eyes,
Write our names on the glass waiting for any kind of sign.
Can you feel it drag across your throat?
We're so in love.
