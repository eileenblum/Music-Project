Who knew this is where we'd come to?
You always forgot to dot your I's,
And cross your T's.
Your writing was never legible,
But I know you meant good things.
We are a fucking abomination,
Love to love,
Look below at the city radiant with orange and smoke.
Was this because of us?
If so,
Let's celebrate with a glass of wine,
And a toast to those who made it out alive.
Why am I not surprised to see that we made it out alive?
Speak to me,
We can still be perfect like the charred city that held onto us for so long.
Tonight is a night to remember.
It's the start of the end of us.
Bleed baby,
Bleed for me.
