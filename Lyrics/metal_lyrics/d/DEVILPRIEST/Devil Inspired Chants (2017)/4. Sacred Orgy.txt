Sweaty bodies rub together
Under a trance of worship
In the shadows of the statues
Of the ancient gods

In the vapour of the breath of the mighty Baal
Thirsty tongues grope for the fluids of lust
Fingers knead breasts and squeeze erected nipples
The sacred orgy, a praise to wanton Anat

Oh goddess Anat, we ask thy blessing
Let the cum shall flow
Oh wanton Anat, squirt thy juices, into our mouths

Gliding on the wings of raging orgasms
Away from self destructive ordinariness
Invigorated by the streams of sperm and piss
I fall in the arms of divine inspiration

Oh goddess Anat, let us drink
From thy stream of abundance
oh wanton Anat, squirt thy juices, into our mouths

Orgy...
