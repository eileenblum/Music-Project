- The Watcher -

I was born from nothingness
Before divine hatred Spells of weak
I'm the plague unseen
I'm the Watcher, Destroyer, Pre Nihilist

I unleashed the fire of demonic winds
I'm the ancient liar The Ancestral sin
I demanded blood and demand it still
The work of man let it be defaced

Speak of me not, you â no glory dwells in me

Upon the blasting winds
I'm The Master of shattered dreams

- The Conjuration of Destruction -

I opened the gates â Hate
To carnal disgrace â Scorn
I condemned this world â Sin
Again

With blood on my hands â War
I digging the Nails â Blood

I'm Antichrist Beast

It repenteth me not
that my summons doth ride
upon the blasting winds
which multiply the sting
of my bitterness

I'm Antimatter Beast

And great black slimy shapes
Shall rise from brackish pits
and vomit forth their pustulence
Into your puny, rusty brain.

Go!!!

Upon the blasting winds
I'm Master of broken dreams
