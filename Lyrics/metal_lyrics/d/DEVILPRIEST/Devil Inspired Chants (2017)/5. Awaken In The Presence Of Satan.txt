Awaken in the presence of Satan

Dismal pulse of magical incantations
Brings equilibrium to the senses
Orgiastic fulfillment and exhaustions
Tunes and focuses the consciousness

I see things I haven't seen before

He draws near to me and insufflates
The Breath of demonic enlightenment
Sweeping away deteriorated remnants
Of sin, redemption and sacrifice

Funneling through the vibe of darkness
I grab the rays of Lucifer's light
To hack the way through the curtain
Of delusive sacrosanct dream

Awaken in the presence of Satan
Awaken in the presence of Satan
