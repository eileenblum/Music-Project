Waving my way through apostasy and transgression
Scrutinizing the mysteries of the evil cults
Plunged into the darkness of abyss
I touch the wing of a demon

Immerse in the maelstrom of frenetic catharsis

Breath in
Inhale the spirit of Shiva
The giver of spiritual emancipation
Breath out
Suspend the nerves of consciousness
Enjoy the bliss of Samadhi

Here it comes
Catharsis, maelstrom of frenetic catharsis

Namo Shivaya namaha Aum

Detached from holiness my mind is a like serpent
Slithering through the corridors of enjoyment
It basks in the light of Lucifer

Thus let the light shine

Breath in, oh Shiva
Lover of your devotees hear me
Breath out
Grant me with all of my desires
