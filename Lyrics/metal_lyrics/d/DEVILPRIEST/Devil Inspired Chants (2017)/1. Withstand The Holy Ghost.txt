Born surrounded by dogmas
Taught to kneel and pray
Forced to follow and bow
Now I deny these rules

Shatterer of chains
Unbound my will
I choose your way
Satan god of man

I choose your way
Satan god of man

I carve your sigil on my skin
To seal my pledge
I call the demon's name to give me strength
To withstand the holy ghost

Put the blade into the flames
Carve your skin, clear your soul
Stand up against the prophets
Cast out the holy ghost

Turn your mind towards Satan
Immerse in the perverted visions
Renounce the salvation
Exalt hell

Shatterer of chains
Unbound my will
I choose your way
Satan god of man

I carve your sigil on my skin
To seal my pledge
I call the demon's name to give me strength
To withstand the holy ghost
