Moon shines through the clouds
Trees throw entangled shadows
My path disappears
In the fucking darkness
I follow the howls
The unholy night embrace me

Disquieting call drags me deep
Into the murky distance
Wind blows out a fog at a cemetery
And brings scent of death
I see blood on crypt doors
And take my steps down

Her naked body awaits my blade
I cut skin, blood flows, breath decays
I stab, slash, tear the guts out
I fuck her corpse and eat her flesh

Death throes of the living creature
Initiates ominous chanting
Offerimus tibi, Domine Satanas
Calicem voluptatis carnis

I stand drenched in blood
And hear the chant coming
From all around me
Voices are coming closer and closer
Dismal timbre vibrates in the air
And the bell starts to chime

Disquieting call drags me deep
Into the murky distance
Wind blows out a fog at a cemetery
And brings scent of death

The sacrifice has been accepted

Her naked body awaits my blade
I cut skin, blood flows, breath decays
I stab, slash, tear the guts out
I fuck her corpse and eat her flesh
