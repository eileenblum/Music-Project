Black wings flicker in the dim light of candles
Horned shadow prowls the halls shrouded in the dark

Wind brings whispered oath
An incantation to the Evil Gods
Sharp blade gleams
And the smell of blood strikes the nostrils

The ritual starts

We swear our lives to mighty Devil
We seal this oath with the unholy blood
We are born of shining light of Lucifer

Glory
Mastery
Glory
Supremacy

Upon the female altar stained with sperm and wine
Urges are unleashed, desires are satisfied

In the face of the throne of damnation, nothing is sacred
Under the reign of Satan profanity triumphs

We swear our lives to mighty Devil
We seal this oath with our unholy blood
We are born of shining light of Lucifer
