[Words: T. Grose, Music: T. Grose / S. Marshall]

A quest for a wealth untold
Reaping the fields of gold
A chance to live as a king for every man
Corruption within the state
Political disarray
No freedom or justice for all in the land
Oh... Our rights denied
Oh... Prepare now to fight
So, we swear allegiance, a rebellion to come
A new flag is raised toward the sun...

[Chorus:]
As we stand below the Southern Cross
Brothers united as one
Stand together - a united force
We will all overcome...
Renewed by the strength within
The oath sworn the wait begins
In grim resolve for what lies ahead
At dawn a surprise attack
Authorities striking back
The fields of gold now stained with seas of red
Oh... Our people may die
No... They can't take our pride
Oh, we swore allegiance, a rebellion was won
A new flag still raised toward the sun...

[Repeat chorus]

Though we fought with our honor and pride
We're outnumbered a hundred to one
Defeated, but history showed
We have truly won..

[Solo: Tim / Stu]

WE SWEAR BY THE SOUTHERN CROSS
TO STAND TRULY BY EACH OTHER,
AND FIGHT TO DEFEND
OUR RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES.

[Repeat chorus x2]
