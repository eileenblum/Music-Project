[Words / Music: S. Marshall / T. Grose]

Look within for a place deep inside me
Where I can believe
Seek the truth my own master, my own king
Where my spirit is free
Seeking gold and the treasure external
Fight within for the chance to grow
See the real man within, he's eternal
Deep inside we all know
We all search for the mysteries of Eden
I now know what's inside - there's no turning back...

[Chorus:]

Every man has a kingdom inside him
Will he ever see
What is here in the now is the reason
Find the path for his soul to be free
Deep inside is the key...
Pushing on with the strength of conviction
Now within there's a fire inside
Find the answer without contradiction
My soul free to fly
If we look to the power within us
Look inside, there is no turning back...

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Stu / Tim]
