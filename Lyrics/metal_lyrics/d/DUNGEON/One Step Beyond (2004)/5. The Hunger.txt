[Words: T. Grose, Music: T. Grose / S. Marshall]

Eyes of a child
Watch as the world goes by
Yet to be torn away
From innocent times
As time goes by
We're soon taught to realize
Our dreams are but dust in the wind
And innocence dies
Over and over
We're thrown to the ground
But over and over
We're clawing our way back to daylight again

[Chorus 1:]
Remember the hunger that burns inside
Remember the fire within
Take hold of your dreams with both hands
And don't let go again...
Sand through our hands
Time seems to slip away
Harder to keep the faith
And face a new day
Over and over
We fall to our knees
But over and over
We know in our hearts that we'll climb to our feet

[Chorus 2:]
Remember the hunger that burns inside (hunger burns like)
Remember the fire within (fire within)
Take hold of your dreams with both hands (hold your dreams and)
And don't let go (don't let go)
Search for the strength that beats in your heart (strength inside your)
And search for the hunger inside (heart and hunger)
Remember the dreams of a child (dreams within a child)
And oh, don't let go again... (don't let go)

[All solos: Tim]

Over and over
We're thrown to the ground
But over and over
We know in our hearts that these dreams never end

[Repeat chorus 2]
