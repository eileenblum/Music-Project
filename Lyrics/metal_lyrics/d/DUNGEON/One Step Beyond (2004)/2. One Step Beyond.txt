[Words / Music: T. Grose]

Walked the world today
Passed the lines of clouded eyes
Go to church and pray
Social farce, no God inside
Open your eyes
You'll realize
In this sea of senseless lies
You live your life...
Politicians say
All the 'truths' we need to hear
Blindly following
Is it faith or is it fear?
Open your mind
Soon you'll find
In a world of compromise
You see the light...

[Chorus:]
I've gone...
One step beyond the truth
One step beyond the lie
One step beyond the pain
One step beyond...
I see a new day's morning
Arise to face the dawn
One step beyond the dark
One step beyond the light
One step beyond the fear
One step beyond...
I see a new day dawning
We rise to heed the warning call...

[Solo: all solos by Tim]

Open your eyes
You'll realize
In this sea of senseless lies
You live your life...

[Repeat chorus]
