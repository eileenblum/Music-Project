[Words / Music: S. Marshall / T. Grose]

Young man he walks alone
The power unto his own
The ancient arts under command
Stand fast, don't run away
What was learned is now to betray
I'll fight you, I'll kill you
You've nowhere left to run
Your life within my power
Immortal forever
The boy is now a man
His family honor now betrayed
His vengeance burning deep within
Stand fast, won't run away
What was learned is now to betray
I'll fight you, I'll kill you
You've nowhere left to run
Your life within my power
Immortal forever

[Chorus:]
It was developed in the art of war
My blood and spirit made of iron fury
Through blood and battle scarred
The warrior now foretold
His spirit rises to the sky
More than a mortal man
Crush all that dare to face me
I'll fight you, I'll kill you
You've nowhere left to run
Your life within my power
Immortal forever

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Tim / Stu / Stu]

Passed on unto the son
The power of the fallen one
The ancient arts reborn forever
Stand fast, don't run away
The art of war shall rise again
I'll fight you, I'll kill you
You've nowhere left to run
Your life within my power
Immortal forever

[Repeat chorus]
