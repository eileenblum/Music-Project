[Words / Music: T. Grose]

A bad place, a dark space
The lines that weather my face
I stand alone before the storm
Walk with me and you'll see
The flame that burns within me
A fire so cold to keep us so warm
You see the darkness in my eyes
The seed of life inside me dies
A search for the truth, to find a reason why
A voice cries out in pain in the night...

[Chorus:]
Riding the storm wind
And facing the demons inside
A thousand sins behind my eyes
A cry from the blackness
Alone with the darkness inside
Forever will I walk against the wind...
No rhyme and no reason
My world betrayed by treason
I stumble blind, what's going on?
Can't see the road that lies beyond
A need to feel where I belong
When everywhere I turn seems to guide me wrong
Running through the night for so long...

[Repeat chorus]

[Solo: Tim / Stu]

[Repeat chorus x2]
