A memory of a time
When we were proud to live our dreams
There'll be no compromise
Standing tall, we will be surpreme

No one could crush our will to be
This time we're gonna make them see...

The resurrection time is now
Forever we survive
Back from the grave to take control
Forever
The resurrection time is now
Returning from the fire
We have the strength we have the power
Forever we survive...

They tried to tear us down
Rape our hearts and steal our dreams
This time we won't hold back
Glory bound, we claim our victory

Standing tall and standing proud
The beast inside is breaking out...
