These games that you're playing
Have gone on for far too long
Ulterior motives
And hidden agendas and lies
Transparent like glass
I saw through you right from the start
It's the end of the line, now it's time
Judgment day...

You can't run or hide
You know that I'll find you
Oh, it's now your time
You've reached your judgment day...

So blatantly clear
Are you stupid or are you insane?
A blind man could see your deceit
But still you try - why?
Feeding your ego
I tell you that you're not that good
Pull in your head now, my friend
Or I'll take you down...
