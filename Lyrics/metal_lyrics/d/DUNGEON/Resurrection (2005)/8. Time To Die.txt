Suffer my child, bleed for me now
Cleanse your soul, set your spirit free
Fly for me or the devil take your soul
Burn for me, you will believe

Rituals turning in my head
My senses dulled, I'm burning...

I see my life before my eyes
There's nothing there I can deny
What have I done in my time
Screaming out before I die...

Rescue me - somebody save me
Demons in my mind driving me insane
Darkness all around taking blood from me
Searing heat burning, peeling my skin

One more chance, one more life
There's still time to see the light
