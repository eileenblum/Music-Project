Death - the anti-hero
Champion of the doomed
I'll be there to end your life
To take you to your tomb
I will seal your fate, before me you'll decay
There's no escape, your soul is gone
I'll steal your life away

I'll end your suffering, I'll end your pain
When you take your final breath
Then you'll know my name...

I am death (death - death - death) [x4]

I live within the hungry children on the streets
I'm the disease that kills you while you sleep
I am the needle that's in the junkie's arm
I am the tormentor - the storm before the calm

They call me the reaper
I am the man in black
When you give your life to me
There is no turning back
You will know the end is near
You'll see my toothy grin
Now you leave this life of hell
But another one begins...
