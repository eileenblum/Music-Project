So here we're stading now
So many years passed
Old words just like the stars
So much still left unsaid
Yet we know there's nothing more to say

The chapter is closing now
Stand at the crossroads
It's time to find a way
And as the sun goes down
We're walking away

Severing ties, severing ties
It's come to the time to say goodbye
When it's time to leave, it's time to go
When it's time you'll know
It's time to say your last goodbyes...

So thanks for the memories
Locked up tight
And carried deep within
And maybe cross paths one day
And new ties begin
