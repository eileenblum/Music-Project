On every corner there's a preacher
In every city there's a prayer
And as they crucify each other
I contemplate the open air... yeah...

Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

And every man becomes a saviour
So in the name peace condemn
It's funny how the big solution
Just brings the greatest sinners in... yeah...
Righteous to the end
As they rape your children
And like children we obey...

A holy war on the horizon
Same old excuses still at hand
They say he made us in his likeness
I say we shaped him like a man...
