"One day the saviour will come and my people will be free..."

I've walked through the lonely places
I've seen years of hurt in their eyes
And passing the empty faces
The story told so many times

Now it's time to fight
Together we unite - Tonight, we shall arise!

Their spirit lay crushed before them
All hope gone before it began
A new cause, behold the saviour
The chosen, a leader of men

Now it's time to fight
Together we unite
From out of the darkness and leading us on in...

A rise to power, the world is in our hands
Marching on, we fight as one
A rise to power, we spread throughout the lands
Cast aside the fallen ones
The armies of the light, we shall arise!

I am the chosen one
The hand of God upon the world
Oppose my word and you'll all be destroyed

As time marches on eternal
Growing in strength, my word is feared
Don't pray to your gods - you now pray to me!
Heed my words and save your soul...

A rise to power, the world is in my hands
A sign from God, Im the the chosen one
A rise to power, we spread throughout the lands
Cast aside the fallen ones
The armies show my might, we shall arise!

Marching on and on, to my eyes I do no wrong
Blinded to the truth - I'm just a man
Believing my own words, distort the world with lies
Into madness I descend - forevermore...

A rise to power, the world was in my hands
Cast aside - the fallen one
The final hour - into madness I descend
A final curse, though tonight I burn
My spirit will survive, I shall arise!
