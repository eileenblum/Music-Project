I've heard about the secret voices
Claiming to be heard
Their souls were lost in madness
Never to return
Reaching out from within the circle
Dictating all our lives
No feelings felt, all questions answered
Too easy we deny

Can't leave this realm behind
Or all I am inside me dies
Defending the innocents' every life...

Lost - in this nightmare, a world full of fear
Where madness hides
Lost - in the shadows when darkness falls
I'm lost inside my mind...

Sunrise holds no guarantees
Foreclosure or relief
The system failed, the silence broken
Crushed beyond belief

Lost - in this nightmare, a world full of fear
Where madness hides
Lost - in the shadows when darkness falls
Inside my mind
Blind - in the twilight that comes for us all
In the dead of night
Lost - when there's nowhere left to run
I'm lost inside my mind...

Is this real or is this a dream?
Can't leave this world behind me now
Again I pray for the dawn...
