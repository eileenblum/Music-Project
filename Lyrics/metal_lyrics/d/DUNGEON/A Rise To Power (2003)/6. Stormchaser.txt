Oh - Thunder roars, the sky above is black
Lightning cracks the sky
Oh - Horizontal rain that drives us back
But still we've got to try...

Stormchaser
Stormchaser
Stormchaser
Stormchaser

Oh - Electronic sensors watch the sky
Chaos all around
Oh - Fujita scale left somewhere far behind
We face a monster on the ground...

Stormchaser
Stormchaser
Stormchaser
Stormchaser

Stormchaser
Stormchaser
Stormchaser
Stormchaser
