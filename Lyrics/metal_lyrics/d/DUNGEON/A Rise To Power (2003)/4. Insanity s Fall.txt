United we stand
All intention is clear
Enraged by injustice
No longer blinded by fear

Young blood within us
Tired of wasting time
We will crush you - all! (DIE!)

Never doubting
Always in control
Believing in something
We've never known at all

Young blood within us
Strength born of fire
We will rise up - high!

Insanity's fall - divided and torn
In glory or death we will rise
Fire in our eyes, in cold frost of night
Our guide into darkness will die...

Hardened by anger
Our salvation draws near
My heart, my soul
My life - my own

Too late - I know
I see the forces rising
Before the lines I pray
The future will be...

Insanity's fall - divided and torn
In glory or death we will rise
Fire in our eyes, in cold frost of night
Our guide into darkness will die...
