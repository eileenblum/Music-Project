Servants of the dark lord
Gathered in Death's chamber
Before the blood red throne of the king
Out from the darkness
Comes true evil

Nothing can stop death's true men
That will destropy all the goodness in life
And leave this world dead and decaying

Unholy Triumph
Eternal Darkness
