Our curse, humanity
The weakness upon this earth

We're all but slaves to the flesh
Deceived by the illusion of life

Imprisoned in this rotting void
Nothing goes beyond
No hopes or dreams
Only darkness fills it all

Mankind is the abomination
The breed of weakness
We're a disease upon this world
Only death can set us free
