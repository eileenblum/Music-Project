Whu-whuh, my dogs - did you see that? Yeah!
Pushing that stroller in that skirt with those shoes?
Mmm, gawd, damn!

I see it - don't believe it
I feel it
Jealousy creeping
I know you're taken
Someone's loved one
And that's a tough one
I seen you out with your child
The thought is driving me wild
Can't believe that body had a baby
Daydreams making me crazy

Tease me, please me
I want you to need me
You can beat me, treat me
I want you to freak me
I'm living for the hope,
It's crazy I know
That it's dirty and I'm filth
But I'm looking for a MILF

MILF, MILF, MILF
Mother, I'd like to fuck
MILF, MILF (that's right)
Mother, I'd like to fuck
MILF, MILF (I said it)
Mother, I'd like to fuck
MILF, MILF
A mother

Back up - I feel ashamed
You don't know my name
Would you play the game?
I would never wreck a happy home
Do you feel alone?
Are you in the zone?
The only one that I need
My homies don't believe me
Society says it ain't right
But I wanna do you all night

Tease me, please me
I want you to need me
You can beat me or treat me
I want you to freak me
I'm living for the hope,
It's crazy I know
That it's dirty and I'm filth
But I'm looking for a MILF

MILF, MILF, MILF
Mother, I'd like to fuck
MILF, MILF (I said it)
Mother, I'd like to fuck
MILF, MILF (fuck it)
Mother, I'd like to fuck
MILF, MILF
Oh, mother

Hah-hah-hah, it's a dirty job, but someoneâs got to do her

I see you at the supermarket and the shopping mall
I saw you on the internet, where you show it all
I know you're just a fantasy, âcause you're someone's mom
How something that feels so right could be so wrong?

I saw your mommy and your mommy's hot
I saw your mommy and your mom's a MILF

Hah!

MILF, MILF, MILF
Mother, I'd like to fuck
MILF, MILF (thatâs right)
Mother, I'd like to fuck
MILF, MILF (oh yeah)
Mother, I'd like to fuck
MILF, MILF
Oh, mother

(Children tell your mother not to walk my way)
