Huh? Say what? Hell, yeah!
That's what â oh!

There's no disclaimer, apologies,
No introspective, just me being me
And I don't listen to what they say
That if you play the game then you have to pay,

Well, I don't believe them and all their lies
âCause only I can live my life
So, save your warnings, another lecture
'Cause if you got it I already get ya

Hell, yeah! Let's get it started right now
Hell, yeah! We're gonna turn it up loud
Hell, yeah! Bring your bad attitude
Say hell, yeah! If you're feeling it too

I'm always in motion, stay on the go
I swear my life is like a rodeo! Whoa!
You feel the pressure, I feel it too
Drawing us together with a magnitude, yes

We're getting closer, but in between
They try to separate us like quarantine
And that can't stop us (No!), we got the fire
Together you and I can light up the sky

Hell, yeah! Let's get it started right now
Hell, yeah! We're gonna turn it on out
Hell, yeah! Bring your bad attitude
Say hell, yeah! If you're feeling it too

Hell, yeah! Leave your problems behind
Hell, yeah! Let's get together tonight
Hell, yeah! Everything in the groove
Say hell, yeah! If you're feeling it too

Wuh, alright

So, if you're with us, let me hear you say
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!
And they can never stop us anyway, no
Hell, no! Hell, no!
So if you're with us, let me hear you say
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!

Hell, yeah! Let's get it started right now
Hell, yeah! We're gonna turn it on out
Hell, yeah! Bring your bad attitude
Say hell, yeah! If you're feeling it too

Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah!
Hell, yeah! Yah-yah
