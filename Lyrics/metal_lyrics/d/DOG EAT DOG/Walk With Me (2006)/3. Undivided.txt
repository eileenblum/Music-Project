(We're undivided, but undecidedâ¦)

I got questions, is that all there is?
Like how much more blood can a stone give?
If you squeeze it enough, thereâs been reason enough
To take the good with the tough times joy to the rough times

Shit used to be knit
Tighter than cashmere
How did it get all?
Where do we go from here?
Just know you're my heart, but I've gotta confess
I'm thinking we should give it a rest

We're undivided (I love you to death!)
But undecided

(We're undivided, but undecidedâ¦)

I'm staying open to just about anything
But more changes and the song remains the same
Approaching the next chapter with laughter
Hoping for the best, but preparing for disaster

Have to self preserve, self pretend, self medicate
You adapt and matriculate to the current situation
Compromise slide through complications in our relations

We're undivided (I love you to death!)
But undecided

You say, you're confused boo
Well boy, I'm confused too
I'm down for anything in the world involving you
Baby, make up your mind and tell me what you wanna do?
âCause I already made my decision about you

We're undivided (You know I love you to death!)
But undecided
(We stay positional even when it's critical)
(I got your back and that's unconditional)
We're undivided
(Always been together - done it all whatever)
(We could make this last forever)
But undecided
(Do what you gotta do)
(It's a crazy world and I'll take my chances with you!)
