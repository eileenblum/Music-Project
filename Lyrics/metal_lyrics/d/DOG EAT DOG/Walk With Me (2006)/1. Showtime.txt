What getâs you going? What getâs you hot?
What drives you crazy? So you can't stop
Are you that person? Are you too shy?
I can see the answer, it's in your eye

Right backstage we crawl and creep
Like we're zombies, that can't sleep
Roll them bones in king size sheets
Smoke and toke until eyes bleed
You been waiting all this time
Just to be the first in line
Now we want to see you fly
Come on everybody it'sâ¦

Showtime!
Come on get down with the sound
We're spinning you round and around, c'mon
Showtime - doing it every day
And let me hear you holler now - we want more, yeah!

Sound is pumping, amps on 10
Crowd is thumping adrenaline
The roofs on fire, beers on ice
The boys in baggies
The girls in tights

Rock'n'roll, hip hop and funk
R'n'b, hardcore and punk
Doesn't matter if you're drunk
Straight or sober smoking blunts
People screaming in your face
Blow the roof right of this place
All you need is just a taste
Everybody here we go!

Showtime!
Come on get down with the sound
We're spinning you round and around, c'mon
Showtime â yeah, get out on the floor
Let me hear you holler now - we want more!
Showtime!
Come on get down with the sound
Live in the underground
Showtime - doing it everyday
And let me hear you holler now - we want more, yeah!

So people, do you really want it?
Tell me - we want more!
Everybody, every time - one more time
We want more!
Make me believe you, keep it sexy
We want more!
Feels good - I think, I'm gonnaâ¦
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Showtime!
Come on get down with the sound
Live in the underground
Showtime â yeah, get out on the floor
And let me hear you holler now - we want more!
Showtime!
Come on get down with the sound
We're spinning you round and around, c'mon
Showtime - doing it every day
And let me hear you holler now - we want more now!

Yeah, yeah!
