You wanna step into my size 9's - fine
Just remember that I mountain climb
Over terrain changing constantly
Like the weather
It might be better if you reconsider
You're not equipped
To handle the business
Of grown man shit
How we're dealing with big things?
Known only to me
And I think you may agree
That staying in your shoes
Is the move for your kiddies

You can't do what I do
You won't - you won't go where I go
You don't see the things I see
You don't - you don't know what I know

Would you reveal
The things you conceal
If you were told brutal truth
Given proof
Could you deal?
Take the hard way
Of principal and ritual
Such is the true path
Of an individual
Would you conceive
Or even believe
If it was calling your name
Could you even receive?
Deliberate steps
Dogmatic moves made correct
And gettin' paper under tables
To cashing pay checks, yes!

You can't do what I do
You won't - you won't go where I go
You don't see the things I see
You don't - you don't know what I know

Where it begins?
When will it end?
That's the prominent question
In the method of deception
You never know
How situations will go
But you're playing the role
When you try to control, see
Is it your pride?
Keeps it alive
You're all twisted inside
You got something to hide
You're not prepared for this attitude
âCause you something to prove
Nothing to lose

So what's your dark secret? Huh?
Where the fuck do you keep it?

You can't do what I do
You won't - you won't go where I go (what?)
You don't see the things I see
You don't - you don't know what I know
