[feat. Darryl Jenifer][Chorus:]
Who's the king? Who's the king? Who's the king? Who?
Who's the king? Who's the king? Whoâ¦ hah?
Who's the king? Who's the king? Who is the king? [x2]

You're the king if you can sing like the king of rock n' roll
Filled with a soul and all fucked up on Demerol
Like the King
you're only headed for the ground
Your own Graceland, Your body never found

I smell a rat up the back
But not a former champion
The hardest man alive's in an Indiana prison
What does Donnie do about that?
He lets his main man rot
As his pockets grow fat

Don't snooze, you gotta make your moves
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt

Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt
But still Rodney King got treated like dirt
And why can't we all get along?
Why get along with the cops
They beat you like a dog

jumping high with pride
in the red, white and blue
Was it the thrills, the spills
Of the Rocket cycle dude?
The King dare devil
Took it to another level,
Evil Knievel, a well paid rebel

[2x]
Don't snooze, you gotta make your moves
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt

Oh-oh!

Yeahâ¦ you dog

The Dog Eat Dog you wanna know who ah di king
But dinga-linga-ling jah man the school bell ring
But first you hafi know what typa ganja fi bring
Say, chat the ridim jah man a song we ah go sing

Here mi now youth come check the listing
The one Michael Jackson ah di king of the pop
The one Don King youth man you get boxed
Elvis Presley ah di king of the rock

Say, Run-D.M.C. dem ah di king of hip-hop
Butta Dog Eat Dog ah di cream of the crop
Selassie I ah sit down pon high top, pon high top

[Chorus]
