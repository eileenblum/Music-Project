Rise above
You can rise above
With a little bit of love

Life has taught me one thing
How it is I wanna live
Love has shown another light
Gave me, something to believe in
There is love hate, birth and death

For us all
In these pits do not fall
Rise above

Detachment from the body's needs
Cannot live my life in fear
From my mind I must be free
Free at last I see so clearly
There is wealth, loss, pleasure, pain
In this world
So you know
This will go
Quick as it comes

And like the smoke we rise
You better open your eyes
Cuz your soul can't hide behind the lies
Open up and breathe
You gotta plant the seed
Check the flow of the breath over reed
