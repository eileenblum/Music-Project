Maybe I fly too much
Maybe you're high too much
I don't know, but I know
That I'm buggin'

Maybe I think too much
Think maybe you're out of touch
I don't know, but I know
That I'm buggin'

On and on and on it goes
Where it stops nobody knows
Round and round and round again
It feels like this will never end

Maybe I bitch too much
Shut the fzzuck up
I don't know, but I know
That I'm bugging

Maybe I smoke too much
Please put out that butt
I don't know, but I know
That I'm bugging

I'm buggin'
