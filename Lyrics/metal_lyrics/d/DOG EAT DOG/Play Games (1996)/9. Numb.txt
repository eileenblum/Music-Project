Could I fly around the world
If my wings were really broke
And see so clearly
Drowning in grey smoke
I've got to stay quiet
But there's so much to say
If  I could feel my arms
I'd push it all away
I know there is a future
And the best is still to come
When all I have are feelings
Why am I always...

Wishing that a moment
Was really like an hour
The every penny that I earn
Could balance out the dollar
Something that's spent on patience
Would make me patron saint
You know I might be ordained today
I guess I'll have to wait
Hurry up and wait

Gotta break it out
Gonna turn the lights on
See what's there for me
Take a look around
With an open shutter
There's a world to see
