Check check one two on the boom shot
Here's the one on the gun in the street spot
Little boyz in the hood far from L A.
Got the heat on the street
Now they're ready to play
Got the look of a crook
Now they got the prop
Gassed up head full of lead
Might even drop a cop
Or not, who knows, it could go any way
But fun with a gun the games children play

Why did someone have to be the victim
Of a stupid game you shouldn't be playing
Don't you know that guns aren't for children
I tried to tell you but you didn't listen

The second verse skit is on the hearse tip
Young fingers on triggers and bodies gonna get hit
Lick fe shot's that go bang in the night
Just that quick you know he lost his life
Such a shame that the game
Had to end like that
Body dies mama cries
When the hammer cracks
I know you didn't mean it
The damage is done
It's what you get
Playing with gun, son

Bulletproof - it's a shame
Bulletproof - and you know the game
One mistake, a lifetime of pain
Hell your cell yourself to blame

Bulletproof - no you ain't
Bulletproof - and nobody is
A gun ain't a toy, toys are for kids

Click-clack-pop-pow look what you did
