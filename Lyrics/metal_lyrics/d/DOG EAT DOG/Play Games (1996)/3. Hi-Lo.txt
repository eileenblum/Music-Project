It's not about a revelation
It's not about some religion
It's not about a house of worship
It's about our redemption

We have to make it work
We've got to live, give, don't trip

Why do you ask what I believe in
When we both know that you don't care
If heaven's high
Then hell is low
How do we know
Where we all go

It's not about sectarianism
It's not about superstition
It's not about what you believe in
It's about our salvation

Don't ask why
I don't know
I'm just trying
To save my soul
