Now you never know when it's your time
It's always there in the back of your mind
Read it in the paper see it on TV
Never think it could happen to me

Accidents occur we don't know why
Just look what happened to Princess Di
One car crashed and the whole world cried
No time to say goodbye

Won't see your future in a crystal ball
Your psychic friends can't help you at all
Can't buy time at a shopping mall
The writing's on the wall

Struck by lighting, fall in a well
It sounds far fetched but you never can tell
When you're swimming with sharks that you can't repel
No one can hear you yell

[Chorus:]
You never know where
You won't know how
When you least expect it
Expect the unexpected

Wonât ever know why
It all comes down
When you least expect it
Expect the unexpected

Boom! What a terrible sound
Planes go up, and crash back down
You never thought, when you left the ground
That you would not be found

Took a big chance when you made that bet
Laid it on the line now you're starting to sweat
This is one day you'll never forget
Cash in your pockets and no regrets

Fly in the sky, or sail in a boat
It don't matter which way you go
Titanic, don't panic,
There's other ways to cross the Atlantic

Don't be surprised by what you hear
Things aren't always as they appear
The unexpected ain't nothing to fear
The truth is always clear

[Chorus:]
You never know where
You won't know how
When you least expect it
Expect the unexpected

Wonât ever know why
It all comes down
When you least expect it
Expectâ¦ (expectâ¦)

(Stay away)

[Chorus]

Come in and check it
No ones protected
To be infected
Expect the unexpected
You must respect it
Stop living reckless
We are all affected

Yo, check the method
It's getting hectic
Prepare for wreck, kid
Expect the unexpected
Keep it in perspective
It's all subjective
Let's get connected
