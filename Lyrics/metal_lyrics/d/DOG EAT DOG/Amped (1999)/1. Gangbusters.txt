(- Let me ask you something, sugar
Are you the kind of girl that relax of music?
- Oh, sure
- Hey, hey, I knew you one knew it. Hah, hah, hah, hahâ¦
I am puttinâ itâs all right now)

Back in the old days, gangsters were all the rage
Crime was the front page of news and TV
A group known to no one, blows were all low ones
The cops had shit to go on they had no leads

Drive by shootings
Murders at will
Pay for protection
Or have yourself killed

Gangbusters,
Gangbusters,
Gangbusters,
Gangbusters

Guys like Al Capone who loved being unknown
Made themselves at home and still got away
The law couldn't catch him or none of his hit men
He died in prison for taxes unpaid

Screw prohibition
Crimes go unsolved
Elliot Ness
Couldn't wrap up the mob

Hey ho - Who the gangbusters?
Hey yo - You the gangbusters?
That's right - We the gangbusters [2x]

Some say crime don't pay, they didn't feel that way
And so I would have to say that I do agree
The gangbusters in the past proved they were there to last
By knife or shotgun blast for the world to see

Gangbusters,
Gangbusters,
Gangbusters,
Gangbusters!
