Don't just sit there, get up!

Check the groove, born to make you move.
Paid some dues, never sang the blues.
How I choose to give the love to you
Take it on the road all across the globe.

We've got people feeling hot from state to state,
Beats hit harder than a heavy weight.
Others are lame, playing the game, wordly acclaim,
That's how were straight just gaining the fame.

[Chorus:]
(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Iâve got something, that I wanna say
(No, no, no, no, noâ¦) Don't just sit there, get up, get up!

(Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Iâve got something, that I wanna say
(No, no, no, no, noâ¦) Don't just sit there, get up!

Now you know that we will rock every show
And keep the money closer from here to Tokyo.
Bond blood with brothers, sisters, I love ya,
Never uncover, let you discover.

How we got you open, let me make a point (OK)
We ain't the ones who gonna disappoint (world up)
What's understood, you wanna feel good,
Carry on that vibe back in your neighbourhood.

Who got the hip that can make you hop?
Who holds the rock and can make it roll?
Who brings it live with the party vibe?
Put your hands high, shut your eyes and scream!

[Chorus]

Yo, here's a little something for the worldly wise,
As we continue to galvanize.
We let these fakers scratch their heads,
As these bakers proceed to make the bread rise.

[Chorus 2x]

Come on!
Keep âem people in the front, you are number one
Donât stop the party rock
Keep âem people in the back, you may had to act, come on
Donât stop the party rock (rock)
