[Chorus:]
Always the same and that's a shame.
The only change is the name of the game.
I know it sucks, âcause times are tuff
And it's ruff but you gotta keep your head up. [2x]

What do you want?
I want a shot to follow my dreams, they're all I got.
What do you need?
I need a chance to go for it all, âcause I got plans.
What do you got?
I got nothing but fire burning inside for all I desire.
What do you see?
All I can see is walls obstacles in my way they're gonna fall.

[Chorus]

How do you feel?
It's all wrong, but if it's not kill me I'm getting strong.
Where do you go?
On that I must decide exhibiting a sense of self.
What is the deal?
Just playing with time, learning a lot, trying to get mine
What do you know?
I don't know why it hurts, but if it's really worth something it takes hard work.

[Chorus]

Always the same and that's a shame.
The only change is the name of the game.
I know it sucks, âcause times are tuff
And it's ruff but you gotta keep your head up.

Always the same and that's a shame.
The only change is the name of the game (yeah)
I know it sucks, âcause times are tuff
And it's ruff but you gotta keep your head up.

Always the same
I know it's ruff, âcause times are tuff (keep it off, keep it off)
Always the same (yes)
I know it's ruff, âcause times are tuff
But you gotta keep your head up.
