One life to get it right, there's no time to waste
One track in this rat race, keep up with the pace
Who is sure, the rich or the poor
I'll take my time and be secure
Time is now we're all going down
I'll go for mine someway or somehow

[Chorus:]
Modern day devils pushing things to dangerous levels
Latter day saints promises for those who wait

One way to walk a path following a code (all right)
Another way is to blaze a trail driven by your hopes
Chance we take, choice to make
Answer to who at the end of the day
Living in faith you just got to wait
Surrender your will to a power that's great

[Chorus 2x]

God helps those who help themselves
God helps those who help themselvesâ¦

Pick your fight, choose your side
There's a thin line between wrong and what's right
Time will tell, see for yourself
Don't bet with your life, it's bad for your health

[Chorus]

Modern day devils pushing things to dangerous levels
Latter day saints promises but I canât wait
