Yeah, it's a big world out there
And most of it is water.
So you better learn how to swim real good
Or you should know how to fly

This is motion, taking too long, like a bad song fly to Hong Kong,
High as the sky without the bong.
Never the less, the level of stress was endless,
I felt pressed in the plane cabin class business.

I remember what it took to get us here,
The mad years we performed just for the beer.
Now we hover undercover in the atmosphere.
Intergalactic players, true pioneers

[Chorus:]
Big wheel, spinninâ around
Breaking on cities and rippinâ thru town
Get down time to flip that frown,
Keep your body moving from your feet to your crown.

This is the âJâ to the âOâ, âHâ to the âNâ. âCâ and then I'm on.
I spy you like Bond. âNâ to the âORâ. I'll put you in the âERâ,
Fuming like a cigar, screaming like a marshal.

Electric guitar check, strap me in there, a true circle, the perfect square.
Hot like flares, danger, beware you must prepare.
Only strategic affairs turn boys to millionaires.

[Chorus 2x]

Now

[Rap]

We got to keep things moving, forever staying in motion.

Get down (so what, so what, so what, so what, so what, peace)

Big wheel, spinninâ around
Big wheelâ¦
Big wheel, spinninâ around
Big wheelâ¦

Papa never gave me tools to the trade,
Yo, I'm tryinta make the grade.
Suckas think I got it made. I won't trade or give aid.
You'll be played like arcades,

Follow the (big wheel) wherever it takes you
Nothing, but the truth
You must pursue in the endeavor.
Remember to yourself be true explore the world.
It's a treasure if you only knew
Itâs just aâ¦

[Chorus 2x]

Big wheel, spinninâ around
Big wheelâ¦
Big wheel, spinninâ around
Big wheelâ¦
