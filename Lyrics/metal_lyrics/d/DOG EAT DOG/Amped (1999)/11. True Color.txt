Gave you all that I had
I let you come and go as you please,
Never once did I ask for anything in return,
Except to have what was coming to me.

You broke a friendship that was based on trust
And tried to pull the wool right over my eyes.
I can't see how such a lying, cheating son of a bitch,
Could have ever been a friend of mine.

[Chorus:]
Are you so blind that you can't see,
Look at what you've done to me.
All of this time I called you my friend,
Now I see your true color showing in the end.

Good times and bad times took a turn for the worst,
Iâm looking back on it now,
Wonder why somehow I could ever hidden all the hurt.
Took something from me that you can't give back,
It was yours just as much it was mine,
But in the end I think you've got what was coming to you,
I got love you got nothing but time.

[Chorus:]
Are you so blind that you can't see,
Look at what you've done to me.
All of this time I called you my friend,
(I keep on give it all, you keep on take it all)
Now I see your true color showing in theâ¦ end.

I keep on give it, you keep on take it
I keep on give it, you keep on take it

I left you to your own devices
And I see trust is just a word you take for granted,
Never had the balls to stand and fight me.
âCause you know that my feet have been firmly planted.
Always had your back we'd find a way out
The two of us could never be kept down.
I never understand the path you've chosen,
I will not back down.

[Chorus:]
Are you so blind that you can't see,
Look at what you've done to me.
All of this time I called you my friend,
(I keep on give it all, you keep on take it all)
Now I see your true color showing in the end.
