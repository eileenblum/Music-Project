East side, west side
Larceny and homicide
People trying to survive.

Prostitution, retribution
Toxic waste and air pollution
Politics: no solution.

[Pre-chorus:]
I've come from the other side of town
This concrete jungle's got me down
I feel the heat, from the street

[Chorus:]
Live in the city,
Die in the city.
Talk is cheap and the air smells shitty.
Laugh in the city,
Cry in the city.
It's my home, sure ain't pretty.

Uptown, downtown
On the streets and underground
People trying to get around.

Skyscrapers, money makers
New York Knicks and L.A. Lakers
One too many circuit breakers.

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus 2x]

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

In the city
In the city
In the city
In the city
Live in the city,
Die in the city.

It's my home, sure ain't pretty.

New York, London, L.A. ( )
D.C., C.D., (Miami)
Stockholm, Istanbul, Glasgow ( )
