(You gotta get out
Keep your feet on the ground.
And you gotta get out, right out, ah-hah)

Listen party people all in the place,
I've been around the world like Puffy and Mace.
Wake up with the moon sleeping with the sun,
This life of style ain't for everyone.

Close your eyes, open up your mind,
I can clearly see you're all so blind.
Everythingâs for sale, name in the price,
The sneakers on my feet are nice.

[Chorus:]
If you're not going up,
Then you gotta get down.
Put your head in the clouds
And feet on the ground.
If you're not coming in,
Then you gotta get out,
Right out, right out, right out.

(Then you gotta get down.
Put your head in the clouds)
If you not going in
Than you gotta be sink)

Keep it on time, always running late,
Even when I'm early hurry up and wait.
Totally sane, fully out of my head,
I'm still alive, I'm the living dead.

Black or white, left or right,
Smokin' and drinkin', night after night.
Top of the world, living on the edge,
You can fall right of the ledge.

[Chorus:]
If you're not going up,
Then you gotta get down.
Put your head in the clouds
And feet on the ground.
If you're not coming in,
Then you gotta get out,
Right out, right out, right out.

Right out, is what I'm talking about.
Right out, is what I'm talking about.
Right out, is what I'm talking about.
Right out, is what I'm talking about. [2x]

Yeahâ¦

Fast forward, future to the past rewind,
A.D. to B.C., nothing but time.
Top to the bottom, front to back,
All 12 sings of the Zodiac.

Asking everybody from east to west,
Y'all wanna know who's style's the best.
Telling all the people in the North and South,
This is what we're talking about.

[Chorus:]
If you're not going up,
Then you gotta get down.
Put your head in the clouds
And feet on the ground.
If you're not coming in,
Then you gotta get out,
Right out, right out, right out.

If you're not going up,
Then you gotta get down.
Put your head in the clouds
And feet on the ground.
If you're not coming in,
Then you gotta get out,
Right out, right out, right out.
Right out, right out!
