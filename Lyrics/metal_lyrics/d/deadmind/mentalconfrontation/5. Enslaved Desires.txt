I can not do what I desire
I feel miserly
Eternal hopes
Grazing my thoughts
Pain of the past is returning
And it poisons the heart
Enslaved desires
Enslaved desires
Your goodness won't help
It will only resurrect the time
Recline the sequence of events
Impossible for my compliance
The pain of enslaved desires
Like a horrid yelp, growing
Like a wretched nightmare
Absorbing my mind
