Factitious theory of happiness
Hidden in the deepest
Parts of mind
Do you see the essence?
Cloaking the gaze
Do you feel the manipulation?
Overwhelming the brain
Wave of dimensions
Which splashes present visions
Playing with future
Of posterior events
Thoughts thorn apart
Ruthless stigmata of death
Do you feel manipulated?
You are part of the jigsaw
You are lost in this mayhem
Don't know what to do
Hiding your rampant thoughts
You are a powerless scum
