When I look at this world
Thinking about further existence
All I want is laugh
Playing with my destiny
Everything is so hollow and elaborate
Nothing is really done to the end
I'm sick off this delusion
And those nasty moments
I'm sick off my shadow
And unseen thoughts
Emptiness of the world
Emptiness of the world
It's the time of nothingness
The world is falling apart
Human actions leads to destruction
No one can stop them
