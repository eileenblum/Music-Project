The time has come
Suppressed by dreams
Slowly growing
Imposing thoughts
Every pain
Every torment
Is coming with time
Passing to infinity
Every murder
Every sorrow
Adds suffering
Cruel silence
Which stays in memory
Adding another desires
Dead mind
Dead mind
Every hit
Every moment
Conquer your dead
And cold mind
Reminding events
Of previous life
Moment of silence surrounds
The past existence
