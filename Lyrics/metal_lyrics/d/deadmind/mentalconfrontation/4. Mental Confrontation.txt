Alone I wonder
And I will bring all sorrows into dust
My countenance I already know
Tragic pain is so quick
When I feel pain
And I hear voices of suffering
When I feel fear
And I see the state of dismay
I think I'm up to
That what will come
When life will set
In unknown moment
When I feel revenge
And I prepare myself
When I feel fear
And I already know what will come
Entity is waiting
Laughing at my face
Promising no matter what
To destroy me
Confrontation
Confrontation
Confrontation
Die!
