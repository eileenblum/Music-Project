Pain stroke suddenly
Destroyed the joy
Beautiful moment
Has vanished once for all
What's the point of this?
Eternal fights and quarrels
Eternal torture of existence
Misery has fallen
Out of the blue
Wonderful time transformed
Into infernal moments
Wading through the pain
I'm dropping my tears
Having endless thoughts
Unable to cope with any of them
Fear, pain, death
Lust, hate, love
Everlasting war of events
Continuously adding new targets
Fear, pain, death
Lust, hate, love
Happiness and joy
Perish in the soreness
Fear, pain, death
Lust, hate, love
Forever gone
In the depths of abyss
Fear, pain, death
Lust, hate, love
