Rise gods of the fierous black burning skies
Raise hammers, spears and swords high on your ride
Along the great legends born of fire and ice
Warriors on horses attack from the mountainous sides

Fires shall flame to the skies, all the battalions stride
Alliances stand line by line, hordes of men armoured to die

Fight warriors of Norse while death glances in your eyes
Swing axes and blades unto the final ride
Attrition holds forces under the great fires
Now heathenous shall be the victors with swords forged by fire

A war cry shall echo the rise, loud from the fierce mountainside
All set their lives on the line to death which is for you all to sign

We're all under the fire, under the great fires
Men of the mountains
We're all, all under the fire, under the great fires
No men of the mountains

We're all under the fire, under the great fires
Men of the mountains
We're all, all under the fire, under the great fires
Men of the mountains

Ride with the wind in your eyes, break through the enemies lines
Dark is the power we rise here under the great fires

Victory stands on this day, bring to all warriors their fate
Ride our enemies down, bring them all to the ground

March under the gods of our fathers unite
March under the flags of the Norse "Oden's eye"

Attrition holds forces under the great fires
All heathenous shall be the victors with swords forged by fire

Fires be flamed to the sky, all the belligerent rise
From the great battle we ride, none left on the fields alive

We're all under the fire, under the great fires
Men of the mountains
We're all, all under the fire, under the great fires
No men of the mountains
