Fiends of the gods, to war we ride
Over the black mountain, far over ice
Fields of war before us, ride by my side
Ride by my side, fire

Warriors of the north, hold your swords high
Ride forth the stallions black, all free under sky
You're all born of legends and blood throughout time
Blood throughout time

All men of iron, cold steel and pride
All men of honour thy courage inside
You're born the legends of fire and ice

Riders of the storm, hail those who died
In the great horizon, blow fire and ice
Fields of war before us, now ride by my side
Ride by my side, fire

All men of iron, cold steel and pride
All men of mountains thy courage inside
You're born the legends of fire and ice
