I rode for the moments once under red sky
Born for the wars fearless inside
I fought for the honor, great kingdoms and ground
Once proud a warrior northborn a son

Gods live on to battle kings live under sigh
Warriors hunger blood with death in the eye
IÂ´ll strive for the moment die by the steel
With vengeance and power IÂ´ll see them kneel

Ride aside for a son of the north
Darkness in his eyes might and armor shine
Ride aside for a son of the north
Darkness in the eyes, heÂ´s a son of the sword

Who heard for the power will head for the sky
And live by the wars dead or alive
I led the warriors held a black sword of steel
A battle ainÂ´t over until victory

Ride aside for a son of the north
Darkness in his eyes might and armor shine
Ride aside for a son of the north
Darkness in the eyes, heÂ´s a son of the sword
