Over the mountains again,
Wandering above the plains
Far up on my mountainside,
Under the fiery lights

I call my world the mountains of fire,
I am watching the flames
I call my world the mountains of fire, of fire and flames (fire and flames)

Upon the mountain I stand,
Horizon sights at my hand
Watching all over the sky
At one with the burning light

I call my world the mountains of fire
I am throning my day
I call my world the mountains of fire
Bound to my fate

I call my world the mountains of fire
I am watching the flames
I call my world the mountains of fire, fire and flames (fire and flames)

Over the mountains
