A Dying Skyline, Cold From Wind And Rain
Autumn Of Darkness In Fire And Flames
North Blows The Wind And My Sight Is Afar
Along The Coming Of The Northern Stars
Fires Burnt Under These Skies
Where Ancient Norsemen Once Brought Us To Pride
A Heathen Force Is To Rise On These Days
The Sun Still Fading Soon Clouds Of Black Rage
It's All Blackened Sky, It's All Blackened Sky
We're Under All Blackened Sky
The Heir Of Gods To Arise
We're Under All Blackened Sky
The Heir Of Our Ancient Pride
