I stand still
The sky, the trees, and the dust quickly skim me 
Itâs dark but itâs daylight 
Neons shut periodical
Eternal shell
Of a knot of seething flows
Today we are drawning to the senses
Yearning larvas disturb my sleep
They lead me to a no return trip
Neons shut periodical while I stand still while I stand still
But I stand still
And yet, I go beyond 
Triviality close to me 
I proceed roused by unreal impulses
I stop if I want 
And I restore my soul
With tepid outcries
I proceed roused by unreal impulses
I stop if I want 
And I restore my soul
Neons shut periodical while I stand still
Then I leave again
Standing still
