Time that beheads the leaves goes further towards
The other end of earth nocturnal arrows implore
The joyful day leave the bitter taste of silence and face the storm
Fight in defence of your secret hours
An obscure metalsâ ring encircles your lonely street
The rain is eternal friend of your face 
Smile in the circus of the infinite curtain 
Where shadows break up at the rhythm of timbals 
At dusk the horizon grows up
Lively with dancing pale figures
Their heart is tattooed with essences and fragrances
Everything consumes and falls down 
Wrapped by ruins wearing mourning 
Itâs up to you to surprise your destiny
To mock the funereal by breathing the ecstasy of the cobalt blue dust
To let your plasma beat with divine and incredible force
To be
