Worrying desire of transcending sayings
Terrible sensation of desertion
Vulgar anger impulses
My mental state my actual state
Absorbed by vitreous glassy liquid of my arbitrary starvation 
Moments spent in understanding the game 
In another context I would have taken possession
I would have elected my new path
Making my strings vibrate shouting to time, crying inside
I canât I donât have to I donât want to
I see my old vision vanishing like the breath passing through my harm
I tighten it, I fill it with my condition
Iâm unarmed before events
Foolish miniatures, temporary alternations 
Dilemmas the game is keeping for me 
Iniquitous joy, flavor disappearing from emotions 
Slow, relentless, clever
It insinuates itself carrying myriads of sounds
Ephemeral event in contact with the extreme side of me 
I donât like it I donât want it 
Intellect doesnât help me 
The courage I lead is unexpressed 
Flooded in my mind 
Bridled in my heart
I would like to listen to new sounds
To be stripped from my mental iterations 
Already ragged behavior structures 
Protecting a shield erected by myself
That has no reason to exist
