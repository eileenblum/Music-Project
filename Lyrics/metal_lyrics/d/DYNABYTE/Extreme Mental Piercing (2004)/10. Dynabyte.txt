Overcharged by sensations 
Overloaded by propulsion
Survive to your daily madness
Overcome by emotions 
Overlaid by impulsion 
Survive to your daily madness
Itâs time for Dynabyte 
Destroy your mental poise
Today you take your choice
Eliminate the cultural rule
Today youâve nothing to lose
Restore your psychoneurosis
Tomorrow erase your psychosis
Adapt your mind to passivity 
Youâre welcome to the fear factory
