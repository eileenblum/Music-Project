I belong to an era where he who meditates is forced to weaken his time 
Where he who sticks to ancient promises sinks and brings with him 
His essences, his odors and his humble intentions 
Iâm gripped in my desire, Iâm stopped by my hindrance 
Iâm looking for vital space but I implode
Oppressed by my moral load I stay in a place
I belong to a time, I struggle against
An ethics that doesnât appertain to me.
I oppose, but I see my enemy darkened 
My accomplice patiently waiting for lightâs arrival
I fill myself with internal force, studying the winning strategy
It has come, I bracket it
Heâs strange, I see him
I observe him, I feel him 
He goes ahead and tales possession of his features
I feel him, I see him
Oddly known, painfully known 
Tragically identical.
I implode while Iâm blocking my blood
The bitter accomplice takes me back, I cannot bar
I cannot refute it before having understood
Why I must live to fight my uncompromising instinct 
I belong to an era where the enemy is not always out of me.
