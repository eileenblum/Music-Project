Dull, bulgy and deformed structure without brace 
Small tumultuous cosmos with no control and sensations 
Confused in chaos and in damp colors
It rotates around 
It rotates on axels transfixing it 
Forcing it to new alterations 
It is unstable and harmful
It carries unhealthy hopes
Old sorrows could
Surface again
Awakening never soothed rages
Cautiously taken from fire
Burning inside
Electrical impulses set its throb 
It commands, judges, dominates
It forces you to follow it
To darkness or to light 
It doesnât care about you
Rebel yourself to it
Nothing changes, he wins, you lose
Arrest yourself, listen to it 
Follow it softly
Nothing is different, it always plays
It doesnât care about you
Itâs always part of you
It involves every part of you
It receives you into its hostile womb
It deceives you, asking new questions 
Building doubts and hindrances 
You are not able to defend from 
Forced to stay with it all life long 
You donât realize you are the material impediment 
And when it leaves your journey
Youâll be forced to follow it again
