When everything seems to drive me far away
When everyone claim to straighten my mind 
I keep my thought in the unconsciousâ depths 
From where a day everything will rise as mist
The fog is hiding my weak and confused will
I cannot feel the surrounding bafflement 
I canât apprehend whatâs happening in my mind 
Iâm not only sure everything will rise as mist
Iâll rise like fog
Which pierce your fate 
I will be wilder
