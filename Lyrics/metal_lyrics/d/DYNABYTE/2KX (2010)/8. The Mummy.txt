Bandage after bandage, patch after patch
Ointment after ointment, turn after turn
I find myself wrapped by the tight coils
They have prepared me. They emptied me out.
They removed my chewy parts, dipped in perfumed oils
Prepared for my mummification.
But all this for what?
To preserve a body that will last forever.
They built an appropriate place, an entire sarcophagus built for me
Built by me
Yes, I realize I have been involved in my destiny
Caught in the crib, they subdued me
Wrapped in the bandages, now they are laying me to rest
In the sour sepulchre
Sentenced to tremble forever
Wrapped in the bandages, now they are laying me to rest
Sentenced to tremble forever.
They removed my chewy parts, dipped in perfumed oils
Prepared for my mummification.
But all this for what?
In the sour sepulchre
Sentenced to tremble forever
Wrapped in the bandages, now they are laying me to rest
Sentenced to tremble forever.
In coldness, in darkness.
