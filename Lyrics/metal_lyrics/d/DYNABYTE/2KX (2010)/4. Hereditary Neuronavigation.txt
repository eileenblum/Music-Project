You are there on your wooden throne and you smile
Sometimes I cross your mindâ¦
Master of my cognitive process
Imprint between delirium and reality, between brightness and folly
Sometimes you cross my mind.
Necessary dilatation of consciousness mixed with corporal hallucination
Core of anguish, cradle of irony and unorthodoxy
Sometimes you cross my mind
And you smile...
Sometimes I cross your mind
And you smile...
Usually I donât dream of you,
Usually I donât think about you
But sometimes you cross my mind and you smile.
Unfathomable thought mother of all illusions
You had captured me before your definite silence.
Unfathomable thought mother of all illusions
I navigated through your soul before your definite silence.
Necessary dilatation of consciousness mixed with corporal hallucination
Core of anguish, cradle of irony and unorthodoxy.
