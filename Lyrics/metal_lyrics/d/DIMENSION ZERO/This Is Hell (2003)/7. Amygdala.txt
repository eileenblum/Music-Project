Shut the fuck up
It's time to back up
To reflect on the grey times
To make sure its in balance

Suck my mind dry
Make my pores cry
Lets make out in the fire
Feed me up like the liar

IS IT OPENED? IS IT CLOSED
DRIVES ME CRAZY, KEEPS ME SANE?

Crack me open
Colour my darkness
I'm alive if you say so
I will fall, I'm your undertow

It's the loss of my failure
Can't depend on a prayer
When you crush me like a freight train
I'm a survivor and I'll regain
