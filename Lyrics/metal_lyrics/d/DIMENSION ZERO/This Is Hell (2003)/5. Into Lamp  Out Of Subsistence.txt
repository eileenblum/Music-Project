This first verse is for you
Humble servants of time
If my being would be so true
What is my role, what is my crime?

This second verse isn't real
So is not I, neither you
Why do I think, why do I feel?
If you cant say that this is true?

I AM THE SKY
NO MORE NO MORE
I CANT DENY
SO LOW SO LOW

This last verse is for me
I'm cracking down, I'm lost, I'm drowned
I don't really want to see
Until I'm gone and by dirt is crowned

Longing, with fear and time nailed to my spine
I'm not, allowed to choose the speed of light
