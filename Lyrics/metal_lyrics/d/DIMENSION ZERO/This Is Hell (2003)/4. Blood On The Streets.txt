Tearing up the veins in the blood on the streets
Blocking out the people in the blood on the streets
Humankind is enough to get inverted from today
When you stand there choking on hollow air

Cold in a crowd in the blood on the streets
Fading out screaming in the blood on the streets
Inside the asphyxiation there's a fire glowing
Burning me straight, keeping me cold

ALMOST COVERED UP NOW
THE HORROR, THE HORROR
LENDS ME THE INFECTION
THE DROWNING, THE DROWNING

Floating towards in the idiot masses
Something's missing at the heart of consciousness
Not completely healed, bleeding still
I'm not exhaling in the blood on the streets

Living through the eyes of a shell
Leading pass the skies back to hell
