I wont turn around
I'm killing my sleep
Like a bird courageous
I burn my wings

Days turn into eternal night
Life is catching up from behind

Weakened surroundings
No walls to embrace
Distant mumbling
Not able to speak
Carving in concrete
Raging in silence
Floating in fever
I'm killing my sleep

Days turn into eternal night
Life is catching up from behind

KILLING KILLING KILLING
KILLING MY SLEEP
FALLING FALLING FALLING
FALLING TOO DEEP

Days turn into eternal night
Life is catching up from behind

Seems like forever, since I opened my eyes
Feels like an eternity, to close them shut
I've lost my shelter, cant dream no more
I wont back down now
I'm killing my sleep
