Out here there are no stars
No heroes to be sung
This infinity has no smell
This heaven has no hell

THAT'S WHAT WE ARE- IMMACULATE
GOD IS REACHING OUT FOR YOU- IMMACULATE

Riding fast without the speed
Sleeping deep beneath the sky
Caring proudly for the shield
You cant touch my being dressed in white

Were only waiting for tomorrow
Without the sins and all the sorrow

Flawless until you crave the truth
Guarding pride with skills of lying

With the souls of anger made
If you point the blade will fall
