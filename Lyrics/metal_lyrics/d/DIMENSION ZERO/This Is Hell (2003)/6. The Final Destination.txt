The music is playing and I don't mind
I seem to speak but no one can hear me

In sadness and all the madness
Now I lay me down to sleep

I open my eyes and look upon the darkness
The gathering is here and so am I

THE FINAL DESTINATION
MY EYES ARE BURNING
THE FINAL DESTINATION

Hear me now and I shall speak unto thee
What you've sown is now bleeding in me

Here you are now in my calm solitude
What is your number? Can you claim that you are here?

The hours are passing like the wind in the air
Breathing softly through this heartless despair

In sadness and all the madness
Now I lay me down to sleep
Smell the silence, feel the grief falling through
Now I lay me down to sleep
Hear me now because they are coming for you
Now I lay me down to sleep
