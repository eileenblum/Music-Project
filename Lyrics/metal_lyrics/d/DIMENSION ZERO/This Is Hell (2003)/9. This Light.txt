A walk in the moonlight
A stroll through the twilight
In the land of the deeper senses
A journey without a solid ground

In the breath of lasting
To float upon the chaos
A grief within the hollow
A path for me to follow

A sight that I once saw
Tonight we all come clean

Tonight we leave this world
For journeys painted red

When black turns out white
When the day is night for real
I saw what this is like
I cant seem to face this life

THIS LIGHT
MY FLIGHT
MY DAYS WITH THE DARKNESS BRIGHT
