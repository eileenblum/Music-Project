I'm in the place where nothing is alive
Nothing is certain and nothing is seen
To fall upon you is no pleasant choice
I've lost my sight, I've lost my voice

Nothing, nowhere, endless
Hollow, airless, shameless

Come along and seize thy demons
If you know what you are made of
Enter silence, hear it swallow
Inside these realms your soul is hollow

SILENT DARKNESS, ETERNAL PAIN
TIME IS STANDING STILL
SILENT DARKNESS, ETERNAL PAIN
TIME IS STANDING STILL

Falling through, I hear it crawling
Existence is letting you go now
Endless darkness you're my hero
We are one, we are zero
