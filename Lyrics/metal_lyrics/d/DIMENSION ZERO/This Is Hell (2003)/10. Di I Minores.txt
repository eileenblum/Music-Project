No more shall we speak
No more shall we part
United in a lower kingdom
Created for a useless reason

We are lower
Than you ever can believe
We are stronger
Than you ever will experience

TIME TRAVELS FAST
SOMETIMES ITS SLOW
THE LONGER YOU LAST
THE DEEPER YOU GO

There is a cage
Filled up with rage
There is a flu
Waiting for you

Premonition is a loss and for you denied

In another world
And a different stage
I'll be the sky
Looking down on you
