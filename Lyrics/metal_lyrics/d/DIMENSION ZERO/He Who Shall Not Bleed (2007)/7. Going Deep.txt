Present, I am invincible
Nothing passes through
To e above all that you're fearing
Is the least that you are bearing

Instant falling
Insert repeating
Going deeper
Out to get me
(So you're out to get me are you?)

Two steps to the left
Could be the inches last
To be left on the other side
Looking back through the glass

Can you hold me back? - Save me
Am I left to crack? - Release me

In the eyes oft he strong man
You're not refused to faults
Because behind the common lies
Lies the trail where you are going deep
