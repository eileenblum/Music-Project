That Is I
This is what you feed
For I am he who shall not bleed

You should be writing this to me
I'm always just the same as you
It's not the worm for who I bleed
In sickness turning, what I need

Take a look upon the surface
Have a peak at what is born
You're all just the same as me
You're all that I don't wanna be

Twisting, aching in the flood

A glimpse of tearing, what's inside
A shadow world I can collide
You're alive and so am I
I can not breathe, I fear to try
