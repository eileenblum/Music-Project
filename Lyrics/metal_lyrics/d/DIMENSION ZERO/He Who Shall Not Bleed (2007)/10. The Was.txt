The was is pure and newly sown
It keeps on growing the things you thought you knew

The moon is in the eye oft he strangers mind
Collective thoughts that drives us blind
Forget the higher ground that you used to walk upon
It's nothing more than a pale old disbelief

Into the light
Into the white
The was is whipping out your life
From the past
From the dark
The was is whipping out your life

It does not weaken as the mind seem to forget
The was is all coming back out of proportion
