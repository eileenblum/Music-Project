Presence fading
Slowly increasing
Lights switching
My sky is nothing

Ever-changing
Clean and tasteless
Closely waiting
Man-made mania

Nothing ever is
Nothing ever
Ever
IS
Nothing ever is

Gently walking
Termites terrain
Straying marked
For mastery unknown

Branded inside
Nameless multitude
Dark and hollow
I'm on stand-by
