There's an utmost stir blocking my inside out
A fall which do not have a place to land
Where can this clear get it's feeding through

It's eating me out from the outside in, you

Way to shine
Shining way to bright
Way to shine
Staring right through me
Right through me
A feel from yesterdays test completes my fire
Say you're sorry and fade to black
It lights it up, as my sight grows pale

A darkness in the light which cant be true, you

With eyes closed the reflection feels
What's floating in the shadows deep
