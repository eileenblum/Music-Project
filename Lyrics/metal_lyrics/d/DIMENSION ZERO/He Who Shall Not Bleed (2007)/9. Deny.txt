I've been waking up in oceans
Drying myself blindfolded
Breathing the sinners air
Laughing in the face of being

Am I really leaving?

They say that my departure
I denied by myself

I've been sleeping deep in snow
Lonesome at the bottom
Alone at the mountain top
Staring slowly at the world

I've been dying for some time now
Can't you feel it breathing?
It's lovely on the ground
Lovely as it sleeps
