I am on a spree counting back wards
I'll be shooting angels in heaven
When I'm only on my knees I'll be bleeding
When I'm catching fire I'll be laughing

Getting closer
Fire's breathing
Stains of black burst
Your one desire

Gone too far away
Loading minds astray
The fury is deranged
Something's dragging me

Wearing out my fingers on the walls now
Tearing out the sorrow in reverse now
Come watch the hollow in my eyes now
Winning is for others, not for me now
