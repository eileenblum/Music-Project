As we gathered the filth and covered ourselves in fear
The angels started trembling and the earth moved
We stood there alone in the horrors that devoured our senses
I can hear the dark, can you?

Every other word seems to me by
My face is twitching, still nothing

Am I loosing it?
Has time passed yet?

Did you close your eyes before you left?
Did you get a closer look upon it all?
Should I kill an see
A different death, another life?

I can hear the dark
Can you?
I can face the light
Did you?

So calm, so still
So clean, so dark
