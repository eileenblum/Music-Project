The longing spreads its solemn wings
I flew beyond the realms of light
To bury deep my hellish self
To cleanse my stains and reap the soul

Fearless - No one is pure
Timeless _ I've got no cure

I'm closer to heaven
I close my eyes
Hell is within

I heal my cuts an hide my anguish
Crawling through the precious night
This is where I must belong
This is it, prove me wrong

In silence dark the hours haunt
Reveals this anger from above
Fear not, is what is said
Time wont heal, it will just stop
