As I trembled
The walls came down in fear
Hello misery
Your company is here

And the temptation starts
To bleed my empty heart

As I froze
I all came out hollow
Greeting fire
Are you the one to follow?

Drained and useless
As I came for you
Unto others
Come be my shadow

Feed upon me
Until I'm vanquished
Demon caller
Breathing down my throat
