A dead silent shriek echoed through the sky
darkness spread through the ruin ground
the earth-surface cracked with a painful growl
the disciples of each master stared
never had they seen them, just felt
Power to power
the only solution is the end

Armageddon is drawing nearer
the only one to be left is me
the powers slowly attack
deactivating each others souls

Confronting their non-equals
the sight you have never seen
in a place you have never been
released upon the earth with a dead silent shriek

Confronting their non-equals
the sight you have never seen
in a place you have never been
released upon the earth with a dead silent shriek

Dead I move to eternity
to decide the beginning
the titans are in war
destroying their existance
in a clash so undescribable

Confronting their non-equals
the sight you have never seen
in a place you have never been
released upon the earth with a dead silent shriek
