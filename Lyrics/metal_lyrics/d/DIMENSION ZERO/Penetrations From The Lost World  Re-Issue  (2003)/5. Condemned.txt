The inside is cold from the wound
When did you arrive cold-hearted?
Why do you long for my mortality?
Your eyes have seen me before

I'll burn for you, I'll ache for you, I'll die for you
But I wont follow

CONDEMNED FROM THE START
MY LIFE FALLS APART
THE CREATION OF ME
IS A FLOATING DEBRIS

I've felt you staring from behind
These eyes sprout up and drove me blind
Stagnation killed my raging horrors
Black dreams in colour woke my sorrows

My eyelids are beyond sleeping
Can I have just one more truth?
Is this the life that I once knew?
Or is this the life I never had?
