I saw it moving in the darkened sky
the gods arriving through the clouds
Forgotten but not forgiven
remembering all their outrage
I'll not forget when I am dead

They struck the ground I stood on
took away every soul
undressed my mind and destroyed my shadow
I am doomed to walk towards the end

Forgotten but not forgiven
remembering all their outrage
I'll not forget when I am dead
I'll not forgive when I arise
I'll not forget when I am dead

In a state of mind
that can not be felt
it can not be seen
it's like an unconscious terror
a few got out
out of the frames
but the rest were burnt in flames

In a state of mind
that can not be felt
it can not be seen
it's like an unconscious terror
Eye to eye with a lost soul
armed with the past powers
all is real, the old forces they feel
dead-silent moving through my limbs
ice cold stain and eyes met my face
this is the fear in this thrilling maze
