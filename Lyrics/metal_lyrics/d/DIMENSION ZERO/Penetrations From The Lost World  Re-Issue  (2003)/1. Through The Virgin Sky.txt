Their eyes are opened
slowly they are starting to breathe
the sky is growling in wrath
thunder and lightning is released
aware of each others powers
a feeling of battle appears
facing heaven in anger
a carnage is soon to await
Through the virgin sky
raping the surface
penetrating earth
powers from the lost world
Total fucking chaos
the ancient meets today
erased is the hope
sudden death to come

Through the virgin sky
raping the surface
penetrating earth
powers from the lost world

Visions from the past
marching into war
unleashed upon the earth
killing all that breathes

Through the virgin sky
raping the surface
penetrating earth
powers from the lost world

Their eyes are opened
slowly they are starting to breathe
the sky is growling in wrath
thunder and lightning is released
aware of each others powers
a feeling of battle appears
facing heaven in anger
a carnage is soon to await
