Paint the endless voices
Make the earth fade
Slowly my pain is deranged
Into shameless vast suffering

Perpetual motion is in session
Silent screams defies discretion
Slow silence cannot break me
Slow silence cannot make me

Figures without faces
Sudden movements with no traces
The air is shattered into darkness
The void inside is shrinking

Doomed to cleanse, made to suffer
Moving doors awaits my demons
The anguish held my cravings

Slow silence cannot break me
Slow silence cannot make me
