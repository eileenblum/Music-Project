I'm not going to need your god
when the hours have run out
can't demand heavenly salvation
crying out my pain on holy time

These nails are really shining,
heaven will you save me now?

I can feel you're weakening now
this shadow is for you to hold
let it breathe into your soul
let it rest as you grow cold

ITS AN END, THE END FOR ME
ITS AN END, THE END FOR ME
WOULD YOU LIKE TO REALLY SEE
THESE THORNS ARE NOT HEAVEN SENT
START.LIFE.END
START.LIFE.END

Rest upon your golden wings
behold the torture that the demons bring
swallowed to the body of mankind
feat by feat, pain divine

These nails are really shining,
heaven will you save me now?
