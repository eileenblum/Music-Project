There is nowhere left to go, tomorrow never gets here
to this abandoned ground, where I can sleep within

Now the air is dark, now the coldness breathes
now you see the sign, now you see it reign

when this fire starts to weaken out your soul
the tender bows of innocence is the first to burn
the cold and empty winds will rise and all the goodness is in fear

WALK WITH ME TO PAIN &amp; SUFFOCATION
WALK THROUGH ME WITH ANGER &amp; FRUSTRATION
WALK AROUND ME WITH THE FEAR &amp; ACHE
CAN YOU FEEL IT? ARE YOU READY TO BREAK?

When the seed is sown, you're about to see
that the evil that you fed, is nothing else but me
you will beg to be, a soulless evil being
do you know my name? do you feel the shame?

there is nowhere left to hide and the only way is to ride
upon the crucial tide, you're stuck with me until you die

There is no where left to go, tomorrow never gets here
to this abandoned ground, where I can sleep within
