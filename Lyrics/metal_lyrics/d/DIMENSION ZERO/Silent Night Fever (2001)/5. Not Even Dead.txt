In this maze where can I sleep, I've seen the light and then again
Journey after journey hatred followed, unleashed upon the final ride

Release me from these god forsaken claws, please let me die

These walls have known me before, they're creeping up on me
With the firmest grip of senses, I freeze eternally

Release me from these god forsaken claws, please let me die

I CAN'T FEEL MY BONES, THE BLOOD HAS ALL DRIED UP
I AM CAUGHT IN-BETWEEN
I CAN'T FEEL MY BONES, THE BLOOD HAS ALL DRIED UP
I?M NOT EVEN DEAD

Torture is hiding me from them, silence is grasping for my mind
The paths and stones are desolate now, is this where I can finally rest

Release me from these god forsaken claws, please let me die

I CAN'T FEEL MY BONES, THE BLOOD HAS ALL DRIED UP
I AM CAUGHT IN-BETWEEN
I CAN'T FEEL MY BONES, THE BLOOD HAS ALL DRIED UP
I'M NOT EVEN DEAD

Silence is grasping for my mind
