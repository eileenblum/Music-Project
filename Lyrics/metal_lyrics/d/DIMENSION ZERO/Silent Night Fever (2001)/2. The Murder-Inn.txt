Someone's dug a hole in the ground
pity the victims lost not found
the self-proclaimed bows to the cross
the goodness gain is the deserters loss

FOLLOW ME TO THE MURDER-INN
COME LET'S KILL, SIN AFTER SIN

There is nothing to fear, follow the words
we will tear you down in blackened thirds
fill up the holes dug in the ground
blood is blind first time around

FOLLOW ME TO THE MURDER-INN
COME LET'S KILL, SIN AFTER SIN

leave my demons alone, let them sleep
sad to see that you're in too deep
madness resting in pure salvation
murder's cleansing this holy nation

FOLLOW ME TO THE MURDER-INN
COME LET'S KILL, SIN AFTER SIN

In the name of my fucking god
I will take your life

FOLLOW ME TO THE MURDER-INN
COME LET'S KILL, SIN AFTER SIN
