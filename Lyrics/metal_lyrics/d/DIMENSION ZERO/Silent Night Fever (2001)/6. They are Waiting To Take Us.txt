Awake, the whole world hates me
Awake, the whole world denies me
Morning captures me totally unaware
I'm off the edge today, am I not
I'm off the world today, am I not
Night grabs me totally aware

No one has brought me here
I have not been gone so long
No one will take me there, I haven't got no choice
Who's digging the ground in the depths
Who's digging my holes to be

Morning, alright is it not
Night for the living, am I here
In between where can it be now
What do you get from this light
All time, no where, anywhere, no
Who are you really, where do you hide

BEHOLD, I AM ALIVE ETERNALLY
THEY ARE WAITING TO TAKE US
TAKE US INTO THE GARDEN OF DEPTHS
BEHOLD, I AM DEAD FOREVER

why?

BEHOLD, I AM ALIVE ETERNALLY
THEY ARE WAITING TO TAKE US
TAKE US INTO THE GARDEN OF DEPTHS
BEHOLD, I AM DEAD FOREVER

THEY ARE WAITING TO TAKE US!
