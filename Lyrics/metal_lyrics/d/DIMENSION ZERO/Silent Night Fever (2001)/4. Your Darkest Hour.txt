Forever sombre is the heart of every evening swallowed
In ruins are the pieces that you laid in hallowed harmony
These veins are filled with ice which sleeps within the hollow
Your darkness is not waiting, it has already arrived

Coming down slow
Feel the inevitable against your skin
Let it in

Like a wound which is not healing it is eating your mind
The air is thick around your safe &amp; dying presence
You do not want to see the days that lies ahead of you
Are you afraid to feel the blackness that your future is?

THIS IS YOUR DARKEST HOUR
YOUR SOUL IT WILL DEVOUR
REACH OUT &amp; TOUCH YOUR BEING
YOUR LIFE SHALL NOT RETURN
