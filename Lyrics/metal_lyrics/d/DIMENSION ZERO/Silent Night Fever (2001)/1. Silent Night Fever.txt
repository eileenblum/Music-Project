Written words that fell from grace
unmasked to show its solemn face
thrills is born beneath our skies
fear is shown where evil lies

In my deep eternal darkness
I'm reaching for the edge
cant hold on much longer
I shed my final tears

SILENT - Is the air I breathe
NIGHT - Has now been feeding me
FEVER - Has been brought to you
SILENT NIGHT FEVER - MADNESS IS MY BELIEVER

Shadows reap these dirty walls
the demons laugh as his consciousness falls
they feast upon the grey and cold
unleashes the unleashable, now your story is told

In my deep eternal darkness
I'm reaching for the edge
cant hold on much longer
I shed my final tears
madness is my believer

MY BELIEVER
