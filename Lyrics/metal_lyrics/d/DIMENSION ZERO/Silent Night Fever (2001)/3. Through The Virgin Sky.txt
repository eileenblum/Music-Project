The end!

Their eyes are opened, slowly they're starting to breathe
The sky is growling in wrath, thunder and lightning is released
Aware of eachothers powers, a feeling of battle appears
Facing the heavens in anger, a carnage is soon to await

THROUGH THE VIRGIN SKY
RAPING THE SURFACE
PENETRATING EARTH
POWERS FROM THE LOST WORLD

Total fucking chaos, the ancient rises again
Erased is the hope, sudden death to come

THROUGH THE VIRGIN SKY
RAPING THE SURFACE
PENETRATING EARTH
POWERS FROM THE LOST WORLD

Visions from the past
Marching into war
Unleashed upon the earth
Killing all that breathes

THROUGH THE VIRGIN SKY
RAPING THE SURFACE
PENETRATING EARTH
POWERS FROM THE LOST WORLD

Their eyes are opened, slowly they're starting to breathe
The sky is growling in wrath, thunder and lightning is released
Aware of eachothers powers, a feeling of battle appears
Facing heaven in anger, a carnage is soon to await
