In this world full of winded corridors
cities like maces, towers like thorns
I'm not my master, not at all
cursed thoughts lead me to my fall
Broken thoughts
broken dreams
broken hearts
this realm of darkness, 
is this my reward?
Darkness is falling, over my mind
my burning eyes are, deadly blind
now there's nothing like it seem
all illusions, only dreams
