Let me go, to this world
See my pain, sacrificed
Flee my row, in unease
Filth no gain, is my doom

In the warm dusk, birth of life's spark
Thrown in this world of greed
The essence flask, sense stays in dark
Decay of seed

In a mace of colder fears
Dogmatic Coercions unleashed
Pathway of the crowned beast
The heavens weep

Let me go, to this world
See my pain, sacrificed
Flee my row, in unease
Filth no gain, is my doom

The chain is broken, a creature is freed
All the bonds are concealed
It's hopes taken, freedom is agreed
Fate is revealed

In a mace of colder fears
Dogmatic Coercions unleashed
Pathway of the crowned beast
The heavens weep

Let me go, to this world
See my pain, sacrificed
Flee my row, in unease
Filth no gain, is my doom
