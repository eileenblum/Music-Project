In the Shadow of a second, a cruel fate
An everlasting bond, the times blade
In the Shadow of a second, a cruel fate
An everlasting bond, the times blade
A word falls, agony spreads, future is still born
Apocalyptic sins, end of the crown of thron

Was a place of joy, a place of war
Mankind's toy, fear this time
Was a place of love, a place of fear
Life above, decay of mine

Deliverance refused, prophecies vanished
The everlasting bond, finally is perished
Deliverance refused, prophecies vanished
An everlasting lie, devotees are perished
The book crushed, agony reigns, the era is worn
The riders balefulness, end of the crown of thron

Was a place of joy, a place of war
Mankind's toy, fear this time
Was a place of love, a place of fear
Life above, decay of mine
