in the beauty of your eyes
unblanked your deceit lurks
the point were my mercy dies
I'm sure my spell it works

curse, curse, cursed you are
if it's jealousy, I don't care
curse, curse, cursed you are
are you suffering? I don't care
curse, curse, cursed you are
I execrate you, I swear
curse, curse, cursed you are
no love left you can share

Your emotions I desecrate
I bring you to your lunacy 
perdition will be your fate
I leave you in agony

curse, curse, cursed you are
if it's jealousy, I don't care
curse, curse, cursed you are
are you suffering? I don't care
curse, curse, cursed you are
I execrate you, I swear
curse, curse, cursed you are
no love left you can share
