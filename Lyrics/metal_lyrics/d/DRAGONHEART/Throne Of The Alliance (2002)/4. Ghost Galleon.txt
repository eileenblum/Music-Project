[Lead vocals: Eduardo Marques]

The Legend tells about this sea
Thousands of squadrons destroyed in the mist
All the Black Hawks are waiting the strike,
When a ship arises, ready for the fight

Evil pirates [4 times]

Cannons bright in the flames
In the Devil's Throat,
Storm of blades
The force of Alliance is down
The Generals attack for the proud of the crown

Evil pirates [4 times]

The eyes of the Holy Ghosts, hunting in the sea
Searching for blood and fire
Dragon Heart is coming beside winds and rain
With the sword of storms the power of the Hurricane

Ghost Galleon
Screams of Revenge
Ghost Galleon
Spectrums of Rage

Ghost skulls in the dark
Killing the crew, with the magic steel
Vision of hell in the earth
Lost crusade, the ocean is the grave

Evil pirates [4 times]

Your honor is the key, Dragon Heart
We'll lead your army
'Til the coast apart
Keep your journey with proud
Beware with the storm
And you'll never fall

Evil pirates [4 times]

The eyes of the Ghosts, hunting in the sea
Searching for blood and fire
Dragon Heart is coming beside winds and rain
With the sword of storms the power of Hurricane

Ghost Galleon
Screams of Revenge
Ghost Galleon
Spectrums of Rage

First Voice - Power of the thunder, power of the night
Sailing in the ocean in the ghost galleon
Second Voice - We found our way in the Ghost Galleon,
Fighting across the midnight sea
Third Voice - We don't gonna be destroyed
We will fight for freedom

[Solo (Marco Caporasso)]

The eyes of the Ghosts, hunting in the sea
Searching for blood and fire
Dragon Heart is coming beside winds and rain
With the sword of storms the power of Hurricane

Ghost Galleon
Screams of Revenge
Ghost Galleon
Spectrums of Rage
