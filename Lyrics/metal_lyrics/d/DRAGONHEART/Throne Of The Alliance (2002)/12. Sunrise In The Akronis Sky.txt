[Lead vocals: Eduardo Marques]

Many dangers and mysteries
The trooper is under fire
Brave warriors rest in peace
Bless us from the sky

Adventures we can see
Changing our destiny
Rising force
Come with me
Glories and Pride

Dragons and Kings
And my magic swords
Creatures and Plagues
We've destroyed
Listen to the wind
Heroes of the realm
Keep the magical ring

Sunrise in the Akronis Sky
Over the Mountains
The Dragon Survives

I need your help
And your blade
Great Akronis Kingdom
Join us my friends
In our crusades
Staying by my side

We'll return to expel
The creatures and the evil
March warriors
Fight for freedom
Write the tale tonight

Dragons and Kings
And my magic swords
Creatures and Plagues
We've destroyed
Listen to the wind
Heroes of the realm
Keep the magical ring

Sunrise in the Akronis Sky
Over the Mountains
The Dragon Survives

[Solo (Marco Caporasso)]

We can't see where the rain comes
We are so far from the rainbow
Come great leader
Take your throne
The Kingdom of the Alliance
Conclame your return
