[Lead vocals: Eduardo Marques]

In a long time ago
Claymored and Fhalkior united
By the anger of their Kings
They had to survive

All the shine of the glory
Was built with the might of steel
This eternal winter
Will not rise
Alliance is the name on our shields
I look at the sky,
On crowd dead on the field
This eternal winter
Will not rise
The legions will sing this hymn

United for a single Nation
United for a single Kingdom

We'll fight together
We can't stand-alone
We're going to fight
Again for the crown
Two kingdoms,
One leader, one throne

Searching for help
Far from home
The Legacy will not fall
For the proud of our king
Face to face the army of Trolls

All the shine of the glory
Was built with the might of steel
This eternal winter
Will not rise
Alliance is the name on our shields
I look at the sky,
On crowd dead on the field
This eternal winter
Will not rise
The legions will sing this hymn

United for a single Nation
United for a single Kingdom

We'll fight together
We can't stand-alone
We're going to fight
Again for the crown
Two kingdoms,
One leader, one throne

[Solo (Marco Caporasso)]

United for a single Nation
United for a single Kingdom

We'll fight together
We can't stand-alone
We're going to fight
Again for the crown
Two kingdoms,
One leader, one throne
