[Lead vocals: Eduardo Marques]

Traitor
You had no reasons to tell anyone
Liar
Risking the fate of the throne
Judas
Selling the lives of your brothers in arms
Betrayer
Destroying the plans of the Crown

Sons of Claymored
Sons of Fhalkior

Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
This journey has no return
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
We will never break the oath

Bring him to me
I want to know
Why did he tell?
Before we go

Traitor
In the Greyhawk tavern he lost his mind
Liar
His greed will change our lives
Judas
Now we'll have to prepare our armies
Betrayer
We are not afraid to die

Sons of Claymored
Sons of Fhalkior

Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
This journey has no return
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
We will never break the oath

So came the moment
About Fellstrought
Our time is out
We have to go

[Solo (Eduardo Marques)]

Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
This journey has no return
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
We will never break the oath

Forgive me my king
Tell me your sin
I've failed with my faith
Join us in this crusade
