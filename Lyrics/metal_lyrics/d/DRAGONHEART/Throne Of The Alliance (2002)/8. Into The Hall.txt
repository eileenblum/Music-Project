[General Dragonheart] - "Oar God, I invoke you to the noblest of all godsend, I need your help! You owe me!!!"

[terrifying voice from the clouds] - "So you came (...) I never thought I would see you here invoking the life of another mortal. But due to your braveness facing the battle against the four brothers guardians of the Saint Trinity's Heart who are corrupted by the power of the magic black side. I will give you this gift. But remember this is your only chance. Not you and not even anyone will ever invoke me again. Not even for your own life or for any other mortal life never again (...) Never again."
