Inside of this hall
Secrets and dangers behind the walls
Lighting the dark room
The warriors' spirit hail the Crown

Hall of dead knights
Twilight of your dreams hiding my sins
Hall of dead knights
Bringing the hymn to our army believe

Devastation of the horizons
From the old graves from the ancient ages
Bringing the life to our king to our journey begin

The death burying the death
Into secret chamber
The death burying the death
Into secret chamber

Brave souls of the hall
The resurrection of the king
Don't let us fall...
Brave souls of the hall
The resurrection of the king
Don't let us fall...

Remember my friend
The souls don't turn back
This is the last chance
With the magic power brake the Death

Hall of dead knights
Beyond your dreams carrying the hymns
Hall of dead knights
Storm of the Spells in the wind

Don't go against the lifetime
You can't win the power of the gods
But if you trust in your heart
Just try if you want

[Solo (Marco Caporasso)]

The death burying the death
Into secret chamber
The death burying the death
Into secret chamber

Brave souls of the hall
You brought back our king
We won't give up
Brave souls of the hall
You brought back our king
We won't give up
Don't let us fall...
