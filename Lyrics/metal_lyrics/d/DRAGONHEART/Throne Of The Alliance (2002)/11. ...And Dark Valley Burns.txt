[Lead vocals: Mauricio Taborda]

Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel...

They came from everywhere
Marching down on the hill
Kill, kill pay the price
It's time for sacrifice

Archers and cavalry
Screams of Agony
Fight, Fight spirits of knights
Let set us free

...And the Dark Valley burns

Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel
Metal against the metal
Our proud stands still

Fire ripping the air
Falling down from the sky
Die, die winged knights
Our revenge will come with might

Under the red sky
The battle is close to end
Run, Run surrender in pain
We'll wait for you again

...And the Dark Valley burns

Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel
Metal against the metal
Our proud stands still

[Solo (Eduardo Marques)]

Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel
Metal against the metal
Our proud stands still
