Deep in the forest
Down the trees
So dark and so cold
We cry the end of our king

Hurt and tired
Laid down on the field
We heard the last breath
His spirit dancing in the wind

Goodbye my brother
King of the kings
Your braveness and wisdom
The bards will sing
You'll be remembered
Majesty and hero
Fly like a hawk
In this sad tale of the kingdom

Fly high to the sky
My king, my pride
Don't be afraid to rest
In your grave in the west

If we had a way
To bring back Theodoric
I swear to Gods
We will face the trip

One elf told me in the past
About the Hall
Where the spirits of the knights
Return from the Death

Goodbye my brother
King of the kings
Your braveness and wisdom
The bards will sing
You'll be remembered
Majesty and hero
Fly like a hawk
In this sad tale of the kingdom

Fly high to the sky
My king, my pride
Don't be afraid to rest
In your grave in the west

Now we are crying
In the circle of the knights
Remember our victories
When we fought with pride

You were a great warrior
You were the lord of war
The sky turned black
You fell in the hands of death
