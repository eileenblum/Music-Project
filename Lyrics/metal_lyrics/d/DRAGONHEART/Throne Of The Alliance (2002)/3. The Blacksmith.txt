Hail the Blacksmith [6 times]

We came from the Alliance
Beyond the hills
Where is the Blacksmith who lives here?
"In the end of path a dungeon exist...
But take care my friend he is a freak"

Hail the blacksmith [6 times]

Crossing Helderville we found the one
Are you the blacksmith We're looking for?
Demon of steel my army is here,
We need your services to save the king

Hail the blacksmith [6 times]

"I have all the weapons banished from the kingdom
My magic anvil will lead you to victory
Sword of storms and Hammer of the evil
My mortal steel will destroy your enemy"

He is the Blacksmith
Power of Thunder
Made of steel

With the sword of storms you can control
Hurricanes and winds to protect the throne
With the hammer of evil
Brandishing in your hands
The ground will swallow all the trolls of these lands

Hail the blacksmith [6 times]

Locked in his dungeons
Three days and three nights
With his hammer and anvil, Forging the strike
March to the victory legion of storm, The mighty steel
Will shed the blood

Hail the blacksmith [6 times]

I have all the weapons banished from the kingdom
My magic anvil will lead you to victory
Sword of storms and Hammer of the evil
My mortal steel will destroy your enemy

He is the Blacksmith
Power of Thunder
Made of steel

The Blacksmith [8 times]
