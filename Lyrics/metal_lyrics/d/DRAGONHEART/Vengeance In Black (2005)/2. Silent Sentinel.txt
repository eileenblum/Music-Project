Take this mission
With the valour of your soul
Save yourself
There's no way out

Silent Sentinel

The strike of iron
Won't be heard down the earth
Nothing here its look like
Kordhen wait for the sacred Knight

Silent Sentinel

Follow the light
Follow the bright
Follow Knight DragonHeart
And we stay side by side

The sacred steel awaits
Let your heart leads you
Let the sacred steel feel the fear
By the hands of Silent Sentinel

Silent Sentinel

We are moving in circles
We rise and we fall
Beyond the sacred steel
We are the sacred Knight

Silent Sentinel

Follow the light
Follow the bright
Follow Knight Dragonheart
And we stay side by side

The sacred steel awaits
Let your heart leads you
Let the sacred steel feel the fear
By the hands of Silent Sentinel
