From the walls and out in the mist
The ghosts are hunting us in the limit of sanity
Secrets of humanity are hidden on the ground
The heat of time will burn our identity

In the desert the pyramid rise
We have to run against the time
In the desert will lay our tomb
Its true the stone its not mine

Future and past will collide
We run against the time
Fighting to be free
To the Queops Escape
With the stone and the staff we'll be free
This freedom you can't see
To the Queops Escape

Wake the dead with the stone in his crown
Take me down where the fallen angels rise
Ethereal forms rise from the ground
We are lost in time lost in the time

Like a cold breath of a dead man walking
We are searching our salvation
The staff will save us, Arlin will save us
With the stone we'll be free

In the desert the pyramid rise
We have to run against the time
In the desert will lay our tomb
Its true the stone its not mine
