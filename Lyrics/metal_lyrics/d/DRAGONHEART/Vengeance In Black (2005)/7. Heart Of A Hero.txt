[Vocals: Olaf Senkkbeil]

I close my heart to these feelings
I see your face looking back to me
Until the night, she will die
If I have to die, I'll die for you

In the shadows of the night
I found in the heard of a blind
The confidence and confiance
Until I wait the night

By your side
I'll stay alive
And my heard of a hero
Will be full of life

Now I have might
A different side
My heart of a hero
Can face the night
My heart of a hero
Can face the night

By your side
I'll stay alive
And my heard of a hero
Will be full of life

Now I have might
A different side
My heart of a hero
Can face the night
My heart of a hero
Can face the night
