The misty fall down and
We know for what we fight
Our actions prove what we say is true

May our hearts be strong to defeat the lies
May our hearts are pure to the fall of the night

We are united
United for a dream
We are united for the alliance
We are here for the Crusaders March

We look beyond the mountains
We fight beyond the seas,
Can our army are be strong to fight the enemy

We raise our hands to the wind
And stand up for the crown and for the king

We are united
United for a dream
We are united for the alliance
We are here for the Crusaders March
