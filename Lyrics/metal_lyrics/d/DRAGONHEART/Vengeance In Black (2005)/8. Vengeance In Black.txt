The pressure of darkness turns me insane
A cruel madness domain my heart
Everyone will pay, laying into the dark
And from a cold flame I will let my mark

A black and grey world will be your home
Silent and pathetic creatures you are
Akronis kingdom falls into a disgrace
I will spread my grey disease

I am a fallen angel
Descent of evil, a messenger of hell
I will get mine
I am a fallen angel
Descent of evil, but it doesn't matter who I am

There's no tomorrow, no heroes here
This is the vengeance, the vengeance in black
The strength for another attack

A cold punishment is the reward
I will proclamate an eternal war
I am the devil in disguise
Raise your new god, and hail the evil

I am a fallen angel
Descent of evil, a messenger of hell
I will get mine
I am a fallen angel
Descent of evil, but it doesn't matter who I am

We are going to fight
We are fighting for vengeance in black
