In the Eriels dreams
In the Eriels insanity
There are the answers
There are the truth

Soon the truth will be clear
And all story will be clear
I am the chosen one
Am I a fallen angel?
Is it lost in the dark
Or still there in your heart

Can you believe in me?
Can you stay by my side?
When the truth appears
Can you believe in me?

Kingdom falls
Valiant soldiers are dead
I am blind but I can see
I can see everything

The fallen castle
A dark castle
The fallen king
A corrupt king

From the flames
Of the black heart
The trinity heart rises
Powerful and doomed

Other worlds
You'll reach
Black dimensions you can keep
In the great Triangle you'll be lost
With fire of spirit
With force of will

Can you believe in me?
Can you stay by my side?
When the truth appears
Can you believe in me?

Kingdom falls
Valiant soldiers are dead
I am blind but I can see
I can see everything

The fallen castle
A dark castle
The fallen king
A corrupt king

Take care take care
The trinity hearts
Wait for you
They will try to confuse
And try to corrupt

Take care take care
The trinity hearts
Wait for your soldiers
They will try to confuse
They will try to corrupt

Can you believe in me?
Can you stay by my side?
When the truth appears
Can you believe in me?

Kingdom falls
Valiant soldiers are dead
I am blind but I can see
I can see everything

The fallen castle
A dark castle
The fallen king
A corrupt king
