I have visions, they are already memories
There are echoes in the distant past
Here I have fire, here I have pain
Here the roaring sound of victory

Ride on -- Through the hills
They belong to use
Ride across -- Through the mountains

Find the questions, ask to the immortal
Find the roots of steel
The dragons will save us
Because today I will be calling the dragons

In the sky they fly free
Flying as far a we can see
Riding the stars and the moon
We take you this march
Where the sins will be forgiven
I speak the words of dead tongues

Ride on -- Through the hills
They belong to us
Ride across -- Through the mountains

Find the questions, ask to the immortal
Find the roots of steel
The dragons will save us
Because today I will be calling the dragons
