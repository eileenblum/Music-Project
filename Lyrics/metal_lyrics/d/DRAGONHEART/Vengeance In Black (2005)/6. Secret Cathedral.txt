The chosen one follows me
I just let they follow me
They will discover the secret
The secret, my secret
Their ruin lives in my underworld

Under the ground
And far away from the sun
The profane cathedral awaits
The holy ceremony

Nothing can stop me
Nothing will stop me
Nothing can stop me
Nothing will stop me

All the ways to all worlds is in my hands
I control the ways to all dimensions
It's mine - Secret Cathedral
It's mine - Secret Cathedral

Nothing matters now
My goals will be reached
I control the portal, I control the creatures

Lay down the castle
Monsters and demons
Are crawling the steps to the gate
The time has come
Now is the time to have pain

Nothing can stop me
Nothing will stop me
Nothing can stop me
Nothing will stop me

All the ways to all worlds is in my hands
I control the ways to all dimensions
It's mine - Secret Cathedral
It's mine - Secret Cathedral

My world so far is pain and insane
I condemned this world to the pain
