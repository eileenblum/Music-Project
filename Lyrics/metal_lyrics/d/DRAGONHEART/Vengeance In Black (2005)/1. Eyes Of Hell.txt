The rolling of fire
The rising of evil
No choice you have
I'm the Watcher
I'm rolling the dices
I'm twisting your fate
Confronting the mystic charade
You'll find the souls...

You don't know the fear
I am the fear
You don't know the chaos
I am the chaos

Eyes of hell
I am the Dealer (with)
Eyes of hell
Beware the Watcher

I will bring a choice to rise all your fear
The rest of your Army
Have Valour and Honor
A world full of anger you'll get nobody will listen to yours prays
Condemned and doomed you'll fall...

You don't know the fear
I am the fear
You don't know the chaos
I am the chaos

Eyes of hell
I am the Dealer (with)
Eyes of hell
Beware the Watcher
