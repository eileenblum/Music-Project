On the sky, the black king appears
To reap the soul and flesh of the soldiers

They have to fear, they have no soul
We've seen they come, now the black king is here

On the ground looking to the stars
With bows and arch's, arrows and steel

The magic spells are a great allied
To our victory, on the ground and in the sky

The dark king came riding on a black winged creature
With your corrupt mind, and his profane staff
He wants our blood, wants our soul
He wants us dead

Surrender is not an option
For a dream we are here
And for this dream we fight
And we'll keep spreading fire
Until we still stand up

Tongues of fire kill and destroy
Claws of death rip and steel flesh

A thousand men will fall
The Lynhkor's triumph is coming near

The dark king came riding on a black winged creature
With you corrupted mind, and his profane staff
He wants our blood, wants our soul
He wants us dead

Surrender is not an option
For a dream we are here
And for this dream we fight
And we'll keep spreading fire
Until we still stand up

Endless pain, endless suffering I'll bring
I'll turn this world in a lack cold paradise
The alliance cant stop the winged hordes
You are doomed, your gods will fall by my hands

Spreading fire
Spreading fire
Spreading fire
Spreading fire
