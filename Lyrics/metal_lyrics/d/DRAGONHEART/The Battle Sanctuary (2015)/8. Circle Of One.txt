[Storyline]
With every death of soldiers, not only of the Alliance, but all who fought the blazing fire of hell, the Black King Theodoric gains more and more power. With the death of Erick the Red, his power became enormous, and intoxicated by that power, his thirst for blood and souls was growing, and he wondered how much vital power he could gain by draining the death of Gen. Dragonheart. More and more his servants served him for attacks and defenses, but the Black King only would strike when the enemy was worthy of being killed. The Black King was losing his humanity and began to acquire skills outside the standards of human race, facing entire armies alone, and feeling that his reign began to consolidate. Souls trapped inside one man, something unnatural, demonic. Theodoric literally had become a General of Hell.

Darkness all around, a voice calls me
Aimless, faceless
Shadows surround me. I can be shadow
But I can't be down
A rotten soul, a sick man
That's what I am

I have too much inside my soul
I've trapped too many pathetic fools
Those are mine, my disillusions
Are my own Holy War

[Bridge:]
Kings beware! I'm immortal man
I will strike you down (Holy War)
Here I am to take your crown
To steal your soul to steal your mind

[Chorus 2x:]
I control the thoughts
Going insane the souls cry for the one
I listen to a laughing crow
'Cause I control the Circle of One

A new fresh soul, a single power
Their souls are mine
With their disillusions
The strength of many is mine
But l am, I am the only one

[Bridge]
[Chorus 2x]

A control... your thoughts
I control the Circle of One
