[Storyline]
Even kings need some rest to think about what really worth it until now. Sadly think about those who have gone and proudly honor those who live. The night is the perfect mantle to the balanced thoughts that can be suddenly corrupted by rot. Everyone gather and rest 'cause they know that after every battle, although camped, they are always marching under the stars...

A crown of thorns and bravery
For their King, for their land
There is nothing more
No battle cries to hear, anymore
We are far away from home
And death will be our tome

[Bridge:]
The shine of steel and the smell of the blood
Burn in the ground and we are full of pride
We never give up we never give in
Our strength is our heart
And it will be only one

[Chorus:]
Empty your mind
Our destiny was changed
To pull down our enemy
Rescue the land of the Alliance
We saved many souls marching under the stars

For many times the evil appears
But there is a hope in the air
We now will conquer
Hear their scream, hear us fighting
We fight for a crown, we fight for our King
With a heart made of gold
We are stronger than steel
Our spirits will be free

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Time has its end
Down to hell, whispers fade way...
