[Storyline]
Returning from the bloody battle for the judgment of the death of King Theodoric, everyone was back to the holy land of the Alliance that was still in flames. There was still the smell of the spirit of death, even though few have survived. Here is the question: Who chooses where and when we die? Nobody has that power. We can only choose how we die: fighting alongside the companions in battle, next to your family, alone, whatever. That makes us unique. But we do not have that power. But the soldiers of the Alliance did have, and they would die there side by side for freedom and honor to fight alongside the already legendary Gen. Dragonheart.
As might be expected, Theodoric chases Dragonheart, and in the mountains of growing storms they fought. The Black King was in possession of countless souls giving him strength, while Gen. Dragonheart had his courage, anger, rage and sadness, beyond the metal sword forged by the legendary blacksmith. The battle extends to the Sanctuary of the Alliance, where the fatal blow is given. Theodoric's head rolls down the mountain and everybody scream in victory, but Gen. Dragonheart falls with a spear stucked in his chest by Theodoric. The Alliance is silenced and stutters, seeing their leader falling slowly under the screams of his warriors.

In a holy mission we fell
We fought to save our kingdom
We fought to save our families
I hope their death was not in vain

The legend will tell the tale
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
This is the final end
This is the final command

[Bridge:]
Premonition - That's what you have to see
Premonition - That's what you have to feel

[Chorus:]
In this Battle Sanctuary
This is your destiny
In this Battle Sanctuary
Because death have arrived to me

I walk in the darkness
I saw the light in the mist
My blood spread on the grass
And I kept fighting until the end

And so the battle was won
With the strength of our hearts
With our invincible souls
This the darkness can't defeat

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
