[Storyline]
With the fall of Erick The Red, one of his most valiant warriors, and facing such catastrophe and devastation, Gen. Dragonheart decides to organize battle lines until reinforcements arrive. Everyone knew he was the king of the land of the Alliance. But even so he did not like to be called like this. He liked to be called of what he has always been: a soldier, a true warrior. To maintain this, he needed battle lines that could trust in his Gen., and he decided to set up those battle lines inside the palace of the Arcanum. And they fought, and those who survived told their tales to the world.

Welcome to the somber fields
A last chance to live and survive
Pain cuts me down through my vein
Can I break the enemy?
Welcome to the darkest reality
Your dreams die here forever

[Bridge:]
You will be welcome to...
Welcome to my grave
The enemy sees my dreams
Nothing will stop my rage

[Chorus:]
Battle Lines - Soldiers in the night
Battle Lines - I see blood everywhere

Death is waiting on the grass
And hope in our fear
Run, face the iron and steel
The rivalry came from the past
And all the blood is on the ground
My magic runes will be my guide

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

The storm will come in the end
The proud of Alliance remains
These rain are blood and we know it
That's why we'll be ready to fight
