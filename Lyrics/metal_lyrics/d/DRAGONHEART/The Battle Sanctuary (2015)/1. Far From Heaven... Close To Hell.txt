[Storyline]
...and the battle goes on until last standing soldier. The warriors are tired and dirty due the past battles but even so their souls are still thirsty for the enemy's blood. The battle doesn't end until the last blood drop fall from their honored swords blades. Does this make our Warriors of the Alliance more honored that those who betrayed them? The general asks himself if he and his warriors, as they fought to defend their kingdom surrounded by mountains and valleys, were becoming equal to those warriors who they fought against. Only one answer comes to his mind and despite the freezing cold and the fact that he was dressed with heavy clothes, made of skins of bears and wolves, he felt a chill on his spine. And looking the devastated iced lands around him, the answer is more than clear: "We are more and more far from heaven and closer to hell...". And with this disturbed and unquiet thought the battle for the sacred sanctuary starts and ends now...

We see a new horizon beyond our imagination
In another world we walk in the shade

The clamor of many deaths is spread in the wind
The time of the oath begins

Through stone and fire we march... to the death
Here lies the coldness and the impurity

In the hall of the evil king
Now we feel the cold touch of death

[Bridge]
Make a promise to yourself
Heal me and hear my cry (hear my cry)
Make a promise to the soldiers of the night
If you still believe

[Chorus 2x]
Far from heaven... Close to hell
When the story ends
We can break the spell

We saw this dark horizon
We felt this chaos and pain
In this wicked world
We walked in the shadows

The clamor of many deaths
Is spread in the air
The sulfur smell of the dead

With power and courage
We march. We stand
The faith of our soldiers
To overcome the death

In the halt of the evil king
Now we feel the cold touch of death

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[2x]
Voices call the Alliance back to home
If the will to fight dies there's no hope
