[Storyline]
There are stories that stay without an end, which many times can be a new beginning. The most fervorous fans will say that there are "loose ends in the three chapters," but one thing this humble storyteller, who has closely followed all the mishaps of our warriors during those years, can say: they fought even if the obstacle was impassable. They lost loved beings and friends, but still fought with all the greed that they always kept; they fought against inner demons and no one can ever know how hard this fight was. Many had come and gone, and new soldiers have Joined the cause. But one thing is for sure: time will tell that there are warriors, fighters and legends, and while the name Dragonheart and the Alliance are remembered, oh yes you can say... The past is becoming a myth, and the names of the Alliance and of Gen. Dragonheart are becoming Immortals!

Sometimes good warriors die
There's no replacement for them
The last battle was a hell of a fight
And we lost the best of us
But the Alliance still remains

[Pre-chorus:]
Our future sons will sing this legend
Until the past becomes a myth

[Chorus:]
The time will tell, maybe the tale has just begun
Some soldiers cry, but the Dragon will return
His spirit flies far beyond the sun
The Dragon eyes are always standing, watching us
The time will tell

King warrior Dragonheart
Spreading life for glory and pride
His honour in our heart
Reminding all of us
His death keeps us united and strong

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-chorus]

[Bridge]

Until the past becomes a myth
Our sons will sing this legend
Until the past becomes a myth
His spirit flies forever
