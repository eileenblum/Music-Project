[Storyline]
We all have a secret fear, something we cannot confront. But just live with It and use it for our own benefit. Fear of the dark, fear of death or of himself. Whatever. The Demon King has finally found something that can defeat the army of the Alliance: the Inner fears of every soldier, and the most valuable of them: the biggest fear of Gen. Dragonheart, who, if be killed, his armies surely would fall with him. The Gen. trembles before this situation and his fear becomes his greatest ally, giving him the strength to carry on without collapsing in front of his men. His death was certain, but should be justified and honored, serving as divine strength to his men and their descendents... He recalls his father's words: "In the absence of light, darkness prevailsâ¦ Illuminates those who follow youâ¦"

Am I lost? Lost in the time
I wait for the last breath
Soldiers hear my name

They're showing me the way
Into the dark, into their minds
I laugh from the dark side
They can hear my voice

[Chorus 4x]
Inside the enemy
Inside the enemy's mind

Where am I?
Darkness is all around
They pray for the light
I'll fall into the dark
I hold the key
I hold the gate
And I search for deliverance
They hear my voice

[Chorus 4x]
