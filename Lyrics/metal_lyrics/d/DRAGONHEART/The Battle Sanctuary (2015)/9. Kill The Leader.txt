[Storyline]
With the few options left to him, Gen. Dragonheart talks to Arlin the Magician, who, readily willing to help him, says: "Dragonheart my friend, the ones who can help you are the Ancient Oracles to whom you resorted in the past. They are our last hope!" After getting a sign of agreement of his General, who just lowered his head, Arlin the Magic has left in search for the Oracles to maybe bring a little hope. A few days later the magician returns, tired and visibly weakened, bringing scary but encouraging answers. And breathless he said to Gen. Dragonheart: "There is still hope, the Oracles say. Cut the head and the body will fall! But do not wait to remain unharmed. Only someone honored in blood could perform such a task." Dragonheart got the message, and as fast as he could he gathered his troops to encourage them to have a feeling of end of the battle where they would be rewarded for their journey so far. And then all shouted together. "Kill the leader!"

My name is fear, chaos is my life
The leader controls the troops
With a cold spirit

Gods or demons waiting for him?
One fall and everybody will fall
Feel the pain, feel the blood rain

Too late to hear their screams
Too late to hear them cry
Find out who calls the battle
Find out who calls the dark

All the army will reach the end
Every man will hear my call
All the confront is a hell
All the enemies will fall

[Bridge]
Agony is my name
Death always remains the same
Agony is my name
Death always remains the same

[Chorus]
Killâ¦ Kill... Killâ¦ the leader
Killâ¦ Kill... Killâ¦ the leader
Killâ¦ Kill... Killâ¦ the leader
Killâ¦ Kill... Killâ¦ the leader
