[Storyline]
With the Infiltration of the Black King through the Black Shadow in mystically protected lands of Alliance and in the warrior's minds, the fear takes over the bones of the soldiers. Despite they had lived many cruel realities, nothing would be more scary than the Arcane's Palace. The Demon King, when in his own domains is coldly scary, and that is something that not even the General Dragonheart can stop feeling. With the expulsion of the Black Shadow of the sacred land of the Alliance, a counterspell was spreaded against those who succumbed before the Black Shadow and those who have fought against it, and all were thrown directly into the heart of hell. The heavy smell of rotting in the air and blazing flames dancing between the walls covered with chains, hooks, bones, skulls and human flesh are the decoration of the Palace. The General Dragonheart tries to calm down his soldiers but he is not sure if they can defeat the Demon King in their own fields.

Screams of fury echo in the sky
A place built under hate and ice
The clamor of numerous voices spreads in the shore

"I am perpetual, I have the will
Feel my black blade and see my ritual
I am perpetual"

[Bridge]
The seas of vengeance
Across the Battle, in the sky
From here I will unleash the hell

[Chorus 2x]
The twisted mind holds the key
Unlock the horror and get the answers
(In the Arcane's Palace)
Down on the ground you can see
The pain is growing in your bones
(In the Arcane's Palace)

The Black Dragons lie in their control
Walls of flesh and bones made of stone

"Feel the deadly heat of hell, here is my tomb
A dark dungeon to enslave the souls
Feel my black blade and see my ritual
'Cause I am perpetual"

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Feel my black blade and see my ritual
'Cause I am perpetual

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
