[Storyline]
Blade and body acting as an individual, only one unit, one being... Inside the castle... or better saying... Inside the catacombs of Theodoric, who Is now the Black King, everything had to be transformed... corrupted... Body, mind, and steel, all distorted in the name of the great beast: the simple and complete destruction. To keep the fearless soldiers away from his castle he needed to destroy simple things like the steel that protected them... At this point General Erick the Red tries a direct attack and falls under the massacre of the the Black King and his beasts... It would be enoughâ¦ But both sides knew they were balanced, and General Dragonheart still owned a weapon that was obtained at the beginning of the devastation of the kingdoms of Claymored and Falkior: an unused sword that was forged with the purest metal and iron will of millions soldiers for centuries. It was time to fight and die in the name of the Alliance.

Through the deepest forests, beneath the stars we ride
The moon is glowing red like the warrior's blood
There's a prophecy, that tonight many men will die
The fire will burn forever in our hearts

[Bridge:]
Our destinies are calling us now
We are ready to take their lives
We go to the battle, we ride with the Gods
We are strong and we are not afraid to die

[Chorus:]
Together we fight, forever we'll live
Our Saints are our strength
'Cause we are forged in metal

Prominent leaders, cast your swords in the wind
A sign of war ready for death
The lightning's flash, the thunder's roar
Will petrify the weak
We'll show no mercy, we'll kill them all

[Bridge]
[Chorus 2x]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
