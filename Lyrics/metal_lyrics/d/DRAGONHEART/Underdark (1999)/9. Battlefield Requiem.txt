In this farway lands
The blood of my soldiers
Walking on the earth
Waiting for a great moment

Estorys of skills
About the Silver Squadron
Souls living in the forest
In your battlefield requiem

Agony and despair sufocate in the air
Storming over my head
Swords and axes ripping the flash

For who can wait the sunrise
tomorrow under the skies
For who can wait for the fight
It's your battlefield requiem

The wings of dragon
Draw in my arms
I grasp my blade
Forged in fire

One rason for fighting
A conquest for glory
The gods are blassing
With the wind and the power of steel
