The wind freezes my bones
While I'm riding through the darkness
Searching by the ruins
Where the Arcadia Gates wait
Old spirits call my name
And show me the way of wizards
Beyond of reality
I'm deep in the nightmare land

Looking at the sky
The dark rainbow
Rises in my fantasies
Mystic globins frightem in the night
Whith your bright eyes

You can't go on
Said one voice in the forest
Welcome to insanity hall where nobody scape

Arcadia Gates
Twilight of lost dreams
Arcadia Gates
No return never more
Arcadia Gates
Mirror of imagination
Arcadia Gates
I'm a foreign in this insane world

Wise an oaks of the wood
Tell me your forgotten secrets
Guiding in the stranger
The Lord of Illusions shades
Take me away from this place
I need come back to my father land
Twilight guardians
Help me to return

I see in the ravings
Galaxies travelling
Across the space and time
Magic fairies
Reveal for me
The holy creation dying

Now I understand
All the questions was the answers
A new life begin
And today I have a second chance

Arcadia Gates
Twilight of lost dreams
Arcadia Gates
No return never more
Arcadia Gates
Mirror of imagination
Arcadia Gates
I'm a foreign in this insane world

One black hole rise
And I fly to my dimension
You will learn the lesson
Said the Lord of the Illusions before the vanishment

Arcadia Gates
Twilight of lost dreams
Arcadia Gates
No return never more
Arcadia Gates
Mirror of imagination
Arcadia Gates
I'm a foreign in this insane world
