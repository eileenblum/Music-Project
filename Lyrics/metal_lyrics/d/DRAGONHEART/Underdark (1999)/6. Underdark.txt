I am a creature from the Underdark
Where no humans or dwarfs
In the dungeons get survive

Look to me and feel the fear
While you is take to die
I can hear your last words
In the caves said goodbye

We don't see
The light of the stars
Visions come in my mind
Evil Loth
The queen of Drows
Creeping for the dark

Listen the elf songs
Singing all your horror
Trought the underdark
A risk for everyone
A millions miles from home
Trought the underdark

You will know
Now hear my screams
Who I am? I'm your end
Troubling your dreams

Dephts of Toril hateful laughters
Trolls watch in the walls
My mortal trap is wait for you
Down for the underground

They will come
In the winter night
Whith bright axes and your might
Stoling cities
For all the lands
The death in your hands

Listen the elf songs
Singing all your horror
Trought the underdark
A risk for everyone
A milions miles from home
Trought the underdark
