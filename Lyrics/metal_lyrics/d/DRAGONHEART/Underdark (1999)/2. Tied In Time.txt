The sands of time
Are running more than speed of light
All dimensions
Are taking us to the same place

The gate is open
And you can see a great new world
Like a dream a red moon shines in the sky

I can feel the emotions growing in my heart
When I see the great world under my eyes

I'm lost and tied in time
I'm living

Beyond hills
Where a castle flies in the high clouds
The knights ride
Across the mountain of black Crystal

In this kingdom
Space and time don't exist
Just nights and days where I will live forever
