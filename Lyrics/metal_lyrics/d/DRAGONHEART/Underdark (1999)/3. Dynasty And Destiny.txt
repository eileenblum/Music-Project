Long live to the kingdom
Tree cheers to the holy child
All of your power
Will be to reign with might

Loyalty and courage
Your sword will revenge
The oath of the justice
He is the choice of saints

The royal crown of your forefathers
Braveries tell histories across the time

Dynasty and Destiny
The honour is in your face
The wisdom will be the key
the way of great glories

Horns sing a new age
The throne is relic of skies
The temptation of power
Is a dungeon in a dark night

The wisdom are like a dragon
Lord of everything
The holy graal for gods
Hail the king of kings
