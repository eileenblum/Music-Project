I cannot get the news on screen
A headfuck day by day
Out of hypocritical brains
Been re-elected, not respected
War is not an action game

[Chorus:]
Rise with me - against the control
Proud we'll be - the other side
Raise your fist - against the control
Support, all you anarchists

Rock their butts to pieces
Don't you back down, resist!

[Chorus 2:]
Take your stand - against the control
Hand by hand - the other side
Take a ride - against the control
Hit them from the inner side

Rock their butts to pieces
Don't you back down, resist!

Cry when you feel the same!

Step by step in your own trap
On a one way track
It goes on and on again [2x]

And they're sending it again and again
The disgusting spot with the flames
That burn bushfires hot
Hit the christain, hit the nation
People in intimidation

[Chorus]

Rock their butts to pieces,
Don't you back down, resist!

[Chorus 2]

Rock their butts to pieces,
Don't you back down, resist!

Cry when you feel the same!

Step by step in your own trap
On a one way track
It goes on and on again [2x]

[Chorus 2]

Rock their butts to pieces
Don't you back down, resist!

Cry when you feel the same!

Step by step in your own trap
On a one way track
It goes on and on again [4x]
