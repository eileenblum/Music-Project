Chainsaw's singing
Chainsaw's singing

Turn on the engine, smell the fuel
The thrill is overwhelming
It kicks, it grinds right through it all
Vibrations apprehending

It's roaring, it's roaring
Control what gravity befalls
You're bawling, loud calling
Its sound just dominates
Can't be drowned out

[Chorus:]
Deadly frequency
A chainsaw symphony
Feast upon the purest zeal
It's screaming right through me
A chainsaw symphony
Never-ending play

Now concentrate, apply the blade
Decide what stands, what falls
The threat is omnipresent
Dissecting lives and walls

Keep sawing, keep sawing
The thrill is overwhelming
Steam rising, steam rising
You're running blind, destruction left behind

[Chorus:]
Deadly frequency
A chainsaw symphony
Feast upon the purest zeal
It's screaming right through me
A chainsaw symphony
Never-ending play

Chainsaw's singing
Chainsaw's singing (out loud)

Now cut it off, you're playing god
Disrupt one from another
An ancient creation
Worth's nothing you should bother

Berserker, berserker
The thrill is overwhelming
Massacre, massacre
A rolling stone keeps grading everything

My chainsaw
My chainsaw
My chainsaw
My chainsaw can't be stopped

[Chorus:]
Deadly frequency
A chainsaw symphony
Feast upon the purest zeal
It's screaming right through me
A chainsaw symphony
Never-ending play
