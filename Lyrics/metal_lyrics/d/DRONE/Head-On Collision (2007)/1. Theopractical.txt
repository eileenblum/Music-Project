This is the dusk that breaks at 6 am
Day in day out
You keep the child inside a man
But introverted

Frustration
Has become a habit in time
True lie
You're selling your cunt for a line
Just swallow
And learn how to love, not to spit
Keep tasting
And feel how you're loosing the grip

[Chorus:]
Life's colliding - its all changing
Life's colliding - my theopractical life

Your death goes on right from day one
The clock goes tick
To reach the top you kneel deep down
The ways to creep and crawl

Take seat
Convincingly release your fart
Cold heat
You're knowing your target by heart
Transparent mask
You're smiling while hiding your fears
Final Task
You're living the love tasting fears

[Chorus:]
Life's colliding - its all changing
Life's colliding - my theopractical life

Hear: life is calling
See: life goes on
Real life is calling
See: life is crashing down

[Chorus:]
Life's colliding - its all changing
Life's colliding - my theopractical life
