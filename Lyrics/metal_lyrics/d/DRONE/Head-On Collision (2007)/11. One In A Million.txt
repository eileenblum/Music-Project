They come with tanks in spread disdain,
Pumping down a cultures fate,
If young, if old, if armed or not,
For freedom in the name of god!

[Chorus:]
And then you're freaking and you're seeking
For a victim of your mission,
Feel the pressure that is steaming,
Be the killer of the regime

I hate this fate
My hate is my way

[Chorus 2:]
Hunt for you - hunt for me - hunt for everybody
Could be you - could be me - could be anybody
Hating you - hating me- hating everybody
Feel no sorry, no worry for anybody

Don't you forget! Hey!

Blood for oil and tears for all,
kills and thrills of defend's call
Go alone to the sacrifice
Now run for revenge, try to die!

[Chorus]

I hate this fate
My hate is my way

[Chorus 2]

Can't you see
Can't you feel

Hating you - hating me - hating everybody
Killing you - killing me - killing every fucking body

Can't you see there's no way out of hell!
