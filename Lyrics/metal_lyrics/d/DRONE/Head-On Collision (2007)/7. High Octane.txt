You spread your hands above me
to treat me like a fool
I can say that anything that I do
makes me one of those fucks reflecting me

I can't stay that pain
Dark god is inside me

This is the laughter your deserve
I set the law you break
I won't howl about what you fake

'cause I hit so proud
I spit aloud

I'm hoping to face confrontation
I won't embrace the lie
Cannot leave you alive

I'm hoping to face confrontation
I won't stay
Without a kill

I've got high octane
Dark god is inside me

I can't forget all the patience that
You sent to me in the past
I can't forget all the sorrow that
You sent to me at last

Now you can't forget all the patience that
I sent to you in the past
You can't forget all the sorrow that
I sent to you at last
