You spread your hands above me,
You treat me like a fool
I can't say that everything that I do
Makes me one of those freaks, you want me to...

I can't stand that pain - dark god is inside me

This is the laughter you deserve
I set the law you break
Then I can't hold out what you fake

Cause I hit so proud
I hit so loud

I'm hoping - face confrontation
I cannot face the lie
Cannot leave you alive

I'm hoping - face confrontation
I cannot stay
Without a kill

I can't stand that pain - dark god is inside me
I've got high octane - dark god is inside me

I can't forget all the patience that you sent to me in the past
I can't forget all the sorrow that you sent to me at last
Now you can't forget all patience that I sent to you in the past
You can't forget all the sorrow that I send to you at last
