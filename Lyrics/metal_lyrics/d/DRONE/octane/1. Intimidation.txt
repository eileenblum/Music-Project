I cannot get the news on screen
A headfuck day in day out
Dumb shit of a hypocrite in pain
Been re-elected not respected
War is not an action game!

Rise with me - against the control
Proud we'll be - the other side
Raise your fist - against the control
Support, all you anarchists

Rock their butts to pieces
I ain't fucked up, do resist

Take your stand - against the control
Hand by hand - the other side
Take a ride - against the control
Hit them from the inner side

Rock their butts to pieces
I ain't fucked up, do resist
Cry when you feel the same!

Step by step in your own trap
On a one way track - it goes on and on again

And they're sending it again and again
A disgusting spot with the flames
That burn as Bush fires hot
Hit the Christian, hit the nation
People in intimidation
