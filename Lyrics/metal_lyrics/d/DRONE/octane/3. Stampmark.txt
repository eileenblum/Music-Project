The way you walk, the way you talk
You silly piece of blown up pork
It makes me puke right away
Two more words you make my day

The stampmark pressed into your face
Kick me hard the message says
You broke the rules without a shame
But listen trouble is my name

So, eye of the devil - eye
Rise to hell level - rise

I'm gonna push your turn-off switch
Cause you're going too far
I rock you down and hit you hard
I like your smile while spitting blood

You fool, you're goin' another way

For every pain you gain on me
You've got an expensive price to pay
You've got the cash and will to stay

To sacrifice in agony
