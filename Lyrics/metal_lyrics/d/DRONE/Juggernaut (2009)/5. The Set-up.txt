All that you wish for in your life
Is being famous, being like
Stars on screens and in magazines
Sipping drinks in stretched limousines

Audition for a casting show
To get exploited strip your soul
Hop or top the spotlight rules
Playing the game, playing the saint, being the dazzler on the loose

Set up, money made
Parse the need to sell and feed

Nothing's won
(when you're) trying to
Play the game and
Smile at three
(cockeyed) judges for
Their affirmation
It's pathetic

Collapsing bitches, crying men
A copycat, fanatic fan
Muscleman with female voice
Justly sneared at, it's the public's choice

Showmanship on stage you don't deserve
