A sphere to run to, a place to deploy yourself
Boundless in bliss
Shut down the day and enter the Neverland
Free admission
Yeah be the one, the McClane who saves the day
Undefeated

Boneless you're streaming
Fear awaits in darkened places, sanity at stake
Futile to try to escape, the story ends when you awake

But on the other hand a place where you lose control
Unprotected
You try to strike a match but it always breaks in two
Try in vain and
You want to use a phone but no numbers come to mind
Flee and wake up

Boneless you're streaming
Unbridled dreaming
Abandon all reason for good

Feeling so lost inside
Boneless nightmare

Awake
Boneless, dream away
