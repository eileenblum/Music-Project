You and I are not forever
So they say, there ain't no shelter
Take it as it is because
Every day could be your last

Me and you, we've both been through
Highs and lows, that's how it goes
But I moved on, to conquer all
Burn your ships like Cortez did
Call it quits

A better attitude
A futuristic mood
The storyteller's mute
A punchline that just goes like this:

You see, you cling fast to your yesterdays
"and that's why I
Turn my head"
Is what you said
"and lick the wounds from which I've bled"
There is no use in looking back
Confidence is what you lack

What's gone is gone - the die is cast
Can't be undone - decisions last
Burn your ships like Cortez did

Done and dusted
Caught and busted
Done and dusted
Call it quits

A punchline that just goes like this:
You see, you cling fast to your yesterdays
And swallow these bitter tears
Set out for what will be
It's all done and dusted

How do you live with yourself?!
Whining, rewinding, regretting, wallowing in pain

No complaint - no missing sense
No lack of aim - no use of fence
No rewind back into the past
Burn your ships like Cortez did
Call it quits

You see, you cling fast to your yesterdays and swallow these bitter tears
Set out for what will be
The past is just legacy
