You did this to me.
You're the reason I have so much hatred inside of my heart.
I'm empty and ill seek revenge on you

You're cold hearted, fucking spineless.
You created a monster.
My anger is growing stronger

A trust was broken.
You've lost all of my respect.
I will unleash my rage on you

Wrapping my hands around your throat.
Instilling fear.
Feel your heart racing as I send you to hell.
You made me believe in something that wasn't even there.
A fucking fake, you didn't even care.
I'll put a knife through your back as you did to me.
They say what goes around comes back around.

I want you to die [2x]
I fucking hate you

You made me believe in something that wasn't even there.
A fucking fake, you didn't even care.
I want to watch you fall to pieces.

I want you to die [4x]
I fucking hate you
