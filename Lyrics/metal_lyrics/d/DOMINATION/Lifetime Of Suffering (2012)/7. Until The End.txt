I live for this.
It's what keeps me alive.
If it wasn't for hardcore, I'd be going nowhere.
It's the only place that I can call a home.
Good friends, good music, good fucking times.

This will forever be my home.

I will never leave this place.
I'm here til' the bitter end.
I will never leave this.

Many friends have come and gone.
This place isn't what it used to be.
But I know that hardcore will always be there for me.

I will never leave this place.
I'm here til' the fucking end.
I will never leave this place.
A place I call my home.
