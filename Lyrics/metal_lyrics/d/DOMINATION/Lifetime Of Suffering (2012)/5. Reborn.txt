You can't stop us now.
We're coming back stronger than ever.
We were fucked over.
You betrayed us all. [2x]

Digging deep to find the strength to keep going on.
Friendships were tested.
Our bond was torn apart. [2x]

Through the struggles.
Through the hardship.
I knew it was time to make a change.
Rebuilding of a path once destroyed.
It's a resurrection of a broken dream.

You fucking bitch.
You can't stop us now.
We don't need you.
We're coming back strong than ever.

You can't stop us now.
We're coming back stronger than before.

I am reborn. [4x]
