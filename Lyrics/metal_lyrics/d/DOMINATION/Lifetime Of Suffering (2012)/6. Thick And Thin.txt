This goes out to my friends, my brothers, my family.
Through thick and thin I will always have your back.
As we look out for each other.
Nothing will ever bring us down.
We've had our differences, but that will never break what we have.

I will forever be faithful.
A friendship that is unbreakable.

When the odds up against us.
We will run right thought them.
We are unstoppable.
Our bond is strong within this family. [2x]

We wont be torn apart.
We been from the start.
As we stand side by side.
Nothing will bring us down

As we stand side by side.
Nothing will bring us down.

This is my life.
This is my heart.
This is my loyalty.
And I'll be here through thick and thin [2x]

Through thick and thin [3x]
And I'll be here through thick and thin.
