Since the day I was born.
You've always protected me.
You kept me save.
Nothing could ever touch me.

I said when I grow up.
I wanna be just like you.
Always standing tall.
Break through anything in my way.

My father.
You are forever in my heart. [2x]

Everything was perfect til' the day it all came crashing down on me
The father I thought I knew was a liar, deceiver.
You're not what I thought you were.
My whole life was turned upside down.
A childhood became a fucking nightmare.
Becomes a fucking nightmare.

(HEY Chants)

I thought I could never forgive you.
I said I fucking hate you.
You god damn fake.
As you sit there rotting behind bars. [2x]

As these years go by, I understand.
Even your loved ones make mistakes in life.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
And I hope you can forgive me.

I will always care for you.
As you cared for me.
My father will forever live inside my heart.
