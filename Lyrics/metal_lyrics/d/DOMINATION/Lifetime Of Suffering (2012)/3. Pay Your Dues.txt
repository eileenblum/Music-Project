I've been here since day one.
No short cuts, no 2nd chances.
I've paid my dues
I've got what I earned.

You need to prove yourself.
Your actions aren't as loud as your words.
Pay your dues and step up.
You haven't earned your respect yet.

It just wont get handed to you.
Its not as easy as it looks. [2x]

Only the chosen few will stand among us.
The others will be left behind.

You haven't earned what I've worked for.
With my blood, sweat and tears.
I've proven myself time and time again. [3x]

You want respect?
Step the fuck up.
You want respect?
Pay your dues. [2x]

Step the fuck up.
Its time you pay your dues.
