Living a world of sensation
It ainât a good sense to be
Living in sin is also a good way to die

Gaze your last sunshine baby
Kiss him your sweetest goodbye
Before this day ends
All youâve lived, all youâve loved
Shall die, shall die.

Love? What love but the true one
No, youâll never know
A motherâs love to a son.

Donât you take your live away.
You wonât die! You wonât die!
Donât give up your life so fast
The lions are waiting to be fed.

Since your womb begat no baby
You got no honor, to me
And from this day on
You shall remain in your shame
