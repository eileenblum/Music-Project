Walk with me now to a journey in solitude
Towards the heart, where the shadow lies within

Out from the mud that grounds your sorrows
You must build a safe way
To cross the bridge of doubt and fear that lies ahead

âWhere is the light? Who should I follow?â
You might ask me; in vain.

Then you will find you wonât need anything
To enlighten the way

Smile! Make your own way
To a place whereâs worth living
Be stronger than death
None can dream somebody elseâs dream

Find out yourself
Step by step cross the door
No oneâs gonna see you,
No oneâs gonna hear
If you cry your fears out loud

Refrain from sorrows, refrain from sorrows
âOnce in pain, stay as quick as you canâ
