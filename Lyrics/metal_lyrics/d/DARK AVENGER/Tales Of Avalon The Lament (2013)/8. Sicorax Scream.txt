Seeking the lust for a day
Just to fill the emptiness
What can one find?
Is it worth the price?
How to deal with the aftermath?
We are guided by emptiness?
It keeps on saying thereâs one way to go
A restless mind, some craving hands
Never ending pain!

We are guided by emptiness?
It keeps on saying thereâs one way to go
To give away the soul
Every lonely soul, everything one cares
Must really one give to hold ones soul?
Everything one cares
Must really one give it away?
Must one give it away?

Life is just a blooming daisy
Among itâs petals you can make your way
But if itâs not the righteous path
Just remember sheâs not the only one

I have lost at once my mind
As Iâm crawling through the dark
I am lost, I have my soul
Every lonely soul
Everything one cares
And everything you tell me
Makes me lonely
Have you really a soul?
