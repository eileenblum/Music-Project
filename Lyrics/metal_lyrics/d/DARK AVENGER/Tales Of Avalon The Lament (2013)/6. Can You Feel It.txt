There's a love in my heart
that's is fading day by day
there's a hole drowning my soul away

There's a void in my hand
Since you have gone
And a never ending tear in my eye

Not long ago my heart exulted
I had you my poor little boy
Much long ago you've gone away
And I'm asking can you feel a mother's pain

Can you feel a mother's pain?
Can you see my tears becoming a pouring rain?

Along this lonely valley there's a river
And no more tears to cry
