Orphans of our own destiny, searching for dust and wind
I know weâre wrapped to choices that we have made in this life
What we became?

I still remember you saying to me that hell is repetition
That life goes round and round and we must prevent

The greed that blinds the will
The pride that blinds the faith
The doubt that blinds the hope
The hate that kills the love

Contradictions of speech and belief
We wonât find many friends I know

But if you let the feeling just lead the way
Burning like a fire

I still remember you saying to me that hell is repetition
That life goes round and round and we must prevent

The greed that blinds the will
The pride that blinds the faith
The doubt that blinds the hope
The hate that kills the love
