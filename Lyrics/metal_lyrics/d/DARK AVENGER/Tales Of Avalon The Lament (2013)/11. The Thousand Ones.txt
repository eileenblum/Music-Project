We are the ones
Weâre the ears and eyes through darkness
Wolves and ravens are our pals
Weâre the fear that grounds the nightmare

And you know we got the right
We were here before this madness
And this place is our home
To the ones who lives in happiness, heathendom

To remind us that we are not alone

Before the hanging man clouds our minds
Weâll take our own victory
Right in our hands, into the heart

Deep in the night
Where the sorcery is raised
You wonât face another dawn
âCos the pain will be your payment âtill the death

Oh yeah tonight!!!
See the cursed one is fading
Embraced by the unknown
See the Briton Dragon is bleeding to the end

Someday we will meet the face of death
To remind us that we are not alone

Before the hanging man clouds our minds
Weâll take our own victory
Right in our hands, into the heart

We are the thousand ones
Thousand voices
Inside your mind
Poisoning your head
