Here we meet again
Twice in a whole lifetime
Like foes
Swords in Hands
Ready to spill our own blood

Since the dawn of your life
I've aways wished to live by your side
Yes, I'm sad, I just can't hide
The foolish of my pride

But the feeling still remains
When I see your face again
You're a fallen angel from the sky
You've got their blood in your hands

See, the curse we bring
Will kill these men at our side
No man should die in vain
They'll never know why they're Dying

Since the dawn of your life
I've aways wished to live by your side
Yes, I'm sad, I just can't hide
The foolish of my pride

But the feeling still remains
When I see your face again
You're a fallen angel from the sky
You've got their blood in your hands
