[Linhares/Valdez/Vieira/DiCastro/Galvao]
[Version 2003: Linhares/Santiago/Dantas]

March with me you who are dead
Welcome to the hell
Leave here out all the hopes
Thou who cometh in
You will see there's no end
To the insanity
Endlessly you will stand
Burning in the fire

'Cos your life has come to an end
and now you've got to pay your dues

Dark Avenger, that's my name

See this is the place where you've come to
The suffer the pain and despair is on and on
Never stop
These are the rewards for when you were in sin
And now you gotta face, gotta pay to every mistake
You made

Yes Milady, say and I will
Tell the names and places
I'll bring them to your arms
My dear Lady Death

I just wait to cut their lives
And bring their souls to the realm of death

Dark Avenger, that's my game
