[Linhares/Santiago/Galuf/Mundim]

I enter this arena ready to kill
I'm thirsty urging for blood
And thrust my sword into other man flesh
Inviting him to the unknown

In every man's fall I can hear a scream
Echoing out in the air
Voices of many are calling for me
Maximus the Spaniard

I can feel the despair in the action
No matter they try
Killing the fields
Burning all through the nation
I will ride I will take them high

Hold the line stay with me
What we do in life echoes into eternity
Patres, Roma Victor
Patres, Unleash Hell

Companions of battle I summon thee
To compel the barbarian hordes
We brave shall face the Elysium Fields
Imagine it and it will be so

As long as I walk through these quiet wheat fields
I think of her Spanish eyes
I long for my home upon Trujillo hills
I long for the eyes of my child

Now it's the right time to hail all the heroes
Of Roman Empire
Caesar waits for you all in this battle
For the will of SPQR (*)

Hold the line stay with me
What we do in life echoes into eternity
Patres, Roma Victor
Patres, Unleash Hell
