[Linhares/Valdez]
[Acoustic version by: Linhares/Galuf]

You climb high for miracles
Think you cry in vain
The answer comes across the heavens
A sword of justice and pain

It comes to you in stormy weather
A name lost in dust of time
Beyond and underneath lake
I forged Caladvwch to you

Since the sword brought us together
We've been fighting for the throne
Let us pray to the heavens before
The bastard plague comes
Come! Like a damn dog
And taste the steel on my blade
I see no reason to be dead 
For our lives end in a dream

Our quest must live forever
Who will win we'll never know

But with Excalibur held high
There's no return to the evil one
Till the final act

Now they show no sign of mercy
The army of black breaks the walls
Knights of Round Table stand 
Against the evil on my own
Strong! All together 
Our faith lives endlessly
This quest means that our foes
Killed the Great White Deer

Our quest will live forever
To Camelot our blood

But with Excalibur held high
There's no return to the evil one
Till the final act

We follow the sign with Excalibur held high

We'll never gonna stop
I said never!

If you're searching for the meaning of faith
You will find it in these last few words
