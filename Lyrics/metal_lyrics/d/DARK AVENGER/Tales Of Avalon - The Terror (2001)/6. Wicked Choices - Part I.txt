[Dark Avenger]
- The hands of confusion spread stand, in the cities, in the houses and over the land; why is the King disturbed in his thought? why has the wizard so hardly wrought?

[???]
- Pendragon's lust endangered the realm, for Igraine the Queen his heart did turn, enraged the kingdom with a loony war, the siege of a castle lasts forever more. By wizard's craft he got a new face, he must posses her before his heart breaks. Transmuted in husband a figure lights the fire, deceives the queen to cease his desire. A kingdom divided in a cruel murdering, a new open door to more suffering. The price to pay was much too high, a boy taken afar a mother in cry.
