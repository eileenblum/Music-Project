[Dark Avenger]
- Conductor whose face I can't see a glimpse, who are all those whose hands prayers are thrown atop?

[???]
- The roman eagles they were many; as much as the stars in the sky; organised like bricks in a wall, marching and killing the poor in the towns. Subjugated not vanquished at all, the Little fought 'till the last man fall; up to heavens their prayers were sent, but then there was no answer to their call. There was still a cry of revenge, leading them out to resistance; up to the last Kell fall, up to the last sand over their bodies fall..

[The Druids]
Great Spirit hear us bow down and heed to our cry, we who give you the best of our bitter lives, red drips the branches of your sacred trees, bring us a hero who makes our foes to flee. O hear our cry to sacrifice within every cry you can see them, hear them; round and round we march in mystic rite, hear the sound of trumpets through the night, O hear our cry to sacrifice within every cry you might see the, hear the heroes of the down (is there help?) heroes of the wind (is there help?) heroes of the earth, water and fire is there help? (is there help?). Take our foes let them dying deep, we who worship thee back to home sleep, we'll fall like stone as they sails away, grant us the rejoicing at the end of the day, O hear our cry to sacrifice, within every cry you might see the, hear the heroes of the down (is there help?) heroes of the wind (is there help?) heroes of the earth, water and fire is there help? (is there help?). Strike for your children strike for love and wife, strike for the holy land that kindly gave you life, we live in power, power of man, and power overall is far beyond their ken. O hear our cry to sacrifice within every cry you might see the, hear the heroes of the down (is there help?) heroes of the wind (is there help?) heroes of the earth, water and fire is there help? (is there help?).
