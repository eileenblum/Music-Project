[Dark Avenger]
- A hundred knights gathers around and show themselves arrogant and proud; the sword lies stuck in a stone in vain they try to win the throne; as if it was begotten by night arises a boy to claim his right; is it a part of a secret plan? or Merlin's trick while he yet can?

[???]
- With the mighty sword held high, a new born king of Celt and Briton people, rejoice through the land the peace and the hope as child on mother's nipple; a new young blood to face the forth coming foe 'gainst all evil and tyranny, swore unite the both people and thus respect their faith, no matter if Celt or Brittany.

[The Lady of the Lake]
You climb high for miracles think you cry in vain the answer comes across the heavens a sword of justice and pain it comes to you in stormy weather a name lost in dust of time beyond the depths of the lake I bring Caladvwch to you 

[King Arthur]
Since the sword brought us together we've been fighting for the throne let us pray to the heavens before the bastard plague comes Come! Like a damn dog! and taste the steel of my blade don't be afraid to be dead 'cos our lives ends in a dream our quest will live forever who will win we never know with Excalibur held high there's no return, to the evil one 'till the final act now they show no sign of mercy the army of black breaks the walls Knights of Round Table stand against the evil on my own strong! all together our faith lives endlessly this quest means that our foe killed the Great White Deer our quest must live forever to Camelot our blood with Excalibur held high there's no return to the evil one 'till the final act our quest must live forever to Camelot our blood with Excalibur held high there's no return to the evil one we'll never gonna stop I said never never! 

[The Lady of the Lake]
If you're searching for the meaning of faith you'll find it in those last few words.
