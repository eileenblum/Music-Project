[Dark Avenger]
- The young king is in love to a christian devoted queen, in craving prayers she bode the conversion of the King; she begs in copious weeping bonded hands and bent knees, her lips whisper the prayers but I can't hear what it means.

- "Above the lake's waters, above the steel of a sword, above the earthly winds, above the fire above; stands a power supreme that all created in world; swear beloved husband, by this cross not by thy sword!"

[King Arthur to Gwenhwyfar]
