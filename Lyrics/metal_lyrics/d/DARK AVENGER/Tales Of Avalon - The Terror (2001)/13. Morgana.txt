[Dark Avenger]
- Who is that girl in robe so white knelt in the shore along the lake? she waves her body slowly upright cries to the skies defiant and brave; conjuring with blood the four elements she struggles against the sorrow within; the old ways shall bring the punishment, with death and fire and dark sorcery?

[???]
- A naive maid in the mists of the isle, replaces in pain the Lady in her doom and summons Caeridien with a sad smile and gives the seed inside her womb; the christian king his back on her turns, and left the Lady to be killed and burned; with weapons of fate far beyond her ken the maid will fight not with weapons of men 

[Morgana]
Great thunder touch my hands, mighty evil on dark wings come touch my hands, tonight, tonight I'll do my sorcery. Milady with all your wrath touch my hands, spiritual waters with spiritless souls, come and touch my hands, tonight, tonight I'll do my sorcery. We'll impale the Christians in their crosses we will drink their blood, no sign of God you'll burn on the realms of bellow; tonight wicked curse descending, tonight see the Briton Dragon bleeding, the dare they will pay with their souls, the pain for unfolding the unknown. I summon the gods of the forest and devils of the night no time to cry balance upon the blade high tonight wicked curse descending tonight see the Briton Dragon bleeding the dare they will pay with their souls the pain for unfolding the unknown I will do my sorcery tonight wicked curse descending tonight see the Briton Dragon bleeding the dare they will pay with their souls the pain for unfolding the unknown spell my name you damn Morgana.
