[Dark Avenger]
- Here I am at the top of this hill, down in the valley clear is the view; dead bodies until the earth meets the sky, look at me with their lifeless eyes. May I ask thee Milady, if in my duties dare, why the sea of sorrow, why my Lady of Death? 

[LadyDeath]
- Look beside thee, see the shadow of someone, who in old dayes lived this tragedy once. Will lead thy path through this story; thou must go forth for thou shalt live, how it all begun, for only the end is what thou now see.

[Dark Avenger]
- The mist of time embraces my body and soul, suddenly a hand in my hand tell me to go; somebody's eyes invades my empty brain; I realize I'm living somebody's pain.
