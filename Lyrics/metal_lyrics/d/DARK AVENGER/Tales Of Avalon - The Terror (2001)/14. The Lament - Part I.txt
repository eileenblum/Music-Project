[Dark Avenger]
- Is it how things happened? Is this all the end? Are there only sorrow, despair and the pain?

[???]
- Hush! Dark Avenger, don't hurry my tale, the upcoming events will make you grow pale; there shall be blue serpents wrapped in a betrayal and a bastard child bringing forth much wail; there shall be much blood when the stug will fail and a long blind quest for a lost holy grail; there shall be a return where the sadness prevail and a hard judgement in a heart with a wale; there shall be much war many corpses in a vale; Hush dear Dark Avenger, don't hurry my tale!
