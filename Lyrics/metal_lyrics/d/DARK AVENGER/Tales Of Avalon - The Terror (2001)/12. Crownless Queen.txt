[Dark Avenger]
- The wind in the leaves echoes a chant of sorrow and pain, the trees in the wood in woe they cry for their Lady was slain, why does he shed the blood of such important Dame, he knows the weight of his deed or he just went insane?

- Misusing the sacred objects blessed in the old ways, the King dubbed his knights with Caladvwch in a wrong way; Pendragon betrayed the kells, the kells he did disclaim, someone needed to tell him the Christ could kill the Fay, that one they used call mother, she went off in a fatal faint.

Armageddon judgement day has come! 

[Sir Balin]
Listeneth Lordingres this is our day, the day we've killed the whore; my axe smites the England's rest it cuts the air and roars; no crafty spells no damnation by dauntless hands I shield the nation; the hag's days are gone if it's for doing I've done! I will rise my fate with the axe of hate! and when the day has come, for you to face the truth, I'll drive my craving axe on you! Hail Pendragon Lord of the realm, Christ shall arm thee today, hell is confounded back from holly England, I see as they cower away, beyond this hell lies the salvation, no heathen hangs on our destination, the hag's days are gone if it's for doing I've done! I will rise my fate with the axe of hate! and when the day has come, for you to face the truth, I'll drive my craving axe on you! The forest cry I'm devil's son for I have ceased her heathendom, and all witchery of the hag; forgive me Christ for I have sinned, stains of blood within my being but I don't feel the stain of the blade, 'cos she deserved, Lord she deserved, to die in blood, squirm in gore, her smashed head in my hungry hands, on marble's floor so white so clear now lies a corpse in death no fear, she knew that she was coming to die!!!

[The Wood]
Armageddon judgement day has come!
