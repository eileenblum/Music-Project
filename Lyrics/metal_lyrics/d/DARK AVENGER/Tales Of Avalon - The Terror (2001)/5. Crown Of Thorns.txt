[Dark Avenger]
- With the roman naves disembarked a rape, a risen shadow in wooden shaped, the Littles' fall on bent knees, was not the worse war injury?

[???]
- There were a pack of roman priests, to heathen faith they rose the fists, with lies and tricks worship a cross, imposing them some serious loss. Pendragon King they used to hoax, with groaning greed spoiling folks, with moaning chants rosary in hand, the Little ones ask 'till when they'll stand.

[The Roman Priests]
[Personifying Christ's last moments]
Lacerating pain sticking down into my wounded skull it hurts I raise my eyes to the sky to see the Lord but they seem so turbid by the red blood of thorns Eli, Eli why did you leave me so alone here in this cross? Upon my head I feel the heft of all their sins I've tasted the whip of their hatred on my back My arms are open wide my bones were broken down and here upon my head lies a crown of thorns I tried to make them see their eyes so blind guide them right into the hell words ain't enough to show the truth the Pharisees ask for my blood to bath the cross in the name of God see, see the end is so near there will be no more return you've thrown the dice, you've played the game satan has won you've lost your souls to whoredom My arms are open wide my bones were broken down and here upon my head lies a crown of thorns Judica me Domine et discerne causam meam de gente non sancta ab homine iniquo et doloso erue me Quia tu es, Deus, fortitudo mea quare me repullisti, et quare tristis incedo dum affligit me inimicus? There's enough promiscuity many promises were broken they've violated thy holy name before the dark altar of satan God don't allow the heathens stain thy holy name thy holy church must prevail with pain and hate whatever it takes I swear o Lord I'll be thy hand who's gonna save their lost souls see my struggle within my heart I will prevail, I must not die grant me wash their souls away into the blood of their sins the time is short and running low satan lives like yesterday! My arms are open wide my bones were broken down and here upon my head lies a crown of thorns a crown of thorns crown of thorns.
