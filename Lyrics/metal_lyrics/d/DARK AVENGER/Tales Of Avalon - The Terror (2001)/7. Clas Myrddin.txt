[Dark Avenger]
- Lo dear voyager in which hands my fate now trips, ease thy eager feet before my mood sees red, and tell about the wizard whose wondrous grip handled, the alchemy, the magic, the quick and the dead

[???]
- The first time the Wizard I was told, a fatherless born who lived alone, was going to die by tyrant command, to save with blood the collapsing land, with crafty waves and smart enchantments, slipped away from embarrassments, traced the trail for a new young king, no matter the blame for all his sins, wanted to gather in a unique sentence, the lamb in the cross and the blue serpents, will he be succeed, will he find the path? But surely will pay the aftermath.

[Merlim]
Night roaming creatures bless my path as I walk through the shadows alone some they may call me a fatherless born some mocking me down but some them soliciting me in the nightime late at nightime know the soul of things has been my quest arrow shaped a snake at the dark transmutating my heartbeat through the night I worship thee Sovereign of the sky magic power sign and song o Inspirer, Thou of life hope and joy marble walls shelter this airy tower stands supreme in the mysteries of power built by hands of a friend and a king who leads the battle onto the final cut I worship thee Sovereign of the sky magic power, sign and song o Inspirer, Thou of live hope and joy I worship thee Sovereign of the sky magic power sign and song o Inspirer, Thou of live hear my cry as I rise bless the boy with the sword bless the realm with your peace hope and joy!
