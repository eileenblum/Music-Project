[Leonel Valdez/Mario Linhares]

Little angel come with me
Close your eyes and hold my hand
Try ignoring any noise you hear
It's the sound of the end 
that's coming

See the light in heaven
It's the war that starts to rage
Here the site of Armageddon
In this day... pain and anger.

I'll protect you in this trip
Mikhael is my name
I'll kill anyone who nears
My sword is blessed with fire
And hatred!

See the light in heaven
It's the war that starts to rage
And the army of hell is avenging
In this place Armageddon

'Cmon get up
it's the time to wear metals and spikes
drink the blood of battle and kill
or die in fields of Armageddon
hey guys join us
Choose your side in the battle
And strike
Crush the heads of these fucking bastards
In the end we'll play
Heavy Metal

See the light in heaven
It's the war that starts to rage
And the army of hell is avenging
In this place Armageddon
