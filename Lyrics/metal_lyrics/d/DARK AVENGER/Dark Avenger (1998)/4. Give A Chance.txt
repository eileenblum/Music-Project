[Leonel Valdez/Osiris Di Castro/Mario Linhares]

I hope you hear my cry
Because I've been calling you before
I just want your voice on phone

I think where can you be
If you know what I am feeling
Girl give me just one more chance

O baby I need to be the one...
Who has those lips to kiss?

A cold invades my soul 
And I wonder you're so far
Darling come and heat my heart

For many thousand roads
I will ride to be with you
Just to be the best for you

O baby tell me I ain't wrong
Who has your body to touch now?

Open your eyes to me
Open your heart to love
Give a chance for we both
Open your mind to me
Open your hands to hope
Give a chance for our love
