[Bonus track]

[Mario Linhares/Leonel Valdez/Rafael Galvao]

Great thunder touch my hands
Mighty evil on dark wings
Come and touch my hands

Tonight, tonight, I'll do my sorcery

Milady, with all your wrath, touch my hands
Spiritual waters, with spiritless souls
come and touch my hands

Tonight, tonight, I'll do my sorcery

We'll impale the Christians in their crosses
We will drink their blood
No sign of thy God, 
You'll burn on the realms of bellow

Tonight, wicked curse descending
Tonight, see the Briton Dragon bleeding
The dare they will pay with their souls
The pain for unfolding the unknown

I summon the gods of the forest and devils of the night 
No time to cry, balance upon the blade high

Tonight, wicked curse descending
Tonight, see the Briton Dragon bleeding
The dare they will pay with their souls
The pain for unfolding the unknown

I will do my sorcery

Tonight, wicked curse descending
Tonight, see the Briton Dragon bleeding
The dare they will pay with their souls
The pain for unfolding the unknown

Spell my name you damn

Morgana.
