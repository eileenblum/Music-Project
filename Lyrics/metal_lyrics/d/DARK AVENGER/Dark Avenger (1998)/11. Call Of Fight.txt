[Osiris Di Castro/Leonel Valdez/Mario Linhares]

Hear the drums, trumpets and fifes
The sound emanated advice us it's time
Our swords and our shields are urging for blood
And our enemies will scream in their gore

We are guided by thy hands, victory lies ahead
Blood will pay our deeds
Tonight we'll celebrate

We don't know what's wrong, what's right
We keep on obeying the calling of fight
These bodies on fields are carpets for us
And they encourages us to keep up the strike

We'll never stop 'till the last man is dead
And their widow's wail sounds as a lullaby tone
Because all this havoc just make us delight
And the screams of wimps just make us strong

We are guided by thy hands, victory lies ahead
Blood will pay our deeds
Tonight we'll celebrate

In the dark we march breathless
The future will teach you we are fearless
Your blame is to die a horrible death
And we'll take charge to put it in path

We'll never stop 'till the last man is dead
And their widow's wail sounds as a lullaby tone
Because all this havoc just make us delight
And the screams of wimps just make us strong
