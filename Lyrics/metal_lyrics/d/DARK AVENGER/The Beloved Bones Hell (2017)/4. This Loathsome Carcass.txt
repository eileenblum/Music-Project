[EMOTION:]
Unfold this lost soul.
Loathsome and ghastly I roam into mud

[REASON:]
This carcass so gnarly keeps moaning its ash!

[EMOTION:]
Ah!

[REASON:]
Look at you paltry thing!
Battered up you're dimmed and wasted.
Stripped of your dignity.
Standing in a line, screaming, "I'm alive!"
Helping hand still waiting.

[EMOTION:]
Am I the master of my life? The captain of my soul?
Speak to me, speak to me!
Is this vision the reality of what I've become?

All my life, I have built castles on the sands, but sands can't be hold onto the grasp of hands.

All my life, I have built my hopes in the air, but the ruthless wisdom of the wind, relentless, wipes hopes and dreams away!

[REASON:]
You're a complete waste of existence, worthless vessel for a soul, obnoxious behavior creature; uncertain deranged future, obtuse from head to toe.

[EMOTION:]
Am I the master of my life? The captain of my soul?
Speak to me, speak to me!
Is this vision the reality of what I've become?

What I've become? What I've become?

All my life, I have built castles on the sands, but sands can't be hold onto the grasp of hands.

All my life, I have built my hopes in the air, but the ruthless wisdom of the wind, relentless, wipes hopes and dreams away!
