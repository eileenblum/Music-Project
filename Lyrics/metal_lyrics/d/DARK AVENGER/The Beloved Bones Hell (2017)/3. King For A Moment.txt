[REASON:]
There's no turning back to where once you called Heaven
There's no turning back to where once you called Home
There's no turning back to where once you called Heaven

[EMOTION:]
Heaven, Heaven!

[REASON:]
There's no turning back to where once you called Home!

For how long have you craved to the Heaven? For how long have you prayed to a God? Any of them ever yearned on your misery? Any of them ever reached out for you?

No, there will be no Heaven! No, there will be no God!

Come, I defy you; I command you, come and cross! Come, without anchors, without pain! No more! Come! Leave the sorrow, leave the pain, ashore! Sail! Onward, sail! Be yourself your compass!!!

The compass in your needs

[EMOTION:]
To my needs

[REASON:]
The compass in your grief
The compass to lead your quest

[EMOTION:]
Where's the Preacher? Where is God with his Holy Scripture?

[REASON:]
Can't you see? There will be no more God!

[EMOTION:]
If there'll be no more Godâ¦ no Preachers of beforeâ¦ won't you show me the way?

[REASON:]
Come, I defy you; I command you, come and cross! Come, without anchors, without pain! No more! Come! Leave the sorrow; leave the pain, ashore! Sail! Onward, sail! Be yourself your compass!!!

[REASON:]
There's no turning back to where once you called Heaven
There's no turning back to where once you called Home
There's no turning back to where once you called Heaven

[EMOTION:]
Heaven, Heaven

[REASON:]
There's no turning back to where once you called Home.
There's no turning back!
