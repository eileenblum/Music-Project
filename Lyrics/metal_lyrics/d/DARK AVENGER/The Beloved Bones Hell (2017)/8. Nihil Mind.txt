[EMOTION:]
I remember when I started not listening to you; I just can't recall a point through the years. I remember when I started to doubt the dream would come true; I remember. I remember when I started not wishing you so near; this came along through sleepless nights. I remember when I decided not live in fear.

I was waiting to unlock this door and see your face as knew before, instead I feared you; I've cried for you and because of you; I don't wanna take this anymore.

[REASON:]
Nihil mind! Nihil mind!

[EMOTION:]
My will it's over! All hope is gone!
Just take this cup away from my... Nihil mind!

[EMOTION:]
I remember well the love once was unbreakable started to crack up overnight. I remember well the end once was unthinkable; now so real. I remember wellâ¦ lack of words came to prevail and I spoke 'bout my loneliness; I remember wellâ¦ no more touch, no more caress.

I was waiting to unlock this door and see your face as knew before, instead I feared you; I've cried for you and because of you; I don't wanna take this anymore.

[REASON:]
Nihil mind! Nihil mind!

[EMOTION:]
My will it's over! All hope is gone!
Just take this cup away from my... Nihil mind!

"Fine!" your voice still echoes inside.
You've gone and left no further things, behind;
But lack of love and faith, and sadness in between
Take it away!

Nihil mind! Nihil mind!

[REASON:]
My will it's over!
All hope is gone! Just take this cup at all...

[BOTH:]
Nihil mind.
