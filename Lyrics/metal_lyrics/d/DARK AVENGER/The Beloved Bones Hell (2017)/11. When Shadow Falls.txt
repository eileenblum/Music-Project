[THE I:]
Winter's taken the final leaves
Autumn bygone, no tears my dear
Flickering candle weathers the wind
That blows from the shadow

Hidden movements still unseen
Thickens the air surrounding me
Anticipating the rise of the dusk
That lurks on in the shadow

No prayer by candlelight, no tears tonight
By this time I'll be waiting for you.
When shadow falls!

There's a silence that haunts me
A cold breeze freezes me
A warm hand touches my hair
It comes from the shadow

As mist changing its silhouette
She seems to guess my weaknesses
Walking to me, calling me
My beloved one comes from the shadow

Take me away, I've got nothing to waste
Just take me away, it's so hard accepting this fate

Take me away, I've got nothing to waste
Just take me away; I'll be looking for you
When shadow falls

No prayer by candlelight, no tears tonight
By this time, I'll be waiting for you. When shadow falls!

Take me away, I've got nothing to waste
Just take me away, it's so hard accepting this fate

Take me away, I've got nothing to waste
Just take me away; I'll be looking for you
When shadow falls
