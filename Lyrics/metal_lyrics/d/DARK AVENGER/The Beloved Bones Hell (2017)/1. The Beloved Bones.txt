[REASON:]
I, the Master of Nothingness.
I, the ruler of the void, time and space before Life itself is.
Yes I, Beholder of Everything.
I've come to see that the prettiest thing ever made came undone!

Outcast from Heaven! Back to the primordial clay.
I sing the vision of your decay!

It's my underworld. Lay on me your tired carcass, here in my underworld. In my wonder world nothing remains! In this dark side of Heaven nothing remains!

None of man's Gods house the sinner. I welcome, embrace and accept you. Knowing your vices and you are one, from guile 'til bile's bitterness. Slavish you dance as I pull the strings; in my hands your numbered days. Come to me because to be no more is indeed, no sad end at all.

Outcast from Heaven! Back to the primordial clay.
I sing the vision of your decay!

It's my underworld. Lay on me your tired carcass, here in my underworld. In my wonder world nothing remains! In this dark side of Heaven nothing remains!

Oh, welcome to my underworld. This place was made for me and you. Together we're going under!

It's my underworld. Lay on me your tired carcass, here in my underworld. In my wonder world nothing remains! In this dark side of Heaven nothing remains!

[EMOTION:]
"In visions in the dark night, I have dreamed of joy departed.
A waking dream of light, a waking dream of life!"
