[REASON:]
Three, three times a fool, denier!

[EMOTION:]
Three times a rambling fool?

[REASON:]
Three times you have failed me, betrayed and lied.
On you my only expectation was: Awareness and no denial.

'Cause if I smile at you, don't turn your back on me! Smile back at me! You know I'm just right here and I will always be!

[EMOTION:]
Three times a rambling fool?

[REASON:]
Truth is a shadow that glows despite the dark and looms engulfing the uncertainty the closer we are to the light.

And now I talk to youâ¦

[EMOTION:]
Lies! Lies!

[REASON:]
Don't turn your back to me! You gotta take on me! You know I'm just right here and I will always... beâ¦ here! Be... I'll always... be... here! I'll always be... always be here!

Oh Yeah! Truth is a shadow that glows despite the dark. And looms engulfing the uncertainty the closer we are to the light.

[EMOTION:]
"Three times a rambling fool. Three times a rambling fool"

[REASON:]
There's no turning back to where once you called Heaven, oh no. There's no turning back to where once you called Heaven, or home. There's no turning back to where once you called Heaven, oh no. There's no turning back to where once you called Heaven, or home,

So, if I smile, smile back to me. Come to my arms and I set you free!
