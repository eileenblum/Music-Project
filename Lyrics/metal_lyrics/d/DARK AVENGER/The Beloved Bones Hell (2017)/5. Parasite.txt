While some "friends" want your gold
I keep searching truth
Someone who can at least
Keep the word!

[EMOTION:]
So cold, inimical; I feel the shadows over me. Shining eyes,
blackened, darkened. A beast in disguise lies within

[REASON:]
While some "friends" want your gold, I keep searching truth
Someone who can at least... Keep the word!
Unreservedly naive and trustfully... long gone for good!
When it comes a time, One must realize and leave the past behind

I know parasite got a heart
Won't you leave me alone?

[REASON:]
I knowâ¦ Parasite got a heart

[EMOTION:]
Won't you leave me alone?
As if all your life you had been led by the hand like a small child and suddenly left aloneâ¦ Liar!

Innocent loves justice, wicked prefer mercy,
Obsequious attendance you'll never see in me

[EMOTION:]
Innocent loves justice; wicked prefer mercy,
Obsequious attendance you'll never see in me
Instead the golden lies you serve in golden smile
The rats are now my fellows; a cleaner company

[REASON:]
Bastard! You douchebag of lies
Spitter of helping hand, I hope you die!

[EMOTION:]
Liar!

[REASON:]
As words have been spoken, I now take my leave
When it comes a time one must realize and leave the past behind,

[EMOTION:]
Parasite!

[REASON:]
I knowâ¦ Parasite got a heart

[EMOTION:]
Won't you leave me alone?

[REASON:]
Demanus!


I know parasite got a heart
Won't you leave me alone?
