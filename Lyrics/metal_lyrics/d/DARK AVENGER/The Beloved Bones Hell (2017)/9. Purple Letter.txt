[EMOTION:]
Am I a dead man walking? Is this my final door?
How come I've reached a point of no return?
Last thing I recall was your face... This purple letter.

[REASON:]
This time around, you're free to leave.
No hefty anchors, no bars at all.

[EMOTION:]
Am I prepared to leave? How do I know the time is right?
Why do I beg so hard for salvation? Isn't it little awkward thing?
I mean, knowing when and how;
Now I've started to love my old life. Will I remember you? And the little precious things of life
If we ever meet again in the afterlife?

[REASON:]
Yes, you are lifeâ¦ for a while...
And life itself it's a "while", while I'm away!

[EMOTION:]
And all mistakes I did and never had a chance to apologize...
Is it too late to ask for redemption?
Is it true we carry the guilt of our deeds while we're alive?
It's so unfair this parting burden

Where's the Savior? There'll never be?
Alone in this worldâ¦ That's how I'll leave?

[REASON:]
Humâ¦ where is the Savior? No! There'll never be!
Alone in this worldâ¦! That's how you'll leave!

"Good day Mr. Mortal, I come very respectfully
To bring you this letter, your life is about to decease"

[EMOTION:]
I must say goodbye, it's time to leave
The curtains fall for you and me
I bid you farewell... this got to be!
We'll meet again? It's hard to foresee.
But until then... remember me!
Remember meâ¦ remember me!

[REASON:]
The song is over... Well, nothing lasts forever
It's time to leave... The road is longâ¦
For you and me!
