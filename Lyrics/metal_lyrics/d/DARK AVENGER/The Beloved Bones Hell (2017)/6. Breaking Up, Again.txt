[EMOTION:]
I'm a heroâ¦
In flesh and bones for surviving life's endeavors on my own.
I'm a heroâ¦ I've got a soul!
Life is mine to live without your preaching grunts.

[REASON:]
You're not a heroâ¦ far from being so.
You are just a lie with a soul, flesh and bones
You're not a heroâ¦ a ghost in this pantomime
You were made to fail and crawl, crawl like a worm!

[EMOTION:]
Give me your endless love.
Keep me away from harm, quite safe and warm
I never asked to be born here, I've never knew why
That's your duty onto me 'til the end of time

[REASON:]
You pretend that only other people
Carry burdens and you never will

[EMOTION:]
Listen... Give me. Feed me. Keep me.

[REASON:]
Is it all you can... say?

[EMOTION:]
Give me your utter love;
Those begging hands you can't ignore!
I never asked to be born here, I've never knew why
That's your duty onto me 'til the end of time

[REASON:]
You pretend that only other people
Carry burdens and you never will

[EMOTION:]
Listen... Give me. Feed me. Keep me.
[REASON:]
Is it all you can... say?
Pretender, pretender, pretender!

[EMOTION:]
I'm a hero!
[REASON:]
No, you're not at all! A ghost in this pantomime!

[EMOTION:]
I'm a hero!
[REASON:]
Liar, liar! No, nothing but a shade...
Is it all you can... say?
