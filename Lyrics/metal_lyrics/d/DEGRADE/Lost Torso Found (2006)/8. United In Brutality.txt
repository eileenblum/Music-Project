From around, the world we gather for the fests of sickening death
A true, display of brutality. is what we seek for, death and gore
Survive, in the circle of death, and utter violence,
Sewage neck breaking beats

United In Brutality

We open the valve
And let the gore flow
Making you retch
Craving for more

Gulp, some booze, fuck you up

Never weak, always sick, turning heads, broken limbs

Audial torture to some
Soothing therapy to others
