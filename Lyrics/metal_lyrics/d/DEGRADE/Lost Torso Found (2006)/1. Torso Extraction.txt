Voices in my head told me to do it this way
My work with this was rough
So fucking ugly and this meat were tougher than thought
Arms and legs removed with saw
Prostheses and bones, the saw began to get dull
Head are smashed off with a maul

Cranium bolied to separate
The skin from bone
Trophy from the newly dead
On display

Torso extracted and semen ejected with pride

Discarding the limbs keeping the torso
This will be kept untill maggots flourish
Putrid reek of decomposing flesh

Fingers, caress, molest, the fucking torso

Discarding the limbs keeping the torso
This will be kept untill maggots flourish
Putrid reek of decomposing flesh
Inhale the scent of death

But now
I need something new
Fuck it
Only bones are left
Come here
Little twat
Be my fucking torso toy
