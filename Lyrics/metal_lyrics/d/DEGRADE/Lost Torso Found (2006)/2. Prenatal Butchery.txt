Adbominal pains awaken her
Unborn butcher, spawn of gore, fetus of wrath
In his mother's womb, raising hell
Maternal innocensce, victim of rape
Paternal insanity, molestation was his game
Internal carnage, maternal suffering

Flashes from the past haunt her psyche
Tearing, chewing, ripping, kicking
Ambilical cord filled with pus, fed with hate

Maternal innocensce, victim of rape
Adbominal pains awaken her
Spawn of gore, fetus of wrath

This unborn maniac, creation of insanity
Respects no life, embracement of death killing for joy
Sick thoughts passed on through generations
Molesting's their game
This prenatal butchery surpasses her thoughts

Slaughtered from within was her cruel fate
There she lay abdomen torn apart, disemboweled from within
Beside her, he lay
Slaughtered from within was her cruel fate
There she lay, abdomen torn apart, disembowelled from within
Spawn of gore
