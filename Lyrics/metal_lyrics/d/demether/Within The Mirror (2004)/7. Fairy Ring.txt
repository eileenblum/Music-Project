[text: M. Mandic; music: D. Deuric]

Boy is in his bed
Lying, not sleeping
Listening to the stories of the old:
"They make your blood boil
He who goes into the forest after nightfall
Will not live to see the morning sun"

One girl is on his mind
Before his eyes in dreams
Always in the white,
Daisies in her hair
Never leaving him

They will take your body
They will take your soul
Make you dance
Make you dance all night long...

He saw her one day
On his way home
She was dancing, not walking
Turned into the woods
Not wanting to loose her

"He entered the forest
as the sun was setting down
Without a fear, but with love,
Enchanted with her eyes
His heart is still,
His soul peaceful,
Body covered in daisies..."

"They will take your body
They will take your soul
Make you dance
Make you dance all night long... Small price for a dance
with the fairies..."
