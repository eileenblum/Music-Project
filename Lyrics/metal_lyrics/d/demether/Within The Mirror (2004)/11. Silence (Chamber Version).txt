[Bonus track]

[text &amp; music: D. Deuric]

Cold...winter, ice and snow
Sound...weeping wind that blows
Me...standing on the sacred ground

Night...at the ancient graveyard
Soul...looking for a saviour
Eyes...searching for a girl from a distant time

I don't even know her name
But her silence`s tearing me apart
Petals of her flower blowen
Are lying underneath the grass

And she past away so young
Under veil of secrets long ago
Like a snowflake on the palm
Her life was autumn leaf that falls
