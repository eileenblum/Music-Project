[text: D. Deuric; music: D. Deuric]

Thee, who walk the eagle's path
This is your final task
See the water, clearest lake
There she dwells, for brave awaits

Far away, far away
Deep within the mirror that's her world
In the night, be afraid
Many travelers left their bones right here

You will find the ring in the lake
Dive and quest your own will and strength to
Fight against the voice of Laewen,
Maiden, keeper of the souls

The child of the Sun,
The bride of the Moon,
She will take your
Breath soon...
