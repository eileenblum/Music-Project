[text &amp; music: D. Deuric]

Whisper with the waves
Never to be found
Separated from the stars

Crimson dyed sky
With its endless love
Calling me...

Diving through the ocean`s cold
Darkness covering my soul
In this silence of my own
Water tomb, my ever home

Poetic spell
Thee unveiled
And drowned of demons
Bare for sacrifice
Bare for sacrifice...

Diving through the ocean`s cold
Darkness covering my soul
In this silence of my own
Water tomb, my ever home

Poetic spell...
