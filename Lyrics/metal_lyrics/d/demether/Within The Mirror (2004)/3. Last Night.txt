[text: M. Mandic; music: D. Deuric]

Tears run down my face
I don't want to leave you
Is there a hope that I'll be back?

But Odin calls me
From the highest mountain
Battle echo in my mind

Silent winter night
Your heartbeat breaks the silence
The dawn is coming fast

I wanna hold you tonight
Let me in your sacred lane
Battle rages, wait for me
At the dawn I`ll be away...

Hold me in your arms tonight
Tomorrow is the day
When Gods will decide
Will you come back or you will stay...

Oh, no... please don`t go
I saw it in my dreams
The weather will turn to storm

Saga of our life,
that`s spoken in the time
Maybe this is the last rhyme...
