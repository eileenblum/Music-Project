[text: M. Mandic / D. Deuric; music: D. Deuric]

After three winters of ice and cold
Two wolves from the North came to bring the fear
The One ate the moon
The other swallowed the sun
Screaming I hear...

The day of the last battle has come
Loosed Naglfar reached the land
And giants came
To the greatest plain on the Earth
Bifrost will fall...

The day has come
One day, one fight
For all the land
And for the last time
The battlefield will quest the brave
And the world will end on this day

But there they saw last stand of a man,
Mightiest army ever seen,
Every brave man failed ever on battlefield
Valhalla is there...
