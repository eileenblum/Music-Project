Tucked away, they've been dancing through time,
Played their games, sang their songs..

Growing up in their frail and secret world,
Hide and seek in the garden full of dreams

Lilies of the valley in the sun
Sour taste of cherries as they, barefoot, run...

Two roses they were called,
plain and simple, never flawed.
Two roses, Lowland's pride.
Now they sleep, side by side.

Wind from the north, he's a soldier. He won't cry.
With the sound of bell, wind will sing a lullaby

Tell me, please, where do all the white roses go?
Could sands of time be slowed down?
They could live.. They should live to see

Their own children playing in the yard,
while the winter paints silver stars on the glass..
