Cloud of pollution is preventing our eyes to see
What's in the future and how are we meant to be...
Hey, people, you're sleeping awake,
Stop dreaming, it's for your own sake.

We took the Earth for granted, and lived by our own advice.
If this is the body, we're acting like parasites.
This is the last call, child of today,
The water is rising high...

[Chorus:]
Weeping on the rivers of Babylon,
Clusters of clouds will embrace the Sun,
Lightnings are writing the history of mankind...

Sinful towers reached the sky,
Merging networks weaving web of lies,
Hey, people, you're sleeping awake,
The water is rising high...
