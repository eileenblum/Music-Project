If you try to follow her footsteps,
You will find that she doesn't leave a single one...
Sheâs so light,
As the sound of
Her sister Syrinxâs flute...

Tapping with the leaves and dancing, she flirts with the wind,
and then her song sounds like piccolo...

Is innocent the rain that`s falling on her face,
Washing little sins of summer,
Where water-fairy runs, when summer danceâs done,
Where will she hide?

When the nature sings the swan song
And the autumn gives the final cut,
Like a painter, with her sorrow
She fades all colours to gray...
