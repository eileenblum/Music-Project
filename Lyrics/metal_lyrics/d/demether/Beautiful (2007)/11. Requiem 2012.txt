She saw a raven spread its wings,
Without the strength to fly awayâ¦
How could she know that this was its cry:
âDon`t start your journey now.â

Canonic chant and silent lament,
Candles are burning, timeâs passing byâ¦
Who will first go beyond the light
Time will tell, but the choir will still singâ¦

Requiem Aeternam dona eis, Domine
Ex audi, ex audi orationem meam

The last thing she saw were the red flowers by the road.
She smiled and said: âWhat a beautiful day...â
Then the angels took her away...

Voca me, cum benedictis
Voca meâ¦
