Just like oil on canvassâ¦
Touch of red, mostly blackâ¦
Thick are the air and the fog that hide her from youâ¦

Weepsâ¦ shadowâ¦
Cries â¦ sparkleâ¦
âShe sleeps, she sleepsâ¦â

Once in time, there she was,
Standing by the willow tree,
Longing for an old feeling, being hisâ¦

Now she is like a torn flower,
Aloneâ¦

Among the trees, and underneath the leaves,
There is her last home, she lies there all aloneâ¦
