Hush... Strings are weeping silently...
Like... They are singing a lullaby...
This... Plain without a single tree
Will open to take a child...
Her embrace was not enough
To save his soul... All alone...

And she came with the swan song on her lips...
Evening breeze was listening...
âLacrimosaâ, she said: âCry upon my fate...â
âLacrimosaâ

DoÅ¡la je sestra Jelena,
Dovela brata ranjena,
Da traÅ¾i s mora doktora,
Bratu rane da vida.

Boga ti, s mora doktore,
Å ta ti se Äini od rana?
Boga mi, sestro Jeleno,
Pripremi bratu Å¡to nemaÅ¡
