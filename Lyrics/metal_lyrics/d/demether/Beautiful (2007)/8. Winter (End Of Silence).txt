Signs around, but Iâm blind,
Blur and hazeâ¦
Deaf, still out of tune,
Wandering with my own fearsâ¦

Phrases, my shallow grave,
Written in sand, not in stoneâ¦
Darkness of your mind almost
Swallowed my soulâ¦

Leave now, donât turn back,
All the pictures are tornâ¦
This winter will find you aloneâ¦ And coldâ¦

Leave me, Lilith,
There is blood on your hands,
Your laments are untrue,
Your flowers never bloomâ¦

Iâd rather let them die
Or tear the September sky,
Then rain would fall forever
And wash your mask awayâ¦
