Rainâ¦I can feel the rain,
Just cold, boring autumn rain
Falling on my face, and my hands, my words, my tearsâ¦

Damn rain is taking my confidence,
and breaking my willâ¦.
So now Iâm blind and deafâ¦and coldâ¦weakâ¦
Standing in the rainâ¦

You can stop this rain thatâs falling,
You can wake the sun thatâs moaningâ¦
You can make me dead for loving,
You canâ¦ but you wonâtâ¦

Iâll stand right there in the rain, cold rainâ¦
Iâll stand in front of you, in front of them, in front of hatredâ¦
Until it stopsâ¦
Until the clusters of clouds disappear
And leave me aloneâ¦
