Since waterâs high my eyes are dry
And I donât long for anythingâ¦
My second-hand soul crashed the wall
Lying around in piecesâ¦

My nights are long and Iâm scared of the crimson dawnâ¦

Sailing on the sea of lies
Without a compassâ¦
Beneath this sky
Thereâs no seagull to show me whereâs the shoreâ¦

Ohâ¦ Iâm starving for loveâ¦

Show yourself, let me see
My reflection in your eyes
I am still lingering,
Listening to the songs of nightâ¦
Aloneâ¦

Letters never came to meâ¦
Where I am thereâs no addressâ¦
No one rides by my lair,
The birds have flown away a long time agoâ¦
