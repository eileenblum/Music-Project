When I was down, without the sun
And moonlight was my only guide,
In Lake of tears, and woods of sorrow,
Where every tree wept...

Silently in the woods of sorrow,
Heavenly, your voice: â...donât linger...â

But shade of me still wandering,
Not sacred, it came suddenly
To take my life...
Don't take your life...

Don`t linger, no, just let it go,
In hands of fate we`re all the same...
Nothing to say, just stay awake,
It`s not your time, don`t go away...
