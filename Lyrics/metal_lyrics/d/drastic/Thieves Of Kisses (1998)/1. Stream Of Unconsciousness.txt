Welcome to the stellar nightmare
Of a timeless creature...
...Welcome to my world

"I told my love I told my love
I told her all my heart"
(William Blake)

I loved you just for my pleasure
Trembling eyes of desire
Taking your deepest treasure
Your blood set me on fire

...Would you dance
With me again?

You,
My silly creature,
You were dancing
Only in your mind

Oh, your mind
Was so pure
Was so stainless,
But now...

Pensiero

Pensiero
Domini tutto
Il mio corpo
Ti adora
Vile usurpatore
D'istintiva
Saggezza...

Goddess of imagination
Goddess of one thousand suns
Why did you betray me?
Why did you betray your darling son?
