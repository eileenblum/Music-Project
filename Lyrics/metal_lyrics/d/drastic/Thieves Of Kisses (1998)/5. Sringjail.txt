"Beauty is truth, truth beauty - that is all
ye know on Earth, and all ye need to know"
[John Keats]

Leave me alone
Let me starve in sadness
Leave me alone
I'm not crying...

Leave me alone
All this world is madness
Leave me alone
I am dying...

God can take your soul
And burn it...
I can steal it
And return it - to you...

Hope now is gone
Buried in my eyes and
Thy will is done
Can't you see it?

Youth now is gone
Is there truth in beauty?
The last time I sang
You were laughing...

Nature shaped your body
And formed it...

I will waste it
And deform it - so you...

Rise, and smile, pray
Leave your dreams behind
Rise, and leave your flesh
In this world

I'll never see you again
In this mortal spoils

And the voice I worshipped?
I'll hear it no more

I'll never see you again
In this mortal spoils

The voice I worshipped?
Silence at all...

Will this spring
Last forever?

GHIACCIO SAPORE AMARO

Ghiaccio Sapore Amaro
circondarsi di creature
sotto le voci incerte
di una morte primaverile;
un letto di dolore,
fruscio avvolgente,
la terra mi accoglie.

Life will drift away
Into another place

Turning into dust
Future, present, past

Morning lights and stars
To shadows of the dark

Slaves of memories,
We're leaves of unknown trees.
