I said to my soul
Be still
And let the dark
Come upon you
I said to my soul:
Wait

I said to my soul
Be still
And wait without hope,
Wait without love,
Wait

Vacant interstellar spaces
Dark the sun and the moon

Whisper of running streams
Winter lightning, gloomy doom

Dark the sun
And the moon

Winter lightning
Gloomy doom

All I feel
Is a silent funeral,
Nobody's funeral
For there is no one to bury

All I see is a frightened face,
Nobody's face
For no one is waiting...

No one, but you...
Mighty darkness...
Just you...

Oh, mighty darkness...

I'm one with you
Because where you are
Is where you are not
