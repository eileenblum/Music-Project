I know there's a little love in you yet
I know there's a little life in us left
I know there's a little love in you yet
I know there's a little chance for us left

I should be praying but I don't want you to know
If the rain will fall like the summer rains
We've seen too many of them

We've been watching the rain
Every now and then
We've been praying for rain
But never again
