If the light that cleaned our bodies
Only would have guided our souls too
If the life we shared in between the storms
Only would have let us know

Butterflies in your belly
Love lasts forever
Your body's like jelly
Your senses come together

If only we knew
That love lasts forever
Butterflies fly free
Fly free forever

If the hope that filled us with dreams
Only would have outlasted us two
If the air that we breathed
Only hadn't let us go
