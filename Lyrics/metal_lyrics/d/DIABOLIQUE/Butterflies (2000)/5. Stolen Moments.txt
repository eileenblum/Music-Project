I've been reaching out into
Such emptiness it's hard to carry on

And so it seems, you never understood
I can never be without your soul
Cos your life pulsed through my body too

These stolen moments
Girl do you know
These stolen moments
Where are they now

Dark, dark were the days
That tore us part, that broke our hearts,
That brought these scars
Deep, deep were the nights
That made us one, when we were young,
Our love was strong

I light a fire each day
For when the cold wind blows
And you're not here (with me)

And so it seems, you never understood
I can never be without your soul
Cos your life pulsed through my body too

These stolen moments
Girl do you know
These stolen moments
Where are they now

So briefly, so easily, so cheaply
The went away
So briefly, so easily, so cheaply
They came my way
