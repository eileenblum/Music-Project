She and I were running through the parks
Beneath the clear black sky
Guided by the stars that shone to us a way

In July the heat was blue
Born into a night so new
She said "this summer my heart belongs to you"

I saw her, dark and sweet
Her presence an ecstasy
In the summer night set free

We will never be apart
In the summer of her heart

She and I were drowning in the heat
All sense of time and space
Was lost in the night of summer and fire

In July all we would do
Watch the stars burning too
She said "this summer my heart belongs to you"

I saw her dark and sweet
Her presence an ecstasy
In the summer night set free

We will never be apart
In the summer of her heart
