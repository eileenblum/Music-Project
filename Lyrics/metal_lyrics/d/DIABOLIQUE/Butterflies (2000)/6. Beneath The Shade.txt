When December blacks out I haven't wept for days
Beneath the shade I still feel your vivid textures
I know you're watching the same stars anyway
Beneath the shade I still see these glowing pictures

When I'm in your arms, I'm always so free
When we are apart, it cuts so deep
We will never clash, it's easy to see
A perfect mismatch, we'll always be

With every breath I take I'm recalling your eyes
Beneath the shade I still taste your magic kisses
Every living moment I fall with driving rains
Beneath the shade I still hear these silent wishes

Waves keep the silence and winds wail in all stillness
When days and nights get colder I'm wrapped in blankets
I always knew you don't like secrets, or darkness
The magic of your touch keeps me warm prophetess
