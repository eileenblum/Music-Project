If I should lose, lose you today
You've been drifting, drifting away

If I should lose you, lose you today
I would calmly beg you, beg you to stay

But I've been losing you, losing you today
I only wanted you to stay
But I've been losing you, losing you today
And now our love is so far away

If I should lose you, lose you today
My stars would lead me, lead me astray

But I've been losing you, losing you today
I only wanted you to stay
But I've been losing you, losing you today
And now our love is so far away
