Sometimes, somewhere, someday
Out there so far away for you
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting

3 am, a warming rain
I saw your cheeks red with springtime fires
Visualizing you all the time, again
When you were making faces in the river

You build me up when I'm torn down
I'll try to forget when I'm under ground
But you got the cure for me, the cure I need
Here it comes again, I am overwhelmed
These days are crazy, her weather is magic

Sometimes, somewhere, someday
Out t here so far away for you
I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting

3 am a warming rain
I saw you your vivid eyes and spirit glow
Visualizing you all the time, again
When you were making angels in the snow
