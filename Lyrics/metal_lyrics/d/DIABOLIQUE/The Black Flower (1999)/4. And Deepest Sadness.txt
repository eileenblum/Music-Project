Rose die with me, fruits embitter and swans drown
Summer came and passed away without a sound
But it's over now and what can I do?
Dark are the days now, all year through

Can you hear the silence
Can you feel the thorns
Can you feel the silence
Can you hear the storms

Oh you were sad then in a time long gone
Not with you I drifted off into dead zones
And you were sick back when, chasing those fears
Needed me close and still I wasn't there

Can you hear the silence
Can you feel the thorns
Can you feel the silence
Can you hear the storms

We fade away
