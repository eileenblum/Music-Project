You strangle me so gently I choke on your hold
Your beautiful hands all over my soul
I try to forget but you are so whole
Like a star of heaven you shine alone
If I could only hear yo say perhaps, my name
My world would never ever be the same
If I could only see you eyes, smell your dark chestnut hair
Until I can hardly see, I feel that you're here

You drive the needle you shoot up my soul
You drive the needle in a world of gold
You drive the needle

I'm washing away but the pain still shows
I'm hurting inside but the pain still grows
The memory of you makes my day feel old
A long time ago I was too cold
Call your coroners girl, I'd die for your smile
If need could be reasoned with emotions would die
But I see through the darkness, a light to my eyes
You are the spiritfire on an earth of ice

You drive the needle you shoot up my soul
You drive the needle in a world of gold
You drive the needle you shoot up soul
