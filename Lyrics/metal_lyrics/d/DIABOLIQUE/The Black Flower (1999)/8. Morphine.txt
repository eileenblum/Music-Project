You couldn't cut me deeper with a knife if you tried
The burden of tomorrow makes me run off and hide
You stripped me off my skin, let me know "love I come"
Glasscat lioness, now what have we done?

You and me we're in love with a lie
Morphine, morphine
You and me again that's why
Morphine, morphine

With plastic happiness comes the laughing emptiness
We've always been forgetting these magic recipes
You stripped me off my skin, let me know "love I come"
Glasscat lioness, now what have we done?

You and me we're in love with a lie
Morphine, morphine
You and me again that's why
Morphine, morphine

Putting on my oblivious helmet pretending I am dead
Trying again to sleep your words out of my head
Scratch not the surface, deep beneath the feelings lie
Reasons only reasons that can't be justified
