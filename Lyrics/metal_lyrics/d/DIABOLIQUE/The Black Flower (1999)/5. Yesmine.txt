Oh cotton girl you wind up
The sun and moon and stars
You kiss the deep night goodbye
Heal my wounds clean my scars
You infuse a deeper meaning
New colours and hues
You're my "girl on heaven hill"
God's talent put to use

All I needed, to be free
All I wanted, for us two
To hear you say the words "I do"
All I needed, to be free
All I wanted, to be with you

Yesmine, you're never mine
Yesmine, always on my mind

Oh cotton girl you draw away
Dark nights and cold lives
You take me to the boulevards
Where the rich meet to die
You exhude spiritual guidance
Blue notes for my soul
You enlight meanings hidden
With your passion and glow

All I needed, to be free
All I wanted, for us two
To hear you say the words "I do"
All I needed, to be free
All I wanted, to be with you

Yesmine, you're never mine
Yesmine, always on my mind
