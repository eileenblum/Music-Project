Cold all white science bare white slave all over
Worship fixed in circles white floor glass ceiling painted
Nails fall white essence wrinkles stitched together
Minions blind miracles white eyes stare only fainted

One last day in Rome like a white dove in hell
Falling stars, silent wishes merely broken shells

Swing low, swing low
When stitched and sewn all over
Go down, go down
White scars unseen as ever

Gone to white presence seam white sewn unover
Last rose given never white thick oily scent departed
Preach to white silence dry mouth foams just slower
Worship cold bandages white moist air rainbow coloured
