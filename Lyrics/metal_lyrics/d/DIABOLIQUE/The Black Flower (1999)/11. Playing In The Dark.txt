She is burnt so badly by the flames from her heart
Devil dancing on our souls to keep up part
For the bridges we burnt, for the dreams that died
We cry, we pray

She is burnt so badly by the flames from her heart
Devil dancing on our souls to keep up part
For the days we lost, for the times we missed
We cry, we pray

With her nothing's quite what it seems
It feels like we were part of the same dream, dream of
Deep deep love and deep deep wounds
The deeper the love the deeper the wounds

She is burnt so badly by the flames from her heart
Devil dancing on our souls to keep us part
For our song unsung, for our lives undone
We cry, we pray

With her nothing's quite what it seems
It feels like we were par of the same dream, dream of
Deep deep love and deep deep wounds
The deeper the love the deeper the wounds
