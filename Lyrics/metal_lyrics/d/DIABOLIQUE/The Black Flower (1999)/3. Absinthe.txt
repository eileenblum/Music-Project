Take this down ca 1993
Grey dusk envelops the dying stream
Failing yet holding sway
Slowly going away

Grind me down, into the ground
Down again, when I drown
I've failed again

Absinthe always this way
Absinthe my loveless angel

Shaking nervously with intenser days
The pissant drags a bloody soul away
Building beds out of flesh
Rotting time, an empty caress

Grind me down, into the ground
Down again, when I drown
I've failed again

Absinthe always this way
Absinthe my loveless angel

A long way to go when chained to the earth
Yesterday was mourning today's a brighter dirge
