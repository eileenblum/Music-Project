With her lion winter it is always spring
Hotel beds and hot windy summer mornings
We'll say yes to coming seasons, growth and change
I was chocked by the voracious springtime rain

You take away the pain

In your eyes I see eternal summer
In our world there'll be eternal summer

Hand in hand we met love in the apocalypse
Rhythmically lulled asleep she bit her lip
And said "when we made love on wedding day
did you feel this is for always, for always?"

You take away the pain

In your eyes I see eternal summer
In our world there'll be eternal summer

When the rain was over
Naked world uncovered
For once the sky was blue
And all I ever wanted was you
