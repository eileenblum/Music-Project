The rain is thrumming on
Windows soak the tears
I am so alone without her here

The rain is thrumming on
Downward-burning flame
Don't want her to know
Heaven wept again
The rain is thrumming on
Dark rivers that sear
I would want her to know
How I miss her here

I am haunted by her voice
By her eyes and by her touch
Still feeling her voracious love
Though she's gone and out of reach

Dark rivers of the heart
