An angel with coal painted feathers washed ashore
An angel that needn't be cleansed anymore

All the earth and air with out substance smeared
On days passed heaven overflowed
Now with a thousand clouds covered
In the broad white dawn
All the lights so strangely float

From rainbow fallen in the glowworm's light
Under the bodies of dew we were still
It's all so clear, like silver from gold
Once this was our will

Silver like the ebb and tide gone by
Silver the farewells and goodbyes
This is for the stillness of empty days
For the nevers... and the always

Like the sorceress in you in the light of these thoughts
We'd stay till we ran out of fears
You gave me a world of reasons to endure
And once we were here
