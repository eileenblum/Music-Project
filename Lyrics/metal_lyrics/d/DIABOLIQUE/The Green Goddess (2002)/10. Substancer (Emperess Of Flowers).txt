Do you know why our lives have grown cold
Maybe time had drawn us apart
And maybe we've been drifting apart
You're my whole world
But you've been on your way for a long time now girl

Would you kill the pain, just kill the pain
Make it beautiful again
Praise the earth that give us life
So kill the pain, just kill the pain
We could have it all again
Kiss the sun the stars the skies

Do you know if our love has burned out
What if we're afraid to let go
And what if, some dreams never let go
You're all to me
But you've been on your way for a long time baby
