My coldly dreaming world
Renew my own perspective
Unresolved, shallow and empty

And so there is my whole - altogether
And so broken my soul - forever

So take it all, take it all away
Take me out of your game
It's all the same today, anyway
So take it all, take it all away

My softly dying star
Rebuild my own desire
Unfulfilled, hollow and dire

So take it all, take it all away
Take me out of your game
It's all the same today, anyway
So take it all, take it all

If we'd love ourselves to death
If we'd draw another breath
It's all the same in the end though
Innuendo
