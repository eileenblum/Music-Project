It's not easy to wake up without you
It's not easy to wake up at all
I'm ticking like a bomb
So empty and numb
These hardened eyes
Were windows of a shell thats broken

Break it, take it bleed it dry
Steal it, shake it let it die
Heal it, save it give it life
Fear it, feel it going high

Snowblind

It's not easy to wake up still sleeping
It's not easy to wake up alone
Been sweating through the parks
So shallow and dark
These hardened eyes
Were windows of a shell that's broken
