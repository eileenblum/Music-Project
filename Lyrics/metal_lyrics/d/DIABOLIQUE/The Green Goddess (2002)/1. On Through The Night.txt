Light, this ecstatic light
There when our lives are burning with the speed of light
Rain, everfalling rain
We're running through the night to shelter from the rain

And we're raising a fire, we give it life
Just let me hold you, just one more time
Don't say you're leaving now
Stay 'till the morning light

We drift on through the night

Night, this ecstatic night
There when our hearts are beating with the pulse of night
Stars, evershining stars
When we light a fire reaching to touch the stars

And we're losing all sense, we give it away
Nights of ecstasy that kill the days
Don't say you're leaving now
Stay 'till the morning light

We drift on through the night
