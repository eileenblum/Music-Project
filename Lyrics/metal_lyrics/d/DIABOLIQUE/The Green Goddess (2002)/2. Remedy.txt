So the prophecy said love
When we meet and the fire shows
Just let it all go
Yes, just let it go
We feel the same we two
We're so close me and you
Girl, you are all that I need
Yes, you are all that I need

We draw flame we catch fire with every breath
All the thrills in the world are not enough

This love is the remedy
Medicine that keeps us free
Pain, relief and ecstasy
Now this is all we'll ever need
This love is the remedy
Sweetest drug that sets us free
Pain, relief and ecstasy
Now this is all we'll ever want to feel

We both uphold the dream
And we'll always know what it means
When we set it free
Yes, we set it free
Surrender to the feel
A vibe that is unreal
Girl, you are all that I need
Yes, you are all that I need
