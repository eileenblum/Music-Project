You, you know what I'm feeling
Yes, you're all that I needed
You, you reach into my shell
Yes, you know me all too well

You, you breath the air I breathe
Yes, you see the world I see
You, you own my earth my sky
Yes, you said "let's get high and die"

And I do it all for you
I do it all for you
It's only you, it's only you
That make me feel like you do
It's only you, it's only you
And I do it all for you
It's only you, it's only you

You, you know when I'm so low
Yes, you're the girl I dreamed of
You, you free my desires
Yes, you're keeping me wired
