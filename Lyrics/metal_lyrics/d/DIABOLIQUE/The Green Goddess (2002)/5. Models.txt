Moving in silence
Shelter their souls
Moving elegance
So complete and whole
Their eyes are shelled with darkness
They speak
With their lips shut
Cos beauty do not needs words

Venus lent her soul
A role
Perfection
Divinity so whole
Breathing fresh air
They speak
With their lips shut
Cos beauty do not need words

They're high and adored like never before
They're high and adored will never lose it all
Spirit and soul like a work of art
Beautiful faces, beautiful hearts

Like models
Just like models
