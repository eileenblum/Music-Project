This is the world I see
You know we were misled but still meant to be
I wish your eyes were only open to see
This is all we'd ever need

This is the dreamless night
The secret world of starbirth and neon light
I remember how everything turned white
This time we will make it right

You know how these nights have affected me before
You know just how badly I want it all
These nights are not ever familiar
They are better than a million
And you know just how badly I want it all

This is the air I breathe
If we were stars, if it all was for real
The dreams, the darkness, the bitter on the streets
Longing is all that we feel
