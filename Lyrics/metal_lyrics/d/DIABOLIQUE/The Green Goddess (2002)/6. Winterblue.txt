All things broken properly ordered and put away
Dead flowers, pictures of happy faces
Broken promises inked on white paper
Little things, just little that seemed to mean a lot

So much beautiful love made for nothing
Still feelings are warm and surprising
A bond that wouldn't break no not this time
How could it have been even better anyway

I loved you then, I love you now and I'll love you always
What they said was true, you gotta fight to win always
Never knew how to ask, but what I wanted to say
Was, "do you want to be with me for the rest of our days?"

A love so promising, so true and pure
Now it's so difficult to commit again
Feel like leaving, going away, drifting away
Going to sleep again, trying to forget
