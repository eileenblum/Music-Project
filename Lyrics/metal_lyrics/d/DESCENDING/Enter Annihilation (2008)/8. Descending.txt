I tried to wait 'til now
When everything seemed so black
Black is my religion
Black is my religious star
Wait, try to be my excellent
My absolute sacrifice

Don't fear if you're wrong
I can be lost and found
No! I can not wait
To kill your fucking lie
It seems you never get out
Nothing more shall I want
Pay back role I'm trying out to be saved
I'm calling that fate

It speaks to me now
Well try to be my
God, no!
I can not stop this flame from burning
No way I can make it, 'til the end!
No control
I can kill you

'Til the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of lies

'Til the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of lies

I can be really thankful
I can be forever damned
No! I can't be all alone
I can't be all alone
A total awaking
A total awaking
It's up to me
It's up to me

'Til the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of lies

'Til the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of lies

'Til the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of lies

'Til the end of time
Dreaming I'm alive
Endless sacrifice
It's full of flesh
