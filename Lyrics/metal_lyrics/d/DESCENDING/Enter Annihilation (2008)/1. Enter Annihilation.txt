It's a made up fucking thriller
I don't belong
It's all fade away
I do nothing now

You're trying to dominate, you compromise
We're tired of living
Well try do something
Well try do something

Face up fucking circles, dead you go
When you burn the life
I can not take
I can not take

It's your time
Save your time
And now i think i can not take
I can not take
I can not take

No award
Take no sorrow
Bright Award
Drill the light, ignore the eye
Restore
Kill the mind trap to watch in my heart

Enter my way
Tke no sorrow
Wake up and pray
Drill the light, ignore the eye
Restore
Kill the mind trap to watch in my heart

Stay back
Roll payback
He's scampbag

Roll payback
Silence
Silence

Face up fucking circles, dead you go
When you burn the life
I can not take
I can not take

No award
Take no sorrow
Bright Award
Drill the light, ignore the eye
Restore
Kill the mind trap to watch in my heart

Enter my way
Tke no sorrow
Wake up and pray
Drill the light, ignore the eye
Restore
Kill the mind trap to watch in my heart

It's nothing
It's nothing
It's nothing
It's nothing i can't really fight

No award
Take no sorrow
Bright Award
Drill the light, ignore the eye
Restore
Kill the mind trap to watch in my heart

Enter my way
Tke no sorrow
Wake up and pray
Drill the light, ignore the eye
Restore
Kill the mind trap to watch in my heart!
