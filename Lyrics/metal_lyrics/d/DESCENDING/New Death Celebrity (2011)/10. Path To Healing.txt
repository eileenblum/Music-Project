I hate this long war with you - I don't think, this god is for you. - Hey, don't leave me, with
your empty dreams - I cannot take no more, these lies - Why repeating yourself? - A
believing so known, I'm believing alone - Believe in forgiving - I will find a place to rest,
with my consciousness, - of this life - No, you cannol feel like me - No more can feel by
yourself, my dreams are hiding from me - Please be all you can be - No! This pain will
never end - Come here to see, by yourself - My dreams are hiding from me - Please god, it's
time to set me free - Please god it's time to set me free - Take me down, to a place where I
could never be - I was born, in this world of madness, - in this world of sin - I hate this so I
have to believe, - without you I woold feel so damned - No, you cannot feel like me - No
more can feel by yourself, - my dreams are hiding from me - Please be all you can be - No!
This pain will never end - Come here to see, by yourself - My dreams are hiding from me
Please god, it's time to set me free
