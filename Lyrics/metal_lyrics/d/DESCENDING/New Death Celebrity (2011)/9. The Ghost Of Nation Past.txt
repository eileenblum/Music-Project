"Fear in politics leads our violent feelings - Behold I - Behold the darkest blasphemous demands
For they should fall into fire praying for mercy as we rule all - He who spreads the light - He
should be brought down - In the name of violence - And he will dance - Like a marionette - For
the sacred sake of our own Reich" - I am not reborn, I hate this politics - Control the press,
impress - It's time to look my skin - I can't take this, I'll be more than this - Nothing is left inside
You'll be all alone - Dead bodies dance around my bed - I think I'll stay this time, - in this living
throne - Time to embrace the living dead - Pain and truth - I have shown so many times in the
past - As you stood away and watched me - Take the responsibility of leading the way, towards
our cause's interest - Time has come, I cannot resist this - All these empty dreams, along these
empty streets - Nothing is left inside - You'll be all alone - Dead bodies dance around my bed - I
think I'll stay this time - In this living throne - Time to embrace the living dead - I am, the one to
be - No more, no more lies - Nothing is left inside, - You'll be all alone - Dead bodies dance
around my bed - I think I'll stay this time - In this living clone throne - Time to embrace the living dead
