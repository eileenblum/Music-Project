My muscles are tense, and these organs seem to fail - I am losing my senses.
This time I'm crossing the line I draw for all these years - I'm losing this 
body - I watch my body getting left behind - I can see the dead! - So, I've 
got money. I've got power - I've got the fameFeeling something? - I feel 
nothing, this is my fate - What am I thinking now, what am I feeling now? 
I'll be all away - Wherever we remain, we all so complain - this world is 
living me - I thought you'll see, I'm diving - Get away, cause I'm starving 
This physical body has nothing to do with me - Earth's gravity has lost its 
pull on me - I'm floating around in this empty room - I've just learned how 
to walk for the first time - I can see the dead! - So, I've got money, I've got 
power - I've got the fame - Feeling something? - Being nothing, this is my 
fate - One foot in the grave What am I thinking now, what am I feeling 
now? - I'll be all away Wherever we remain, we all so complain - this 
world is living me - Just take a look at me, as I leave this cell of flesh and 
bone - from now on, you will know me by the light I shed - So, feeling 
something? -1 feel nothing, this is my fate - What am I thinking now. what 
am I feeling now? I'll be all away Wherever we remain, we all so complain
- this world is living me
