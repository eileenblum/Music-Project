Taste this life - It's something you cannot control, - you breed out of control, - obey yourself.
Take this body, I've been the one - I cannot be alone, I cannot be your liar - Stand up - It's
something you've done, it's something I've done - I can't deny - Want this crown? It's some -
thing you bitches own, - Icannot pray for you - I cannot lie - Hey, - I'm nothing like you - Can't
be so real - I lie more than you do, I came out to be - Now I can be sane - No one can be so lone,
I can not belong - It's those things I never say, are keeping me away - This is the planet of the
dead - It's time to pray - For those who cannot stay, we are twisting in our way - This is the
planet of the dead - We are gonna stay - I'm not your friend - I have to praise myself for this
giving - You turn yourself, against your life - Against your life - Against your life - Welcome
to my tomb - It's those things I never say, are keeping me away - This is the planet of the dead
- It's time to pray - For those who cannot stay, we are twisting in our way - This is the planet
of the dead - We are gonna stay
