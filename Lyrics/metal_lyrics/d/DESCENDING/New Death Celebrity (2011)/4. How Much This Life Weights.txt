Breath, I won't give - This is not me - Breath I won't take, not until you fake. - This 
lonely being discovered your past life - Why won't you see, yourself in me? - Let me 
break your black clot kid - This is the year, of pain, wrath and fear, - cause death comes 
always last - comes always... - What are you looking at? Tell me what you see 
Tell me about this life - No, this is not my fate, I've got myself astray - How much, this 
life weights? - Stop pretending, you disrespect me, - Your god has failed, you cannot lie 
Put the gun away. - GODS DO NOT EXIST - You killed my hope today - GODS DO 
NOT EXIST This is not my evolution, - This is the year, of the goat - The year of 
your god - A dream we cannot fail - What are you looking at? Tell me what you see 
Tell me about this life - No, this is not my fate, I've got myself astray - How much, this 
life weights? - Stop pretending, you disrespect me, - Your god have failed, you cannot lie
