I'm just marking, a sign so restricted - This is my fate - I was born praying, saved, by this being
I am this light - Nothing on your mental, - it's something beyond your realm- I can't control myself,
I am so selfish - Nothing like a killing, can reach us now - La la la la la la - I can be on my way -
Take my body, my soul - I cannot take no more, - your lies - I keep returning - Take this
soul away from me, relieved by insanity - I want to be alone, - I keep returning - Go, take this
chance out of me, I cannot behold you - Take this second chance - And turn it into a living thing,
I cannot be like you anymore - I can rely on - On my torn abyss - Rich? I am not - Take my body,
my soul - I cannot take no more - Your lies - I keep returning - Take this soul away from me,
relieved by insanity - I want to be alone - I keep returning - Go! - Take this chance out of me I
cannot behold you - Take this second chance, - and turn it into a living thing - I cannot be like
you anymore - Take my body, - my soul - I cannot take no more - your lies - I keep returning
Take this soul away from me - Be lead by insanity - I want to be alone
I keep returning
