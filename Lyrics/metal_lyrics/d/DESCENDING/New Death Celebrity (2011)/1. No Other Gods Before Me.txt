I am the one who count the stars - I feel, so real - I' m
Stuck between two realms, - this war will never end - I
see the world embrace my throne, - the dead, - THE
DEAD WILL NEVER BORN - THE DEAD WILL
NEVER BORN - I am, this insane monk in this dirty
hole, - You were just the one, - I could not blame you -
Am I this permanent? - Do I deserve this throne?
Am I forever? - I am, just rumors and sound - Yeah, - We
are not what you think - We are alone
Long live the dying kings - No, we take what we want
We seem to drown - To save us from their crowns
Nothing can prevent your face from - smashing to
concrete, for I have this power - which was given by
yourself. - Now, look at your god, taste this holy hate
embrace this silent path. - Was given to yourself.. - Am I
this permanent? - Do I deserve this throne?
Am I forever? - I am, just rumors and sound - Yeah, We
are not what you think - We are alone
Long live the dying kings - No, we take what we want
We seem to drawn - to save us from their crowns - It's
something sane - For us, it's real, apart from here - It's
prejudice - I had a dream of future, present and past but
you were dead, it's not a crime to - spend your life living
in dreams where you just wait till you die, you need to
see how it feels, it feels so real - Yeah,
We are not what you think - We are alone - Long live
the dying kings - No, we take what we want - We seem
to drown - to save us from their crowns
