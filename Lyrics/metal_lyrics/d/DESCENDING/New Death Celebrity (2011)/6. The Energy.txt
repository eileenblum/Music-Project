They say, for what it is inside of this - I feel this change inside my bones - THIS IS YOUR LOVE,
THIS IS YOUR HATE - The counter planted in my soul, - your fear - The loss of balance - This is
your life - Now taste your grave - I can't end up believing, for blood and for real - I've got love,
I've got hate - I've got no will - The fear, can hold you prisoner - It's the life visioning process -
The one, I cannot see - The line between ourselves - Everything is energy - We are the energy -
No, I cannot take this end - I am - The real I is spiritual - I can therefore, - never be less than perfect -
Praise the meaning of life - You can be, - Philosopher - In the size of our world - The
family tree makes - our religious way of life - I'll help yourself find your peace - Just love all
your sons - Friendship refinds its meaning - I promise suicide - The fear, can hold you prisoner
It's the life visioning process - The one, I cannot see - The line between ourselves - Everything
is energy - We are the energy - It's not that I'm not here - Please let me confess- The lessons
I've learned, were lost in my head - The fear, can hold you prisoner - It's the life visioning
process The one, I cannot see - The line between ourselves - Everything is energy - We are
the energy
