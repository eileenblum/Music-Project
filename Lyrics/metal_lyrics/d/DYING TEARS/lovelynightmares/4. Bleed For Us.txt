Bleed for us my lord
With my knife or with your sword
Think of me in your distress
Me, your selfish mistress

At dusk, you anger become shame
Is it fate's fault, our only ours?
Merciless life punished us for our sin
Now we'll both pay for it

Let's drown together in destiny
Stars won't let us nor the dove
Enjoy your sin in eternity
If one day I die for you my love

I pray and I pray day and night
To be sure that we'll meet again
Now that you've disappear forever
My whole existence is torn apart

Now that we're both in this cold tomb
Together, in love forever
We can mix our tears and forget our fears
Let's hope for a better life... in hell.
