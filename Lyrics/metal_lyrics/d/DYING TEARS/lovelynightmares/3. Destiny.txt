Going away without letting tracks
Abandoned of this cruel world
Repulse: infinite darkness
For ever in the evil swirl
Time is a thing we must accept
Unexpected I sometimes fear
Destiny is what we all seek
Destiny was waiting for you

Going away
Wish to be save
Burn away
Such in my fate

Going away
To rest in peace
Burn away
For eternity

I've chosen dark, I've chosen night
I've lost my hope a day of life
I've never wanted to born a day
The silent sadness disturbs my senses

My eyes in tears my soul is burning
Shadow of death is hanging on me
Destiny is what we all seek
Destiny was waiting for you.
