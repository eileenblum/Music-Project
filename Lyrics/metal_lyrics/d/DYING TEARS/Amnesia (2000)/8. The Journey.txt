We're all seaten on a red velvet sheet
Sharing the wine of consciousness
Under the pentagram lays the painless
That represent blood of our feast
The twenty years of virtue
Under the full moon are disappearing
The infernal tortures start
In a coffin full of roses
Damned in infinity
We stare at those thirteen candles burning
Beneath those frightening walls
She is laying forever the beauty
Come with us, join our black community
Get ready for the journey
Now you only belong to insanity
Desire makes you thirsty
Swallow the poison, share our misery
The twenty years of virtue
Under the full-moon are disappearing
The infernal tortures start
In a coffin full of roses
Damned in infinity
We stare at those thirteen candles burning
Beneath those frightening walls
She is laying forever the beauty
On the worm-eaten walls
For eternity we've written your name
To leave a trace of what is no longer
Shame
And to erase your calls
Damned in infinity
We stare at those thirteen candles burning
Beneath those frightening walls
She is laying forever the beauty
Ends the ceremony
We lay, satisfied
Now comes the time
Of oblivion
And we sink
All together
In an ocean
Of darkness...this is the journey
