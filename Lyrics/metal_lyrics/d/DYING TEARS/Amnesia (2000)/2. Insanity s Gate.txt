Lost in the mountains
Far from a sensible world
I live in pain
Among the marks of still hot burns
Help me...!
Souls of my country are silently weeping
Country of rage
Through their depressed moans
The screams of the dead
I perceive a tree burning
I march through the war fields
Seeking to conquer
I destroy what life's built
Without asking how to dare
So much blood split
To get a piece of land
What have they build
The salvation that rests in their slut hands
Save me...!
I live atrocity that gnaws our becoming
A dark daily life
Like a martyr that a beast is devouring
Sacrifice
A furious creature which has no mercy
Monster feeds on blood
Of this black painting we live that lethargy
Evil work
Hey God, Have a look at your creation
Heal your child give him your benediction
Don't judge me, because of my glaring eyes
Glaring eyes
As a sheep I'm lost in Lucifer's arms
Lucifer's arms
I come from a place
Where life has no price
But in this obscure tale
Death decides between fire and ice
Kill me...!
Some years of suffer, some years of torture
The poison of the snake, drive us insane
Drive us insane
Insane,insane,insane,insane
Drive us insane
