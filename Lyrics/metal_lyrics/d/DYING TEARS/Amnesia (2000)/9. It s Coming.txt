The blue sky's turning into red
The sea's becoming black
No more time,future is dead
The ancient fears are back
The eagles are flying away
Lost in a hopeless day
No one knows why it's happening
There is probably no meaning
It was waiting for us
It was just waiting for us
I'm scared to never see you again
Can feel my blood boulin'in my veins
Stay close to me
I wanna keep my last breath for your skin
Now it's coming
Oh it's coming
What can we do it's coming
Yes it's coming
The mountains are embraced by the dark
The wind's ringing the bell
A deep dusk killed dawn
Here is the new hell
The doves are falling dawn
The sun's dying on the ground
Soon human kind will be just a memory
That God himself will forget quickly
There's no world left for us
There's no world left for us
I'm scared to never see you again
Can feel my blood boulin'in my veins
Stay close to me
I wanna keep my last breath for your skin
Now it's coming
Oh it's coming
What can we do it's coming
Yes it's coming
Please listen to me
Don't wanna be a fade flower
In a dead wonder
But i still pray to see a new day
Is it to late?
Is it to late?
