Above the well of thursty gladness
Was sitting a knight
Quenching his proud mare
Above the well of thursty gladness
Were sitting the sisters of fate
But only Melusine took the horse
She's the one that sees
She's the one that knows
She's the fairy serene
Some might say don't even approach her
She's the one that sees
She's the one that knows
She's the fairy serene
Some might say don't even approach her
When he dared to defy the sacred oath
He broke the forbidden door
And saw his wife during
Her day of weekly imprisonment
And Melusine was a serpent
She's the one that sees
She's the one that knows
She's the fairy serene
Some might say you shouldn't have approached her!
She's the one that sees
She's the one that knows
She's the fairy serene
Some might say you shouldn't approached her!
Since this day Melusine was forced
To leave her human life
She only came back at night
To feed her childs
She's the one that sees
She's the one that knows
She's the fairy serene
Some might say forget her!
She's the one that sees
She's the one that knows
She's the fairy serene
Some might say forget her!
