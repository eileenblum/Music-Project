I couldn't resist your barren promises
Why did you always hide in your faceless opinions?
Bumbling and floundering those eternal arguments
Repeating words you pronounced as en evidence
All i can face is my anger
And share it
With the ones
Who have been
Blind like us
Blind like me
You've sold your soul for fake
You've changed your thoughts as
You've looked through my eyes
Trough my eyes
