Bleed for us my lord
With my knife or with your sword
Think of me in your distress
Me,your selfish mistress
At dusk,you anger become shame
Is it fateâs fault,our only ours ?
Merciless life punished us for our sin
Now weâll both pay for it
Letâs drown together in destiny
Stars wonât let us nor the dove
Enjoy your sin in eternity
If one day i die for you my love
I pray and i pray day and night
To be sure that weâll meet again
Now that youâve disappear forever
My whole existence is torn apart
Now that weâre both in this cold tomb
Together,in love forever
We can mix our tears and forget our fears
Letâs hope for a better lifeâ¦in hell.
