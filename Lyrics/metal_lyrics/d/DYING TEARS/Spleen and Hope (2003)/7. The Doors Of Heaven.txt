Lost in suffering, I'm free
Now, that I crossed the other world
Now, that I'm falling...
I'm losing myself into your unconsciousness
And going to satisfy your madness!!!

But where are they? The doors
She burnt her desires for mine
I'm looking for the doors of heaven
Petrified, she won't enjoy
Listen!!! They're calling me
The eternal pleasure
The way is dark but I must find them

My souls is nasty
Suffering is coming back again
Temple of my mind
I feel her energy in my veins
She penetrates me
She will finally roam
With demons of my unconsciousness

But where are they? The doors
She burnt her desires for mine
I'm looking for the doors of heaven
Petrified she won't enjoy
Listen!!! They're calling me
The eternal pleasure
The way is dark but I must find them

You God, supposed to be the carrier of wellbeing, where I am?
You, the creator, conjurer or real magician
Guide me!!! it seems to be a long way now

You, my breath, I feel the murderer penetrating me
A total symbiosis the doors are too far away for a lost mind
You've got to get free where are you going, stay with me!!!

The doors of heaven are closed...
