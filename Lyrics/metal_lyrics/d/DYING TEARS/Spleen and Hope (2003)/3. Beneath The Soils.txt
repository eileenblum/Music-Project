I know a place where the sun feigns to shine
Where the sky's dead and everyone's blind
Birds sing wrong, trees are sick
The strongest's too strong, the weakest's too weak

Time is paralysed by dejections
Love is bitter, lost in frustration
Kisses, caresses became hurts and bites
And a boring day turns into a wild night

Beneath the soils
Flesh is burned by an acid blood
Beneath the soils
Hearts and souls live underground

Painful memories are drowned into alcohol
This fucking bottle is the only friend to call
Money grows in every thought, every dream
More precious than life and fed by needs

But one day, hope will sink like a lost ship
And in a desperate mind a burning anger sleeps
Maybe for the last time
Someone will try and will fail
And a faithless heart might be a part of hell

Beneath the soils
Flesh is burned by an acid blood
Beneath the soils
Hearts and souls live underground
