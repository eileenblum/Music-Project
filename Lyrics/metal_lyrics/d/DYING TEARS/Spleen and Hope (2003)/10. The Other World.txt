Lost in the dark
In a night without moon
How would you define
The fate as it should be full?

Then has come the light
And my star arrived
She caught me for a long flight
Am I ready to change my life?

All that you don't know has an answer
Believe in me and listen to my prayers
All that you don't know has an answer
Leave your pain, let see us exalted

Maybe the other world
Is just a state of mind
Its key is my love
And no other alibi

I don't need any promises
To make me take a way
Horizons and objectives
You're the best circumstances

All that you don't know has an answer
Believe in me and listen to my prayers
All that you don't know has an answer
Leave your pain, see us exalted
