In my jail, I'm looking for the sun
It's not shining today
And today I wanna run away

Talk to me
What can I say
Break this killer silence
Silence is fucking gold
Look at me
I'm blind!!!
I'm not the ghost of your existence

I want to believe
No hope
We've got still the right to choose
No chance
Wanna forget to need
No one cares
Tell me what have we got to lose
Nothing but...

Nothing to lose
Means that we've got nothing too
Keep your dreams in your head
In hell a flower's faded

Talk to me
What can I say
Break this killer silence
Silence is fucking gold
Look at me
I'm blind!!!
I'm not the ghost of your existence

I want to believe
No hope
We've got still the right to choose
No chance
Wanna forget to need
No one cares
Tell me what have we got to lose
