Here I am, like a mistake
Here I am
I've lost my little world
My one world
Turn out this fucking sun
The emptiness that you let me
Is full of a too real reality
Please, erase me

Each time, I close my eyes
The memory of your last kiss
Burns my lips

I'm not strong enough to join you
I will rot in my dead life
Waiting for the hazard knife!!

Your absence takes me down,
Takes me down, takes me down
Every night, deeper, deeper, deeper!!!

I'm in the deepest hole
Come back and take me out!!!

Each time, I close my eyes
The memory of your last kiss
Burns my lips
