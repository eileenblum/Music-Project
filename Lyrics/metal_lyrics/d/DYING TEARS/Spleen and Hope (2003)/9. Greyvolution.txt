It's time to wake up
Grey'volution!!!
And get out the jail
Grey'volution!!!
I didn't find the doors
Grey'volution!!!
But I don't care today
Grey'volution!!!

It's time to wake up
And get out the jail
I didn't find the doors
But I don't care today
I'm gonna do my revolution in your brain
If I can't see its colours I will do it in grey

This word will break the wall
Grey'volution!!!
That stops your power
Grey'volution!!!
My voice will resound
Grey'volution!!!
In your head like a thunder
Grey'volution!!!

Get crazy, let me set your heart on fire
Everyone will follow us on the beat of your
Booster

Here comes my grey revolution
For the ones who have lost passion

It's time to wake up
Grey'volution!!!
And get out the jail
Grey'volution!!!
I didn't find the doors
Grey'volution!!!
But I don't care today
Grey'volution!!!

I'm gonna do my revolution in your brain
If I can't see its colours I will do it in grey

Here comes my grey revolution
For the ones who have lost passion
