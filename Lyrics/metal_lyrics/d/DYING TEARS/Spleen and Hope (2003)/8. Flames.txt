Screaming!!!
A screaming breath is coming to me
A strong heat that I can't control
Hurricane!!!
Here comes the hurricane of my soul,
My red and black soul

I'm burning!!! Let me invade you
Oh let me light you
I'm burning!!! Be my human fire
My infernal tower

Living flames, viscerals carnals
You warm up my insane thoughts
Like a virus infecting my smelting brain
Through my veins you generate an acid rain

Living flames, burning rage,
Living flames, burning rage!!!

Volcano!!!
Like an erupting volcano
Spitting the lava of my anger
Boiling!!!
Boiling thrills shaking my body
An eternal oven

I'm burning!!! Let me invade you
Oh let me light you
I'm burning!!! Be my human fire
My infernal tower
