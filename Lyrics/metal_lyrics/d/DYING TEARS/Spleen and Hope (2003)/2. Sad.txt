Once again, I'm feeling my entrails boiling
Don't remember when it began
The smell of this souls cemetery
Makes me sick at any season

I'm sad, simply sad
When I see you becoming mad
No more fears, only tears

Once again, my heart's going to explose
Like the machines of their corpses factory
So I'm gonna watch my old little screen
To escape a little time with their bullshits

I'm sad, simply sad
When I see you becoming mad
No more fears, only tears
