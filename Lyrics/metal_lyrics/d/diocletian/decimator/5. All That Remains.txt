[originally by Bolt Thrower]All that remains 
Of your dying world 
Lies in crumbling, twisted ruins 
From the ashes - none will return 

Die 

Shattered dreams forgotten 
Body writhes in agony 
Death bringing release now 
From futile destiny 

Through wreckage still burning 
You look for signs of life 
Find only rotting bodies 
Scream in despair for mankind 

Die 

Realize it's no illusion 
Only you remain 
Smashed and torn reality 
Now face unbearable pain 

As the sun sets you are alone 
In this world of destruction 
Alone you must face this grim reality 
Of life, or death
