Cleaved asunder by the scimitar of titans
Celestial bodies disassembled piece by piece
Super massive black holes engulfing time
Chain reactions of super novae
Extinguished last light
Terminal corona discharge 
Silence in frozen space
Lost minds forever detached from gravitas
In an ocean of ink devoid of all sense
The universe untangled disintegration 
Galaxies like dominos collapse
Whom begat creation it shall now be undone
In the eternal depths of this silent darkness
