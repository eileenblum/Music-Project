Traitors among us
Possessed with lies
Weak and worthless
To the merciless noose

Traitors

Drawn to the gallows 
To be hung like pigs 
Dismembered burnt alive
Witness their pathetic demise

Traitors

Hydra-headed decapitation
Rivulets race in the sand
A plethora of blood fountains
From the severed veins of these absurd men

Castigated whipped and flogged
Crawling on their bellies
Felled in perplexity
Myriad mirrors broken into shards

Those who thought they would stand among gods
Shall feel the noose around their necks
Those who thought they were destined to be kings
Will see their blood jet from their open throats

Traitors
