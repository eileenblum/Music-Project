A pulpit of twisted horrors
A podium for provocation
Feeding the crowd amassed
Enraptured and ravenous
A rabid demented spectacle
Vitriolic tirades drip with venom
Spewing forth vindictive adjuration

Swarming hornetâs nest enraged
Incited to bloody violence
Victims dragged to the ground
Kicking and screaming in terror

Manipulate and dominate
Zealot capturer of hearts

Pierce aggressor
Order of chaos automatons commanded to kill
Stabbed and hacked
Hacked to death orchestrated through confusion

Discarded bodies fuel the flames
Hate factory billowing smoke
Burning flesh incineration
Systematic murder furnace

The zealotâs poison
