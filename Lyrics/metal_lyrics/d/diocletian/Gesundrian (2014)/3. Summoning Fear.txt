Decrepit lust drooling priest
Knelt before his hideous god
Acrid clouds noxious fumes
Shattered temple in ruins
Evoke call and summon fear
The powers of darkness and doom
Envenomed spells insane hope
Dead names despair in hell

Summoning fear

Atom smashed race left without trace
Dead and damned bones dust and sand
Reach across time black mark signs
Captive slaves screaming in pain
Rapture wealth women and war
Worlds rush before his maddened eyes
Maniacal laughter atrocious crimes
As greed steals the weakened mind

Summoning fear

Broken seal without return
The king upon his throne
Skulls grimace taunt and mock
As the old fool withers and dies
Black magic turmoil infinite strife
Has taken its toll on his soul
Power possessed at the cost of his life
Now all is lost to hell
