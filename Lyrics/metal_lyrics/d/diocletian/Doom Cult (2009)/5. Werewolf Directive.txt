Progeny of Europa
Raised by a father most dire
Fashion tomorrow in the forge of sacrifice
So that we may live beyond today
A brotherhood intimate with death
That only battle can assuage

Men among the ruins shackled to a corpse
The old world is one foot in the grave
Encircled by torment morbid sustenance
The new world by mammon enslaved

Progeny of Europa
Successors of struggle and pride
The rider of blood from the past now bleeds
White are the wolves that conquer the ages
And white are the bleached bones of our foes
Whirlwind descent into the maelstrom
Long is the journey that leads

Today this day
Is created the Werewolf and cast off the man
In an era where downfall is sacrosanct
We shall not fall prey to this decline
Witness the throes of an epoch at its zenith
Uphold triumphant the standards of truth
Streaming eternal back in time
Arise

Progeny of Europa
The rider of blood from the past now bleeds
Progeny of Europa
Long is the journey that leads
