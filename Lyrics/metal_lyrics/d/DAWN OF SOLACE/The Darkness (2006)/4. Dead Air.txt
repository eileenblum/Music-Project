These words I have written tonight
Could hardly describe The picture you would see
Behind my eyes so easily

My arms canÂ´t carry The weight of the world anymore
My mind wonÂ´t worry About tomorrow
My heart wonÂ´t feel sorry Anymore

Breathe
Dead air
With me

Black sun above Cold and no colours
White light Painting all black and white
