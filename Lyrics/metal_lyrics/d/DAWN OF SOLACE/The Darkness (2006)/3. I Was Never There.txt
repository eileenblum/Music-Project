Taking distance Walking one step behind
Like a shadow YouÂ´re simple minded and blind

If you are unable To take a stand
Or even understand

Ignorance is bliss Close your eyes
And your innocent

You never saw me I was never there
You never knew me I was never there

One by one My memories become
One by one My memories become
Erased, Undone

Burning bridges Leaving ashes behind
Breaking bonds between Isolating

IÂ´m not running Away
Not even moving Just observing increasing

Absence of light Around me
