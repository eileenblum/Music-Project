It has taken me by surprise
How unaware and unwise
Are the thoughts behind actions
Led by attractions

WhatÂ´s the difference between
Us and them
Beasts below us
In the steps of creation

Creature
The dominant life form
Like Christ has been reborn
God inside
Blind leading the blind

Behold with pride
Us gods
Of genocide
