Witches been slaughtered at the stakes
they've been burned, 'cause
they were in league with Satan
people delighted themselves
when this creatures burned painfully

Witches decided to take vengeance
Satan sent a legion of poisoned rats
the warriors of death and most evil inhuman

[CHORUS:]
The sentence of death
drives you to despair
God can't help ya
you shoveled your own grave

Now the mortal is in the bondage of Satan
Without mercy they persecuted people
got a place in hell reserved for you
