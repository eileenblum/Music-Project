I kneel in front of the altar
it's covered with flowers
I pray to lord Jesus
and contess my sins

I hear a scornful laughin'
voices sound through the silence
the organ plays by oneself
hell what's happen here

I look around and scare
skulls lie on the black altar
all crosses turned
green blood drops from the walls

[CHORUS 1:]
Demoniac monsters grin at me
all over signs of the evil
a man with a black coat floats over me
glowin' eyes stare in the distance

Total calm the figure raise the voice
our master is angry
we must appease him
you're chosen be happy

[CHORUS 2:]
Panic takes me I run to the gate it's open
nobody stops my rout
don't be so stupid
you can not escape

I awake only a dream
bathed in perspiration
a scornful laughin' sounds
a phantom floats over me
'You can't escape'
