The gates of hell are opened wide
Legions of death are rushin' trough.
Those are leaded by Satan's might
Invincible messengers of black death!

Satan's servants millions of rats
Are invading the land like a storm
they are so fast - they show no mercy
A lesson in total warfare!

Rotting fingers ...
...
...
...

Nobody is safe from the sentence of death
No one's defending his life
Cause when the army of death will arise
The final curtain falls!

mankind's living in constant fear
Everybody staying at home
...
...

he's ... invincible straight
...
...
he's fear of his life

Black death, black death
Lucifer's whiplash's tormenting the masses
Black death
Stinking corpses are proving his strength

Black death, black death
Lucifer's whiplash's tormenting the masses
Black death
Stinking corpses are proving his strength

...
...
...
...

Nobody is safe from the sentence of death
No one's defending his life
Cause when the army of death will arise
The final curtain falls!

The Master of hades is laughing loud
.. preacher, now you will die
...
See you in hell

Black death, Black death, Black death, BLACK DEATH
