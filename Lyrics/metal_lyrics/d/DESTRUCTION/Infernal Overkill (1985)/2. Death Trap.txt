Midnight, on a forgotten cemetery
No stars, just a black sky
The moon shines red
Terrible sounds in the night it is sabbath

Why are you here?
You've disturbed the sabbath
You know the punishment
There's only one solution... death!!

Wolves howl, witches dance around the stake
Serene holy hell, preachers pray
They pray to Satan, his majesty is here

Why are you here?
You've disturbed the sabbath
You know the punishment
There's only one solution... death!!

You look confused, and I know why
Now you see sacrifices, feel the flames, feel the fear

Now its too late, you cant escape
Your fear builds up, look at your death,
Wheres your god now??

Why did you come?
The ceremony has ended
You know the punishment
Death! Death... death!!!
