The mankind is dump, devouring all junk
The priests are serving for truth
Charity's their hobby and heaven's their hope
But their faith is based on idiocy

Satan is present, he's ruling the world
Are you too blind to see it?
World War III will prove my advice
Good is a stupid Device

DESTROY

Fools look around you, the whole world's malicious
Bloodshed and war, the mankind is vicious

Black mights will rise, nobody retains them
No god, no priest and no pope
Demoniac forces will be allied
To clean this world of false doctrines

Fools look around you, the whole world's malicious
Bloodshed and war, the mankind is vicious

Heaven or hell? The answer is clear
So better serve Satan, your lord
Don't be so stupid, to renounce his being
Or his might will destroy you
