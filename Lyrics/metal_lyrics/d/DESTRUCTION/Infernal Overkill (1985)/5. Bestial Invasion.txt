early morning, mankind sleeps
there's a roaring in the air
impenetrable fog

thunder rolls and lightning strikes
hell storms ,rush over the earth
but there's no rain

hell storms ,rush over the earth
Bestial Invasion

fog cleared up, people scream
they won't believe that the evil takes control

hell storms ,rush over the earth
Bestial Invasion

your time is out, obsession spreads
death rules, Satan's law is in command
Jesus Christ exists no longer

you better pray to the new lord
cause he's almighty obey him
