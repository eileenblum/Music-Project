[performed by Destruction]a piece of cake - to not be impressed
by those who are - resolved &amp; possessed
caught in their cage - cage of routine
anything different - seems to extreme

evil â lethal â primeval â retrieval
express yourself â is being rebel illegal?
evil â lethal â primeval â retrieval
facing the truth hurts like the stitches of a needle!

wildstyle
wildstyle â wildstyle
fuck your rank - and your file!

the best way to break out - of the fixed path
is to ignore the gossip - and create wrath
realize their world is just - build on lies
a fake society â a world in disguise

evil â lethal â primeval â retrieval
express yourself â is being rebel illegal?
evil â lethal â primeval â retrieval
facing the truth hurts like the stitches of a needle!

wildstyle
wildstyle â wildstyle
fuck your rank - and your file!

make it your own dream
make it come true
don t hesitate to be a riot
that breaks through
they will never understand
they lack singularity
they can t make a stand
doomed by conformity!!!

wildstyle â wildstyle
wildstyle â immortality comprehend
wildstyle - ignored or reviled?
wildstyle â fuck your rank and your file!
