Why the hell do we kill for territory?
Does greed make us blind and brute?
Why the hell is madness mandatory?
Who is to prosecute?

Why the fuck are we killing in the name of god?
Do we have the right to decide who is to kill?
How do they make us wanna join death - Squad?
Does the cruel man machine need to thrill?

Do we need to get ruled by a tyrannical force?
Why are we to lazy to act and defy?
How can they create hate with no remorse?
Why do the faithful crucify?

[Bridge:]
We get cheated - Our minds deleted
Misguided from our leaders - Bloody mutant breeders

[Chorus:]
Armageddonizer - We're none the wiser
Armageddonizer - Death bringing colonizer

Why the hell do we kill for territory?
Does greed make us blind and brute?
Why the hell is madness mandatory?
Who is to prosecute?

Why the fuck are we killing in the name of god?
Do we have the right to decide who is to kill?
How do they make us wanna join death - Squad?
Does the cruel man machine need to thrill?

[Bridge:]
We get cheated - Our minds deleted
Misguided from our leaders - Bloody mutant breeders

[Chorus:]
Armageddonizer - We're none the wiser
Armageddonizer - Death bringing colonizer

Dancing on a razor wire,
Confused souls for hire
Spindoctors and their easy cheat,
Evil spirits raising high - An alibi to outcry
With the wrong aims and sights - Who's gonna close the lights?

Dancing on a razor wire,
Confused souls for hire
Spindoctors and their easy cheat,
This world is fucking incomplete

[Bridge:]
We get cheated - Our minds deleted
Misguided from our leaders - Bloody mutant breeders

[Chorus:]
Armageddonizer - We're none the wiser
Armageddonizer - Death bringing colonizer
