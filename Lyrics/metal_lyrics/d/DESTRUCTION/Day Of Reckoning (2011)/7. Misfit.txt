Suffering in torment, my future is black as a crow
A rotten existence, a creature with no flow

I spit on all your rules
On your blasted philosophy of life
Your faked bliss feels like a slap, a stab with a knife!
I'm maybe a creep, and a bloody sinner
Life twists &amp; turns in this new chapter I'm a beginner

[Bridge:]
The question of my life:
How can an aimless victim of society not breed in sin

How will I survive?
How to not turn into a tool of the machinery

[Chorus:]
Misfit of madness
Misfit of sadness
Misfit of madness
Misfit

Rebellion, a cycle in the game of lies!
Even a solitary man won't let his soul demise!
It ruined all my dreams and all my hope
Guidelines are worst, worst than fucking dope!

The question of my life:
How can an aimless victim of society not breed in sin

How will I survive?
How to not turn into a tool of the machinery

[Chorus:]
Misfit of madness
Misfit of sadness
Misfit of madness
Misfit
