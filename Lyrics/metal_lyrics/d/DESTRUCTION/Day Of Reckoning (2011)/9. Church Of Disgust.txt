Broken as my youth
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
Justice can't cry
Tough me lies I couldn't deny

Never understood their aim &amp; their rules
Testimony for a world full of fools,
Pushed, rejected and misunderstood
Evil twisted lonely twisted childhood!

[Bridge:]
Satan's eyes - Coming to baptize
- Christianized!

[Chorus:]
Holy father - Deliver us from evil
- Who did I trust - The church of disgust
Holy father - Forgive us our sins
- Dust to dust - The Church of Disgust
In god we trust - The Church of Disgust
In god we trust - The Church of Disgust

A faith based on infallibility
With central authority
To veil the rape of young lives
The moral system an overdrive

[Bridge:]
Satan's eyes - Coming to baptize
- Christianized!

[Chorus:]
Holy father - Deliver us from evil
- Who did I trust - The church of disgust
Holy father - Forgive us our sins
- Dust to dust - The Church of Disgust
