On the razor's edge I kneel all this can't be real
Every soul stands for a death!
Where are my illusions all those fake conclusions
Will this now be my last breath?

Like a slow motion flick â but this fear ain't a trick
My live is rushing through my eye!
Panic grabs my mind â Now the daily grind
Seems unreal I can't deny!

[Bridge:]
Rich man â Poor man â Beggar man â Thief
In the face of death â They all start to believe

[Chorus:]
Sorcerer of Black Magic â
Preacher of an unseen god
Sorcerer of Doom â
Make you pray for your decay
Sorcerer of Black Magic

When time is up
â There's no more need for a clock
To late to fucking justify!
This fatal vortex now shows the final round
My regrets I can't deny!

I had too many challenges
â Broke down all the fences
When time was right I did fail!
Wealth is an earthly chance
â Dance the final dance
Dark forces will prevail!

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Master of Sadism King of Hedonism
On judgement day we are all the same!
Evil spirit crying all mankind is dying
No hope for the lost souls

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Sorcerer of Black Magic â There's no escape
Sorcerer of Black Magic â And no control
Sorcerer of Black Magic fond belief
Sorcerer of Black Magic â The bell tolls
