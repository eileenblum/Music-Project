I've sold your soul to the Devil - the Devil!

It's time to break out, of the daily routine
Been suffering the whole week, I need to scream!
My therapy seems weird to the one left behind
They call it noise but it cleans my mind!

[Chorus:]
Break your neck for liberty come on join the Armies of Black
It's time to end this slavery it's time for a bloody payback
Kill your frustration - Improve your awareness of life
Free your mind, join the pit - Let's fucking stage-dive!

I've sold your soul to the Devil!

This ain't a funeral just cause we are all dressed noir
This thrill of rebellion beats synthetic life by far!
The freedom music creates feels like a relieve
United by music get back your belief!

[Chorus]

I've sold your soul to the Devil!

A vicious form of expression - Brutalization of the tone
You can't kill rock n roll - Metal is the devilish clone

[Chorus]

It's time to break out, of the daily routine
Been suffering the whole week, I need to scream!
My therapy seems weird to the one left behind
They call it noise but it cleans my mind!

[Chorus]

I've sold your soul to the Devil - the Devil!
I've sold your soul to the Devil - the Devil!
