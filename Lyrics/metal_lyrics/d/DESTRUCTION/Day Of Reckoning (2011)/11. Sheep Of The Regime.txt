Insubordination - A dangerous game
In a uniformed nation outsidrs are to blame
Obey &amp; serve the authorities or you will go thru hell
Adapt to the system or end up in the cell

[Bridge:]
We did not come to fullfill your expectation
That's why we are the scum of nations and nations
We never cared about your rules and your lies:
Cause anything you do my logic denies...

[Chorus:]
Cursed souls of conformity don't wanna be a
Sheep of the Regime
Customization focus of the disease
Sheep of the Regime

Scared flock of sheep - Mutants of their needs
Individuality - A dying quality
The sheperds of the doomed - Oppress, confuse, rape minds
Cowed masses are in fear - The propaganda machine is here!

[Bridge:]
We did not come to fullfill your expectation
That's why we are the scum of nations and nations
We never cared about your rules and your lies:
Cause anything you do my logic denies...

[Chorus:]
Cursed souls of conformity don't wanna be a
Sheep of the Regime
Customization focus of the disease
Sheep of the Regime

Suffocated by paragraphs and rules,
We are losing our given strenght and our tools
- Degenerated by a system that poisoned our souls
- We still believe in our predicted roles! Outburst!

[Bridge:]
We did not come to fullfill your expectation
That's why we are the scum of nations and nations
We never cared about your rules and your lies:
Cause anything you do my logic denies...

[Chorus:]
Cursed souls of conformity don't wanna be a
Sheep of the Regime
Customization focus of the disease
Sheep of the Regime
