Evil Spirit - The Demon is God
Possessed and over the top
Driven by greed and insanity

[Chorus:]
The Demon is God
- The Demon is God - The Demon is God
Preacher of decline - Warlord of the rhyme
The written word - Is a weapon of cruelty
The Demon is God
- The Demon is God - The Demon is God

Killing the own blood in the name of tragedy
Lost are those who believe
Killing tradition of forming the public opinion
Creeping monotony

[Chorus:]
The Demon is God
- The Demon is God - The Demon is God
Preacher of decline - Warlord of the rhyme
The written word - Is a weapon of cruelty
The Demon is God
- The Demon is God - The Demon is God

An underrated tool - To tamper our minds
Preacher of decline - Warlord of the rhyme

Our fall - Super size intellectual minds
Misinformation - The ignorant and the smart
Linguistic monstrosity - The genesis of evil thoughts
Under false pretenses - Is how history is made of!

Preacher of decline - Warlord of the rhyme
The written word - Is a weapon of cruelty?
An underrated tool - To tamper our minds
In a world of vanity

[Chorus:]
The Demon is God
- The Demon is God - The Demon is God
Preacher of decline - Warlord of the rhyme
The written word - Is a weapon of cruelty
The Demon is God
- The Demon is God - The Demon is God
The Demon is God
The Demon - The Demon - The Demon is God
