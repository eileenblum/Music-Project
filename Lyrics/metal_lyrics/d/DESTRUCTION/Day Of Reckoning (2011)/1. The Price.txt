Everything comes to an end, forced or by normal intend
The chapter will close anyhow, the question is what you allow!

Fight - Fight the system - You gotta keep the resistance

[Chorus:]
Sacrifice - Isolation is the price - Sacrifice
Sacrifice - Isolation is the price
Sacrifice - Is the name of the game in the end we're all the same!

Avoid the brain damage intercourse, education needs to be the source
Doubt ridden should your game, the supervision is to blame!

Fight - Fight the system - You gotta keep the resistance

[Chorus:]
Sacrifice - Isolation is the price - Sacrifice
Sacrifice - Isolation is the price
Sacrifice!

Punisher of tainted horror - A ticking time bomb to explode
Guideline of the lost, this world ain't no place of fuckin' trust!

Everything comes to an end, forced or by normal intend
The chapter will close anyhow, the question is what you allow!

[Chorus:]
Sacrifice - Isolation is the price - Sacrifice
Sacrifice - Isolation is the price
Sacrifice!
