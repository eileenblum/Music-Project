[Bonus track]
[DIO cover]

ItÂ´s the same old song
You gotta be somewhere at sometime
They never let you fly

ItÂ´s like broken glass
You get cut before you see it
So open up your eyes

YouÂ´ve got desire so let it out
YouÂ´ve got the fire stand up and shout
Shout stand up and shout

YouÂ´ve got wings of steel
But they never really move you
You only seem to crawl

YouÂ´ve been nailed to the wheel
But never really turning
You know youÂ´ve got to want it all

YouÂ´ve got desire so let it out
YouÂ´ve got the fire stand up and shout
Shout stand up and shout let it out

You are the strongest chain
And not just some reflection
So never hide again

You are the driver you own the road
You are the fire go on explode
YouÂ´ve got desire so let it out
YouÂ´ve got the power

Stand up and shout hey
Stand up and shout let it out
Stand up and shout

Rest in peace
