I wrote this song for those who suffer
This epic poem will make you tougher
Stand up - Why should you be entombed
I wrote those lines those who feel doomed

[Chorus:]
Destroyer or creator
Be your own decapitator

Take these words as an evil base
It amkes you stronger - Phrase by phrase
In a broken world of promised and lies
There are partners in crime - Liberalize!!!

[Chorus:]
Destroyer or creator
Be your own decapitator

Everybody fights his demons
We are all freaks with a different aim
Some had luck others lost it all
When death unites us we are all the same

[Chorus:]
Destroyer or creator
Be your own decapitator
Destroyer or creator
Be your own decapitator
