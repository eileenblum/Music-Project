We are natural born sinners, our life is full of temptation
We suppress our evil instincts with divine education

Phantoms and ghosts
Are our declared lords, gods and hosts
Creatures of fable
Can't manipulate the mortality table

Born to perish - we suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish - we deny, we choke, we destroy
Born to perish - we suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish - we deny, we choke, we destroy

Supreme leaders and demigods, our divine beings in control
Wield our agenda to oppress our rise - to avoid their downfall

Phantoms and ghosts
Are our declared lords, gods and hosts
Creatures of fable
Can't manipulate the mortality table

Born to perish - we suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish - we deny, we choke, we destroy
Born to perish - we suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish - we deny, we choke, we destroy

We live in diversity and in doubt
No matter how obscure day in and day out
We act against our common senses
We need to break down all those fences

In this twisted world of fake leaders
We face too many inhuman breeders
The own mind is a gift against all odds
Provoke the twilight of the gods!

Born to perish - we suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish - we deny, we choke, we destroy
Born to perish - we suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish - we deny, we choke, we destroy
Born to perish - we suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish - we deny, we choke, we destroy
Born to perish - we suffocate on our own faith
All that we cherish - we deny, we choke, we destroy

Born to Perish - we are all going to hell
Born to Perish - or purgatory
