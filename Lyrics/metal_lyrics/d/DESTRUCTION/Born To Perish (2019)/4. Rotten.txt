I am more evil that Satan
Cause I am a selfish prick
I'm gonna suck your life-energy
Come trust me, don't be sceptic

I will take profit of your goodwill
I take satisfaction of your naivety
This is my twisted business plan
Thank you for joining me - run if you can!

Values do not matter - other dreams I do shatter
Only the ruthless are king - I am delighted to see suffering!
It makes me feel strong - to the winners I belong
Hell-come to my modern game, call me hero or call me insane!

Rotten - rotten to the core
Rotten - rotten to the core
Rotten to the core - Modern jungle - a cruel law
Rotten to the core - I am a Messiah with a mental chainsaw

Our system creates monsters
Watch me - I m gonna be the biggest one
Ruthless and cruel - second to none
Success is my heroin - just more deadly than H
After I ate your soul - yes I will rage!

Values do not matter - other dream I do shatter
Only the ruthless are king - I am delighted to see suffering!
It makes me feel strong - to the winners I belong
Hell-come to my modern game, call me hero or call me insane!

Rotten - rotten to the core
Rotten - rotten to the core
Rotten to the core - Modern jungle - a cruel law
Rotten to the core - I am a Messiah with a mental chainsaw

I am the master of stiches
Burning all, all the bridges
I am the bringer of pain
I am anything but humane

Why I became a beast?
It is me or you - ain't no love-feast
Society made me an achiever
That's why I wipe you out - disbeliever!

Rotten - rotten to the core
Rotten - rotten to the core
Rotten to the core - Modern jungle - a cruel law
Rotten to the core - I am a Messiah with a mental chainsaw
Rot
