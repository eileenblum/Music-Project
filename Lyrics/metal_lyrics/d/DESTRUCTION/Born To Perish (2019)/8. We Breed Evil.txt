Give them freedom and you'll get war
Give them hell and they will adore
Give them trust and they will cheat
Forever this will repeat

Give them power and you are dead
Give them love and you'll regret
Give them creation and they will kill
Caught in the human-treadmill

Monsters of the daily grind
Looking for peace of mind
Grudge pokes the fire - the fire

We - we breed evil - we behave primeval
We force devolution
Hell-come to our Execution
Corruption is an abuse - entrusted power for misuse
We force the Devolution
Hell-come to our Execution

Give them peace - they scream for battle
Give them technology but they want apple
Give them wealth and they want more
Only the winner they adore

Monsters of the daily grind
Looking for peace of mind
Grudge pokes the fire - the fire

We - we breed evil - we behave primeval
We force devolution
Hell-come to our Execution
Corruption is an abuse - entrusted power for misuse
We force the Devolution
Hell-come to our Execution

Wake up - you world of slapstick
You really do make me sick
Wake up - world in pain
Or nothing will remain

We - we breed evil - we behave primeval
We force devolution
Hell-come to our Execution
Overpopulation from nation to nation
We force the Devolution
Hell-come to our Execution

Corruption is an abuse - entrusted power for misuse
Time for a revolution
Hell-come to our Execution
