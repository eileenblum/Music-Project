Endless is the pain when they go without a comeback
Mentally destroyed are the ones left without a track
Nothing is more evil than the silence brought by the reaper
The isolation makes you feel you are just the gatekeeper

Nothing is more brutal than a soul fading away
A punishment of life for the ones that are left to stay
Nothing can describe the soul torment that you suffer
When you realize that eternity is just a bluffer!

When the spirit - leaves the house
We mourn - we suffer - we grouse!

Inspired by Death - enjoy every breath
Reality means counting lost souls
Tragic like Macbeth
Inspired by Death - enjoy every breath
Reality means counting lost souls
Tragic like Macbeth

No goodbye or see you again simply rips your heart out
A traumatized soul wants to scream, stampede and shout
All the memories are grinding your conscience in endless pain
Our violative right to exist will just leave a bloodstain

When the spirit - leaves the house
We mourn - we suffer - we grouse!

Inspired by Death - enjoy every breath
Reality means counting lost souls
Tragic like Macbeth
Inspired by Death - enjoy every breath
Reality means counting lost souls
Tragic like Macbeth

It feels like a hydra cause the pain will never end
So let it go and enjoy every moment you did spend
Our appearance is too short so make it a real good one
Live it to the max - we only have this single fucking run

Inspired by Death - enjoy every breath
Reality means counting lost souls
Tragic like Macbeth
Inspired by Death - enjoy every breath
Reality means counting lost souls
Tragic like Macbeth - good night - sleep tight!
