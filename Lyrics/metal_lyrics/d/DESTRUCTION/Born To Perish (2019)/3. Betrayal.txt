I love and respect
the life I did chose
Cause my youth was wrecked
many called be born to lose

Got mocked, they called me sleazy
My music was the solution
Cause it wasn't always easy
Digging Metal was my revolution

If you don't feel the vibe
You will never understand
Passion became a tripe
We created a bloody brand

Live with Betrayal - create your own destiny
Betrayal - fear the underdogs
Live with Betrayal - create your own destiny
Betrayal - fear the nighthawks

I had a serious aim
I'm not a slave of your system
I got something to claim
Never need your assistance

The dedication for the theme
Made me a soldier of rock
We created the extreme
While YOU end up in deadlock

If you don't feel the vibe
You will never understand
Passion became a tripe
We created a bloody brand

Live with Betrayal - create your own destiny
Betrayal - fear the underdogs
Live with Betrayal - create your own destiny
Betrayal - fear the nighthawks

Once insulted and suppressed
Now screaming for vengeance
Isn't this life just a test
Fail or high ascendance?

If you don't feel the vibe
You will never understand
Passion became a tripe
We created a bloody brand

Live with Betrayal - create your own destiny
Betrayal - fear the underdogs
Live with Betrayal - create your own destiny
Betrayal - fear the nighthawks
Betrayal
