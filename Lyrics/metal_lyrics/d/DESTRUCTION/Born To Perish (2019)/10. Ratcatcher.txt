Why can't I accept the mainstream taste?
My own volition will not go to waste
What is the trigger of this phenomenon?
Repeating the brainwash over and over again?

Opium for the masses
Synthetic standard taste harasses
Emulation &amp; the imitation effect
Wave of euphoria verses intellect

Ratcatcher - identity snatcher
Pioneers break the rules
The majority are just tools
Ratcatcher - identity snatcher
The human sense of belonging
Makes you a follower, a plaything!

The concept of aesthetics are
To adapt - customize and adjust
To stand out it needs guts and pride
But in anonymity they can hide

Opium for the masses
Synthetic standard taste harasses
Emulation &amp; the imitation effect
Wave of euphoria verses intellect

Ratcatcher - identity snatcher
Pioneers break the rules
The majority are just tools
Ratcatcher - identity snatcher
The human sense of belonging
Makes you a follower, a plaything

When did I decide to go my own way?
What did really happen on that special day?
How did I wake up from this dull pursuit race?

Opium for the masses
Synthetic standard taste harasses
Emulation &amp; the imitation effect
Wave of euphoria verses intellect!

Ratcatcher - identity snatcher
Pioneers break the rules
The majority are just tools
Ratcatcher - identity snatcher
The human sense of belonging
Makes you a follower, a plaything!
