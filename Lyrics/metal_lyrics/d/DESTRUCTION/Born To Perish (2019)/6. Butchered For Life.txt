Traumatized by life I realized
There is no way I can sympathize
With the soul stealers, fake healers

Fake acting sleazy cheaters
And broad grin wife beaters
Will not waste my time, in my prime

Life is too precious - to tolerate all the vicious
So those who offend - are running into a dead end
I learned to ignore - that is the highest score
They won't suck my brain - and I will remain sane

They're not my friends - I do not need a bloody Benz
Phony ass wannabees - sneaky and displeased

I wipe the scum of my screen
Let's bring back the guillotine

Monsters filled with envy - monsters that love to hate
Butchered, butchered for life, butchered for life
Monsters self-created - Monsters all frustrated
Butchered, butchered for life
Butchered, butchered for life

Some love to be ruled so many like to be fooled
I am a cautionary tale I will prevail
A society of grudge, all here to judgeâ¦

The ugly face of malice - they wanna be like Alice
Let's clean up this mess - be real and confess
The sincerest form of recognition - envy is their mission
They just love to hate - let's get this shit straight

They're not my friends - I do not need a bloody Benz
Phony ass wannabees - sneaky and displeased

I wipe the scum of my screen
Let's bring back the guillotine

Monsters filled with envy - monsters that love to hate
Butchered, butchered for life, butchered for life
Monsters self-created - Monsters all frustrated
Butchered, butchered for life
Butchered, butchered for life

Life is too precious - to tolerate all the vicious!

Monsters filled with envy - monsters that love to hate
Butchered, butchered for life, butchered for life
Monsters self-created - Monsters all frustrated
Butchered, butchered for life
Butchered, butchered for life

Monsters - don't trust anyone
Butchered, butchered for life, butchered for life
Monsters - wipe them out - wipe them out
Butchered, butchered for life
Butchered, butchered for life
