Ice cold bastards are destroying our planet Earth
Who made them our leaders?
Who brought this bloody curse?

The system is bent to the core
Why is it the wrong we adore?

We're not in charge of our course of action
There's no more influence - just distraction

We've lost control of our order
Where is the line, the fuckin' border?

Tyrants - tyrants, tyrants of the Netherworld
Tyrants - tyrants - ignore the pain of the souls you hurt
Tyrants - tyrants, tyrants of the Netherworld!

The scared sheep seem to be an easy sacrifice
our lack of unity will sell this cosmos underprice

Power of man needs to win over matter
Or all our dreams will shatter!

Tyrants - tyrants, tyrants of the Netherworld
Tyrants - tyrants - ignore the pain of the souls you hurt
Tyrants - tyrants, tyrants of the Netherworld!
