Filthy!

The gift of a new born life it is so innocent
And in the same time so damned convenient
There is nothing evil in any new born soul
It is so real &amp; pure unsullied and in control!

We create the beast
Start the blood-feast
Benefit from stealth - Filthy Wealth
Our greedy goal
Mankind in control
Risk your mental health - Filthy Wealth

We pretend to raise our kids in the most positive way
For real we educate sheep that fulfill the clichÃ©
We built an empire of lies to damage the helpless the stranded
A business model backhanded

We create the beast
Start the blood-feast
Benefit from stealth - Filthy Wealth
Our greedy goal
Mankind in control
Risk your mental health - Filthy Wealth

Getting rich on others weakness
A business model supreme
What a wonderful ego trip
To destroy peoples dreams

Within livin' memories
We milked our working class
To gain immortal wealth
Like a snake in the grass

We create the beast
Start the blood-feast
Benefit from stealth - Filthy Wealth
Our greedy goal
Mankind in control
Risk your mental health - Filthy Wealth
We create the beast - Filthy Wealth
We start the fucking blood-feast
We create the beast - Filthy Wealth
