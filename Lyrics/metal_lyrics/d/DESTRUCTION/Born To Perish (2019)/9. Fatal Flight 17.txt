Flight 17

The sky was turning black on a nice sunny day
In the airspace of Ukraine - total disarray
Two brother countries have been divided by cruelty
A dark and dreadful day in human history

Why have the warnings been ignored?
Two hundred ninety-eight souls on board
Wiped out by a deadly misguided Buk missile
That brought us death and pain and an obscure trial

Fatal Flight 17 - death came unforeseen
Innocent lives pulverized - on Flight 17
Fatal Flight 17 - death came unforeseen
Endless dreams were shattered - on Flight 17

A barbaric attack against the human rights
In the line of fire alleged terrorists on both sides
A 32000 feet high brutal killing, with no offenders
Political leaders are just puppets &amp; pretenders

Why have the warnings been ignored?
Two hundred ninety-eight souls on board
Wiped out by a deadly misguided Buk missile
That brought us death and pain and an obscure trial

Fatal Flight 17 - death came unforeseen
Innocent lives pulverized - on Flight 17
Fatal Flight 17 - death came unforeseen
Endless dreams were shattered - on Flight 17

Fatal Flight 17 - Fatal Flight 17

Vengeance or remission?
Innocence or deposition?
A tragedy beyond believe
The lost lives we can't retrieve, we can't retrieve

No justice for the ones left behind
They might never find peace of mind
The human soul is full of cruelty &amp; war
It can't get enough - wants more and more
