[The Knack cover]

Ooh my little pretty one pretty one
When you gonna give me some time Sharona
Ooh you make my motor run my motor run
Gun it comin' off the line Sharona
Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind
Always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My my my ay ay ay yaw m m m my Sharona
Come a little closer huh ah will ya huh
Close enough to look in my eyes Sharona
Keepin' it a mystery gets to me
Runnin' down the length of my thighs Sharona
Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind
Always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My my my ay ay ay yaw m m m my Sharona m m m my Sharona
When you gonna get to me get to me
It is just a matter of time Sharona
Is it just destiny destiny or is it just a game in my mind Sharona
Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind
Always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
My ay ay ay yay m m m my ay ay ay aw m m m my Sharona
M m m my Sharona m m m my Sharona m m m my Sharona
