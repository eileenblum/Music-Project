You feel lonely, nothing is worse
Who cares about you?
People treat you like you've never known
Nobody gives you a chance

Their lives are full of hate
Confound thinking, a threatening feeling
This nightmare will show you the way
Insane brain
The man's over the edge
Expect the sentence of the new strange creature
Despite my change you're alive
I will shorten your balls

Well your life is now in chains
Pain of the --- expects you
Death's a price you must pay
Sweetest guillotine
Insane brain
The man's over the edge
Expect the sentence of the new strange creature
Insane brain
The man's over the edge
Expect the sentence of the new strange creature

Insane brain
The man's over the edge
Expect the sentence of the new strange creature
