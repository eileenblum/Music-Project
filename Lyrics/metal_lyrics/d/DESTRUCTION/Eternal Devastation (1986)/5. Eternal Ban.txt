I'm dissenting
I'm looking differently
I do whatever I please
Exactly what I want to be

I don't fit into the general rules
I ignore them all the time

Breakin' the rules
Gonna take my share
Live my own life
I don't care

I don't fit into the general rules
I ignore them all the time

United we stand - eternal ban
Together we are strong - eternal ban

Long haired crowd
Is going their own way
They are invincible
If together they stand

I don't fit into the general rules
I ignore them all the time

United we stand - eternal ban
Together we are strong - eternal ban
