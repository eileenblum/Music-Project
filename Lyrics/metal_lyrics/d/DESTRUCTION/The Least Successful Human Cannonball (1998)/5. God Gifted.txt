I hate what I am and I hate what I do
Alternatives here I sit and wait for you

There are no cats in the bible did you know
God's breath is cold when you're drunk and far from home

Life - I am god gifted with life

I am video incarnate
Zapping from channel murder to channel rape
I'm pretty much into human evil
I'm personified hunger
And if I'm gonna survive this airplane crash
I'll take a knife and a fork and start eating people
Would you like to hear a story
So obviously of negative intent - yeah
Do what you will
We are god gifted

For my mum a letter I'm about to fall
I'm the least successful human cannonball
