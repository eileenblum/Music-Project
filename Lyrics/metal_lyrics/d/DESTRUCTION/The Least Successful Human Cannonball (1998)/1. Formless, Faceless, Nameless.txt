Only a fear with a head can be beheaded
Only a fear with a name can be cursed
Only a fear alive can be killed
By the man with the will and the hunger and thirst

What you love and what you hate
And what you like to dominate
Without form and without face
A nameless thing cannot be tamed
What makes you hide what makes you cry
Defend yourself - personify
Formless fears and faceless fears
And all your fears just need a name

You need a male god of wrath to kneel before him
You need a goat and a blade to make him smile
You need a god of love you can kill for the sins the world
Kill with hammer and nail

Defend yourself - personify
To get a grip on the things you want to stay or go by are you afraid
