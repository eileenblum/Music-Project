I'm a tick on a tree like a tick on a tree
And I want you to sweat for me
I'm a tick on a tree with my nose to the wind
I'm waiting patiently
I can hold my breath - I can hold my breath
I am waiting here wasting the years
Time means nothing to me
I'm a tick on a tree on a tree
And I'm getting thirsty
I can hold my breath - I can hold my breath

The power of patience keeps me alive (I can wait forever)
To drop down and become a part of your life
(Grab your skin and leave here)
Driven by instinct and led by drive (causing you brain fever)
The power of patience keeps me alive (I can wait)

If won't hurt when i bite I'm a parasite
Causing brain injury
I take more than I give as long as I live
Suck your blood - I'm a tick on a tree
Rip me out of your veins my head remains
Somewhere in your decoltee
To find a place for my clutch
Simple as such is my philosophy
