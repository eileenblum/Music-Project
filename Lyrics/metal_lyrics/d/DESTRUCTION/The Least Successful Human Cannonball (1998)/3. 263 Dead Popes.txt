263 popes dead and gone and one still alive
Urbi et orbi waiting for number 265 - Hallelujah
263 dead popes
When god is dead and Jesus left
Who could forgive a poor man's theft
Kiss the soil kiss the soil old man
Kiss the soil again
Kiss the soil kiss the soil you will
Become in the end
Break the bread break the bread god sent
For the lower men

May the lord give us all such a long time
May the lord give us all such a long long time hallelujah
