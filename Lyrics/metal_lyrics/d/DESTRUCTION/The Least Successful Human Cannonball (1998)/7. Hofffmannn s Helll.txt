Lucifer skies with diamonds and demons
I don't wanna die am I only dreaming
Think I gotta dwell in Hofffmannn's heaven
Or Hofffmannn's helll forever and seven years
In fears I drown will I ever

Digging in the trash of my subconscious
Hit by the flash in a chemical dungeon
Now I gotta go where realities falter
Betrayed by sound will I ever come down

Colliding circles collide in circles colliding circles collide in the bathroom in the hallway in my whole brain
Take another trip through your mind

Buried alive I am six feet under
Colours to the live to the echoes of thunder
Dante wasn't wrong and neither was Kafka
Walls of my lungs are closing in and laughter roars
Come down
