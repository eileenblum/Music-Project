I'd rather destroy myself than being destroyed by you
Autoaggression - better than being destroyed by you

I can not cope with things oppressing me
But I can punish the people who love me
Banging my head against the wall

Take away any chance to live my life the way I want
Not my fault not your fault anyway
I don't want to live I don't want to die
Pain I feel - pain you feel - feel it now

I always used to hide my emotions
Because I think no one really wants to know
The things that I can feel inside

Inside of me where nobody knows
What is going to be
Hurting me feels good to me
And lets my hidden self go
To be free
