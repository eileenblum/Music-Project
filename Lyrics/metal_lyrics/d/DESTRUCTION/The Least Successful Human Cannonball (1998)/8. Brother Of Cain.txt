Gather some people and build a country
You cannot force me to be happy and free
Gotta run away from where I was born to live
See the world while the world is watching me
National pride now I will follow you straight into death
Wait for me with a knife - Let the world see

Why am I born to be brother of Cain
Brother love ends in frustration
God loves me more than any other man
In a brother of Cain nation

Brother of Cain - Mother of pain
Brother of Cain - My way of dying

If being not free means peace
Then send me to prison
War comes with freedom
And life lacks of reason
