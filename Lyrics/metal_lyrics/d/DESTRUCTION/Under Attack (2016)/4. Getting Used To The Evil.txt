Getting used to the evil

We are creatures of habit and adore the divine
During life, agony becomes a routine baseline

The itch of being gets us dull and dumb
Don't be determinated on a rule of thumb

The sickening reality of mankind
A procedure we are all entwined
What once seemed so bad
All of a sudden becomes rad
When your nightmares are real
You are spinning on Satan's wheel

Getting used
Getting used to the evil
To the daily insanity
Getting used
Getting used to the evil
Praise, praise, praise profanity

We are getting roughed up by the evil within
We are passing it on to our treasured kin

The sickening reality of mankind
A procedure we are all entwined
What once seemed so bad
All of a sudden becomes rad
When your nightmares are real
You are spinning on Satan's wheel

Getting used
Getting used to the evil
To the daily insanity
Getting used
Getting used to the evil
Praise, praise, praise profanity

Depraved - we have adapted to the beast
Enslaved - to the brutalization feast
Deserted - ethnic borders are no more
Perverted - we are addicted to the gore

Depraved - we have adapted to the beast
Enslaved - to the brutalization feast
Deserted - ethnic borders are no more
Perverted - we are addicted to the gore

Extremity by youth soaring the frontier
Of this world that used to be once so sheer

The sickening reality of mankind
A procedure we are all entwined
What once seemed so bad
All of a sudden becomes rad
When your nightmares are real
You are spinning on Satan's wheel

Getting used
Getting used to the evil
To the daily insanity
Getting used
Getting used to the evil
Praise, praise, praise profanity

Getting used, getting used
To the evil... getting used...
