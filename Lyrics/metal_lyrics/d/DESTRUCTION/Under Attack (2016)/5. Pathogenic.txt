Pathogenic!

Get your elbow out
The game is on
If you wanna win
You'll be long gone
Before you even realize
What really happens here
You'll be my slave
I'll make you disappear

Competition is my name
I'm a madman - completely insane
I overtake your sparkle
Put your mind into a dark hole

Pathogenic - I am like a virus - epidemic
Pathogenic - I spread like a sickness - mand and schizophrenic
Pathogenic!

The fear in your eyes
And your desperation
Yes - to see the struggle
Is my motivation
In this odd society
Only winning matters
Obsessed by gluttony
The weak shatters...

Competition is my name
I'm a madman - completely insane
I overtake your sparkle
Put your mind into a dark hole

Pathogenic - I am like a virus - epidemic
Pathogenic - I spread like a sickness - mand and schizophrenic
Pathogenic!

Modern zest became - a contest of the stressed
Once you thought you're blessed - now you are obsessed

Grudging others fame - misjudging your own name
If you envy others bliss - you accepted the abyss

If only triumph is your gold - your story is foretold
Grim breath of malice - you have missed lifebloods chalice

Pathogenic!

Get your elbow out
The game is on
If you wanna win
You'll be long gone
Before you even realize
What really happens here
You'll be my slave
I'll make you disappear

Competition is my name
I'm a madman - completely insane
I overtake your sparkle
Put your mind into a dark hole

Pathogenic - I am like a virus - epidemic
Pathogenic - I spread like a sickness - mand and schizophrenic
Pathogenic!
