In this modern world
We all want to have a voice
But does it need to be heard?
And do we have a choice?

Behold - frustrated loser
You think you have the skills
You act like a bruiser
Cause your dull life needs thrills

Backseat drivers - pseudo Mac Gyvers
Riding the electronic highway
Flying high on the skyway
The purest form of praise is envy and rat race
Your suspicion and your slander
Won't make us surrender!

You're second to none - haters and trolls
You're fuckin' scum - real life zeros
You're second to none - the monstrosity of loathe
You're fuckin' scum - butchering your heroes

Your scream for attention
Might feel like a rage
But your real detention
Is your online asylum cage

Backseat drivers - pseudo Mac Gyvers
Riding the electronic highway
Flying high on the skyway
The purest form of praise is envy and rat race
Your suspicion and your slander
Won't make us surrender!

You're second to none - haters and trolls
You're fuckin' scum - real life zeros
You're second to none - the monstrosity of loathe
You're fuckin' scum - butchering your heroes

Scum - second to none

You fuckin' loser you are trapped
Your turn on is a clear deceit
We all know your handicap
Stupidity never increases it just repeats

Backseat drivers - pseudo Mac Gyvers
Riding the electronic highway
Flying high on the skyway
The purest form of praise is envy and rat race
Your suspicion and your slander
Won't make us surrender!

You're second to none - haters and trolls
You're fuckin' scum - real life zeros
You're second to none - the monstrosity of loathe
You're fuckin' scum - butchering

Scum - your heroes - scum - go fuck yourself - scum
