History repeats
Murder and deceits
Brutal reign of fire

Dominated herd
Theater of the absurd
Why do I inquire?

Inbreeding evil ruled our yesterday
Eliminating policy of decay
Will mankind never, ever learn?
Outcry your fear and concern

Dethroned - dethroned
This race devours its own
Evolution postponed - destination unknown
Dethroned - dethroned
This race devours its own

Force of execution
Sowing disillusion
Murdering their own

On their gory trail
Downfall will prevail
Into oblivion...

Inbreeding evil ruled our yesterday
Eliminating policy of decay
Will mankind never, ever learn?
Outcry your fear and concern

Dethroned - dethroned
This race devours its own
Evolution postponed - destination unknown
Dethroned - dethroned
This race devours its own

Once they wanted to change creation
Fight war, injustice and starvation
A dream to fight all the torment
Bring the sellout oppression to an end

On our search for the Holy Grail
Power-seekers always fail
Their ails totally out of sight
Blinded by the potential of their might

Inbreeding evil ruled our yesterday
Eliminating policy of decay
Will mankind never, ever learn?
Outcry your fear and concern

Dethroned - dethroned
This race devours its own
Evolution postponed - destination unknown
Dethroned - dethroned
This race devours its own - dethroned
