Who is this person you see in the mirror?
A strange image is getting clearer and clearer
Growing distance seems like an endless road
Lost everything under the weight of the workload

Drifting in a world of fears
Into isolation to the vale of tears

Stigmatized
And pushed away - a mind-slaughter foul play
Stigmatized
A game with no rematch - a disorder you can't catch
Stigmatized
And pushed away - a mind-slaughter foul play
Stigmatized

Nobody knows how to get rid of the eternal darkness
Don't listen and do believe it is your own weakness
As much as the voices in your head drive yoiu mad
Resist to fall - nobodies mind is made of ironclad

Drifting in a world of fears
Into isolation to the vale of tears

Stigmatized
And pushed away - a mind-slaughter foul play
Stigmatized
A game with no rematch - a disorder you can't catch
Stigmatized
And pushed away - a mind-slaughter foul play
Stigmatized

Stigmatized - in a society where you can't fail!
Mesmerized - by the viral capitalistic scale
Stigmatized - the pressure of society made you sick
Free your mind - only you hold the control stick

Drifting in a world of fears
Into isolation to the vale of tears

Stigmatized
And pushed away - a mind-slaughter foul play
Stigmatized
A game with no rematch - a disorder you can't catch
Stigmatized
And pushed away - a mind-slaughter foul play
Stigmatized
