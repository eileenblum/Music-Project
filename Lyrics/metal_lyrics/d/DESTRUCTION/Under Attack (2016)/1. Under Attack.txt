Under attack...
If you witness history the most brutal way
Your life will change, nothing is there to stay
If murder and fear become a tragic daily routine
Our leaders have failed - world is turning into the extreme

This system has failed - we don't dare to learn
Misanthropy till the point of no return
Mortals can't improve their little mindset
We are killing ourselves with no regret

Global - unity - the freedom of our mind
Humanity - under attack
Alliance and integration - freedom of education
Humanity - under attack

Misguided fanatics - the heroes of the lost
Turn prayers into a payback holocaust
Educational failure and staged religious hatred
A terror feedback monster self-created

This system has failed - we don't dare to learn
Misanthropy till the point of no return
Mortals can't improve their little mindset
We are killing ourselves with no regret

Global - unity - the freedom of our mind
Humanity - under attack
Alliance and integration - freedom of education
Humanity - under attack

We have raised a new quality of misanthropy
Mass murderer a part of our modern society

Killing in the name of god became a drift
Death and doom a daily graveyard shift
This myth and this pestilence need to be exiled
Leaders change history - kill this inhuman brainchild

Global - unity - the freedom of our mind
Humanity - under attack
Alliance and integration - freedom of education
Humanity - under attack

Under attack - under attack
We cursed the gods already decades ago
Under attack
We didn't learn from the crusades
Under attack
