Hypnotized by the taste of the masses
Fend like Phoenix from the ashes
Rising like the hellion within
To not defend yourself is a deadly sin

Who decides what's good or bad
They tell you you're a nomad
The riffraff has no fucking idea
Let them pray their ave maria

The wheels are turning reverse
To be different seems a curse

Die hard for your own actions
Be proud of your own mind
Don't be just a taker - be a giver
Stand up for what you deliver
Don't listen to the blinded mob
To the silly propaganda machine
Don't be just a taker - be a giver
Stand up for what you deliver

Pay no attention to the opinion maker
Mainstream taste has always been a faker
The mob takes the path of least resistance
Why do you need a ruler of your existence?

The wheels are turning reverse
To be different seems a curse

Die hard for your own actions
Be proud of your own mind
Don't be just a taker - be a giver
Stand up for what you deliver
Don't listen to the blinded mob
To the silly propaganda machine
Don't be just a taker - be a giver
Stand up for what you deliver

The biggest fail is the impression
That what everybody likes must be ace
This opinion-forming suppression
A weird phenomenon of our race

Die hard for your own actions
Be proud of your own mind
Don't be just a taker - be a giver
Stand up for what you deliver
Don't listen to the blinded mob
To the silly propaganda machine
Don't be just a taker - be a giver
Stand up for what you deliver
