In those times of uniformity
We revolted against the stream
Breaking out of the conformity
Real, rough, raw and extreme

Music back then was the incest
Of the narrow-minded bourgeois
To an industry of no interest
We brought the sonic chainsaw

What the fuck ever happened
To the true spirit of rock?
They are raping the pureness
Cheating - playback shock

Scammers of rock n' roll
Traitors of our soul
Destroy our philosophy
Pureness is the key

Elegant pigs designed to lead the blind
...Blind leading the blind...

Authenticity once was our kick
This fakness really makes me sick
This soulless fraud called backing track
No talent is needed just a rack

What the fuck ever happened
To the true spirit of rock?
They are raping the pureness
Cheating - playback shock

Scammers of rock n' roll
Traitors of our soul
Destroy our philosophy
Pureness is the key

Elegant pigs designed to lead the blind
...Blind leading the blind...

One day they'll have to confess
Their cheat will have a huge mess
A fake revolution of the midi console
A rip off - a let down-no parole!

What the fuck ever happened
To the true spirit of rock?
They are raping the pureness
Cheating - playback shock

Scammers of rock n' roll
Traitors of our soul
Destroy our philosophy
Pureness is the key

Elegant pigs designed to lead the blind
...Blind leading the blind...
Elegant pigs designed to lead the blind
...Blind leading the blind...
