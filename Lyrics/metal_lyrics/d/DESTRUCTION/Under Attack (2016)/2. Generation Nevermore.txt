Say goodbye to our mother earth
The time has come for a rebirth
A risky deal, the game of fear
No senseless loss without a tear

Ho much hazard can we take?
How much harmony can we fake?

True evil is our greed for more growth
Power-mad rulers love to overdose

How much lies can we bury in blood
How much more can we twist the word of god?
Our indifference kills all we adore!
Wake up - generation nevermore
We won't stop till our world is in flames
When did we start reaching out for wrong aims?
Our indiffernce kills all we adore!
Wake up - generation nevermore!

Generation nevermore
Generation nevermore

The law of the jungle regulates our habitat
The benefits the ruthless human-rat
Only the mortal breed is stupid enough
To not get that their world's a big bluff

When will we stop to violate our globe?
When will we realize there's no more hope?

We ignore the facts and pray for salvation
The creator wipes out his own creation!

How much lies can we bury in blood
How much more can we twist the word of god?
Our indifference kills all we adore!
Wake up - generation nevermore
We won't stop till our world is in flames
When did we start reaching out for wrong aims?
Our indiffernce kills all we adore!
Wake up - generation nevermore!

Generation nevermore
Generation nevermore

How much lies can we bury in blood
How much more can we twist the word of god?
Our indifference kills all we adore!
Wake up - generation nevermore
We won't stop till our world is in flames
When did we start reaching out for wrong aims?
Our indiffernce kills all we adore!
Wake up - generation nevermore!

How much lies can we bury in blood
How much more can we twist the word of god?
Our indifference kills all we adore!
Wake up - generation nevermore
We won't stop till our world is in flames
When did we start reaching out for wrong aims?
Our indiffernce kills all we adore!
Wake up - generation nevermore!

Wake up - generation nevermore!
