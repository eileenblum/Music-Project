Daily we get fooled by the persons we trust
They want conformity - we have to adjust
Screams of desperation - stay unheard
Who is to believe in the dreams of the absurd?

They make up the news - create rules for their need
You have andy brains left - why not stampede?
They mesmerize the horde with hollow circus acts
Conspiracy theories or statement of facts?

Betrayal - deceit - delusion - deception
Of our bloodline
Blindness - rules - obey - you bloody fools
This is our decline

Conductor, conductor, conductor of the void
Instructor, instructor, instructor of the paranoid
Betrayal - deceit - delusion - deception
Conductor, conductor, conductor of the void
Betrayal - deceit - delusion - deception
Conductor, conductor, conductor of the void

This system works for the blind that have no doubt
The skeptic disbelievers - will get wiped out
They make their own laws and sell them as gold
All of sudden you dig what you get told

Betrayal - deceit - delusion - deception
Of our bloodline
Blindness - rules - obey - you bloody fools
This is our decline

Conductor, conductor, conductor of the void
Instructor, instructor, instructor of the paranoid
Betrayal - deceit - delusion - deception
Conductor, conductor, conductor of the void
Betrayal - deceit - delusion - deception
Conductor, conductor, conductor of the void

Remember a genius called Siegmund Freud?
He saw it coming our urge to get destroyed
Religion and culture misused for manipulation
A perfect mindset to enslave our creation

Remember a genius called Siegmund Freud?
He saw it coming our urge to get destroyed
Our mindset is a fragile treasure
And our breed shatters it with pleasure

Conductor, conductor, conductor of the void
Instructor, instructor, instructor of the paranoid
Betrayal - deceit - delusion - deception
Conductor, conductor, conductor of the void
Betrayal - deceit - delusion - deception
Conductor, conductor, conductor of the void

Decline - bloodline!
