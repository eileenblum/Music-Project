Black visions from the satellite
Sky deaf ears they never get cries
Fat jackals howl at the moon flies
Buzzing playing death's tune
Night ends but the sun it don't rise
Tombs open and the dead they will rise
Black market buys your soul real cheap
No escaping what you sow you will reap
Prisoners of the damned find another land
Planet of the lost land of fire and frost
Prisoners of the dead fear the unknown dread
Tidal waves at sea set the serpents free
Black visions from the satellite sky
Deaf ears they never get cries
Fat jackals howl at the moon flies
Buzzing playing death's tune
Coup d'etat on a global scale
Opposition locked up in jail
Domination the goons are the boss
Human race nailed to a cross
Prisoners of the damned find another land
Planet of the lost land of fire and frost
Prisoners of the dead fear the unknown dread
Tidal waves at sea set the serpents free
Prisoners of the damned find another land
Planet of the lost land of fire and frost
Prisoners of the dead fear the unknown dread
Tidal waves at sea set the serpents free free free free
