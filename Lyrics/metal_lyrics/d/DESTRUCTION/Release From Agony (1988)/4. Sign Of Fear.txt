Getting scared by every chance to love
Look careful which people you meet!
Almost being caught when you cheat
Why do people call it sign of the gods?

Sign of fear â ungracious condemnation
Sign of fear â ungracious condemnation
Sign of fear

It's getting on a bigger stage
Spreading like the black pest
When you've realized it, there's no time left
No way to pass through

Sign of fear â ungracious condemnation
Sign of fear â ungracious condemnation
Sign of fear

Unfair punishment of free lifestyle?
Will we return to the Middle Ages?
You'll get distrustful of your friends
Carelessness and indifference will lead to death

Sign of fear â ungracious condemnation
Sign of fear â ungracious condemnation
Sign of fear, sign of fear, sign of fear!
