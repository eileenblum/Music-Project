All the faces, all the voices
Seem to fade in the crowd
Neurotic minds realize the danger,
Expect their destiny, fear their future

Past never changes
Running into unconscious ruins!
Future can't be hidden
Staring at unconscious ruins!

The more they know, the less they talk
One day our apprehensions will come true
Human beings blown out like candles
Mankind executed by itself

Past never changes
Running into unconscious ruins!
Future can't be hidden
Staring at unconscious ruins!

It's not too late to realize
Why people fake ignorance
Inside they are scared to death
But too weak to react

Past never changes
Running into unconscious ruins!
Future can't be hidden
Staring at unconscious ruins!

Death is knocking at your backdoor
Don't turn your back
In this the fall of humanity
Nuclear holocaust our imminent fate?

Past never changes
Running into unconscious ruins!
Future can't be hidden
Staring at unconscious ruins!
