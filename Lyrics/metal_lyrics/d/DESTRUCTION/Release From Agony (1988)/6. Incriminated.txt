It began about half a century ago
With the foundation of the hopeless empire of 1000 years
Commanded by a ruler of cruelty
A nation captivated by idealism

Why do we take the responsibility of his insanity
Although we've never asked for that legacy?

Incriminated - no forgiveness
Incriminated - no forgiveness

Indescribable, inhuman greed for power
Supported by fanatics under his spell
Obsessed by his aim to wipe out non-Aryans
He rushed millions of people into disaster

Why do we take the responsibility of his insanity
Although we've never asked for that legacy?

Incriminated - no forgiveness
Incriminated - no forgiveness

More than 40 years after his predestined fall
We still got to take the responsibility
For those events we know from the history book

Why should we feel guilty for deeds done in the past?
It began about half of a century ago,
With the foundation of the hopeless empire of 1000 years
Commanded by a ruler of cruelty
A nation captivated with idealism

Why do we take the responsibility of his insanity
Although we've never asked for that legacy?
