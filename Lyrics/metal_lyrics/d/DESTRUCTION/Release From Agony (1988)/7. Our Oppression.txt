Illogical laws and rules without a meaning
Only created to be an obstacle in our life
Democracy to live free, stupid to believe
'Cause the government watches every step of us

Corrupt politicians, easy to buy
Makin' decisions without asking for our opinion
Blinded by lies, hypnotized by illusions
They cheat us out of our freedom

Our oppression â there's no discussion
Our oppression â there's no discussion

Why is this called democracy?
We think that the power of decision is in our hands
But those who rule are not the ones we chose
Our oppression, a legal requirement?

Our oppression â there's no discussion
Our oppression â there's no discussion
Our oppression â there's no discussion
Our oppression â there's no discussion
