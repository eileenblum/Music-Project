"in Nomine Patris Et Filii Et Spiritus Sancti..."

I see fake healers on top of the bill
I see the idle rich getting their thrill
Creating rules that are made to be broken
Playing god - The truth is unspoken

[Chorus:]
Sloth - The vicious circle begins
Starting the deadly sins
7 games of greed - 7 ways to succeed
Wrath, Envy &amp; Pride
Spreading fear &amp; Fright
Gluttony and lust - my disgust,
Cruelty always wins:

The Seven Deadly Sins

I see blind divine worship &amp; kangaroo courts
No - They won't forget to praise the lord
Using their religious belief to succeed
Their fuel is to make others bleed!

[Chorus:]
Sloth - The vicious circle begins
Starting the deadly sins
7 games of greed - 7 ways to succeed
Wrath, Envy &amp; Pride
Spreading fear &amp; Fright
Gluttony and lust - my disgust,
Cruelty always wins:

The Seven Deadly Sins

[Solo: Mike Sifringer]

Preachers are raping our trust with their prayers
Crowned with success subhuman betrayers
Raking in money is their unholy aim
Voracity - Cheating while playing their Game

[Chorus:]
Sloth - The vicious circle begins
Starting the deadly sins
7 games of greed - 7 ways to succeed
Wrath, Envy &amp; Pride
Spreading fear &amp; Fright
Gluttony and lust - my disgust,
Cruelty always wins:

The Seven Deadly Sins
