[Bonus Track for Japan]
[Tank cover]

Wakey, wakey...
Hated you for far too long, you're just so damn polite
You've been screaming , shouting all night long
That you we've gotta get wrecked tonight...
I don't know when to stop... I just can't get enough...Shellshock!
It's getting late in the evening, I can't wait to turn the lights out...
Come down from the ceiling, don't stop just burn me out...
I don't know when to stop, I just can't get enough...Shellshock!
Some of the things you do... I just don't understand
But those strange things that you do... must mean I'm going mad
I don't know when to stop... I just can't get enough...Shellshock!
Those strange things that you give to me you give me...Shellshock!
