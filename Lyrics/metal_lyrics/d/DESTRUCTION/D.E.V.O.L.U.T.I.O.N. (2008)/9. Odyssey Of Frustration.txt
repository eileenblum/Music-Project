Malice!
Odyssey of frustration
Odyssey of our creation
Brainpower seems a gift or is it a goddamned curse?
So why the hell don't you calm down and get what you deserve
Why do you act like a loser - it's obvious: dissatisfaction kills
So why the hell do you misuse your fuckin' skills?
Wrong aims to achieve - wrong commands to receive
Struggle for existence - Where's your power of resistance?
Odyssey of frustration
Odyssey of our creation
Just a slave of the system - resignation, your head is rammed
Overrated, uneducated - most supreme but condemned
They're simulating and pretending to improve our little fuckin' mind
Backed up by the media perfect affection - we're going blind
Ignorance, decadence - philosophy of salvation
Initiator, fake creator - stream of misinformation
Stultification of our nation - supremacy of creation
Mediocrity, conformity - odyssey of frustration
Brainpower seems a gift or is it a goddamned curse?
So why the hell don't you calm down and get what you deserve
Why do you act like a loser - it's obvious: dissatisfaction kills
So why the hell do you misuse your fuckin' skills?
Wrong aims to achieve - where's your power of resistance?
Odyssey of frustration
Odyssey of our creation
Odyssey!
