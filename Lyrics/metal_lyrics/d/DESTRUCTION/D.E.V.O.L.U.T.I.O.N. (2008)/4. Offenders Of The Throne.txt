Go!
You won't believe me
Cause You Think I am Free
Appearance or reality?
In a country of envy

[Bridge:]
All this jealousy is ruling
Those no class stupid wannabes
Pre-programmed breed of losers
Telling me what i should be

[Chorus:]
Offenders of the Throne
Envious freeloaders
With no Backbone
Offenders of the throne
Born and raised as drone

Rules are there to be broken
Abusive muck - Easy spoken
They breathe fire and brimstone
Offenders of the throne

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

Back - seat drivers
With no backbone - Possessed
Should be engraved
On your tombstone - possessed

[Solo: Mike Sifringer]

Soul-Destroying Demise
Without Substance you wont' rise
Possessed and ruled by jealousy
I'm Proud to be your worst enemy

[Solo: Mike Sifringer]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Outburst!!!
