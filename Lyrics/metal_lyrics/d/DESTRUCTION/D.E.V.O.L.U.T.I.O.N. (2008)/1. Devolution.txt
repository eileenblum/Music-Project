D.Evolution
Confusion, Last Solution
-Our mighty technology obscures our decay
step by step, fuckin' regret
-Our modern economy is not meant to stay

Once I believed - in progress
Once I Had dreams - and success
My state - your home - our base of life
dead and buried in the stillborn ego
Of our inner strife

Chorus:
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.
World is out of hand
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.
We're cavemen on command
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.
We're buried in the sand

Disollusion, of a system
- That does accelerate
It's own disarray
The Theory, of Evolution
-Just a note in the book
Of Human Decay

Once I believed - in good morals
Once I Had dreams - ain't no quarrels
My pride - Your honor has been sacrificed
For This unholy cash machine
That's no one can deny

[Chorus:]
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.
This World is out of hand
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.
We're cavemen on command
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.
We're buried in the sand
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.

Once i Believed - in progress
Once i had dreams - and success
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.

[Solo: Vinnie Moore]

Once i believed - in progress
Once i had dreams - and success
My state - your home - our base of life
Dead and buried in the stillborn Ego
Of our inner strife

[Chorus:]
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.
This World is out of hand
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.
We're cavemen on command
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.
We're buried in the sand
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.

Once i Believed - in progress
Once i had dreams - and success
D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N.
