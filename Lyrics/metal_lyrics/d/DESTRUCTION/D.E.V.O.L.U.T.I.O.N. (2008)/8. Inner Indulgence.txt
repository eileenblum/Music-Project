You wake up and you feel like shit
Even your bloody vomit won't make you quit
Sleepless nights and painful days
As you gathered: your sick habit slays
In your agenda there's no room for hope
Your daily deeds are possessed by dope
Puppet of chemicals - you can't choose your fate
Those who survived
As your friends will be betrayed
When you will stop breathing
No one will care
Don't fucking worry
You will get your share!
Inner indulgence - beyond the veil
You'll get your share - see you in hell
Some of best friends are six feet under
We choose our own bloody path
Why do you still wonder?
When you will stop breathing cause of your crystal meth
You better fuckin' worry, this will take your last breath
Don't waste my time - get out of my way
No respect and no honor - for your deeds you will pay
In your agenda there's no room for hope
Your daily deeds are possessed by dope
When you will stop breathing
No one will care
Don't fucking worry
You will get your share!
Inner indulgence - beyond the veil
You'll get your share - see you in hell
Inner indulgence
Get out of my way
Inner indulgence
For your deeds you will pay
Suffer in pain!
