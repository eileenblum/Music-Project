No One Shall Survive
We all have something to hide
We all have 'another side'
None shall defy his deeds
None shall deny his evil needs
Have a look in the mirror, what do you see
Is this person your friend
Or your worst enemy
Take a reflection, look back, dive into the past
Did you recognize that nothing's there to last?
No one!
No one!
We all have something to hide
We all have 'another side'
None shall defy his deeds
None shall deny his evil needs
No - no one shall survive
The inner-strife
Face the deadly dive
No one shall survive
The diary of a sad man did create a madman
The voices in your head, twisted your mind - no more plan
Looking for the resurrection this story of reflection
Make a clean sweep of your past nothing's there to last!
No one!
No one!
Witnesses erased
Reality replaced
Detection close to zero
Survivors will never be the hero!
Have a look in the mirror, what do you see
Is this person your friend
Or your worst enemy
Take a reflection, look back, dive into the past
Did you recognize that nothing's there to last?
No one!
No one!
