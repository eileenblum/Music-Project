Is this the price we have to pay?
I'm sick of those who have nothing to say
Feel the anger of social outcast
Luxury and affluence are not made to last!

In this world of hubristic selfishness
Crimes against mankind will lead to success
We can't close our eyes, we pretend carity
How the hell can we agree?

[Bridge:]
The ravenous world - is rapping their children
Prayers won't be heard - Evil runs it's course

[Chorus:]
Taking the elevator to hell
Cursed and under the spell
Let's get this traighten
FuckWake up we are Satan!!!

The impact of our growth will kill
Our Class is empty - No refill
A great idea to destroy your home
And wipe away your chromosomes

[Bridge:]
The ravenous world - is rapping their children
Prayers won't be heard - Evil runs it's course

[Chorus:]
Taking the elevator to hell
Cursed and under the spell
Let's get this traighten
FuckWake up we are Satan!!!

Facing judgement day
Sure We all wanna stay?
Deeds of the scum will reveal
The world became so unreal

[Solo: Mike Sifringer]

As Proven By history
The offenders are wrapped in mystery
Our days will fade to grey
Sure you wanna face our decay?

[Solo: Harry Wilkens / V.O. Pulver / Harry Wilkens / V.O. Pulver/Both]
