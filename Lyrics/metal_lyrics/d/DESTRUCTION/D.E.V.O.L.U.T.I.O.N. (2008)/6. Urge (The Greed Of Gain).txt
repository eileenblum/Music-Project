[Solo:Gary Holt]

The mob wants what he can't get
Twisted minds, be somebody instead

Evil greed for the extreme
The chosen &amp; the damned supreme
The father and the man of god
For their nasty deeds they will rot

[Chorus:]
Urge - The greed of gain
Butchered nothing will remain
Warped minds will rise
If you can pay the god damned price
Urge - The greed of gain
Butchered nothing will remain

We all fear uncertainty
The ugly face of death
-Our most relevant fee

What would you do?
If this would come true?
Set time and place
Stash away without a trace

[Chorus]

Sadistic snuff movies - Disgust
Perverted escalation of lust

[Solo: Mike Sifringer]

Cupidity for domination
Mirror image of frustration

[Solo: Jeff Waters]

What would you do?
Do you have a clue?
Using your own wealth
To abuse others health?

[Chorus (x2)]

Malevolence!!!
