It's inside my brain
It drives me insane
It's eating me alive
Into the pits of black
A faithless payback?
Evil twisted mind!

Twisted reality
Makes me feel low
Blood driven infinity
Welcome to the freak show!

The symphony - is killing me...
The symphony
The savage symphony of terror

Narrow downright lad
Voices in my head
Strapped and buried
Killing deep dark hole
Burning lonely soul?
Prohibition is your foe!!!

To fate or to remain, a fatal part of the game
Would it change your role, if nirvana's just a dark hole?
