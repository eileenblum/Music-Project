Vendetta
Eternal train of Lucifer
The bloodthirst of the hypnotized masses
Scream for more gore and guts

Bloodshed of a conservative force
Death is selling well of course
Third world is an easy aim
Let's start the slaving game

In times of ignorance
It's the cruel who will decide
Of a life and death license
No chance to hide

Vendetta
Kill or be killed too much blood
Has already been spilled
Vendetta
The soul demands for revenge
Punish all of those who don't have the inner strength

Lustful blood and games
Pain has too many names
Fight fire with fire
Builds up a sad and cruel empire

In times of ignorance
It's the cruel who will decide
Of a life and death license
No chance to hide

Vendetta
Kill or be killed
Too much blood has already been spilled
Vendetta
The soul demands for revenge
Punish all of those who don't have the inner strength

How to sort out the difference
Between gravity and nonsense
In times of manipulation
Truth or imagination?

In times of ignorance
It's the cruel who will decide
Of a life and death license
No chance to hide

Vendetta
Kill or be killed
Too much blood has already been spilled
Vendetta
The soul demands for revenge
Punish all of those who don't have the inner strength

The blood thirst of the hypnotized masses
Screams for more gore and guts
The play is over ashes to ashes
The lucky survivor will go nuts.

Bloodshed of a conservative force
Death is selling well of course
Third world is an easy aim
Let's start the slaving game

In times of ignorance
It's the cruel who will decide
Of a life and death license
No chance to hide

Vendetta
Kill or be killed
Too much blood has already been spilled
Vendetta
The soul demands for revenge
Punish all of those who don't have the inner strength
