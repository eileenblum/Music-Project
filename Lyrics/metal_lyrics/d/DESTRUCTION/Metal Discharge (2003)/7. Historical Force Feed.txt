Biased till the last day
Till the day I have to die
To overcome the legacy
And asked my self - why?

Seeking for the truth that hides in the shady past
Our frightful past tense leads to the typecast

I've spoken out - accused and worried
Fucking bleed - historical force feed
I've been accused - without a deed
Sickening - historical force feed

Damned a before I could say knife
Cause of my breed
Statue - bared infamous action
By the dead and buried

Banning my tribe's past isn't a solution
We all know the bloody truth, e pay our contribution

Could I blame you for a commited crime of your kinship?
Do you think the son of a criminal desrves to get the whip?

We don't want to wash off the bloodon our nations hands
But don't sentence someone for his roots

Take a chance!
