This patriotic picture seems to be so real
Saviours fighting for the real big deal

Imposing heroes rescuing our holy planet
Illusive wartime propaganda gadget?

Freedom denied
Campaign of pride
Paragons made on the screen
Bloody war regime

Frustrating to foresee
Deceiving gutter policy
Spreading hate and rage
Desecrators of the new age

All they do mis fucking betray
Submission is all they can pray
Heroes of the front page
Desecrators of the new age

Nice entertainment is all you can you say?
This blood and sorrow is not a worldplay
