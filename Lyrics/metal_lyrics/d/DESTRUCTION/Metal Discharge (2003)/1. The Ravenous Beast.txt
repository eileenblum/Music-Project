The greedly gullet of the bigwig nations
Swallows all of our patience

In unity they fool the poor
Keen on cash like a cheap fucking whore

They're misplaying their winning game
Already forgot that we're all the same

Their acting under our flag
Awkward political greylag!

The ravenous beast...

...the claws of evil ripping the credulous poor apart

...the statement of claim ignored by those with a blackheart!

Wrapped up in lies
The ravenous beast

Seems education didn't teach us well
This ego mania leads into a bombshell

Disgrace surrounds me on those luckiy days
Cause soon the world will be ablaze

Only to give and to share luck
Keeps the unprivileged away from running amok
