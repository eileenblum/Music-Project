There wouldn't be good without the evil
No wisdom without stupid people
Would there be fear if we could be immortal?
Welcome to the opposition portal!

Don't we all hate the adjustment we make
suffering for your great fucking state
Is to compromise for a safe life a mistake?
Musical destruction is our outbreak

Metal discharge
Payback to all those losers
The armies of black will dictate
Metal discharge
All those years of torment
In a society that I do hate
Metal discharge

Payback to all those losers
The armies of black will dictate
Metal discharge

The opposition against all odds
Unbreakable, long-haired, noise-loving squads
The non-conform-metal power station
Grows slowly through nation and nation and nation

Metal discharge
Payback to all those losers
The armies of black will dictate
Metal discharge
All those years of torment
In a society that I do hate
Metal discharge

Payback to all those losers
The armies of black will dictate
Metal discharge

Once greeted with smiles
Cause of outrageous lifestyles
Our breed will resist all fake trends
Until this sad world ends!

Call it culture of the brain sick
Our press-ignored music
This cultural essence of noise
Keeps us watchful not to turn into toys!

There wouldn't be good without the evil
No wisdom without stupid people
Would there be fear if we could be immortal?
Welcome to the opposition portal!

Metal discharge
Payback to all those losers
The armies of black will dictate
Metal discharge
All those years of torment
In a society that I do hate
Metal discharge

Payback to all those losers
The armies of black will dictate
Metal discharge

Metal discharge
