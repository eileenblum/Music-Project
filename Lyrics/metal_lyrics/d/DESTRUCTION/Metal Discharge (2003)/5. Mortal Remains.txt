As I'm writing these lines
We're starting to breathe
Having the chance to spread the word
Seems a natural release

Difficult to resist
The moment of pleasure
Than doesn't exist
Temptation is leading to the abyss
Addicted to the sweet deadly kiss

Mortal remains - wallow in additional bloodstain
Mortal remains - hopeless life goes down to drain
Mortal remains - evil spiritual domain
Mortal remains
Remains

The chance to intimate
Will diminish my pain
Intellectual update
Will show if I'm not insane

Slaughtering my dreams
Nothing is like it seems
Suicide pride
Vague thoughts can't decide

Termenting your soul
No hope on parole
Death wish fates life
Victory of the inner strife!!!
