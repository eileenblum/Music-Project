Metal revolution - possessed we fight hand in hand
Sardonic aversions - only in union we stand
Depressive perspective - gives us a place to retreat
Never divided - no discussions stay to the roots
Real cultured - out of plastic - can't share their philosophies
Sarcasm and passion - we have our own forces
Dictators predators - won't rule our black hearts
Bestial invasion - explodes in our evil souls

[Bridge:]
They can't break our will
We have the pleasure to kill
We are bonded by blood
Again they will rot

[Chorus:]
Thrash 'til death
Thrash 'til death
Immortal soul takes control - immortal soul
Thrash 'til death
Immortal soul takes control - immortal soul
Thrash 'til death

Discover our history - this rebellion ain't a fuckin' trend
Stillborn music - swallow our self-defence
Metal revolution - possessed we fight hand in hand
Eternal conviction - only in union we stand

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]

Thrash 'til death!
