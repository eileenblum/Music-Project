Hate is all I feel
Disgust is a disease no one can heal
Frustration - no big deal
This suckin' life can't be fuckin' real
Salvation of our sanity
Is what they preach to the silly humanity
But greed and ignorance
Knocks down the level of my tolerance

[Bridge:]
I don't give a fuck if they endorse political crime
The crap they preach is just like a bad rhyme
Don't trust the one with the smile on the face
Or you'll disappear without a trace

[Pre:]
I Suffer from this curse - a verdict of my hate
You won't forget this verse - you can't change our fate
II You won't forget this words - no one can tell
Deep from my heart I shoot - bullets from hell
Bullets - bullets from hell
Bullets - bullets from hell
Bullets from hell

An ambush - I'm born to scream it out
I ain't no preacher - there's no fuckin' doubt
Listen - to this desperate words
Understand - I hit where it hurts

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat pre I &amp; II]

See - the nightmares I bring
Feel - the unholy sting
Smell - the fragrance of decay
Hear - my screams they will stay
[Repeat]

Bullets - bullets from hell [x4]
