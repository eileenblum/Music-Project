They protect our souls from war and pain
Don't fuck with them - nothin' will remain
They fight the good fight for their world peace
Save our Western Culture from unknown enemies
Military power pushed by the industries
Rain forest? Who cares about some fuckin' trees
This is for all our safety - this ain't no joke
They surely guard us - as long as they are broke

[Bridge:]
Land of the free - the land of decay
Amazing grace - kneel down and pray
Stars and lies - flag of pride
Ku Klux Klan at Disneyland

[Chorus:]
Race wars in a faked world
Hiding the truth there's no excuse
Dictators of cruelty
Dictators of cruelty

Fairytales and legends are the backbone of a land
Where controversial losers can be president
Nothin' like it seems on this Earth full of disgrace
Build your own opinion and see their ugly face!

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]

Dictators of cruelty!
