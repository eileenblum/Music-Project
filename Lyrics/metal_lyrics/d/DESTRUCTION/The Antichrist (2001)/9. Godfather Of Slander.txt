Deceivers - liars without soul
Preachers - without a holy goal
Deceivers - liars without soul
Preachers - without a holy goal
Traitors - lies build up their world
Betrayers - pangs of conscience never heard
Money - can't buy a healthy life
Diseases - where do they come from?
Money - can't buy a healthy life
They're breeding our death cheating on our wives
Diseases - where do they come from?
A dreadful sect full of sadistic greed

[Bridge:]
Looking for revelation
Poison minds have to die

[Chorus:]
Godfather of slander
Why don't you fuckin' surrender
Godfather of slander
Holy Christian pretender
[Repeat]

Headless - obeying the hopeless stream
Comprehend - they are victimized by their gods
Headless - obeying the masses
Comprehend - victimized by their gods
Let them rot!

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus x3]

Godfather
Godfather

[Repeat chorus]
