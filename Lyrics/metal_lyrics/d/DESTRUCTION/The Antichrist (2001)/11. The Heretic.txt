Black - black is the color that I adore
Dark - dark are my visions I'm in love with a whore
Reveal - reveal my reverence to no one
Call me - the ruffian the devil's son!
Cancer - I'm the cancer in your brain
Betrayer - I'm the one drives you insane
Sadistic - your depressions turn me on
Ain't diplomatic - slaughter is my regime
I'm the heretic!

[Chorus:]
I'm the heretic
Ain't diplomatic - you're so pathetic
And I piss on your church!
I'm the heretic
I ain't no preacher - no fuckin' teacher
The leech that sucks your life
Fear - the creeping fear in your daydreams
Deception - touch me nothing like it seems
Poison - I'm the poison running through your veins
Death - is my brother your last friend
I'm the heretic!

[Repeat chorus x2]

I'm the heretic
I'm the heretic
(The leech that sucks your life)
I'm the heretic
I'm the heretic
