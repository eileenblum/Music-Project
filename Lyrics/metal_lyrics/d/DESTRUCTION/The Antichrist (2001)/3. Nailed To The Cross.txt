The cold wind of death
Makes you freeze to the bone
The scary final breath
Leaves only cuts in the stone

[Bridge:]
Fear the unknown spheres - of death and decay
Incite the superstition - the booty of fear

[Chorus:]
Your book of God - a book of lies
Your hero's death - brought us a 1,000 cries!
Nailed to the cross [x3]

Nailed to the fuckin' cross!
They use fear like the press
In the book of deceit
Kneel down and confess
Weak losers need to retreat

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]

The sign of the cross is the sign of war
The holy symbol has been used for more
Since we remember his promotion campaign
Is collecting lost souls for a unholy aim!
Greedy bastards with blood on their hands
Hiding in churches and loosing their stand
Your book of God - a book of lies
Your hero's death - brought us a 1,000 cries!
Nailed to the cross [x7]
Nailed - failed - nailed
Nailed to the cross
Nailed - failed - nailed
Nailed to the fuckin' cross!
