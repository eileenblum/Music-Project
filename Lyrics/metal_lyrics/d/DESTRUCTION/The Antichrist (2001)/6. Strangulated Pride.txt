A pitch dark night - smells like suicide
I hold the key - of my own death
Pounding pain - will my soul remain?
Strangulated pride - purgatory

[Bridge:]
I can hear their laughter - fabulous desaster
Running dry!
Betrayed by many names - they are playing games
Purgatory!

[Chorus:]
What the hell is going on - I go fuckin' wrong
(Strangulated pride)
Murphy's Law cuts down - everything to the ground
(Strangulated pride)
Wanna share my pain - deadly is my middle name
(Strangulated pride)

But I will resurface - you will feel my wrath
I'm a disgrace - count my last days
I run out of luck - all my friends disappear
Unaccountable misery - it's getting too intense
My fate is sealed - agony's my best friend

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]

I refuse to accept - this cultured epidemic
My self-confidence - beats my worst enemies!

[Repeat bridge]

What the hell is going on - I go fuckin' wrong
(Strangulated pride)
Murphy's Law cuts down - everything to the ground
Strangulated pride
Strangulated pride
