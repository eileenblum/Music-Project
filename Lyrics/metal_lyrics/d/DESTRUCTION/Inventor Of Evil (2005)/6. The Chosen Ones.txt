Speculations, rumours or lies?
The circle of blood and force
Under the seal of secrecy
Ritual acts - no remorse

Call them: skull and bones
Scroll and key
Call them: wolf's head
Book and snake

They rob - spread fear - they swat
They lie - oppress - they garrot
The chosen ones - the slaughter mob
They rob - spread fear - they swat
They lie - oppress - they garrot
The chosen ones - the slaughter mob

Bonemen of secret soceties
The hall of fame and the rich
Domination without varieties
Legal aggression - to go off without a hitch

Call them: skull and bones
Scroll and key
Call them: wolf's head
Book and snake

Conquering fear - the attainment of power by killing
The end is near - and if you're not willing?

The slaughter seems to be teachable
The dignity of men is unimpeachable

Speculations, rumours or lies?
Conspiracy theories - desperate cries?
Missuse of power doesn't pay?
The network of lies rules us all - runaway!
