Diabolical - dominating the gentle sex
Systematically - destroying to forget
Twisted evil - nasty and rotten to the core
Avenger of those who are unable to adore

Disability - to share love and forgive
No facility - cause my memory like a sieve
Darker than black -my ego rules my sphere
Despair and fear - is my goddamned riotgear

Welcome!
Welcome to the mans land
Where your partners your archenemy
Welcome to the mans land
Where your tortured soul will find a decree
Bear all the soul torment the twisted fatal banshee
Only in no mans land the bitch will pay her final fee

Diabolical - my insane mind needs soulfood
Super critical - with yourself cause you've been screwed
A desperate creature which is trying to forget
In no mans land - there is no need to fuckin' fret

An avenger of those who are unable to adore
A wounded fighter that is still able to score

A unique individual should never close the door
No need to prostitute, to sell your lifestyle like a whore

An avenger of those who are unable to adore
There's no need to prostitute
To sell your lifestyle like a whore
