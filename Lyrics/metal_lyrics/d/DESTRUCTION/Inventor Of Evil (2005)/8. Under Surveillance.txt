We vote for murderers
That try to achieve world domination
Do you really think progression work's without manipulation?

We're praying the devils in the "so called" houses of god
But how much would you do to get the best slot?

Elbow society - arent's we built on variety
Eat my fist and die - humanity seems a lie

Under surveillance - controlled mass idealism
Under surveillance - who really needs patriotism
A lack of culture that feeds the war machine
Under surveillance - devent your fast fading
Dream!

We're obey fake idols without knowing their aims
Paragons, referees and official play false games
Why do we believe in heroes that make us shiver?
Declaration of bankrputcy - stand and deliver

Elbow society - arent's we built on variety
Eat my fist and die - humanity seems a lie

Under surveillance - controlled mass idealism
Under surveillance - who really needs patriotism
A lack of culture that feeds the war machine
Under surveillance - devent your fast fading
