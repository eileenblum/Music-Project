My service is beyond your belief
More than you can ever achieve
I am the cleaner of the human filth
Unattainable fucking thrills

[Chorus:]
Hiding the fear, scoring my dream
Eliminating with self-esteem
Speak your last wish.

Bringer of anguish
[Repeat]
...killing machine!

I'm feeding the pain
I'm going totally insane
I'm the bringer of anguish
The trigger is my fucking language

[Chorus]

You're marching into disaster
Can't you hear my nasty laughter.

[Chorus]

Sort the scum of the bloody earth
Waste disposal is my curse!

[Chorus]
