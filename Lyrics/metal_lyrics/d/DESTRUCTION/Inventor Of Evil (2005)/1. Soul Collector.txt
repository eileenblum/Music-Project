Soul Collector
Scary, evil, dark and mean
Holy master of the supreme
Lord of delusion spreading fear
Those who disagree will disappear

Havoc and haze
Bleeding restless till the last days

Detector - Soul Collector
Detector - Detector of Sin

The misanthropic mystery
Will go down in history
Ruthless fighting common sense
Aggression is getting too immense

Intoxication of power a cold white line
A question of honour - Evil or divine?
Imperial ecstasy is erasing my mind
INVENTOR OF EVIL - A reflection of Mankind
