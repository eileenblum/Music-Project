Radical minds in times of decay
Are rising like a beast of prey
In a decade full of change &amp; hate
The fatal mistake is to oppress and dictate

Uneducated poor lower class
Need support and not tear gas
They will defect and act extreme
If someone takes their self-esteem

Realize-the desperate cries
Of the tyrannized or the pessimists will rise!

No-no signs-no signs of repentance
Be warned - be warned - don't take our independence

If you gonna take our pride
Check history as a guide
See what happens to the ones
That betrayed their race &amp; sons

Realize-the desperate cries
Of the tyrannized or the pessimists will rise!

No-no signs-no signs of repentance
Be warned - be warned - don't take our independence

Realize-the desperate cries
Of the tyrannized or the pessimists will rise!

No - no signs - no signs of repentance
Be warned - be warned - don t take our independence
No-no signs-no signs of repentance
Be warned - be warned don't take our independence
