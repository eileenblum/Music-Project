She got the innocent face of an angel
But the mind of an evil raping carnivore
How comes I could not tell?
How could I not hear the death knell?

Eyes of believe and virginity
Coldhearted black soul of bestial cruel lust
How comes I could not tell?
How could I not hear the death knell?

Pretender-liar &amp; soul-stealer
Life sucker - perverted kneeling squealer

I call you angel of death
A bloody whore!
Beast of prey!
Genital discount store-carnivore!

Depraving &amp; corrupting
-an actor on the bad side of faith
Distrust &amp; warnings could not avoid the disgrace!

How comes I could not tell?
How could I not hear the death knell?

Pretender -liar &amp; soul-stealer
Life sucker - perverted kneeling squealer

I call you angel of death
A bloody whore!
You re a beast of prey
Genital discount store-a carnivore!

Distrust wasn't enough to be safe
You're an actor on the bad side of faith
One day all your lies will decay!
It's pay back time on doomsday

Pretender - liar &amp; soul - stealer
Life sucker - perverted kneeling squealer

I call you angel of death
A bloody whore!
You re a beast of prey
Genital discount store - a carnivore!

You caught me in a sexual cage!
All you live for is for the upstage!
One day all your lies will decay!

Carnivore - a bloody whore - carnivore!
