We all look for affection
and feel the need to succeed
We wonder why others fail
'cause we're the best of breed
We play our roles and act
pleasant and fake
The human factor has diminished
A fatal mistake

Eliminate 
all your weakness called trust
Suffocate 
on your desire and disgust

Hellride
Cyanide dreams
Looks like suicide
Cyanide dreams
Hellride
Cyanide dreams
Looks like suicide

Your deeds will not count
in the final end
Your hope made you think
you are godsent?
A big mistake to trust
and give away your pride
With backs to the wall
dreams will collide

Eliminate
all your weakness called trust
Suffocate
on your desire and disgust

Hellride
Cyanide dreams
Looks like suicide
Cyanide dreams
Hellride
Cyanide dreams
Looks like suicide

Cyanide
My vengeance 
makes you sleep little creep
Cyanide
Enjoy the silence 
slow and deep

Cyanide
Taste my revenge
Nothing's like it seems
Cyanide
Eternal peace
No more screams

In a world of winners
there ain't no place for disbelief
Run like a well-oiled machine
or numb with grief
Strength of demand
Is a gift you have to earn
We are on this bloody world
to fuckin' learn!

Eliminate
all your weakness called trust
Suffocate
on your desire and disgust

Hellride
Cyanide dreams
Looks like suicide
Cyanide dreams
Hellride
Cyanide dreams
Looks like suicide
