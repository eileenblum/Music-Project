We grew up in a time
The scene was on the rise
We all had the same ideas
All of us, on various tribes

Injection of the zombie attack
In the sign of evil
All guns were blazing
For a breaking new brutal sound!

From sentence of death to hell awaits!
From war and pain into the crypts of raids!

Legacy of the past
Sonic counter blast
Legacy of the past
The legend will last!

fanzines and tape traders

Brought up by crazy haters
Bloody young metal punks
Create a new underground

Ignored by the mainstream mob
Sacrifice and slowly we rot
Bold, wild and surprising
Unstoppable-the scene was rising!

From sentence of death to hell awaits!
From war and pain into the crypts of raids!

Legacy of the past
Sonic counter blast
Legacy of the past
The legend will last

Feel the fire of british steel
No mercy kill'em all was the deal
Not afraid of the ignorance
In a life without sense!

Make the metal blade stand tall
Agent orange will never fall
After the chemical invasion
Eternal devastation!

From sentence of death to hell awaits!
From war and pain into the crypts of raids!

Legacy of the past
Sonic counter blast
Legacy of the past
The legend will last
Legacy of the past
Filth hounds of hades
Legacy of the past
The legend will last
