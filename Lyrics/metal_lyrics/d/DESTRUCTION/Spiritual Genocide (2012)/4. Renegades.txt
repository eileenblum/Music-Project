It's too late when we realize
That our life is turning counter - clockwise

The clock is running down against your will
Are you aware to be caught in the mill?

Our values are a freakin' marketing campaign
Can an individual really sustain?

We can not recover - from mistakes others made
We can not accept - breakdown of the renegades
We can not be feasting - when others die by the blade
We can not accept - breakdown of the renegades

You are caught in the web of lies
Will your beloved tolerate your disguise?
You can not turn back the wheel of time
Confess that there is no victimless crime!
Our values are a freaking marketing campaign
Can an individual really sustain?

We can not recover - from mistakes others made
We can not accept- breakdown of the renegades
We can not be feasting - when others die by the blade
We can not accept - breakdown of the renegades

What is the most precious thing in your life?
To prevail be honest or to survive?

What is the most precious thing in your life?
To benefit
- take centre stage or to spend time right?

We can not recover - from mistakes others made
We can not accept - breakdown of the renegades
We can not be feasting - when others die by the blade
We can not accept - breakdown of the renegades

Breakdown-breakdown!
