We are blessed cause we all go in the end
It's makes no sense to betray and pretend
We are blessed cause we all go in the end
Itâs makes no sense to betray and pretend

In a world that needs a new hero every day
The main goal is the headline needs to fuckin slay
We are lustful pigs - keen on a new sensation
Sucking up enjoying our own desecration

Death - there is one thing we can't betray
Safe to say - to dust to dust to dust
To dust we will decay
To dust - to dust - to dust even if we pray!
To dust to dust to dust
To dust we will decay

Take my advise and be more than prepared
On Judgment day nothing will be shared
Asked yourself if life is just one scam
Why the hell do you really give a damn?

In a world that needs a new hero every day
The main goal is the headline needs to fuckin slay
We are lustful pigs keen on a new sensation
Sucking up enjoying our own desecration

Death - there is one thing we can't betray
Safe to say to dust to dust to dust
To dust we will decay
To dust to dust - to dust - even if we pray!
To dust-to dust to dust
To dust we will decay

What's the meaning of our system if we can't enjoy
Time that is given to us to make the best of being a toy!

In a world that needs a new hero every day
The main goal is the headline needs to funkin' slay
We are all lustful pigs - keen on a new sensation
Sucking up and enjoying our own desecration

Death - there is one thing we can't betray
Safe to say to dust to dust to dust
To dust we will decay
To dust - to dust to dust - even if we pray!
To dust -to dust to dust
To dust we will decay
