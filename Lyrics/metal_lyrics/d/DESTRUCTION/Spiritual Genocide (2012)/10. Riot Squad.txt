A decision, a moment in time
Will destroy your life or make it mine
Realize that every second will count
In a world that's in its final round, in its final round!

Plan your future for what reason?
Soon there will be dying season
We take control back from Satan's host
Or do you believe in the holy ghost?

When society is in pledge
It's always a dance on the razor's edge
History proves we need a collapse
To stop the lunacy of a relapse

We need martyrs willing to die for the goal
We need avengersâa scare off patrol

Riot squadâunleash the dogs of war
Riot squadâa warning they can't ignore
Riot squadâunleash the dogs of war
Riot squad!!!

Their fate will be ugly when it's time to go
No one will believe it's the final show

If there's no fear for the consequences
There will be no more safety fences

We need martyrs willing to die for the goal
We need avengersâa scare off patrol

Riot squadâunleash the dogs of war
Riot squadâa warning they can't ignore
Riot squadâunleash the dogs of war
Riot squad!!!

If nobody shows them the boundary lines
Despising
They will continue to rule like swine
Uprising

The cloud of compliance need to become
Despising
A wave of vengeance cause we are second to none
Uprising

A decision, a moment in time
Will destroy your life or make it mine
Realize that every second will count
In a world that's in its final round

We need martyrs willing to die for the goal
We need avengersâa scare off patrol

Riot squadâunleash the dogs of war
Riot squadâa warning they can't ignore
Riot squadâunleash the dogs of war
Riot squad!!
