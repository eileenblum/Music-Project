[Music: Hirax, Lyrics: Mortis]

People tried drugs
What's happened
What does it mean
Death is near
Every day
Need drugs
Rotten brains
Rotten brains
No job
No life
No love
No happiness
Without money
Forced kill
Lost humanity
Wictory of drugs
Life in hospital
Time for death
Crying body
Without help
Sorrow family
Vacant school
Full mortuary
Victory of drugs
Fucking life
Children of drugs
Health business
Fucking drugs

In 1995 band name was changed to Lunatic Gods.
