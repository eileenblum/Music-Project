[Music: Hirax, Psycho, King, Lyrics: Mortis]

I loved forest
I loved river
I loved nature
I loved my country
Now is nothing
Only dead silence
Come gold age
Everything will be back
I am waiting for death
With my lost love
Who I am, why I am
My life for nothing
Politic business
Destruction of everything
Where I am
Always I am
Immortal government
One from thousands
In rotten human society
My crying heart
My lost dreams
My lost love
Never more
I don't think
It will be better
Come holy terror
Everything will be black
I am waiting for death
With my lost love
Lost love
