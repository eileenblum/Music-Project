[Music: Hirax, Psycho, Lyrics: Mortis]

Born here
Man without justice
Degraded and hungry
Slave of age
It I am, and my body
Close my eyes
Forever
I can't see the world
I am closed here
Without justice
I can't think
What is there
And my body
Without dreams
With rotting head
Years of misery
I am survive here
And my future
Is in darkness
I stayed alone
Slave of age
Fucking life
