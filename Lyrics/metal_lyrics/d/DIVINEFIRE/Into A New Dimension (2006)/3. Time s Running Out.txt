Do not fear, you're not alone
I am right here
Call on me I'm on the line
Keep my commands; I'm on your side
This world is bound in chains, I know
You are my servants
Believe in me
I'll set you free

Seasons will come
Seasons will pass
Only one will remain
He paid the price for your souls
Nations will rise
Nations will fall
Time's running out
Be prepared when He comes
Time's running out
Running out for the world

The world is worshipping their throne
of gold and silver
They're blind leading blind
Listen to me and you will see
So much suffering around
My heart is crying
When I see the world's falling down

Time's running out
Time's running out
