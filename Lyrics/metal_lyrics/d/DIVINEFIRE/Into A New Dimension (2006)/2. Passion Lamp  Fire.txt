We are here to deliver you a wonderful message
We're united forever and we're not gonna lose it
Feel the power is rising
We're deceiving the liar
In God's name we have shelter
Into the light forever

Here we come and we're marching on
In His name we'll never be the same

We rock- We will never stop
With passion and fire
We rock 'til we've reached our goal
With Holy Ghost power
We rock

We are waiting for Heaven
No more tears and sorrow
In the Spirit we're children of our Heavenly Father
We will aim for the future
with a passion that never ends
We will do it forever
We'll never be the same again

We rock- We will never stop
With passion and fire
We rock 'til we've reached our goal
With Holy Ghost power
We rock- we will never stop
Higher and higher
We rock 'til we've reached our goal
With Holy Ghost power
We rock

We rock for the King
Worthy is your name
You're the fire in my heart

There's no one like you
You are Alpha and Omega
No, there's no one like you
and we rock for the King
