Following His footsteps
It's not an easy way to go
I'll never stop fighting
I'm a messenger in these times

Loud and proud
I'll bring the fire on

I'm living on the edge
I want to be alive
I'll never give in
I want to be alive
I'm living on the edge
I want to be alive
I'll never give up
I want to be alive

I'll wait for the moment
When my burdens are forever gone
My temple is ready
I'll spread my wings
My time has come

Hold on to the fire
He'll show me the way
I'm not afraid
I enter the kingdom
His blood has paid the price
Jesus is alive
He has paid the price

He's alive
Alive
