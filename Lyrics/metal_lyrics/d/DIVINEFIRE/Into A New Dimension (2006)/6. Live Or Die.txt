I've lived my life by my own rules
I want to be my God
Still the emptiness is there
I cried out asking why
If you're out there, hear me now
Save me Jesus before I die

Live or die
I see it clear
The Son of man is calling me
The hour is striking
Need oil for my light
Live or die
I have no fear
The son of man is calling me
There's no time to lose
I'll follow His way
Its live or die
Live or die

Read the Book of life today
And hear the Spirit speak
Seek and you will find the way
If you believe in He who gives
The living water for your soul
The living water for your soul

The Son is rising
All is calm
