I feel it's something in the air
The time is right
I am prepared
I have been waiting for this day so long
Your Holy Word is coming true
The force of darkness fades away
The lion's roar of freedom marks the way

The day is here
I'm running into a new dimension
This is the moment of my life
I see the light
No turning back
I'm running into a new dimension
This is the moment of my life
I'll follow your light

I'm proud to show the world the truth
With love I'm sharing this with all
The gift of life is free for everyone
My heart is singing out your name
You are the way to eternity
You conquered death
The final victory

Prince of peace
Lords of Lord
Glory to the Son of Man
