All for one in His service

We're not strong on our own
It's time to unite
Our world is so desperate and cold

Desperate and cold
A world without hope
It's time to unite
Taking control
Heavenly servants
Stand up and fight
Now is the time to turn darkness to light

We all have burdens to bear
It's heavy I know
Together we meet the future with better protection
We are brothers
We are sisters
All for one in His service

We wait for the King
He's our heavenly hope
He shows us the way to the Father
who sits on the throne

We are brothers
We are sisters
All for one in His service
We are brothers
We are sisters
In Christ we are strong

History has shown
So many heroes have died
Only one has returned from the shadows of death and
He's alive
