Five people were killed
Our world is going mad
And it's hard to understand
I close my eyes and hide my face
My tears are falling down
Our world is a living hell
We were born to love
Pay it forward and you will see
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to fight
And my Spirit leads me right
I want to see a change
I remember the times when I was young
Those sunny days seem so far away
I see the sky is grey and I can't see the sun
I'm longing for a change
To face another day
We were born to love
Pay it forward and you will see
Where is my heart
Where is my love
Where is my heart
(Where is your heart)
Where is my love
(Where is your love)
I'm a victim of this time
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to fight
And my Spirit leads me right
I want to see a change
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to fight
And the Spirit leads me right
Love will show the way
I'm ready to fight
We were born to love
Love will show the way
