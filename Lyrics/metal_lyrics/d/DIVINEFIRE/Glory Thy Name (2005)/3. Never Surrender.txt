Here I am, I'm not alone
I'm fighting 'til the end
I hear the sound, I see the flames
The battle has begun
Keep my life, be mercifull
I'm nothing without you
Teach me now, give me a sign
I'm calling out your name

I will go, never stop (never stop)
I will go for the top (for the top)
I will go, never stop (never stop)
I'll never surrender, never surrender

Soon the day will come (soon the day will come)
When the son will take us home (he will take us home)
No more tears, no pain (no more tears no pain)
We are free again

Time is short, am I prepared
To leave this world behind
No more lies, no more tears
Your love's the only way
I see your throne and righteousness
And all belongs to you
You are the One, the Mighty King
And hallowed be Thy name

I am the way (I am the way)
I am the truth (I am the truth)
I am the life - I'm the key to eternity
