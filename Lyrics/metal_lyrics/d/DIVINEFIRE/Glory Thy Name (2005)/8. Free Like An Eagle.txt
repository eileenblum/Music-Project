[Bonustrack For Japan]

Free like an eagle
My eyes are red and open wide
Those scars everywhere I see
I'm thinking about the other side
I'm scared but I know I'm gonna be
I'm the lock and key, so many wasted years
Free like an eagle, flying high above the clouds
Free and nothing's gonna tear me apart
Free like an eagle, flying high above the clouds
Free 'cause the winds of fame forever left my heart
Free like an eagle
I'm cold and my hands are shaking
Sweat doomed end up really fast
I'm crying and my heart is acheing
So death came to me at last
Kiss my kids goodbye, from then we love and care
And don't cry any tear for me, you know I'm gonna be...
Free like an eagle flying high above the clouds
Free and nothing's gonna tear me apart
Free like an eagle flying high above the clouds
Free 'cause the winds of fame forever left my heart
Free like an eagle
I'm flying high, I wonder why this is happening to me
I'm free again, I'm out again
I'm out of control
Free like an eagle flying high above the clouds
Free and nothing's gonna tear me apart
Free like an eagle flying high above the clouds
Free 'cause the winds of fame forever left my heart
Free like an eagle
