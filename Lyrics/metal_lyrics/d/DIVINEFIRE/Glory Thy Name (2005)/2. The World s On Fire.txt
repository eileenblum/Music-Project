See The Light
Looking for the answer now
I can feel the fire burning inside of me
Chaos and warfare rules the world
The battle rages on will we ever see the end
Death and violence
All hell is breaking loose
The world's on fire
Flames burning higher
Time to realize the end is near
The world's on fire
Flames burning higher
Time to face the truth - it's up to you
I see the warning signs tonight
The time is running out and the Son is coming
Salvation for this broken world
The price is paid for you
Recieve the healing touch
