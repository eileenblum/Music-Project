Live my life for you
Time after time and day after day
Learning my lesson every day
The Holy Spirit is guiding my way
In his presence I'll always stay
You are the light
You're shining so bright
You are the reason I'm still alive
I'll live my life for the Holy One
The cross has set me free
Live my life for the Holy One
Hear the music coming on strong
It gives me strength to carry on
You are my fire and my solid rock
Now and forever I'll never stop
