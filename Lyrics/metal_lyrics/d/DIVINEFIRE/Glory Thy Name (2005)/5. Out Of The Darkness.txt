I was out in the cold
I was searching for the answer
My life's a total mess
My race for fortune and fame
It was the total dream
And all I got was city stress
I want out of the darkness (Glory thy Name)
And into your light
Through fire and water (Open my eyes)
Please show me what's right
I was moving around
And everything was black
Life tasted bitter sweet
They left me out in the cold
I don't know where to go
All I got was city stress
