Thoughts spin around in my head
I hear the voices, I'm out of control
Confusion, I can't hear the voice
I'm trapped inside my cage, I can't see the light

[Hubertus]
"Forget your inner voice
There's noone there
There is no God, Son and Holy Gost
Believe in yourself, that's all "hahaha"

[Rivel]
God hear my call
You've been through it all
You are still alive
True spirit of love, true spirit of life
I want to seve and to love
Give me the wisdom
And the Spirit of truth
Help me to see through it all
You are the Spirit
You light up my life

[Hubertus]
"Forget your inner voice
There's noone there
There is no God, Son and Holy Gost
Believe in yourself, that's all "hahaha"
God hear my call
You've been through it all
You are still alive
True spirit of love, true spirit of life
God hear my call
You've been through it all
You are my life
My only Salvation

[Clayton]
And I will bring about whatever you ask in my name,
So that the father may be glorified in the Son
I will do whatever you ask in my name
If you love me, keep my commands
And I shall ask the father and he will give you another Helper to stay with you forever,
The Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive,
Because it neither perceives nor understands Him.
You know Him for He remains with you and will be within you.
I shall not leave you as orphans; I shall come to you.
In a little while the world will no longer see me;
For I live and you too will live.
In that day you will know that I am in my Father
And you in me and I in you.

[Rivel]
Confusion and despair
I can't see the light
Confusion and despair
Show Me The Way
