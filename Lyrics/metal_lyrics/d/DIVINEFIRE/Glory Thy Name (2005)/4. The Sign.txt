Now I see the sign
The sunrise of my life
Darkness fades away
A new day has begun
Looking for the answer to the meaning of my life
It's hard to see the future when the love is gone
The media is sending out a message to the world
It's time to analyse it before it breaks me down
I close my eyes
I say my prayer
Dear God save me from this hell
Now I see the sign
The sunrise of my life
Darkness fades away
A new day has begun
Running for the price, I want to be a star
No matter what it costs I want to be the one
Soon I realize this is not the end for me
The Creator of my life touched my empty soul
The Lord is my shepard
I shall not lack
He makes me to lie down
In green pastures
He leads me beside restfull water
He revives my soul
He leads in path of righteousness
For his name's sake.
[Psalm 23:1-3]
