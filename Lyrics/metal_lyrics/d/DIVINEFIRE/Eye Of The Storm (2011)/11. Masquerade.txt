Living, loving, teach me now
Asking all these questions in the final hour
I'm burning out, I'm dying now
Need to change me my life
Before the race is over

See me, Clean me
I'm so lost without you
See me, clean me
Give me one more try

Welcome to my masquerade
Welcome, it is a dangerous game

Hear me crying out for love
Need to see your light in my darkest hour
I feel my body's crashing down
Need your peace inside
I'am a wounded soldier
