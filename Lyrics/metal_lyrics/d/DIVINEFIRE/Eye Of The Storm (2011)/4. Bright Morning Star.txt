Carpe Diem
Catch the moment before it's gone
Live your life and live it now
Don't worry about tomorrow
Put your trust in God
He cares for your life and your soul

Shelter me when the storm wind comes
Carry me when I'm falling, no hope in sight

Bright morning star
You're the flame that lives in me
Bright morning star
Your shining light and darkness flee

Today is given, so much living to be done
Don't let your heart be hardened
Stay close the truth
You are the anchor, always securing me
My salvation, my refuge, my solid rock

For God so loved the world
That he gave his only begotten son
That whoever believes in him
Shall not nerish but fave eternal fire
