Lord, here I am
I will work for you
And follow your kingdom
Show me how to love

Send me out
I'am not afraid, I'll go your way
Finally I got the strenght
I am your messenger
Nothing in this world can stop me now
Finally Lord, send me out!

God, oh my God let me be
Your heavenly servant
Give me wisdom to see
Show me how to love
