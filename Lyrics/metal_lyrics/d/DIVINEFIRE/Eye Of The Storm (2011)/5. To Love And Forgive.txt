Walking up cold sweat in my bed
My body is shaking with fear
Reached for solutions but stranded again
Please father give me the truth

To love and forgive
When something goes wrong
Tell me why is it so hard and
We are all blinded and can't see beyond
The ego is strong, our pride is our jail

Ah - ah, lord give me freedom
To love and forgive
Ah - ah, show me your mercy
I want to be free
Ah - ah, lord give me freedom
To love and forgive
Ah - ah, show me your mercy
I need to be free

I bow my head (I bow my head)
I bow my heart (before your throne)
Your presence fills me
You amaze me with your love

Want to destroy the altar I built
Forgive me for my unbelief
I worshiped the things created by man
Now I can see clear, renew me again
