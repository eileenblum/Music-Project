Face to face with sin
I know what's right, what's wrong
Let the inner man point out my way

Better think once, better think twice
Somethings inside says stay away
Somethings inside says stay away
I was blind, but now I see
He gave me love,
He gave me strenght
To unchain my soul

Everyday's a race
Be careful what you take in
Let the love grow strong in your heart

I know the spirit's leading
My eyes are closed, I am not afraid
Hold on, hold on
We have the power of the cross
