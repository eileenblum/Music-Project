November rain, all is cold and grey
My heart's been shaken
Help me see your way

You hear my prayers
You see the poor in spirit

Even at my lowest point
There's one way to go
I will survive
Even at my lowest point

There's hope to find
Your word is strengthen me
I made my mistakes
But I never lost my faith in you

I can give you whatever you want
I can give you women and gold
Just give me your soul, just give it to me
Ha Ha

I carry on, until the work is done
One day I will see the throne
I carry on, I am your daughter I am your son
My father, you'll never leave me alone
