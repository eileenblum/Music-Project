The world is sinking fast
Faster then we thought
Are you ready to face
The consequences?
We are acting so wrong

There is still time
We have to change our lives
Still time for salvation
Only Jesus can wash our sins away
Still there is time

The stage is yours, the spotlight's on
Time to deliver the breaking news
I know it's so hard to hear the truth
When Jesus comes itâs far too late

Chaos all around
Fear consuming lives
Inner turmoil blinded senses
Destruction is at hand
