Praying, caring
Living, sharing
See the lonely people
Heart's are bleeding
What's the meaning?
See the lonely people

Hold on to what you believe in
Hold on, God cares for everyone
Hold on, we're the new generation
Hold on and don't lose your heart

Give a call, a helping hand
See the lonely people
We all need love, this could be you
See the lonely people

We are not alone, we're not forsaken
All we need is to call for his presence
We are the ones that crossed the line
Please help us out of darkness into your light
You're not alone, come walk with me
