Here I am, I'm not alone
I fight until the end
I hear the sound, I see the flames
the battle has begun
Lead my life with mercy, Lord
I'm nothing without You
Teach me now to be a sign
I'm calling out your name

I will go never stop
I will go for the top
I will go never stop
I'll never surrender, never surrender

Soon the day will come (soon the day will come)
When the Son will take us home (He will take us home)
No more tears, no pain (no more tears no pain)
We are free again

Time is short, and I prepare
To leave this world behind
No more lies, no more tears
Your love is the only way
I see your throne of righteosness
And all belongs to You
You are the One, the Mighty King
And hallowed be thy name

I will go never stop
I will go for the top
I will go never stop
I'll never surrender, never surrender

Soon the day will come (soon the day will come)
When the Son will take us home (He will take us home)
No more tears, no pain (no more tears no pain)
We are free again

I am the way (I am the truth)
I am the truth (I am the truth)
I am the life, I'm the key to eternity
I am the way (I am the truth)
I am the truth (I am the truth)
I am the life, I'm the key to eternity
I am the way

I will go never stop
I will go for the top
I will go never stop
I'll never surrender, never surrender

Soon the day will come (soon the day will come)
When the Son will take us home [He will take us home)
No more tears, no pain (no more tears no pain)
We are free again
