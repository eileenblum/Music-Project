Welcome, it's time for the show
The balance is hard to find
We all have to face who we are in the end
Let's start
The show must go on

I'm not afraid to see it
My faith keeps me strong

I lift my voice to the sky
You're my passion, my fire, my light
You are my shield
My secret weapon

Into the future we run
No time for reflection at all
Where can I rest my tired soul
The pace of this world, Out of control

I am leaving the desert
Heading for holy water
Oh... Holy water
I need protection in this moment
Shelter me through the shadows
