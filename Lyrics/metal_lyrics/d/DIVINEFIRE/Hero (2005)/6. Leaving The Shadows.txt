Day by day, night by night
Take my time and my fruits will be fine
I am alive, just feel the fire
Right or wrong
He will show me the way

Now is the time of my life
Don't you know the judgment day is near

No more sorrow
No more tears
No more pain
Leave the shadows behind
No more sorrow
No more tears
My sins are forgiven
Salvation for mankind
I'm leaving the shadows behind

He is coming, he is shining
The final reason I'm singing this song
I am alive, just feel the fire
Right or wrong
He's the bright morning star
