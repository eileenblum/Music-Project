All alone the way
You've been there for me
Never feeling lonely
Every single moment
You're looking out for me
You are the burning fire
That lives inside of me

I'm living in this world
The time is very closer
Closer to the end
But I know my heart... yeah!

You saved me, You guide me
I never understand your Love
You are the Hero of my life
You love, You see me
You are the Master of it all
You are the Hero of my live
The Hero of my life

I face another day
And hold on to your flame
You're the One and Only
Every since that day
When I gave my heart to you
You are the One who sees
The man I want to be

I'm living in this world
The time is very closer
Closer to the end
But I know my heart

You saved me, You guide me
I never understand your Love
You are the Hero of my life
You love, You see me
You are the Master of it all
You are the Hero of my live
The Hero of my life
