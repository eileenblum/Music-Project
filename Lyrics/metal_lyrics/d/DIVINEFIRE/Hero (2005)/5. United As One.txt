I'm looking for a better world
People crying out for help
Need your love to do things right
You know I want to follow you
And show the world freedom
Death will be no more

Time to move on
Together we're strong
We believe in the son
Everyone's invited
Faith, hope and love
And his heavenly grace
We're united as one
Yeah, the door is open

Sometimes it's hard to see the way
When the world is crashing down
Keep the faith and don't give up
He will wipe away your tears
Hear your desperate prayers
He's been through it all
