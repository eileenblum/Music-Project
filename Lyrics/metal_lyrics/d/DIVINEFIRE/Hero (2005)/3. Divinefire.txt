My life is not as easy as it seems
Now it's black as the ace of spades
I try to do the best I can
To serve your name
In a brutal world where the ego serves

I look up to the sky
And I raise my voice
And pray for wisdom
Give me answers to my questions

Divinefire
You give me eyes to see
Divinefire
Give me love for the broken ones
Divinefire
I'll serve you night and day
Divinefire
My life belongs to you

How far can I go
Before it is too late
I feel so lost in the dark
My ego wants it all
No room for mercy
No room for love

I look up to the sky
And I raise my voice
And pray for wisdom
Give me answers to my questions

Divinefire
You give me eyes to see
Divinefire
Give me love for the broken ones
Divinefire
I'll serve you night and day
Divinefire
My life belongs to you

Destroy my ego
Destroy, destroy
Destory my ego
Destory it now

Divinefire - Yeah, give me eyes to see
Divinefire - give me love for the broken ones
Divinefire - I'll serve you night and day
Divinefire - my life belongs to you
