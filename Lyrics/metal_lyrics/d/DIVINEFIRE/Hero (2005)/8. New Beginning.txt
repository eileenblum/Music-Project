Afraid to live
Afraid to die
Seize the moment
You're alive

Let the music take you far away

Time to live
Enjoy your life
Hear the music from above
It's a new beginning
Time to live
Seize the day
See the future with new eyes
It's a new beginning

We're here to rock
Show you the force
Seize the moment
You're alive

Rise my child
Don't give up
Rise my child
Don't give up
Rise my child
Time to live
The time is yours

You hear the music and you'll remember
Only you can change your life
Only you
