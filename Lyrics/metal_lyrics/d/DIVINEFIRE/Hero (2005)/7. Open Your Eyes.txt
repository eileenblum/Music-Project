I wanna see
Just tell me how to use the key
I want to enter the door
I wanna know
I see the light you have inside
Give me the code to be sure

Break down the walls
You must believe in your heart
This is the secret from above

My help comes from my God
Who made heaven and earth
Time will tell when we'll see the signs
And the blind will finally see so
Open your eyes

I know it's hard
I know it's hard to hear the truth
You want the easy way out
Your sacrifice
You have to swallow your pride
To find the answer tonight
