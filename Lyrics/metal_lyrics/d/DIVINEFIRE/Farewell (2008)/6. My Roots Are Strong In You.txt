There's a battle in my flesh
My living hope is in you
You're the one and only
Who can make my life complete

I'm not afraid to live
I belong to you
Even through my failures
You're always there for me

My roots are strong in you
Your words are true
Divine promises from the living book
You live inside my house
My roots are strong in you
Your words are true
Through darkness into your holiness
My roots are strong in you

When will ever rest?
Maybe never in this life on earth
I'm waiting for his sign
For His final return
