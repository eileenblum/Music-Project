I'm standing here
In his service with no fear
My armour shines like gold
I'm prepared for the final war

The prince of peace
I proclaim your name
For all the good things you have done
I'll never be the same

Your heavenly kingdom
We're together as one
There's no separation
All praise to the son

I belong to you
You'll never walk away

God won't give up
I belong to him
I will use my time and space
To honour my mighty king

You conquered death
For everyone
To live in perfect harmony
No suffering and pain

I belong to you
You're the saviour of my life
I belong to you
You'll never walk away
