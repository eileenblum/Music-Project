The world is running faster
No time and No control
My brain is overloaded
Something is going wrong!
You were born for my master plan

Everyday is like a big adventure
Open up your eyes
You will grow and you are not alone
Hold on tight!

They say I'm going crazy
If I follow Jesus Christ
Dare I see the future?
I will believe that you are true
You were born for my master plan

No it's Never too late to live
To begin again
No it's Never too late to live
Never, never too late
He has a purpose for you
Take him in and you will grow
On God's team we all belong
Even You!!!

Everyday is like a big adventure
Open up your eyes
You will grow and you are not alone
Hold on tight!
