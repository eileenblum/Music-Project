I have decided to follow you
I have diced to go
No matter the consequences

You are the rock

That never fails
We built our lives on you

Unity as strong community
Unity in the body of Christ
Unity as strong community
Unity in the body of Christ

Unity in the body of Christ

The calling is growing strong in me
This is my choice for eternity
I'm totally dependant on you

In thee O Lord I take refuge
Let me not be put to shame forever
In Thy righteousness deliver me
Four thou art my rock and my fortress
Draw me out of the net which they have hid form
Four thou art and my stronghold
Into Thy Hand I commit my spirit
Thou hast redeemed me Lord, God or Truth
