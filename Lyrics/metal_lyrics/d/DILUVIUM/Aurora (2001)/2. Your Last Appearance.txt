Let me touch your pain once again
To touch it through your immortal joy.
Let me touch it through the beautiful
Symphony of your mind.

Just once to see it burn in your eyes
To feel it on my skin while you breathe
Next to my ear.
Never again after this will I dare to ask
For your unseen pain to show itself.

Show it to me before you touch the wings of
Angels flying above me.
I want to see it before the first rain
touches your smooth skin for the rest.

Just once to see it burn in your eyes
To feel it on my skin while you breathe
Next to my ear.
Never again after this will I dare to ask
For your unseen pain to show itself.

For your return, I will give anything
And into your hand I will commend my spirit.

Just once to see it burn in your eyes
To feel it on my skin while you breathe
Next to my ear.
Never again after this will I dare to ask
For your unseen pain to show itself.
