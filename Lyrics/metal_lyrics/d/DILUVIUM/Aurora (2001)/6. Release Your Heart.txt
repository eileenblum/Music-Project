So calm and yet so fast
You leave this world
Through my sores
I feel your painful lust
My life without my sense
I have to be born again.

In some other time
At some other place
I will see your eyes
And I'll hear your breath.

River of pain heading for me
When I'm weakest
It will be my dying angel
And my sun,and my sun.

From this truth I can not run
In this agony
Release your heart.
