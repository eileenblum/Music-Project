It's growing I hear
In the valley of tears
To send me where I belong
To see my distressful heart.

Is there any sense

There is no more reality
Just throw myself
Floating in the wind.
In this presence of night
It must be seed of new life
Am I still deep inside.

Listen to this cry
For the lost dawn
And unseen setting of sun
We will cry with it
Unaware of our sadness.

I'll never come back
To wish you the same
I took your happiness
Turned in to the sorrow.

Is there any sense
There is no more reality
Just throw myself
Floating in the wind.

Listen to this cry
For the lost dawn
And unseen setting of sun
We will cry with it
Unaware of our sadness.
