I will take you in my world
I wanna see you in my dreams
How would you feel in my mind
does your face look the same inside me.

Oh,my dear man I am calling you
All your coldness must break through
Don't ask my why you have to do
'Cause I'll give you what I have
I'll give you what I need.

And I will see sorrow in your eyes
That you will never feel in your life
And I will bleed 'cause my pain will
grow through the time.
I will seek life in your heart
For distant love in the skies
And the caress,touch to your soul
Where's nothing more than a scream
That I'm losing you in my dream.

And the sky kissed us gently
With the snow from up above
Our lives are true
Our time never ending.
In that hour we'll be released
In our hearts we'll be complete
Faraway from the world
We will drift in to our Lord.
I will seek life in your heart
For distance love in the skies
And the caress, touch to your soul
And the caress, touch to your soul

No more words, no more acts
This is how the end will come
Like a Saint in velvet rags
Distant fears must be ours.

And I will see sorrow in your eyes
That you will never feel in your life
And I will bleed 'cause my pain will
grow through the time.
I will seek life in your heart
For distant love in the skies
And the caress, touch to your soul
Where's nothing more than a scream
That I'm losing you in my dream.

No more words, no more acts
This is how the end will come
Like a Saint in velvet rags
Distant fears must be ours.
