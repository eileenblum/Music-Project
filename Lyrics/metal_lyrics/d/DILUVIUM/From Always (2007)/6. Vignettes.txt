Sweet siren voices, would you take my hands
And lead me to the depths of your tender world

In the arms of ocean, guide me through my faith
Waiting for tomorrow, while speechless thoughts break free

And every breath of guilt I breathe
I once felt in my own dreaming
Never knowing it's right meaning

Still screaming, about the past and what 's undone
Still screaming...

Salt water delivers smalls words to the ground
Step by step I'm going to my private neverland

In the arms of ocean, guide me through my faith
Waiting for tomorrow, while speechless thoughts break free

And every breath of guilt I breathe
I once felt in my own dreaming
Never knowing it's right meaning

Still screaming, about the past and what's undone
Still screaming...

In the circle of life
No safe entries
No false boundaries
Go around and start again...

And every breath of guilt I breathe
I once felt in my own dreaming
Never knowing it's right meaning

Still screaming, about the past and what's undone
Still screaming...
