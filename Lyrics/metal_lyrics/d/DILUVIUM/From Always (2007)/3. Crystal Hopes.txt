I see too many people, gathered in a trap
Standing grudged by feeding their dread
Searching for answers which nothing can seize
But blaming the other for their own defeat

I see bruises well hidden underneath their flaunt
A piece of resemblance between pride and pain
I know the feeling, been there before
Faced with the Dismal Divine overflown

In every eye
A drop of scorn
Forever and more
We're in a worldwide turmoil

As flames get higher, I rise far above
To see remaining time of us all outside of normal
Access denied, we all fall
No time to consider, no time to unwind

In every eye
A drop of scorn
Forever and more
We're in a worldwide turmoil
