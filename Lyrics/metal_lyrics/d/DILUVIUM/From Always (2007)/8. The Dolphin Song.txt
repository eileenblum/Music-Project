I can be one of your deepest thoughts
I can be with your tremulous nights
If you have dreams about love
Never try to open all my parts

Cause we, we don't have to much to offer
And we, we are choosing our orbits,
I'm a free like a dolphin in the sea
You can be it if you want the same.

I saw too many people in the greed
Never satisfied and never fed
I don't wanna be on their side
I need you to be my dolphin guide

Cause we, we don't have to much to offer
And we, we are choosing our orbits,
I'm a free like a dolphin in the sea
You can be it if you want the same.
