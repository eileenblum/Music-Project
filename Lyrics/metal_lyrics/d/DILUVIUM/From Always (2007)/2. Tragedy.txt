Tragedy, till you can't see
Tragedy, till there's no symphony.

I'm standing on the shore
These waves are simple words.
I cannot pretend
I've never lied
I've never been hurt.
Give me back my words
I want to call you back
While in time my dreams will become one big rising tragedy.

Tragedy, till you can't see
Tragedy, till there's no symphony.

I'm standing on the shore
These waves are simple words.
I cannot pretend
I've never lied
I've never been hurt.
I need an empty crown
To make my soul so free
I need cries and smiles
And no more space for tragedy.

In that ruptured solemnity
I lost the voice that came to me,
I was down and nothing more.
But hold these words on the shore
So that I can hear it once again.
Sleepy sounds of waves and sand
Which carry me to the bay of fears
To ask me for no more tears.
