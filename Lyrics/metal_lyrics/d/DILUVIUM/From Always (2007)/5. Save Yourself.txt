You always wanted to try to find
Perfect life or endless love
Watch the steps you walk on
In this dangerous way,
Feel the risk upon you
The body is trembling
Open your eyes to see me
And hear what I'm going to say

Save yourself, save those words that you have
Whispering tears, always try to find you.
Take it slowly and go to find the truth
For yourself as you wish to do so.

Wasted run for morning star
It's such a delight for your life
Watch the steps you walk on
In this dangerous way,
Feel the risk upon you
The body is trembling,
Open your eyes to see me
And hear what I'm going to say...

Save yourself, save those words that you have
Whispering tears, always try to find you.
Take it slowly and go to find the truth
For yourself as you wish to do so.
