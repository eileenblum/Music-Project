Night falls over me, I just want to lie
My skin is getting cold
My eyes are open wide.
Are you afraid of me, of my grief
And still can you believe in me like you used to do
Are your senses so numb, whatever you say
I have no more tears to give
The emptiness in my eyes.
Are you afraid of me, of my grief
And still can you believe in me like you used to do
Like an ember fire the heart beats slowly
The struggle is very hard
Cause of you my hope is keeping me all alive.

In this time without my self-confidence
I don't know if I'll do wrong
Every waking morning
I see my different life
Is it the discovering of the other side?

Are you afraid of me, of my grief
And still can you believe in me like you used to do
Are your senses so numb, whatever you say
I have no more tears to give
The emptiness in my eyes.

In this time without my self-confidence
I don't know if I'll do wrong
Every waking morning
I see my different life
Is it the discovering of the other side?

Night falls over me, I just want to lie
My skin is getting cold
My eyes are open wide.

Follow me to the place of my dreams
Where theres no end and time doesn't exist
Where we can go with that serenity in our hearts,
Where there's no rust and stains
Beyond our paths.
You will see over the cliffs
You will watch the stars fall down
How they pierce through all around.

Surrounded by the moons
Preaching of the life
On the pages of memories.
Pictures running overhead, the skies
All blue and white, it fills my sight.
