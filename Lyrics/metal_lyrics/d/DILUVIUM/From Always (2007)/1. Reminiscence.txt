In my time of need I wish for
This world to change its course
And I search and search for moments
That nothing will erase

I'm drowning but I'm patient
Like hope that never dies
I don't want to feel the breath of your anger
So close to my paradise

One step forward, nothing's in
Embrace the emptiness around me
Day by day I fall again
Into infinity of reasons,
But I remember...

And memories are whispering
Sad tunes from past decades
In my dreams I find my answers
But I forget them while I'm awake

Still drowning, not less patient
Looking for a way out
Withheld words and no explanation
All my failures are turning back

Embrace the emptiness around me
Day by day I fall again
Into infinity of reasons,
But I remember...

I remember

One step forward, nothing's in
Embrace the emptiness around me
Day by day I fall again
Into infinity of reasons,
But I remember...
