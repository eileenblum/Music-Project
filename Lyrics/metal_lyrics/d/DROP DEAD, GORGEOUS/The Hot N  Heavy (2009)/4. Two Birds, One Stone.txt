Love is what we got
A terrible mistake
This bedroom is caught on fire
And killed
Two birds with one stone
A terrible love song
You sang it so sweet
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in it
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in hell
Love is what we lost
We had a connection
This feeling has gone too far
And killed
Two birds with one stone
A terrible love song
You sang it so sweet
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in it
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in hell
You told me you'd keep this between us
But, if you're so sorry
I hope you're happy
You slung
Your tongue
At me
You're wrong
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in it
If I ever see you again
And this gun is loaded
You'll sleep in hell
You'll sleep in hell
