Straight shots!
Poppinâ bottles!
Sex sells more than drugs
Itâs like an out-of-body experience
Itâs something thatâs painfully real
Itâs enough to make you take your own life
Instead of trying to heal
From the sleepless nights,
The paranoia, the stress,
And the writerâs block
A girl in the picture is not a good mixture
Iâm trying but I canât ever stop
Lead me on
Why wonât you lead me on?
Go on and lead me on
I got a plan (watch me fail)
You just walked away
I always admired your selfish ways
Addicts, alcoholics;
Weâre all liars, desperate liars
When you offer it you canât refuse it
Itâs too fucking easy
Our knees are too weak
Make up your mind
How many cigarettes can we burn through?
How many lines of this can we blow through?
The light always finds a way to shine through
You canât ever stop
You have to
Shut the door
Shut your mouth
Keep it quiet
Break it out
Crack a smile, now youâre wired
Just one more line
The night is gone
Snow White, Cinderella, poison apple, red all over
Straight shots!
Poppinâ bottles!
Sex sells more than drugs
