A few more shots is all that it took
I took you for granted. You read me like a book.
Spun into the bedroom,
The lights turned low
Her clothes came off.
We took it slow.
Her body went straight to my head,
Everywhere you go I'll be right behind.
Now I'm back in style.
Don't look so surprised.
I'm not asking for much
Sill I am good for it
Try to let your heart go
I think I could love you
When did making love with you
Become part of the plan?
Don't think I'm sorry like you think I am
You can't stop, no
You can't keep your head clean
You're a mess
You can't stop, no
You can't keep your head clean
Drugs and Sex
You can't stop, no
You can't keep your head clean
Check your nose
Clear your throat
I'm not asking for much
Sill I am good for it
Try to let your heart go
I think I could love you
You told me this wasn't a one night stand
Well lets be honest
Both of use got what we wanted
Now its time to show your way out
(Come back)
Don't think I'm sorry like you think I am
