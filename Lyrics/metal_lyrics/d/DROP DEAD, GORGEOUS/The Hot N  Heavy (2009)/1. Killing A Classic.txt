Same old show, different town.
Heaven knows what you've been doing all night long.
Are you having trouble sleeping?
Are you having trouble sleeping on the run?
There's no doubt in my mind.
I'll take my time
Playing with the hearts of everyone I touch.
Of everyone I touch.
I'll take your heart, string it with the rest and hang it from my neck.
Over and over again
How can I forget?
Forget you're timeless.
Are you having trouble sleeping?
Are you having trouble sleeping on the run. on the run?
Now it's a show, so lose those clothes.
Fake a smile, take your time baby.
Take your time baby.
Take your time.
You've got nothing to lose so set the mood.
Break a leg, take your time, baby.
Take your time baby.
Take your time.
You got me right where you want me.
Now take your time
Take your time
Set the mood (baby)
Set the mood (baby)
Set the mood (baby)
Now take a bow.
Are you having trouble sleeping?
Are you having trouble sleeping on the run, on the run?
Are you having trouble sleeping?
Are you having trouble sleeping on the run, on the run?
I'll take my time
Playing with the hearts of everyone I touch.
Of everyone I touch.
I'll take your heart, string it with the rest and hang it from my neck
Hang it from my neck.
I'll take my time
Playing with the hearts of everyone I touch.
Of everyone I touch.
I'll take your heart, string it with the rest and hang it from my neck
Hang it from my neck
