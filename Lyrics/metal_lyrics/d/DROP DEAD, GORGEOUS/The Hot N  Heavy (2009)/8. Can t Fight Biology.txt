Iâve had you so many times that Iâm getting addicted
This is slaughter
I canât touch her
You wear me out
You wear me out
And I know that itâs a mistake
My bodyâs lonely
I know that itâs a mistake
Gripping the blade âtil it cuts through
I tried to hide you
And thatâs not fair gripping my heart
Youâre a lush and your tongueâs always tainted
Youâre an artist
Youâre so overrated
Running and running away
It served its purpose
Itâs not your perspective
Itâs mine
Itâs only getting worse by the hour
Itâs only substance to pass the time
A meaning that lacks no meaning at all
Still revolving around its center
Without ever caring or wondering why
I know itâs just me and my wandering mind
A terrible thing to waste
And a terrible thing to hide
Still Iâm afraid to be someone Iâm not
I canât change the presence itâs all that I got
Down on your knees you look so good
With a face like that itâs hard to go wrong
If you love me to pieces, the pieces fit
And this all was about you
