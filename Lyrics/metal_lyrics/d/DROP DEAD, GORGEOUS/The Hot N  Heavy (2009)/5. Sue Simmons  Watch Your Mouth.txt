We all have out secrets some don't site well
Some will turn to white lies just as well
Why can't you come clean and tell the truth?
Come clean
Always watching you watch
You're always right on time
I'm on fire
Will someone put me out?
Reaching for the stars above the clouds
I'm burning
Come clean
Tell the truth
Torched by an angel, the Devils breath
Stop being anxious
This villain is faceless
She follows, she traces
This liquors now tasteless
I can't change this
This lack of breathing will make you sick
Under the knifes where I'll make you slip.
I can't change this I can't change
A selfish hear appears kind
O love. It comes in shades of grey
It's so easy to be used by you.
Stop being anxious
This villain is faceless
She follows, she traces
This liquors now tasteless
I can't change this
This lack of breathing will make you sick
Under the knifes where I'll make you slip.
I can't change this
I can't change
Torched by an angel, the Devils breath
