I was broken in
Iâm not leaving instead
I broke promises kept
Youâre absent heart on a string
I thought I told you once
I thought I told you twice
I came here to get what I want
Fired two shots in the sky
Youâre always scared of the shadows
And still you look like youâve seen a ghost
Come back, this heart attack wonât spare my lungs
Take it all
To lure the kill;
Soften the blow
Take what you want
Leave nothing more
Escape from your pride
Beg for attention
Lay them aside with good intentions
I was broken in
Iâm not leaving instead
I broke promises kept
Youâre absent heart on a string
I thought I told you once
I thought I told you twice
I came here to get what I want
Fired two shots in the sky
Youâre always scared of the shadows
And still you look like youâve seen a ghost
Come back, this heart attack wonât spare my lungs
Take it all
Show me that you mean it
The damn kids wonât believe it
