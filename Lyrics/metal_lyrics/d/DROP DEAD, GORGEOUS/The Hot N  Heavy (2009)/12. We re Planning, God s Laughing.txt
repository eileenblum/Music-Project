It's only sometimes I feel this alone.
It's not the worst times that scare me the most.
Living a dream is running away from conscience
Just seconds away.
It's a long fall from the top.
You just come home inside your soul.
I hope you never learn, you probably never will.
Send me away, I'm sending you away.
I shot him, he's not coming back.
When a memory touches down,
It can and will be the end of all your troubles.
I drink until I can't get drunk
I've done drugs so I can love.
I want to fall asleep next to you.
You said this wasn't permanent, well it is.
Death is the only thing in your way.
No one's gonna tell you how to live your life.
So live for yourself!
Hell is a cold dark place.
This will end in tears I know it.
The snow on the leaves and the ice on the pavement.
Break
Break.
Break.
Hell is a cold dark place.
This was not in the script:
Not all the flashing lights and the sirens.
Break.
Break.
Break.
I was still, not aware of the coma.
In the hospital grave, don't stop waiting.
I'm still breathing.
I was still, not awake from the coma
