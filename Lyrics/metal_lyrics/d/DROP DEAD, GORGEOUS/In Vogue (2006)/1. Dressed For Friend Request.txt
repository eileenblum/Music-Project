See through the wreckage
Into the fire
Inside my heart
Bullet to the head
Soon you'll be sleeping
Pull this trigger to your antidote
She's dressed to kill
I don't know what to wear
She's dressed to kill
She's dressed to kill
She had the eyes of a angel
With the heart of a traitor
And a gun with a trigger
In her hand pointed at her
We always knew you'd go up in flames
We always knew you'd go out with a bang
We're going nowhere fast.
Yeah, you're just jealous
