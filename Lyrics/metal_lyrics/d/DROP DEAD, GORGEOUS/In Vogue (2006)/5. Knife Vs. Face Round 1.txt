I can't sleep tonight
Stab me direct in my heart
Watch me bleed; I'm lying at your feet
Dying, living for for just one last breath with you
I live, for you and only you
Stop lying; you know I'd lie with you
We're dying on the inside
You're smiling on the outside
Settle the score. Knife Vs. face round 1
Stab me direct in my heart
Watch me bleed; I'm lying at your feet
Dying, living for for just one last breath with you
Forget the taste of me and follow your instinct
Stab me directly in my heart
Watch me bleed; lying at your feet
Dying, living for for just one last breath with you
