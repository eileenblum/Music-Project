Curtains
Steady, this won't hurt a bit.
I promise this won't hurt a bit
Close your eyes for the first time
Pray to your God and forgive me
Forgive me Father for I have sinned
The streets will run red
No one knows what goes on behind closed eyes
No one knows what goes on behind closed eyes
Highlight this valley
The fire will burn us both
