Letting go is the hardest thing I know
Like this bullet pierces through my skull
The end
I love the feel of steel in my heart
Like I love the bitter taste of your kiss
Natural bliss
I'm a sucker for a happy ending
Interrupted by a nightmare
Here comes love
Chivalry
Take a knife to your wrists make a bloodbath
Cut it deep, It's the new thing
Baby please make this last forever
You're the latest fashion theme.
