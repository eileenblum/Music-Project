You won't have to wait in line
Watch them wheel her in
All she can see is white
Face down on a mattress
Hurry Doctor young, won't want to miss the party
Ankle films are back on cupid
A singing telegram slipped on some ice
We need a doc in radiology
Inject a IV contrast
A patient named Jones
BP's 50 over 70, BP's 90 over 50, pulse is 120
Pupils fixed and dilated she's beginning to flatline
She's not going to make it
I can feel your heart stop
Charge the paddles to 15: CLEAR
We need a bandage to stop the bleeding
