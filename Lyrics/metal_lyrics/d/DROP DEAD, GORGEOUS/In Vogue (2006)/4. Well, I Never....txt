I'm in line for the murder. First come first served
You aim from across the hall, your vision blurred
Is this what you want from me, to hear me scream?
I'll die suddenly my blood on your hands
I'll die in tragedy, you'll live in fame
Here comes the last masquerade
We need a doctor baby
Don't you just love a good time?
I do.
