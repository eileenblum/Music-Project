Nothing to see here outlined in white
Just the red on the carpet
The scene of the crime
The devil made you do it
Why do it just for the fashion?
Where, oh where, has my baby been?
I would die to hear your voice
You've been gone so long, I can't feel you
And your hand on my heart beating true
Did you think I'd live without you?
You belonged to me
I miss your face
I lost my place
I lost my faith
