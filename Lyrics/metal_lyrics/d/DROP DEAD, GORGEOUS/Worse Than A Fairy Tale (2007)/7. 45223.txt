Such a lovely girl
And a lovely house.
Something went terribly wrong...

Come closer
Girl,
I'll light you on fire.
You deserve that much.

It's all your fault.
You did this to yourself.
It's easier to take a hatchet to somebody you love.
And now the lust has lost its pleasure.
You take to heart
The cruelty of the game that you created.

Come closer
Girl,
I'll light you on fire.
You deserve that much.

Draped in red,
Guess this is closure.
It's easier to take a hatchet to somebody you love.
"Oh well, this dress was red anyway"
You take to heart
The cruelty of the game that you created.

Such a lovely girl
And a lovely house.
Something went terribly wrong...

"It's all your fault!
You did this to yourself!"

Come closer
Girl,
I'll light you on fire.
You deserve that much.

Where'd you get that body?

Come closer
Girl,
I'll light you on fire.
You deserve that much.

"Now the lust has lost its pleasure.
Spilling guts,
Guess this is closure"

(watch you burn slowly, yeah, you've earned it)
