Not again.
Not again.
Not again.
Not again.

Why did God make glass to be shattered?
To hold and to cut?
Your crooked cross covers your eyes.

Forgot my name.
Forgot where I came from.
I died getting here,
Make me gold,
I'm waiting.

Call me the Dark Angel.
(don't touch me, don't trust me)
Please don't scare.
(please keep your hands away from me)

I'd like to have a word with you. [x8]

(Just keep your hands off me)
(Please keep your hands off me)

Call me the Dark Angel.
(don't touch me, don't trust me)
Please don't scare.
(please keep your hands away from me)
Please don't scare.

I'd like to have a word with you. [x9]
I'd like to have my way with you.
I'd like to take my time with you,
I'd like to abuse my mind with you.
I'd like to share my knife with you.

Don't scare,
Don't scare,
Don't scare,
Don't scare,
Don't scare,
Don't scare,
Don't.
