I would do for you what you did to me,
Even kill.
But to you I'm just a mirror.
Well sometimes mirrors shatter.
The shrapnel becomes deadly.
It surrounds you with no escape and you can't save her.
You can't save her.

Like a ghost, you slept in my bed.
And I fell while you tore through my neck.
When I awoke you were already dead.
Those eyes, I'll never forget.

Make your move,
Take your time.
Every pawn threatens your life.
Go raise hell,
Come up short.
No mercy is granted here.
Best come clean,
Kill you stride.
Keep your head,
Cleanse your life.
'cause you can't save her.

Like a ghost,
You slept in my bed.
And I fell while you tore through my neck.
When I awoke, you were already dead.
Those eyes, I'll never forget.

"I don't care what you do to her,
You won't find her body.
I swear.
I swear.
You won't find her body.
In time the rain with every season,
Will wash the bones down the river."

I would do for you what you did to me,
Even kill.
But to you I am just a mirror.
Well sometimes mirrors shatter.
The shrapnel becomes deadly.

"I swear,
I swear,
You won't find her body."

Death is upon all of us.
It comes in the shape of an angel.
