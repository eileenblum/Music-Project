Your nails,
Fashion red,
Paint a story your eyes never kept.
Don't worry, sweetie, I'm just killing lately.

You think I'm a killer.
You think these eyes belong to a murderer.
Pass judgment fast,
'cause that's the last look you'll get.
Please take me with you [2x]

In autumn I won't be here
So help me, god
So help me, god
Come autumn, I won't be here
So help me, god
So help me, god
In autumn I won't be here
So help me, god
So help me, god
Come autumn, I won't be here
So help me, god
So help me, god

"I've been evil making a mess out of this town; I woke the devil."

Your nails,
Fashion red,
Paint a story your eyes never kept.
Don't worry, sweetie, I'm just killing lately.

Help. [x8]
