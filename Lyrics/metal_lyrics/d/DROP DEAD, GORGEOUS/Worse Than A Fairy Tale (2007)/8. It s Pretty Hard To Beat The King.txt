Go tell this town I've built them all their coffins.
As for this face,
Best to be forgotten.

"Baby baby, I've got a reason to leave but I'm not going far.
Baby baby, come on I'm begging you, please, I'm not the one in chains."

"They call me Jesse James and I own the night life.
I drift from town to town across the nation.
Praise the lord,
Lock and load boys.
We go down,
We go down,
We go down together."

"Baby baby, I've got a reason to leave but I'm not going far.
Baby baby, come on I'm begging you, please, I'm not the one in chains."

Your gun's firing blanks.
No way out. [x4]
Gun's firing blanks.

Go thell this town I've built them all their coffins.
As for this face,
Best to be forgotten.
Hell's on its way,
No one's gonna stop it.
I wear the suit,
No one's gonna top me.
