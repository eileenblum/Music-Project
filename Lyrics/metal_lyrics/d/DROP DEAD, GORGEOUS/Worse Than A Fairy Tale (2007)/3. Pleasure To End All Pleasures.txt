You love her,
You love her,
You love her.
No, you don't.
You're better,
You're bitter,
You're better off without.
You love her,
You love her,
You'll never leave her.
For every boy who told you that he'd never ever feel
The way he felt when you touched him and never did again.
Did you get my call?
So I know you're home.
Locked up in your room,
I still have your key.
Die, bitch, die.
There'll be no escaping.
"maybe this time I've gone a little too far, but you had it coming."
Tearing out your organs.
You liar,
You liar,
You liar,
Who'd of thought?
You couldn't,
You couldn't
Control your mouth.
You liar,
You liar,
You liar,
Who'd of thought?
You couldn't,
You couldn't,
You couldn't
Shut your mouth.
Did you get my call?
So I know you're home.
Locked up in your room,
I still have your key.
Die, bitch, die.
Tearing out your organs.
"Maybe this time I've gone a little too far but you had it coming."
There'll be no escaping.
