Soaked in blood,
Only to be sterilized.
Served alive,
I want to be traumatized.
Don't tell,
Don't tell.
Keep this in your locket.
Wade in the water,
Careful for sharks.
Wade in the water,
But not for too long.
The pain is deep and wide.

Cannot escape from the lives we have made.
Where are we now?
I'm starting to forget just what it was you said exactly,
The love is gone only to spawn disastrous memory.

I'm starting to forget.
Soaked in blood,
Only to be sterilized.
Served alive,
I want to be traumatized.
