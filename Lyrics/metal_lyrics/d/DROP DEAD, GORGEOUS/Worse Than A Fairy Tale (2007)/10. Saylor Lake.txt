You're all the fucking same.
Worthless and waiting for a saviour,
That was there all along.
You're all the same poison,
With perfect lives and cruel intentions.
A trail of blood...

You've fucking built the skin.

Give the paper something to talk about.
Give the readers something to talk about.
Saylor lake's got a mean howl.
Careful at night, better watch out!

Decorate her funeral with open wounds,
When the sorrow pours like water
Down a cold and restless body.
Slowly flows a fiver,
In the river we will gaze.

You're all the fucking same.
Worthless and waiting for a saviour,
That was there all along.
You're all the same poison,
With perfect lives and cruel intentions.
A trail of blood...

Up the stairs, down the hall,
Into the bedroom she crawled,
To place a panicked phone call,
But she was struck in the head with a blunt object.

Decorate her funeral with open wounds,
When the sorrow pours like water
Down a cold and restless body.
Slowly flows a fiver,
In the river we will gaze.

I never thought that I would grow tired.
Well I did.
There once was a time where I lost my mind and I thought that I wanted this,
But now I'm terribly mistaken for a fake.
One day these cameras will steal my entire soul.
When everything is gone,
It's quiet and we want nothing more.
