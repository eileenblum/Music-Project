The ocean pours from her eyes,
While the statues crumble aside,
And this city overrun with traffic,
Is so over concentrated with this static.
And I scream,
And nobody listens.
And I scream,
Yet everyone's louder.
Drink until everything seems to make sense,
In this desperate night we were all wearing costume.

Lay awake until the stomach settles.
Just one taste will make it all feel better.

I don't fear.
I don't care.
You never had the guts to face me.

Kill!

I need you
Bye bye blues

Kill!

Lay awake until the stomach settles.
Just one taste will make it all feel better.

"I don't believe we've met...
Allow me to introduce myself."
I don't believe we've met...
When I look at you I can see myself.
