Hey bud how the hell you been?
Found you just can't win without me?
Hey bud I can see it in your eyes
Your hungry for the lies
So come down with me
Come down
Hey bud don't you hate to feel?
It all seems all too real and not too bright
Hey bud I can set you free
For just a tiny fee
I'll show you the light

Dead inside
Trapped in a void a million years wide
Dead inside
Inside your shell it's easy to hide

Hey bud are you feeling like a star?
Forgetting who you are have I done you good?
Hey bud when you need to fill your shell
Just give a little yell are we understood?

Dead inside
Trapped in a void a million years wide
Dead inside
Inside your hell it's easy to hide
