Time why so cruel is the
Have you sympathy upon these broken souls
So lost
Wait for time can't heal these wounds
The forgotten nameless strewn across
This ever solemn place

Buried in Pottersfield now and forever
Buried in Pottersfield nameless forever
And ever to be
Buried in Pottersfield

Cry for those of wasted years
Who lived our darkest fears and died
Nameless and so alone
