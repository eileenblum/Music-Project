Say hello to your father
Say hello to your mother too
Say hello to your neighbors and everyone who abandoned you
When they search for an answer
When they ask for a reason why
Tell them to look in the mirror, see the truth they cannot deny
Did you think it was a film straight out of Hollywood
Didn't recognize the cast but the effects looked mighty good

Set them off like gasoline that misfit kid that angry teen
A slab of meat for the media
Because what you see is what you get and what you get you might regret
Deny
When you live a life of lies the punch lines no surprise

Did they know of your anger
Did they care that you hate inside
Will they wait for the stranger
When he comes will they run and hide
