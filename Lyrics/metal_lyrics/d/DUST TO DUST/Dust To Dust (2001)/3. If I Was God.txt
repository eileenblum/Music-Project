If I was God
I'd leave the race of man in the trees
Just think of how much happier he'd be
With no pressures no vanity
Free from tomorrows insanity
If I was God
If I was God
Would I spare this world of its pain
Watch the children dying in vane
And do nothing for life's but a game
Smile upon those who died in my name
If I was God

If I was God
All would behold my glory
If I was God
All would believe in me
If I was God

If I was God
Would I think the way that I do
And would I share my reasons with you
Touch your soul and know what you feel
If I was God would you think I was real?
If I was God
