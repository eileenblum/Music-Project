You swear you've fallen down
But you haven't quite reached the ground yet
You feel it closing in
Feel the emptiness that swells within
Do you really like what you've become
Seems like your efforts never equal the sum
Ain't life a bitch

Do you really care for what you see
Dreaming of the you that you long to be
Ain't life a bitch

Then you die, yeah you die

You sit and watch in vein
As another sad failure leaves a nasty stain
Each day we pay the toll
On the road of broken dreams and broken souls
