I am the spawn of a new world order
I am the place that the burnouts go
I feed the minds of your sons and daughters
And I'll take you to a new low
I'm the stranger walking through your pretty neighborhood
I'd like to make my dark intentions clearly understood
So hide your children in that sheltered world that you create
I'll light their fuses and I'll help them all to detonate

Just like a little boy on daddy's shoulders
You thought you'd touch the sky until you got much older
Now everything turns black and so much colder
The weight of this cruel world will crush you like a boulder

I'm just a product of your gluttony and growing greed
So join the masses and I'll take care of your every need
I know your hunger and the meaning to your foolish rhymes
You're going hungry and with me it's always dinner time

Take a deep breath and close your eyes
Open your mind and you'll realize
You're just a pawn of tiny size
And nobody cares
