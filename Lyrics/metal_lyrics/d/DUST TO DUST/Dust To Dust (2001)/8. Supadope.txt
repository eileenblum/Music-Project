You couldn't care for the cost
Your one of the newly lost
You've got the man in your head
When you've got nothing to lose
The path is easy to choose
So why not dance with the dead

You are a monster fiend machine
On a b line till you make that cop
You're like a roller coaster racin'
Towards a brick wall and you just can't stop

Can you tell me what is wrong with you
And what your high on
I can see you're wacked by the things you do
What are you high on?

Become a marionette
You do not seem to regret
The mess that you've turned into

So why not cash your chips in
Why even try now to win
There's nothing left inside of you
