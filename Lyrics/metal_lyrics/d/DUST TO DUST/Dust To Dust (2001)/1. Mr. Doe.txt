Was I the poison in your injection
Was I the one to escape detection
Was I the sin in the dark, the flame from the spark that burns you
Am I the guilt behind your cold eyes
Am I the truth behind all your lies
Its sadder but still despite all my will it's true
I'm like you

Mr. Doe I want to know
I need the truth to set me free
I want to learn from your misery

Misery loves company

If the truth should ever find you
May it enlighten and remind you
Of the monster you are
And the unhealing scars left by you
