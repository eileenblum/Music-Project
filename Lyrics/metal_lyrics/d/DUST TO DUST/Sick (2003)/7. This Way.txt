In a world where not much means a thing
You made an offering of love and no one seems to care
It's sad as time goes marching by we need to justify
The lies we're selling to ourselves

Don't it leave you incomplete
All alone with your defeated pride
Lost innocence
You're searching for a reason
But you've lost it deep inside

[Chorus]
Things don't have to be this way
Why must there always be a price to pay?
No things don't have to be this way

If I could I'd fix those things done wrong
I'd build my world big and strong
And I would keep it to myself

Don't leave you incomplete
All alone with your defeated pride
Lost innocence
You're searching for a reason
But you've lost it deep inside
And a voice inside your head
Assuring of coming dread
Lets blame the world instead
It's so easy

[Chorus]
