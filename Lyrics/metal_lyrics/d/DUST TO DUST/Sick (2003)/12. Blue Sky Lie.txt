Felt the fool for far too long
Took some time but now I'm strong
Don't really matter who's right or wrong
When you feel like I do
Had your way with time to kill
Crush ones dreams and break ones will
Thought you'd won but I'm standing still
Despite what you do

[Pre-chorus]
So I guess I'll hold on tight to what I have
Though it's little
And I guess I'll fight the fight although my will
Has grown so brittle
Well the strories the same and it does me no good
Because you'd sell me your soul
If you only could

[Chorus]
Take your blue skies, deceit and your lies
And your cold eyes don't fool me no more
Take your blue skies cause I don't want to be blue anymore

Wounds will heal and lessons learn
Ashes left where hopes all burned
Stories change and pages turn
Despite what you do

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Time may grant a brand new start
But the answers in your heart
Only I can find a way to make a new
And tomorrow may bring fear
At times too much to bear
And that's where I rise again

[Chorus]
