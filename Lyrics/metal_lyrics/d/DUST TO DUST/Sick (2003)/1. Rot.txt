You don't want to live or die
You don't want to even try
Only problem is you can't deny the very thing that's killing you
And when you think you've had enough
I'll be there to call your bluff
And your be begging for the very stuff
That feeds the pain inside of you

Like a moth to a burning flame
In the end it's all the same
Another loser in a losing game
Still searching for some chance to win
And you don't like the things I say
And you may wish I'd go away
But I make you a king for a day and fool forever

[Chorus]
I'm the one your running to
Cause you like the way I'm killing you
And that pain inside you hide from view
Self made misery

Rot (save me)

I'm the thoughts inside your brain
I'm the blood inside your veins
I'm your loss and your greatest gains
I'm everything you see and do
And what you don't seem to see
Despite your growing hate of me is my true identity
I am you

[Chorus]

Rot (save me)
