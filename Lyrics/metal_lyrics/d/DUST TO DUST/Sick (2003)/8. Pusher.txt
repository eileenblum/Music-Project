The fairy tale is growing stale
And I don't want what you've got for sale
I guess I've strayed from the beaten trail
Of souls that lead to your door

[Pre-chorus]
Well I don't feel what you feel
And I don't care what it is that you think you deal
All I know is that I know what's for real
Cause I live it

[Chorus]
I'm not going out that way
No I'm not down with it

Dealers of hope and dealers of dope
Sell you false promises to help you cope
Well guess who's tugging at the end of the rope
That you'll be hanging from

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus 2x]
