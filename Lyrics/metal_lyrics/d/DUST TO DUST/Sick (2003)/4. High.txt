When the rain beats my window
And the clouds won't let the sun shine on me
I get lost to a place somewhere in outer space
Where I am free

[Pre-chorus]
Bathe me in your bright tomorrow
Sheltered by your leaves
Wash away the hurt and sorrow
All I want is to get myself

[Chorus]
High
High
Higher than the clouds in my sky
And I'm never gonna come down, no
I'm never coming back down
High
High
Higher than the clouds in my sky
I'm going home

As the night draws upon me
Weight of the world coming down on me
I can catch the flight tonight and everything will be alright
And everything is cool with me

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
