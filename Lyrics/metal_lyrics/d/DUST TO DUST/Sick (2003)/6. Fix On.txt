I left myself wide open and let your lies inside
I should have seen this coming but I was hit broadside
Because the crap you sell me with your words and tricks
You just keep on pushing till you get your fix

[Pre-chorus]
Now you suck on the stones that you've bled
And your voice rings with lies in my head
And I choke on a rock in my throat
While you gloat and you bloat full of shit

[Chorus]
I think it turns you on
I think it gets you off
No matter what the cause
You'll get your fix on
I'm seeing right through you
I know the things you do
No matter what the cost
You'll get your fix on

I think you'd sell your own mother to have the things you crave
You'd rob a babies cradle, you'd rob a deadman's grave
Back stabbing junkie like a cheap crack whore
You forget your friends till you need some more

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Get your fix

[Chorus]
