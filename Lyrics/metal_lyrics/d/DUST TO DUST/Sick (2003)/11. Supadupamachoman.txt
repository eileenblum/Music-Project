He's driving in his fancy car
You find him at your local bar
Knock you out bathe in cologne
Never leaves the girls alone
He's loud and makes his presence known
He's a star

Clown
Why do you always have to be around
In my way
A major ass on grand display

[Chorus]
He's a supadupamachoman
If he can't fuck her no one can
He's a supadupamachoman
Designer clothes and a cheap suntan

Steroids pumping through his veins
He has three beers and goes insane
If he can't get laid he's gonna fight
So someone better show him love tonight
The home team lost and that ain't right
Your to blame

Clown
Why do you always got to bring us down
And I say
I wish that you would go away
You fucking clown
Why do you always got to be around
In my way
A major ass on grand display

[Chorus]

Disco dancing loudmouth fool
Really thinks he's ultra cool
He's the owner of that there bar stool
With his giant arms and two inch tool

[Chorus]
