Run away turn away from the damage we have done
You can hide safe inisde till the debt collector comes
Comes little minds are giant binds that slowly bring us down
And our eyes from the lies till the cold truth could be found

[Pre-chorus]
And as we're sleeping
All those things come creeping
That we have chosen to ignore
There right outside your front door

[Chorus]
Better wake up quick
Cause the clocks still tick
Like a burning wick
I suggest you think about it
Be it come what may
You will dread that day
Heed these words I say
I suggest you think about it

The greed we serve helps preserve a place on the fast decline
Towards darkest days where evil ways have us pay the greatest fine

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
