I tried to find the light in me
The one that claims to "sets you free"
But all I found was anger, bitterness and pain
And everytime I turn around
Somethings there to knock me down
Seems that everything is simply done in vain

[Chorus]
Well I'm sick of being last in line
Sick of feeling left behind
Sick of everything this worlds become
I'm sick of all the things I see
I'm sick of watching helplessly
I'm sick of you
I'm sick of me and I'm
Sick of what I feel in me

So what's a broken man to do
Wait till this world is through with you?
Gather what's been left and face another day
And through it all I live and learn
To feed this hate and watch it burn
Sickened by a world I wish would go away

[Chorus]
