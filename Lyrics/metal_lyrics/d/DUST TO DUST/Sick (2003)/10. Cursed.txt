Every time I shoot for something
It amounts to less than nothing
I guess I've got to accept the way things are for me
Bottom man on the totem poll
Crying out from the deepest hole
Black sheep with a blacker soul
That's what has become of me

[Pre-chorus]
I need a good defense
I'm losing confidence
Happiness is now past tense
I'm running for cover
My bubbles often burst
Can things get any worse
Feel like I've got this curse
Hanging all over

[Chorus]
Every time I get my feet back on the ground
Something comes along and knocks me right back down
Hopes are crushed and hands are bound

That ancient evil eye seems stuck in my grey sky
Black clouds always seem to pry into my forecast
Can't take this rotten luck
Can't rise above the muck
Everything is bound to suck
How long wil this curse last

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

What have I done to deserve
The sentence that I serve
Find a way to preserve
My fading sanity
What have I done to deserve
The sentence that I serve
Forever to observe
My lifes calamity

[Chorus]
