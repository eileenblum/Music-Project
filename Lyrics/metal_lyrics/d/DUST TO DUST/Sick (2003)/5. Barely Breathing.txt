You're all the same it's a crying shame
Another link in a growing chain of fools
Do as your told till you grow weak and old
Never dare to step outside the rules

[Pre-chorus]
Well I'm here on the outside and I've been looking in
And it's easy to recognize 'cause your soul has grown real thin
From lack of expression or individuality
Can't you see you're not free

[Chorus]
Don't you want to live
Don't you want to give
I believe there's something to live for
Or are we barely breathing
Don't you realize
Open up your eyes
When you gonna stand up and rise
Or are we barely breathing

Another clone from the plastic zone
Another monkey suit to add into the zoo
Where admissions cheap and rewards you reap
Leave an empty space inside of you

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Wake up

[Chorus]
