Which way do we turn
Cause the darks coming down to be
The end all completely
Well you think we would learn
But I've found that stupidity
Governs the species

[Pre-chorus]
All all we have are broken dreams
Sleep filled nights are not quite
What they seem

[Chorus]
How the hell we gonna face tomorrow
When we're living in a world of sorrow
We waste away with the time we borrow
Lost to yesterday
Another reason found to hate your brother
Another way for us to kill each other
Ignore the tears of our dying mother
We all turn away
This is our shame

So slowly we fall into the void of some memories
Remembered by no one
And now after all maybe it was meant to be
And maybe it just had to be done

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
This is our pain

[Chorus]
This is our pain
