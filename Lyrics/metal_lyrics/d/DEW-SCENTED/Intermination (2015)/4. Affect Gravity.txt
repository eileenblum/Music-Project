Isolated bleak machinery
For mankind often chose to believe
In a message of betrayal
Instead of one it could entrust and accept implicitly

The world collapsed
Broken apart, fallen in between
The cracks shown on the surface
Lost space, continue the fever

Amalgamation in captivity
Twist the meaning of reality right around
Time has come to rationally face
That the end won't live up to expectations

It's out of place, effects casually
Disoriented moves, to affect gravity

Another era elapsed
Casualties affect gravity

The world collapsed
Casualties affect gravity

Isolated bleak machinery
For mankind often chose to believe
In a message of betrayal
Instead of one it could entrust and accept implicitly

Casualties affect gravity
Casualties affect gravity
