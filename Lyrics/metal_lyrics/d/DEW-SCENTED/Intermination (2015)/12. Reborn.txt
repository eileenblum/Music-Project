Deep in the subconscious, suspended in a dream as ignorance is bliss
An existential strife, no mind autonomy
Living for the drill, a warmachine programmed to be torn
Resurrecting from defeat, retaliation unbound

A struggle against this misery
Confronting with destiny
Now watch me be reborn
Reborn chasing shadows eternally

Reason self-destructs breeding constant fear, will we see the day?!
Alive in tragedy, only void remains
Rigid hollowness, transmigration, disgrace upon my soul
Flicker before my eyes, finality

Lie - A eulogy composed of lie
It's not really over yet
Come see me be reborn
Reborn among the mortal shades forevermore

A struggle against this misery
Confronting with destiny
Now watch me be reborn
Reborn chasing shadows eternally

Now...
Watch me be reborn
Resurrecting from defeat

Reason self-destructs breeding constant fear,
Will we see the day?!
Alive in tragedy, only void remains
Rigid hollowness, transmigration
Disgrace upon my soul
Flicker before my eyes, finality

Lie - A eulogy composed of lie
It's not really over yet
Come see me be reborn
Reborn among the mortal shades forevermore
