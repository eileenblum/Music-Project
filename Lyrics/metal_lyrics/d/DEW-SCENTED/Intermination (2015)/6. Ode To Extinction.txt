This valediction will be all that you get
A journey into the afterworld ceasing to be
This ode to extinction
Over and out

Receive my words
Mark them cautiously
Blinded by shame
Sustain and abstain

Extermination of prospective life
The ultimate price that you will pay for becoming like us

One more time...
Cleansed by burning
Once and for all
You're the ones to suffer at the end of the day

Annihilation
Divine the future
Close your eyes while all is taken away from us
Taken away from us

This ode to extinction
Becoming like us
Extinction

This valediction will be all that you get
A journey into the afterworld ceasing to be
This ode to extinction
Over and out

Receive my words
Mark them cautiously
Blinded by shame
You sustain and abstain

Extermination of prospective life
The ultimate price that you will pay for becoming like us
