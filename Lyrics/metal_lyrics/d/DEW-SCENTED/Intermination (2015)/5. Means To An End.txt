Never ever close your burning eyes
The pain won't ever cease, shattered dreams resound the screams
As the rest no longer brings relief
Stricken and strained, dejected and drenched to the skin

Rising up and breaking down compound...
Coming clear for all to see: means to an end

Watching over thoughts undead
Endless cycles of dismay
State and dwell upon the pieces
Of broken promise

And no longer wishing to end well
The fear won't mend, pay the price, wages of sin
Can't resist the ever feverish thoughts
Nightmares won't stop on the verge to lunacy

Waking up and bursting out, compound
Coming clear for all to see: means to an end

Caught in a web, encircled by unrest
Disordered mission, a mind never at ease

This is a means to an end
A mind never at ease
This is a means to an end

[Lead: Marvin Vriesde]

Rising up and breaking down compound...
Coming clear for all to see: means to an end

It won't help to escape
Into the nether
When deep down all is lost
To fail no ascertain
How to find peace of mind
To find peace of mind
