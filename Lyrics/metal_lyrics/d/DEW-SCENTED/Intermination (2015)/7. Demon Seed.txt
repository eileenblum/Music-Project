How much longer to endure
A life imprisoned in a deathless cell

Escaping sickness, avoiding shame
Behold thy servant, bringing forth the pain
Unending torture, terminal plague
No going back, hollowness will reign

Nowhere to hide
No way to avoid due punishment
Kneel down and pray
Darkness commands the day

Demon seed
Demon seed

Breeding cycles of endless fear
Screaming voices nobody will hear
Feeding instinct, funeral feast
A vicious circle, demon seed

[Lead: Rory Hansen]

How much can you endure

Escaping sickness, avoiding shame
Behold thy servant, bringing forth the pain
Unending torture, terminal plague
No going back, hollowness will reign

Nowhere to hide
No way to avoid due punishment
Kneel down and pray
Darkness commands the day

Commands the day

Demon Seed - Pure reflection of our greed
Dying creed - Cycle of violence to heed
Demon seed - From opposition we recede
Dying creed - At long last we're fully freed

Demon seed

[Lead: Marvin Vriesde]

Demon seed - Pure reflection of our greed
Dying creed - Cycle of violence to heed
Demon seed - To the gallows it will lead
Dying creed - For our lives we have to plead

How much can you endure

Demon seed - From opposition we recede
Dying creed - At long last we're fully freed
Demon seed - At long last we're fully freed!
