Wounds that won't heal
Consecrated by time
Perennial guilt marked in the flesh
Witness of cruelties, attesting on oath
In a beginning insolence

When darkness turns to light
One thousand barriers breaking down
Dead certainty weighs upon us
A thousand more will follow

Curse of laws, premonition of death
This call to arms, a final breath
Behold affliction as perdition takes charge
Upon completion pain will end

Scars of creation
Scars of creation

Wounds that won't heal
Consecrated by time
Perennial guilt marked in the flesh
Witness of cruelties, attesting on oath
In a beginning insolence

Scars of creation
Scars of creation

The time is come
Fear overcome
Scars of creation

The time is come
