Man, perish the thought
Evolution steps aback
Patience alteration
Like a moth to a flame
Lead into temptation
Imperfection ultimate
Clan identity
This vanity will drive life to be...

Rewound and obsolete
Reduced to beggary
Adverse to destiny
Reversed

Atavistic - Atavistic Age
Atavistic - Atavistic Rite
Reversed

Traits have disappeared, infirmity
Done waiting for social progression

[Lead: Rory Hansen]

The architects of ruin
Divide, conquer, retrograde
The architects of ruin
Throwback, resurgent, stagnation

Man, perish the thought
Evolution steps aback
Patience alteration
Like a moth to a flame
Lead into temptation
Imperfection ultimate
Clan identity
This vanity...

Atavistic - Atavistic Age
Atavistic - Atavistic Rite
Reversed

The architects of ruin
Divide, conquer, retrograde
The architects of ruin
Throwback, stagnation again
The architects of ruin
