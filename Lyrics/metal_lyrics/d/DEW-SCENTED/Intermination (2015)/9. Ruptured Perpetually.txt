Resound in the emptiness
Tension relieves in disarray
Out of the dark skies
A new mended form of life is born

Timeless ancient predictions
Forewarn a silence to preserve
Turning away in deviation
Ruptured perpetually

Ruptured perpetually
Come live through me

Rapid nearing completion
Astral will won't adapt to norms
Caught up between the worlds
Cross fading lights, obscurity

Ruptured perpetually
Come live through me

Always apparitional
The screams of the soul will spawn
Immediation
Ruptured perpetually

Ruptured perpetually
Come live through me

[Lead: Marvin Vriesde]

Resound in the emptiness
Tension relieves in disarray
Out of the dark skies
A new mended form of life is born

Timeless ancient predictions
Forewarn a silence to preserve
Turning away in deviation
Ruptured perpetually

Ruptured perpetually
Ruptured perpetually
