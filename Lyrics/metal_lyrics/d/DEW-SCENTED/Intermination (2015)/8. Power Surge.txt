Power surge
Restraint gone out of control
Driven mad and to erupt
Rebel against the order
Death to the oppressor!

Reserve the right to revoke
This sentence of the will
We are not guilty as charged
Injustice comes to an end

We will no longer subside
And we refuse obedience
Taking command forcedly
And through their fall we come alive

All hell will be let loose
As anger surged within us
We can no longer contain
The fury grown from the inside

Resume, increase the power
Watch us rise and undertake
From ruination comes renewed
As claim for restitution

Power surge
Courage born of despair
Power surge
A deadly chain reaction

Reserve the right to revoke
This sentence of the will
We are not guilty as charged
Injustice comes to an end

Power surge
Courage born of despair
Power surge
A deadly chain reaction

Restraint gone out of control
Driven mad and to erupt
Rebel against the order
Death to the oppressor!

All hell will be let loose
As anger surged within us
We can no longer contain
The fury grown from the inside

Power surge
