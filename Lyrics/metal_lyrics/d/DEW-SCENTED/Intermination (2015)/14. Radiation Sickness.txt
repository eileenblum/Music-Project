[originally by Repulsion]Radiation overdose - Melting flesh
Life is draining from you - Toxic death

Rotting from the inside out - Flesh turns grey
Inhaling radiation fumes - Lungs decay

Sickness from the radiation makes you lose your mind
Hair falls out, internal bleeding
Virus makes you blind

Radiation burns your flesh - Soon you'll die
Poisoned clouds of toxic rain in the sky

Start to fucking decompose, still alive
Rigor Mortis freezes you, now you die

Sickness from the radiation makes you lose your mind
Hair falls out, internal bleeding
Virus makes you blind
