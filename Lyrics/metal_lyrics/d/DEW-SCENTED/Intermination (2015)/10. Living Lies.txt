Growing accustomed to dishonesty
Seeking response to doubt what is found
Venture despaired to disagree
Bury the truth deep down in the ground

Cry of delight, displacing the grief
It's such a human emotion to deceive
Credence unreal, eager to know
Answers on edge for a question of time

Captured by disdain
Trapped inside living lies
Hollow promise divine
Caving in living lies
Lead astray living lies

In the proximity of judgement
Getting a good grip on reality
Facing mortality
No man can avoid futurity

Captured by disdain
Trapped inside living lies
Hollow promise divine
Caving in living lies

[Lead: Rory Hansen]

Lead astray living lies
Lead astray living lies
Constrained by belief

[Lead: Marvin Vriesde]

Growing accustomed to dishonesty
Seeking response to doubt what is found
Venture despaired to disagree
Bury the truth deep down in the ground

Cry of delight, displacing the grief
It's such a human emotion to deceive
Credence unreal, eager to know
Answers on edge for a question of time

Trapped inside living lies
Take away what blindfolds my eyes
Caving in the living lies
Lead astray living lies
