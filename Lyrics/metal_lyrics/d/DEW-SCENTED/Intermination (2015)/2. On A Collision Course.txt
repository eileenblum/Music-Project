A moral dissection non aligned
Pre mortem purpose in ruthless approach
Decadent society of vermin
Just another crime in cold blood

Kamikaze mission
Constantly dismissed
Operation apocalypse
Rotten at their core

Collision course
On a collision course

Obliteration
In liberation
On a collision course

No opposition to speak of
Nightmares continue to unfold
For vanity and with voracity
Victimizing those with no say

Eased regulations for deceit
Forget the light forging decay
Whatever the consequences
In times of crisis all is undone

Collision course

It's millions of people
Living on the edge
Tragedy upon tragedy
On a collision course

[Lead: Rory Hansen]

Collision course
Collision course

No opposition to speak of
Nightmares continue to unfold

A moral dissection non aligned
Pre mortem purpose in ruthless approach
Decadent society of vermin
Just another crime in cold blood

Collision course
On a collision course

Obliteration
In liberation
On a collision course
