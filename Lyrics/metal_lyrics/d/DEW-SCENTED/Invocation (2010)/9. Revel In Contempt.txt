[Music: Walczak, Borchers, Dieken &amp; Pahl, Lyrics: Jensen]

Alive but barely breathing
Suffocating in empty hope for survival
Donât close your eyes just yet
This might be the very last time
For you to see the lifeless lust of horror
In the godforsaken faces

Weâre all participating
Orgy of brutality
History of hysteria
Determinationâs end
Anti-design of salvation
Buries all remorse
World of no redemption
Blind victims of war

We all surrendered to this program
Knowingly we carry blood on our hands

Pain allied, facing death, revel in contempt
We did all agree to this parade of shame
A fuckinâ movement of disgrace
Humanity, tragedy, revel in contempt

On the verge of perpetual misery
Upcoming doomsday, yet we donât be deceived
Falling from grace as our destination
And nobody will be able to escape the judgement

Oh how foolish of them to be
Hoping for glory and eternity
Soulless creatures, bringer of plagues
Embrace the fall, relentless, unto damnation

Go, revel in contempt
We did all agree to this parade of shame
A fuckinâ movement of disgrace
Humanity, tragedy, revel in contempt

On the verge of perpetual misery
Upcoming doomsday, yet we donât be deceived
Falling from grace as our destination
And nobody will be able to escape the judgement

Revel in contempt
Revel in contempt
Revel...
