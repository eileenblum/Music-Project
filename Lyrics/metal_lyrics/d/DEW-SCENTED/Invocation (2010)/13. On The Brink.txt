[Bonus Track][Music: Walczak, Lyrics: Jensen]

Under the spell of cherished hopes
Aspirations completely destroyed
In the light of the conflict
Frustration's much too vast to hide

Sense the tention rising, shortly out of hand
Take a step into the danger zone

Watch the pressure growing, soon to detonate
The upcoming confrontation's impact

And in the thick of the fight we let the world pass by

We're going through fire and water for this
Standing victorious on the brink of the abyss

By no means we'll surrender
We have gone much to far to turn back
In the midst of devastation we don't have the vaguest notion of fear

Caught between two fires, in the face of death
No return from this trial of strength
Teach a rightful lesson, take it all away
Time is come to now do as we say

And in the thick of the fight we let the world pass by

Claim an eye for an eye, to the very last breath
Defiant, relentlessly, on the brink of death

Bring out the worst in us
A strife for life, on the brink

We're going through fire and water for this
Standing victorious on the brink of the abyss

Claim an eye for an eye, to the very last breath
Defiant, relentlessly, on the brink of death

Bring out the worst in us
We are on the brink
On the brink
