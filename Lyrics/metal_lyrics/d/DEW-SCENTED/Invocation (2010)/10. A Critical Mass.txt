[Music: Walczak, Borchers, Dieken &amp; Pahl, Lyrics: Jensen]

Intercede, interfere!
Final attempt to re-conciliate but all to no avail
Profane last rites
Human sacrifices to cover lies and to propagate insanity

Defenselessly, helpless, acting powerless
The conflictâs ending and defeat is staring them in the face
Critical mass, detonate!

Infiltrate, instigate!
Upon completion of the fall
Theyâll rise above the ashes of destruction
They shine like stars
A gleam of silver
Overcast the impending apocalypse

The crack of doom wonât heal these chronic wounds
The day of judgement has arrived in the end

Acid rain utopia
Come enhance mortality
Radioactivity, praising the fire
Balance reaction
A critical mass
Eradication of all life
Set death free
Critical mass
End of days
Critical...

Intercede, interfere!
Final attempt to re-conciliate but all to no avail
Profane last rites
Human sacrifices to cover lies and to propagate...

Infiltrate, instigate!
Upon completion of the fall
Theyâll rise above the ashes of destruction
They shine like stars
A gleam of silver
Overcast the impending apocalypse

Retaliate!
Critical mass detonate!
Set death free
Critical mass
End of days
Critical...
Critical mass!
