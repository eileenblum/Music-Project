[Music: Walczak, Borchers, Dieken &amp; Pahl, Lyrics: Jensen]

Bring on a deadly panic
Wreck the here and now
Elimination of security
Vile acts of sabotage
Accelerate the decline
Open hostility
Weave a web of lies

Collapsing to the ground
Onset catastrophe

Exploited through and through for one last fucking time
Dead end, betray your ignorance
System of true delusion bound to self-destruct
What face do you put with your enemy?

Rise
New world disorder!
Rise
Global hysteria!

Bless the mayhem
Global hysteria!

Perpetual maze down the hell
Knowing your enemy much too well!

Failing endeavor, resistance is futile
Like leading the rats to dig their own graves

Free will deceived
Your world is gone to pieces
Material overload
Enslavement to indulge in global hysteria

Led astray to believe that the truth would show
A theory of decline has turned into the decline of theory

Fall...
Bless the mayhem
Global hysteria!

Rise
New world disorder!
Rise
Global hysteria!
