[Music: Walczak, Borchers, Dieken &amp; Pahl, Lyrics: Jensen]

Come unchain the demons hidden behind my eyes
Look out, step aside, a fury uncontainable
Uncovered masquerade put into perspective
Into the fire I fully conscious march, Iâm out to burn

Feeding frenzy
A closing with style

Prepare for damnation!

The time is come, release the anger
A life, torn to shreds
No repentance, no forgiveness
A life, torn to fucking shreds

Awake with bleeding hands, ordeal of the will
Regaining memory but truth remains a mystery
Another casualty, history repeats
Abysmal morals, torn to shreds

Judgement Day is near
Wash away all sin
Once carved in my skin
Now torn to shreds

Come unchain the demons hidden behind my eyes
Look out, step aside, a fury uncontainable
Uncovered masquerade put into perspective
Into the fire, Iâm out to burn

Awake with bleeding hands, ordeal of the will
Regaining memory but truth remains a mystery
Another casualty, history repeats
Abysmal morals, torn to shreds

Feeding frenzy
A closing with style

Judgement Day is near
Wash away all sin
Once carved in my skin
Now torn to shreds

The time is come, release the anger
A life, torn to shreds
No repentance, no forgiveness
A life, torn to fucking shreds

Torn to shreds!
