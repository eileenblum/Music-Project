[Music: Walczak, Borchers, Dieken &amp; Pahl, Lyrics: Jensen]

Prepare the faithful for the final coming of doom
The sea will part again conjuring deadly plagues
Prayers of dead light, vicious words unspoken
Nowhere to run, no hiding from perpetual wrath

Release damnation
Have no mercy on us

Upon completion the world will be deserted
All that was before has faded into nothingness
Eyes of fire unfold the nightmares of creation
Arising from their failing spiritual demise
Weâll go astray

Armies of Nemesis
Have no mercy on us

Cursed for eternities
Saluting the end
We will never be at peace again

Prepare the faithful for the final coming of doom
The sea will part again conjuring deadly plagues
Prayers of dead light, vicious words unspoken
Nowhere to run, no hiding from perpetual wrath

Armies of Nemesis
Have no mercy on us

A declaration of insidious blasphemy
Blessed by emptiness
Baptized by fire, reduced to ashes
Our souls will never come to rest

Release damnation
Have no mercy on us
Release damnation
Have no mercy on us

Upon completion the world will be deserted
All that was before has faded into nothingness
Eyes of fire unfold the nightmares of creation
Arising from their failing spiritual demise
Weâll go astray

A declaration of insidious blasphemy
Blessed by emptiness
Baptized by fire, reduced to ashes
Our souls will never come to rest

Armies of Nemesis
Have no mercy on us
