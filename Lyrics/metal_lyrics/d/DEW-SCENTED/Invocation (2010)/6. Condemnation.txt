[Music: Walczak, Borchers, Dieken &amp; Pahl, Lyrics: Jensen]

Amidst the dangers, so lifeless in pretense
All I see of you are shades in decadence
I have returned to behold the day
As you accept this castigation divine

Never-ending torment
Exclaim in delight
Condemnation

Look through these hollow eyes to understand
That there is blankness no disbelief
Stand up before my face to surrender
Unfold a plead, mercy forevermore

Relive excruciation
Time to rejoice
Condemnation
The dream is dead

You shatter in the cold light of day
Bound to exit in eternal disarray
Broken into fragments of illusions profane
Carry the weight of a dead world on your back

The dream is dead

Amidst the dangers, so lifeless in pretense
All I see of you are shades in decadence
I have returned to behold the day
As you accept this castigation divine

Never-ending torment
Exclaim in delight
Relive excruciation
Time to rejoice
Condemnation
Condemnation
