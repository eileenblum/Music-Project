[Music: Walczak, Borchers, Dieken &amp; Pahl, Lyrics: Jensen]

Unceremonial descent
After all these years of blood, sweat and tears
In a permanent dispute
Just to settle and keep the flame alight

Never to regret one second

A blinding of senses
Comfort compelled as punishment
Itâs a moment of bliss
As we cease to be

Inner peace with termination
The skin has shed
Leave the rotten core inside
Arise from decay

Unceremonial descent
After all these years of blood, sweat and tears
In a permanent dispute
Just to settle and keep the flame alight

Never to regret one second
Still alive and gaining on strength

Inner peace with termination
The skin has shed
Leave the rotten core inside
Arise from decay
Forwards into destiny
Arise from decay

Sworn to stay and set to craft in continuation
As the battle carries on, the anger grows

Set to arise from decay
Set to arise from decay
Set to arise from decay
Set to arise from decay

A blinding of senses
Comfort compelled as punishment
Itâs a moment of bliss
As we cease to be

Inner peace with termination
The skin has shed
Leave the rotten core inside
Arise from decay
Leave the rotten core inside
Arise from decay
