[Music: Walczak, Borchers, Dieken &amp; Pahl, Lyrics: Jensen]

Out of the body experience emerge as empty shell
Purity of no soul pre-set not to research the will to be
Apparatus unperfected, design unready to resist forevermore
Ban the existential fear, future aflame breaking down

Burning down to the ground
Artificial life
Dead, a fabrication
From the cradle to the grave

Unethical dilemma, horrors of guilt lie down a wide awake
So alive and dead alike in a state of comatose immobility
An abhorrent apparition, inner inertia turning into recompense
A breed created to retaliate and now about to strike back

At the back of beyond
Artificial life
Controlled
A breaking chain of command

Downfall
Artificial life
Breaking out of this confining
Artificial life

Down, burning down
Artificial life
Dead, living dead
Artificial life
Back, striking back

Out of the body experience emerge as empty shell
Purity of no soul pre-set not to research the will to be
Apparatus unperfected, design unready to resist forevermore
Ban the existential fear, future aflame breaking down

Modern reign of slavery, robotic imperium of decadence
Rejecting all remorse in the name of material prosperity
Both a blessing and a curse but who decides the outcome in the end?
Mankind is to pay the high price of living with the funds of self-destruction

Down, burning down to the ground
Artificial life
Dead, a fabrication
From the cradle to the grave
Back, striking back
Artificial life
Dead, living an artificial life
