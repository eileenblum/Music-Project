[Music: Walczak, Borchers, Dieken &amp; Pahl, Lyrics: Jensen]

A cry of liberation
Soul on fire breaking free
With a heart encaged
You feed on pain and misery
A rapture of impressions
Haunts you down again and again
In absence of remission
Summoning spirits below
Darkness as companion
Bleak your isolation
Fear will reign above it all
The invocation begins

Screaming in silence
The invocation begins

Abolishment born of your will
Indulging in a lifetime of sin

Pray for consolation
A plead for mercy gone unheard
Inner maze of distrust
What remains is dismay
Evoking reprisal
Void of purity
Averse revelation o black
Unholy hostility
Diabolical possession
Sell your soul in the name of revenge
As the invocation completes
Perdition unfolds

Screaming in silence
The invocation begins
Screaming in silence
The invocation

All blood is bound to boil at last
Ripped to shreds, the die is cast

Awaken through the abomination
Upheaval through the invocation
Awaken through the abomination
Upheaval through the invocation

A cry of liberation
Soul on fire breaking free
With a heart encaged
You feed on pain and misery
A rapture of impressions
Haunts you down again and again
In absence of remission
Perdition unfolds

Upheaval through the invocation
Upheaval through the invocation
