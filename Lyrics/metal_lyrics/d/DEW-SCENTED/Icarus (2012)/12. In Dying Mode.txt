[Bonus Track]Bid the great disorder farewell
With no hope for better days
Leave behind the custody
Break free from the shackles of life
Regain mental autonomy
Liberated and so relieved
Alter the future
Man forges his own destiny

In dying mode

Comprehension pulled to pieces
Confidence ripped to shreds
Glimmer of survival
Once alight, now rather bleak
Longing for solitude
Crystallize in the mindâs eye
Unchained at last
Self-fulfilling prophecy

Calamity â Everyone will see
Debauchery â In dying mode...
Surrender unconditionally
Getting ready to be in dying mode...

In dying mode
Salvation of the soul

Bid the great disorder farewell
With no hope for better days
Leave behind the custody
Break free from the shackles of life
Regain mental autonomy
Liberated and so relieved
Alter the future
Man forges his own destiny

In death prepared to conceive
Forever struggling to be free

Endure a painful exile
Endless dead certainty

In dying mode
In dying mode
Salvation of the soul

Comprehension pulled to pieces
Confidence ripped to shreds
Glimmer of survival
Once alight, now rather bleak
Longing for solitude
Crystallize in the mindâs eye
Unchained at last
Self-fulfilling prophecy

In death prepared to conceive
Forever struggling to be free
Endure a painful exile
Endless dead certainty

In dying mode
