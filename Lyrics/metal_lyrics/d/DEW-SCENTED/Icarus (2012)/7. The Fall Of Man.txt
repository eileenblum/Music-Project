We cannot see through, senses have failed
Between brief moments of light, we are fully lost
Forsaken quest, no destination
Shadows consume our sight, how shall we persevere?

A lure that mirrors our mortal dismay
Promised atonement, an ending in ashes?
Left empty-handed, malicious deceit
One final stare into the face of adversity

The fall of man
Compelled
Forsaken profession of faith

Dividing light away from the darkness
Sanctimonious, venture of decay
Unforgiven in sickening open
Into the end, forwards maze of misery

Inhuman burden, endure everlasting pain
Procrastinating, journey into wastelands
Disincarnated, void of all feeling
Rapid decline, downwards maelstrom of despair

How inspiring is self-righteousness?
When we donât even live under the same sun
Cursing prayers, renouncing belief
We wonât die in the name of the same truth

Behold the eternal descent
The fall of man

We cannot see through, senses have failed
Between brief moments of light, we are fully lost
Forsaken quest, no destination
Shadows consume our sight, how shall we persevere?

The fall of man
Compelled
Forsaken profession
Forsaken profession of faith
