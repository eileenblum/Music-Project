Iâve got to pick up the pieces by myself to reconcile
Inner peace to seek, in my final hours
In declination Iâve built these towering walls around me
Itâs too late now, no turning back from the course thatâs been set

My life is falling apart
And I tried, I fought with fortitude
The time has come to break free
All by my own hand

I canât decide, whatâs really right and what is wrong
Canât see clearly, distracted by affliction
Seeking shelter behind a shield of eternal rest
Never again, no rules to follow, this is about free will

My life is falling apart
And I tried, I fought with fortitude
The time has come to break free
All by my own hand

Nothing in my way
Reaching for higher ground
Oblivion of being
Thereâs a time for everyone

Iâm gone too far, beyond redemption
And all is well that ends well

Iâve got to pick up the pieces by myself to reconcile
Inner peace to seek, in my final hours
In declination Iâve built these towering walls around me
Itâs too late now, no turning back from the course thatâs been set

Nothing in my way
Reaching for higher ground
Oblivion of being
Thereâs a time for everyone
All by my own hand
