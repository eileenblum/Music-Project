Hallow blindness to see
In this waning hour
The sun sets down upon us
Reviving the pain

Causing madness, rays of light
Glitter brightly in the eyes of deception
Onset vertigo, taking over
A tight feeling of oppression and fear in our chests

Oh what a welcome relief!
Staring blank, scenery of the end
Overreactionâs distress
Gives way to amusement as we deeply kneel

Survival of the fittest, gleaming like silver
Re-entering the black, concealed in the dead night
Will we outlive this relentless destruction?

Oh what a sight to behold!
Brilliant reflections, spectacle of doom
Deceived time after time
Yet never prepared to strike camp

The end of all days, gleaming like silver
Bleed from within, burn up inside
How will we breathe in this vacuum of existence?

Hallow blindness to see
In this waning hour
The sun sets down upon us
Reviving the pain

Causing madness, rays of light
Glitter brightly in the eyes of deception
Onset vertigo, taking over
A tight feeling of oppression and fear in our chests

Survival of the fittest, gleaming like silver
Re-entering the black, concealed in the dead night
Will we outlive this relentless destruction?
Will we outlive this relentless destruction?
