Oblivious sheep filing to the slaughterhouse
Aimless souls forever waiting to be saved
On bended knees, crawl into the warmth of light
Beneath all dignity by choice, deprived of liberty

Dying embers, fire ceasing to burn
Will sows discord, itâs feast or famine for all time

Survival sickness, secret lore
We have sworn to obey

Behold the full scope of mystification
We canât be rescued, succumb to temptation
Repent from sin, cleansed from the guilt
The time is come now to lift the veil of secrecy

Dying embers, fire ceasing to burn
Will sows discord, itâs feast or famine for all time

Memento mori, misdirected
We have sworn to obey

Pull us out, unbind us from fear
Tear us up, we can no longer live up to this
In the wake of damnation, weâll bury the fate
Be deceived once again, for as long as we pray we shall perish

Oblivious sheep filing to the slaughterhouse
Aimless souls forever waiting to be saved
On bended knees, crawl into the warmth of light
Beneath all dignity by choice, deprived of liberty

Survival sickness, secret lore
We have sworn to obey
Obey
