Amazing force majeure
This inner mass absorption
Unable to escape
From the cycle of bereavement
We fail to see
It's fantasy
Moral fraud for eternity

Static electricity
What once was dying
Now recharges in me

And it feels like acid rain
Breaking out
Storm within

Fully covered in black
Respecting the unreal
Approaching thunder in our hearts
Showing no fear

Completely overcast
Suddenly the sky seems near
Catastrophic premonitions
Now the tide is drawing in

We tried to be
To remedy
Internal vow of humility
Emotive authenticity
Once concealed
Now running free

The time has come for me
Saved from drowning
Storm within

Perfect storm within

Perfect storm within

And it feels like acid rain
Breaking out
Storm within

The time has come for me
Saved from drowning
Storm within

Fully covered in black
Respecting the unreal
Approaching thunder in our hearts
Showing no fear

Raging elements, sight to behold
Perfect storm within
Raging elements, sight to behold
Perfect storm within
Raging elements, sight to behold
Perfect storm within
Raging elements, sight to behold
Perfect storm within
