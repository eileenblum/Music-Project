Come back to strength, return to full energy
Remorselessly making up for lost time
Prepare to strike back relentlessly
Go it alone, thirst for revenge
Reawakening

Against all odds, soul gone cold
On a dead run, breaking the mould

Devoid of ceremony, a public resurrection
Regeneration, wicked works never cease
Secured in decision, staying the course
Always ready to pass once more
Only to become anew

Buried alive, crow much too soon
Most triumphant in the ends
Perpetual lifeform
Not afraid to die

Come back to strength, return to full energy
Remorselessly making up for lost time
Prepare to strike back relentlessly
Go it alone, thirst for revenge
Reawakening

Stand firm, no fear
Never to let go

Devoid of ceremony, a public resurrection
Regeneration, wicked works never cease
Secured in decision, staying the course
Always ready to pass once more
Only to become anew

Against all odds, soul gone cold
On a dead run, breaking the mould
There will be no place to hide
In vain to seek refuge in flight
