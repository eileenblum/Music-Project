Invoking rites, quest for endlessness
Salvationâs promise, the absence of certainty
Hollow ceremony, unsacred life estate
Reflect dead splendor, shine a light on mortality

Adopted creed on fire
Fatality in worldly innocence
Protected sanctityâs remuneration
Clandestine, come to senses, avert calamity

Destined to collapse
Existential fears
All things must pass
Departing soul

False perceptions changing
In defiance of confidence
The attitude to life gone astray
Common sense will guide to spiritual liberty

Destined to collapse
Feeble-minded
All things must pass
Into non-existence
Accepting fate with modesty
Global sentence to death in absentia

Living lie, foolish paradise
The word made flesh
Destined to collapse
Not to prevail
