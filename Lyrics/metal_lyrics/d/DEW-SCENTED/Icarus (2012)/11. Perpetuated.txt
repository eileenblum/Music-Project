Mass-produced anguish, collective guilt
Closely watched within four walls, youâre trapped in a web
Affected ignorance, you wonât capture the essence
Of whatâs to come, proven elusive, no evidence
The herd will follow
While you carry the torch

Wrongful accusation, named and shamed, absurd
Born of fraud, deceptive creation, foul trickery
Speechless with grief, most insignificant
All at once forsaken with a cry of dismay

The tensionâs rising
Blessing or curse
Perpetuated
The herd will follow
While you carry the fucking torch

Mass-produced, social demolition
Ignorance, not bliss in a world of lies
Mass-produced, public execution
Ignorance is all perpetuated by belief

All you want is to feel
In full possession of the real

Perpetuated, world of lies
Perpetuated, world of lies
You just keep moving on
You just keep living on
Preparing for extinction
Rejoicing over extinction

Mass-produced anguish, collective guilt
Closely watched within four walls, youâre trapped in a web

Perpetuated
The herd will follow
Perpetuated
While you carry the fucking torch
