Sighting in red, blood will flow incessantly
Mass entertainment, spectacle of suffering
Hail to cruelty, forever burdened with the guilt
In their dying hour, hear their splitting screams

Feeding frenzy, time wonât fill the emptiness
Left behind by all the souls departed
By the numbers, breaking under torture
Agony of mind, horror will reign through the centuries

Acts of the unnamable
Cutting off their tongues
Every nightmare brought to life
Hanging on the cross

Sighting in red, blood will flow incessantly
Mass entertainment, spectacle of suffering
Hail to cruelty, forever burdened with the guilt
In their dying hour, hear their splitting screams

Those in hope of salvation
Will be throwing the first stone

Cleanse the soul, be free from sin
Seeking comfort in anotherâs misery

Thrown to the lions
Carrion-feeding rush, in delirium
Thrown to the lions
Slaughter with no end, in delirium

As delusion is brief
Their barbaric remorse canât remain
Falling prey to temptations
In a time when sadists lead the meek to the graves

Thrown to the lions
Thrown to the lions, but why?

Feeding frenzy, time wonât fill the emptiness
Left behind by all the souls departed
By the numbers, breaking under torture
Agony of mind, horror will reign through the centuries

Acts of the unnamable, cutting off their tongues
Every nightmare brought to life, hanging on the cross

Thrown to the lions
Thrown to the lions to die!
