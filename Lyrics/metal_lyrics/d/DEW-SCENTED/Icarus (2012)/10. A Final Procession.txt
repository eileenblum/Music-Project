Crying out, time has come for ritual celebration
Lost cause for rejoicing in life
Chants and prayers for the damned
You have lied, you have sinned
Never stood by your convictions
Lost your way, no orientation
Pay for your malicious mistakes

Over and over, well-trodden path
On the brink of ruin for all to see
Time after time, journey into the light
You refuse to come clear

This is a final procession
Flocked together like a horde of sheep
Identity in corporate belief

Vanity, paleness of retributionâs delight
Compelled to follow, play along, forced to obey
You cannot judge, you cannot reason
You have never learnt to disagree
Forever renouncing rationality
Bring forth the burden of sin

Sign of these times, ambivalence
Delusion is short, remorse is long
You renounce responsibility
You arouse indignation
And this is a final procession
On tragedy they all shall feed

This is a final procession
On tragedy they all shall feed
This is a final procession
On tragedy they all shall feed

Over and over, well-trodden path
On the brink of ruin for all to see
Time after time, journey into the light
You refuse to come clear

This is a final procession
On tragedy they all shall feed
And this is a final procession
Tragedy to feed
