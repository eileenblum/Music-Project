[Music by Mueller, Bache, Werning â Lyrics by Jensen]

This sickly feeling... the revelation is in due course.
Iâm free and ready to abhor you, dead thoughts unwinding.
Incarcerationâs overcome, but liberation takes itâs toll.
One last moment of dispute; Confront me â release me from the agony.
Retribution: Familiarity bred contempt, errors and omissions raised the price youâll pay.
Thinking twice, nothing can change my mind. Youâll stand no chance in the end.
To my relief, all dependence soon becomes eternal guilt set to deny you.
All-out derogation in substantial final shape, independence for the mind.
I wash my hands of you at last, without a single fragment of remorse...
Vanish away, slip through my fingers like sand!
Vanish away! Like dust in the wind, disappear!

[Lead: Bache]

Vanish away, slip through my fingers like sand!
Vanish away! Like dust in the wind, disappear!
Retribution: Familiarity bred contempt, errors and omissions raised the price youâll pay.
Thinking twice, nothing can change my mind: stand no chance in the end.

[Lead: Mueller]

This sickly feeling... the revelation is in due course.
Iâm free and ready to abhor you, dead thoughts unwinding.
Incarcerationâs overcome, but liberation took itâs toll.
One last moment of dispute: Confront me, release me from the agony.
I wash my hands of you at last, without a single fragment of remorse...
