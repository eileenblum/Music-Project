[Music by Mueller, Werning â Lyrics by Jensen]

Amoral gift of no eternity, in the midst of life we are all in death,
We await the end impatiently, but the spirit wonât encounter rest,
Iâll rise above, I will show no fear, say your payers to feed my revenge,
As you suffer, Iâll attain my vengeance, your remorse only fuels the fury aflame,
Mark my all-unblessed words, you will retain the scars,
For all times youâre meant to retain the scars.
Iâll strike back, I will teach you pain. Prepare to experience the ultimate rage.
As you face the punishment, I am complete. Iâll return to be anew.
Share the ever-lasting horrors, as you retain the scars,
Wounded for lifetimes, you shall retain the scarsâ¦ the scars!
The guilt you carry deep in your skin was always yours, and forever it shall be.
In my eyes youâll see no sympathy, youâll retain the scars,
In my hands youâll find no rescue, youâll retain the scars.

[ Lead : Mueller / Lead : Bache ]

Mark my all-unblessed words, you will retain the scars,
For all times youâre meant to retain the scars,
Iâll rise above, I will show no fear. Say your prayers to feed my revenge.
As you suffer Iâll attain my vengeance, your remorse only fuels the fury aflameâ¦
Aflame! The guilt you carry deep in your skin was always yours and forever it shall be.
Share the everlasting horrors, as you retain the scars.
Wounded for lifetimes you shall retain the scars,
Amoral gift of no eternity, in the midst of life we are all in death,
We await the end impatiently, but the spirit wonât encounter rest.
