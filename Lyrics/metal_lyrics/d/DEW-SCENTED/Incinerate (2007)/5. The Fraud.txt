[Music by Bache, Werning â Lyrics by Jensen]

Outright negation, you make me feel so right to be wrong.
With empty phrases, you know itâs better not to speak.
Itâs false interaction, feeding lies as rhetorical wit.
Common sense as travesty, words wonât disguise the fraud.
Letâs face the facts, stand upright, this sickness will consume us.
Letâs get this right, out of the way at last, once and for all,
Without intermission, you bring alive all the darkness in me,
Pretentious form, guessing is wrong, it hasnât begun.
Itâs vain dedication, wishing well when itâs already gone.
Your moves are pointless, blindfolding truth, the fraud
Incinerate memories we cherished, immortalize the damage done.

[ Lead: Bache / Lead: Mueller]

The Fraudâ¦
Incinerate memories we cherished,
Immortalise the damage done.
Letâs face the facts, stand upright, this sickness will consume us.
Letâs get this right, out of the way at last, once and for all,
Outright negation, you make me feel so right to be wrong,
With empty phrases, you know itâs better not to speak,
Itâs false interaction, feeding lies as rhetorical wit,
Common sense is travesty, words wonât disguise the fraud.
