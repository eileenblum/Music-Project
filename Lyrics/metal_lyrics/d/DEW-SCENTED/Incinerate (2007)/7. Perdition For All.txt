[Music by Bache, Mueller, Werning â Lyrics by Jensen]

Remove the blindfoldâ¦ re-opened eyes still refuse the need to see,
Another excruciating process, repression in order to break free,
Revolting scenery of hostility, hear the screams from the ones you deceived,
Amoral burdens resume this isolation, shudder to think how this will endâ¦
Breeding â feeding â perdition for all. Take command, lay the sins to rest.

[Lead : Jeff Waters]

Decaying hope for absolution, observe the fear burning bright in their hearts,
Open wounds, void redemption, shatterâ¦ the torture wonât cease.
Causing â prompting â perdition for all. Seek remission, face the consequence,
Oh, how redeeming to crawl out of your skin!

[Lead : Gus G.]

Revolting scenery of hostility, hear the screams from the ones we deceived,
Amoral burdens resume this isolation, shudder to think how this will endâ¦
Repression â perdition for all. Repression â perdition for all!
Breeding â feeding â perdition for all. Take command, lay the sins to rest.
Causing â prompting â perdition for all. Seek remission, face the consequence.
