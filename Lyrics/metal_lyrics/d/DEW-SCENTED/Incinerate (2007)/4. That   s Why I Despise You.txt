[Music by Bache, Mueller, Werning â Lyrics by Jensen]

I sense the arrival of deceit, no longer I abide by this game of chance,
Reflecting eyes of an enemy, your declineâ¦ what a sight to behold!
Iâm blind with rage, I revel in contempt, betrayed and misled all along.
Coming out in your true colours, no more will I contend with your deliberate lies.
Endmost defection from my decay, Iâll leave the past,
Leave frustration and disdain well-off behind.
Thatâs why I despise you... I abhor every word that you speak.
Thatâs why I despise you... I detest every breath that you take.

[Lead: Bache]

Iâm blind with rage, I revel in contempt.
Iâm blind with rage, revel in contempt.
Iâll secure your damnation, bury you deep beneath my heart.
Battle-scarred perpetually, from your evanescent shadow I arise.
Iâm blind with rage, I revel in contempt, betrayed and misled all along.
I sense the arrival of deceit, no longer I abide by this game of chance,
Reflecting eyes of an enemy, your declineâ¦ what a sight to behold.
Thatâs why I despise youâ¦ I abhor every word that you speak.
Thatâs why I despise youâ¦ I detest every breath that you take.
