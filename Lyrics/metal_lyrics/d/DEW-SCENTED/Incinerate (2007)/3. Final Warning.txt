[Music by Bache, Mueller, Werning â Lyrics by Jensen]

Self-destructive glory, how can you never understand?! Itâs downhill from here.
A bitter dishonest fear shining in your eyes will never stop this world from turning.
Resisting words coming to an end, still havenât learnt a thing.
Final warning, here comes your judgement day.
Awaiting reality to shatter, the lies youâre calling safety,
Wonât hold you harmless when you fall!

[Lead : Bache / Lead: Mueller]

Foul, distant notion of false tranquillity at heart, it all amounts to nothing!

[Lead: Bache]

The hope you crave is swallowed by decay at last,
And still you will not listen. Final warning gone to waste.
Inciting the experience of regret, an all-consuming passion turns to emotional emptiness.
Resisting words coming to an end, still havenât learnt a thing,
Final warning, here comes your judgement day.
Self-destructive glory, how could you never understand? It went downhill from there,
A bitter, dishonest fear shining in your eyes, it didnât stop this world from turning.
