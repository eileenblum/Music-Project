[Music by Bache, Mueller, Werning â Lyrics by Jensen]

Be my guest, become a witness, this prosecution is now about to begin.
In conclusive assimilation, youâll comprehend the chaos within.
Raise me intoâ¦

Fail to save my sanity, out of perception,
Clear signs of a soul disturbed by definition.
Revelations of utopiaâ¦ Iâve crossed all lines of rationality.
I raise distress in search of true stability,
The need, the urge to soon escape from the delusion.
Awake, alive â still meant to choke in fantasies,
The will, the thrill, safe in hidingâ¦ now or never!
Thereâs something in betweenâ¦ now or never!
Iâll vent the anger when the time is rightâ¦
Darkest deeds in order to attain deliverance,
A narrow path unclosing realms of self-rejection.
Sacrificial deceitâ¦ I came, I saw but conquered nothing at all, Nothing at all!
As conformity neglects affliction, a twisted sanity is all that remains.

[ Lead : Bache ]

Now! Iâll vent my anger!
Now! The time is right!

[ Lead : Mueller]

Darkest deeds in order to attain deliverance,
A narrow path unclosing realms of self-rejection,
Sacrificial deceitâ¦ I came, I saw but conquered nothing at all.
Thereâs something in betweenâ¦ Now or never!
Iâll vent the anger when the time is rightâ¦
NOW! Iâll vent my anger! Now! The time is right!
Be my guest, become a witness, this prosecutionâs now about to begin.
In conclusive assimilation, youâll comprehend the chaos within.
NOW! Iâll vent my anger! NOW! The time is right!
As conformity neglects affliction, a twisted sanity is all that remains,
Thereâs something in betweenâ¦ Now or never!
Iâll vent my anger when the time is right!
