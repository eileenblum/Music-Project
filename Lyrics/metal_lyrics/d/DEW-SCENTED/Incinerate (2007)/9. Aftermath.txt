[Music by Mueller, Bache, Werning â Lyrics by Jensen]

With vile intentions, the ground erupts aflame,
Destructive mission, blood-covered handsâ¦ Aftermath!
Unchain predictions for all plagues to arise,
Dying times of pure and innocence.
Breathing in â Aftermath - Breathing out.
Prophetic, unrepented aftermath.
Witness at ease the downfall coming nearer,
Proclaim aloud the end of days,
Breaking out â Aftermath - Burning up,
Mutilation, desolation, aftermath!
A vain temptation to hold the reigns of death,
Obliterationâs crown youâll forever wear,
Signs of the end â Armageddon,
Apocalyptic soundtrack for the lost.

[ Lead : Mueller / Lead : Bache ]

With vile intentions, the ground erupts aflame,
Destructive mission, blood-covered hands,
Unchain predictions for all plagues to arise,
Dying times of pure and innocence.
Breathing in â Aftermath. Breathing out,
Prophetic, unrepented aftermath.
Breathing in â Aftermath. Breathing out,
Mutilation, desolationâ¦ Aftermath.
A vain temptation to hold the reigns of death,
Obliterationâs crown youâll forever wearâ¦
Aftermath!
