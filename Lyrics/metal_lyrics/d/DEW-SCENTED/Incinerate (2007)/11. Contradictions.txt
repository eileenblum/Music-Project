[Music by Mache, Werning, Mueller â Lyrics by Jensen]

Struggling to contain the inner balance suffocating aim.
Conflicts of virtue banned to remain locked up within,
Anguish ridden hearts of man, controlled by moral, exposed through regret.
In submission to ignorance, cease to resist the pressure applied.
Restrain the mortal quest for meaning with ever-growing apathy.
Contradictions â independency. A soul-searching decline.
Desperation, all that remains: Contradictions.

[ Lead : Bache ]

Claustrophobia, rotting spirit.
Consumed by panic, supreme anxiety.

[ Lead : Mueller ]

Contradictions, in determination, mind reset atrophy.
Degeneration in the midst of the fall: contradictions.
Struggling to contain the inner-balance suffocating aim.
Conflicts of virtue, banned to remain locked up within,
Determination, all that remains: Contradictions.
Contradictions. Independency, a soul-searching decline.
Anguish-ridden hearts of man, controlled by moral, exposed through regret,
Contradictionsâ¦ contradictions.
