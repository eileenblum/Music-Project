[Music by Mueller, Werning â Lyrics by Jensen]

They say life is for the learning, but enlightenment is to be past hope,
The journey is the reward in its termination. Join me as I declare everything undone.
False perception rewards with mockery, the will in me to strive for change has died.
Abstaining from illusion, the die is cast. Yet further exasperation wonât fail to come.
For the sake of calm I capitulate, I choose to rise above my fate amending purpose.
Vile resentment replaced by certainty, I canât await to see all order self-destruct,
Affront annihilation as final sacrifice, all hope is erased: Everything undone.
Apocalyptic torment, in the end: Everything undone.

[ Lead : Mueller ]

For the final of hours I celebrate,
Victory in defeat for all times.

[ Lead : Bache ]

For the sake of calm I capitulate, I choose to rise above my fate amending purpose.
False perception rewards with mockery, the will in me to strive for change has died.
Abstaining from illusion, the die is cast. Yet further exasperation wonât fail to come.
