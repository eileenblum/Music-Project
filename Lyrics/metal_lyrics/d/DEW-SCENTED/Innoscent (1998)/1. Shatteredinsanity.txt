Let's drown the confusion of blind sanity, these are the gates to the absurd
Upside down, then deeply inside out, stabbing away the origin of woe
No longer encaged by reality, the un-ending dream of anti-fantasy
Touching the spirit of decline, a perpetual enemy, blindly embracing shadows
Thoughtful in a world of no sense, with a truth full of lies
Alive in a shattered insanity, day after day and life after life, collapsing destiny
Daydreams raped in their pride, divine misery, this is the shattered insanity
Shattered insanity, down on your knees, wounded inhumane doctrines
Unbound from defeat, blindly embracing shadows, the distance from morbidity
Is the shelter of time, alive in a shattered insanity
Alive in a shattered insanity, day after day and life after life, the final certainty
Dead end of utter delight, the perennial quest, for an ever shattered insanity
Shattered insanity down on your knees...SLOW! The sanity of a world unsane
A masquerade, no more bound, no longer encaged, no more impaled
In a destiny soon burnt to ash
