Entangled in an everpresent veil, following the steps to infinity
Beware, don't hold me before I finish conquering the fortress
Just creep downwards and dig for affinity in the dirt
Only fools will join you, you are lost in this labyrinth called earth
Starspangled, reaching for light, starspangled, 1 2 3 4 freed
Thoughts, body and soul, aims are nothing but a frame
The power sleeps within, stand up and touch our sky
Nobody will seize you unless you fear
No relief, you are forever bound to reality
Scattered now and tomorrow, blinded by your fears for unending years, so go!
