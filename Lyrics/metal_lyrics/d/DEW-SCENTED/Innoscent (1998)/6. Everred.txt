Everred, the downfall of your soul, when passion and faith burn down to zero
A destination beyond the realm of no truth, and whatever you approach
The dream is over, so fond of vanity
See the light of the end, in a universe of scars and wounds
Within living memory, just confinement in red
A mindframe victimised by sin when fiction is real in a hall of mirrors
De-generation beneath the land of promise
Up in the garden of delight, for all lifetimes asleep on shades
The shroud of dignity will be stained with everred
