Proudly I dance with fatality, and bury silver in the name of gold
I enlighten the everdark as twilight rules these desert landsSneering, I sold my virginity, broken equilibrium
The future streams in rivers of blood, relentless passion of anti-entity
Graced by downfall, immortalised, devouring madness for an aentity
Godless seasons of obscenity, mindless fortune-spell, cast upon our aentity
