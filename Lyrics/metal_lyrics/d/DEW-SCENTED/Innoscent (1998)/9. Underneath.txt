Corrosive perception, the eternal zeal, mindtrapping devotion, the scorn of the void
Your urge to submit to the ascent of a few means corporal wit, a disguise for the blind
Parasite - try to stand upright, parasite - back underneath, yeah, underneath
Soulless compromise, the opportune rules, then descending unheard of
The merciless truth. Barefooted walk on broken glass, against the grain
And going nowhere
