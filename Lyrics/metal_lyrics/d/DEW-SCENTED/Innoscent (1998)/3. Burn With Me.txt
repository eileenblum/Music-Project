I toss up a coin to ease my last chance now
And stare with a smile when your light is gone
Yeah, I'm standing at the edge, engrained in red dread, I guess I'm caught eternally
As weak as I am, still I search high and low for a distance place
To dream away those years, but I will never fall from grace again
Just follow the beaten track 'cos all you give, you will get back
Desire - the final recollection, your fire once burnt in me
I bury my faith to further close your chapter
Saw the seedless grapes of wrath, and remain with pride in twilight
