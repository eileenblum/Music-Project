I went astray into the pleasure of her flesh, god of lies, you will surely understand
Scared? Yeah, I am scared, betrayed and lost, moving ahead in circles
Back and forth in pains
Untold pains as yesterday was born, she was secrets and shades
But as yesterday went by, a living hell
No escape from the treasures of her skin, gone all lies, still you will never understand
Shake! Yeah, shake with me my friend, your destiny is sealed till her love ends
But it won't end, behold! The day will come and lead you astray
Between darkness and light, a living sin, GO!
