Crawling for faith, almost turning away from this world
Within the sphere of addiction and dismay, betrayed, as purgatory unchains
The infinite doom won't ease the thirst for revenge
Rise onto decadence straying from the golden path to the black abyss
Where a million of dead thoughts roam, it is the apocalypse
To hang in the shreds of time, yeah these bleeding eyes can see
More than they bear...Bereaved
Bereaved of innocence, damned to leave the future behind, and follow the blind
Into the depths of oblivion, dreams of naked chaos, drowning in the ocean of reality
The aim to subsist is just further submission in vain
Fall to forever rise
