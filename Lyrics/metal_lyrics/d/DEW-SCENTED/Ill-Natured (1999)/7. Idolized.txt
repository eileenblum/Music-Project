Blasting The Silence
In Anti-Meaning Infamy
What An Addictive Enigma
You Wish - You`Ll Get
I See No Need To Follow
Coz I don't Want Despite
Save Your Courage For The Next
Tragedy In Line

I See The Verge Of The End
Fall
Rejoice In Idle Cycles Of Shame

don't Turn Back - don't Talk To Me
You Fuckin` Waste Of Pride
Pick Up The Pieces
Go Hunt Eternity
Obssessing Vanity
A Vicious Masquerade
I `M Gonna Be Two Steps Ahead
When You Fuck (Finally) Approach The End

Idolized
Leaning On Decline
The Apocalyptic Thrill

The Final Downfall
I See It Coming Up For You
Relentless Doom
Altered Perception
Idolized
