For A Precious Moment
Hidden Well From The Poisoning Light
Hell I Wish I Could

Come Cleanse My Mind
Hold These Hands For Eternities
And Disclose The Truth

Chaos...

Agony Feeds On Salvation
Unchaining Disguise
Diving Straight Into Damnation
Simplicity In Chaos

Touching Heavens In A Rush
Twisting Thoughts Of No Remorse
In A Labyrinth Of Passion
Victimized By Their Praise Of Crime

We Are Victimized
By Their Praise Of Crime
Yes; There Is Simplicity In Chaos

Sworn To Hold
Simplicity Forever
So How Could I
Expect Blessing In Chaos

Chaos...
