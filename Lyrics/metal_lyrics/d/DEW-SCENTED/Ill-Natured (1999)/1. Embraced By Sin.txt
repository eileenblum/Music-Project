Eyes Of Disgust
Stare At Me With Morbid Envy:
The Enemy Divine Kisses My Vain In Misery
"You'll Bleed Forever"
Abduction Sublime
Sharing The Shame To Fall Together

Right Through The Nether
A Working Mischief
Consume My Decaying Dreams

Embraced...

As The Pain Grows On
Search Reward In Desolation
Embraced By Sin

Out For Damnation
The Darkest In Man
Conceive My Decaying Dreams

Embraced...

And The Pain Grows On
Enshrine The Fear To Feed On Anger
Embraced By Sin

Eyes Of Disgust
Stare At Me With Morbid Envy:
The Ever-Blown Disease Is Twisting My Vain Into An
Elegy
"you'll Die Forever"
In Halflight I Stand Facing Again Self-Mutilation

Right Through The Nether
A Working Mischief
Consume My Decaying Dreams

Embraced...
