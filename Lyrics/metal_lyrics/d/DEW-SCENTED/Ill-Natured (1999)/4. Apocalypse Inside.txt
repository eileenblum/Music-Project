Inside Is Consuming
Anxieties Domain
Declining Will Within Myself
Is So Hard To Contain

My Time Running Out
Will I Survive
My Life Wastes Away
Still In Decline

Apocalypse Inside

Inside There Is Nothing
When Once There Was Concern
You Do Not Exist To Me
The Point Of No Return

My Time Running Out
Will I Survive
My Life Wastes Away
Still In Decline
My Trust You Have Defied
Hate Personified
Mental Suicide
Apocalypse Inside
I Am Losing Myself
You don't Want To Find Me
Alone With What I Have Become

Inside With Myself Now
And I Cannot Get Free
can't Get Out From Under My Skin
And Escape Misery
My Time Running Out
Will I Survive
My Life Wastes Away
Still In Decline
My Trust You Have Defied
Hate Personified
Not Indemnified
Apocalypse Inside

I Am Losing My Mind
Remaining Hidden Inside
Alone With What I Have Become
