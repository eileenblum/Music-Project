Into Perdition
Too Many Words Remain Yet Untold
So Here I Am
Achieving Godform And Instilling Decay
Forget The Past
don't Hide Your Feelings Away From Me Now
Bow- Be- Forever
Crawl For Redemption In Anguish Divine

Surrender The Earth
With The Dawn A New Strength Will Rise Now
Living Lies Of Denial
In Madness We Approach The Sun Again; Yes
A Final Deliverance
Leave The Fever Of Mankind Behind
In Lifeless Enigma
At One With The Sky we'll Burn Tonight

Skybound
Bow-Be-Forever
Skybound...

Panic
Anxiety
The Ultimate Affliction In Your Eyes
Centuries
Milleniums
Reduced To Ruins In Intimate Disguise
Skybound-Skybound-Skybound

Transcending
From Birth To Death
Escaping
Skybound
