Ashes to life, dust of light
Retaining the scars of reality
Never looking back in shame
Still never to return

Into the void of time, disciple of norms
Resist this pressure, only for today it will last
In search of newborn hope
Marching towards, never to return

Repent to perish
No sin undone, forgotten, unforgiven
A celebration to disrupt
Nature burns in cycles, tragedies of self-made gloss

Ashes to life, dust of light
Burning the bridge to our history
Never to redeem from curse
Still never to return
Out to amend our trail, devour the past
Inherit knowledge, divination clean from fear
Empowered by the vain in progress
Storming onwards, never to return

And from enslavement we rose to prevail
Marching forwards, storming onwards into the light
Seizing the shadows of agony to cover the cause

Retaining the scars of reality
Never looking back in shame
Never to return

Into the void of time, disciple of norms
Resist this pressure, only for today it will last
In search of newborn hope
Marching towards, never to return

And from enslavement we rose to prevail
Marching forwards, storming onwards into the light
Seizing the shadows of agony to cover the cause

Repent to perish
No sin undone, forgotten, unforgiven
A celebration to disrupt
Nature burns in cycles, tragedies of self-made gloss

Never!
