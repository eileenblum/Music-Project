It's desperation I can see right through your feeble eyes
Glance of doubt, full of dismay
An escape into foul disguise
Locked away, praise the downfall through your veins
Hurt, broken, deceived
Cast out, left behind, the prison of reason

Deliverance to an everyday hell
Start right here
Disclosed anti-state of mind
Waking up in a temporary dreams
To face continual decay forever
All hope is lost, your fate is sealed
Condemned to silence
Destiny is dead consolidation, the prison of reason
Go!
The prison of reason!

Now that you agree to discord
You agree to discord
Repeat these words not your own
Words not your own
"In denial I trust"
In denial, in denial
The prison of reason!
Deliverance to an everyday hell
Start right here!

It's desperation I can see right through your feeble eyes
Glance of doubt, full of dismay
An escape into foul disguise
Locked away, praise the downfall through your veins
Hurt, broken, deceived
Cast out, left behind, the prison of reason

Now that you agree to discord
You agree to discord
Repeat these words not your own
Words not your own
"In denial I trust"
In denial, in denial
The prison of reason!
The prison of reason!
Everyday hell
