At the dawn of thoughts I cherish the forsaken hope in what remains once
I leave reality,
in-humanity
Induce the principles of nature
Redeemed onset conceptual end
End
In the dead of notion
Matter-of-fact? Obliteration!
Too much to see, too blind my eyes at last

Heading for termination
Architects of dismay
Carnal superstitions
Retrospective decay
Indulge remorseless imperfection
Rejoice in this conceptual end

I came the praise the end!
Observe the rise to take the fall...
Conceptual end
The hollow writings on the wall...
Conceptual end

Come on!

Heading for termination
Architects of dismay
Carnal superstitions
Retrospective decay
Induce the principles of nature
Redeemed onset conceptual end
I came the praise the end!
