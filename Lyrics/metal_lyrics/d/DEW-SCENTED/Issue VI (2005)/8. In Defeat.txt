Pretend to smile at me one very last time
Your glance is full of fraud, venomous treason
How do you manage to explain and say no words?
What are you trying to feel when you've empty body and mind?

Again and again
Unspoken defeat

You stand crossing the arms, forbidden touch
Abstain, avoid to breathe, hiding sympathy
When did you choose to object and change your fate?
Who did you think would care?
While you walk away I'll frown...

How can I win if there's nothing to lose?
Rejected, banished, tossed away for good...
There is no cure, these wounds won't heal
No vanity in defeat

Once and for all
Unspoken defeat

A thousand times I'll end in nothingness
Denied, refused, forever pushed aside
And on my own I'll think aloud: no vanity in defeat

Pretend to smile at me one very last time
Your glance is full of fraud, venomous treason
How do you manage to explain and say no words?
What are you trying to feel when you've empty body and mind?

With hopelessness as shelter
I'll define myself anew

You stand crossing the arms, forbidden touch
Abstain, avoid to breathe, hiding sympathy
When did you choose to object and change your fate?
Who did you think would care?
While you walk away I'll frown...

Again and again
Unspoken defeat
Once and for all
Unspoken defeat
