Decepting visions, dead dreams in living forms
To re-awake from retribution
Forlorn defeat, all faith is sacrificed
Too blind to see this misdirection

Ruins of hope
Incarnated lies
Ruins of hope
Mesmerized pride

Disguised decline, the playground of all fears
Before my eyes, just imperfection
Despised belief, impersonation of fate
Enhance the own predestination

Ruins of hope
Disembolved trust
Ruins of hope
Future disclosed

Decepting visions, dead dreams in living forms
To re-awake from retribution
Forlorn defeat, all faith is sacrificed
Too blind to see this misdirection

In final absence of guilt
No regrets for what's left behind
To reroute destiny
Ruins of hope

Ruins of hope
Incarnated lies
Ruins of hope
Mesmerized pride

Disguised decline, the playground of all fears
Before my eyes, just imperfection
Despised belief, impersonation of fate
Enhance the own predestination

Decepting visions, dead dreams in living forms (living forms)
Forlorn defeat, all faith is sacrificed (sacrificed)
