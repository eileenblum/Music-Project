Daylight crawls inside
A wasted state this empty slate
Looking back before the memories
Vortex of promise paled and chances failed
This misanthrope's disease
I've torn apart this charcoal heart
No shred of decency, all that remains

Escape from all your pain
Vortex
Escape from all your pain

Dissolving crimson stains
The spiteful past to come undone
A chance to set things right as last for me
Vortex of chances gained in ending failure
A mission soon fulfilled
I'll leave behind this dreadful shell
No sign of sympathy, I'll live to tell

Escape from all your pain
Vortex
Escape from all your pain

The wounds of time
Endtime is fading away
These scars remain to wish to hide
The wounds of time
Endtime is fading away
These scars remain to wish to hide
Vortex

Into the memorial virtual vortex
Matter and motion endlessly
Into the memorial virtual vortex
Matter ad motion endlessly inndisguise

The wounds of time
Endtime is fading away
These scars remain to wish to hide
The wounds of time
Endtime is fading away
These scars remain to wish to hide
Vortex

Daylight crawls inside
A wasted state this empty slate
Looking back before the memories
Vortex of promise paled and chances failed
This misanthrope's disease
I've torn apart this charcoal heart
No shred of decency, all that remains

Escape from all your pain
Vortex
Escape from all your pain
Vortex
