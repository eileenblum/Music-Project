My sense is running away now
Contagious indecision outgrowing myself
Puzzled and torn apart I promised disobedience in vain

I can't control myself, I will not come through
Anxiety, no quarter to be ever found
I seek redemption in a world of no rest
No will, no power, acknowledge weakness sublime
Symbols of descent
Downwards and neverending
Victory of loss
Witness my ceremonial end

And while I breathe I suffocate
Performed rituals of time
Unreleased from these chains
In rituals of time
Essential patterns in a final exchange
Remove the veil, resistance overcome
As thoughts collide then with friction I rise
Born of nothing, eternal rituals of time
Within my self
Extermination
Virtues out of necessity

My life is fading away now
Comforting in dilution
Outdoing the will
Hopeless and broken in I promise disobedience in vain

I can't control myself, I will not come through
Anxiety, no quarter to be ever found
I seek redemption in a world of no rest
No will, no power, acknowledge weakness sublime
Symbols of descent
Downwards and neverending
Victory of loss
Witness my ceremonial end

My sense is running away now
Contagious indecision outgrowing myself
Puzzled and torn apart
I promised disobedience in norms
