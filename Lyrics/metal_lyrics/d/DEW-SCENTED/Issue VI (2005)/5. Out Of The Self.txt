In condition critical, mindframe of contempt
Rejecting all emotions just to see what there is left
Retaliation, thorns of the soul
Inner souls of anger will add silence to this broken voice

Screaming in out just to go unheard
Out of the self

Now...
Perceive to understand

Pushing it in, pushing it out to release the pain (and) to spread the fire
Out of the self
Isolated in a maze, disclosure in disdain
Annihilating principles with no sense of guilt
Interaction, right to the wrong
Language of betrayal set to choke on words with empty flow

Out of the self

Now...
Pretend to comprehend
Turning it in, turning it out to remove the fear (and) to fuel the flames
Out of the self

Screaming it out just to go unheard
Out of the self!

In condition critical, mindframe of contempt
Rejecting all emotions just to see what there is left
Retaliation, thorns of the soul
Inner souls of anger will add silence to this broken voice

Now...
Perceive to understand

Pushing it in, pushing it out to release the pain (and) to spread the fire
Out of the self
Turning it in, turning it out
Out of the self
Pushing it in, pushing it out
Out of the self
Turning it in, turning it out
Out of the self
Pushing it in, pushing it out
