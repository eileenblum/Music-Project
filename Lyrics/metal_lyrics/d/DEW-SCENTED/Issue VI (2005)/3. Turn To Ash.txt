I've come to face the final task
Rituals of gracing shape, in ambivalence
For another higher sphere (for another higher sphere)
Put out the lights to disappear

Indulgent oblivion
In lifeless dreams
When will I ever come to be?

I praise the end, counting down the days
Celebrate the past, misgiving aflame
Weighing souls to persist forevermore
I vanish into dust

Turn to ash...
Lasting progress
Endless quest
Symbolic scattering...
In search of truth I'll turn to ash
To be...
To be prepared to rise and take the fall
To end

Turn to ash...
Lasting progress
Endless quest
Symbolic scattering...

Indulgent oblivion
In lifeless dreams
When will I ever come to be?
I've come to face the final task
Rituals of gracing shape, in ambivalence
For another higher sphere (for another higher sphere)
I will turn to ash
