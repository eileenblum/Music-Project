Go!
Reborn from plague to spread disorder
Uprising start to the end of your age
Deep in your self eternal wastelands of apathy roam
Confining sense with fulfilling neglect
Carried through by the presence of faith
Seeking privilege...

Bled dry
Neverending endtime
Bled dry
Everblinding endtime
Bled dry
Infestation of the soul
Bled dry
The beginning of the fall

Awareness of guilt, you wear the scars with no pride in your flesh
Riveting force of emptiness bound
Bleeding through a lifetime of sin
Before my eyes you...

Bled dry
Neverending endtime
Bled dry
Everblinding endtime
Bled dry
Infestation of the soul
Bled dry
The beginning of the fall

Go!
Deep in your self eternal wastelands of apathy roam
Confining sense with fulfilling neglect
Carried through by the presence of faith
Seeking privilege...

Bled dry
Neverending endtime
Bled dry
Neverending endtime
Everblinding
