[Sa:]
Transmogrified
By the beauty of this phobia
I thought I had seen them all
And forgotten was my wish
To find life
In this world of misery
My tiny passionflower
This is meant for you and forever

[Tan:]
Return me to these days
Where no sin ever caused pains
Please recover my bitter loss
And put an end to my disgrace

[Repeat sa+tan]

Far afield the sky
But your perfume brightens my faith
No more I dream
My trivial round is my kingdom
I touch the maze
To feel reborn in purity
Just listen to my words
I was made for you and forever

For you and forever I die
