[Chorus:]
Under a veil I sleep swirling 
Send down, failure may devour me
Cry it out and create my own sunrise
Insight, dream of states
I would love to lie in

To be a clear ageless cascade of best water
Tears are cream to me, eternity

[Repeat chorus]

To be the arome of nature, attend the clouds
See how I gather joy around me, serenity

Predestined to be an idolatrous myth
An everlasting temple of calm
Echoes of deviation from the harms of life
Descend into me and comprehend

[Repeat chorus]

To be for all mermaids a father, equinox rain
Far afield from dismay, paradise's path
