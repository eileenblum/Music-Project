Delicate downfall
Impetus, so now fly

[Fu:]
Sincerely begging your pardon in a solemn mood
I proclaim my sorrow, the answer to your dreams
My quondam time is the quondam time in ruins
Compassion, wreath of roses, ecstasy

[Ck:]
Sue for the passed moments, the empire of rain
I proclaim my sorrow, the only distant place
My quondam time is the quondam time in ruins
Reality, drink the blood and weave all suffering

Faith, man is weak and so is love
Dust, memories are just blindest quests, chains
Aid, the rebirth of sin will take us back
To the garden of loss
Stand up, what are we dying for

Soulless figures crying with a smile
Mysteries, tears build up stairs

[Repeat fu+ck]
