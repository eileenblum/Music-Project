Sweet, yes, your cold skinless body 
And I feel the rain
As if teardrops crushed my head
But never I will regret my faults
Wandering of spirits
Clearness of symbols, black is the day

Summerland, preside over me
Darkside consuming all happiness
Burdened with guilt
Wasting all flowers, jealousy

Wait, no, do not think that I am helpless
I just stand to fall back
Crawling towards life
When living is exquisite and excessive
You better jump into mankind
Loss of sight, yeah, black is the day

Ail, no, it enters my veins now
So fall down on your knees
Awakening of consciousness
Blooming through my eyes
My dearest enigma
Petals on a wet, black is the day

Hey, father, take me away from here
But I keep for myself
Unveiling my existence Show sympathy for the forgotten
The end of breeding
Reality fades as black is the day

Destiny, embrace me with warmth
Darkness, take pain as she is
Stimulation, revealing in innocence
Affinity, so black is our day.
