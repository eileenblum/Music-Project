Fragments of fear
A bombcrash before me
Whispering of lust
As blind as always
A prayer so vast
The reek of fortune
Is thicker than blood
Born in vain

[Mor:]
Captured in life
Blank my memory 
Erased is my past
Nowhere I am standing
Nowhere to rest
Times without a number 
I have been pleading for being
Left in silence

[Bid:]
Impression of impurity
The thrill to kill grows stronger

Forever in your mind
An insane thought keeps burning 
Your sanctuary brings the seas to part
It is sincerely what rules our fears

[Repeat mor+bid]
