[Ev:]
Solemn promise of desolation, a bliss
An epic summoning for redemption
Purify us from temptation, love
The sunrise dies away all woe

[Il:]
Observe through its shadows
The doleful green moon

The dismal ashlar upon the altar provokes
That golden cascades turn into stone
Perceive the astral perfumation, a cry
It is not a symbol of salvation

Spell of burden engraved on the sky 
Bypath to nowhere, await life's dawn
Await life's dawn, lamb of god!

Mourn
Tarish my dreams you delicate aeon
To behold the ruins seems externally numb 
Yonder
In the meantime to glory retaliate my past
The ardour of loss is casting a spell on us

[Repeat ev+il]

Anthem of dust, that indelible flame
An indelible flame whispers flesh
Gone
