[Fi:]
I would like to welcome you to a deeper sphere
Where only innocence fills the air
And previous trouble and all its secrets
Fall now apart
Like being renewed by closing your eyes
Slowly return from hell and start 
To colour your grey and breathe the new day
And all your past is passed forever

[Re:]
Afterlife, hope you can feel me
I feel deeper than I ever expected
Listening to the sound of the bell
You will see the drift
Let us understand
That we are poor fucked- up humans

[Repeat fi+re]

Afterlove, dress up in memories
Soon you will notice that you just saw it all
Listening to the voice from beyond 
You will reveal in lust
Can't you understand 
That the first fruits are poisoned
