Recollect, your eyes were tearing
A twilight through the nature
Bleeding a "goodbye"
I deny your voice so distant
A paradise upon the seas
Is waving to end
No more life, no more victims
With burdened wings, depression

[Chorus:]
From deep within each eye is sweating
A twilight through the nature
Bleeding a "goodbye"
No more life, no more victims
With burdened wings, depression
In flames we stand, in dread we trust
A paradise upon the seas
Is waving to end

Deceived, turned is the day to night
Moments of pleasure
In an infinite and vast cry
Call me and recover the earth with beauty
I am drenched with anger
So set them off to fly and die

Dance my friends
Their days are soon to end
Doom on later, fall now apart
Dance my friends
Your days are soon to end
Crawl on faster, I speak to myself. 
Through me the sun will burn
Enraptured in a labyrinth of tears
This fortune dies down with ardour
Enraptured, never to care, in flames.

[Repeat chorus]
