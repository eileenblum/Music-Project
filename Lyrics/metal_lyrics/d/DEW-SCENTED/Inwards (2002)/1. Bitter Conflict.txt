Inner decay divine for all
Abysmal pain sleep under the skin
A fatal endless maze of shame
Is killing pride in self annihilation

Look in my eyes
Remnants of lust
Join the bitter conflict now

Feeding on anger
Beholding the cries of dismay
In a bitter conflict

Come on...
Arise, stand strong
Disciples of the fall
A living lust of war inside
For all is set to end for all
We are sworn to fuckin' live through and prevail

A force-fed suffering
To embrace your private agony
As just another casualty
While I show you we are all servants of fear

Feeding on anger
Beholding the cries of dismay
Unconditional hate eternal

A force-fed suffering
To embrace your private agony
As just another casualty
While I show you we are all servants of fear
