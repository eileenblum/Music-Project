I've tried it twice but all in vain
I've seen it come but far too late
Sometimes it's easier to swallow pain as pain

Inwards
Lifeless
A bitter soul in shades

Unbroken chains
Again and again

This fear I can not hide
Inwards
It's inside

Here I go again with blinded sight
Into my universe of time
Inner higher praise of spiritual decay
Terminal state of confusion
Yes, I know, I'm hard to penetrate

I won't complain
It's my own perception
And I need to fucking lie for one more day...
