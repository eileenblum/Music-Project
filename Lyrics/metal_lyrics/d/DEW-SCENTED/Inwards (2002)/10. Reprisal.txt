No remorse, no tolerance
I felt you spit on my back
The time has come to take revenge
And put an end to this fraud

I can take no more excuses
I saw you lie in my face
I'm here to get you a rightful payback
Full-on reprisal at last

Watch out
I show no mercy
I just reject this pain
I won't step back no more
Reprisal

Here it comes
Reprisal

I feed on anger
No more regrets
Get your shit out of my fuckin' way

I feel the rage
The taste of fist
Here it comes my violent reprisal

Watch out
I show no mercy
I just reject this pain
I won't step back no more
There is no hiding
Reprisal
I bet you won't forget this
