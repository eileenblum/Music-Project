You mindless sinners
Hopeless souls of black
Scream forth
In pains
Soon to be locked in motion

Falling away from the self
Into the empty rooms of death
Finding what you deserve
Feel free to enjoy your last breath
Lack of choice, in a trap
You hit the final dead end path
And you won't move 'cause you can't see
it's a constant killing pain inside

Locked in motion
Some wounds are just never meant to heal

You are locked in motion
And I'm here to watch you fade away

At loss of words you lie
There is no turning back
No remorse
And i won't take the fucking blame

Locked in motion
