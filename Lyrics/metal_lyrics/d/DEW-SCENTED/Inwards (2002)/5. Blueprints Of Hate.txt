Witness the blueprints of hate

Weeding out the hope forlorn
Following a stronger will in vain
Self indulgence

Agony forever more
Forsaken spite, the final thrill
Another blessing in disguise

Bastard nation
I fucking have the need to hate
Into despite, out of control

In-decision
Mercenary venture blast
In to despite control

Hypocrisy in-tolerance
All ways go down
Go down
Come here to face me
Displaying the anger
The blueprints of hate

These are blueprints of hate
I'm sworn to resist in a world full of lie
These are blueprints of hate
I'm sworn to resist in a world full of lie

World of lie
So full of agony inside
Releasing these blueprints of hate
Full Of Lie
