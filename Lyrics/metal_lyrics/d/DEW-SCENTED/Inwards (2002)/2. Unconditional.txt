Aright retribution of thoughts
The strongest pain is fine to me

Criminal desire
Addictive acts of mind control
Unconditional
Internal pain
The unconditional retreat

Eternal cycles of power
Feed on the weakness of the mass
Beneficial rapture
A saint in the name of decadence
Unconditional
Impending doom
The unconditional retreat awaits

A new world order
But still the same
"What does not kill you"
"Just makes you stronger"
And it does!

Stand still, you suckers, now
This punishment is for you

New world order!

Unconditional
False perception of sense
Unconditional
Witnessing your fall
