Thrive mental genocide
Obscure the thoughts
As worlds collide in doubt
Hide in the shadow of the mass

In-different sense
Slave to digital disease

The evolution discharge
Relentless force
I'm in a world of no control
A system bound to drop dead

Dependent soul
Slave to digital disease

Great endless fear
The power of the inner word
Never to comprehend
It's all within your mind
Vortex of emotions
Surrounded by the plague
Technology of murder
Survival reaction in a terminal mindstrip

Terminal mindstrip
Soul in decay
Terminal mindstrip
Survival reaction in a terminal mindstrip

In-different sense
A slave to destiny
