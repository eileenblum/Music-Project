Emerging from loss
Through spheres of downfall divine
Annihilate
In a all-dead dimension
Embers of anger
Revolting passion from inside
Obliterate
This is the art of mutilation

So gently unleashed
Degeneration

Escaping the maze
In cries of uncreation
Annihilate
With an all-killing lust
The sounds of chaos
Whisper in pains your final words
Obliterate
This is the curse of mankind

So sweetly devoured
Degeneration

Annihilate
Obliterate
Inside my head
Degeneration

Degenerate
