Revolt from immaterial blindness to see
We live forlorn, we lost our will
tossing up the fist in rage
avenging moments
now hail the DARKNESS OF THE SOUL...

eyes wide open...
welcome NEW FOUND PAIN!

defeat as the flesh decays to shreds
we hold no STRENGTH within ourselves
beholding the coming of dismay
pain for pleasure
no hope, no bliss, no turning back
-back...

shudder to think...
welcome NEW FOUND PAIN!

I...I feed on torture
EVER-LASTING PAIN

Pain!
NEW FOUND PAIN!
Pain!
welcome NEW FOUND PAIN!
