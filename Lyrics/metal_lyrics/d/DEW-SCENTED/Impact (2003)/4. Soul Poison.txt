Behold the emptiness divine
SHAPELESS EYES OF BLIND, COLD AS ICE
the weakness of the flesh shines through
in final premonition...

soul poison!
numbing out...
soul POISON!
numbing out...

shadows of existence
SALVATION OF THE SPIRIT NEVERMORE
portraits of DILUTION
betrayal of the body falls in place

absent-minded...
HEAR MY INNER CRIES...

hiding from the demons of the self
fragments to display, dread within
the affliction of the wish in prime
IN PERFECT isolation...

I DO RESIGN!

soul poison!
numbing out...
soul POISON!

I RESIGN!

soul POISON!
