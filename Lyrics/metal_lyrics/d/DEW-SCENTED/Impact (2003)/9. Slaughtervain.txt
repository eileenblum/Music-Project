You're weaving bloodlust with instigation
producing scenes of intimidation
a footstep CLOSER TO THE GRAVE
fuck with the mind of those who can't see...

SLAUGHTERVAIN
see...SLAUGHTERVAIN

REVEL IN POOLS OF BLOOD
stand, victorious, shame notorious
celebrating decay, no guilty conscience
PAST REDEMPTION YOU FALL
DEFENDER OF SENSE AND bringer of pain
ANNIHILATION UNFOLDS...
onwards you go!

SLAUGHTERVAIN
go...SLAUGHTERVAIN

ill-breeding knowledge of absolution
creating hollow mortal landscapes of dust
a footstep CLOSER TO THE GRAVE
play with the lives of those with no say...

VICTIMS OF SIN!!!
IN SLAUGHTERVAIN YOU BURY YOUR DEAD
VICTIMS OF SIN!!!
IN SLAUGHTERVAIN, DESTINY'S END!

release the slaughtervain at last, it's a crucifixion times
A GENOCIDAL CONSTITUTION, NO CALL FOR REGRETS
