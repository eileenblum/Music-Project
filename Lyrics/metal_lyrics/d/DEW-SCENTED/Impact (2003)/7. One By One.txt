The path is paved since the first days of time
we lack of choices in these realms of decline

controlling virtue, guidance disposed
it stands to reason for survival sublime

consumed by anguish we march through the grey
full loss of power in this corporate grave
IN GLOBAL ORDER, SYSTEM DECLINES
THESE ARE TWO RULES WE MUST LEARN TO OBEY...

DON'T QUESTION TWICE! IT'S ONE BY ONE...DON'T THINK YOURSELF!
THEORY IS WISDOM, PRACTICE IS GAIN

BASTARDS - TAKE IT FROM US!
BASTARDS - ONE BY ONE!

consumed by anguish we march through the grey
these are two rules we must learn to obey...

DON'T QUESTION TWICE! IT'S ONE BY ONE...DON'T THINK YOURSELF!
THEORY IS WISDOM, PRACTICE IS GAIN

BASTARDS - TAKE IT FROM US!
BASTARDS - ONE BY ONE!
