Destination hell!
I WILL SEE YOU BURNING BRIGHT
you'll shatter, you'll surrender
just another perfect day to die
forwards, DESTINATION HELL!

as your body is restless, dead and gone
embrace the arrival of this DESOLATION
YOU EXPOSED A VIRGIN SOUL IN VAIN
there is no salvation, YOU ARE GOD-FORSAKEN!

I observe you bleeding dry
companion in misfortune
AND TODAY YOU FALL FROM GRACE AGAIN
progressed way of the cross

as horizons darken and skies fall
you are seeking your exile in absolution
NOBODY LISTENS when you pray
GO DOWN THE ABYSS OF CONDEMNATION

LAKE OF FIRE
illumination
wages of SIN
DOGMAS of DISGRACE
