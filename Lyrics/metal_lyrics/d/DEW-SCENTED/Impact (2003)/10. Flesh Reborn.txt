Incarnated transmigration
between your life and their death
INNER SEARCH FOR CONDONATION
the plea for mercy goes unheard

just pull the trigger
one to the heart, two to the head
perpetual choices you make
take your lives, play your games

terminal disruption
long fuckin' live the new flesh!
cold-blooded fire in your eyes
long fuckin' live the new flesh!
released degeneration
long fuckin' live the new flesh!
behold the bringer of pain...
(long fuckin' live the new flesh!)

unleash the fears of THE END
WE'VE FALLEN FAR FROM THE CROSS
both hands are tainted with blood
in dying mode...

you saw the seeds of disgrace
THE BURNING SIN
unchain the flames of reason
witness my fall, comfort me...
ONTO BITTERNESS
