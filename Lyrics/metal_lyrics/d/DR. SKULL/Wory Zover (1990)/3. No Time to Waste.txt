We're young, no time to waste
Just think of the pleasures you can taste

Girl, I see you're alone
Time is on the run, you've got to go on
Listen, I'm singing for you
Let me make you smile and join the pieces torn

They say you've been crying and crying for years
Yesterday's gone you're still wasting your tears

We're young

Girl, you're deep in the blue
Seem to be away when I am calling you
Listen, you don't know what you're missing
Look into my eyes, see my love is true

They say you're been crying and crying for years
Yesterday's gone you're still wasting your tears

We're young
We're young, no time to waste
