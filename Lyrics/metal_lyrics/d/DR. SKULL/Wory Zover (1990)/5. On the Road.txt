Here we are on the road again
Nothing's left to miss behind
Here we are free, here we go again
Destination home town

The engine's hot on fire
The wheels turn in our way
Guitars on the backseat, we are
Driving, rolling, rocking the highway

On the road, the road again
Have to carry the load again

Got a long way, the load is heavy
Got the guitars, got the drums
Be waiting, I'm coming to you baby
I'm so blind, I'm in trance

No trouble, no worry
Ain't got no sense of fury
Sound of motor is brain buster
I'm a driver, that's my story

On the road, the road again
Have to carry the load again
