Every night wakes me wild
Nightmares of the past
Everyday it's the same
Memories and pictures under rust
I never knew it could happen
Keeps so sad
I've chained myself to freedom
Drives me mad

Now I cannot feel the shining sun
Things goin' on but I can no more see
Fading in the deepest darkness
No gettin' in, no gettin' out
So I've got a feeling I can't stop

It's the shame on you
It's the shame on me
My baby's gonna leave the blame on me
It the shame on you
It's the shame on me
Shut to my face, Gate of Brandenburg

Shut to my face, gate of hate...
