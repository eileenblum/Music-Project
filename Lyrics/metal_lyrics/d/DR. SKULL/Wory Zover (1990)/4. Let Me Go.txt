Desires dissolving in the time
Nothing's left to hide
It's the end of the road
It's the end

Tear drops falling
You still keep on calling, I won't hear
I don't care anymore
I don't care

Let me go (Let me go away)
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna, I don't wanna stay no more

Girl, please don't ask for pity
Tonight I'm gonna leave this city of prison
Break my chains, I'll disappear
Break my chains

Let me go...

I want to make you see
I just can't go on like this baby
Smile on the faces
Ice in the eyes it's drivin' me crazy

Hoo, hey. I don't wanna stay...
Let me go (Let me go away)
I don't wanna stay
Let me go (Let me go away)
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay no more

Let me go away...
