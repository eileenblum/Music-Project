Every morning when I wake up
I remember your smile and your touch
Every evening when the sun is setting
I wish I didn't love you so much

You carried me in your arms, baby
You helped me see the light
I'm nobody without you, baby
Don't leave me in the night

Baby, I love you like I'm up in the skies
Baby, don't give me no more lies
Baby, I want you, baby, don't bring me down
Baby, I need you, don't leave me now

I promise there will be a million stars
If you'll only share them with me
I'm singing my love song through these bars
Cause my love can set me free

You carried me in your arms, baby
You helped me see the light
I'm nobody without you, baby
Don't leave me in the night

Baby, I love you
