Well, I'm looking at this mess, it's jest
I don't wanna read it, all the rest
You eat my body, you eat my brain
I ain't got nobody to stop this train

Here I feel I can explode (I can explode)
Right away time gets short

Everyday every night
You just gotta keep on fight for your right
Everyday every night
Fighting for a livin', livin' for a fight

Let them kick your ass, piss over your face
You don't need no make-up, asshole lookin' nice
All in uniforms bloody suckin' worms
Smashin' your face to shit, asshole won't you quit

Don't you feel you can explode (You can explode)
How'd you hold this heavy load

Everyday every night...

How do you feel?

Here I sit all alone, I'm in trouble
Waiting for the sun, nothing is so easy
Here I stand all alone, I'm in trouble
Time is on the run, nothing is so easy
We are to find 'nother way
We are to find 'nother day

Black has soul, white has power
White is rich, black is poorer
Black is beauty, black is fine
White is dancing on the line
Everyday every night, everyday every night

Everyday every night...
