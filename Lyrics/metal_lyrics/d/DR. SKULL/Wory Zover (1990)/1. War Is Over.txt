Now, the war is over
It's time to leave the guns
No one has the power to fight or to run
Millions died and millions are wounded in pain
Soldiers promised not to fight again
Soldiers promised not to fight

Unaware of humanity,
We've learnt to kill at first
We have spoilt the nature, built factories of dirt
Millions died from hunger, money's spent for guns
Now it's over, peace overcomes
Now it's over and it's gone

Innocents will die no more
Children will cry no more
Fighting jets will fly no more
War will be a bad dream hurried in the past
War will be a word children won't understand
War will be a bad dream hurried in the past
War will be a word, just a word...
