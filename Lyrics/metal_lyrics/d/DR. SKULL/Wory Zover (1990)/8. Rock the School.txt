Why don't you come out with me rockin' tonight
Don't think about the teacher hold me tight
I know you're waiting for a good mark baby
Come on and get a good mark from me

Rock the school, roll the teacher
Rock the school, roll the teacher

You know it's hot on fire
You know love is to desire
Don't believe, everybody's liar

You say your mom's gonna tear you away
Nobody's gonna tear you, I'll be there
Your teacher says a good girl you'll never be
She told me too but I'm a good boy you see

Rock the school
You know it's hot on fire
You know love is to desire
Don't believe everybody's liar
