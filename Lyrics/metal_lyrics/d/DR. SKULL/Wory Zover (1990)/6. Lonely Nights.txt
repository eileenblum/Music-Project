Sleepless nights burning through my eyes
And I won't tell you no more lies
(I miss you, I miss you)
Can't you see I am dying
I promised not to cry and waiting by the phone
But you won't call

Never been so helpless before
Since you left and you shut the door
Curtains closed I am smoking
I only need your voice and lovely smile
Forgive me, I was wrong

I see how much I love you
Life is so hard without you

Lonely nights, I'm burning
Lonely nights, I can't take this no more

Lonely nights, lonely nights
Don't break my heart
