I will follow and I will find you
I will always be behind you
Hold me like you never did before
You're comin' on and never waiting for me?

I will get you everywhere
This is only what I care
I will get you, I will, I will get you
I will get you wherever you are
I will get you wherever you are
Oha! Little bitch

Nail me, jail me, you can kill me
But everything you've got to tell me
Try to lie me if you can
When I'm bored, I'm gonna set you free
