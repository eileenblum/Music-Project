I was lost, I sat outside
I was gonna lose my mind
I thought I was gone out of this blinding sign
Dark and red was the night
Was it brown the day
Shy and bored and confused all the way

I've noticed I've got a heart beat
It's beating eighty per minute
My body possess the vessels of blood
Well, I'm breathing

Life is rolling over
I've got soul to live it stronger

Sat through the night
Rubbed and wild inside
Raising my head up
(In the mirror) I saw a smiling brat

I've noticed

I needed someone to love
I needed no one to care
I would change all the world
But I can't live eternally

I've noticed
