I see you sitting at the snack -- bar
I see you waiting by the wall
Can you hear me running on the railroad?
Can you hear me call?

I know that I can never touch you
I know that I can never hold your hand
Can you hear me, I can't live without you
Can you understand?

Take my hand, I want to take you where I live
Be my friend, I've got to show you how I feel
If you only let me love you
Let me show you, let me prove you
How I want you to be mine
To be my princess
Ooh, be my princess
Oooh...

Take my hand
