Help me to find my way home
So far away
Don't leave me here on my own
Don't fly away

You're gone with the fire of my heart
I don't know how we fell apart
Crazy how this feeling come and go
This time I know where I will start

Help me to find my way home
So far away...

Say you've got a little job
You should try it on, a lot
When you're walking in the street
Watch out, you can fall and creep

Here comes their race
Keep off their face
Wounds never heal
This is all their will

I'll be going when you go
I'll be fighting when you fall
I'll be rocking when you roll

All is plotting how you fail
They could write a fairy tale
All is trying for their nice
They could tell a million lies

Here comes

Help me to find my way home
So far away...
