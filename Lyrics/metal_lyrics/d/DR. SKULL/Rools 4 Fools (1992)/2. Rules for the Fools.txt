When you're tied to the ground
Try to flap your wings
Try to crash the walls
Erected by the kings
Wherever you go, wherever you run and hide

You've been to so many mountains
And so many seas
Tried to break the chains
That carry you the disease
Roppin' the neck
Crashin' the head, no use

There are too many rules for the fools
Too many rules for the fools
"Las reglas para idiotas"

Break the rules and fly
And fly, fly, fly, fly
Fly high, fly high
Fly
