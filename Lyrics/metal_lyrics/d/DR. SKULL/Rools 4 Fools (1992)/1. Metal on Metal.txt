I'm deep in the dark, I hate to see the light
Constipates the morning, comforts me the night
I walk in the shadows, run from the sun
I fly to the moon, dive underground

I hate disco dance, I hate more than life
I only believe in metal, just like a fuckin' knife
"New shits" are "on the block", they're farting in my ear
I'm rocking 'til I'm mad, my violence is sheer

Metal on metal, metal on metal,
Metal on metal

My girl in the black, what a fire in her eyes
Every night she's born, every morning she dies
She's warm, oh she's hot, wild as a shark
A witch for a stranger, queen of the dark

She hates disco dance, hates all the lies
She only believes in me, the power in my eyes
Rules are suckin' dick, they make no sense to me
Fashion's what they pray, the gutter's where they'll be

Metal on metal

"Once we'd got long hair, no one could tell us what to do, we didn't hear, we didn't care.
We'd got freedom, we'd got to use it fast and the best 'cause we didn't want to lose it.
Nothing was trouble 'cause we were the trouble, when we were drinking the trouble was doubled.
Fighting for respect in a god damned battle.
This was the story of metal on metal."

Metal on metal
