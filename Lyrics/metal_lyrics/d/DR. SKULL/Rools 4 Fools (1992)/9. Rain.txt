Walking in the rain
Never be the same
Wetness on my face
Rolling in disgrace

Feeling blind and deaf
Talking to myself
Rotten in my soul
How many times I fall

Everything is over
All desire is over
Sky will wash me over in the rain, rain

Rain, rain, rain, crying in the rain
Rain, rain, rain, dying in the rain, in the rain

Muddy water splash
On my fire's ash
Cigarette's gone wet
Nothing good ahead
Confused in my mind
Leaving you behind
Never meet again
Never end this pain

Everything is over
All desire is over
Sky will wash me over in the rain, in the rain

Rain, rain

I wish I'd die under this rain
I will be clean, I will be sane
Nothing I've got, nothing to lose
Free and lost in this falling rain

Rain, rain
