Samantha, you make me feel alright
Samantha, won't you feel my thrust
Your breasts and your legs
And your lips and your touching's hot
When I see you on the TV, you make me shake a lot

Touch me now, with your red hot lips
Blow me up, when l lick your tits
I shake and I tremble with you
And I feel explode
When you break through the night
Pour that heavy load

Samantha, Samantha
You make me sick, you make me cry
Samantha, Samantha
Come and reach my hands and make me high
Samantha, Samantha
Come and reach my hands and make me high

Ooh, Samantha, you make me feel alright, yeah, oh yeah
Ooh, baby, baby you make me feel good
When l hold you in my arms girl

Samantha
