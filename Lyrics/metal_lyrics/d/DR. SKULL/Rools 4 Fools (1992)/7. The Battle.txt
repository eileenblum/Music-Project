No reason I should stay
Just a prison everyday
No way out, no escape
Flying is the only way

No one to trust, no one to call
No place to hide, nowhere to go

I feel the fire burning hell
I hear the thunder of the war

I only need to be free
Trying to get to me, myself
I only need to be free
Leave my place, leave my time, leave my body

I'm a river lost in the sea
Senses seem to torture me
The battle of the misplaced souls
Going on eternally

No one to trust, no one to call
No place to hide, nowhere to go

I feel the fire burning hell
I hear the thunder of the war

I only need to be
