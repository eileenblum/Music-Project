Flesh drips from machines, liquefied thoughts
Distilled humans, reproduced genes
Sift away all debris of negative traits
Creating a walking perfection
Breed a new kind of race, one with no thought
Where each member thinks the same way
Now resulting in death, death of a world
Where each member thought for himself

Beneath these floors where science dwells
Colossal structures making copies of life
Dreams of equal intelligence
Reality shows... chaotic world

Test the limits of humanity
Grotesque creations living all the same way
Producing life that has no will
No will for difference or medium change

Predicted future
No such thing as heredity
Cloning life
In unison we all shall stand...

Calculations of DNA
Set forth to kill the future
Proceed with destruction
Of our individuality

Twisted forms
Twisted forms, form the same opinion

We render the impossible
When we clone another human
Being, for our own
Genetic infiltration
Visions of chaos
Run rampant on this world
To see another person
unalike in your same way now
