The end has come, alertness now is shown
for years we've tried
But each one points in new directions
Faith or fear
In trusting all the wisest leaders
Now we mourn
A funeral for a friend

Foreseen, foretold, forewarned
Memories of extinction
Incarnations of new worlds
As though their time
Was never thought of

Liquid remains, liquid remains

A spawn of generations
Cast into and endless plain
receiving what's due
Carelessness brings careless torture
Now unalive
A frozen world of hate
Results in essence
An overpopulated grave

Foreseen, foretold, forewarned
Memories of extinction
incarnation of new worlds
As though their time
Was never thought of
Liquid remains, liquid remains

Writings... we have ignored
Accusations... no one cared
Wisdom them... thoughtless minds
Echo... haunting words
