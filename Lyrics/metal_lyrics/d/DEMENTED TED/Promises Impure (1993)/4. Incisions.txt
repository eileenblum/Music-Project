Deteriorating sets
Into the minds of a mortal race
Devouring the souls
Affluent resurrection
Writhing loss
Embalmed into eternity
The dormant remnants seethe
Through hideous reconstructions

Masticate - evolution
Penetrated flesh - deep incisions

A visionary dream
Of sickness created
Freedom from the flesh
Resurgence from within us

Inflicting disarray
Creating multiple torures
Impurities arise
Our flesh now facing deep - incisions

The true art now revealed
Atrocities divine, dissected
Body lies composed, a fragile piece
Of life remaining for the
Consumate

A need to remove
All animated features
Meticulous accounts
Of severed celebration
Pieced together,
We welcome this creation's
Creator of the dead's
Diminished attribution

Deterioration sets
Into the minds of a mortal race
Devouring the souls
Affluent resurrection
Writhing loss
Embalmed into eternity
The dormant remnants seethe
Through hideous reconstruction
