There exists a darkened path
Where distortions reflect life
Ethereal mothers weep the death
Of their children... lamentations
On this sinsiter road
Resounds from the cobblestone 
From beyond the pits of your mind
And your very darkest inner sense

Pschologically
Can you please explain
What is it that you see in killing
Torturing your foes
For reasons unknown
But psychological

Kill... For vengeance
Kill... for consciously
Still... you're knowing
Your fate... belongs to me

(Free them from their noose)

You're the pawns in a field of darkness
Unseen to the human eye
You're the pawns in a field of darkness
Until the psycho's end

Death will greet you warm, with hands
You will see his face
Turning back to times of sorrow
Once you've crossed the line
"When I kill, I release the hate inside of me
I will kill a thousand more, it's my destiny..."
Down to your end

I will lead, you will follow
I will bleed, you will swallow
I am death, I will crush you
I am death, you are next

Forced upon your lonely night
Diseased agains your feeble flight
Visions shown about yourself
Reiterate the pain unknown

Psychologically
Can you please explain
What is is that you see in killing
Torturing your foes
For reasons unknown...
But psychological

Alone you see your fate...

There exists a darkned path
