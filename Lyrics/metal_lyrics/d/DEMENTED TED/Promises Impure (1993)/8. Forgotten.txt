Blackened, a sphere of decay
Remnants of life now degrade
Disease - prolonged by hope
Ruins, of a lost human race
Distinct features no disappear
Begin - disintergration

Pain of the unwanted kind
A world plunged deep into death
To never - return again
Suffer, through the final effects
Destruction is close to completion
The end - of salvation

Decrepit structures on the ground
Remaining, life's extinction
Stripped and torn, our souls are raped
Our world will be forgotten...

Cease life
And tear the remnants of what's left
into a shredded mound of hate
Hate, blood
Soaks through the lining of our minds
And penetrates the inner sense of man
Diseased, unbalanced time stands still
we lay to rest this piece of space

Our loss
Our pain
Our fears
Consecrate
The severance
Of this
World reduced to ashes
Blackened, a sphere of decay
remnants of life now degrade
Disease - prolonged by hope
Ruins of a lost human race
Distinct features no disappear
Being - disintergration

Pain, of the unwanted kind
A world plunged deep into death
To never - return again
Suffer, through the final effects
Destruction is close to completion
The end - of salvation
