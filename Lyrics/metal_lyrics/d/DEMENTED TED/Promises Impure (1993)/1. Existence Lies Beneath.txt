The soil, guardian of decay
Degenerates and exhumes
All existing life, final feautres
Rot away

A monolithic stone marks the
Fresh decomposition
As the body falls to pieces
Now consuming death the 
Earth is nourished

Blood reflects the death
Cascading falls, rejuvenate my soul
Awakened from the dead
Existence lies beneath

My soul now roams the plains
Seeking vital life

Skin erased, gutted whore
A love for inner warmth
A stench impure
Writhe in rot, beauty lost
The true sight now revealed,
A sickened mind

Only darkness
Lies beneath us
Only darkness
There is no shame
Longing for the dead
My soul now roams the plains
Seeking vital life
