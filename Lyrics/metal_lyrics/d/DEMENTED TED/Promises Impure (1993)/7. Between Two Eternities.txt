A world with no recourse
Left to rot and wither
Entombed inside a writhing frame
The core of life diminshed
Serenity among the dead
Evaporate existing life

Unseen behind the earth
Eternally suffered lands
With no remains
A vital link unknown
As we prepare
Approaching our frontier
The final days are ripped away
Banished

The tidal plain returns
Allowing us to evolve
The layers start to rise
The flesh removed in time
Our legacy passes on
In various fossilzed forms

Odyssey of a human's transformation
Plant the seed,  flourished spawn
Recreate, strands untied
Code complete

Now our paradise is finally reached
Erosion concealed by the ice
A glistening grave in space suspended
Pure, lifeless
Between two eternities
Our faith forever rests
