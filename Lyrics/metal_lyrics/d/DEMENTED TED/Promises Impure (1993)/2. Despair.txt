The beginning of the end
Lost forever - souls with no existence
Life remaining slips away
Peeled from its mortal shell
Left to roam in darkness
Touched by fear
Unholy grasp, severed minds erased

Forever - welcome the future
In misery's dawn we lie
In sorrow - seasons decay, reminders
Of presence exist
No more - reversal destroyed
Thrust into abscess we die
Eternal - a dream cast in fire
Collision apparent

Why deny, greet the end
Diminished dream
Failed world, failed God
Failed life
All we are turns to nothing
Withered loss
Why deny, greet the end
World despair

Dissolved sun sets behind
Our horizon
We must leave and remain
a memory
Horros incarn channels through
The bleak remains of a 
shattered world
Atmosphere collapses, non-existant pillars
Rot away - redismembered

The sky is drawn to earth
Crushing Eden's reign
Promise of the dead
To never rise again

Why deny, greet the end
Diminished dream
Failed world, failed God, failed life
All we are turns to nothing
Withered loss
Why deny, greet the end
World despair

The beginning of the end
Lost forever, souls with no existence
Life remaining slips away
Peeled from its mortal shell
Left to roam in darkness
Touched by fear
Unholy grasp, redismembered
