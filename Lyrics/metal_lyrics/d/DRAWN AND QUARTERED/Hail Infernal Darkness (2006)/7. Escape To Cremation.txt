Flight from persecution
Refuge sought from certain death
Preying on their desperation
False hope salesman
Arise at Rue le Sueur tonight
With payment in your hand
Inoculated against disease
You will find in foreign lands

Occupation
Liquidation

Escape
Escape to cremation
Escape
Escape to cremation

Into the death chamber
Injection takes effect
Through a hole I watch
Their cruel agonizing deaths
Victims are dismembered
And their wealth belongs to me
Corpses piling up
But the time pit s full already

Resistance
Liquidation

Vile black smoke belches thickly
From burning chimney
The rancid stench suffocating
Spreading through the air
In the basement furnace
Severed limbs ablaze
Mutilated bodies stacked
Like wood to feed the flames

Lucrative
Liquidation

Escape
Escape to cremation
Escape
Escape to cremation
