Cut down from the noose alive
Seated before a blazing fire
Pray the executioner s sharpened his blade
The length of your stomach feel his razor incise
Privy members severed from your body
Extract the bowels with tongs of iron
Roasting them over the flames
Fainting from the excruciating pain

Suffer for your crimes
Butchered before you die
Eviscerate
Decapitate
Mutilate
A traitor s fate

Prolonged agony finally ends
Mercy is cutting off the head
Beheaded corpse is carved apart
Into halves and into fourths
Butchered remains disposed at the crowd s pleasure
Reversing the carnage for public display
Terror to be stricken into treasonous hearts
Fresh par-boiled with pungent spice to keep the birds away

Suffer for your crimes
Butchered before you die
Eviscerate
Decapitate
Mutilate
A traitor s fate

Regions now lie quite depopulated
Nothing could be more like hell
Severed heads staked on the houses and sleepies
Human quarters hung like leaves from the trees
Cauldrons boiling dismembered carcasses
Over fires sparkling and cracking
Smoke fills the air as steam arises
A bubbling broth of limbs and blood

Eviscerate
Decapitate
Mutilate
A traitor s fate
