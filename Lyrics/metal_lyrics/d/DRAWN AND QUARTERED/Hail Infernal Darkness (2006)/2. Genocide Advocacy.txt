Wretched lives so fragile
Shorn sheep befoul the globe
Multiplying accelerations
Fraudulent existence, spoon fed lies

From all sides

In nature the weak and stupid are eaten
Enforcing natural selection
Cults of deception have coddled the fable
Eons of greed and corruption
Glorification of idiocy
Ignorance seems to surround
Elimination, purification
Usher them all underground

Burn all shreds of weakness
With death is purity
Mass of worthless left behind
Vast the reaper's prey

Exalted are the slayers
Lone wolves cull the herd
Shattering the useless
Glory in life's undoing

In nature the weak and stupid are eaten
Enforcing natural selection
Cults of deception have coddled the fable
Eons of greed and corruption
Glorification of idiocy
Ignorance seems to surround
Elimination, purification
Usher them all underground
