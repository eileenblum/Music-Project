Purveyors of insanity
The nails await your flesh
These planks are stained with ages
Thousands have gone before you
Outlawed and ostracized
Hunted down like dogs
Put to the strappado
And mercilessly flogged

Blood of a million martyrs
Shed eternally in vain
Millions more must follow
Holocaust of the insane

Glowing coals beneath the grill
Await your naked flesh
Bars of iron sear the skin
Slowly cooked to death
Others sliced across the scalp
To be skinned alive
Peeling slowly with the blade
Let s see how long you survive

Blood of a million martyrs
Shed eternally in vain
Millions more must follow
Holocaust of the insane

Flesh is weak, your faith is weaker
Nothing reaped but death and torture
Belief is nothing but a symptom
Of the madness that you suffer

Blood of a million martyrs
Shed eternally in vain
Millions more must follow
Holocaust of the insane

Purveyors of insanity
The nails await your flesh
These planks are stained with ages
Thousands have gone before you
Dismembered or burnt at the stake
Slowly crushed with stones
Exterminate the faithful
Seas of blood and shattered bones
