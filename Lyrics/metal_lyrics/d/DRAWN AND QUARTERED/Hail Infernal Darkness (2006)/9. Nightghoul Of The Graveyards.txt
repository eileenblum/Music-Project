Behind the house, the shed
Where headless she is found
Hanging from the ratters
Like a deer; disemboweled
Vagina carved out
For the collection
Her heart atop the stove
Head used as an ornament

On nocturnal raids
Opening the graves
Soon insufficient
Living specimens to be slain

Nightghoul of the graveyards
Fulfilling aberrant obsession
Twisted by devotion
Derangement festers in isolation
Sudden disappearance
Follow the trails of blood

Discarded organs boxed
Shoved aside and left to rot
Render the choicest pieces
Into macabre implements
A hollowed face and torso
A vest of human skin
With this upon me
I can touch my dreams

On nocturnal raids
Opening the graves
Soon insufficient
Living specimens to be slain
