Hail Infernal Darkness
Torment the children of the light
Banish the heresy of faith
At the stakes the flames arise

Hail infernal darkness
Gaze into the depths of the abyss
An empty vessel I have now become
Pour black hatred into me

A path alight for the masses
Will lead only to slaughter
Give praise to death
Hail infernal darkness
Lead the sheep into the fires
Smoke shall blot the sky
Give praise to death
Hail Infernal Darkness

Testament to human weakness
Cowards seek comfort in illusions
Wisdom lies occulted in shadow
All light is bound to expire

Call Me Adversary

Leveling the temples
Toppling the thrones
Light after Light
Flickers and dies

You can call me adversary

A path alight for the masses
Will lead only to slaughter
Give praise to death
Hail infernal darkness
Lead the sheep into the fires
Smoke shall blot the sky
Give praise to death
Hail Infernal Darkness

Give Praise to death
Hail Infernal Darkness
Give praise to hate
Hail Infernal Darkness
Give praise to evil
Hail Infernal Darkness
Give Praise to Hell
Hail Infernal Darkness
