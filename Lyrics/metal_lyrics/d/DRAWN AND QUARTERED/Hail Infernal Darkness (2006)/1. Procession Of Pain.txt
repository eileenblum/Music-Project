What feeble man is tortured by madness
Mocked and spat upon as trudging to a storied death
Alone to suffer, crushed by your burden
Symbol of failure, stained with your blood

Blows raining down upon your battered form
Flaying the skin and deep into the flesh
Pitiful wails and the sound of cracking bone

In a splash of blood, skin split wide open
With every cruel lash of the whip
How holy is this mutilated shape at my feet
Lying in the dirt like the worthless piece of shit you are

Procession of pain
The bleeding never ends

Like your savior of nothing, lust for perverse pain
Whipped and beaten without mercy
Covered in blood, beaten to a pulp
In the image of your imagined salvation

Procession of pain
The bleeding never ends
