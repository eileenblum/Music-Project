Seize the throne, unholy usurper
A sacred place of desolation
Cold as ice, the dead of night
Thy will must be done

Essence of holiness
Horribly Possessed

Trumpeting the birth of a new messiah
Newborn infant is baptized
Cast into the holy waters
Deliverance into the promised kingdom

Befouling the scriptures
Stench of desecration
Befouling the scriptures
The spirit lingers
