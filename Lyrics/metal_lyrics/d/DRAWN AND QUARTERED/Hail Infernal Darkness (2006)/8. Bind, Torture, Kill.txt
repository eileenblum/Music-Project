Family slaughtered
Strangled inside your home
No random intrusion
Cords wrap around your throats
The code for me will be BTK
Additional victims will be on the way
A demon compels me to kill once again
Driven to murder for public attention

Bind them
Torture them
Kill them

Stripped and bound
Strangled at your bed
Neck wrapped up tightly
In plastic I encase your head
The code for me will be BTK
My massacres will compare with the greats
Factor X possesses me, another has to die
Let it be a mystery
You guess who and you guess why

Bind them
Torture them
Kill them
