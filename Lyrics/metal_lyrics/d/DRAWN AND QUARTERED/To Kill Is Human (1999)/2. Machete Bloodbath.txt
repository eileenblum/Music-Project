Hordes gathering strength under cover of darkness
A village below lies asleep unsuspecting
Eyes blaze with hatred from generations forgotten
An ancient debt now paid in all of their lives
Extremities hacked with a razor-edged machete
Heavy blades bludgeoning skulls of the enemy
Brains spill and organs are loosed from their chests
Massacred families staining their beds

Violent amputation
Bloody gutted children
Fallen in a corner
Entrails spilled into their laps

Hacked to death
Machete bloodbath
Genocidal intent
Bodily dismemberment

Death hailing down with the strength of pure hatred
Decapitated heads kicked into pools of blood
The screams of the dying rupture the darkness
As they awake to being butchered alive
Not one shall escape the massacre
Pity and compassion gone
Infants impaled through the stomach
On knife blades stuck in the bloosoaked ground

Mangled corpses boil in their blood
To cinders their home burn

Hacked to death
Machete bloodbath
Genocidal intent
Bodily dismemberment
