Eviscerated and amputated
A lustful urge, I can't contain it
Rubbing your entrails over my genitals
I love you for what's on the inside

Carnal copulation

The fragrance of your freshly opened body excites
Me the glistening of your mangled viscera invites
Me overcome, I seize my tool, relinquish all control
Drill my own hole
