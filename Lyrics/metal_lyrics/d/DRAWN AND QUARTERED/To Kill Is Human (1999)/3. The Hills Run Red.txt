In reign in cruelty
Demented thirst for pain
Son of the devil
All shall fear my name
I am the impaler
Bestow upon thee
Excruciating agony

The hills run red with gruesome death
Inflicted pain on my command
Forests of impaled bodies
Uttering the land
Sharpened spike impales your anus
Piercing, ripping your insides
Savoring the sickening death
Torturously slow you will die

Massive executions
Thousands slow die
Relishing their agonies
As I feast nearby

Skewed alive, they twitch and writhe
Blood thirst never slaked
Victims of my sadism
Left rotting on the stake

In reign in cruelty
Demented thirst for pain
Son of the devil
All shall fear my name
I am the impaler
Bestow upon thee
Excruciating agony

The hills run red with gruesome death
Inflicted pain on my command
Forests of impaled bodies
Uttering the land
Sharpened spike impales your anus
Piercing, ripping your insides
Savoring the sickening death
Torturously slow you will die
