Fucked up life, too much to bear
No longer can endure
Violent end, abysmal pain
Suck the barrel
Instant's flash, bloody splash
Inflict the horror

Taste the metal
Now taste the lead
Others will suffer
Once you are dead

A public act of self-destruction
Camera's gaze unblinking
In a wink slump to the floor
Leave them screaming
Torrents of blood gushing down
A face in ruin

Open mind
Open mind

Shotgun blasts apart the skull
Features pulverized
In a spray across the floor
Gray matter liquified
Congealed permeates undistinguished
Prevent your dog's starvation

Open mind
Open mind
