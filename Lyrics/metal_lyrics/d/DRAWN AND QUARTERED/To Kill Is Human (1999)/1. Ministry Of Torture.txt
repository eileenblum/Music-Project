Subjected to inhuman degradation
A stinking hole is now your home
In the basement, stripped and shackled
Never shall you leave

Your purpose is to bread
Never shall you leave

Beaten daily, raped and tortured
Captive concubines of pain
Defiance dealt with most severely
Left with no choice but to kill

Ministry
Debauchery
Torture
Murder

Divine commandment, spawned madness
Prepare again to receive the staff
Imprisonment and incubation
Your purpose is to bleed

Human flesh as sustinence
Screwdriver stabbed in your ear
Hung in chains for days on end
Cut up remnants in the freezer
Her dismembered corpse will feed us well
