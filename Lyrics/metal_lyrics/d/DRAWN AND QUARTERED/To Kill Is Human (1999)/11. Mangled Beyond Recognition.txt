The skull is hammered into paste
My axe embedded in your face
Overcome with raging hate
Compulsion to obliterate

Mangled beyond recognition
Twisted wreckage of your corpse
Abdomen carved open
And internal organs hacked to pulp
Splintered bones protruding through
The tattered remnants of your skin
Mangled beyond recognition
Your existence at its end

A nameless corpse forever lie
In heaps of gore you die

Eternal anonymity
Erasing your identity

A nameless corpse forever lie
Never identified

Psychotic violence unrestrained
Fingers skinned, no prints remain
Dissected flesh, horrific state
Anonymous your gruesome fate

Mangled beyond recognition
Twisted wreckage of your corpse
Abdomen carved open
And internal organs hacked to pulp
Splintered bones protruding through
The tattered remnants of your skin
Mangled beyond recognition
Your existence at its end
