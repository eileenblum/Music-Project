Utter darkness broods behind
This mask of normalcy
A human face perpetuates
Monstrous acts of cruelty
A history etched in tortured flesh
The life of a sacred life
Murder flows within our blood
Only waiting to ignite

Unseen I walk among you

Predatory legacy
Unleashed on those I hate
Bloodletting unseen in scale
Inhumankind's deserved fate

Depopulate
I depopulate

To see the head explode
As the bullet hits the skull
To feel the guts spill down my wrist
A blade submerged within your chest
To kill is human
I'm only human
Too many people
Got to take them down

Deserved fate
I depopulate
