Churches crumbling to the ground
Devastation
Holy land awash in blood
Desecration
Praying Christians ripped in half
Evisceration
Butchered like your bastard son
Final cleansing has begun

Annihilate
The Christian faith

Millions murdered in its name
Religious cancer
This blessed night the tables turn
The ancient farce will fall

Annihilate
The christian faith

Allegiance sworn to no one
Those who follow are lost
Slaughtering indiscriminately
All who bear the cross
Screams of vengeful torture
Unheard by your imagined lord
Slowly hacked to pieces
Devoured by our voracious horde

[Repeat]

No heaven, no hell, no afterlife
As soon you will discover
Existing this only world
Brutally dismembered

Annihilate
The christian faith

Two thousand years retribution
One night death eternal
Resurrection never comes
Forever dead your idol
Slaughtering the holy

Blood of Christians soaks the earth
Religious genocide achieved
Extinction, no rebirth
