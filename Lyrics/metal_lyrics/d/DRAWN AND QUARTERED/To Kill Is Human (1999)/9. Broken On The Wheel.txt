Barbaric execution
Prolonged and painful death
Spread-eagle the victim tied
The iron bar comes down

Limbs and joints viciously smashed by methodical
Blows feel the waves of sickening pain with
Each crack of bone

Massive lacerations
Shattered limb by limb
Pleading for your end
Entering in dying agony

Broken on the wheel
Death sentence rendered by savage mutilation

Bones reduced to slivers
Spattered with your blood
One final crushing strike
Descends upon the throat

Battered wreck of flesh is hauled away
Dangling lifeless, thrown upon the flames

Mangled and maimed
In blood the guilty pay

Broken on the wheel
Death sentence rendered by savage mutilation
