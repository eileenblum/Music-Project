Cold comfort in madness
For fools and hypocrites
A noose strangling reason
Common sense left for dead

Seed od Insanity
Sowling stupidity

Make them hate, make them kill
Twist their minds, take their lives

Seed of insanity
Growling stupidity

Procreationg burden
Broken minds, empty eyes
Swarming like rats over garbage
Infecting the world with your plague

Afraid of the dark, lost in the ight
Night is now day, wrong is now right
Swallow the poison, swallow the lie
Longing for afterlife, longing to die

Do not question outlandish contradictions
Do not question the holy exhortations

Grasp for salvation
Grasping for hope
Grasping for meaning
Where there is none

Evil in every shadow
Evil must be destroyed...

Seed of insanity
Lost hold of reality
Seed of insanity
Welcome atrocity
