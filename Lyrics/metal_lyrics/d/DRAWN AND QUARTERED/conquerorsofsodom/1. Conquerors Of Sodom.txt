Beyond the gates where no sun rises
Unholy hordes of Sodom
Strenght and hate raping faith
Slow impaling awaits
Underneath the Sign of Evil, perversions of the flesh
The Sin of Sodom vanquishing the pure
Fornication, desecration, blasphemous insemination
Virgins writhe impaled upon arisen horns

Into the abyss!

Rampage through halls of paradise
Conquerors of Sodom
Flood the earth with evil seed
Conquerors of Sodom

Invading force from below
Assaulting sacred flesh
Brandishing scepters of blood
Baptizing all in Satanic Lust
Conquered depths surrendered to the master's might
Demonic possession, unholy ecstasy
Forbidden passages defiled, gates thrown open wide
Inner sanctum anointed in blasphemy
