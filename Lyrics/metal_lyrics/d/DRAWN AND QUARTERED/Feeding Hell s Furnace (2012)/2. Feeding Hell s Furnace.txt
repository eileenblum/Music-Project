From the crematorium
Flames shoot towards the sky
Leaden smoke clouds billow forth
Choking breath as day is made night

when the world blows this way
I smell the stench, the burning flesh

Deep inside
Feeding Hell's furnace

A thousand voices scream in torment
From the pit, they burn alive

Dead inside
Feeding Hell's furnace

FEEDING HELL'S FURNACE

Toiling at the burning gates
Humanity's cremation
Feed the fires' unending hunger
Infernal incineration

Skeletal, emaciated
Another log into the fire

Dead inside
Feeding Hell's furnace
Faces I know
Feeding Hell's furnace
