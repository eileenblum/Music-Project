Across depopulated lands
When the bells chime midnight
The hungry earth devours it's children
Ritual procession
Grim dance of death

As we are, so you shall be
Old and young, wealth or none
Not your strength, nor your faith
Will provide you any escape

Rising from our graves
Rid of our skin and flesh
Tempters of the living
Join us as we dance

As we are, so you shall be
Old and young, wealth or none
Not your strength, nor your faith
Will provide you any escape

Forever join us
In our cold embrace
