Unearthed from a shallow grave
Badly decomposed remains
Riddled with stabwounds, how many none can say
Eyes gouged from sockets, 22 to just the face

Intoxication
Retaliation
Hallucinations
Say you love Satan
Rising of terror
Ritual murder
Grim mutilations
Say you love Satan

Unleashed madness and rage
With the frenzy of a demon,
slashing as you scream for mercy
Mutilated body left blanketed with leaves
In the woods, a screeching crow is
the sign the Master is pleased

Intoxication
Retaliation
Hallucinations
Say you love Satan
Rising of terror
Ritual murder
Grim mutilations 
Say you love Satan

Say you love Satan
Say you love Satan

Say you love Satan
Say you love Satan
Say you love Satan!
SAY YOU LOVE SATAN
