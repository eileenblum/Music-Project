When every temple burns
Where every priest is hanged
Smoldering remains of humans
Greet the eclipse with no end

Evolved, superior beings arise
Below, ignorance multiplies

Where only fires light the darkness
When only death is praised

Evolved, superior being arise
Beneath, inferiority multiplies

Once-hallowed idols crushed into dust
Prophets boil in angel's blood
Fall of procreation, sodomy is law
Purity is smashed beneath the tyrant's fist

When holy texts are ashes where holy soil is drowned in blood
when every word of worship
Is torn from every tongue...

Doom unfolds for maggots
unleash the persecution
A world lies in ashes
Age of Hell arisen
