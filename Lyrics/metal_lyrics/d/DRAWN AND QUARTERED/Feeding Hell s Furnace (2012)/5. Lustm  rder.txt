The sight of crimson spurting out
Brings great pleasure to me
I strangled her and slit her throat
Climax as I watch her bleed

Twisted beyond recognition
Raping the bloody corpse

A swing of the hammer
Striking with sadistic glee
Fractured skull, a pool of red
Plasmatic ecstasy

Perverted bloodlust insatiable drinking my victims' blood

I dream of deaths of thousands
Poisoning thier water
Arsenic-laced treats to feed the children
Brutality of many men
I kill and rape and kill again
Seven stab wounds for each year
Of your cruelly short life

The sounds of blood trickling
Was music to my ears
Will I hear my own blood
gushing forth from my neck stump
