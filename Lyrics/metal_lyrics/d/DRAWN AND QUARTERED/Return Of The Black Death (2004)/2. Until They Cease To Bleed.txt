When you hear the footsteps behind you
Veins are chilled to ice
A shape in the shadows, barely discerned
Except for the gleam of my knife
Flight impulses have come too late
For now I am upon you
Your screams of terror will bring no aid
As you feel the steel inside you

I must kill you
I must kill

Skin is shredded into ribbons
Streams flow from your form
Cries and struggles now subsiding
Fading with each stab wound
As your pulse grows ever-fainter
My pulse starts to rise
Blood-covered body is cooling and motionless
That's when I rape repeatedly

I must kill you
I must kill

Unmercifully hack and slash
Until they cease to bleed

With the bloody axe I dismember
Limbs hacked off one by one
Torso chopped into several pieces
Entrails smashed into a pulp
Your blood is splattered all over me
And pooling at your sides
As a trophy I remove the head
The terror frozen in your eyes forever

Unmercifully hack and slash
Until they cease to bleed
