There is no happiness without tears
No life without death
Beware I am going to make you cry
Final hours of terror
Relentless violation
Rape is only foreplay
For sadistic mutilation

Across the land - Works by my hand

I rape and kill and mutilate
Young blond women absorb my hate
Artisan of mutilation
Applied by knifepoint, canvas crimson

Ravaged and butchered
So pretty, so young
This is my retribution
Tell the world what I have done
I picked a juicy flower
And I shall do it again
For there is no holiday without a funeral

Another funeral for another holiday

I rape and kill and disembowel
Intestines pulled out as they howl
Artisan of mutilation
Applied by knifepoint, canvas crimson

I have done it again

Across the land - Works by my hand

I rape and kill and mutilate
Young blond women absorb my hate
Artisan of mutilation
Applied by knifepoint, canvas crimson

Another funeral

I rape and kill and mutilate
Young blond women absorb my hate
Artisan of mutilation
Applied by knifepoint, canvas crimson

Only tears of sorrow
Can wash out the stain of shame
Only pangs of suffering
Can blot out the fires of lust
Stab wound mutilation
A spike run through the cunt
Beautiful corpses
Left behind in piles of guts

I have done it again
