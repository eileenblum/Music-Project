Most times I didn't know their names
And I can't remember where I left them all
Most of them knew what they call me
In the river their stripped corpses will be found

Taking out the garbage
Doing you all a favor
No sentiment or emotion
Predatory strangulation

Those whores are scared of me
This street has never looked so empty

A cluster by the river
So that I can find them later
To conceal the bodies
To probe again the cold dead holes

Consumed with rage, my only release
Prostitutes I pick up off the street
Women are whores and whores I despise
I like how the young ones plead for their lives

In my home, in my bed
Life wrung from their slender necks
I killed them quick, they won't be missed
A boot to the throat to make certain of death

Taking out the garbage
Doing you all a favor
No sentiment or emotion
Predatory strangulation

Pride in my superior accomplishment
Killed so many I can't keep them straight
It wasn't hard to throw you off the scent
A generation taken to their graves
Nearly everyone that got in
Never was seen alive again
My hands wrapped around her neck
Squeezing out her final breath

A cluster by the river
So that I can find them later
To conceal the bodies
To probe again the cold dead holes
