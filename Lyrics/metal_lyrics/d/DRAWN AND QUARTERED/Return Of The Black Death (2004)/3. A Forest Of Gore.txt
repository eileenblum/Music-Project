Descent into the river valley
Enemies a threefold army
Heroic victories forged in blood
Invader horde must be expunged
Led by a warrior of ravenous bloodthirst
He watches as the stakes impale the bodies
Of unfortunates who incur his ire
Through the anus or women's vaginas
Tearing carefully through the membranes
To rupture vital organs would hasten their demise

Deathmarch and slavery for the aristocracy
Surviving few were planted outside the castle walls

Dragon's son - Kaziglu Bey
The Impaler - Fear his names
Infidel and nobility
Hung up to die in agony

Prisoners of war, mass execution
Hoisted up one after another
Hung on spikes impaling their bodies
A message that shall not be ignored
Sadistic and merciless tactics
He watches as the stakes impale his victims
He hungers for their suffering
Septicemic sodomy, a forest of gore
Death will not come for them for hours or days
To be left until the crows pick their bones clean

Dragon's son - Kaziglu Bey
The Impaler - Fear his names
Infidel and nobility
Hung up to die in agony

Blackened earth left behind - Poisoned water supply
Exhausted they come to rest - Outside Tirgoviste
Turkish dogs forced to retreat
Horror stricken by what they had seen
Tens of thousands of their brothers
Dying here in excruciating agony

Dragon's son - Kaziglu Bey
The Impaler - Fear his names
Infidel and nobility
Hung up to die in agony
