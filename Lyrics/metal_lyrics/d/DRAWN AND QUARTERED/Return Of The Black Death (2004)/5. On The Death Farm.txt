Trussed up for butchering
Inside a bloodstained shack
Wide-eyed in horror
Strung on a meathook
Seized roughly by the hair
Blade is drawn across your throat
Blood splashes into a tub
As your life grows remote

Dismember - Decapitate
Carcass processed into meat
Sawn apart - Body parts
For farm animals to eat
Bloody chunks of their flesh
Devoured by the pigs
The chipper turns bones to fragments
Extra meat will freeze

One by one vanishing
From the strip downtown
Easy prey for a wily hunter
They never will be found
No bodies ever found intact
So easily ignored
No one gives a damn
About some disappearing whores

Dismember - Decapitate
Carcass processed into meat
Sawn apart - Body parts
For farm animals to eat
Bloody chunks of their flesh
Devoured by the pigs
The chipper turns bones to fragments
Extra meat will freeze

Night of slaughter on the death farm
The feast is prepared on the death farm
Inedibles hauled off to the rendering plant
Animal with human remnants
Into the food chain sent
On the way back another picked up
For a one-way ride
Fattening up the hogs
To feed the guests tomorrow night

Dismember - Decapitate
Carcass processed into meat
Sawn apart - Body parts
For farm animals to eat
Bloody chunks of their flesh
Devoured by the pigs
The chipper turns bones to fragments
Extra meat will freeze

Day of slaughter on the death farm
A feast for all on the death farm
