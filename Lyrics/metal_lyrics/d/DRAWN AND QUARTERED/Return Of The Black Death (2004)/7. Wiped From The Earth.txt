I see their faces
And they all look the same
More like cattle
Awaiting the bolt of the brain

Loathsome insects on a ball of dirt
I am the pesticide
As vermin, an infestation
I, exterminator

My hands bloodied again and again

Only fit for obliteration
Welcome cataclysm
An end to the madness
Wipe them from the earth

I hear their voices
So much of nothing spoken
Precipitating murder
Floodgates of violence opened

Only fit for obliteration
Welcome cataclysm
An end to the madness
Wipe them from the earth
