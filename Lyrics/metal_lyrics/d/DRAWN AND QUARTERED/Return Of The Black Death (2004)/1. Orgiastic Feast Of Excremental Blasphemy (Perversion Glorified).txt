Mockery of the holy
Blasphemous ceremony

Unsanctimonious
Inversion of ritual

Let the feast commence
Let the filth from dung-carts fly
Sausages upon the altar
Perversion glorified
Let the feast commence
Garments shed amongst the aisles
Carnal lusts of every sort
Perversion glorified

Offering, vile and stinking

Desecrate
Defecate

Obscenity to the faithful
As their shrine of gold is defiled
Origastic feast of excremental blasphemy
We befoul the temples
That you built to a face in the clouds
Pray tell who really are the foolish ones now?

Let the feast commence
Let the filth from dung-carts fly
Sausages upon the altar
Perversion glorified
Let the feast commence
Garments shed amongst the aisles
Carnal lusts of every sort
Perversion glorified
