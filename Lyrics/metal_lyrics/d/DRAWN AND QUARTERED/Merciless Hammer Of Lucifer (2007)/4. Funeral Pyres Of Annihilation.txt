Wiping out the conquered survivors
Without feeling or empathy for their suffering
Atrocious bloodthirsty massacre
Corpses of millions decompose in our wake

Heaps of bodies stacked upon the woodpiles
Hill of rotting flesh for cremation
Melting mountains of dripping fire
Furious storm of conflagration

Funeral pyres of annihilation
Obliterate all traces of their being
Funeral pyres of annihilation
Flesh charred to ashes, scatter to the winds

Architects of genocide observe
From the flickering shadows

Incinerate ï¿½ engulfed in hellfire
Annihilate ï¿½ the human plague
Incinerate ï¿½ reek of corpses burning
Exterminate ï¿½ let no one remember

Funeral pyres of annihilation
Obliterate all traces of their being
Funeral pyres of annihilation
Watch the last ashes scatter to the winds
