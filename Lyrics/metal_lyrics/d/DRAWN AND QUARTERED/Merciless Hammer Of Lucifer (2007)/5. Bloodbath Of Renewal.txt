Grim-faced warriors, victorious march
Evicting wartorn streets slick with blood
Exhaustion and illness, like dead leaves they fall
Opposition brings death in an instant

Purify society, bloodbath of renewal
Deathmarch evacuation to the camps and killing fields
Radical depopulation, bloodbath of renewal
Labor camps, starvation and disease is all your future holds

Ritual cannibal butchery
Consume the roasted liver of the fallen enemy
Slain foes decapitated
Boiling their severed heads

To spare you is no profit
To destroy you is no loss

Eliminating those unlike us
Xenocide, destroy ideas from outside
Exterminating fools of faith
Destroying all vestiges of the past

Purify society, bloodbath of renewal
Deathmarch evacuation to the camps and killing fields
Radical depopulation, bloodbath of renewal
Labor camps, starvation and disease is all your future holds

What is rotten must be removed
Document millions put to death
Slaughtered for skill or education
Paranoid suspicion, assassination
