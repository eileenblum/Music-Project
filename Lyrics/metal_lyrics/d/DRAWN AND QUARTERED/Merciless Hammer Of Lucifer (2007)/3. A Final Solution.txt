Orders of extermination
A final solution to the question
Hundreds of miles overland
Months-long march to death

Abolish, annihilate
Massacre, depopulate

Orders to begin the operation
Systematic deportation
Pursuing the goal of annihilation
Easily concealed in a time of war

Laying down the tracks
To their own eradication
At the end of the line
Certain death destination
Driven from their native soil
Packed like cattle into the rail cars
To the end of the line
Left to die from thirst and hunger

Abolish, annihilate
Massacre, depopulate

Advancements in technology
Genocidal utility

Empty the prisons, to prey on the condemned
Torture, rape and murder reign across the land

Stripped of possessions, stripped of their lives
A nation and population sentenced to die

Laying down the tracks
To their own eradication
At the end of the line
Certain death destination
Driven from their native soil
Packed like cattle into the rail cars
To the end of the line
Left to die from thirst and hunger
