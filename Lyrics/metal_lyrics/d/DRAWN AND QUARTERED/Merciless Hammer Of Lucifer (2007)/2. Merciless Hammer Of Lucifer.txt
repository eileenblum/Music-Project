Slaughtering the servants, enslaved to stillborn saviors
Butchery floods every land, declaration of unholy war
Feeble stars and crosses fallen in fire
Iron fists of Antichrist aborting all messiahs

Dawn of a new age of reason, of Satan

Infernos dot the horizon, Hellï¿½s opened its gates
Temples of slavery illuminate the night in flames
Beheading the baptized with swords of hellforged fury
Assassins of every prophet, obliterate idolatry

Blood tides from black skies
Merciless hammer of Lucifer
Crucified faithful die
Merciless hammer of Lucifer

Regiments of unholy genocide
Demonic troops of destruction
Trample blood-drenched ground of consecration
Towards the extinction of religion

All deemed holy is defiled
Vomit, semen, urine, excrement
Angels of purity sodomized and raped
Demon seed, pearly gates

Blood tides from black skies
Merciless hammer of Lucifer
Crucified faithful die
Merciless hammer of Lucifer

Heavens dark and silent
Crimson storm clouds rape the sky
The broken weep in agony
As their illusion dies

Merciless hammer of Lucifer
Merciless hammer of Lucifer
