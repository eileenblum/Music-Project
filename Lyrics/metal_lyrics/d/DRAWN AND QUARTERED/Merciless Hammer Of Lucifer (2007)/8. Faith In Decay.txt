Questions without answers
Torment inferior minds
Flocking to such lunacy
Invisible divinity

Knowledge liberates from the cowardice of faith

Follow me my children
Heed the piperï¿½s call
Manipulating the mindless
Perpetuating fear and ignorance

I see the madness and hatred
The scorn in their deceiving eyes
I see the control and greed
Empires built on mountains of lies

Rottingï¿½

Defamation of fact and wisdom
Arcane bastion of irrationality
Walls of falsehoods crumbling
Plummeting leap into insanity
Crusades of extermination
Call the righteous to their graves
Tarnished lies still ensnare the blind
To be led is to be led astray

Rotten from inception
Who would want your heaven?
Stench of putrefaction
From the bloated corpse of faith in decay

I see the madness and hatred
The scorn in their deceiving eyes
I see the control and greed
Empires built on mountains of lies

Rottingï¿½ decay
