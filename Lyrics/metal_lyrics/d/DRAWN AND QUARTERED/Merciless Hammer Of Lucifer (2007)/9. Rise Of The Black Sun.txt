Amputation, for blood loss examination
Captives subjected to experiments and operations
Severed limbs sewn back onto opposite sides
Ghoulish reconstruction, how long until they die?

Morbid surgical procedures, stomachï¿½s excision
Esophagus reattached to intestines
Cutting out pieces of the lungs or the brain
Tortured to death for scienceï¿½s gain

Rise of the black sun
Night falls on the subjugated
Rise of the black sun
Dawn of thousands of dead

Test the limits of human flesh
Free from anesthetic effects
Extremes of pressure, heat and cold
Sawing off of limbs once frozen

Breed the plague

Black sun 731

Disease-farming tyrants sowing mass death of innocent
Aerial infestation, plague drops from the skies
Engineers of epidemic, unleash upon the population
Bacterial factories spawn weapons of pathogen

Rise of the black sun
Night falls on the subjugated
Rise of the black sun
Dawn of thousands of dead
Rise of the black sun
A new dawn of plague and death
Rise of the black sun
