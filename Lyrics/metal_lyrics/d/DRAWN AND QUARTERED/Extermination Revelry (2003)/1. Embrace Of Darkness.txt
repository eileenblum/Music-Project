Delirium of lunatics and liars
Subjugated thought and will
Ages of death saturate their lands
For only one of their ways can be true

Foolish idols will mean nothing
When your planet is turned to ash
Every name once spoken in reverence
Devoured in global holocaust

Decay and nothingness
The only future that awaits
Withdrawal from Reality
Can't disguise your fear and hate

Following the path of deception
Embrace of darkness

Darkness eternal

Your paradise beyond
Is just an old hallucination
Misery and ignorance
Won't lead to your redemption

The light is an Illusion
Embrace of darkness

As the bodies pile higher
For your ever-silent deity
Righteousness extinguished
Darkness reigns eternally
