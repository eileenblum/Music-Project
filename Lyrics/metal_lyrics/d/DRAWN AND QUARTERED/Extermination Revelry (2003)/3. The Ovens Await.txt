Furnaces for mass cremation
Enforcers of depopulation
Vilified, dehumanized
The weak and worthless sent to die
Easily manipulated
Herds and herds asphyxiated
Realization dawns at last
As their lungs are filled with gas

Industrial machinery
To maximise efficiency
Mass production genocide
Combustible subhumanity
Rendered into smoke and ash
Eternal stench of burning flesh
Smokestacks caked with carbonized fat
Renewing visions from the past

End of the line - The ovens await
Into the showers - The ovens await

Cleanse the plant, clear the land
A scope that none can comprehend
Forcibly torn from your family
They are already up the chimney
Some are saved from termination
Tortures of experimentation
Labor forced until they drop
Corpses walk but not for long

For young and old - The ovens await
To the left and to the right - The ovens await
