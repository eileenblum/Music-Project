Captive of sadistic hate - Suspended by the wrists
Powertool torture - Inflicted on your frail flesh
Tools of agony before you - Color drains from your face
To make you fucking suffer
Screaming as the carnage sprays

Blood shoots through the air - Grind down to the bone
Enduring levels of agony - Heretofore unknown

Violence and utter hatred - Only shreds of flesh remain
Bloodiest execution - Under the chainsaw

When the blood flows too freely
Blowtorch used to cauterize
So much more pain left to bestow
Before I let you die

Appalling mutilations - Chainsaw butchery
Pools of gore collecting - Mangled painfully

Drills descending toward you - Skin has no resistance
Holes punctured through your flesh
At the end of your existence

Mutilated heap of flesh
Sawn to pieces in a shower of gore
