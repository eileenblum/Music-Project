In this hole lives the wicked king
In darkness I emerge from filth and isolation
In my wake, paranoia epidemic
Blood sprays as your brain is ventilated

Kill for my master - Random assassin
I am a monster - Kill for my Master

I turn children into killers
Turned into a killer, I am the son
Blasted with my .44 if you catch my fancy
Smitten by a bloody hail of lead

Voices commanding - Kill for my master
Psychic Transmission - From ancient demons

Do you know my master?

In this hole lives the wicked king
This night I emerge, machine gun at the ready
To prey upon the panic-stricken herd
You will spend all summer counting the bodies

Kill for my master
Kill
