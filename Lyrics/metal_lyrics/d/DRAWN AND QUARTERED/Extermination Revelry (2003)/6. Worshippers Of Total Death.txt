Death almighty, consume all life
Darkness will always conquer the light
Abolition of the lies - Beyond the unholy grave

Absolute supremacy - Worshippers of total death
Wreckers of Destruction - Worshippers of total death

Abject misery and pain for humanity
Suffering prolonged for eternity
Extermination revelry - War and sodomy forever

Genocide completion - Perish here forevermore
Spectacle of mass demise - Only death is real

Massacure, torture, catastrophe
Death's omnipotent certainty
Suns and men and gods succumb
Submerge the earth in corpses and blood
