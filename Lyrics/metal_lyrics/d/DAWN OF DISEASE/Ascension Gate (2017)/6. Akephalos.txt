Akephalos rise!

Revenant
Phantom of ambivalence
We summon thee

Our blood
Thy spirit
Incarnation of phantasma

Invisibility
Intangability
Now comes into flesh

Demon
Lord of doom
We yearn for thee

Our blood
Thy spirit
Incantation of miasma

Akephalos
Risen from beyond
Emerging in the midst of us

Materialized vision from beyond
We invite thee to our feast

Thy might
Thy strength
Shall enter into us

God
Divinity of unholiness
We starve for thee

Our blood
Thy spirit
Inflammation of phantasma

Akephalos
Risen from the depth
Bring thy sprit into our blood

Revenant
Demon
God
Thy might shall enter into us
