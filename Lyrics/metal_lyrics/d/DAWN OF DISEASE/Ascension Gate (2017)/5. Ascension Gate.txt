Far and surreal
Appears the most proximate
Close and clear
Seems the most distant
A distance insuperable

Striving for solitude
In alliance with the inevitable

High and supernatural
Appears the most common
Familiar and human
Seems the most phantasmagorial
A phantasm incomprehensible

Striving for solitude
In alliance with those
Who keep hold
Of the inevitable

Enter the ascension gate
The pathway to eternity
Traverse the ascension gate
To find tranquility and release

The definite instant
Marks the disclosure
Of a vastness
Transcending all that is left behind

The definite instant
Transcends all that is left behind
