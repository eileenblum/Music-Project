Surrounded by those who you once trusted in
all of them were willing to give their blood for you
lying on the cold ground sedated for the surgery
for the removal of the entrails

Enwrapped in gust
you are suffocating

Consciousness is blurring as the blade divides your flesh
nausea overwhelms as you gaze upon the gaping wound

Slowly and dolorous the bowels are torn out
their warmth is scattered on your entire body
to drown

Suffocation

Lashing out at you
the mass is avenging
frantic carnage â ceaseless bludgeoning

The gust entwined around
your face, your throat, your chest
pulmonic moratorium â laid to rest

Gasping in aspiration

Desperation in suffocation

Enwrapped in gust

Surrounded by those who you once trusted in
all of them are now willing to witness
how you are miserably perishing
