Time is only what we invented
to count the years and days
until we vanish into haze
words are only what we created
to paraphrase the indescribable in vain

In vain we spend our lives for a moment of eternity
aligning with the end for the truth to bear

Reality is what we seem to comprehend
determined by ourselves, needless to understand
supremacy is what we always pretend
although we are incapable to disengage the end

When our thoughts have passed the gateway
to the unknown forlorn world
we will crawl through nameless ages
united without time

Time is only words, we are only haze
paraphrasing years and days, vanishing in vain
reality to understand, determined by supremacy
incapable to comprehend we disengage ourselves

In vain we spend our lives for the truth to bear

When our thoughts have passed the gateway by the ever flowing stream
we will crawl through nameless ages, united in our dream

Conjuring hypocrisy, purporting we are free
trapped in the narrowness of our minds
time, words, fictive reality
through nameless ages we will crawl
our thoughts have passed the gateway to the forlorn world
united without dreams
