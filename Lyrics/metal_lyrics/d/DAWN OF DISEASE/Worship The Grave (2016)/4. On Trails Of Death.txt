Maiming, desecrating
possession and lunacy
forwards, marching
the trails of no return

Endless procession of faceless corpses
further through the swamps and forests
sleepless journey â carnivorous obsession
for more to join the exhausted forces
abysmal legion without a leader
heading towards extinction

On trails of death

Paths paved with crushed skulls
and lined with broken bones
devastation â relentlessness
marching on the trails of no return
expiration â peremptoriness
gnawed off cadavers â let them burn

Scrunching the defleshed bodies
blood dust fills the air
necrotic dissolution of flesh
feasting in ecstasy

Marching on the trails of no return

The suffering rises to inhuman dimensions
ripping the skin â sucking the marrow
every step onwards heightens the delight
in this inexorable butchery
hear the pounding coming closer
the stench of decay asphyxiates
