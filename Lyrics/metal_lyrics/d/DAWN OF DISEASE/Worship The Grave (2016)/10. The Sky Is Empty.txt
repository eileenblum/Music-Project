Seeking for the deities, praying for release
echoes without reply, screaming into the sky

The gods descended
from where they were thought to reside
to a subterranean void, to the other side
no augury, no disorder accompanied their disappearance
no horror, no misery resulted from the silent farewell

The sky is empty, the life is dead
all hopes and sorrows are forgotten in the end
the sky is empty, the day is black
all gods are gone and they are never coming back

Only those who retained allegiance
were requested to fulfill
the promises given in their prayers

Bound to the inner belief
of an unlasting physical existence

All devotions remain unheard
the realm of gods remain desert
rituals die away in the absence of all divinity

There never has been a time
when the sky was as clear as now
when emptiness brought wealth
and darkness caused illumination
the spiritual cage of divine suppression
has finally been opened
through the will of ourselves

The sky is empty
