I am the eye uncovering your world
I am the essence â the entity of all
I once gave birth to you
just as I will entomb you again
into the cycle of fathomless creation
a symbiosis of life and death

Turn matter into dust
storm of dispersion
all that once was is lost
inversion of the godâs creation

Flames have formed my state
it was you who fed the hunger
of the starving fire
as sign of my gratitude
I dry your tears with my arid breath

Among the dead I wander
above the ruins of your world I sweep
uniting what is asunder
from the highest place down into the deep

Ashes remain, I stain the purification
swallowed by the rain, back into the initiation

I embrace ages of ambiguity
for I embody a terminal certainty
kings have crossed my path, empires kneeled before me
my strength is all-determining, I prevail at last

Ashes remain

Among the dead I wonder
I prevail at last
