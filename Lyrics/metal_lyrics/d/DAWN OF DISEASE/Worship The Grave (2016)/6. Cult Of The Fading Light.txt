An all-embracing knowledge
causes sadness in your eyes
awareness of the final sunset
the terminal dark arises
everything has long been arranged 
we are just few of the last of your kind
carrying the weight of a thousand
the rite of twilight starts

Watch the sunlight die
cult of the fading light
the evenfall arrives
cult of the fading light

A vanishing breath of hope
hovers above the scenery
where words are becoming obsolete
and silence swallows the thoughts
imagination reaches its threshold
time and space no longer exist
the end comes creeping
eternal night caresses the world

Meaninglessness
upon us all
nothing remains
from the downfall
diminishing tide
this is our final doom

Manifestation
of the incomprehensible
impossible to see through
no more reason
for finding the answers
when there is no remembrance

Crying out our destiny
the cult passed on to set us free
conclusion of our era
everlasting

Watch the sunlight die
cult of the fading light
the evenfall arrived
cult of the fading light
