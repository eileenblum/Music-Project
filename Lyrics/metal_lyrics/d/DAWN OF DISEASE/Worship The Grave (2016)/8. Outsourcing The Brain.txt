The dying has begun â your world is just a shade
the lie of your truth â embodied misery
external death of mind â humanity shall fall
amnesia will rise â upon you all

Your eyes are pale, your skin is cold
all insanity is now unfold 
outsourcing the brain
your free will has just been slain

The convenience of ignorance guides you through these days
while knowledge seems to hinder your weak soul
the surreal state of self-inflicted emptiness
reflects the lack of individuality

Progress in the aim of our world
regardless of irreversible changes
in the structures that keep you alive

It devours your thoughts
no sign of self-determination
you are free falling
as you march the dead end road

An omnipresent fear wonât let you find your way
just like a sweet drug in bitter condemnation
the walls are closing in â there is no way to escape
from the unseen demise of sanity

Outsourcing the brain
and everything you have been was just in vain
