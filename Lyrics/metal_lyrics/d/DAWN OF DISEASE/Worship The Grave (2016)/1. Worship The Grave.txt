We are coming from the emptiness
abandoned by mankind
enlightened by darkness
digging our own graves
we are coming from the emptiness
following our spirits through the dusk

Serving the inversion of all human belief
negating life - affirming death
ascension into the soil - redemption is near
hail the divine blasphemy

Dwelling in the obscurity of nonentity
apotheosis - our gift to receive
turning graveyards into sanctuaries
when all is dead and gone
worship the grave

We are invoking the emptiness
to bring our sacred gnosis
a ritual in darkness
the vault shall be our church
we are invoking the emptiness
entombed for the ultimate insight

Worship the grave - communion beyond the edge of time
Worship the grave - adoration of the most high
Worship the grave - religion of demise and chaos
Worship the grave - until the last sight

Praising the encounter with our sepultural deity
bringing death for satisfaction
ascension into the soil - the gathering is complete
hail the divine blasphemy
