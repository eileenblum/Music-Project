Divinity forced into human flesh
to purify the disbelievers
deliverance from life
now inhume the deformed incarnation

A prophet laid to rot
false ideals â mental perversion
profane this assumed god
salvation from indoctrination

Assassination of a higher being
fated to receive a mortal doom

The saviour's tomb

Inhume the deformed incarnation

Iconoclastic wrath will reign
nothing to remember the undesired slain
unhallowed blood leaves the body right here
no return to the numinous sphere

Assassination of a higher being 
facing the everlasting gloom
dragged into the filth of passing
fated to receive a mortal doom
