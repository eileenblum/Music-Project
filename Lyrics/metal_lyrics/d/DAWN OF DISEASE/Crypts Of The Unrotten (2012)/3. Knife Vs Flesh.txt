Hungry for the taste of humans
Serving the dead

The holy pleasure
Archaic bloodshed

Slaves to the blade
Remnants of flesh
Rusted and stump
From hundred sacrifices

Negation of human life
Long live the dead
It's time to feed the lifeless
Once again

Knife vs. flesh
Humans turned to meat
Knife vs. flesh
The dead I want to feed
Knife vs. flesh
I separate the skine
Knife vs. flesh
To eat the flesh within

Slaughter of mankind
Butcher of forsaken souls

Cutting the flesh to the bones
Ecstasy in the sound of dying
Never ending hunger
The killing goes on
Searching the next victim
Chosen to die

Watching how the own
Body is cut and thewed
Dividing what used to
Hold the flesh together

Blood runs out
Bathing in the bowels
Feasting on the flesh
Of the perishing

Never ending hunger
The killing goes on
Searching the next victim
Chosen to die

Watching how the own
Body is cut and thewed
Dividing what used to
Hold the flesh together

Blood runs out
Bathing in the bowels
Feasting on the flesh
Of the perishing
