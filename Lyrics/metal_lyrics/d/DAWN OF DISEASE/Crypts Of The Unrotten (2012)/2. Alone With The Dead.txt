Parasites
Devouring their lifeless bodies
Determine life
Of the one who chose the fate
To stay alive
Among the legions of the decayed
Prepared to die
To join the godforsaken

Searching for sense in a life that's in vain
Finding the sense in a life with the slain
Cursing the blood running out of his head
Salting the wounds he cuts into flesh

Living a life alone with the dead

Crushing the lies
The promise of eternal life
Inverted to
Infernal life - a dead without end
Time runs out
Reality becomes illusion
As the forgotten soul
Starts to eat its own foul body

Living a life alone with the dead
Their pale bodies lie and wait
Living a life alone with the dead
Until his gods will forget
