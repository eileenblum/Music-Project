Silence underneath the ground
The catacombs they swallow you
Trying not to suffocate
In the presence of the dead

Face the fate of darkness - catacombs
Smell th stench of demise - catacombs
No one's there to guide you - catacombs
You become a part of the - catacombs

Godless left to perish in the deep
Memories into oblivion
Your senses are now fading
Panic starts to grow

Screaming for the help of a divinity
To release you from this dark infinity
The catacombs they don't know god
Their only confession is your demise

Running the corridors of despair
Feeling the end is coming near

No escape from this doom
Fear is the last thing you feel
Maggots crawling beneath skin
You realize your death

Your death
