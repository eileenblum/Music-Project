Shreds of ancient clothes covering
Disfigured by the hands of time
The absence of life is omnipresent
Moaning they are reaching for the light

The Unrotten

I come back to life
And what do I see
Dead eyes of the unrotten
Staring down at me

Obscure faces
Mirror the final moment
Suffering preserved
For eternity

Dried out
Conserved in the crpyts
Masses in the darkness
Lasting 'til judgement day

No more blood flowing through the veins
The coldness of the grave is possessing
Silent screams banish in the abyss of the deep
Never to rest in peace

The Unrotten

I come back to life
And what do I see
Dead cries of the unrotten
Will always be haunting me
