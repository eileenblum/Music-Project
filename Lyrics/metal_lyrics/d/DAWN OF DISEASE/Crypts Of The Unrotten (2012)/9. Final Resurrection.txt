The final breath
'Til the end of torture
One final war
Our last day to return

The final will
To the exhumation
The end of days
Be the final resurrection

Shattered by the forces
Of the army of the dead
Leaving their graves
To strike down the living

Endtime
Revenge of the undead race
Excarnation
Of what used to dwell on earth

Apocalypse is here

Awaken 
From the bottom
Of the darkest place

Starving
Lusting for the last extermination

Instinctively hunting
Every being has an end
Exposed to the never ending hunger
And the anger of the damned

Dead is hunting

The Final Resurrection
