Once alive
Fade away
In a sea of flames

I feel rapture
In the sight
As you all are drowned in 

Fire

Burn
Burn the skin
Burn the flesh
Burn the bones
They turn to ash

Burn the thoughts
Burn the soul
What is left are only

Calcined bones
On the fields of death
Carcasses scattered
Fire in the last breath

Coming to take your life
No mercy

Fed to the flames
Vanish in the storm of fire
Fed to the flames
Nothing for the parasites

Fragmentation
Crushed existence
Of the skeleton

Absolute
Reduction
To the final reign of 

Chaos
