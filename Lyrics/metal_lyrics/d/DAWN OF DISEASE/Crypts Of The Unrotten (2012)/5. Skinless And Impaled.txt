Watch them
Hundreds of thousands
On the way to their grave
Not a single one knows
What will await them

Dawn of day
Let the massacre begin
Each and everyone
Is forced to loose the skin
Chains and swords
Manipulating them
Still they are
Alive and breathing

Helpless are without a will
They come to the final kill

Skinless and Impaled
Drowned in their remains
Swimming in a sea of corpses
The massacre is insane

Die, die, die
They're not dead enough
The deep fall
Will break their spine
For those
Who are still alive
The drilling stakes
Will do the rest

Thrown into a pit of spikes
None of them will be sparred

Tortured and condemned
They come to an end
