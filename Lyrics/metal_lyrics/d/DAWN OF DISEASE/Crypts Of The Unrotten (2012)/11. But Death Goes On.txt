Termination of humankind

Virus set upon the earth
A disease called death
Kneeling down to beg,
For the grace of god

Come to enter paradise
Salvation from the burden of life
Answer the call
Of your false prophet

You can not hide
All seeing eyes
That's what you've been praying for
All the time

Not yet you bastard hypocrites
Even realized
What time has come
The dying has begun

The era of the most high
Nothing down into the dirt
Of a future
Far away from imagination

Gathered for the last sacrifice
Begging for absolution
Trying to stop the killing divine
But death goes on

No immediate demise 
A slow and painful act
Of rotting
While the eyes are still on fire

Senseless rituals
Release from all the sins
Answer the call
That's what you've been praying for 
All the time
