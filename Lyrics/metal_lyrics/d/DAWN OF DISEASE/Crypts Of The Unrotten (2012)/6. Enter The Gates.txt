Bloodstained ground filled with corpses
Shattered bodies lay down to rot
Stench of death fills the air
A bestial carnage now finds an end

Still alive - with bleeding wounds
I realize - the end is near
Flesh is cold - dead inside
Beneath the skin - parasites

Enter the gates
To the other side

Enter the light
Which shines so bright

The pain I suffer makes me insane
I start to crawl without an aim
Forced will to live, no hope is left
I close my eyes and start to pass away

Infected flesh turning gray
I lose my face the skin fades

A slow decay of hundred corpses
Stench of death fills the air
An open graveyard, no final rest
To manifest - the bestial carnage
