[Lyrics: Knobel, music: Pizzuti]

I'm surrounded by useless corpses, one bother that feeds my rage
There's always someone that reminds me they exist as a thing called "life" has given them a trace
I'm so disgusted, blinded by my mind. Are we unable to be alive?
United in illness, sadness and hate
But here everybody think with their brain
The weak are injured by the truth
Scars of a low conception of life
Give them a reason to survive
As they realized they don't possess nothing
Nothing at all
Fake! Another step in the void
Into involution we're drowned
No need to explain
When darkness comes you need to fail
The sky it's turning grey
Messages fall with the rain
It's so insane
No one had ever thought for a day
If nothing had really been created
"How it's possible?" you say
No one was born
Believers will disagree
For me this is a true
A lot of this facts are clear
I'm so conceived
We are walking under the breeze of this holy
Nihilism dawn
Nihilistic awakening
Nihilistic awakening
Pull the noose, around the neck
Thrown down from the chair, and I'll be proud
If it is too much for you, get your death
I am waiting for the last act
As rival you suck! Useless piece of humankind
I'm surrounded by you
So irritable sense of disgust
Dirty atmosphere insane
I am waiting for your last lethal act
I am waiting for the last, newest act of a cruel suicide
