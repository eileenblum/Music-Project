[Lyrics: Pizzuti, music: Pizzuti]

Non-existent iron immunity
Unconscious of some rotten thinks
Begotten in a tortured brain
Why believe to be the one?

Heart's beat begins to accelerate
Your fetid breath was never be so loud
Sweat's drops drain on the back
Damping a deflorate cunt
Torn clothes at this disgusting whore
Face smashed on the floor
Suffering is the price for your attitude
Abused body uselessly screams

Just the beginning of a nightmare awakened
To test an holy desire with his reactions

This empty carcass starts to bleed
Now just one need
Grabbed from the hair her fucking head
On the wall will be spread

Abused body uselessly screams

Sadism, determination
An horrifying dissection

Difficulty to swallow
Through lacerated mouth
The punisher gallow
Slash your throat in half

Wriggle is not a solution
Disfigured face
An unbearable pain
For this fucking race

Vomit increases
To maximum pressure
Made of blood and sperm
The slow choking is sure

The pain that I cause
Feeds me everyday
And when the pleasure grows
I punish, you decay
