[Lyrics: Knobel, music: Knobel]

Hanged bodies on the trees
Pleasant way to see their cruel demise
Sickness comes from within
Grows out from the entrails, develops in the throat
Gripping the despair flow
Wrapping the core of pain
Claim all things denied
It's a flow's abysmal hate
Torture treatment of revenge
Carving their own sign, unsatisfactory
Needles onset of decay
Inject all the will to erase somehow
It's a tank of diseases
Harder core of disgust
Blend the strength, with your hate
Fistful filled of revenge

Every facts deserved in past
Someway it damaged our-self
All the visions of torment
These are the coils of vengeance
Sold in the name of shame
Lost the dignity and become nothing
Forced to to eat the feces
Enslaved by something that rules all your faults
Day by day I declare my hate
Sweating violence within
Day by day I swear
You'll pray for the bitter guilt of your birth

Day by day I declare my hate
Sweating violence within
For all faults without remorse
They will be the coils of vengeance
