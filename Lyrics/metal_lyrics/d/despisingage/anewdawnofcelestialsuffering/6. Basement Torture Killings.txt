[Lyrics: Knobel, music: Knobel]

Seized and sedated
Chosen with criterion
They are beaten if they don't cooperate
Closed into the basement, tortured in every way
Obey to satisfy the author of so many killings
Basement, torture, it's so real
Killings, of innocents. I'm the maker, omnipresent, maniac
Swollen torso, teeth everywhere
Thousand hammer blows on these heads
Seven inches blades, to carve out the flesh
Gutted bellies with a screwdriver
Nauseating stench
I use up to let you die
This horror makes me horny
It's so exciting to see you submissive
Forsaken, naked and nailed
Pavement of severed heads, eyes wide open
Gaze the monster who done this
You have been conceived for this!
Basement, torture, it's so real
Killings, of innocents, I'm the maker, omnipresent, maniac
Basement
I'll set you free, maybe!
No one gets out alive

Your remnants will lie into my heart
