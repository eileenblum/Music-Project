[Lyrics: Pizzuti, music: Pizzuti]

Pyroclastic toxic storm
Infestation of the womb
Crushing winds of disgrace
Sublime ending of the race

Beyond warning and advises
Still incrementing the demise
Global chaos: true carnage
It's our final heritage
Victims of selfishness
With delusions of leadership
Disgust for altruism
Stab wound to serenity

Atmosphere erosion
Meteors lethal collisions
Cataclyism: nature's rage
It's our final heritage

Agonizing rush to death
Termination of the breath
Screams of anger to declaim
The countdown of our time

When the light turns into darkness
The blackest day of humanity will come
No more reason to fight, no more reason to live
Extinction shall be done

Earthquakes strike and erase
They will take us to the own grave
Polar ice caps slowly thaws
There'll be denied a new dawn

Omnivore to survive
Ethnic bloodbath where can dive
Low curtain: last men stage
Was our final heritage
