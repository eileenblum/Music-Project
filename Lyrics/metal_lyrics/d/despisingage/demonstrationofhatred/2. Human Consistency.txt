[Lyrics: Knobel, music: Pizzuti]

All human equals manure, about the consistency
Ideals and fixations induce them to an extermination
Low interior esteem, they sell themselves with the masses
Loyal act of penitence, sentenced for what they said
Serve my needs, slaves
Your words got no worth
Worship your leader
I'm your punishment
Piles of entrails of men without a brain
Rely to your faith, trust in misery
Get on your knees, violence for free
Judgment by my hands, serve my needs, slaves
Fucking slaves
Hold back your screams, hold back your rights,
Be prepared to receive the fetid benediction
Open your mouth
Enjoy the notions
Rude, barbaric, disgusting, obscene, repulsive
All human equals manure, about the consistency
Ideals and fixations induce them to an extermination
You are forced to:
Serve my needs, slaves
Your words got no worth
Worship your leader
I'm your punishment
Disgrace: rottenness
