[Lyrics: Knobel, music: Pizzuti]

Living the age of despise
Ruled by icon of decay
Losing trust in name of them
Falling into deep
Suicide answer of mistakes
Despising
Age no one wishes to obey
Despising age
Standing the age of despise
Beseech people save yourself
Tasting cyanide: ecstasy
When you're dying at pillory
Despising age
Mothers blinded by revenge
Dig their children into graves
Working plans to escape
Without kill themselves
â¦and no one wishes to survive
They will live it all
Human hate mankind, as mankind hates human
Concrete facts of suffering, bring world to collision
Unleash feelings: agony, no way to realize
Follow parents into wars, children grown in hate
Welcome to despising age, the offering of life
â¦it will never ends
We'll live in decay
