[Lyrics: Pizzuti, music: Pizzuti]

Frail and vulnerable this illusionist existence
Gave us from the rotten womb of inhumanity
Buried by spite and deceit
Lies torn into the deepest darkness

Devoured by worms and remorse
While the gleam of an Utopian light
Continues to feed hope
Destined only to decompose

Premature expressions of pain
For many people still hidden in the unconscious
It severs from the daily reality
And annihilates any ideal

Deception and greed
Bringer of an epidemic cancer
Zeroed personality, infected seed matrix
That produces helpless minds to shape

Appearance and having to beâ¦
In this walk in the shade
Observable self-destruction
Zoning out in the third person

Zombie wandering in the fog
Without a goal, without a purpose
Wandering continuously
Through this boundless graveyard

Through this boundless rotted graveyard

Leaving for a one-way trip
With sealed eyes
Through the bowels of degeneration
And reopen them only at destination

Six feet under
