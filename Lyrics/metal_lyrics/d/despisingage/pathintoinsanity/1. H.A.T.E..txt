[Lyrics: Knobel, music: Pizzuti]

Loathe
Repugnance of human beings flows under the skin
It chokes the calm, it kills the right
Not even blood will satisfy
Horrendous aversion towards everything
Towards everyone!
Hungry jackals everywhere
Grows the will to spread a new massage of vehemence
Look at the world that should be banned
Horrendous aversion towards everything
Towards everyone!
