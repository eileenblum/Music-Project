[Lyrics Knobel, music: Pizzuti]

Living in fear, a step to despair, closer conditions of own decay
Sinister decisions, the will to react, despite the need, the need to be helped
Schizophrenic and unstable inner coherence
Maybe those abuses have nothing to do. Nothing!
Mental detachment, rotten membranes, only the eyes see right through clearly
I must understand if they're corrupted. Grabbing the head and counting the days
This vertigoes are deeper than it seems. Whole grief and hate are keys of discomfort
Frenzied desire to face my fears, upset brain divorced from beginning attempts and failures will dig into veins
Paranoid will to submerge, own existence, into abyss of this domain made by flesh and chronic fears, desperation constantly real
Unstoppable, flow to my head, driven by thrills and hysteria
Stains on the skin, scars of a knife, remnants of who tried to die
Counterphobic state advanced:
Bipolar anxious state
Panophobia depressive
Mental torture and physical by the haste!
Mindful of madness, I'm the wretched, psychologically deranged
I'm scared, my hands are death, my mind a threat
Counterphobic state advanced:
Bipolar anxious state
Panophobia depressive
Mental torture and physical. Being a step, to despair
True conditions, of own decay. Born the will to react but I need to be helped
