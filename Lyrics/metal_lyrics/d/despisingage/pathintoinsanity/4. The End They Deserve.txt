[Lyrics: Knobel, music: Knobel]

Judgement day has come, it rejects this race
Choosing if someone worths, answer already known
Columns of lost souls, bodies lie on roads
Joined hands to save himself, prayers ever heard

This world slowly dies, tomb of the humankind
Suffering they will meet
Pain chokes the weakest screams
All of them prefer to serve instead to face the end they deserve

Pigs!

Icons of inferiority recruited in mass
Worthless organisms, they're compound of shame
Worldwide mass deletion of those who never shown
Who they were and what they could achieve

Now it's the end
The end they deserve: a genocide
Weeping souls emerge during rituals, remembering who they were
Now it's the end, the only end, an holy end
The end they deserve
Each man is war, crowd is destruction
Seriously committed to play God
Source of selfishness and arrogance, sons of creed and ignorance
Core of fragility, false appearances, the first puppets ready to fall
The vision of the end is not far off
You should hear it its voice
Their homes have become tombs
Realize that there's nothing left to do
Farewell for life
Forever, forever and for life

Judgement day has come, it rejects this race
Choosing if someone worths
Answer already known
Stratospheric grave, nothing on surface
Silence everywhere, the famous time has come
A new era grows, nature takes control
Heals all the scars for what happened in past
But it's the end, who foresaw it? I've no regret
Years spent complaining that nothing has changed
Guilty and ungrateful
Now it's the end, the only end, an holy end
All of them get the end they deserve
The end they deserve
Everyone gets the fuck he deserves
