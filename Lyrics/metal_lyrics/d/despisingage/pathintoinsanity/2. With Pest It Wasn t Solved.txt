[Lyrics: Knobel, music: Knobel]

With pest it wasn't solved
Seed of shame of human filthiness, born for slavery
In past it was assumed, all you were dead, by hands of the plague
With pest it wasn't solved
Violent resolution
One step forward and thousand back
Among all of you prophets and detectors of nothing resolved
Cold necessary rehabilitation
Worldwide hate, ready to fall
This time for real? â¦And you will fall!
I spy the world to see how it falls apart
I'll be a hermit and I save myself from the crap like you
From the crap that you have built.
Indelible, desperate truth so sore, this shit never ends
With pest it wasn't solved

I lost my optimism living into skepticism
I'm the man, you are the puke and your morbid fear to lose
Anxious paranoids, driven by through the prejudices
Severe laws of no return
Is this the end that you me owe?
Is the end
