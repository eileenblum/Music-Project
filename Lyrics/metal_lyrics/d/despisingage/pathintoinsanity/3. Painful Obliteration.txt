[Lyrics: Knobel, music: Pizzuti]

Just as we forgot the word respect
It will erase the scum human parasites
As we separate the legs to insects
For them there's only a way to purify within
Painful obliteration
Been created for human waste
Severe annihilation, global pain, the price of indifference
Fate eradicates the uterus of dirt
It will sink roots, depriving the growth
A countdown is started, they march in a row
We will close this chapter, theyâll drown in the void
Painful obliteration
Centuries of perseverance
Harrowing supplication, one by one, the blood deserves to flow
It stabs the good of everything, spreading the disease of own voice.
There's no freedom today
Weâre enslaved by whims of human shame
The time has come, we will be erased
Forgotten
Just a matter of time and suffering
A matter of time, a waiting so bleak
Painful
