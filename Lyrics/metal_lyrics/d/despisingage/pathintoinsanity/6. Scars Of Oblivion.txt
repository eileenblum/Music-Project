[Lyrics: Pizzuti, music: Pizzuti]

Trapped inside a casing of rotten flesh
With brain washed since your birth
Instincts holden by a chained mind.
Express yourself with unspoken words!

Living in fear to be judged
Fear to be inappropriate at this vicious circle
Pushed out from the herd, left alone as punishment
Like a leper: contagious, like a mistake
Inconvenient

Donât ask you any question just watch you what they want
A silent slaughter around us. Keep low your head and pray your God

Programmed and forced to sweat to grow the insatiable pigs
Hungry for authority, free to crush the liberty

Psychological submission
Retribution for your efforts

Brandished scepter in front of cerebral misery
Masses lined up to receive the infected daily bread
Million lives already enslaved, million lives await to follow
Let the fools perish to sustain inhuman stakes

This pandemic sickness and frantic existence
Rabid pawns with fried mind
What is yours? What is true?
Condemned to loose the game
Without say in which name
Face the present day after day
Until death is the same

Psychological submission
Retribution for your efforts
