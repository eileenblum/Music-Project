I'm letting you know. Letting you go.
Time is in flow. Apart we grow.
We're reaching for random glimpses of joy
We should have known that everything we do,
and what we know, everything we learned;
Now it's all coming back so clear.

Time will never be on our side.
Not long ago it seemed so right.
But we are wasting our lifes.

Life makes it call, we stumble and fall.
Hoping for bliss, a final kiss.
Watching it slowly fade away.
Right from the start patterns repeat.
We are all watching the show, stuck in the front row.
And in the end we die alone.

Time, will never be on our side.
Not long ago it seemed so right.
But we are wasting our lifes.
Time, will never be on our side.
Not long ago it seemed so right.
But we grow into disguise.

Treasure the moments.
Soon they'll fade away
Treasure the moments.
Because in the end we die alone.

Time, will never be on our side.
Not long ago it seemed so right.
But we are wasting our lifes.
Time, will never be on our side.
Not long ago it seemed so right.
But we grow into disguise.
