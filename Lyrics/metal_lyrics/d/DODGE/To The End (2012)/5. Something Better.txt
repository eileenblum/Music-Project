I knew it was something. I remember those words.
I used to be someone. Haven't you heard?
Feeling so lonely. Crawling on the ground.
Not making a sound of whatÂ´s in my mind.
I know itÂ´s true, but what could I do?
IÂ´m begging you please, explain how it seems.
I know it was something, I remember those words.
"We will be nothing"; well thatÂ´s what IÂ´ve heard.

I close my eyes. I begin to pray, and long way.
You and I, we could be something. Yes we will be something.
Better than them.

I know they say sometimes; IÂ´m just a fool.
Just playing a game. Using fun as a tool.
Now Things going deeper, more than I show.
If it doesn't turn out right, then who will know?
I can see how you and me. Can make something different if we start to believe.
I know it was something. I remember those words.
"We will be nothing"; well thatÂ´s what IÂ´ve heard.

I close my eyes. I begin to pray, and long way.
You and I, we could be something. Yes we will be something.
Better than them.

Close my eyes!
I close my eyes.
Begin to pray
Long away
You and i. Now you and I.

I close my eyes. I begin to pray, and long away.
You and I, we could be something, yes we will be something.
Better than them.
