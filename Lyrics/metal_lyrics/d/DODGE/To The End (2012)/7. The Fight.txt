What if some of you never comes with me?
What if anything never comes down?
What if some of you never assist me?
What if I should say this out loud?
What if some of you bitch about nothing?
What if some of you fall for greed?
What if some of you find it amusing while I have to stay and bleed?

What fears me is if I can't take it. If I cant keep my feet on the ground.
What happens if weÂ´ve got to fake it, and forget what is keeping us bound?
What if everything turns into a fight, and the energy will never be found?
What if nothing ever goes right? What if we go down?

What did you say? DonÂ´t turn it away.
You will end up saying; "What are we missing"?
The harder we try, the harder we fall.
Remember I said; "Fighting won't make it".

Why should we keep them from trippinÂ´?
So what if they never shut up?
This is not territorial pissing. Does it look like we give a fuck?
Take a good look at what we've invested, and you know what we have been through.
We keep our minds from getting infested.
So triggered by punks like you

Whatever you say - you can never touch me.
Whatever you say - just fuck you all.

What did you say? DonÂ´t turn it away.
You will end up saying; "What are we missing"?
The harder we try, the harder we fall.
Remember I said; "Fighting won't make it".

It was something to be shared.
Now why do I even care?
You now what IÂ´ve paid for this to come out.
Of course I need to show. IÂ´m feeling this alone.
ItÂ´s hard and itÂ´s tearing me apart.
It was something to be shared.
Now why do I even care?
Give up the fight! Take it all away!

What did you say? DonÂ´t turn it away.
You will end up saying; "What are we missing"?
The harder we try, the harder we fall.
Remember I said; "Fighting won't make it".

What did you say? DonÂ´t turn it away.
You will end up saying; "What are we missing"?
The harder we try, the harder we fall.
Remember I said; "Fighting won't make it".
