Will I ever stand up, head up straight or will it always seem like IÂ´m about faint.
Nothing else but despair is what comes out of this.
Slap me around. Beat me up. ItÂ´s your touch that I miss.
Pull my strings! I obey what ever you say
Pull my strings! submission is the price that I pay.

Control me like IÂ´m hypnotized.

ItÂ´s just make believe that it was heaven sent.
My simplemindness leeds to things I can't prevent.
No control. Led by you. I can never resist.
All these lies killing me. Why wonÂ´t you let me be?
Pull my strings! I obey what ever you say.
Pull my strings! submission is the price that i pay.

Control me like IÂ´m hypnotized.
If I could break out. If I could stand up. If I just realized.
Make me bleed, make me crawl on my knees. Pull my strings like youÂ´re my puppeteer.
If I could break out. If I could stand up. If I just realized.

Hunt me down Â´til your strings are attached.
Pull me in, push me out.
Make a fool out of me, and make me suffer more.
When IÂ´m tied I move at your will.
Tangled up in your strings.
I can't control myself. IÂ´ve lost my will to live.
You should know. I will fight to be free.
But IÂ´m down on my knees, itÂ´s turning me unreal, a puppet in your clutch.
Once unspoiled. Now let down and torn apart.
But I know that I stand.. stand above you. And whatÂ´s best is you know that itÂ´s true!

I just realized. I just want to live though IÂ´m falling apart.

Control me like IÂ´m hypnotized.
If I could break out. If I could stand up. If I just realized.
Make me bleed make me crawl on my knees. Pull my strings like youÂ´re my puppeteer.
If I could break out. If I could stand up. If I just realized.
You are my puppetteer
You are my puppetteer.
If I could break out, if I could stand up, if I just realized.
