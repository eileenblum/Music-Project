You sighed. It was something that I said.
You want me to slow down.
I drown wathing your beutiful eyes. Just want you to know.

I should go. You make me feel things never known.
IÂ´m falling again, afraid to let go.
You should know you teach me something thatÂ´s all new.
IÂ´m falling in love.

You shine just like a star.
It burns into my heart.
IÂ´m lost as IÂ´m reaching way too far.

I try so hard to never show, but IÂ´m burning inside.
Your smile, your lips, your breath, your touch makes me out of my mind.

I should go. You make me feel things never known.
IÂ´m falling again, afraid to let go.
You should know, you teach me something thatÂ´s so new.
IÂ´m falling in love.

You shine, just like a star.
It burns into my heart.
IÂ´m lost as IÂ´m reaching way too far.
