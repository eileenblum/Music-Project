Hey! IÂ´ll tell you something, but ItÂ´s pointless to say. You don't know how to get there.
So, IÂ´ll give you nothing. I stay in control when youÂ´re going under.
Oh, I know, that everything just last for a while.

This time itÂ´s all for real.
Things that I have done are meaningless to compare.
DonÂ´t you stick up to me.
Nothing in the past can make it easy.

Let me understand this.
You want me to show the options youÂ´ve got left.
No, donÂ´t make no sound. It wonÂ´t do you no good.
Just turn and walk the last round.
Oh, I know, that everything just last for a while.

This time itÂ´s all for real.
Things that I have done are meaningless to compare.
DonÂ´t you stick up to me.
Nothing in the past can make it easy

I know what itÂ´s like.
I know how it ends.
I know what itÂ´s like
I know how it ends.

This time itÂ´s all for real.
Things that I have done are meaningless to compare.
DonÂ´t you stick up to me.
Nothing in the past can make it easy.
