IÂ´m hit by this moment, and the smell of sex.
I turn towards you. Your eyes look back at mine.
Then I push you down.
You make a little moan. My blood rush through my veins.
And makes me grow.
Your hands are on me. I feel them trembling to my skin.
We can never go back.

WeÂ´re acting insane
This time we keep falling down. We push it all the way.
Push it!
DonÂ´t think about pain.
You know that I won't slow down.
I'm gonna push you all the way.

The sounds you make baby, while I squeeze and caress your skin
And oh, such lips, makes excitement rise. Your eyes looks so satisfied.
Then you let me inside.
IÂ´m lost in exctasy when our liquides unite.
And then; "It was nice, goodbye".

WeÂ´re acting insane
This time we keep falling down. We push it all the way.
Push it!
DonÂ´t think about pain.
You know that I won't slow down.
I'm gonna push you all the way.
All the way!
