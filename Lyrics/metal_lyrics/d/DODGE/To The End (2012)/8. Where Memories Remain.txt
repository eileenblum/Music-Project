You live your life, and you think that you are free.
Everyday caught in reality.

There is a place where I go to pretend.
Where memories remain until the end.
Where girls bid you welcome, and boys turn to men.
I feel it, you feel it.

You want to fly, but youÂ´re stuck to the ground.
I see you screaming.. can't hear a sound.

There is a place where I go to pretend.
Where memories remain until the end.
Where girls bid you welcome, and boys turn to men.
This is the place where I always can be. Me, myself and my memories.
ItÂ´s hidden there, deep inside of me.
I feel it, you feel it.

We live our lives everyday. Feel it now.
We struggle to make it ok. I dream away.
We live our lives everyday. I dream away.
We truggle to make it ok. I dream away.

There is a place where I go to pretend.
Where memories remain until the end.
Where girls bid you welcome, and boys turn to men.
I feel it, you feel it.
This is the place where I always can be.
Me, myself and my memories
ItÂ´s hidden there, deep inside of me.
I feel it, you feel it.
