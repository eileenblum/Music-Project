[bonus track]

There is thunder ahead
I just want you to know this
My eyes will be set on you
Because you are my game today

I know your face, know the life you live
I know enough, let your fears ride on free
I'll bring you down, soon you'll know

You cannot hide cause I know where you are
I read the fear in your eyes
Just like an open book
I'll find a way to take back what is mine
I'll be your foe and I will fight
Just like a loaded gun

Revenge is all mine
I just want you to know this
Cause life ain't a game no more
Lightning is waiting to strike

Can you hear Heaven calling out your name
A choir of angels taking home their claim
Defeat is near now, my friend
