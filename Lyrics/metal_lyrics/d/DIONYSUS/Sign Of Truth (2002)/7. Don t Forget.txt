You're running to me with a smiling face
I look at you thoughts are hitting me
How could I ever think that it was right
To justify my state of insanity

So I close my eyes and thanking all the gods
That I opened up my mind and realized
That some things are meant to be
So don't forget who I am and that I
Always will be there and try
To do the best that I can to be
Some one that you can rely on when
Life seams to fall apart.
So what ever happened to you... don't forget.
I know that I wanted to run away
And that I painted my world all in black
Could only see the picture of myself
Standing there with nothing by broken dreams
I cant ask for understanding cause I know
That what I tried so hard to get away from then
Now couldn't live without
