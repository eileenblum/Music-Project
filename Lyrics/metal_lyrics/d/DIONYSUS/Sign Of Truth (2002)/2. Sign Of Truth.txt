Soon we will come to the end...
Mankind's madness failed once again
We are caught in a trap
Soon it's to late!

Try to carry on in a world of greed and hate
When time is passing by I hope for a brighter day.
Try to fight it back while my faith is torn apart
By children without hope with eyes that haven't shine since long ago.

[Chorus:]
Longing for a sign of truth
When greed and hate are vanished, dead and gone
Longing for a sign of truth
When all children laugh and justice has been done...

Secrets forever untold...
I wish we could all be there for you
Make their pain go away!!!
No more silent cries in the end...

Try to carry on in a world of greed and hate
When time is passing by I hope for a brighter day.
Try to fight it back while my faith is torn apart
By children without hope with eyes that haven't shine since long ago.

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus (x2)]
