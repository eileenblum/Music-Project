[Japan bonus track]

Earth was made round so we'd see
There's no borders to be found.
Mankind, under the same sun
Evolution never stopped

The empires fell apart,
...They all will rise and fall...
Creations survived the time,
...The ones built by us all

Child of time, born in the new dimension
YOU are sent to find the key into the past
Make them see that all their true beloved ones,
In a time to come had love to conquer all
After twenty centuries
There was thousand years of peace
Mankind changed the history
...And left hatred far behind...
