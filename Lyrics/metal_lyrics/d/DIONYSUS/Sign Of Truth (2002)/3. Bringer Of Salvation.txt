In hunger and in fury
In all of human race
The evils resurrection
In all time and space
Our faith is getting weaker
Our hopes are dead and gone.
Who is here to guide us?
To see right from wrong?
To be there for the lonely?
Be there for the weak?
To show us what we're here for?
To make our lives complete?

I just wanna know what's true in order to survive.
Forever in my heart I will believe the hands of time
Though we fear and though we try to make us strong inside
Maybe he'll never l arrive
As long as we don't try

A fiction or a savior?
Fate has chosen you?
Mankind needs your guidance
Something to believe into
We're born into a mission
To grow and realize
We're here for something greater
Above ignorance and dimes
To be there for the lonely
Be there for the weak
Show them what we're here for
Make our lifes compleate

I just wanna know what's true in order to survive.
Forever in my heart I will belive the hands of time
Though we fear and though we try to make us strong inside
Maby he'll never l arrive
As long as we don't try

To be there for the lonely
Be there for the weak
Show them what we're here for
Make our lifes compleate

I just wanna know what's true in order to survive.
Forever in my heart I will belive the hands of time
Though we fear and though we try to make us strong inside
Maby he'll never l arrive as long as we don't try
We will try.....
