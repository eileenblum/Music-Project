I can see the light is shining
Fate has shown my destiny.
From the never ending fire, flames burning in me.
I won't wait 'till life has fading
Away from the prophecy.
Time will tell if flames still burning
But it's ment to be.

In the sky the stars are shining all upon the Gods.
From their view they see it diffrent how the dreams come true.

We are heading for tomorrow
We are heading for the light
Far awy from lies and sorrows
We could make our paradise... some never realize...

I can't say I'm not religious.
But I don't mind if you're in church!"
I can't say "I am no sinner!"
Cause I'm filled with dirt.
Who I'm I to judge somebody?
I just wanna be myself
I don't wanna be a puppet
Time to come will tell...
