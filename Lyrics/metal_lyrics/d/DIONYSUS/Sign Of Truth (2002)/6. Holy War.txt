Weapons of steel, horses of thunder
He rides the wind, fighting the sin
Demons and ghosts, he pulls them under
He makes the laws and he will win
Lord of the magic twilight, king of the eternal flame
We're fighting right at your side against the creatures of hell
Holy Lord we will ride, straight to the light
We will stand together 'till the end of time
Beware, creatures of hell, we will prevail
Riding on a comet for the final day
Loyal and brave knights of the master
We won't forsake the holy land
Wise energy crosses our hearts
While the king touched our skin, ready to win
Lord of the magic twilight, king of the eternal flame
We're fighting right at your side against the creatures of hell
Holy Lord we will ride, straight to the light
We will stand together 'till the end of time
Beware, creatures of hell, we will prevail
Riding on a comet for the final day
So we will fight the beast, killing the tyrant and shedding his blood
To show the world that the evil is dead for eternity
Holy Lord we will ride, straight to the light
We will stand together 'till the end of time
Beware, creatures of hell, we will prevail
Riding on a comet for the final day
