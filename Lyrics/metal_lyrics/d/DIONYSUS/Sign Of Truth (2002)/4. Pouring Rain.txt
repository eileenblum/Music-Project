I can't believe this
Ten days have past
And still this endless rain
Keeps falling from the sky
I know I'll survive it
But this time the clouds cover the midnight sun
The beauty of my land
I know I can't cope with it anymore
I have to go I fly away
To a distant place
I take the chance and leave,
Away from this pouring rain
Night's getting closer
The season of light is fading long before it even has begun
I know I'll survive it
But that is the only consolation
When we see our precious days
Turn in to pieces once again
I have to go I fly away
To a distant place
I take the chance and leave,
Away from this pouring rain
I never knew that this would be
This is no place for me
My ship is caught at sea, the storm comes towards me
It's not that I don't like the (winter) snow
But I need sun to rest my soul
I never knew I'd need a shelter from the rain in the end of June
Maybe someone has cast a spell?
