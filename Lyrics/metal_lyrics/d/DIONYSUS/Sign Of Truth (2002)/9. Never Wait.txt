I'm lighting a candle for all of the victims around the world
Of pointless destructions and killing it's so unbelievable
I cannot see why this madness continues to grow all the time
I guess there is no way to understand
Something that is hard to believe even when it's there

In front of our eyes every day
To tell us that life never ever should be taken for granted

Never wait until tomorrow
Live life today
Cause in this world you never know what's goanna happen
You might not live to see tomorrow so live today

How does it come that the people are living their lives in fear
Wondering each day if this nightmare will ever come to an end
What kind of future is waiting for all of these innocent children
Who have to grow up in a broken world
Where joy and security seem so unreachable

Cause evil has no heart at all it strikes where it wants
And no one can tell whenever it's coming

Never wait until tomorrow
Live life today
Cause in this world you never know what's goanna happen
You might not live to see tomorrow, get on with it right away

Don't ever hesitate to tell the ones that you care about
How much they mean to you now while it's time
Don't wait another day!
