[intro]

You see the shadows closing in
I know the fall has just begun
Nowhere to hide you can't get out
You were trapped inside your lonely life...

[Verse 1]
Empty inside almost insane
Feel so lonely you're stuck to bare the pain
Only you can take control
Watch out before the hangman takes your soul

Don't hide there nowhere to run
No escaping from all the things you've done
It's time to face reality
There is no chance for you to feel...

[Bridge]
Falling, loosing your ground
And times running out but still you're blind

[Chorus]
You're down and out, you're lost in paradise
You're just a fool, a fraud filled with lies
You're in a land where shadows watching you
That land is only an illusion of life!

[Verse 2]
Watch out darkness will come on your way
Decide if you ever want to change
You're the one with the golden key
To the future and to your destiny

You need to find out who you are
Take my advice or else you wound get far
Stop pretending that you're the man
Guilty of charge it's time to take your stand

[Bridge]
Falling loosing your ground
And times running out but still you're blind

[Chorus]

[Stick]
You see the shadows closing in
I know the fall has just begun
Nowhere to hide you can't get out
You were trapped inside your lonely life!

[Chorus x2]
