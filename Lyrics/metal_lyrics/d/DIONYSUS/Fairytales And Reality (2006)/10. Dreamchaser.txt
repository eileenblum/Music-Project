[Verse 1]
Tears falling like comets collide
Stars; like dreams in the night
Oh, my mind is ablaze with the colours of love
Fireworks fantastic!

[Bridge]
Fear, feeling sincere, silently seeping in!
How, how can I live, can I go on?

[Chorus]
Dreamchaser, stargazer
Seed of the world
Search in your soul for the light
Can you hear the song?
Songwriter, sunsighter
Love is the sign
Follow your heart to the end
Become divine!

[Verse 2]
Sing, whispering galaxies, sing
Sail, on the winds of the sun
Let my soul come aware of the powers within
Let the new day dawn, then...

[Bridge]
Lingering life, I am reborn, revived
Song, I'm part of the song. A piece of our soul

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
