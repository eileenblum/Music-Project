[Verse 1]
Be deceived, its powers hidden
Darkness lurks, invisibility
Fear the deed of Carwan's hands-
A mythic treachery
Fireborn, to rule them all
An orb of might, hunger insatiable
Evil craft
A deadly tool, to seal the blasphemy
You will see

[Bridge]
And then the lands will fall as one
And if the light subdues defenders hope is gone

[Chorus]
Ancor, veiled in vengeance, calls its name
Powers far beyond the dreamers of the wild
Dark echoes shatter through a world unknowing
Shadow dying to behold the orb of warn

[Verse 2]
Minions march, to mountain city
See the beasts, creations of wizardry
Wails of war
Tonight the dead will die and rise again
Mirrors crack, the light is fading
Hate reviled, illusions and imagery
Feel the scent of fear and madness
darkness settles in
walls will bleed

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Stick 1]
And then all the lands are free
And the Carwan's fate is sealed
The singing king is crowned
And the world can live again
The mirrors are restored and Calannor fares on
By destiny he's bound to live on eternally

[Solo]

[Stick 2]
And then the orb will be destroyed
Will be taken by the flames and lost in history
So the world can carry on
And Calannor fares on and still lives on
And mankind will forget...

[Chorus]
Ancor, veiled in vengeance, calls its name
Powers far beyond the dreamers of the wild
Ancor, veiled in vengeance, calls its name
Powers far beyond the dreamers of the wild
Dark echoes shatter through a world unknown
Shadow dying to behold the orb of warn
