[Verse 1]
Like a song from a distant earth
Like a dream that is far too real
You took life as if was away from us
We were blind to the truth behind
We were tricked by your vicious mind
We had hopes of a different kind
We believed that the traveller had come

[Bridge]
So long souls lost, worlds lingered on
Our hopes were gone but we remained
As starts in a darkest place
A space of love so drained
And then, through eternities
You came to set us free

[Chorus]
We lost the game, in our minds grew madness
Your treachery, like a blade to the bone
You took our souls
But our dreams you left untouched
Silently we weep

[Verse 2]
It is dawn, it is time to go
time to save what is yet to save
We will leave for another world, reload!
Gather around, all our ships are packed
Say goodbye to your lives of old
Enter space, the embrace of cold set our path on a galaxy unknown

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Stick]
In darkness dreams begin to stir
Trough generations they live on, on and on!
We will regain our land, we will be back!
You will regret, you'll live to see
The day we come. The day of our return!

[Solo]

[Bridge]
As stars in a darkened place
A space of love so drained
And then, through eternities
You came to set us free

[Chorus]
Silently we weep!
