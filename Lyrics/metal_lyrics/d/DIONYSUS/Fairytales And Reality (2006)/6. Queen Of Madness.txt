[Verse 1]
Everything you've done to break me
Is written on the wall
I don't know where to go

I've been on the run from something
But I can't take control, in my mind you're behind

[Bridge]
Every night I fear that you will
Kill my heart and soul
Like a ghost inside of me
You whisper I'm your saviour!

[Chorus]
You're the queen of madness
Wears no crown
Lost in deepest sadness
Falling down
You deceived me
Blood stained and never free
You've blamed all your shame on me

[Verse 2]
I have made a promise
To get back on you someday
Justice come, it will be done

You will face the darkest future
You will go to hell
Time will tell, I wish you well

[Bridge]
The chill I feel at night will disappear
When you are gone
All the terror in my world will end
When I'm the saviour!

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus]
