[Verse 1]
I run trough the mist of the void
I am hunted by fear, my soul is repressed
And my heart is a statue of stone
Eos is dead and gone, there's shadow ahead
Thin threads of hope is all, a faint trace of live
Until she's found I won't give up, I won't give in!

[Chorus]
I am searching recklessly through pain and misery
The tides will turn for me, it's my destiny!

[Verse 2]
By the river of Styx, through the echoes of death
I am guided by harmonies, remnants of song
Beats of a lonely heart is leading the way
Silence is broken in the halls of the dead
Until she's found I won't give up, I'll carry on!

[Chorus]

Chaos calling me...

Until she's found I won't give up
I'll carry on!

[Chorus]
