When I'm down and out without the strength to carry on
The sun still reaches your hair as it's always done
Will I ever see you again, just one last time?
Anyhow I cannot feel any peace of mind

All around the world the fallen ones will see
That love was never ever meant for me
I?m torn apart but how could I flee?
I would die for you, so please come rescue me

'Cause I wonder where you are
Have our freedom gone too far?
Is there still an open door?
I will love you forever ever more

I realize that life is never easy
But in my heart, I'd hoped for something greater
A dream I guess, but something to hold on to
A rainbow on a darkening, rainy sky

'Cause my body's caught, but still my soul is out there
They can take away my life, but not my freedom
My love is all that matters, you'll see
I would die for you, so please come rescue me

'Cause I wonder where you are
Have our freedom gone too far?
Is there still an open door?
I will love you forever ever more

When I'm down and out without the strength to carry on
The sun still reaches your hair as it's always done
Will I ever see you again, just one last time?
Anyhow I cannot feel any peace of mind

'Cause I wonder where you are
Have our freedom gone too far?
Is there still an open door?
I will love you forever ever more
