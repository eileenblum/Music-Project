I have never been so worried as I am today
I'm thinking of the way we're movin? closer to the end

There?s no turning back this time
How can we survive a crime like this?
Cause there will be nothing left
If we don't realize that soon will everything be too late

What are we heading for?
It's so hard to realize
If we don't open up our eyes
Cause it will be far too late
When our progress has ended it all

Rise up people, gather all, together we are strong!
We?re not gonna sit in silence when hell is breakin? loose

There?s no turning back this time
How can we survive a crime like this?
Cause there will be nothing left
If we don't realize that soon will everything be too late

What are we heading for?
It's so hard to realize
If we don't open up our eyes
Cause it will be far too late
When our progress has ended it all
