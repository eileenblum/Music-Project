Never thought I'd be caught in the web
Like a lamb lying down to be slaughtered
Put down your walls for a minute
I want to let you know what is on my mind

I am trying to find the words
To reveal the scenery
I was never enough for you
And it splits my soul in two
Every time you go

My heart is crying
Every time you walk away I'm dying
I know I have to be strong and fight it
But when you look at me I fail to hide it
I can't let you go
I just want you to know
I'm like a leaf that keeps on falling.

Never thought I'd be lost on my own
Never dreamed I would suffer such pain
Now put down your walls for a minute
We have to work this out, doesn't matter how

I am trying to find the words
To reveal the scenery
I was never enough for you
And it splits my soul in two
Every time you go

My heart is crying
Every time you walk away I'm dying
I know I have to be strong and fight it
But when you look at me I fail to hide it
I can't let you go
I just want you to know
I'm like a leaf that keeps on falling.

Time will go on eventually
My heart will heal again
But you will forever be the one
The one that haunts my heart and soul
forever more

My heart is crying..........
