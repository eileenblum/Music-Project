A cold cunning razor smile
Is cutting through your spine
Words of evil, deeds of greed
Into the mouth of the nation he's sowing his seed

What's done can't come undone
But don't let us do it again
Have all we taught been so wrong
If not "Why are you singing this song"

Remember, a single spark can ignite the fire
Inside its womb you're his soul desire

The Bringer Of War

Like a phoenix he arose from the ashes
But did you ever see him come?
Eventhou his eyes are shining true
He's not the saviour for me, nor for you

What's that sound I'm hearing?
Hasn't he been here once before?
A malefactor, promissing to take down the sun
It seems like our past has come undone

Remember, a single spark can ignite the fire
Inside its womb you're his sole desire

The Bringer Of War
