Luther King, Theresia and Mandela
All heros of the world
In a time known as the dark era
They fought and meant to be heard!

Dedicated, filled with spirit
Truthfully they followed their harts
They had a dream that they would die for
It's time to gather us all!

Keep on walk and march for freedom
All over lands and seas
Keep on walk and march for freedom
Mankind is set to be free!

Light the torch, step out of the darkness
Feel the wind of change
On the path to freedom and glory
There's only one way to be free!

Keep on walk and march for freedom
All over lands and seas
Keep on walk and march for freedom
Mankind is set to be free!
