I'm standing here facing a city in silence
Forces of nature have taken control
Streets layin? empty hand houses are fallin?
They had to flee for their lives

Where does it come from and who can create
The power that keeps people trapped in their hate?
One lonely madman or beasts of mankind
Watch out so they?ll never get to your mind!

They came unexpected with evil intensions
They came to loot, to divide and destroy
Faces were frozen in pain, tears were fallin?
From innocent children's eyes

Where does it come from and who can create
The power that keeps people trapped in their hate?
I just don't get it, I can't understand
Why things can't be solved here in paradise land?

Man, woman, children everyone
Were thrown out of their homes
And forced to become refuges
With nothing they could call their home

Sparkling beaches once full of life
are laying desolate
They had there dreams and future hopes
Until it all were whipped away

Where does it come from and who can create
The power that keeps people trapped in their hate?
One lonely madman or beasts of mankind
Watch out so they never get to your mind!

Where does it come from and who can create
The power that keeps people trapped in their hate?
I just don't get it, I can't understand
Why things can't be solved here in paradise land?
