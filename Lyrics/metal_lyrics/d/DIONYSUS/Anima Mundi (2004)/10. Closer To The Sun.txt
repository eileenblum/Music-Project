Fly with me, fly forever closer to the sun

Too many ways to be the fool?
Too many lies to see the truth?
Become the one you'd never be?
Go back find yourself deep inside,
I'm telling you to

Fly with me, fly together
Until the end of time
Fly with me, fly forever closer to the sun

Still having dreams and future hopes?
You tried your best, you did not flee?
Life's still just one big mystery?
Follow your path, stick to your dreams
they're telling you to

Fly with me, fly together
Until the end of time
Fly with me, fly forever closer to the sun
I wonder if you dare
or have the power and the will?

Come - fly with me, fly together
Until the end of time
Fly with me, fly forever closer to the sun
I wonder if you dare
or have the power and the will?
