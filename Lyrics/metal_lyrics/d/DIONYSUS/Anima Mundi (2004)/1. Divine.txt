From the remnants of myth I come
A mythago alive once again
I was born from the mists of time
From the legends that whisper my name

I'm the dream of a thousand minds
Come to set things right
And by my honour I hereby swear
Love will conquer all

It's my gift to replenish life
Can you feel the surge of vitality?
If you join me and heed my call
Together we'll redraw reality

I'm the wish of a thousand hearts
A wish to set things right
And by my honour I hereby swear
Love will conquer all

'Cause I am the maker of miracles
Chaos awake in my hand
I am your fate
I am darkness and light
In my heart and in my soul I'm divine

'Cause I am the maker of miracles
Chaos awake in my hand
I am your fate
I am darkness and light
In my heart and in my soul I'm divine
