Herald fascination,
Genesis of fear
Born into servitude,
Weep virgin tears

Immolate humanity
To kill time
...while on the path to death
Disciplined divine

Bury your faith,
In the groin of god
Amen &amp; out

Butchering pure instinct,
Abstinent servitude
One god one master,
You're born to lose

Drink the blood, eat the flesh,
Suckle on his waste
Buried faith, groin of god
He's filth, you're prey to taste

Amen &amp; out
