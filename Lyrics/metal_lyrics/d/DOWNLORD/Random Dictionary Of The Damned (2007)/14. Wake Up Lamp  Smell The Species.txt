Human motivation
Pain and fear
The evolution nears
Mankind, an oversight
There's nothing kind about man
Will you not see the blight?

No subtlety
No shades of grey
Monochrome, to act or die
Breed the meek, enslaved

Leech sector

Ignore the parasites that perish
Do no resuscitate
Infectious, draining soul
Born of one black whole

The invisible war

Euphoria
A belt-fed weapon
Catalyst to guide
Wake up and smell the species
Diabolically they lied

"Once there was a need for simple minds
Once there was a need to save men's souls
Fools had to be forced to stay in line
Preachers and bibles could serve those goals
With their holy writ and their cardinal sin
They could force the paper demons in...
With our morning star from the deepest night
Smash the crumbling cross.... for might is right!"

Aggrandize

Locking on - bloodied lies mark the tracks
Wake up and smell the species
There'll be no going back!

"Set the shuffling zombies grope for light
...And we'll reign forever more!"
