Sleep forever, lifeline sever
Hold on life release
As you slip into eternal peace
No, everything won't be alright
In fact expect the worst
Shadows dominate as light
Fades into eternal night

Sleep forever, awaken never
Dregs of flesh remain
Ashes dispersing in the rain
Ride the burn and leave this world
None awake to weep
Passage borne on light's decay
Nocturnally I'm drawn away

Pain and misery, world forsaken
Overdriven and undertaken
Less than thrilled with the time I've killed
Stopped dreaming long ago

All my cares behind me
All my problems solved
And now unto oblivion
I am resolved

Hollow winds of time blow through me
Lips be still, I keep the word
Bearing silent witness to their mutterings
Under cold, cold ground
Freed of those that thought they knew me
That never, said the things I'd heard

Pain and misery, world forsaken
Overdriven and undertaken
Less than thrilled with the time I've killed
Stopped dreaming long ago
So now I'll sleep...
Forever
