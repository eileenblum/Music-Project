Man with reasoning
The animal distinct
Fragmented drama
Indoctrinated lies real sin

A paradox
How mankind hates
Forbidden known
Yet proceates

Turn on, tune in, drop dead
Demons amongst angels

Natural factors
Are no compulsions
Awareness of flesh stimulus
Without repulsion

Condemnation of instinct
Guilty of all seven sins
Emancipate and gratify
Indulge your desire

Indulgence of desire
Turning on...
Tuning in...
Dropping dead...
