Greed, the great seducer
Opulence reconciles
Old world chaos, mass revulsion
Wallowing in human bile
Bacterial beginnings,
Wiped out
The parasite, man
Extinct

Old world chaos [x3]

New world disorder
To a lifeless husk
Contradiction disciplines
A planet scarred by way and lust

Old world chaos [x2]
