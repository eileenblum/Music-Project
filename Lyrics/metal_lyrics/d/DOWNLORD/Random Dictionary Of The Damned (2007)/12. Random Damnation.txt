Decreated
The phase deleted
A chapter ends
Commence to the next stage

Core of existence
A dark persistence
In solitude to fester
Greys unrest
Garish spectres rise
Rapid machination
Chaos
Random damnation

Reality in art
Or persecution fear
Out there lies the truth in lies
Intervention nears

Vacant minds, in neglect
Derelict, untold regret
Through their teeth they're lying
Are our waning spirits dying?

Stranger than fiction
A ritual invoked
Covert and ignorant
On falsehoods even fort would choke

Desecration
Self-mutilation
Our alienation
Random damnation
