Deception
Life's naught but a dream to some
Nightmare to others
All is not as it seems
Everything's as certain, sacred
Forever as desired to be
Or is it?

Sleight of hand
Out of sight, out of mind
Comic yet tragic
Like movie magic
The image that pleases
Stranger than fiction
Our plastic addiction
Enhancements
Distort the naked truth
Made up to appeal to mindless eyes
Who walk over skulls
To buy the lies

Mind over matter
All this can be yours
Including the blame

Sleight of hand
Out of sight, out of mind
Comic yet tragic
Like movie magic
No image displeases

Believer
On the wings of a dream
While silently sleeping
Like a brain in a jar
On a shelf
In a lab
Silently, your secret we're keeping
