Kept waiting, anticipating
By midnight oil, we built the beast
Underdriven, overloaded
Now upon you, carelessly released
Excessive!

Time &amp; money, ups &amp; downs
Blood &amp; sweat in rivers of tears
False starts, with broken worlds
Indifference dragged out for years
Self-serving, unrelenting, undeserving, condescending
...This time I come to take &amp; not to give
Now it's the time... here's the place

All debts to be surrendered, all sinners now come clean
A devastating call to action... it's payback time
For all the knives in all our backs
Collateral pain
Is life not hard enough already?
It's payback time!

All expectations you evade
Broken promises once made
Doesn't matter how you plead
After you have done he deed
In times confronted with all lies
The ones you thought the world would buy

Self-serving, unrelenting, undeserving, condescending
...This time I come to take and not to give
