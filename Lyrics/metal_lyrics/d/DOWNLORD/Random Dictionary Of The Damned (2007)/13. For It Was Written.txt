Sense mandates to not believe
Written words and force fed creeds

Recognition, manifestation
See beyond mass hallucination
Those declaring we are free
Hysteria in prophecies

Rewriting history
Re-fabricate mythology

Solicitous lies as your receipt
Redeemed in afterlife replete

Do not repeat to forge at last
Mistakes throughout our lurid past
Read between as lies accrue
For it was written no longer true

For it was written...
But no longer true...
No longer true
