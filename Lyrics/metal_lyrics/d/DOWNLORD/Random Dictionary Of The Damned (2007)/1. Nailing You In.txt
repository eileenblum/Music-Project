Suffocation
Once the lid slams down
From dormant you awaken
In terrors wave I hear you drown

Fingers scrape the casket lid
Skin to bone now shred
Screaming agonies ignored
To me you are already dead
So I'm nailing you in

I purge you of your life
Humiliate the flesh
To nail you in, sadistic act
Naught remains but to burn the evidence cremate

Pyre-o-mania, my savior
Arising flames, embracing you

I'm nailing you in
Nailing you in!
