Sudden impulse, neural glitch
The urge to strike out,
Cause life's a bitch
Beyond contempt
Raised by you alone
Demanding vindication
Your not hard to loathe
Acidic resentment
No time to mourn
My raped incisors
Drip venom and scorn

Final judgement
On you and your kind
Revealing motives
A sight to the blind

Aggressive tactics
So grotesque
Wretched inner circle
I detest

Loath scorn detest
