My world explodes
Another war to rage
How grim the future looks
No submission, anger reigns

The bile pours forth
Torrents through my head
Quest for life deposed
I lusted death instead
Miserable planet
Anger breeding - hate brace

Bile purge - purge love
Love hate - hate brace
The past unchained, the future is bleak

Mental timebomb ticks away
Detonation hateful day
I can't keep this rage at bay

Bile/purge/love/hate/brace
