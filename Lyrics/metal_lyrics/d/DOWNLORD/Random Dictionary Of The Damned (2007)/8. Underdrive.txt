Gravity beckons and pull us under
Everything in time will answer the call
All hopes and dreams to be taken under
Pointless resisting, just let go and fall
Slip away from the world that held you
Beneath all contempt in this lowest esteem
Start a new system of beliefs and values
Based on reality... just as it seems
Lest one succumbs to the underdrive

Creatures of habit
People in pain
Look up from your troubles
And think again
What are you doing?
Where will you be?
At the end of your life
When it's all history
Did you do it for money
For material gain
Burn all that time
And endure all that pain

Would you do it again
All you've been through
Or rather retake control
Of the real you

Gravity beckons and pull us under
Everything in time will answer the call
All hopes and dreams to be taken under
Pointless resisting, just let go and fall
Now as one with the underdrive

Slip away from the world that held you
Beneath all contempt in the lowest esteem

Against the grain
Alone in the crowd
Rise from the ranks of the damned
Til you're proud
