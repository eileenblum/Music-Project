I want to be somewhere worth waking up,
with someone who thinks that I am enough
And I donât want to have to want anymore,
But Iâd give anything to feel something once more.

Iâm sick of waking up,
with no direction and no hope of me giving a fuck.
Jesus Christ, Iâd give anything to feel anything.

The mirror laughs at me.
One face, one thousand pieces,
All self-loathing and all of us defeated.
We all smile, but none of us mean it.
Itâs in style to keep it a secret.

So show your teeth
And laugh from deep down in your bones.
But your just like me,
Youâre only happy when youâre alone.

Someone says:
Tell those mother fuckers nothing,
Theyâll think everything is fine until you tell them something.
Who you are is only what you have.
If you take off the mask,
Theyâll all turn their backs
And no one wants to be friends with the freak who has no feelings,
Well all my pieces share the same secrets
And no one knows
That none of us are livingâ¦

somewhere worth waking up,
with someone who thinks that I am enough
And I donât want to have to want anymore,
But Iâd give anything to feel something once more.

Iâm sick of waking up,
with no direction and no hope of me giving a fuck.
Jesus Christ, Iâd give anything to feel anything.

So show your teeth
And laugh from deep down in your bones.
But your just like me,
Youâre only happy when youâre alone.

I donât want to have to want anymore,
But Iâd give anything to feel anything.

I donât want to have to want anymore,
God knows Iâd give anything to feel anything.
