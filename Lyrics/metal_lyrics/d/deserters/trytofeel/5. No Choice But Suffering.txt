Introducing hate, 
my only gift to you that won't fade.
First, everything will seem the same.
Until everything in your life is consumed by my precious eternal black flame chars everything in it's way.
No need to give it a name.
Just know that it will keep you warm if sparked with someone else's pain.
Just let it out...
All I've got are scars
reminding me of everything I'm not,
And I wish all my flaws upon my fellow man, because they thought
their destiny would be more than just to rot.
So, take this flame to light your way
and you will finally understand,
that: Who I am is
all that you could ever hope to be.
GOD ALWAYS FAILS
and life burns down your family trees.
Seasons will change and the wounds become scars,
Now the world sees us as strange because we hate?
And you'll learn to care so much
About how you just don't care at all.
And we can smile knowing that we all return to dust,
And that one day, the sky will fall.
And when it meets me,
Will it judge me for my fashion
Or will it care if I lived my life with any kind of passion,
If I kill or if I stole
Or if I ever tried at all?
No, nothing matters
To this empty God
That we have all been after
Now the hate is going to kill me from the inside out.
Feel the flames forge my hopes into doubts.
We burn to breathe.
We chose suffering,
We're born to be
Miserable.
Hate is going to kill me from the inside out.
