I have
Finally come to terms with who I am
and that I could never love the world that's in my hands.
In my head,
There's only me
Who I let die
And who I let breathe.

GOD FEELS NOTHING.

To every guilty soul I say:
You didn't believe in me,
But I saw every twisted fucking face that you ever made.

GOD FEELS NOTHING.

So the gun in your mouth had your hand on it?
Well tell me who's sin is worse,
If God's the one who planned it,
If God invented your fucking curse.

GOD FEELS NOTHING.

In my head, there's only me
Who I let die and who I let breathe,
Who I let burn and who I let believe.

I designed your hearts to break.
I designed your faith to shake.
Vices and virtues are both creatures that I named.
If you sing my name,
You will surely be saved,
But you'll still feel the pain.
NOW WHO STILL WANTS TO BE SAVED?

GOD FEELS NOTHING.

GOD...
I WAS GOD.
NOW, I JUST WANT TO BE GONE.

In my head,
It's only getting worse.
I've lost a balance between who is loved and who's cursed.
And the truth about me is,
I hate all of my pieces.

I have
Come to terms with
With who I am,
And I have sinned...
I have sinned...
I have sinned...
I have sinned more than any man.

GOD FEELS NOTHING.

Life's between your legs and death is in your hands.

GOD FEELS NOTHING.

Knowing when it's my time to leave is all that makes me a man.

GOD FEELS NOTHING.
