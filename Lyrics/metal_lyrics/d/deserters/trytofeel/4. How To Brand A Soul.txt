I fight. I quarrel with my conscience.
It's a sight for all to see.
I try / I try my best to be honest,
Without saying what I really mean.
I pry. I break into your feelings
And learn just what makes you scream.
So cry, that's when I sneak in
and carve my name into every dream.
You can't escape.
It's nothing that you did
That made me want to watch you break.
I only crushed your heart
To see if I could feel the ache.
I've rehearsed these words a thousand times, before they got to you.
You're just a victim of my selfish self-abuse.
So, watch the fool.
Watch him try to feel.
We both know only the pain is real.
And now you wonder...
What any of this bullshit really means.
Is it only thunder?
Sounds from a storm that I never wanted you to see?
And now you wonder...
Was it part of the plan for you to hear me scream?
You're buried under
Kindling made from counterfeit hopes and dreams.
I'll watch you burn.
