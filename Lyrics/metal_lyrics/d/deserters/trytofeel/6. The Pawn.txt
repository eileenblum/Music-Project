I've played this game before.
With eyes closed, I still see the board.
I've used a million pieces just like you.
Yeah, I know all of your moves.
So, all I wonder
is who you put your trust into.
Is it the king that stands behind you
or the hand that guides you?
Now, what are you fighting for
and do you think that you'll ever be more
than just a pawn in my game?
Trade your shape and trade your name,
but I'll treat you all the same.
Two steps forward must feel like progress.
But, your heart is mine
I'll possess your mind
and I have planned every move for you
If you only knew all the things I'd put you through,
would you have trusted my hands
and let them promise you the promised land?
If you only knew...
If you only knew all the things I'd do to you,
would have trusted my hands
knowing that your heart was just...
part of my plan.
You were just
part of my plan.
If you only knew.
If you only knew...
I lie just to see the hope in your eyes die
and look a little bit more like mine.
Tell the world how hard you tried,
with all the tears you tried to hide.
Would things be any different if you knew
that you were always being used?
If only you knew.
