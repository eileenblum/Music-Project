How much longer will you wait? You waited so long and you listened so
well, but it was all a lie and you could never tell. So, forgive me for
every look that passed right through you and every single glance that
reassured you none of it was true. But, look at what words can do: I still
fucking used you. Dear left behind, I know I threw you out. Because, I
knew in time that your faith in me would turn to doubt and Iâm sorryâ¦ that
Iâm not sorry. The worst part is I only feel bad for myself. Now, all that
we see, when the snow has melted, is the trash we threw out before the
winter came. You may linger in the warmth of the seasonâs sun, with
fingers crossed, that it will grant you new life, but we all know that
youâre dead inside.

Dear left behind, Iâm sorry.
