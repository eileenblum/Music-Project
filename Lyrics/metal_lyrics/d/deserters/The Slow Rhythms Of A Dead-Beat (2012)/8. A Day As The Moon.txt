Suddenly, I am awake. I see the earth from outer space. I feel the warmth
of the sunâs rays, but he never sees my face. This is a dream Iâm sure,
but I can see the world and as long as Iâm asleep, I feel as if I can
almost reach. I can almost feel your touch. Hope is such a rush, but I
canât conjure love. Even in dreams, Iâm just not enough. The endless cycle
of hoping that Iâll wake up, just to go about my day in the fucking hole
that I create, in hopes that tonight I dream and that just for once it
grants me peaceâ¦ please. I am the moon, so cold and blue, so many holes in
me from you. Did you take a piece of me? I feel so fucking empty. Cold as
ice, but Iâm not melting. I feel the light, but itâs not fucking helping
now. Please God, just wake me up. Iâd rather suffer through reality than
curse the day for what I see in my dreams.

How could he ever feel the same, when he doesnât know my name?
