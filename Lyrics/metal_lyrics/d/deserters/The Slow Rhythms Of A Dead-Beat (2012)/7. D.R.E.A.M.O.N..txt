Sometimes, I dream that I am Godâ¦ I stop the human race, before it starts.
But, then I wake up and weâre still here. Suicide to conquer fears.
Because, opportunity ends when I wake up. I pray for sleep to a God that
doesnât give a fuck. Grinding my teeth all day, Iâm screaming:

D.R.E.A.M.O.N.

Iâm pleading for temporary escape. Donât let tomorrow be haunted by today.
Another chance, but no chance for change.

Destined to Regret Everyday Alone. Marry Only Negativity.
