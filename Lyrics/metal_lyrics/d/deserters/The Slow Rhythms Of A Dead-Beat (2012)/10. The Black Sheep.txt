I carried on, but the 9 to 5 just didnât seem right. I donât belong, this
is the black sheepâs code. So, go ahead and sell me the road. Iâm taking
off. I get high and lower my expectations, because Iâm losing all and I
have no clear destination. But, death is certainâ¦ if I stay or if I go.
What fools will follow from the cliffs to the undertow? All along, you
knew that I would never make it. My higher power has six chambers and a
hammer, and my darkest hour was on the day that I was born. Grow up. Break
down. Give in. Sell out. Mother, are you proud of me now? It took so many
years to realize that nothing fucking matters. If you looked into these
eyes, all youâd see is scorn. I grew up and my faith just slowly faded. I
broke down and I spit at my creator. I gave in and indulged in a life of
sin.

I sold out, because I knew I couldnât fucking win.
