Here it goes again, time to fake a smile. Life has been this way for quite
a while. I fucked it up all by myself. I couldnât bear to ask for help.
Now, thereâs nothing fueling all the hate inside, itâs just another day
without my child. I abandoned hearts. I abandoned homes. I did this all on
my own. Here it goes again, pretend that itâs all fine. Hateâs all Iâve
got, but at least itâs mine. I fucked it up all by myself. I left love
behind all on my own. So, bear witness to weakness, heâs staring right at
you. Itâs taken this long just to tell you the truth. Youâre looking right
back, but thereâs nothing to see. I hope when you grow up, youâre nothing
like me. And the worst of timesâ¦ they last forever.

Just like the hands on a broken clock, time just seems to have stopped and
yours will never rest on mine again. The slow rhythms of a dead-beat.

DEAD-BEAT.
