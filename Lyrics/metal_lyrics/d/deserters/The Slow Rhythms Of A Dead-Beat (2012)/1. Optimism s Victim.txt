Holding on, with nothing but dark days around you. Just can't shake that
sinking feeling. Moving on, you're left behind and still breathing. Hope
runs thin and your wounds aren't healing. Lost in this hole of mine, but
I'm trapped in this mind all the time. Dark denies you chance of survival.

Now, all that's left to do is suffer. Just suffer. Cold takes no
prisoners. You know, but you're trudging on. Hope that you won't be
another stepping stone. Keep moving on. Noone makes it out of this place
alive. In the dark, I force myself on your mind. Open up and let hate come
inside. Now, look back with me at all the faces that I've stepped on, just
to make it this far and not feel a fucking thing. I told you the truth. I
told you this is what I'd do: fake love, so that I could step on you too.

Hope's gone. Keep moving on.
