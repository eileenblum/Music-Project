It just never ends. Lied to another friend. Missed another call. The
lights and the phone turned off. Keep it all to myself and lie when Iâm
asked if I need help. I smile so you canât tell. Now, I scream the things
I could never say. Naked and alone, cling to the memories that I made. And
you dream, because you no longer pray. The smile on my face, is a mask
engraved with your name. Already broken, but still pretend I can bend.
Selfishness determines who I still call a friend. Living in my own hell.
The lies have built me a cell. How long itâs been, I honestly could not
tell. Itâs time to go home and you still donât know how I really feel or
what it is that you did wrong.

So I scream the things I could never say.

Naked and alone, cling to the memories that I made.

And you dream, because you no longer pray.

The smile on my face was a mask engraved with your name.
