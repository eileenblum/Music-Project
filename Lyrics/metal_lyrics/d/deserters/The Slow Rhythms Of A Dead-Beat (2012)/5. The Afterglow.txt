You know that youâre just a product of the afterglow. Itâs the same every
time. I look to you, when things arenât right. You said youâd save me, but
you wonât catch me praying. I scoff at souls on bended knees, like theyâre
all so fucking weak. Take the coppers from my eyes and leave me, staring
at the sky. With hands outstretched, I hope for nothing less, but I see
every breath and I know that every prayer is wasted on a name thatâs
faceless. Dear God, Iâve been waiting for so long, but I just couldnât
wait another day to see your faceâ¦ so perfect, so nothing and so nowhere
to be fucking found. As far as I can see, heâs nowhere to be found. Iâve
looked everywhereâ¦ whoâs the king of this God forsaken town? The name
thatâs faceless wears the crown. Permanent resident of this ghost town. No
days to count since Iâve ceased to exist. Iâve been let down. Let down my
hands outstretched. I hopedâ¦ I sawâ¦ I knowâ¦ every prayer is wasted on a
name thatâs faceless. The faceless king will save you a seat, right in
front, beneath the weight of his feet. But, will the faceless king be
watching me fall from heaven to concrete? With hands outstretchedâ¦

we hope.. we see.. we know.. every prayer is wasted on a name thatâs
faceless.

You knowâ¦ youâre just a product of the afterglow.
