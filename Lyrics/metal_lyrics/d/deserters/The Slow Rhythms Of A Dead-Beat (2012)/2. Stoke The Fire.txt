Why do I do this to myself? I leech off the dreams of someone else.
Wanting to be part of your perfect lives, just so I can feel âalive.â And
itâs killing you inside, just to keep up the fight. You took a shot in the
dark and I canât see the light. I donât need another excuse, to hate all
the things I do. I told you I could help, then dragged you to my private
hellâ¦ with your hopes and desires in tow. Stoke the fire, so I wonât be
cold. This place is never-ending. Soon youâll learn to call it home. Stoke
the fire, so I wonât be cold. Stoke the fireâ¦ burn it all. Soon, there
will be nothing more than lies left. You smile, just to pretend you donât
share a bed with death. But, I am holding you close and you know, it feels
so good for anyone to want you in this hole. And itâs killing you inside.
Youâre no longer able to hope for flight. You took a shot in the dark and
now you canât see the light. Why do I do this to myself? I leech off the
dreams of someone else.

You know as well as I, that itâs killing you inside.
