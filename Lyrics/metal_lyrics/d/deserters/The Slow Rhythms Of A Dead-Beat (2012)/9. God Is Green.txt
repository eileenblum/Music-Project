Both our gods are green. Iâm just a product of the whiskey and the weed.
Weâre all some kind of fiend and youâre just a product of the hustle and
the greed. Behind your suit, youâre just another junkie. Disapproval when
you pass me by, but weâre all looking for the same thingâ¦ what gets us by,
with another day of our wasted lives. Itâs the cash and the clothes. Weâve
indebted our souls. Youâve got bills, but the brands. Iâve got pills in my
hands. I buy smoke just to breathe. Now, maybe you will see, weâre not so
different you and me, hoping our drugs will set us free. Itâs just what
gets us by. Work for the weekend. I canât comprehend, because I know. I
saw the afterglow. Maybe Iâm jaded? The drugs have aided in feeling like I
know for sure, that your god wonât show. So, in the meantime, weâve both
got to find what gets us by. We just want to end the suffering, no matter
what the price.

Buy some kind of freedom with lies.
