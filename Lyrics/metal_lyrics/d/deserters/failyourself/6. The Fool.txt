Forget about me
Just do your best
to forget about
me.

OPEN YOUR EYES
I see you,
but you can't see,
my hands around your throat from the back seat.
YOUR HEART BEATS
to the rhythm of the engine sputtering
it's running on empty.

And you've driven to far
to make it home now
isn't it  so bizarre
that the person who made you can so easily break you
and no one can fucking save you.

You're broken
and you're hoping

but no one
can save you.
"I'm here 'cause I need you back.."
HA HA You fucking wish.
You fell for
all my bullshit
"Oh please just one more chance.."
HA HA You stupid bitch.

HA HA

You can't break the cycle that binds you,
so take my hands I'm right here behind you
NOW.

Take my hands,
SQUEEZE
with me.

Take my hands
and bleed
with me.

Forget about me
Just do your best,
to forget about
me.

And every time I laughed
I laughed at you
You gave me your heart
Yeah, you fucking fool.

Everything I ever said,
it meant nothing
Took everything you had to give
and gave nothing.

You took a chance on me
You took a chance on you
and you
FAILED YOURSELF
