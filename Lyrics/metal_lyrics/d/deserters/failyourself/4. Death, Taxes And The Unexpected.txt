Oh God,
they've spilled AIDS
and cleaned it up with cancer
Spread disease
in the shadow
of the new high score.

Usher in the new plague,
with a face that we can trust.

Attracted,
to the scent
of someone doing worse than us

Distracted,
we keep
spinning
the wheel

Driven into our holding cell
6x6, fluorescent lights and no sign
of your
self-
worth

Because if we fail,
these unforgiving streets won't feed the homeless
(we're hopeless)

So riot,
a prison cell is your meal ticket
Take it
The best you'll ever get
is a life of constant disappointment
So fight it

Success is a bold faced fucking lie,
the only guarantee is that I'll die
We see the hook
but still we bite it

So sign your life away
or lock it up
Either way,
a constant struggle awaits you

Because God knows:
We don't drive the roads we paved with gold,
we were only hired
to polish them

And my American dream was just a
nightmare

In god we trust but he is just a
stranger

So what's one more straw on an already
broken back

When death taxes and the unexpected are
all I have.
