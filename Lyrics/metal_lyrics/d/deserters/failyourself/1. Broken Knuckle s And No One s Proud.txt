YOU FAILED YOURSELF
I spit in every mouth that offered help.
WE ALL LOST OUT
Ive broken both my hands just beating myself.
EVERYDAY
Another mountain blocks the sun from my eyes.
I CANT SEE
A reason to keep up this joke of a life.

FUCK YOU,
look me in the fucking eyes
I refuse
to be beaten by myself
So Alone,
I don't believe my own lies
I'd smash you
reflections gone, but I can only

SEE
HATE
CLEARER

than it's ever been before.
lost every battle to end the war.

broken knuckles and no one's proud
shattered glass
shattered glass and no one's proud.
