SAVE ME FROM MYSELF

I've been chasing something everyday
and running from what I hate
I'm going in circles
I know that I have been here before

Learn from it or repeat
destiny brings me to my knees
But I'll write my own history
even if it's just for:

The sake of saving face
with my own conscience
But I know better,
some sins just can't be justified
Well at least I tried

Reborn,
I'll never be adored
who could ever love a monster
who's convinced that he's a saint

The hunter and the hunted
share so many traits
Caught at the water's edge
I'm looking back
looking back
looking back at my own face

and I'd drown myself
to save myself
from me

Drowning myself just to save myself

DROWN MYSELF TO SAVE MYSELF

I've been chasing something everyday
and running from what i hate
I'm going in circles
I know that I have been here before

Learn from it or repeat
destiny brings me to my knees
But I'll write my own history
even if it's just for:

The sake of saving face
with my own monsters
But I know better
some sins just can't be justified
well at least I tried

Reborn,
my inner war
Who could ever love a monster
who's convinced that he's a saint

DROWN
(DROWN)
