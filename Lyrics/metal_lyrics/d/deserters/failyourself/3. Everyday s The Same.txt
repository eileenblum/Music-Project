I'd rather travel all nine circles of hell,
without a paddle at the bottom of this well,
than drive the round-abouts of the cities we lived in
built by the optimistic hands of children turned villians

I don't push just to feel you shove
I lost faith in love
If love is who you hate the least
I know just what you mean to me

you think you know?
you think you've got it all figured out?
well i'll tell you what I know...

All I know
I know that I hate you
I  know that I hate you
I  know that I fucking hate you
All I know
Everyday's the same

I don't push just to feel you shove
I lost faith in love
If love is who you hate the least
I know just what you mean to me

Forget everything I said
I never meant it at all
Our love never left the bed
You whore stay down on your knees and crawl

Forget everything I said
I never meant it at all
Our love never left the bed
Live life on your knees and fucking crawl

Crawl to the life you remember
Crawl towards the dreams that we had
Crawl
CRAWL
