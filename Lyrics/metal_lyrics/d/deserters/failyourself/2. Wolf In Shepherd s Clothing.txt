Thank you for validating my meaningless existence,
because now I don't feel so fucking bad.
You gave me everything I ever wanted,
just to take it all.. to take it all back.

You're just a fucking bitch.

Take from me my blood,
drink from the cup,
a crimson taste of failure,
of all the lies you've told.

You swore, you swore, you swore you would always be here.
But look around, I am, oh God,
I am..
I am..
I am alone.

I am your wayward soul.
If it's all about control, just let me burn,
I'll never fucking learn.
I'll never fucking learn.

Behold the new day, the sun shines on a world of shit.
Forsaken
everything and everyone in it.

I bet he smiled when he pissed on all the hopes and dreams I never had..
I never fucking had.

Take from me my blood, drink from the cup,
a crimson taste of failure, of all the lies you've told.
You swore, you swore, you swore you would always be here.
But look around,
I am alone.

We will never learn to love a God who's presence
is defined by his absence.

We will never learn.
How fucking stupid do you think we are?
We will never learn.
