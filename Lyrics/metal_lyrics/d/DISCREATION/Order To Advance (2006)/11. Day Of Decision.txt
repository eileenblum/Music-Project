[Lyrics and music by Discreation]

With the dawn of a new day
The time for battle comes
Many of those who stand
beside me won't return

Still in our hearts there is no fear
It's our date with time
We'll battle like men with
Pride, no complain in mind

Our enemies will die a cruel death
We march under the banner of victory
And execute everyone
Who stands in our way

The day of decision
It brings death to those
Who raised their weapons
Against the fist of death

No matter who you are
You won't survive this day
With deadly weapons
You get what you deserve

We're coming straight from hell
Devil himself is our leader
There is no soul or heart
Who could stop this bloodbath

Your body will rot in this godless earth
Nobody knows your grave is here
I'll forget your face
In the moment I leave you here

Cut your flesh in pieces
Send you to all the ones
Whose blood I shed before
No chance for you to escape

These are the last seconds
of your existence
If your wives are waiting
They do it in vain

Our enemies will die a cruel death
We march under the banner of victory
And execute everyone
Who stands in our way
