[Lyrics and music by Discreation]

Screams of wounded soldiers
Sound over the battlefield
Their flesh begins to rot
Right next to their enemies

The day of decision is over
In the darkness we die alone
And with the end of battle
My own existence ends

I've soaked the earth
With enemies blood
Fought brave and merciless
For the land I love

Blood streaming out of me
Still warm and alive
In the narrator's tale
I'll always live on

I can feel death getting near
Collecting souls of the fallen ones
It is the greatest honour
To die on a day like this
For all who stood by my side
This was their last breath, their last fight
