[Lyrics and music by Discreation]

You're marching behind enemy lines
To fulfill your promise that you made to an unknown force
In the faith of correct manner you risk your life
But no one cares if you fall in fight.

Wake up and see you're on a puppet string
Wake up and see think about your family

You rape, you kill in the name of your fatherland
You rape, you kill in the sign of liberty

Don't be another wasted life for greedy politicians
Cause they give a shit for your own needs
