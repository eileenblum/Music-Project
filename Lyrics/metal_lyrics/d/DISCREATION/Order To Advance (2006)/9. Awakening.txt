[Lyrics and music by Discreation]

I've slept for more than thousand years
In my grave six feet under the earth
But you didn't stop bleeding tears
So your hate had a revitalizing sound

The world has summoned a new decade
War and destruction my final plan was made
I infect your brain with blind hate and rage
With your own blood I write your final page

Don't get too close to my deadly flame
I've washed my hands in innocent blood
By the pass of time you will see
The cruelty of what war can be

I'm the hidden man behind your morality
I'm the god of war in your driving force
All I can bring you is sorrow and pain
All that was human inside of you is gone

And when the war is over and peace rises again
Silence might be loud as an exploding bomb
Cause in the nature of man lurks indeed
The unbroken will to kill
