[Lyrics and music by Discreation]

And when the thunder calls me
To arise from my grave
Aggression is the fluid running through my veins

For all the lonely years that I have wasted too long
The call of hatred made me to the man I now -- become

I can't deny the pain that I have felt before
Temptation was the key to open up my soul
Revenge is in my black mind that I can't control
So I'm lost in the vortex of hatreds -- call

As I see myself slowly fade away
To a darkened place that I can't explain

So you walk the path you chose
To free your lost soul
There is no way back so embrace my will

You demonic soul so tell me who you are
I can't struggle against your mighty breath

Since your birth -- I'm planted -- in your mind
I'm your dark side -- your living nightmare

I feel that I am gone
A living cover with a dying soul

So you belong to me forevermore
The call of hatred sets me free in you
