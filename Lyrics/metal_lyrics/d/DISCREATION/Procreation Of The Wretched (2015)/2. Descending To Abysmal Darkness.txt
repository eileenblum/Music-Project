[Music by Discreation]
[Lyrics by Sebastian Schilling]

Drawn away from the light
Descending to abysmal darkness

Bone shivering howling
The choir of the damned

Demons whisper
Lunatic mockery
Mazelike corridors
That lead into insanity

All is now
Now is evermore
In the ever burning fires of hell

Praise the incarcerated essence of the opposing principle
The accuser and the oppose embrace the total other

Realm of antimatter
Perpetual conversion
Into the very reverse
Never ending alteration
