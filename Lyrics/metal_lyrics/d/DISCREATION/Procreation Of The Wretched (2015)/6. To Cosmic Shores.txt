[Music by Discreation]
[Lyrics by Sebastian Schilling]

A giant effort
Never pursued before
Leaving behind
The age of strife

Unification if humanity
Visions greater than reality
Scientific progress driven
By the greatest minds

Rise to the stars
To rule the universe

Unite for this great cause
All men immortalityâs gain

Guided by the farsighted one
Uniting what belong together
A monolithic undertaking
To reclaim our birthright

Hostile alien races challenge
The very existence of mankind
We must have no mercy for the xenos

Led by the pure doctrine of scientific truth
Finally overcome
Superstition perilous
The age old scourge of humanity
Outlaw religion by decree

Wipe out
The corrupted scrap
That went astray in the old night
Bring back the loyal ones
That remained faithfully
