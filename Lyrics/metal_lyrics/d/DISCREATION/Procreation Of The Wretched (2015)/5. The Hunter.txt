[Music by Discreation]
[Lyrics by Dave HÃ¼bsch]

Two sides to every story
A shiny one and a dirty
Lovely nice on one side
Play my role as a pro
Keep my demons inside my shell
Only to let them free
For my blood thirst

If you would only know
Thereâs a killer inside me too
A parasite that comes alive
Following my instincts

Killing is a part of me
It fulfills the lust for death
This ritual should last forever
To release my pressure
Keep quiet most of the time
But when I become a hunter
I roar to satisfy my hunger
And hunt you down

If you are wondering
There is a reason
For my behavior
It comes from human nature
