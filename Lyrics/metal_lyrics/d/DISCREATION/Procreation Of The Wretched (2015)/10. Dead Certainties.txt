[Music by Discreation]
[Lyrics by Sebastian Schilling]

You wonât stem the tide
You are powerless against
The endless chain of events
Nothing ever stayed the same

You like to believe that
Morals deteriorate
Traditions lose their meanings
The old values are lost

You see signs of the times
Ever changing with disbelief
You see signs of the times
Ever changing

At the end of every day
One has to face new dead certainties

Youâre cursed to adopt
Or you are lost between dead certainties

Nothing really is as itâs always been
The wheel of time is ever turning

But you are bound to remain
In cessation
While history moves forward
Times waits for no slave
