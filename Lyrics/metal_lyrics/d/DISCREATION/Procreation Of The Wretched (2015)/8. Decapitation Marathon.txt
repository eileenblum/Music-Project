[Music by Discreation]
[Lyrics by Sebastian Schilling]

Overthrow of the leading class
For they have gone too far

Committing crimes against justice
And losing touch with reality
A world out of balance
Lost equilibrium

A pitiful congregation
Ascending the scaffold
To fall prey to the blade
Beheading apparatus

They were found guilty
Revolutionâs blood court
The sentence is excess and greed
The penalty is death

Decapitation marathon
The reign of terror revived
Decapitation marathon
Countless heads will roll

Executioners present
The torn off heads to the masses
Streams of blood that change the world
To start anew and fail again
