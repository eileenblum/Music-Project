[Music by Discreation]
[Lyrics by Sebastian Schilling]

Virus bombs
Sent to earth
Launched from battleships
Floating above the sky

In the cold eternity
Terrible order given
By the highest authorities

Obliteration of the worldâs entire population
For a level of corruption so monumental
It cannot be wiped out by any other means

Cadaveric fumes and biogas
A firestorm purifying the earth

Annihilation of the wicked
Complete discreation
For trespassing the laws of sanity

Life eater virus spreads
Destroying all organic structures
Reducing all planetary life
To organic sludge
