[Music by Discreation]
[Lyrics by Gretha Greuer]

Iâm the one who shaped your livings
Iâm the one who grants you joy
Iâm the one who tears you upright
Iâm the one who turns you down

You are not to question me
Iâm the one who is in charge
You wonât escape my despotism
Iâm the one whose pleasure counts

I am your good shelter
I am your helping signpost
You wonât go astray
As long as I donât show you
The wrong way

I support your belief in your free will
You think youâre acting on your own
The joy I allow you is no reward
Itâs just the leash I lead you on

Do no start thinking
Do no start asking
Just do as I tell you
And you will be well

If you question me
Your challenge me
There will be
Just one way
Chaos
