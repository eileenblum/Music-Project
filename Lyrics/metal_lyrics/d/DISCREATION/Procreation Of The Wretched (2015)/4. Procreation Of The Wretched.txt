[Music by Discreation]
[Lyrics by Sebastian Schilling]

Behold what you have brought into being
Behold what you call the will of your god

I look at your creation
With utter disgust
Blood on the sand
Under an indifferent sun

I look at your existence
With total contempt
Victim of false prophets
Simple views easy to fall for

Deprivation and torture
Rape and execution
Shoreless distress, amputation
The unbelievers fate

Your ideology â pitiful
Primitives of the lowest order

What you call a state
Nothing but a tragedy
Procreation of the wretched
Procreation of the wretched
