[Music by Discreation]
[Lyrics by Gretha Greuer]

Such an achievement
Our corporate hatred
Everything laid out
Simple, plain and clear

An order to follow
Structuring these
Intricate patterns
World we live in

No need to question the order
No need to think too intensely
Preconception, prejudice
Partially, jaundice, bias

If you insist on misdirecting
There is but one solution
You lose

No need to recognize you
No need to how your true name
As I was told to keep things apart

Quibblers and squealers
Fault-finders go away
You are not to disturb my views
