Listen to me children
For I speak the truth
I'll show you that there's no heaven
You will never burn in hell
No one will forgive your sins
No judgment day will ever come
Terror without end
Terror without end

You can't judge me
Your truth is your truth alone
I follow my own path
Don't tell me how to live my life
Wash your sins away
Wash your sins away
With blood

No voice, to hear
No signs, to see
No confession, to make
No rules, to break
No sins, to confess
No master, to serve
I won't bow down
The silence of the gods

Centuries of torment
And misleading lies
Bloodshed, rape and murder
Have always been the price
Burn these pages
That cost so many lives
Desecrate the altars
Praise everything profane

You can't judge me
Your truth is your truth alone
I follow my own path
Don't tell me how to live my life
Wash your sins away
Wash your sins away
With blood

No voice, to hear
No signs, to see
No confession, to make
No rules, to break
No sins, to confess
No master, to serve
I won't bow down
The silence of the gods

No voice, to hear
No signs, to see
No confession, to make
No rules, to break
No sins, to confess
No master, to serve
I won't bow down
The silence of the gods
