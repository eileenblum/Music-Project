I am the wasteland warlord
I am the outlaw king
I rule the killing fields
At night I haunt your dreams

I am the distant thunder
I am the lightning flash
I am your constant fear
I am the lurking shadow in your back

I reign supreme
Perpetual and merciless
I reign supreme
With hell at my command

You will be terrified
When the truth is revealed
For I possess the wisdom
To command the dead

Behold my undead legions
Of soulless monstrosities
Black hearts filled with hatred
Summon the fires of hell

We unleash the army of death
Blessed by ancient black gods
We harvest the souls of the pure
Spells of destruction and plague
Witness the end of time
These are the final days
