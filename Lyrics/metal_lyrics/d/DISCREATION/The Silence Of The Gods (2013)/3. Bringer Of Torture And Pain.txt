Like a switchblade
Slicing through the bodies of my victims
The first pain comes delayed
Itâs the last chance
To avoid the flush

My identity is well known
Different names for different time zones
All continents I call my home
I know all streets and every stone

I use all ways
To find your soul
I use all ways
To reach my goal

A murderer without a face
No eyes, no tongue to speak
A beast of prey
That carries the scent
I travel around the world
To bring you torture and pain

Navigation I donÂ´t need
It is my will that leads
DonÂ´t follow me
You canÂ´t catch me
Iâm running free
I need no passport to come to you
IÂ´m a stranger anywhere
Never welcome, but I donÂ´t care
DonÂ´t speak any tongue
That you could know

Like a switchblade
Slicing through the bodies of my victims
The first pain comes delayed
Itâs the last chance
To avoid the flush
I need no passport to come to you
DonÂ´t speak any language
That you could know
IÂ´m a stranger anywhere
Never welcome, but I donÂ´t care

I use all ways
To find your soul
I use all ways
To reach my goal
