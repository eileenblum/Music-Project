Below the blazing sun
We burn under blood red skies
We are doomed, we rot
Slowly fade away
Lost souls, no hope
Living in debris

Endless chambers
With shrines for the dead
Vast necropolis
Silence and bleak light
Worship the dead

Welcome to the tombworld
Where life drains
A planet of graves
Where necropriests preach
The cult of the dead

Praise the past
No future for mankind
Galleries of coffins
Standing side by side
Fade away
From the fields of despair

Endless chambers
With shrines for the dead
Vast necropolis
Silence and bleak light
Worship the dead

Below the blazing sun
We burn under blood red skies
We are doomed, we rot
Slowly fade away
Lost souls, no hope
Living in debris
Worship the dead
