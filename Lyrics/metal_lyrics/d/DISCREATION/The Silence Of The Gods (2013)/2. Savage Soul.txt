Blinded by the light we saw
The true insanity
We burned and killed their hope away
Long before they knew
Their judgment has been proved
Cut across the line
Seize the chance to reign

See this dying
In disgrace
Brave men die like flies
With this flesh
We cheated death
Kill with rage
Dying by the hands of fate
We took their flesh
We cheated death
Kill with rage
We send them to the worlds beyond

They like the bloodshed
Theyâll stop liking it at the end
When we finished them
Spread your boiling hate
First in the fray
Batter them to death
In this endless war

These burning holes within my savage soul
That wonât stop haunting me
Again and again I yell a battle cry
My troops right behind me

After storming the enemies lair
Weâll show no mercy
Bloodrain in the air
