Hunger leads us to the fireplace
No matter if sun or moon is shining
We are welcome as long as we pay
They put us on a diet every day

Do we get what we deserve
When did it start and who`s to blame
We swallowed every lie that was told
Drank the wine and fell asleep
Do we get what we deserve
When did it start and who`s to blame
Drank the wine and fell asleep
Never realized that we eat rotten flesh

Marionettes seem to serve us
Perfect shells with bright white smiles
We choose what they offer
A limited menu to keep us satisfied

They form us to their ideals
They teach us all their rules
They feed our silent hunger
They keep us under control
They offer us all their toxic
They shift us to a wrong turn
They give us forbidden fruits
They want our souls
