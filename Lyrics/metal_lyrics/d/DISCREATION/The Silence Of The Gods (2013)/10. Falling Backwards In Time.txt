Weâve made the wrong decisions
Broke rules for higher values
No boundaries left for us
Last option falls apart

The break even left behind
The last resorts sold out
Just illusions to offer
And manage the anger

[Chorus:]
We are marching
To the point of no return
The last chapter of humanity
We are tumbling down
Falling backwards in time

Although we knew what was coming
We followed the path to ruin
Crucial signs we did ignore
Benefits are what we crave for

Create wealth without regrets
Spread hate and reckless dwelling
Dysfunction of the human mind
So we will march on

Marching on
To the point of no return
Marching on
