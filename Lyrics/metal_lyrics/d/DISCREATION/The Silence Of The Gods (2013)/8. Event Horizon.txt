We aspire to conquer eternity
To explore a dismal void
In the cold light of the stars
We seek the timeless mystery

With blasphemous technology
We transgress the borders of our universe

Event horizon
Journey through hell
Evil in his purest form
Born of human hatred
Event horizon
Journey through hell
Cold light of the dying suns
Sempiternal permadeath

Behind the veil of reality
Nameless horror awaits
Beyond scientific reality
Weâre on a sinister quest

With blasphemous technology
We transgress the borders of our universe

[Chorus]

Malevolent consciousness
That feasts on fear and hate
Malicious entity
Never to be tamed

Behind the veil of reality
Nameless horror awaits
Beyond scientific reality
Weâre on a sinister quest

We aspire to conquer eternity
To explore a dismal void
In the cold light of the stars
We seek the timeless mystery

With blasphemous technology
We transgress the borders of our universe
