We are nothing, but sacks of meat
Blood and some bones to keep it upstanding
You have had a choice and you have made it
You may not have my name
But you have my blood

What have I to make of this
If it has to be done
I will do it myself
The way I choose

And we got caught in the open
I feel the strong winds passing

We are the wartribe
Wartribe
We are the wartribe
Claiming supremacy

There came a night
That lasted for generations
We were fighting a war
Not playing at one

We have to move fast and silent
As the stars look down
