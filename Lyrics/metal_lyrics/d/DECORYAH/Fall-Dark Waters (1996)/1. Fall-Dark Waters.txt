Deepness, Where are You?
Insert emotions storm in
Fill me... With your waves

Water! Love me now...
Whisper your dreams

Pain grows with the waves
Darkness runs through your Gales
Fall is yet to Come
Pain we be swept away

I feel so hogh - indcredible high
Floating above the stars - kissing the sky

I fly through th Sun as a Wave
Feeling no pain
Come with me now!
Come, Come, Come...
