I dance around a Lake
The dripping sounds of burning raged
With so feeble tone
Consuming everything

I dance around a Lake
Yearning for anything
But the visible
World which I lived in

Let your mind soar and glide
Try touch existence that hides
I hear no God Speaking
I choose the love of Misery
Water reveal the veils of live
Water take me inside

I shatter- May life I shatter...

If I had all the light
That shines inside the Sun
If I had the reveries that took me through the Waves
If I was a god above all the thrones
I still would be in the chains...
In the chains of forms
Essence release new me
Open the doors to the worlds of existence
