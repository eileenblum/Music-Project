I seek for new worlds
Through running above scarlet stars
But all I find is only the self
Water come and rescue me!

I hear her call
But when I reach out for her
There's no liquid - Fall-Dark Water

As I run, she's crying my name
I'll breath her voice until I drown
Her scent flies over untouching me
Unknowing I'm there

I hear her call
But when I reach out for her
There's no liquid - Fall-Dark Water

We'll never fade
I'll never tremble in her storm
I'll never swim in her eyes
Nothingness has taken over once again!
