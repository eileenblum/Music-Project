This journey seems to be almost endless to me
The journey to so close. The journey to so far
Lead me to the gates our world - after our raptures
See how the echoes are starting their fade
through my soul. trough my mind
The echoes ...

Why ? I have to be an indying echo ...
The journey trough the ebbing worlds
I try to reach myself. but I feel nothing
Can't you realise ? We are among the echoes
