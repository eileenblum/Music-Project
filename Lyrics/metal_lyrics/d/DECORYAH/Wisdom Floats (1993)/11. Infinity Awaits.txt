Storm, rise in my hand
Storm, form in my mind
Storm - rise

As dark as I see my world, I see my life
and my soul- As they'll clash I shall
sink into the waves of love and hate
The element of clouded lives the waves
- they must be the answer -
And together we walk into the waves...
Let it drape us

They give me everything I need.
pleasent ecstasies and...
I just wait their blow
Ah, they blow...
