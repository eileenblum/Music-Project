Through the cold land I walk
Ice covers the ground
I see no one here.
or is this the hidden area of my mind ?
Monoliths. They recall my dream
of unreal rest...
But now I leave (myself) for the paths of utopia

At the white shrine I stand
Among the cryolith memorials
Trying to get something that I canât
Apprehend my cry !
