I never thought my voice was weak
lost in the ruins of agony
They told me I was the one
who veiled the stars and the sun

I am trembling and I bleed
Only silence could see my pain and agony

I never thought I ought to run
I never seen the things you've done
I never wanted to feel growing misery

I never thought my life was weak
sunk in the rivers of agony
They told me I am not the one
who shines like the bursting Sun

I see voices rising from silence
