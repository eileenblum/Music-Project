I the judge and the jury.
I deliver the sentence.
You who've not seen the light of day, shall die before you awaken.
There is no force in my life that I cannot control.
I have your seed, I spit it on the ground,
I will not reap what you've sown,
On the widows walk he waits for thee,
On the widows walk I call your name.
I'll give to you what you gave to me, a term of confusion and pain.
I stand alone await your return,
I have nothing to gain.
You can change fates decree on the widows walk I wait for thee.
