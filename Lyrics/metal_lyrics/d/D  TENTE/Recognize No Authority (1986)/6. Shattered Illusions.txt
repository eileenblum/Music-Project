The giant fears that creep upon you as you gaze with open eyes.
At the world that surrounds you, hollow shells of faded dreams.
Somewhere close I feel your breath and somewhere I sense death.
What I felt for you last night is dying with the morning light.
Shattered illusions makes me confused.
Start making every scene searching every bar.
You're working on another scheme, illusion takes you but how far.
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS WAY!
