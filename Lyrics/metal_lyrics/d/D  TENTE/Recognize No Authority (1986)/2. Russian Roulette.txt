Nations untrustworthy, room filled with gasoline.
2 men striking matches so they can see.
They raise their guns and dare each other play a game of death.
We call it Russian Roulette.
One chance is all you get.
Chambers loaded you got the hammer cocked.
Barrels at your head, a prayer's what you've got.
DÃ©tente is undermined by the savages who lead us blind, towards Armageddon or worse.
Russian Roulette.
