You work so fucking hard to achieve your ideal in the time that you've allowed,
but no the guarantee didn't hold up, swallow hard bite back the fear.
It's always been this way, you just deceive yourself into thinking everything is fine.
Cut your wrists watch them bleed a drop for every promise you can't keep.
You're a loser not a winner, you were born to lose.
Them that has gets and you've got nothing you're a loser not a winner.
It's always been this way, nothing ever changes.
