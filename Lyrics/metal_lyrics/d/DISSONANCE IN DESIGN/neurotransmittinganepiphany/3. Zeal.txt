Thinking back to every mistake made
Wishing I could go back in time
So in the future things would change
Why do these emotions get the best of us

I will be strong
And I will move on

donât waste a minute of your time thinking what could have happened
Live for yourself uncontrolled
By someone who wants you to change

Driven by zeal
Driven by our greatest fears and ambitions

All on our own
No true help to satisfy these questions
All on our own

All the misfortune stressing in your life
It will only bring you down neglected better
Opportunities that will help you succeed in whatever it is that you believe in

Free your mind donât believe everything you are told
make your own decisions and think whats best for yourself
Cause you have the ability to do anything
You have the ability to do anything
If you set your mind to it
You will achieve
As long as your strive for it
You will achieve

I said no
donât waste a minute of your time thinking what couldâve happened
Live for yourself uncontrolled
By someone who wants you to change

I will be strong
And I will move on
