A wave, of all emotions
Overflows my body, as im, stripped fromâ¦ reality

The thought of the journey to become, ravages emy mind
Feeling regret, feeling so isolated

The thought of what I have done, burning in my soul

It takes me away to an ungodful place, no turning back for now its too late

These hallucinations, wont stop, clawing at my mind
This night will just never end

The mind of the other now lossless just as I am, the thought of his hardship, burdens my soul
We both are now fighting for what we all call normal in this hell that we once thought would be fun
The horror the terror now clawing at my lost soul, to speed up this process, just isnât logical
But I know that I will awaken from this nightmare and emerge this event as a stronger person

The horror the terror now clawing at my lost soul, to speed up this process, just isnât logical
But I know that I will awaken from this nightmare and emerge this event as a stronger person

Slowly, its, foundation, is pieced, back together
Just then, a light on the horizon
Just then, a light on the horizon

This is mine, this soul is now divine
This is mine, this soul is now divine
