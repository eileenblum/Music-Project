I've watched the world burning, Ive seen the angels die
No way out of total emotion, in a sleep of total disguise
We're breaching the brinks of insanity, we will wake you up this time, in a dreamstate we will eat you, in a manner of nightmare style, best wishes on your road to recovery, I guarantee that you'll fall tonight
this is our dreamstate, we will wake you up tonight, in this dreamstate we will eat you in a manner of nightmare style

a one man army inside my head, this defiled, aggression beat it to death, tonight, we render the storm again, all will fall, my consciousness recalls all

you cant pull me out...
you're picking me up, you're pushing me out
you're pulling me out, you're waking me up

Dreamstate, will take, your lives, away this time

Magistrate, just ask the magistrate, if i can wake up this time
Just ask the magistrate if i can wake up and ask for forgiveness, overthrow, control the magistrate, make them get on their knees, and beg for forgiveness...

An epiphany has occurred to me, and it has told me this, that this music is the reality that drives me to exist....
