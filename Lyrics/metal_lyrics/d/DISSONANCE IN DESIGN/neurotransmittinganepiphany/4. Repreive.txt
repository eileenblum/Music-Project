I, regret nothing, all the events in this past life have molded the structure of who i have come to be. a life once lost filled with lies, and hatred of my sure demise, cast out from my own fucked up mind, a poison to zombify. a lie for a drug just to seek such a high, has become a destructive wake, tearing thru my loved ones lives. consciousness is leading to a deep depression in my only soul and heart are set to die. my only hope is that i realize what ive done and make things better in the end. for this charade to stop in place, and end this persistent reign of...terror. its escalated to the point of which there is no control of my psyche, the person i once longed to be has now faded away.
Take the first step out of your consciousness, reveal, a picture. you were, once blind to this, now use it to, your help. you made the choice to end this travesty, although damaged youve come out of this alive. From once thought unbeatable odd, next step is forgiveness from all that youve hurt, no compromise.
I, I am now free, a life of sickness and pain now, vanishing.
Dont regret any event that youve endured that changed your life for better and or for worse.
'cause its all meant to be, its all meant to be, its all meant to be...it just takes time for you to realize what it means...
The regret and shame can be washed away for those who care about your heart, have forgiven, and life has moved on, live has moved...on
