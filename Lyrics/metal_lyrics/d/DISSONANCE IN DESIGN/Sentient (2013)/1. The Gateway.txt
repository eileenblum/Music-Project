A window into the other side. Behold the wonders this realm has to hide. A breakthrough in scientific ascension granted us sight into another dimension. Bending matter, space, and time the strings slowly begin to unwind. Deep within the military confines, we watch in awe
so many questions on our minds. This world does obfuscate tempting us to go beyond the gate. Re-calibrate the machine, soon we'll journey into a new world. So preoccupied with what we could, never stopped to ask if we should. Disregarded our sense of ethics, morals give
way to curiosity. A probe created for this purpose alone now is the time venture into the unknown.
