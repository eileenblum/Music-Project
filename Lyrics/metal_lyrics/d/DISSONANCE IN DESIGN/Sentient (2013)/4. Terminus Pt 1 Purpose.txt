Because of our abilities, primitive beings believe us to be demons or gods. How could they ever comprehend our true purpose? Eons ago we were created for the purpose of consuming the souls of wicked beings. Only through us can they be cleansed and sent back into the
universe, until they are reborn into their new vessels, free from the sins committed in their past lives. Most know there is no escape and they accept their fate. When the sentients come to call.
