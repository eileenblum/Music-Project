A window within the military citadel spews beasts from the depths of hell. Ethereal creatures tear through the veil, how could we ever hope to prevail? Their form of warfare, of sustenance will leave you cold. They will devour your soul. Leaving behind only a shell of
your former self.
A close proximity is all it takes for these fiends to feast upon the very essence of your being. Their regenerative properties render our arsenal obsolete. Oh the humanity! I never thought I'd see such grievous atrocities.
We're left with no way to destroy the gate. It seems that we have sealed our fate.
A close proximity is all it takes for these fiends to feast upon the very essence of your being. Their regenerative properties render our arsenal obsolete. Screams of the would-be-damned echo through the air. Inter dimensional warfare, for which we are hopelessly
unprepared. Swarms of demons shift from city to city, leaving soulless bodies in their wake. A self inflicted genocide, to which there is no end in sight! There must be some way to vanquish these foes. There must be some way to right what we have done. There must be some
way to destroy the gate. There must be some way to save our souls.
