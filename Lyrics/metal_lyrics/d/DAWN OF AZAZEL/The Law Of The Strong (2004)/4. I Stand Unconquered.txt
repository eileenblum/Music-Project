Unequalled in valour and prowess
With unerring aggression retained
In belligerent spirit unconquered
By season weather or terrain
As an infernal storm to the vanquished,
We ride the whirlwind unopposed
Our superiority etched in the landscape
And the bodies of annihilated foes

Unequalled belligerence
The mighty ones
Unconquered
