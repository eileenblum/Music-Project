Subservitude, dominance will reign,
Upon the throne beheld again
Render elite from stoutest stone
To forever reign in dominance
Victorious, solar virtues are one
In those risen above, those who have spared none
Thus I have rendered by my own hand
Forever to reign in dominance

Iconoclasm of idols
With hands of steel and wills of iron
I shall decimate and I shall dominate,
Forge my kingdom of those whom I subjugate
