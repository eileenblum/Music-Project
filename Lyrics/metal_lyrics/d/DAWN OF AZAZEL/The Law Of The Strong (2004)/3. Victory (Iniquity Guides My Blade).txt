Inferior Pious Deceiver
Embodiment of everything that I oppose
As you tremble before shadows and gods
And stand naked before your foes
I grasped destiny by the horns
And rode out from the invalid which was I
Now my blood runs black in the ecstasy
Of my own Machiavellian might

Now see the chariots wheel in panic
As levelled spears drink their fill
Feel the pikes grow wet and slippery
As I move in for the kill
Upon the path of the true elitist,
Every footstep is obscured in the dark
I grasp the hand of iniquity
And walk under the light of the Morning Star

Now In Rebellious spirit I stand atop this world
Anoint myself in profane majesty
A thousand Raven-haired harlots pine at my feet
Inebriated by the crimson wine of my Satanic victory
All who challenge, shall fall broken on my way
Upon the path of true enlightenment
I brake your stride and strike you lame and mute
And smite you down in zealous glee

Submission is a gift (not a loan)
You are not owed interest.
Don't just kneel there, make yourself useful
I am in control
The power within me is great
You are a broken shell of a human
The epitome of all that is weak,
I am in control
The power within me is great
You are a broken shell of a human
The epitome of all that is weak
