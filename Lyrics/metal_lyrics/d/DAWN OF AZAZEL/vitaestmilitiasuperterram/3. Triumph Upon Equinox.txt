Upon the altar of war
Scrolls and covenants sealed in blood
To offer unto
Upon the commemoration of harvest
To be combined with Antichrist
Upon the throne of might
All creator, all destroyer
In the coming dawn unite
The bearer of an iron fist beheld as divine
Coup de stellar echos, his ethos is mine
For what shall be of thy enfeebled man
When the time has come to bear the sword
In the eternity of this moment
We shall have the world in the sigil of the conquering ones
Hold high our goal
And heighten the will
The arms of the feeble shall bear us still
Through tears and suffering,
Until the dawn and the triumph of the will
In this battle I hold and raise high the impious sign
Now blood of triumph
Anointing supremacy
Conceiver and my own redeemer
Upon equinox I am these
