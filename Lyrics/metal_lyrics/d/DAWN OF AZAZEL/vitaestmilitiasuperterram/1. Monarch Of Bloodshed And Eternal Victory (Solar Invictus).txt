Awaken, this sanguinary imperative
Blood boils over confining walls
For the Olympian Diathesis,
That which stands above all
Ordain the age of their suffering
Decimate their enfeebled kingdom
In vengeance rent upon the entrails
Torn of the obsolescent human faeces

Deities of vengeance
Bestow upon me your favor
That I might smite mine enemies whilst they sleep
Preserve the mighty, oh bringer of retribution
Crush those prostrate at my feet
May we the spiteful and our kingdom,
In purifying vengeance reign
I shall be as the incendiary
And consume in fire their remains

And now a internecine lineage
Is born unto this world
With hatred and contempt,
For this enfeebled world
With knotted club as sceptre,
And divine lightning at its grasp,
Resolute and statuesque
In immortal phallic might

Stout in virtue and defiance
Stands the stratum that bears its soul,
Spartan crushers of the yoke
Embody the dialectic that shall conquer all
One man shall fell one thousand
Under its mantle and its legacy
"Bring my enemies before me,
Vanquished shall they be"

All the old races lie dead and buried
Amid the Faustian ruins
Of the effeminate
All the old doctrines lie hollow and empty
In the twilight of the imperium
Of the decadent
Arise ascetic amidst the decay
As he who is still unfettered
Ordain the consummation in solar fire
Of the downtrodden infidel

All the old hierarchies lie ineffectual and useless
In the hedonistic weakness
Of the effeminate
All the old maxims lie lost and lowly
In the intoxicating senility
Of the decadent
Arise in conquest amidst the decline
As he who is the destroyer
Ordain the cull of the worthless dross
Sadistic victor

Consanguine catharsis of the feted, base and inane
Astride the throne in primacy
As Rome shall fall again
To be throned when empires sink
In storms of steel and flame
To be throned when weakling breeds
Are hunted down like game
To be throned in the eminence of sanguinary disarray
To reclaim the sceptre in hatred, in spite, in conquest
