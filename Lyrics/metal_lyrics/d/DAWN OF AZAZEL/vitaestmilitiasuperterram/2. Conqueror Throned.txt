Raise the standards of bloodshed
Ascend the throne in war
Cast out infidels as victor
Thresh the wheat from straw
Exterminate their meekness
Put weakness to the sword
Purify them in the flames
Of one hundred years of war
I am the uniting force,
I am the elitist spawn
Of the eternal holy war
To which all great men are sworn
The few who shall rend the earth as lightning,
And eclipse the heavens in our might
Grasp firm diadems
By totalitarian right

Wield the blood-stained sword of vengeance
Drench opposition in bloodshed
Their broken bodies shall form the path
On which we conquer on ahead
Crush the underman, utterly consume him with hate,
Main burn rend kill slay, impale, decimate
For when the world is again forged of be force
There shall be no pity, there shall be no remorse

I am the victor, the conquering one,
I am the redeemer as the lightning and the sun
The one man to reign of iron fist and will
The will to engender the instincts of our survival

The amoral urge and barbaric call
The iconoclastic spirit, the almighty master of all
The thunder of redemption,
The lion in the path,
The flames of Armageddon
And the conqueror's lance
