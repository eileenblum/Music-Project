Cast out the false commandments of the celibate and subdued
Heed not such muzzled masters, but the fiesty filthy few
Exhalted and reviled,the perverse pleasures
And the caress of the night and their foul majesties
Let every hole and orifice pay homage to these kings
Your hips attest their prowess and their lips your suffering
Their tongue speaks no lies, the only salvation is vice and deviant deeds

Fill my glass with pleasures and the vilest overproof
and I shall lock my horns with she capricious and aloof
And tame her to my side, let no bastard deny my monarchy
With lucid drunken rantings so many hearts I've won
But I ain't losing sleep over the sins I've done
Iniquity is divine, these pleasures I won't deny are what I seek

Liqour, sin and lust
And mayhem in my wake
Fools shall falter
And kings will copulate

Sexual liberty
Revel in the arts of lust viciously
I shall not be outdone
With a bottle or at a broads bosom
Penetrate
Countless chasms I shall copulate
Ribaldry
Rabid Raw and Raucous

Lusty libertines loins set afire
They shall know true ecstasy as I perspire
With our loins linking, with wine and drinking

Drinking
Drinking
Drinking
