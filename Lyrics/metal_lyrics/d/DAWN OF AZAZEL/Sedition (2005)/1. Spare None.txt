Unfetter revolt and wrath
Smother all pure in black
Let none be spared from my virulence

Cradle the deity within
In the embrace of sin
Smitten with deeds of deviance

Succumb to this carnal force
Perversion and intercourse
Lechery and lust ever enduring

Curse every blessed name
Drench their lives in flame
Flaccid fallacies reduced to ruin

Wipe its embers from my eyes so that I may see
Smash the feeble fetters that confine me
Drown every righteous man in misery
With the ten thousand tears that consecrate my victory

Men of grace reach out to bind me
No chains are strong enough to hold
I shall fend off the barbs of a thousand blows
Unconquerable rebellious and bold
My spirit remains intrepid
And shall never bow its head
I spit upon these sullen servants
Let them taste my ire instead

Unfetter revolt and wrath
Smother all pure in black
Let none be spared from my virulence

Cradle the deity within
In the embrace of sin
Smitten by deeds of deviance

Succumb to this carnal force
Slit the throats of these frauds
Give no quarter to anyone

No innocence

No purity

No mercy

Spare none
