Prophets priests, apostles, men fated to fall
Crusaders against decadence capitulate and crawl
Seething in their skin, shackled to the yoke
Falter in their faith, despondent and alone

Villainy endures and corrupts them all
Tempts them from fidelity to the teats of whores
Enslaved by the perversions that were once scorned

Villainy endures and masters these thralls
Brings them to their knees and puts them to the sword
Villainy, virility, the antagonist eternally endures
