Swallow the darkest of poisons
Distilled from dirt and silt
Inebriated by uncleanliness
Violence stirs in this filth
Eclipse the sun, yield to none
Smother the heavens
And taint the light of its stars
The road of excess
Leads to the palace of wisdom

Intoxicated grandeur
Uninhibited, dirty and enraged
Savour its bitterness
Fuel another virulent tirade
Forge on forever
Ironclad future hewn of hate
Vicious and cruel
I am violence incarnate
