I will defy convention
Uplift the instruments of sin
Surmount the walls enshrining piety
Defile the supple flesh within
Overturn the altars of morality
Let the defloration begin
Cast the chaste unto harlotry
Anoint their loins with venom

Your Kingdom crumbles effortlessly
Your deities fall to their knees before me
