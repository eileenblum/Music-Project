Arise amongst brimstone and pandemonium
The time has come to awaken and reclaim our dominion
Vines and serpents shall bind the hands of the enfeebled
Wipe the lands of all trace of the deceitful
Entice the innocent with lustful allure
Sire the fornicatress in the pure
And mentor sinful deeds in the adolescent
Vengeance upon the idols of acquiescence
Cultivate every single suppressed desire
Let every action exalt the deity in fire

The time has come for rebellion and reprobation
Abandon yourself to hedonism and fornication
Dive head long into the perverse ideal
Separate its vision from the surreal
Initiate them into the kingdom of ecstasy
Fill their loins with victory
And harvest the fruits of their sexual exertion
See the nubile schooled in perversion
Let them forget the Eden that they have come from
And walk the road that leads to Babalon
