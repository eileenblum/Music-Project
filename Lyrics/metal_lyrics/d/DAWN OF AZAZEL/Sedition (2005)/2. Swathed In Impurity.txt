Annihilate! - Every cretin and creed that obstructs my path to wisdom
The path of fire that few have dared tread before me
Awaken within you pride and wrath - vengeance
Upon the compassionate let Cain's bludgeon reign supreme

Garden of innocence wither and perish, littered with the fallen
Pious victims of their own despair
The children of god, poisoned and lost suffering amongst the wreckage
Of Eden

For I dwell in paradise
Cast in flesh and bone
All righteousness kneels beneath me
Impurity enthroned
