Dead souls
From a dead world
Visions from hell
A place where we shall dwell

Shadows of dawn
Rising in the distant horizon
Death approaching
Raging across the immortal land
No salvation
Only devastation

Black angels
Chanting evil

Dead souls
From a dead world
Visions from hell
A place where we now dwell
