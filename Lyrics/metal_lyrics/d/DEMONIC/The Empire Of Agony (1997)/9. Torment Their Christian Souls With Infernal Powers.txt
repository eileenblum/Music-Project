Fall down to my hellish
Kingdom of agony
Hateful eyes staring down into your weak Christian souls
Dark fugures
Your lives will soon come to an end
Burn......

I am your tormentor

Torment them
In my world of death and slitude
Impaled
To this unholy place forever
Sadistic despot
Despair in their eyes......

A place filled with evil
Where darkness has rules for milleniums
Infernal powers
your destiny awaits

Devoted, to evil for all time
Ancient rites, come forth my demons
Tormentor, my loyal servant
Burngin, their souls cry out in pain

Torment them...
Torment them......
