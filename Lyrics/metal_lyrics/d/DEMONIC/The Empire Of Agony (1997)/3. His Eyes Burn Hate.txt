Upon the mighty throne
The one with the horns
His eyes crush all light
With his burning hate

Those who join his damnation
Are the sons of darkness
Who will forever spread hate
A chalice of blood
Filled with pure malevolence
From solitude
And the cold mist
Bring forth the emperor's horde

Infernal beast
My shadow and soul...
