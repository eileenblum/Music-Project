Bloodwar......
Infernal master
Posessed......

The weak ones will feel
Thy masters merciless wrath
An unknown world of suffering

Swords dripping blood
Killed for the beast
As I close myself
Into darkness

Now, my spawnes of Satan
We shall bring holocaust
And darkness upon them

Demons......
Kill the holy infant
Sorrow......

When the sun burns red
Battles will take place
There is no eescape
No escape......

Now, my victorious horde
Death has swallowed
them down to Hell

Carnage......
Unending evil
Desecration......

The weak ones will feel
Thy masters merciless wrath
A path of slaughtered Christians

Churches reduced to ashes
The Holy Spirit fades away
We watch them flee
Never to be free

Eternal...Bloodwar
Blodwar...Bloodwar......
