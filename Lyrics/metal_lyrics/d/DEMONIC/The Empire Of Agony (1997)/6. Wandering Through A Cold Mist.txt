Land of frost
Time stands still
In this cold and dark place
An endless journey
Only to face death

The path behind me
Suddenly gone
Cold voices
Darkness draws near

Trapped in solitude
Forced to suffer
Frozen by the mist

Dark
Skies of unholy demons
Killind the angels of light
Evil night

Plague
Sweeping over the cursed
Land of doom
And endless wandering in circles
