Dark secrets
Our inner demon calls us
Falling down
Into Satan's region

Lord of Darkness...

Grant us immortality
Take us to your infernal kingdom
Heaven's angels
Tormented for our pleasure
Our darkest dreams
Have become reality

From below
The horned awaits us
We are now
Servants of the dark side
Shades of death
Surrounding us Eternally

Lead us into darkness...
