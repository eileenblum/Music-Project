I, Ruler of Darkness
Kneel before me
My horde and wisdom is strong
May the churches fall

Be gone, slave of hypocrisy
Hail the one whose eyes
Burn black of evil
Forsake those who preach the word of Holy homage
To devilry for its existance

Flames, my wrath commands you
Summon, my dark diciples
My horde, lift your swords for the one
Force them, through the holy one's...heart

Witchdemon, draped in black
Hellfire, burn my victims
Antichrist, my demonic leader
