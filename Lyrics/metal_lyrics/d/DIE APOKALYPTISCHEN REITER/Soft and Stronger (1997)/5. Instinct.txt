Too much animal too less human
Are between good and bad.
Violence, egoism are with you
Through you wanna love.
Instinct over intellect
Hate, love, war, compassion
Tear apart in a bad agony
You've done good deeds
But in the end you'll be a loser.
Too much human, too less animal
Standing between good and bad.
Compassion, love is with you
Though you should be the strongest.
But the human animal will die
In cause of self-destruction in a furious avidity
In the end there won't be any might man.
Only day and night as from the beginning of time age!
