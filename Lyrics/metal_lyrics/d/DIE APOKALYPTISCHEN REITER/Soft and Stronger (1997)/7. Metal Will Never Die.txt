Metal will never die, we promise you
Metal is the law, the only for me and you
Be my brother; let us sing this fighting song
We fight for metal; metal is our holy alliance
Nobody can beat us
Together we are strong!
We are brothers of metal; we will have never gone!
Darkness all around us, I hear the wolves howl
But they'll never get us!
We still stand as one!
We are kings, without a kingdom.
We have the might, to conquest the world!
This song is forever; it will always guide you!
If you're alone, listen to this song of metal!
I'm always be there for you
Don't lose your courage
We fight to stayin' alive; I'm always with you!
