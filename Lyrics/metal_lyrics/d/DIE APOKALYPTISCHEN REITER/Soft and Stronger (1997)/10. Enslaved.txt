Can't believe the world is a place for lies
Can't believe the world is only rules by power (alone)
Can't believe that everyone humbles before repression
But I'm very sure; we're damned for downfall.
Children of damnation, slaved until death
The mankind is the living end of the world
A spreading and ailing sickness.
If you don't want to suffer, start hating
Looking for a way out you'll perish.
