Lost in visions I see a land,
Hearts full of blissfulness
A life without a fight.
Lost in visions
A ship called "my saviour" sailed lonesome through times
The aim showing it the right direction was my salvation.
Downfall!
Die in pain
Downfall!
Die In hell
Downfall!
Fuckin' die
Downfall!
The ship passing through all storms,
Through fear, neediness and because danger,
It's exactly the ideal solution as there is no harbour.
