Hope is eternal, almost longer than torture (agony)
Lost in destiny, last dance of the human (mankind)
Destroyed what we loved, destroyed what delights us
Had to stand 1.000 tortures when hate ate my heart.
To live Is to die
The last hope burned down to dust
Out of sense, but without any fear
Waitin' for the end now, on our way to downfall.
Thoughts driftin' in the sea of passion
I had read the book of life and it killed me.
