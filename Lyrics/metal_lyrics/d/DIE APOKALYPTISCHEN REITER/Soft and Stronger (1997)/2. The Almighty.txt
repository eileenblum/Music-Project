I'm your master, cause I know the depths of your soul
I saw how you killed
Destruction of your own race but for what...for your lords?
You are to weak to lead yourself
You never learned to think!
You call yourself as humans
But you are only dogs, need your lord. Follow me!
I'm your desire, your hate. your agony
I'm your madness, the almighty!
Follow me, I'll guide you into the holy land
Follow me, I'll steal your mind
Follow me, I'll guide you into downfall.
Crawl, kneel, pray
I love to see you suffer!
Die for me the martyr-death
My little sheep's, come to me
I'm waiting for you!
