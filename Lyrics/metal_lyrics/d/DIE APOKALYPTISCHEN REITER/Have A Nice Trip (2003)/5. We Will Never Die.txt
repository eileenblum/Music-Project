We are your therapy cause we call us wild and free
we are the horsemen of the apocalypse
long time we slept in the fire of lust
but now we are awake
we are the ones you can trust
we play for you not just for anyone
we want to free your soul my son
follow us and you will be free
in a world of liberty

We will never die
this is our song
keep the faith
you know where you belong

We did not come here to destroy
we want to show you how to live
we are the prophets of light
weÂ´ll free you from the darkness
of lonely nights
every night we fight
to do the right for you
we hope you know
what you have to do
give your soul into our hands
weÂ´ll guide you to the promised land

We will never die ...

Ride with us until the end of time
feel how it feels to shine
Together we will be strong
the army of immortals
thatÂ´s where you belong
