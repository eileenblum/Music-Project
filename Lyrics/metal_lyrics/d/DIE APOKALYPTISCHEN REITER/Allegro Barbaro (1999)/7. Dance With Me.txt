I dance every morning till the sun goes down
I laugh loud as long the world turns round
The end draws near, every evening, day by day
Come dance with me, it is too late.

The world is black, it's the way it should be
There's not much time left to shoe emotions
And so we dance joyfully into the end
Come with me, I'm prepared
And laughing we dance into the darkness.

Life is seldom beautiful
Be patient, one day you will comprehend
Everyday humanity dies
To love somebody there's not much time
New born megalomanice to possess
To rule is to blame.
