Everything is clear now
Our aim is fixed in our hearts
If you know the way
Nobody is in the mood to stop you

Don't demean yourself
You've chosen the light
And not the pain
So just live and fight

[Ref:]    No questions, no fear
The solution is near
Much you've got to learn
And great power you will earn

Delight and fortune
Easy to get
For the one, who's finished
With dependence on fate
