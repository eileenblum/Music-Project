Sometimes I fear to wake
Sometimes I fear the next day
Ill humour seems to crush me
Agonising pain stronger than the ideal?

Sometimes I fear that nobody stands up
Sometimes I fear that nobody defends himself
Sometimes I fear to be restless for all eternity and
Sometimes I fear that my fear gets lost
