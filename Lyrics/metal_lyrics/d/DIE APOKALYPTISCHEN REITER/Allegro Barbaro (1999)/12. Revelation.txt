Is love pain?
Fortune paralysed by fear?
The quest of deepest darkness
Although the creature strives for the light.

Love, depraved mysterium ...... revelation?
Are we falling into the most tremendous of all storms
Can eternity only mitigate
The crown of creation rose to rule to be subject.

The beast has left us
Gaja will be the judge
Love, depraved mysterium ....... Revelation ...... Downfall
Love, depraved mysterium ....... Revelation ...... Downfall!
