Proud 'n free like will of steel
Our hearts are as pure as the silence of a night
We are brothers of METAL united in fight
'Cause METAL is our law

Heavy Metal is our law
We are proud and standing tall
Heavy Metal is what we feel
Harder than steel

Can you feel the power of this song
The energy it is giving you
Brothers united in mind
'Cause Metal is our law.

HEAVY METAL

HEAVY METAL is our law
We are proud and standing tall
HEAVY METAL is what we feel
Harder than steel

Our life belongs to Heavy Metal
Our fight applies to its enemies
We'll fight for our right
To live like we want.

HEAVY METAL

Listen to your hearts they don't defraud you
This shall be our fighting song
Even the world is black and hope gets lost
We'll stand together until the end of time

HEAVY METAL is our law
We are proud and standing tall
HEAVY METAL is what we feel
Harder than steel
