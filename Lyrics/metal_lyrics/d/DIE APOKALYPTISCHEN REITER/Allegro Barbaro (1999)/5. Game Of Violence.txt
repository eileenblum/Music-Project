Defeated in the game of violence, screams just dying away
Defeated in the game of the Teutons, tears accompanying their power
Defeated in the game of lies, the scum feigning you sterile love
Defeated in the game of fate, defeated in the game of violence.

The game of violence deadly silence

Irony of life, you are playing human in vain
Irony of madness, superior cultures, death adorning its traces
Irony of the game, the lust while killing lasts unsatisfied
Irony of violence, your rage your hate your mental agony.
