Destroyed what once burned so great and glorious inside me
The fire that never seemed to fade
The life took me every sense
Unimportant all those years of striving for perfect glory.

The flame once burning so great and glorious turned me into stone
Love turned into hate, hope into pain
You shall perish, you who took my dreams
You shall die 1000 years, my hate is blind.
