To live is to die the last hope burned down to dust
Out of mind but without any fear waiting for the end now
On our way to downfall, thoughts drifting in the sea of passion
I had read the book of life and it killed me

Hate for your lies burns in my heart
Why does falseness always have to win?
I wanna unfold my soul
Don't wanna be imprisoned by you

My comfort my death will be yours as well
Face to face with death we are all the same
Lost in visions I all hope fades out
What remains is just a high
