Famine - The soul of mankind
Pestilence - The plague of mankind
War - The horror of mankind
Death - The best for mankind

Recompense for your wasted time
Result of your sins

Don't beg for mercy
Your last chance is gone
The time has come for
The march of revenge

You demand humanity, but you are inhuman.
You demand justice, but you are unjust.
You demand love, but you kill.
You want to protect, but you destroy.

Don't beg for mercy
Your last chance has gone
The time has come for
The march of revenge.

We judge, cause we are judges.
We destroy, cause we create.
We create, cause we destroy.
We like to see you suffer.

We, the guardians of this planet!
