Too much animal too less human
Are between good and bad.
Violence, egoism are with you
Through you wanna love.

Hate, love, war, compassion
Tear apart in a bad agony
You've done good deeds
But in the end you'll be gone.

But the human animal will die
In cause of self-destruction in a furious avidity
In the end there won't be any might man.
Only day and night as from the beginning of time age!

[Lyrics: Eumel]
