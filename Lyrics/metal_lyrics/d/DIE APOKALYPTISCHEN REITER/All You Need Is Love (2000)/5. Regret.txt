Dread demands a gentle heart
Perceive the chasm but with pride
I take a ride to unknown heights
Where lightnings tear me apart.

When my kingdom's gone
I'll harvest all I never knew
Lungs will choke a silent cry
Yom - regret - I can't deny.

Grief demands an injured soul
Deny the despair with my hate
Falling down to unknown depths
Face to face my inner ghoul.

When my kingdom's gone
I'll harvest all I never knew
Lungs will choke a silent cry
Yom - regret - I can't deny.

Bewilderment - fight for me
Is there a truth without some lies
Dew drops down - my hour comes
Hellhound set me free.

[Lyrics: Volk-Man]
