Penetrated by desire
Emptied by the masters fire
By-pass required - a burning shell
Access denied - exit hell

Licked by the tongues of pride
I shall forever walk inside
Kissed by the lips of insanity
I shall die eternally.

Turn around, face the lecher
Close the skin and bear the anger
Infiltrate your enemies
Give 'em pain and luxuries.

Surround the icons, burn 'em down
And magnetize emperor's crown
Devour the dust of bible - lines
Live 1000 years in suicide mines

Kingdom's painted bitter black
Fear the serpent in your neck
Summon the golden wine of sun
Drink the sky when time has come

[Lyrics: Volk-Man]
