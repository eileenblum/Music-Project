Order - pay | sow - harvest
degrade - regret | buy - sell

The price is always the same
only death is just for nothing
The quality of your pain
Only you define it!

Price Of Ignorance

White - black | cold - hot
light - dark | sweet - sour

It's easy to say "yes"
It's easy to vegetate
But life means agony
And you are too weak for it!

God - Satan | War - Peace

Wherefore ideals ?
Models for whom?
Why courage?
Compassion... for you??
