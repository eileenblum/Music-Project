Brothers we are
From each other never far
Cause our hearts beat as one
United in the battle to hail the holy Metal
Kingdom Reitermania will come
Soon everyone can hear the freedom call
Reitermaniacs will never fall
We are the hope, feel the mystical might
And fight with us in the army of light

Can you feel the power
We will push it to the max
All for one and one for all
We are Reitermaniacs

Our will is unbreakable
We know no lie we wonÂ´t hide
Life is our fight and we ride on to guide
The army of light
We search for the glory
To give reasons for a new history
Soon we will reach our aim
Reitermania will not just be a flame
