I am a rocket I am a gun
I am always on the run
I am possessed by a beautiful sickness
Rock n roll is my business

Give me money for life and action and
I bring the good vibes to your nation
I guarantee you satisfaction
I am the only real attraction

Rock n roll means soul
Rock n roll is godâs tool
Rock n roll is what you need
Rock n roll is what we preach

Hide your wives - I know they canât resist
If we come to your town at next
To bring you what the gods made us for
Rock n roll the revelation

Come on baby feel the ecstasy
Donât let your body rest, make you free
We give you a new religion
The healthiest addiction
