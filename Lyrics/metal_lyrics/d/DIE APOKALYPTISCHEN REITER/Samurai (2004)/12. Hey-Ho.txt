Hey-Ho letâs go - this is my violent show
Hey-Ho letâs go - I give my fears a blow

Should I wait?
Should I suffer?
It hurts way too long
Cannot forgive you anymore
The pain is slowly killing me.

The glas is broken and I will fly
Far, far away
To a mountain youâll never know.
I will be free.

I spread my wings and breathe the air
I will be free
I get back to myself
I will be free.
