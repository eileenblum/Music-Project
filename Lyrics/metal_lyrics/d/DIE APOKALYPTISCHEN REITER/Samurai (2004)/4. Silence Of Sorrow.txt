I will get you in the night
My revenge must be satisfied
I will hunt you until the end
To send your soul to hell again
The devil has SPIT you up
To evil were you for him
And if we meet us now again
It will be the promised land

I swore I will kill you
To sacrifice my self
To delete my pain
And get back my pride

The silence of sorrow is covering me
A sea of dried up tears belongs to me
The silence of sorrow cryâs to me
In every single fibre I HAVE to feel
