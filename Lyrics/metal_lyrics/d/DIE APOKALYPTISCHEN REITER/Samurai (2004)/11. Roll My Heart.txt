Roll roll roll roll my heart
A never ending story
Roll roll roll roll my heart
Over all the seas
Roll roll roll roll me heart
Til the end comes to me

Iâm the man who will know every town
Every country, every crowd
A serious business (that) i call me own
I play for you holy tunes

I carry no weapons iâm armed with dreams
Just listen if you have to know what it means
Maybe i can give you hope if you need some
A musicman is giving love to you

The drug i shot now in your brain
Is the taste of freedom, check your leader
I donât wanna see anyone in chains
Let me be your dealer
