I listen to the sea, this is all what I have to be
Iâm lying in the sun, enjoying this quiet fun
The wind caresses so softly
It feels like somebody loves me
The sky is painted in smooth blue
The drink in me hand, too

Another lazy day no affray

The night is coming, I see the moon
Itâs getting dark here soon
Iâm looking at the stars but without any wars
Tomorrow I go down the hill...or maybe up
Or I stay here and shift into lowest gear

Another lazy day no affray

Today I believe I am really free
All the good things are so easy to see
Another lazy day
No fight to stay
