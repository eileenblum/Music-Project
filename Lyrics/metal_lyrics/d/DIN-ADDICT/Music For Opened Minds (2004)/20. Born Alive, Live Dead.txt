Independent life doesn't exist
You know it
Exclusion, humiliation,
This was your childhood

"Only the strong shall survive" and
"Behave yourself son"
That's only you got from home
Fear, loathe, disgust from any difference
This became the strongest element of your life
No personality, no originality
You're the next follower of this line

You'll be successor of this brain-washed inquisitional system
Teach to hate anothers, and they'll hate them
Your fear will always remain, am I normal?
No, you don't, you're just a marionette
Of this sick society
Herd instinct, adaptation, lack of ideas
This proves your identity
Let's become impersonally
Until everybody'll disappear finally!
