You think you're open minded
But you aren't really inspiring
You're blinkered
And can't see what real life is
It's a horrible deed for you
But you must admit it

Fertility of mind is near extinction
For intellectual world is following the fashion
World of provocation is almost disused
World of fashion mongers are perversely strained

Sentient beings are th only concern for them
Subconscious terror to inhibit you became enlighted
Schizophrenic crosswire of living in a free world
How can we do this, so conceptually constrainted?

Hard instinct, unintelligence
Lack of intellectual independence!
