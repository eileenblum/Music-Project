You're old, you're fat
You're surely more than a ton
You're old, you're bald
You can't move, you can't run
You're old, you're fat
You've got no hair, just mustache
You're fat, you're gay
You're stinky everyday

Gobbl, stodge, eat all day
'Till your stomach burst away
Don't move, swallow your bile
And just struggle with your pile
