You're representing the same type of level
That freedom is really important for

You don't need friends
You don't need steady company
You always shut to a gang
Those endure you

The most important thing for you is the free alcohol,
The free cigarette, and the free life

You've got a particular opinion about freedom,
But you urge the importance of these things
You're the real punks live like the worm devouring leftovers?
This is like shit, and not punk!
This is your style!
