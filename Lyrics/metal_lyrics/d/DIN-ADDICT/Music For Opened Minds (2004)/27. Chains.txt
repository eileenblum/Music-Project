Pain penetrates to your heart
Dream breaks to pieces inside of you
Your injured soul sobs
A teardrop flows on your face

You call mutely - only your lips move
You reel - desperated
Frightened you, while searching
The right way
Looking for t as you tramble

They mentally manipulating you
They utilize you with a purpose in itself
Your emotions are choked into you
Your body is bound to chains closely

Facing you
I see you are ruined
Open your eyes at last
Don't let then to direct you!!!
