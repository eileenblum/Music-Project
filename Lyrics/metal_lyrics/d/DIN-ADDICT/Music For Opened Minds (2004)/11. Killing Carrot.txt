Once upon a time, there was a little boy
Yes, I already remember

He endures to give himsel synthetic materials
One night in despair about the tasteless life
He stabbed out his parents' eyes
With a frozen carrot

But the story goes on
The little boy has foster-parents

His life was poisoned
With fruit and vegetable mass
So he cheered up his life
Manner he butchered his articles because of his boredom

Nobody understood the little boy
