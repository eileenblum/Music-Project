Marx was gay
Smith was gay
Gossen was gay
Keynes was gay

Fuck gross domestic product
Fuck marginal social benefit
Fuck those monopolists
And fuck you all economists!

Means of production will never be collective
There's no invisible hand, fuck you Smith
Pleasures are increasing
'Cause Gossen was gay
Future is sure, because people will always remain the same
