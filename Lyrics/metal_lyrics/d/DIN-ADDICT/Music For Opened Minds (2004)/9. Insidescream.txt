Animals, killed for their fur
"Superior" beings profit eering's work
Compost-production remains of
Destroyed nature

Devastating without thinking
Yearning for lost civilizations
Only infection, mutilation, putrefaction

From rotten tissues you vomit your bowels
"Sweet smells" of life can be only remembrance
Your bizarre evilness - your only piece of work what remains!

You become at the "top" of evolution
Salive churning from your mad face
Your perverted science's precious gem is death!

Kill everything what's alive, you learnt that
While earth became like gnawed bones
It should be better to build and create, you shit!

You should admire the multitude of animals
The brilliant enchantment of nature
That they can serve the king of the animals!
