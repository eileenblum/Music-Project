The war was outbreaked my machines
They had fucking autocracy
Exploiting the ignorant people
With disguise of delivery
Selecting selected to live on
The average crowd was put to death
Nothing, but the rank mattered
The brain - the executioner
They killed them without respect
It is just a slight practise for them
Religion of fate
They won't submit to live
Religion of fate
Fanatic of slaughtering
