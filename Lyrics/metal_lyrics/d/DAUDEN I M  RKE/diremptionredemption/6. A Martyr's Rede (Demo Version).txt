[Written - Aske]
[Performed - Aske]

To my home they came with weapons keen
To blight love from my heart and my powers obscene
Hypocrites and slanderers
Strike my honest life with flame and poison

Mute to all but fate's betrayal
Strength of mind shall never fail
Their pathetic opposition
Serves my victory total completion

Ja!
I walk upon the edge of reason
Through endless halls of solitude
I call upon the darkest season
Grant me vision and fortitude

Ja!
I call upon the stars and moon
Guide my path to my revenge
I call upon my strength of will
The worms are drowning in my wrath

Ei I darkened era
Brought forth in their reign
Crashing down with terror
My hatred lit aflame

Smothering mountains and meadows
A winter's veil chills the madness
Vengeance knows no mercy
When the souls of the cruel lie powerless

Too late to regret what you have done
Death arrives like a creeping shadow
The dullened blade of sadistic executioners
Falls upon thy worthless wasted marrow

I now await my death
