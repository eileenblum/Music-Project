[Written - Aske]
[Performed - Christgrinder, Aske, Mercurious]

Mountains rise, eclipse the sun
Howling wind calls me on
I come to find that I am lost
A tide to chill my soul to frost

All around us cast a glow
Forged of blinding light
A light to spite the darkness
A light despite we're dead in the night
Dauden I MÃ¸rke

Far across oblivion a state of nonexistence
The purity of zero as we sacrifice our subsistence

A fatal contravention
Diremption Redemption

All around us cast a glow
Forged of blinding light
Now this is true darkness
Together we are dead in the night
Dauden I MÃ¸rke
