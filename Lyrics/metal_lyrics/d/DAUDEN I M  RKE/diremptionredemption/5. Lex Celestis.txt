[Performed - Aske]

Stars burn within our souls
We gaze into the void so cold and
Contemplate our origins
Will consciousness be born again?

Lex Celestis
This is Sentinence

Self aware yet all encompassing
Existential fears outnumbering
Fate leads us all to the same
Black hole radiated into space

Lex Celestis
This is Existence

Stellar winds from a blue white furnace
Sculpting a twisted shape, lifeless astral sweeping fate
Tidal forces - waves of dark matter
Space and time are ripped apart - from a cold galactic heart
