[Performed - Christgrinder, Mercurious]

This domain is a toxic wasteland
Civilization eradicated
Infestation encorpsulation
A post apocalyptic nation

Try as you may you will never escape
No walls to hold you in but now its too late
Confined by law confined by lack of wealth
While worms slather putrid shit on each other's backs

Derelict wraiths of majestic beasts loom around you
Skeletal figures of broken men will soon bid the world adieu
Destitution of the poor breeds violence and despair
Pig council of depravity is leading us nowhere

We must flood the highways with a scalding acid
Release a plague upon the wasted populace
Preserve the remains of this city once proud
Monuments to all they let crumble to the ground
