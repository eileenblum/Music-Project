Ancient ruins clawing at the sky
But cold black earth is their fate
Once strong Obelisks in shards now lie
All that is will decay

Weapons and tomes lay buried in ground
Where lives of men bled dry
I carve through an archive of carnage in the earth
With a sharp-as-knife raven eye
Lo, I have found a crystal orb
Shimmering in midday glare
As my finger grazed that cold smooth sphere
My mind was no longer there....

Battle is raging on the frozen lake
A sheet of ice, cloaked in night
Running red, bleeding life
Thousands of men driven mad by their hate
Mages cast spells at a blinding rate

The clash of swords is deafening
Yielding only to ravenous roar of
Dragons and Wyverns soaring through the sky
No prisoners, legions shall die

Remnants of an Arcane War

Rain of dragons blood adorns my face
The horns of battle, they resonate
Trapped on the field no way to escape
Grasping a sword I join the fray
Felled by a blow I lay, facing stars
A carcass falls to me from afar
A dragon's corpse is falling apart
The spear like horn passes through my heart

I come to in familiar time
But all is fading to a blistering white
In my last tattered seconds of life
I see the orb is gone from our time
