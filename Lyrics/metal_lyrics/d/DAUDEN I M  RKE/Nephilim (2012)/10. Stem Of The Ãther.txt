Of the abyss to the pillars of existence
Before the primal dawn
A particle pervades through a protocosmic haze
The seed of creation

Space is a conduit of lucidity
for all existence in the vicinity
Time is a measure of  its all pervading
force through the aether to the source
Energy is conserved but infinite
The power to change its own cold
Matter as its radiated from the vortex

Entropy infested, a black death of the gods themselves
Will we fade to cold silence, or collapse in fiery hell?
Darker aeons as cosmic strangers, roaming the sky forever

From the chaos of a churning stellar furnace
Cauldron of entropy
Elements arise from the dying stars' cries
Its own crematory

Space is a conduit of lucidity
for all existence in the vicinity
Time is a measure of  its all pervading
force through the aether to the source
Energy is conserved but infinite
The power to change its own cold
Matter as its radiated from the vortex
