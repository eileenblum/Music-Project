Under shifting sands
Lies a forgotten age
Before the prophets came
Degrading men into apes

Predating all taqlid
There was mathematics
Before Sharia
There was a higher law

Fore crescent and star there was an entire night sky
Then came the single thoughts narrowed from broader minds
Antecedent holy war enshrined was peace and life
But now the carcass rips, the putrid stench of lies

Reverse enlightenment, backward evolution
Spawn of the three headed demon of religion
The Jewish plague arrived followed by Christian lies
Then Islam corrupted remaining desert tribes

I've altruistically come to save of all you damned
I am the cross the crescent and the hexagram
Surrender reason, thought, and all your intellect
Now give yourself to me, unto your dying breath

Three strains of one disease, three types of fermenting shit
Comfort for maggots caught in the infesting grip
Three heads of Ravana, demon of oppression
Behold the damage done, progress reduced to none
