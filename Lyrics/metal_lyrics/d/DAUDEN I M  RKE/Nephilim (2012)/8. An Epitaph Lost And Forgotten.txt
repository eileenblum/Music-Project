The death in darkness
for darkness yields no more
than a a cold abysmal vacuity
Where you will lie forevermore

As you fade into the darkness
you will feel ever more alone
until everyone you once knew
are mere rotting flesh and bone

And the longing will grow
and even longing will fade
and you will long for your longing
Inevitably your life you betray

And when there is no glow of light
from your rotting wasted shell
you will fade to oblivion
like an angel dragged into hell

And the monoliths to your memory
may be buried deep in the earth
but a cosmic menace awaits to
destroy and permit no rebirth

Assimilate to the core of the sun
sublimate or collapse into iron
Betrayed by the god of life
Sol exterminates with cleansing fire

Embrace the searing flames
you and them are one in the same
when the flame goes out your life runs out
and darkness is insane

So as you're burning at your pyre
remember men are made of fire
savor the flame of your destruction
so it is by your will you die

Chemical reactions cease
the universe turns black
No higher dimensionality
and no turning back

An epitaph lost and forgotten
Frozen in time
Omega was less than one
Dead wait for eternity to come
