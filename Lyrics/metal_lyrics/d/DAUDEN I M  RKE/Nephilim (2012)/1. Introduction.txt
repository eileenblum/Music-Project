I wander far from the path of the elders
Forging new alliances 'twixt nature and my soul
You have failed to infiltrate my mind
Pure as a diamond in the misty veil of time

Life's not a struggle to survive
You'll never get out alive
So mount your destiny, follow the sign
And ride, ride, ride!

Soaring ever higher faster in a sacred arc
Culminates in final wisdom to unlock the ancient
Arts of prime existence
Come now to me, aether
Come now to me, aether
