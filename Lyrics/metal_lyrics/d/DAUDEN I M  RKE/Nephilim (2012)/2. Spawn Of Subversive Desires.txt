Rise, Rise
Now come forth
Rise....
Now come forth
Rise....

Spawn of subversive desires
Opposer of the Imperium
Possessed by hatred and fire
Dead set on martyrdom

Spawn of subversive desires
Freedom is won by flesh alone
Always reaching higher and higher
I am nothing but my own

With a dull iron axe they savagely split her skull
I had never seen so much blood

We know the lay of these burning twisting lands
Mutiny and revenge will soon be at hand
The more of us the subhuman pigs capture
The more of us shall slit their fucking throats

Our captors have run out of luck
Their tortures have driven us mad
In our rage we dismember the sentry
And vengefully storm into camp

We take revenge without fear
We fuck their throats with their own spears
rampage of swirling flesh and blood
and bile, avenge our past shed tears

Famished by our captors now deceased
Surrounded by so much fresh meat
Gorging their flesh and chugging blood
Now this is what I call a feast

From severed tentacles of defeat
We have become the beast
