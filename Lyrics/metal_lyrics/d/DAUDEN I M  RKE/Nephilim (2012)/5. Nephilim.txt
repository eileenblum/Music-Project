I hereby dedicate my death
To the worms that feed on carrion and flesh
They found my shallow grave, They ate my heart
Scavenging through stale life of the decrepit shell

Soulless divine prey
Beset by the ravenous
Some kill by lust
Some kill by cunning
I lay beside myself
Mourning for eternity
My scattered ash dead to
all warmth of thought

Nephilim
I, Nephilim
Forsaken shell left in the cold

Nephilim
I, Nephilim
Rotten eye sockets mold

Nephilim
I, Nephilim
Never to be whole again

Nephilim
I, Nephilim
This is my requiem

Nephilim
I, Nephilim
Rotting corpse in a shallow grave

Nephilim
I, Nephilim
Battered, beaten, thrice betrayed

Nephilim
I, Nephilim
Never to be whole again

Nephilim
I, Nephilim
This is my requiem

In blackened mind
Elsewhere embraced by candlelight
Treacherous thoughts
I no longer know the taste

Every night they dance in lust
To a song once was mine
Such whispers murmur through the wall
I remain in cursed time
