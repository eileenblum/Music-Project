[Lyrics by Delirium]

Do you remember me,
I'm just a shadow now.
This is where I used to be,
Right here beside you.
Sometimes I call your name,
High on a summer breeze.
What I would give,
To feel the sunlight on my face.
What I would give,
To be lost in your embrace.

I've fallen from a distant star,
Come back, compelled because I love.
I'm caught between two different worlds,
I long for one more night on earth.

Do you believe in dreams,
That's how I found you.
But I can't be with you,
Till you take a leap of faith.
Sometimes I call your name,
High on a summer breeze.
What I would give,
To be the sunlight on your face.
What I would give,
To be lost in your embrace.

I've fallen from a distant star,
Came back, compelled because I love.
I'm caught between two different worlds,
I long for one more night on earth

I've fallen from a distant star,
Came back, compelled because I love.
I'm caught between two different worlds,
I long for one more night on earth
