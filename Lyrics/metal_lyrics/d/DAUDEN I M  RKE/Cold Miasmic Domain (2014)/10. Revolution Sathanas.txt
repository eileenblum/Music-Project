Exalted era
Throne of dementia
Christ corpse leads on
Our time has come undone

We betray
Smash the cross
We betray
Burn the church

We shall take the throne
Throne of all illusion
We shall take the throne for
Satanâs revolution

We shall take the throne
Throne of all illusion
We shall take the throne for
Satanâs revolution

I destroy
Smash the cross
I destroy
Burn the church

I shall take the throne
Throne of all delusion
I shall take the throne for
Satanâs revolution

I shall take the throne
Throne of all delusion
I shall take the throne for
Satanâs revolution

He calls, screams on
I take the black throne
I crush all light
Scatter the shards to hell
