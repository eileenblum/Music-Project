Deep field desolation
A stillborn lamentation
A cold deterioration
Naught left but devastation

This is my resignation
With macabre intention
A self asphyxiation
Falling to isolation

Crawling in stagnation
Writing in pestilence
When my heart stops
A feast for insects

A rope of hopeless dreams
Cradles my deformed skull
A sea of boiling bile
A final desperate call

The torch of sucide
My soul in immolation
A self elimination  
This is annihalation

I shall fall forever
Upon its termination
I will finally reach
My realm of isolation

I am as the serpent, the serpent as me
Autosarcophagic ecstasy
Within the cortex of primal mind
In deathâs vortex for all time

Screaming shadows, a lucid unraveling
A complex scattered maze of broken thoughts
This time there will
Be no escape from the skeletal cage of apathy
Coiled in the sin soiled tail of Satan

Deep field desolation
A stillborn lamentation
A cold deterioration
Naught left but devastation

This is my resignation
With macabre intention
A self asphyxiation
Falling to isolation

The torch of sucide
My soul in immolation
A self elimination  
This is annihalation

I shall fall forever
Upon its termination
I will finally reach
This fucking isolation
