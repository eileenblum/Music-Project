In the hall scathed by lanterns endlessly yearning
To shine vampyrically upon the wanderers
Shifting and drifting figures in passing blindly searching
For something beyond this dimension

A slight peripheral motion catalyzed ethereal sense
Atmosphere materialized as if it was hexed
Dead in their tracks we stood, devoid of all mundanity
Blood churned blood, locked in a dance of mystery

Shadows flash in the back our minds
The essence of each otherâs eternal ties
A glancing blow as we spiral around
Ever closer as if by gravity bound

Take the firmament of night
And rule the stars with me by your side
Spellbound by your majesty
Devour me entirely
