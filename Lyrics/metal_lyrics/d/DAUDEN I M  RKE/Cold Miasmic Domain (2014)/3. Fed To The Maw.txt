Light the dark with a hateful glow
Follow the call of the pitch black crow
A stream of death from my hand
An automatic lethal flow

Fed to the maw
As open they are torn
They breed no more  
Cleansed with ammunition
Purified by our volition

Fires spread like disease
Melting flesh
Immolated
Block by block
Ashes and corpses
Mark my venomous path
This river runs red with blood tonight

Light the dark with a hateful glow
Follow the call of the pitch black crow
A stream of death from my hand
An automatic lethal flow

As roaches crawl they stalked the streets
Spreading their filth and brain disease
Now purged en masse with no sympathy
Kill them all, exterminate their breed
