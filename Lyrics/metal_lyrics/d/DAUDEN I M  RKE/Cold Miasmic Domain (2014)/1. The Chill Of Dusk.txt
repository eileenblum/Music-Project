Life - thy cries grow ever faint
Receding and lost
O Timid and cowering vapor

Frost - A mist as thick as earth
Smother the lakes and lands
Only the fear is real

Dead shall rise from the catacombs
Longing for breath to halt the fade of the soul
Listless yet driven on by void crushing agony
Creatures of the moon ravenously prey on you

When you feel the chill of dusk
Know Iâm approaching
When you feel your life betrayed you
Know Iâm tempting
When you lose your will to live
I feel an instant of reprieve
So take that shotgun to your head
And join me in the realm of death

Dead shall rise from the catacombs
Longing for breath to halt the fade of the soul
Listless yet driven on by void crushing agony
Creatures of the moon ravenously prey on you

When you feel the chill of dusk
Know Iâm approaching
When you feel your life betrayed you
Know Iâm tempting....
