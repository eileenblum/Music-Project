Feeble transmissions float past an aborted world
Smothered in obscurity
Beacons of life now silent

Defiled signals, white noise
The mark of radial chaos
Corrupted broadcasts from cold drifting steel
Dead inside, atrophized
An exiled static horizon

The final hour of man
Vanished from this place
