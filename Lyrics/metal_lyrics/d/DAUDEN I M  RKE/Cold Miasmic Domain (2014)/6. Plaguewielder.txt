In the depths of the forest
Lies a misty town
The year is 1350
Cadavers writhe in rigor mortis
Grotesquely defaced by rats

One by one all companions in my life
Impaled on the stake of pestilence
A beak masked figure arrived too late
Riding off after only a glance

Hard rain bites at my skin so pale
Revealed by the morbid moonlight
Yearning to descend to the crypt my limbs
Give way and I scream one last time

My decayed hands, three fingers left
Grasp the soil I shall become soon
A beautiful ivory blue creeps up my arms
I see myself rot away

Paralyzed and minutes from death
A silhouette of a cat emerges
Convicted of witchery and burned at the stake
And yet he stalks me now

Frigid eyes glowing with an impassive glare
Razor sharp claws of Thanatos
This phantom spreads plague on the damning men of christ
So ends my town, so ends my life
