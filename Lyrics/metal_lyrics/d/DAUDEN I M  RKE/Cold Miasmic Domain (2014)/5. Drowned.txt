Deep sorrow surges on
Lost in the cold embrace
Frozen in mid flow
Beneath currents, torrents, and waves

Timeless eyes clouded grey
Vast extents morosely shine upon me
A fathomless eerie glow
To forever as in aeons ago

Deep sorrow surges on
Lost in the cold embrace
Frozen in mid flow
Beneath currents, torrents, and waves

In the depths I remain to the ocean bound
Motionless in this abyss I softly cry but hear no sound
Adrift in saturated tones of blue, a deluge profound
My flooded lungs sooth my emptiness, ever drowned
