In the vast murky mist
Eons ago they came to exist
To liquidate inferior life

A terror spawned from space itself
Disfigured monarchs of cosmic hell
Their dominion vast and deathly still

Sterilized, sterilized....

âThis is admiral Sphinx to all vessels,
we have detected an unidentified fleet of spacecraft,
configuration unknown, in sector 1184X. We advise all
units to be on high alert, this may be our first contact
with an extraterrestrial species.â

He fell back to Alpha Centauri starbase
Home of ten million lives
All human vessels orbiting outside
Ten thousand metal glimmers in the opressive night

The destroyers came in massive ships, death black
Surrounded by swarms of hideous figures
And as a hellish choir
The eradicators opened fire

âThis is the final log of admiral Sphinx Infidelist
Captain of the Lunar Mare
The human armada has fallen
Soon I will join them
In the darkness of death
And blindly witness my species final hours
They came for us
As those before

To whoever receives this transmission
Thousands of years from now
Quietly die with your planet
Space is the antithesis of life
The natural state of all things is deathâ

With resistance liquefied
The base is blown to diamondshards
Ten million lives extinguished
All survivors hunted down
Four light years away
The moon and earth dance oh so timelessly
Yet all must come to end
And so must all dreams of eternity
They warped space and time itself
To tear both spheres to diamondshards
All trace of humanity drowned in nihilistic delirium
Shockwaves from the blast
Rip the assailantâs fleet to diamondshards
Consumed in their ecstasy to eradicate the human race
