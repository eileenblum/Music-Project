sleep, blissful sleep
A deadly final leap
I shall not weep as i rot to the core

Diving into the deep
Oblivion's slope so steep
The chasm devours my soul forever more

I forsake the curse of this life
Ravines of pain to no longer explore

I choose the path of torments end
Suicide my savior forever more

Why keep on fighting and lying
and hating and crying
and killing and dying
and crawling through
this realm that i abhor

I was told life is a gift
It capsized swift
And sent me adrift
Fuck you all
Burn in hell
Forever more

My veins open wide
They crave their own demise
As my innocence did so long ago
I count my last breaths and turn to the sky
For one last time

The ghost of enlightenment draws so near
Her hair brushes my skin and she disappears
I have no fear, this was my time
After which I'm no longer here
