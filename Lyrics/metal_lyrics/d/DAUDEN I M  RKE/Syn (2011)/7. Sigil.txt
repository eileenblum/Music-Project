In Zerthimon's Name

Eidolon, a thousand shades of the past
Phantasm, this hollow life will be as my last
Spectre, I will kill my transcendence
Revenant, death will be my repentance

A torus of a thousand doors
A ring of a thousand keys
Portals of unfolding force
The lady brings me to my knees

Searing blades weave their dance in my flesh
Dragging me into the fortress of regrets

Atop the spire a demi-plane
A maze to drive a man insane
You know you have been here before
I know you will come here again
