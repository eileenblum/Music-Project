Dying fast, imploding to rest
All below, exploding at last
There is no more
There is no order higher than this final roar
Of stars burning to die

Filaments and voids of
galaxies corrupt gravitational tides
unshackled minds of dead gods
see beyond time
or are they blind?
Has the light passed them by?

Singularites to dead space, the great hollow
Infinity to here is a voyage, from which we follow
Into the night once again

Cosmic death, this is the end
All above, this is the end
There is no more
There is no order higher than this final roar
Of stars burning to die

Embers smolder into infinity....

Enshrined to the stars destined for immortality
Shining to the drone of everlasting spheres
Oscillating between two points of the spacetime
Never to escape, their fate is dead clear

Procreating dualities matter is chained
For upon annihilation it still remains
Infinite circles in the bleak fourth dimension
Of will I break free from this cosmic cage
