I the forsaken, I have forseen
Shades of a dissonance crawling in me
Infetsting me
Corrupting me
Spawning from the realm of my dreams

Visions conjured by the demons of Sol
Scalding black like eyes of Satan's pure coal
I know I must take refuge in dungeons of old

Light they emit
They cannot transmit
Only from the back they are lit
I must commit
I must submit
To pure darkness never to remit

Darkness has caught up with me
Yet I struck out my eyes in pure agony
In times of the light
But now visions are returning
How can they breed without
Relentless rays of the light
Deep in the night
Visions learned to shine
In absence of sight
fire replaced with the cold chill of death
Visions will follow me beyond my staggered last breath

They shear my mind I'm in agony
fraying blackened strands of my life
when will the torment cease
when will i regain my sanity
These corrupted eyes are dead to cleansing light

I am the forgotten exile, the scourge of gods
I contain in me the inverted corrupted ones
I am the torment of parasite and host
they set my mind ablaze with their taunts and wallow in embers

I cannot transcend myself
yet death ravages my living shell again
I cannot fight
Blackened visions are returning
How can I be while they breed in Relentless night?
