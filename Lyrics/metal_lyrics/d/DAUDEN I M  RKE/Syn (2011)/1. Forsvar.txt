Forsvar, forsvar
Threat rises from afar
Forsvar, forsvar
Death of a massive star

Forsvar, forsvar
Night sky blackened scar
Forsvar, forsvar
Extermination beam bizzare

The cosmos has forsaken this world
A gamma ray burst, the death cry of a massive sphere
a mega-parsec away, but far far too near

The unfathomable power from Andromeda
From this assault there is no defense
For our Nemesis arrives at the speed of sight itself
Before space has accounted for our death
