[AssumpÃ§Ã£o | Valls | V.]

(For those who have eyes to see
For those who have heart to bleed
For the rest of the humankind
This is a message for you to keep
We are dead stars
Looking back up to the sky
And now here we are
Completely lost, into the dark)

In this trip around the sun
A billion years from nowhere
We are falling into the edge of the existence

Black holes can be a bridge to another reality
Somewhere there's another you
Here's your dÃ©jÃ  vu

Through the unknown
That never ends
What lies beyond
Is in our hands

I saw
Maybe you will see
Until the end of time
Life must die to live

Dust clouds of infinity
Fluctuations of energy
Living legacy of the past
Missing parts of you and me

Nobody seems to understand
Every end shall be born again
We are the universe
And the universe is in us

Through the unknown
That never ends
What lies beyond
Is in our hands

I saw (I saw)
Maybe you will see (Maybe you will see)
Until the end of time
Life must die to live

What lies beyond the edge of the observable universe?
Could it be the end or the beginning of the route for us?

Singularity
Master of reality
We are the universe
Experiencing itself through consciousness

I saw (I saw)
Maybe you will see (Maybe you will see)
Until the end of time
Life must die to live

I saw (I saw)
Maybe you will see (Maybe you will see)
Until the end of time
Life must die to live

What lies beyond the edge of the observable universe?
Could it be the end or the beginning of the route for us?
