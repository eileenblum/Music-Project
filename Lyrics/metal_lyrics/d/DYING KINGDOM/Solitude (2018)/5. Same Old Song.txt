[V. |V alls | AssumpÃ§Ã£o]

I don't wanna see
I don't wanna say
Time stands still
Never walks away

Everything I know
What I used to be
A man without a soul
Ghost memories

Let me out, let me go
Silent sound, empty soul
Forever around the same tone
Waiting for the day to come

Everlast, it never goes
Empty sound, empty road
Forever around the same tone
Waiting for the day to come

Everything I want to say
Every word fades away
Every memory that I trust
Somehow it turns to dust

Every day I face the same
Every color turns to grey
Have you ever been this close?
Have you ever felt this ghost?

Not enough...
Not enough...

So this is for real
All that I feel
Everlasting same old song
Take this pain away
All that you say
Could be the same old song?

So this is for real
All that I feel
Everlasting same old song
Take this pain away
All that you say
Could be the same old song?

Same old song...

I don't wanna see (Let me out, let me go)
I don't wanna say (Silent sound, empty soul)
Forever around the same tone
Waiting for the day to come

Everything I know (Everlast, it never goes)
What I used to be (Empty sound, empty road)
Forever around the same tone
Waiting for the day to come

Everything I want to say
Every word fades away
Every memory that I trust
Somehow it turns to dust

Every day I face the same
Every color turns to grey
Have you ever been this close?
Have you ever felt this ghost?

Not enough...
Not enough...

So this is for real
All that I feel
Everlasting same old song
Take this pain away
All that you say
Could be the same old song?

So this is for real
All that I feel
Everlasting same old song
Take this pain away
All that you say
Could be the same old song?

Same old song... on and on...
