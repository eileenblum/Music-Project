[AssumpÃ§Ã£o | Valls | V.]

Fuck you all and what you think
Follow me if you want to live
Pride and glory, gold for free
All you need is to believe

You want forgiveness
You need to sell your soul
So many virgins
Hoping you blow your bones

Pay the price
Let's go together to paradise
Crawl and bleed
Your shattered soul belongs to me

Evolutionary sinners
Condemned to walk the earth
If you're not a true believer
The devil is waiting you

Praise our lies
Let's go together to paradise
Can't you see?
Your shattered soul belongs to me

Have you lost your reason?
Don't believe in every word
Questions are true freedom
Paradise no more

Have you lost your reason?
Don't believe in every word
Questions are true freedom
Paradise no more

Pride and glory, gold for free
Follow me if you want to live
Fuck you all and what you think
All you need is to believe

You want forgiveness
You need to sell your soul
So many virgins
Hoping you blow your bones

Pay the price
Let's go together to paradise
Crawl and bleed
Your shattered soul belongs to me

Have you lost your reason?
Don't believe in every word
Questions are true freedom
Paradise no more

Have you lost your reason?
Don't believe in every word
Questions are true freedom
Paradise no more

All my life I've feared (I've feared)
Fanatic creeds, fanatic trust
All my life I've dreamed (I've dreamed)
Paradise no more

(Amem)
