[V. | Valls | AssumpÃ§Ã£o]

Life's like a game
No matter what they say
Never lose your flame
Play hard is the only way

Don't lose your sanity
Your mind is yours to keep
Would you know who's friend or foe?
What's the point?
Where's the goal?

It's time to live your life
No second chance
No way to hide

The more you know
The less you need
This is your new perspective

What kind of destiny do you want for you?
Oh, yeah!
You better watch your crooked steps
You are what you choose

What kind of destiny do you want for you?
Oh, yeah!
You better watch your crooked steps
You are what you choose

Life's like a game
Pay for your own mistakes
Play hard is the only way
Don't lose your flame
So you won't break (Don't lose you flame)

(This is the game...)

Don't lose your sanity
Your mind is yours to keep
Would you know who's friend or foe?
What's the point?
Where's the goal?

What kind of destiny do you want for you?
Oh, yeah!
You better watch your crooked steps
You are what you choose

What kind of destiny do you want for you?
Oh, yeah!
You better watch your crooked steps
You are what you choose

Life's like a game
No matter what they say
Never lose your flame
Play hard is the only way

Don't lose your sanity
Your mind is yours to keep
Would you know who's friend or foe?
What's the point?
Where's the goal?
