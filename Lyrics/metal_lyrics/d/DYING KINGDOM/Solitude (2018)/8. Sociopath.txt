Here comes a peaceful man for the world outside
(For the world outside)
What if I said that right and wrong mean the same?
It's insane

The mask of sanity
Stolen from reality
Nothing standing on his way
The end always justifies the means

Magnetic ability
Justifies delinquency
Dominate and humiliate
Performing acts and changing facts to win

You are not the only one

There's no reaction
Where's the point of sanity?
Discharge of aggression
There are no rules to unleash the beast again

Sadistic impulsive nature
A deep-seated rage
Without shame or guilt
Bad reputation
A heartless human being

Just another sociopath
Another human being (Another human being)
Blinded by his selfish pride
Mimicking empathy (Empathy)

Behind the lies of an actor's life
Faking lack of low self-esteem (Lack of low self-esteem)
Confused path through an empty mind
A childhood mystery

You are not the only one

The mask of sanity
Stolen from reality
Dominate and humiliate
Nothing standing on his way

Just another sociopath
Another human being (Another human being)
Blinded by his selfish pride
Mimicking empathy

Just another sociopath
Faking lack of low self-esteem (Lack of low self-esteem)
Confused path through an empty mind
A childhood mystery

Here comes a peaceful man for the world outside
Alright
What if I said that right and wrong mean the same?
It's insane

The mask of sanity
Stolen from reality
Nothing standing on his way
The end always justifies the means

Magnetic ability
Justifies delinquency
Dominate and humiliate
Performing acts and changing facts to...

Just another sociopath
Another human being (Another human being)
Blinded by his selfish pride
Mimicking empathy (Empathy)

Behind the lies of an actor's life
Faking lack of low self-esteem (Lack of low self-esteem)
Confused path through an empty mind
A childhood mystery

You are not the only one
You're just another sociopath
