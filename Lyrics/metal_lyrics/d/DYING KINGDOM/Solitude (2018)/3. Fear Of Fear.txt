[V. | Valls | AssumpÃ§Ã£o]

For now, there is no place to hide
All I need is to face my pride
Here I am, living day after day
Feeding, growing, running, digging in
Wasting all my life away

It's too cold outside
I didn't choose the hell inside
Surprise, it's doomsday
Take my soul and stay away

I hear voices in my head
And all I wish is to disappear
Last act, last scene
Nightmare wasn't just a dream
It looks pretty real to me

When the world is spinning
And there is nowhere to stay
The blackening begins
So hard to keep it
Seems life will drag me away
My last breath will escape

When walls are closing in
(They) will suffocate me again
Control denied state
Too hard to hold it
I'm going freaking insane
I hear a panic scream

Let me out, settle down
Fear of fear, it's over now
Let me out, settle down
Fear of fear, it's over now

Awakening a monster
Must kill it to live just another day
I've waited, I've wanted
Fear of fear that I have to face

Awakening a monster
Must kill it to live just another day
I've waited, I've wanted
Fear of fear that I have to face

It's too cold outside
I didn't choose the hell inside
Surprise, it's doomsday
Take my soul and stay away

I hear voices in my head
And all I wish is to disappear
Last act, last scene
Nightmare wasn't just a dream
It looks pretty real to me

When the world is spinning
And there is nowhere to stay
The blackening begins
So hard to keep it
Seems life will drag me away
My last breath will escape

When walls are closing in
(They) will suffocate me again
Control denied state
Too hard to hold it
I'm going freaking insane
I hear a panic scream

Let me out, settle down
Fear of fear, it's over now
Let me out, settle down
Fear of fear, it's over now

Awakening a monster
Must kill it to live just another day
I've waited, I've wanted
Fear of fear that I have to face

Awakening a monster
Must kill it to live just another day
I've waited, I've wanted
Fear of fear that I have to face

When the world is spinning (Awakening)
And there is nowhere to stay (A monster)
The blackening begins (Must kill it to live just another day)
So hard to keep it (I've waited)
Seems life will drag me away (I've wanted)
My last breath will escape (Fear of fear that I have to face)

When walls are closing in (Awakening)
(They) will suffocate me again (A monster)
Control denied state (Must kill it to live just another day)
Too hard to hold it (I've waited)
I'm going freaking insane (I've wanted)
Fear of fear that I have to face
