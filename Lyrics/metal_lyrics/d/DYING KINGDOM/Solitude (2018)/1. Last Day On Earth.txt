[Valls | AssumpÃ§Ã£o | V.]

So close to the end, now
Life is fading away
I'm not trying to figure out
What I've done is done 'til the grave

Now I can see through the ashes
Through the shades of grey
This cannot change
There is no one who's to blame

I'm losing my senses
In every breath that I take
All the sounds I'm hearing now
Are the dreams that I've left in my brain

Feeling numb in my hands
Out of blood in my veins
This cannot change
Am I falling from grace?

Last day on earth
Will I return?
My soul needs to rest
No links to the past
Death is my rebirth

Last day on earth
Will I return?
There's no need to ask
Let go of your past
Feel your soul burn

I know that I can't change what I am
I know that I can pray 'til the end

As I'm ending this journey
I'm looking back at my life
So many things I could have done
So vivid, burn in my eyes

Now the circle is done
My soul is free to live again
The name carved in the stone
Is now released from the chain

Last day on earth
Will I return?
My soul needs to rest
No links to the past
Death is my rebirth

Last day on earth
Will I return?
There's no need to ask
Let go of your past
Feel your soul burn

Let it burn
Free your soul
