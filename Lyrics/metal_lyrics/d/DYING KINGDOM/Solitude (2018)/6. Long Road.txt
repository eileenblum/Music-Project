[Valls | V. | AssumpÃ§Ã£o]

I thought I knew it all
Until I hit the road
So many ways to die
And stories to be told

Can you feel the pressure?
Can you see the other side?
There's no direction
I'm running out of time

I keep on searching
For a place to call it home
I'm living on my way
I need to break this dome

Can you feel the pressure?
Can you see the other side?
There's no direction
I'm running out of time

(Long road to nowhere)
Nowhere is all I need
(Don't know where I'm going)
'Cause I don't know where I've been
(Do you need a reason?)
Don't tell me what I need
(Nothing else matters)
We are born to be free
Nowhere is all I need now

(Long road to nowhere)
Nowhere is all I need
(Don't know where I'm going)
'Cause I don't know where I've been
(Do you need a reason?)
Don't tell me what I need
(Nothing else matters)
We are born to be free
Nowhere is all I need

Can you feel the pleasure?
Can you choose another life?
There is no perfection
I'm running out of time

I'll keep on searching
For a place to call it home
I'm living on my way
I need to break this dome

Can you feel the pressure?
Can you see the other side?
There's no direction
I'm running out of time

(Long road to nowhere)
Nowhere is all I need
(Don't know where I'm going)
'Cause I don't know where I've been
(Do you need a reason?)
Don't tell me what I need
(Nothing else matters)
We are born to be free

(Long road to nowhere)
(Don't know where I'm going)
(Do you need a reason?)
(Nothing else matters)
