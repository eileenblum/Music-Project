[AssumpÃ§Ã£o | Valls | V.| Athias]

As the sun fades away from me
The air I breathe gets cold
But I know that my task is here
To protect and serve

(I'll) Take the chance to get along with this
In damnation dance I'll show no fear
Kingdom come it's time to take the crown
There's no room for you in this damn town

Sun portraits the dawn
Shining on my gun
Here I am, the law
Justice bastard son

Here I stay
Waiting for the day
Here I stay
Stepping on my own grave

Now the criminal scum is here
Hungry for the gold
They don't know
They shouldn't mess with me
I guess they were never told

Sun portraits the dawn
Shining on my gun
Here I am, the law
Justice bastard son

I'm glad you are all here
And there's no turning back
I'm glad you are all here
To join this dead man's dance

I'm glad you are all here
There's â there's no turning back
I'm glad you are all here
To join this dead man's dance

Sun portraits the dawn
Shining on my gun
Here I am, the law
Justice bastard son

I'm the bastard son
And you are busted
Soon you'll be gone to hell

As the sun fades away from me
The air I breathe gets cold
But I know that my task is here
I protect and serve

(I'll) Take the chance to get along with this
In damnation dance I'll show no fear
Kingdom come it's time to take the crown
There's no room for you in this damn town

I'm glad you are all here
And there's no turning back
I'm glad you are all here
To join this dead man's dance

I'm glad you are all here
There's â there's no turning back
I'm glad you are all here
To join this dead man's dance
