[Valls | AssumpÃ§Ã£o | V. | Athias]

Is the flame going to last
With all this cold inside my chest?
My fading soul can never rest
Emptiness has filled my past

My dying kingdom
Forever cursed with solitude
My happy ending
Has failed since I

Haven't found you
Haven't found you
Haven't found you
Haven't found you

A single voice inside my head
Begs the strength that once I had
My bitter tears fall in my bed
Where my dreams are lying dead

My dying kingdom
Forever cursed with solitude
My happy ending
Has failed since I

Here I stand in these dead remains
Of what once used to be a man
Can't clean all these dirty stains
Can't clean it

Here I stand in these dead remains
(The curse is done)
Of what once used to be a man
(The sun has gone)
Can't clean all these dirty stains
(And now I'm alone)
Can't clean it

In my dying kingdom

"From the same source I have not taken my sorrow
I could not awaken my heart to joy at the same tone
And all I loved, I loved alone" (Edgar Allan Poe)

My dead empty eyes reflect despair inside
Struggling with the pain that follows me my whole life
As my perspectives die the sun no longer shines
Shadows embrace these lone forsaken sights

My dry lifeless heart has petrified with time
I can't break through these walls to see the other side
As I stare the remains I'm inert to the rain
Feels like falling over and over again

Here I stand in these dead remains
Of what once used to be a man
Can't clean all these dirty stains
Can't clean it

Here I stand in these dead remains
(The curse is done)
Of what once used to be a man
(The sun has gone)
Can't clean all these dirty stains
(And now I'm alone)
Can't clean it

Here I stand in these dead remains
(The curse is done)
Of what once used to be a man
(The sun has gone)
Can't clean all these dirty stains
(And now we're alone)
Can't clean it
