Raising up the foul carcass of war, try helding the lambs to the slaughter once more
The nearer you get, the harder to turn, if you will burn
Greed is the master, an evil desire, crushing the helpless, building the fire

Corroding the mind, corroding the will
Creating aggression, desire to kill
Smelling the hate in the city at night, fueling the anger, who has the right, punish defiance
There's no trial, there's no jury, but soon to taste death in the face of such fury

So talk of tomorrow, their turn to suffer will come, retribution, a cult for the scum
But when the axe is brought down on the neck of the beast
Who knows of the evil, that will be released
