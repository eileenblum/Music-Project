Reality will fade away like your memories,
Like the past.
Numbly kill your precious time,
Hours that should go so fast.
Fearful of the morning,
For pain is all that's there,
A demon is within you,
Created by despair.

The violence pounds like thunder;
In the turmoil of your mind,
Drifting into nothingness,
Leaving your life behind.

Clawing for the surface,
Every breath feels like your last,
The creature's staring at you,
All evil now unmasked.
The system lies before you,
You know now it's rotten to the core,
Pray for your deliverance.
It cannot be this way evermore.

Can't stop the destruction,
Cannot hold the anger in.
Escape into a nightmare,
As you see the end begin.
The horror eats into you,
The terror makes your senses reel,
It can barely be believed,
The coldness that you feel.
