We're sick of the scum, that lurk in the streets
If you commit crimes pray we never meet
The night has fallen, once again we ride to seek and destroy, from us you can't hide

Vigilant riders, hear our roaring bikes, mercy is not given, the Sword Of Justice strikes

The judges are weak, justice must be done, we are the new law, we forgive no one
Rapist and killers are crushed with our might
An eye for an eye, we know what is right
We search the back streets, there the vultures dwell, they shall be the victims, we will give them hell
We have lost loved ones, inside us burns hate, it's pointless running, you must face your fate
