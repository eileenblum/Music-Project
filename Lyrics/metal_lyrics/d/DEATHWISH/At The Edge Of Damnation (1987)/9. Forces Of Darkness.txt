This night will realize your worst fears, bring to life your darkest dreams
Unholy power rising up, to meet your silent screams
If you let the ritual take it's course, light the candles, whisper the names
Soon you'll realize what it means, to take part in such a deadly game

Don't play with the Forces Of Darkness, it's something you can't understand
Invoke the power beyond and you'll be in it's command
Can't you see that you've been cast, in a fool's role
Don't play with the Forces Of Darkness, or you'll pay with your very soul

As the sacred words are spoken, the sacrifice of life is made
And blood falls down upon the altar, underneath the gleaming blade
And you who know so very little, will not realize before it's too late
Now very close you are to eternal damnation, how you are sealing your own fate

Don't you know, you fool, you'll lose your soul to Satan
You fool, you know, you're going to go to hell,
Don't you know, you fool, you'll lose your soul to Satan
You fool, you know, you're going to go to hell

Pure evil appears before you, roaring, terrifying to behold
Can't help but run from the place that's safe, to get away you forget all you've been told
And so you find you're at his mercy, summoned from the darkest depths of hell
Now to return but he'll take you with him, there'll be no one spared, this tale to tell
