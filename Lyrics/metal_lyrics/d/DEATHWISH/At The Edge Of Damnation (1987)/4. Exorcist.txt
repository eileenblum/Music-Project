By the virtue of the power vested in me,
In the name which is above every name,
In the power of the father,
And of the son,
And of the holy ghost,
I exorcise this influence...

Bow down to Satan,
He is the master,
He sensed your fear.
Cry out for help but...
Cry out for help but there's no-one to hear.

Exorcist from the child you tried to expel me,
Now scream out in terror,
Scream out in pain.
Exorcist now that I possess you,
To take your own life is the only way.
Exorcist, even god can't help you now,
Exorcist, can you hear my laughter
There's blood on your hands,
Look at what you've done,
Your wife and your daughter
You've killed and dismembered,
Now start to run.

Thrust the blade deeper,
Hear voices approaching
As you're twisting the knife.
Hear what they're saying
It's the act of a madman,
Who's taken his own life.

Exorcist from the child you tried to expel me,
Now scream out in terror,
Scream out in pain.
Exorcist now that I have left you,
Watch your own life's-blood ebbing away.
