You tell me to open my mind
You misguide
Now I strike
Down your thoughts
And cast out your lies

All of this âmadnessâ
I choose to implore
Thereâs more method
Than reckless
I only crave more

I hold you down to keep me up
Youâre nothing more
Than my instrument for drudge
I feed you nothing short of lies
Denialâs blindfold
My key to climb

It has to be this way
Youâll fall before me
You try to push me away
But now, youâre mine

This world never seems to suffice
I will not
yield your view
Not ashamedâ¦in killing what holds me
Youâll stand here before me,
then youâll pay the price
Like the rest of the cowards
Who tried to be heard

I hold you down to keep me up
Youâre nothing more
Than my instrument for drudge
I feed you nothing short of lies
Denialâs blindfold
My key to climb

It has to be this way
Youâll fall before me
You try to push me away
But now, youâre mine

It has to be this way
Youâll fall before me
You try to push me away
But now, youâre mine
You try to push me away
But now, you're mine
