I see you now
You're running for your life
Bloodcurdling screams
Now you feel my wrath
This marks the end
Your light is soon to fade
The flickering flame
Of your life will be blown out
Your cries for help
My lust is sure to grow
Quickening end
Mercy's not my game
Though your last breaths
I'll savor for the time
They last not long enough
For my blackened taste
Oh, this is the end of you
And fear will run you through
As sharp as daggers edge
Greet blackness, forever more
This is the end of truth
As Death embraces you
Now forever, you're entombed
And now this gore
Slashing wrist and throat
More and more
Your innards spilling out
I think it's time
For this charade to end
I'll twist your will
See just how far you bend
Embrace the pain
It won't last all too long
Realize now
Your helpless, just bow down
Mortified beyond belief
The terror of this world
Sanctify your last breath
Now it's time you die
This is the end of you
And fear will run you through
As sharp as daggers edge
Greet blackness, forever more
Nightmares made real
You fill my knife
With blood, crimson
Greet darkness, eternal
This is the end of truth
As Death embraces you
As dark as midnight's gloom
I'll drench myself
With blood of you
Quench my thirst
I feast on your corpse
