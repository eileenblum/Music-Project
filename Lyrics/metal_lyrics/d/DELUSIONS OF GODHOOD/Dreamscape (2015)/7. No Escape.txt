This is the end of your life
This is the end of all time
Don't bother to look at the sky
Fate was sealed, you will die
Life is but a faux mirage
The picture, a mere facade
What is the meaning of life?
Where are the answers to this strife?

Picture perfect, non-existent
Live life, it's not infinite
Or time will pass you by
In the end, it's all a lie
Refusal, don't just believe
See (for) yourself, what this does deem
What is real, and what is a dream
Reality, not what it seems

And time will be
The end of you
Live while you can
It's not too long
And you will die
Life will fly by
Live out your days
Before it's taken away
And you shall fall
Once and for all
There's no escape
Death is your fate
And you will fall
Once and for all
There's no escape
This is your fate

Live life with no regrets
Nothing to hold you back
You have no time to hold on
To the past
You're a fool
You know nothing
Life has had its way with you
You live like life's forever
But it will end

And time will be
The end of you
Live while you can
It's not too long
And you will die
Life will fly by
Live out your days
Before it's taken away
And you shall fall
Once and for all
There's no escape
Death is your fate
And you will fall
Once and for all
There's no escape
This is your fate
