[feat. Urban Granbacke]Beyond this mortal coil
Beyond the realm of man
Into the abyss
This godforsaken land
Tainted, rancid souls
Roam this plane of damned
Banished, by your God
Whereâs your savior now?

Parish
Torture
Anguish

Molest
Defile
Suffer

Torn, from the light
Consumed by the dark
Infernal treachery
Through this immortal plight
Into the flames
Your spirit, eternal burned
Scorch, melted, ripped from flesh
Affliction evermore

You broke His laws
Now thrown into
The jaws of Hell
Unrest in discord
Now cast into
The mouth of fire
And brimstone you feel
Slaughter of the Soul!

Torn, from the light
Consumed by the dark
Infernal treachery
Through this immortal plight
Into the flames
Your spirit, eternal burned
Scorch, melted, ripped from flesh
Affliction evermore

Torn, from the light
Consumed by the dark
Infernal treachery
Through this immortal plight
Into the flames
Your spirit, eternal burned
Scorch, melted, ripped from flesh
Affliction evermore
