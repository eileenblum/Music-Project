(Rise from the flames)

Rise from the flames
Fury of Thunderaan
Glory awaits
At the turn of the tide

(Rise from the flames)

Rise from the flames
Lord of the Molten Core
Slain to create
Essence of the Firelord

Revived again the Prince of Air and Wind
No longer dormant, the end of restrain
Unleash
Thunderfury

The wind-kissed blade of fury
Tearing wind and flame
Blessed edge of nature's wrath
See the rise of
the Windseeker

Behold he who is older than existence
Older than time
Who has faced both god and Titan
Alike
