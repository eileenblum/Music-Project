My men beside me
Set sail to oceans deep
Nothing to guide me
The wind my only lead

My men beside me
Arrived at new-found beach
Nothing to stop me
Now burn our enemies

Storm the shore
Raise your swords
Push through their ranks
They will die

My men beside me
Fighting to stay alive
My men are falling
But we must go on

Storm the shore
Raise your swords
Push through their ranks
They will die...
