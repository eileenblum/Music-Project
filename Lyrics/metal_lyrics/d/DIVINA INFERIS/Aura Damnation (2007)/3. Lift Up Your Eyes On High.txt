Violent nightmares
Manipulated by a razorlike claw
Bursts of anger
Chaos of this universe
Surrounding spirit and flesh
I am hanging on this cross of life
Like the great Mediterranean Liar did
On his own wooden symbol of charity

On this raging planet
I am indeed a picture
Of the god which has created me

I hope you see
Your loved ones suffer and die
For we are here in this agony
Only to be objects of misery
And when there is nothing else left
We can only hate each other

On this raging planet
I am indeed a picture
Of the god which has created me

From the seed of my father
I was ment to grow
In anger and despair
To celebrate our creator
On the painful altar of flesh

So lift up your eyes on high
And see who hath created thee
