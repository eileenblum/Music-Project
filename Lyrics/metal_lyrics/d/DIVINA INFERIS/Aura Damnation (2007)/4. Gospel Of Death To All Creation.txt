At that time He said to His disciples:

"Go into the whole world
And preach the Gospel of Death to all creation.
He that believes and is baptized
And marked with my symbol will be saved;
He shall sleep through eternities
In the hand of blasphemous pleasures and blackness.
In my name they will witness demons and wonders
With their own eyes; they will speak in new tongues;
They will take up serpents in their hands,
And celebrate the mysteries of their Lord
Which reach beyond the borders of flesh and life,
They will lay their hands on the unfaithful,
And these will fall down
As their bodies would have been contaminated
By the strongest of pests."
