Alone in the dark, I was searching for help
Your shadow, as warm as a kiss, overcame me
Like a light along the way, you've made me hold my head up again
You've saved me with your purity
Your soul in distress was locked in a thorny shell
You were suffocating and slowly drowning
Like the wind along the way, I've made you breath again
I've saved you with my words
So many memories, so many moments shared
The star on the flag, your eyes through the camera, the spider's song

And if along your way, you forget how it feels to love
Read those words again
And if along my way, I forget how it feels to trust
I'll listen to your melody

You leaned on me as I leaned on you
The perfect balance that once collapsed
Cause our eyes were looking in different directions
So many places to discover
And so many things to experiment
We needed time on our own
"Just to see how it feels to leave"
Just to see how it feels to live...
I think we need time on our own
Now we know how it feels to trust
Now we know how it feels to love

And if along your way, you forget how it feels to love
Read those words again
And if along my way, I forget how it feels to trust
I'll listen to your melody
Our melody...

On my way to final recovery
I won't hide my scars no more
Under those rainbow colors
I want to cross it on my own
I feel brave enough right now
And it's partly thanks to you
Please understand, I'm just trying to rebuild myself
Victory will taste better when you do it alone
You've heard the words coming from my heart
Now let me hear the melody coming from your flesh...

Sick of this self-hatred, no body can cure it but me
I know it will take some time but it's worth trying

And if along your way, you forget how it feels to love
Read those words again
And if along my way, I forget how it feels to trust
I'll listen to your melody

Those words again

Alone in the dark, I was searching for help
Your shadow, as warm as a kiss, overcame me... OVERCAME!!!
