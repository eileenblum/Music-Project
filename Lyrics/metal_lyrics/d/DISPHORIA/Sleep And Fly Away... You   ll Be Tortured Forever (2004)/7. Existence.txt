I wonder why for so many years, men had a dream about eternal life
And time has not erased this piece of nonsense
I know it's hard to allow that one day we'll all die
But try to understand why there can be no exceptions to this rule!

Death is eternal and life ephemeral
If you never die and your soul never have a rest
You'll be tortured forever
THE BOTH WILL BE AS ONE!!!

You don't have to wait for anything
No one takes care of us
Infinity is not for the living ones
I won't cry for you! I won't pray for you!

Death is eternal and life ephemeral
If you never die and your soul never have a rest
You'll be tortured forever

I canât, I canât, I canât...
I can't understand why don't you take advantage of your life
Death will always be a mystery
Waiting for deliverance or denying the end
Can't you feel that you are already fuckinâ dead!!!
THE BOTH WILL BE AS ONE!!!

Caught in a trap built by your own mind
Your regret the day you were born
But you don't want to leave those who you love
We are not prepared for death or eternity
BUT FOR NOTHINGNESS!!!

Try to remember how it was before your birth
Death is the same!
Now you know that you just have to pass your life
Sleep and fly away
Your dreams will never betray your soul

You don't have to wait for anything
No one takes care of us
Infinity is not for the living ones
I won't cry for you! I won't pray for you!

This is a story of a man in a laboratory
Who found the fluid of eternal life
And as he injects it into his body
A huge comet collided with the Earth
No one survived to the cataclysm but him!
He was condemned to live alone in an empty world forever
Then he could feel that he was already fuckin' DEAD!
