The light seems to be subtle
As it just make me see the reality
Which I am unable to face
It shows me sides of myself
I have never tried to comprehend
But I am convinced that the light wants to heal me
Nothing it descent according to my depraved mind
Should I enjoy it? All is so incomplete
I do believe!

Following this way towards the cold dead light
I must be guided cause I am too weak

Every sensation has been erased
This conscience does not belong to me
Cause I would be devoured or enslaved
By malevolent ideologies
Brutality is blessed; violence purifying
And it's harmful effect become pure enjoyment

It's just a dream, I have to forget it
Looking at your face one last time...

I took my knife and then I began to tear your body apart
The cold is coming, the light fades away
As you lay lifeless and loathsome

Cold... no sensation of deliverance
Dead... I'll pull the trigger
But... the light shines again

Don't try to get around the obstacles in your life
Cause when the light will die, I'm sure you'll agonize

There's nothing left to hope
There are many things to learn!!!

Looking at your face one last time...
