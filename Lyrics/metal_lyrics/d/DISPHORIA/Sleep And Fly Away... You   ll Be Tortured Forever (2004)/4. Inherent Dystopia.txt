Imagine a world in which we are cursed
We have become numbers and our body is soulless

Every notion is obsolete, thoughts are controlled
Life is just a countdown, there is no destiny

Unable to react
Sentenced to obey

See we're dead; The light doesn't enlighten us
Death is not deliverance, what is suffering?
Knowledge is unknown and we can not communicate

Can you understand, it is not a nightmare
We've lost the sense of life and death still remains

Don't be afraid, you contribute to create this
I will show you that human being is a plague

Can't you see what you have to done today?
The only law is life
And we don't care about unhealthy ways of thinking
Harmony always reigns
Learning to know each other
The nature guides our soul
Which has given what we needed
We fucking refused it!!!

Lost in confusion
The both worlds stand as one
Human is the cause of this inherence

Tasteless!!!
Why must we always annihilate all our gifts
Looking for something better, we propagate the...
Pain!!!

I feel the cold freezing my flesh, taking my soul
If it keeps goin' on, we will be in a dystopia
