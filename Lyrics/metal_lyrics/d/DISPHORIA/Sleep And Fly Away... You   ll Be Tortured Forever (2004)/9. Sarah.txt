She wakes up, heads banging
White ceiling â Toys everywhere
Lights are flickering and burning her eyes
Tears down her face are lashing against the floor
Mom says it's alright
Holding her little hand

She wakes up, head loosing
White walls â Emptiness everywhere
Through the window city is living, life goes on
She leaves her pearls on the ground
The beautiful dolls have lost their hair
Pink rabbit soaks up her tears
Mingled voices fill the air and guide her slowly to bed
Rock her cradle all through the night
Lullabies will provide her against nightmares
Her eyes are distraught, watering
Time has stopped, nothing matters anymore

I'm dreading our meeting
What to say? What to add? How to look at her?
Here she comes, my heart has never beaten so fast
She stretches her arms wide at me
I throw mine out too
I can feel life in her body, in her eyes
I'm not afraid anymore, her neither
I know, she knows
It was so easy, "above all, do not speak"
Blood ties do the rest...

Sarah, the light goes away
Let the putrid blinds vomiting their hate
Life is inside you, death is inside them
Let the abhorrent deafs screaming their rage
Life is in front of you, death is behind them

Tomorrow is not important, we are together
Pink, yellow and black in your drawing complement each other well
Time has stopped again, we create memories
I understand

(Time has stopped again, we create memories
I understand
Time has stopped, hours are still running
But I understand
Beautiful little girl, your eyes filled with life
I understand so well now
I do understand, I understand so well)

Time has... STOPPED

Time has stopped, but hours are still running
I understand
Beautiful little girl, your eyes are filled with life
I understand so well now, I understand so well

She wakes up, head loosing
White walls â Emptiness everywhere
Through the window city is living, life goes on
She leaves her pearls on the ground
The beautiful dolls have lost their hair
Pink rabbit soaks up her tears
Mingled voices fill the air and guide her slowly to bed
Rock her cradle all through the night
Lullabies will provide her against nightmares
Her eyes are distraught, watering
Time has stopped, nothing matters anymore

I'm dreading our meeting
What to say? What to add? How to look at her?
Here she comes, my heart has never beaten so fast

Dance, like ladybugs in the sky
Grow, like blooms in a garden
Spring forever, love feeds us
LOVE FEEDS US
LOVE FEEDS US
LOVE FEEDS US
LOVE...
FEEDS...
US...
