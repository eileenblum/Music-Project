I canât believe I come from human race
Herd of immature creatures you all deny your roots
Tell me why your only goal is extending your shabby lives
Cause you canât live without that prison called CIVILIZATION!

Pray! Pray! Already dead...

Yet I have tried to be one of them â FAILURE!!!
This fuckinâ shallow world compels you to lie
Cause you wont blossom is this burial place
Iâve tried to suggest you to make up your mind
You lay to yourselves... You must be erased

Dead! Dead! Already dead...

Yet I have tried to kill one of them â FAILURE!!!
Am I insane?
I want to feel alive, stronger and free, recover my personality
But I wonder why youâre afraid of thinking by yourselves...
I AM INSANE!!!

Why donât you want to face the truth?
Nature is your mother and you donât know anything about
One day you will pay for all what you have done
Pieces of shit I hope you will soon be ERASED!!!

I want to see you bleeding and crying
I can not constrain my rage
Youâre less than parasites
I am blinded â Blinded by hatred
I am not one of yours
I refuse to be humane
But I don't think about suicide
Iâm hating you for surviving
Hating you preserves me from
My own destruction...

I canât believe I come from human race
Herd of immature creatures you all deny your roots
Tell me why your only goal is extending your shabby lives
Cause you canât live without that prison called CIVILIZATION!

Hating you preserves me from my own destruction
