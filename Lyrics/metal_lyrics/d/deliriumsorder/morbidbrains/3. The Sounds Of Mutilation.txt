The needles growing out of your heart
They designate towards the fire
Distorting your body, penetrating your eyes
Exploding your flesh to the air

And these sounds of mutilation will be heard
and felt in every shivering body
As they can't escape the feeling
Vision of what is it like to be mutilated

The chains are all now opened
And you are freed to flee
The sanitarium has opened gates for you
Because you are insane enough

No more suffering, it's everything fine
So they granted you a moment alone
It's just you and the knife
You can't prevent yourself from taking it

The Sounds of Mutilation
The Sounds of Mutilation
The Sounds of Mutilation

The Sounds of Mutilation
The Sounds of Mutilation
The Sounds of Mutilation
The Sounds of Mutilation

Your veins are cut wide open
And you are waiting for death
This is the freedom you wanted
Pain is your heaven

They will tear your soul apart
There's no light at the end of the tunnel
Only another knife waiting for you
to cut
