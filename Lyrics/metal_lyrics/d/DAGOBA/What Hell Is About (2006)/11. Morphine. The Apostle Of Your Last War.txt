Can you hear the dead's song?
Can you hear this song?
Guided by voices, echoes inside
Dealing with evil, satanic symbols
The oldest relics, bleeding icons
Potential subject of flesh and bones...

Morphine - the apostle of your last war
Morphine will take your breath away

Surrender everything, even if it's hard
Forget the things you had, forget me, don't be sad
Try not to sleep, enjoy your fall
Death is coming slowly, crawling...

Morphine - the apostle of your last war
Morphine will take your breath away

Guided by voices, echoes inside
Dealing with evil, satanic symbols
The oldest relics, bleeding icons

Morphine - the apostle of your last war
Morphine will take your breath away

Morphine - the apostle of your last fight
Morphine will take your breath away
