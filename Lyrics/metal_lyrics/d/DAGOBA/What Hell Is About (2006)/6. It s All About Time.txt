They told me bullshit like this:
"The best things are still to come..."
I heard you without listening
And now, it's time for me to talk:
"Yes sir, I'm gonna die, don't you wanna know what death is like?
Nothing, there's nothing beyond
I cannot believe in stupid thoughts
I drank too much, I loved too much
I enjoyed life and I listened to rock, so
Yes Father, I'm gonna die and you know what?
I'm not gonna cry."

It's all about time...
Why try to live when we're all born to die?
It's all about time...

We spent great times together
I was yours (like others've been before)...
It seems like it's been too much time together
But now this is over
C'mon girl, leave me alone, you waited so long for this moment
Go away and please don't worry
You left behind you a harder man
I've tried your sister and your mother too
I loved you so much and I hated you too, so
Yeah baby, leave me alone but you know what?
I'm not gonna cry

It's all about time...
Why try to live when we're all born to die?
It's all about time...

Hey bro! I'm gonna die...
I just wanna see what death is like
Nothing, there's nothing beyond but
I never felt like I was strong
I drank enough, I loved enough
I played the game and I did my best, so
Hey bro, I'm gonna die and you know what?
I'm not gonna cry

It's all about time...
Why try to live when we're all born to die?
It's all about time...
