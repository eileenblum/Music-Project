If you're an angel, where are your wings?
Who introduced me to the man you' re not?

I rob the tomb I'm living in
I break the coffin inside
I rob the tomb I'm living in
And free my mind...

It seems like dead men now walk
Artifacts made with rotten flesh

I rob the tomb I'm living in
I break the coffin inside
I rob the tomb I'm living in
And free my mind...

My body moves, my heart still beats
Is the goal only to live?

I rob the tomb I'm living in
I break the coffin inside
I rob the tomb I'm living in
And free my mind...
