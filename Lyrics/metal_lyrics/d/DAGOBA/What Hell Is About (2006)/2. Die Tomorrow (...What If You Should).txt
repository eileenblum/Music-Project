After life: disasters or answers?

Hey buddy, nothing is eternal
Time's running out and never hides its betrayal
Becoming older and older again to finally die
People lie but still they cry and no one knows what's wrong or right

What if you should die tomorrow?
Does Eden still seem so pure?
What if you should die tomorrow?
Die tomorrow, then tell me what's there after life: disasters or answers?
The tomb you're in is not that deep...

A lifetime to ensure you're forgiven
You point your finger at things hopeless
Thinking the best is yet to come
What if darkness was the end, the end?

What if you should die tomorrow?
Does Eden still seem so pure?
What if you should die tomorrow?
Die tomorrow, then tell me what's there after life: disasters or answers?
The tomb you're in is not that deep...

What if the cross was inverted?
What if morality was written by a cowardly man?
What if Hell was a paradise?
What if our time on Earth was all that we had?

What if you should die tomorrow?
Does Eden still seem so pure?
What if you should die tomorrow?
Die tomorrow, then tell me what's there after life: disasters or answers?
The tomb you're in is not that deep...
