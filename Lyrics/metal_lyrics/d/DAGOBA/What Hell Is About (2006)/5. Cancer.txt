Wasted times, a kind of crime
Another way to slowly die
I so much regret the regrets...
Memories torn into pieces
When everything became diseased
That couldn't be life... life

The touch that I adored
This love that couldn't be ignored
Your hand in mine
A touch of heaven, heaven

Stars also die...
The astral brightness stops shining
I hope you'll reach your paradise
Star, why did you leave me?
The astral brightness stops shining
Tonight I cannot stop crying...

Wasted times, a kind of crime
Another way to slowly die
I so much regret the regrets...
Acid rain, tears inside
All consuming, hungry monster
Love is a cancer, a cancer

The touch that I adored
This love that couldn't be ignored
Your hand in mine
A touch of heaven, heaven

Stars also die...
The astral brightness stops shining
I hope you'll reach your paradise
Star, why did you leave me?
The astral brightness stops shining
Tonight I cannot stop crying...
