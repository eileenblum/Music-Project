I still feel the touch of your skin on mine
Still got the sound of your voice in my mind
I walk alone, as everyone...
I never thought this road's so long

The war within
And other things...

I walk away, as everyday
I never saw the sky so grey

Yeah I run away
Our world collapses, the end is near
I cannot stay
Yeah I fade away
And I leave the best of us, the war within...

We ate the fruits, protected by the leaves
Carved our names on this tree that died
The river we'd cried drowned the memories
I walk alone... to the other side

The war within
And other shit

Yeah I run away
Our world collapses, the end is near
I cannot stay
Yeah I fade away
And I leave the best of us, the war within...
