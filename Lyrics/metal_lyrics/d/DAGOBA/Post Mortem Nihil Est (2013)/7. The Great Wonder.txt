Time has cometo lose it all
Fire and oceans entwine,
Memories fading away like shooting stars
The party makes me lose control...
the world is set on fire
But I don't care where the Hell I'll be driven!

The great wonder
What's coming after?
The great wonder
It's all that we'll bring when the game is over...

I'll try to mak it fine for a last time
The upside is down
Death is a round
But I won't stop hitting the ground...

I call the rain and watch the storm
I see that everything's lost (but)
I'm dancing after all...

Time has come to lose it all
I don't care where the fuck I'll be driven!

The great wonder
What's coming after?
The great wonder
It's all that we'll bring when the game is over...

I call the rain and watch the storm
I see that everything's lost (but)
I'm dancing after all...

The great wonder
What's coming after?
The great wonder
It's all that we'll bring when the game is over...
