Within a sight, in a silent night
The light's been switched off.
No motions defile, life's now above.
No pale reflexion, I guess I ran straight to the dark
I close my eyes, now I come into the realm black...

A journey in the nothingness,
The third hemisphere.
I expected fire and flames,
I only got fear.
I'm part of the world, where everything begins again
I see the roots growing, and the sky's falling...

I see the world from down below
I, the buried crowd I stand alone

The sky's falling
For whom is marching to the realm black!
The sky's falling
For whom is marching to the realm black!

The prayers are gone
But their words don't let me in.
Tears of the living
Drench The ground I'm living in.
I hear no echoes, I can even feel
There's a crack in the grave
But no light in the realm black.

I see the world from down below
I, the buried crowd I stand alone

The sky's falling
For whom is marching to the realm black!
The sky's falling
For whom is marching to the realm black!
