Judgement day was yesterday
Innocent and guilty passed away
Long live the king of the wasteland
This is the story of a dead man

No doom for the downward
No more peace, no more war
The sky ain't the limit
The sun won't shine indeed

Riding beside Lord Humungus
The loneliest ghosts dance among us

End of the world
Promises sound like simple words
Armageddon
Cease everything you've been relying on
