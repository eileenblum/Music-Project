With the flow came the fail
Hell on Earth , sea wolves Heaven
You better know how to sail
Lands concede everything to the ebb

Kiss me
Fear the beast with the empty sight
Kiss me
(Its) shadow chasing the sunlight

I embrace the wave as I'm sinking in
Diving into an endless waterfall...

Sea monster. Legendary.
Turns the seas into chaos.

The world get drowned. Silent and deep.
In a single move hides the sun with is fin.
Frozen blood, liquid rage
Darkest eyes, eight legs

Kiss me
Fear the beast with the empty sight
Kiss me
(Its) shadow chasing the sunlight

I embrace the wave as I'm sinking in
Diving into an endless waterfall...

With the flow came the fail
Hell on Earth, sea wolves Heaven
You better know how to sail
Darkest eyes, eight legs
