See the entire valley bleed
The rivers hemorrhaging into the sea.
I swear my Empire will never fall
Death's coming but I missed the call

Warewolves, demons and vampires
Eternity, my life ain't like a fire
Nothhing, no one can die it out
I'll show you all what fear is about

Down! The sky can fall
Down! Throw the world deep in a hole
Law! Only one thing I know
Law! Coz' I lived by the sword
I will die by the sword

See the entire world bleed
The river's suicide into the seas.
I said my empire will never fall
Death can wait till' kingdom come.

Down! The sky can fall
Down! Throw the world deep in a hole
Law! Only one thing I know
Law! Coz' I lived by the sword
I will die by the sword.
