Son of a ghost
Raw is the loss

Lifeless...hamless
Immortal...after all
Invisible...invincible

Lost! In the shade of my eyes
Fear the damned ! Cross me and die!

You'll find a reason
To come to me
I'll give you answers (when)
You'll say that everything is over.

Inside...hazy sight
Darken...the longest night
Injurious...impervious

Lost! In the shade of my eyes
Fear the damned! Cross me and die!

You'll find a reason
To come to me
I'll give you answers (when)
You'll say that everything is over.

Lifeless...harmless
Immortal...after all

Lost! In the shade of my eyes
Fear the damned! Cross me and die!

You'll find a reason
To come to me
I'll give you answers (when)
You'll say that everything is over.

Son of a ghost
Raw is the loss
Son of a ghost
For forever and ever lost.
