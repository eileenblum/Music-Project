A thousand reasons, I guess we're worth it
The world drops us all in loving memories...

Extinction, day one. A mass funeral.
The friend meets the enemy, together but lonely...

I can feel, I can hear,
I can stay and I can wiper ur tears away
We can talk, we can cry, even tryin' to fly...
Yes we die.

Die! All of em, and you and
I! All of em, and you and
I! Yes, we
Die...

Breathing to breathless, the end takes all away
The father holds the son, and all I can say

I can feel, I can hear,
I can stay and I can wiper ur tears away
We can talk, we can cry, even tryin' to fly...
Yes we die.

Die! All of em, and you and
I! All of em, and you and
I! Yes, we
Die...

A thousand reasons, I guess we're worth it
The world swallows us all in loving memories...

I can feel, I can hear,
I can stay and I can wiper ur tears away
We can talk, we can cry, even tryin' to fly...
Yes we die.
