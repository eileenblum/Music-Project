Walking alone in the shade
No color and no sound when you're dead

Be all you can be as a man
One in a million in Hades's den

Oblivion is for the living!
Oblivion is for the living!

You know that life is a sore
What you meant to be we
you can't breathe anymore

When everything's lost you can't even cry
That's how we send a shit in the afterlife

Oblivion is for the living!
Oblivion is for the living!

You know that life is a sore
What you meant to be we
you can't breathe anymore

When everything's lost you can't even cry
That's how we send a shit in the afterlife

You know that life is a sore
What you meant to be we
you can't breathe anymore
