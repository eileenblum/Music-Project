Then the great cold decides to fall
Consuming hopes likes nothing before
Time sweeps us away like fuckin' flakes
And leaves us all frozen at best.

When winter falls on us all !!

Fear the ultimate season approach
In a ocean black cape it comes
Reversing the rational, burning the organic
Hysteria turns to panic...

When winter falls on us all !!

Winter brings us across the light
And syphons us away to the end of time

Then the great cold decides to fall
Burning our lives, crushing 'em all
There's no light away, no light away
When the endless night comes.

When winter falls on us all !!

Winter brings us across the light
And syphons us away to the end of time

Embrace the era of the sinister
You're harmless, feed the rage of the disaster
Enthrone Lord of the Chaos and the unknown
let's get frozen for forever, and ever...

When winter falls on us all !!

Winter brings us across the light
And syphons us away to the end of time

There's no light away, no light away
When the endless night comes.
There's no light away, no light away
When winter comes...
