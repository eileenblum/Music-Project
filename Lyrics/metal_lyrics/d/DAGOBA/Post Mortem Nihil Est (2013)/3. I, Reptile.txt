Massive beasts weapons alive
Billions of ton scales triple
Gigantic lizards ruled the world
In a second disappeared forever

Jurassic kingdom turned to ashes
Time of the dragons is over

I, reptile
Already died
See you now
Laying by my side

The world you know is gone
Drinking its own blood
The world you know is gone
With nothing to rely on

Your bones get engraved onto stones
Your body now feed the concrete
Jurassic kingdom turned to ashes
Your world improved to nothing

[2x]
I, reptile
Already died
See you now
Laying by my side

The world you know is gone
Drinking its own blood
The world you know is gone
With nothing to rely on

The world you know is gone (the world you know is gone)
The world you know is gone

The world you know is gone
In a second disappeared forever

I, reptile
