I will never regret
Nothing at all till i die
I ain't got no remorse
Remorses are for the weak

You tried to stop me
You fool better listen to me
The only thing that's chasing me
Is chasing you, is chasing us all

Time is running out
Gimme a break
Not time for me to die

Half damn life
Keep on rocking to the checkpoint
Half damn life
Keep on rocking till I'm done

Lion heart, iron fist, a better man
I feel like a king in the dragon's den

Time is running out
Gimme a break
Not time for me to die

Half damn life
Keep on rocking to the checkpoint
Half damn life
Keep on rocking till I'm done

I ain't got no regret
Ain't got no remorse
Even if it's chasing me
I know it's chasing us all...

I will never regret
Nothing at all till the end
I ride in hell
But I'll die as a man

Time is running out
Gimme a break
Not time for me to die

Half damn life
Keep on rocking to the checkpoint
Half damn life
Keep on rocking till I'm done

Half damn life !
