All that they said
Ain't truth or lie
When time has come
For a fuckin' last sight

Morning light !

Not a quiet dead
I'm still staring to the sky
Not a sudden plague
Hold back my life

Morning light !

I can see the morning light
The morning light...

Bells ring for anyone
It comes to me, final breakdown
Bells ring for you and I
Hear the crows until we die...

Death is riding by my side
Freezing my bones
Will I see this fucking light
When I'll be gone ?

I can see the morning light
The morning light...

Bells ring for anyone
It comes to me, final breakdown
Bells ring for you and I
Hear the crows until we die...

All that they said
Ain't truth or lie
When time has come
To say goodbye

I can see the morning light
The morning light...

Bells ring for anyone
It comes to me, final breakdown
Bells ring for you and I
Hear the crows until we die...

Reverse all...
