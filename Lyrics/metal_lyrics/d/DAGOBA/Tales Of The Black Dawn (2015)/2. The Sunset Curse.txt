The sun is falling down
The day's showing it's bound
Stars rise from the ground
Daylight is red
Sky's on fire
Here comes the sunset curse

What's wrong, what's right ?
No answers, no lies
Ancient fears remained
By the sunset curse

The sunset curse...

We won't belong to the night time, a lifetime
We won't belong to the night time of our lives...

There's no more sun
The day is over
Millions of stars,
Millions of demons eyes
Daylight is dead
Sky turned to black
We all get tricked
By the sunset curse

The sunset curse...

We won't belong to the night time, a lifetime
We won't belong to the night time of our lives...

We all get tricked
Drowned in the night
When darkness falls
We fall with it

We all get tricked
Drowned in the night
When darkness falls...
The sunset curse
