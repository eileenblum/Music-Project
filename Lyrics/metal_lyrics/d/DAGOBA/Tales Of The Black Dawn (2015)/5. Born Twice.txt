Rotten flesh, lion strength
Running man starving for brains !

I don't care, who you are
And i don't give a fuck who i was !

To die once
To recover

Born twice
Fading away is not to die
Born twice
Fading away it's time to die

Not alive but still breathing
I'm chasing, I'm seeking, I'm killing
No rest for the weak !

To die once
To recover

Born twice
Fading away is not to die
Born twice
Fading away it's time to die

Retribution against you, and you all
Reign of the living has gone away

To die once
To recover

Born twice
Fading away is not to die
Born twice
Fading away it's time to die
