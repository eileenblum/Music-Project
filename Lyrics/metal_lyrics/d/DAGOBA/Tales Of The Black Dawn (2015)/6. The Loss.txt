Succumbing to your crazy sight
What should be flesh is liquefied

Watching me with your hazy eyes
You grip me I solidify

I don't mind
I may be falling
I feel inside
The loss is coming

I don't want a glimpse
I want it all
If you decide to try me out

I don't mind
I may be falling
I feel inside
The loss is coming

But I know it's time
To get loose
To get loose...
Yeah we had it all
You and I : the rise and fall...

I don't mind
I may be falling
I feel inside
The loss is coming
