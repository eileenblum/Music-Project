Upside down, roof on the ground
There's a curse, pulses ceasing
Taste the killing, your blood is mine
Romantic kisses till you decline

O, inverted world
Dawn replaces dusk

I feel dead inside
My heart is beating while you die

The oldest bloodline of frozen veins
Living the night, undead
Charming and cruel, eating with style
You may run away but you can't hide

O, inverted world
Dawn replaces dusk

I feel dead inside
My heart is beating while you die

Your blood is mine, the sweetest wine
Kissing your neck till you decline...

O, inverted world
Dawn replaces dusk

I feel dead inside
My heart is beating while you die
