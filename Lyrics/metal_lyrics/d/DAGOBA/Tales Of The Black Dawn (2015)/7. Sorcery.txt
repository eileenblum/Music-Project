Wickedness, belief, faith
All shits guided by fear
Attractions, suffering, lies
You all know what I'm talking about...

Blood, spurs, feathers
No money for a rite

Dominion - sorcery - possession

See the world in another way
No white or black, let's see what's grey
See the world in another way
Where nothing is real, they say...

Naked bodies dancing around
Flaming voodoo signs, evil sights
A life taken for a rebirth
Sacrifices in early dusk

Dominion - sorcery - possession

See the world in another way
No white or black, let's see what's grey
See the world in another way
Where nothing is real, they say...
