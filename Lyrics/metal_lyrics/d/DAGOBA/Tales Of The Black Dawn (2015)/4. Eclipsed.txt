Can't see the sun
Can't feel its heat
There's something missing
The sky is blackening

Eclipsed !

All this was certain
Certain and obvious
The power is out
Now you're gone...

Eclipsed !

Universe down
All turned to black
All lights are gone
Fire becoming stone

Gone by too fast
Becoming obsolete
When time has come
Eclipse has begun

Universe down
All turned to black
All lights are gone
Fire becoming stone

Can't see the sun
Can't feel your heat
There's something missing
The sky is blackening...
