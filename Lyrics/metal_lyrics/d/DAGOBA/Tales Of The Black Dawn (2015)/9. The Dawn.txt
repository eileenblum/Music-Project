Frozen heart
Always waiting for the thaw
A blind man in the night
Praying for the dawn

A mourning life
The sunshine is gone
Walking in the dark
To reach the dawn...

The light went out
With the nightfall
Nobody died
But life is gone

The palest light
The morning to come
Surviving the night
Waiting for the dawn

The light went out
With the nightfall
Nobody died
But life is gone
