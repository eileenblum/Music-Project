There's blood offshore, neverending war...
Walking in the ashes of a glorious past
Cease the days and legends, stories of an enternal night
The princess' been raped and the king should be killed

There's blood offshore
Death's starving, she Wants some more
Neverending war...
Can't tell the reasons but the peace is gone...

Far away sons are dying, a common new on our tv screen
Brother's tearing for a land that gods are blessing
Hands are shaking and bullets are whizzing, are whizzing

There's blood offshore
Death's starving, she Wants some more
Neverending war...
Can't tell the reasons but the peace is gone...

The warfield as only shelter
Spreading blood, ignorant soldiers
Fearing nothing, Heaven will embrace 'em all
Amnesty means the sky to fall...
The sky to fall...

Gone war as a living, reason's
Gone war as a living, reason's

There's blood offshore
Death's starving, she wants some more
Neverending war...
Can't tell the reasons but the peace is gone...
