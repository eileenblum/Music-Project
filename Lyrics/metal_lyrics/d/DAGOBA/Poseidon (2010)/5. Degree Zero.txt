You shiver and take a look up to the sky
So do it, bring the light through this blackened sky...

Let's stare at the sun
For a while let's feel alone

All solutions' we been considered
And us to die, smiles turn to cries under a blackened sky...

Let's stare at the sun
For a while let's feel alone
Let's stare at the sun
For a while let's feel alone

Let's stare at the sun
For a while let's feel alone
Let's stare at the sun
For a while let's feel alone
