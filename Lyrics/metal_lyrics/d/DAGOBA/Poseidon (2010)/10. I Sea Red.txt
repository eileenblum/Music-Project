The armageddon is near
Eyes open wide to face it
Life surrenders as ever
The end brings us back down to earth

I wanna ride beside the darkest reaper
Cease my days amont the living
I wanna ride away with the grand killer
And leave behind all human beings

I see red/regretless
I see red/worshiping death
I see red
I fear nothing and i'm regretless
I see red
Obscure emphasis I'm calling death...

Only one way born, millions to die
Quiting life without a goodbye
Memories in a silent cry
I tear off the phoenix wings
for a very last time...

I wanna ride beside the darkest reaper
Cease my days amont the living
I wanna ride away with the grand killer
And leave behind all human beings

I see red/regretless
I see red/worshiping death
I see red
I fear nothing and i'm regretless
I see red
Obscure emphasis I'm calling death...
