Devil's Triangle...
Devil's Triangle...

Spreading your legs for a pagan celebration
You want me to give you satisfaction
Stereo delight, hold me down to the sins empire
Your tongues entwine, I feel your bodies both left and right...

You want some ?
Come get some !

Let's feed our lust
Hear the moaning symphony of three of us
We won't be the first
So give me something sweeter than angel dust

Devil's Triangle...
Devil's Triangle...

We got DNA to share, I got godesses on spare
Luxury, plenty of targets
Drowned into sins dwell... Who's next ?
Stickin' it in, everything I can
Fleshes are shaking, mixing fluids and sweat
Fantasy turns to reality, and you let me choose wish for you I'll be in

You want some ?
Come get some !

Let's feed our lust
Hear the moaning symphony of three of us
We won't be the first
So give me something sweeter than angel dust

Devil's Triangle...

We got DNA to share, I got godesses on spare
Your tongues entwine, I feel your bodies both left and right...
Let's feed our lust
Hear the moaning symphony of three of us
We won't be the first
So give me something sweeter than angel dust
