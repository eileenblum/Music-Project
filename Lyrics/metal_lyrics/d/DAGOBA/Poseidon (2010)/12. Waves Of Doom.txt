I've been drifting for all my life
There's nothing left I wanna live, this ain't goodbye
Did you ever see a ship coming back from the seven seas of Rhyes ?
Sinking in the abyss with pride

Tune is coming to get drowned
I feel their caresses : Judgement comes !

Waves of doom
Forever stroke the sailors' tombs
Waves of doom
Fill my ultimate room
Waves of doom
Forever stroke the sailors' tombs
Waves of doom
Fill me in, bring the hellbourne...

I've met some golden hearted people
Taken for granted
But gold get throwned into the sea...
Now I'm not seeking for a treasure chest
Over and over again, the quest is over...

Time is coming to get drowned
I feel their caresses : Judgement comes!

Waves of doom
Forever stroke the sailors' tombs
Waves of doom
Fill my ultimate room
Waves of doom
Forever stroke the sailors' tombs
Waves of doom
Fill me in, bring the hellbourne...
