Some of us are made to live, some of us are made to dream
Some of us are made to kill, we're all about to die
There's something, somewhere, a risky place, a kind of hell
Attractive, impressive, where freedom dwells

Some of us are made to live, some of us are made to dream
Some of us are made to kill, we're all about to die...

I leave behind the quiet sea to join the place where real storms are
I feel the warmth of a new stream, healing the hips of my deepest dream...
Tomorrow comes, the march is on
Ocean's breeze... Freedom teases me on

There's something, somewhere, a kind of hell
Attractive, impressive, where freedom dwells

Surrending everything, I got to go
To somewhere called a new life, version 2.0
Surrending everything, I got to go
To somewhere called a new life, version 2.0

Some of us are made to live, some of us are made to dream
Some of us are made to kill, we're all about to die...

I leave behind the quiet sea to join the place where real storms are
I feel the warmth of a new stream, healing the hips of my deepest dream...
Tomorrow comes, the march is on
Ocean's breeze... Freedom teases me on

There's something, somewhere, a kind of hell
Attractive, impressive, where freedom dwells

Surrending everything, I got to go
To somewhere called a new life, version 2.0
Surrending everything, I got to go
To somewhere called a new life, version 2.0
