A charming melody coming out from a golden cave
You shiny diamond in the sea
Swinging swimmers, of skin and scales
The smell of eternity, the sound of atrocity...

Bootyshaking on the beach, hidding your leach
You serve us everything you got :
Your stupid laughes, kinkiest smiles...
Enslaving the world on doggystyle

My heart is breaking, your lips are moving, your ass is shaking, my mind is changing
Hypnotizing witch can't crush my will
For those about to love
For those about to love : I reject you

Dead lion reef
Did you ever know that the perfect drug got tits ?
Dead lion reef-oh !
Your heaven, I'll never run on ashore...

You're so wet, my crown is rusting
But you cannot make black turns to pink
Do you really think that a lion needs a cage ?
I'm a fuckin' pirate, not your slave

Still bootyshaking while I'm leaving
You served me everything you could
Your stupid laughes, loss of time
I took the part I wanted : the doggystyle

My heart is breaking, your lips are moving, your ass is shaking, my mind is changing
Hypnotizing witch can't crush my will
For those about to love
For those about to love : I reject you

Dead lion reef
Did you ever know that the perfect drug got tits ?
Dead lion reef-oh !
Your heaven, I'll never run on ashore...

For those about to love
For those about to love : I reject you

Dead lion reef
Did you ever know that the perfect drug got tits ?
Dead lion reef-oh !
Your heaven, I'll never run on ashore...
