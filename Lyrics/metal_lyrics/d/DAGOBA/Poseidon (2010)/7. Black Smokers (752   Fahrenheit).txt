Once again I'm drifting, I'm falling
Once again, you hold me down and nothing's time again
I'm drifting, I'm falling once again
It's like everything around me crushes me down

Once again I'm drifting, I'm falling
Once again, you hold me down and nothing's time again
I'm drifting, I'm falling once again
It's like everything around me crushes me down
