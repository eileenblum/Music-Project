Loving not anymore
Hopin' no more
The prince charming you'll never
Wait no more
A pornstar you were
A star you wish you were
Your honor's gone
Away from the woman you were

Porn scars !
Mutilated til' your mind
Porn scars !
Your life will never be like before

Deep in your flesh
You still feel the crush
This sweet men's gift
You've so much drunk or licked
Thousands of positions
Have broken your body
None opposition
"May my soul be broken..."

Porn scars !
Mutilated til' your mind
Porn scars !
Your life will never be like before
