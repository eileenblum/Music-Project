This is a rebirth !
Sharp teeth introduced in me
My red life's drunk, energizer !
From vampirism to revelation
My lifetime resumed in a second...

May...seconds be hours !
May...my flight be higher !

Death's like a b-side of life
Obscurity is the now-name of light
Enjoying this mutation:
Orgasmic feeling for a loss of reason...

May...seconds be hours !
May...my flight be higher !

My body's cold, so is my sight
Quiet dead but still breathing
Nothing's changed but everything,
From condolences to rebirth

May...seconds be hours !
May...my flight be higher !

I stepped down to the deepest to really know where I was at,
Couldn't know how tasty death is but I knew how false life was ...
Can't you feel that shit that makes you live it's there to serve something futile ?
