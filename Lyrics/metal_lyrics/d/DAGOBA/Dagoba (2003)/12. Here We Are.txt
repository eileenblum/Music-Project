Son,
I want you to come
I want you to come to me
Sins,
Driven me for life
A common reason to live
Learn,
How wicked the fire is
Look at all the chaos we've built
Sorry,
But this is all truth
I'll never lie to you...
(Have a) Crystal clear sight
(On this) Permanent lie
People that cry
Will also die...
Admire,
The shit we live in
The shit we live in and know
How
To keep it away
You better keep it away
So
I want you to come
I want you to come to me
Son,
I want you to know
I want it for you to have
