You' ve prayed everytime, every hour, every sunday
The one who seems he forgot you.
I try to explain you, believer,
That you're in this world not by a divine way
They can't judge you,
Stop praying it's time to live...

Do you follow the leader, do you really think
that you need this push to make you move ?
"...And justice for all" is my belief so why
Don' t you just follow some metal rules ?

Gods forgot me (so) I forgot them
I don't need these lies...
Gods forgot my faith forgot them
Why do they need to lie ?
Gods forgot me...I'm the godless one
Gods forgot me...my faith's for no one

This holy book I've tried to read
Offered me so many restrictions but just one
Way how to leave, how to think, how to love them
I live my life, so fuck you !
They can' t judge you,
Stop praying it's time to live...

Gods forgot me (so) I forgot them
I don't need these lies...
Gods forgot my faith forgot them
Why do they need to lie ?
Gods forgot me...I'm the godless one
Gods forgot me...my faith's for no one

Gods forgot me (so) I forgot them...
