Another day, just like you' ve prayed for...
Another chance, you' re taking
A brand new sight to realize...
Open your eyes on this other day

People you know betray you so
You'll surely have to go
Away from them, far away from here
Leaving your oldest fears
But you just wanted to move alone
This couldn' t be just another day !

Will you deny the way you feel
Time has now come for you to live
You' ve ever thought you were a bad seed
But here comes another day
So many years, so many tears
No more water will flow
On the face they know, the face you' ve shown
This life you want to change
You want to be somebody else
This couldn' t be just another day !

Will you deny the way you feel
Time has now come for you to live
You' ve ever thought you were a bad seed
But here comes another day

Another day, just like you' ve prayed for...
Another chance you' re taking
A brand new sight to realize...
And the same old things you're telling
Again and again and again and again !
Another deal, another step
Further from yesterday
So much to give, nothing to take
But nothing more to waste
Breathing the air that seems to change
Feeling like you' re a new man
Another start, another...

Will you deny the way you feel
Time has now come for you to live
You' ve ever thought you were a bad seed
But here comes another day
