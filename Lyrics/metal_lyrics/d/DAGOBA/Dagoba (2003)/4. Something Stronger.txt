A fucked up life,
Death slowly comes,
Games I've chosen to play
Are deadly ways to become...
More than human
Much more than you'll ever be
Inside my emptiness
I' ve tried to feel, tried to be
Me...

No hope, no limits
No fears, no advices
No drugs, no fluids
Nothing: I need something stronger !

An altered truth,
Promises of eternal youth
I' ve played the game to fall
Into a deeper hole to become...
More than you are
Much more than you'll ever be
When "greatest" turned to "worst"
I' ve tried to try, tried to try !

No hope, no limits
No fears, no advices
No drugs, no fluids
Nothing: I need something stronger !

More than human
Much more than you'll ever be
Inside my emptyness
I' ve tried to feel, tried to be
Me...
