The browl's been held for millions years
Marching to the final gate...crawl...
Feeling its rage, barely controlled
We all need something to rely on

God / the weight of the earth on your shoulders
God / you carry the world you were born in
God / turning from human to beast
Hell / but nothing between...

A mountain made man
Of forests, blood and fears
Waterfalls and cries
A dead sea made of tears...

Gods have been prayed, what's done is done
Marching to the palest light, hope is hope
Feeling their rage, barely controlled
We all need someone to spit on

God / the weight of the earth on your shoulders
God / you carry the world you were born in
God / turning from human to beast
Hell / but nothing between...

A mountain made man
Of forests, blood and fears
Waterfalls and cries
A dead sea made of tears...

We've been replaced by "you" and "I"
Wondering how far you will go to leave
Dealing with plus and negative
I guess I needed you to need me

Love / the weight of the earth on your shoulders
Love / you carry the world you were born in
Love / turning from human to beast
Hate / but nothing between...

A mountain made man
Of forests, blood and fears
Waterfalls and cries
A dead sea made of tears...
