There's an eclipse outhere
And the sky turns to black
Just like if the stars wanted
To make us a gift
Hey birdie, why do you want
To come back?
Then the sunnier day seems
To fall into mist

You pray but there's no redemption
The fallen angel kill us
All, all, all, all!

There's a million sins for
A thousand souls
Falling down to the earth with
The speed of light
Mixing tears and blood,
Flesh and arrows
Hey little one, you're crashing,
I can't see your wings!

You pray but there's no redemption
The fallen angel kill us
All, all, all, all!
You pray but there's no redemption
The fallen angel kill us
All, all, all, all!

There's an eclipse outhere and the
Sky turns to black
Just like if the stars wanted to
Make us a gift
Hey birdie, why do you want to
Come back?
Then the sunnier day seems
To fall into mist

You pray but there's no redemption
The fallen angel kill us
All, all, all, all!
You pray but there's no redemption
The fallen angel kill us all, all,
Nobody died...but cupid crashed.
