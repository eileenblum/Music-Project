Thorned pics of you deep in my mind
It tastes like the end when we get loose
Illusion of life just left behind
The hardest pain we cannot smooth
Abandonned land we were reigning on
A rain of tears, dust on the throne
You tell me to love is to leave
Be all that you can be without me

A cathedral without a god
The emptiness instead of you
A suicide note without a world
Your hand in his, I'm an orphan of you

You're the one I've been waiting for
I'm the one you're calling number four
Now that I'm just a fuckin' number
A name on a list you should better burn
You made me believe in you, in love
Then betrayed me, o lord of deception
You took everything you had to take
Everything inside me needs to rest

A cathedral without a god
The emptiness instead of you
A suicide note without a word
Your hand in his, I'm an orphan of you

Thorned pics of you deep in my mind
It tastes like the end when we get loose
Illusion of life just left behind
The hardest pain we cannot smooth
Abandonned land we were reigning on
A rain of tears, dust on the throne
You tell me to love is to leave
Be all that you can be without me
