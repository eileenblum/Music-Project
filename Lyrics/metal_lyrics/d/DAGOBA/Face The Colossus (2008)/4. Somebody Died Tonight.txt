Today is worst than yesterday
There's nothing left that you could save
You threw an arrow in the air I guess
The wind blew it away
Don't wanna ear what you could say
On such a perfect day...

Somebody died tonight
What if it was you and I?
Then won't you stay?
Somebody died tonight
What if it was you and I?
Then won't you stay away...?

You drew a line and justice was done
Hit with the hammer, stole the crown
You put a distance between
Us which is killing me
Don't wanna know what you could do
On such a rainy day...

Somebody died tonight
What if it was you and I?
Then won't you stay?
Somebody died tonight
What if it was you and I?
Then won't you stay away...?

Today is worst than yesterday
There's nothing left that
We could save
You threw an arrow I received it
Like a crashing plane
I just can't know what you could
Feel on such a perfect day...

Somebody died tonight
What if it was you and I?
Then won't you stay?
Somebody died tonight
What if it was you and I?
Then won't you stay away...?
