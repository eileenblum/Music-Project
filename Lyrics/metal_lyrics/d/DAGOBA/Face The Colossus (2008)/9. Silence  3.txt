Love's knockin' at my door but
I'll never feel the same
I'll spend a lifetime to forgive
You took a second to regret...

Love's knockin' at my door but
I'll never feel the same
I'll spend a lifetime to forgive,
You took a second to regret
The sun rises over us, it's been a
While I didn't stare

Is this the song
I've heard before?
Is this your voice I hear
No more?

You run away then roses fade
Hidding your tears
When choice's made
You turn the page
And shut the door
I'm out of your world.

Do we change? Do we learn?
This is the chance we've
Got to take
Wheel keeps on turning, time
Has come, it could bend
Or it could break
Love's knockin' at my door but
I'll never feel the same

Is this the song
I've heard before?
Is this your voice
I heard no more?

You run away then roses fade
Hidding your tears
When choices made
You turn the page
And shut the door
I'm out of your world.
