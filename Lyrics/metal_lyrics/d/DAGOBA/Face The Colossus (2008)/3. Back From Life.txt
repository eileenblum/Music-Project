A total u-turn, I'm back in the flood
A entire lake of boiling tears
The ruins of a palace made
Of crystal blood
A life in front of you, our past
In front of me

I stand in the desert all alone,
Injecting rotten fluid in
My trembling wrists
There's nothing more than
Your smell on my hands
The taste of our ending story on my lips

I've been trapped in winter
For many reasons
As cold as stone, like if
Breathing was a strife
I've been open ripped by the hardest season
When all is over it's like I'm back from life

A total u-turn, I'm back in the flood
A entire lake of boiling tears-
The sweetest poison,
The ruins of a palace made
Of crystal blood
A life in front of you, our
Past in front of me

I've been trapped in winter
For many reasons
As cold as stone, like if
Breathing was a strife
I've been open ripped by
The hardest season
When all is over it's like
I'm back from life
