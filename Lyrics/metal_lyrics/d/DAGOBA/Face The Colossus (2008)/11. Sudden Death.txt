The earth is quaking, love is gone
An act of god on
What's been done
Hopes and fears just disappear
When you decided to face away

Kill! Me and you, is this all
That you can do?
Destroy! All that you can,
Zombie style, women skill
Erase! Everything, all that
We did, memories
Hate! You and me,
Us but you, me and you...

A sudden death could
Suit me fine
A new order you redefined
A sudden death could
Suit me fine
A body without a mind

My soul is shaking when
Love's gone
The biggest war into
The smallest heart
Knives and arrows are planted in
There's nothing left
From what I've been

Kill! Me and you, is this all
That you can do?
Destroy! All that you can,
Zombie style, women skill
Erase! Everything,
All that we did, memories
Hate! You and me,
Us but you, me and you...

A sudden death could
Suit me fine
A new order you redefined
A sudden death could
Suit me fine
A body without a mind
