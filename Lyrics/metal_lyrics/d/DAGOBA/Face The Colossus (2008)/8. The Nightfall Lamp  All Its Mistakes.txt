When you wanna bleed just
To know you're alive
The most vicious snakes
Crawl by your side
There's pills around
Collapsing ground

You would like to die
But you can't even sleep
You would like to try but
She won't believe
In everything you say, and all the
Things you gave
You want her to leave
You just wanna try
To get what you need...

The nightfall and all its mistakes
As dark and deep as it gets
The nightfall and all its mistakes
Suicide keeps you awake

Distilled whiskey turns to tears
The darkest thought replaced fear
Scorpions stitch you
When love hates you

You would like to die
But you can't even sleep
You would like to try
But she won't believe
In everything you say, and all the
Things you gave
You want her to die
But don't want her to leave
You just wanna try
To get what you need...

The nightfall and all its mistakes
As dark and deep as it gets
The nightfall and all its mistakes
Suicide keeps you awake
