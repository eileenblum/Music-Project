What seemed to be a lake
A frightening sea
Abyssal chaos
No heart beats

Swimming against the stream
That brings you back to nothing
Life take away
All feelings die in the gray

Liquid turns to stone
Drowned in cement
Everything's gone
Life around you closed its gate

Blood in solid state
Nothing moves on the scene anymore
Frozen river, silent waves
Stone ocean you're diving in

What seemed to be a lake
The darkest sea
Abyssal chaos
Your heart still beats

Liquid turns to stone
Drowned in cement
Everything's gone
Life around you closed its gate

Blood in solid state
Nothing moves on the scene anymore
Frozen river, silent waves
Stone ocean you're diving in
