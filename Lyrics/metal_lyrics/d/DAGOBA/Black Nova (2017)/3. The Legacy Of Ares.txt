Rivers of blood never gets dry
Desolation from the sky to the ground

Spread the word to the hopeless
Mass destruction, process engaged

Babies born in a landmine
Rise into chaos 'til we die

See mankind at its best
Erasing everything won't wait, don't wait
See mankind at its best
Hail the legacy of Ares

Prophecy told one bullet at a time
Embrace the burst, the world ignites

Babies born in a landmine
Rise into chaos 'til we die

See mankind at its best
Erasing everything won't wait, don't wait
See mankind at its best
Hail the legacy of Ares

Rivers of blood never gets dry
Embrace the burst, the world ignites

Babies born in a landmine
Rise into chaos 'til we die

See mankind at its best
Erasing everything won't wait, don't wait
See mankind at its best
Hail the legacy of Ares
