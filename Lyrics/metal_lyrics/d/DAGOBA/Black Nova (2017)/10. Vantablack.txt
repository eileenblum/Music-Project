Sunlight won't chase you
Rays inside, nothing beside
Ain't blind but tell me what you see
Kiss the day, embrace the night

It won't dim the light
It will erase it

Take a last breath and dive
Take a last breath and die

When the burst grows
Consuming who you are
Just hold your breath for a while
And stare at the black star

It won't dim the light
It will erase it

Take a last breath and dive
Into fire let it go
Take a last breath and die
Out of line let me go

Sunlight won't chase you
Rays inside, nothing beside
Ain't blind but tell me what you see
Kiss life before it's gone

It won't dim the light
It will erase it

Take a last breath and dive
Into fire let it go
Take a last breath and die
Out of line let me go
