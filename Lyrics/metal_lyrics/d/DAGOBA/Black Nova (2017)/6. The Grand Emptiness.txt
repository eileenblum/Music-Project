Sudden blackout on everything
Today living, tomorrow gone
Not quite dead but no one see
In a blink of an eye gone

You can run but can't escape
Racing alone to nothingness
Silent halo catching you up
Taken away by emptiness

Nothing can fill it, nothingness
Can you feel it?
No one can replace it,
When one dies we're all gone.

Emptiness becomes so grand
When you're losing your ground
Loneliness seems so long
When emptiness, emptiness becomes so grand

Sudden blackout on everyone
Chaos and fire, disappeared
No fucking order anymore
No more rules, not anymore

Nothing can fill it, nothingness
Can you feel it?
No one can replace it,
When one dies we're all gone.

Emptiness becomes so grand
When you're losing your ground
Loneliness seems so long
When emptiness, emptiness becomes so grand
