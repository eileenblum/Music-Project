Don't have to see in black and white
Bringing back your stolen dreams
Open the sky, let life in
Set fire to all memories

Light has gone out of your life
Time passes on (and) can't get back

If you get lost just move along
Left or right, up or down, move along
If you get lost just move along
Left of right, whatever comes, move along

Set every regret into flames
Let the past go it's far behind
No need to climb to somewhere higher
Your eyes to see everything brighter

Light has gone out of you life
Time passes on (and) can't get back

If you get lost just move along
Left or right, up or down, move along
If you get lost just move along
Left of right, whatever comes, move along

Don't have to see in black and white
Bringing back your stolen dreams
Open the sky, let life in
Set fire to all memories

Light has gone out of you life
Time passes on (and) can't get back

If you get lost just move along
Left or right, up or down, move along
If you get lost just move along
Left of right, whatever comes, move along
