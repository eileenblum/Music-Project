From the deepest level, deeper than despair
I grab the hand of redemption, I grab it on

Surrounded by fire, can't erase or rewind
Straight away to the flames, driving the sunset race

May the air freeze my eyes
Flying away through the heaviest sky

Save me from the one I used to be
Take me away from here
Save me from the one I used to be
Take me away from here

No season lasts forever, nor does the night
Flames ignited, welcoming you back

May the air freeze my eyes
Flying away through the heaviest sky

Save me from the one I used to be
Take me away from here
Save me from the one I used to be
Take me away from here

The sun has never left the scene, you see...
We never really died, did we... did we?

From the deepest level, deeper than despair
I spread the wings of redemption, wider than ever

May the air freeze my eyes
Flying away through the heaviest sky

Save me from the one I used to be
Take me away from here
Save me from the one I used to be
Take me away from here
