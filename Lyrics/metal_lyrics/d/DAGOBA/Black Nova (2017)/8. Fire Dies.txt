Burning through the sky
With no flames of light,
Your sun ain't close to mine

Ignition in control
Should be warm but it's cold
Should be good but it's not

Let's give us a try
If fire dies, so we will die

The burst I'm gonna miss
The greatness of a dead man bliss

Let's give us a try
To light it up, just one last try
Let's give us a try
If fire dies, so we will die

Colors for the blind
Song for the deaf
Tell me how life should taste
When you're hopeless

Burning through the sky
With no flames of light,
Bring you sun back to mine

Let's give us a try
To light it up, just one last try
Let's give us a try
If fire dies, so we will die
