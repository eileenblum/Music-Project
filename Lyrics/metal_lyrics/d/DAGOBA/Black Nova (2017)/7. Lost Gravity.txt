See the daylight to go away
We'll never get another chance to shine again they say

Feed the fire of my life
Be the sunlight I've been searching through this endless night

Starlight dies out
Sun's only hidden away
Starlight shines out
Sun's only hidden away

I will follow you down, wherever you go
If you're losing your ground
I will follow you down, if you got to go
If you're losing gravity, gravity and all...

Bring the fire in my life
The other part of me is all you should be, you should be...

Starlight dies out
Sun's only hidden away
Starlight shines out
Sun's only hidden away

I will follow you down, wherever you go
If you're losing your ground
I will follow you down, if you got to go
If you're losing gravity, gravity and all...
