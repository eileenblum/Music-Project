The Real Warrior never brings the hammer down
It's heart against heart, brains against sex
Those are the labyrinths on the path

Don't look back and turn yourself
Into the same old child that you were born
Restore your innocence and strength

Fighting has given life to you
All you've got is to believe
Let your heart guide your way
Come it up today, Warrior

That revolution won't come about though weapons
The true revolution fits in when uselessness has lost its value
Open the doors of comprehension
Forget all their weakness
The hard to gain freedoms
The tyrannies of the Rational Man

Fighting has given life to you
All you've got is to believe
Let your heart guide your way
Come it up today, Warrior

Dumb and pale
Shadows, crawl
Go ahead in this complete darkness
Not lead by blind men
Don't be afraid to be reborn
The day has come! The time is now!
Warrior!

You know man's looking for
The answers on the outside
But when he rediscovers that
He's always known
That they come from within
