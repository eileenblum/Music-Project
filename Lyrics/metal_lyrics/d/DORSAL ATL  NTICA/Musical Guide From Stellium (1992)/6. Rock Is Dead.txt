Rock is dead along with the attitudes
Artists who have only been troubled with themselves
And never with their fellow men
They have been concerned about flauting
Their jewelry and dimes and their planned transgression
Their rebel behavior in records' covers
The faith of removing mountains succumbs
Crumpled up by the tentacles of materialism
Consumism and merchandise

Marketing loses it's prior function
And serves only for profits
Shall Rock only be when the reason of the heart still exists
While blood circulates through the veins
While music is still able to impel you
To thought being off is not being the ordinary
It's being coherent
It's to live and let live

How can Rock breathe if it has been suffocated
Inside detergent flasks?
ROCK IS DEAD!
