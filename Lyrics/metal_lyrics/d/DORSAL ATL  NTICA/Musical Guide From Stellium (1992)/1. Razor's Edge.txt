Many things tell me nothing anymore
They don't touch my heart
The little things that meant so much
Today seen like flashes from the afternoon's T.V. movies

I've been wandering around
Drowned in doubts
Yes, now I figured out
I'm living on the
Razor's Edge

From one hour to the next
You find yourself alone at an intersection
And between 4 walls
Then you recall that from the time you were born
Only you could choose your path

I've been wandering around
Drowned in doubts
Yes, now I figured out
I'm living on the
Razor's Edge
