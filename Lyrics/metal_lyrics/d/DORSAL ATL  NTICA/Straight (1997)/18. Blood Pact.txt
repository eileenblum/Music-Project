You've drunk my juice and swallowed my orgasm
You promissed we'd never be apart

Hey, We've signed a Blood Pact for the rest of Life
I'm being selfish but I need you to save my mind

I took off my clothes and shaved my genitals
Showing you the naked Truth The resting blaze of abuse

It's not emotional blackmail I need you to breath my air
and throw up the food I shall eat

Living in the past, forbidden present, forgetting the future
Control your mind
Do you wanna be the problem or the solution?
