Dignity is over
World peace is a lie
Cause there is no peace at home
is confidence trustworthy?

Sign of the Times

A world full of irrational sex
A world of anger
Cannot be called a world in peace
Peace is a state of mind

Sign of the Times

The shots who killed Kennedy, Luther, Lennon, Rabin
Are killing me
How can I understand?
How can you feel under pressure?
Information highway
third world primitive art
The homeless
Two thousand years are knocking at your door

Sign of the Times
