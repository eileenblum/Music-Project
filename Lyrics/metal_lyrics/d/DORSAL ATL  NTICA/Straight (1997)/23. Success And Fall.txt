I'm glad it is still going on. I'm happy to be on the road.
Having troubles makes me live.
Day-to-day boredom. Wellspring of art.
No money in the bank.
SUCCESS AND FALL
Pounding through a soundcheck. Never listening to the monitors.
Screeching waves of feed-back.
Day-to-day boredom. Wellspring of art.
No money in the bank.
SUCCESS AND FALL
