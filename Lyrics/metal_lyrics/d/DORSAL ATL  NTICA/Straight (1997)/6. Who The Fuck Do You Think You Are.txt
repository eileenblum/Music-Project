I know you've probably heard this before
But if we stay quiet we'll be ignored
The voices that you want to shut away
But it's our fight to have our say

Who the fuck do you think you are

You say your policies are for our best
But when you fuck up you show no regret
Look around and open your eyes
See what society you have devised

Who the fuck do you think you are

Rich are richer poor more poor
Hands for help reach out, you slam shut the door
Say it ain't your problem, it's out of your hands
You say sort yourself out, you sure we can

Who the fuck do you think you are
That you are kidding
