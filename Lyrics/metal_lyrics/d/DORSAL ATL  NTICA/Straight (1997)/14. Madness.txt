Without music and God I couldn't live
Losing my self esteem and losing the woman
I love the most. She got me out of her sight
I feel her in every morning whisper
Tears in my eyes. Crying is my business
Depressing me

Madness, breathing madness, shadows embracing me

I don't want to live feeling so much pain
Hurting me inside, fighting the dark side of my mind

Madness, breathing madness, shadows embracing me
