Need your bodies Need your souls
Feel your presence in every breath I take
What's love? What's hype?
What I've feeling and what I felt

All the women I've loved live like spectral shadows
I can't lie
The women I've loved

Surrounding me smells and tastes
Can't free me from touches and hates
I can't belong to only one
I belong to myself and my lunacy
