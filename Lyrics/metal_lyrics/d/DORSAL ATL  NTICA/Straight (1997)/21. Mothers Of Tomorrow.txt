Mother, whore, night and day. Kiss, lips, spite, holy scum.
Earth mother is the redemption for filthiness and decay.
Affection and rejection.
The greatest Babylon whores shall be the mothers of tomorrow.
What's the future to the ones who live in sorrow?
All dressed in white to clean thy souls once a day.
Power, strength, weakness, truth and lies.
The greatest Babylon whores shall be the mother of tomorrow.
What's the future to the ones who live in sorrow?
