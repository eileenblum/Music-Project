The travellers should reach the promissed land
Order of the temple defend their rights
Delegated power by the heavens and the sword
The knight templers were too dangerous for the king

Rebellion! Purify by fire! Kill Jacques de Molay!

Those who were "light" seem as darkness
Life imprisonment to grand master of the order!

Torture can't make me confess 'cause I'm Jacques de Molay! Heretic!

"Before the flames took my body, God will take revenge on my death!
Curse to the pope in 40 days! Curse to the king within a year!"

They were sentenced! Jacques de Molay's revenge!

Hic amittitur archa cederis
