Between four walls nothing to be seen in corridors
The door is the boundary of irrationality

Walls tell tales absorbing the dirt
Walls shake hands, one door is the realm

Between good and evil. If only Earth had a door
The door is the boundary of irrationality

Walls tell tales absorbing the dirt
Walls shake hands, one door is the realm
