Foreign propaganda about the city of Hierarchic Democracy:

"Our biggest party is the social readjustment a parade in February

water and food are contraceptives your dreams in the ideal city".

The truth about the social readjustment:

"Hard workers and bosses face one another down there
naked hands rum with stones up there in the lofts
hands shoot to kill the tourists
love the rhythm of these solidary people". (like said the propaganda)

"the readjustment works to eliminate the excess of old workers and
the unwanted as a whole".

Government reasons: "Social readjustment your retirement still incentivates the tourism in the city".

The female hard workers are fertilized by the test tube method when
