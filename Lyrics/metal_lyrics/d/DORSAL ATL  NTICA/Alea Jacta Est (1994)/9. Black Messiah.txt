Black guards priding in their own indignity
Rape the Black Messiah
Their uniform show the color of the power
The police chief takes the torn and bloody man
It's not part of the professional ethics to aid
Someone who has nothing
The decision's up to the interactive TV
To choose between a fanatic or a murderer
What a let down for the families

Maybe if he was an oriental
But a Black Messiah?

The home computers have opted for the illusion
Black Angel and two convicts
Go to the electric chair
Like the animals leaded to the slaughter house
The black and white stairway of eisenstein
Why can't he save himself now?
The king takes his place on the metal throne
Between two ministers binded by the law

Maybe if he was an oriental
But a Black Messiah?

"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do"
The conscience groans like a whale being killed
The devastation of the forest
Gaia's embryo aborted

Maybe if he was an oriental
But a Black Messiah?
