Politicians invited the black angel to feast
Inside their palace
A modern Babylon
His presence astonished both sides
"For wide is the gate
Enter you in at the straitgate and broad is the way."
"Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many
There be which leadeth into life."
Master, why do you eat with politicians and sinners?
They that have a need not a physician
"But you are sick"
"For the tree is known by its fruit but all the words
You do to be seen by men."

There cannot be peace in the world without peace in the heart
Without peace in the world there is no peace in the family
Without peace in the family there is no peace in the home
Without peace in the home there is no peace in the village
Without peace in the village there is no peace in the state
Without peace in the state there is no peace in the country
Without peace in the country there is no peace in the world
And there cannot be peace in the world without peace in the heart
[Old chinese prophecy]
