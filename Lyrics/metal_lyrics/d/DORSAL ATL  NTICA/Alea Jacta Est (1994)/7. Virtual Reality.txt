The governors debate among themselves
Using the virtual development machine
Through lenses of indifference
Virtual reality recreates the misery
To instantaneous order and progress
First the economical development
Then the individual guarantees
Even with repression
Their speech if fulfilled

Inside government's palace there's
An international conference
They drink cold purified water and let
The people die of thirst

And island surrounded by all sides
The captain must sink with his ship

The priests arouse the mobs in the stadiums
Against the "Evil Angel"
See nothing, hear nothing, say nothing

Virtual reality recreates the misery
To instantaneous order and progress
