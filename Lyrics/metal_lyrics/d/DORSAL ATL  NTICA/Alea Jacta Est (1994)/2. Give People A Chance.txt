Tension days of unbreatable air
The clamour of the drums and missiles can be heard
Human hearts drag below
The weight of evidences
Searching for the people in need
GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE
What is the use of one more preacher among thousands of books?
To shake the temples and avoid the fossilization of poetry on paper
Giving heart and soul
Searching for the people in need
GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE
The way: charity must be done without rewards or understanding
Life is like the monotonous sound of a train in movement
But the trail always lead to somewhere
"All things whatsoever you would that men should do to you
Do you even so to them"
For this is what left for us to make a better world
Where everybody would live in peace forever
