Take time to laugh for it's the music's soul
Take time to read for it's the wisdom's basis
Take time to work for it's the price to sucess
Take time to enjoy for it's the eternal youth's secret

Take time to think for it's the source of power

Take time to friendship for it's the way to happiness
Take time to dream for it's the connection between
Heaven and Earth
Take time to love and be loved for it's the privilege of the Gods
Take time to be usefull to others
This life is too short for selfishness
