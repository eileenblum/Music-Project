The corpse was at the morgue for three days
The body was from a sociologist struck by aids
Who struggled to feed those less fortunate
"O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt?"
Raise the dead those who believe
"Believe in me shall never die" were the master's words
Then he ordered rise
Raise the dead

The master was expected by the relatives of the deceased
The green faces of the legist with cold eyes of insensibility
Informed the recent death
Nobody dared to breath
Time waited its minute of eternity for the breath of
Life to take the body in assault
Cancerous screamed for help
The radiation from the nuclear era generated the lepars

The black angel healed them all in front of the amazed mob
Why the power that awakes them all cannot convince mankind?
"O thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt?"
