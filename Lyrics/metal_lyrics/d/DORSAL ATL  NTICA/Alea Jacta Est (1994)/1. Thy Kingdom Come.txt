One man who comes from the slums
And needs to be checked 'cause he takes wide steps
THY KINGDOM COME
There are many stories and phenomenons of healing
But his greatest talent is to love his neighbour
THY KINGDOM COME
Some follow him and find what they left behind meant nothing
Wanted to share their true love
It looks like a revolution but it's only the truth
People call him Black Angel because of the colour of his skin and his goodness
A procession of homeless kids and beggars dressed with ripped blankets
Despite of everything
Smiling faces
While people start to love this man, some will be preparing his death
THY KINGDOM COME
