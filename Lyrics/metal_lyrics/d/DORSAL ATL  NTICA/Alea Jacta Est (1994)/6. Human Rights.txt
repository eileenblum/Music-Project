"Man shall not live by bread alone
Lay not up your treasures upon earth"
Thousands listen to the master's words
Thrown to the wind 'cause their hearts were not present
People don't believe in miracles anymore

Human Rights

"Some foreign organization might be supporting you"
Lights, camera, stampede and looting
The powerful men and the saints wanted the leader
(Where are the) Human Rights?

The followers lost faith
Many who dreamt of power are destroyed
The press is a daily vampire

Street kids steal and they are mistaken
For the apostoles
During the riot an extermination group of policemen shoot both
Lords and slaves want everything easily

Human rights
Clubbing and kicking
Blindfolded eyes
Human rights
Where are the human rights?
