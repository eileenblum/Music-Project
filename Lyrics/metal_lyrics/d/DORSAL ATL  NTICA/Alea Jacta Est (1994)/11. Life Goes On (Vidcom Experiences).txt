The God of technology must bow to the greatest of powers
All know the Black Angel is dead but why is he talking live on the air waves?
Why does he insist? Vidcom experiences

Why do you seek the living among the dead
Cause life goes on

"When sky and the Earth communicate everything will be in order" [Tao]

"There demption in tragedy marks its presence through the terror of pity" [Junito BrandÃ£o]

Why do you seek the living among the dead
Cause life goes on

Now you don't see one image of a man anymore
But all races, sexes, and languages
At the same time
He gave humanity one more example of love
And we killed him for the love of ourselves

Life goes on

It's senseless for Christ to be born a thousand times
If he is not born in the heart of each person
Death is the excuse for the truth on the TV screen

Why do you seek the living among the dead
Cause life goes on
