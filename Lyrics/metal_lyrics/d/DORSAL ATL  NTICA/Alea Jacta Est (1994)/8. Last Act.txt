The world has waited 2000 years for that
Where's their angel with green eyes and straight long hair?

The master shares his final moments
With the disciples enlightned only by candles
He says with love:
"This is not a goodbye. We will meet again.
My persecution will soon begin."

The world has waited 2000 years for that
Where's their angel with green eyes and straight long hair?
The genetic codes are being changed to DNA
Faithfully we will reach the final stage
Doubt haunts your souls as you drift through existence

"Go you there fore and teach all nations"

"There is no knowledge, out of reach for every man"

"I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves
Be you therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves
For many are called, but few are chosen"

The police invades the plot gently as a pachyderm
"For all they that take the sword shall perish by the sword"
