[Music/Lyrics: Stormbringer]

[Lead: Necromancer]

Crush the holy priest,
Burn his church,
Yanoda Havohej,
Impaled upon his own steeple.

Defile his corpse,
But take no blood,
For this I will need,
For my blaspheming ritual.

[Lead: Stormbringer]
[Lead: Necromancer]

Burn the holy priest,
Crush his words,
Yanoda Havohej,
Then my work is done.

[repeat verse 1]
