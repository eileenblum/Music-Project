[Music/Lyrics: Stormbringer]

[Lead: Stormbringer]

Murdered at midnight,
But your ghost won't travel far,
The corpse is still warm...
As I chant the words,
And I scribe the circle,
The four winds whisper to me.

In the name of Satan,
And by the torments of the dead,
Bring life to this corpse,
Animate this corpse.

Why does thou summon me,
You've stepped outside the ring,
Underneath your sign,
Now your soul is mine.

[Lead: Necromancer]
