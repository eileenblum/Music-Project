[Music/Lyrics: Stormbringer]

What has happened to your new heaven? How I laugh to see it burn,
I have caused the star called "bitterness" to fall upon and crush it.

The smoke from burning angels blackens out the falling sky,
The angels are the seven stars I have stolen from your hand.

Lucifer! Satan!
