[Music: Necromancer; Lyrics: Stormbringer]

Born into torture,
Born into hell,
Born for my sickness,
Born unto death.

[Lead: Necromancer]

Pathetic innocence,
Suffer by my hand,
I end your existence,
Before you know it's begun,
Witching, cunting mother,
Gladly Satan's whore,
Sacrifices own son,
Then helps feast on the gore.

[Chorus:]
Unholy - witchery - sorcery,
Suffering - destiny - fire,
Frailty - ritual - perversity,
Foetus lust - agony - dying.

Your face shows me anguish,
Under horns of black goat,
You don't realise you're dying,
As I drink from your throat.

Witching, cunting mother,
Gladly Satan's whore,
Sacrifices own son,
Like one we've had before.

[repeat chorus]
