We're still alone but that's OK, 
We got our friends and family! 
Jails institutions and death by my count there's just one left! 
The triple crown of tragedy my birthright and destiny, 
Our destiny is at the end of a rop! 
The bottom of a glass or a bag of dope, 
Nowhere to turn when you're shit out of luck! 
Still alone and I'm still fucked... fuck you!
Slave to addiction for years and years hid from my life, 
Hid from my fears, fucking broke, alone locked down... 
My life is better when you're not around! 
Watch me struggle as my life fades and try to learn from my mistakes, 
So those who turned their back on me won't get to share in my victory!
Still alive wishing I was dead
Too many years fucked in the head!
Still alive wishing I was dead
When will this misery end?
