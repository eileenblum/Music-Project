Closet racist, 
What's it like to live a lie, 
Put on a front when your rep is on the line, 
Your mind is shut and I know you're weak inside, 
Well guess what punk, 
You're running out of time! 
There's nothing I can do that you won't bring upon yourself, 
It must be hard enough to live WITH YOURSELF! 
And all the lies you can't look half the people you know IN THE EYES. 
Watch your mouth, 
At the wrong place, 
Wrong time, 
You're no friend of mine!
Please stop wasting my time, 
I hope you realize and one day open your eyes, 
Your brand of hate is a waste of time, 
Until you wise up, 
You're no friend of mine!
