Tired and pissed
Had enough of this bullshit but it's
Too easy to quit my friend
So I smile and deal with it

Tired of being broke
People thinking of my life as a joke
This is the path I chose
Where itleasds nobody knows
It's made me stronger as time pushes on
I still grow older but my heard carries on
WE CARRY ON!

We'll carry on until the end of the road
No destination we go with the flow
I learned to live life and take it as it comes
Right around the corner your number could be up!

And if tonight is the night
I'll have lived a full life
And if tonight is the night
Everything will be all right!

Tired and pissed
Had enough of this bullshit but it's
Too easy to quit my friend
So I smile and deal with it!

Feels like I'm downing
Everyday's a fight to keep my
Head above the water and save my own life!
