We will, live life, for ourselves and no one else!

Good times, hard times, it's all the same to me as time flies by.
My life through my eyes, it's just a game that I keep playing
Roll with the punches that's how life goes
Live life day by day, and go with the flow

Don't dwell on the future, it's out of my hands
What's done is done, forget about my past
Live in the moment, and live with no regrets
Do what feels right because life is just a test, your life is just a test!

Pass or fail it's all the same
We're all headed to an early grave
And that's just the price we pay!
So enjoy yourself today
Don't dwell on the future
It's out of my hands!
