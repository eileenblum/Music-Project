Here I go again, was this all for nothing, there my mind goes again, 
I lost it all for nothing!!! 
How much longer must we wait to try and make the great escape? 
Turned my back to this world of lies, 
Opened my mind and that was opened my eyes, 
The time is now and we are here! 
You're wasting time when there's no time to waste... 
Full speed ahead! 
Life's in your face and when you open your eyes you've got to realize your search is over now... 
The time is now and we are here! Here I go again, here I go again! 
Was this all for noghitn? 
There my mind goes again, 
I lost it all for nothing. 
You're wasting time when there's no time to waste full speed ahead, right in your face!
