Hardcore is here to stay
With us to our dying days
And the kids will have their say ONCE AGAIN

Hardcore is our way
To deal with our misery
And the kids will have their say ONCE AGAIN!

Hardcore ito the bitter end
That story never ends and the kids will have their say ONCE AGAIN!

Hardcore in my veins
You know our life is pain
And the kids will have their say ONCE AGAIN!

We live for hardcore!
Memories will never fade
With us to our dying days
This is the life we made
This is our saving grace
The story never ends
Hardcore to the bitter end
If you don't live it
Get the fuck out of my face!!

We've got nothing in common anyway
A phase for some but this is my saving grace
If you don't like it get the fuck out of our place

And there will be no farewell
I hope I live to tell...
