Day late and a dollar short
It's just the same shit on a different day
Too late for me to restart
So I rise and face a brand new day
Do what I got to do to get myself by
That's just the way I was raised
Appreciate everything I've got and pray for better days

When I was broke and bummed out
You helped me
When I was losing my mind
You saved me
I'd do the sam e for you
Brother believe me!
I'd fucking die for you!
Brother believe me
You're just as much a part of my family

As time goes on good times unfold
It doesn't matter if we're getting too old
Because hardcore is what we're all about
Drinking smoking weed and fucking hanging out
Same shit on a different day with friends by my side everything's ok and I wouldn't have it any other way! no way!

I'd rather die than have no friends brothers under the skin, for life.
We're brothers until the end
I'd probably be dead already if it wasn't for my friends
They helped me up when I was down and I'll be grateful until the end!

Thank you - my friends
These memores will never end
