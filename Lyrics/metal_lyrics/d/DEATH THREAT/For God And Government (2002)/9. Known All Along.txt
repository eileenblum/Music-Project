I thought I saw it in your eyes I didn't realize who would've guessed it maybe I should hav e known all along! how could I miss it, am I so fucking blind, the same way I missed it when I was just a child, I've seen the life that it takes, pain that it gives, life that it drains, when will you learn something's got to change, I wish I could change it for you, you've got to make those changes yourself. I wish I could help youyou've got to help yourself. I have you all that I got there's nothing left to give! if I could give you my life I would but first you've got to find the will to live
