We rise to fight, as one we stand tonight! 
This is, this is our scene! it's what we breath, 
It's our reality, you'll never understand the way that we feel... 
Nothing to you but we hold it so dear, 
To live and breathe it truly is a way of life, 
A way to deal with life's pain and strife. 
Good times hanging out with all my friends, 
Times like these we thought they'd never end... they never will, 
If you stay young at heart. 
The only way is if we let if fall apart, 
But I can't because I know every friday night it's HARDCORE, 
GOOD FRIENDS GOOD TIMES! and every Saturday night you know it's hardcore stagedives, 
High fives!!!
