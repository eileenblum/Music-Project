I don't give a fuck if I die today,
I live life my own way!
Lived each day like it was my last,
Lived in the moment
Fuck my future, fuck my past!

Now we're at war, bombs will fly,
Nations lie thousands more die
I've seen war today,
If we live in fear we're already dead...
Live free or die, with no regrets
If they come like a thief in the night,
Fight for your freedom, fight for your life!

Intimidation is a game for the weak
We back our words, we will defeat
No rest until you pay the fucking price
Your life for the thousands you chose to sacrifice.
If we live in fear, we're already dead!
