This world is ignorant, We're digging our own graves, They only tell us what they want, but we're the ones who pay the price! All the lies and the bullshit, it's gotta stop, too little too late, we find out the bomb's already dropped. We're buried to our necks in lies... we're still holding on, now we're trying to dig ourselves out, we've only just begun... when something really happens we'll be the last to know because they don't give a fuck about you or me! We'll be the fist to go, we want some answers, we want a little truth, because we don't know who to trust anymore... we want some living proof
