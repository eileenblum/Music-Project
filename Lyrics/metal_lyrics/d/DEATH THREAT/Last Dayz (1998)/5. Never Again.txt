You left me here to suffer
You left me dying alone
It's only made me stringer 
Your day will surely come

But for now I lay in wait
Full of bitterness
Filled with hate
Can you see the pain you caused me
You will feel the pain you caused me

Empty promises written in stone
Betrayed and left alone
Drowning in my misery
Befcause of you - I lost my sanity

Because of you I will never love again

Because of you I will never love again

Haunted by memories of a love 
That left me filled with pain
I will never love again
I replaced love with hate

Never love again
