I'm fed up with the way you act 
Loyalty and honor is what you lack

You're not loyal to yourself
How can you be loyal to anyone else

It's time - you open - open your eyes
Or this time - you will - you will pay the price

For betraying me
And taking my trust for granted
You lied to me again
Look where you landed
Right back in my face
Talkin your way out
Your true colors have shown and we know what your about

It's time - you open - open your eyes
Or this time - you will - you wi ll pay the price

You keep lyin to me
Again and again
Always talkin your shit
But you still wanna be my friend
You've got another thing coming
You forgot what it's all about 
Stay true to your friends
Or we will run you out.
