I refuse to listen to anymore of your lies
No longer to be trusted
It's motherfuckers like you I despise
One day the tables will be turned
And all your bridges will be burned
No one to turn to 
You can only blame yourself

One minute you think you're on top of the heap
We've seen through the lies - we know your talk is cheap
It's all comin' - comin back around
You've risen to the top
Only to be knocked back down

Now you know the reason for my hatred
You see it in my eyes
When you're down begging for forgivness
Who will answer your crys?
