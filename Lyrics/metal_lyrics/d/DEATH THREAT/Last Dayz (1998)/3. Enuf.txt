I know no other way
To take the pain
Insted of trying to make things better 
I get fucked up everyday 

I've got no future
I chose my path
I will keep burnin'
Burnin' till I crash

I've got no future
I chose my path
I will keep burnin'

When you've got nothin - you dont give a fuck
tired of sufferin - I've had enough

In my mind - It's an all out war
I dont think I can take anymore

Tryin' to keep my mind straight
But it's too hard when you're drowning in hate

When you've got nothin - you dont give a fuck
tired of sufferin - I've had enough

I know no other way
To take the pain
Insted of trying to make things better 
I get fucked up everyday
