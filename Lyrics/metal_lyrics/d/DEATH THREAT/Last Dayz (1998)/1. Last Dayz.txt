Waiting for the end
As your life wastes away
No regrets, too late to repent
We're living in the last dayz

I see death &amp; desolation all around
Judgement day has arrived
We're all going down
When will this misery end
And finally peace of mind
The only peace you'll ever find
Is at the end of time

No time to regret things done in my past
We live each day - as if it was the last 

I see it happening right before my eyes
Crazed civilization - mankinds dmize
Beat or be beaten - we're fighting to survive
Killing off one another - just to stay alive

Running through the streets 
mindless
Armageddon is here

Running through the streets 
mindless
Armageddon is here
