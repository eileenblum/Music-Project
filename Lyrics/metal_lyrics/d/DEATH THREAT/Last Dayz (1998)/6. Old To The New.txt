If you want respect , you gotta give it
If your really hardcore , you gotta live it
It's not a game or a fuckin trend
Those who are true - are here to the end
Handed down from the old to the new

To make this last - we gotta stay true
Stick by your friends no matter what
Gotta stay string - never give up
Stick by your friends
No matter what
Never give up!

I don't know where I'd be if I wasn't in the scene
To my friends old &amp; new - you're like family
This is all I've got in this world of shit
Stay true to what you got - always represent

Handed down from the old to the new
We built this scene - the rest is up to you 
Handed down from the old to the new
To make it last - you gotta stay true
It's not a game or a fuckin trend
Those who are true - are here to the end
