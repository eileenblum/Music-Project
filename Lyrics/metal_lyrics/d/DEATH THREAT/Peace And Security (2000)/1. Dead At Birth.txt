Dead at birth as we slowly decay
We're born only to fade away
We got no future, we got no hope
Our life is pain and it's hard to cope
We're born just to start dying
Do what we like, we'll keep defying
The odds of a generation gone insane
We're still alive - feel out pain
I got nothing but I still got friends
I'm fucking broke but I still make ends
I love my family
And all the friends who stood by me
