I wish - I wish that I had known
I would've never let you go
I was - I was too blind to know
I should've never let you go
I didn't know - when I had you
Taken for granted - now I've lost you
I never realized what you meant to me girl
I never knew we were meant to be girl
I can only blame myself
For the pain that I feel inside
I will always blame myself
For the love - I tried to hide
Too afraid of the pain you'd cause - I hurt myself
Memories of the loves - that I'd lost
You're the one I'll never forget
Losing you - is my one regret
I wish - I wish that I had known
I would've never let you go
I was - I was too blind to know
I should've never let you go
Well now it's too late and you're far away girl
I think about you every single day girl
Too afraid of the pain you'd cause
Memories of the loves I'd lost
And now you're just another memory
But I think about you every single day
And now you're just another memory
But I think about you every single day
You're the one - I'll never forget
Losing you -is my one regret
