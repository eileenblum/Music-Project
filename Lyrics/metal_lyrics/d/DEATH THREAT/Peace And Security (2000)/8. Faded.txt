Can't help but think about the times we've had
Those memories - they make me sad
Good times gone bad
I pick it up I got to move ahead
Old friends where have they gone?
I'm getting older - but I still feel young
Hardcore keeps me alive
A way of life and it's my pride
And we make the best of what we've got
Do what we can so it will never fall apart
New bands new friends and new ideas
Has kept me going - for all these years
But I miss my old friends
And all the good times that we had
And I thought that it would never end
But it did so it's time to move ahead
I can't dwell on the past
I got to live for today
Cause time passes so fast
It seems like yesterday
Now all we have in common is - the memories
Now all we have in common is - the memories
Where have they gone?
To all my friends who faded over the years
Best of luck - on your own way
To all my brothers who are still here
I hope that you - I hope you're here to stay 
Good times, old friends
Where have they gone?
Where have they gone?
