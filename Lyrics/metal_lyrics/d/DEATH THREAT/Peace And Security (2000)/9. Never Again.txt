You left me here to suffer
You left me dying alone
It's only made me stronger
Your day - your day will surely come
But for now I lay in wait
Full of bitteness and filled with hate
Can you see the pain you caused me?
You will feel the pain you caused me
Empty promises written in stone
Betrayed and left alone
I'm drowning in my mysery
Because of you I lost my sanity
Because of you I will never love again
Because of you I will never love again
But now I lay I wait
But for now I lay in wait
Full of bitteness and filled with hate
Can you see the pain you caused me?
You will feel the pain you caused me
Empty promises written in stone
Betrayed and left alone
I'm drowning in my mysery
Because of you I lost my sanity
Haunted by memories of a love
That left me filled with pain
I will never love again
I replaced your love with hate
Never love again
