Here we go - tonight - can I take it? Will I make it?
Bred to hate in this world you're alone
You serve a sentence when you've done nothing wrong
You look ahead for a better tomorrow
When life holds you back your resentment just grows
A cry for help only fell on deaf ears
So all the fears and horros drew nea r
I realize that there is no tomorrow
Why look ahead cause you'll die anyway
And I've been looking back at the days that have gone by
(Maybe I was bred to hate)
These years of darkness when the bitter tears poured from my eyes 
(Maybe I was bred to hate. Can I take it? 
I was born and bred to hate. Will I make it?)
I think I'm going straight to hell anyway
All born to hate - bred to hate - born to hate
I was born and bred to hate
Here we go - tonight - can I take it? will i make it?
Bred to hate in this world you're alone
You serve a sentence when you've done nothing wrong
You look ahead for a better tomorrow
When life holds you back your resentment just grows
All born to hate - bred to hate - born to hate
I was born and bred to hate
I've been looking back at the days that've gone by
These years of darkness when the bitter tears poured down my eyes
Can I take it? Will I make it?
I was bored and bred to hate
