After all these years, I can't just turn my back
All the blood, the sweat and all the tears
You've got to earn your respect
Well what the fuck do you want from me?
Cause you don't give a fuck about my scene
And I could give two fucks about you
Stop living vicariously through
You're running around like some old school star
But we don't know who you are
You dropped out - after a year
I know you're fake - you're fucking insincere
You're gone longer than you were here
Well now you're back and we don't care
We didn't build the scene for you to disgrace it
I didn't make a name for myself fo you to claim it
To you this is just another trend
But I'll be representing hardcore to the bitter end
The few, the proud, it's a way of life
Me and my friends always side by side
Cause we've got respect for each other
I treat my motherfucking friends like brothers
We didn't build the scene for you to disgrace it
I didn't make a name for myself fo you to claim it
