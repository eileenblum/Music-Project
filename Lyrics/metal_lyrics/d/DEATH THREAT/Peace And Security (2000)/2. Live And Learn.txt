Life's a gamble - it's all how you play
The cards that you're dealt - the chances that you take
Life's a gamble - it's all what you roll
You're in to win it - or you just go with the flow
Take a chance - or you'll never see
All that you could've done - instead your life's a dream
Take a chance - do what you like
Do what you gotta do - y ou only get one life
Sometimes you lose - sometimes you win
Sometimes you do what's right - other times you sin
Live and learn - that's the chance you take
When you fuck up - you got to learn from your mistakes
Life's a gamble - it's all how you play
The cards that you're dealt - the chances that you take
Life's a gamble - it's all what you roll
You're in to win it - or you just go with the flow
