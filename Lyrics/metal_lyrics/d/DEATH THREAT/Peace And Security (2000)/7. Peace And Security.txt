Nothing matters and nobody cares
Alone in this world - alone with your fears
No peace - no security
A nation built on hypocrisy
No peace - no security
Talks of peace - while still at war
Diseases spreading like wildfire
Kids with guns and bad ideas
World gone insane prepare to live your fears
Peace and security the nations will cry
No peace - no security - sudden demise
of society all that you've built
This nation and all of its guilt
This world gets crazier day by day
This world breeds hate - no escape
No peace - no security
By this world - we've all been raped
Nothing matters and nobody cares
Alone in this world - alone with your fears
No peace - no security
A nation built on hypocrisy
Talks of peace while still at war
Diseases spreading like wildfire
Kids with guns and bad ideas
World gone insane - li ve your fears
Prepare to live your fears
