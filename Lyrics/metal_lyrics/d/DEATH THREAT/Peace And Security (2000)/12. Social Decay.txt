Social decay in our society
Living in a world with no humanity
Innocent people dying everyday
Bloodshed - the American Way
And all these people they close their eyes
And carry on with their picture perfect lives
But they're all blind to their own demise
And they continue to breed their lies
We're living in a nation of hate
This whole world is in a crazed state
A lack of morals - a lack of truth
Blind leaders - misguided youth
Social decay - because we're ruled by liars
Social Decay- this world's grown tired
And you know it's just a matter of time
Until the youth gone wild - sets this world on fire
And all these people they close their eyes
And carry on with their picture perfect lives
But they're all blind to their own demise
And they continue to breed their lies
We're living in a nation of hate
This whole world is in a crazed state
A lack of morals - a lack of truth
Blind leaders - misguided youth
Social decay in our society
Living in a world with no humanity
Innocent people dying everyday
Bloodshed - the American Way
Burn - Baby - Burn
