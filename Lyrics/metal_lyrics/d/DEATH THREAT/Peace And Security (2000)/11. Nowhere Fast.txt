Never rely on someone else
You gotta do what you gotta do for yourself
Life is hard - but we can win
We're born to struggle - and we're born to sin
And what we want - sometimes we can't get
But life is short - so get what you can
I'm tired of wallowing in my misery
And everyday is just the same old story
Deep inside I know that I deserve better
I'm fucking tired of being miserable and bitter
Safe to say - I'm goin nowhere fast
I'm headed full speed - down a dead end path
Well that's alright cause my time's coming soon
Turn i t around - born to WIN! - not to lose!
I'm tired of waiting
My life is wasting
And when you fall - you've got to rise to your feet 
(face defeat)
Cause if you don't - this fucking world's got you beat
(you're weak)
Look out for you
Look out for number one
It's up to you 
You get the job done
Never rely on someone else
You gotta do what you gotta do for yourself
Life is hard - but we can win
We're born to struggle - and we're born to sin
