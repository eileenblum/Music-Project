You aren't wanted here, you'd better leave
The taste of power has left you insane
I would give my life to end your reign
Just let me see your corpse impaled
They would do the same
You'd lose your throne
With no one around to push
We won't take your shit
Your corrupt mind
Has turned to stone and left us behind
You're supposed to care about your people
But you only care about yourself
We will not be silent, we'll rid of you
In the only way that we know how
For years and years you've ruled us
With your iron hand of power
You'd bring it down upon us
With every word we spoke against you
Years and years of pain and death
And our children die of hunger
Now we band together
In a war against our evil master
Absolute power
Corrupts absolutely
Can't take anymore of your oppression
