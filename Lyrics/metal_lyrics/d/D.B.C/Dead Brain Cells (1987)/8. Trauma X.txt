Hereditary pain
Passed on for generations
A genetic disorder
No drug can correct
Relentless abuse
Of mind and body
Your children will pay
For your wretched youth
To hear an infant's cry
Triggers inbred hate
Destroy the source of irritation
The children you once made
The cries are getting louder
It won't listen to your threats
Frustration leads to violence
The louder that it gets
It must be taught a lesson
One it won't forget
Back eyes, battered bones, brutal blows
Anger displaced to the innocent
Bashed head, almost dead, breathing low
You can't hide this little incident
