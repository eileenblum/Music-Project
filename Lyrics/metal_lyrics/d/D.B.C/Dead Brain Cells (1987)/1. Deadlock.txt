Conflict of interest, colliding minds
Two nations bent on controversy
Hypocrite politics, broken vows
Perpetual dishonesty
A meeting in the neutral zone
Both thinking they're right
There's no intention of talking here
They're both ready to fight
One war is worth a thousand words
Tunnel vision, no compromise
Initial optimism dies
Unresolved and out of time
There's no hope for peace of mind
One last try, no result
The wheels of peace grind to a halt
Cut all ties, close the door
Step outside cause this means war
