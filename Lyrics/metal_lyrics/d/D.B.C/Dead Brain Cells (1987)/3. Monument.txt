Perfect is the life of king
Father said to me
The life was mine when he died
Too young to rule an empire
But father never lied
Perfect was the life of king
Ignore my incestuous background
I was born of God
Gods don't die, why should I
I want to live forever
It's my divine right
But doubts begin to cloud my mind
Much has been written about
Father's immortality
If he hasn't died, where is he now?
Save me
I'm a victim of a mortal life
I want immortality in the memory of man
I'm only made of flesh and bone
I'll eventually die
Put my name on a body of stone
And my soul will rise
Save me
I'm a victim of a mortal life
I want immortality in the memory of man
Build me lasting monuments
Eternal forms of my name
Hide my rotting body
From the claws of decay
Leave me in my peaceful sleep
So I can dream of life
Perfect is the life of king
Father said to me
But he didn't tell me life would end
