I'm getting really mad
I can tell when I've been had
You'll regret the day we met
You haven't seen my bad side yet
Push and push, you won't let up
Tension's thick, feel it in my gut
Pressure builds, can't take the strain
You'll feel the anger I can't contain
Why must you persist on this game
When I don't even know how it's played
As you can see, my eyes turn red
It's all you've done
And everything you've said
I can't control, you've gone too far
This time you gave me your worst
You'd better run, you might get hurt
I feel like my head's gonna burst
