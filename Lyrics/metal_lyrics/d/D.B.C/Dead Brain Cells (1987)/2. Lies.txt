Mass deception
Distorting truth
Your people live in lies that come from you
Self election
Opponents disappear
They threat the evil things you do
State oppression
You run the media
The story's changed so you look good
False conception
Your people would like you less
If papers wrote the things they should
Lies, all you ever tell are lies
Lies, all you ever tell are lies
Mass deception
Distorting truth
Your people live in lies that come from you
Violent obsession
Your lust for power
Is killing people, doesn't mater who
Lies, all you ever tell are lies
Lies, all you ever tell are lies
We hate your state and will retaliate
Your soldiers trained for battle
But are used as bait
Your lies they buy
But in the end you'll die
They'll see the hypocrite in you
It just takes time
Lies, all you ever tell are lies
Lies, all you ever tell are lies
