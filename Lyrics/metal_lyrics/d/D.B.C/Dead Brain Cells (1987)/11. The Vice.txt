Out on the streets, your life's a mess
You're feeling lonely and depressed
He'll hit you when you're down and out
He's a man who knows what you're about
He injects you with his deadly drug
You've got to have it in your blood
You want more but it's not free
So you sell your soul
It's the only thing you've got
Too late, you're trapped
In his vicious circle
He's got a hold on you
You can't escape, you need his drug
To keep you alive
But that's not true
Deeper and deeper you sink into his darkness
It's the drug that pulls you down
Up to your neck and losing air
It's hard to breathe
You're about to drown
It's time to stop and think
Where the problem lies
Just think back to how it all started
And I think you'll realize
