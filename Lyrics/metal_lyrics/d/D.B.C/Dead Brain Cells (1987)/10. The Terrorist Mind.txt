The terrorist mind is like a machine
He'll do it, no questions are asked
If he's to succeed, they've got to
Make him believe that killing
And bombing's a blast
He's brainwashed to believe that he
Has a cause for his nation and himself
He's trained to kill and maim
Those who pose no threat
To his nation or himself
The terrorist mind is like a machine
He'll do it, no questions are asked
If he's to succeed, they've got to
Make him believe that killing
And bombing's a blast
Many injured, many dead
Their mangled bodies filled with lead
An airport, a crowded street
A public place is all you need
Car bombs, hi-jacks
Shooting people in their backs
Kidnap, bomb threat
You make demands you'll never get
