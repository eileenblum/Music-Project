A planet defaced with death and decay
An atmosphere of hate
Cities destroyed
Their meanings forgotten
And fertile lands lay waste
A planet once prosperous
It's future looked bright
But an immature race had evolved
Given time and the knowledge
They soon could destroy
The planet on which they revolved
Not one life would be spared
It wouldn't happen again
Because there is no second chance
Hate
The downfall of humanity
Man's inevitable suicide
War
With no hope of reversion
Results in a permanent armistice
Terror spreads across the planet earth
Lethal winds leaving nothing in their wake
Cries from every living organism
Fierce pain tortures every nerve
Silence descending as the last one dies
A final peace
Lasting for eternity
