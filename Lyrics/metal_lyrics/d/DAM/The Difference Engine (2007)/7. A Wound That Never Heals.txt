Mire of slime
Cancerous purulent goitre
Malnourished souls
Festering pustule lingering sore

Tired of hysterical dream
Of what this all could mean
Gather relish the death
Remaining secrets never kept

Oblivious to what is yet
Future sentience bitterness
Slogans stridently
Out of the grotesque concrete
Boiling blaring

Heinous and total war
Polarise tyrannise
Hone your ideology
No place for doubt or hesitation

Only global holocaust can appease this monster
Shacking unimaginable truth replaces reality

Disguised in the guise of justice
Holy war is the new rock'n'roll

Nazis, feminists
Extremely catholics
Haredim, panthers and homicide brothers
Right/left-wing lawyers
Funded capitalists
Gay righteous activists
Newspeak communists
Fascists, crypto-fascists, neo-fascists
Atheists, creationists
Bible-bashing cartoonists
Ready for the war grinder
All throw their oil on the fire

Nobody gives their life for a cause
It is torn away
Torn

Echoing through desolate ruins
Of recurring nightmares
After the fact no one cares
For the children of this world of hate
