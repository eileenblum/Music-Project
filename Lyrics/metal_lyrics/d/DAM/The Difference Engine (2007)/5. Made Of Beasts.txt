Building the future with our fists and hate
Disturbed by talking heads that speak for us
Enter the brave new age of the martyr
Cabled, televised

Frontiers of civilisations
And arena disappear
In an era of the unfettered voyeur
The clamour crows

Cowards
Determined
Intrusive
To defile

Desensitised by neural lords of mass isolation
Wielding power without control
Surrender to an insidious apathy
Sex class racial savagery
Of cruel and ridicule

Slaughter of man
Honoured time and time again
Skin tout over bones
Of agony

The lie
The churning of the mind
Infuse the I

Ready to create or perpetrate
The new totalitarian ideals
Perpetuated myth will die
Just like any other meme
Made of beasts
