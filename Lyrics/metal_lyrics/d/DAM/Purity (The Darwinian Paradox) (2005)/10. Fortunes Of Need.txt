Starving stumps of leftover madness
Dissolve gradually
Untold furies burgeon in my mind
Stolen, self-swollen beauty

Echo me Narcissus

In the foreign lands of things to come
Where truculent acts against dignity
Will come to lose the keys to humanity
Showing me what not to be

The foe, king of an envious liege - devolved
His words, turning the wheels of disgust - untrue
Cleft hooves sprout in his neighbourig voice - doubting you all
Mounting our oceans of greed - fortunes
Fortunes of need

Precious remnants of sanctity
A stranger fiction wearing thin
Wronging him
Like the caress of a broken dream

In the foreign lands of things to come
Where truculent acts against dignity
Will come to lose the keys to humanity
Showing me what not to be

The foe, king of an envious liege - devolved
His words, turning the wheels of disgust - untrue
Cleft hooves sprout in his neighbourig voice - doubting you all
Mounting our oceans of greed - fortunes
Fortunes of need
