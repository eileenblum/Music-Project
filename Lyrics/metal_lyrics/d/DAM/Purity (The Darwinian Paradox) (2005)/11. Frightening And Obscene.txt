Oceans of need my kept queen dream afloat,
She like the scales to play this game I've tried before;
And no one ever wins but the churning seas of abyss,
That balance our internal shadows - besieging and indiscriminate:
Frightening and obscene - fanning flames of blindness,
Preventing forbidden fruit to bear in mind such burns unkind;
I lower my torpid nocturnal grasp to gage their untempered flow,
Swamping me with a full warming throb Frightening and obscene.

I cannot yield to the unquestionable physicality
Of such a warming and alarming desire unexplainable sickness,
Starving me of my hunger,
As I watch the ones I love tear each other apart
To mirror the world around us: frightening and obscene.

The ruthless arrow of time,
Her perpetual expendable army of desecrated childhood dreams
Marching towards each other to die again too soon;
They kill in desperate glee, to mirror the worlds inside of me:
Tearing each other apart.

Oceans of need my kept queen dream afloat,
She like the scales to play this game I've tried before;
And no one ever wins but the churning seas of abyss,
That balance our internal shadows besieging and indiscriminate:
Frightening and obscene fanning flames of blindness,
Preventing forbidden fruit to bear in mind such burns unkind;
I lay here, bitterly, with rage I yearn to don the mask:
Careless, indiscriminate,
Frightening and obscene.
