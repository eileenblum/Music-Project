Fragments of destiny forged in the embers of my soul
Burning with agony, the angst of future's burning hole
This world stands before us, a representation
Our souls within these coils, imprisoned by perception

Cast aside like the remnants of a dream
Mortal coil imprisoned in nightmares of fury of denial of hatred and grief
Bloodied by deception these hands will kill again
Stronger than the gravestones of belief
Our daylight nightmares hold the truth,
As blades of enlightenment tear into my dream like shards of morning
sunlight
Of a burning reality...
The birth of tragedy

Spared the limits of my humanity
My spirit spans the scene
Unborn victim of control
A ring etched forever in my soul

Wasted lives of tomorrow
Body temples of sorrow
