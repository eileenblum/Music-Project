Looking to me I saw you going
going to past and showing me! that I'm nothing
and you let me
all by myself and lonely

Social disorder looting and rioting
Grace in a world under siege

We are all inclined to life a separate
Close your thoughts and take in only disgrace

Who said that telling someone how to live their life is productive?
Who told you that?
Your idea of âtruthâ is an excuse
to put others down and we can all see through your bullshit

Whenever I try
and you donât give a fuck about me or anybody else

Devoid of the perception of acquiescence
Our system is built on twigs of corruption

Social disorder looting and rioting
Grace in a world under siege

Don't waste your time with me
I hope you can see
to have supposed to be
