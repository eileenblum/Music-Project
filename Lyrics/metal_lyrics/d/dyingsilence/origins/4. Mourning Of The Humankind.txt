They don't mean nothing released
Spoken from the mouth of a liar?
When wind becomes a whisper
I can hear, you can hear, we can hear
the mourning of the humankind
How can I be relieved?
Only by building an empire
Purge the filth, clear the patterns
We all have a craving for destruction
Never I'll never be
More than you can predicted
And as the light breaks through, with the hope that we had
You never could see the message unspoken, inside my mind
