Filling this void inside of me
Buried under all Buried under all
Buried under all this weight
Empathetic emptiness, Maybe a little hate
The things that I believe In the way that I stand
Bound by hatred I'm sick finding excuses
Empathetic emptiness, Maybe a little hate
The things that I believe
In the way that I stand
I Stand, in my way
The hate still motivates me
Something here worth fighting for
No mercy is shown
To shut an open without your fate
Frenetic, power
and fury within me
there is no pity
There's no mercy
Empathetic emptiness, Maybe a little hate
The things that I believe
In the way that I stand
