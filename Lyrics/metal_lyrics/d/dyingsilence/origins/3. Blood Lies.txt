Feel they will never feel
any of this pain that you made me be apart
and now it's your turn to feel that pain
your lies will never be listened by me you'll never scream
with anybody again
the gun is in your head
I can see you sweat
now is time to say
your last words and pray
last chance stay still you sorry now you feel
your head in my hands your turn
as I said your lies will never be listened by me you'll never scream
with anybody again the gun is in your head
I can see you sweat now is time to say your last words and pray run
go be thank you won you know the fear the pain you hear
go home now go home now go home now you coward now
