So I knock you out
And I'll say you truth
Is a lie and I'm not your fucking sheep

Wishful Promises
Post Mortem desires
For the taken of your
forsaken soul
Worthless

So I knock you out
And I'll say you truth
Is a lie and I'm not your fucking sheep

Ignorance full feeling my lunger
I'm hunger for average
My life on your lips
wishing, deceiving the lust
from your sins
Goddamn innocence

So I knock you out
And I'll say you truth
Is a lie and I'm not your fucking sheep

Say your prayers
by the night
wont save you
from my teeth and nails

I pledged for you
I lust your flesh

So I knock you out
And I'll say you truth
Is a lie and I'm not your fucking sheep
