You know I keep my eyes open
My heart is beating high
can't feel, can't ask
As the fool I am
We are together in this angry world
and I will not tolerate your pain

(Your pain)
You keep my other me asleep
(Your pain)
You are my angel, you are my cure

Don't matter what you say I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
Don't matter what you say I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for

You know I keep my eyes open
My heart is beating high
can't feel, can't ask
As the fool I am
We are together in this angry world
and I will not tolerate your pain

(Your pain)
You keep my other me asleep
(Your pain)
You are my angel, you are my cure

Don't matter what you say I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
Don't matter what you say I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
Don't matter what you say I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
Don't matter what you say I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for

I cant see you cry neighter see you fall, into this shadows I cannot fight the pain of see you die. Now
(See you die)
(See you die)

Don't matter what you say I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
I'll be waiting for
