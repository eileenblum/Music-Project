Fire and iron - Demonic warmachines
Burned flesh, tortured, armoured in chain mail
Forward from hell, with axes we fell
Murderers, invaders

Rage of the Bloodbeast

We come to kill, to rape and murder
Fucked up butchery - Sadistic slaughter
Impale, impale - Impaling you children
Rape, rape - Raping your women

Rage of the Bloodbeast

I shall wolfe your flesh and snap your bones
Skrind your folk and burn their homes
You shall never dread my kind
And never squander fear behind
