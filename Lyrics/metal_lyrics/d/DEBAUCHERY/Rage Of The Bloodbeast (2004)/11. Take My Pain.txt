Greetings from my soul
Where all is dark and foul
Violent self-destruction
Itâs the only perfect option
Forward through the trenchline
When the bullet hits my spine
Jump before the train
It will not only crush my brain

Kill me - Take my pain

Murder and suicide
Thatâs the blessed hellride
Murder and wrath
Itâs my final breath
Arteries cut open
Or I burn myself in an oven
I get myself hanging
Or from a bridge springing

Kill me - Take my pain

This is the final chapter
Time for deathâs stalking raptor
Itâs the final hour
Time for maggots to devour
All the pain is gone away
There is nothing more to say
Now all my life is spent
And Iâm finally dead in the end
