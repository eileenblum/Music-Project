Coming from the void - The total fucking horror
Searching for your species - You will cover in terror
The devourer moves - Between the stars and hungers
For all the flesh - Of all who lies before us
We are the new world order
We need no law and no lawbreaker
We are the brood with a single mind
We are the devourer of humankind
We are the devourer
Total nightmare from beyond the stars
We will rip apart with our claws
We are all the creatures, the hellspawns
We are all monstrosities united in a single swarm
Coming from the void
Devourer of worlds
Hive war
Itâs the final hour - Itâs armageddon
