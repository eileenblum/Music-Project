Bloodstained and maimed
Attack, no feints
Dressed in metal
Forward to battle
With fire and iron
On the path of damnation
Clawed fiends of murder
We are searching for slaughter

Wargrinder

Explosions rock the ground
Blood and earth rain down
The smell of burning bodies
Loosed bowls, blood and zombies
Explosions, carnage, itâs striking hell
Wading through gore, towards the wall
Taking the ground, taking the trench
Fire and blood, the deathâs stench

Wargrinder

Killing for blood

Wargrinder
