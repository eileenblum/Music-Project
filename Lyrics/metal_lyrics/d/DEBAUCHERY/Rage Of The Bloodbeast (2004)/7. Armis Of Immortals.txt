Marching through the fires of hell
To the sound of a screaming bell
A soul of darkness is bound
The lands of mortals to haunt

Insanity of eternity - Armies of immortals

Legions of zombies and demons
Cults with treacherous sermons
There is no hope, all is lost
In this damned and death seeking host

Insanity of eternity - Armies of immortals

We cannot flee, death is no option
Itâs an insane army resurrection
Itâs a circle of madness every day
Millennias of torture - We can only pray

Insanity of eternity - Armies of immortals
