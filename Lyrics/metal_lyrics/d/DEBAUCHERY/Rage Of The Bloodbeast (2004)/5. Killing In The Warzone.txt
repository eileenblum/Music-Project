Dark legion is on the way
Only the fools are here to stay
Savage hunters stalk the night
We are ready for the fight
Rotten warriors, rancid flesh - World violation
We are searching for your soul - World violation
Zombie legions, demons - World violation
Worst nightmare, alive - World violation
Shoot them down, burn civilians
We are the deathâs heads
Killing peoples, burning cities, devastation
Attracted by warzones we stalk our pray
In metal beasts, titans for war and gore
Hardened by unholy fires
Forced with demonic powers
We are marching to the war
In space hulks from the warp
Killing in the warzone
