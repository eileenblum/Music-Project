Roar kill kill kill
Night falls - The city goes to sleep
Out of the wilderness - comes the thunderbeast
Out for violence - to shred and slash
To feed on the pulp of the inhabitants slush

It will stomp on the city wall
Crush all the cityÂ´s mighty halls
Evil nightmares will turn real
A violent death you will feel

Brutal crusher-killer
Mighty Gorezilla
evil war-killer
Gore-obssed Gorezila

The king of beasts
The King of killers
Call him Gorezilla

The king of war
The king of killers
Call him Gorezilla
