The tank is grinding you down
The tank spares not even its own
The battlefield is its domain
All oppositions is in vain
Like a thunder beast it crushes the enemy
It will set the brutality free
Warriors of hell fall before the behemoth
The remains are left to rot

war-killer dreadnought engine
Super heavy german warmachine

Your frontline will crumble
Torwards the enemy the tank rumbles
On iron tracks grinding you down
even if it is all alone
Ironclad, unbreakable murder-engine
To red sludge it will crush
Your children 
Kill, kill murder-device
Brutality comes, death will rise

War-killer dreadnought engine
Super heavy german warmachine
