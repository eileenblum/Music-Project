Coming out of the forest of doom
Marching towards your settlement
In the morning gloom
Shrouded in the mists
Of the cold earth
Stalk into your homes - 
Comes to your hearth

The mass murderers of the slaughter man
The killers of woman and children
Eat your offspring out of the cradle
Steal your woman and cross them cattle

Murder
Brute
Murder
Murderbrute minotaurs

The minotaurs of the slaughterman
We kill woman and children
We murder them for sport
Because we are a demon horde

We wear baroque metal armor
Armed with axes an horns
We love close combat, killing eye to eye
Watch you suffer, want to see you die

Thunderbeast
Murder stalker overfiends
