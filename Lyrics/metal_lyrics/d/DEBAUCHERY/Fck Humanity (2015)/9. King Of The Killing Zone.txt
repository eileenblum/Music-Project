Mighty balgeroth is my lord
My god, my king, I fight in his horde
I am a war machine from hell
A titan of war, killing with fire and shell

I am armoured in biomechanic and black
Fed on my kin killed on the torture rack
Demon blood runs through my frame
A dragon heart pumps nuclear flames

Monsters of the dark legion
Fighting in hellÂ´s hottest regions
The kings of the killing zone
The rules of the city of bone

Warbeast superkiller dreadnought
