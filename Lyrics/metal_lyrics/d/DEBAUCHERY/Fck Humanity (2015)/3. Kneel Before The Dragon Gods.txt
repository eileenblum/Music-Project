We fight against the hordes of evil
We are the bulwark against the devil
Our enemies are al demon thralls
Our fight will end when satan will fall

We are not alone - God is on our side
There is no place in Hell, where you can hide
Our armor is strong it will hold firm
We are unbreakable - You will burn

Your horde is 1000 strong
You think you will win, but you are wrong

We are the children of the stars
Born to fight the righteous wars
Defenders against the demon hordes
Kneel before the Dragon Gods

War on eden - See the forests burn
War on earth - A billion bodies torn
War in heaven - The angels will fall
War in Hell - Hear the end timesÂ´bell
