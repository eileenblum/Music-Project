A million worlds are under siege
A million worlds are at total war
Aliens and demons bring your doom
Aliens and demons are coming to get you

With faith and fire
With war machines
With bolter and chainswords
With the might of the legions

With a bilion tanks
With a thousand billion soldiers
With mighty starships
With the might of the legions

Burn them in atomic fire
Hear their death scream
10 billions burned to cinders
Like a madmanÂ´s dream

Hail
Kill

For the emperorâ¦
The death of a world
Die for glory
There is only war
A galaxy of gore
