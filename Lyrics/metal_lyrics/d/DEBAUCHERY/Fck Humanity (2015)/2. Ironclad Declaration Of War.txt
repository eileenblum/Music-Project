Demon engines blessed in virginÂ´s blood
Warmachines decorated with human guts
Godlike warriors from hell
Nihilistic brutes - Evil and fell

Siege battle - we will storm the walls
Siege battle - your fortress will fall
Enemies killed with bolter and sword
From the warp we come forth

We are iron warriors
Ironclad

Eternal war is my fate
My religion is hate
In the fires of hell I will roar
My god is called war
Iron within - Iron Without
