"We are the surgeons of demise. Monarchs to the kingdom of the dead. We will
show you the meaning of pain. Abacinate you then open you up with knives.
Take what we want. Make your flesh our own."
[One of the Savage Morticians in Graham McNeill's Dead Sky, Black Sun in The Ultramarines, Omnibus p. 664]

We are the kings of killing
The masters of bloodspilling
Time to rape and murder
That's our sense of humour
Demon hordes
Dreadnoughts
Diabolic evil
Soldiers of the Devil

We are Masters Of The Killing Art

We march through guts and gore
Fighting the eternal war
We are here for bloodshed
Killing for the Blood God
Engine of pain
Totally insane
Perverse rapist
With the chainfist

We are Masters Of The Killing Art

We haunt the depth of the night
We're always ready to fight
We rape your desecrated frame
And burn your damned soul in the flames
Murderers
Monsters
Demon engine
Warmachine

We are Masters Of The Killing Art
