"You seek death and I would gladly rend and tear your soul. I would rip your
flesh screaming from your bones and garland this body with your entrails,
but your death is to be far worse than even one such as I could devise. Your
skull will be honoured with a place in one of the bone mountains within
sight of the Blood God."
[The Omphalus Daemonium in Graham McNeill's Dead Sky, Black Sun in the Ultramarines, Omnibus p. 533]

Obliterating
Earthshaking
Desintegrating
Terminating

Blade, saw, needle and flame
Killing in the Blood God's name
Bloodstained shards
of broken glass
Pushed right into your ass

Tormented
Immolated
Cremated
Another one dead

Pulverizing the head
Breaking your fucking neck
Incinerate the enemy
We will win - you will see

HAIL - HAIL - HAIL - HAIL
