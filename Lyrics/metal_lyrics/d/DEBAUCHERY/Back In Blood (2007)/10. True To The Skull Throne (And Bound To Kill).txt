Suicide, genocide, holocaust, mass murder
Revelling in total slaughter
Die some frenzied tortured death
Uttering your final breath
It's the thrill to kill at will
Hell bent on dismemberment
Limbless torso - carcass rotten
Thousands of dead forgotten

Cutting, gutting, shooting, killing
Our cause of existence
Spinning the mighty battle axe
Trough collar bone and neck
Insanity and butchery
Mutilation just for free
Hunting for meat and flesh
Stare into the face of death
