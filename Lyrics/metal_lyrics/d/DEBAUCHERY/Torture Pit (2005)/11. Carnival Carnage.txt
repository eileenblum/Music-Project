The mass is screaming
The animal is bleeding
They call this sport and culture
And wait for the death like vultures

They let it bleed

Hate this sort of entertainment
I hate this fucking butchery
I want to see the torero crippled
Without eyes, teeth kicked out

Disembowelled, his dick broken
Castrated, legs ripped off, lame
His wife raped by aids infected men
His children screaming in pain

Carnival carnage

I want to see the arena collapse
I want to see the spectators burn

They let it bleed

Torero -
I want to see you dead
Cripple the fucking bastard
Crush his brain

With your hoofs stomp on his abdomen
I want to see his bowls
Splatter on the ground
The fucking red cloth brown with feces
And then piss on the so called hero

Carnival carnage

I want to see you die
I want to see you die
I want to see you die
I want to see you die
DIE, DIE, DIE, DIE
