Horrors of war

Massive guns open fire
Violence is the only desire
Enemy warriors keep coming
Never ending tide of black iron

Horrors of war

Hulking monsters with great clubs
Baying howls chilling the blood
Awesome killers enter the fray
Now it's time to pray

Impaling them on lances
Crushing bones and every defences
Dragged down and hacked to pieces
We will slaughter your whole species

Horrors of war

Men scream and yell
With claws and axes we fell
Gorge the flesh - Spray the blood
Maiming the virgin slut

Horrors of war

Impaling them on lances
Crushing their bones
Hacking them to pieces
Dismember

Gorge the flesh - Spray the blood

Horrors of war
