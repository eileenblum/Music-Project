[Bonus track]

Blood for the Blood God
Blood - Death - Gore
For the skull throne
Rabid bloodletting
The honour of killing

Forward for your honour, die
I will rip apart
I will spill your blood
There is no honour without blood

Killing in masses
As the slaughter progresses
Blood, gore, crushed armour

Forward for your honour, die
I will rip apart
I will spill your blood
There is no honour without blood

Killing, killing, killing
With the knife and with the saw
Blood for the Blood God
