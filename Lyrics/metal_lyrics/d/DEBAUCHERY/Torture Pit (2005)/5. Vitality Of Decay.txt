Drowned in gore, battle and war
Open sores, decayed whores
Rotten cadavers, Zombie lovers
Father of lies, Lord of the flies

Plage, ravage, rot and death

Death to the clean ones
Bodies with broken bones
Skinless and diseased
Pulpy mass beneath

Mandibles still writhing
And the plague is rising
Wretch of ended life
Born from a dead wife

Plage, ravage, rot and death
