We fight battles in the chaos waste
Crushing and routing the enemy
Battle for supremacy
Slaughtering, hammering, polluting
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Marching to the south in mail clad ranks
Searching for eternal butchery
Armies on the way are defeated
War is coming down from the north
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Torture
Perverse slaughter
Eternal butchery
Endless insanity
Causing mayhem
False redemption
Licking gore
Spilling blood
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
Hordes of chaos
From the north
