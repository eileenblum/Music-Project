We gonna rape the dead
Eating crushed brains out of skulls
In the name of Morgoth
Building a meat hill out of bodies
Slaughter, butcher, maim the wounded
In the name of Morgoth
Untold thousands dead
On the dusty desert field
The corpses raped by the unclean
Scattered organs eaten by maggots
We gonna rape the dead
Eating crushed brains out of skulls
In the name of Morgoth
Building a meat hill out of bodies
Slaughter, butcher, maim the wounded
In the name of Morgoth
Butchered monsters, mail clad man
Rot before the gates of hell
The carnage is over
The dying are in pain
I see mighty warriors dead and cold
On the battlefield the dying mourn
The world lies down in agony
Can't believe in Morgoth's victory
Killing in the name of Morgoth
Killing in the name of Morgoth
