Morgoth is on the way
War is coming
The north is in flames
Balrog legions
Fire dragons
Thousands of orcs
Gothmog killed
In single combat
By Ecthelion the great
Woman raped
Children tortured
The wounded butchered
The fall of Gondolin, Gondolin
The city fights
A thousand burning in the flames
Elves drowning in their own blood
Uncounted orcs dying like files
Choking in the stench of death
Terrifying slaughter â carnage treachery
Tuor butchered the bastard
The fall of Gondolin, Gondolin
Bloodbath â a hard fought siege battle
Crowded together and slaughtered like castle
Bodies torn open â butchery
An orgy of bloodshed and insanity
Hard pressed defenders, enemy soldiers
True carnage, madness and slaughter
We are storming the walls
With fire and steel the city falls
Morgoth is on the way
War is coming
The north is in flames
Balrog legions
Fire dragons
Thousands of orcs
Gothmog killed
In single combat
By Ecthelion the great
Woman raped
Children tortured
The wounded butchered
Blood streaming
Fire burning
Gondolin in ruins
The city falls
Burning in the flames
Morgoth's victory
