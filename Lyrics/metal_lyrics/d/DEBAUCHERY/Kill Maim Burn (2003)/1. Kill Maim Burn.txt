Give suppressing fire move scum
We rip apart
We spill blood
We are gore obsessed
And from demons possessed
We are the warriors of chaos
We spill blood for the lord
For the blood rip apart
We take your skull with axes
Die carving blood, die fucker
In the charnel house of the bloodsuckers
Your head will end as a trophy
Decorated with the intestines of your body
We rip apart â we spill blood
We rip apart â we spill blood
Blood for the blood god
We are damned and demon possessed
We stormed the imperial palace
For glory, gore and our god
10 thousand years of slaughter
10 thousand years of butchery
billions beheaded with axes
a thousand worlds burning in the war
We rip apart â we spill blood
We rip apart â we spill blood
Blood for the blood god
We are damned and demon possessed
We give them the mercy of death
We gonna take their skulls
In this land overflowing with blood
Kill maim burn...
