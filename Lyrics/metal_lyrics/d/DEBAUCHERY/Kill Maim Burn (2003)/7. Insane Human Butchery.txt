Victims
Like cattle
Crowded together
Dismembered
And butchered
In their thousands
Ripped apart
With a knife
And with the scissors
On the meat hook
Drenched in fuel
I see them burning
Hack, slash, kill, burn
Hack, slash, kill, burn
Hack, slash, kill, burn
Hack, slash, kill, burn
Stab to death
Scatter bowels
Rid apart
With a knife
With the saw
With axes
Much blood spilled
Head off
Blood drips on the ground
Human cadavers
Mutilated, dissected
Disemboweled bodies, corpses
Children
Stabbed in the womb
Ripped, slash open, hacked, burned
Perverse, fucking
Butchery
