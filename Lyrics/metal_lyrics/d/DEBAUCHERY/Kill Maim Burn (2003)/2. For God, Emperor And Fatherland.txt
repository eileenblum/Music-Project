Marching off to war
Students and children we are
Fighting to the final breath
Conscripted to death
In the war
World war
War
Trench war
Industrialized
Mechanized
Genocide
Whole generation in the front line dying
Mass murder, the wounded crying
The signal â out of the trench
Few hundred years in blood drenched
Industrialized
Mechanized
Genocide
Crippled for god emperor and fatherland
Coming home with only one hand
Your legs are splattered, spine is broken
It's an honour to be one of the emperors chosen
Machinegun rips us apart
Then bloodshed with the bayonet
Gas attack we are the cannon fodder
With our bodies feeding the meat hammer
In the war
World war
War
Trench war
Dying...
For god, emperor and fatherland
Great Britain 947000 dead
France 1385000 dead
Austria-Hungary 1200000 dead
Russia 1700000 dead
Germany 1808000 dead
Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori
