Marching on
'Til the war is won
We are ruthless
Killing the faithless
Burning their temples
Monuments to false gods
Burning in black flames, conquering Jerusalem

We are fighting in a war of faith
We are marchin' on the last crusade
We are fighting in a war of faith
We are marchin' on the last crusade

Stampede
Over holy ground
We succeed
Honour-bound
Knights of a new age
Knights of the blood rage
Burning the deceivers
Killing the unbelievers
