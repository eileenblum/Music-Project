Warriors, demons
And dragons armed for war
Armies of immortals
Angels with wings of steel
Eternal carnage is our way of life
Killing and bloodshed
We live in an age of strife

In the fires of hell we fight and we fell

Victory awaits

Murderers and killers
And beasts of war
Mighty battles and death uncountable
Axes and swords and weapons of steel
Glory, majesty, brutality

In the fires of hell we fight and we fell

Victory awaits
