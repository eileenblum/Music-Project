Violence is my fuck religion
My best friend is the butcher of bitches
Some call me blood god and the beast
There will be battle, a real blood feast

I am a rape killer, a crazy of the blood
A demon baby, born to fuckin' rock
Clothing of human skin, taken from your kin
An evil from beyond, hell spawn without bond

What are we spawned for, we're spawned to kill
What are we here for, we're here to kill
What do we live for, we live to kill
What are we born for, we're born to kill

Hey, hey, yeah, I am the man in blood
Hey, hey, yeah, I am the man in blood
Hey, hey, yeah, I am the man in blood
Hey, hey, yeah, I am the man in blood

Kill, kill, we are the men in blood
Kill, kill, we are the men in blood
Kill, kill, we are the men in blood
Kill, kill, I am the man in blood

Yeah, I'm a lone ranger, I walk alone
I am a blood beast, my soul finds no peace
I need pain, I'm violence sustained
We are the blood-man gang, killing gives me strength

What are we spawned for?
We're spawned to kill
What are we here for?
We're here to kill
What do we live for, we live to kill
What are we born for, we're born to kill

Hey, hey, yeah, I am the man in blood
Hey, hey, yeah, I am the man in blood
Hey, hey, yeah, I am the man in blood
Hey, hey, yeah, I am the man in blood

Kill, kill, we are the men in blood
Kill, kill, we are the men in blood
Kill, kill, we are the men in blood
Kill, kill, I am the man in blood

Hey, hey, yeah, we are the men in blood
Hey, hey, yeah, we are the men in blood
Hey, hey, yeah, we are the men in blood
Hey, hey, yeah, we are the men in blood
