[Debauchery Rock 'n' Roll]

Bang your head, the music is not bad
Don't be lazy, go crazy
No fillers, only thrillers
Some hot chicks and Rock 'n' Roll

We drink some beer, we drink some whiskey
We like Metal and no Limp Bizkit
We wear leather, we wear chains
If you're a louser, we bring you pain

I don't need the mainstream shit
All this Rap music makes me sick
Fuck Hip Hop
This is New Rock

Yeah, that's the fuckin' overkill
Even more nasty then the bitch from Kill Bill
That's my way, my life, my way of groovin' Metal
I'm always on the hunt, I'm always ready for the battle
I show no mercy, give no quarter
I'm still rockin' and ready for the slaughter

I don't need the mainstream shit
All this Rap music makes me sick
Fuck Hip Hop
This is New Rock
