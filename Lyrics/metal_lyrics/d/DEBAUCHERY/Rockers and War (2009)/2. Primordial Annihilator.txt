[a story about demons and Chaos Gods]

Demon gods from the Warp
Hunting for prey like a shark
Coming forth bringing madness
Massive butchery no less

Madness, killing, murder, war and wrath
Carnage, butchery, armour of iron and brass
Black leather, hooks, wings of steel
Engines of fire and blood, with burning wheels

We were there before creation
Arch enemy
We want your termination
Nightmare creatures with teeth and claws
Making war upon you 'til you fall

Madness, killing, murder, war and wrath
Carnage, butchery, armour of iron and brass
Black leather, hooks, wings of steel
Engines of fire and blood, with burning wheels
