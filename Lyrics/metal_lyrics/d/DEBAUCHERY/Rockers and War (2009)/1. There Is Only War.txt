[siege battle in the 41st millenium]

We are the spirits of war and fire
Ultimate slaughter is our only desire
We are here to bring the pain
We are demons, we are crazy and bloodstained

We live to kill, we live for murder
We are unbrealable, we follow a code of honour
We are armed with axes, marching through storms of death
Out of the living world, bringing the final breath

First through the breach
First among the carnage
That's the end of the siege
Feel my rage

Blood upon virgin earth
Blasphemy and death
Smell the blood I let
Hear my blades

Decapitate, annihilate, butchering
To the battle like cattle to the slaughtering
Let the butchery commence
Live for the violence
There is only war

Massive artillery pieces roar
A whole machinery dedicated to war
Thunder and lightning
Aircraft striking

The barrage stops
There is no escape
The signal is screaming
To kill and rape

Decapitate, annihilate, butchering
To the battle like cattle to the slaughtering
Let the butchery commence
Live for the violence
There is only war
War
Total fuckin' war

That'S the end motherfucker
A brutal death
I kill all you suckers
With metal through flesh
There is only war
