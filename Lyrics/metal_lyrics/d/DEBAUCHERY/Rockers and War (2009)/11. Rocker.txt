[a song about my state of mind]

You think you can humble me
'Cause I'm all alone
But I've got an iron will
And a heart of stone

I'm a Rocker
I can hear their lies
Sometimes I just wanna cry
But my iron will
Gives me the strenght to kill

I'm a Rocker
I bring you death
I'm a Rocker
I bring you pain
I'm a Rocker
I'm here to kill
I'm a Rocker
I was born in Hell
