[a story about the Lord of the End Times and his barbarian warriors]

To war we are marching forth
Fighting battles in the north
To rape and kill and murder
Our gods want the slaughter

Coming forth, bringing pain
With swords and axes, bloodstained
Murderous intent, the will to kill
Battle gives the ultimate thrill

The southern pups mutilated
Their women raped and violated
Coming down from the mountains
Riding through storms and northwinds

Clad in armour, armed for war
Spilling intestines, blood and gore
We are the doomriders from hell
Marching to a screaming bell

Endless warrior hordes on the horizon
Changing the landscape to a warzone
Drenching the snow in blood
Thousand of victims left to rot

Fell creatures from before the dawn of men
We are the butcher clan
We are armed with hammers and axes
To break the necks of the wretches

Full of wrath, coming from the mountains
Clad in dark runes and warpaint
Unholy quest for power
Mandkind's darkest hour

Riding the steed of the apocalypse
Torturing slaves with iron whips
United by might
Ready for the fight
