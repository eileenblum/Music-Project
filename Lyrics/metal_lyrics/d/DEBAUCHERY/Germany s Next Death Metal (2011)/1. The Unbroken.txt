I'm still living
I'm unforgiving
I'm still alive
In an age of strife
I've got an iron will
I am born to kill
Cheated by my own wife
That is motherfucking life

I am invincible
I am undestructable
I am unbreakable
I'm the unbroken

I hate society
And society hates me
I don't give a shit
Fuck that, they make me sick
Apostles of moral
Want it from small boys oral
Politicians talk shit all day
Kill'em all, that's what I say

I am invincible
I am undestructable
I am unbreakable
I'm the unbroken

Yeah motherfucker, that's fuckin' life, motherfucker
We live to kill and we live for murder
We are are cheated by our own wifes
But we still carry on and work harder
Bitch, we rip their flesh from their bones
We are killers of women and children
We show no mercy
And we will never back down, bitch
I don't give a fuck about their opinion
Death metal is my religion
