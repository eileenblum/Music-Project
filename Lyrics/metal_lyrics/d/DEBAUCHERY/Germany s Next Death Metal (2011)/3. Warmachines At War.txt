A 1000 tons of steel
Driven by iron wheels
They will make you kneel
Bristling with cannons
Rending with talons
Killing the morons
Death metal murder
Killing machine of war and pain

We are
Warmachines at war

Titans of war
Blessed by the whore
We yell and roar
Opponents in battle
Slaughtered like cattle
With weapons of metal
Death metal murder
Killing machine of war and pain

We are
Warmachines at war
