Yes we are back in town
And we are honour-bound
We are still painted blood
And we don't give a fuck
We are unbroken
The blood god is awoken
We bring the sound
To the killing ground
We have the groove
And nothing left to lose
Armed with instruments of war
Painted red with virgin's gore

Germany
Germany
Germany's next death metal

We stand together
We are blood brothers
We are lords of battle
We are addicted to death metal
We kill with axes and the chainsaw
We are here, live and raw
We are evil demons of war
Obsessed by fuckin' gore
We are dressed in black and blood
We are the slayer of the fuckin' sluts
We are the zombie horde of death
We are full of anger and wrath

Germany
Germany
Germany's next death metal

Deutschlands
Todesmetall
Kriegsmachine
