If you are some AC/DC rocker
Or if you're listening to Mick Jagger
Perhaps you are some business checker
Or a beggar addicted to liquor

Yeah you like to bang your head
And think yeah: Jack Daniels is not bad
You like to rock, you are born to kill
And Heavy Metal gives you the fucking
Thrill

Here we go again
Come on rocking
Banging your fucking head
Never stopping
Coming in jeans, leather
And some metal shirts
Singing of eagles and dragons
And some other birds
