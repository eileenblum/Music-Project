I don't care what you say
I do it my way
This is Debauchery motherfucker
No pussy music, nothing for suckers

Rock'n'Roll you hear my guitar
Screaming
It's a violent Death Metal feasting
Full of hate and full of wrath
Get out of my way I'm on the warpath

The music is my revenge
Something like your death sentence
Only with your death I will prevail
So I torture you to death with hooks
And nails

Guitars scream
Amps ablaze
Hell raised
Metal On Metal
Right in your fucking face
