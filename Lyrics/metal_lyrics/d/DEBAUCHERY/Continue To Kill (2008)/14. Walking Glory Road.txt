Kill all the suckers
Bring them all to pain
Never give up
Or it's all in vain
We are killers, here to win
We are Debauchery, the living sin

We are the Headbangers from hell
We are the marching to a screaming bell
This is our religion we salute you
To all mainstream loser - FUCK YOU!!!

I fear the destruction might end here
And that will do us no good
Keep the killing hot my friends
Make them bleed and I shall see to it
That on our new world the blood will
Never stop
Death Metal Maniacs
I SALUTE YOU!!!
