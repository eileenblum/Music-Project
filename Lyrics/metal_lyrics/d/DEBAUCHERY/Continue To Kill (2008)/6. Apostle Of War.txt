Press home the fucking attack
To the frontline, never turn back
Expectation to kill
Time for a massive butcher bill

Tangled mass of broken flesh
All that remains of some massice blast
Wreckage and debris thrown  around
Dead bodies of men all over the ground

Attack - Overrun - Counterattack
Breaking some fucking innocent's neck
Shells and bullets, axes and saws
Instruments of killing and of war

A demon coming from hell
Bringing fort dark demonic spells
Bloodied vraters, explosions of gore
Bastards that is war
