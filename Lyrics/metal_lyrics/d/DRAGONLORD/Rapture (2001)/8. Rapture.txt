Babylon fell
Maybe too soon
I did not notice her value
Until I looked into the storm
Why can't you see
When scrolls are drawn
Who will you die for?

Death angels fly across the threshold
Across these blazing shores
For Satan blight the sky

I am ancient
Blasphemous
Nothing left
Pray for war

Embracing evil
A prophecy of war
Dethrone the lord
The great deceiver carries light
Rapture

Join us
With demon swords collide
Black reign for the ages
Surging forth with might

We begin to slowly formulize
Rage on san redemptions
Now and ever after

Onward final battle
[Lead: Smyth]

And now you'll see
Why I was plotting forever
And as you kneel
Make sure my story gets written
End times forseen
No righteous martyr
My will be done

Empire destroyed!

Death angels scorch and burn the sky
Throughout his rigid vortex
Satan fantasized

Annihilated mist
Of utter nothingness
Pray for war

Just below
I'll break the sacred seal
Rapture
