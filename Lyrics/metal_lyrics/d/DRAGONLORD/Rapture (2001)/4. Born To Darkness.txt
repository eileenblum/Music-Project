Sufficed with demons force
A love denied forever for
The priestess who knows no warmth
'Til choking face turns blue

What you got to say
For his love denied
Save your lies for me, hypocrisy
My soul's gone

Hearts ablaze, fall to pieces
Force to bleed then ask me why

Now your life is undone
For my pain is engraved
True delights to beat as one

Into the darkness there
This beauty's beyond compare
From darkness comes shadows

Tortured days without sun
Where all guilt is removed
Ecstasy, depravity
Your soul moves

Lover please
Set us free just to be as one

Into the darkness there
This world's beyond compare
From darkness comes shadows

When pushed beyond the realms of death
One learns the awful truth

It seems my lovewas damned forever
Sometimes disease of life is love
And now I'm forced to take you
True black hearts must die

Don't question me about the things
It's been done
Bewitched and cast upon this tragic
No love

Set us free just to be as one
[Lead: Smyth]

So be the light that shined
Upon the love that died
Trace evil back to power
Transmission, supplied

Who'll be the one
Who wears my sins forever

Entombed in darkness there
This worlds beyond repair
From darkness comes shadows
