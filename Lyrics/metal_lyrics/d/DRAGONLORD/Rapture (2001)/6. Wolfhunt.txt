Death, white fang destruction runs
Roughshod among the pack
With uncontrolled bloodlust

Hunt, thrill of the kill by moonlight
Too wild too tame for this world
Repays all debts in blood
This destroyer

Damned, lycanthropic desire
Praised by the howling one
Bits down the jaws of Luko's
Unleases Hell

Who rules the forest of the night
Red raging eyes howl at the moon
Sets up his next victim to die
Behold! The wolfhunter

Damnation - searing flesh - be gone
So save thyself
Transformation - from anthropis
Into a blood crazed beast

Savagery of the wolf
Rides a scent to find the next kill
Cunning eyes of a sadist
Shadows glow when death's abound
Revelry of the damned
The slaughter ends
When daylight has come
Covered in gore and remorseless
Fear not the silver, live for the kill

One rules the forest of the night
And howls in praise to his god, the moon
Another victim lies in blood
Behold! the forest god
