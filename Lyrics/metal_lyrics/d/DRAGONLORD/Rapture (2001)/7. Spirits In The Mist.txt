I ride beneath this roaring sky
See through the black with eyes of the dead
Cast in the bones, Angel of Death
Thirteen moons, thirteen men, prepared to die
Deep in the mist out of the black
Eaters of the dead they kingdom will fall

Nightfall, silence
Could my eyes deceive me?
Cold blood, freezing
I see spirits in the mist

The fire serpent roars aloud
Beheadind beasts, devourers of flesh
Raising the swords into the night
Calling on the ones who died to give me strength
Into the mist deep in the night
Eaters of the dead thy kingdom will fall

Nightfall, silence
Could my eyes deceive me?
Cold blood, freezing
I see spirits in the mist

This fog allures me to believe
That I have seen not what is real

I stare into this misty sky
Omward to battle deep in the night
Outnumbered, waiting to die
Decapitation of the queen will set us free
Out of the mist heading for death
Eaters of the dead thy kingdom will fall

This fog allures me to believe
That I have seen not what is real
Is it my eyes decieveing me?
So I see spirits in the mist
