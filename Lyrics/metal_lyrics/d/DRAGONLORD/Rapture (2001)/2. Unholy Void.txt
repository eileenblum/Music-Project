Astrophysics tipped the scale
Dimensional fractal nightmare
Celestial mechanics signal cleared
To find out if there is life distant or near

Erase hypotheses quantum
Infinity frontier mission
Vortex behing the sun endeavors
Interstellar signal response

Into the lost
Unholy Void
Timeless and black (black)

Tragedy from a netherworld
Process galactic nebula
Draconian texture synthesis
Forces man to kneel his world

What's involved in
keeping balanced scales
All the stars hiding demigods
In the void axis expands
Universal death horizon
Lead: Smyth, Lead: Peterson

Displacement time travel engaged
The dawning of an astral inferno
Event horizon lost its way forever
Conquered by our own unknown
Estrange

Into the lost
Unholyvoid
Timeless and black
