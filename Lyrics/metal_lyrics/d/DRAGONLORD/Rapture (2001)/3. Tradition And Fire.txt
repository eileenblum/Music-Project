Subjugation fuels
The hatred in our soul
Full destruction upon
The ones that we all loathe
Souls ablaze, out of control
Burning hammers from the north
Down to the south

Retaliation forms
The hanging of our brood
Captured soldier has his eyes pinned
Then removed
Who's to blame? This ruthless war
This devastation puts you out
In the ground

Doctrines received
From tradition and fire
Sealing my fate
Confirm why I was born

Annihilation is
Our anthem ringing true
Fall to pieces as our steel blades
Rip right through
Chaotic raids assume control
Burning torches in the night
To see us through

Conquered nations of our foe
We have subdued
Strength and honor from the helm
We bring to you tempered steel
Of knives and swords
This devastation puts you out
In the ground

Doctrines received
From tradition and fire
Stealing your tomb
Reaffirm why I chose war

Charging attack
Raise the fist of steel
Bring the pain
Rule the nations
Rule the world
Enslave the people
Drink messiahs blood

Raging black auras
Raging a storm
Evil marauders
Sphere of the dead a new system

Subjugation
Fuels the fury in our troops
Golden palace of oppression
Turns into dust
Souls ablaze, a call to war
The foundation now assumes
Assumes control

Decimation is our anthem ringing true
Transformation of the future
Becomes the view
Skys ablaze, departed souls
This devastation puts you out
In the ground

Doctrines received
From tradition forever
Sealing your doom
Confirm why I was lord
