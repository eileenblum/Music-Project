Howling my sins of allegiance
Raising the dagger of conjurer
The chosen will never repent
The covenant of darkness - unholy one
Behold this evil upon us
Remember your promise to serve until death
Bonded by blood - thy will be done!

These evil ways become you!

Gaze into my eyes I'm a devil
I'll give you this key to open the box
Patterns unspoken shall guide thee
Ancient grimoires - thy will be done
Thrust open the chambers of chaos
Destruction to all known religions
This is the end - all saints are dead
This is the end of it all
Behold deaths deconstruction
Forever enthroned, thy will be done!

Necromantic blasphemer
Protect me as i travel
Bastard in the eyes of god
Seed of all things unconceivable

Lucifuge rofocale
Open the seal evil take hold
Lucifuge rofocale
Nowhere to run - this is the end

Neverworld - where brother sold his soul
And he's heartless - his soul will never know
End this world - disastrous harmony
Praise the darkness - alone out in the cold

Growling my sins of allegiance
On inverted cross, the devil grins
Opens his mouth with vengeance
To vomit up my death - apocalypse
Behold the rise of new Babylon
The chosen will never repent
I promise you hell - thy will be done!

Summoning through rituals
Grimorium verum

Take the oath archangel!
We must survive at any cost
Protect me as i travel - unholy one
