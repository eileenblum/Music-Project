Calling father darkness - rise again
Ascend out of darkness

Cast out from heaven
Unholy nightmare
Blade of death - thy broken wing
Shall be the sword that leads the fallen

Sword that makes the dead come to life
Liberate damnation
Sword that stirs a plague full of lies
Baptize despair

Sworn to tear the world apart
Unholy nightmare
Golden age of Babylon
Ungodly phosphoretic spawn

Spawn that makes the dead come to life
Creation with no soul
Spawn that stirs a plague full of lies
Abomination

Shadows glow in molten rage - slowly burned to dust
Forever is the nameless one
That heaven once considered a son
Fallen
Angel
He was not cast out...he jumped!

Damned in black - rise from the mire
Morning star - astral fire
Damned in black - rise from the mire
