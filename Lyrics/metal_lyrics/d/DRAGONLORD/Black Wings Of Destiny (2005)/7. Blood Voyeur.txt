Seeing the world through the raven's eye
Raising the corpse transcending the love
Blasphemous pleasures from netherworlds
Raping the heart that beats no more

Draining her blood
Eternal flames fan the blackest fires
Of the underworld - you taste so good
I have the mark to devoid your soul forever

And so it's done
Many hearts struck by lies of the serpent
The dragonlord
Baptismal blood

Thy will be done
Blessed virtures left unsung
We shall live - on as one
Entangled black hearts devoured

Open your eyes to the netherworld
Feel this death
The curse of our love
Lustful thrusts
To the gods of hell
You're my favorite whore

Only in death will you find love!

Raising the corpse that mourns the light forever
Rip her apart
Taking form impaled and born to darkness
Blood voyeur

Raising the corpse that houses thy pain and pleasure
Queen of whores
Give praise and hails to our lord oh Satan

Thy will be done
Blessed virtures left unsung
We shall live on as one
Entangled black hearts devoured
