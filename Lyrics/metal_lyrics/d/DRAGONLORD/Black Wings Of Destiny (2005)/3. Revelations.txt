Laying in wait to destroy you all
The almighty dragonel
Dormant crooked serpent sleeps
Resurrection pre-destined

Fire breather soon shall rise
Revelations foretold the truth
Prophecies of a dying world

Blood in the streets like a river
Rise up - wipe out the meek with your flame

Humans are trophies for draconis
Talons caked in gore
Darken the earth with your wingspan
Destroy mankind - devour the sun
Death wings flapping are a devil song
Screeching fear forever
Shall penetrate and vaporize
What remains of their dying world

Dragon's breath chars the land
Open death's jaws devouring souls
Dragon's breath chars the land
Bringing forth the solstice
Dragonel initiates
Apocalyptic battles
Scorching the innocent
Red dragon reigns forever

Roaring down an ancient path
Devastation blots the sky
Molten flames light up the night

Blood in streets like a river
Rise up - wipe out the meek with your flame

Revelations ignited....

Valiant resistant won't stop!
Combustive torment

"Behold a glorious red dragon
Who stood before a woman
As she was ready to deliver her child
The beast devoured her son..."

Empowered with the mystical secrets to destroy entire civilizations
The creature toils in the bowels of the earth awaiting resurrection
Slowly the creature crawls as it struggles to break
Free from the planets imprisoning womb
And bring forth the arrival of the dawn of dragonel

Beware the creature has broken out!

Blacken the earth with your wingspan
Talons caked in gore
Humans impaled upon claws
Destroy mankind devour the sun
Death wings flapping are a devil song
Ringing fear forever
All of mankind soon shall fall
Summon the dawn of dragonel
Revelations ignited!
