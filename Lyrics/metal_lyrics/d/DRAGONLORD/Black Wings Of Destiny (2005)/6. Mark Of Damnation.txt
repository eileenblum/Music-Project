Antediluvian ancestors - mark of the damned
Prepare the black oracle
Bring forth waves of crimson mass destruction

Unhallowed earth - we are the chosen
Surging forth so cold and frozen

We will step over your corpse tonight
Nephilim blight
Watching the world fall
Waiting
Watching
Ancient old ones
Thirsting blood till the end of the world

Immortal Methuselah - smash the grail
In nomine vampiris - the night prevails

Antediluvian warriors - bathing in blood
Astral projections arise
Sacred
Hatred
Ancient old ones
Eternal pledge for wars to come

Paradise lost and cursed and oust from heaven

Sacrifice this worthless world
Desecrated hallowed ground
Soon the scales are overthrown
As mankind slowly crumbles
Necromantic rituals of murder for pleasure!

Desecrate this worthless world

Antediluvian ancestors - mark of the damned
Watching the world fall
Waiting
Watching
Ancient old ones
Eternal pledge for wars to come

Immortal Methuselah - smash the grail
In nomine vampiris - the night prevails
