Secutor - pursuer unbound
Killer he wears no crown
Who needs the thumbs to pass judgment
Plunges his sword, well deep inside of you!

This is a war declared for entertainment
Until the end fight on

Hail to the glory of Rome
Bow damnati ad mortem
Down goes the thumbs passing judgment
Justice is served by killing you!

Funeral games shall honor our fallen sons
Once free condemned to savage torture
Aristocrats sit high and watch the battle scorn
Until the end fight on

Enslaved to the war
Brandish weapons proud
Weak ones must fall
Can you hear
The roaring thunder
Of the greatest hall

And the Thracian sword
Can you feel the surge
Roaring out through the empire
Standing alone
Another battle won

The sword is thy soul
Save yourself
Battle on, bless yourself
No one can live forever
Now fight on!

[solo: Livingston]

Funeral games shall honor our fallen sons
Once free condemned to savage torture
Aristocrats sit high and watch the battle scorn
Until the end fight on....

Destruction, Rome's favorite son
The elders, they plot against you
Rolling through all opposition
Never surrender
