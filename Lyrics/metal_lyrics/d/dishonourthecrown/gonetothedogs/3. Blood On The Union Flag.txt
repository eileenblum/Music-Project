Killed on the street, killed in the cells, how many have to die?
The price of silence ends in death, always an alibi.
Why canât they just raise their hands? Stained with the blood of the victims.
No time of death, no witnesses, apparent suicide.
All evidence, cease to exist, itâs just the way things are.
Police brutality, how can they get away with this? Itâs 2012 and still we see injustice in the met.
Why canât they just raise their hands? Stained with the blood of the victims.
Forged on a network of lies, injustice with blood on the union flag.

This is now, a land built for the free, that slowly rots, a dead society.
In times like these itâs hard to see who is the terrorist.
Led to believe itâs all around, but all I see is pigs
Blood on the union flag
