Blue blood lets bleed that vein, the way they've done to us for years, the suffering
This countryâs seen, but still our taxes keep a queen? Democracy? Equality?
A sign of pure hypocrisy, a relic from a worthless past, killing the economy
A fallacy, the real thieves, they think they are a different breed
A different world from what they lead. Parasites that want to feed.
The voice of treason, screaming for equality.
No words of reason for the need of royalty.
An institution of British pride, a constitution of suffering
Consideration of British lives, where the fuck did we go wrong?

Democracy? Equality? a sign of pure hypocrisy, a relic from a worthless past, killing the economy
A fallacy, the real thieves, they think they are a different breed a different world from what they lead. Parasites that want to feed.
Blue blood, lets bleed that vein, the way they've done to us for years, the suffering this countryâs seen, but still our taxes keep a queen?
Bad blood,see the rage, the monarchy is out of date, weâre paying off another debt and still our taxes pay for that.
The voice of treason, itâs loud and clear, gross injustice, it needs to change.
The voice of treason, through the land, discontentment, take them down.
