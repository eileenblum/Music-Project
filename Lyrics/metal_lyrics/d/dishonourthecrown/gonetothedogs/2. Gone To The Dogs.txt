Nothing to strive for and nothing to gain, a nation of anger a culture of blame.
Sit around drinking cheap piss all day and dream of your future, a future of nothing.
They tell you things to help you sleep well at night, but nothing is working the country is bleeding.
Waste of time to make a good plan for life, employment is falling, inflation is rising again.

I am sick of these fucking streets, I am sick of this fucking place.
Theyâre turning the country we love, into divisions of hate.
Igniting the right wing extremes, the liberals are brought to their knees.
More piss poor excuses for this as violence erupts on the streets.
So whatâs so great about Britain today?

And we canât take this any-more,
Because Britainâs rotten to the core and now weâre breeding hate, a generation born too late.
And it feels like we've been going back in time, beyond belief.
When thereâs no escape it feels like destiny, then hope dies.

Whatâs left for the youth of today? But fear and uncertainty.
A life where youâll never achieve, a life where youâll never be free.
Igniting a hatred inside, a warped sense of national pride.
More piss poor excuses for this, the violence erupts on the streets.
So whatâs so great about Britain today?
