They aim to privatise the services you pay for every day, create a cutthroat, unjust capitalist state.
Rely on poverty to keep the balance tipped towards the rich, with cuts to education, NHS and pensions first to go.
Welcome to tory Britain, ambassador to all thatâs rich and great, a coalition donât exist with liberal mouths sewn shut.
Creating subdivisions deep into society keep down the working class and build a nation based on greed.
These are the darkest days, that we have ever seen.

They take away your freedom, take away your basic human rights,
Like dogs with nothing because they think that it will make us toe the line.
Destroy the future, Britainâs built on all this hard work, sweat and blood,
I think the time has come, a time when British people have enough.

These are the darkest days, that we have ever seen, weâre moving backwards to a new reality.
Talk of a new world order? We havenât come that far, weâre moving forward to a world of hate.
These are the darkest days that we have ever seen, these are the hardest times weâve ever faced.
