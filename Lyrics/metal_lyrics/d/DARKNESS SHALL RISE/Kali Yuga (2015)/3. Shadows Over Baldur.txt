Perpetual Golem, Punisher of chronos; Your bone throne is close to collapse.

We have altered our consciousness to fight against you, in your territory.

I've seen drop the demiurge's shadow over Baldur.
It's why Asgard cries. Wotan, eternal warrior; I will accompany your steps to our light dry its thirst.
with these words, which are part of the collective conscious of our divine existence.

Everything is the rotten copy of perfection, is why the creatures roam sadly night after night.
Our souls wander dancing with Valkyries that lead to false wars
