Time's up, it's already done
we never wanted to let you down
yet you've wished for it, fainthearted
Exactly when you gave up the fight

hundreds of battles, nobody could take us down
we as fury, we were ferocious might

we want your sorrow no more, not even your remorse
we want no bullshit, that's enough

we remain firm, in despair
faithful to this regret
more loathing than prayers
we are heading to our ending line

guess what
it will never end

because we feast upon hate
because hopelessness became our deadly arm
because your shitty lives make us so sharp
because our cries demolish this persistent silence
because we will never give up

As you cowardly did
