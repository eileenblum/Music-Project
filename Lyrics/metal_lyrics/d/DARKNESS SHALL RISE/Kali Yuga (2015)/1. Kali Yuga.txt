A street view with blurred vision.
Everything has locks, everything is from someone
everything is merchandise, even their fucking lives.
When you're hungry, the words just fill this hell / dump.

Sacrilegious Canticles, divine confabulations;
Misery is daily in the revelation of beings
who take refuge under Nazarene of their own fears.

The sky turns black, acid rain welcomes our prayers;
Abraxas returns us to the "one",
is our eternal return in this final era.
Save our transcendence and material condemn them.
