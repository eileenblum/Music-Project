The almighty self destroys and laughs
The almighty self rules at the back of my head
The almighty self blindfolds the clarity I once

hadâ¨It feast upon fears and desires in hope of total deception
And she became and agent of the self destruction
She who switched her lovers as the self changes its mind
I swear that I loved her, one short step from losing my life
this tortured heart has resisted, barely beating through all disappointment

I left, I made this decision
Home was the only way to go
But I know that's all within me,
she holds no guilt, I know shes in peace.
Eventually you will be dissolved on ground

The earth will fulfill its master work
Thereâs nothing to be done
I trust the eternal change to the machine of the universe
