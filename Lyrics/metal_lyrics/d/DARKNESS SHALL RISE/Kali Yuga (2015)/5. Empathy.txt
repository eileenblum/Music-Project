As ferocious rain falls onto innocent ones
Innocents fighting compulsorily
In a gray landscape filled with dark clouds
Day by day trapped in the void of their consciousness
Waiting for a tomorrow that will never arrive

Thousands upon thousands fallen, in a storm of delusion
Lost souls, fighting to hold onto something
It becomes easy, so easy to see the end
Could it be worst?

The looming collapse of our hopes
Hopes burnt by the destruction of the fire of arrogance
Is it that hard to see each other?

Of course it becomes harder
inside the smoke that blinds our senses
The immaculated void pouring into our minds
Patterns, models, will be repeated as cycles till the end of time
As blind eyes
As those minds controlled from the depths
Can attain empathy
