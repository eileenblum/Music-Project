In the twilight of the Idols,
icy and fearless life;
There are no replies to our destiny,
fallin' into the epistemophobic abyss.

We die for this.
*
Disinherited!
with our brains fused on acid,
our misery intact,
her eyes filled with tears.
*
Oh, Lucifer, Venus, Lonely Star;
Drag Me to eternal wisdom,
listen this prayer,
make me a "dark life radiant"
*Waning Moon, our arms raise swords;
This alleged truth haunts our divinity.
Black sun, New Sun. Eternally condemned to fight.
Black "Magick": Submit the demons to our will.
