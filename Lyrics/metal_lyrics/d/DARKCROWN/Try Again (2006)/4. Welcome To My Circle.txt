I Welcome you to my circle.
I Welcome you to my hunger
Of glory. My power is in knowing to who to pray.
I think of my dreams,
And I always think of me.
My life finishes where I want. Always to more.

My goals are no long.
My desires are strong,
But I will never stop to attempt everything.

Don't oppose you to my will.
Don't oppose you to what I see.
This is my life. Allow me to live.

Only these conditions:

Don't break my soul.
Don't play with me.
Because I always see you.
(I could see it)

Don't look at me with your prism.
Look how I am, please.

I am tired of hoping
People direct her looks
To the hell hoping to see me, and I am not there.
Now I am prepared
So that people hear me.
This is my life. Allow me to live.
Don't break my soul.
Don't play with me.
Because I always see you.
(I could see it)
