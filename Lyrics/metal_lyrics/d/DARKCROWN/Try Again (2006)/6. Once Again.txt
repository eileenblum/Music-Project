I see you mistaken.
You have been mistreated
By the life that you
Have taken.

How many friends did you
Leave abandoned by the road?
How many times have you told
Yourself "never more?"

Attempt it once again.
Don't lose the opportunity
To enter in this game.
This is your reality.

You are owner of your destiny.
You try to get the goal.
Not to attempt is to fail.
You undertake your road.
You never surrender.
You never abandon.
And never think, my friend,
That this cannot overcome.

Attempt it once again.
Don't lose the opportunity
To enter in this game.
This is your reality.

Attempt it once again.
Don't lose the opportunity
To enter in this game.
This is your reality.
