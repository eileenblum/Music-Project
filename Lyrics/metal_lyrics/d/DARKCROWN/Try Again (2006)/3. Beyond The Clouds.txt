I just wanted to disappear
I didn't want to have more fear
I wanted to show myself even stronger
But the fear returned to me

I learned that I should live
I wished to have wind to fly
To feel me well, to have will
To control if I would die

I only see wars, I don't see peace
That somebody explains to me it
Why so much hate?
Does nobody have soul in all this?

If I see in my curse reasons
If I don't see truth in my world
Only lies without sense
I will feel that I should fly

Although my fear is strong,
Beyond the clouds
I must see my freedom
Without walls.
