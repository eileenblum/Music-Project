Your lacks are here
Don't disappear
You show your force
You don't fail me
And make it well:
You unchain your soul

If you see that there is no exit in your mind
You don't leave it, or you will never learn
Get up again or you will never run
Show you such and like you are
And teach us that you can arrive
In your life you only have failures
That they marked you forever
But they gave you force to rise
And to know how to say: "never"
Your stupidity prevented you to continue well
Your stupidity is behind with the pain
You know: try again
