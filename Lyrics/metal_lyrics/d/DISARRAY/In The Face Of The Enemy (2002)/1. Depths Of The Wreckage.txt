I've been cursed, betrayed
Tortured without remorse in this land of waste
On this earth I decay
Hater of all â an image I portray

For as a child I was convinced
You get what you give, you get what you earn
But now I realize the truth
These words of old were nothing more than false hope

My left swept aside
The corporate American dollar dictates the ride
To my name not a dime
The wealthy laugh and prosper as I die

But as a child I was convinced
You get what you give, you get what you earn
Now I realize the truth
These words of old were nothing more than false hope

Our hearts grow bitter as the truth unfolds
In the depths of the wreckage one word says allâ¦

Hate
