In a frail mental state
Can't pick myself up from this all time low
Looking back on past days
Where I have been, what have I done?
My frustration escalates
To the point of self-extinction

For I have been thrown into this hell
My day to day fight to exist, there's no point in life
Nothing to gain

Hatred builds within me
Blistered mind erosion
Darkness swallows me whole
Demons live in my burned soul

Reached the end of my chain
Can't find a reason to proceed on
Like a pistol, point blank
I'm expected to fucking go off
Innocent lives I'll take
Without reason, without remorse
