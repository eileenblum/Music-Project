I've been given nothing
All that I have I've gotten on my own
Ain't got a pot to piss in
I hope one day I'll reap all I have sown
Seen many peers go to the top
Still these shallow trenches I call home
The system loves to drag me down
But time and time again I get back up

And I stand tall, my pride is bruised yet I'm content
Not all success is measured in dollars and cents
I blink my eyes and your fifteen minutes are up
As time goes by look who's still around

And to this day I know what I'm talking about
To this day I've got both feet on the ground
To this day I play what I feel in my gut
To this day I bow down to no one
To this day

I've been working so long
And still the break I need hasn't showed up
Sometimes I feel like giving in
But something tells me I still ain't had enough
I try and try and try again
To finally gain the status I deserve
Rejection fuels the fire
So set my soul ablaze and watch me burn

In this corporate world the hype and image make me sick
When it's for real the fame and money don't mean shit
I blink my eyes and your fifteen minutes are up
As time goes by look who's still around
