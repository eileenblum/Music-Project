Just because I laugh doesn't mean I'm happy
I was just envisioning your death
Just because I'm known don't mean I got it easy
Actually my life's a total wreck

Just because I speak doesn't mean I like you
I could care less if you live or die
Just because I'm broke doesn't mean I'm struggling
You can't get ahead in this world so I don't try

What's gonna be is gonna be
There ain't a damn thing I can do
Gain some strength from the pain
Or you can die there
It's up to you

Voice of reason

Just because I scream doesn't mean I'm crazy
I'm just relieving stress from my poor mind
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I'm lonely
I've got the same number of friends as my back's got knives
