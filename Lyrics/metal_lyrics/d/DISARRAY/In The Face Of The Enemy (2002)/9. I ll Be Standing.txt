You're just another spoiled fake, upper class ass wipe
Family money paid your way straight into the spotlight
But it all becomes so apparent
Your weakness, despair seem to

Rise above, rise above the second-rate hype
One of those things where you are given more than due
And still you think that the world owes you a favor
That's not the way I feel

You never had your share of hard times and pain, I've had mine
It's been a day to day never-ending uphill climb
Still I go the distance through pain and persistence
While you're content with the boundaries set I define

There will come a day when you choke on your silver spoon
And when you finally reach your rock bottom, just remember

I'll be standing until the death
