The hourglass slowly drains of life
Pressures and stress burn my insides
Taking chances, collect what's mine
Do all I can within this lifetime

In the race for myself
I control the outcome

Coward people conform their minds
Stick with the normal, live half assed shit lives
Not for me I try to be the best
If I fail I'll take the consequences

In the race for myself
I control the outcome
These open wounds I self inflict
These open wounds I self inflict

If I risk nothing
I will gain nothing
I will be nothing
These open wounds I self inflict
