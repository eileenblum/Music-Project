Scenic route to hell with no resistance
Though it's been a struggle it's something I'd never change
Since I was a child I have always known
There'd be many miles of nasty ass road
But compromise equals regret

Around the world enough to find
You go for broke or fall in line
Nothing to fear, could die today
But for now I'm riding down the path I paved

Your negative views do not affect me
You're the definition of what I don't want to be
People waste their lives spinning in the dirt
But when all is said and done what's it all worth?
Yeah compromise equals regret

Around the world enough to find
You go for broke or fall in line
Nothing to fear, could die today
But for now I'm riding down the path I paved
The path of no regrets
