Abuse me for your sole enjoyment
Bore me with your piss pathetic lives
Enjoy the hell you've brought upon me
It's coming back on you multiplied

The never ending quest for it
The never ending quest for revenge

You kick my legs out from under me
Now you'd best watch your back when I rise
Cause I'll break your arms and rip your spine out
Throw glass shavings in your eyes

The never ending quest for it
The never ending quest for revenge

I have traveled down a road paved with tears
I have fought my way through life all these years
But soon I'll get my chance to win
Soon I'll thrive
Soon I will put an end to my strife

Revenge
