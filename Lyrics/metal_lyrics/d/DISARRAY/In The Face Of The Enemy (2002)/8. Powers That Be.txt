Staring in the face of God
Wondering how I let myself fall down this low
I hate myself I hate my life
Wish I could turn back time and not be born

My life

Spend my time in an endless grind
This is what I have become
A victim of a system that I cannot rise above

But I will not submit myself
To your world of greed
I will not surrender my life
To the powers that be
The powers that
Powers that be

All my life I've been a slave
Held down by the factors I can't control
You force feed pain, manipulate
I'm sickened by everything that you stand for

My life

Spend my time in an endless grind
This is what I have become
A victim of a system that I cannot rise above

But I will not submit myself
To your world of greed
I will not surrender my life
To the powers that be
The powers that
Powers that be

Weight of this fallen world pulls me under
Try to lift myself from the ashes

The powers that be
