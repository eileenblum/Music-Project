Something burns in my mind, yeah
Through the mile high flames of hell I walked alone, head held high
Years of struggle and here I stand
Still I have to prove myself
When will I own your respect?
Waited all my life to live
So I could see this day
Invested all my time in this
I will not let you take it away from me

Cause I've come this far and I ain't turning back
Heart filled of rage and war
I will not be taken out

My point of existence, reason to live
My childhood dream, my destiny
My lifelong mission until my final breath
This life's a lesson will I learn from it?

Pushing the boundaries of an indie band
All of this I do myself no helping hand, nothing
Stab me end my suffering
Years of sacrifice and pain
Still the light at the end of the tunnel burns
Waited all my life to live
So I could see this day
Invested all my time in this I will not let you take it away from me

Cause I've come this far and I ain't turning back
Heart filled of rage and war
I will not be taken out

My point of existence, reason to live
My childhood dream, my destiny
My lifelong mission until my final breath
This life's a lesson, will I learn from it or not?

I can't tell if I'll be here past today
So I'll keep moving onward
Until I depart from this world
