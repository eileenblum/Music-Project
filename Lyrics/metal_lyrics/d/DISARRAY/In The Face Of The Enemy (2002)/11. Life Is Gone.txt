I close my eyes and think of ways I can rise above
A world that wants me
To fade away and never matter at all
Nobody told me life would be so unkind
They're always messing with my mind

I'm a survivor
My scars are deep and my body's worn
And while the world cowers
I stare straight into the eye of the storm
Father told me to prepare for a fight
Make the most of your life
That's why

Never back down
Pile on the pressure, gonna roll right through
This time I'm not gonna be sent home
Stand up, scream out
Keep your head held high, yeah win or lose
You've got to do all that you want
Before your life is gone
