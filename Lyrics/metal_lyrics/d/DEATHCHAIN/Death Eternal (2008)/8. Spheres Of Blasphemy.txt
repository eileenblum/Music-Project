No longer shall they stand back
As mankind awaits it's savior
The creation of something greater
It shall swallow them alive
The liberation of those kept secret
Abnormoties of another kind

Unnatural shapes and forms
Unbound from the clutches of mans mind
There are paths to the unseen
These are the paths of the unseen

There are gods
Within those spheres
There are gods
Blasphemous ones
You shall fall
Children of the most low
You are nothing
Born to serve all

Spheres of blasphemy
No earthly creature bleeds
Spheres of blasphemy
No flower shall bloom
Spheres of blasphemy
Black is the day of doom
Spheres of blasphemy
No earthly creature bleeds

Hatred clears the clouded sight
Fear brings life new meaning
Safety, it means nothing
When hell is opening the gates

From within the spheres they will come
Born of blasphemous seed
Hells within these spheres
Unlock the portals
Eyeless masters from beyond
Behold this furnace nation
Age old mysteries
Divine entities
Ageless spheres of blasphemies

Spheres of blasphemy
No creature breeds
Spheres of blasphemy
No flower bloom
Spheres of blasphemy
The day of doom
Spheres of blasphemy
The spheres of blasphemy

There are gods
Within those spheres
There are gods
Blasphemous ones

The creation of something greater
It shall swallow them alive
The liberation of those kept secret
Abnormoties of another kind
It shall swallow them alive
