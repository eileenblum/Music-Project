As you collapse on the altar o'child of light
When the cold light pierces through
You pray for forgiveness and redemption

Be the rope that binds the weak
Take them deeper downward
Be the choice they can't neglect
Be the razor, be the hammer and the nails

Reveal the antagonist
Let the powers black flow on through

Be the rope that binds the weak
Take them deeper downward
Be all the chains bound so deep
Be the razor, be the hammer and the nails

Death's true embodyment

As you see the light of all lights
You know you are on your way-
These are the ways of the opposer
Divine are his ways
Nightmares in flesh and blood
As you are sworn beneath

Hollow epoc of your life now wiped away
With a crystal clear mind
To march through the gates

Death's true embodyment

As you see the light of all lights
You know you are on your way
These are the ways of the opposer
Divine are his ways
Nightmares in flesh and blood
As you are sworn beneath

Hollow epoch of your life now wiped away
With a crystal clear mind
To march through the gates
