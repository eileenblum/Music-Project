A coming age of chaos!

Come feed the relentless forces
So that chaos may rise
Death will be brought forth with ferocious anger

And let the scythe sweep the lands
Primeval actions will commence
So that the furious flames may start to rise

Newfound wisdom from within the secrets of the void
With clarity in their hearts and minds
Those devoted to damnations call
Shall let there lifeblood flow

Through death and destruction
Violence and odsession
They will conquer â all

Now bodies twitch in the mind...

From beyond where reality has lost it's grip
Where forsaken souls must hide
In the place where everything ceases to crist
Where all living shall perish
Deep down in the pils of madness
This is where the tomb of men lies

Song of chaos and the void

Now bodies twitch in the mind...

Newfound wisdom from within the secrets of the void
With clarity in their hearts and minds
Those devoted to damnations call
Shall let there lifeblood flow

Come revel in sin and all that they despise
These rules of living crists no longer

Let death sweep the land
And chaos reign above us all
Failing once more and seeing the demise

From beyond where reality has lost it's grip
Where forsaken souls must hide
In the place where everything ceases to crist
Where all living shall perish
Deep down in the pils of madness
This is where the tomb of men lies
