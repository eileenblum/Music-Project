Titans awake!

You have followed blurred footprints
The tracks of living gods
You've come close to the abysmal ones
Question your sanity
As you wonder in pools of blood
Moonless nights of fear and death
Lost now in the forbidden world

Walking nightmares
Monstrous beyond description
Like planets they collide
Shifting mountains with their clash
Overlords of the poisonous soil
Ever hungry to dominate
Summoning storms and forging
Aeons in iron spheres

Flee before the seal of titans
Don't approach the deathless ones
Flee before the seal of titans
Don't approach the kings of the void

Watchers of the seas of Absu
They were, they are and they shall be
For this land was given to those beyond
Who are without beginning or an end

Flee before the seal of titans
Don't approach the deathless ones
Flee before the seal of titans
Don't approach the kings of the void

In a world where light is absent
The dark stars guide their path
Isolated world of demonic rulers
Denied from mortals to be seen

Rulers of black earth
Denied from the mortals to be seen

They were
They are
They shall be
And you shall behold

It's the triumph of titans

Flee before the seal of titans
Don't approach the deathless ones
Flee before the seal of titans
Don't approach the kings of the void
