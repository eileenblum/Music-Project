Unspoken is the covenant
Between men and the black mother
Unwritten is the covenant
Between men and the black mother

Al Azif â I've seen all but the echoes of the mist
So grant me gift that opens my second sight

Shadows that I know not of
They hide the aeons dawn
The dawn of thousand pleasures
The dawn of Niggurath
Enter the flesh of thy servant
For I am a temple of yours
Enter the soul of thy infant
Let me see the walking dead

I make the signs
I speak the words that openeth the door
Come forth I say
I turn the key... now walk the earth once more

Clouded mass appears
The sound of the hooves
Clouded mass appears
The silence of the hooves
As we invocate
The sign of the horns
As we invocate
Ia! Shub-Niggurath!

Risen up from my slumber
I have come with a thousand young
Pledge me your service
Slay all that are not of my blood
Goddes of the empty space
Who commands the wraiths of illness
Enter this flesh black mother
And let me see the malking dead!

A'ai y'gatu i'il ro'kanah

I make the signs
I speak the words that openeth the door
Come forth I say
I turn the key... she walk the earth once more

Clouded mass appears
The sound of the hooves
Clouded mass appears
The silence of the hooves
As we invocate
The sign of the horns
As we invocate
Ia! Shub-Niggurath!

Imas, meghaymnko

So closeth the gate and it's scaled
With the sign of koth!
