The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear
And the oldest and the strongest kind of fear
Is fear of the unknown

I dream of the day when they shall rise
And drag is down to the depths below
I dream of the day when the land shall sink
And the sea enslaves us all

For I have drifted endlessly
Beneath the scorching sun
And felt the despaired solitude
Before those stygian depths
Climbed through the pitch
Black realms of darkness
And survived the fathomless
Chaos of eternal night

See the nightmares made flesh
As they rise from the corners of this earth
To witness the monolith of death
Made before man was born

In my thoughts, in my dreams
Madness is haunting me
In my thoughts, in my dreams
Dagon is staring me
In my thoughts, in my dreams
Enslaved by morphine
In my thoughts, in my dreams

Ask yourself why the stars are not right
Desire to feel firgetfulness of death

In my thoughts, in my dreams
Lies my drugged sanity
In my thoughts, in my dreams

We all must bow before the idols cast in stone
As the great flood wipes with tides of black
The end is coming â monolith now shines death
No more man... as the sea covers the earth

Ask yourself why the stars are not right
Desire to feel firgetfulness of death

In my thoughts, in my dreams
Enslaved by Dagon
In my thoughts, in my dreams
