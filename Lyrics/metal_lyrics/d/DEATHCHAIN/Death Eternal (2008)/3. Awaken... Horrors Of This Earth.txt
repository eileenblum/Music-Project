Lords from beyond this world of ours
Gather your strength to rid this earth
Unleash your immense powers
This breed needs to exist no more
Cease the pulse of this being, now!
Let its skin grow cold
Let the annihilation begin
Behold the herds now scatter

The raging fires lick the flesh
Chains tear their victims from the shadows

Hellsfire burns the flesh
Furious winds rip the skin
The rest will be drowned in filth
Awaken horrors of this earth

The tide shall wipe out this race
And erase it all
Dark as it may seem
Inevitable awakening...

Their minds are rotting... slowly they fade away
As man enslaves itself into eternity's grip
Unkowing of the coming dawn of defeat
All corrupt and rotten to the core

Hellsfire burns the flesh
Furious winds rip the skin
The rest will be drowned in filth
Awaken horrors of this earth
Awaken... the horror... the horror
