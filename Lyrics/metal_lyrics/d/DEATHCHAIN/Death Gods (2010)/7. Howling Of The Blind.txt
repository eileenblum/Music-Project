[Music &amp; Lyrics by Corpse]

Azathoth!

In the center of all, where worlds born and fall
Where dwells the Demon Sultan
Azathoth - The blind maelstrom of madness
Azathoth - The father of creation's uncreation

Imperfect and crippled cosmic entity
Never satisfied, endless devourer of all
The Vortex - At the center of chaos
The Vortex - Into which all returns

There is balance in chaos
An essence of the Black Throne

There is order in chaos
That creates and destroys

Great Tetragrammaton
Reveal the void
Shatter the spheres of illusion
Make the world undone

Great Tetragrammaton
Name the void
The void that will swallow all
The howling of the Blind

[Solo: Kosti]

Great Tetragrammaton
Reveal the void
Shatter the spheres of illusion
Make the world undone

Great Tetragrammaton
Name the void
The void that will swallow all
The howling of the Blind

[Solo: Corpse]

Pipes the flute from beyond
Each note a breath of cosmos
Consuming birth-giver, Azathoth

In the center of all
Where worlds born and fall
Dwells the Demon Sultan, Azathoth

Azathoth!
May your chaos sound forevermore

Azathoth!
May your chaos sound forever
