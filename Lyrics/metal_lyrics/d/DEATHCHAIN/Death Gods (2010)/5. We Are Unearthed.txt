[Music by Corpse and Cult, Lyrics by Corpse]

[Solo: Cult]

We are the storms
We are the tides
We are the moon
We are the sun
We are the rapture
We are the decay
We are the voices
We are the echoes of those that were before

There are those that were
There were those that are

Who went unseen
Who were forgotten
In shadows

We are unearthed
Revealed to all
The faces of horror
The mirrors of time

Time shall not pass us by
Time shall not forget our might

We are those that were
We were those that are
In the echoes of time

Rising from the faults
Rising from the pits
Rising to greet the stars

We are unearthed

Earth becomes a grave
A kingdom of raining ash
Where lava streams run wild
Burning all that is left

Now the stars are burning
The cycle is ending
The kings are marching
To the worlds beyond

[Solo: Corpse]

We'll be the storms
We'll be the tides
We'll be the moon
We'll be the sun
We'll be the rapture
We'll be the decay
We'll be the voices
We'll be the echoes of those that were before

Time shall not pass us by
Time shall not forget our might

As one cycle ends, another one begins
Our flesh is meaningless and will be forgotten
Only the abyss remains in the ever-rolling dark
