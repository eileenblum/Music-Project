[Music &amp; Lyrics by Corpse]

Yiii-eeee Nyarlathothep!

Whispering of the faceless
Devouring sorrow of the earth
Walker of the cold wastes
A shadow out of time
Mesmerizing!

Yiii-eeee Nyarlathothep!
Lord of Death
And the blind gods dance
As the Chaos crawls

Drawn towards the infinite horrors of beyond
Where the everlasting walls of Kadath shine
Where forever echoes the notes of the blind
Where god's are eternally enslaved by Chaos

Losing awareness and soon to fall
Follow the monstrous atrocity
A dream you cannot deny
A dream inside a dream

Black seas of infinity
Dwell in utter silence
Beneath the thousand-faced moon
The Chaos crawls

Sardonic laughter - voice of the void
Roba El Khaliyeh - the empty space

Echoes of the black throne
What used to be, shall be again

A second storm coming
A storm of resurrection
From the desert's of Roba El Khaliyeh
Come, bring death to all!

[Solo: Cult]

Yiii-eeee Nyarlathothep!
Lord of Death
And the blind gods dance
As the Chaos crawls
