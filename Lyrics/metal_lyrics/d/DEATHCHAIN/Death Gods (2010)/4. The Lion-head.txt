[Music by Cult and Corpse, Lyrics by Cult]

[Solo: Cult]

Lamashtu!

Demigoddess the mighty lion-head
The daughter of dark deserts
Demon goddess, Lamashtu
Succubus, in dark dreams

Haunting eternally in the nightmares of men
Malevolent destroyer of life
Lifeless, oh so lifeless is Thy gaze
In despair, all men fall in front of Thee

A death in the cradle, brought by the Childless One
Listening to the fetus? breath in silence

Dead children upon Thy feet, piles of dismembered men
Torn pieces of virtuous women, black blood from Thy fruitless womb
Haunting eternally in the nightmares of men
Lifeless, oh so lifeless is Thy gaze

Lamashtu - There shall be no prayer against Thee
Lamashtu - No hope for the one who is touched by Thee
Lamashtu - No return for the man who caresses Thee
Lamashtu - Doomed are the ones who meet Thee

The red moon is Thine, all hope is crushed before Thee

Demonic Seducer, Haunting Evil

[Solo: Cult]

Demonic Seducer, Haunting Evil

[Solo: Corpse]

Demonic Seducer, Haunting Evil

Lamashtu - There shall be no prayer against Thee
Lamashtu - Doomed are the ones who meet Thee

Killer of the innocent, dark goddess Lamashtu
