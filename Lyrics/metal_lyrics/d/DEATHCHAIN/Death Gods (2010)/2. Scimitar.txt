[Music: Cult &amp; Corpse, Lyrics: Cult (except Akkadian magical voice by Frater Saibot)]

Å ulmum IÅ¡tar! Å ulmum IÅ¡tar!
An empire of insanity, in dominions of astral dark
Through the distortion of fear, through the flames of Samael
In front of the stairs of the ziggurat, sound of severed heads falling
Skulls smashing down those stairs
Madness - insanity - scimitar - beheading
Morningstar, grant the adept with Thy knowledge - Inana
Morningstar, where the twilights meet - Inana
Eveningstar, bless the adept with Thy power - Astarte
Eveningstar, spread your veil of black - Astarte
Mighty goddess of the Underworld, Dragon of power
Lend us Thy blood-stained scimitar - Behead
Stand by our side, in the dawn of a new creation
Fly, RED angel of doom... in the BLACK night sky

[Solo: Cult]

Bless the adept with power!
Pará¹£um Å¡a emÅ«qim!
Stand by our side in war!
Pará¹£um Å¡a nukurtim!
A black stream is flowing from the bronze lions' jaws
As eight rays from the pools of blood
Bless the adept with power!
Pará¹£um Å¡a emÅ«qim!
Stand by our side in war!
Pará¹£um Å¡a nukurtim!
Pará¹£um Å¡a erá¹£atim!
Pará¹£um Å¡a UÅ¡umgallatim!
Morningstar, where two twilights meet - Inana
Eveningstar, spread your veil of black - Astarte
Finally at the top of the stairs, before the entrance
Entering Her temple, the temple of the Death Goddess...
