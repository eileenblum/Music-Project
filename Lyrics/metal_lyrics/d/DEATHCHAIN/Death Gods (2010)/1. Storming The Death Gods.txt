[Music by Corpse and Cult, Lyrics by Khaos &amp; Corpse]

Storming the death gods!

As time turns backwards
Earth dissolves in chaos whirlwinds
Slowly death crawls forth
In a volcanic storm

This is when mankind will lose its struggling pulse
To those in control

Nothing will grow, nothing will move, all is still
Man's existence in eclipse
This is the end complete

[Solo: Corpse]

When poison runs viciously
Disease rages in your hearts
That is when they will ascend
From the seas, from the soils
Echoes a thousand cries
Breaking the dormant silence
Now entering the decay

Storming the death gods
A world inverted

Malicious beings from the molten core
Spitting out locust swarms and vitriol

Penetrates the earth's skin!

Insanity reigns your consciousness
And the blood runs black
This is when they will ascend
Souls corrupt burning bright
Reign now Lord of Flies
Empires fall in rapture
An eternity in decay

[Solo: Cult]

Storming the death gods
A world inverted

Malicious beings from the molten core
Spitting out locust swarms and vitriol
Penetrating through the earth?s skin
Empires fall in rapture
A world inverted
Storming the death gods
