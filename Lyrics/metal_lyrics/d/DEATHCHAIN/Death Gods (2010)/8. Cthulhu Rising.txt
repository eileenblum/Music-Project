[Music Corpse and Cult, Lyrics by Corpse]

In His house of stone
Great Cthulhu lies
Dead but dreaming, the awakening

Cthulhu Fhtagn

What has risen may sink
And what has sunk may rise

Ia! Ia! Ia Cthulhu!
Ia! Ia! Ia Cthulhu!

In the womb of stone beneath the tides
The Sleeper dreamed of triumph
In the ageless chasms long forgotten
The Warrior dreamed of vengeance

City of stone where dreamed the dead
The formless, the feared, the dread
Cthulhu fhtagn!

The Abyss that devours the sun
will soon be at wake
The seal of Hypnos is shattered
and the stars conspire no more

The One that carried the weight of the water
Who outlasted aeons in His watery tomb

O Great shaker of mountains
Arise from the chambers of time

Cthulhu Rising!
Cthulhu Rising!
Cthulhu Rising!
Cthulhu Fhtagn!

The madness from the sea
The ancient dead that none shall defy
The horror from the pits
Deep One that none can deny

Cthulhu Rising!
Cthulhu Rising!
Cthulhu Rising!
Cthulhu Fhtagn!

Pillars ascend from the depths of unknown
Sothoth shall open the gates
Things that are not from this world
Liberated and crawling onward

[Solo: Corpse]

Mountains will fall, deserts will drown
Earth will crawl and earth will beg
Oceans will boil, thunder will rage
Earth will coil and earth will beg

The One that carried the weight of the water
Who outlasted aeons in His watery tomb

O Great drowner of the elders
Arise and claim thy throne
