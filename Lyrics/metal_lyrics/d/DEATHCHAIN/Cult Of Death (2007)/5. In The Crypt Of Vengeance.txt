[Lyrics: Corpse, Khaos]

In my dreams of the black
I'm dwelling within
The place beyond my memories
It's haunting me

As I'm walking down the steps made of stone I remember
The curse I was once set out to cast from below
I know the doctrines of left hand path - those secrets
I felt the presence of the ancient one cast in stone

I know I've stood here before
As I sought the guidance from the dead
I bow before the altar
Inside this circle of sin

In the crypt of vengeance
Memories reborn
In the crypt of vengeance

The king of reprisal stands before me ten feet tall
He once ruled from the throne of chaos with deadly mass
He led the armies of the vengeful dead through magic black
But the highest law did bind him down to the crypts below

From beyond the stoned skin
Unleash the vengeful dead
Open the sarcophagus
I know there lies a king

Rise from the crypt

This place was drowned in black
Forever hidden from mankind's eyes
Its wrath was choked by the blood spilled
Entangled by the powers of the lost

This king refused to bow down before any gods
But Hell's immense wrath... it can't be fought

Now my world is drowning in blackness
As the Hellish Ones are approaching
Beyond life's gates they're lurking
Waiting to grab a hold of this world

This place was drowned in black
Forever hidden from mankind's eyes
Its wrath was choked by the blood spilled
Entangled by the powers of the lost

As I start to question my sanity visions come clear
I shall embrace this lunacy - remain here
When all is lost inside this dream I am reborn
But awoken from its grip I feel I've lost it all

In the crypt of vengeance
Memories reborn
In the crypt of vengeance
Memories reborn...
