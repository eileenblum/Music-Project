[Lyrics: Khaos]

I desire for the dead
For the cold body blue
A love for the rotten youth
Inside the grave lies my truth
This growing sickness takes me beyond

I'm lost in my carnal ways
Dead call pounds my head
The Hell I've built around me
(I have) no wish to remain sane

My desire takes me there
Under nightly moon
My love for the rotten youth
My soul dwells in sickness
The dead force me to carry on

It haunts me, their calling, it burns me - necrophiliac lust
It haunts me, dead calling, it burns me - psychopathic lust
It burns me - necrophiliac lust
Dead calling - psychopathic lust

Now bleed for me whores
Bleed for the death and life
I'm losing my soul
This very night - I've become whole
Bleed for me whores
Bleed as only you can
I'm losing my soul
This very night - I've become whole

I see a mirage amongst the tombstones
My lust for the dead can't be controlled
Their bodies await me, this I know
A hellish fiend amidst the stones

I'm hacking through the coffin wood
These whores can't reject me
Hallucinations - I'm painting their horror
Their flesh is my canvas

The dead whisper my name
With lust and perversions
A cold grip of the shovel
Takes me much closer
To you...

I desire for the dead
In the light of the moon
A love for the rotten youth
Inside this Hell I feel like god
This growing sickness takes me beyond

So now my visits last longer
I lay among their flesh and bones
I love the stench, I love the smell
I'm hacking through the coffin wood

The urge burns my soul
Necrophiliac lust
