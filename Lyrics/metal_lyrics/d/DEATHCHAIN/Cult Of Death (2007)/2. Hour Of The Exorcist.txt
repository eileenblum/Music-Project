[Lyrics: Khaos, Bobby]

Sacrificed!
The priest is lost
He got demonised
As the air got stale and cold

One candle is the only light
Just crumbled notes and a chain with crucifix

By reading the notes it got clearer
The priest has gone much deeper

"I have no choice but to give in
 I feel the horns surrounding me"

"Futile light
 God will you come and save me?
 Holy light
 Come cleanse me!"

The written word betrayed me - in the hour of the exorcist
My only god couldn't save me - in the hour of the exorcist
This holy doctrine failed me - in the hour of the exorcist
The unruly black did take me - in the hour of the exorcist

This victim of black possession
He did not end this session

All the notes
Were filled with fear and anger
All against
His beloved saviour
It became more violent towards the end
Like the ramblings of a madman

"I'm trying to heal the possessed
 With my holy rites
 But the demon is too strong
 It's driving me insane
 Oh, father
 I feel the shadows closing in
 The burden is crushing me
 I can not take it any more
 All this lunatic blasphemy"

"As I look into the mirror
 I see a pale reflection"

The site had traces of struggling
Blood stains and water mixed with vomit
The walls had many cracks showing in them
The floor had been licked by the flames

The written word betrayed me - in the hour of the exorcist
My only god couldn't save me - in the hour of the exorcist
This holy doctrine failed me - in the hour of the exorcist
The unruly black did take me - in the hour of the exorcist

"I see a pathway opening
 The walls are shaking, trembling
 Bright light is deceiving
 It unleashed the hell within me"

"The horrors shown unto me
 I bow down in defeat..."

The truth remains a mystery
How they vanished from this room
