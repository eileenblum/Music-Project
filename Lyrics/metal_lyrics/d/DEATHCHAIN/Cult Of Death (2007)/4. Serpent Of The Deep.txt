Baad Angarru

Arise - horned serpent of the deep
Awake - Great spirit of the deep

Serpent of the deep - serpent of the deep
Serpent of the deep - awake from eternal sleep
Serpent of the deep - Ninngizhidda
Open the gate for me

You who dwell in Cutha, thee I invoke
In the name of Enki, now arise

Serpent of the deep - serpent of the deep
Serpent of the deep - awake from eternal sleep
Serpent of the deep - Ninngizhidda
Open the gate for me

The watcher stood fast
And spoke unto me
Queen of heavens
This is the land of Cutha
The land of no return
The dreaded black earth
Queen of heavens
This is the realm of Absu

For you have entered the gates of Ganzir
Through the seven steps
Down to the frightful pit

Oh great gatekeeper
Let me pass to the lands of Kur
Open the gate! lest I cause the dead to rise
Lest I attack the door
Lest I break apart its bars
Open the gate! or the dead
Shall devour the living

Serpent of the deep - serpent of the deep
Serpent of the deep - servant of Ereshkigal
Serpent of the deep - Ninngizhidda
Open the gate for me

Now hear me mistress, queen among the gods
I will announce thee, before the queen of death

Ereshkigal, thy sister stands before the gate
Daughter of sin, she awaits
Go watcher of the gate, open the door for Ishtar
And treat her as it is written
In the ancient covenant

Ninngizhidda lost the bolt from the hatch
And darkness fell upon the Ishtar
Dark waters rose and carried the goddess of light
Onwards to the kingdom of night

And the serpent spoke: enter...
And Ishtar entered

Before the land of Kur
Before the Cutha depths
She lost her talismans
Severed from the upper worlds
Before the queen of death
She lost her seven powers
'Cause it is the covenant of old
Set before time

The gatekeeper removed the seven jewels
The jeweled robes of Ishtar he took away

Serpent of the deep - serpent of the deep
Serpent of the deep - bows before Ereshkigal
Serpent of the deep - Ninngizhidda
Open the gate for me

Now she dwells in Cutha without food of light
Bound in darkness in the sea below the seas

Against her eyes - demons of the eyes
Against her heart - demons of the heart
Against her head - demons of the head
Against entire body - demons of Kur
