[Lyrics: Khaos, Corpse]

One single sweep across this earth
A hellish brush of vengeful inferno

Spitting forth blasphemy
Killing your inbred god
The coming witchstorm
Thy kingdom gone

So came the arrival, burning
Ages of denial, the past tragedies
Misery, chosen to burn for witchery

They suffered for nothing
A sacrifice for your god
In the flames they were twitching
A twisted sight to see
The haunting memories
Kept the hate alive
And awoke the spirits dead
From the ashes were they laid

The sinful will gather in masses
Ancient horror, ancient fears
Cold as graves, cold as stones
Ungodly hour brought the fear
This hellish flame will cleanse the earth

Victims of no known truth
They suffered endlessly

This is the rise of reason
This is your punishment
This is the fall of man
The cursed ones' inheritance

The sinful will gather in masses
Ancient horror, ancient fears
Cold as graves, cold as stones
Ungodly hour brought the fear

Accused by hypocrites
This is where your holy cross fits

So came the arrival, burning
Ages of denial, the past tragedies
Misery, chosen to burn for witchery

The crushing revenge kept them all alive
Waiting deep in the dark
Time for them to arrive

So came the end
From down below
Never forgotten
The coming witchstorm
The past comes alive
No more persecution
Only deathlike silence
Before the witchstorm

These dark saints give no protection
And these vicious angels shall
Guide them the wrong way
Total black and utter chaos
Your heaven's gone, you righteous ones

The sinful will gather in masses
Ancient horror, ancient fears
Cold as graves, cold as stones
Ungodly hour brought the fear
This hellish flame will cleanse the earth

So came the arrival, burning
Ages of denial, the past tragedies
Misery, chosen to burn for witchery
