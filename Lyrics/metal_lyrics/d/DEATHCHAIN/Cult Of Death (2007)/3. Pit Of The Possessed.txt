[Lyrics: Corpse, Khaos]

What dreams may come
Of the paradise lost
What dreams may come
Of the endless beyond

I'm truly lost
In this land of formless rebel king
And forever lost
Far beyond your worthless trinity

Without a sound they speak to me
Without a voice subconsciously

Eerie blackness devouring all in its path
Endless echoes
Laughter of the demon king
Face of the unknown
Seeks for deliverance
Pit of the possessed
Place of many deaths

Enslaved black earth
Burning fires of Gehenna

They're bound to this pit forever
Obsessed by the evil within
Loathing this being called man
Invoking the ancient dead

I sought Hell for answers
I called out to god
If this to be the truth
I'll accept my reward

What dreams may come
Of the paradise lost
What dreams may come
Of the endless beyond

Black blood runs through their veins
It's keeping the abyss alive
Lost souls feed this power
That is ruled by total control

Now I see the black earth growing
Now revealed for all men
Tempting them to open up the gates
And to enter this world of suffering

I sought Hell for answers
I called out to god
If this to be the truth
I'll accept my reward

They're bound to this pit forever
Obsessed by the evil within
Loathing this being called man
Invoking the ancient dead

Without a sound they speak to me
