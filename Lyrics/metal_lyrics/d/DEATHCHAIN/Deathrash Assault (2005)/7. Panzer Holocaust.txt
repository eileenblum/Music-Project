[music: Corpse lyrics: Bobby]

Trapped in by panzers in 1942
Allied troops forced under siege by the axis
Blitzkrieg doom tigerpanzers spitting death
Afrika korps unleashed in for the kill

Devastating force superior tanks of the iron fist
Cunning assaults renewed the rules of war
Ordered to kill for the iron cross
A ruthless massacre for the legions blood-stained

Crawlers ripping flesh as they rush thru the lines
Battalions of wehrmacht commands from ss
Explosions of horror the panzers of doom
The desert rats their lines will fall soon

Devastating force superior tanks of the iron fist
Cunning assaults renewed the rules of war
Ordered to kill for the iron cross
A ruthless massacre for the legions blood-stained

Panzer holocaust - horrors of the war
Panzer holocaust - horrors of the war

[solo: Turbo J-V]

Total destruction as they rush thru the mines
Infantry dies in deadly rapid fire
Bloody furrows filled with headless soldiers
Bunkers chrushed down by the tanks from hell

Panzers roaming thru death so vile and cruel
The desert war it shows no mercy gory is the sand
Pride is just for fools who face the deadly tools
Of reign of terror fear and war
It's panzer holocaust

Reign of terror, fear and war
It's panzer holocaust
