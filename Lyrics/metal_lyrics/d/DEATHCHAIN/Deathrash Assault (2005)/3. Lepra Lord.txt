[music &amp; lyrics: Corpse]

He was trapped to beyond, in the times of grace
When the holy men sealed his grave
But he did not die, the spirit lived on
And the evil would someday reborn
Now the Lord has returned, the crypt lies hollow
And his coffin had broken to dust
Lord of the sick - this rider dressed in death
And he's riding on a nine horned goat

"Leave the ill outside your door, and I shall wake them up decade of decayed has began!"

Lepra Lord - Lord of the sick
Lepra Lord - Spawn of the beast

Lord of the sick - the mouth of the Devil
Is gathering the sick one by one
"Leper, famine, fever and the Black Death
Arise and follow me home!"
Now their march has began, towards the depths of deep
And the Lord shall return to his throne
The throne made of bones bears the sign of the beast
The sign of the immortal king

"Doctrine of the rotten, is not ment for living to see so look away, or your eyes will bleed!"

[solo: Turbo J-V]

Lepra Lord - Lord of the sick
Lepra Lord - Spawn of the beast
Lepra Lord... Spawn of the beast... Lord of the Sick

Travelling the paths, to the darkest deep
Into blackened void, beyond the molten sands

[Solo: Turbo J-V]

Lord of the Sick...

The sick chants a spell, as they march on and on
The hymn of the dead, unholy eerie song

Sky cries thunder, as the gates are closed
And the lord has returned to his home
Someday he'll return, with the sick by his side
And the heaven's shall weep again

Lepra Lord - Lord of the sick
Lepra Lord - Spawn of the beast
