[Music: Corpse. Lyrics: Corpse &amp; Bobby]

Ego Sum Papa! [x4]

I am the pope!

...and he came from the valley of the shadow of the death with him came the scourge
Eyes full of hate he had lost his faith no longer a man of god
The scourge of the famine the scourge of the locust this is "a gift" from your lord
So what do you think of your god now as the rivers are turning to red?

Hear me as I say there will be hell to pay
People shall die under the god-forsaken sky

Nw hear these words I say - he is the venom preacher
Forsake your god today - he is the venom preacher
So throw your faith away - he is the venom preacher
So throw your god away - he is the venom preacher

Preaching death...

I heard a laugh of the babylon's whore as the Lotan was rising to the shore
Ten horns from the east they belong to the beast the beast of revelation
I've seen the evil rise and stared to it's eyes oh yes it's coming for sure
There's still time to join our horde the horde that will rape the lands

[solo: Bobby]

Your cross turned me down
So I turned it upside down

Now hear these words I say - he is the venom preacher
Forsake your god today - he is the venom preacher
So throw your faith away - he is the venom preacher
So throw your god away - he is the venom preacher
