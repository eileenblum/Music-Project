[music: Corpse &amp; Bobby lyrics: Corpse]

Parted from the caravan during the sandstorm
Lost to the desert of the creeping death...
Wandered for days and for days, under the burning sun
Eyes beneath the sand, are watching me

During the night I heard a scream
Something awoke from beneath

Horror within this sand, now roams across this land
Awaken by the stench of human flesh

Nameless terror - Lurking fear
The creature of the desert plains
Chaos Creation - Evil Incarnation
The hunter of the shadows is here
Awaken again - To walk among the living
Risen again - In the valley of the corpses

A chill ran down my spine, as I sensed the nondivine
Oh can it be the one, One without a name

Nameless terror - Lurking fear
The creature of the desert plains
Chaos Creation - Evil Incarnation
The hunter of the shadows is here
Awaken again - To walk among the living
Risen again - In the valley of the corpses

Quicksand grasps me, and I cannot move
And so I fall beneath the sands of time...

As I come to my senses, I can barely breathe
I fell into tunnels beneath
Does my eyes betray me as I look around
Skulls lay everywhere, and I can hear them say:
"Give in for the dark, give in for despair
Join us now, join the dead"
Have I lost my mind, or is this a dream
Oh how I wish this is a dream... dream of death

[solos: Corpse - Bobby]

Minutes turn to hours and hours turn to days
There's no escape from within this maze
Echoes of my prayers, buried by time and dust
And I know for sure, there is no turning back

Cos in my last hour, I heard It scream
Death has arrived, inside this tomb

The horror within the sand, now roams across this maze
Awaken by the hunger, for human flesh

Nameless terror - Lurking fear
The creature of the desert plains
Chaos Creation - Evil Incarnation
The hunter of the shadows is here
Awaken again - To walk among the living
Risen again - In the valley of the corpses

I see distant shadow, moving towards me
The hunter has arrived
In the endless darkness, I can see It's eyes
Eyes of the Dead, beckoning me
I will face my end all alone
I will face my end all alone
In the valley of the corpses
