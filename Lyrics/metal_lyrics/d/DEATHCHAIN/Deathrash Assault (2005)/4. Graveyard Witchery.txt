[music &amp; lyrics by: Corpse]

Rites are cast as the fires ablaze by the midnight at the graves
Unholy cult on the graveyard shift - Tonight they raise the dead

[solo: Corpse]

Necromancers of the left hand path are summoned to this mass
They spill the blood upon the graves that evil dead may rise
"Casket legions under the soil - accept this infernal gift
Brake the chains of eternal death and return from the maze beyond"

And the silence filled the air as the moon was turning red
Dead resurrection from the otherside... it truly was

Graveyard witchery - Raise the dead
Graveyard witchery - Praise the dead
Graveyard witchery

Then they heard an eerie voice that whispered from below
Who are the ones that spoke tonight with the language of the dead
Were they the ones that broke the seal which forced us to sleep
Cos now we may return again and reign forever more

Graveyard witchery - Raise the dead
Graveyard witchery - Praise the dead
Graveyard witchery

Unholy, undead - uprising from the grave
Flesh, decayed - black eyes still remain
Ageless warriors from the past, they swore an oath
To shed the holy blood and kill together as one

Unpure, undead - arise from the grave
Flesh, decayed - hatred still remains
Ageless warriors from the past remember your name
Unholy casket legion kill together as one

That is not dead which can eternally lie
Strange aeons dead can't never die

So the dead rose from the grave to serve their infernal needs
Unholy allegiance between the living and the dead... it truly was
