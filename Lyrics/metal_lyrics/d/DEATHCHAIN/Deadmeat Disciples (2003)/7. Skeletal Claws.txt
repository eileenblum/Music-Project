[Music &amp; Lyrics : Corpse]

WHO KNOWS THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION
THE KIND OF AN ANSWER I'D LIKE TO HEAR
DO WE HAVE EMOTIONS AFTER DEATH
OR DOES IT END AT OUR FINAL BREATH
BECAUSE ONE NIGHT I SAW IT IN MY DREAM
AN OPEN CASKET IN THE TOMB
THERE I WAS AS DEAD AS A ROCK
AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO

THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING...SOMETHING LIKE BONES
THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING...SKELETAL CLAWS

TAKE MY CORPSE, REST IN PAIN
SOUL WILL FLY, BODY WILL DIE

THOSE THINGS I SAW IN MY VISIONS
COULD THEY BE FLASHES OF MY FUTURE
AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE SKELETAL CLAWS
COULD THEY BELONG TO DEATH HIMSELF
AND WHY AM I HAUNTED WITH DREAMS
THE KIND OF DREAMS THAT MAKE ME FEAR
THE KIND OF EMOTIONS I DON'T WANT TO FEEL
THE KIND OF EMOTIONS I DON'T WANT TO SEE

THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING...SOMETHING LIKE BONES
THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING...SKELETAL CLAWS

TAKE MY CORPSE, REST IN PAIN
SOUL WILL FLY, BODY WILL DIE

[SOLO : BOBBY]

TAKE MY CORPSE, REST IN PAIN
SOUL WILL FLY, BODY WILL DIE

SKELETAL CLAWS
