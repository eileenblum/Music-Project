[Music : Kassara, Bobby, Corpse / Lyrics : Corpse]

"BLACK DEATH IS THE PRICE, WHEN THIS CARRIER ARRIVES
HE'S POSSESSING DEADLY SICKNESS, THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY"
AND SO THE SERMON ENDED, OUR WICKER MAN HAD SPOKE
THOSE WORDS HELD A WISDOM, THE PLAGUE WOULD SOON BE HERE

A BLACK RIDER APPEARED FROM THE EAST
AND LOOK, HE HAD NO EYES

DISEASE WAS NOW UPON US, IT FORCED THROUGH OUR VEINS
"I SENTENCE YOU TO BURN, TAKE YOUR PLAGUE TO THE GRAVE"
THE PRIEST CONDEMNED US ALL, INTO THE EVERLASTING FIRE
BUT WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW, HE HAD BECOME A CARRIER...
OF PESTILENCE

"MY GOD ABANDONED ME, MY PRAYERS WERE UNHEARD"
THE PRIEST CRIED...HE WAS A CARRIER OF PESTILENCE

CARRIER OF PESTILENCE

"CHRONIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE
CAUSED BY MYCOBACTERIUM LEPRAE"

HORSEMAN LAUGHED AND SMILED, HIS EVIL DEED WAS DONE
CREATION OF THE UNDERWORLD, THIS CREATURE TRULY WAS
AND EVERYWHERE HE WENT, DEATH GAVE HIM COMPANY
AND BE SCEPTIC MINDED, THE PESTILENCE WILL RISE AGAIN

"MY GOD ABANDONED ME, MY PRAYERS WERE UNHEARD"
THE PRIEST CRIED...HE WAS A CARRIER OF PESTILENCE

CARRIER OF PESTILENCE
