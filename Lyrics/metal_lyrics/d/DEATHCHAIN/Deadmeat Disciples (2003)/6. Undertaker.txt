[Music &amp; Lyrics: Corpse &amp; Bobby]

LIVING BY THE GRAVEYARD, DIGGING HOLES FOR THE DEAD
OLD AND PEACEFUL MAN DIDN'T SEE IT COMING
AT ONE FATAL NIGHT, A GHOST RISED FROM HIS GRAVE
A GHOST FROM THE SILENT PAST, FLEW TO THE OLD MAN'S HOUSE
"DO YOU STILL REMEMBER?"
"YES, NOW I SEE!"
"THE PRIEST TOOK ME TO CHURCH AND MOLESTED ME!"

UNDERTAKER...TAKES YOU DOWN
SIX FEET UNDER...STILL YOU WONDER
UNDERTAKER...TAKES YOU DOWN
FINAL VENGEANCE...KILL ALL HOLY MEN

"I MUST HAVE MY REVENGE! I CANNOT FORGIVE!"
ALTHOUGH FATHER HAS DIED, SACRIFICE
"PRIESTHOOD IS GATHERING IN THAT OLD WOODEN CHURCH
PAIN FROM MY PAST WILL BE BURIED AWAY
I HAVE TO DIG THE GRAVES, 12 GRAVES ALLTOGETHER
THE DEEPEST ONE TO THE HILL FOR ME AND MYSELF!"

UNDERTAKER...TAKES YOU DOWN
SIX FEET UNDER...STILL YOU WONDER
UNDERTAKER...TAKES YOU DOWN
FINAL VENGEANCE...KILL ALL HOLY MEN

[SOLO : BOBBY]

ATTACK TO THE CHURCH, LET THE SHOVEL TASTE THE BLOOD
"BLOOD STAINS THE ALTAR, BUT I MUSN'T KILL THEM YET!"
BURY THEM ALIVE, PANIC IN THEIR EYES
FULLFILMENT IN MY MIND AS THE LAST PRIEST DIES

UNDERTAKER...TAKES YOU DOWN
SIX FEET UNDER...STILL YOU WONDER
UNDERTAKER...TAKES YOU DOWN
FINAL VENGEANCE...KILL ALL HOLY MEN
