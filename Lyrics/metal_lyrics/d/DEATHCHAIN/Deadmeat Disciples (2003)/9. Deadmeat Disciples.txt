[Music &amp; Lyrics : Corpse &amp; Bobby]

SICKNESS TOOK ITS PLACE IN THE CRYPT DOWN BELOW
WORSHIP THE FLESH OF THE DEAD, WORSHIP THE POWER IT HOLDS
POSSESSED CRYPTIC LEGIONS, DISCIPLES OF THE DEATH
THE RITE OF THE BLOOD, OATH OF THE DAMNED

CORPSE! IS UNDER THE KNIFE
MEAT! FROM THE LORD BEYOND
BLESSED ARE THE SICK
LIFE...AFTER DEATH

WE'RE GATHERED HERE TONIGHT IN THE CHAPEL OF THE GHOULS
TO PERFORM THIS UNHOLY RITE, HEATHEN CARNIVORE GORE
POWERS SHALL BE OURS SOUL WILL BE CAPTURED
TORTURED WITH ENDLESS PAIN INTO PAIN DIVINE

CORPSE! IS UNDER THE KNIFE
MEAT! FROM THE LORD BEYOND
BLESSED ARE THE SICK
LIFE...AFTER DEATH

DEADMEAT DISCIPLES, SUPREME OCCULT
DEADMEAT DISCIPLES, NOCTURNAL BREED

HARVEST OF FLESH IN THE WELL OF SOULS
WITCHERY IN THIS GODFORSAKEN TOMB
WHEN BLOOD ABSORBS TO THE SOIL THE DEAD SHALL RISE
SKIN IS RESURRECTING AROUND THE ROTTEN BONES

DEADMEAT DISCIPLES, SUPREME OCCULT
DEADMEAT DISCIPLES, NOCTURNAL BREED
DEADMEAT DISCIPLES, POSSESS THE EARTH
DEADMEAT DISCIPLES, OATH BY BLOOD

LEGIONS CONJURED THEIR EVIL SPELLS
DEVILRY IS CAST UPON THE DISMEMBERED ONES
WHEN BLOOD ABSORBS TO THE SOIL THE DEAD SHALL RISE
SKIN IS RESURRECTING - DEADMEAT DISCIPLES
