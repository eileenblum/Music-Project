[Music : Corpse / Lyrics : Corpse &amp; Bobby]

ATTACK! LEGIONS OF SCAVENGERS, ARE DESCENDING FROM BELOW
SWARM! UNHOLY KILLING FIELDS, BEGINNING OF THE END
FEAST WITH HUMAN FLESH AND RIP THE BLOODY CARCASS
THEN PECK THE SEWN SHUT EYES
DEATH FALLS FROM THE SKY, THERE IS NO SALVATION
THEY'RE HERE TO TAKE OUR LIVES

ENRAGED BY THEIR BLOODTHIRST, NESTING IN THE DARK
SHARP CLAWS FILLED WITH POISON, INFECTED BY RABIES...
INFECTED...BY RABIES...

SLAYERS FROM BEYOND, THE ATTACK BURST OF VULTURES
IT NEVER SEEMS TO END
SERVANTS NAILED TO THE CROSS, TO BEG SOME HELP FROM HEAVEN
BY SELF INDUCED PAIN

RABID VULTURES! RABID VULTURES!
SICK, BLOODTHIRSTY, UNHOLY RABID VULTURES!
CREEPING, GLUTTONING, MENTAL RABID VULTURES!

INTESTINES FILL THE LAND, SKULLS AND BROKEN BONES
SCAVENGING ROTTEN FLESH, SWARMING IN THE SKY

[SOLO : JEE-VEE HELL]

SWARMING...SCAVENGING...

VULTURES! SEASONS OF THE DEAD, THE HARVEST OF THE FLESH
DEATH! THE LAST INHABITANT, WHO SHALL RULE THIS LAND
FEAST WITH HUMAN FLESH AND RIP THE BLOODY CARCASS
THEN PECK THE SEWN SHUT EYES
DEATH FELL FROM THE SKY, THERE WAS NO SALVATION
OUR BLOOD STAINES THE LAND

INTESTINES FILL THE LAND, SKULLS AND BROKEN BONES
SCAVENGING ROTTEN FLESH, SWARMING IN THE SKY

RABID VULTURES! RABID VULTURES!
SICK, BLOODTHIRSTY, UNHOLY RABID VULTURES!
CREEPING, GLUTTONING, MENTAL RABID VULTURES!
