[Music : Corpse, Lyrics : Bobby]

WAR!!! CARNAL DAMAGE!!!

THE THINGS YOU SEE AROUND YOU IN THE BATTLEFIELD
COMRADES FALL AS THEIR SKINS BEGINS TO BOIL

YOU FEEL IT TOO
FIERY ACID BURNING TO THE BONE
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
JUST WAIT THE PAIN TO TAKE YOU AWAY

FIGHTING THE WAR UNJUST
AGAINST THE ENEMY UNSEEN
AND WHAT IT IS ALL FOR?
DESIRE OF POWER AND TO RULE THEM ALL

YOU WERE SO EAGER TO FIGHT FOR A BETTER WORLD
BUT NOW YOU'RE TORTURED BY YOUR MISBELIEF
THE SMELL OF MELTING FLESH IS DRIVING YOU INSANE

WAR!!! CARNAL DAMAGE!!!

FIGHTING THE WAR UNJUST
AGAINST THE ENEMY UNSEEN
AND WHAT IT IS ALL FOR?
DESIRE OF POWER AND TO RULE THEM ALL

YOU FEEL IT TOO
FIERY ACID BURNING TO THE BONE
IN FEAR YOU LIVED, IN FEAR YOU DIE
MELTDOWN BY THE CARNAL DAMAGE

NOW YOU'RE TASTING THE GOODS OF THE MODERN WARFARE
AS PART OF THE BATTALLIONS OF THE GASMASK GENERATION
UNDER THE ACID RAIN YOU HAVE NO PLACE TO HIDE
THE ULTIMATE PAYBACK TIME BY THE CHEMICAL STYLE

IN THE POOL OF YOUR OWN BLOODY VOMIT
AND YOU SEE YOUR OWN BODY ROT AWAY
THE SMELL OF MELTING FLESH IS DRIVING YOU INSANE

WAR!!! CARNAL DAMAGE!!!

FIGHTING THE WAR UNJUST
AGAINST THE ENEMY UNSEEN
AND WHAT IT IS ALL FOR?
DESIRE OF POWER AND TO RULE THEM ALL

YOU FEEL IT TOO
FIERY ACID BURNING TO THE BONE
IN FEAR YOU LIVED, IN FEAR YOU DIE
MELTDOWN BY THE CARNAL DAMAGE
