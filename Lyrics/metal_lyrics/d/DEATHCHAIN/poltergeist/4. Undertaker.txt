[Music &amp; Lyrics: Corpse &amp; Bobby]

Living by the graveyard
Digging holes for the dead
Old and peaceful man
Didn't see it coming
At one fatal night
A ghost rised from his grave
A ghost from the silent past
Flew to the old man's house
"do you still remember?"
"yes, and now I see!"
"the priest took me to church and molested me!"

Undertaker
Takes you down
Six feet under
Still you wonder
Undertaker
Takes you down
Final vengeance
Kill all holy men

"I must have my revenge!"
"I cannot forgive!"
Although father has died
Disciples will suffer
"priesthood is gathering
In that old wooden church
Pain from my past will be buried away
I have to dig the graves, 12 graves altogether
The deepest one to the hill for me and myself!"

Undertaker
Takes you down
Six feet under
Still you wonder
Undertaker
Takes you down
Final vengeance
Kill all holy men

Attack to the church, let the shovel taste the blood
"blood stains the altar, but I mustn't kill them yet!"
Bury them alive, panic in their eyes
Fulfilment in my mind as the last priest dies

Undertaker
Takes you down
Six feet under
Still you wonder
Undertaker
Takes you down
Final vengeance
Kill all holy men
