[Music: Corpse, Lyrics: Corpse]

Afghanistan child conceived in terror
Born to bring destruction and hate
Raised for leadership, abusing the faith
Soon he formed the group of talebans
Fulfill his destiny, in the name of jihad
He stroked against the western world
Torned apart two brothers, assault from the sky
All of this was seen before

Twisted master mind, leader of the rats
Cannot be found from the graves
Looking evil signs, hiding between lines
Waiting wicked Allah in different shapes

I am terror,I am fear
I am terror,I am fear

Leading his troops, spreading the disease
But fearing the open grounds
Like a rat in a cellar, rat in a cave
Soon he comes out from his hole
Rebellion starts, riot of violence
People will betray their own gods
Afghanistan child conceived in terror
Born to bring destruction to faith

Twisted master mind, leader of the rats
Cannot be found from the graves
Looking evil signs, hiding between lines
Waiting wicked Allah in different shapes

I am terror,I am fear
I am terror,I am fear
