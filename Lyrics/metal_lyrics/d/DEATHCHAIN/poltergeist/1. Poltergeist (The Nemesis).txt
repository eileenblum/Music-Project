[Music: Corpse &amp; Bobby, Lyrics: Corpse]

Wondered through the night to the misty house
Escaped to the upstairs
Shadow on the fall took many forms
Appeared from the darkness
Spirit of the past sealed within this house
Disciples left their final curse
Calling for your name at the darkest hour
And nothing shall you see

Poltergeist...poltergeist...
Poltergeist...poltergeist...

Touching at your hair from the endless depths
Should you maybe scream?
Spirit of a murderer, molestor of faith
Is staring from behind
Reaching to your face with his bloody claws
And talking dirty words
Shadow on the wall took many forms
Appeared from the darkness

Poltergeist...poltergeist...
Poltergeist...poltergeist...
