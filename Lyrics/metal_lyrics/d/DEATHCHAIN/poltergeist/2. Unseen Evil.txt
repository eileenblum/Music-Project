[Music: Corpse &amp; Bobby, Lyrics: Corpse]

It's all around us, it's in the air
The blackest spot, in our souls
It will destroy, the weakest minds
The weakest ones, without no mercy

Where did it came?
Raped our nation
Raped our leaders
Raped them to the bone
It will destroy, madness all around
Kill for command, obey the leaders

When the dark clouds arrive, messiah will die
Impaled through rectal and soul
Unbelievers will turn to ghouls
The day of final judgement is waiting in the dark
Laughing and rubbing it's arms

Unseen evil...evil...
Unseen evil...through your soul

When the dark clouds arrive, messiah will die
Impaled through rectal and soul
Unbelievers will turn to ghouls
The day of final judgement is waiting in the dark
Laughing and rubbing it's arms

Unseen evil...evil...
Unseen evil...through your soul
