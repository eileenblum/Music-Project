In a society supposedly evolved
We still can see primitive thinking

People who live using preconceived ideas
About life and death

How can we be sure of what we believe
In such a complex world

It is time to stop ignoring
That no one in this world can hold the ultimate truth

Open your mind
Open your eyes
And find something that is undeniable

Many are the ones who create
Fake beliefs for their advantage
Exploiting all those
Who really need to believe in something

Humanity's Carelessness
