In a world that doesn't appear to be his own
A man is witnessing a surreal vision

Obscure swirl of total emptiness
Causing time distortion and lights fading
Attracting each parts of himself slowly
To a place where even sounds can't subsist

Dive into nothingness
And see what this man has seen

Feeling every fragment of his physical form
Leaking out of what he tought was reality
Paralyzed by an unknown dizzyness
He's now unable to see due to the absence of lights

Floating into nothingness
The man thinks about himself on Earth
Looking towards the sky
Imagining a paradise that is now empty

He wakes up
From his dream
Sweating
In his bed

He wonders what were those vision
That contradict every of his actual beliefs
Forcing him to see everything with a different approach

For each day that passes he realize more clearly
That each part of our world is in fact part of the void
He knows he'll have to face it one day or another
Unsurre about how hard it will be to go through this step
He dives into nothingness
