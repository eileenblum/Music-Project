All around me, shadows and voices
Are tormenting my life
Trying to survive
In a world covered by fire
Closing my eyes
To escape this vision
But it doesn't...
...disappear

Sometimes lights from the past come to my eyes
It is really mine? Can't know for sure...
Everything in my head seems so blurry
SO much incoherence that I can't explain

I'm completely alone
In a world ignored by the others
Shattered by the fear
Of someone that may not be myself

Schizophrenia
Get out of me

No reality, no dreams, I have control over nothing
No reality, no dreams, I'm trapped for a lifetime
