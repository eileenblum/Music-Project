Abondon all hope for mercy and peace, are but a falicy
Spread by fools, to blind
To blind, to see that their world is burning from the inside
The lord of shadows, his presence brings demise
From his throne, crafted from fallen bones
Two hands, signal the signs, of a grim, dark victory

For those denied, they burned alive
Bodies smolder, and shows where weakness hides
Those still alive, cower and hide
Beneath the bodies of those who died
But family ties, bravery in the eyes
The cowards demise
The hydra
Ensures we'll never die
