Home alone
But I'm here
Sleeping in the shadows, so very near
I've got this need
Drown the sorrow and set them free
Drown the sorrow and they run free
Bloody, I force out the hate
First upon her face
Making my way, slowly, to her waist

Long left is the seed to breed
Cower and face destiny
The child of rape
Will forever be
The reminder of hate

She's just a whore
I tell myself and the nightmares fade away
It's through the taste
Through the smell
Horrors of the past, keeps me in hell

Secrets hide
Truth divides
Leaving questions of why
But only known
But only know deep inside

Inside the dark where the monsters hide
To conspire
In acts that traumatize and scar

Ending this lust
Ending this lust
Ending this lust

Your body, a means to an end
Beaten, tied down, and raped
But still alive
Just walk away
