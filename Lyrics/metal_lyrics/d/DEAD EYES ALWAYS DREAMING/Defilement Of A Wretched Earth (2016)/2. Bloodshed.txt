It all starts at night
The endless hate and the pulsing bloodlust
For so long i've been waiting and watching
now heavens gates collapse
and demons call for bloodshed
the price holds high on your head

Legend spins through an endless cycle,
the bidding demands flesh
Dead or alive
rotting walls reek of death and sorrow
i smell your fucking filth
you're just a walking corpse

Cursed to sleep among the maggots
To exhale only flies
Hang your body high, above the gallows
Long plucked from your shitty life

Your death will signal both fear, and panic
Embrace your, monolith of pain

For in
The darkness
You lay broken
And mangled
A candidate to disfigurement

It all starts at night
The endless hate and the pulsing bloodlust
For so long i've been waiting and watching
now heavens gates collapse
and demons call for bloodshed
the price holds high on your head

Legend spins through an endless cycle,
the bidding demands flesh
Dead or alive
rotting walls reek of death and sorrow
you're just
you're just a walking corpse

Cursed to sleep among the maggots
To exhale only flies
Hang your body high, above the gallows
Long plucked from your shitty life
