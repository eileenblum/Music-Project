Disgusting heaps of flesh
Is all my eyes can see

As you realize hell exist
Now exiled, to the blackest abyss

So you begin climbing over your fellow dead
The smell of shit and blood kisses the nostrils
Blinding yet a motivator to escape your pain
But whats left but to kill

The carnage begin, with the eyes
Punctured and plucked yet i can't die
my life, the lie
Why with every blink of the eye does the sound of sickness grow
Descend, your body, the canvas
Ripped flesh, stuffed with feces and mold
Now speak, flies replace your breath

From the horizon, the shadow of a chapel grows
Abominations form the army of the rot
As the priest of sickness, plunges his kingdom straight into decay

Maggots fester in my head
The love letter to the dead
The present so fast to part away
The past and its memories a daze

The deformed husk, that once resembled you
Only sickness remains in the corpse
It posses you
