Through magic and dark manipulation

Rises a beast, an unholy force at his beckoning

The battlefield, an ending
Festering with creatures, and abominations hellbent with insanity

The rise of hell will be the fall of man
The rise of hell will be the fall of man

Lands once peaceful, now lay war bound

Darkness comes at last
The shroud of false gods has passed
Look back, see the liars path
For man can not last
So to hell flames, your future, your past

The purge by fire begins, as the earth...
The purge by fire begins, as the earth, decays and dies
