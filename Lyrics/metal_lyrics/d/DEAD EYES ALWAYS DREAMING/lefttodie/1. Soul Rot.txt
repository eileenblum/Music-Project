Six feet deep
Six feet deep
In the corpses of the dead is where you shall sleep
Ruptured organs and scars from head to feet
Creatures consume
Creatures consume your decaying flesh
The sulfur and blood, has long stained the skies in this place,
You'll always be surprised at the various ways you're going to die
You're gonna die
You're gonna die
Welcome to the rest of your life
Existence is a joke
Hell lives in you and me
Let's kill ourselves and finally see.
