Her presence brings forth shadows
Never-ending nightmares of the deep
A creature to use madness as a trap
Luring prey in you maggot-infested rat
Embrace her love
Comes all the same
A new body to continue her game
Consumed the eviscerated corpse of her groom
Now just a face
True body of waste
Love hate
These are just human traits
Meant to be played and manipulated by
