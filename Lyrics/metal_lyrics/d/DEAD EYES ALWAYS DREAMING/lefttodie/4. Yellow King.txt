Celestial divine
the stars fall from time
the infesting worms breath life
at last corrupting cavities
ascending humanity fast
a broken mind becomes the symbol of control
spires of corpses brings tears at last skin breaks
the worms finally take shape
finally take shape
forming the rotted flesh of the dead eyes
red eyes, red cry
the blood from your head
maggots need a new home instead
erased
erased
this is the extinction state

many accept the fate disguised as a new faith
many accept the fate disguised as a new faith
many accept the fate disguised as a new faith
many accept the fate disguised as a new faith

endless nightmares in the cosmos of forever
bring forth my followers of this new faith
demons created
are human illustrated
cry the blood from your head
maggots bring forth my
followers of this new faith
