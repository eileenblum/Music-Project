The spider draws ever closer
Lips licking as you choke
The look of death is in your eyes
Skin dissipates replaced with flies
Broken bones liquefied
All while your still alive
The webs weaved have crafted out your life
Today and yesterday have become one
In the same experience
A terror you can never name
You can never name
The reaper's here
Bare witness to his dead eyes
No more second chances
Prepare to die
Kick and scream all you wish
We're almost there

Can you smell hell in the air
Can you smell hell in the air
Can you smell hell in the air
Can you smell hell in the air
