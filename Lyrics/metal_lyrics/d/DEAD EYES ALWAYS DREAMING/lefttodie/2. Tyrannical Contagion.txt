Your love is decay
Your hate
The fever animals were the first believers
Death looming and carrions pick remains
In twenty-eight days,
Only death remains
Let the disease flow from every land
Slaughter them all like bloody lambs
To be human is to live like a curse
Every fucking day it gets fucking worse
I hold bigotry and bane in my head
Only relieved when you're motherfucking dead
I see you as useless and forever worthless
A holocaust brewing
The fire has been burning
A mass grave is your mourning
Shoulder to shoulder eviscerate,
And erase the disgrace
And erase the disgrace
Cometh by sickness straight to the grave
Contain the weakness
Evolve the plague
