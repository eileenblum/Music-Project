putrid words spitting from a snakes mouth
venomous to all that hear its sound
hatred harvested
blossomed the seeds of doubt
convince me I'm not insane
when I close my eyes
I'm never the same
creatures of the abyss
cities of shadow and terror
reaching out calling
creatures of blood red
shrouds possessing the ground
coddling the birth
re-birthing the curse
idling this waking town creatures form at Innsmouth
creatures of preacher's flesh rise again
a faceless god awakes and enslaves
convince me I'm not insane
close my eyes and nothings the same
