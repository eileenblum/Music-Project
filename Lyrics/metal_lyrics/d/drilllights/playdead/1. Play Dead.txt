I'm standing everyday
And I can do it forever
I've walked this road for hours
We go slow and down

I've walked a million miles for this
The road is taking over me
Let's go! We must see the show
This is for you!

Ooh! You're crazy?
This is my vengeance for you
But if you want you can cry
But no one will
This is your hell

But not all my words are poison
Don't want to play dead
I can still feel your flesh alive

Now I want to tell you something
You let to be free

It's sad if you think that I will not go home
(I never look behind, we are living tortured because of you)
It's sad if you think that I will not call you
(I'm having a fucking day, I don't wanna think about it)
Just let me live for you

Now I want to tell you something

I will play a few meaningless words
I just want to get your attention
I know that there is something hidden in your eyes
Take it out!

I don't want you to cry
I just want to know the truth
I can't take it anymore
Why did I break this!
Let me free

Oh!

I never cared about you
I'm sure this is hell
But now I don't think it matters
This is not the end

I don't want you to cry
I can not take it anymore
Why did I break this?

I know I should stay away
Take it out, I want the truth
This is not the end.
