I'm walking away
You're hurt and I am to blame
Who's right or wrong
What does it matter now anyway?
Sorry I fucked up
For this hurtful breakup
But I cannot change who I am

Oh oh the skies are red
Better run, better run
Gonna end up dead
Dead and gone
Dead and gone
Dead and gone
Oh oh the skies are red
Gotta make, gotta make this right
If it's not too late, Too little too late

I wanna say that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
For the mistakes I've made
And I hope it not too little, not too late
'Cause I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

Who's right or wrong
What does it matter now anyway?
Sorry I fucked up
For this hurtful breakup
But I cannot change

Oh oh the skies are red
Gotta make this right
Gonna end up dead
Dead and gone
Dead and gone
Dead and gone

I wanna say that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
For the mistakes I've made
And I hope it not too little, not too late
'Cause I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe

I wanna say that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I wanna tell you I'm sorry
For the mistakes I've made
And I hope it not too little, not too late
'Cause I can't breathe, I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
