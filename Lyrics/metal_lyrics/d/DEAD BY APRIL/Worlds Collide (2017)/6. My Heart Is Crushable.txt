I am breakable
I am breakable

I've got the scars to prove it all
Do you know what it's like to be buried alive?
I throw myself against a wall
'Cause what I've learnt about myself, I'm addicted to pain

Don't break my heart

Whoa, whoa
I am breakable
Whoa, whoa
My heart is crushable
Whoa, whoa
I am breakable
Breakable!
Breakable
Breakable!
Breakable
I am breakable

My scars are still bleeding
It's crawling in my skin
It's the monster I'm feeding
And my blood pressure is rising
I am...
I'm breakable
I'm fragile
Fragile!

Whoa, whoa
I am breakable
Whoa, whoa
My heart is crushable
Whoa, whoa
I am breakable
Breakable!
Breakable
Breakable!
Breakable
I am breakable

I am breakable
Breakable
I am breakable

Whoa, yeah

Whoa, whoa
I am breakable, breakable
Whoa, whoa
My heart is crushable
Whoa, whoa
I am breakable, I am breakable
Breakable
Breakable!
Breakable

I am breakable
