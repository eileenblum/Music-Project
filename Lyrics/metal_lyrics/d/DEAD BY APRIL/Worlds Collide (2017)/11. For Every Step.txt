[feat. Tommy KÃ¶rberg]Looking back at yesterday
Now there's nothing else missing, no
The puzzle is closed incomplete
And I've never felt so old

And I will never leave your side

For every step
I will be there
For you
For us

And every second for the rest of my life
You will find me here [2x]

My heart is in your hands
A bomb so unbreakable
I have never felt like this before
I never knew it was possible
Never knew I was capable
You're gonna never break a bond like this

And I will never leave your side

For every step
I will be there
For you
For us

And every second for the rest of my life
You will find me here 

You will find me here

I'm following you
I'm following you
I'm following you 'til the end
I'm standing by you
I'm standing by you
I'm standing by you 'til the end

I'm following you
I'm following you
I'm following you

For every step
I will be there
For you
For us

And every second for the rest of my life
You will find me here 

You will find me here
