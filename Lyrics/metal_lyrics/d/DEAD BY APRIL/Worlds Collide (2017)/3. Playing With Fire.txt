Here I am once again, 
Another lesson learned, 
The bridges that I burned, 
Last night I filled up with smoke, 
Starting to suffocate, 
Fighting to stay awake. 

I'm at the end of the rope,
Look myself in the mirror, 
It's over, 
I regret what I've done, 
I know it's my fault, 
Been playing with fire, 
I can feel it burning my skin.

Such a powerful force, 
I've been playing with fire, 
I can feel it burning in my skin.

Been playing with fire, 
I regret what I've done (what I've done),
Been playing with fire, 
And I know it's my fault (my fault).
