For your tomorrow I gave my today
For your tomorrow I gave my today

It's not a matter of losing
It's not a matter of winning
It's just a matter of being
Being yourself
The lid is broken and the bottle is empty
I'm done with tipping on my toes
I am done with always trying to be someone else
Be someone else

This is my life (This is my life)
Taking my first step (Taking my first step)
Where there is no struggle there is no strength
This is (This is)
My life (My life)

For your tomorrow I gave my today
For your tomorrow I gave my today

It's not about the past
It's not about the future
It's all about the now
And being yourself
For your tomorrow I gave my today
Felt like an electric wire down my throat
I sacrificed everything that I am
All that I am

This is my life (This is my life)
Taking my first step (Taking my first step)
Where there is no struggle there is no strength
This is (This is)
My life (My life)

Life

This is my life
This is my life

Sing with me
D! B! A!
DBA
D! B! A!
DBA

This is my life (This is my life)
Taking my first step (Taking my first step)
Where there is no struggle there is no strength
This is (This is)
My life (My life)

Life

For your tomorrow I gave my today
For your tomorrow I gave my today
