You have what they don't
Your heart is true
So dry your tears
And let it shine through
'Cause you're amazing
Look at you smiling
Don't change anything
There's no denying
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Don't ever listen to what they say about you
You're perfect just the way you are
You will never be anything like them
And the strength is in your heart
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're perfect just the way you are
Don't put yourself down
Don't let them win
They don't understand
Who you are
Break down your walls
Let them know who you are
