Itâs a new day
Something feels strange

Iâm walking in the clouds
I'm almost touching the stars
Anything is possible, imaginable

Am I dreaming?
All normal things start to change
Can feel no gravity
I step outside the atmosphere
Nothing seems impossible, unreachable

How strange it feels
Moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreaming
Now, is this real
Or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreamingâ¦
I guess I must be dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreamingâ¦

I take a leap
I should be scared, but I'm not
Travelling in the speed of light
Planets are flashing by
Like a shooting star I fly

How strange it feels
Moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreaming
Now, is this real
Or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreamingâ¦
I guess I must be dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreamingâ¦

This is just a dream [x2]

How strange it feels
Moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreaming
No, is this real
Or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreamingâ¦
I guess I must be dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, dreamingâ¦
