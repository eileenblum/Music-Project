Donât try to help
Iâm alone in this
All efforts will be futile
Progressing bit by bit as Iâm fighting to kill it!

Replace all my frustration with new inspiration
Watch me climb
Fighting this addiction I am bleeding!

Evil is on my left, good is on my right
(It's like I'm two-faced, it's like I'm two-faced)
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
(It's like I'm two-faced, it's like I'm two-faced)

For once listen to me
Now I am crying it out
Tired of hiding it inside
Now I am screaming it out

Replace all my frustration with new inspiration
Watch me climb
Fighting this addiction I am bleeding!

Evil is on my left, good is on my right
(It's like I'm two-faced, it's like I'm two-faced)
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
(It's like I'm two-faced, it's like I'm two-faced)

I am trying to figure me out why I'm bleeding,
No one will ever understand me,
It's like I'm two-faced
Understand me
It's like I'm two-faced
Understand me
Understand me

Evil is on my left, good is on my right
(It's like I'm two-faced, it's like I'm two-faced)
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
(It's like I'm two-faced, it's like I'm two-faced)

Evil is on my left, good is on my right
It's like I'm two-faced
It's like I'm two-faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It's like I'm two-faced, it's like I'm two-faced
