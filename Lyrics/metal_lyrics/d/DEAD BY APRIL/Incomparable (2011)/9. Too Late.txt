Iâve been running all night long
And the pulse is pounding in my chest
Now I am here
There are feelings that I just must express

Open for me
I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say
Donât say itâs too late
Open for me
Cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say
Donât say itâs too late

Gotta get this out my system
Iâve gathered my strength
Ripped my blindfold off Iâm ready now
I have stayed in the dark with my mind switched off

Open for me
I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say
Donât say itâs too late
Open for me (Open for me)
Cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say
Donât say itâs too late

I donât wanna be
Out here on my own
I donât wanna be
Outside in the cold
I donât wanna be
Completely alone
I just wanna be
Right where I belong

Uuuuuhhhhhhhhhh

Open for me
Whatever you say
Donât say it's too late

Open for me
I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say
Donât say itâs too late
Open for me!
Cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say!
Donât say itâs too late
