[iTunes Bonus Track]What if I told you there is no tomorrow?
What if you watch me walk away by tomorrow?

So how many times
Do I have to fail
Before I understand who I am?
Throw me away from myself
I need to get around
The reaper is standing next to me

Time is now
Surrounded by shadow
Replaced by the color of darkness
Time is now my final ? ?
Close to insanity

What if I told you there is no tomorrow?
If I told you I just canât hold on
What if you watch me walk away by tomorrow?
If I told you tomorrow will be gone

I am everything I need
What are these things that
Coming to me
Because by you I was
I finally see myself in the mirror
I really understand why Iâm hated

Time is now
Surrounded by shadow
Replaced by the color of darkness
Time is now my final ? ?
Close to insanity!

What if I told you there is no tomorrow?
If I told you I just canât hold on
What if you watch me walk away by tomorrow?
If I told you tomorrow will be gone, will be gone

All that I wish for is fading away
Will be gone, will be gone
All that I wish for is fading away

What if I told you?

What if I told you there is no tomorrow?
If I told you I just canât hold on
What if you watch me walk away by tomorrow?
If I told you tomorrow will be gone

What if I told you there is no tomorrow?
If I told you I just canât hold on
What if you watch me walk away by tomorrow?
If I told you tomorrow will be gone
