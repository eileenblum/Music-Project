As Iâm waking up blind
I am trapped in a mind fall
So much regret, so much feeling
Are passing through my mind
It feels like my whole existence is about to end

Lost in time
Feels like Iâm fading
All thatâs left is my fate
Iâm lost within, Iâm trapped inside of me
My past is staring at me

I am lost
So far away
I am lost
So far away (so far away!)

I feel so harmed
So much left to (say)
Abuse my life
My fate

It feels like Iâm buried down
Into a black hole
The dust is choking me
What if thereâs no tomorrow?
Will I be dead?
All these questions
[?feels like?] to my end

Lost in time
Feels like Iâm fading
All thatâs left is my fate
Iâm lost within Iâm trapped inside of me
My past is staring at me

I am lost
So far away
I am lost
So far away (so far away!)

I feel so harmed
So much left to (say)
Abuse my life
My fate

Lost in time
Feels like Iâm fading
All thatâs left is my fate
Iâm lost within, Iâm trapped inside of me
My past is staring at me

I am lost (I am lost)
So far away
I am lost (I am lost)
So far away (so far away!)

[?My mind cries lost?]

I am lost (I am lost)
So far away
I am lost (I am lost)
So far away (so far away!)

I feel so harmed
So much left to
Abuse my life
My fate!
