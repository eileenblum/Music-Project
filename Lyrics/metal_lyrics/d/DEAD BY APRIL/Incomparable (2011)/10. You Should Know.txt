You should know
You should know

Tell me to...
A golden past...
'Cause you're slow again
For me a winter fast
Memories will lead

Full of love and apologies
Trying to go on with a broken heart
I thought it through like a thousand times
What went wrong
What went wrong

I am trying so hard...
You should know
I am falling to pieces without you near
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you near
Want you to know!
Try to breathe, try to sleep, try to feel
But without you near
Cannot breathe, cannot sleep, cannot feel
Love without you near...

Tell me to...
True a goal of you
Hurting me
Say that it's not too late
That it's just a dream

For about my mind I'm soaring
Trying to go on with a broken heart
Can we closure inside of this story
What went wrong?
What went wrong?

I am trying so hard...
You should know
I am falling to pieces without you near
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you near
Want you to know!
Try to breathe, try to sleep, try to feel
But without you near
Cannot breathe, cannot sleep, cannot feel
Love without you near...

All the memories still remain
I've taken them again and again
My abilities of restraint
Taking without you in the pain

Want you to know...
Want you knooo-ooo-uoou

I am trying so hard...
You should know
I am falling to pieces without you near
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you near
Want you to know!
Try to breathe, try to sleep, try to feel
But without you near
Cannot breathe, cannot sleep, cannot feel
Love without you near...
