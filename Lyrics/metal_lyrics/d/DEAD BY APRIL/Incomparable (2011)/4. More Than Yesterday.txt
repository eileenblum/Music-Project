Yeah, yeah

With you the grass is always greener
And the tears are left behind
There no one can take my freedom
And my heart isn't next in line
With you the sun is always rising
When I'm with you it's never dark
With you the clouds are free from rain and!
With you my life doesn't fall apart

Yeah

I miss you more than ever
More than I can put to words
Every day itâs getting harder
To leave it all behind.
I am missing you, more than yesterday, I am missing you.

Yeah

We'll live a life filled with melodies
Now the silence is my dear friend
A rich life free from drama scenes
I try to smile but I canât pretend, no

I miss you more than ever
More than I can put to words

Every day is getting harder
To leave it all behind.
I am missing you, more than yesterday,
I am missing you, more than yesterday, yesterday, yesterday.
More than yesterday, yesterday, yesterday.

The surface cracks getting larger than yesterday
As I am moving further from yesterday
Can see the end now itâs closer than yesterday
As I am moving further from yesterday

Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
More than yesterday

I miss you more than ever
More than I can put to words
Every day is getting harder
To leave it all behind.
I am missing you, more than yesterday,
I am missing you, more than yesterday (yesterday)
Yesterday (yesterday)
Yesterday.
More than yesterday (yesterday)
Yesterday (yesterday), yesterday
