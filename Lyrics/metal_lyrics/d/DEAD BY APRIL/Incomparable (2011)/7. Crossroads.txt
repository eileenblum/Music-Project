There were things that I knew to say,
To hear me,
Please don't take this a wrong way,
Hey, I don't wanna make things harder, no,
I don't wanna complicate,
This is keeping me away

(yeah)
Standing at the crossroads now,
And we can't back down,
'cause there's nothing left worth taking there,
(yeah)
We need to close the door
We've been in it before,
No, there's nothing left worth taking there

I hear you,
Maybe we're not in the stretch of all,
I know that,
We can be more if we let it go,
I know that,
We can be so much better, girl,
If we make the right choice now,
We don't need to look back

(yeah)
Standing at the crossroads now,
And we can't back down,
'cause there's nothing left worth taking there,
(yeah)
We need to close the door,
We've been in it before,
No, there's nothing left worth taking there

'cause you're breaking me, shaking me,
You're taking me over,
We were love strong, we shine,
We need to get sober,
We fall, we fall over

Standing at the crossroads now,
And we can't back down,
'cause there's nothing left worth taking there,
Standing at the crossroads now,
And we can't back down,
'cause there's nothing left worth taking there,
We need to close the door,
We've been in it before,
No, there's nothing left worth taking there
