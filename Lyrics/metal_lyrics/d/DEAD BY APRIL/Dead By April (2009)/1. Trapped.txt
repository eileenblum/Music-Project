Try not to wake me

Cause' of you, I'm lying awake at nightbut I'm seeing our pictures of you,
as I close my eyes I fade my way into the last of my dream world

It's a place of trust,
would you meet me there?
There's no time to spare,
come and show me you care,
That you're believing that here we can win!

All of my dreams, are all I see,
try not to wake me, can't you see
All of my dreams, are all I wanna see,
try not to wake me, try not to wake me!

Try not to wake me

Cause' of you, my tries to not think of you,
they just end up in one million thoughts,
It's way too much to mention,
see what I mean when you see my creation

It's a place of trust,
I can meet you there,
there's no time to spare,
come and show me you care,
that you're believing that here we can win!

All of my dreams are all I see,
try not to wake me, can't you see
All of my dreams are all I wanna see,
try not to wake me, try not to wake me!

All of my dreams are all I see,
try not to wake me, can't you see?
All of my dreams are all I wanna see,
try not to wake me, try not to wake me,
trapped inside my own dreams,
I'm not complaining,
leave behind all I offer your kind,
here we could disappear

All of my dreams are all I see,
try not to wake me, let me be
All of my dreams are all I see,
try not to wake me, can't you see
All of my dreams are all I wanna see,
try not to wake me, try not to wake me
All of my dreams are all I see,
try not to wake me, can't you see
All of my dreams are all I wanna see,
try not to wake me, try not to wake me

Try not to wake me
