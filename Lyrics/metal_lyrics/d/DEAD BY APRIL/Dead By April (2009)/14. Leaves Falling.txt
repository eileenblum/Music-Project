[Limited Edition &amp; UK bonus track]

Put my trust in your love
I defended you
despite our past
I still breathe for you (for you..)
my side is chosen for destiny
and this is all I see

Leaves falling down
falling side by side
all I predicted has now begun
Leaves falling down
anywhere I hide
all that was laid down
it seems I drown

You made my beliefs grow little stronger
I'm at the end
can't feel it no longer (longer..)
When I dream
I am still awake
and this is all I see

Leaves falling down
falling side by side
all I predicted has now begun
leaves falling down
anywhere I hide
all that was laid down
it seems I drown

Leaves fall down
one by one
Leaves falling down
in tears I drown
Leaves fall down
one by one
Leaves falling down
in tears I drown

Leaves falling down
falling side by side
all I predicted has now begun
leaves falling to pieces
all that was laid down
it seems I drown

Leaves falling down
falling side by side (Falling down..)
all I predicted has now begun
leaves falling down
anywhere I hide (anywhere I hide..)
all that was laid down
it seems I drown
