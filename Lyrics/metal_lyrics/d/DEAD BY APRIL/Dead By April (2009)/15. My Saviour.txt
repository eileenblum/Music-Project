[UK bonus track]

So there you were,
Alone with those ablazing eyes,
Like an angel brought to life,
You have my destiny.

Iâm free! You are my Saviour!
Iâm free! You are my guiding soul!
All I need is you!
Is You!!

I tried to fight (I tried to fight),
For so many years I've tried,
You bought me back to life,
Changed my world, guided me

Iâm free! You are my Saviour!
Iâm free! You are my guiding soul!
All I need is you!
I am free!..
Iâm free! You are (You are...) my Saviour! (My Saviour!)
Iâm free! You are (You are!) my guiding soul!
All I need (All I need!) is you!
Is you!!
