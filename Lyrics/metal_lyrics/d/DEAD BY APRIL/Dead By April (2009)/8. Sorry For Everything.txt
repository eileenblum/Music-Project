Sometimes you've said I didn't listen to your words
That I even made you cry
Maybe I didn't show in every possible way
how much I cared

I'm sorry for
not being myself
For everything
ending this way

Maybe I maybe you
could made this change
I'm sorry for
for everything
I wish that I
could stop your tears
from falling down

But unlike me I make it worse

Maybe I wasn't always there
But it doesn't mean I don't care

Whatever it was

I'm sorry for not being myself
For everything
ending this way

Maybe I maybe you could made this change I'm sorry for
For everything

We're minutes away
from saying goodbye for all of time
I'm second away
from breaking apart

I'm sorry for
for everything
...I'm sorry for not being myself...

For everything
ending this way
maybe I maybe you could made this change

I'm sorry for
...I'm sorry for everything...
for everything
...for everything...
