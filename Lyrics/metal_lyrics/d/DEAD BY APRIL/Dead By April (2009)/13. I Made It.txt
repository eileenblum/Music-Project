Gone are the flames gone are the tears and pain that Burned me that hurt me
Some days I could burn me and just still I knew I stood never too far from you

Look at me now, I made it
See my hope now, I made it
Reaching things now I never thought possible
Here I am now, I made it.
Here is my life, my true dream

I am not afraid even through the darkest moments i never gave up
In my mind what am reaching for a coming closer i do never gave it up
(I never gave it up)

Look at me now, I made it
See my hope now, I made it
Reaching things now I never thought possible
Here I am now, I made it
Here is my life, my true dream

I felt you in me.
(I felt you in me)
I saw you in me.
(I saw you in me)
I never gave up.
(I never gave it up)

Look at me now I made it
look at me now I made it
Here my now I made
It look at me now I made it
See I have now made it
Here I am now, I made it
Here is my life, my true dream
