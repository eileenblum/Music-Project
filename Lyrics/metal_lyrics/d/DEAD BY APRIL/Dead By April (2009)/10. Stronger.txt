(For so many years I tried to complete what I once started
But, something was always there.
Holding me back from it
Kept me from making it happen,
It's so unreal
The clock is ticking, the time is passing me by, passing me by)

Everywhere, all that is near
(Now it's time to show them all
What I have, Who I am, What I seek)

Answer me it's all that I'm asking
Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger
My despair plagues me no longer.

(My despair)

(So it seems
That I've found my escape out from your prison
I am once again myself. Stronger than ever
Feeling so free
Feeling secure
Nothing can get me now.
Nothing at all
Feeling alive
It took me long than I ever expected)

Everywhere, all that is near,
(Now it's time to show them all
What I have, Who I am, What I seek)

Answer me it's all that I'm asking
Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger
My despair plagues me no longer.

Everywhere, all that is near
Everywhere, all that is near

Answer me for all that I'm asking
Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger
My despair plagues me no longer.

(My despair)
(Oh, my despair)
