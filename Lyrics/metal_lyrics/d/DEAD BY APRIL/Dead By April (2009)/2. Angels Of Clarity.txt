(Well I wont burn into an under
the demons surrounding me
sometimes the pain of torture
is powered deep within me
it makes me shiver down my spine
to even think about
talk to me, what is the reason
the reason, answer me,
come please, before I detonate my hand grenade!)

Save me from myself!

save me
falling down
Angels of clarity
(I am done by society!)
save me
frozen inside
Angels of clarity
(I am done by society!)

(I know, and inside it feels like I am lost
the panic, the fear
even my dreams is haunting me
is this my destiny
talk to me, what is the reason
the reason, answer me
come please, before I detonate my hand grenade!)

Save me from myself!

Save me
falling down
Angels of clarity,
(I am done by society!)
Save me
frozen inside
Angels of clarity
(I am done by society!)

Leaving our tears behind
(Angels of clarity, show me the way)
Leaving my past behind
(Angels of clarity, show me the way)
show me the way

Save me from myself!

Save me
falling down
Angels of clarity,
(I am done by society!)
Save me
frozen inside
angels of clarity
(I am done by society!)

Save me
falling down
Angels of clarity,
(I am done by society!)
Save me
frozen inside
angels of clarity
(I am done by society!)
