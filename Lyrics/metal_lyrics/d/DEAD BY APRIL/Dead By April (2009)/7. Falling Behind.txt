I'm fading to grey,
losing all track of time.
(I'll die, in your own storm)
I'm shattered in pieces,
(lift up my eye)
I am falling this time.

I open my heart for you!

Now I'm being something I'm not,
Memories gone, I'm falling behind.
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears,
My heart is gone I'm falling behind!

I'm fading away,
I lose in the end ...I lose in the end...
a reason to be,
find me a miracle,
(Free my life from destruction)
What am I worth now,
(my happing ending long gone)

I open my heart for you!

Now I'm being something I'm not,
Memories gone, I'm falling behind.
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears,
My heart is gone I'm falling behind!

(I never felt so alone)
theres no turning back,
(Forgiveness is long gone)
I'm falling behind,
(I never felt so closed)
the legions are near me,
(I'm falling behind; I'm losing my words now)
(I'm falling behind; my life becomes lifeless)
(I'm falling behind!)

Standing lonely in tears, my heart is gone I'm falling behind.

Now I'm being something I'm not,
Memories gone, I'm falling behind,
Now I'm standing lonely in tears,
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind.

Now I'm being something I'm not,
(something I'm not!)
Memories gone, I'm falling behind,
(falling behind!)
Now I'm standing lonely in tears
(lonely in tears!)
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind!
