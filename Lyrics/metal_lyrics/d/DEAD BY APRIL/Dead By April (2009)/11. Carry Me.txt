I am still alone, turning to stone,
Where did you go, what did you find?
Where did all this come to an end?

Carry me, embrace me,
What I win or lose,
This is not true
Carry me

Do you see me, do you see me?
As I see you, so many tears in me have fallen
so many steps, I have been crawling

Carry me, embrace me,
What I win or lose,
This is not true
I am falling, falling
I am crawling, crawling
I am falling, falling
(I am falling)
I am crawling, crawling

(I've had enough of this, I am falling and I can't hear the truth,
I'm in distrust, you are in my dreams and I just can't hear the truth)

Carry me, embrace me,
What I win or lose,
This is not true
I am falling, falling
(I am falling, and I can't hear the truth)
I am crawling, crawling
(I'm in distrust, you are in my dreams and I just can't hear the truth)
I am falling, falling
I am falling
