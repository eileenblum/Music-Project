What if I told you there is no tomorrow
What if you watch me walk away by tomorrow?

(so how many things do I have to fail..)
(before I understand who I am?..)
(to get away from myself..)
(I need to get a rest..)
(the reaper is standing next to me..)

the time is now
(surrounded by shadows..)
(painted by colors of darkness..)
the time is now
the final hour
(close to insanity..)

What if I told you there is no tomorrow
if I told you I just cant hold on
what if you watch me walk away by tomorrow?
if I told you tomorrow will be gone!

(Shadows surround me everywhere..)

(I am everything I need..)
(what is this distance..)
(coming to reek upon who I was..)
(to finally see myself in the mirror..)
(I really understood what I am made of..)

the time is now
(surrounded by shadows..)
(painted by colors of darkness..)
the time is now
the final last word
(close to insanity..)

what if I told you there is no tomorrow
if I told you I just cant hold on
what if you watch me walk away by tomorrow?
if I told you
you are still
calling me, calling me..
painting my life in red..
calling me, calling me..
all that I wish for is fading away

What if I told you
told you
told you..

what if I told you there is no tomorrow (tomorrow.. tomorrow..)
if I told you I just cant hold on
what if you watch me walk away by tomorrow (tomorrow.. tomorrow..)
if I told you tomorrow will be gone!

What if I told you there is no tomorrow (tomorrow.. tomorrow..)
if I told you I just cant hold on,
What if you watch me walk away by tomorrow (tomorrow.. tomorrow..)
if I told you tomorrow will be gone!
