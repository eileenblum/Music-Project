Listen now, I found myself in you, I cannot lie.
I carried all this load, all my life.
I found inside of you, where I belong
I carried you for so long.

Now you can't give up, not when you've come this far
Though you face it all alone, seek your trust inside within.
Now you can't give up, look before you wake
When you're standing all alone,
Find yourself inside within.

(So you make it of your own solution
I know, IÂ´m better off alone without you)

Listen now, I found myself in you, I cannot lie,
I close my eyes to awake, loved you either way
The way to make forever seem like one day
Will I remember you for so long?

Now you can't give up, not when you've come this far
Though you face it all alone, seek your trust inside within
Now you can't give up, look before you wake,
When you're standing all alone, find yourself inside within

(No one listen to myself what can I do?
I believe that you are alright, can I listen to yourself
What do you do? You are my love forever
So, you make it on your own solution
I know IÂ´m better off alone without you)

I guess there's always something,
You try to heal, leave behind.
You'll find a way, you'll turn around
Although easy ways can't be found
Not when we've come this far

Now you can't give up, not when you've come this far
Though you face it all alone, seek your trust inside within
Now you can't give up, look before you wake
When your standing all alone, find yourself inside within

(So you make it of your own solution
I know I'm better off alone without you)
