(I saw this wrecking down on me) we used to be unbreakable
(but you were called my own, you see) love is undeniable
Free from all the lies, still I miss your crystal eyes
(you are so unhateable).

Till the end,
forget our past.

What have you done to me, don't leave me here.
look what you've done to me, don't leave me here.

(you set my heart and soul on fire) what seemed so impossible,
(you've always been my one desire) you're making me invisible.
Free from all these lies, still I miss your angel eyes.
(you are so unhateable).

Till the end,
forget our past.

What have you done to me, come, don't leave me here.
Look what you've done to me, don't leave me here.

(moving down, in your mind, now try to dig it out,
so long, realize what you forgot about)

Till the end

(deep inside, you know that we are meant to be as one,
you light the life in me)

Till the end,
forget our past.

What have you done to me, don't leave me here.
Look what you've done to me, don't leave me here

What have you done to me, we were unbreakable, undeniable.
Look what you've done to me, we were unbreakable, undeniable.
