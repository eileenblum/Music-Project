Here is no one left to trust,
erase a lie, one that I can see.
(There is left this enormous burn, for there's left to remain.
I am walking through, watching what's left)

Hold me close,
This is what I see, emptiness in me.
This is how I feel, This is what is real
I can't move back (What is left in your life?)
I can't replace (what is pain in your eyes)

I crawl my way through every day,
erase your lie (always there for me)
(Give me the thought to pass this behavior, I am walking through fire.
Standing alone, I'll burn out these thoughts)

Walk me through, this is what I see, emptiness in me.
This is how I feel, this is what is real.
I can't move back, (What is left in your life?)
I can't replace (What is pain in, pain in this life,
Pain in this life)

This is all that is left for me

Hold me close, this is what I see, emptiness in me.
This is how I feel, This is what is real
I can't move back (What is left in your life?)
I can't replace (what is pain in your eyes)

This is what I see, emptiness in me
This is how I feel, This is what is real
I can't move back (What is left in your life?)
I can't replace (what is pain in your eyes)
