Don't look down, don't look back, I am beside you.
Close your eyes, know I'm, here.
I know it's hard to let go all that defines you.
You feel like you'll never be whole again

We will find a way to erase the past
Stay with me, stay here with me!

In my arms you'll be fine I never let go.
All you've lost will come again just stay here with me.
Never look back, never again, it's over.
Everything ends here in my arms.

Don't give in, don't let your, memories break you,
Let me take you away from here.

We will find a way to make this last
Stay with me, stay here with me!

In my arms you'll be fine I never let go.
All you've lost will come again just stay here with me.
Never look back, never again, it's over.
Everything ends here in my arms.

I'll be here forever (Everything ends!)
Here in my arms
I'll be here forever (Everything ends in my arms!)
I'll be here forever (Forever, forever)

In my arms you'll be fine I never let go.
All you've lost will come again just stay here with me.
Never look back, never again, it's over.
Everything ends here in my arms.
