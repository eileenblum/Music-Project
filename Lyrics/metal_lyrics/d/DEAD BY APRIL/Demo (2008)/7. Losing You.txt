What I have in me,
In my mind is you.
(I would die if we were through)
What I'm feeling now,
What I'm heading into.
(I am lost in pain without you)
(so cold, so alone)

All I have is you,
It is all that I'm breathing for.
All I need is you,
(Now I can't make it through)

All the nights I've prayed,
Must this all be untrue.
(I am not prepared to be strong)
I just can't believe I am losing you
(Unprepared to carry on)
(I can see you walk away)
(so cold, so alone)

All I have is you,
It is all that I'm breathing for.
All I need is you,
(Now I can't make it through)

I am losing you forever
(I am lost in pain without you)
I am leaving ground forever
(Forever, forever)

Distant, so far, destiny is selecting me.
I can't be strong, life is disconnecting me.
Now loneliness infecting me.
Gone are the days, you were there protecting me.

So cold (so alone)

All I have is you
It is all that I'm breathing for.
All I need is you
(Now I can't make it through)

I am losing you forever
(I am lost in pain without you)
I am leaving ground forever (forever)

All I have is you (it is so that I'm breathing for)
All I need is you (now I can't make it through)

It is all that I'm breathing for
(breathing for, breathing for)
(breathing for, breathing for, breathing for)
