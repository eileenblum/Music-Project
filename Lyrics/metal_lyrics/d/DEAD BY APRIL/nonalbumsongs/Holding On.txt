I try again
For one more day
Seems to be no other way
I hold on to the past we had
Wishing you be here one day

All this days
All this time
I have been waiting
To see your face

Holding on
All this long nights
I have been awake
Through all alone
All this days, all this time

Nothing breaks the silence here
Nothing makes the pain so clear
I hold on to what I have lived
Wishing you be here one day

All this days
All this time
I have been waiting
To see your face

Holding on all this long nights
I have been awake through all alone
Someone tell me am dreaming
I just wanna live
Someone tell me am dreaming
I can't go on

(All this pain)
I try again seems to be no other way
(All this time)
So far away without you
Wishing you be here one day

All this days, all this time (all this time)
I have been waiting
To see your face
Holding on all these long nights (all this time)
I have been waiting through all alone
All this days, all this time
