I will never forget
Not what you did
Not what you said
What you put me through
I will never be trusting you again.

There's nothing you can say
There's nothing that will bring
me back to you.

I am done with you
I am done with broken
hearts you will never be
breaking mine again.
I am done with you
Step into the new me.
You will never be
breaking mine again.
Again
Breaking mine again
Again.

Yeah you made me weak.
You should see me now I will never fall down again.
Cut me into pieces but I am learning from my mistakes.

There's nothing I will keep from u.
Nothing I can get from you.
I am done with taking lies from you.

I am done with you
I am done with broken
hearts you will never be
breaking mine again.
I am done with you
Step into the new me.
You will never be
breaking mine again.
Again
Breaking mine again
Again.

This is the last time I am leaving you
Since the last time you're stabbing me.
This is the begaining of something new.
Never forget what you put me through.
You've made me
You've made me see.
Finally
Finally.

I am done with you

I am done with you
I am done with broken
hearts you will never be
breaking mine again.
I am done with you
Step into the new me.
You will never be
breaking mine again.
Again
Breaking mine again
Again.

Again.
