Innocent - like a fairytale
It started with the blink of an eye
Wonderful - it had to be fate
But the indifference made us say goodbye

It has come to an end now
It is time to say goodbye
Beautiful nightmare
Couldn't survive on the battlefield
But now I'm starting to heal
Beautiful nightmare

Lucky that we reached the top
As they say what goes up must come down
Happy? Couldn't be more wrong
I gave us the benefit of the doubt

It has come to an end now
It is time to say goodbye
Beautiful nightmare
Couldn't survive on the battlefield
But now I'm starting to heal
Beautiful nightmare

Cause it was worth it
All along, despite the panic attacks
Cause it was worth it
And even though it's wrong
I just wanna go back
I know it's bad for me
Can't resist it
I need it badly
To exist and to live
I clench my fist in the air 
And here I go, yeah
Beautiful nightmare
Beautiful nightmare
