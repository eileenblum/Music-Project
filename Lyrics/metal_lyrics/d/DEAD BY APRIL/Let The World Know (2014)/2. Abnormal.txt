Who are you to call me abnormal?
Who are you to say ugly?
If you only knew how much it hurts me, it hurts me.
I could ask have you seen yourself in the mirror?
I'd rather keep my dignity
Cause it is my right to feel happy, happy.

To pick on the weak gives you strength.
Feeling self-confident with your friends
But just because you see me alone
It doesn't mean that I've got no one to call on the phone.
Everyday, every second of my life
Is a fight to survive
Outnumbered, put against the wall
It's about to get physical.

Who are you to call me abnormal?
Who are you to say ugly?
If you only knew how much it hurts me, it hurts me.
I could ask have you seen yourself in the mirror?
I'd rather keep my dignity
Cause it is my right to feel happy, happy.

I don't wanna be in this war.
But next time we meet down the corridor.
I'm prepared for the beating and then some more
And you will not stop when i fall to the floor.
Your friends get in on the fight
Even though I'm unconscious
and I'm covered in blood
Cannot defend myself
I can't defend myself.

Who are you to call me abnormal?
Who are you to say ugly?
If you only knew how much it hurts me, it hurts me.
(I could ask) Have you seen yourself in the mirror?
I'd rather keep my dignity
Cause it is my right to feel happy, happy.

I hate you
I've got blood in my eyes
I hate you
I've got ice in my veins.

Who are you to call me abnormal?
Who are you to say ugly?
If you only knew how much it hurts me, it hurts me.
I could ask have you seen yourself in the mirror?
I'd rather keep my dignity
Cause it is my right to feel happy, happy.
