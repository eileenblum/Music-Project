Iâve been questioning myself the wrong way
My insecurity made me wanna feel pain
Iâd put a knife to my wrist, and part of my story ends
Used to swallow them pills, tried to ease the pain
In fact the truth is, I did again and again

[Chorus:]
Hold on, hold on
Let me take the pain away
Hold on, hold on
Thereâs no need to feel afraid
âCause I am here and Iâll protect you
Tell me whatâs wrong?
What did they do to you, to you, to you, to you?
What did they do to you, to you, to you, to you?

Been approaching my inner self the wrong way
My self-esteem was so low, I only felt hate
My own worst enemy, but part of my story ends
After two years of battling, Iâm feeling better than
Iâm feeling better than ever, Iâll stay like this forever

[Chorus]

Fear not, Iâll never leave your side
Until the end, Iâll be here
Take my word for it, itâs the truth
Come here, itâs okay, itâs alright
Itâs okay, itâs alright
Let me hold you close

[Chorus]
