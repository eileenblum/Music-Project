At night I'm thinking of sweet revenge,
I'm breathing faster, faster,
I feel the anger, anger.
I'm redefining the meaning of evil,
inside I'm bleeding, bleeding
from all the beating, beating.

Let them pay
let them pay for the things that they've done,
let them suffer for infinity times infinity.

Watch closely and you'll see it in my face,
the battle scars, battle scars,
the bloody tears, the bloody tears.
Too many years of built up suppressed hate,
it has taken its toll on me.

Let them pay,
let them pay for the things that they've done,
let them suffer for infinity times infinity.

Don't speak your mind
if the words that come out is condescending,
don't even open your mouth
if there's only bad intentions.

It's taking its toll on me
it has to stop,
ask not for forgiveness,
cause you will pay,
you will pay for the things that you've did.
You will pay for infinity times infinity.

Let them pay,
let them pay for the things that they've done,
let them suffer for infinity times infinity.
