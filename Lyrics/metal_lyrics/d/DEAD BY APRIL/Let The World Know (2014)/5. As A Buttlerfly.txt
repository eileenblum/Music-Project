No, I just refuse to believe my eyes
In front of me something I can't recognize
You stood beside me all my life

The heart machines are ticking
I can hear the life support pumping
The line between life and death
Doesnât become any clearer than this
Cover with an oxygen mask
These words will be his last
With the energy he's got left
He turns to me and say

I cannot stand by you
Till the end of the world
Like I said I would do
No, I wonât be able to
Help you carry the weight
Of the world my time has come
Silent as a butterfly
I'll be flying beside you
Watching above you
Silent as a butterfly

All of a sudden I've lost my strength
Isn't it scary how things can change
It made an instant just like that

Whenever I have questions
You always have the answers
You told me about life and the
Importance of being yourself
What you are, you value honesty
How not to lose grip of reality
With both your feet on the ground

I cannot stand by you
Till the end of the world
Like I said I would do
No, I wonât be able to
Help you carry the weight
Of the world my time has come
Silent as a butterfly
I'll be flying beside you
Watching above you
Silent as a butterfly.
You weren't supposed to see me like this and I'm sorry
I would say itâs not true
But I will see you soon
Far away...

I cannot stand by you
Till the end of the world
Like I said I would do
No, I wonât be able to
Help you carry the weight
Of the world my time has come
Silent as a butterfly
I'll be flying beside you
Watching above you
Silent as a butterfly.
