I walk on my own to think it over,
I can't believe this is real,
It all seem so clear,
All seem so right,
I can't put to words how I feel,

In time you'll see,
What you mean to me,
Everyday I think of you

There's nothing here in the world,
That can replace you,
no...
There's nothing here in the world,
I can face without you,
no...

I'm lost in your eyes,
You're dreaming away from it,
Far away,where I can feel no pain,
With you I feel safe...
I know you keep me out of harms way,

In time you'll see,
What you mean to me,
Everyday I think of you

There's nothing here in the world,
That can replace you,
no...
There's nothing here in the world,
I can face without... you,

Anytime you doubt for facts,
Makes you wanna run away,
You think of what we had...
If it feels like everything,
Goes through alright,
I'll be standing here...

There's nothing here in the world,
That can replace you...

There's nothing here in the world,
That can replace you,
no...
There's nothing here in the world,
I can face without... you,

Nothing in this world can replace you...
Woah...
There is nothing
There is nothing
There is nothing...
