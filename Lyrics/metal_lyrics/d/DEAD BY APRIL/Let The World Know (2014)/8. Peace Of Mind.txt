Staying within your comfort zone
May feel saved, but it can have you fooled
It's treacherous
It's deceiving

You will not achieve peace of mind if you don't leave the past behind
No. No. No. No. No.
Make up with it once and for all, and never ever again you'll fall
No. No. No. No. No.

Beating around the bush is pointless
You need to bring down the walls you've built up
Surrounding you
Surrounding you.

You will not achieve peace of mind if you don't leave the past behind
No. No. No. No. No.
Make up with it once and for all, and never ever again you'll fall
No. No. No. No. No.

You need to dig deep
You need to work hard.

We dont have much time
Why don't make out the best of it?
Ye- heaaah

You will not achieve peace of mind if you don't leave the past behind
No. No. No. No. No.
Make up with it once and for all, and never ever again you'll fall
No. No. No. No. No.
