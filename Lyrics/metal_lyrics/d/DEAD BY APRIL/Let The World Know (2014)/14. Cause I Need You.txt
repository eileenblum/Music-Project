[Japanese Bonus Track]Since you've been away I've had the time to start realize
That when we meet again
I'll be first to apologize
Now when I hear people say
Be careful what you wish for
I know what they mean
I know what they mean

Don't leave
I'm struggling hard without you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
Don't go
I simply can not live without you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you

(need you, I need you)

Living with regret
Is a pain with no mercy
Think That I'd rather be dead
Than to live a life so empty
Now people ask me, They're saying
"Don't you know about karma" ? ?
I know what they mean
I know what they mean
But

Don't leave
I'm struggling hard without you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
Don't go
I simply can not live without you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you

'Cause I need you, need you, need you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you

Thank you for the memories (memories)
Thank you for the memories
Thank you for the memories
Thank you for the memories (memories)
Thank you for the memories
Yeah

Thank you for the memories
Thank you for the memories

Don't leave
I'm struggling hard without you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
Don't go
I simply can not live without you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you
'Cause I need you, need you, need you

Thank you for the memories (memories)
Thank you for the memories
Thank you for the memories
Thank you for the memories
Thank you for the memories
Yeah

Thank you for the memories
Thank you for the memories
