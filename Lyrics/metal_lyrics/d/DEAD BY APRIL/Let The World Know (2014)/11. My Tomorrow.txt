I've been thinkin' about,
Taking the easy way out,
Used, beaten, disposed, it's tainted,
I've been told it's too selfish,
Gotta fight 'til the finish,
Thank you but it's not helping,

Feel I can't forget the ending,
Getting tired of feeling so lonely..

But I am going to change my tomorrow,
I'll be on top of the world by tomorrow,
Got the strength, I can do it,
Not just saying, I'll prove it,
I'll prove it, I'll prove it..

Watching my rear-view mirror,
And what it is reflecting?
It's an image that's broken,
It is time for my change now,
Step up and be brave now,
How damn hard can it be..?

Feel I can't forget the ending,
Getting tired of feeling so lonely..

But I am going to change my tomorrow,
I'll be on top of the world by tomorrow,
Got the strength, I can do it,
Not just saying, I'll prove it,
I'll prove it, I'll prove it..

I'm flying away now,
I'm touching the sky now, yeah..
On top of the world now,
And I'm never going back..
I'm changed for the better,
Seeing brighter colors now,
On top of the world now,
And I'm never going back..

Feel I can't forget the ending,
Getting tired of feeling so lonely..

But I am going to change my tomorrow,
I'll be on top of the world by tomorrow,
Got the strength, I can do it,
Not just saying, I'll prove it,
I'll prove it, I'll prove it..
