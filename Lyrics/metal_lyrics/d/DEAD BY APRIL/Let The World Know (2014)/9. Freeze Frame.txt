Sometimes you run
Too scared to take, to take the fight
But hey, it's OK
I'm human too
I know what it's like

Awakening feelings
Buried in the past
Like dirt, like dirt, like dirt,
It's like running barefoot on ice
It's cold and it's piercing
Again and again
You slip, you slip, you slip,
I'm running barefoot on ice

Freeze frame right here, right now
Stop the clock and the hands of time
Take a moment, breathe in, breathe out
Everything is gonna be just fine
Freeze frame right here, right now
Freeze frame right here, right now

Sometimes it's hard
To turn your feelings into words
Bringing old memories back to life
That you've killed, you've killed, you've killed,

Disintegrate you from inside
Don't need no sympathy
And if I manage to stay alive, alive, alive,
I'll walk out of this with pride

Freeze frame right here, right now
Stop the clock and the hands of time
Take a moment, breathe in, breathe out
Everything is gonna be just fine

From 10 years of silence
I'm now breaking new ground
From a closed space of vacuum
I'm now starting to breathe
Take nothing for granted
That's what I have learned
That's what I have learned
That's what I have learned

Take a moment, breathe in, breathe out
Everything is gonna be just fine

Freeze frame right here, right now
Stop the clock and the hands of time
Take a moment, breathe in, breathe out
Everything is gonna be just fine

Freeze frame right here, right now
Freeze frame right here, right now
