Spit in my face 
Humiliate my dignity 
But I'm feeling great 
To me this is normality 

I try to think straight 
Is this really my worth? 
My heart gets in the way 
And it keeps saying it doesn't hurt 
Chaos 

Blaming myself 
For the things that you call me 
For the ways you act 
And how sick is that? 

I try to think straight 
Of something else than rebirth 
My heart gets in the way 
And seriously it hurts 

What you're going through 
It is real to you 
But you mind plus your heart makes two 

Look into my eyes 
What do you see? 
I'm someone who can show empathy 
When your mind's clouded by your heart 
It's not easy to see what's real n' what's not 
I give you my empathy 

Before you start judging 
Try hard to see the person I am 
I'm caring 
I'm humble and understanding 
I ask for your empathy 
To think of me as friendly 
To escape this reality 
I will need your empathy 

What you're going through 
It is real to you 
But you mind plus your heart makes two 

Look into my eyes 
What do you see? 
I'm someone who can show empathy 
When your mind's clouded by your heart 
It's not easy to see what's real n' what's not 
I give you my empathy
