I want it to be much more
Than a fading distant memory of the two of us
I keep our picture by the bed
We're greyed out bit I'll not give up on us, no I won't

I turn to the sky wondering where you are
Wondering where you are
I wonder if we look up on the same star
Same star

Maybe we're done maybe not
It does not change how I feel about us
Won't give up hope
You're more beautiful than any diamond found in this world
And damn I miss you so bad

I turn to the sky wondering where you are
Wondering where you are
I wonder if we look up on the same star
Same star
