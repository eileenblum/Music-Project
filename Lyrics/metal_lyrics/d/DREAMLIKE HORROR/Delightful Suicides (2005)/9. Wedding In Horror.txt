My blood...for You!
My guts...for You!

My blood will dress your naked body
Paint you and adorn you
With my very own essence

With this knife
I will open up my chest
As a treasure box!
The extreme sacrifice
Will please my thirst
Of being you

Me inside you
Me as part of you

Knife me!
Knife me!
Dripping blood
It hurts
Knife me!
Pain...

Eat my pulsing warm heart
For my life's essence
Will forever be
Inside you

Me inside you
Me as part of you
Me inside you
Me as part of You!

My blood will run
Into your veins
My textures become part of yours
Forever
