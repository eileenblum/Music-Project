"She is always there...and I feel her!
And it's so cold here!
I left her in a hole in the ground
a few decades ago
a lonely place they call grave
...and then at night my crystals vibrate in the cold wind
though all the windows are closed
the old stairs creek!
I can feel her! I can feel her presence!
She is here! And she hasn't forgiven me!"

"Were you looking for me mommy?
You left me in a dark, dark place!
I came here to see you, mommy!
Maybe you wanna play doll with me?
Daddy told me, you have been a bad, bad mommy!
But I don't think it's true!"

"A BAD BAD mommy!"

Being selfish, being mean
has been making souls unclean
put your daughter in the ground
what's been done will come around!

"Put your daughter in the ground!
Who you have killed will come around!
Put your daughter in the ground!
Who you have killed will come around!"

"Mamma took the life from me
I am still around as you can see
now of her I will take care
try and stop me if you dare!"
