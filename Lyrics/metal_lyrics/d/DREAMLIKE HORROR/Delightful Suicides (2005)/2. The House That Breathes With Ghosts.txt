The old house lays now empty
in a yard where plants grow wild
left behind and abandoned
in the ashes of the past

It's the house that breathes with ghosts!
It's the house you want the most!

She wanted to leave the humid room
infested by spirits of ancient souls
No! They wont leave her alone, no!
They wont leave the house!

I don't wanna see her glasses in the cupboard
I don't wanna see her table cloths
All that she left here
signs of a life that is past and gone
yet so full of memories that live in my heart...

It's the house that breathes with ghosts!
Don't you forget...
