The first time I saw your face
Two ruby eyes shining from the ground
You were tired and abandoned
In the humid arms of the grass

Green moist from your mouth
Livid lips, red wounded flesh
Spoiled wet flowers in your strawy hair
Turned into a cobweb, an insect nest!

As I saw you laying so twisted in the mud
My mouth wide open, suffocated a scream of HORROR in the throat!

Crawl worm, crawl!
Insinuating your tongue in the gap of the ground!

Crawl worm, crawl!
As your creepy hands reach out for mercy!

Sleep, forever sleep now
Until your soul will be sucked by the unknown
Ascending spiral from the sky
Will suck away the dust
From us and our poor human rests
From us and our poor human rests!
