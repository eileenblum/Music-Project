I hear them breathing in the night
their fair bodies laying like muses on scarlet couches
ancient beauties pale as statues, once adored
pin-curled heads, gracefully leaning on bare shoulders

A red lips smile
like a rose, scarlet and voluptuous
blooming in the snow
the air is thick tonight
wet from sensual perfumes

Dry flowers left in vases
cover a light unperceivable
sweating smell
chairs dampened with erotic leaks
velvet stained in perfect lust... aahh
veils dropped on marble floors
as sensual layers of silk

Violins and pianos unleashing notes of romance
chains of pearls, beads and gold
the atmosphere is right tonight
two drops of venom
three drops of blood

Since the dawn of time...
Seduce me again...
... with your delightful suicides
