The story now begins straight right from the end
into the empty room a body lays over the bed
waking up one morning tears which wet her eyes
facing now the fear she always wanted to deny

"I will depart into the dreamy slumber
my lonely journey into my secret chamber
leaving emotions, abandoning fears
I'll miss you when I am gone
I'll write it in a letter my dear"

"My past lives now are before my eyes projecting
scenes for my blind eyes
I relive every sensation, every frustration, every emotion
I cherish my mortality but this is time to say goodbye"

"Without sensations enslaving me
I will now liberate my ego
my spirit will fly high
fly high, higher than an eagle"

"Even this circle has come to an end
for a new circle of time has to begin
I wonder how many worlds I will see
if my lost friends I'll meet again
and head up high I move forward to my next destination"

There she walks straight into her tub
into the silver mirror a reflection of herself
one last bath with flowers before she slips away
leaving now her mortal life
her poems will live in her name
