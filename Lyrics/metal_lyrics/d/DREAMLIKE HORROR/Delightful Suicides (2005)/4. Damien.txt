A dreadful omen, plague of Christianity,
Threatens the earth
Black evil powers find incarnation
To rape the holiness of the human world

The Devil has sent his messenger
Son of the black God
Wolf among the sheep's
Ripper of human souls

Icy eyes of a small kid
Strangle and kill
Born in a normal family
The sweet baby reveals a beast

Damien, the time has come to revenge your father
Damien, the flames of hell are in your eyes

As he grows up his powers develop
No affection for the son of the black mark
Hate, rage, disgust for the world
Feel the demonic strength

Dogs and animals
Scared they run
Away from this little being
Bound to be the chosen one
