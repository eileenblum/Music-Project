[Lyrics: Behemoth, Music: Heimdall, Herman Li, Matej Setinc]

The wolves will howl tonight
Stormy clouds will hide the light
A figure in the hills of fire
Your dreams of life retire

Black Evil won't you be it 
Lay down your sword your bleeding
You're one and only knight
To kill with all your might

Sending your soul to the fiery hell
You are the one, no one can tell
You are the knight

We are the demons of the night
We are the leaders of the reich
We are the firestorm that burns from above

The wolves will howl tonight
Stormy clouds will hide the light
A figure in the hills of fire
Your dreams of life retire

My Evil don't you want some?
The hate it's like no other one
Downwind of the  bleeding sorrow
Your death is my tomorrow

Sending your soul to the boundaries of hell

You are the one 
You are a demon of the night

We are the demons of the night
We are the leaders of the reich
We are the firestorm that burns from above

[Solo - Shred, Heimdall, Shred]
[Pre-chorus]

We are the demons of the night
We are the leaders of the reich
We are the firestorm that burns from above

[Solo - Shred]
