You shall be fuelled by the flames of the cemetery night
And the gods of remorse that will never see the light
Be in a time when the walls echo screams
And the black and darkened clouds send empty frozen dreams
Be one with me and return the dynasty
To the cloven hoofed beast, he will be your misery
Power anger hatred take your fucking life

Fight, kill, we're the ones of the blood take your fall
Flames, fire, and the beast from the east in the valley of desire
Pain, torture, we're the ones with the metal in our blood
Headbanging till we kill the false tonight!

Black, Death, Gas, Sons of the Master
Black, Death, Gas, Sons of the Master
Black, Death, Gas, Sons of the Master
Black, Death, Gas, Forever More
