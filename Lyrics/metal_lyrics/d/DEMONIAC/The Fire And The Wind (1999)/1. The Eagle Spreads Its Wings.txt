Fighting in this rotten hell we are trapped in a spell
And in the battles lands where no one can tell
The breathing beasts of fire calling to me
Chains of steel how can we be freed

They need a leader and the strongest of men
To save the dreams of the forgotten land
They live with torture of the fire and whips
And the shadows of death that bleeds to be free

There is a soldier
To free us from this time
With winter calling
We will survive

We fly
The eagle spreads its wings of life and destiny

See the dragons breathing see them flying in the sky
Killing all the mortals lets us watch and see them die
We kill!
We hear the screams of the laughter
We fly!
To crush and cause disaster
WE FLY!
