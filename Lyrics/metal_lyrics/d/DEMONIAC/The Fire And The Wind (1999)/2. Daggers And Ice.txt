I have no eyes to see, hands to kill

I am lost in the darkness
See the spirits coming to life
Winter breeze, children of the storming
Ghostly spirits, blinding eyes, feel retreat
Daggers of a thousand eyes

I have the power
To feel the demons cutting through your screaming
I have no body, no eyes
Just fucking death!

You can feel the pain inside my mind

The winter breeze is torturing the skies
Of life and death for all
That breeds inside your mind
In reverence of lies
We will be seeking
Daggers and ice

You can feel the pain inside my mind

The winter breeze is torturing the skies
Of life and death for all
That breeds inside your mind
In reverence of lies
We will be seeking
Daggers and ice

You can feel the pain inside my mind

The winter breeze is torturing the skies
Of life and death for all
That breeds inside your mind
In reverence of lies
We will be seeking
Daggers and ice

You can feel the pain inside
It cuts me like a knife inside my brain
Shadowed feelings of winter time again and again
