In the dark of the night when the wolves are howling to me
As we prepare for war and we sing dormant entity
Gonna kill the witch when the castle of dooms alight
Gonna fight the war when we beat the whores
That's right

The lords are enslaved now the fear of metal come
The cannons of noise will explode, the damage is done

Hitler Metal want to bang my fucking head
And fist the living dead in the middle of the night alright
I really want to bang my head and fist the living dead middle of the night my sign
The Metal's in my blood and the power is here and now for you!
HITLER METAL! SIEG HEIL!

[Note: For the NERDS... No this song is NOT about]
[Hilter or any of your politics bullshit! If you don't]
[get the joke, fuck off. This song is about banging to]
[heavy fucking metal and having a good laugh. We don't]
[give a fuck about Hitler. Fuck off if you don't have a]
[sense of humour. - Demoniac]
