Racing down the motorway, I am a mean machine
Speeding like a bullet, we are the wreaking team
Bang our heads to heavy metal, thrashing through the night
Beating up the faggots, we are here to start a fight

If you don't like our metal then you're a fucking fool
Fucking loads of sluts and drinking loads of booze
Studded wrists and bullet belts its metal all the way
If you're not into metal then you are fucking gay

Be prepared we're as fast as lightning
Motorhead and lots of fighting
Lots of chains on the walls in our chamber
Pumped up we're full of anger
Playing metal as loud as we can
All men fucking play it on ten

We're here to fight baby, we are the ones
We're into metal here are our guns
We like the speed and the fury from hell
Come play with fire you're under our spell
Come with me, one night in hell
You will succumb the DEMONIAC SPELL

We're here to fight baby, we are the ones
We're into metal here are our guns
We like the speed and the fury from hell
Come play with fire you're under our spell
Come with me, one night in hell
You will succumb the DEMONIAC SPELL

Raging Pyromaniac and nothing will survive
Holocaustic Terrorist
We will watch and see you die!
