Dragons cursing, the funeral fire
The screaming cries heard throughout the night
The red horizons, the shadowy figure
Now you'll die in an ancient time
The people running, escape the village
Warrior of death will take your fucking life
The candles burning, beware the evil one
Ravens gathering around the cross

The graves upturning, day is now burning
Living dead are among the night
The preachers burning, the priests heads turning
Zombies killing all in sight
They will now kill you, I will now kill you
Gather the raven to pick your eyes
I will now kill you, I will now kill you
We are the demons of an evil time

We are the creatures of the night
We are the demons that make up your mind
Maniac sorcerer now come, eternal death is what I would like

I am evil and evil is me
I am the evil the evil you breathe
I am evil and evil is me
I am the evil the black demon seed
Demons and witches will gather
A serpent a beast and a winged one of curse
I am evil and evil is me
I am the evil the evil you breathe
