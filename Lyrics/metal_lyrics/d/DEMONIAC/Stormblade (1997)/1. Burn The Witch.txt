A candlelight in the middle of a frozen night
The wolfen figure sends it's message to the lords of might
Can you obey me as the one who keeps the shadow form
If you dishonor i'll kill you with the fire sign
A screaming ghost, the power gives you fear alone
The preacher cries as he's given up the will to fight
He will now come in the form power of the hidden skies
The cauldron burning the witch of another time
The fallen age, the keepers of the sands of time
The burning flesh the smell of evil all around
Will you forgive a blistered bitch in a time of flies

Blistered bitch in a time of flies

Read the book of the mighty warrior
He sheds his skin in the equinox of winter
He has the power to possess your body
He is immortal, a high priest figure

We'll burn the witch tonight
We'll burn the witch tonight
We'll burn the witch tonight
We'll burn the witch tonight
Underneath the dawning light
We'll burn the witch tonight
