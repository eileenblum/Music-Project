[Part I]

Blackened clouds across a hazen sky
Sacred key to the haunted world of dreams
And in this place we know the hero's face their fall
There is no reason to wear the mask of lies
And as the end is near the blessed shed their tears
The cavern light bears it's soul of an ancient time
The course of light is demise

They don't know the smell of poison from air
The flying beasts breathing fire everywhere
Come and kill with me
Into the cavern light
Creatures in the dead of night

[Part II]

And now the fear has turned to hatred
And so the battle just begun
The ashes blacken out the sky tonight
Your suffering has just begun
Creeping shadows move towards me, I begin a fight
I have no will to die and in the midst of the clouds
I'm seeing, seeing the form of the beast
Creeping shadow move toward me as I begin a fight
I have no will to die and in the midst of the clouds
I'm seeing, seeing the form of the beast
Beyond the shadow light, beyond the shadow light

Bewitched demons move across the sky, bewildering
Beasts of the crimson demon sea, and in this place
We know the hero's are no more and the end is near
The blessed shed their tears 
The cavern light bears it's soul of an ancient time
The course of light is now demise
