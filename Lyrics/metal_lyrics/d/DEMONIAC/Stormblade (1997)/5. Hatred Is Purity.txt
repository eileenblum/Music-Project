Blood proud, blood pure, their blood
Spilled once more, sacred ground, might stand tall
Crush their spirit, till they fall

Aliens invade this place, white man stand up for your race
Be proud of your heritage, strong will, all through the ages
Angered but still with pride, show true feelings with nothing to hide

Hatred is purity, weakness is disease
Do you know what I mean?
Have you heard or seen?
So much anger but so much pride
I want to see them all dying

Hatred is purity, weakness is disease
Stand fall stand proud, speak thoughts out aloud
And start this war for you
