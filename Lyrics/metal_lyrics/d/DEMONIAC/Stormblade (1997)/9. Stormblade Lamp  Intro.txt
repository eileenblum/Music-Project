Across the mist and through the fog
A shadowy figure in black
Through the rain with his sword held high
The man moves through the tracks
He is the myth of a thousand years
Who's feared for his strength and power
The dragons he's slayed and the beasts he's killed
And the many he's fought he's devoured
He is the one, the ungodly one
The one who will spare no life
He'll meet you on the battle ground
And feast upon your blood
He'll raise his sword in his deadly glory
And move from land to land
He is the dark one Stormblade
And soon you will be damned

A violent howl among the wolves tonight
The choking screen of smoke fills the sky
And as the stormblade comes to take your life
No fucking mercy as he ends your fucking life
He is a soldier from another world
He'll make you bleed when he's taken your life
You have to die and you are his sacrifice
I'm the one who will never fucking die!

Chaotic times in a time to die
Evil masses of a brutal killing time
Blasphemic warriors see the darker sign
I'm the one who will never fucking die!

Feeling the power of the chosen one
A night of terror of the chosen one
A night of terror for the mortal
Counting the flames above the fire
The end of my life has betrayed
I now die before the end is near
Please cut my throat I want to die

The stormblades running and my kill is coming
Stabbing and stabbing and killing I want to
Bring in the axes so 9 can now kill you
I'll take your life so 9 can then skin you
