Itâs all so clear now
As golden dawn erodes the night
Heâs left you to drown
In the flooded chambers of your mind

His ghost is burning
In the very places you most loved
His cancerâs burning
Silver tears come crashing down

Concealing
all that could be shown
Descending
From the highest throne

She hides herself behind her smile
Emerald eyes belie the deepest longing
Of her heart

This crimson reverie
In sordid ecstasy
The fallen knight who bled your skin
Consumes your dreams

Fear permeates you
He overtakes you
The moon-lit knight who burns within
Consumes your life

Forever
Scarred by loving hands
But never
A loving touch she felt

Her spirit climbs into the sky
Spectral eyes betray the darkest longing
Of her soul

Seething, screaming, she meets his gaze - judgement
Shrouded within a scarlet haze
Trembling, doubting, she twists the knife - deeper
Reborn anew in amber life - she frees herself
