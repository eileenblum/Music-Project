Blessed are those who want to do
the will of him they choose
cause his commands are not burdensome
for everyone born of god overcomes the world

For everything in the world
the gravings of sinful man
the lust of the eyes
and the boasting of what he has and does
the world and its desires
pass away
but those who do the will of god
live forever

Cursed are those who trust in man
who depends on flesh for his strength
and whose heart turns away from god

Blessed are those who trust in him
whose confidence is in god
