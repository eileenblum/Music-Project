For this is what the lord himself has said about his table
On the night when Judas betrayed him
the lord jesus took bread and gave
god thanks for it
Broke it and gave it to the disciples

Take this and eat it for this my body
Do this in memory of me
Take this and eat it for this my body
Do this in memory of me

In the same way he took the cup of wine
saying this cup is the new agreement
That has been established
and set in motion by my blood

Take it and drink it for this my blood
Do this in memory of me
Take it and drink it for this my blood
Do this in memory of me

Holy supper
Examine your heart
Holy supper
Examine your heart

Take this and eat it for this my body
Do this in memory of me
Take this and eat it for this my body
Do this in memory of me
[repeat]

Holy supper
Examine your heart
Holy supper
Examine your heart
[repeat]
