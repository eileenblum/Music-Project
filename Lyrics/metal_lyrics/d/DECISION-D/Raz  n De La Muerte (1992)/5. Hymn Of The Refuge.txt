O god defend me from the enemy
For you are god my only place of refuge
Why have you tossed me aside?
Why must I mourn because of them?

Send out your light and truth,
please lead me to your temple
to your holy mountain
I'll go to your altar my exceeding joy
And praise you lord with my music

O god, my lord! O my soul
why be so gloomy and discouraged?
Trust in god, trust him!
Trust in god
I'll praise him for his wonderful help
