The noise of battle is in the land
the noise of great destruction
how broken and shattered
is the hammer of the whole earth
come against her from afar
break open her granaries
pile her up like heaps of grain
completely destroy her and leave her to remnant

I am against you, oh arrogant one
I am against you, for your day has come to be punished

See, i will stir up the spirit of destroyer
I will send foreigners to winnow her
and to devastate her land
They will oppose her on every sie
in the day of her disaster
I will surely (fill you with men and they will)
shout in triumph over you

I am against you, oh arrogant one
I am against you, for your day has come to be punished

The noise of battle is in the land
the noise of great destruction
how broken and shattered
is the hammer of the whole earth
come against her from afar
break open her granaries
pile her up like heaps of grain
completely destroy her and leave her to remnant
