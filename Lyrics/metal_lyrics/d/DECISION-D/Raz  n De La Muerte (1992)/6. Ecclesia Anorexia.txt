These are the words of the amen
the faithful and true witness
the ruler of god's creation
I know your deeds
that you are neither cold nor hot
I wish you were either one or the other
So, because you are lukewarm
- neither hot nor cold -
I'm about to spit you out of my mouth

Those whom I love I rebuke and disciple
so be earnest and repent.
Here I am!
I tand at the door and knock
If anyone hears my voice
and opens the door
I will come in and eat with him
and he with me

You say, I am rich,
I have acquired wealth
and do not need a thing.
But you do not realize
that you are wretched,
pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
I counsel you to buy from me gold
refined in the fire.

Those whom I love I rebuke and disciple
so be earnest and repent.
Here I am!
I tand at the door and knock
If anyone hears my voice
and opens the door
I will come in and eat with him
and he with me

These are the words of the amen
the faithful and true witness
the ruler of god's creation
I know your deeds
that you are neither cold nor hot
I wish you were either one or the other
So, because you are lukewarm
- neither hot nor cold -
I'm about to spit you out of my mouth
