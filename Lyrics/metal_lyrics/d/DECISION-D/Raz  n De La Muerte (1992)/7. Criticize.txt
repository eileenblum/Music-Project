Standing on stage, playing loud
Rock 'n roll singer telling about
Planet earth and what's going wrong
Pointing his finger
He's got a pistol, he's using it well
Telling me who and what are hell
Shooting dow all our enemies
The real gunslinger
Turn on the news, it's easy to see
Filthiness of society
Mrs. Justice is far away
What did she leave behind

Lies, corruption, acid rain
Rape and war, this world's insane
I do agree with you
But you are blind
If the mind is rotten so the deeds will be
You make no difference to me
Judging but acting just like them
You show no better way
New hearts are what we need
Good and righteous seeds
Will produce better fruits
Faith is the way

Now tell me isn't it strange
We are not able to change
Now tell me isn't it strange
There is no change

Well you may think it's strange
But christ did make the change
Well you may think it's strange
christ did

Standing on stage, playing loud
Rock 'n roll singer telling about
Planet earth and what's going wrong
Pointing his finger
He's got a pistol, he's using it well
Telling me who and what are hell
Shooting dow all our enemies
The real gunslinger
Turn on the news, it's easy to see
Filthiness of society
Mrs. Justice is far away
What did she leave behind
