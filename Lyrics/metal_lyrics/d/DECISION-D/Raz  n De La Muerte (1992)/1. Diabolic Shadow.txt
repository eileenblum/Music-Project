Satan, we come against you in the name of jesus christ, son of god who
appeared to destroy the devil's work displayed in all kinds of counterfeir,
miracles, signs and wonders and in every sort of evil that deceives those who
are perishing. They perish because they refuse to love the truth and so be
saved. For this reason god sends them a powerful delusion so that they will
believe the lie and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the
truth, but have delighted in wickedness.

Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from
god, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you
can recognize the spirit of god: every spirit that acknowledges that jesus
christ has come in the flesh is from god. But every spirit that does not, is
not from god. This is the spirit of Antichrist, which you have heard is coming
and even now is already in the world. This is how we recognize the spirit of
truth and the spirit of falsehood.

Fear god and give him glory because the hour of his judgement has come
Worship him who made heaven and earth.

Fear god and give him glory because the hour of his judgement has come
Worship him who made heaven and earth.
