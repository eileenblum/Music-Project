Threatening our, our people
Force feeding ignorance down their throats
Chaotic mischievous lies
Make a promise as the sun dries
A black cloud will hover as they spit in your face
We are the ones they chase
The best and brightest don't work for you
They show their rage against everything you do
They all lie, they all steal, they all cheat.
The title goes to the highest bidder
The one that won't be beat
Keep your rage alive [2x]
Make America great again,
Keep your rage alive and kill the bastards
The blind leading the stupid
Your brains are all polluted
This evil being will claim its throne
Hateful pig his colors he has shown
Keep hate in your heart,
Show no weakness,
Stand united and stand proud,
Let nothing and no one destroy your convictions,
And most importantly
Keep your rage alive
