We the poison
We are the thief
We are the evil you must see to believe
We are the ones who watch the world burn
We are the fucking disease
A disease that infects our nation
We will haunt your fucking dreams
We are the ones who wanna watch the world
We are the fucking disease
A disease that infects our nation
We will haunt your fucking dreams
Sleep with one eye open don't you dare try to think your safe
We will come and we will find you
In this world there is no room for the brave
I am the poison
I am the thief
I am the evil you must see to believe
You are the hunted trying to escape from my every move
I slither like a fucking snake
Venom ready your my slave to make
