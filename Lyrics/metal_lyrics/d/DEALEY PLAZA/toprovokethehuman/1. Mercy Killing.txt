When will he be free
A frail man, drowning in his own depression
Nothing left but skin and bone
Push away the life he's known
His heart is empty
He's abandoned what was once his home
He's confined to a world of darkness
Just to ensure he dies alone
A cold wet touch
With blood shot eyes
Despising the world he lives in
Nobody to hear his cries
Fuck
Dreams of a better place
Crushed by the world he sees
He sees filth and to him that's all it will be
This tortured soul will be gone and forgotten death was his release
He is now free
