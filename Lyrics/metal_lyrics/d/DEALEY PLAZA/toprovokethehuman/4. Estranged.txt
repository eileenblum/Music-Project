Where the fuck have you gone
I can only hear you and I hope you fucking cry every time you bring yourself back overseas
The euphoria of confusion is eating away at me
My brain is bleeding
I can't make it stop
The world it's out there and I've seen it in your fucking eyes
This is my writing off to the world
I found myself in Heidelberg
My heart was on Florence
Somewhere in the vineyard
I'll bury that fucking boy of I get the chance
Until then I'll stay bitter
Were all bitter
Fuck your life
I wish you the worst
Fuck your life
I'll stay bitter
I wish you the worst
Fuck your life
