My views are shattered
My reality is fiction
I cannot distinguish the truth
My body compulses with fear
These are my dreams
These are my nightmares
I am here to haunt you
I'm here to keep you safe
I will rip your life in two
You are safe in this place
My views are shattered
My reality is fiction
Not knowing if seeing is believing
I can't even trust myself
These are my dreams
These are my nightmares
I am here to haunt you
I'm here to keep you safe
I will rip your life in two
You are safe in this place
These world will haunt me for the rest of my life
