I have suffered
I possess no control
&amp; now I'm trapped
In a fucked up way of life

Life decayed
There is no lie to defeat the truth
Digging away at your brain
You can't even fathom the pain that I've endured

Your brain
Couldn't process this
This hypocrisy is overwhelming to me
Choke on your guilt
They won't let you
Spit it up

Choke on my guilt
I am pure filth
Choke on my guilt
I disgust me

Fucked in the brain
Only pain
I am merely just a stain in this fucked up world
My life is worth more than all of this
But there is no escape from this prison

[2x]
My inner demons are at war with the good in me
No hope for peace
No freedom from their tyranny
