Death will find me
As cold as the winter
As dark as a broken light
Oh God, why God?

Will I have left anything to remember or I'm just gone?
Cause when you're done you're done

The wheel keeps turning
There's no break in the cycle
It keeps fucking turning
There is no fucking break

Romanticizing things like that I should exist
If I bite my tongue then I find my brain is pissed
Just another name to Death's fucking list
Yeah, to death's fucking list

No one is safe from the kiss of death
A kiss so bitter
What happens to you when you die?

Eternity living in darkness
Forever with, with the ones you love
I, I live in fear
This rests in me, my fear of uncertainty

My biggest fear of death is that your lives will move on
Will anyone remember me?
