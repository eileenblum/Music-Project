[feat. Bryan of Knocked Loose]The moon has never felt so cold
The sun has never looked so dark
These feeling won't ever go away
They're locked inside of me
These are my facts
This is not a prophecy
[2x]

Forever &amp; ever
Do you think of me
Cause I think of you
The constant space &amp; the shit we've been through
I am so dark
I'm so cold
I'm so broken
I regret every word I left unspoken

Do you think of me
Cause I think of you
&amp; all the fucked up shit you don't have a clue
I want you to pour your crazy in me
I'm so sorry that I wasn't what you wanted me to be

Forever &amp; ever
Balancing insanity for the heartbreaker

[Bryan]
Blank fucking stares
Blank stares
My mind is racing
Tied to the bed
My body's still pacing
You are the most angelic
Evil I have ever tasted
Destroying pawns
With the time that has been wasted

We know this life has matched us
A broken heart doesn't sound that bad
It sounds like pieces of you are resting throughout my body

Vultures awaits your lonesome
Living life in fast forward never stopping for the now
Balancing insanity
[2x]

The moon has never felt so cold
The sun has never looked so dark
These feeling won't ever go away
They're locked inside of me
These are my facts
This is not a prophecy
