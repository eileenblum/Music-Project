You worthless fuck

Fishing for affection in a sea of rejection
Hook line &amp; sinker
Pulled up form suffocating can't breath
Cut open for the world to see

Neglecting all of your previous convictions
Who the fuck are you
What the fuck have you turned into
You fucking slut

You feed off the misery of others
Disgrace to the human race
As charming as rap
&amp; as beautiful as death
I fear your falling off the deep end

You disguise yourself but I see your true colors
Empty is what you are a burden to society
Cheap slut with a dick in her mouth
Why don't you just kill yourself

Disgrace to the human race
As charming as rape
&amp; as beautiful as death
I fear you're falling off the deep end

You bitch your game has already been played you are the fucked up &amp; you are not worth my time
