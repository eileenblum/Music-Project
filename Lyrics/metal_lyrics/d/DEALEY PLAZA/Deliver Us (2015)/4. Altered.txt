Prescribed illness is taking over me
Warping my brain &amp; everything I see
These numb fingers are the only thing
Proving to me that I am real

My fingers picked to the bone
My teeth are falling out of my head
My nails cracking
My fucking eyes are sinking in

I want my life back
You can't control me
You won't control me
I want my life back
You can't control me
I want my fucking life back

A schizophrenic type of behavior
I cannot grasp reality

Altered state of consciousness
Causing my perception to grow weak
Abandoning reality
Downgrading my mentality
Muscles constantly spazzing
Never seeing things for what they are
Laying back as my future decays
Unaware if this ever strays
I want my fucking life back

My fingers picked to the bone
My teeth are falling out of my head
My nails cracking
My fucking eyes are sinking in

I want my life back
You can't control me
You won't control me
I want my life back
You can't control me
I want my fucking life

Dead from the neck up
