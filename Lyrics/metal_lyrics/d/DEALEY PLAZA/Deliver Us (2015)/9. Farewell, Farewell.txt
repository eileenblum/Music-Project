Fuck

A cold chill always resting in my bones
My words &amp; thoughts will remain unknown
No one will ever see
The appalling darkness that rests in me

I lay contemplating whether my thoughts are clear
The curse of life
Contemplating every single fucking fear
Tie the noose around my neck &amp; kick out the chair (kill me)

Tie the noose around my neck &amp; kick out the fucking chair
There's something calming about my body just hanging there
We all smile &amp; pretend that were okay
But life's a bitch it gets harder everyday

Why am I so empty?
Why?
Will this ever go away no
Why?
Won't this go away

I always find myself on my knees
Looking up at you for the answers
For the questions that I seek
Are you there can you help me?

I sit &amp; stare expecting the Earth to stop
I can't fathom what has come over me
Nobody sees it
Nobody feels it
Dear God do you think I'm insane?

Can you hear me?
Do you feel me?
[3x]

I isolate myself like a prisoner on death row
No place I like to call home
This feeling that rests in me
I turn it off so no one will see

I lay contemplating whether my thoughts are clear
The curse of life
Contemplating every single fucking fear
Tie the noose around my neck &amp; kick out the chair
Kick out the chair [2x]
(There's something calming about my body just hanging there)
I don't want to be here

We all die alone
That's how our story will close
Am I scared are you scared are they scared?
So say your prayers so you know you're prepared
