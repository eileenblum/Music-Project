Severed, broken, &amp; hung out to dry
Bitter cold &amp; fucking disheartened
(It's all your fault)
You could've made it stop
But now I'm all alone &amp; I'm gunning for your conscious

Oh my god what have I become
I'm so sorry it's me bitter &amp; some
Oh my god what have I become
So keep it a secret

Drink the poison
Fake the smile
[2x]
Fake the smile

Just like Romeo &amp; Juliet
This story will end with a suicide
I've never felt so alive
Or contradictive in my whole life

Oh my god what have I become
I'm so sorry it's me bitter &amp; some
Oh my god what have I become
So keep it a secret
Drink the poison
Fake the smile

Take me back to when our souls flew free
&amp; our minds screamed empathy
back when we were young
The world was bright
I hate to say you've become the void in my eyes

The devil has blue eyes
Just ask me about her
The devil has blue eyes
So just ask me
