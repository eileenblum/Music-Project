You'll soon drowned in a lake of your own tears
Created by the guilt you feel
For the lives you have despaired [2x]

Please shut your eyes &amp; allow me to haunt your dreams
So dark, so pale, so delightfully heartless
So heartless

I've no more blood to bleed
All I feel is the ghost of you
My life is a lot less frightening now
It's a lot less frightening now

I'm always on the streets listening to the song you'd sing
My bone ache from the chill of your absence
I don't want you to turn into a faded memory [2x]
Shut your eyes &amp; allow me to haunt your dreams [2x]

I have no more blood to bleed
My body's been drained for everyone to see

So cold, so heartless
If it's all about you
Then what about me
What about me
When will I be free
Please shut your eyes &amp; allow me to haunt your dreams
So dark, so pale, so delightfully heartless
So heartless
