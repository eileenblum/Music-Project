I'm looking for the courage to end it all
One night blessed with depressing
&amp; it's all gone [2x]
Oh please lord help me
Please lord help me
Gone forever, show yourself
Give me the push I need
To finish what I've started

When it's all done
So many happy faces
Smiling in a row
Standing over my casket
No more lies
Gone forever
No more hate
Gone forever

Dead &amp; gone
It's what we all want
Or at least believe
I'll trust my instincts
So please, lord
I was once a lovely boy
Full of life
Full of love
Aspiration
Motivation
Full of life

Please lord help me
Gone forever
Show yourself now
Give me the push I need
To finish what I've started
I'm looking for the courage to end it all
To end it all
One night blessed with depression
And it's all gone [2x]
Oh please lord help me

It's all gone
So now I need to help to kill myself
In the name of the Father
In the name of the Father, Son, &amp; Holy Spirit
Amen
