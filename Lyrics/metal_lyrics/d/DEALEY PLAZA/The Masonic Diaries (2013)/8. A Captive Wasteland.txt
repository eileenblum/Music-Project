Conform into slavery
March with your brainless peers
[2x]

Heed to their
Their every word
&amp; don't you dare
Ask questions
Trust in
Authority
&amp; please
Please listen

They wanna strip you of your freedom &amp; your motherfucking rights
You think your free?
In a country where wrong is right
You live your life with no concern
But to me that's ob-fucking-surd

There's no hope here
No chance of being free
In a captive wasteland
There's no form of democracy
[2x]

We are prisoners in this wasteland
We are becoming enslaved
This is not the right evolution
I thought this was the home of the brave
[4x]

Conform into slavery
March with your brainless peers
[2x]
