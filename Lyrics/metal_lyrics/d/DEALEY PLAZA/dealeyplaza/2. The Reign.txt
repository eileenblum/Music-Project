So shrink my rights
but I wont stray away
false promises of hope
I refuse to believe every word you say
how dare we sit back and allow facist rule
to corrupt the land to which we paved the way

Its time to stand up
but how do we know that we will be heard
ill take my chance
because credits due were credits earned
we must unite and take a stand
for its we the people
and we refuse to go with facist plan

So shrink my rights
but I wont stray away
false promises of hope
I refuse to believe every word you say
how dare we sit back and allow facist rule
to corrupt the land to which we paved the way

That we fucking paved the way
you should all be ashamed
this is my home
and they are a fucking plague of sin

Where is your freedom
Where is your liberty
Where is your freedom
Where is your liberty

You must not wait
you must search for the truth
with tyranny comes corruption rotting to the root
we will proclaim to take down this empire and
search for freedom
for we the people must conspire

They must fear the people
We are the free
They must fear the people
FREE
