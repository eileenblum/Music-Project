Absolute power formed off of corruption
one bank, one army, one center built within
enriching those with political connections
deprive the poor, the weak, the old

avoid change and avoid our conflict
avoid a peaceful revolution
we sacrifice our future
by increasing the chance that they will be
put up for auction
who lends to a country hell bent on empire
who lends to a country that would poison
its own people

let the price of injustice accrue to those committing it not to the innocent
let the price of injustice accrue to those committing it

avoid change and avoid our conflict
avoid a peaceful revolution
we sacrifice our future
by increasing the chance that they will be
put up for auction

let the price of injustice accrue to those committing it and not to the innocent
let the price of injustice accrue to those committing it and not to the innocent

Absolute power formed off of corruption
one bank, one army, one center built within
Enriching those with political connections
deprive the poor, the weak, the old

THIS IS INJUSTICE
