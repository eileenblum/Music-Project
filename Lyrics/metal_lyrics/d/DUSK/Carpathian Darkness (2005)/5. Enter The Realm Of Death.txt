When all is frozen in me
As a glance towards death
I feel its breath inside me
Its infinite frost
As it embraces and touches me
As I find it
I have seen looking for it for so long
Perchance there has been no beginning
But now I am full of
Infinite frost
That freezes all souls to ice
That doesn't  let any hearts to fame
I couldn't see it as a mortal
But now I became one with it
It has always been here in me
But no mortal can enter here

Outside life
The gate of a new world
A gate between life and death
The gate is here
But can't be seen alive
Just when I am stepping over
Every life of mine
And entering
To the black unknown
Entering to the eternal darkness...
Where I am one with it
And so I can see
I've found it after a thousand lives
And entered to a black unknown
Entered to the eternal darkness...
