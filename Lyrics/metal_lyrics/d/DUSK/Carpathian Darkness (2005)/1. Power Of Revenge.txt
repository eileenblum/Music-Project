Buried in another world,
Locked in a rock deeply,
All memories forgotten,
That chained to me somewhere,
And when everybody believes,
Me to be dead,
Then shall my time come,
When I seemingly fall,
Then suddenly,
My eyes open,
The rock falls from me,
Like dust,
World of revenge speaks again,
There exists no time to forget it,
And now as I am awaken,
The body I have been buried in,
Now Dies,
For the truth has killed,
The body of a liar dream,
In that I have been captured,
And now I see the place,
Over even this,
The place inside me,
That's me,
Where no life dwells,
Where dust fell from me.
