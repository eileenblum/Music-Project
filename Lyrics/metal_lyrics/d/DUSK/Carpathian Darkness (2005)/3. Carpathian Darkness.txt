In an ice-cold forest
Darkness covers the forest
And surrounds me also
I'm full of eternal hate
A fore blazes in my eyes
As once
When last time I walked on earth
So dark is this forest
So cold are these winds
My scream penetrates
That depth of wood
And all voices become
An immerse scream
Destruction and hate in my eyes
I am one with the wood
With the raging winds

Bloody spills to the soil
All is frosty and gray
Frost penetrates me
I am blazing as a fire
In valleys and mountains
Rocks and immerse woods
I lurk as a shadow
I watch and wait
My time to come
And now a fire blazing in my eyes
Like fire of hell
Glowing glance
We are the shadows of the woods
The word of revenge and hate
Darkness is now growing
In the Carpathian forests
I arise from my ashes
And freezing winds acompany...
My arrival...
