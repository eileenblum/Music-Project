I am everywhere
I lurk there in everybody
I slip along as shadow everywhere
I lurk in the background
And from time to time
I break free to surface
I am the darkness
The true is behind the lie
Behind images of dream
I wait when my time will come
Since all times
I am here
Chained
To life
Only the death can
Bring deliverance
No one else knows the calm
I am true, pure
So dark
That a living can't see
So cold
That living can't even know
About me
A dream that we dream
A life that is eternal captivity
A death  that delivers
And now I am dancing as shadow
Coming from the dusk
Now i am here again
Purely and truly
I remember again
Not buried already
Deep in body
A dream that we dream
A life that is eternal captivity.
