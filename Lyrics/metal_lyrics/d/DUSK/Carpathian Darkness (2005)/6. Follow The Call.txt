The forests are calling me
To leave this world
And to return
To walk in vast forests again
An once...
My soul stravaiging in the black forest
Far from all life
Where no one can see it
Far from this world
In cold and darkness
That is enlightmenting
And desires
That are calling far away
Now they are covering me together with the fog
The silence of the night is howling beside me
Voices that are calling through all time
Now they are followed forever...
