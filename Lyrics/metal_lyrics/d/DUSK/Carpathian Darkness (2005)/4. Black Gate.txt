Fire and ashes covering everything
That was seen by my eyes once
Song of fire flies far
In an endless forst
The picture of a memory
Holds back ages and forgetting
But it guards the ancient empire
Heights as a gate
And defends of entering
The black gate
Where those may enter
Who belong there
A gate that defends
Of all life
A gate of darkness and death
A place to rest
A gate that defends
Of all light
That may burn us.

A darkness infinite
A pain infinite
Eternity
That doesn't let us die
A real world
Lived by not many
Black gate
Thou art locked before me
I am screaming in the night
With the dark purity of my soul
And my immortal words
The call of another word
Opens up
The memory of another age
Calls again...
And the black gate locks
Behind me...
To return to
A forgotten age and place...
