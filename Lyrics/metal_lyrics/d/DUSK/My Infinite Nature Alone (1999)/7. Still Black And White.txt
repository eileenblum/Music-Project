[March 1998]

Remember...
Return...
Reverse...
Realize...
Remember me, as fading images.
Return to me, some other day.
Reverse the faces, of the pages pale.
Realize, how the seasons change.
How faultless are you and me, in our shadow one.
As merged forever, by a blinding light.
Respect the grace that we unleash together.
And O how beautiful is my art.
As pale as you can think, as close as we may be.
Relate to all the times,
The memories are still black and white...
...black and white, purple gray.
And how much more pale will you become?
Am I not faded enough for you?
Realize, how the seasons change.
Reverse the faces, of the pages pale.
Return to me, some other day.
Remember me, as fading images.
I might just wait another season for you,
The memories are still, black and white.
