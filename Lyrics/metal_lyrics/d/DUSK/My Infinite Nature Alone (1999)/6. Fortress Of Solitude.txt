[January 1997]

Alone again.
Again I am desolate. Again I am left forever.
Again I weep in pain.
O it's my sigh.
It is the sigh I take again.
Will this survive? Survive to see the daylight.
Never shall I.
Never shall I again, see the sight of the ones,
The ones who once left me behind.
Fortress. Of solitude.
Let us merge together.
In Solitude. For solitude, in solitude.
My character is now a tragedy.
A tragedy forever to be.
My existence is now a strain.
Slowly it arises, the urge.
An urge to fly away, into the skies of silence.
Amber roads, going places, emptiness is just a dream.
Echoes saying everything fill within.
As cold winds rape a lonely tree.
And here I sit in somberness.
Draped in a thick mist called thought.
And grasping me, and my imagination,
Are these everlasting chains of despair?
And black clouds of sadness, hang over the fortress.
Waiting for me to again be free.
So that they can rain their tragedy, all over the years.
And O how I wish, that I could, I will,
Embrace these skies if time wishes me to.
Never again.
And the pain persists me.
Shall I pay for all I have?
Pay for what all was not mine.
Indebt me in sorrow.
Solitude stays, for it is a temple, a temple forever.
Never shall we be loved.
And amongst the many thoughts, the thoughts that became pregnant.
A question will always arise.
Fortress. Of solitude.
Let us merge together.
In Solitude. For solitude, in solitude

I can feel my self to be descanting,
Descanting my soul to rise.
To be seen inside of me, is merely a thought of thee.
A vivid expression is seen,
And the broken promise shall be.
Amber roads, going places, emptiness is just a dream.
Echoes saying everything fill within.
As cold winds rape a lonely tree.
