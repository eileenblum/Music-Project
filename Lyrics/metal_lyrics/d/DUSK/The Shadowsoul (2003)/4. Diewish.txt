A Strong wish for a hug
For it's touch, for It's Feeling
To feel It
An eternal wish for the death

Death!Death!Death!
Death!Death!Death!
Death!Death!Death!

To feel It by pure heart
To wish It with thousand souls
To Scream for It thousand and thousand of times
Feel It's throbbling, feel It's rattle
Feel It by pure heart
Die for it
And It's also waiting for me
Feel It, the Death
And leave a lying world
Only It is clean
And only It can rescue me
And It is the

Death!Death!Death!
Death!Death!Death!
Death!Death!Death!

Thousand screams and thousand drops of blood
Thousand screams and thousand drops of tears
Like stabbing pain
The fire is burning inside of me
A wish after It....

Death!Death!Death!
Death!Death!Death!
Death!Death!Death!
