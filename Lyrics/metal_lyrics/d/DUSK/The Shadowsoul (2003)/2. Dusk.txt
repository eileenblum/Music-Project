Bluish fire in a circle
Shadows are swishing around it
It's glowing but still
It's so cold
That the air wraps up
In fog
The body shivers
Under the weight of the soul
As if an eternity
Is starting to break
The memories return slowly
The future's and the past's
The phantasm of the body
Slowly falls down
From a dark soul's power
The shadows are swishing increasingly
In the mist
The memorie of the past
The pictures of the future
In eternal pain
In eternal domnation
I'm tormented by life
But the time will come
when the shadow leaves the body
And it's life ends
Reaching there where already
It's one with the dark night
One with the freezing winds
One with the death
One with the end.........
