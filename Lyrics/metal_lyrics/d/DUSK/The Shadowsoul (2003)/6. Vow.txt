The dust of the infinite times burries me
In a forgotten grave
Chained with time and eternal life
For such a long time
Alone in an infinitely cold
And almost completetly dark
The thousand year-old wrinkles on my face
And the tears dryed up long ago
Are being burried by the dust of an eternity
Till somebody opens the grave on a night
Finding the chained in the past
Ancient dark soul of mine
Blowing away the dust from me
And from the weapons laying at my side
The war starts again
So it had never ended
And the face gleaming on my sword
Is the one's who freed me
Such a familiar face...
This is my face...
I freed myself
Just as I vowed a thousand years ago
I came to pull down the gates...
