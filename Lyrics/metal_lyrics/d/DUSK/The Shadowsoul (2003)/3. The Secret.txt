To leave the path of life
And find a new one
To an unknown, frosty place
A hideaway of an eternal secret
We are inside the secret
And we are in these places invisible
An existence for ever
A pain never ceasing
A thausand teardrops of the night
Like a scream for emptiness
We come forth from our graves
By the frosty winds
By the dense fog
By the infinite darkness
And scream for ourselves
Searching for the secret
We arrive at an almost dead place
Finding the answer
In the endless pain
The answer is the place itself
Walls are getting dim
As we stare at the writing
On the fading walls
How could we die
When we don't live?
An existence for ever
A pain never ceasing
Darkness is open before us
Yet seeking is not over
Continuality
Life eternal
Torture endless
Pain eternal
Search endless
