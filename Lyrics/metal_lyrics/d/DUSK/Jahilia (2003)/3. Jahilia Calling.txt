In the name of - The splendid heights
That echo the pleasures - Unforeseen
Dead notions live - In the corner where we shared the kiss
Recollect all the pages torn - Along the shores of the weeping oceans
Oceans - Notions - Emotions - Recollect - Re fragment
Comprehend - the scarlet fever again
Memories unfold - The nacht symphony sings
Jahilia calling
All there ever was to black and white
Our street lamp sorrow - Along with our shadows - Obtuse
