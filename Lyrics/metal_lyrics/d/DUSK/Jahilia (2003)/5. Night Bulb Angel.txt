Passing hours of the day immortal
Bring the truth about the sun
Expand your kingdom of pain
Bring me electric pleasures
Tungsten dreams - Filament disdain
Black voids that you still embrace
Tragedy - Black comedy, I am your Night Bulb Angel
Coming to a theatre near you, I am your Night Bulb Angel
Your light is dimmer than you
Am I too pale pink for you?
Expand your kingdom of pain
Give me electric pleasures
Tungsten dreams - Filament disdain
Black voids that you still embrace
Electric pleasures for you and for me, I am your Night Bulb Angel
The bleeding tears after eight, I am your Night Bulb Angel
Explain your architecture strange
You the dreamscape of the night
Your eyes surround me
Like voids of black truth - Embalmed in pain
