Let the light pass through - let the fluids bleach
Mind - Body - Rapture - State of the art
A tender touch would be hard to find
A warm embrace would never matter
You rejoice in false passion
And your spirits over turn
Decadent Little Girl - Let the light pass through
Head lights burning bright - the final destination
Those eyes keep staring
As frozen emotions would ventilate
Decadent Little Girl - Overturn
