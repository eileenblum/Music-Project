Every Morning - I close the window
Making all that is instrumental - dysfunctional
And thinking that life would pass - In this fashion ever decedent
Surrounding images change form
Black and white fever reveals itself
The trees - the symphony - the slumber
Passing hours devoid of all time-lapse
Would I ever know - Or should you realize?
That this passing moment - I am dying again
