Amongst the shades of substance
In the permanence of character
Your demons, your Angels
Of worlds within words - Is there no tomorrow?
The subdued light - No dreams in sight
The subdued light - No dreams no light
An element of misfortune
As history has within itself
Their zero tolerance is -
An attempt at the unknown
The subdued light - No dreams in sight
The subdued light - No dreams no light
