Black fog is ascending from the depths
The air becomes frozen
Distant painful screams
That cut deep into my flesh

Into his sacrifice
The key that cuts into the gate
That opens it for eternal times
By the secret of the black fog

Ancient secrets reveal
Written by blood and pain
They are burning in fire and hatred
Written by blood into the flash in a circle of fire

As you pray for the ancient curse
Black fog is ascending from the depths
and the air becomes frozen
and His voice penetrates everything

And when you whisper his name
He whispers you ancient secrets
Mysteries reveal
and illusions collapse

As you pray for the ancient curse
Black fog ascends from the depths
and the air freezes
and His voice penetrates everything

He is returning by the bloodwritten secrets
Into the remembrance where all the gates open
The words are glowing in fire
and His voice penetrates everything
