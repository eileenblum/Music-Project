Dim memories from the past
He is followed since all times
All is just for Him
All the rituals, and sacrifices

A voice that is so distant
A silent whisper from far away
Silent, and still so penetrating
Distant, and still so close

That whispers where to go
Like open pages of a book

Where the blood screams His words
And the rituals are followed

The rituals are followed since all times
Each drop of blood flow only for Him
All death and life, that was and that will be
Was only for Him, and will be only for Him

The pure, true steps into the darkness
All bring more and more darker depths
More and more closer to Him
More and more louder His name that is screamed

And the voice is so close now
And the whishper is so loud
The sorcery of words penetrates me
Fulfilling with destructive force

Words of the ritual are heard
Bloody words of the open book are heard
And rituals are followed for eternal times
And each drop of blood flow for Him
