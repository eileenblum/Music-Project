I'm looking for Him in the night
in dreary, dead places
There where the screams of suffering
Fulfill me with relief
I'm praying for Him every moment
and He is sometimes there in the obscurity
Watching me from over there
and whispering to me

The fog and Dark calls You forth,
from the dark depths
and You embrace the living
Bringing fear to them,
in a form of a dark presage beyond one's depth
The one who beholds You becomes demented
and trapped between two worlds
You are indescribable
but still they often talk about You 
You are the creatures of the night,
having numerous faces
but with one voice
that whispers at night, ... with the freezing fog
that brings fears, and suffering...

I feel Him, as an ancient agony
which penetrates me, and chills me
I hear Him from so far away
and so close at once
Forasmuch He is there in the dark
Forasmuch He has always been there
and the black depths open up,
after searching for so long...

He haunts me forever, whispering in the dark
Through gates his whisper reaches the living
And this voice drives to madness those who behold him in the dark
A pain beyond one's depth in the eternal darkness

He is the aim, there in the darkness
Lurking behind everything
Unreachable, still He is here in front of me
Elusive, still He embraces me
He is the one I'm looking for eternally
He is the aim, He is the end
