His voice is the only I hear!
His will is the only that counts!

He stands upon all things
And He speaks against everything
He is the clearest voice
when noone can hear
He is the way before us
when noone can see
Something that is darker than darkness
That is more than anything

I sacrifice thousand lives for Him
I sacrifice thousand souls at His altar!
And so many blood I flow for His will
And so many screams full of pain, all for him

He is the clearest voice
when noone hears
He is the way infront of us
when noone sees

His voice is the only I hear!
His will is the only that counts!

"Behold... I unveil my will
And look, I reveal my realm
Look, thou can see my hatred
Behold! I reveal my power
I give thee eyes to see with
and ears to hear with
I give thee strength to fight
and all I want is a wound in your heart
Alas! eternal anguish burns thee
as I share my wound with thee...
Sacrifice everything for me
And I share everything with thee
Flow thy blood for me
and feel the deepest hatred of mine"

His voice is the only I hear!
His will is the only that counts!

He is the most honest hatred
He is the purest evil
He is the strongest will
He is the darkest shadow
He is the clearest voice
He is the way and the end
He is the death, and
He is the deliverance

His voice is the only I hear!
His will is the only that counts!
