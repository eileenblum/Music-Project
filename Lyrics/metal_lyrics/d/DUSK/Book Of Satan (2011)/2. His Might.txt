I  know you watch over me
You keep your eye on my way
You hauntingly whisper to my ear
You help me see the truth

You show me the way to You
Which I aspire to follow more than anything else
You show me the way to understanding
Which is searing my mind
You show me the way into the darkness
Which is my way
You show me the way to myself
To my dark self

I know You watch my steps
And I follow Your words!
I know You help my way
And I follow Your will!

I know Your might...
And Your will is my will
I know where You are...
And this is where I head for

Each time I feel You're close,
I get closer and closer to fulfillment
Each time I see You behind the universe
I see myself clearer and clearer

I get more and more pure and utter
More and more veils fall off my eyes
More and more  I remember that what had once been
More and more I become what I am

I know you watch my steps
And I follow Your words!
I know where you are...
And this is where I head for

I am only for You
I am the will
I am only for You
I am Your will
