Leaving everything behind
There, in the distance
In an other world
Enchanted with an illusion
Giving up everything that kept me restrained
Thrown away and left behind all the chains
Uncountable words towards Him
By which I have spoken my oath
And by which I followed Him
His voice in the distance
His word inside me
His Darkness, somewhere
In an unexplicable place
All that showed me the way
All that whispered inside me
An ancient oath
That blaze up in my mind
And burnt down everything
All the words, uncountable
Are all the steps behind me
That scorched the past
And all the chains which kept me bound
Behind me flames dart up 
And obscurity forge ahead
Flames destroying everything
Nothing can stand against them
And all those uncountable words by which I called Him
By which I summoned Him
Are all inside of me now
Reached its goal...
