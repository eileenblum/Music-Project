On endless dreary roads
On the land of dreams
Unimaginable darkness covers everything
And descends at nights with the fog
From the mountain forests full of secrets
And the valleys are being covered
By an ancient dark power
That has been here always
And at nights shadows and dark souls
Descend in the valleys
With the cold Transylvanian breezes
Which are so freezing
That even the fire freezes
The cold permeates into the souls
And it brings a scream
From the surrounding mountains
And from their endless dark forests
An ancient curse descends
With the cold Transylvanian breezes
I am at home there
I feel the call
I'm one with the dark curse
Which covers the Carpathians 
I am the coldest breeze of Transylvania...
