In the dark forest of the Carpathians
The shadows of the night
Have been whispering a story since the ancient times
On each full moon night
At such times even the trees are whispering and rustling
From the Carpathians' mist
It grows together with the dark forests
Their ancient power is covering
This gloomy land until all times
A spirit born
To lead the shadows
Through endless roads, which are even thicker
Than Transylvania's most darkest forests
The one who will break the curse of eternity
Will bring twilight upon the day
Will bring curse upon the blessing
And a blessing upon the curses
One will take the living into death
And the shadows will slide away
With the wind of passing
It echoes as an immortal curse
In the deep of all life
Sparks of fear
Flame as great blazes
One will open the worlds' gates
And know the death's gate
One will lead the world into dusk
Will lead the dusk into death
The death to nothing...
