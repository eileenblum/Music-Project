On a freezing and distant land
Under the sign of darkness
With dead soul
And freed by the death
A diabolical shadow appeared in the fog
He brought salvation of the rot and death
From a forgotten age and place
Touched by the death
The one who exceeded the roads of life
He showed other worlds 
He wished other worlds
He never walked on human roads
He is dead
Someone who was here not as a human
He is dead
who brought darkness and damnation from the hell
Dead is the Black Metal...
Dead is the Black Metal...
