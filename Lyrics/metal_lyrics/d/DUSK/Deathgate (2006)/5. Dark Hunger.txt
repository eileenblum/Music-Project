Sateless hunger obsesses me
A voice that keeps on calling
Dark hunger of my freezing soul
An endless hunger
For a total darkness
For a total death
As cold as the wish for death
And so hungry in a stranger life
Walking in abandoned freezing forests
And appease my soul's scream
The grey Transylvanian sky above
Frozen rain on my face
I'm the immortal hunger
An eternal searching
For a total darkness
For a total death
And so hungry in a stranger life
I'm the immortal hunger
An eternal searching
For a total darkness
For a total death
A scream in  the silence
Eternal deathwish
