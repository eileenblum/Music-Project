Everything is ablazed around me
My body ashes in the eternity
And now everything is so familiar
Now everything is blazing because I'm dying
No sound, no shape
Nothing exists that is not eternal
An infinite walk among the blazes and ashes
So deeply outside of life
So far in the infinite death
The blazes are flashing everywhere
Still everything is so frosty
That thousands of souls are frozen everywhere
When everything is so pure
In pure pain
In eternal suffering
An eternity's curse
In infinite dead space
Lost is all hope
That once was blazing as a fire
Every living thing is given up
That once was fighting
That once lived
Now everything is so dead
Now everything is so cold
Desolated and empty
Infinite Death
At the gate of deliverance...
