I woke up at a dark and cold place
It is narrow and the air is damp
Smells of the dead spreads in the smothery air
I'm in a bin
I'm dead, smelling my reek
Deeply under the ground, far from the livings
We are dead in the world of the livings
We are dead, however we are awake
Digging myself I behold
The red hot full moon
I take cognizance of my arrive
To the world of livings with a long screaming
My body is putrefaction, my soul is destruction
I flew down by a war chariot
From the sky of the black night
I hear the screaming of my brothers in my soul
We are here again to fulfill the whispers of our soul
My recollections remembers me to my frozen death in my blood
We left the life in each other's arms for perpetuity
We got each other's arms to eternity
For the riddance
