Bloody tears falls from the dried eyes
Falls into the cold waters like the leaded drops
Infinitely cold soul
An infinitely cold water
Every weigh of blood drops tears the calm surface
Making waves and deeply tears to its bottom
In this so dark and so cold water
Every waves and ripples are one and one screaming
One and one screaming for the riddance
One and one screaming for the death
An infinitely cold soul
An infinitely cold water
This lead weighed blood tears gathers on the bottom of the water
The eyes are so dries
Doesn't dropping anything from those already
Maybe the water is filling with tears slowly
It is already full, because it makes an isle
An isle of the last pain
Where it can rest
Because the cold water is slowly drying up
Don't leaving anything but the wounds of the bottom of the dried channel
