A quiet scream slashing into the fictitious silence
My frosty scream
Am I still alive?
Or I'm already dead?
I feel still too much things
But less then I can be alive
Endless birth and life
It was take on me one and one thousand wounds
Every breath fissures into my spirit
An other frosty screaming
Blood splashing from my mouth
Bleeding from thousand and thousand wounds
In the dungeon of the eternity
I'm already not alive for a long time
But I'm not dead yet
I'm dying
Searching for the riddance
My bloody body and bloodier soul
It is slowly get chill
I'm getting nearer to be dead
Maybe it's the last frosty screaming
