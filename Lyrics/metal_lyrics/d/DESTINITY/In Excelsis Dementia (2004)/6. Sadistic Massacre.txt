Mutilate their sacred land.
Desecrate their sadistic evil God.

[Refrain]

Dismember their bleeding organs
To drain their dirty contagious blood...

Endure my eternal pain
Of my eternal sufferings.
The end is near !
The unknown future slowly rolls to war...

The human's fles will be
The only offering to gods of hate
To forgive sins of humanity

Arise Gods of war !!!

Arise Gods of war demons of death.
Kill the sacred path Kill them all.
Arise Gods of war Demons of death
Feel the pain as the Cold blood drained...

[Refrain]

You were his fuckin' sad slave.
Now you will be your own God.

You became the crown fire which planne
On the earth.
You became the frozen wind which planne
Between tombs.
