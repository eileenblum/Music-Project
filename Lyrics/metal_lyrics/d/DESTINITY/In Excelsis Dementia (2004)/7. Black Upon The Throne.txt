I saw myself lengtened on throny floor.
My blood springs out of my heart - I'm laughing.
My eyes are opened and I'm dead.
So much lies so much pain.
I realize all things I did by past.
It's all hypocrisy like the smile of
A child betrayed by lies.
Innocence stolen by fear, look what I became...

Burning through the blackfires of my spirit
I feel death invading my rotten bowels.
Burning through the blackfires of my spirit
I saw the desecration of JESUS CHRIST !!!

Towards human's heaven I did aspire.
Towards human's heaven I did reject.
They forgot the manipulation of God !
Go abandon your hopes and die in pain
With your misbelief...

Are you the creator of this sad hate ?
Now we have your evil inside.
Are you the creator of this sad hate ?
Now we are sons of the hate and revenge...

Till the day you will be six feet under like my soul.
Your death will be the price to pay for my lost innocence.
