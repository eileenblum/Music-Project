In my world, despite everyone thinks they know me,
I'm just the only one standing
In my way, even if I've faced the hardest days,
I'll be the same, and I'll do it again

A vision of a cold sky
A landscape painted in black

In my world, they stand up for things
Said behind my back
In my world, there's no time for hypocrisy,
No time for all that you need

One day, all weaknesses gone
I'll laugh out at you
Living my way, living for myself
One day, you'll crawl into my world

(Under my feet)
Go!

I won't be your brother, and I won't be your friend;
I'm just the only one you hear
I'll stay the landscape that reflects your dreams
I'm just the only one you fear

Ugh!

In my world, despite everyone thinks they know me
In my world, every friend is a future enemy

I'm not your guide, you're not my guest
I don't want to be what you want to see (what you want to see)

One day, all weaknesses gone
I'll laugh out at you
Living my way, living for myself
One day, you'll crawl into my world

One day, you'll crawl into my world
