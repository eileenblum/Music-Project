One night, I woke up and screamed, I looked behind my back
A cold disease caught me
I tried to imagine the next day
Nothingness called my name

I thought I'd been loved and protected;
I was wrong; I'm alone

Nothingness called my name

I believed I was stronger, but the truth caught me up
I have to fight alone
Born alone, die alone
These are real verses

Reap my scars
My only victory
Is to live my lifestyle only for myself

I thought I'd been loved and protected;
I was wrong; I'm alone

I spilled these tears for nothing
I believed it was just a dream,
A holy dream that you offered me
A stolen life that you granted me
I spilled these tears for nothing
I believed it was just a dream

[Guitar solo]

One night, I woke up and screamed, I looked behind my back
A cold disease caught me
I tried to imagine the next day
Nothingness called my name

I thought I'd been loved and protected;
I was wrong; I'm alone

A lifeless pawn is what I left behind
Belated wisdom now flowing through my mind
A strong resolve and focus in my sight
Will bring me further, and smash all in my wake (wake)

[Guitar solo]

I spilled these tears for nothing
I believed it was just a dream,
A holy dream that you offered me
A stolen life that you granted me
I spilled these tears for nothing
I believed it was just a dream
