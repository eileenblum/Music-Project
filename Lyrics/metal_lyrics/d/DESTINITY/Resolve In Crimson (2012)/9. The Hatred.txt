I am the hatred (hatred)

Behold my anthem raging in your lifeless soul
A call for war against all my foes
Above the week, I try to seek redemption in a pure form
These words â I speak the truth and nothing more

I don't care about your state of mind
I don't care about you â drown in your own pain

You can't break me;
I'm in command
You can't break me,
So get down on your knees

Burning hatred, it compels me
To discard all I can't stand or see
Can't disown me â my masterplan
You're just a cog in my machine

Behold: my pride is piercing through the gloryhole
No more to score, you fucking crack-whore
I judge you on your lack of will â a maggot with a blank skull
My eyes, they see right through your empty core

You can't break me;
I'm in command
You can't break me,
So get down on your knees

Burning hatred, it compels me
To discard all I can't stand or see
Can't disown me â my masterplan
You're just a cog in my machine

Burning hatred, it compels me
To discard all I can't stand or see
Can't disown me â my masterplan
You're just a cog in my machine
