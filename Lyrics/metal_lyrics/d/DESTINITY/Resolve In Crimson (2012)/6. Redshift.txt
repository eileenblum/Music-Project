Did you ever feel this running hate?
Did you ever dream of killing like me?
It spreads throughout your body
As fast as the plague

Victim of my subconscious murderer
I was afraid of my dreams
Revenge hidden by the red of blood
Have you ever lived a redshift?

It was just too much for me
Long was the night filled with fear

My night inspired by his blood
My dream inspired by his fear
My life inspired by this dream
His life is now my redshift

Go!

[Guitar solo]

Have you ever seen through your victim?
Open your eyes, and watch his life of shit
He speaks only of me
'Cause jealousy makes him crazy

This is my redshift (-shift)
This is my redshift

In the end, you'll have to pay,
But patience guides my way
Until at last comes the day
When my hellish plan unveils

I was starting to enjoy this
Long was the day full of waiting

My night inspired by his blood
My dream inspired by his fear
My life inspired by this dream
His life is now my redshift (-shift)
