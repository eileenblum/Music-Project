I'll show you I'm worth more than you
And your pity
So give me a chance to hate me
So give me a chance to kill me

I present you my soil
The picture of the hatred - a mind fucked by the souls
Incoming flash of wisdom
Inspired by the traitors, the wretched scum I loathe

A black sun rises from the east,
Shining a crimson light onto my enemies
At last, I see with clarity
Who keeps on living, and who will cease to be

Stand on your own, stab me in the back,
âCause I won't miss my despised enemies
Face to face and flesh to dust
For you, I'd be the one you want to be

Stand on your own
Stand on your own - your haunted memory

[Guitar solo]

I present you my soil
The picture of the hatred - a mind fucked by the souls
Incoming flash of wisdom
Inspired by the traitors, the wretched scum I loathe

A black sun rises from the east,
Shining a crimson light onto my enemies
At last, I see with clarity
Who keeps on living, and who will cease to be

A black sun rises from the east,
Shining a crimson light onto my enemies
At last, I see with clarity
Who keeps on living, and who will cease to be

(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Shining a crimson light onto my enemies
