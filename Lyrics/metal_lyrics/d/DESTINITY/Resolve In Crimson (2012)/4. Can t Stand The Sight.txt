You have to believe me, and try to follow me
Have you ever dreamed of killing?
Your mind needs to be free and see its suffering
Have you ever dreamed of bleeding?

You need to see, like me, the honesty
I can't stand the sight of you â uh!

I had to kill you more than a hundred times
I was afraid of myself when I woke up
I thought about it, and understood my murderous hatred

Can't stand the sight of you
You make me so sick
Can't stand the sight of you
A smell lies in your breath

[Guitar solo]

There was no turning back
Acid was flowing into my veins

There was no turning back
Acid was flowing into my veins

My hate teaches me happiness in life
Learning not to waste time with my fucking hate

You have to believe me, and try to follow me
Have you ever dreamed of killing?
Your mind needs to be free and see its suffering
Have you ever dreamed of bleeding?

You need to see, like me, the honesty
I can't stand the sight of you â uh!

Where you failed, I won hate
I won hate, I won hate itself
(2x)

Can't stand the sight of you
You make me so sick
Can't stand the sight of you
A smell lies in your breath

You have to believe me
I'm the demon inside you
Where you failed, I won
Proud to be your role model
I'm watching you inhaling this hate
You have to believe me
I'm the poison inside you
Where you failed, I won
Proud to be your role model
I'm watching you inhaling this hate

Where you failed, I won hate
I won hate, I won hate itself

Where you failed, I won hate
I won hate, I won hate itself

Can't stand the sight of you
You make me so sick
Can't stand the sight of you
A smell lies in your breath

Can't stand the sight of you
You make me so sick
Can't stand the sight of you
A smell lies in your breath
