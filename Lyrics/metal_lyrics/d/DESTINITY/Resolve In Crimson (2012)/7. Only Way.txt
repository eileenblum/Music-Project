Try to stop this search of hate
Seek revenge is but too late
I expect nothing from you;
I just want to let you know the truth

There's no hope for the human race
Nothing's left in this portrait
Before late, we'll have to pay
For the price of human's own decay

Every day, I feel this pain
I wish that every step I take
Was on the face of the human race,
'Cause this is my only way

Demons taking control
Over our heads from below
They won't leave until I'm dead,
'Til insanity eats my soul (soul)

Never said I'm above you
Spineless sucker, that's the truth
Never mind if you will sue
I stay true to my word and my crew

Every day, I feel this pain
I wish that every step I take
Was on the face of the human race,
'Cause this is my only way,

'Cause this is my only way,
'Cause this is my only way (way)
