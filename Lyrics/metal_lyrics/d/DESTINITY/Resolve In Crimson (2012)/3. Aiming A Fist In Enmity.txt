And it all started with a dark reflection
Reality started to rot my vision
Never stopping to think, never stopping to fight
I couldn't see the world around me

Fight the enemies, strike the traitors
Fight the enemies, strike the traitors

Ugh!
Fight with no mercy to be free,
The only way to victory

We won't be slaves of memories
Aiming a fist in enmity

[Guitar solo]

Fight the enemies, strike the traitors
Fight the enemies, strike the traitors

Fight with no mercy to be free,
The only way to victory

We won't be slaves of memories - aiming a fist in enmity
Aiming a fist in enmity

The only way to rule is
To be like me: what you want to be
Your blazing soul and your raised fists
Are your weapons to be free

Craving a state of peace of mind
I'll have to shout above the crowd
To spread my message

We won't be slaves of memories - aiming a fist in enmity
Aiming a fist in enmity
Aiming a fist in enmity
(In enmity, in enmity)
