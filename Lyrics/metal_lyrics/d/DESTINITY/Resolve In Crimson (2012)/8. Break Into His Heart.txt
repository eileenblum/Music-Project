He felt their eyes burn his body
He heard their discrete mockeries
He lived like a martyr at the stake,
But he understood that revenge will rise

His fantasy became to see them all dead
He suffered and fought to become,

To become
A friendly, admired person,
To become
A respected person

He felt like shit and paralyzed
He felt numb and cold as the ice,
But his heart was filled with flames of revenge
Victory had always slept inside

He ended up taking a grip
On his destiny
He fought and started to be
As an enemy

Now, they must pull out their eyes
Now, they should feel hearts of ice
He changed his life for the freaks,
But from now, he's no longer weak

Eghh!

Break into his heart
Break into his heart
It was a hidden secret to endure,
An experience never to doubt (to doubt)

Life is surprising at times,
'Cause he smiles with the same strong arms
He's the one they love and crave,
The one they want to kill, but claim

But the break has been done,
And the weakness is dead

Now, they must pull out their eyes
Now, they should feel hearts of ice
He changed his life for the freaks,
But from now, he's no longer weak

[Guitar solo]

Break into his heart
Break into his heart
Break into his heart
Break into his heart
