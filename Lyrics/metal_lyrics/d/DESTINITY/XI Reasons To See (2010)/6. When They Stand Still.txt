Run before them, fucker, run if you can!
Run like the hell was over your ass!
How long you think your fate will wait?
For you to choose, to leave or to take
Leave or take!

Go straight or not, as long as you burn fast
Your moment won't never come!!!

All your fear won't disappear
All the lies won't become clear
All the moments lost are no more here you better run!!!
All your fear won't disappear
All the lies won't become clear
All the moments lost are no more here and never turn!!!

You can see in their hands the blood is running cold
You can feel it when they stand still!

Run for yourself, better run to be safe
Never fucking turn, turn back again
How long you think your fate will wait?
For you to choose that you must take!!!

They will step on to you!
They will step on to you!
They won't never let you!
If you became their due!!
