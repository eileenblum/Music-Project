And evil began to spread through his body
One by one, paralysing each muscles
And reduced to be a prisoner of his own body
Memories was replaced by a vision of horror

Witness in sorrow!

Don't promise to keep your faith
To keep your life!
And never say goodbye!

The evil's eyes of life is more powerful
Than you can imagine...
Like a train far away in the dark mist
He was trapped and forced to see

The life broke his wings
And make him tumble down!
Despite his vision that could change
He could see those who love him

Through this tragedy he understood
The meaning of life...

Witness in sorrow...
