This empty shell cares no longer for life
Slowly replacing the flesh with steel
No one can tell you there what is wrong
No one knows where your heart belongs...

No truth has been issued from a mask that you betrayed...
Forever betrayed and forever slaved
A catatonic hibernation of your mind

This is the negative eyes factory!
This is the negative eyes control!
You turn away all senses of guilt!

A fuckin' slaved control!

A malignant grin on the face of sin
The sense of horror in your vicious eyes
The scent of Inner Fear fills your new face made by the fear
The scent of your witness fills your new dark way to believe

No truth has been issued from a mask that you betrayed...
Forever betrayed and forever slaved
A catatonic hibernation of your mind

Negative eyes control!
