Enter my world please take my hand
Don't feel my cold black inside
Enter my dreams please feel my hopes
Don't feel this thirst of revenge!

May this silence be a new beginning
and try to live again and again...

Taking her last breath to the winds outside
You were in her thoughts and she believed you'll touch the ground...

I know you try to find a way
deep into your dreams and into your fear
Try to flee from the dark reality
Please remain strong and accept this path

Taking her last breath to the winds outside
You were in her thoughts and she believed you'll touch the ground...

She wants you better, cherishing the life
You can still feel the sand flowing between your fingers...
Don't forget to touch the ground to believe you are alive
Touch the ground before you will be six feet under this fuckin' ground!

Taking her last breath to the winds outside
You were in her thoughts and she believed you'll touch the ground...
To touch the ground!!!
