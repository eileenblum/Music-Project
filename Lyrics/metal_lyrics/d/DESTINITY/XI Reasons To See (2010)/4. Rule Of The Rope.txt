You can't stand, stand anymore, the weight on your shoulders
Bored the throw away dices and never get the aces
Trying to get higher, increasing the fall to come
Won't you find the way back home?

Put your head through the thin string to the top
Hope you appreciate what you see
Lay your neck rest down, swallow dry, think again
Hope you won't regret!

You can't stand, stand anymore
Like you walk with fire
Bored the throw away dices and always get the ashes
Trying to feel better, waiting the fall to come
Don't you see the way back home?

Living each day with no master no rule
Just to find a way where you will feel safe
Playing a game with one fucking rule
Try to reach, try to breath but still millimeters left

You cross, cross the point, giving up its use to the rope
The moment when you realize all the means of your act
No more dice, no more chance to get higher nor better
The fall is like you want it, fast but too long, now fear it!!

Put your head through the thin string to the top
Hope you appreciate what you see
Lay your neck rest down, swallow dry, think again
Hope you won't regret!

Living each day with no master no rule...

Get ready for the thrill shaking your bones
Get ready to follow the light to your home

Living each day with no master no rule...
