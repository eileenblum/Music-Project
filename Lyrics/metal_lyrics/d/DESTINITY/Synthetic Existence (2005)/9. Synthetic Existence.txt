Condemnation could be revealed through centuries...
The past catched the future
of a miserable world of worms and cockroaches...
ready to be annihilated...

Synthetic existence...
Take away your life.
Synthetic existence...
In torture as you die...

Silence is hovering over the bleeding earth...
The past catched the future...

Apocalyptic visions wasn't in a psychotic context...
No more words needed, it is the final result of humanity.

Synthetic existence...

No more lies, no more pains, no more hate... [x2]
It is the last human's breath...
It is the last solution
of this humanist impact...

Apocalyptic visions wasn't in a psychotic context...
No more words needed, it is the final result of humanity.
Nobody can't decide the future of an entire planet...
The real problem with humanity was that it never observe itself from the outside...
