The circle of time is nearly completed
nearly destroyed...
The last day begins with on oppressive sunrise.
Mutations begin to celebrate the end,
To dominate...
Perfusions of death
penetrating all corpses...

And spread the new end...

Creating new shades of earth to dominate...
They have paralyzed all brains to dominate...
They created this dogma
to celebrate their death...

Deshumanized nature...
Human's hell nature...

Sacrifice the lives of weaks to dominate...
As the last sad existence burned on the holy fire...

Feel in your veins all the lies of earth...
for the glory of domination...

The circle of time...
