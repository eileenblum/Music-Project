I will never give you what you expect!
Because I never expect something from you!

My soul is crying again
and my inside is spreading pain...
Again and again...
My soul is flying away behind the line of life's way so I cannot stay!!!

I'm crossing an obscure world where the life without you is impossible!
What are you awaiting from me?
I'm waiting this answer in the suffer's silence.
Wish me the death... Wish me the death...

The thing I'll never feel...

I will never give you what you expect from me!

[Lead : Zephiros]

I'm crossing an obscure world
where the life without you is impossible.
What are you awaiting from me?
I'm waiting this answer in the suffer's silence.
WISH ME THE DEATH!!!
