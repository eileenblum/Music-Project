Don't you ever fell!!! This warm desire deep in you?
To break the bound to rule it all!
Rule your life, ruin their own, be the weapon!
Control your fate and use all your hate!

Dreams of blood, desire of flesh.
This inward attraction is more wicked than the hate you all fell.

Your murder's instinct just start to raise,

Don't you ever fell!!! the needs to face your enemy?
Fantasy could become reality...

Don't you ever feel the thrill?
Don't you ever fell the chill?
Don't you ever wanna kill somebody?

Don't you ever fuckin' fell it?

How important is your life, don't you ever asked it to yourself?
I'll bring you pain,
It's costing me hell but I am going to show you how!!!
I bring elevation to a murder within!!!

Thirst for blood's, appetite for flesh's
this inward rage is stronger than an about to kill army

Accept this clip and swallow my benediction
Lay down my feet and spread the wine of creation

I know you are a willing victim!
You know I am a murder within...
