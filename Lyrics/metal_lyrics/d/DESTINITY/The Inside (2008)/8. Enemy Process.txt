Look at your stupidity and your waste of time!
Ascension to our destiny is drawing near.
Taste the wrath of our words! My voice shall be heard.
Time has come for us to change! My voice will be hears...

See the new day dawning hears my words!
See the new day dawning hears our hate!
Look back on your shoulder, your shell is empty.
This is the enemy process!!!

Look deep in our eyes and see calm before the storm winds.

Look back on your shoulder, your shell is empty.
I feel the loose inside your eyes!
Look back on your shoulder, your shell is empty.
This is the enemy process!!!

We bring the truth and the doubt to your darkest fears...

Look at your cupidity and your bad liver!
Ascension to your destiny not be the same one as mine...

As long as you will spite, as long as you will write down my name in flames
Still hate will lead my hand!
I'll pay the price of ascension to destiny

We bring the hate
We bring jealousy to your stupid spirit...
No doubt in my existence!
No doubt in my head!
