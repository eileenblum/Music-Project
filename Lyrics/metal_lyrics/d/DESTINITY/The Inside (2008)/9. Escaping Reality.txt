[Clean guitar : Ponce]

Every time, every breath / Every  blow can be the last!
In your world the light is so scintillating / In my world there is an absence of light.
Can you see fashion outshines morality? Every time...
EgoÃ¯sm needs to dictates humanity. I need to stay alone in my own way.
Can you see this frustrated masse so unworthy?

Escaping reality... Keep the faith of what I believe.
Your legal lies and desperate cries are the shade of your ignorance!
Forced to be similar I don't want to be... I need to stay alone in my own way to believe in my destiny...
I am the evil son! I am the one with the darkened sun!
Future is rising in my mind! Future is rising in your mind!

[Lead : Ponce]

I am the evil son!
I am the one with darkened sun
