Black clouds embraces my soul.
Living the last days of evolution's end.
The angel returns to his grave with flames on his pestilent wings.

My dark life seems empty to you!
This world is a void so cold! Ready destroyed...
Awaiting the final salvation
I'm becoming each things I hate
I'm ready to leave...

Alone in the dark with sickness and lies.

I'm searching better days to take the power
Power dethroned / Power dethroned
I'm searching memories to stay alive
and love my life forever...

Night times has come
Another hunt has begun... [x2]

My dark life seems empty to you
This world is a void so cold
ready destroyed ... I am ready to leave...
Now I am ready to leave
Too much bitterness and hatred for a world not deserving me!
