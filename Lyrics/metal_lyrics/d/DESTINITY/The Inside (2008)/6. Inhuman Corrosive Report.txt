Inhuman corrosive report of the nuclear light...
Irreversible time created by the birth of ignorance

Opposition destroyed by a new world.
Opposition destroyed by the thirst of revenge and dictatorship.

Constant evolution, Cyber confrontation waiting alienation...

Fight for your pride! Do never lay down your bloody arms.
Fight for your life! Do never forget your existence...

Fight for your life...
Opposition... And never forget your...

Exhumed by your nation, world-wide disinfection
and no civilization...
Made by the dejection you accepted injections
to forget the rebellion.
I was the witness of our extermination!

[Lead : Zephiros]

Although the light has fill the sky
everything remains the same.
Human kind burns it's own eyes.
End of report! Nothing has change!
