Being afraid to see death in your eyes!
I preferred to live my memories.

Being afraid to see death in your eyes! Death in your mind!
I preferred to live my memories mother's fuckers...

Death! Death is all around you...
Breath! Every breath can be the last...

The mist has covered my eyes and whispers were in my ears.
The past has been sweep off yours and my hands.
But I still remember your name...

A fuckin' hopeless goodbye with no words no tears in my eyes.
I wasn't here to say goodbye but you know I was there!!!

I'm stuck here with a torn up soul can never be mended.

Breath! Every breath can be the last...
The mist has covered my eyes and whispers were in my ears.
Remember...

Never I will forget all that we lived.
Never I will forget what you informed me and what you made me build!

Remember!!!
