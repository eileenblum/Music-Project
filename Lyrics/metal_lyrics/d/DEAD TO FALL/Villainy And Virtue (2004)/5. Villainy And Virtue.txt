Villainy has many forms, but none so vile as virtue
The depth of your compassion is as shallow as your thoughts
As you claim the embrace of angels
Your intentions are too dark to speak
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing
You pretend to be part of the flock
And somehow you convinced us all
That you are something you're not
Those words and actions tear us all down
And you're not content 'til everyone around
Is with you in that hole you've dug by yourself
Die alone in that hole by yourself
This is where I draw the line
Sever all ties
With no regrets
