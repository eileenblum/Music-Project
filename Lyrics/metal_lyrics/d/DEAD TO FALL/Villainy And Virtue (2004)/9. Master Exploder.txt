Cursed by everyone I have known
Lost control, now I'm alone
I hate this about myself
That you asked forgiveness
And I watched you burn
When every one of your promises falters and fails
As I know they would
I turn my back and go it alone, alone
When it seems it can't get worse
Burn it down, build it back
I will never see things the way you do
I cannot entertain the possibility of forgiveness
There is no way I can just forgive and forget
And for that I will be condemned and...
