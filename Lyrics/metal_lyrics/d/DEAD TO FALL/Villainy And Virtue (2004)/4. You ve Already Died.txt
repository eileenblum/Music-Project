Holding on to the past, while the future slips you by
The past, like the present, is just another lie
This is the only chance we will ever get
So make the most of it, live live with no regrets
Live life while you can, or life will pass you by
If you've already given in, then you've already died
You've already died
No turning back
No giving in
