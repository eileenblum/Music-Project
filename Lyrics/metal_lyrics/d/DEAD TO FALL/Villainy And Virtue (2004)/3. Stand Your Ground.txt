I know I'll never be good enough
And I don't care 'cause I'm never giving up
How does it feel when you can't hold your own?
How does it feel when desperation has left you alone?
It feels as if this burden is all I've ever known
And the weight pushing down on me continues to grow
I've live my life on my own terms
Gaining ground from everything I've learned
This is where we bury all that drags us down
This is where we break free to stand on our own ground
