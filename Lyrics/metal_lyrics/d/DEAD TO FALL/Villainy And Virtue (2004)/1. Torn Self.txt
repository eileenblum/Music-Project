Every one of us is lost against ourselves,
And pushing through the constant struggle of forward thought
This thing we call humanity
Has brought us down, and has us caught
Is this what I've become? A callous, uncaring soul
That allows the will of flesh to dominate and control
This is my counter attack
Starve the self, and empower the soul
This path I chose, once again made whole
Torn between self and soul
With first step forward
I've become a new creation
Free from self and thinking clearly
My soul chokes the last impurities from my flesh
And I'm given a second chance... but this time
I let myself die
