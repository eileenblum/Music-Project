The hands of time are frozen in this moment
I can't spit it out for fear
Has overtaken my voice
Waiting seems impossible
Different stages
Waiting seems predictable
Different ideas

It is I that will have to live with this
I, Betrayer of Hearts
I, Servant of Sorrow

Hear I am the worthless king
Join my legions of heartless
Here I am the worthless king
Join my legions of useless

Here I am the worthless king
Join my legions of heartless
Here I am the worthless king
Join my legions of useless

Wandering the great depths
Searching the canyons for truth
Discovering every darkness
Bringing its ugliness into new light
It's come down to this
All or nothing
Our Choice
Decide
Decide our suffering

It is I that will have to live with this
I, Betrayer of Hearts
I, Servant of Sorrow
