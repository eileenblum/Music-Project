Up and out
I never regretted a thing
Take a glance from the inside
It isn't what you think
This is it
This is everything I have
So between you and me
Give up all fucking hope
I've got the answer, so save your fucking explanation
This is the last time I'll suffer through your exploitation
Harvest truth and save it for your revelation
I've lost all trust and I've finally had the realization
All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fail you
Give up hope
I don't care and I'm through hearing you justify
You've given up and I know you've fucking died inside
We've burned it all and everything it signifies
I've reached my breaking point and I finally realize
All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fail you
Give up hope
I'm sick of trying and I'll never put my trust in you
No more heroes no promise of something new
It's over now
There's no more damage you can do
You're dead to me, because me and you are finally through
All my heroes have failed me and I have given up hope
This is the last time I ever place my trust in someone else
And I have given up all fucking hope
