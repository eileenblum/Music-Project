Cold hands feed us death
While war breeds in every breath
It seems like we have nothing left and our ways are set
The sacrifices we endure
Perfection we pursue
Darkness, nothing pouring through
Like Harkonen vision
All will fall before us and will will be made to suffer
Born Scream Confusion Pain Insanity
Reborn into this fleshen form
Forced through the portal of the womb
Fear is the mind killer
I'll face my fear and allow it to pass through me
Cold hands feed us death
While war breeds in every breath
It seems like we have nothing left and our ways are set
All will fall before us and all will be made to duffer
A vision of light
A survivor of death
Death Scream Confusion Pain Insanity
Return to the source where it all began
I can't make any sense of it
Not in the way you demand
Fear is the mind killer
I'll face my fear and allow it to pass through me
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion
A vision of light
A survivor of death
From far away not everything is perfect
