I saw the fire that once stirred in your heart
Become extinguished by good intentions and impressions
You made your choice and
now you wish you could go back
You made you choice and now you can't go back
Everyday you commit suicide
Destroying your self worth
I refuse to feel sympathy
for your life, of not caring
and bad decisions
Now you feel the pain
You have cast upon yourself
