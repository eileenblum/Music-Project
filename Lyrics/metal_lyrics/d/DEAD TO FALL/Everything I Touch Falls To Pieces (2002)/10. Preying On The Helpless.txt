You took everything in a single action
Caring only for your instant gratification
You smashed their world and took
Everything away
Preying on the helpless, children
The consequences are reaped for your actions
The seed of destruction is sown
and I don't care what you plan to accomplish
and I won't allow you to hurt anymore
Your days are numbered
Preying on their lives,
Preying on their souls
