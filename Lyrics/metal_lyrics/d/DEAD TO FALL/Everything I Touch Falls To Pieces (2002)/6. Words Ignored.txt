I have really grown to hate you,
and everything you've come to stand for
I write these words in vain,
You won't read them
This pen would go to better use.
if I shoved it into your throat
and let you choke on
your blood-filled breaths
However we once called
each other friend,
So this pen continues to write words
that you ignore
