Her eyes look down on me, upon my sorrow
As my soul lies on its death bed
Lost in regret, I Could not change
"I will stand strong in every way"
Nothing but a lie to myself, step by step
Closer to destruction
When I try to turn away from that image
I have failed those created in my own image
I have crumbled
I say in a small and frail voice, I say
I will not fall and under the pressure of her gaze, I
say
I will not crumble
I will not fall
This ethic must permeate every aspect of
my life, not just those that come with ease.
Rise above, regain control
Tear away from that image
This "one time" has become a habit
and will no longer be found within me
I say again, this time with much
conviction and sincerity
I will not Fall
I will not crumble
