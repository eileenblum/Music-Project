You are dead
You are dead my dearest
And I breathe
You have left me
You have left me forever more
Never to return and I remain
No, no, if my verses have any power
I will go confidently
To the deepest abysses
And having melted the heart of the king of shadows
I will return with you
To see the stars again
or if pitiless fate denies me this
I will remain with you
in the company of death
Farewell Sky
Farewell Sun
Farewell Earth
