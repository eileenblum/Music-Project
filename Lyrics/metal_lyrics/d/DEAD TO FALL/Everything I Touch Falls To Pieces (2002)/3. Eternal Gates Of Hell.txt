I said the final prayer too late
Approach those firey gates
Condemned to eternal wait
I paid my weight in silver and gold
And asked for it in writing
She looked at me with fearful eyes and said
...and then I saw the blood coming
The gates of hell open for me
And as far as my eyes could see
In carnage
Your demise
