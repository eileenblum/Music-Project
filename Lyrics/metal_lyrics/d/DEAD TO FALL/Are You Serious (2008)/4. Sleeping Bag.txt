OH NO! I can't do this anymore.
Faded out and coasting in the slow lane
Pushing the limits of death
No idea when the end will come
I think if I were you
I would have driven a million miles an hour
Until my engine explodes

Our lives flushed together, ready to burn up
You've failed everyone, ready to give up
I guess we really don't know
What it feels like pulling all the weight
Pissing all over you, abusing you, bending your will to fit our schedule.
Making every trip a journey into hell.
I'm sorry, but this time you're not coming back
OH NO!!

Every day, every day is the same, So tired
Every day, every day is the same, (I'm) so tired
SLEEPING BAG!

You have seen where we have been
You know our every secrets
(You see) we just can't let you live
That's just the way its gotta be
At least die with some dignity.

Every day, every day, it's the same, you're moving way too slow.
Inch by inch crawling up the mountain.
Every day, every day, its the same, so tired.
So give it all you got, give it fucking hell.
