Yo Logan, botgun that sheer!
Get the vibe goin' right in here.
Gotta write a jam. The one everyone wants to hear.

Crashing Flowing Swirling, Right from the Start
Except not with those lyrics, we already have a song about a shark!!!

OH SHIT! It's the death metal riff! I better sing about some face ripping, cat-raping bullshit!

Sit in my room and write about some brutal shit I know I'm never gonna do!

We gotta make it Thrash!
And make 'em bang their heads real fast
Make sure this song is really FUCKING STUPID!!!!

I think my vocals are pretty good so far, and I'm kinda ripped, so for this next part I'm gonna riff with the guitar.

2 minutes long, and fast as fuck!
This song is sick, but missing one part
OH yeah what is that?

We gotta get the kids, moving, circle pitting, stage-diving and singing along.
I've got a really original idea, of how I think we should end this song!

END THIS SONG............WITH A FUCKING BREAKDOWN!!!
