Dream from the sky and drift into the heavens
Weightless, thoughtless, a dream that is endless
If you don't look down you'll never fall
If you don't look down you'll never fall

Washed away and carried into the depths
The pressure builds and clutches the lungs
As life is sucked from a weakened soul
Dreams dissolve, dreams dissolve
Back on shore

[Solo 1:49]

Drop by drop [x4]

Washed away and carried into the depths
The rain comes crashing down again
Drowning in poisoned, poisoned thoughts
Dreams dissolve, dreams dissolve
Back on shore

[Solo 3:07]

Washed away and carried into the depths
Back into the deep under waves capped white
A glimmering something leads to an endless blue nothing
Dreams dissolve, dreams dissolve
Back on shore
