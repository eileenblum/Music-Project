Shot through time
With one mission in mind
Man is on the brink of extinction

The computer must be destroyed

There I was shit out into a lazerworld
An ant to a cyber colossus
The last of the humankind
Neon sectors scream
The drone materializes before me

"Klaatu Anauj I Ram Barada Om Nikto"

WITH ONE SUPER-MASSIVE FIST
MANKIND WILL BE CRUSHED
MANKIND IS DOOMED

I speak your doomwords
"Klaatu Anauj I Ram Barada Om Nikto"

There was a GIANT COSMIC BOOM

The mayor of the future approached me
And shoved an orb into my head
The mayor of the future approached me
And declared me worthy

SONIC MECHANICAL WARFARE
