By instinct you'll be drawn in
To the brutal stench alone
It's in our nature to desire
And hunt it down
It's powers are infernal, to say the least
Another gate to hell leading into the belly of the beast

Doombox
I dare you to test me again

Your first time inside
You'll feel right at home
Take hold and it has you
Almost swallowing you whole

DOOMBOX
I dare you to test me again

Destroyer - of what makes a man a man
Manipulator - take all that you can

The only weapon that can threaten the lifespear
CASTRATION!
Now I found a flamethrower
Your skin is all torched off
And you're in you're purest form
A state of wonderful impotence

Destroyer - of what makes a man a man
Manipulator - take all that you can
DOOMBOX
