My task is finished
I'll take my own road
Under the strengthening breath of nonentity
Dark stars like gloomy demons
Lie dignifiedly in company
Of dead, calm words

Silence is the time of survival
Final truth hidden in the space
It's an unimaginable creature in its magnitude
Unreal one but it pulls my brain near to itself
Dust of centuries cover my weak body
Like a mountain, which keeps the death
Imprisoned inside itself

How long is the way of fate?
How many people will die in a defeat
When the times comes
The rest comes to an end
And dreams about absolute power
Fly away like black ravens in the right

I am a master and a purpose
My country from time immemorial
Is abysmal infinity
The shadows of vultures are wheeling above me
The day of my death is coming
I will revive in a power of hatred and destruction
