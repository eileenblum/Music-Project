Naked nameless ones, the immortals
Will unite with man
In the wind, under the west side of the moon

When people's bones moulder
Dusk pull them to sleep
And the stars will burn again

Naked nameless ones call their power
Once who were mad
Will regain their minds and consciousness

They will rise again
Allthough they were driven in desperation
They will die but the curse will last for ever

Naked nameless ones, shadows of their ego
Nightmares will safeguard them
Singing the dead's dark songs

Crazy dance of bodies
Will spread anxiety like dust
In the wind under the north side of the moon
