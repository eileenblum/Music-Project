"...Nobody can say what will happen in a while
But still there are some stories
Which are repeated endlessly..."

Slowly decomposing corpse lies on the bed
There is chiling silence all around
The mouth distorted in a bestial grimace
The sunken and motionless eyes...
Suddenly lungs start working hearily like old bellows
Breathing out felid air with a whistle
The corpse starts learning to live again from the beginning
No man will rise from the mortal bed
But a bloody beast
The unsaved and greedy spectre comes back
And when it gets power over your weak minds
Panic terror and blood will emerge from your nightmares
