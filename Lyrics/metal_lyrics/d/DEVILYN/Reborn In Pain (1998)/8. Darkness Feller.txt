Where flows, somewhere in the caves
That human's thought can't measure
STHYX, the holy river
That dies in the dark sea
Eternal chaos's time's streams
Relentlessly tear darkness fetter

I keep on driftingunaware of existence
Dead inside and I look, as time passes
Immortality shakes hands with me
From the grey distance I can see, the end
Sings of worlds existence
Life-stinking human rouges

And even if I stalk
Through the shadows of the Dead's Valley
I won't be afraid of an uncalled whispers
As my dead soul signs hymn of immortality
I'll fly into storm I'll touch the absolute of depths
Burning wind will carry me towards fulfilments
