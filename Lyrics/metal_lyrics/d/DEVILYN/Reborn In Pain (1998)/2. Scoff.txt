I tread with the fire sowing destruction
My wings are raised by the blind demons
The false priests set fire to their temples
Fear tears naked body away from the cross

Holy things burn from my breath
The fiery angels fell down
The thunder pealed
The will the wisps were lighted

I will soffingly bewail fools lot
And from my tears the children will be born
People with black pupils and souls
The first ones, who will prostrate themselves before me

The ocean will come into being from hatred
And it will drown the enemies bodies for ever
The dark side of the moon
Turns toward the earth
I tread among the ruins of the world
Hypocrisy died with its confessors
I touch the graves of the sleeping evil
Which it thirsted for the final return
