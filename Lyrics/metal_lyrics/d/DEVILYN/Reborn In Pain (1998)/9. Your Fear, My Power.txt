To feel to power of fear
To understand this nature and meaning
To make sure that he who can make the most of it
Gets the power over the world of mortals
Will those be found who can face their
Own nightmare of existence
Someday they will be afraid of me
They will be afraid and well respect me
It's time you faced your fear
Completely alone, closed
In the depth of your bodies, souls and minds
Are you ready to understand and
Surrender to this finally
The land of your fears is within reach
How much is life worth without fear?
