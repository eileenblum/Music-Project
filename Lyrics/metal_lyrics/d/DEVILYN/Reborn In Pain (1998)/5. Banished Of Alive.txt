Call me devout, people make me an absolute god give me an empty name of
predecessors

Crown me, betray me and wait for punishment have an hour, mind the sides
The rough sides of life and death as I live there and I hide the truth despair

You'll notice me with your blind eyes
You'll hear me with you mute mouth
And nonentity will be done
There are no warnings darkness in just desire annihilation of feelings
I'll fame the flame with the final evil with a curse on lips foreever
I despise love and mercy poor pointless tissues
I spew on this spawn
I curse mankind forever
