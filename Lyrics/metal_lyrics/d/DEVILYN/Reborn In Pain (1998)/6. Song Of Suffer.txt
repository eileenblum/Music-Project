Everything's comes back here the beginning of nothings the end Ð·Ð° understanding
Primeval power of these who passed away before the human kind came
Each of you is a bloody book wherever you're opened you red banished of alive
Eternal wanderer looking for death
Come I'll show you depths of darkness hatred of mine will wind your frail body
It'll sack out the jowl of mind, ram the venom
I'll show my content for you nation

I crawl to the depths of darkness
Everything comes back here
Black bells strike up a song
Immemorial song of suffer and fear
The wind cries with pain words of prayer fly away
I grasp them in a silent grip put them into warm terrified minds
The scream dies like a dying star
Next existence soaks into thirty soil black wrinkled faces and you're here
Dead eyes are looking into my face
