Without glory you're dieing after combat fight
Your death is only dream
Without glory they'll take you life
There ones which are hell's butchers
Searing land greedily absorbs the blood
Predators like a ghosts make circles over bodies
I'm walking along corpses avenue
And I'm collecting your lives
Everywhere the smell of death and hate
Attract demons to the battlefield
They're tearing your souls to pieces
As your bodies earlier
Warriors of darkness gone under cover of night
To come back for next slaughter
With new day your life will back
You'll revitalize to die for ages
But without the glory, and goal and mercy
And I'll stand here for ever
Feeding darkness' demons with souls
And death will be only blissful and short dream
