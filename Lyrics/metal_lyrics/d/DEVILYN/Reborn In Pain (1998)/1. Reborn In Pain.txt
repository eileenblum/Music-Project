Black Lord poured hell fire in my veins to digest the rest of my soul
Indescribable pain and hatred in my eyes
Strike weak human beings
Very small onesbeside the power given to me
How very dirty their forms

Folls born from a dirty womb of mother
Who was a lover of the death corpse

I touch borders of madness and pain
The insanity and destruction obsessed me in lifetime
The kingdom of the deads call me
I burst the fellers of my life
I want to run away from the vale of fears
That empty and dead world

Hope - fools mother
Feeds her children on her venom
Holy war lasts. Blessed suicides
My enemy cries desperately
I'll do him the last service
I'll feed the vultures on his carcass
Fire cleans me, takes my life away
But gives me immortality
I don't leave my crusade. Not yet
Murder - in immemorial disgrace will last for ever
