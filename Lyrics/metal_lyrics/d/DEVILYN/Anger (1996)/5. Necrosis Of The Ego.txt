I hate the world and ordinaries
I burn my boats
I cut myself off feelings
I hold them and he in an abhorrence.
I want to present all the people -
With true natural pain.
to deepent everything into depression
Fear is natural and
a nice feeling
throughout the magnitude.
I see an imagination in my eyes.
I am an imagination of
the ill, paralysed mind.
Sometime everyone will give up
but it will be too late.
And the end is the worst
because all-powerfuls look at
your convulsions.
I knew too early
the first step is behind me
The ordinaries turns into
the irrational nightmares,
which live inside me.
I deliver my hatred for the world.
