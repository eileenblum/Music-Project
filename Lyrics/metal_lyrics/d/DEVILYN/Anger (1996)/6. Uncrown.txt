Lots of people
Kneeling down on their knees
A head of their funny god
They have believed in
Happiness after life
But they have got only
Death and pain

You promised them paradise
You promised neverending life
But you left them despise
And only blood

Who allowed you to take away the life
Who allowed you to conduct a chaos
Who allowed you to call you god

Your end is near
You will be thrown down to the hell
Rememberance of you
Won't be kept in nation's memory
Destroying power of nothing
He has just come back
Your end is near
There will be no forced faith
There will be no quiet people
