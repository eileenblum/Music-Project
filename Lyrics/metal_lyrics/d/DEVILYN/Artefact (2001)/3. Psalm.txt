And became the time 
When the prophecies have been fulfilled
Time that never exist before
All sorts of plague crawled craftily
From the gloomiest places of the universe
Triumph of unreality over reality
Curses are repeated for thousands times
And fool's praying are changing in worms

Animal lust, infected weak minds
Children they children burning atomic pile
All symbols are changed in snakes
Deadly bites for own confessors
Pain is the only law
Ancient awake in own crypts
Hidden in unknown dimensions

Doubt, cry and madness are reigning
Because weak minds are still blind
Thorn in every soul, without exception
Made the stinky abscess
And every "cure" continues endless agony
Pathologies are unwritten rules
Questions pumping poison to the minds

Nobody is able to see the end because he's the end
Although everything is already ended
Only silence left, everywhere
Interrupted by the silent mind on the desert
Bathed in scorching heat from hell
Gods are preparing for the rest
To begin everything once again
