"In the kingdom of the blind, 
the king is the one with one eye"

Absolute power, unreal creation
Men's or ancient ghosts' work?
Experts of the dead paths
Experts of the way - the great precenturers

Talisman for the ruler of flies
A key to darkness or a gift from mortal
Askar - of matrix in core of chaos
Inflamed painful wound

A wastes roamer's spirit
Summoned by mystic scriptures 
The spirit of battlefield's glow
Lured by smell of death and blood

Work without rest and goal
Goal with no means and no sense
Revival by oblivion
Identity of non-existence

U - DA - AM
A day with black sun
Rising inevitably on horizon
Dancing shadows on the World's ruins
MEPHIR - liar with no soul

MORZAS ZI FORNIAS KANPA
The ancient ghosts return
The ancient ghosts return
It's time to find the talisman
It's time to find the talisman
The last gate is open
