Here I'm - revival
Stronger than whenever in eternity
I'm yesterday
Future is my mother
And dusk is my father

I'm spitting the plague out of my gust
It's a gift, ultimate gift
Immortal scream from out of me
With source in the nucleus of the darkness

Flame burning me inside
Flame which rotates and screaming endless
Setters are burst, freedom
Broken resolutions about the profits
United with chaos

On star's chariot
In flames with rotten mind
With lies on the mouth
And eternal frost in dead soul

Here I'm - hatched out of the darkness
Ancient knowledge is the plague
Pest for a real world

In dark embrace
The giants are closed, fighting for an advantage
I'm the judge and the final
And I've became a death - world's destroyer
