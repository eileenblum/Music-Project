One look into space
Releases your narcotic visions
Of world in apocalyptic struggle
On your face the blood streams engrave
The sigma of the deprived environment
As they run down to the river
Of stinking human stupidity

Your life slowly discovers
The instinct of murder in you
Your deceived conscience makes you
Torture your own thoughts
Scream!
Infirmity!
Torn out of the depths of your body
You have no strength to fight through
And suffocate in the endless ring

Your winged psyche slowly fades
Becoming cluster
Of your helplessness' rotten remains
And with the discovery of beast in yourself
You've lost the distance to reality
In which chaos, silence, mutiny and destruction
Is unity
