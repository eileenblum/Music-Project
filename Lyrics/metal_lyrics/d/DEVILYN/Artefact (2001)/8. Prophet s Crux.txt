Millions of voices shouted
Seeking the knowledge key
The knowledge is power - the power is nonsense
And voices seek in vain

Whispers of knowledge around me
The rulers of dreams
Judges of secrets of universe
And voices struggle for knowledge

Creepy shadows sneak unnoticed
They dim your awareness of reality
The key is somewhere here
And voices can't see the truth

Riddles of the unknown ancients
And hidden knowledge so precious
The guardians of universe stand unbroken
And raging voices so far from the knowledge

Riddles prisoned in the walls
Built of defective beings
Coherent and impassable
The questions which became answers
