On Peryhelium day
When sunshine is the weakest
Darkness fell on the magician - went blind
His eyes were covered by a black leucoma
But the gates opened before him
Of True - Aryman (?) - World
Of  charity fire
Rule of God the series of lies
of  harm and exploitation
Let the lost find 
the blind woman on desert
Will become moon - your signpost
Set of planets portend
Aryman's Night is falling
Inconceivable power in opposite to Mars
Prophets from their mysteries
Draw strength to perfect deceptions
Exposed in darkness of their sins
Continuous prayers of terrified people
Arymans - the essence of evil and darkness
Mainstay for moments of  suffering
Dark roamer of devastated lands
On Peryhelium day 
Open the gates of true Aryman world for us
Ultimately
