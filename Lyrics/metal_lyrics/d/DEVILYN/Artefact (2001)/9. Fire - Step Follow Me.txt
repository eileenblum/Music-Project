The last butcher of human kind has began
I'm standing unbeaten over the world
Up to kneels in disemboweled mortals' guts
Last living can hear my ironic laugh

Fucking whores laying around my feeds
Begging for mercy, outreached
I have no mercy inside of me, only pure hate
I'm the judge and the executor, nothing can stop me

I crush human carrion, stinky grease
That's all what left after that creatures
My crusade is a crazy butcher
I can't rest, the final end has to be done

I'm stepping with fire and destruction
I'm sating of death and blood sight
It's my spiritual food, it's my only target
Mortal people, leave any hope

Heavy red clouds hanging over my world
I feel transient beings, rubbing of the mind
Screams dying, you can hear only wind
I take a breath, I'm standing of destruction

Fire step follow me, be my guide
Fire step follow me, I'm the end of everything
Fire step follow me, I'm your end
End of everything, without a new begin
I'm a judge and executor, nothing can stop me
