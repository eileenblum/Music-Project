Here I'm alone 
Look through the window 
Snow's falling down 
Winter has come 
Think to the times 
When we were happy 
Changes I want 
Freedom again 

Many years ago the Major said: "Since today you gotta call me king" 
Our liberty he took away, with the promise of a golden dream 
Soon the dream became a nightmare 
Soon the rebels they began to die 
No one seemed to have the power to 
Get rid of the Major of the Lies 

There's a story about a man who lives  
In the forest of the ancient rites  
I am going now to search for him, if he does exist I want his guide 
Then I find him and he says to me:  
"I've been waiting for a pure so long 
I am giving you the magic ring that will bring you to another world 

[bridge]
Join me tonight for a journey through the dark 
We'll find this place that is not so far" 

[chorus]
Follow the prophet to Never, Neverland 
Where all the free men together they will stand 
A dream of liberty and peace for everyone 
Under the light of the sun 

I am coming back now, to the real world 
To the land of freedom, I will bring you all 
It is time for you now, all you slaves and poor 
Break the chains that would never let you fly away 
If you got the courage, and your heart is pure 
All the pain and the sorrow you can behind 

[bridge]

[chorus]
