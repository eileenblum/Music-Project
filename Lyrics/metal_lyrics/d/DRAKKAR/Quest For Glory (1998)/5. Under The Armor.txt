See him shining red and gold, rocket boots to make him fly 
To defend the innocents dedicates his life 
Evil ones all around, till he crush 'em to the ground 
An avenger made of steel, he's the Iron Man 

[bridge]
He's invincible 
Man-machine for war 

[chorus]
Under the armor you know there's a man 
His greatest weapon his brain 
Fightin' with weapons he did by himself 
No one can stand in his way 

He can be invisible, he has got repulsor rays 
Honorable, strong and brave, technologic knight 
Without fear he always fights for the justice and the peace 
Armored and dangerous, he's the Iron Man 

[bridge]

[chorus]

See him shining red and gold, once again he flies around 
He's in search of criminals, nowhere they can hide 
Hearing his metallic voice, they will sweat and tremble with fear 
Knowing they cannot escape from the Iron Man 

[bridge]

[chorus]
