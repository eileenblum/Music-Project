Every day we gotta play in the game of life 
Liars try to put us down, we won't run and hide 

[bridge]
Stronger we are, than all the bastards and fools 
'Cause we believe in everything that we do 

[chorus]
Standing together, we know our time has come 
Fighting forever, we never will be gone 
Raising the banners, proud to be here tonight 
Dressin' in leather, will you be on our side? 

What will be the next big thing? We don't give a fuck! 
Metal's not a fashion, metal's not a joke 

[bridge]

[chorus]
