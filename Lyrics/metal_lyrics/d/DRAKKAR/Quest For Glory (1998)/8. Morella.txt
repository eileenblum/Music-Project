Morella was a friend of mine 
I never loved her, but we married 
She made me happy in a way I can't explain 
A kind of mystic happiness 

Talking of philosophy we spent many hours 
May awareness of yourself still survive to death? 
I was very happy then, listenin' to her 
Till a day, a fatal day, joy was turned to hate! 

Hating my Morella I wished her to die 
Illness fell upon her, she began to fade 
She told me to listen, "I've something to tell: 
Who you never loved in life, you will love in death" 

[chorus]
"This is the day of days, the day to live and die, for all the daughters of death and sky 
Tonight we're gonna die, but I will live again 
The time of pain for you has began" 

Growin' up day by day, pretty little girl 
Our daughter I did love more than you can now 
So resembling to her mother, too wise for a child 
I never gave a name to her, until she was ten 
I had to baptize her, we went to the church 
And the priest he asked me the name of the girl 
Still I don't know why "Morella" did I say 
Screaming "Here I am!" my little daughter died 

[chorus]

And when I went to our family's tomb to bury the second Morella, I didn't find any sign of the
first. And I began to laugh... and laugh... and laugh...
