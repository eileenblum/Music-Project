Finally the fight begins over the moor 
And we know the enemy is much too strong 
In the heart I have no fear, coward I'm not 
I'll be riding with the gods, my time has come 

Hear the sound of battle horns, I have to go 
Is there any glory for me, I just don't know 
Balder will you guide my way, give me your strenght 
On this field I face the death, no turning back 

[bridge]
My sword waits for blood 
In the name of Thor 

[chorus]
Open for me the gates of your Valhalla 
Father Odin wait for me, I'll be there with you 
I will not die, I'm riding through the sky 
Warriors of eternity, I'll be there with you
Blood was spilled, many were killed 
The battle seems over now, am I really still live? 
Heimdall, are you watching me from Bifrost? 
But I'm not dead, not this time! 

Now the fight is over and here on the field 
Lie so many broken men, but I still live! 
One day I will meet you Odin, but not today 
And tomorrow into glory I'll ride again

[bridge]

[chorus]
