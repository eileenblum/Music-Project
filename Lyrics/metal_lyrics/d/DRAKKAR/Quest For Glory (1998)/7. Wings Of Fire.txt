Standing here, in the dark of my room 
Once again, I am thinking of you 
I will miss all the jokes and the smiles 
Are you now in a place that you like? 

Strugglin' you did spend all your life 
Now is time to rest, all pain has died 
You have gone away from us, heading for a better life 
Beyond this crazy time 

[chorus]
Farewell my friend, this is my goodbye 
Fly away tonight on a pair of wings of fire 
We will meet again, on the other side 

In the heart are the words I can't find  
Hail to you, this is all I can say 
I don't know if you can hear my song 
Watch me please from the heaven above 

Reach the second star, the second to the right 
Straight ahead you sail, 'till the morning light 
Far beyond this world you go, heading for a better life 
Where all is good and quiet 

[chorus]
