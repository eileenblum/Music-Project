My body is broken
My walking days are over
Yet I have discovered
There's more in me than meets the eye

My mind's eye is open
Your form I can take over
Skinchanger, shapeshifter
I can be all I like

And I wanna be it

[4x]
Run with the wolf

To become the wolf
To become the eagle
Helpless no more
Nevermore alone

Leaving all behind
All the pain and evil
Never in chains
Nevermore again

And I gonna be it

[4x]
Run with the wolf

[Solo]

[6x]
Run with the wolf
