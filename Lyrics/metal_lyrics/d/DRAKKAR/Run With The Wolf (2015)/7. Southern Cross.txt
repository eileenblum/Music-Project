By the shining Southern Cross
I am reminded how far I have come
Left my home in the far, deep north
To seek my fortune on foreign shores

Many times I have heard in my dreams
The sound of violins, the smell of the trees
As I woke up and they were gone
I felt the sting of the memories of home

Now I know that the future is bright
That one day I'll return
To that place that will always be home
To the heart of a sailor once bold

Through the days and nights alone
I've often wondered is this what I want?
I'd have given up everything
For just a glimpse of my island of green

I'll be back as a wealthy man but no riches compare
To the smiles of the people I left
And the beautiful sights of my land

From the north to the south of the world
The trip was long and the stay even more
I've been working my ass off for years
To see my country again through the tears

I am ready to sail my own ship
I'm wise and older and it's time to leave
My farewell to the Southern Cross
The things you taught we will never be lost

I'll be back as a wealthy man but no riches compare
To the smiles of the people I left
And the beautiful sights of my land
