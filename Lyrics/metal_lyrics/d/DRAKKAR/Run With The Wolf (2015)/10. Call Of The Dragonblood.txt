The battle is over
And our bodies lie there, broken and dead
A terrible slaughter
Many warriors met a glorious end

I can see them rising
Shining souls of the dead, courageous men
Whose side they were on matters no more
Now we ride with the gods!

Behind the veil
Asgard awaits
We'll cross the rainbow bridge to the call
The call of the Dragonblood

We have been chosen
For our valorous deeds, worthy of kings
The Valkyries come
They will take us away to that sacred place

Donât cry for us brother
To Valhalla we go, it's our reward
By day we will fight, by night we'll feast
For eternity!

In the halls of Odin
We'll stand proud and free
Burn our mortal bodies
Ashes on the sea
Take care of our wives and daughters, we have gone beyond
Though we'll never meet again remind them of our love

The battle is over
And their bodies lie there, broken and dead
A terrible slaughter
Many warriors met a glorious end

Are they all together
On the barge of the dead, these courageous men?
My brother's with them, I'll miss him so
Now he rides like a god!
