Donât fear the fire, just let it burn
There is a passion play inside your very soul
Donât try to tame it, let it be known
That no one else but you can set your dreams and goals

Theyâll try to break you
So stand your ground
And be yourself

Be invincible
Let your dreams become an armor made of steel
Be invincible
Indestructible, thatâs what you have to be

Here comes tomorrow, so brace yourselves
Life is what happens when you're making other plans
Just donât surrender, never give in
Because you know that sometimes life can be a bitch

Make our own movie
You are the star
And no one else

And when you stumble
Stand up again to fight another day!
