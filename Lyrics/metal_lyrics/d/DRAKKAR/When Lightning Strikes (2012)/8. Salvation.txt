My time has come
On tins fateful night, I will surrender my life
With no regrets in my heart and no tear
For such is the way of the warrior:
To die with honor and steel!

Salvation
Will never come
Salvation

Oh son of mine
I am sorry to leave you behind
But my duty calls, and tonight there's no...

The siege begins
It won't be long before the end of our song
We strike as fast and as hard as we can
To breathe our last to meet a glorious death

Oh son of mine
I am sorry to leave you behind
But my duty calls, and tonight there's no...
Salvation!

My time has come
It won't be long before the end of my song
