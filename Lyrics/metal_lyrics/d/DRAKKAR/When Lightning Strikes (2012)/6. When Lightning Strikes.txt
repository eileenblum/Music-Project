Staring at the lire pits, in control
Pain and Desperation Overlord
He's Alpha and Omega of a tortured world
Looking to expand his grim domain
Searching for the power to enslave
His iron will is all that remains

We are the ones, the only hope
We stand against his fanatic horde
We are the ones whose light will shme when all is dark
And we will arise
When lightning strikes

Born with a heart of stone, only one desire: a universe to mire Sons, spawn of Italy
Fight against the dire, feel the righteous ire Join our revolution scream!

Destiny awaits me on this peak
And there is no fear of death in me
I don't care, as long as I'm free
As I fall with bullets in the chest
I can see the eyes of my best friend
"Rest", they say, "for you have done well"
