Here in the future
A united humanity
Travels the galaxy to seek
New races and cultures
To discover new ways to be
What an adventure to live!

Our starship goes
Where no one has gone before
Where empires fall
Or new ones are born!

Open a new frontier
Carry hope, carry aid to the planets in fear
Open a new frontier
Carry hope, carry aid to the forgotten worlds

Strange in the crew
Made of humans and aliens alike
Ready to serve or to fight
All dedicated
To the noblest ideals of all
Duty and justice's their call
