[Instrumental][Storyline from the booklet]

Time, 2238 A.D.
Place, inside the Armageddon Machine

While the world around him stands terrified, and incapable
of understanding the aliens' purposes. Hal finds
himself inside the belly of the beast. The gargantuan
ship seems to be even bigger from the inside than on
the outside. Unable to move, he is transported through
an array of metal pistons moving incessantly and finally
attached to a strange but comfortable chair. Two alien
figures stand before him. Their shapes are blindingly
bright. As soon as they start talking, his mind starts to
wander. Memories are awakened after centuries of
sleep. His conscience starts drifting back in time to different
places. Different lives.
