Promised to faith and the holy mysteries
Obedient to the righteous hierarchy
Follow the path of the unicorn tapestries
The heritage of our ancestry

By this night we anoint our steel
For the moon vessel to distill
As we are marching towards the sea
Our armors scorch our skin

Transcend every duality
For our souls to be transparent
Refuse every idolatry
And imitate our masters' ascent

I am your knight servant
To keep this garden verdant
Until the light will be back
Thy name is resplendent
Thine sorrows are the pendant
That glistens bright around my neck

Bow down on our wounded knee
And summon the Holy Trinity
My beloved brothers;
We must be one against the enemy
