Son of a land
Harsh and covered in ice
You must be strong
If you want to survive
To save our kind
From starvation and death
Pirates we'll be
Warriors until the end

Side by side
The crows of Odin he my guide
Kill or die
The only choice you have m life

We ride winds of fury
The blade is our jury
We sail when the dragon
Is awake!

For some of them
We'rÐµ more monsters than men
Ruled by their fear
They do not understand
Now there's a storm
That is coming our way
Another fight
Against thunder and rain
