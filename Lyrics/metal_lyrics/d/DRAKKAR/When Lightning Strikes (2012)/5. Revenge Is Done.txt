Remember, remember, the 5th of November,
the Gunpowder Treason and plot;
I know of no reason why
Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot.

I am the son of fire and I survived a thousand kinds of hell
They have taken everything, ail that I ever cared for, ever had

But theres a last inch of me and that's my own dignity
No force in heaven or hell can ever take it away 'cause I am free!

Your time is over, and so is mine
We're at the end of the line
Our revolution lias just begun
But my revenge now is done
Revenge is done!

There is no flesh and no blood
Behind this mask to kill
For I'm not a man, not anymore!
Ideas are bulletproof
You cannot shoot or stab them
They will endure, and so will I!

People should not be afraid of their own leaders no more
Its leaders that have to learn to be afraid of us all, 'cause we are free!

Remember, remember, the 5th of November,
the Gunpowder Treason and plot; I know of no reason why
Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot

Guy Fawkes, Guy Fawkes, 'twas his intent to blow up the King and Parliament.
Three score barrels of powder below, Poor old England to overthrow
