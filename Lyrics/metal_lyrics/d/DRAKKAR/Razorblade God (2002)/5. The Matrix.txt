So many times in the past
I have been hearing
This word I don't understand:
What is |The Matrix|?
The quest is over today
'Cause the answer
Came right to me in the shape
Of Morpheus

[Bridge 1:]
Tell me what should I do
To get freedom of mind
For it's better to die for the truth
Than to live in a lie

I can't believe what I see
Is this the real world?
Can I be their chosen one
To end this evil?
About the Matrix I had
This revelation:
The only limit is my
Imagination

[Bridge 2:]
Maybe I'm not the one
I don't think he is right
But I won't let my friend die for me
Not without any fight!

[Chorus:]
Matrix
Now I know and I'm not afraid
For a new world is starting today
Matrix
Now the secret has been unveiled
I'm the one who will ease all the pain

[Bridge 1]
[Chorus]
