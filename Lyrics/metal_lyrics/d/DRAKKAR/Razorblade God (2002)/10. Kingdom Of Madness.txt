[Magnum cover]

When the night is on the run
and your dreams are almost gone
seas of fire snatch your soul
beast of morning then unfold
in a whirlpool sadness creeps
shadows walk with silent feet
is there something in the air
turns your hope into dispair
Oh kingdom of madness you've got me undone
oh kingdom of madness you've really begun
oh kingdom of madness you've got me on the run
When the night is on the run
and your dreams are almost gone
seas of fire snatch your soul
beast of morning then unfold
take your hands away from me
leave my eyes so I can see
it's not pleasure that you seek
you destroy the ones who are week
Oh kingdom of madness you've got me undone
oh kingdom of madness you've really begun
oh kingdom of madness you've got me on the run
the minstrel sings as he
looks at me
but he doesn't make a sound
and a lovely time is had
by all
as the jester takes his crown
everyone's laughing
everyone's laughing
everyone's laughing but me
Oh kingdom of madness you've got me undone
oh kingdom of madness you've really begun
oh kingdom of madness you've got me on the run
