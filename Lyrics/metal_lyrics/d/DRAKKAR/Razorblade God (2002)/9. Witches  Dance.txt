I am the night
Follow me and you will not regret

[Bridge 1:]
Let me take you to the place
Where the witches dance the night away

You've got desire
Let it out, let it be satisfied

[Bridge 2:]
And I will take you to the place
Where the witches dance the night away

[Chorus:]
So come and join the dance
For now your time has come
We'll give you everything you want
Don't worry about the day
When you will have to pay
For it is very far away

[Bridge 2]
[Chorus 2:]
So come enjoy the dance
For now your time has come
Now you got everything you want
And soon will come the day
When you will have to pay
For it is not so far away...
