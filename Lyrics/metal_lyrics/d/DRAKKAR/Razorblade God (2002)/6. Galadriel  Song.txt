Listen to the song of Galadriel
Singin' of the golden leaves, singin' of the wind
By the foot of walls of Elven Tirion,
The tree shines at Eldamar, where the leaves are gold
Now we have to leave, sorrow in our hearts
But a mission lies right ahead of us

[Bridge:]
Hear the choirs of elves
Cry on the shore o' the hostile sea
Will they ever be free?

[Chorus:]
Oh Lorien! Comes the winter now
Empty, naked comes the hour
Faded is her crown of gold Elanor
Oh Lorien! On the other shore
She did stay for much too long
Faded is her crown of gold Elanor

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
