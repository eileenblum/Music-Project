I have lost my way into the wood
Where am I tonight?
Fear inside, I'm lost and so alone
Where will I go?
I have reached a hill and tried to climb
Now the dawn has come
But a Wolf is standing in my way
Won't let me go

Are you real, or nothing but a ghost?
Save me from the Wolf!
|Follow me|, he says, |And you will see what's beyond life|
On the Hill of Dawn I climb behind him
He's the guide and master
Now in front of us there is a door
Where will it lead?

[Spoken Bridge:]
Per me si va nella citta dolente,
Per me si va nell'etterno dolore,
Per me si va tra la perduta gente.
Dinanzi a me non fuor cose create
Se non etterne, e io etterna duro.
Lasciate ogni speranza, o voi ch'entrate.

[Chorus:]
Virgil
Guide me through this world
Where spirits cry
Keep me safe and tell me how
To live my life

[Chorus]
