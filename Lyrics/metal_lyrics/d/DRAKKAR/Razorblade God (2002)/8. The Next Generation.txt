Take a look now to what you've created
We're the sons of your Madness and Pride
Evolution cannot be sedated
We're the Next Generation of men

[Bridge:]
We're hunters and you're preys
You won't escape

[Chorus:]
No feelings
We're perfect
We're deadly war machines
You better
Surrender
Our force... It is too big

We got claws like the deadliest predators
Our senses are sharper than yours
First of all we have killed our creators
Like the Titans were killed by the Gods

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

You're no match for the Ultimate Soldiers
It's our time to be rulin' the world
We will laugh while your bodies get colder
We're the Next Generation of men

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
