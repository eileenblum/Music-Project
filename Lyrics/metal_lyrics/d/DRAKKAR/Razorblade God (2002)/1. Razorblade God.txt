On the mysterious planet
Called Hyperion
There is a strange divinity
It's made of steel and razors
And nobody knows
From where it came or what it is

Great is the power hidden
In the Tombs of Time
And it is under its control
To one of seven pilgrims
It will grant a wish
But all the others it will kill

[Bridge:]
Salvation or damnation it gives
To those who dare
To stand before it
What will be?

[Chorus:]
Mighty Razorblade God
It's an invincible force
Time is right in its hand
The waves of time
It commands

It is the mighty
It is the one
What is the secret
Lying behind its mask
Eyes red and burning
Fire inside
The deadly beauty
Of the killing desire

[Chorus]
