I have come inside the Area
I will take my brother out with me
I will crush Machines' Empire
By my side I got the best B't

[Bridge:]
'Cause we're brothers for all life
You and I
And for you I will

[Chorus:]
Ride the mechanical Kirin
United man and machine
Only together we're strong
Enough to save the world

I was born to be a warrior
But I wasn't ready for all this
Now I'm learning that our only hope
Is to trust each other, X and me

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

From a drip of my blood X was reborn
Now we're linked forevermore

[Chorus]
