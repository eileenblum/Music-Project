[M&amp;L: Beretta, Ferraris]

Fingers turning red, cold freezing my breath
Never looking down only straight ahead
Winds are blowing all around
Get a grip or you'll fall down
Holding tight to the rock
And you know you cannot stop
Ghosts are dancing now, right before my eyes
Howling in the wind, messing up my mind
I see I must close my eyes
Climbing as if I was blind
Holding tight to the rock
And I know I can't... stop
Winds are blowing even stronger than before
But I don't feel I'm endangered anymore
[Bridge:]
It is hard to climb but now I know
I can do it if I want
[Chorus:]
Will I ever see the top of the cliff ?
Now the strength is abandoning me I am alone
Cold is passing like a knife right through me
I will climb until I'm there, I will go to the peak
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
