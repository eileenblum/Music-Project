[M&amp;L: Beretta]

The demon awaits; he's laughing at Artan now
A red sword in hand, in the eyes a burning fire
[Bridge 1:]
Into the Hall of Darkness
The epic fight begins
The pure of heart has taken the first blood
But the evil one is ready for his attack
[Bridge 2:]
Though Artan does his best
It may be just too hard
[Chorus:]
Until the end fights for the hope
He doesn't know he's not alone
It's not the sword, it is the heart
He must rely on for the fight
Artan's running all around
Tryin' hard to trick the demon
But his blows are far too weak
He can wound, he cannot kill
Kamen' sword is burning fire-he doesn't need to touch you
Coming close it is enough-to feel the deadly heat
[Chorus]
[Kamen:]
How can you dare to challenge me?
Are you insane or want to die?
[Artan:]
I won't let go, I won't surrender
I'll give it all, also my life
[Kamen:]
My power comes right from a god
My fate's to rule, I am the One
[Artan:]
Maybe it's true, but we will stand
And we will fight to the last man
But in the end, right when all it seems to be lost
Slayn here he comes, taking himself Kamen's deadly lounge
Then, by the sword, Artan cuts the demon's head off
All is over now, the end of the war
