[M&amp;L: Beretta]

[The wind:]
Tell me what do you feel?
[Artan:]
Wind takes my body embracing me
Receive me into his hands
My heart shall arise, my spirit flies into real life
I am taken by hand, my mind now understands
[The wind:]
I am the scream of freedom's dream
I'm in your fight for liberty
I'm in the battle for all that's right
Beyond the wall of human hate
Every brave heart I will move
Every true love I will know
I can be velvet, I can be steel
God of the air, (I) do what I will
[Bridge:]
I am the one you're searching
I am the Oracle-mine is the voice of the wind
I am the miracle of life-I'm everywhere I like
[Chorus:]
Listen to me, I'm the Voice of the Wind
Go now to the Crystal Sea
There you will find something that you will need
To break the mystical shield
Travel on to reach the Crystal Shore
Never rest, you know the time is short
Two days and one night you have to walk
Through the iced land of Aryon
If you want to end this bloody war
Beatin' Kamen is the only hope
But beware, 'cause even if you win
You will lose, this is my prophecy
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
