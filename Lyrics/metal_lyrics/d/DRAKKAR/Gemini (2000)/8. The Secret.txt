[M: Beretta/L: Beretta, Cappellari]

Blade on blade, they are crossing the swords
Sparkles fly and the duel begins
Artan knows that he has to prevail
Leaving fear in the back of the heart
[Bridge 1:]
Slayn is decided not to let him pass
He has a dark smile on his lips
[Chorus:]
On through the path of glory they are marching on
There is a secret and tonight it will be known
Call of the destiny will bind them like a chain
Nothing will ever be the same
Not again
By his sword Slayn is stronger than all
Artan is falling to the ground
Helmet breaks, and reveals his face
Battle ends, by the hand of fate
[Bridge 2:]
Looking at Artan Slayn is turning pale
Standing in silence he awaits
[Chorus]
[Bridge 3:]
Slayn has decided now to let him pass
Nobody's winning in the end
[Chorus]
