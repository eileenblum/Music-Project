[M: Beretta/L: Beretta, Cappellari]

Sparkling in the sun
Armed of steel and leather we are
Our red sign over the shield is symbol of death
Hate in the eyes, riding black horses... ready to strike!
Masters of war, showing no mercy, and no remorse
[Bridge:]
Wherever we go, death will follow on
[Chorus:]
Marching soldiers of death, so proud to fight and to die
We will win in the end, and we will conquer this land
Marching soldiers of death, ready to fight and to die
Our glory will shine will light an eternal fire
Drinking the blood of our foes we crucify
An open skull over the banner it's our flag
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
Fires-burning the fires-we'll never die
Marth-the evil god-guarding us all
Blood-running the blood-won't let you go
Die-bow down or die-this is the time
With long black hair covered by a helmet made of bone
Ice in the eyes, fast as a lightning, grey as the sky
Big sword in hand guiding our troops, Slayn is the name
The only one, who never needs the power of Marth
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
