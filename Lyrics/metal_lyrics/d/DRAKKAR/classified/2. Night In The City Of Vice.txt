Burning the night up
May be the only way
To overcome the madness of everyday
Vice city hits you
Not like a ton of lead
Before you know it she's crept under
Your skin

[Bridge:]
You know where to go
When you re in search for fun
You know what to do
Just come here in Vice City

[Chorus:]
Night is calling
Tommy just could not resist
Senses burning
By the industrial disease
Rosie is coming
She will bring him back to life
But not before a night
A night in Vice City

Sign on the dotted line
It is the only way
When every sin is for sale
And you just can't pay
Vice City kisses
Right where you like it best
Before you know you ll have
No time to rest

[Bridge:]
You know where to go
When you re in search for fun
You know what to do
Just come here in Vice City

[Chorus:]
Night is calling
Tommy just could not resist
Senses burning
By the industrial disease
Rosie is coming
She will bring him back to life
But not before a night
A night in Vice City
