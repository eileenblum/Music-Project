Standing on the edge of war
Nothing more is black or white
It all comes in shades of grey
When survival is at stake
To defend you paradise
How much will you compromise?
Would you become a devil?

[Bridge:]
Through the good times
And the bad times as well
Our beliefs we should never forget

[Chorus:]
Like a needle in the vain
I can fell the sting of pain
Sometimes to defend the light
Needs an angel sacrifice

We believed we'd never see
Such a day in our lives
Now a cold sensation runs
All the way down our spines
In our corner of the world
Closer than ever before

[Bridge:]
Through the good times
And the bad times as well
Our beliefs we should never forget

[Chorus:]
Like a needle in the vain
I can fell the sting of pain
Sometimes to defend the light
Needs an angel sacrifice
