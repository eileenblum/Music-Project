Another body's on the ground
Another deal has been fulfilled by now
My trademark's all over the place
I leave another easy trace

[Bridge:]
Once more they follow the trail
But they re always one step behind me
I know they will find a way
To kill me if they are Elite

[Chorus:]
Night Stalkers
They play a deadly game
Night Stalkers
Nobody will escape

To end my final story in blook
I called the best assassins in the world
To my death I already ride
But how I do I will decide

[Bridge:]
Once more they follow the trail
But they re always one step behind me
I know they will find a way
To kill me if they are Elite

[Chorus:]
Night Stalkers
They play a deadly game
Night Stalkers
Nobody will escape
