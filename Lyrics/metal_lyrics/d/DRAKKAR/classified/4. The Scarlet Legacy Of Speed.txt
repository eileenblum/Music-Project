He heard the call
Of destiny so young
He couldn't believe
The blessing he had received

[Bridge 1:]
Speed burning inside
Never felt so alive
Because a dream became his life

[Chorus:]
Beyond the speed of sound
There on the edge of light
Leaving the thunder behind
The hero's legacy
Scarlet identity
He keeps alive running for life

So many rogues
And maniacs he has to fight
Every night
A new enemy will arise

[Bridge 2:]
Still he never bows
Never will let us down
To serve and guard
His heart is bound

[Chorus:]
Beyond the speed of sound
There on the edge of light
Leaving the thunder behind
The hero's legacy
Scarlet identity
He keeps alive running for life
