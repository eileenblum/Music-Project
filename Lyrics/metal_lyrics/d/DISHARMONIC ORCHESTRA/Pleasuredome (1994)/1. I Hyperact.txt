Sometimes I hyperact
At least behaviours indicate
That something's not intact
Concerning habits that relate
To lack of understanding
It doesn't matter for your part
But I still try to handle
My surplus energy - that's hard

I'm watching your movements
It appears so strange to me
All actions - slow motion
These images I see
Maybe I'm more than acting hyperly
I am surrounded by a floppy lethargy

Organizing facts
Order nice in fact
All I make

Speed of dream is low
Not until I know
That I'm awake

Try to pass my time
Try another rhyme
Pencils brake

Hard to hold a move
I can never prove
What it takes

Puddle in my mind
In another kind
A bigger lake

Reorganizing facts
Reorderd nice in fact

Speed up to my dimension
