All of my tomorrows
Are too bad to be true
Like a dose of poison
I consider killing you
I take myself away
In the shadow of disgrace

I'm faced by something
That jumps around me
While I'm waiting
and dissipating

I never knew what's  like
Talking to myself
Unknown there is  one
Devoted to me

To be delivered from me
You've been waiting for such a long time
Taking control of my soul
Everytime I'm driving insane

I lay beneath the upcoming scene
It's happening once in a while
I'd take the train but I don't care
I'm watching my past passing by

Waiting for you to come
To take me over
Can't escape your sphere
Recommended Suicide
