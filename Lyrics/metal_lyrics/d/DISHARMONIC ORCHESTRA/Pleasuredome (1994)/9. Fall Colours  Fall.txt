Raindrops fall
Wind blows through the dripping colours
I'm waiting for
getting dropped with all the others

Thought I could stay
A little while in that surrounding
I wished that may
Came back again and sun would bound in

Fuzzy shades of shadows all around
A veil of mist is covering the ground

Seasons run
Soon I grew old
Time has come
I'm loosing hold

Could this be all?
Entire life
From spring to fall?

A dark and murkygloominess is caused
By heavy smoke made by a cars's exhaust

I'm falling now
Think back to then when I was green
Bed myself down
And fade away in golden gleam

Raindrops fall
Wind blows through the dripping colours
