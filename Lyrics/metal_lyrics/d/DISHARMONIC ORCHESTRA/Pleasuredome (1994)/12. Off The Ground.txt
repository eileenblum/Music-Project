Here comes the blue
A million tears gonna tear apart
What never shuts
A million spears gonna pierce your heart
A thousand cuts
A million souls all running scared
All driven nuts

Over the moon back to my place
Off the ground to the lunar base

If I could have just one more wish
It would be a viscious fish]
