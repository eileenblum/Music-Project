Feedback screams on a twisted riff
I've got more than I could spare
The perfumed dream of  a midnight shift
With my tongue hanging loose

Where can I park my horse?

Down under in my head
I give a shit and sleep alone
Too much talking  ain't no good
Where can I park my horse

Running down with my brain opened wide
I push it hard 'till there ain't no  more
Take no advice that keeps me back
The bang, bang, bang of funeral bells

Where can I park my horse?

Rebel, rebel I never go home
I know what gets me wet
Wave on wave of body heat
Where can I park my horse?

Is it me or could it be you
If it's not you it has to be me
Gimme a dollar and you see what I do
My name's John Wayne and I live on the sea
