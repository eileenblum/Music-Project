How do I feel? I can't explain
I never knew what's going on
In my mind there's a voice
That's telling me the meaning of life

The heat makes me sick I gotta stay
I check the pain that can't be found
Theres comes the moment that never lasts
I fasten my seatbelts but I don't care

I am the one to blame
I'm like an endless pain
But the truth beyond it says
Better pull yuurself apart
To point the way outside
I can't stand it no more

Into the mirror I stand and stare
And like I figure there's no one there

The sound of daylight
It's getting me nowhere
The smell of dreamtime
Has got a different flair
