I see the light
You'll never reach
It turns my mind
Until the day I die

These are the days of my life
Join me the dead shall arise
I perished alone
By the garden of sorrows
In the vale of tears
By the sick deep under

I hear, you see
The works of wisdom in my ears
I know, the way
to a higher state of mind

beyond the realms of light
I'm squealing for oblivion
I'm dressed in white
May I overcome

I've seen the light
You'll never reach
It turned my mind
Until the day I died
