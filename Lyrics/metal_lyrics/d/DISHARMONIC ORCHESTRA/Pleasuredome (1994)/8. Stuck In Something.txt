I see the light out of you
I see the day coming in
When I know it is true
I ain't walking away
How many times can I be
The face within your dream

I don't care what I see
I'll be there if you scream
I swear you lost your life
It comes disguised as blue rays
The way you stare outat me
Makes me heartbeat decrease

I'm stuck in something, I'll never be free
I can't move someone please help me

I drove a million miles
all the rooms were grey
I don't want to be nice
I think it's clever to swear
I wouldn't seek your advice
But I would look...

I told you not to be so cute
Around the block
What can I do but be impressed
Against the clock
