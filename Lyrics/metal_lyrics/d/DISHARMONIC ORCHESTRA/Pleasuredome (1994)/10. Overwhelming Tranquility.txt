Even if I act sometimes
like a split personality
I am obsessed by you
Like a polypeptide of someone elses
Mind but I know I'd better sleep
Sleep into a land where I find
The stairway to my personal void

My possession enthused a sudden voice
In a vain attempt
I leave you with this thought

Nothing isn't anything but it's
Tasteless and it's flat
nothing if  it's anything it is
Even less than that

I look around while something's in my head
Like a ton of lard
Like a death at a birthday party
I've got to spoil the fun

I don't want to bleed in vain
In a painful freeze
With a heartdisease called love
By the frozen trees
