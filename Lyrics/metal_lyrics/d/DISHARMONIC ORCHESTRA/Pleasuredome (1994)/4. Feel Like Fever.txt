I thought you were alive
You're no use to anyone
The moment you arrive
All the deeds are done
I'm heading for a break
Laughter from the ground
I'm down in deepest freeze
I'd feel like fever now

When something goes reverse
It makes me want to puke
Before scratching my back
What was I thinking of

I thought I was you
I thought I could spend my life

For a break
From the ground
In deepest freeze
I'd feel like fever now

I go reverse
I want to puke
I scratch my back
I'd feel like fever now

I feel like fire now

What time did you see it happen
One face in a purple frame
Your crime is your radiant passion
A black border around the name
Thin blue line red light flashing
the silent rules of a lonesome game

I had to get away
I checked it more than once
