A nightmare tortures my brain
Thousands die for a wrong ideology
Your thoughts remain the same
That's the end of humanity

The nuclear solution
Is dropped on your head
Radiation overdose
Makes you sick

Your lungs are decaying
Rigor mortis makes you freeze
Spirit has left your body
You will rest in peace

Poisoned clouds of toxic rain
Fill the sky
Senseless denin interrupts
Your pain your die

Successive substitution
Is the question to your answer
