I am falling from the top
I am drinking from a cup

I came in search of paradise
With much in my mind
A thousand eyeballs shake me down
The ups and downs of times to come

Satisfaction comas and goes
Biological action and it froce

A problem of leisure measured in terms
Of pain plus pleasure plus poison sperm
I wear the look of false alarm
Someone ought to twist my arm
