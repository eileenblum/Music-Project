Desecration or mother nature
Cannot be the pleasure of life

The meaning of life is in your mind
Rooting out the lungs of earth
We can't explain to mankind
Chemicals destroy the earth

We can't ignore the destruction of life
We've got to save that world
For our health and sanity
And for all to stay alive
