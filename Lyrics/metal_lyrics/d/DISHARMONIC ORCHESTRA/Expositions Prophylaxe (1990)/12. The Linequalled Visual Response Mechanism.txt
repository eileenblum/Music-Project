Stop that horse
He wears my shirt
Regret remorse
Oh, how they hurt

Yesterday I rewired the peace
The physical description fits

The broken home I left behind
And the rain fell down sad

Withering birds they only wail
In the dying gardens down below

Murder victims talk to me
Tell me all I wanna know
Their dangling receiver's telling me
We only live once there's no more
