Timeflies slide down the walls
Poundered upon progressive calls
Trembling tongues in search of taste
Shattered teeth all over the place
Served the style of a real neurotic
The easy smile of a true psychotic
No we never met before
Tangerine dreams stay for eber more
Waving voices
Falling apart
Like shadows
From the stars
Instruction furnish
My vacant mind
With tales of sorrow
Pink oceans rewind
