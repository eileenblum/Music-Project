My attempts to freeze the time
Where failours
But I have been close
Intents I had you could divine
And I'm awake
Of boring those
Who never really did approve
My actual aims
But though dance
With heard of goofy gnus of groove
And make up pecular names
In tarnce
If I stay in that distance
There will be no admittance
To another state of mind
A plain of existance
I'm watching plankton
Creeping through the grass
Safe from the whale
That's what I guess
Have not a clou
Got no idea
Doubt that they know
What happening here
