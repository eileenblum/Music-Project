Guardian angels are working for me
The devil and the deep blue sea
I beat my heart and bend all trees
By the and of the year I'm on my knees
Such a precious little dream
Can make a face behind a scream
One of three holes in a broken stone
Through gardens long since overgrown
All that filled my ears with pain
Your dirty looks beat me again
A lustfull view makes my eye explode
My heart went dead and I fell in the road
