Visions escape from your spirital waste
A conscious decision of your inner soul
Symbols trapped through convulsions of my brain
Visualized figures marching in step
Erasing my store
Forget more and more
Unlearning to spell
My own have
I can't believe
I'm calling myself
Within your mind
We are three of a kind
