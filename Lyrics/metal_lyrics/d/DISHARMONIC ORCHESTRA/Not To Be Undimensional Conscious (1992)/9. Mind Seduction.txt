Considering the river
And the concrete boots
What you saw
You din't really see
Under pressure I suggest
This is life's hard bequest
Somewhere in my head
A new age of benevolence
Dressing down to
A cool anonymity
Happily married to a eloguent feminist
Roman catholic marxist leninist
I strive for critical ability
I thrive on political activity
I'm alive in a new society
I arrive quickly and quietly
Just don't doubt your own identity
The car you drive's the family variety
