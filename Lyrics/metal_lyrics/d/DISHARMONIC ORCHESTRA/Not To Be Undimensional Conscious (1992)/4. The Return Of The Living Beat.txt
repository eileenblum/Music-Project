In a land where they all dream
They can't take you how you seem
Following a bisquit to its empire
A fatal breath stopped the horse
The creepin flesh regret remorse
Streamlined functional neat simplicity
Where the wierdos are dishing it out
Bringing back the beat to get down on the ground
Brothers and sisters they scream and shout
Cuz together they enjoy the funky ass beat sound
