No one comes to protect me
While you want me to believe
Searching the souls of the unseen
From the anger in between
There's the way out of nothing
From the shadows of disgrace
I suffer the day from abortion
When I've seen me passing away

7 days a week I try
Someone will guide me
Haunted frogs will never fly
Come on and join me

A million angels sing and cry
No one has told me
Wedding bells will ring and die
Before they drown me

You can't hide when you show me
What you want me to believe
Tearing apart out of control
Into the wave of an
Unknown hole
Take me away from the shortcut
From the distance that I fear
Leave me alone
Get your own way
Stay out of me
Never come back
