I was late and I missed the first path of my own play
But I'll thought I'll stay and try to find out
What it was about with those things I did not get so far
As seen yet!

What I found out was sobering but not really surprising
Curtain was rising
Myself performing one supervising his own performance
Not recognizing

Is this one play, is this one song?
What is my part, do I do wrong?
One change was got to come along
I will find out what must be done

See nobody who is around
Walk-on parts are thin on the ground
That is beyond me, it is rough
I faced the truth and that's enough
