Your votes go
To him who
Made it look
As shiny as his teeth
Don't waste
All your good time
By reading the
Small-print underneath

The nice guys
The bad dudes
Two horsemen
Or three -
Or were they more?
How ever
I long for the crown
And the princess I adore

Grit your teeth
I'll face the problem
By the root
Grit your teeth
Trust me it's only
For your good

If there's no agreement
I throw some sticky
Sludge and dirt
In any direction -
No matter if
Anybody's hurt

Some fellows
Took notice
They've got
A clue of how it ran
I know how to fool them
Again, again, again...
