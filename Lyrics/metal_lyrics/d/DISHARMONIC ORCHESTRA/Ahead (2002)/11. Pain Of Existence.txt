Hidden people seem to see
The way I cook the brain of thee

Sepai print of hunting dogs
Pointing out the unseen clocks

There I find myself in sorrow
Nothing's left for my tomorrow

Distorting rage of nameless people
A dark blue line of licking nipples

Hard to get from the unknown
Eyes work hard with tears that drown
I take control when I will peer
I see the pain of northern fear
