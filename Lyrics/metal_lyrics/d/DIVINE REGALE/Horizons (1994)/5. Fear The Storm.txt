[music - anderson, elliott, hill, keazer, leighton]
[lyrics - hill]

grasping
for the feet of a savior
pleading 
to be cleansed of disease
hanging on for as long as able 
drawn back by the ebb of the sea

like soldiers standing proudly
as their ancestors did before them
standing through tempest and time
shadowing those behind them
silent are they in number
to the clouds they do not yield
now forever will they slumber
fallen frail to the labored steel

if not a sound was heard
from that which had fallen
would we deny the ruins

the air is thickening
my breath is quickening
I fear the storm
I fear the storm coming
waters are rising
and the world she sighs
I fear the storm coming
and our senses numbing
I fear the storm
the sky is falling

coldness reshapes the boundaries
stealing life from beneath us
preying on our mother's womb
leaving the future to haunt us
wounds left unattended
infected by careless greed 
spreading quickly through the veins
from the stacks of the industry

the air is thickening
my breath is quickening
I fear the storm
I fear the storm coming
waters are rising
and the world she sighs
I fear the storm 

off in the distance
the man on the moon
a silent witness

[repeat chorus]
