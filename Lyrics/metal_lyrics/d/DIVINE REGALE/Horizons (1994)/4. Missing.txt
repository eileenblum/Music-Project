[music - anderson, elliott, keazer, leighton]
[lyrics - hill]

cradled within a hand
she finds the strength to stand
she reaches out with both hands
to caress a face she can't understand

a world she can't find
she knows in her mind
she can see it so clearly

but when the hour glass spills
its last grains of sand 
she must turn it over
and continue her life
before the dream began

have you seen me?

when you escape
into your castle of sand
do you find me
among the pictures on the wall?
do you fall to your knees?
can you tell me who I am?

mourning by a sullen door
mother collapses to the floor
crippled from the stolen years
captured memories stained in tears
once held the future
now it's lost in years
cradle still for many years

have you seen me?

when you escape
into your castle of sand
do you find me
among the pictures on the wall?

do you fall to your knees?
can you tell me who I am?
