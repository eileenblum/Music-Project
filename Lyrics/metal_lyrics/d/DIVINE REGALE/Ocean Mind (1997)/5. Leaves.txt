[music - divine regale]
[lyrics - leighton]

carried on the currents wave
I tried to hold on to the past
a morning breeze, 
a cold reminder
I must face what is to come
as winter calls my heart wanders
to summer memories of yesterday
I close my eyes and fear another 
year is gone

watching the leaves fall
remembering yesterday
but I can't go back now
can I stand on my own
or will I fail without you

my eyes still see the same
and what I see I can't understand
and what I've tried
so hard to gain
I feel slipping through my hands

I remember when I knew 
all the answers
It seems so long ago
now I have only memories
and I find them hard to hold
each day I try and find a reason
as it all just drifts away
I reach out...are you there?

the leaves have fallen
reach for tomorrow
while holding on to the past
can I stand on my own
or will I fail without you

we stand together
waiting on a forgotten dream
trying to justify our feelings 
but these changes
just bring us pain
