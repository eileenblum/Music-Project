[music - divine regale]
[lyrics - anderson]

stereotyped, controlled, 
and labeled
misguided youth
who's to know why
spoon fed rhymes
of today's headlines
it's far time that this subsides

dreaming of a time
without closed minds
will we see the day?
locked in a box with no key
the alternative is today's society
set me free
I'll have no part of this

stabbed in the back again
when will this lunacy 
come to and end
calculated profit
there is room for error
bias judgment
is instrumental in this

who is right, who is wrong
I've counted the ways
for far too long
we've lost the meaning
it's hard to go on believing
