Inner voice, fragile calm
Endless round of embodied soul
Cosmic vision in my dreams
It seems I was already here

Perfect union unseen strength 
Sacred joy, vibrant universe
faces East, mind is relay
Inexhaustible strength I supply

Inner voice, fragile calm
Endless round of embodied soul
Cosmic vision in my dreams
It seems I was already here

Perfect union, unseen strength
Sacred joy, vibrant universe
Calm outside,
Stillness inside
into divine supreme nectar I dive

I don't wanna everything from my own life
There's nothing I need for myself
Only honesty in peoples' smiles
and liberation from illusion of duality

Somewhere of outland my head
reaching out from the ignorance
Distant limits designate my path
to bring the light into darkness

External molecules unseen
Attraction of dancing atoms
is a miracle indeed
Nothing had sense
than opening the gates of present

During the waking state
in a pleromatic bath
We are the same Self in All
And now Portal is found
I throw the bridge across the fear
of a second...
second life's riverside
