Stop instead of running, look around
See the madness and evil everywhere
Stop instead of running, look around
Don't fear to open your eyes wider

You can choose your way on your own
Full of joy, the way without the rush
You can spread your wings and fly high, be above

Notice the self, recognize yourself
Take care of your temple
and nurture it because,
Because the goodness is hidden there
Notice the self, recognize yourself

As long as the nature reveals the signs
to find the true dimension of our life
Sing in your light
to the inner drum of your heart

As long as the nature reveals the signs

Back to the spring, to become the child
We're moving in circle to reach our rise
When the start and the end becomes unity
Touch of golden cloud will be near
