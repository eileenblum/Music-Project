Hear in this garden
Hear in this space
Immersed in the pure
possible is the attainment
of a saving grace

Sparks of desert worlds
awakes the shamans' wisdom
Prayer - their attention
dissolved the border of all thoughts

Myriads of stars
with their magnificent face
leaves reason to remain:
light will come down
It will open our heart
to bring the joy of love
if you and I were one
