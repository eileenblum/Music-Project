The night was so bright
And I was so calm
The sky passes my heart
That light, that impulse lifts me though.

I've never felt like this before,
Your voice is never-ending love
I was waiting for, I was waiting for it for so long.

I was pining away, until now
Blood boils in my veins
Our came bliss
Heart speaks in cosmic tongue, cosmic tongue.

I've never felt like this before,
Your voice is never-ending love
I was waiting for, I was waiting for it for so long.

It fell on me and touched my skin
And then I started to remind myself
Sunk island of my soul, gives me signs,

I want to find her so much, and I don't need more time.
I will do everything to make it happen..
