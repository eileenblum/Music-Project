Every hour, every day
every symbol of our names
Great flowers, golden clouds
- I can have it all

Every moment filled with joy
cosmic silence of our Mother
Magic garden of my feelings
- I can have it all

All these memories of our souls
Understanding what we've lost
Hidden courage and flying sparks of words that keeps us closer to her voice
...seeing what is false
Eyes raised up to watch our homes
The strength for searching for more
I can have it all

Every planet, penetrating waves
Every living, final lore
Endless love and you
- I can have it all
