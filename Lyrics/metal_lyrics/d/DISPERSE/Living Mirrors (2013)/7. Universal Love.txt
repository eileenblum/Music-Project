Where the primeval light reached old worlds
We were lost within embrace of cosmic warmth
Where the time breaks, beyond astral plane,
love designs elements,
everlasting expanding universe

Fields of love reveal
Universal energy sea
All rises with the waves and vibration

Unseen web extends
through the space and time
Never-ending numerical patterns
innerconnect us to the whole one

Fields of love reveal
Universal energy sea

One within all, without any division,
It wears a million faces, quick manifestations

We still sail on the open sea
to the shores of our innermost dreams
Neither birth nor death concerns us

coz our souls were always lovers
