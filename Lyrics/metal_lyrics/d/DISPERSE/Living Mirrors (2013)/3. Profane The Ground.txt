What we need to carry on
Primordial aim
Endeavour is fading though

Defending against destiny
Everything around different
Earthâs energy is depleted

This eon will end soon
only by us
If we donât look at the stream
in the fountain
Those days, this dream wants to
sleep away

Closed in form
We donât see the light
That emanates from the source
Endeavour wore off

No longer do I have
to be possessed by the mind
But sometimes tears
come when they try
to profane the ground

No longer do I have to be
possessed by the mind
But sometimes tears
come when they try
to profane the ground
I want to sleep away
This dream
Those days

This reality of greedy hunger
The nightmare is not only mine
Decadence is closer than now
Time of transition will come

No longer do I have to be
possessed by the mind
But sometimes tears
come when they try
to profane the ground
