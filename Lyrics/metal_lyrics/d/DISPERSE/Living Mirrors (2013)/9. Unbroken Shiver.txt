Dispersing Maya's shadow
I hurry home

Omnipresent energy opens a window in my head
and flies away
Another part of ego 
Reaching the shadow to regain lightness

Om
Mind-free from delusion and fear
Consciousness of eternity
Om
I'm traveling through the cosmic sea
away from here...

Astral power makes me fly,
Eternal present shows the way
Every memory is gone
Away from here

I found the key to the door of my being
The silence fills me 
I'm traveling through cosmic sea
away from here

Curtains of lights and shadows disappeared
Every sadness is dispelled
Lights of hidden joy died
Hazy carnal landscapes ended

You are me and I am you
Quiet unbroken shiver
Eternally alive eternally new peace
outside the limit of lethal form

Om
Mind-free from delusion and fear
Consciousness of eternity
Om
I'm traveling through the cosmic sea
away from here...
