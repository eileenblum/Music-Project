If I show you what I really feel
While you turn away your eyes
Will a part of me die? And even if so,
it's not something you've meant, right?

And the grief shows up
When we walk towards our course
And I won't stop

Few steps beyond
I turn around
But you are gone

There's so much beauty in this world
Sometimes I feel like my heart
is going to explode
There's so much beauty in this world
Sometimes I feel like my heart
And yours are part of it all
