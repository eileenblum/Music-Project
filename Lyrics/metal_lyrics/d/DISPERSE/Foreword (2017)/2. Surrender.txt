No guilt and no demand
No sense to comprehend
No salvation in the air
We didn't care and no one cared

You can show me your insanity
And I can show you mine
Until it doesn't feel right

There was nothing left to hide
We could see more and we felt more and more and more
There was nothing left to hide
Our own surrender

No guilt and no demand
No sense to comprehend
No stories to defend
Silly thoughts we dare to blend
No salvation in the air

You can show me your insanity
And I can show you mine
Until it doesn't feel right

There was nothing left to hide
We could see more and we felt more and more and more

...we could see more
...and we felt more
