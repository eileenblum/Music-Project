Lie, eyes astray
In doubt I'm awakened

How does my impression mold?
And how does it influence the stone's form?

Should I crave for something when I feel
When I feel I don't need it no more?
Even if you prove that I failed?

Lie, eyes astray
In doubt I'm awakened

Should I crave for something when I feel
When I feel I don't need it no more?
Even if you prove that I failed?
If I only could just see myself
See myself through you
Would the colors become different?
