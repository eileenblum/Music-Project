Hello dear stranger
I've got so much to tell you

Hopeful and tender
Is the autumn song
Comfort defender
Strikes through our wounds

And you decided
While I decided
So we keep hiding inside

So proud to ignore
Afraid to move on
And that is how the story goes
So dance with me some more
Find out why all the love
Is so grounded by this holy war of mine and yours
