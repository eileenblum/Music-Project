Drifting pictures
Caused the need to sleep again
Frozen breath keeps looking for
Another way to escape

As we walked away
All the magic is not the same
Why do we want to understand it?

Drifting pictures
Caused the need to take a step back
The place for the moment
Is the place that's not mine

As we walked away
All the magic is not the same
Why do we need to understand it?

[x2:] Shouting order
Keeps the ground much
Colder
And I never get bored with
Tightening borders
And controlling
What can't be controlled, so
Tell me
Can't you wait here?
Holding these hopes just a bit closer
Stronger, right near the border
Can't be
