Warm-hearted
Directions
We're off the map
It's just
Bad timing
So we revoke this time

No further
Connections
While spinning "how to" guides
You're right
There's a lie growing
In you and I

Hey! The day is way too short
Clocks shout and march in tether
And now you've said "stay"
- I'd rather move along
The pace can't be disrupted
So we are separated even more

Warm hearted
Intentions
- Why straying from the path?
It's just
Bad moment
The future says we lie

I know there are still
Some branches of your heart
To figure out
But our worlds are bursting at the seams
So we revoke it all

[x2:] Hey! The day is way too short
Clocks shout and march in tether
And now you've said "stay"
- I'd rather move along
The pace can't be disrupted
So we are separated even more
