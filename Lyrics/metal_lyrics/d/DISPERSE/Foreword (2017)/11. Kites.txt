Still a headache
From last night
It was valid to escape
It's not so comfy to go back

With the water
And the air in my lungs
I can make it through
I'm seeing people rushing to the moon
But I just wanna walk and watch

I'm seeing people rushing to the moon
But I just wanna walk and watch
The hearts in hover
While skies decay
