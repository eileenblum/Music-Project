Now pack your things
We can't wait
We've got no more
Time to waste
Bring the coat
Bring the faith

And I say, let's blow this place up
And I say, let's blow this place up

Left out stones and I'm gone?
Can't leave my world here, no
Wait oh, fuck it, my phone's lost
Can't go
You go
We'll talk tomorrow

Pack your things
You lead the way
We've got no more
Time to waste
Feel the drive
In your veins

You won't regret that
Through these doors you step out

Left out stones and I'm gone?
Can't leave my world here, no
Wait oh, fuck it, my phone's lost
Can't go
You go
We'll talk tomorrow

Missed out thoughts while I'm gone?
Can't leave my world here, no
Wait oh, fuck it, my phone's lost
Can't go
You go
We'll talk tomorrow
