So we ride
With no more doubt
We leave this windowpane parade

She said âI'm in love in the world so vacant
For it is all just something we will laugh atâ

Guiding lights
Oh, someone shouts
We pass this windowpane parade

She said âI'm in love in the world so shaky
For it is all just something we will laugh atâ
