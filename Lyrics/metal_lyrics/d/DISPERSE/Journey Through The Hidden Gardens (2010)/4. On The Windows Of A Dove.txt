Don't bother the signs on earth
Only those in the sky show the path
Everything's different there
Air broadens perspectives

It's the time to climb up high
It's time to feel freedom
Imagination won't do
Your eyes need enlightment

Don't ask questions without answers
You have to experience to believe
Don't hesitate, why should you?
The space needs your peace

It's the time to climb up high
It's time to feel freedom
Imagination won't do
Your eyes need enlightment
[2x]
It's time - Time [2x]
