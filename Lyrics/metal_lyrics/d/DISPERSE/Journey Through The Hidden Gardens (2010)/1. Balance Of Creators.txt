"Sun - Creator of life
Gives an energy and inspires the brave
Resist! Question!
Pay with everything you have, but be saved"
"Moon - Romantic and delicate
I lost myself in elation
Her light leads me to ecstasy
Owls worship her"

Sometimes I wonder looking at the stars
Are we the only souls in human form?
Contending with three poisons of mind
Is it only here where happiness is love
and reason for suffering ignorance?

Sun - A maker of life
Moon - Romantic and delicate

I turn to sun to brighten my mind each day [3x]
I turn to sun to brighten my mind
