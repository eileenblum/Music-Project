Mysterious, dangerous night calls me to the kingdom
Wants to devour my thoughts and body from the inside
I feel hunger, desire to explore her naked body
Something free from the city's sickness calls me

My desire is increasing
together with stars on the sky

You make my problems disappear (I become focused)
Your grace flows on my shoulders
You make me wonder if I deserve all this
Maybe I cross God's law

Entering new lands of the night
I'm afraid I won't make it 'till morning
I think I can't fight the will to explore

You make my problems disappear
Your grace flows on my shoulders
You make me wonder if I deserve all this
Maybe I cross God's law
[2x]
