For ages, human imagination
has caused a whole lot of pain to our mother Earth
To our mother Earth

Peace of masses is constantly disrupted
Greed and power turned into faith and hope (Faith and hope)
Trust and love result in destruction (Love result - destruction)
Karma of humanity in form of wars

I seek the truth with misty eyes, constantly looking ahead
Suggested lies take control over life
Trigger anxiety leading to a radical obsession
Only by disavowing evil can we reach the Garden of Eden

When I close my eyes, I wonder how long
our mother's heart will withstand human cruelty
We won't find the answer in books of wisemen,
as the answer lies in us

So not to words of dignitaries should we listen raptly,
but to nature's language awakening sensitivity to life's beauty
