Entangled in the world of illusions we create
Like a parasite, like a poison hidden deep inside
Possession as an essence
(Absorb! Devour! It's a drug!
It's death in a mindless delight)

Bored, lonely and greedy
We wouldn't make it without desires
But when everything is gone
(Emptiness will wail for drops
Madness that will come out of oceans)

On scorched ground spilled with salt and grief
New beginning will come just for a while
So that makes the circle complete,
and alongside I leave,
filled with hope for a new time

The circle's complete [6x]
