Colorful lights twinkle in my eyes
They make me feel unusually safe
Things which I've never experienced
surround me from all sides
I see a town, peacefully existing in innocent colours of life
I see an ocean filled with - with mystery up to the horizon

And suddenly it calls me, tempts me with its song
I walk through the walls of dreams enticed by its beauty

I fly among golden clouds
in a forsaken heaven where no one can find me
The wounds of past disappear
Healed with - with invisible magic of new days
Like a ship drifting through the sea fulfilled for eternity
I walk among the dreams of heaven fulfilled for eternity
