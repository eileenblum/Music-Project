They need a confidant, they need someone
who will lead them through the other side
I have a feeling their eyes are blind
Minds stained with time
Killing worlds is beauty
Not able to catch its meaning

But you are different
You save me from hell
But you are different
Take me inside you

Why are they so far from truth?
Why won't they get out of cages?
I could help you if you want
We would admire blue horizon
Why are they so far from truth?
Why won't they get out of cages?

Look at them
They're like ash, like faded stars on the sky
Yet there's hope
There's a chance, they don't know how to reach
I'd like to help you, but remember, there's no turning back

And forget who you were
And forget you ever saw them
You need to run, run from the dark past
And forget who you were
And forget you ever saw them
Spirit of age, come to me, please

And forget who you were
And forget you ever saw them
[2x]
