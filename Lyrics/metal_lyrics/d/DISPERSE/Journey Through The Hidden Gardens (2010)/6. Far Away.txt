I and many things to which there is no answer
I and a beautiful mirror in a glow of azure hues
Time seems to be passing faster,
so we play like innocent children with our tongues out
Maybe it can heal the wounds that the past inflicted
Maybe we will forget about the harm done by fate

And I can feel I'm flying lonely
Drifting in colors of my emotions

I make constant journeys of my mind
Falling asleep in the clouds of words
I can feel everything flourishing
And he always tells me to fight
And he always tells me to try
But, in fact, he doesn't know how much we differ

Can feel I'm flying lonely
Drifting in colors of my emotions
[2x]
Through the rivers of my thoughts which no ship
Through the rivers of my thoughts which no ship can cross
