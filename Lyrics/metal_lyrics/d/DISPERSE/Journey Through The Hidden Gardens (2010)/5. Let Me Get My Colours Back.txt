Someone once told me that forgive is to suffer
Every day I watched him destroy his life
I even learned to live with it
I learned to live with hope
But when (But when)
The end came (The end came)
Despite the pain I rubbed in me,
I didn't want my suffering to end

Why can't I run away from your anger?
It's just love and sense of my blame
Maybe I've lost bad dreams in exchange for forgiveness
So please, don't tell me now that you need me
[2x]
Let me get my colours back

Why can't I run away from your anger?
It's just love and sense of my blame
Maybe I've lost bad dreams in exchange for forgiveness
So please, don't tell me now that you need me
Why can't I?
