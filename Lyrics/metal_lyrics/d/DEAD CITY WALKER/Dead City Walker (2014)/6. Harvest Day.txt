The cold wind blows breaking the silence
Dark wings bring the shadows
Iâm watching the birth of a blood red sky
On the battlefield the fear confronts our minds

We are lost
And dropping like flies
Death walks beside us
But today is not a good day to die

I see an imminent death coming close
But itâs a point of no return
Just keep the eyes wide open
Ready or not, itâs the harvest dayâ¦
Try to survive

All things we have ever seen
Seem like sparks in the dark
