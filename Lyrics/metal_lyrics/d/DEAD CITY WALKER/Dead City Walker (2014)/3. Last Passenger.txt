I came from the past bringing the fear
A perfect traveler through the years
Can you see the void in your choices?
Can you hear the sound of my voice?

Now I am the fire
Now I am in your mind
Now I am a nightmare
Now Iâm rising from the dead

I am the last passenger
Running through the night
I am the last passenger
Riding through the dark

I came from the past bringing the balance
I will tear the mask that you created
My eyes shine like pictures in flames
My words sound like thunders and rage
