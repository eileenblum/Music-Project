Here I am
Immersed in dark waters
My tired lungs ... Need some relief

All this chainsâ¦ Tying up my feet
Iâm trying to hold my breath
Just a little more

Immersedâ¦ Alone in the dark

Here I am
Immersed in dark waters
all this darknessâ¦ Talking to me

Iâm blind, Iâm dying
This disturbing place
Feeds my painâ¦ Again and again
