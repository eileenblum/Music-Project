Iâve been awake for a few days
Learning from my frustrations
Ill and tired in so many ways
In the cage of expectations

Surrounded by people and feeling alone
Sometimes it's hard to be strong
Inside this grave
I see the weed of isolation

What is real?
In this state there are no dealsâ¦

Digging like a worm to find a way out
the reward is my own life
Iâm running against the time

My feet are sinking in this mud
I need air, peace, and food
Thereâs no wind just my cold sweat
Iâm alone but Iâm not dead

When I look up high
A little crack feeds my eyes
Light breaks through the thick layer of dark
