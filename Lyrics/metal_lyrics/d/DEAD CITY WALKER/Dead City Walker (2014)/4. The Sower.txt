I feed the images of your eyes
And steal the colors of the skies
I put you up side down and change your thoughts
Making you bleed till the last drop

Only humans sow war and pain
Like black flames burning the seeds of revenge

Wake up!
Donât you know who I am?
Wake up!
Donât you know who the sower is?

My face can be the bringer of rage
A strange sign on an erased page
Iâm the tear in the eye of the widow
A deadly creature hunting in the shadows

I see the death walking through this shadow land
A lonely shepherd holding the hands
of the chosen ones
