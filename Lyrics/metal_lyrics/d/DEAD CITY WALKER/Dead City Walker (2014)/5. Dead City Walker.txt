Out in the streetsâ¦ The cold freezes my bones
if I believed in destiny
I could say itâs playing too rough
Iâm braving the life and riding on the wind

I come from a distant land
My future lies in my hands

Iâm a dead city walkerâ¦
Crossing the mist and following my way
Iâm a dead city walkerâ¦
Passing through the darkness like a hurricane

I feel the blood flowing through my veins
The venomous waltz was broken again
Scarecrows are guarding the crossroad
Their smiles seem like deep black holes

When the fear goes too far
Itâs easy losing control
I am in command of my life
and move like a raging storm
