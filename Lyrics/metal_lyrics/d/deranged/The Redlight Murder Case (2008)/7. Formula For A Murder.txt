you all die, you all die, no one survive, you die

cut and stab then placed with the rest
dumping ground undiscovered for years
hacked with axe, the same to your legs
I wrap you up, you are fucking dead

you all die, you all die, no one survive, you die

no fucking mercy shown, you are piece of flesh
you will end like the rest
piercing pain of screaming, when skin and flesh is bleeding

you all die, you all die, no one survive, you die

suffocate, strangulate, dark sudden death
no sympathy, I place you with the rest
cut carve rip serve
no coffin or funeral, just maggots in the mud
in a pit of filth and misery, I'll let you fucking rot alone
your head, cut and fuck an place with the rest

pain, there's a formula for murder, obey, killing season, time for slaughter

too young to die, you will

end up dead in a garbage can
slaughter feast, a dance of the dead
morbid stalker ambush approach
watch me cut, a dance of the dead

you all die, you all die, no one survive, you die

cut and stab then placed with the rest
dumping ground undiscovered for years
hacked with axe, the same to your legs
I wrap you up, you are fucking dead
no fucking mercy shown, you are piece of flesh
you will end like the rest
piercing pain of screaming, when skin and flesh is bleeding

pain, there's a formula for murder, obey, killing season, time for slaughter
pain, there's a formula for murder, obey, killing season, time for slaughter

despise your putrid world and what it stands for, the world is a sewer, pain

invocation of the sick, a flourishing demise, a state of satisfaction
where I decide who live or die, execute, retribute, time to kill the pain of life
instant death solution, claimed with a butchering knife

a burning urge inside of me, time to raise some hell, another hunting season
swallow your pride, final swift incision, man made design
hand carved assasination, carve out vital signs
