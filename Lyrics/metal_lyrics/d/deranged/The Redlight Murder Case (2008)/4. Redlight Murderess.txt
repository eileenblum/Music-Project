stalk you, end up dead, backally rendezvous
red light murderess, stalk you, end up dead

red lights burning, creeps and crawling, flourishing demise
cut through this filth, open your veins, smear with the blood
smear with the blood

stalk you, end up dead

backally rendezvous, stalk you end up dead
backally rendezvous, stalk you end up dead

you will struggle, I will stab you, final breath demise
hands are tied and limbs will stretch, watch you fucking die

watch you fucking die

with gloves and knives, features dissolve and now repulse

this world, these streets need cleansing
I'm a self acclaimed solution
no god or faith to judge me
I'm a self acclaimed solution

hands to face to save yourself, beaty of the blade
ain't no reason, same sex treason, never to get caught

cut carve rip serve

a razorblade symphony, I play for the dead

this world, these streets need cleansing
I'm a self acclaimed solution
no god or faith to judge me
I'm a self acclaimed solution

In a backalley waiting, look upon my prey
long to see you dead
twitching and crawlig
begging to die

you will struggle, I will stab you, final breath demise
hands are tied and limbs will stretch, watch you fucking die

stalk you, end up dead, backally rendezvous
red light murderess, stalk you, end up dead

a terror in the streets, red lights burning bright
another fucking whore, find her torn and dead
a violated piece of human fucking meat
