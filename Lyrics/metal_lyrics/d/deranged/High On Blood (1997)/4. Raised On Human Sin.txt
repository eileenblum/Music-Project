[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n / Lyric: R. WermÃ©n]

Violate my weak human flesh
Scream!
Painfilled pleasure
As I cum'
Give birth to another weak devil child
My body spread deadly disease
Disease, raised on human sin
Cut my weak human flesh
Scream!
Painfilled pleasure

Worship your world
So full of filth and suffering
Everyday life so insecure and fine
Real predators never get what they deserve
Just a matter of kill and rape again

Worship evil
Found in your perfect world
Fools!
Raised on lies
Consuming filth with pathetic greed
Given to me by human sin

Worship your world
So full of filth and suffering
Everyday life so insecure and fine
Real predators never get what they deserve
Just a matter of kill and rape again

Forever let insanity reign

Worship evil
Found in your perfect world
Fools!
Raised on lies
Consuming filth with pathetic greed
Given to me by human sin
