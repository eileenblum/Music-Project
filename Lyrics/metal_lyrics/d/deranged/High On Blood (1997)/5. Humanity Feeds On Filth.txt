[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n, D. Bengtsson / Lyric: R. WermÃ©n]

Mankind as you know it ceases to exist
Cut the vein, reaching orgasm through pain
Poor humans you're lost, there's no hope
Natural born hellraiser, so god damn I'm raising hell

Pain reaching pleasure

The peak of sickness, your normal reality
Let violence spawn violence
An anal orgy, baptized in blood
Pain reaching pleasure
Beauty hides the beast

Coagulated menstrual blood still cover your legs
Excremental orgy, muscles getting stronger
Images of total penetration as I'm piercing my manhood dreams

Coagulated menstrual blood still cover your legs
Excremental orgy, muscles getting stronger
Images of total penetration as I'm piercing my manhood dreams

Humanity feeds on filth
Long to be a part of it
Rapes another anal god
Muscle getting harder
Forces to unleash the rage you all feast upon
Underneath your normal reality, my filth will be found

Mankind as you know it ceases to exist
Cut the vein, reaching orgasm through pain
Poor humans you're lost, there's no hope
Natural born hellraiser, so god damn I'm raising hell

Pain reaching pleasure

The peak of sickness, your normal reality
Let violence spawn violence
