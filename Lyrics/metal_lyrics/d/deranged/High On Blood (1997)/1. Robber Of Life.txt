[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n  /  Lyric: R. WermÃ©n]

Something inside of me, keep pushing me
Excitement
You have something I want
Life

Something inside of me, keep pushing me
Excitement
You have something I want
Life

Fuck her wound as I cut her throat
Killing for me is like breathing for everyone else
Can't live without doing it all the time
All the time

Something inside of me, keep pushing me
Excitement
You have something I want
Life

Forcing sticks up her cunt
Scream in agony, begging for mercy
All fucked up
I'm a robber of life, author pain
Watch the world die

Forcing sticks up her cunt
Scream in agony, begging for mercy
All fucked up
I'm a robber of life, author pain
Watch the world die

No control, I let my mind act
Cut her throat as I'm forcing my cock up her tight ass

I'll forever live my life the way I've always done, bucther among pigs

Kill, rape, mutilate
Masturbate, as I think of the acts
The bitch I slaughtered, a cunt I could never tolerate

Kill, rape, mutilate
Masturbate, as I think of the acts
The bitch I slaughtered, a cunt I could never tolerate
