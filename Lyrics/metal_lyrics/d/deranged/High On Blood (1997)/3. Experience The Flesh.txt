[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n / Lyric: R.  WermÃ©n]

Sweet holiness
Lord of flesh, hunger and desire
My God

Blind I always serve
Blind I always obey
Blind I always live
Blind I always kill
Lies, this world raised on lies
Experience the flesh

Vaginal juices made up by blood
Penetrating this sinful cave
Spawns a new demon world through darkest rage
It's your flesh I want to experience
Time to play

Blind I always serve
Blind I always obey
Blind I always live
Blind I always kill

Lies, this world raised on lies / Experience the flesh

Mortals are such fools
I prey and long for legalization
Legalize this pain I bring
Take part in my ancient greed
Oh victims, have mercy with me
