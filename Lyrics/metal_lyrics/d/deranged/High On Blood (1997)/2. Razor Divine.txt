[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n, D. Bengtsson / Lyric: D. Bengtsson]

I can't escape from all the hate
I'm wallowing in blood
Crawling through filth
My mind is under siege

I will rise
Rise again

I will improve the world
I will terminate, the human race
Red streams wherever I go
Noise turns to silence
Silence turns to rage

Razor divine
Razor divine
Razor divine
Domination

I can't escape from all the hate
I'm wallowing in blood
Crawling through filth
I will rise
Rise again

In burning frustration I cut
You're impure, crying in vain

Watch the blood you bleed ripple
Silence is all that remains

Razor divine
Razor divine
Razor divine
Domination
