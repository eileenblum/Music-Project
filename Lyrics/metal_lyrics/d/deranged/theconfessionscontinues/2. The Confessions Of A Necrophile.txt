I squeeze out the energetic streams of necrosis.
Out of the anus, into the mouth.
Now it' sodomizing time.
My penis is now ingreased with membranaceous.
Necrosis, my organ so stiff, can hardly wait
piercing the dead corpse anus.

Confessions of a necophile.
Humanity lies far below my mental sense.

Gallbladder starts to leak.
As the seed starts crying.

Confessions of a necophile.
Humanity lies far below my mental sense.

After sexual intercourse, only hunger remains.
Your urinating isn't what it used to be.
How it's used as a straw,
To suck out the contents of your female genital organ.

Confessions of a necophile.
Humanity lies far below my mental sense.

Gallbladder starts to leak.
As the seed starts crying.

Confessions of a necophile.
Humanity lies far below my mental sense.

With my bizarre lust,
I entangle your limbs,
as I guess my seed.
