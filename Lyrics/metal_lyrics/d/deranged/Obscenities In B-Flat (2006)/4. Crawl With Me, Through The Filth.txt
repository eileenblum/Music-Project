Standing proud fuckin' standing straight
Look at the pain your god create
Media whores fuckin' feeds the hate

Resurrect the darkest age
Profit minds deliever the rage
Pain an' sorrow, misery we spawn
A spell is cast upon you all

Fire burnin', kill the norm
Pain an' sorrow, misery we spawn
Cut, carve, rip, serve

Peoples misery, a visual feast
The day of reckoning is fuckin' here
Primitive culture based on filth
Look at the pain you create

Die, die
Crawl with me
Through the filth
Suffocate
Incinerate
Crawl with me
Through the filth
Suffocate

Weak minds under attack.
I see beauty, I want to kill
