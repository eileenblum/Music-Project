Drooling, like a lobotomized dog / Crawling, kill yourself for crumbs
I remember a time when fiction was fact. / The world you offer ainÂ´t nothing but crap.
Tie the chains. Turn the clockworks back.
Blood, coming in streams, ecstasy reached. / In the coven of death
You, living chains, illusion is real. / In the coven of death.
Die, experience pain, a nazarene slay. / In the coven of death.
Look, fiction is fact, living a lie. / In the coven of death.
You will enter death's domain. / I, protect and serve a life of pain.
Blood, coming in streams, ecstasy reached. / In the coven of death
You, living chains, illusion is real. / In the coven of death.
Die, experience pain, a nazarene slay. / In the coven of death.
Look, fiction is fact, living a lie. / In the coven of death.
