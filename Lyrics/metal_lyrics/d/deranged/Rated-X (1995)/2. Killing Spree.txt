[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n / Lyric: P. GyllenbÃ¤ck]

"I am still here, like a spirit roaming the night
Thirsty, hungry, seldom stopping the rest
I am the monster
I am Beelzebub"

A fictional reality inside my mind
Where savagery grows to the utter experience

Killing spree
Killing spree
Killing spree
Killing spree

Unblushed, unpure, erection is close
Now my white rum curls
Unblushed, unpure, erection is close
Now my white rum curls

A fictional reality inside my mind
Where savagery grows to the utter experience
