[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n / Lyric: P. GyllenbÃ¤ck]

Semen demon, tickle my urethra
Squelching out my cesspool of semen
Repulsive to you it might seem
Possessed by the semen demon I am

Tickle, tickle my urethra
Demon climax I reach
Tickle, tickle my urethra
Demon climax I reach

Piercing deeper through your muggy cave
Your sloppy breasts keeps dashing into the razors
Unblushed the demon takes his share
His horns and claws shreds the virgin skin

I hail you demon of tickling climax semen
As I spit blood, semen and piss in your face
I hail you demon of tickling climax semen
As I spit blood, semen and piss in your face

Piercing deeper through your muggy cave
Your sloppy breasts keeps dashing into the razors
Unblushed the demon takes his share
His horns and claws shreds the virgin skin
