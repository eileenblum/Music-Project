[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n / Lyric: P. GyllenbÃ¤ck]

Through the clitoris it goes
Your mammary glands, I'll split into two
Blocking the entrance to the eternal opening
Of the urine tube - infernal vaginal bleeding

Eyes they stare as limbs and bones are crushed
I'm the bonebreaker of Jehovah

Through the clitoris it goes
Your mammary glands, I'll split into two
Blocking the entrance to the eternal opening
Of the urine tube - infernal vaginal bleeding

Your lilywhote lips I grease with seminal fluids
Pierce them with needles, makes them liver gray
Out of the urine tube, urine and blood gushes out
Alike a colorful rainbow stream

With my tongue sharp as razor I cut and cut
Not unlike a drill I much and lick

Eyes they stare as limbs and bones are crushed
I'm the bonebreaker of Jehovah

Through the clitoris it goes
Your mammary glands, I'll split into two
Blocking the entrance to the eternal opening
Of the urine tube - infernal vaginal bleeding

I can't hide my misery
I know my sorrow can't set me free
She did it to me
