[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n / Lyric: P. GyllenbÃ¤ck]

In emptiness I roar
Running for my life
Piles of lacerated bodies surrounds me

Spitting piss, I'm the love undertaker
Worm-eaten bitches, light cuts into scares
Last time I cried bowels were rotting in decay
I build, you pay
Gods undertaker I am

Sludge, piss, shit, fuck, decay and urine

In emptiness I roar
Running for my life

Spitting piss, I'm the love undertaker
Worm-eaten bitches, light cuts into scares
Last time I cried bowels were rotting in decay
I build, you pay
Gods undertaker I am
