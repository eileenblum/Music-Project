[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n / Lyric: P. GyllenbÃ¤ck]

As a wolf I choose my victims
As a wolf I carve them up
As a wolf I carve them up
As a wolf I carve them up
As a wolf I carve them up
As a wolf I carve them up

Killing, slashing, raising hell
Hacking, slicing, raising hell
As a wolf howling in the night
Beelzebub fucking feed me

With razors and spikes
I ferociously carve you up

As a wolf howling in the night
Beelzebub fucking feed me

Killing, slashing, raising hell
Hacking, slicing, raising hell
As a wolf howling in the night
Beelzebub fucking feed me

As a wolf I choose my victims
As a wolf I carve them up
