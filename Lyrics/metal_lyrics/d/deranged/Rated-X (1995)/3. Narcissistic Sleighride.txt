[Music: J Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n / Lyric: P. GyllenbÃ¤ck]

In the deepest chambers of my mind
My savagery goes blind

Pleasure through pain is how ecstasy reaches climax
With my tongue razor sharp, slicing you piece by piece

With my bizarre lust, I entangle your lust
As I grease my seed

Pleasure through pain is how ecstasy reaches climax
With my tongue razor sharp, slicing you piece by piece

In the deepest chambers of my mind
My savagery goes blind

Fuck, kill, piss, shit
Fuck, kill, piss, shit
