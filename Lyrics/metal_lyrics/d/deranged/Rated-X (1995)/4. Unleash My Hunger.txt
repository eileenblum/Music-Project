[Music: J. Axelsson, R. WermÃ©n / Lyric: P. GyllenbÃ¤ck]

Unleash my hunger
Drawn up entrails
Through the stomach
And hiss them out between the tooth

Thundermother play your drums
Let the bubbles float and burst
Sell me a piece of your holyground
And my mind shall never weaken
Drain my, humiliate me / In menstrual blood

Unleash my hunger
Drawn up entrails
Through the stomach
And hiss them out between the tooth
