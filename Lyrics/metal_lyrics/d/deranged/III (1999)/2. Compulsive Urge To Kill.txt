[Music: J. Axelsson, R. Wermï¿½n  /  Lyric: R. Wermï¿½n]

Compulsive urge to kill

Compulsive urge to kill, home of the loving dead
Recycle human remains, fatal stabbing

Compulsive urge to kill, innocence ignored

Compulsive urge to kill, innocence ignored
What's to ignore when there's only guilt
Not a shred of evidence
Phenomenal carnivores walk this earth
Go kill, kill. kill
Hell where I was meant to be, feast on insanity

My nocturnal killing adventures
Nihilistic and out for the sake of guilt
Rebirth the feast of inhumanity
Nihilistic and out for the sake of...
Guilt

Nude and strangled

Pride, greed, sloth, wrath, gluttony, lust, envy
Hell, I live

Compulsive urge to kill, home of the loving dead
Innocence ignored
What's to ignore when there's only guilt
Hell where I was meant to be
Feast on insanity
Feast on insanity

Feast on insanity

Their feast on human remains, glorifies the virgin whore
Ruler of this withered world

Their feast on human remains, glorifies the virgin whore
Ruler of this withered world
Pride, greed, sloth, wrath, gluttony, lust, envy
Hell, I live

Compulsive urge to kill, home of the loving dead
Recycle human remains, fatal stabbing
