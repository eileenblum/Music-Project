[Music: J. Axelsson, R. Wermï¿½n  /  Lyric: R. Wermï¿½n]

To hunt and lurk in the dark
is to kill the light, to fear the day
and penetrate the night
Decay, left the corpse in ruins
Randomize killing
Another revival of that mortal flesh

Facing the mirror, staring death in its eyes
Facing the mirror, see nothing but disgust

Human beings exist just to humiliate
and kill their own kind
To feast of the suffering of others
and respawn the killing mind
Like slime they was meant to suffer
Carve another piece from the newborn child

Facing the mirror, staring death in its eyes
Semen explodes, she cuts her up
Facing the mirror, see nothing but disgust
The queen of all anals rapes the tied up fuck all over again

Facing the mirror, staring death in its eyes
Semen explodes, she cuts her up
Facing the mirror, see nothing but disgust
The queen of all anals rapes the tied up fuck all over again... now

Flesh filled sins strengthen me

Flesh filled sins strengthen me
Revealed my pain, purest death
Death tripping, blood soaked limbs
Death tripping, razor filled cunt
So beautiful as she took that virgins life
Limb from bloody limb

Decay, left the corpse in ruins
Randomize killing
Another revival of that mortal flesh

Death tripping, blood soaked limbs
Death tripping, razor filled cunt

To hunt and lurk in the dark
is to kill the light, to fear the day
and penetrate the night
Decay, left the corpse in ruins
Randomize killing
Another revival of that mortal flesh

Death tripping, blood soaked limbs
Death tripping, razor filled cunt
