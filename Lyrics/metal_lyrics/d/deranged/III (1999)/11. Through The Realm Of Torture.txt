[Music: J. Axelsson, R. Wermï¿½n  /  Lyric: J. Anderberg]

I feed on fear, my mind obsessed by human hate
I will eradicate, the mindless I devour

Nail down, open vein, enslave, devour

I feed on fear, my mind obsessed by human hate
I will eradicate, the mindless I devour
While seeking entry to the world of tortured flesh
I will bring violence to those who disbelieve

Nail down, open vein, enslave, devour
Extreme, unconscious, depraved, ripped open

I feed on fear and torture, submit to human flaw
Remain grotesque the inner savage scream
Extract the lust your fear will bring to me
Rip the skin, enter the realm of torture

Nail down, open vein, enslave, devour

I feed on fear and torture, submit to human flaw
Remain grotesque the inner savage scream
Extract the lust your fear will bring to me
Rip the skin, enter the world of torture

Torture
