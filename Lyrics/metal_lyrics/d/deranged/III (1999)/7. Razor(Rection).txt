[Music: J. Axelsson, R. Wermï¿½n  /  Lyric: R. Wermï¿½n]

Dormant I gaze upon death, I hail your flesh
Ages since I wanted to live, Ill spawn pain

Ill spawn pain

Ill make you a servant in a world of slaves
I define his world of shit
Ill make you a servant in a world of slaves
I define his world of shit

Unworthy to once again feel life
Unworthy to walk the edge of the knife
Unworthy to experience plain death
Unworthy to walk this globe of shit

So eager to hail being which are better off dead
In this world of slime we rage
No expulsive motive,
just to kill and drain your pieces of flesh again
Unworthy to once again feel life
Unworthy to walk the edge of the knife
Unworthy to experience plain death
Unworthy to walk this globe of shit

So eager to hail being which are better off dead
In this world of slime we rage
No expulsive motive,
just to kill and drain your pieces of flesh again

You're nothing but an ugly piece of filthy meat
A whore and I'm more then eager to see you down on your knees
Licking your wounds
You, a worthless piece of flesh

Ill spawn pain, Ill reserve death
You, a worthless piece of flesh
Hail the mortal agony
I define this world of shit
