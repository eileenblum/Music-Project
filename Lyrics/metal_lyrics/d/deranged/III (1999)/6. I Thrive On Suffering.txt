[Music: J. Axelsson, R. Wermï¿½n  /  Lyric: J. Anderberg]

From hatred I emerge, reborn in flesh, awake my bloodlust
I thrive on suffering, dispatching my horde, evolve humanity
Infect the hysterical, isolate defeat, refuel my hatred
Systematic killing spree, capable of worse, nurture the blood
I thrive on suffering, dispatching my horde, evolve humanity
Infect the hysterical, isolate defeat, refuel my hatred

Redeem, on fire, evolve, empire, awake, Messiah, infest

On the virge of insanity I reap my ill-will
Tear down my empire, infest it with doom
Why I bleed fire is my enigma
Lustful dreams of flesh inhabit my mind
On the virge of insanity I reap my ill-will
Tear down my empire, infest it with doom
Why I bleed fire is my enigma
Lustful dreams of flesh inhabit my mind

From hatred I emerge, reborn in flesh, awake my bloodlust
I thrive on suffering, dispatching my horde, evolve humanity
Infect the hysterical, isolate defeat, refuel my hatred
Systematic killing spree, capable of worse, nurture the blood
