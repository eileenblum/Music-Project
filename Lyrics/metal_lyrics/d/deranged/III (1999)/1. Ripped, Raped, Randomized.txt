[Music: J. Axelsson, R. Wermï¿½n  /  Lyric: R. Wermï¿½n]

Disciples, you who breathe for me
You who carries vulnerable flesh
Always the hunter, never the prey
Disciples, you're the hunters
Go and feed
Always the hunters, never the prey

After dawn, ending up wrapped in plastic
Demons of filth lurks
Murder your own kind
Expandable
Fresh meat, deceased meat

Ripped, raped, randomized
Randomized
Ripped, raped, randomized
Randomized

Chopping up the corpses
That possessed my mortal life
I'm taking form, nightmares taking form
Nightmares taking form
Chopped limbs, drained of human life
Drained of human life
Ripped, raped, randomized
Ripped, raped, randomized
Chopping up the corpses
That possessed my mortal life
I'm taking form, nightmares taking form
Nightmares taking form
Ripped, raped, randomized

Chopping up the corpses
That possessed my mortal life
I'm taking form, nightmares taking form
Ripped, raped, randomized

Chopping up the corpses
That possessed my mortal life
I'm taking form, nightmares taking form
Nightmares taking form
Chopped limbs, drained of human life
Drained of human life
Ripped, raped, randomized

Chopping up the corpses
That possessed my mortal life
I'm taking form, nightmares taking form
Chopped limbs, drained of human life
Ripped, raped, randomized
