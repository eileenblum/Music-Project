[Music: J. Axelsson, R. Wermï¿½n  /  Lyric: R. Wermï¿½n]

Laugh at human tragedies
Brought back to life through filth
Laugh at human tragedies
Eye for an eye as they preach
Laugh at human tragedies
No casualties, only death
Laugh at human tragedies
Laugh with fear

Out of sense
Intense beating
Feasting on terror
Violate life

Violent abusing
Feasting on terror

Gathered, awaitin` another orgy of disgusted artificial manholes
The meek shall be castrated and scratch the gate to their tomb

Gathered, awaitin` another orgy of disgusted artificial manholes
Like a fool plague humanity hadn't faced for decades

Gathered, awaitin` another orgy of disgusted artificial manholes
As they re-spawn the inner core of murdering

Out of sense
Intense beating
Feasting on terror
Violate life
