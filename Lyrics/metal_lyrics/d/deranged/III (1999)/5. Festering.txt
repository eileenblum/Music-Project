[Music: J. Axelsson, R. Wermï¿½n  /  Lyric: R. Wermï¿½n]

Festering spawn will procreate among rotting limbs
Incision
Heart, heart keep on pumping, serve me that mortal fluid I crave
A pool of blood, ejaculating, death throes

Breeding violence, inferior to what's left of that mortal flesh
Natures primitive instinct control another vicious act of sadism
Instead of consuming the dead, I fuck what's left of their ruined corpse
Cut, carve, rip, serve

Cut, carve, rip, serve
I fuck and eat that putrid thing
Behold human, vulnerable shape

Breeding violence, inferior to what's left of that mortal flesh
Natures primitive instinct control another vicious act of sadism
Instead of consuming the dead, I fuck what's left of their ruined corpse
Cut, carve, rip, serve

Razor cuts and carve
Even more odious then what the wound was meant to be fucked
Hunting human violence for visual pleasure
Hunting human violence for visual pleasure

Asphyxiate
Nightmares turns to joy as sperm unleashes another horrid act of
pure violence

Asphyxiate
Nightmares turns to joy as sperm unleashes another horrid act of
pure violence

Razor cuts and carve
Even more odious then what the wound was meant to be fucked
Hunting human violence for visual pleasure
Hunting human violence for visual pleasure

Breeding violence
Instead of consuming the dead, I fuck what's left of their ruined corpse

Razor cuts and carve
Even more odious then what the wound was meant to be fucked

Hunting human violence for visual pleasure
Hunting human violence for visual pleasure

Death throes

Death throes

Violently abused, harsh punishment, vile and infectious life
Feeding their need for filth every single day
Disruptive world

Violently abused
Harsh punishment
Death throes

Festering spawn will procreate among rotting limbs
Incision
Heart, heart keep on pumping, serve me that mortal fluid I crave
A pool of blood, ejaculating, death throes
Death throes
