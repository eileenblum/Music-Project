[Music: J. Axelsson, R. Wermï¿½n  /  Lyric: R. Wermï¿½n]

Horrifying to you it might seem
Disgusted towards what always been
No casualties, only death
Violation evoke what perversion brought

Such a pitiful race
Consume, excrete, dwell
Procreation without lust
Consume, excrete, dwell
Fear
Consume, excrete, dwell
Virginlike, still full of filth

Fear

In a pit of filth they gather
Never to confess their acts
Wallow in their own cum as I violate

No innocence found
I kill, I slash, I mutilate, I rape
Drain you of life

No innocence found
I kill, I slash, I mutilate, I rape
Drain you of life

"All gathered in withered sewers of concentrated filth
As one with the edge of the razor I cleanse
Human life such a waste of artificial obscenities..."
Cleanse another shape through slaughtering

Such a pitiful race
Consume, excrete, dwell
Procreation without lust
Consume, excrete, dwell
Fear

Fear
