[Music: J. Axelsson, R. Wermï¿½n  /  Lyric: J. Anderberg]

Cold and methodical
Selfmade - superior
Enslaved by sin
Survive in blood
I aim to kill

Cold and methodical
Selfmade - superior

Convulse
Nailed down
Scarred for - life

This rotten world I rule
Set filth on fire
Overt and calculating
Kill for the thrill
Revise and control me
Become my acts
I see what you can be
In my dominion

Convulse, nailed to the floor
Scarred for life
Killed in captivity
Watch myself die

Thrill kill

I sold my soul to the demon
Become the slave
My acts enlightened by god
No price for pride
Intense and disgruntled
My heart is black
I'm armed with stainless steel
I hate the world itself

Thrill kill
