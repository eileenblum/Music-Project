Hidden evil

The controversial is feeding my system
My rage is now complete
Endorse suspended animation
Become the hidden evil
The controversial is feeding my system
My rage is now supreme
The paramount of savagery
Icon of murder

Must stimulate the most primal rage
Become an icon of murder
Suffocate the fools, diverted by sin
What lies behind must be hidden
Erase the last trace of humanity
Imam the icon of murder

Severe and violent, expand inhuman form
My rage is now complete, erase the infernal
Endorse suspended animation
Canonized by ancient evil
Icon of murder

Formaldehyde bath, acid blood sample
Twitching, rotten, convulse
Life in depravity, icon of murder
