Putrefactive fly blown and raw.
Removing the dead from the earth.
Dry retching fumes I inhale.
Desecrate the dead from their graves.

Decomposed, deceased and devoured.
Bode decomposed I adore.

To please those addicted to death.
Deceased and devoured.

Skin it lifts, bursts and breaks.
We are the ones you despise.
Skin it lifts, bursts and breaks.
I attack and the skull I crack.

Decomposed, deceased and devoured.
We lure and abduct, to murder and fuck.
Decomposed, deceased and devoured.
We lure and abduct, to murder and fuck.

Putrefactive fly blown and raw.
Removing the dead from the earth.
Dry retching fumes I inhale.
Desecrate the dead from their graves.

To please those addicted to death.
Deceased and devoured.

We lure and abduct, to murder and fuck.
Handpicked from the scum of the earth.
Rancid corpse, no remorse. Delivering the goods.
Skin in lifts, bursts and breaks.
We are the ones you despise.
Skin it lifts, bursts and breaks.
I attack and the skull I crack.

Watch you undress and I survey your house.
I see you through ill willing eyes.
We are the ones they fear in the night.
The shadows that moves in the dark.
