God is dead.
I'm through seeking answers.
I've had it up to my neck.
All my life been stabbed.
in the mother fucking back.
Misled by Belial, way up above.
I spit on the ruins of what my life became.

God is dead.

Nice daily rituals, blood on your hands, killing time.
A dope friend son whose mother does nothing
but snorting white shit up her plastic nose.

Sell the house, kill the kids.
Tell Satan I'm on my way home.
I?ll keep on killing in the name of liberty.

I?ll keep on killing in the name of liberty,
through the Promised Land.
Never coming back.

Your God is dead.

I'm through seeking answers. I've had it up to my neck.
All my life been stabbed in the mother fucking back.
Misled by Belial, way up above.
I spit on the ruins of what my life became.

Walk into the tomb where purgatory awaits.
Sodomy, this lord I penetrate.
We?re all chasing dragons is the name of God.
Six, six, six. / God is dead.

God is dead.

No more the scapegoat, evil is transformed.
I rape the sluts and kill the pigs.
Show the masses what I'm worth.
I beg for pain, evil done.

God is dead.
God is dead.

God is dead.
