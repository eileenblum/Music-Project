Suffering, the sweet, sweet suffering.
Back to life, back to hell.
Your flesh and blood I exterminate.
Penetrate, your flesh and blood I penetrate.
Not single wound healed.
I live for blood. I live for pain.

Suffering
Pain

In total anguish I raised my voice.
Let my body be an instrument of filth.
In life and hell.

Suffocate, in life and hell we?ll suffocate.
Step into my world and feel the rage.
Exterminate long live human pain.
Masturbate at the altar of Baal.

Blood

I cried for pain and pain in what I got
I cried for blood and blood is what I got
I cried for pleasure and pleasure is what I got
I cried for death and death is what I got
Pain

In total anguish I raised my voice.
Let my body be an instrument of filth.
In life and hell.

Suffering, the sweet, sweet suffering.
Back to life, back to hell.
Your flesh and blood I exterminate.
Penetrate, your flesh and blood I penetrate.
Not single wound healed.
I live for blood. I live for pain.
Suffocate, in life and hell we?ll suffocate.
Step into my world and feel the rage.
Anguish.

I cried for pain and pain in what I got
I cried for blood and blood is what I got
I cried for pleasure and pleasure is what I got
I cried for death and death is what I got
Blood

In total anguish I raised my voice.
Let my body be an instrument of filth.
In life and hell.

I  obtain  darkness  got  me.  I broke the rules and I got my fee. Not
longer  a  shredded corpse. Vengeance. Hunger and desire. Back in hell
is where I'll be. I'll raise pain and sodomy.

Suffering, the sweet, sweet suffering.

Penetrate, your flesh and blood I penetrate.
Not single wound healed.
I live for blood. I live for pain.
Suffocate, in life and hell we?ll suffocate.
Step into my world and feel the rage.

Suffering, the sweet, sweet suffering.
