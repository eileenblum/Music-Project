How fucked can it be - a life without breed
A sleeping mind - is all I can find
Machines made of steel - what can they feel?
My wildest fears - I burst into tears

MECHANICAL! MECHANICAL!
Built without a heart, makes us apart
MECHANICAL! MECHANICAL!
Made by fools, used as stupid tools

A seventh version from a second person
A progress it may be, but look and you will see
The profit is short - not for your sort
I love to hate you - I love to break you

MECHANICAL! MECHANICAL!
Built without a heart, makes us apart
MECHANICAL! MECHANICAL!
Made by fools, used as stupid tools

MECHANICAL! MECHANICAL!
Built without a heart, makes us apart
MECHANICAL! MECHANICAL!
Made by fools, used as stupid tools
