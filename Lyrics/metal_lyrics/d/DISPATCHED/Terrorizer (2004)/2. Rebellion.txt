I have passed the stop sign years ago...
And there's no retreat!
I've fought my way, all to the top...
But there's no one left to defeat!
In stormy clouds and heavy winds, that's the weather I'll be in!
Take your chance, fight my sin, maybe you're lucky, but I always win!

REBELLION! Attacking the force, striking the cause
REBELLION! Attacking the force, striking the cause

Hail the seasons, turning into dusk...
The renewal tide is here!
Nothing scares me, nothing will...
There's no one left to fear!

REBELLION! Attacking the force, striking the cause
REBELLION! No remorse, beating the source
REBELLION! Attacking the force, striking the cause
REBELLION! The time is here...

I passed your border, I crossed your lines
I trashed your regulations from time to time
I got no respect, not of any kind
I walk my path, following my mind
REBEL!
I'm the rebel who repeals your laws
REBEL!
I'm the rebel who defeats your cause

Hail the seasons, turning into dusk...
The renewal tide is here!
Nothing scares me, nothing will...
There's no one left to fear!

I have passed the stop sign years ago...
And there's no retreat!
I've fought my way, all to the top...
But there's no one left to defeat!
I am the greatest, I am the tall, I am the rock who never falls!
I am the strongest of them ALL!
I'LL SHOW YOU THE HEART OF MY OPEN SOUL!

REBELLION! Attacking the force, striking the cause
REBELLION! Attacking the force, striking the cause

I passed your border, I crossed your lines
I trashed your regulations from time to time
I got no respect, not of any kind
I walk my path, following my mind
REBEL!
I'm the rebel who repeals your laws
REBEL!
I'm the rebel who defeats your cause
