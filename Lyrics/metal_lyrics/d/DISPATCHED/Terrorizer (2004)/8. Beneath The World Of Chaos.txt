The smallest ripple is making a storm
Breaking the silence, making a roar
Raising rage, collecting hate
The world is on fire, in flames into smoke

Cities into ashes, towns burnt to the ground
Forests into deserts, the sea can't be found
The people into deserts, mankind at war
Advanced hi-tech can't save us any more

BENEATH THE WORLD OF CHAOS!
You will find me there, see if I care...
BENEATH THE WORLD OF CHAOS!
Make it to my kingdom, praise my hate!

[Solo - Lundberg]

BENEATH THE WORLD OF CHAOS!
Feel my breath destroying your world
BENEATH THE WORLD OF CHAOS!
TECHNOLOGY IS MY NAME!!!

The smallest ripple is making a storm
Breaking the silence, making a roar
Raising rage, collecting hate
The world is on fire, in flames into smoke

[Solo - Lundberg]

Cities into ashes, towns burnt to the ground
Forests into deserts, the sea can't be found
The people into deserts, mankind at war
Advanced hi-tech can't save us any more
