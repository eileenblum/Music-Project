[Solo - Karlsson]

I'm in the inner circle
Within my inner self
Left out very lonely
From the public domain
But there are more than pictures
More than any friends
I go by myself
Into hyper space

The world is black 'n white
Written in codes
But you will see me fighting
Breaking the laws
I get my head together
I look at my goal
I'll find my way to touch it
To feel the cyber space

I go...
...with the force
Touching the haze...
TOUCHING THE HAZE

I'm the ruler
I am the King
Of cyber space...
THE CYBER SPACE

I go...
...with the force
Touching the haze...
TOUCHING THE HAZE

I'm the ruler
I am the King
Of cyber space...
THE CYBER SPACE

I bear within me
A heedful soul
My eyes are always open
You will never make me fall
Upon the cradle of life
Into eons of death
You will find me immortal
In my hyper space

I burst your frames
I will stretch your words
I feed you with lies
As ever before
I am immoral
But I am the man,
the saver, the god
of cyber space

I go...
...with the force
Touching the haze...
TOUCHING THE HAZE

I'm the ruler
I am the King
Of cyber space...
THE CYBER SPACE

I go...
...with the force
Touching the haze...
TOUCHING THE HAZE

I'm the ruler
I am the King
Of cyber space...
THE CYBER SPACE

I go...
...with the force
Touching the haze...
TOUCHING THE HAZE

I'm the ruler
I am the King
Of cyber space...
THE CYBER SPACE

I go...
...with the force
Touching the haze...
TOUCHING THE HAZE

I'm the ruler
I am the King
Of cyber space...
THE CYBER SPACE

[Solo - Lundberg]

I go...
...with the force
Touching the haze...
TOUCHING THE HAZE

I'm the ruler
I am the King
Of cyber space...
THE CYBER SPACE

I go...
...with the force
Touching the haze...
TOUCHING THE HAZE

I'm the ruler
I am the King
Of cyber space...
THE CYBER SPACE
