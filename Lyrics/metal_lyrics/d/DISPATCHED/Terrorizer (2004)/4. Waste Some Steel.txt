Sirens
Screaming for war
Get ready to fight
Get ready, get straight

Death squads
Of iron and blood
Running this way
Waste them I say

Hi-tech weapons
A mind of steel
Blast 'em all
Until they fall

A second round
Get ready again
Unlock your gun
This is gonna be fun

Get ready to fight (fight for your life!)
Get ready to aim (you're the same!)
Get ready to fire (kill that liar!)
Get ready to kill (waste some steel!)

A loaded gun
A sworn mind
Get out of my sight
Or fear my might

The troops of hell
Are coming this way
I blow their heads
I shoot at their legs

Made by scientists - but now out of control
They started this battle - to take what was ours
But we fight back - we give them hell
One last standing - we'll take them down

Get ready to fight (fight for your life!)
Get ready to aim (you're the same!)
Get ready to fire (kill that liar!)
Get ready to kill (waste some steel!)

Get ready to fight (fight for your life!)
Get ready to aim (you're the same!)
Get ready to fire (kill that liar!)
Get ready to kill (waste some steel!)
