I came from nowhere, far away
From a distant planet, hidden among the stars
I seek life, to bear my child
To feed my breed, that's all I need
Don't fight me lad, you're making me mad
I'm inflicted with a mind, the strongest to be found
I hate to tell you, but I tell you what is true
I will hunt you down, prepare yourself to die

I came from nowhere, concealed in the dark
I give you salvation, I give you your cause
You're soon alone, no one to phone
Give it a rest, it's all for the best
I will let you breed, planting my seed
Infiltrating your chest, building my nest
I hate to tell you, but I tell you what is true
You're the host, soon to be dead

I am the creature
I am the beast
I am the drifter
And the thief
They give me names
They give me titles
The Terrorizer
The Alien Beast
