Beneath the sun, into the ground
Born in caves, raised in the ground
Bereft to live in the kingdom of light
Bereft the chance to touch the sun
I have to wonder, I have to see
I have to feel what's really there
I begin my search, I begin to climb
Step by step, over cliffs, in clay

I started this journey many times before
But this time I will conquer the throne
A few steps away, the last of 'em all
I see a bright light shining from a door

The world is mine
I grab it with my soul
Identify
Me as your lord
The world is mine
I grab it with my soul
Realize
I am thy lord

The world is mine
I grab it with my soul
Identify
Me as your lord

Count me in, I am the king
The ruler, writing all laws
Do as I please, follow my code
Do as I wish, and get my reward
I'm filled with greed, and mighty plans
World domination and supremacy
Once born with a dark soul
Growing stronger, I'm growing fast

[Solo - Lundberg]

I had to wonder, I had to see
I had to feel what's really there
I found the life I never had
I found gold, too much to bear
Beneath the sun, into the ground
Born in caves, raised in hell
I claim my rights to be the one
The ruler, the emperor, of every man

The world is mine
I grab it with my soul
Identify
Me as your lord
The world is mine
I grab it with my soul
Realize
I...AM...THY...FUCKING...LORD!!!
