I once had a dream, I woke up in a scream
Darkness wherever I see, the terror is surrounding me
A second round, no sleep to be found
Restless time in bed, while evil ideas are made

NIGHTMARE! Unstable nights are here
NIGHTMARE! Haunted by my past
NIGHTMARE! Crawling in my sweat
NIGHTMARE! I can't find the light of dawn

I once had a dream, all turned into green
Fighting my ghost, kept inside, me as the host
Warmer nights, can't find the lights
A deadly whisper reaches my ear, I got much to fear!

NIGHTMARE! Unstable nights are here
NIGHTMARE! Haunted by my past
NIGHTMARE! Crawling in my sweat
NIGHTMARE! I can't find the light of dawn

WICKED DREAMS
WICKED DREAMS
WICKED DREAMS
WICKED DREAMS, YEAH!

I once had a dream, but I'm now out of screams
I feel like a whore, but I can resist no more
The horror turns into pain, I'm getting insane
I end up in a pile, but I went down with a smile!
