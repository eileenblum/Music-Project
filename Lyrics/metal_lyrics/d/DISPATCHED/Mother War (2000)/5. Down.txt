[Daniel Lundberg/Daniel Lundberg]

[THE DAGGER SAGA - Chapter III]

Persist my crime
No antidote, hollowed mind
Persist the time
My foundation is down, a hole in the ground

Lonely at last, feeble I stand
Can I purify my soul, to begin where I was?
No answers are given, so I reach for my dagger
Inferior as me, I go down with the truth

In the eclipse of the moon, I say goodbye
A razor sharpened dagger, fills my hand

Persist my crime
No antidote, hollowed mind
Persist the time
My foundation is down, a hole in the ground

I posses a knife, a really nice dagger
Stacked in my heart, in the shades of the moon
Leaving this world, I see a star
Is this the gate of heaven - or is it the gate of hell...
