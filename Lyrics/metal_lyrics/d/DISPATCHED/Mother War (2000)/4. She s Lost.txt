[THE DAGGER SAGA - Chapter II]

I had this special dagger, a nice piece of art
Jewels and gold, was shinning from the handle
The blade was sharpest steel, made by mighty hands
Power and magic was floating from this knife

Hell awaits my soul tonight
She's lost, she's gone, I reach for my dagger
Hell awaits my soul tonight
She's lost, she's gone, I reach for my dagger

My mind was soon infected, by this mighty force
Evil and darkness was coming from this source
I lost my faith and mind - this dagger let me knew
To kill and lie, in purpose to betray...
All this are behind me, nothing can be repaired
In rest, in silence - she left me here tonight
I have no longer a home, I have no one to trust
My queen are lost by my hand...

Hell awaits my soul tonight
She's lost, she's gone, I reach for my dagger
Hell awaits my soul tonight
She's lost, she's gone, I reach for my dagger
