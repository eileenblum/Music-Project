[Daniel Lundberg/Daniel Lundberg]

[THE DAGGER SAGA - Chapter I]

I am awaked from my past
My mind is clear, nothing can change that now...
Wounded and hurt I licked my marks
I suffer no more, beautiful night is here again...

I spread my wings to touch that flame
Flame of whispers that tells me truth
With open eyes I kiss you bye
You leave us here by my hand

A silver dagger penetrating your chest
My beloved queen, to sleep you goes
Night clouds ahead salutes your voyage
My beloved queen, to sleep you goes
