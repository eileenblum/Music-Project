[Daniel Lundberg/Daniel Lundberg]

Light cloaks, shinning steel
Heavy armour, lethal swords
Mighty spirits, greedy souls
A white horse, carrying it all

Killing in the name of the god
Burn it into ashes and dust
Steal all gold in the power of the cross
Take all land, covert all souls

They have their reason to take it all
To fatten up the holy church
They give to god - blood stained gold
Poor souls, no spirit at all
Castles and convents with mighty doors
Crimson drapes and thrones of oak
Halls of brave, glory and faith
Blessed by the god we raid again

They have their reason to take it all
To fatten up the holy church
They give to god - blood stained gold
Poor souls, no spirit at all
