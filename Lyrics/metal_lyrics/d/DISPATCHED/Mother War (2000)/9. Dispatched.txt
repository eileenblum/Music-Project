[Daniel Lundberg/Daniel Lundberg]

As years go by - and so do I
Reflection time is here right now
As I die like clouds above
Here I stand soon forgotten
DISPATCHED and gone - in mist I go
DISPATCHED and gone - into darkness I'll be
DISPATCHED and gone - at last in rest
DISPATCHED and gone - fading away

A last tear, running down my cheek
The last embracement of an extinction heart
A last hail to earlier days
Remember yesterday, bring glory to the past
Reform the lines, use your spades
Run your race, to earn my throne
Towards the days, seek my grave
You will find me there, enliven your quest

As years go by - and so do I
Reflection time is here right now
As I die like clouds above
Here I stand soon forgotten
DISPATCHED and gone - in mist I go
DISPATCHED and gone - into darkness I'll be
DISPATCHED and gone - at last in rest
DISPATCHED and gone - fading away
