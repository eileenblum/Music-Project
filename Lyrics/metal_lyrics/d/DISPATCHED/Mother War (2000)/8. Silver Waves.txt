[Daniel Lundberg/Daniel Lundberg]

Standing in the moonshine, looking at the waves
It looks like silver, the treasure of the night
The horizons are endless, flotsam floats around

Open waters, only the moon is awake
In the dark sky - silver waves...
Open waters, only the moon is awake
In the dark sky - silver waves...

Silence where I stand
Only sounds of water, can be heard when it hits the shore
A tear coming from my eye, when the moon is fading away
I can see the sunshine coming upon the open sea 

Open waters, only the moon is awake
In the dark sky - silver waves...
Open waters, only the moon is awake
In the dark sky - silver waves...

Silver waves...

Silver waves...

Walking my way
To the sea, to hear - to feel
