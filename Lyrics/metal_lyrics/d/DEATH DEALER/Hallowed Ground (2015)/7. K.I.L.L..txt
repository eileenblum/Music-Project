Defeat them
We're under the gun
Embrace the pain and fight until the day is won
Believe in power of the will
Take heed in the thrill of going for the kill

K.I.L.L. - K is for killing
K.I.L.L. - Eye for an eye
K.I.L.L. - Death for the willing
K.I.L.L.

K is for killing
Eye for an eye
Two l's in hell
Where I'll send you tonight

A soldier in the legion of the damned
Follow me into the forgotten lands
A nightmare breaking out of hell
We wield the light our enemies won't live to tell

K is for killing
Eye for an eye
Two l's in hell
Where I'll send you tonight

K.I.L.L. - It makes me want to scream
K.I.L.L. - Beneath the pale moonlight
K.I.L.L. - Together we'll set things right
K.I.L.L. - I'll send you to hell tonight!
