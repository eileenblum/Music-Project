Nothing fulfils me
Like the surge of the sea
Rising and falling
This is the life meant for me
Waves come a crashin' into the hull
My hair in the wind
We're flying the flag of the skull

For gold and for glory
We rape and pillage and fight
Our songs tell our story
We're guided by stars in the night

We're the skull and crossbones
We're the scourge of the sea
Set course for the plunder
Where there's nowhere to flee
Make for open waters
Sails are full as we fly
We're loyal to no man
With a patch on my eye
I'll take what is mine
Savagely storming the seas

We lived by the sword
And we learned to believe
That there is no honor
Amongst all of us thieves
Loaded on bottles of rum
We searched through the sands
Risking our lives for treasure 
And gold in our hands

Stealing and whoring
Ravaging wenches and wine
Alive and we're free
Across seven seas
The ocean's our kingdom of crime

We're the skull and crossbones
We're the scourge of the sea
Set course for the plunder
Where there's nowhere to flee
Make for open waters
Sails are full as we fly
We're loyal to no man
With a patch on my eye
I'll take what is mine
Savagely storming the seas

Life on the sea wind it the sails treasure
In the hold we live just for glory and gold
Life of a pirate you'll never die old
The Kraken will feast on your bones
