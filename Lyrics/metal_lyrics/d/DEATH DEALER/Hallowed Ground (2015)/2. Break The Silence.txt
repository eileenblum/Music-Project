There's something happening not right
They want to shut our mouths sealed tight
We're gonna take back what they stole
It's freaking madness
Out of control
We'll fight before we lose control
For once in your life
I want you to open the door

Then we break the silence
We are revealed
We live for violence
We'll break this with steel

Your voice will pin you with a crime
Do what they say and get in line
Be brave there is courage to be found
It's not too late to turn it around
They'll try to take you
It's time to turn it back around
The right to your mind
Is what this is all for
