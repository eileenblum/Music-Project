They tried to stop me
Get a job and quit your dreaming
They tried to mock me
Shut your mouth and stop your screaming
But we kept rocking
And here we are tonight together
Our metal's talking
Let's make this moment last forever

We're never slowing down
Until they put us in the ground

Heavy Metal one for all
Heavy Metal we heed the call
Heavy Metal til we die
Heavy Metal for you and I

We are creating a legacy of wrath and raging
Lacerating, a brutal beast of Metal's making
We strike like lightning
When we arrive they'll hear our thunder
Don't need inviting
We'll rock until we're six feet under

We're tearing down the walls
Because we've got the balls

Bear witness before the Gods of Steel
And swear a blood oath
To defend ad that is true
And live only for
Truth, power and glory!
