All the evil that spreads like a plague on this world
Know that we will avenge all the blood
That's been spilled
Follow me stay on course
We're unclouded by remorse
Conscience clear by the fact
Your assault is about to get smacked

Watch your six I'm on your back
There'll be no time to react
With a red iron glove I bring death from above
Follow my plan of attack, plan of attack
That's why my plan is to attack

Now my armor is set to attack and destroy
Makes no matter they'll scatter when I am deployed
I'm a weapon, a ruthless revenger
Also known as the golden Avenger
Cold and uncaring as I calculate
How you and your kind will meet a cruel fate

I bring brute force in the blink of an eye
A violent reaction to action that's who am I
Do you know who I am
I'm on a mission, a mission to kill
A human missile, I live for this thrill
Valor and honor, for these things I stand
I'm the protector, I am iron Man!
