When I was a young boy
My father told me
The tale of a twisted machine
Christened with blood by the black sun
Was the pride of the mad Fuhrer's fleet
The water turned red in the North Atlantic
Cause it hunts like a wolf in the sea
Satanically silent demonically deep
Its victims have no chance to flee

I remember it like it was yesterday
Something told me climb aboard
U-666 - Set sail for hell
U-666 - Fuelled by the night
U-666 - Ring the demon bell
U-666!

For thirty-nine months
And twenty-nine days
Its torpedoes kept firing away
It went unopposed as its infamy rose
Sending men to their watery graves
The U.S.S. Eldridge was blessed by a priest
And shrouded by magnetic waves
They battled each other
For twenty-four hours
So the free world of men could be saved

It sank like lead
No more blood would be shed
As it plunged to the bottom of the icy sea
But the devil was near
Then the devil was here
He would breathe into her new life
Life that brought fear
A fear that will never die

It sank like a stone and couldn't be found
Never again to be seen
But stories are told from all around
That the U-boat still hungers and feeds
Some of the survivors
That clung their lifeboats
Stare blankly in disbelief
As U-666 rises with deadly surprises
In the name of the Reich's legacy

I remember it like it was yesterday
Something told me climb aboard
U-666 - Set sail for hell
U-666 - Fuelled by the night
U-666 - Ring the demon bell
U-666!
