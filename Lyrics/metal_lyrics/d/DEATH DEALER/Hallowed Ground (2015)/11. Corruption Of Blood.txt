Heads of the kings continue to roll
Pleas of the peasants scream for control
Lies of the past buried and gone
Taken to task the legend lives on

I fear no man - reclaim our land
It's always dark before the dawn

Fulfil your destiny - corruption of blood
You'll right the things that they've done wrong
Forgotten legacy - corruption of blood

You're the black sheep you poisoned the line
Cruel twist of fate now it's your time
Assassins will come just let them try
Just like the rest they'll crumble and die

You can call this place home if you're standing alone
For as long as I'm king and I sit on this throne
All take a knee and swear to be free from your cages
It's how glory is made and displayed on history's pages
