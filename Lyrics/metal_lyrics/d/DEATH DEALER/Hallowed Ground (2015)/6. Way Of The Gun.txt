In life a man has to find his own way
One thing has kept me from an early grave
I keep moving ahead and pounding
And pounding and pounding the night
If you don't feel alive, then you are a slave

This town is mine to defend
I'll try to survive see it through to the end
We're surrounded by men
With contempt for the law
So I call

The way of the gun
It's not just how the west was won
But for me it's a way of life
The way of the gun
The way of the gun
I'm always out on the run
I'll live free or die, the way of the gun

I'll bury your lies along with the dead
A new sheriff's in town
There's a price on your head
You're a wretch and a leech
Who is wasted and empty
With nothing to give
I've decided I won't let you live

I protect who we are
With gunpowder and lead
And this silver star
Outlaws and redskins curse these very lands
So I'll use these deadly hands
