I am a bastard son I drift from town to town
I live for raising hell when the sun goes down
Some call me outlaw
But I'm known by many names
A dark desperado purveyor of pain

Don't cross my path or face my wrath
Leave me alone
Wenches and whiskey all I need
To make my home
Death seems to follow me
No matter where I ride
My horse and my hat and my colt by my side

I'm the one with an ace up my sleeve
Don't challenge me
You're the one I will gun down in the street
That's why they call me
Gunslinger...Soul Stealer...Death Dealer
Reach for the sky and die
Gunslinger...Grim Reaper...Oath Keeper
Hang 'em high Gunslinger

You've seen a drawing of my face
Hung on a wall, I'm the most wanted man
The worst you ever saw
For years they've tried
To put a noose around my neck
This here reward
Don't you try to collect

Come meet your maker
I will put you in a box
I live amongst the dead
The tumbleweeds and rocks
I'll always face you
Never shoot you in the back
Dressed in my brown duster
The bad guys wear black

Coins in the eyes of my dead
They'll tell no tales
Holes from my bullets in their heads
Laid to rest by the Gunslinger

Wanted dead or alive
The lawman arrived
He called me out the saloon
The town gathered round
As the church bell chimed
He faced me right at high noon
He claimed he's the best the law in the west
Come quiet and surrender he said
Before he could draw so quick no one saw
I fired and filled him with lead

Hang 'em high - way up high!
