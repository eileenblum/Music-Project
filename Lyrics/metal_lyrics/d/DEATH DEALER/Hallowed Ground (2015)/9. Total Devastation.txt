In the 6th century BC, the Mayan
Civilization predicted the end of the world
That day has finally come

The fate of the world's on the brink
The sky fun of clouds turning black
Lightning and rain
The seas and the oceans
Are beginning to rage
The streets and the faultiness
Are starting to crack
Breaking the ground
Shaking the earth
Dear God don't abandon us now

Ripping and fearing
Our way to the gate
The chosen are closing us out
Slashing and blasting
There is no time to waste
To sinners we righteously shout
Repent!

Total devastation
Sealing your fate
No hope for salvation
It's finally too late

The moon in the sky
Is crumbling and smashed
Hit by the rock splitting apart
The shockwaves are seismically
Slaughtering down

Fighting the frenzy
To find a safe place
Only one haven exists
Braving such perils
While making great haste
To find your name is not on the list

A solar flare a polar shift
A celestial body creating a rift
Dark demolition from the divine
To all of its children
That it had given birth
All would be swallowed
Swallowed by the earth

Repent - For the end of the world
Repent - For the last days of your life
Repent - Before it's too late
Repent!
