Welcome to the table
Suspend disbelief
Join hands in the circle
Sit down in your seat
We've come here tonight
To open your mind
To open your eyes
And soon you'll be no longer blind
I sense a presence here

SÃ©ance - We talk with the dead
SÃ©ance - Take heed what the spirits have said
SÃ©ance - From the other side
SÃ©ance - Revealing the secrets you hide

An invitation
Come and dance with the unknown
How could I refuse
They said to come alone
I was so skeptical, I need to see some facts
There's something in the air
There's no way to relax

SÃ©ance - We talk with the dead
SÃ©ance - Take heed what the spirits have said
SÃ©ance - From the other side
SÃ©ance - Revealing the secrets you hide

Come with me into the afterlife
Destiny is forever
Follow me into the afterlife
Follow me forever

I cannot tell you what
The things I saw and heard
You would not believe me
You would not believe a word

I was once like you
But now I know it's all so real
Come down to the sÃ©ance
And the truth will be revealed

SÃ©ance - We talk with the dead
SÃ©ance - Take heed what the spirits have said
SÃ©ance - From the other side
SÃ©ance - Revealing the secrets you hide

Come with me into the afterlife
Destiny is forever
Follow me into the afterlife
Follow me forever

I heard them call my name
They're coming back again!
