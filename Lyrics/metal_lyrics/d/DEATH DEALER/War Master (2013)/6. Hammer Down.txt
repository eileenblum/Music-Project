Defending, honour and pride
Pretending, there's nowhere to hide
Alone, will face my destiny
Forever, my spirit will burn
Never, will I turn
My back on blood
My senseless victims feel the fire
I am now reborn in vengeance

Bring the hammer down - bring the hammer down
Hammer down - bring the hammer down
Down - bring the hammer down
Hammer down - bring the hammer down

See the blood, the day has come your life is over
I dominate , crush your spirit walk through fire

This is my decree to stand and face the enemy
Locked in blood, toe to toe
Our battle rages
The power flows through me
They will feel the steel

Bring the hammer down - bring the hammer down
Hammer down - bring the hammer down
Down - bring the hammer down
Hammer down - bring the hammer down

Feel the steel all guns loaded
Vengeance mine your life has ended
Pull the trigger brain exploding
Born of blood my blade of vengeance

Bring the hammer down - bring the hammer down
Hammer down - bring the hammer down
Down - bring the hammer down
Hammer down - bring the hammer down
