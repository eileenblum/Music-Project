Victory is gone and forsaken
There's no hope you're sadly mistaken
Battle plans a total disaster
You won't ever defeat the warmaster

Full retreat you're battered and beaten
Piece of meat your army is bleeding
One by one your forces die faster
None dare oppose the warmaster

I'm making my peace with what's real in this world
I'm ready to die for a reason
It's violence not silence that ever is heard
It's the only solution so lead us to war

Lead us to war - warmaster 
We're dying for more - warmaster
We've seen this before - warmaster
Lead us to war - warmaster

Through the land we're dying for freedom
Gun in hand the charge we are leading
In this darkness we are the light
We are only beginning to fight
Pull the trigger firing at will
Take no prisoners shooting to kill
Push the button it's them or us
In our guns and our god we will trust

These graveyards are filling again and again
The bodies go higher and higher
The first ones are the indispensible men
We pour them in ditches so lead us to war

Lead us to war - warmaster 
We're dying for more - warmaster
We've seen this before - warmaster
Lead us to war - warmaster

Dreams of tyrants devils delights
Ethnic cleansing change overnight
Insurrection freedom restored
They all lead us to war
Assassination treaties upheld
Fill the void as a dictator fell
Occupation must be repelled
They all lead us to war

As we emerge from the black fog of war
Clear our minds of the carnage and gore
Wash our hands of our crimes and the blood
We've protected the ones that we love

They'll ask us just how can we live with ourselves
There's always a justification
We're sleeping quite soundly you're going to hell
We fight for the righteous so lead us to war

Lead us to war - warmaster 
We're dying for more - warmaster
We've seen this before - warmaster
Lead us to war - warmaster
Lead us to war
