Staring out the window
Is it the tears or the rain
Dancing shadows
Are the children of flames
Of flames
They are the children of flames

Why do they come from beyond
Cause they are not really gone
How do they know
We're lost without them

They can see us in the dark
They know just who we are
They haven't gone too far
To find their way back home

Feeling cold and alone
We look for a sign or a trace
Lives so hollow
In everything I see your face
Your face
In everything I see your face
I just can't seem to escape

I was not prepared for that day
There were things that I wanted to say
I know you can hear
Me whisper out your name

They can see us in the dark
They know just who we are
They haven't gone too far
To find their way back home
Almost every night we cry
We cannot say goodbye
Dream of better times
Can't seem to let go

Why do they come from beyond
Cause they are not really gone
How do they know
We're lost without them
