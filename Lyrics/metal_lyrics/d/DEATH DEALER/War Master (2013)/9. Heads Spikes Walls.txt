On we ride bring the savage blade
We strike tonight win the day
There's a reckoning on the way

At the dawn of the battle
We've prepared to die
All the words that lead to this day
All are poison lies

Bring me their heads I command you
Put them on spikes raise them high
Bring down the walls all around them
As their sanctuary dies
Knights born for battle, kings born to fall

Seize the throne
By blood I make the claim
It's mine alone
Break their lines
Our legions lashing through
While banners fly

Charging into the melee
Axes swords and pikes
Cracking armor and shields giving way
As the blow of the morning star strikes

Bring me their heads I command you
Put them on spikes raise them high
Bring down the walls all around them
As their sanctuary dies
Knights born for battle, kings born to fall

On the fields of the fallen
Thousands sacrificed
I shall rule as a kind hearted king
But all shall fear my might

So off with their heads
Heads spikes walls
