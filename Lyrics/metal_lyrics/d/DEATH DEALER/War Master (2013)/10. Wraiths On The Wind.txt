We are wraiths on the wind
We are wraiths on the wind

We're the ones that you feel when you're out at night
We're the ones that you see turning off the lights
We're not bound to the ground like your frail mortal coil

We are real we are real we are here not a trick of mind
We're not a figment or a fake imaginary kind
We control and patrol those who trespass this soil

All of your life you thought it was fantasy
You've opened your mind the truth was concealed
We've come to take you prisoner

We are wraiths on the wind
We are wraiths on the wind

Hear a voice in the dark when it's cold outside
See your breath shrouding death we're the afterlife
Spirits hiding and grinding the life from your bones

All of this time you wondered what does it mean
You've opened your eyes finally you see
We're the savage saviours

We are wraiths on the wind
We are wraiths on the wind

Don't deny it's a lie that we're not around
You're calling out but when you shout there is not a sound
By revealing ourselves you are forced to believe

All of your life you thought it was fantasy
You've opened your mind the truth was concealed
We've come to take you prisoner

We are wraiths on the wind
We are wraiths on the wind

One day you'll be one of us
A wraith on the wind
So come on come be a part of us
A wraith on the wind
