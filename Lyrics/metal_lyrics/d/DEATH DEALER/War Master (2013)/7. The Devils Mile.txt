I was alone on the crossroads
Reved up and ready to roll
Out in the distance he slowly approached
A trail of sulfer and smoke
He had been watching me for a while
I challenged him to a drive
He answered me with a smile
Then we raced the devil's mile

I pushed the pedal to the metal
It almost went right through the floor
I saw him in my rear view window
I knew she couldn't take much more

He drives a demon machine
Hellfire sorcery and steam
His challenges are never fair
But I drive like I just don't care

The devil's mile
I probably won't see 25
So I get in my car and I drive
I am seizing this throne
I'll go it alone riding high
I feel the adrenaline race
Each day I stare death in the face
Well it might be my last
So I'm kicking his ass every time

Like a rocket he blew by me
I quickly had to swerve
But I own this stretch of highway
I am the king of dead man's curve

The devil's demons built a fast car
It's the supremacy of speed
But this one mile it isn't that far
And I've got just what I need

I caught up and looked right over
He looked back looking mean
Then he bumped me to the shoulder
 I'm looking low on gasoline

The devil's mile
I probably won't see 25
So I get in my car and I drive
I am seizing this throne
I'll go it alone riding high
I feel the adrenaline race
Each day I stare death in the face
Well it might be my last
So I'm kicking his ass every time

I rule the roads just like I rule in hell
All who have raced me have not lived to tell
When you lose you know where you're going to
Now let me show you the things I can do

I called upon you I asked for this test
You may be the devil but I am the best
I know the deal so I wagered my soul
But when you lose I get a car made of gold

He knew he couldn't shake me
I had to make my move
We hit the corner going full speed 
Racing neck and neck
I took the inside and took the lead
He flew off in a flaming wreck

The devil's mile
I probably won't see 25
So I get in my car and I drive
I am seizing this throne
I'll go it alone riding high
I feel the adrenaline race
Each day I stare death in the face
Well it might be my last
So I'm kicking his ass every time

The sun was setting in the sky
As I looked down into the flames
The smoke was black as it rised
From the devil's machine
How did I ever survive
I'll be wondering for a while
Now you know what it's like
To race the devil's mile
