[Bonus Track]They came from below
Just how we don't know
What these monsters are remains a mystery
Mankind tried to fight
But try as we might
The human race was ancient history

We won't lay down we won't cower in fear
A voice of surrender you'll never hear
Our backs to the wall but salvation's near

Raise your fist and bring it down
All the world will hear the sound
Of triumph and victory
Men in machines will beat the beasts
We've drawn the lines defend the east
With cybernetic synergy

When they made landfall
One thousand feet tall
Our cities were crushed by these monstrosities
The weapons we had
Only made them mad
Our only chance was new technology

Our best and our brightest made titans of steel
Fueled by the atom but powered by will
Now it's time to face the enemy

Raise your fist and bring it down
All the world will hear the sound
Of triumph and victory
Men in machines will beat the beasts
We've drawn the lines defend the east
With cybernetic synergy

The link is complete
Weapons armed
Engage

All of the crashed
The landscape was thrashed
Both sides suffered great fatalities
In a volcanic place
They came face to face
A kataklysmic calamity

There was one titan left yet two beasts remained
But the human spirit will never be chained
When it was over the creatures lie slain

Raise your fist and bring it down
All the world will hear the sound
Of triumph and victory
Men in machines will beat the beasts
We've drawn the lines defend the east
With cybernetic synergy

Now across the stars
They'll know who we are
They'll never challenge us for eternity
We'll dominate
And then re-create
A better world it is our destiny
