Denied our rights we want a new beginning
Stand tall unite this movement's alive
A lethal injection prescribing today
Revolt and rejecting the rules that you've made
Your reasoning doesn't apply anyway
We're trying a new way of life

My kingdom come
And we'll make thy will be done

Deep inside the thunder we feel
Stronger than stone never to kneel
Sworn to defend and never forsake
We stand in union we will not break

We will not break!

Unchained on fire this rising rage rebellion
We'll march all night they must recognize
We're not obeying the words that you say
Move the hell over get out of our way
We won't roll over for more of the same
You tried and you failed at the game

Born to be free
So we'll crush their tyranny

Deep inside the thunder we feel
Stronger than stone never to kneel
Sworn to defend and never forsake
We stand in union we will not break

My kingdom come
and we'll make thy will be done
Your ties that bind
Will not chain our sovereign minds

Deep inside the thunder we feel
Stronger than stone never to kneel
Sworn to defend and never forsake
We stand in union we will not break
