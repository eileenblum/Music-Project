Blasphemous witch
Drown the heathen burn her body
Over the bridge
Hang her til there is no life left in there
May god have mercy on your soul
No mercy here
We'll take no chances kill their coven

Can you hear their mystic devil's calling
Fight the fear or it will take you away

Curse of the heretic
Satan's revenge
Forever born a witch
It never ends
Curse of the heretic

Is this a trick
Her wretched body has come to life again
Blood running thick
The bitch escaped and slaughtered half our men
To hell's hollow she did retreat
Back on your feet 
Gather the men we leave at nightfall

Can you hear their mystic devil's calling
Fight the fear or it will take you away

Curse of the heretic
Satan's revenge
Forever born a witch
It never ends
Curse of the heretic

She's the heretic she came back
She is his chosen one she cursed them all

Join us my child
We will protect you
I am the father
You are all my daughters
In this hall none dare threaten you
Come join the circle and complete the ritual
The men rushed in
With their swords and their gods
And the last thing they saw
Was unspeakable
A wall of fire engulfed the men in flames
You've seen the power that I gave to thee

Curse of the heretic
Satan's revenge
Forever born a witch
It never ends
Curse of the heretic

My lord! What is it?
The men, they're all dead
Damn you bring me the witches head
Curse of the heretic
