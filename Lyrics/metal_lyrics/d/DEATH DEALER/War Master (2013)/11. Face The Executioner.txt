[Bonus Track]You will be judged
Stand before the jury
And face the executioner

He's waiting for you to appear
Your innocence is nowhere near
You stand accused of sin
So bring the hangman in
You're convicted when accused

The scales are held by lady justice
She wields a sword that set to strike

[Chorus:]
You will be judged
Stand before the jury
And face the executioner

Judge the gavel is thundering down
Jury believing lies
The weight of the world crashing down
You're the victim of lies

Now face the executioner

Your crime that they create
A tormented twist of fate
Don't think you have a chance
A victim of your circumstance
Run before they close the gates

The power of the prosecution
The court's conviction crucifies

[Chorus]

Judge the gavel is thundering down
Jury believing lies
Executioner

The scales are held by lady justice
She wields a sword that set to strike

[Chorus]

Judge the gavel is thundering down
Jury believing lies
The weight of the world crashing down
You're the victim of lies

Judge the gavel is thundering down
Jury believing lies
Executioner
