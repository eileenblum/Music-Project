Give me your trust I won't betray you
Lend me your life, I will not slay you
Believe what I say I will not tell a lie

There comes a time when a people will join up and rise
Like a tide against those who would hold us
And break the confines of oppression and show us
The way for us all to be free

Give me liberty or give me death
You won't take us alive
Freedom fighting until my final breath
But I will survive

Taxed til your dead I will not pay you
We won't waste a cent
I won't obey you
We just need some more
You will not get a dime

We cry for a change for a peaceful solution
But they're so deranged with their power pollution
As we all feel the change while a new revolution
Begins to take to the streets

Give me liberty or give me death
You won't take us alive
Freedom fighting until my final breath
But I will survive
