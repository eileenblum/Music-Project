[music &amp; lyrics: Rene]

Damned for thousand years 
Now they have the power 
Make their wars 
Full of human's blood 
They only want the redemption 
Of the belief in Jesus Christ 

Damned faith 
In Jesus Christ 
Made of blood 
And human flesh 

I'm rising from the ashes 
My wings are made of flames 
Led to the fight 
With the freedom of demons 
There are still more of 'em 
Who want to destroy  the church 
To torture the priest 
To burn his temple 

Damned faith 
In his world of beauty 
Is fading forever 
Bible is covered in dust 

Damned for thousand years 
The false faith 
Will loose all its rights 
When it's king is dead 
We'll dishonour their symbol 
The CORPSE AND The CROSS
