[Music &amp; Lyrics : Rene]

Crowd of weeping people 
Your life's gone 
Your last journey 
Ends in kingdom of death 

You hear the cries and perceive a prayer 
Crucifix in your hands gives you the hope 
To redeem yourself from the world of sins 
To eternal journey to your god 

You open the gate of eternity 
Your body putrifies in depths 
You open the gate of eternity 
Prepared to devote your fate to god forever 

You see him lying under the rotten cross 
Jesus is god and god is dust 
Things they taught you and the things you liked 
Were always cold, spreading fear 

You suffer without him being near 
You are dying without him saying something 
Your soul is perished 
It's never been alive
