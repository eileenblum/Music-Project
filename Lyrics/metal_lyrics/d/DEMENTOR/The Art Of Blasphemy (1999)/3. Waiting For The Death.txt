[Music: Rene, Lyrics: Immortal]

I feel strange little space 
Gloomy darkness, chill and dump 
My body makes no move 
The preception's getting weak 
The feelings are getting paralysed 
The blood is getting curdled 

I'm dying 
These are the last minutes 
Of my living 

Absolute silence 
Absolute darkness 
I'm dying here for 666 day 
Rotten wooden pieces 
Are falling down 
To my dead body 

Worms are devouring my past 
And my soul's waiting 
For roots of the flowers 
Which could satisfy my sleep 
And which could destroy nasty 
Wooden box 
To which I've been thrown off 

I see the tomb with my name 
I don't have any fleshy clothes 
I know my soul 
Lives in another dimension 
I watch the happenings on a terrible cemetery 
On this enclosed piece of ground 
I see the occasional groups 
Of living mourning people 

It's a sign of eternal oblivion 
My soul has no place in people's hearts 
I do not see anyone standing at my memorial 
There are no traces left after the tears and sorrow 
I'm here alone 
My soul still exists 

I'll be waiting for the time 
When someone's heart 
Will suffer for the pain 
The memories will get back 

Then, at the rain 
Under the gloomy sky 
I will contently end up 
My being........
