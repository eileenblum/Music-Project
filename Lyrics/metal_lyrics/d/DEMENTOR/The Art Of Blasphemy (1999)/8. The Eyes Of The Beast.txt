[Music &amp; Lyrics: Rene]

You imagine what can happen 
What can shorten your life in a second 
Hand, knife, rope of a madman 
Can lie low on every piece 
Of the journey through darkness 

Can you imagine pain and suffering?
Stab of a knife in the living body 
Death is just a part of our lives 
But you are afraid to see its temple 

In depth of night you feel the look of mad eyes 
Steps and looks of furious beast 
You force yourself to forget the thought 
Of wandering the world of shadows 

That look belongs to you and to your body 
Your sacrifice will be as big as your pain 
Caused by the edge of steel 
You'll experience if reality really equals imagination 

The eyes of the beast watch your suffering 
Hands of a madmen destroys what still breathes 
The eye of the beast dark and cold 
Search for another innocent victim 

It's chosen the right to control human life 
It took more than it ever gave 
It's time to give it what it deserves 
It has only hope, quick death
