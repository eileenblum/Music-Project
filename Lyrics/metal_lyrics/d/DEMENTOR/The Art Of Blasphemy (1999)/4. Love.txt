[music: Rene, Lyrics: Immortal]

When you sit on an old wooden bench 
Devoured by vermin in a moldy temple 
Home of Jesus, listening to his words 
And giving him your love till the end 
Of your life 

You'll sell out everything 
To a cruel parasite- he's your love 
He's stollen everything, your life, your money 
and your common sense- it's his love 

Take a stake, pierce his heart 
Nail him to the floor of his temple 
Stand above him, baptise him with the liquid 
From your bladder 
And show him what the real love is 

Love is blood 
It's the decay 
Mold of thoughts 
False words 
Love is murder 
Redemption from sin 
The attack against Christian evil 

Tell yourself: enough ! 
Stop kneeling down 
Take a stake, pierce his heart 
And show him what the real love is 

He deserves it !
