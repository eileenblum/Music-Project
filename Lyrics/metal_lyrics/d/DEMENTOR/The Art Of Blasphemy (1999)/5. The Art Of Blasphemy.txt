[Music: Roman, Lyrics: Rene]

He sells his own lies 
He rose from death of his master 
He makes us live the way 
He wants us to live 
The art of blasphemy 
Natural way of my life 

The art of blasphemy 
Born in my mind 
The art of blasphemy 
Is the expression for my own ego 

He does not have the right 
To lead my life 
Under the mask of Christ 
To abuse the truth 

He opens the door of his temple 
Suffering in disguise of good 
Bow down before his holiness 
And you will forever loose your pride 

The art of blasphemy 
Celebration of freedom and human rights 
The art of blasphemy 
The crucified gets the last blow
