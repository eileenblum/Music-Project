[Music: Rene, Lyrics: Immortal]

I've become a victim of the night 
And walk in the emptiness 
Suddenly I smell corpselike odour 
My body gets the command to go 

Odour's getting stronger 
I'm approaching an unknown victim 
I see dead piece of meat, soulless and motionless 
I feel warm saliva flowing from my mouth 

I am opening unknown body shell 
Beautiful scent of blood and meat surround me 
I am pulling out the content of the body 
And pushing it down my throat 
Though I'm throwing up at the same time 
I keep pulling out and devouring 

I love the taste of the dead meat 
Blood clots are passing down my throat 
Everything around is red 
I notice the clothes of the corpse 

It's long black gown I'm a cannibal 
My face reveals gentle smile 
Now I've discovered the taste 
Of the best dead meat
