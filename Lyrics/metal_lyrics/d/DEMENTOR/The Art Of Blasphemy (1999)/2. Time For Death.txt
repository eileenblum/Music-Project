[Music: Rene, Lyrics: Immortal]

In a desperate dismay 
I give away the pain 
To fanatic bastards 
Destroying defenceless 
I give away bloody deadly punches 
I break the psyche 
I put out wicked soul 

Revenge begins 
Burning in my chest 
It's time for death 
End of church 

Strong pressure controls my mind 
My blood is boiling 
I start to butcher that swine with dismay 
Cold edge penetrates his ribs 
Temperature's still falling down 

Life of a priest puts out 
Light of freedom clears 
The rats devour the body 
Odour shrilly stinks 

This is the redemption 
Of a treacherous thief 
Of souls of human wrecks 
End of inquisition
