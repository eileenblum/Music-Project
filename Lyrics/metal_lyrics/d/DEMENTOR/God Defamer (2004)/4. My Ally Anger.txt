All the hate I feel 
All the anger filling me from within 
Makes my thoughts weak and slack 
And weakness always tends to hurt 

Anger accompanies me 
And I feel its presence 
I hate my ally anger 
But I can not find defence 

Christian is not worthy of being my enemy 
He is less than the stone I trample on 
I still can not find the point 
Why I waste so much time on hating you 

Their belief leads them down 
I do not need to help them to die 
Their extinction is about to come 
All their lies are fading down forever 

[Chorus:]
Now I am summoning the darkness 
And send my ally to lead you down   
No more mercy in my heart 
No more anger in my eyes
