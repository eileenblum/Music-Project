Believers of the holy lie 
Mindless sheeps , followers 
Feel hell's wrath upon you 
Time to die!! 

Losing faith , seeing clearer 
Christ's words  you did mirror 
Now in death you realize 
The holy book is full of lies 

[Chorus:]
"said your prayers?" 
You had better start!! 
Clutch your cross as you're ripped apart 
Impaled bodies - gaping holes 
The harvest is just beginning 
- We need more Christian souls!!! 

No reply ? no surprise!! 
Art thou the god of lies?? 
Pathetic follower - yes he still may have you 
As only the strong are wanted in hell
