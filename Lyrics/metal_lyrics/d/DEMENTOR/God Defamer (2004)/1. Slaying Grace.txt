Lacerated slumbering ancients, 
Stirred from rest they clamor 
Calling forth the vehement storms 
That shall thrash the earth 

Taste the scorn of thy father's lips

Beautify through annihilation 
Quenching Parasites 
Purging waves of decay 

Verminize-insects infest 
Creation - destruction 
Beset by dens of disease 
Desecrated flesh is set to frenzy 

Swarmed by gods feeble children 
Witness the broken hands of creation 
Humanity undone 
Verification of recoiling wrath 

Behold the frailty of god's creation
