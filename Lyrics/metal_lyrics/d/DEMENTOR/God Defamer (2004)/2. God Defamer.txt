Coldness of heart, when I hear them lying 
Coldness of mind, when I see them laughing 
They know he steals the weakest souls 
They know Jesus guzzles them all 

Feed Jesus with the souls of children 
Feed the bastard with the flesh of believers 
Let him drink the blood from their veins 
Let him quench his bloodthirstiness 

[Chorus:]
God defamer - take my sacrifice 
Master of lies - create eternal ways of life 
God defamer - never mind their blood 
Author of grotesque script - kill the nasty Jesus Christ   

Their wicked words once read in the Bible 
Their wicked deeds once committed on man 
The ridiculous attempt of sacramental bastards 
Will never endanger the mighty sons of defamers 

We defame the belief in Christ 
We defame the lies spread in name of Christ 
We fight for the truth and freedom 
We celebrate the victory when Jesus lies in blood
