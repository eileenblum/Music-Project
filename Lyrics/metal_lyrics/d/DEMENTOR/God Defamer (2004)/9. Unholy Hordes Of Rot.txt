The foul stench empowers you 
as centuries of hatred wash over your soul 
What was once pure and hopeful 
has been murdered in a blinding fury 
Simple mortal you cannot 
fathom the gift that you are to receive::. 
To murder without feeling, 
to hate each abomination equally. 

The smell of burning blood engulfs your senses 
At last the weak shall be vanquished 
once and for all!!! 
To cleanse this world of all disease, 
beginning with it's cancer 
Total annihilation of earth 
and man is Belial's final answer::. 

Gouge &amp; Tear at the flesh 
that boasts of 'vanity' 
Following an ancient belief 
once known as Christianity 

[Chorus:]
Soldiers of a higher cause, 
you have been chosen by Belial 
To cleanse this foul world 
of the vermin known as man 

Destroy without prejudice 
care not the color of skin 
Damned to always repeat themselves 
condemned eternally by sin
