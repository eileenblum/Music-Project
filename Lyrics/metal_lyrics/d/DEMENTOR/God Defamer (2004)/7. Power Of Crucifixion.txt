Crucify me bastards for being strong 
Crucify me for saying my own words 
Confute me, punch over my hands 
Stand my cross beside your god 

Jesus that loves verminized killers 
God that praises for wars 
All the evil he represents 
Is embodied in each of you - christians! 

Power of crucifixion - hang up all your sins 
Power of crucifixion - hang up your conscience  

Now he silently hangs with no power inside 
Behold that helpless body 
Watch suffering the one who promised salvation 
The saviour - the master of lies 

Before I die 
Let my dreams come true 
Before I drop dead 
Let me see your god in pain 

Now I contently die 
Seeing the evil goes down with me 
All the filth of world is gonna be taken 
No reason for further lies
