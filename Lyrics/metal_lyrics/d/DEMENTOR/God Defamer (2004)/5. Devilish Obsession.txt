Do not expect lies from my mouth 
Do not wait for betray 
Your heart will not be broken again 
And my love will never fade out 

Your blood flows through my veins 
We inhale the same air into our lungs 
I hear through your ears 
Speak words through your lips 

[Chorus:]
Devilish obsession 
Fully filled with love 
Give me a permission 
To store it in my heart 

We will stay together despite evil spread by man   
We will stay together despite malevolence round about 
No wicked angels separate us through our love   
No nasty deeds make us leave it all behind   

Do not mind people screaming 
Do not mind the weak ones praying 
Our love is strengthen by freedom 
Our feelings are cleansed by devoutness 

I do not feel pain neither loneliness 
When we share the universe 
It is like devilish obsession 
That makes me beg for more and more
