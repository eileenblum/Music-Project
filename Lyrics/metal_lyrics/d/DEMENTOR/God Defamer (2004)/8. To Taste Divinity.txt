I have seen times sands bleed black 
I have tasted the bliss of a Gods failure 
I am he the father of betrayal 
I am he who would condemn Christ 

Fear - Upon their dying lips 
Scorn - Upon their withering faith 
Flames - Invade a kingdom golden 
Destruction - Feasts upon Gods deception 

[Chorus:]
Three nails shall seal you fate 
Splatter blood upon your face 
You are the sum of gods disgrace 

At sunset the sands shift 
Terror infects his heart as he hangs 
Approaching from below 
Earths rightful inhabitants arise 

They have come to taste divinity 
A sacrifice of mortal treachery 
Shimmering his blood runs thick 
And we shall feast upon this broken lamb 

Three nails and your kingdom is thine 

Explanation - This song is about Judas' betrayal of Jesus, however the twist is that he betrayed
Jesus to perform a sacrifice to the gods of darkness.
Upon arriving at the site of the crucifixion the lords of hell commence a feast
upon Christ's broken body in blatant defiance of god and Christianity.
This is intended to imply that they have destroyed god's heavenly dynasty and retaken what was rightfully theirs, earth!
