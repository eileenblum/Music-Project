I wanna be your master 
I wanna be your king 
I am coming through the fire 
With iron fist I govern 

Through the piece I strike 
Through the suffering I reign 
Once called as evil 
Once seen as devil 
Master Jesus Christ 

[Chorus:]
You can not win over me 
Your weapons are too weak 
Better believe in me 
Before the fire burns your souls 

I praise your blindness 
That makes me supreme 
I praise you for being naÃ¯ve 
Bow down, worship me and bless me! 

I am the son of god 
I am Jesus Christ 
I am the mighty evil 
Worship me or die!
