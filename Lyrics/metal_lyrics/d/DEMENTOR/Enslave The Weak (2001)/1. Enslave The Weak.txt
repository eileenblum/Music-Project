Come to my embrace
son of the death.
You will get a gift
to speed up their decline.

How can you see ?
Blinded by your faith
How can you think ?
Depraved of your mind.

Feel the power entering your body.
Destroy the bonds of the belief in Christ.
Take my scare gift.
Tame the wings of freedom.

Enslave the weak

Blame him for your past.
Blame him for his lies.
Break the holy cross
to show him where the truth is.

Now you are strong enough
to lead your life.
You have the power
to destroy christian lies.
