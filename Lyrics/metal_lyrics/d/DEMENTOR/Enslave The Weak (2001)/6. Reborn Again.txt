I gaze into the dark abyss
Full of hate and blasphemy
My soul awaits reality

In a blaze of darkness
My flesh is soaked
In the glory of sin
Lead me down your path
Reborn again.....

Damnation screams
Surrendering to the darkness
I'm consumed with transgression

Hail my pagan misdeeds
My soul is blessed with sin
For now I will rise
Lead me down your path
Reborn again.....

New eternal blood
It flows into me
I can taste the cleansing

As I grasp the inverted cross
My soul is set free
For I am Reborn Again
