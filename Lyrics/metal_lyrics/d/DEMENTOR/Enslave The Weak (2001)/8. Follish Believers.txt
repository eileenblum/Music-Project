Believe us
There is no god
There never has been
There never will be

All your life
They told you lies
Promise eternal life
the time has come
to be set free
and to be your own master

Your god is dead
Foolish Believers
Has never risen
Foolish Believers
Has never existed
Foolish Believers
Your mind now free

Leaving to a new reality
Birth of a new life
Believe the godless truth
For it will set you free

Your god is dead
Foolish Believers
Has never risen
Foolish Believers
Has never existed
Foolish Believers
