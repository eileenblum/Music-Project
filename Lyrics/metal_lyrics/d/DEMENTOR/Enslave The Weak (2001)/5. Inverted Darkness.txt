Lust for endlessness
Craving eternity
Vile transgressor
Granted immortality
Take my hand
Unrighteous one
We will reign supreme
In blasphemy
(Inverted Darkness)
Unholy ones
Become one
Hail and praise
The end of Christianity
We crush and burn
The house of god
Invert his cross
Bleed eternal hate
Lust within my darkness
Burn into me
Your sadistic thoughts
I am now your lord
Gods of detest
Join my immortal soul
In hell's flames
(Inverted Darkness)
