In my mind
A worthless world
Consumed by
My sinful thoughts

Suicide the only way
To release my pain
Knife of power
Suffocate my life

Slash my flesh
Pierce my veins
Fuck my mind
End my life

Death claws my soul
Life slowly leaves
My dying body
All torment gone

Lord of the dead
I ask you
Take me
Kill me

Death Is Coming
My blood flows free
Death Is Coming
No more pain
Death Is Coming
I am set free
Death Is Coming
