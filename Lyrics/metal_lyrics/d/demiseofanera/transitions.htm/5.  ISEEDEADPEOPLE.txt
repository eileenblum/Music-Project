We have fallen to the deepest cracks in the world
We are only seconds away from the human waste
We came as romans but we turned out as soldiers
We are watching the horizon as it is burning away

I am going to crush your every dream of hope
And make total wreckage with an empty fucking smile

We are watching the world die with our own eyes
And we can't digest that we're breathing lies

Head up, stay strong. Fake a smile, move on.
Head up, stay strong. Fake a smile, move on.

I am going to crush your every dream of hope
And make total wreckage with an empty fucking smile

We are watching the world die with our own eyes
And we can't digest that we're breathing lies

We watch ourselves die
