The blood runs through my veins
I can't stand this world of pain
I got nerves but I can't feel

On my way to an endless life of hope &amp; glory
Away from this world of shame
I watch you from my eye as you slip away

A corruption is near &amp; the angels escape
My mind is filled with my dark days past

You're just a teardrop in a world unknown from life
I say goodbye as I travel beyond infinity

There is no tomorrow, suffering is gone
I feel nothing, heaven says "welcome home"

The voices inside of my head is speaking to me and no one else
The suffering from yesterday is just a memory from my past

You're just a teardrop in a world unknown from life
I say goodbye as I travel beyond infinity

The curses inside of me is going to bring me down (BRING ME DOWN)
The rage built inside of me will never leave, it rips me apart from the inside out

You're just a teardrop in a world unknown from life
