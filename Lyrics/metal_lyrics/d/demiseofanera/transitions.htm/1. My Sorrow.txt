I dragged her lifeless body to the deepest seas.
Please show me the way out of this fucking hell.
You could guide me to heaven with this sorrow.
I have fallen into darkness, my so called home.

The screams came from the bottom of her lungs, the cries for help.

The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking key

I feel the demons crawling inside of me
I'll drag you to hell so you can feel me every day
Every step I take is a step closer to my funeral
Can't you feel that I'm rotting away from you?

The screams came from the bottom of his lungs, he cried for help.

The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking key

With the sins around your neck
I can finally breathe again
You got what you deserved
In exile to nothing
Nothing but a paradise

A paradise for beings like you

The screams came from the bottom of their lungs, the cries for help

The regrets are crawling on my back
My eyes are heavy from all I've seen
I can't believe I gave you my heart
Since you threw away the fucking key
