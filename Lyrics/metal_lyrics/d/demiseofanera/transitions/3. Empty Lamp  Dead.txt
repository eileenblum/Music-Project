If I could rewind every single moment with you
Lies wouldn't roll on your tongue

You're such an endseeker falling through the cracks
Do you really know what 'empty' fucking means?
I can promise you that things will never be the same
Do you wanna know my plans on a fucking revenge?

On a fucking revenge

So I took off and left it all behind

Are you going to leave me roses when I'm gone?
I would rather die then stay here with you.
I will not accept your apologize because I know I can't trust you
Are you going to leave me roses when I'm done?
I would rather die then stay here with you.
I will not accept your apologize because I know I can't trust you

Before another disaster will appear I must let it all slip away.
And I know this will always be a part of me and I can't escape.
How will you apologize me when I am empty and dead?
How will you overcome yourself

When your life is an sinking ship?

Are you going to leave me roses when I'm gone?
I would rather die then stay here with you.
I will not accept your apologize because I know I can't trust you
Are you going to leave me roses when I'm done?
I would rather die then stay here with you.
I will not accept your apologize because I know I can't trust you

Why did you leave me broken?
