My soul has spoken, a part of me just died
And I feel sorry for all the things I've done

You tore me apart this time
And there we were, against eachother
Little talks became argues
Your blood were no longer inside
Who will help you when I cannot help myself
Careless of what could happen
And when the anger took over
There were no turning back

My soul has spoken,
a part of me just died
And I feel sorry for the things I've done
My heart is broken,
A part of me have died
And I feel sorry for all the things I've done

You were no longer alive
Why didn't we take it with words?
What would I tell your nearest?
"You know accidents accure?"
I don't think so
I guess people like me don't belong in a normal life
Cause were too fucking insecure

My soul has spoken,
a part of me just died
And I feel sorry for the things I've done
My heart is broken,
A part of me have died
And I feel sorry for all the things I've done

It hurts to know that you're not with us anymore
I wish I could make it up to you
Someday, somehow
But I'm too afraid to die, atleast by suicide
So don't count on me, I guess the gates of hades
Are better for people like me
Im such a traitor, a disappointment for humanity

My soul has spoken,
a part of me just died
And I feel sorry for the things I've done
My heart is broken,
A part of me have died
And I feel sorry for all the things I've done
