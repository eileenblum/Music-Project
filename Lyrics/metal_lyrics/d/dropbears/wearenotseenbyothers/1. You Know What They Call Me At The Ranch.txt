We dance

We dance the same moonlight

There is a mist in hope and peace
We come together to make it easy
Enchanted kingdoms, imploding as we speak
Forward flipping through a vulture culture of infinity
To only find ourselves on our knees
To clear the mist that distorts between
Make it easy

Castles made of crystals
Give a majestic ray
To the ones who will let it
Come in damaged
The ceilings will crack and grey
The barbed edges will surely end your days

Donât let the grace drip
It's only gonna let the sun stay down
This is really something to dance till your heart bleeds sound

I canât describe my feelings inside
I tried
Open up my eyes, push faith to the side
I tried
I never thought that this would be the last night that I hear you breathe

Peel and seal your letters
Keep them safe and cherish the words you wrote
Lay it in someoneâs hands they can send it to a place you havenât been

OH
CUNT
