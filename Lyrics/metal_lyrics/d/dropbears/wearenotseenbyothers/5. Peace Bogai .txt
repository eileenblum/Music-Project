Crawl 
Bow to your knees and pray for the rain
Poison the rival to start again
But this is where your heart comes in
No more backing off
This is what were going to be

And let the night fall
To let my mind run free
Stuck in dreamscapes
There calling
Theyâre calling my name
I hold it to you
I hear you calling my name
I hold it to you
Thereâs no way your getting out

But this is where your heart comes in
No more backing off

We are constantly sinking drowning in our thoughts
We are constantly sinking nothings good enough
And when itâs all done
And when were left to run
Your picking yourself up
Help yourself up
Why does your face?
Seen better on the floor
Human emotions
Arenât here anymore

And let the night fall
To let my mind run free
Stuck in dreamscapes
Theyâre calling my name
We are constantly sinking drowning in our thoughts
We are constantly sinking nothings good enough
I hold it to you
Thereâs no way your getting out

But this is where your heart comes in
No more backing off

Bow to your knees and pray for the rain
Poison the rival to start again.
