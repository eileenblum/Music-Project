By name by nature
He holds the streets with his blackened fist
Heart burns desire
For the one who can cage abyss

We are all the first thing that comes to our heads
Set aside the love for ourselves and share the light
Share the light

Inhale your love
Exhale your hate

Run into the night to gain up all your fight
A never-ending circle that goes on, on and on
And on

Counting, counting the fucking sheep
Will not, will not get you to sleep
This time, this time the ends never meet
Because the fallen are at there feet

Now that your king, big shot, not taking orders from others
Man the troops to fight cloak and dagger, cheap shots, air strike.
All you had to do was man up and let the sunshine in but no itâs too hard.
Your shutters are permanently shut taking breath from others cause yours isnât enough
We are all the first thing that comes to our heads
Set aside the love for ourselves and share the light
Share the light

Counting, counting the fucking sheep
Will not, will not get you to sleep
This time, this time the ends never meet
Because the fallen are at there feet
