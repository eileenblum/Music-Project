This place is filled with eyes
And their watching every step we take
This town gives me shivers
And no ones even there
To see my colours bleeding off me
Iâll be the one who splits at the seams
And read the dripping word empathy
Under the fallen bridge beneath the sea

Come clear me out of empathy
Come clear me out of everything
Come clear me out to start again
Come clear me out of everything

Its hard to tell if its over
On this woeful night
Were getting closer under the street light
I never would believe our entity
Never would reflect to flee the scene
Breathe for me

The rocks falling from the side of the mountain
Make up for beautiful skies
The rocks falling from the side of the mountain
Make up for beautiful skies
Under the bridge beneath the sea

Itâs hard to tell if its over
On this woeful night
Were getting closer under the street light
I never would believe out entity
Never would reflect to flee the scene
Breathe for me

Itâs hard to tell if its over
Were getting closer under the street light
Were getting closer on this woeful night

Colours bleeding from me as I fall apart at the seams
Reading my dripping words
That are falling beneath the sky
