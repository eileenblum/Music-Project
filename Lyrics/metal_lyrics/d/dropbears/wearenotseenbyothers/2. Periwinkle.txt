Wear your tainted cloak
Iâll wear my discoloured fur
pressures for the ones who pray for
pressures for the ones who yearn
out numbered by the sentinel swarms all around me
doubts on taking the point
ill hold my own, my fort, my strong hold
and scream my passion
let them fuckers in!

It wonât seem the same no more
To spit fire and run away
Yeah

Hoping for a clear shot to be at one with my brothers
And fell the warmth dwelling beneath my feet
Beneath my feet

Wear your hooded cloak
Weâll discuss this in the shade
Wolves out side your door
Itâs a game and your being played
We are not seen by others

We are not seen by others
Common victims fall for common dreads
We are not seen by others
Your sign of wisdom helps my path exist
And for the years and for the moments
Brings a smile to both our faces
We are not seen by others
A nameless force that pierce the chest

Two ways to a rainbow
No luck no gold at the end
Two ways to a rainbow
Passion alight within
Two ways to a rainbow
No luck no gold at the end
Two ways to a rainbow
Passion alight within
