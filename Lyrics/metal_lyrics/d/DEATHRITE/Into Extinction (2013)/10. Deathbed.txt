Manifestation eternal Resignation
Howl of black wolf; Claws of the Beast
Choking Hands taking Breath
Cursed by the crow death comes slow
These are 500 Days of winter
You canÂ´t Ignore the Prophecy
Hunted and Outlawed
It gets us all
Everyone â it gets us all
Staring deep in the Throat of the Beast
In the ruthless eyes of the Demon
Surrounded Defection this place has never seen Light
Mountains covered in grey our Suffocation our Deathbed our Destiny
