Born with a needle in the eye
Reminding me I've suffered all the time
Born to sell the life that wasn't mine
Running away hiding from black clouds
Can't take off the suit - The suit of a hypocrite
The suit of a liar
Crucified, smiling and swallowing knives
Your always welcome in the temple of sacrifice
Death above life broken mirrors scars will never heal
We left ourselves destroyed
This road leads to nowhere
Riding the dark horse of desperation
Illusion is the secret till the guillotine drops
