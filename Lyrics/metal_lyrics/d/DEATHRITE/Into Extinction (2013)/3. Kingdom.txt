Written in Blood; Seed of Horror
Starving till Death
The Emperor of Wastelands Bounded by Sorrow
Enslaved through those fucking snakes
Revenge of the Apostates
We are the Bastards; the forgotten Children
Try to erase us they will not succeed
We are the Cancer â Incurable!
Swallow your Kingdom
No one will escape
Lungs are already blackened
Ripped off skin like rotten Leafs in fall
We bring you fear and Horrible Dreams
We donÂ´t need to Breathe
WeÂ´re breathing through you
Another curse is born
We swallow your sun
Another curse is born we swallow youâreâ¦
Kingdom â Burn!!!
Born under the Guillotine
Born with a needle in the eye
Reminding me IÂ´ve Suffered all the time
Born to sell a Life that wasnât mine
Running away hiding from Black Clouds
CanÂ´t take off the suit
The suit of a Hypocrite
The Suit of a Liar
Crucified, Smiling and swallowing knifes
YouÂ´re always welcome in Temple of Sacrifice
Death above Life Broken Mirrors Scars will never heal
We left ourselves destroyed
This Road leads to nowhere
Riding the Dark Horse of Desperation
Illusion is the Secret till the Guillotine Drops
