Extinction of Humanity
Raped by the Hand of your God
Get yourself lost in Disease and Disgust
Bring the Plague
Spread the Black Wings of Death
Dirty Blood Blackened Hearts Medication wonât save us from ourselves
No salvation Isolation
Ruin life Regardless Human Decline
Sinking into blood soaked dust
Blood runs cold darkness swallows you whole
No Torch is shining Shadows you canÂ´t escape
Total disgrace dragged into gloom
Acid rain peels the flesh from your bone
Torture-Tempest-Bring on the Plague
Torture-Sickness-Bring on the Plague
