The Circle is closing in
Captured in Darkness and Damnation
Made to be wrong; the unwritten curse;
The crown of Thorns is ours
We inhaled Rejection
WeÂ´re exhaling Doom
This is Death from above
Youâre Shields like Paper
Your wall like Glass
The Torch will lead
Our Rage is the Bullet
Youâre Empire that Target
Your whole System will Fall
Buildings of Gold turn into Stone
Blood washes the Streets
The Arrow of Revenge
Opens the Gates to your own Hell
