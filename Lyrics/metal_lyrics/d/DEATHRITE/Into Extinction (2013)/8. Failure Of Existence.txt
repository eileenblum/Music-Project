Failure of Existence
Carry the Cross of Damnation
DonÂ´t need to survive â Sacrifice
Hit the Nails Through my wrists
Bloody thorns tears will never dry
Loving a Nightmare is living a Dream
ThereÂ´s no Empowerment to Rise
The Ocean is blackened
Smell the Brimstone
Taste the Steel of the Blade
DonÂ´t judge â Martyr me
Begging for Silence
Chop off your ears
IÂ´ll eat your fucking tongue
Every Bone will sink everyone will rot
