Awake - They kept us down
Arise - They are afraid
Concrete Crumbled
Silence is a horrible Noise
Strange voices calling your name
Paranoid Soldiers digging their graves
This Place is forsaken
Psychoses the Essentials of the Ultimate Fear
Possession the Leader of your inner self-conflict
WeÂ´re breathing Immortality
