Obscurity throwing shadows
Blinded by the golden Age
Lack of Innocence canât hide the Infection
Drunken by Darkness Addiction kills the Fear
Souls becoming blue Smoke
Permanence paralyzes our fate
Colliding Planets
The Birth of an Infernal Universe
Burning crosses mutilated bodies
Ruthless Hill
Guarded by the Hands of the Infamous
Gasmasks the only chance to breath
Cannibalism the only chance toâ¦eat!!!
