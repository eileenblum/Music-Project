Forgotten victims
Threatened of an evil breed
Relentless Wings of Revenge â relentless Wings
Longing for cure longing for Reparations
The Evolution of an evil Breed
The Parasites deep in your spine
The breeding Cancer under your flesh
This is the beauty of taking Lifeâs
Sowing fear reaping Death
WeÂ´re burning your Fields to the Ground
Our Unspeakable Rage
Is like Gasoline in our Veins
Relentless wings of Revenge ârelentless Wings
