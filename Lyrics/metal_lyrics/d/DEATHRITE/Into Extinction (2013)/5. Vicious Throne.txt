The Throne is ours your Regime will fall
We bite the hand that feeds
This is revenge rage Boils our Blood
Desperation is the Impulse
The Legion of Damned we rise with the Devil
Your Resistance is useless our Anger Dazed the Pain
WeÂ´re Armed with hate and Contempt
Your Soldiers are dead and your castles still burn
We want your Head!!!
Tyranny ends here Prophecies become real
WeÂ´ll take hostages â Burning crosses
Sunlight is rare the Altars of Doom
Human creation built on Degeneration
We Conquer the Crown
Your whole empire will burn
WeÂ´ll bring death and disease
