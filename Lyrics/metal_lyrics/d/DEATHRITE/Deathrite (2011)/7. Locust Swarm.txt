A Black Howl you didnÂ´t hear before
A swarm of Locusts obscures the deep blue Sky
Is it a Dream or is it Demise
WeÂ´re going tossing the hymn of death with the verse of Rejection scream the Choruses of Revenge
WeÂ´re all knew we knew it would happen
We knew it for so long unconsciousness canÂ´t change it
Or ship of Gold sank long ago
Bring another Plaque
In a Heart of a different Reign
