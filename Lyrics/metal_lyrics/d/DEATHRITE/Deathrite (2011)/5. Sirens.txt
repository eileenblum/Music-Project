Death Surrounded Demons and Sirens Sinking
Paranoid Breathless
Black Shadows
Hunting you Beasts
Whisper in your ear
Feel the Breath behind your Neck
An awful voice Inside of my head
The Mask of the Goat releasing Death
Boiling Blood Numbing coldness
Pulse of Dead Night
Kill everything
Nothing remains
Eat your soul cremated skulls
Purple Sky turns into Black
Sun has set
Raising Death
Swallow the Light
Pulse of the Dead Night
