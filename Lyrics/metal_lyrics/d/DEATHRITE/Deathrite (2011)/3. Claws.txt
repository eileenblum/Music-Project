Locked Doors Trapped into a burning House of Lies
A Pack of Hyenas waiting outside
Cold sweat looking for some rotten flesh
A Billion Red shiny eyes fulfill the Dark night longing for shelter crawl into your fucking self
Excruciating Pain
So fucking terrified
No one will hear you they will find you
Sharpen their teeth
On broken Bloody Bones
Claws penetrate your skin
Bite off your flesh stabbed wounds
Swallow nails down your throat hunted by nightmares
On A Blood paved Dead End roades
