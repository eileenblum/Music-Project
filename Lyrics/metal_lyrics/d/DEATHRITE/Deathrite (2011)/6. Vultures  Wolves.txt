Dressed in Black trench coats
Armed with daggers and rusty knifes
Blacklisted theyÂ´ll find you
We are riding on demon wings
Hiding behind ruins
Beware Rattlesnakes Vultures
Stare the Death right into eyes
Hunting for bloody Souls
And broken wrists
We want your gold
All of it weÂ´re the Black Wolves
Searching for Blood
