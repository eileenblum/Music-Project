Disorder, WeÂ´re all enslaved
Fallen Comrades rotten
Under Guns and Hand Grenades
War modified our Skin
Scars Dominate the Sight of our Body
Suffer misery is our Attendant
We donÂ´t Freeze or Sweat
Born dead âRegret
Sinking deeper fallen fasterâ¦Collapse!
Encased by smell of burning Flesh
Fed up with shit treated like rats
Fucking death threats darkest Sinners
Damn cold nuclear winter
