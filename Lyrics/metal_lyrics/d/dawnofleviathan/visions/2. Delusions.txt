Here I stand on the ashes of mind that has been entombed in silence; here we suffer in the realm of
attrition. I will not echo your words as they resonate in defiance, you cannot comprehend the somber
beauty.

I donât know how I can take this, whilst weâre forced to kneel before vultures, emptiness is just another
tomb that consumes us. Lost in a labyrinth of anguish, Iâm just trying to find my way out and conclude
my mourning.

Oh, how the skies have fallen, unending delusions come forth to curse all of us.

As I gaze upon the sunset, I can feel the eyes of deceit glaring through the abyss that has been left inside
of me. At last weâve come into the starless night that will define us as obscured minds just waiting to expire.

Why, suddenly, are your tears falling? We've only got ourselves to blame, living fantasy and fiction but
now we are now awake. The reason why you are all dying? Are you fucking insane? This scourge has
descended upon us; behold your final fucking grave.

The winds are motion; our time has come to an end.
