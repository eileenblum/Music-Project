I am the disconnection separating you from everything
I have seen your world be corrupted (fall to nothing).
You have brought this plague upon yourselves.

Why have you abandoned us? Why have you forsaken us?
I deceive; how can't you see that this world is over?

Seeking a way to find a meaning; the essence of our souls.
Finding solace in the lights our eyes behold; why are these lights fading away?
The skies will keep on falling down.

The stars keep on burning out.

My dreams will keep on dying, no longer will I draw on hope.
But when I close my eyes, these visions bring me back to you.

But when I close my eyes, these visions bring me back to you.
These visions bring me back to you.

Look into the eyes of a being so broken, fallen into the depths of a world; soul consuming.
The days all turn to gray as we march into the cold arms of our graves to be.

In this suffering you will find nothing, a point of bleak inception
A picture perfect destruction of a mind wrapped in doubt
You're nothing to me; you are nothing to me

My dreams will keep on dying, no longer will I draw on hope.
But when I close my eyes, these visions bring me back to you.

These visions bring me back to you.

Seeking a way to find a meaning; the essence of our souls.
Finding solace in the lights our eyes behold; why are these lights fading away?
The skies will keep on falling down.
Why are these lights fading away; the stars keep on burning out.
Why are these skies fading away; the lights keep on burning out again.
