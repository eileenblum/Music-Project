I fucked up so many times
I've lost count of my falls, but I still recall when everything I did was great.
But all just turned to shit for me.
I need to prove myself, I can be someone else.

It's all that it takes, one moment that change the foundation you stand on
Your time, your one chance to redeem your mistakes.
And your history will be gone.

When will it be my time?
Will I actually leave and actually try?
Somehow I'll shape my fate, just hope it's not too late.
I can make my own luck, just need to brake these chains that keep me stuck.
So I fall to my knees.

Give me strength to rise above.
About time I wake up and save myself.
