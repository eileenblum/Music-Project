It's like you all try to be someone else and I just can't take the hoax anymore.
It's absurd, you're all so lifeless.
On the surface, all the same, the same product with different names.

Trying to be what you see on the screen.
But your personality's dead.
What you try to achieve is obscene.
And it needs to be said.

Don't you think it's time you show me who you are?
It's always an act, just like you're hiding something.
Let me in I want to know the real you.
As a matter of fact, this time it's all or nothing.

Life is more than copy paste, why would you walk on the same old track?
It's yourself that you've erased.
It's not too late, wake the fuck up and just come back!
