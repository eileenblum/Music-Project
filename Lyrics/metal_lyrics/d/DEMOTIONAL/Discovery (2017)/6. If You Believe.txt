I'm standing right here before you.
This is who I am, won't you understand
I am exposing my heart to you.

So come let's go.

Try me one more time, just another chance, have some faith in me.
Try me one more time, we can find romance, if you just believe!
Just believe, just believe, just believe,!

What you see is what you get, there's no Russian roulette with me.
Why would I deceive, so just believe.

I can't persuade you, nothing that I can do.
So much hesitation, but I just can't undo my past.
Wish you could see my point of view.
Please don't let me down,
Please don't let me down,
Please don't let me down,
Please don't let me down,
Please don't let me down!
