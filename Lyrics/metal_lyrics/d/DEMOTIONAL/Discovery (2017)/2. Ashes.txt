Now it seems so lonely
As I stumble through the answers
In this endless agony

The resentment fans the flames

Like pouring salt into a wound
The silence beckons me
Is this the ending?

Through the fire rise from the ashes
Never giving in
Every soul ascends to war
There's a Phoenix in us all

Now theres no surrender (no surrender)
And the anger seems to linger in this hopeless tragedy
A decision has been made
No more broken promises will speak my name

Fans the flames (fans the flames)
Now as I move on
The question still remains
(The question still remains)
Is this the ending?

Through the fire rise from the ashes
Every soul ascends to war
Theres a Phoenix in us all (end)
