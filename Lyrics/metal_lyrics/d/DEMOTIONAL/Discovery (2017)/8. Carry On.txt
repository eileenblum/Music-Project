A lifetime on the road we've run, never been so satisfied.
Now all we've done is in the past, well at least we've had a blast.

For all the things we've shared, dreams come, true.
More parties will be had.
We will never quit on you.

Feels like it had just begun, now that all is said and done we
Just want to carry on, oh just carry on.
Feels like it had just begun, one last show before we're gone
Just want to carry on, oh just carry on.

Every thought of our nights together fills our heart with contentment.
From the start, you've reassured me, this is why we were meant to be.
Like brothers in arms, you are the reason we travel the world just to meet once again, but in the end.

Far away but we still can remember where we're from.
But it's never until, until the end that you become well aware of the what the journey really has done to your soul.
When you realize, the journey was the goal.
