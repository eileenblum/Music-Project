Breaking boundaries with my stride
Maybe I am out of line
Always was before my time
But I don't care this world is mine
To the gallows
Break down the doors
Life is best when raw and uncut
Make your own way when all the doors been shut
Feel no regret I'm by your side
We are creating our own reality
We're not falling (we're not falling)
To the gallows in a bliss stupidity
We're going all in (going all in)
To find your purpose
To make sense
Ready to find out what is hiding inside myself?
My reckoning
Sprint head first
No doubt in my mind
Got no time to stay behind
Jump right into
See what I'll find
Maybe I'm out of my mind but at least I'm not blind
We are creating our own reality
We're not falling (we're not falling)
To the gallows in a bliss stupidity
We're going all in (going all in)
We are the adventures
The odds are against us
No one here can stop us now
To the gallows and then beyond
We are creating our own reality
We're not falling (we're not falling)
To the gallows in a bliss stupidity
We're going all in (going all in)
We are creating our own reality
We're not falling (we're not falling)
To the gallows in a bliss stupidity
We're going all in (going all in)
We are creating our own reality
We're not falling (we're not falling)
To the gallows in a bliss stupidity
We're going all in (going all in)
