Well I'm not proud about decisions I have made
There has been sorrow caused by my mistakes
But when the ground is shaking and the walls are caving in I'm the man to follow
It's time to testify I've had a thorn in my side all my life
Even though I've always kept moving on I've been frowned upon
There's only so much a man can take and I think that I'm about to break
Well I'm not proud about decisions I have made
There has been sorrow caused by my mistakes
But when the ground is shaking and the walls are caving in I'm the man to follow
(The man to follow)
Bruised, tears, corrosion and pain
Defining me, it's time to repay
Give me one good reason to fight
I'd like to see you make it on your own
I don't even want this throne
Well I'm not proud about decisions I have made
There has been sorrow caused by my mistakes
But when the ground is shaking and the walls are caving in I'm the man to follow
(The man to follow)
Well I'm not proud about decisions I have made
There has been sorrow caused by my mistakes
But when the ground is shaking and the walls are caving in I'm the man to follow
(The man to follow)
(A man to follow)
(A man to follow)
I don't have to defend a thing that I've done
Silent virtue, an unsustainable order has begun
Why me of everyone?
Well I'm not proud about decisions I have made
There has been sorrow caused by my mistakes
But when the ground is shaking and the walls are caving in I'm the man to follow
(Follow)
(A man to follow)
(A man to follow)
