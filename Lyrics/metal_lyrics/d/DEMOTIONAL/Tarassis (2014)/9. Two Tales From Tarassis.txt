Fear me!
Fear me!
Beginning of the end and I don't even know why I'm here
I tried my best and failed
My eyes are open wide but still I can't see clear
I want to be alone and I just want to go home
This is not where I belong
I don't know what I've done wrong
No one will save me and nothing's easy
When you don't even know if you're the one responsible
Why do you fear me?
Why do you fear me?
Free me!
Free me!
The walls are closing in
My heart is beating so much faster
When did it all begin?
My life has always been a total disaster
Scream till my throat is soar
I need to break through this door
I can't think straight any more
I don't know what I've done wrong (I've done wrong)
No one will save me and nothing's easy
When you don't even know if you're the one responsible
Why do you fear me?
Why do you fear me?
(No one will save me and nothing's easy)
(When you don't even know if you're the one responsible)
Fear me!
I don't know what I've done wrong (I've done wrong)
No one to save me and nothing's easy
When you don't even know if you're the one responsible
Why do you fear me?
Why do you fear me?
