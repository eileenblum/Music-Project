Can't you see you left me here down on my knees
Hear me scream
There's nothing left but broken dreams
I woke up in an empty room
Could still smell your perfume
Nothing left but time we spent
I wish it wouldn't end so soon
We were on fire from dusk till dawn
But you grew tired and just moved on
I can't believe that you would ask something like this of me
To just forget the life we had and live in tragedy
I can still feel your warm side of my bed
Though you left you're still in my head
Can't you see you left me here down on my knees
Hear me scream
There's nothing left but broken dreams
But life goes on at least so they say though this loneliness is breaking me
I try to defend but it's hard to pretend when I'm drifting around deranged in a haze
I've tried to reason with my self
Was it something I did or was it someone else
I just can't get you of my mind
The questions eating me inside
My heart is screaming I can't stay on track
Can't take this life I just want you back
Can't you see you left me here down on my knees
Hear me scream
There's nothing left but broken dreams
Grasping for something that isn't there can someone out there hear my prayer
I thought my heart was in good care
The light has turned into grey
I will remain in yesterday
I miss you
Can't you see you left me here down on my knees
Hear me scream
There's nothing left but broken dreams
