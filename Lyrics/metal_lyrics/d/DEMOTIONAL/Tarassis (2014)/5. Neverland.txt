It feels like poison running through my mind.
An anchor of visions that just drags me down
Try to run, but no one sees.
Im withering when you are not around

Try to move forward, to stand up straight. But I fear that itÂ´s to late.

When you got your back against the wall, and you feel all alone out there
and the world crumbles around you, itÂ´t not that I donÂ´t care.
ItÂ´s just a memories after all, the history we shared
But itÂ´s hard to make a breakthrough, when weÂ´re breathing the same air.

You just canÂ´t expect me too always be there for you
what you had is gone I'm moving on so fuck you

For not making this go easy, you never really could let go
I know that I seem cold, but I want you too know

When you got your back against the wall, and you feel all alone out there
and the world crumbles around you, itÂ´t not that I donÂ´t care.
ItÂ´s just a memories after all, the history we shared
But itÂ´s hard to make a breakthrough, when weÂ´re breathing the same air.

It had only just begun when you decided to move on
