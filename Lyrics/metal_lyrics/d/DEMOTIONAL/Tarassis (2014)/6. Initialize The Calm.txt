Ignorance is the reason for this unhealable scar
You say you can do better but it's part of who you are
Desperate need of guidance for a goal so hard to find
You're searching for a purpose, you can see but you are blind
Running around in circles, yet you think you're in control
You've become your own defiance, and created a world without a soul
One chance to save what's yours
It ain't a lot but it's all you got
So I commence calm to set you free
There can only be war between you and me
We've been down this road so many times, but you never really seem to see the signs
Your foolish quest for normality will end up nothing but my apathy
You try to break me since you were born
Defile and hate me I'm being torn to pieces slowly
You just populate me like a swarm
The calm is coming it won't be long
Can't take the suffering one day I'm gone
A new beginning is what it takes to carry on
Lay in my arms you've gone so far
Hold your breath as I release the calm (release the calm)
I tried to change the future but there's no hope for humanity
You only build up to destroy
You take what you desire
There's nothing I could ever do to make you realize that there's no you without me
You have to seize the fires
Why do you want me to die?
Lay in my arms you've gone so far
Hold your breath as I release the calm
Under the sun you know that nothings really new (nothings really new)
As you rebirth I still have faith in you
Lay in my arms, you've gone so far
Hold your breath as I release the calm (release the calm)
Lay in my arms, you've gone so far
Hold your breath as I release the calm (release the calm)
