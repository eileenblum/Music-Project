The desperation when you speak
a sense of weakness in your tone
I could have helped but actually
I kind of like to see you fall from your pedistal of slaughter
cause when it breaks I donÂ´t think youÂ´ve got what it takes
try to stay above the water
If you still think that you are so much better than the others

You canÂ´t be touched, you canÂ´t be blamed
You play it rough, but this is not a game

Safe, safe and sound. A betrayal is all you need to fall
YouÂ´re in an Illusion after all

Eyes that look down upon the weak
for your contemplation
the domination that you seek is the reason why you never really gonna feel okey
No matter if you scream we wonÂ´t obey
Nothing that you do will make us bend over and crumble to your lies
You reek of insecurity
When itÂ´s all gone dont come to me
YouÂ´re looking for salvaton but no one else here but you can set you free

You can pretend that nothing ends

Safe, safe and sound. A betrayal is all you need to fall
YouÂ´re in an Illusion after all
