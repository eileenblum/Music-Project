[feat. Pontus Hjelm]Throw all your jealousy aside
Forget your pride
There can be miracles when worlds collide
Blinded by your own ego
Just reach out your hand and find strength in someone else
Madness, you have to let go
Try to understand we have to unite in the end
It won't be long till all the barriers are gone
And all the miracles become one
Try to open up your mind
There's no limit if we combine all the independent voices of our time
Back tied yet condescending
Got nothing to share but what are you hiding from
Lay back and stop defending
One day I swear you'll wake up and regret the man you have become
It won't be long till all the barriers are gone
And all the miracles become one
You've been fighting alone in vain
You've got nothing to lose but everything to gain
It won't be long till all the barriers are gone
And all the miracles become one
It won't be long till all the barriers are gone
And all the miracles become one
Shout louder shout together till the end
Fight harder
Fight cause we are all the same
Stand stronger
Stand beside me
Beside me
Beside me
