All I've had it
All I do is make believe
I regret it
Time to raise some anarchy
A resurrection is what I need
Reveal the hidden prison and then break free
Action speaks louder than words and all I've done is talking
Break free from the wheel of slaves and then start walking cause I've had enough
And I've been blind and it's time that I clear my mind
In time you'll find it's not worth falling in line
I know that I will break free
There's a fire inside my soul
There is a hero in me
And I will climb this black hole
Every day the same old thing
Just like a mindless drone
I've been lost all my life but I will find my way home
And I've been blind and it's time that I clear my mind
In time you'll find it's not worth falling in line
There's a hero in me [5x]
You need to hear me
It's time to shine
You need to hear me
For the sake of feeling alive
I need to break free
Resurrect the hero in me
And I've been blind and it's time that I clear my mind
In time you'll find it's not worth falling in line
There's a hero in me [5x]
