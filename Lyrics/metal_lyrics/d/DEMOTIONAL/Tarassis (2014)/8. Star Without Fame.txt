I've watched myself in mirrors
Wanted to tear of my face
Wish that I could be someone but life is just an endless race
I tried my best
I've tried so hard
But I was fucked right from the start
I wrestled in chains
Tried to grow wings
I've tried to exploit whatever life brings
I beat my chest so hard screaming that I will prevail
But it is hard to carry on when all you do is fail
There is so much out there but I want more
I always wanted to be someone they adore
Only the strong survive is what they say
I only wish that counts for me
I am the only one they should adore
But I'm a star without the fame
Since I could walk (since I could walk) I wanted more (I wanted more)
But I'm a child without a name
I could lay down and die but at least I have to try to fight the odds of life
And never will I compromise
I bang my head right through the wall
One day I'll rise above it all
I have a goal
I have an aim
God save my soul
I am insane
Don't count me out I'll fight as long as I'm free
You haven't heard the last of me
I am the one they should adore
But I'm a star with the fame
Since I could walk I wanted more
But I'm a child without a name
I am the one they should adore
But I'm a star with the fame
Since I could walk I wanted more
But I'm a child without a name
