Can't seem to understand myself
I make no sense
Something is happening
I try to walk tall
But I stumble and fall
A fucking tragedy

I thought
There was an answer to this mystery
I'm caught
In the middle of this tragedy

[Chorus:]
When you're sleeping with
Your eyes wide open
And nothing is the same
Dreams are broken
Dreams are broken

I have this voice inside my head
That just won't quit
And it drives me insane
Think of you all the time
Thought I know you're not mine

Try to keep my sanity
I think of every single word
That you have said
Alone, I'm a prisoner inside my head

[Chorus:]
When you're sleeping with
Your eyes wide open
And nothing is the same
Words unspoken

[Chorus:]
When you're sleeping with
Your eyes wide open
And nothing is the same
Words unspoken
