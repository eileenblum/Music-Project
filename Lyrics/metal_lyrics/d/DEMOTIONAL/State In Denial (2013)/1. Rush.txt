So here we are once again, once again
Pick up the pase and move forward
Fear for the world that we're too late
There's no way back
Always on the run, this is our fate

It has begun
We're on the run
Always on the run

[Chorus:]
Faster
There's no way to turn back
Faster
Are we trying in vain?
Remember you're not alone
You are not alone
Almost there but it's always the same

I see the world in a blur, in a blur
Rushing through life like a shadow
And I feel that it's absurd
There's no way back
Things will never be like they were

It has begun
We're on the run
Always on the run

[Chorus:]
Faster
There's no way to turn back
Faster
Are we trying in vain?
Remember you're not alone
You are not alone
Almost there but it's always the same

There's no way to turn back
Are we trying in vain?
You are not alone

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Faster
There's no way to turn back
Faster
Are we trying in vain?
Remember you're not alone
You are not alone
Almost there but it's always the same

[Chorus:]
Faster
There's no way to turn back
Faster
Are we trying in vain?
Remember you're not alone
You are not alone
Almost there but it's always the same
