This time it's over
And you're no longer here
And I won't give it a try

I won't keep fighting
For something that won't last
There's no use to deny
Or live in the past

I'll keep this simple
I will speak the truth
Listen close to me and comprehend

This time there's no turning back
You have crossed the line

Everything has an end
Everyone has a call
But do you feel alive

Tell me
Can't you hear me?
Understand me
I'm falling down in dispair

Help me
Come and save me
Understand me
I'm shouting, but there's no one there

[Chorus:]
I understand that there's no room for me
But tell me
Are you feeling alive?
(Are you feeling alive?)
And even though you've moved on in life
I ask you
Are you feeling alive?

How can I decide what to believe?
Is it the truth you're telling me?
You break me down just to see
If you're in control

I close my eyes and feel regret
Even though I try I can't forget
That you can sink so low

This time I will make a stand
Everything you touch turns in to sand
I don't need you

I know you're safer where you are
The touch of time has made its call
Do you feel alive?

Tell me
Can't you save me?
Can't you hear me?
I'm falling down in dispair

Help me
Come and save me
Understand me
I'm shouting, but there's no one there

[Chorus:]
I understand that there's no room for me
But tell me
Are you feeling alive?
(Are you feeling alive?)
And even though you've moved on in life
I ask you
Are you feeling alive?
(Are you feeling alive?)

Even though you've moved on in life
I ask you
Are you feeling alive?
Alive, yeah

[Chorus:]
And even though you've moved on in life
I ask you
Are you feeling alive?
I understand that there's no room for me
But tell me
Are you feeling alive?

And even though you've moved on in life
I ask you
