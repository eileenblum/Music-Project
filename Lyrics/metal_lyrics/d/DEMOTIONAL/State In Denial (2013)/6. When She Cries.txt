I run heading for shelter
A safe-house far away
Trying to escape my agony
To keep my demons from finding me
I try to disconnect my mind
Take control of my thoughts
Trying to leave it all behind
But I always end up caught

I don't need a goal tonight
Don't need advice
Just to be with you
Could save my life

[Chorus:]
You cry yourself to sleep tonight
Tears run down your cheek
I want to be by your side
To tell you everything's all right

I lay myself to sleep
Without you there for me
When I walk through life I walk alone
In the dark
I'll die, without you by my side
That's why I need you
Just to be with you
Could save my life

[Chorus:]
You cry yourself to sleep tonight
Tears run down your cheek
I want to be by your side
To tell you everything's all right

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
You cry yourself to sleep tonight
Tears run down your cheek
I want to be by your side
To tell you everything's all right
