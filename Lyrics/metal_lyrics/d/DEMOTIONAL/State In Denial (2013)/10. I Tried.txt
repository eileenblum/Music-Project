I don't even know
Why I put up with this shit anymore
I've been a punching bag for too long
It's time to settle the score

You need to hear this
This time it's real
It's time you know just what I feel

You had the voice of angels
A smile divine
You touched my sould
Bodies entwined

You were the fire
In which I burned
I was devoured
But then you turned

Blinded by love I didn't see the shit
That you did to me
The feelings that I had for you
Tried to conquer sanity
What's going on?
How could this be?
I just don't know what to believe
I try to change you to the way you were

Feels like I don't even know you
Where's the girl I used to know?

Even with you I feel so alone
The times we had
The times we shared
How can you be so cold?
I can take much
But this shit is getting old

[Chorus:]
And I feel you already left me
And I've been living in a lie
Can't you see there's nothing left here?
Though I tried, I tried, I tried

The sacrifice I did for you
And you just split my heart in two
Must realize even though it hurt
That you have gone from good to dirt

This is what I need
I must be free
'Cause you are slowly killing me
I won't be there for you anymore

I blame myself
It's my own fault
That things have gone this far
When I look at you
I don't know who you are

Things will never be the same
As they were before
This is my goodbye
I can't take this no more

[Chorus:]
And I feel you already left me
And I've been living in a lie
Can't you see there's nothing left here?
Though I tried, I tried, I tried

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
And I feel you already left me
And I've been living in a lie
Can't you see there's nothing left here?
Though I tried, I tried, I tried

[Chorus:]
And I feel you already left me
And I've been living in a lie
Can't you see there's nothing left here?
Though I tried, I tried, I tried
