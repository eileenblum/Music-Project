I feel fear and regret
Can we please reconnect
Tell me... how did this happen
I need you now and forever
Let me be your saviour

[Chorus:]
These things are breaking
The inside of me
It's tearing me up inside
My heart is broken now
But now I know that we will survive again
Again

Cold tears and pain
That's what drives us insane
Every day we play the same game
And nothing ever change
The end is near
But we have
Nothing to fear

These things are breaking
The inside of me
My heart is broken now
But now I know that we will survive again

Eeyo

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
These things are breaking
The inside of me
It's tearing me up inside
My heart is broken now
But now I know that we will survive again

[Chorus:]
These things are breaking
The inside of me
It's tearing me up inside
My heart is broken now
But now I know that we will survive again
