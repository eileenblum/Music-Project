It's time I open up my eyes
I should have seen
That you've been drowning in lies

For years I thought
That nothing's wrong at all
When you needed
Someone to break your fall

I should have listened to your silence
Maybe then you'd still be here

I can't believe that you are gone
I didn't see
That you were suffering all along
You were fighting on your own
Despite how close I were
I never saw what was wrong

For years I thought
That nothing's wrong at all
When you needed
Someone to break your fall

I should have listened to your silence
Maybe then you'd still be here
(With me)

I should have known
Needles and pills
And I was too blind to see
It seems so unreal
That you are gone
Oh God
Oh God, help me
