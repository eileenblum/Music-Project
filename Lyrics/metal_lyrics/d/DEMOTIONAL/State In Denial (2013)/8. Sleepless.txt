As the time flies by
I feel my heart stops beating
Just let it go
Is this real?
Is this reality?
I cannot breathe
I cannot fucking breathe

[Chorus:]
There's no escape from this past we had
I am sleepless
There's no escape from this past we had
I am sleepless
I am sleepless

Third time strike three
The last time
I won't fall like the rest of them
You have made your point
And I have made mine
You're going down for the last time
Last time

[Chorus:]
There's no escape from this past we had
I am sleepless
There's no escape from this past we had
I am sleepless

I can't breathe
This is choking me
I can't breathe
This is choking me

I can't breathe
This is choking me
I can't breathe
This is choking... me

[Chorus:]
There's no escape from this past we had
I am sleepless
I am sleepless
There's no escape from this past we had
I am sleepless
I am sleepless

I am sleepless
I am sleepless
