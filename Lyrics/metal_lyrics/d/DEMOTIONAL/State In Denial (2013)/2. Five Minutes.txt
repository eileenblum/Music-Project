I don't use to fall
Don't need directions
Follow me when storms are in your way
'Cause I am not afraid
To break bones
I'm a force in motion
I've always thought that I was strong
Now what the fuck is going on?

But now I'm standing here
Have I been living in denial?
I'm trying desperately to see
Can I fight what isn't there
Is this the first time I will fail?
I didn't know that stone could bleed

[Chorus:]
Don't you worry
I'll be fine
The only thing that can heal me now is time
I need to be alone
There's no need to understand
I need five minutes on my own

Stunned, I'm paralyzed
Where did this come from?
Did you really think
That you could hide something like this
From me?
You've reached the bottom
My life was perfect yesterday
Now you've killed something in me

The man I used to be
Is no longer to be seen here
But no longer will you hide
The truth away from me
I will face my greatest fear
Though I'm feeling dead inside

[Chorus:]
Don't you worry
I'll be fine
The only thing that can heal me now is time
I need to be alone
There's no need to understand
I need five minutes on my own

Can't recognize my own, damn reflection
The only thing I knew was pure perfection
But you have raped our bond
Our connection
This thing can only go in one direction now

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Don't you worry
I'll be fine
The only thing that can heal me now is time
I need to be alone
There's no need to understand
I need five minutes on my own

[Chorus:]
Don't you worry
I'll be fine
The only thing that can heal me now is time
I need to be alone
There's no need to understand
I need five minutes on my own

My own
My own
Yaow
