Telling you, you live in solitude
Telling you, you live in solitude
Telling you, you live in solitude
Telling you, you live in solitude

Hey hey, we're telling you
Don't live in solitude
All that we want
Is all that we have inside
Define these words
And break free of this curse
This season of new era
Reason will guide you right
One for all
And all for one we say
Against them all
We fight a war each day

For all we said
We will lead this group until we're dead
Fight this war
With blood sweat and tears
(Blood sweat and tears)
Can we have it all
Or is this not enough
One for all, and all for one

[Chorus:]
There's no brakes on this train
No fear in our eyes
We know our cause is right
Always commanding the game
We own the dice
We tell you what is wrong
We tell you what is right

Let's keep this simple
Don't be afraid
We are the incredible
The unforgettable
Leaving no one behind
This one's for all, cause all is one

One for all
And all for one we say
Against them all
We fight a war each day

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
There's no brakes on this train
No fear in our eyes
We know our cause is right
(We know our cause is right)
Always commanding the game
We own the dice
We tell you what is wrong
We tell you what is right
We tell you what is right
We tell you what is right
