I can't believe
You're feeding me these lies
Living in a state in denial
It's a world of our own creation
Stop pretending that you are in fear
We're not in fear

Is this really what you want?
A controlled state of mind
The human nature is jeopardized
Disguising themselves as the savior
Keeping track of all our failures

[Chorus:]
I won't be living here in silence
Something is wrong here
I try to show you
But you just look the other way
Thinking you will act another day

For what it's worth
We will help you to discover
The voice of truth out there
Who claims he's your big brother

Go, go, go

Read between the lines
And look behind the bloodstained curtains
Open up your eyes for the truth
Why are you waiting
You can't be serious about this
(You can't be serious about this)
Satisfied with your blindness

How fucking long does it take
To figure out what is wrong or right?
Clear your sight
Remember our rights
And let's begin this fight
The evolution is starting right now
Right now

[Chorus:]
I won't be living here in silence
Something is wrong here
I try to show you
But you just look the other way
Thinking you will act another day

Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

[Chorus:]
I won't be living here in silence
Something is wrong here
I try to show you
But you just look the other way
Thinking you will act another day

Oh
Another day
