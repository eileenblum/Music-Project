Tonight we ride on clouds of fire
We're damned by gods our deaths conspired
We fear no mortals in these worlds
The gift we give you is your soul

Fly with us tonight

The sky
Will wake
Black fire
Will break

Fly on through the night
We built an alliance
Our numbers are strong

We gather
But we don't pray to gods
What fools what lunatics
They must think of us

On this night we will journey
Far beyond this world
And you must know that we will never
Come back home again

But now we must fly
Beasts in the night
Tragic in the sky
Battlefield in sight

Storm gathers strong
Cold blackened flame
Tell us our future
Stories of the slain

Fire grows strong
Freezing our skin
Vision is clouded
The rain will begin

Dangerous creatures
Those that opposed us
Raped all their power
Bartered with warlocks
Cheated the demons
For ancient spells
The blackened fire
Waits to consume us

So now we'll say goodbye
Because tonight we die
So we say goodbye
So we'll say goodbye
We die

Tonight we ride on clouds of fire
We're damned by gods our deaths conspired
We fear no mortals in these worlds
The gift we give you is your soul
