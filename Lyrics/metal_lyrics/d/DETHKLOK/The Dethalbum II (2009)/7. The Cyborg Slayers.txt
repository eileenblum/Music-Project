Punch it
Accelerate
Smoke screens
Infiltrate
Kill the lights
Place the bait
Wait for signals
Detonate

Go
Move
Go
Now

Conflagrate
Seal the bridge
Take the supports away
Tear it down
Leave no trace
We'll move like ghosts this day

Orders in
Moving out
Secret quarters
Ocean bound
Arctic ice
Frozen home
UFO
Cyborg chrome

Go
Move
Go
Now

Conflagrate
Seal the bridge
Take the supports away
Tear it down
Leave no trace
We'll move like ghosts this day
Sensors heat
Infrared fleet
Mechanized opponents
There is no retreat

Crush
Seize
Burn
Kill
Leave no one alive
Let no one survive
Mortification
We annihilate
Electro-degration
We're gonna mutilate
Leave no one alive
Let no one survive
Get moving now

Alright
Divide and collide

Go

Divide collide
Cross us you're denied
We'll provide your insides
To your robotic eyes
We'll blow up your way home
Your big ships made of chrome
Divide collide
Looks like your battery died

Conflagrate
Seal the bridge
Take the supports away
Tear it down
Leave no trace
We'll move like ghosts this day
Sensors heat
Infrared fleet
Mechanized opponents
There is no retreat

Crush
Seize
Burn
Kill
Leave no one alive
Let no one survive
Mortification
We annihilate
Electro-degration
We're gonna mutilate
Leave no one alive
Let no one survive

Mortification
We annihilate
Electro-degration
We're gonna mutilate

Leave no one alive
Let no one survive
