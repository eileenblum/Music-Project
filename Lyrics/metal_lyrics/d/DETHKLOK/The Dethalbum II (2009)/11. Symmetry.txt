Symmetry
Carbon calcium blood
Find your own disease
Excellent breeding left you without one

Try to be at ease
They're staring daggers at you
But you'll get your piece
You'll take them down one by one

Walk

Symmetry
Your infrastructure is planned
Time to cut designs
Every thread's in place this time

Now you understand
The competition is stiff
Got the upper hand
Ready to strut your stuff

Walk

I would kill to have your face
I would kill to have your body
I would kill to have your skull
I would kill to have your skin

Breathless you pose burning with spite
Beauty is so crude contrite
Venom you bleed bile within
Knowing their fate architect sin

Twist and maneuver you've practiced your part
Starving and hacking you've created art
Painfully limping now this is your life
Take them all down and raise up your knife

Breathless you pose burning with spite
Beauty is so crude contrite
Venom you bleed bile within
Knowing their fate architect sin

Now walk
