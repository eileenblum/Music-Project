We climb molten rock
Sweating bleeding we can't stop
Dream demons whisper spells
To punish the dwellers in earthly hell

Starved still we reach the top
Close our eyes look toward the gods
Summon fire from the earth
Incite the flames we fear not death

Magma heats
We fear not death
Darkened hills
We fear not death
Molten rock
We fear not death
Volcanic kills
We fear not death

Mantle crust ignites
Bleeding heated birth
Will we die tonight?
Punished by the earth

Highland fires
Run for shelter
Incantations
Help no better
Frozen human
While they're fleeing
Horrid sculpture
Forever screaming

Mantle crust ignites
Bleeding heated birth
Will we die tonight?
Punished by the earth

Come and take us
We mock your anger
We laugh at your power
We fear not death
We fear not death

We challenge your fury
We'll dive in to lava
And burn like we're cinders
We fear not death
We fear not death
