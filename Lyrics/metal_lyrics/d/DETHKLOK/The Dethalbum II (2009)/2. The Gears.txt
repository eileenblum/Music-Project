You're here because
You're one of us
We are the strength
We are the soldiers

You've journeyed far
You've battled hard
And now you will receive the
Permanent reward

You've conquered pain
You've conquered fear
Stand proud and salute
The bloodied flag here

You pledged your death and
Your last breath
You are the gears
You are the gears

We fear not our mortality
We'll serve to the best of our ability
We give our lives to our masters
We vow to smite our enemies

You've mastered death
You've mastered fear
You are transformed
You are stronger

Now that you're here
A branded gear
Burned in your flesh
We'll seal the deal

You've conquered fire
You've conquered ice
You've tasted blood
You've taken life

You're here because
You're one of us
Become a gear
Become a gear

We fear not our mortality
We'll serve to the best of our ability
We give our lives to our masters
We vow to smite our enemies

We bless your skin
We bless you with our mark
Become a part of the clock
Become a gear

You've conquered pain
We've conquered pain
You've conquered fear
We've conquered fear
You fear not your mortality
Become a gear
(We are the gears)

You've conquered pain
We've conquered pain
You've conquered fear
We've conquered fear
You fear not your mortality
You are a gear
(We are the gears)

We bless your skin
We bless you with our mark
Become a part of the clock
Become a gear

(We fear not our mortality)
