Racing through time
Souls prey lead blind
Interstellar mutilation

Comets speed forth
And bring death for earth

Time for your next destination

Galactic death
Hunts
Flies
Pushes
Through time
Space
Dimensions
It's seeking blood
Flesh
Souls
As slaves
To take into
Hell
In outer space

Advance your place
Pay to gain grace
Your salvation through defrayal

You will survive
So you think your
Bank receipts will tip the scale

Galactic death
Hunts
Flies
Pushes through
Time
Space
Dimensions
It's seeking blood
Flesh
Souls
As slaves
To take into
Hell
In outer space

Your time is coming tonight
You'll be killed at the speed of light
Destiny you can't fight
Crushed by comets
Transmogrified
Deth will bring you new life
A slave forever on the planet of hell
Eighty thousand years since the comet took flight
Your destiny is pain forever

The earthquakes
The clouded sky breathes fire
Lava sprays onto the seas
The oceans boil
The deserts freeze

Masses flee into the streets
Meteors fly with a magnetized heat
Crush and take human deceivers
Fry the souls of the non-believers

Smashing killing devouring all
No one is saved the chosen fall
Run with the hordes trample the weak
Crush the skulls of those that can't speak
Sweating bleeding your eyes go wide
The earth is ending it's about to collide
The clouds part the world goes black
The comet speeds forth for its final attack
