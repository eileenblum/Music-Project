Fire

Fly hard into the night
Strapped to a rocket ignited

Last meal sits in your body
Gasoline turpentine gunpowder glycerin

Last rites given to you
Genuflecting with a torch

Punishment outweighs the crime
Explode into the desert sky

Say your goodbyes
That was your life
You'll pay all your penance
Laser cannon death sentence

Die

I'm a rocket
A roman candle
A fucking missile
On my way to hell

I'm a martyr
A saint of sinners
And you will fear me in my death

There's no one that can make me
Repent the things I've done

Evil is my prime objective
I explode and bestow your death

I'm a rocket
A fucking weapon
Of mass destruction
Destroy the planet
My lawyer fucked me
I won't get pardoned
The devil waits with fear in his eyes

Seethe blood blazing the sky
Strapped to the mode of destruction

Cell-mates explode in front
Barbecued bone fragments bloodied face
Blistered skin

Last moments near you now
As the countdown proceeds
Punishment is your reward
Laugh as they collect your life

Say your goodbyes
That was your life
You'll pay all your penance
Laser cannon death sentence
