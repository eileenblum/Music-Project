Punch your card 'cause your working day has started
and you're pushing hard for employee of the month
You got your tools of business and
They're bloodied by your clients and
You're off to work with your
Briefcase full of guts

Door to door you are searching for a buyer
Who will take the terms of your policy

You got an invitation to their living room
You're gonna demonstrate your products privately

You know that

I'm an employee
I have a degree
I'll fulfill your need
I will make you bleed
I'll rise to the top
Best one on the team
Kill outside the box
Hold you as you scream

I'll divide you into pieces
Sell them back and raise the price
Make a profit all your interests
You'll increase my sales tonight

I will increase
Productivity
I must increase
Productivity

A.B.K. [4x]
(Always Be Killing)

I'm an employee
I have a degree
I'll fulfill your need
I will make you bleed
I'll rise to the top
Best one on the team
Kill outside the box
Hold you as you scream
