[Deluxe Edition track]

Here comes the soul-collecting train of murder coming
It longs to take your putrid blackened soul away from you

Your face will leave your rotting head in the early morning
Your guts will leave your corpse your spine will break and crack in two

It cannot be stopped the train is fueled by chopped
bodies filled with sorrow there is no tomorrow
Ticket is your life ended by the knife
Called the Murder Train Eternity of Pain

Oh yeah you know what I'm talking about

There is no escape but death
For life is just a Murder Train a-Comin'
Now play those blues
