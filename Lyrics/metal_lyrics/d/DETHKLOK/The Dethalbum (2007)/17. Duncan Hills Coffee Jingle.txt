[Deluxe Edition track]

Do you folks like coffee?
Real coffee,
From the hills of Columbia?

The Duncan Hills will awake you,
From a thousand deaths.
A cup of blackened blood.
(Die, DIE!)
I'm dying for a cup.

Guatemalan blend.
Ethiopian,
French Vanilla Roast.
(Die, DIE!)
You're dying for a cup.

Prepare for ultimate flavor...
You're gonna get some, NOW!
And scream, for your cream!
