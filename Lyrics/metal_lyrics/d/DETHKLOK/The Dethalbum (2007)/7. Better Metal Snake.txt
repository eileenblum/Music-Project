War has been declared
We are forced to fight
Takes lives of my men
My Kingdom falls this night

You conquer with your serpent
and it's scales of molten steel

METAL SNAKE [x4]

Castles lay in ruin
Carcasses ignite
Bretheren's heads on posts
But still I must fight

I conjure with my fury
A masterful decree

I will build a beast
That will conquer you
Built of metal gears
Spears to run you through

BETTER METAL SNAKE [x4]

Now go seek devour
Inject your poison
And take their lives away

BETTER METAL SNAKE [x4]

It's gonna take your life tonight
Mechanical reptilian might
Shed its metal skin and destroy
It's such a better METAL SNAKE
