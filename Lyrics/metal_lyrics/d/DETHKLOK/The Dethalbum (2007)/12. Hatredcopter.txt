I fly a gigantic monster
I am captain evil stomper
I get to wear big black helmet
I pilot the Hatredcopter

I fly the beast made of steel
Thick knives that cut the night
Gas tank is filled with vengeance
Machine guns shooting spite
Can't find the thing that makes this thing take a hard turn right
I follow where it leads me night bat with wings of might

You will most likely die by the hands of my arm
When I come and fly and take off-a your face
with the front of my Hatredcopter

[scream]

I fly a gigantic monster
I am captain evil stomper
I get to wear big black helmet
I pilot the Hatredcopter

I fly the Hatredcopter
I'm going to hunt you down
I get paid lots of money
for all the bounties found
Can't seem to find the button
that turns the radar on
Can't work the hatredcopter
The hunt for you is on

I am likely to find
for my failure to fly
that I will be fired
for not killing you
cause that is my job
Hatredcopter

You will most likely die by the hands of my arm
When I come and fly and take off-a your face
with the front of my Hatredcopter
