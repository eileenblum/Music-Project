[Deluxe Edition track]

Tragedy goes away
Hate filled rage
Takes the stage

But you're neutered in the night
Blinded by the bine
Irony and spine
Sarcastic delight
Live to die on stage
Driven by the rage
Hating your own face
Comedic disgrace

HATREDY
HATREDY

Stand before the jury
Die in flames of fury
Comedy is DETH
HATREDY

Step into the spotlight
Laughter is a DETH-right
Crash and burn in horror

Make them squirm
Want to leave
After they buy their drinks

I hate this audience
Regardless of applaudience
Like to take you away
Burn in piles of hate

I hate the talent here
So dull and so full of fear
I'll beat you all to the punch
With an axe and a hack to the guts

I'll take the microphone stand
Run it through your neck
Cut off both your hands

Is this thing even fucking on?
Are you fucking deaf
Or just too scared to run

Please take my wife
Please take my wife
Then I'll take your life
Then I'll fuck your wife
Just a fucking joke
No it's kinda not
There's a little truth
In every single shot

Fueled by hate
Await your fate
Your time has come
To DIE on stage

It's funny
Because it's not

It's funny
Because it's not

It's funny
Because it's not

It's funny
Because it's not
Because it's not
Because it's not

Fueled by hate
Await your fate
Your time has come
To DIE on stage

Fueled by hate
Fueled by hate
Your time has come
To DIE on stage
DIE
DIE
DIE
