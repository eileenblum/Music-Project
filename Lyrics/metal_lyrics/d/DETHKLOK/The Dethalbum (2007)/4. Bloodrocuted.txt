You've been targeted in the night
by violent mercenaries.
Your identity's been confused
with one that looks like you
You're a simple man living life.
You are an electrician.
But there's a bounty on your head
A billion unmarked travelers checks.

RUN

Find your way deep into the woods.
The dogs can smell your path.
Try to find a way out of this.
There seems to be no chance.
Bounty hunters closer to you.
Start to remember back.
When you studied biology
back in your high school class.

Wait now, what did they say
about the human body and proportions of things?
Blood is an energy conductor.
I am full of that all I need is an outlet.

They're getting closer
but now you have a plan.
Lead them to the generator
where there's solid land.
The concrete floor will do just fine
and electric outlets.
Open up your veins and splash the blood
and hit the power lines.

Bloodrocuted
Bloodrocuted

You'll be bloodrocuted
You'll be bloodrocuted

You'll be bloodrocuted right now

Enemies stand dead in your blood
The stench of cooking skin.
All of them with their hair on end
Their eyes exploded in.
You stand with your arms bleeding still
You cannot stop the flow.
Though you are the victor tonight
your time has come to go.

go go go go go go
Your time has come to go
go go go go go go
Your time has come to go

Wait now, what did they say
about the human body and proportions of things?
Blood is an energy conductor.
I am full of that all I need is an outlet.

Bloodrocuted
