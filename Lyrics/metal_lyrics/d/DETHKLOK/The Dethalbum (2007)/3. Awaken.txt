Mustakrakish,
Mustakrakish.

The time has come to awaken him

I call upon the ancient lords of the underworld to bring forth this beast and,

Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,
Take the land that must be taken.
Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,
Devour worlds, smite, forsaken.

Rise up from your thousandth year of sleep,
Bring forth from your grave, eternally.

I command you to rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise

I am the conjuror of demons,
I'm the father of your death,
I bring forth the ancient evil,
I control his every breath,
I instigate your misfortune,
With the birth of killing trolls,
I awaken Armageddon,
Feeding on a thousand souls,
Awaken [x4]

Mustakrakish, Musta [x8]

Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,
Take the land that must be taken.
Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,
Devour worlds, smite, forsaken.

Rise up from your thousandth year of sleep,
Bring forth from your grave eternally.
Drink will die and land will all be burned
Mustakrakish, king and gate to worlds

I command you to rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise and,
Awaken.
