Born of evil in a fiery volcano
On a mutilated mission to inflict
merciless pain
Sacrifice your soul to the deity of DEATH
She's concocted your murder
And you've lost all your defenses
She was summoned by the
ancient wizards
To carry demon children in the
poisonous flood
Day of her conception the prophecy
was written
On the scrotum of a wizard in his
testicle blood

[Chorus:]
Run but you can't hide
The hunt is on
Your life is gone
CASTRATIKRON
Eyes they will go blind
If looked beyond
Your life is gone
CASTRATIKRON

Sharpened claws poisoned tip manicure
Painted skin hiding the beast within
Daggered heels designed to cut your face
No remorse crushing the human race

[Chorus]

Sharpened claws poisoned tip manicure
Painted skin hiding the beast within
Daggered heels designed to cut your face
No remorse KILLING the human race.
