[Deluxe Edition track]

I don't want to have to kill you
They'll find out and I will feel blue
Like to take all the skin off your face

Like to smash all your brains with a vase
With I could be a fly in your head
Lay my eggs that will rise from the dead

Ah [x8]

Oh I don't wanna have to hide you
It's so cold that I'll get the flue

Na [x16]

I don't want to [x4]

Na [x16]

I don't want to have to eat you
I won't fit into my swim suit

You've got so much flesh on top your bones
You could cause a bloody big cyclone
Grab a lance smash it straight through your ribs
Splash the blood onto my baby's bibs

Make a mess dripping crimson and bone
Break your face with a stale ice cream cone

I don't wanna have to [x4]
