[Deluxe Edition track]

Time lies trapped inside
Dark minds concubines
Blood Ocean
Crickets cry shriek the night
Trapped ticks rule the mind
Blood Ocean

The land's coagulated
And my mind's incarcerated
But my helmet's ventilated
With the souls of correlated

Though my father's fascinated
With the premises negated
And the night will be berated
With the souls of the deflated

Bleed bleed bleed bleed bleed bleed
Bleed bleed
Blood Ocean
Bleed bleed bleed bleed bleed
Bleed bleed
Blood Ocean

The land's coagulated
And my mind's incarcerated
But my helmet's ventilated
With the souls correlated

Though my father's fascinated
With the premises negated
And the night will be berated
With the souls of the deflated

You are gonna lose your mind
Tonight in oceans of blood
You are gonna drown and
Die tonight in oceans
In oceans
In oceans
Of Blood

Cracked smile flees the fight
Dark Riders spared the sight
BLOOD OCEAN
Tamed torch teels the tight
Mamed morch squeals the smite
BLOOD OCEAN

Identity is slated
And my pantry is deplated
But my hand husk has been crated
For my families all have fainted
And they sink but are not sated
And the screech of homeless hated
And I know the nameless mated
On the tip of frigid fated

I know who you are
I know who you are

You are gonna lose your mind
Tonight in oceans of blood
You are gonna drown and
Die tonight in oceans
In oceans
In oceans
Of Blood
Ocean
Blood Ocean
Blood Ocean
Blood Ocean
Blood
