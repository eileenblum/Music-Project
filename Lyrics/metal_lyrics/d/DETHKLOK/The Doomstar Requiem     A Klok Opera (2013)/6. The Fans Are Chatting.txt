[DETHKLOK MINUTE HOST]
Though Dethklok hasnât performed in a very long while.
A big show is coming up which will be just in time
because people around the world have been very concerned
about the lack of Toki Wartooth in the press world.
He hasnât been seen in public, where could he be?
The band released a statement:

[CFO]
Heâs fine donât worry about Toki.

[DETHKLOK MINUTE HOST]
Well heâs okay and weâll see when they play.
Thatâs the Dethklok minute. Have a great day.

[FANS]
Heâs been out of the public eye.
Weâre worried weâll be denied.
One fifth of our favorite band.
Weâre the power. Weâre the fans.
We want answers. Whereâs Toki? Whereâs Toki?
We want answers. Where is the man?

[FANS (CONTâD)]
Weâre going online weâre gonna get to the bottom of this.
Going online gunna get to the bottom of this.

[FAT FAN]
I heard a rumor from my roommate Matt
that he canât play guitar because he got too fat.

[WEIRD FACE FAN]
I heard Tokiâs at a rehab place
because he did so many drugs that
he melted his face.

[FAN THAT LOOKS LIKE A LIZARD]
I heard heâs getting plastic surgery done.
Theyâre putting in horns and cleaving his tongue.

[BALD FAN]
I heard heâs gone cause his hair went away.
Theyâre putting in transplants now heâs totally gay.

[FANS 1]
Youâre gay!

[FANS 2]
Youâre gay!

[FANS 1]
Youâre gay!

[FANS 2]
Youâre gay!

[MAGNUS]
You are all wrong you donât know the whole story.
Tokiâs been kidnapped with the girl by some men.
Oh Dethklok could save them but they canât be bothered.
These cowards may never see their Toki again!
Dethklok doesnât care about their best friends.
They could be responsible for their death!

[NATHAN]
Itâs good to be here tonight!
Lemme hear ya!

[CROWD]
[screams]

[NATHAN]
And on rhythm guitar Mr Toki Wartooth!!

[Hologram of Toki is glitching and fans see there is no Toki]

[CROWD]
Boooo!!!

[FANS]
We want Toki back! [8x]

[NATHAN]
Oh my god theyâre leaving the show.

[PICKLES]
We donât want our fans to go!

[NATHAN]
I think I know what I must do...
People of the world I want you to know.
Toki! Weâre coming to save you!
