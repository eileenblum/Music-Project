[Magnus]
Welcome to your resting place!
Please enjoy your stay!
I'll be your ambassador
Of sorrow and decay!

It takes patience; we are alike!
You have the strength, but the cunning's all mine!
I am the brains, you are the power!
The legacy of Dethklok will be devoured!

[Assassin]
I WILL TAKE THEM!
I WILL BREAK THEM!
I WILL CLAW AT THEIR FLESH AND FORSAKE THEM!
SEEK REVENGEANCE
FOR MY BROTHER!
I WON'T STOP UNTIL I'M SATISFIED!

[Magnus]
I'm not a terrible person!
I'm just a man filled with pain!
Cast out by the Klok to live in obscurity!
I will pay them back the same way!
I'm no murderer, I'm just a man!
I'm the judge and jury, and your case is in my hands!
You should be on my side, so should she!

[Both]
When Dethklok is imprisoned, the world will thank me!

[Magnus]
Whoa!
You are my bait!
They will come for you!
They'll be trapped!

Whoa!
I've been so patient!
My reward is owed!

Whoa!
My apologies!
You're just like me
A victim of the band!

Whoa!
I see it all to clearly!
They will live just like me
In obscurity!

[Toki]
Whoa!
You're scarin's me!
Whoa!

Whoa!
You're scarin's me!
Please don't hurts us
We ain't dones nothing wrong, my friend!

Whoa!

Whoa!
You're scarin's me!
