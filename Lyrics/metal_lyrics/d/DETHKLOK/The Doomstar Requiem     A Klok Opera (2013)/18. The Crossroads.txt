[NATHAN AND PICKLES]
My god. They killed him.

[SKISGAAR AND PICKLES]
What should we do?
What should we do?

[MURDERFACE]
This is our chance.
We should make a run for it now.
Because if that were me inside,
none of you would come to save me anyhow.

[NATHAN]
Youâre out of your mind.
Because if that were you inside,
Iâd use every breath and risk my life for you.

[DETHKLOK]
Letâs do what we came here to do.
