[NATHAN:]
Abigail and Toki
They might behind these walls

[ISHNIFUS:]
It must be you that rescues them
But I can help you through this door

[SKWISGAAR:]
At times like this
I wonders
Should we bes
A one-guitar band

[MURDERFACE:]
I still think you're crazy fools
A setup is at hand

[PICKLES:]
And I think we're in for
the fight of our lives

[NATHAN:]
Is it all worth it?
One of us could die

[ASSASSIN:]
Hold them all together
While I make my way
This will be an orgy of death
Throats will meet my blade

[PICKLES:]
Oh, I think this setup is a trap
Yes I'm telling you
There's no way to escape
They got us surrounded
We're unarmed and naked

No one's on their way
To come and save the day
No one's on their way
No one's on their way
No one's on their way
To come and save the day

[ISHNIFUS:]
Run
I order you
I'll create a distraction
So you can break through
Don't look back
Whatever you do

[ASSASSIN:]
You let them get away

[ISHNIFUS:]
I do not fear you

[ASSASSIN:]
Then you are a fool
And you will die
Ah!

[MAGNUS:]
What have you done?
You've murdered him
This wasn't part of
My plan

[ASSASSIN:]
This was never
Your plan
