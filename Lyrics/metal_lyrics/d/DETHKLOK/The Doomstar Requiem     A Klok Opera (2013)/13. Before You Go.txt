Before you go, I need your attention...

Many years ago, when I took this contract
I swore a sacred oath, to protect this new act
Never to deceive them, or put them in harm's way
Lead them into danger, or lead them astray
The circumstances changed, now I'm in the middle
Of the darkest times, this prophetic riddle
I cannot stand by, and refuse protection
Consider this my resignation from this whole profession!

I was a good man for this job, but it's time for me to go...
I cannot lead you further, oh, in my heart this truth I know...
I bid you all farewell, consider this a vacancy...
I wish you best of luck now, you will have been the greatest work I've ever done in my entire... life!

Good day to you...
Good day...
