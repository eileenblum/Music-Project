[Orlaag]
It appears as though Dethklok is going to rescue their "bandmate"...
And if they fail, we could lose everything...

[Crozier]
I could save them, or I could kill them, but I will do your bidding, my masters...

[Orlaag]
So much better now that he is under your control.

[Selatcia]
Yes... but you should know that we have a traitor amongst Dethklok,
and when the time is right, they will be put into action... but for now, we must watch them.
