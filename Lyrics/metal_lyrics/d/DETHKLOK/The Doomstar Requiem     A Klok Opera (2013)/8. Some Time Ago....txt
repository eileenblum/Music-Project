Magnus has been kicked out of the band.
I think the four of us understand
that we gotta make a record.
Gotta make it great.
Itâs our very first one. It must annihilate.
Since we fired the man we are short one artist.
We need to fill the void. We need a guitarist.
But heâs gotta fit right. Gotta be the right vibe.
Heâs gotta fucking rock because we are Dethklok.

[SKWISGAAR]

[PICKLES]
Look at all these hopeful auditioners.
Oh they came from so far away.
But if you show them you are the best then
YES you may have your way.
If you hack all them into pieces with your mighty shredding axe.

and you will be the only guitarist of DETHKLOK.

[SKWISGAAR]

[Skwisgaar begins playing. The auditioning guitarist donât even get a chance to play. They shoot through the roof, blow up, get sucked out of the window. Their guitars explode.]
