[PICKLES]
Oh, whatâs that sound?

[NATHAN]
Itâs the sound of angry musicians congregating.
Weâll have to fight out way through.

[PICKLES]
Looks like weâre not out yet.
These musicians ainât our friends.
Obscure and broke they hate us for never helping them out.

[NATHAN]
Theyâre holding us back.
Weâre under attack.
I can fight one or two.
But not all of these dudes.
We need a plan. Thereâs too many of âem.
I canât take em all.
We gotta think like one of em.

[PICKLES]
Looks like they got us beat.
Looks like weâll meet defeat.
What if we gave them no reason to hate us anymore.

[NATHAN]
Gimme the pen Iâm gonna write a
check so they can buy some
groceries and pay the rent.

[SKWISGAAR]
Takes my strings you could probably use ems.

[PICKLES]
Take my sticks and play the drums

[MURDERFACE]
Take my pick and play the bass.

[NATHAN]
Weâre gonna help you rock this place!

[DETHKLOK]
The only way to- get on through you
is given it back. Giving to you.
We wonât beat you. But we can help you.
It took some time to realize that we are just like you.

[PICKLES]
I canât believe how good it feels to be
giving to you, youâre giving back to me.
[2x]

[NATHAN]
Oh no, we mightâve beat em,
but these junkies, they need us to feed them.
We need some drugs.

[PICKLES]
I donât have none.

[SKWISGAAR]
Whats we gonna do?

[MURDERFACE]
Oh shit weâre fucked!

[DR ROCKZO]
Ku ku ku ku ku ku ku ku ku ku ku ku
cocaine!

[DR ROCKZO]
Ku ku Iâll fend em off.
Ku ku you save yourselves.

[DETHKLOK]
The only way to get on through you
is given it back. Giving to you.
We wonât beat you.
But we can help you.
It took some time to realize that we are just like you.

[PICKLES]
It feels so good. It feels so good.
Yeah. Oh no no no no.
It feeeeels so good.
So good Iâm giving to you.
