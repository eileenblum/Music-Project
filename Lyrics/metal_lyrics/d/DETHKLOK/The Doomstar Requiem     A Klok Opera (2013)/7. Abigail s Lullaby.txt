[ABIGAIL]
Donât be scared my little friend.
I am here with you.
Things have gotten so bad.
But I am here with you.
Weâll most likely die.
Theyâll pull off our skin.
Theyâll poke out our eyes.
Theyâll play in our blood.
Be cannibalized.

Theyâll bath us in acid.
Theyâll chew through our brains.
Theyâll chop up our guts and cut up our veins.
But close your eyes. Drift away.
Dream into your happy place.
Remember the finest moments in your life.
Itâs your power and your strength.
Your happy place.
Go there now. Now. Go. Go there now.
