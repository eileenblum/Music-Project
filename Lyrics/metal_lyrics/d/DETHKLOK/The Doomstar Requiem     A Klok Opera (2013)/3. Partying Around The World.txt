[Nathan]
I feel this feeling and I think I'm unhappy
Since whats-his-face and whats-her-name have been missing
The mood around here's been crappy
But as bad as it gets, our duty is knowing
That we have a job to keep this party GOING!

[Nathan, Pickles, Skwisgaar and Murderface]
Snortin' coke!
Sniffin' glue!
Smokin' pots!
It's what we do!
Drinkin' beer!
Drinkin' wine!
And champagnes!
So divine!

Partying around the world!
Partying around the world!
Partying around the world!

[Skwisgaar]
Crystals meth!

My name is Skwisgaar, let's go to a Swiss bar
Drink some brewskies, hang out with some floozies
Then we'll gets slurpees, maybe gets herpes
Keeps the partys goings! Keeps the partys goings!

[Pickles]
Oh, no, no, we don't miss people
Oh, we can hardly tell that they're gone!

[Murderface]
If you think bad thoughts, push 'em away!

[Skwisgaar]
With certains peoples missing and the rumors goings round,
Our records sell better every days!
And the--

[Nathan]
Abigail, I knew when I met you
You would have that look in your eye
You're sucking on an apple pie in the sky
Uh, you're also gonna suck my dick

Oh yeah, well--

[Pickles]
Keep the party going!

[Pickles and Nathan]
Keep the party going!
Keep the party going!
Keep the party going!
Keep the party going!
Keep the party going!
Keep the party going!
Keep the party going!

[Pickles]
My turn!

My name is Pickles, I like Don Rickles
Hanging out with Kony, playing with a pony
Shooting wolves with Palin, never ever failin'
Snorting coke off tits, I'm the one that plays the hits

[Murderface]
Oh my God!

[Crowd]
Where's Toki?
Where's Toki?
Where's Toki?

[Band]
NO COMMENT!

[Nathan]
My name is Nathan, the doobies are a-blazin'
Pissing in an old cave, jacking off on Bozo's grave
Crapping in a lunch bag, give it to an old hag
Keep the party going, ya know what I mean?

[Band]
Partying around the world!
Partying around the world!
Partying around the world!
Partying around!
Partying around the world!
Partying around the world!
Partying around the world!
Partying around!

Oh, no, no, we don't miss people!
Oh, we hardly notice that they're gone!

[Crowd]
Where's Toki?
