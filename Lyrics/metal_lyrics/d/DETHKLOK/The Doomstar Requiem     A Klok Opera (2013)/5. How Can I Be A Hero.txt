[Nathan]
What is a hero?
Who am I?
I'm a simple multi-platinum rockstar
Living a simple multi-platinum life
I don't know 'bout that crazy world
Just driving this A-list mile
I'm just a filthy rich economic power
And all that I need, I buy

Oh, how can I be a hero
When I'm just a krillionare?
There ain't no groupie blowjob
That can help me to prepare
How can I be a hero
When I'm just a man that is larger than life?
I'm just a tiny little minuscule superstar trying to get by

[Pickles]
Maybe if we threw this life away
We could learn to live a different way

[Murderface]
Oh, I'll go back to school and get myself a degree
In something fucking useless like psychology

[Skwisgaar]
I could gets myself a wifes and leads a different lifes
And hides out in the bathroom and jack offs every nights

[Pickles]
Start driving a hybrid, brag that I'm saving the planet

[Skwisgaar]
Quotes SNL's at works all days and acts like it's adlibs

[Nathan]
But if that's the life of a regular jackoff
I'll probably just kill myself

Yeah!

How can I be a hero
When my dick is big as a shoe?
There ain't no all-access passes
That will help me to break through
So many items on my backstage rider
But there ain't no bravery
I'm just the 7th top financial power, but I'm little ol' me

[Pickles]
How can I be a hero
When I get everything for free?

[Skwisgaar]
I've screweds more girls than Wilt Chamberlains
I can proves it with my STD's

[Band]
How can I be a hero
When we're the world's largest metal band?

[Nathan]
I'll never be a hero
'Cause I'm better than everyone, but I'm just a man

I'm afraid the answer is no
