Fata Sidus Oritur
Fata Sidus Oritur
Fata Sidus Oritur
Fata Sidus Oritur

Dethklok has disbanded
One of them was taken
We look to the skies to watch a new star awaken...

[Ishnifus:]
Oh, the Doomstar has brought all the dethly light
And the star will turn to blood on this prophet's night
And the Prophecy has warned us that one of us must die...
Before this is all over... one of us must die!

[Chanting]

DoomSTAR!
DoomSTAR!

[One of Us Must Die]

[Ofdensen:]
There was a time when the five of them were just a band, but that was yesterday!
So, innocent of this church and all these prophecies, but then they took him away!
The times have changed
The air's begun to taste of metal
The whales they chant
A constant warning
They keep singing
And repeating

One of Us Must Die!
One of Us Must DIE!

(Klokkateers)

Bow before the Doomstar, Klok keeps ticking further!

[Ofdensen:]
Life on Earth will be eclipsed
The looming Metalocalypse!

One of you must die!
One of you must die!

[Priest:]
Dethklok, they must be rejoined
Evil, it must be destroyed
No more apathetic stories
They can't learn to be heroic
Light and soul, that will be our salvation...
