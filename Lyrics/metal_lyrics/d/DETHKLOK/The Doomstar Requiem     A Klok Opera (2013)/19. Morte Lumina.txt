You took my brother from me.

[NATHAN]
Well weâd rather burn in Hell then let you take ours.

[MAGNUS]
My god... what is this!!???

One of them has died itâs all my fault.
I canât believe what Iâve seen.
These men have the power of Gods.
I tried to bring them down.
I am not the hero. Iâm the villain.
And I too must go down.

Arhhhhhhh!!!!!

[NATHAN]
Men and women of the Earth
I give to you the grand rebirth
of our brother on guitar.

The blazing star. It burns so bright.
The darkened power. The DETHLY LIGHT.
Bring it on now. This is our time.
Weâre the new regime together weâll fight.
