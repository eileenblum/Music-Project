[cuts from "Some Time Ago" to a long ass, but great, guitar solo... until Toki messes up]

[Pickles]
Oh, you did so well...

[Nathan]
But you blew the last part...

[Pickles]
Oh, you were so very close...

[Nathan]
But it all fell apart...

[William]
It is time for you to go...

[Skwisgaar]
But befores you leaves, you must understand...
That nobody's ever made me plays this wells...
Therefores...
I want you in this band!
