[Bonus Track][NATHAN:]
the glowing clouds the diamondâs birth
the spiral cluster descends to earth
the nebulas conspire to bring
the signifier and the deth of a king
Iâm a man with a tortured sight
I fear this dream will end tonight
the water beasts continue singing
we try to wake but weâre not dreaming
Iâm gonna find you
Iâm running out of time
I gotta play this part
this is my lot in life
with this power I am endowed
the end is coming so bring it on now

[PICKLES:]
Oh the keeper wields his scythe
Oh you gotta kiss this life goodbye
there is another place beyond weâll meet in time
and i will greet you all in the next life yeah

[NATHAN:]
the blazing star it burns so bright
the darkened power the dethly light
bring it on now this is our time
weâre the new regime together weâll fight
Bring it on now!

the blazing star it burns so bright
the darkened power the dethly light
bring it on now this is our time
weâre the new regime together weâll fight
Bring it on now!
