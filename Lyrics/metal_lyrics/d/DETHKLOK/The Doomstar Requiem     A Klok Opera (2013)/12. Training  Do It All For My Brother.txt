[CFO]
We are running out of time.
Youâve trained and youâve been primed.
But before we send you out into the night.
Accept these gifts, these munitions.
They will aide your dark missions.
Use them with your power and your might.

[JOMFRU]
Laser shooting lyric pen.
Poison dart drum stick.
Razor wire guitar strings.
Bass pick throwing star.
Hot Topic gift card...
that combined with a polymer will explode.

[ISHNIFUS]
As the prophecy foretold the DOOMSTAR has been born.
And you all will be endowed with a power known to none.
The Deth lights are within you all waiting to be woken.
And when the five are united the evil will be broken.

I know that you doubt yourself
but you donât have to worry because we believe in you.
Oh they already see you as a leader
and you can carry them into glory
but itâs all up to you you you.
You may not know you have the power
but itâs very clear to me.
The closer you are to your brother
the stronger you will be

[PICKLES]
Stop using that word âbrotherâ
itâs weird to me.

[DETHKLOK]
[ad-libbed agreement]

[JOMFRU]
How dare you?
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
This is blasphemous what you say.
He is your family and he is your heart.

[MURDERFACE]
But when you say that it feels so very gay.

[JOMFRU]
You must understand that if I had my brother alive,
the strength I would have.
But you donât youâre all selfish bastards
and you make me sick to my stomach-

Because I do it all for my brother.
Yes my heart still burns for you.
Oh Iâd wheel into battle if it meant one more moment with you
but itâs too late you know that itâs true.

[JOMFRU AND BROTHER]
Iâll live for you and Iâll die for you.
And Iâll love for you and Iâll cry for you.

[ALL]
Do it all for my brother do it all. [6x]

[NATHAN]
Enough of this.
Weâve had as much as we can take of this brother stuff.
We will go forth and rescue our BANDMATE as discussed.
