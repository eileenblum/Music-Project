Hard charged and convinced it's contagious
Put away in a box like a beast
Sweat salt watch my back
Like a crime boss
My life's blood siphoned out of me

Take my power and trade it away
Now I live in Kryptonite
Do what I must to have it again
And I'll explode the planet tonight

I'm on the inside separated by concrete
The wretched filth being
Slashed and shivved
Meet a man who can find a way out
I'll promise everything
So that I can live

Deep in a coffin they will carry me
Next to a corpse to be buried alive
Await my savior in a waking nightmare
The shovel scraping is my blackened new life

I am deception
I'm the curse haunting you
And you're tracking me down
And the hounds are on the loose

I am a shadow
Evading all your moves
Now you're hunting the demon
DETH to his pursuit

I must dig myself out of this coffin
I must dig myself out of this earth
I will bathe my body in a pool of blood
I will drink the liquid and I will be
Reborn

Reborn
Reborn

I am deception
I'm the curse haunting you
And you're tracking me down
And the hounds are on the loose

I am a shadow
Evading all your moves
Now you're hunting the demon
DETH to his pursuit

The giant has awaken
You drink my blood and drown
Wrath and raving I will not stop
You'll never take me down
You'll never take me down
You'll never take me down

I'm alive
