Blind men escape from the sky
Condemned the Klok counts down

The ghost that's still alive
Infests your mind with fog

Venom spearing
Spells adhering
Sweating fearing
Madness takes you down
Down

Man dies he was stricken
With a scepter
In his hands clutching ancient script
Foretold of world's destruction
Blackened acid leaking from his lips

Night raven casts alarming shadows
Dwellers hide fearing ending times
A sharpened trident blessed by elder
Wizards
Not enough to quell the DETH
Tonight

Black cloud
Countdown
Oceans blood
Beasts drown

Lights dim
Moon dies
Earth's heart
Leaks life

They bow
Spare us of our sins
Spare us of our sins
Spare us of our sins

Too late now
The end it must begin
The story it has been
Alive within your skin

Bargain
Sacrifice our tribe
One will give their life
The youngest virgin soul

Deny
The frenzied panicking
Slaying our own king
Anarchistically

Chaos
The screaming coward filth
The family blood is spilled
Too scared to know the guilt

Farewell
The ending must arrive
The locusts come to thrive
No one will survive

Fire streams sear through the night
The demons bastard's rabid

The outstretched wings will dive
Entrap the weakened souls

Climbing through the sky
The warriors are charging

The last sight known to man
While the planet burns

Venom spearing
Spells adhering
Sweating fearing
Madness takes you down

Rejoin
It's darker
This time
Conclude it all

Rejoin
It's darker
This time
Conclude it all
