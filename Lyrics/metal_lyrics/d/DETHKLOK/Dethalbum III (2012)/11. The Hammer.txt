I was born from liquid hatred
An exoskeleton of steel
My nerves are cauterized
I feel no pain
I am your nightmare and
It's far too real

I am the hammer
I'll bring it down
So vile
I am the jury
I blast
I am the hangman
I strike
The despicable
I am the presence
That you will not enchant
Your final sight if you cross my path
I am the demon lord so lower your glance
A razor front and a blade in back
I am the hammer

Hammer

Beat it down
Crush the granite
I'm the beast
I'm the planet

I consume
Virgin blood
I'm the thunder
I'm the flood

I am the Kaiser
I bring forth the raze
Unqualified mutants
Kindling the blaze

Apocalypse fury
Seared with spiteful flame
I'm a killing device
And you'll die if you think my name

I'm the hammer

I am the hammer
I'll bring it down
So vile
I am the jury
I blast
I am the hangman
I strike
The despicable

You'll taste my power
I'm the darkest creation
Respect the wicked
For my final destination

I will burn the castle down
Play the violin in your blood
As you scream and drown

I'll breathe fire through your lungs
All will die and know I am the one

I am the Kaiser
I bring forth the raze
Unqualified mutants
Kindling the blaze

Apocalypse fury
Seared with spiteful flame
I'm a killing device
And you'll die if you think my name

I'm the hammer
