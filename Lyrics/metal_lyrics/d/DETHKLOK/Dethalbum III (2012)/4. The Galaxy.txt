Darkness (darkness)
The end of days
Planets (planets)
Kinetic haze
Arrive (arrive)
The last dimension
Reject (reject)
the apprehension
No matter
We don't look back
The storm
Electric black
This war
Is formed in vengeance
The story (the story)
Has been predicted
We are the dark and the light
We have the power of time
We are the serpents intertwined
The galaxy will unite
Perfect liars
Promising us
Can't stop the beast
Got no other choice
Unforgiving soulless nature
Not gonna tame us gonna beat him
Not gonna stop reaping
The price is deth
We make the pact
we took our first breath
fearless
this is our quest
that leads me on
man the star-gates!
Star-gates!!!
GO!!!
We are the dark and the light
We have the power of time
We are the serpents intertwined
The galaxy will unite
