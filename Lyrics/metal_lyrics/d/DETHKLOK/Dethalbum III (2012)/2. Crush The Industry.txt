The drones keep moving
Push rocks up the mountain
The ice will slow you
You wither and fray

Protect your lifeblood
The power feeds you
A slight sink in the structure
And it all goes away

Crush the industry
No security
Capital is worthless now
Your life I inside trade

Modernize
Desensitize
Re-colonize
Downsize

Watch it fall
Before your eyes
The numbers drop
Your money dies

Emptiness
Where there once was
There's nothing

Borrowing
From Government
There's nothing

Commodities
The Dying Swine
The foul
Chemical waste

Harvesting
The rotting mouths
The molten gold is
Poisoned trash

Crush the industry
No security
Capital is worthless now
Your life I inside trade
