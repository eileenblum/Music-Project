Walking bleeding lurching seething
Dying from the dawn of time
Fester weakling cursed like a demon
To walk this earth alive
Chaste and cast out waiting to blast
Out a life lived patronized

Liberation blackened evasion
Scythe and medea punishment is near

Pistillate artifice
Ophidian sacrifice
Widow maker
Vindicator

Bring us the heads of the demon daughters
The vessels of sickness
A planets disease
The sirens they sing to us
A horrid fable

The snakes of Medusa
Will strange your soul
I see you I curse you to be my heart
I hate you I am you doomed to this Earth

Drowned in Andromeda's piss the
Serpent slain dies forever
Bleed on the floor like a bitch the
Bloody rift leaks deth
How can you still be alive?
How can you still be alive?

Pistillate artifice
Ophidian sacrifice
Widow maker
Vindicator

Uterine magistrate
Sinister aggregate
Contrive conclusion
Deth diffusion
Sycthe and Medea punishment is near
Hades beheaded nothing regretted

Drowned in Andromeda's piss the
Serpent slain dies forever
Bleed on the floor like a bitch the
Bloody rift leaks deth
How can you still be alive?
How can you still be alive?
