Mourning matron
The harpy's breast
The scowling raven
You'll die unblessed
Its patronizing
You are obsessed
The demon rising
The ghost possessed
Go hide
It's all you ever do
resign
The sickness is yours, too
Shameful murder
so pestilent
the crouching coward
malevolent
so disappointing
your legacy
The feeble leper
the entity
go hide
Its all you ever do
resign
The sickness is yours, too
pass your shame on
through the years
pay the toll
in bloody tears
it'll find you
it's gonna find you
keep the poisoned
hate-filled fear
spread the pain,
it's so severe
Its gonna take you
It's gonna take
Its gonna take you
Gonna Take you!!!
Comply
Anothers come to preach
defy but pay your final fees
pass your shame on
through the years
pay the toll
in bloody tears
it's gonna find you
it's gonna find you
keep the poisoned
hate-filled fear
spread the pain,
it's so severe
Its gonna take you
It's gonna take you
Suffocate
Make yourself a good check
The banks gonna blow
So you can't fucking take it
This is a war!
This is a war!
This is a war!
This is a war!
Its gonna take you!!!
Its gonna take you!!!
