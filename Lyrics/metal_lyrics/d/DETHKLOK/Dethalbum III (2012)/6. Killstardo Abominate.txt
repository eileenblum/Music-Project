Nightmare leave us
Banished from earth
Tortured monster

The beast is no longer amongst us
The beast is on his way to hell

Bastard villain
Mercenary
Soldier of pain
Banish abomination
We slaughter the whores
We use their poisoned blood to enchant him

Demon
Serpent
Leviathan
Take him

Blackened
Exorcist
Vortex
Be gone

We cast you down
We take your soul
We eat your flesh
We are our DETH

Banish abomination
Incantations will be sung
Give the gift of flesh
For your exit

Demonic wizard
Your price is pain
Take away this beast
In the moonlight

Fuck you
