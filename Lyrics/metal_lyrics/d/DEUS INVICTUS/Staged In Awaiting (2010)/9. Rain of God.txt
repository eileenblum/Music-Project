In a whirlwind of fire we descend upon the minions of hell
Swords drawn, eyes ablaze
Consuming the unworthy filth
Blood is spilled again from the open wound of Death
Your legion will fall before the kingdom of Light
Heaven purifies the world, once created in perfection
Angels purge the curse and deliver the earth from death's cold snare
Slaying the evil that scarred the earth with beautiful demise
Drowning all hell in its own entrails
The blood of the lamb washes away the distorted flesh, revealing the power of
holy righteousness
Fall to your knees, hear the voices of angels singing
"Our victory has arrived"
Infinite serenity, the Reign of God
For a thousand years, El Shaddai will reign with a mighty hand
All beings in existence will bow before the throne
All tongues will confess that He is Lord
Angels of Heaven purge the curse and deliver the earth from death's cold snare
Your legion has fallen before the Kingdom of Light
