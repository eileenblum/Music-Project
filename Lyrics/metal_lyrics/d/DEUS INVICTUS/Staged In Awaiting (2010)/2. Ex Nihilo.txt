"Our maker designs symbiosis, Ex Nihilo before our eyes" [Lucifer]

"This world is mine....I am your God" [God]

"I was endowed with beauty and power, charged with leading the Heavens.
Why is this man made in His image? Where is my admiration?" [Lucifer]

"I will ascend, and exalt my throne. I will sit on the mount of the congregation.
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the Most High." [Lucifer]

"Tear off their wings. Depart from me!" [God]

"This world is now mine, and your creation I will turn.
All will see my power, and trust in me as you.
Destruction, defiance, pain. You will see, I am their God." [Lucifer]
