Light and its trails beaming through your eyes
Through the alters of your life
Leave the screaming silence
Imagine a sunrise that never ends
A dawn of awakening
Not of the wicked one
But in the fullness of someone who died
Circumvent
Searching your heart to find out who you are
Navigate
Passing through the clouds towards the open sky
Of shadows, your soul was born
Inflicting damage upon yourself
Consecrating madness through your false gods of desperation
Awakening deception
Marriage with the liar
When will you end it?
And stop this desolation
Imagine a sunrise that never ends
A dawn of awakening
Not of the wicked
But in the fullness of someone who died
Separate myself from your blackened lies
And so I will live on once this body dies
Completing your spirit
Trust not in the mind
It has disgraced all of mankind
The heavens open, a gaping void
The end of spiritual darkness
Evil is destroyed
Imagine a sunrise that never ends
A dawn of awakening
Hold fast to light
Separate myself from your blackened lies
So I will live on once this body dies
