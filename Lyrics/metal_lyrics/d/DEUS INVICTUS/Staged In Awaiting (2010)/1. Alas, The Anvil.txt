Alas, the anvil rears its wondrous face
Attainment of a demigod complex
Sharpened swords
Defiler
Rolling thunder barreling onward towards self-affliction
Esoteric asphyxiation
Deifying the one who sows dead seed, leaving no stone unturned to do falsehood
Bleed, dreams
Alas, the anvil has come to put an end to your hypocrisy
This will be the end of your selfish disorientations
Beckoning to the skies, the silhouette has arrived
Look past the fields of those before who darkness fell
Leading the weak away from my God's lightened path
Struck on the heel, by the serpent, enclosed in black
But the cross conquered all and brought me to Paradise
