Flee the wrath to come
The Kingâs scepter is extended, and youâve turned away to death
You blatantly ignore the axiom and fill your life with debauchery
Evading the hands that began your life, now laying down to please your lust
The heavens stay silent for tonight, but itâs only calm before the storm
Consuming fire will bring the depravation, and bring the proud to their knees
Take these ropes from their necks
Save them from their suicide
Oh how far youâve fallen, to think that you can challenge the most High
Youâve been deceived by a deceiving mind
Were you there when he laid the foundations of the earth and gave life to its void?
Were you there when he made the mountains and the seas?
Can you command the dawn and call out the stars by name?
This world, created in perfection, will be engulfed by the flames of revival
Burning away the flesh that bared its teeth, and dug them into this earth
spawning the disease  He will demand an answer 
Why do you fight against God?
Repent to him while grace abounds
He takes no joy in punishing sins
Why do you fight against God?
He will make an end
No enemy rises twice.
