Heard a voice calling me through the valleys through the trees.
Who is the woman?
I set off for afar, gathered troops and warriors.
The three blind prophets warned me of this day.

I heard the mountains calling me.
I should rode my steed into eternity.
She makes me lose control.
I ignored the prophecies.
Her power over my mind with crystals of an ancient age.
She is the evil one.
She is queen of evil hearts and evil stones.
I raise my fist into the sky.

We climbed up into the sky to the temple enshroud by clouds.
That's when I saw her.
She shot lasers from her eyes as my troops burned and dropped like flies.
The prophecy was right her soul was mine.

I heard the mountains calling me.
I should rode my steed into eternity.
She makes me lose control.
I ignored the prophecies.
Her power over my mind with crystals of an ancient age.
She is the evil one.
She is queen of evil hearts and evil stones.
I raise my fist into the sky.

I have no control of my time or my armies.
Have I been defeated?

The time is near.
Your head will roll.
Without fear we'll destroy your soul.
