Eternally we dive into the flames of hell.
A demonic glaring eye through the flames of hell.
Our quest for fire to take back what you stole.
What yours is mine to use at our device.

Endlessly we ride into the flames of hell.
Black stallions of the night through the flames of hell.
Sliced open your throat, your precious soul will seep out.
Slaughter at sight is our never ceasing goal.

We are the children who are lurking in the night.
We are the saviors restoring evil in this world.
We're one and one for all to heed this demon realm.
Armies of angels will fall under our control.

Cast from the devils arms into the flames of hell.
To drag your people down through the flames of hell.
Seek and destroy.
Cities, towns, will crumble at the gates of torture.

We're one and one for all to heed this demon realm.
Armies of angels will fall under our control.
We're one and one for all to see the glory of our kingdom after its'
fall restored to its evil throne on high.

We come to raise the fire and ravage through your soul.
We come to raise the fire and take back what you stole.

Enter the demon realm. Hellfire.
