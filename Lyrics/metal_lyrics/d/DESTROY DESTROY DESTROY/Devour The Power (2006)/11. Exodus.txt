Gates bust open wide as the furies swarm in anger.
We're coming from the sky in a fire storm of dragons.
You know it all leads up to this.
You know it all.

Welcome tonight, welcome the the exodus.
People are melting into the abyss.
This is the night , the exodus, forlorn are all who hopelessly resist.

Ride.
Strike.
This is it.
War drums bellow in the distance, resonates the terror.
Bodies fused into a mangled pile.
Ride.
Strike.
You'll feel it.
Souls crushed under our chariots.
Cities burnt to the ground, 'tis proof that the end is now.

The ground breaks open wide the tongue of the flame will devour.
Masses prepare to die fleeing the in a herd of horror.
You know it all leads up to this.
You know it all.

Welcome tonight, welcome the the exodus.
People are melting into the abyss.
This is the night , the exodus, forlorn are all who hopelessly resist.

Mountains will scream and shake the earth to the very core.
The still air, vile.

Devour.
