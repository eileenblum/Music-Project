I have no mouth and I must scream.
Oceans, seas, full of controlling dreams.
Holy shit drop me in a puddle.
The ripples from my tiny body will capsize your evil vessel revealing
masks of manipulation, ripples of tidal waves.

Destroy

Buried, drowned, entombed and I can't claw out.
What I need to bleed for, you can sink your teeth in.
Like a wolf instead, I'll single you out the sick and the old.
I'll single out you.

We will fist fuck your skull.
