She looked around her
A village burned to the ground
Scorched bodies
She used to know their names
These motherfuckers can't get away
They took her son, her love, her face
She has found the spell
She has found the way

She summons you to battle
Revenge is her own struggle
She calls, she sings, she chants away

Soar like an eagle
Winged panther from the north
Wear the fur of the devil
Blowing through the shadowed sky
Your one eye of power
Beams wild blue fire
For your enemies last hour
You raging beast from hell

The last one alive
She asked me of her fate
Make her my whore, bludgeon
Or decapitate
I drag my blade across her fucking face
To wander these lands alone in shame
To speak the horrors of my name o know their names
These motherfuckers can't get away
They took her son, her love, her face
She has found the spell
She has found the way

She summons you to battle
Revenge is her own struggle
She calls, she sings, she chants away

Soar like an eagle
Winged panther from the north
Wear the fur of the devil
Blowing through the shadowed sky
Your one eye of power
Beams wild blue fire
For your enemies last hour
You raging beast from hell

The last one alive
She asked me of her fate
Make her my whore, bludgeon
Or decapitate
I drag my blade across her fucking face
To wander these lands alone in shame
To speak the horrors of my name

She summons you to battle
Revenge is her own struggle
She calls, she sings, she chants away

Soar like an eagle
Winged panther from the north
Wear the fur of the devil
Blowing through the shadowed sky
Your one eye of power
Beams wild blue fire
For your enemies last hour
You raging beast from hell

By the innocents who have passed
I will avenge my hero's death
With these ancient words
Oh come here beast of hell

All have failed to stop us
Men slaughtered and giants felled
This conjured beast will surely die

Soar like an eagle
Winged panther from the north
Wear the fur of the devil
Blowing through the shadowed sky
Your one eye of power
Beams wild blue fire
For your enemies last hour
You raging beast from hell

Winged panther from the north
Wear the fur of the devil
Blowing through the shadowed sky
Your one eye of power
Beams wild blue fire
For your enemies last hour
You raging beast from hell
