You'll hear us rolling from miles away
Did you think we would forget your face?
With a thunderclap
Smack straight in the add
Look at the clouds
We're coming back

Oh motherfucker we're touching down
This vicious shit will make the sound
Of earthquakes, jaw breaks
Pumping fury into the lakes
Mountains crumble when we're touching down
You'll feel the heat coming off the ground
We're touching down

They often die
When Uranus fucks the sky
And the sweat is pouring rain
Straight from the gods
Bolts of fucking power we are
We born are of...
We are born of thunder

You feel the charge running down your thighs
Feel the power glowing from my eyes
With a thunderclap
Smack straight in the ass
Scream for the stars
No turning back

Oh yeah baby I'll shoot you down
Grit your teeth when I start to pound
Overload strikes when I hit your skin
A white hot high voltage beam of sin
Death by strikes of turbo electric love
Oh yeah, we're touching down

They often die
When Uranus fucks the sky
And the sweat is pouring rain
Straight from the gods
Bolts of fucking power we are
We born are of...
We are born of thunder

They often die
When Uranus fucks the sky
And the sweat is pouring rain
Straight from the gofs
Bolts of fucking power we are
We born are of...
We are born of thunder
