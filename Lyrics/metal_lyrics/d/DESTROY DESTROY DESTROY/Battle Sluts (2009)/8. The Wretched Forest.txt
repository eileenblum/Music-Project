A band of mercenaries
Has tracked me to this perilous land
Trapped between hordes of vicious men
And the fabled woods that breathe
Certain death is to come
I must run to trees

The woods that breathe

I ran into the wretched forest
To see how the trees
Would devour a mortal and bestow
Their evil on me

The roots shot up from the ground
Strangling my adversaries
Like the veins of the earth
Spidering out to feed
My woodland brethren
Protect your seed

The woods that breathe

I ran into the wretched forest
To see how the trees
Would devour a mortal and bestow
Their evil on me
