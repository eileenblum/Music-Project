Behold, I seek the entrance to a kingdom
I paid my dues now open for me
I survived an age where the gods drowned
Man for their own selfish needs

When the water touched the sky the gods all laughed at their last surprise hysteria when the creatures of the deep ...released

Within the realm of ancient shadows we will finally meet kingdom of the dark, kingdom of the dead
We can hardly see the light caught between death and life
We can hardly see

Behold, I watched him as the water filled his lungs, life starting to seep
I looked him in the eyes as his massive arms gave, clenched between the teeth

Ripped in half before my eyes
this strangers life prevented my eyes
it delayed the beast...for me
