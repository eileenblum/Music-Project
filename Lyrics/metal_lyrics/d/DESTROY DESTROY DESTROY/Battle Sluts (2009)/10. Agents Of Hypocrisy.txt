I'll sink my teeth into any of your spells
The future opens an abyss of forgotten realms
I'll take my time while you waste your life
Enemies are the spirits of everlasting hope

You enter in the valley
To hide your shame
To find the fabled prophets
Dismembered on the plains
Your quest for valour haunts you in your golden dreams
The chariots drawn by hollow steeds

The last light you saw was the darkness in my words
The agents of hypocrisy preparing for their war
Banshees that yell
Harpies that tell
Battle cries of angels that only stories will

You enter in the valley
To hide your shame
To find the fabled prophets
Dismembered on the plains
Your quest for valour haunts you in your golden dreams
The chariots drawn by hollow steeds

The future opens an abyss of forgotten realms
The agents of hypocrisy preparing for their war
Preparing for war

You enter in the valley
To hide your shame
To find the fabled prophets
Dismembered on the plains
Your quest for valour haunts you in your golden dreams
The chariots drawn by hollow steeds

Your quest for valour haunts you
Your quest for glory taunts you
Your quest for valour haunts you in your golden dreams
