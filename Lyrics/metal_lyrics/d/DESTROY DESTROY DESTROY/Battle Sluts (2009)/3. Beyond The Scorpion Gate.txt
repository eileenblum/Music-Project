Beyond this land, afar, lies a secret to be unnamed, a power that will wreck this land, end peace, bring misery
We can't be harmed tonight

Sunlight bellows fear in the belly of the beast that sleeps beyond these walls just waiting to be released
We can't be harmed tonight

We'll climb the cursed hollow mountain beyond the scorpion gate
We'll find the wreckage of man piled upon the scales of hate

We'll climb the cursed hollow mountain beyond the scorpion gate
We'll slay this guardian for the power of the winds of plague

Blood runs down legs of my arachnid foes' torn limbs
If he bleeds I can kill him as long as I find his weakest link
We can't be harmed tonight

Pedipalps and a vicious mouth spread open for my head ripped of his bottom claw and stabbed him in the neck
We can't be harmed tonight
