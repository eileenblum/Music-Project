Winds gust across the plains
Battle cats and wolves remain
In their battle formations
We'll bring them hell

They pace back and forth
They blow the ancient
Horns of obliteration
A thousand blades unsheathed

Behold, the battle upon arctic plains
We traversed north for countless days

We fight with fire blades
Swing wild, let's slay
Tusked beasts that shake the ground
We'll slice them down

After defeating waves
Of their beast hordes
It beams across the sky
Their end is near

Behold... the lights of the northern realm

Behold, a battle in a frozen hell
We traversed north for countless days

Their bodies shatter in a burst of glory and shame
The story of their death in the sky will remain
