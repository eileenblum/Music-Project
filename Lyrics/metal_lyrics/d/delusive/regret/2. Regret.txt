"Alone I spend some time to try and figure out what's left of my life
The feelings for you is eating me so fast from inside"

As the moon escapes from the morning sky
I try to hide my feelings somehow
Afraid of setting everything inside of me free
Fear that you are loosing the grip of me
I fear you're loosing it all

All I ever wanted was to live by your side forever
But love dies and so do we so slow â forever

My soul is starving â the words are slashing through my memories
And ripping them asunder in eternities

All I ever wanted was to live by your side forever
But love dies and so do we so slow

My blood can't silence the screams inside of me
I have lost her for eternities
I will never forget this regret
...Will never forget this regret

"My soul is starving for the love I hade with you
Why did you betray me â why, tell me
And all those words â they are slashing through my head right now
And ripping my memories asunder â why, why did you do this to me
Tell me why â how could you, how could you"

This regret â this regret
The worlds are slashing through me
Ripping my memories asunder
Keeping them burning for eternities

All I ever wanted was to live by your side forever
But love dies and so do we together so slow â forever

All I ever wanted was to die by your side forever

"I have lost her for all eternities, and I will never forget this regret"

This regret
I will never forget this regret
