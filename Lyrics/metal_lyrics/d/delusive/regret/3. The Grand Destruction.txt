The hymn of the Fayth goes on
Singing the same praying song
Summoners are gathering around
What is the purpose with life
When Sin destroys it in front of your eyes

The world is under construction
After the Grand Destruction
After the Grand Destruction
After the Grand Destruction

From his frozen past
He awakes in a new world alone
It's freezing â a world so cold of death
A world so cold of death
So alone â in the world of doom

And with the toxin, it destroys â it destroys

A thousand years from home
He awakes in Spira all alone
Sin is still bringing death to our shores
The spiral of death goes
Travelling through time so long

The world is under construction
After the Grand Destruction
After the Grand Destruction
The Final Destruction
