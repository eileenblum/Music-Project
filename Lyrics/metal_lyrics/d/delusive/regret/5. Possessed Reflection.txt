As I look into the mirror after night
All I see is someone else
And as I try to fins the secrets of my past
It is all fading away
It is all fading away
Fading

Reflections on my former life
Is this the man I am?
Well, this isn't me
Oh, tell me who could it be?

Reflections on my past
Am I really the last?
Mirror on the wall â tell me
Oh, Possessed Reflection let me be
Mirror tell me, who am I?

Confusing photos and pictures from my former life
Well, all I see is someone else
But as I try to find some paths of my life
All I see is someone else
Someone else

Reflections of my former life
Is the man I am?
This isn't me
Oh, tell me God â who could it be?

Reflections on my past
Am I really the last?
Mirror on the wall â tell me
Oh, Possessed Reflection let me be
Mirror tell me, who am I?

The former myself no longer remain
Reflections encountering in from both sides
Never again for filled by one side
I'll let them be free â and let the fight
Let them fight

Reflections on my past
Am I really the last?
Mirror on the wall â tell me
Oh, Possessed Reflections this is who I am
Forever â Let me be
