Open your eyes and see me for who I am today
Yet I know that you don't care anyway
You slashed my life into pieces and dust
And you wore the only one I could trust
The only one I could trust

Let our agony begin
Side by side we'll struggle to the end
Side by side our blood will fall
An eternal war of abuse and pain
Eternal War, Eternal War

And now I want you to listen to what I have to say to you
No words shall escape your mouth
As I speak to you
This thing is personal

(Fuck you!)

Let our agony begin
Side by side we'll struggle to the end
Side by side our blood will fall
Eternal War, Eternal War
Eternal War
Between us both

Let our agony begin
Side by side we'll struggle to the end
Side by side our blood will fall
An Eternal War â Die

Fight for your life (Fuck You!) When the knife is at your throat
Finally, let me die!
