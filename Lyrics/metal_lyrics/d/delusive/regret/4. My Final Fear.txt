All I hear is the sound of razor slashing through my skin
My thoughts and desires â they have all disappeared
Alone when the blood flood among
In a lifetime I have suffered to long

Alone in a symphony so red â the song that only I can hear
And it was under this rain I took my life
And it was of all those cuts that made me die
But still I feel some blood in my veins
Reminding me of what remains

Reminding me of why I'm here â inside this sphere
Reminding me of why I'm here â inside my final fear
My final fear â My final fear
Inside of it

Choking blood as I try to scream
It only makes it wore
My shelter no longer remain
I am naked and alone in this rain

Alone in a symphony so red â the tune that only I can hear
And it was under this rain I took my life
And it was of all those cuts that made me die
But still I feel some blood in my veins
Reminding me of what remains

Reminding me of why I'm here â inside this sphere
Reminding me of why I'm here â inside my final fear
My final fear â My final fear
Inside of it

Death is among my prodigal soul
Slaying me just like my first son
Same demand, slaying my thoughts
The remain is nothing

Insision remains forever
The blood keeps falling down

My final fear â My final fear
Inside of it
