It's rising from the sea
The creature of apocalypse
Christianity shall fear
Because he has been reborn

Christianity shall fear
Because he has been reborn

The end of Evangelion
Cthulhu has risen
The end of Evangelion
Oblivion is here

Oblivion is here
Rise from your grave

See his twisted sons and daughters
Writing slowly in Satans mind
If you only could see the vision
As it dwelling as it dies
After killing every kind of living bean
His dead, sinking into the sea
Waiting for the next time to rule

The end of Evangelion
Cthulhu has risen
The end of Evangelion
Hatered lives on
Oblivion has come

Rise from your grave

Now he is dead
Sinking into the sea
Waiting for the next time
To rule and destroy
In search of oblivion
He rest down in tears
But when he returns
He'll rule you again

End of Evangleion
Oblivion lives on
End of Evangelion
Oblivion has come
