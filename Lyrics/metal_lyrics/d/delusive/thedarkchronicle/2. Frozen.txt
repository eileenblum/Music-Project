She is lost in the woods
The snow lays still
But she struggles on
Hunted down by her past
Don't live in doom
Just escape

She struggles on anyway

The night is about to come
My soul will be forever gone
Waiting for the end of my last day
And in the white snow I lay

And it feels so cold
And it feels so cold
It feels so cold
It feels so cold

Frozen
Frozen
Frozen into the Darkness

Alone in the dark
Alone she falls
Thinks about the night
Refuse to die
But it's still to late
To steel the faith
Now she feels the breath in her face

The night is almost here
Lost my love and lost my fear
No one may ever find me
And through the cold gates of hell I shall flee

It feels so cold
It feels so cold
It feels so cold
It feels so â so cold

Frozen
Frozen into the Darkness

They knew she would lose her force

The night lays still
They're coming for me
Slaying me for all of my sins
A fight so impossible to win

It feels so cold
It feels so cold
It feels so cold
It feels so cold

Frozen
Frozen into Darkness
Frozen and Lost
