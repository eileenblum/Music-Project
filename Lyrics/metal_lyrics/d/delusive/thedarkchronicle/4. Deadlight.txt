Take a step into the twilight zone
A place so dark and a place beyond
The red lights burning strong
And the progress of Armageddon is done

Keep falling into the light
Even deeper and you will find
Even deeper and you'll find
The deadlight

Under the dark surface of reality
Lays a chaotic force, and in a moment brutality
Once you're down there you can't reach up again

Keep falling into the light
Even deeper and you will find
Deeper down and you'll find
The deadlight

Even deeper and you'll find the light
The deadlight
Even deeper and you'll find the deadlight

Inside the screaming silence lays apocalypse light
Take away our sins and burn us alive
Down where the light is red and grim

Keep falling into the light even deeper
And you will find...
The deadlight

Keep falling into the light
Even deeper and you will find
The light â the deadlight

The deadlight burns in all of us
The deadlight
The deadlight
