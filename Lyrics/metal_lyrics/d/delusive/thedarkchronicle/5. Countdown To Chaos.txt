You pulled the trigger
For the very last time
This time it's real
And how sic do I feel
No â no way I feel the pain
No way â I feel no pain

The numbers are running
Its countdown to chaos
This deadline of time
Destroying my mind

Deadline of time
Reaping my mind

Apocalypse it came so soon
To carry away my doom
The countdown has begun
Still I got so much left undone

The countdown has begun
Still I got so much left undone
So much left undone

The numbers are running
Its countdown to chaos
This deadline of time
Destroying my mind

Deadline of time
Reaping my mind

Deadline of time
Reaping my mind

Countdown to death
Countdown to the end
Countdown for you
Countdown for me

The very last countdown
Countdown to Chaos
Countdown to Chaos

Countdown for you
Countdown for me
Countdown to death to have its revenge

The numbers are running
Its countdown to chaos
This deadline of time
Destroying my mind

Deadline of time
Reaping my entire mind

Countdown to Chaos
Countdown to Chaos
