From an unknown land we rise
To kill the new world for power
To search and destroy

We search and destroy
The time has come
The Dark Chronicle has begun

The time will stop
When we have reached the apocalyptic top
When we have reached the apocalyptic top

The time has come
The Dark Chronicle has begun

The time will stop
When we have reached the apocalyptic top
When we have reached the apocalyptic top

The time has come
The Dark Chronicle has begun

The time will stop
When we have reached the apocalyptic top
When we have reached the apocalyptic top

Search and destroy...
