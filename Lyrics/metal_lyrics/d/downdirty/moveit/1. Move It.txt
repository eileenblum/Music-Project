Oh the fate has found me
I will set you free

Why are you standing there?
You're motionless, emotionless
We have to throw this to the air
Without a single fucking care

It's time to kick it off
Scream 'til you hit the floor
I can not take this anymore

Baby! Baby!
Let me hear you fucking scream

One, two, three...

[Chorus:]
Oh the fate has found me
(Leave all of your shit behind cause it's time to rise up and lose your mind)
I will set you free
(You see, we won't go without a fight and we'll show them all that we own this night)

OOH! OOH!

I will set you free

Look at me now, I wanna tell you something
Better look at me now, I wanna tell you

There is no way that someone tells you what is right
You either live for nothing or hold your breath and fight
One chance to raise up and one goal to chase
So burst bright into the flames or just fade away

MOVE! Come on!

Pull me all the way
Gotta let me hear what you have to say
What you gonna do? What you gonna do baby?

Pull me all the way
Gotta gotta let me hear what you have to say
What you gonna do? WHAT YOU GONNA DO!?

What you gonna do?

[Chorus:]
Oh the fate has found me
(Leave all of your shit behind cause it's time to rise up and lose your mind)
I will set you free
(You see, we won't go without a fight and we'll show them all that we own this night)

OOH! OOH!

I will set you free

Oh the fate has found me
I will set you free

Baby! Baby!
Let me hear you fucking scream

Fuck it.
