Was it all worth it
Cause when you spoke
The devils words fell from your mouth
I pleaded
Please don't you make me suffer like this

Cause after everything that we've been through
I thought that I would mean something to you

I can't believe
This is happening
There's no going back
I gave you everything

The truth is I've given up
On trying to save this
I'm broken I've had enough
Of trying
Of trying to save this

Your broken smile
An arsenal behind your teeth
I feel anxiety arise in me
While you give up on everything
I need to know what it worth it to throw this away
You held my heart
In both your hands
And then you fucking broke me

I tried so hard to forget everything
Saying to me we're meant to be
Those lies you made me believe
I can't sleep at night
Because you're all that I see
I never thought you'd be the one
To turn your back on me

I can't believe
This is happening
There's no going back
I gave you everything

The truth is I've given up
On trying to save this
I'm broken I've had enough
Of trying
Of trying to save this

I never wanted this
I won't forgive I won't forget
I never needed this
I won't forgive I won't forget

I won't forget all the times that you told me
That nothing would tear us apart
No forgiveness
For the games that you played right from the start

The truth is I've given up
On trying to save this
I'm broken I've had enough
Of trying
Of trying to save this

I won't forgive
I won't forget
There's no forgiveness
