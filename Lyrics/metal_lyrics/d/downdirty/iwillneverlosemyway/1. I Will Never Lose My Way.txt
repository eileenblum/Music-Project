Yow!

[growl]

I will never lose my way
This is all set in stone
It's always been this way
And you can't change this fucking course

(I will never change my way) [3x]
I will never change

Tell you what you're not the first
And you'll never bring me doubt
I know what you are
If I listened to your damn words
I would have never got this far

No matter where I go from here (oh oh)
Cracks in the road ahead of me
What happened now, this future holds
I'm ready for the cut
'Cause I'm not hiding anymore (anymore)

Criticize me, blow me away
I will never lose my way
Listen in to the voice inside of me (hey hey)

Maybe you have lost your dreams
So you can only shed your tears
Don't give up and dive deep in to your fears

Hell yeah

I'll fight, all night
I'll die, rewind
I'll fight (I'll fight), all night (all night)
I'll die (I'll die)

I will never lose my way
This is all set in stone
And there's no fucking way
That I will ever change this course

Mother fucker!

Prove it, fake it
You will never make it
Take your time but hurry up
'Cause you will never break me
Chew and spit, or you can fucking swallow
I break the mother fucking way and all these bitches follow
Hey!

I'll break this fucking way, hey, hey, hey, hey!

No matter where i go from here
The cracks in the road ahead of me
(They'll never slow me down)

What happened now, this future holds
I'm ready for the cut
'Cause I'm not hiding anymore (anymore)

Criticize me, blow me away
I will never lose my way
Listen in to the voice inside of me (hey hey)

Maybe you have lost your dreams
So you can only shed your tears
Don't give up and dive deep in to your fears

Criticize me, blow me away
I will never lose my way (yeah yeah)
(Pa pa pa pow!)

Criticize me, blow me away
I will never lose my way (yeah yeah)

So come on!

Tell you what you're not the first
And you'll never bring me doubt
And if I listened to your damn words
I would have never got this far
