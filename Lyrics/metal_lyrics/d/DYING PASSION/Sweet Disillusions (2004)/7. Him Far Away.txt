Another finished chapter
- on one side the cry with laughter
Pale candles, without a sin
Pushed off the mole I keep on floating
But there're no rings on water
Nothing's on

[Chorus:]
I feel no more then grief in my soul
That time may heal

As week starts with Monday
So next chapters shall appear!
May not be infected with so much boredom
So next chapters shall appear!

[Chorus:]
I feel no more then grief in my soul
That time may heal
