A something in a summer's day,
As slow her flambeaux burn away,
Which solemnizes me.

A something in a summer's noon,
An azure depth, a wordless tune,
Transcending ecstasy.

And still within a summer's night
A something so transporting bright,
I clap my hands to see;

A something in a summer's dream
