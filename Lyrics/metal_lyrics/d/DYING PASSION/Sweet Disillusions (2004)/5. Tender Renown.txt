I hide myself within my flower,
That wearing on your breast,
You, unsuspecting, wear me too "
And angels know the rest.

I hide myself within my flower,
That, fading from your vase,
You, unsuspecting, feel for me
Almost a loneliness.

He touched me, so I live to know
That such a day, permitted so,
I groped upon his breast.
It's a boundless place to me,
And silence, as the awful sea
Puts minor streams to rest.

And now, I'm different from before,
As of I breathed superior air,
Or brushed a royal grown;
My feet, too, that had wandered so,
My gypsy face transfigured now
To tender renown.
