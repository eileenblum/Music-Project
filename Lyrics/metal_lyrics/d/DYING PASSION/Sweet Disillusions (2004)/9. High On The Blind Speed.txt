Step right up!
This is it!
Drive to the edge of awakening.
There was no way out.
I gave up everything.

When I open my eyes what I can see
Is the road unwinding into me
I see flashing shadows of trees vibrating
Above us stars illuminating

So fast we drive in the daytime
Like madmen throughout the ghostly night
Enjoying this dreamt-of presence
It's an unbelievable substance

[Chorus:]
Still we drive, no thought of sleep
Till we'll get to the end of our need

The sun is golden, the air keen blue
The clouds are close and huge and rise.

[Chorus:]
Still we drive, no thought of sleep
Till we'll get to the end of our need

Don't try to resist
Our future don't exist
Nothing can stop us!
