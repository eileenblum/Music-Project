Just few steps in front of me
And I WIll be there with you again
Your thoughts suggest to come along
That's a very moment
I've been looking for
For all my life

I've Always tried to copy you
I've walked devoted in your shadow
Stumbling in your footsteps
But you didn't spare me pain and played tricks on me

[Chorus:]
Despite of these I've been following you
And your noble grace

Now I'm wiser
I have learnt my ups and downs
Met entire nations
Bled them dry just what you called
"The Way to Me"
You told me it's the only way
To keep up with you and made me a fool

[Chorus:]
Despite of these I've been following you

[Chorus:]
Despite of these I've been following you
And your noble grace

And I'll be in your arms for this once
Embraced with your gracious love

Within my reach!
Just to touch!
I should try that way!
