I am a savage beast hidden in velvet
- Angel of dark
Bound up with windstorm
Captured in the dark alone
The Grave of the volumeless
You are coming straight to help me
Or signify my destruction
Nevermind!!!

Sooner or later -
Cherished by the hope
I scramble ahead
- No step back!

[Chorus:]
Despite the distance between us
Nursed by the power of seeing you again
It's like a roaring hurricane
Like lava breaking
- too much terrifying

And time passes
I must warn you
- I am the chaos itself
I am praying to God to see you again
I'm burning, yes I'm burning with desire!

[Chorus:]
Despite the distance between us
Nursed by the power of seeing you again
It's like a roaring hurricane
Like lava breaking
- too much terrifying
