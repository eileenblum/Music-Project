You have escaped from all of the darkness
And now it's up to you
Where your steps will lead
You have escaped from all of heart-breaking
So come along, don't be slow

I miss my mom.
When she woke me in the morning
And her touch brought me
A beautiful sunny day
I woke up to your shinning light
But just one turn back
Bite me with frost

[Chorus:]
I was near to your world
But then I was sailing off
On the waves of my tenacious search
I was alone, far away from home
Away from you.

Your beaten tracks seemed multiplied into my eyes
Set off my fortune
I pulled a cart filled with soil and stones
Just to find you

[Chorus:]
I was near to your world
But then I was sailing off
On the waves of my tenacious search
I was alone, far away from home
Away from you.

Have a smile!
I'm only dying.
I'm closer to you.
