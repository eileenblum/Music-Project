When we wake up in the morning baby
Hot kisses start the new day
Get up straight, we cannot wait
Rule over these whiles
Just you and me

It's our run away to nowhere
To comfort our hearts
It's our run away
Come caress me more and more

[Chorus:]
So we are both lost
We wanna be mad
We feel secure in the dimension we have
No one can steal that
One body, one soul

It's our run away to nowhere
To be closer to the nature
The city left behind
As we decided to leave

[Chorus:]
So we are both lost
We wanna be mad
We feel secure in the dimension we have
No one can steal that
One body, one soul
