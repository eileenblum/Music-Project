[Mystery theme]
More and more I'm getting mad
Look, what I'm doing!
I expect it's beyond my grasp
Do you want to fly with me today?

Dusk flow down to the pools
Out of a rose's grown up an obscure shade
Trees are making love with the skies
This made the grey smoke to slow down

And mystery from bird's-eye view
In the coldest embrace
The sonate's circling in the air
Rocking through the forest
My face sleeps cought in dreams
It flies away to another place
At this game they're also deads
Though dreams do not lose thier wings
It's a weight put on my mind
And makes fateful blows

[PAIN theme]
The flame burning in a cruel manner
Defined an uneasy story

[Devotion theme]
We will drift so deep
Till we crash the sea
And after while we will fly so high

We will drift so deep
Till we crash the sea
And after while we will hit the sky

We'll meet our old good friend
He cannot stand waiting
This's the first record in my files
Then it's easy to learn to fly

We'll meet our old good friend
He will show us the way
Come and give it try
Then it's easy to learn to fly

I know you come with me
No doubt about it
Now you're my a little lost soul
In the world of searchers
