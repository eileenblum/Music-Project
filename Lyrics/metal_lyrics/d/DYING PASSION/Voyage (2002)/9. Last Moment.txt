Doctor, if my body's here
Then my heart is roaming around eternity.
It's on the way to death, to bliss
But at this very moment
It's being hurt by severe betrayal.

When the thought of life is asleep
When everything in my body turns silent
My heart gets out and goes
On a tour of gloomy nights.

And then I've had nothing for lots of years.
Everything's given away.
So I want my poor body to have at least
A light memory of my heart.

I'm staring into darkness through closed lids
And although they have locked up my sight.
My memory is pulsating
With a star shine on the horizon.

And then I've had nothing for lots of years.
Everything's given away.
So I want my poor body to have at least
A light memory of my heart.

It's a life, not death
Which is cause me what you called
That strange feeling.
