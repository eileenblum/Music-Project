Only the sensitive can see the light,
The light is a remedy,
Your sense and faith
Are making your decisions,
You cannot express it.

In the time lapse,
You're in love with the life.
Music has a curative power,
A regular interval of dark,
Comes and goes.

Night of demons,
You know
You're sweltering, even in the night.
When you sleep,
The Earth breathes along with you.

It's a morning, the day is breaking.
Your hour of goodness is coming.
A cold sweat all over your body
It's hot as hell in the room.
You still remember those years.
They've gone a long time ago.

But it's all coming back to you
In your dreams,
And you have no choice.

Night of demons,
You know
You're sweltering, even in the night.
When you sleep,
The Earth breathes along with you.
