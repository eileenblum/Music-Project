If you want to find something,
Set out on a seeking trip!

Set fire to water
And spill the flames,
Drive the wind through the earth,
Sunbeams merge with ice and snow.
You may see coloured autumn leaves
Falling on early spring flowers.

Then you'll understand
Variety of the world
In its c h a o s.

If you want to find more,
Set out on a seeking trip.

You may experience the male and female
Energies, tension and relief,
You may bow to your masters
Or you might better pace with your head high.

Then you'll understand
The boundaries of this world
In its c h a o s.

You may close your eyes
And discover vast spaces.
You may feel how empty evil things are,
Every suffering's just vanity.
Unknown friend will whisper
To your ear saying his secret,
No fight against emptiness, you just can fill it.

Then you'll understand,
There's only one way,
One way, the way of light.
