A large drop of dew
Is falling down.
I'm going to break in half,
- Why? -
I'm not thinking.
But life is coming into my mind.
- I exist! -

To live up life
To live up all
To live up energy
To live with it all

The drop's striking the ground.
Why should I think?
Reflection on the drop
Why should I live?

- A pity. -
Life is coming into my mind.

A large drop of dew
Is falling down.
I'm going to break in half
But life is coming into my mind.
But I'm to die.

I know this is the end.
I'm squeezing my way alone
Up to my knees -
Through life -
Through death? -
A new life. -

- A pity. -
Life is coming into my mind.
