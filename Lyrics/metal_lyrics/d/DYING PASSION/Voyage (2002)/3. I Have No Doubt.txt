I can't get a rid of feeling
That I am going somewhere.
Now I know,
I've been walking a long time.

I can't help my feeling
But I sleep even in the daytime.
Now I know,
I've been dreaming a long time.

I get a strange feeling
When I talk with people around
That I say something,
Something I should understand.

- IF -

But it's all right, it will pass in time.
Now I have no doubt.
