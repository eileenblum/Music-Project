Late in the night
I'm full of words.
Eternal ones like time
Heavy ones like a head
Shining ones like a star.

Your words also came to me.
Your words kept in silence.
They're beautiful
And they're whole.
They've got me
And I've got them
They've got us all.

A window provided with bars,
A word outside.
Does it depend so much
On what comes across our way?
I'll try to break down the wall
