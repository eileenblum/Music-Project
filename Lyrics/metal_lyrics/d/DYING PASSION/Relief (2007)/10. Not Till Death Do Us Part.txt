Loving you my baby is as grateful
as breathing city smog.
Maybe I could love you
If you're far away for good.
But you're bloody here.
It is too close my dear.

The camouflaged emotions
Lead to pain and silent cries.
That's why I'm just trying to tell you
I hope not till death do us part.

It's exactly like that, you and I -
It's an unequal tie.
I've got wings and have to fly.
It's your bad luck.
This love is wrong.
Don't think of it for too long.
