If you only knew how sad I am, nobody can tell
Not like before. Now it's more intense.
After a long time I speak with God,
I know for sure, what I should ask.

If you only knew how sad and tired I am
with all these facts,
All is done halfway, empty promises
Oh my Lord what happens
When I won't find rhyme to your name?

Call Me Away
There's nothing here
That wins my soul to remain
I'm a stranger in the land of make-believe
Leading to your grace

If you only knew how sad I am
though the sun warms my face.
I am blind, 'cause I'd denied the treasure of my house
in fatal turning point.
How to chase away this feel of despair?
