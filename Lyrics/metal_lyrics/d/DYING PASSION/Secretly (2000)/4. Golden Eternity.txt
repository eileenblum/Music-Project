It's outside
Out of our word-reach.
It refuses steadfastly
To be described.

It runs away from us
And lead us in.

And there are words
In my pitying heart
To express it.

It's real, it's a big dream,
A joyous ecstasy of words
And ideas and flesh,
An ethereal flower unfolding
And folding back.

It has no beginning and no end
And at present it is infinitive.
Stare deep into the world
Before you as if it were a void.

I was awakened to show the way,
Chosen to die
In the degradation of life
Because I am Mortal
Golden Eternity.
