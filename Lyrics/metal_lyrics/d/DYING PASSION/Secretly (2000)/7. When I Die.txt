When I die...
What is gonna happen with me when I fall.
What feeling? Can I feel anything at all?

When I die...
You know'st'tis common all that live must die
Passing through nature to eternity.

There must be a place for my desolate soul
Out of body that wasted away and suffered from sorrow.
When I die...

Forever you will wipe away every tear from my eyes
And there'll be no more death nor sorrow nor crying.
Forever you are with me to the end of the age
And there'll be no more pain for the former things
Have passed away.

It turns my eyes into my very soul
And there I see the things I always wanted to know.
When I die...
