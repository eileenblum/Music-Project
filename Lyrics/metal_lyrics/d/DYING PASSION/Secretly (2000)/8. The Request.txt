Into the sea I want! Into the sea!

I want to merge with the sea,
With this stormy azure space!

Into the sea I want! Into the sea!

And ships float.
They flow to shoreless horizons.
Their white sails blow with sorrow.
Let my life be severed
Like a suddenly disappearing sail.

Should the death come,
Let her come.
Let me shine like the flesh of light
Above the stormy space!
Let me merge as a sail
With the blue horizons!

Into the sea I want! Into the sea!.
