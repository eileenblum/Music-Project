Still so still
The look beyond the wall.
Distant so distant
Outside I'm dead.

Inside the storm rages
From without I'm as frozen
With a black smile in the face
Disentangle circle of life.

Find the way to paradise
Make sense of universe
And differs in all the values.
Which way are we passing?

Our own poor bodies drag along
With all our might.
Will we find someday
Life of our dreams and loveliness...?
