All we've lost, the stars have eaten
All that dies begins again

Tears have shed, the earth is gained
Buried neath the sky
So strange, it cannot be explained

In this light, I see your spirit
Listen, maybe we can hear it
All we've lost, the stars have eaten
All that dies begins again

Innocent magic
Is stronger than evil
Innocent magic [x2]

Innocent magic
Is stronger than evil
Innocent magic [x2]

All we've lost, the stars have eaten
All that dies begins again

Tears have shed, the earth is gained
Buried neath the sky
So strange, it cannot be explained

In this light, I see your spirit
Listen, maybe we can hear it
All we've lost, the stars have eaten
All that dies begins again

Innocent magic
Is stronger than evil
Innocent magic [x2]

Innocent magic
Is stronger than evil
Innocent magic [x2]

Innocent magic
Is stronger than evil
Innocent magic [x2]

Innocent magic
Is stronger than evil
Innocent magic [x2]
