Dressed up in smoke
And yellow wolf skin
You spin and spin

Skeletal girl with eyes like the dream
I woke up in
All tails and fins

She held a red apple up
To my lips
Ghost of brother at my hip

Her taste, like blood
On my fingertips
Ghost of brother at my hip

Are you merely the spirit of these
Bones that shelter me
You spin and spin

She opened her legs
To show me
Show me mercy
Ghost of brother at my hip

She held a red apple
Up to my lips
Ghost of brother at my hip

Her taste, like blood
On my fingertips
Ghost of brother at my hip
