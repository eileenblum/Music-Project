A spirit climbs my spine to the grave
Following the railroad tracks down again
I needed space, with soul, maybe we can die there
Maybe we can stop, I'm already dead
Stop, I'm already dead

My my my mother, she said
Heaven's on one shoulder, 
But baby Hell is on the other
Tied neatly in a box beneath the bed,
It was the bones of my father

Oh baby we can, 
Stop, I'm already dead
Stop, I'm already dead

I am, already dead

Stop, I'm already dead
Stop, I'm already dead
Stop, I'm already dead
Stop, I'm already dead

I am already dead
