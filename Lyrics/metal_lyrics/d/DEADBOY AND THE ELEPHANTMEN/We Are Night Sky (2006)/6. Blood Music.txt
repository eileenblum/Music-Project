In the corner of the garden
All unitedly forever
All the doubted for the moment

It's the song that I'm thinking of
It was a song called blood
Yes it was

There was spiders on the floor worth
In the corner of the garden
All unitedly forever
All the doubted for the moment

All the doubted for the moment
All unitedly forever
All the doubted for the moment

It's the song that I'm thinking of
It was a song called blood
Yes it was

Blood [x7]
