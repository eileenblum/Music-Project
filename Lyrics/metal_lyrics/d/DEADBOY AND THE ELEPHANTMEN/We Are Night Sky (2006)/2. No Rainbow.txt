Baby,
I'm bleeding still
My bloods all run down the drain
My bloods all run down the drain

Baby,
It's raining now you're here
And falling,
But, I think it's blood

No rainbow
It's raining skulls
When the raining stops,
There will be no rainbow

Baby,
But, I'm bleeding still
You were an iron maiden
You were an iron maiden

Baby,
It's raining now you're here
And falling
But I think it's blood

No rainbow
It's raining skulls
When the raining stops,
There will be no rainbow

No rainbow
It's raining skulls
When the raining stops,
There will be no rainbow
