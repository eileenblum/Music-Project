I ain't got no tears wasted on you, dead man
There is no time for you to steal from the truth

I hope that they stick it in, break it off, dead man
I hope that they stick it in, break it off, dead man

[x3]
When they had me in a hole, my father lost control of his soul

I hope that they stick it in,
Break it off, dead man

[x4]
There is no time for you to steal from the truth

[x3]
I hope they stick it in,
Break it off, dead man

I have got no tears to waste on you, deadman
Oh dead man [x5]

Dead man [x10]
