Revelation for
Around your sunday dress

The soul out of a smoldering wretch
All brought to sleep, there's nothing there
All brought to sleep, there's nothing there

Twisting walkÂ [?]
They're all up and down the strip
The soul out of a smoldering wretch
All brought to sleep, there's nothing there

The witch is on fire
She can't regret the dayÂ [?] repenting of the stars and earth
