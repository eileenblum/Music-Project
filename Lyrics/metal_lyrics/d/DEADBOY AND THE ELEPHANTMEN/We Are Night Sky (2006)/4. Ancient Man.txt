Pale child that was left behind, haunts me endlessly
I can smell the churches burning, I can hear the fire's melody
And you're moving for me baby, so graciously

Feeling like an ancient man
I got Heaven, I Hell in my hand
I got Hell in my hand

This radiation spills from my heart
Darkness come, darkness come and
Darkness fall apart, darkness fall apart.

How sweet it was, her teeth against my throat
I'm a ghost gone mad, an angel in the dope smoke

Feeling like an ancient man
I got Heaven, I Hell in my hand
I got Hell in my hand

This radiation spills from my heart
Darkness come, darkness come and
Darkness fall apart, darkness fall apart.

I see my reflection in the mirror, 
Sister sky, wisper to her mother the Earth
Mother Earth

I envy the night, for its absence of light
I envy the night, for its absence of light
I envy the night, for its absence of light
I envy the night, for its absence of light
