Evil friend, evil friend [x2]

It never ends at the depth of things
Love will swing, burn everything I see

Evil friend
Evil friend, evil friend [x2]

There is starlight in your blood
It seems there are shadows of whereÂ ??

Evil friend
Evil friend, evil friend [x2]

You knew [?] again
Evil friend
Black-toothed that speaks no truth
Burn everything and sing along,
Evil friend
Evil friend, evil friend [x2]

We are night sky, we are god's eye,
At the end of a lullaby
On the shore of things yet to be cryed

We are, we are, night sky, night sky
We are, we are, god's eye, god's eye,
At the end of a lullaby
On the shore of things yet to be cryed

We are, we are, night sky, night sky
We are, we are, god's eye, god's eye,
At the end of a lullaby

[x3]
On the shore of things yet to be cryed
