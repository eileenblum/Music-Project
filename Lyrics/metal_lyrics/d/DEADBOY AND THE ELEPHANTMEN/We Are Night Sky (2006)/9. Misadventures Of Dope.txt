There was a rythm to the beat at the wedding that was brilliant
Can't you hear it?
There was terror in my heart of your silent
Don't feel it?

We were speaking clearly
Counting backwards in the darkness from infinity
Can't you hear me?

Laughing at the joke that no one spoke

Sit down and count them
It wasÂ [?] hungry for hope
It was the misadventures of dope

[?] dead bird making out with this fool 
[?] Yes she does
[?]

Given enough time all things are possible
They're astronomical
Can't you hear me?

It was Misadventures of dope
13 miles on aÂ [?]
[?]
It wasÂ [?] hungry for hope
It was the misadventures of dope

Misadventures of dope
Misadventures of dope
Misadventures of dope
