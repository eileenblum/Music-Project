scaring the Ghosts away wake me when i'm sane
on Mardi Gras day the cold of death
it may tear you from my breast
yet I know you are the smoke that is my breath
under the sky to live is to die
raven black the night and I
opel on the highway side
as we pass her a million times this night
don't seem like no sun exists that could eclipse this
scaring the Ghosts away wake me when I'm sane
again you are the smoke that is my breath
this bouquet of regret
under the sky to live is to die
radiation black the night and I
don't seem like no sun exists that could eclipse this
don't seem like no sun exists that could eclipse this
under the sky to live is to die
radiation black the night and I
don't seem like no sun exists that could eclipse this
don't seem like no sun exists that could eclipse this
don't seem like no sun exists that could ever eclipse this
don't seem like no sun exists that could eclipse this
waking up insane on Mardi Gras day
don't seem like no sun exists that could eclipse this
just wake me when I'm sane
