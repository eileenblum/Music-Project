sky above me
I got this sharp piece of science and I can't see the soft underbelly of the 
sky above me

sky above me
I got this sharp piece of science and I can't see the soft underbelly of the

small Gods in your peripheral vision a beast called truth has risen
small Gods in your peripheral vision mad love walks with them all
a beast called truth has risen and we're walking away with a shadow
falling like stars from the eyes of the night walking away with a shadow
falling like stars from the eyes of the night a beast called truth has risen
mad love walks with him small Gods in your peripheral vision
walking away with a shadow falling like stars from the eyes of the night
the eyes of the night the eyes of the night the eyes of the night the eyes 
of the night
