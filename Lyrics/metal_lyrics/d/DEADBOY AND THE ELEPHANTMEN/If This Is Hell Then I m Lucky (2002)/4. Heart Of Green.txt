I have seen that shadow in the meadow
and I have seen that same shadow on the bayou
moving slowly through your heart of green
along your velvet belly is the cool sky
you jump into the water but the fire's been tamed
bless this jungle floor where I sleep
and I dreamed that I lost your heart of green
the dragon sleeps with the owl and the centipede
and they dream of you and me
along your velvet belly lies the cool sky
you jump into the water but the fire's been tamed
ooh bless this jungle floor where I sleep
and I dreamed that we touched your heart of green
opening like wings over the horizon
I hear that strange melody that only you can speak to me
You got that heart of green
she said I know the spirit of your greener day
she said I know the spirit of your greener day
she said I've seen that shadow stretched across the meadow
and I've seen that same shadow on the bayou
moving slowly through your heart of green moving slowly through your heart 
of green moving slowly through your heart of green
moving slowly through your heart of green moving slowly through your heart 
of green moving slowly through your heart of green
