Yesterday is a corpse that you know
don't ya?
tomorrow knows this to be so
revelation at the peep show
sweatin vision like a mojo
a little rock n roll in stereo
everybody sang
deadboy and the elephantmen
deadboy and the elephantmen
I dreamed I kissed a screamin banshee
snow white and divine
among terrible strangers myself and a bottle of wine
these *walls(wolves)* know secret names
for the fire and the rain
falling slowly like the first time
everybody sang
deadboy and the elephantmen
deadboy and the elephantmen
awake and dance
awake the phantoms and invite them to dance
awake the phantoms and invite them to dance
