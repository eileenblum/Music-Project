rattlesnake shadow cast over the heart
forever I am there barefoot in the dark
they're beating that drum in the cemetery
my death lays awake there whistling dixie yeah
if this is hell well then I'm lucky yeah
my death's alive there just waiting for me uh-huh
my death's alive there just waiting for me
my death lays awake there whistling dixie
if this is hell then i'm lucky
rattlesnake shadow cast across the heart
forever we are there barefoot in the dark
they're beating that drum in the cemetery
my death lays awake there aaah whistling dixie yeah
if this is hell if this is hell then i'm lucky yeah
my death's alive there just waiting for me uh-huh
my death's alive there just waiting for me
my death lays awake there whistling dixie
if this is hell well then I'm lucky
barefoot in the dark
barefoot in the dark
barefoot in the dark
