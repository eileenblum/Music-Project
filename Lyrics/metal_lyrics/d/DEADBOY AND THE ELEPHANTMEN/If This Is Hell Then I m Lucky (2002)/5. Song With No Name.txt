floating on a casket down the Mississippi
throwing shadows cross the moountains of the moon
there I heard the daughters of december
singing a wicked tune into the graveyard
mouths of children blue in the arms of mother violence
into the graveyard mouths
swinging from a star
down the passage we never take
past that door we never open
lost in the locust storm
singing a wicked tune
into the graveyard mouths of children blue in the arms of mother violence
into the graveyard mouths
swinging from that star
that star
