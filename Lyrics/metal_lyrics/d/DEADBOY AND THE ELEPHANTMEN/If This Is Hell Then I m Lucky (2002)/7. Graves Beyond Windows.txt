down down the gray wall
to gaze upon the graves beyond the windows
mesmerizing, mesmerizing
that wound that star got to get up had to see where you are
that wound that star she keep her madness in that jar
that wound that star got to get up had to see where you are
that wound that star she keep her madness in that jar
a burning girl on the hood of a car
mysterious blood on my guitar
mesmerizing, mesmerizing
that wound that star got to get up had to see where you are
that wound that star she keep her madness in that jar
that wound that star got to get up had to see where you are
that wound that star she keep her madness in that jar
mesmerizing like a wound or a star
mesmerizing like a wound or a star
yes it was
yes it was
like a wound or a star
yes you are
yes you are
ooh yes you are
like a wound or a star
mesmerizing like a wound or a star
