we laugh like the dead would laugh
we laugh like the dead would laugh tonight
laughing like red death unmasked at midnight
we laugh like the dead would laugh
we laugh like the dead would laugh
though your soul has gone so far away from mine
your mouth opens slowly blowing smoke like time
laughing like the dead would laugh tonight
laughing like red death blood splashed by starlight
look up there's a monster in the moon tonight
you were born into a movie without sound but its alright
we laugh like the dead would laugh
we laugh like the dead would laugh
we laugh like the dead would laugh tonight
laughing like red death unmasked at midnight
we laugh like the dead would laugh tonight
we laugh like the dead would laugh tonight
tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
we laugh like the dead would laugh
we laugh like the dead would laugh
we laugh like the dead would laugh
we laugh like the dead would laugh
like the dead would laugh
