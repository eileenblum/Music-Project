dancing with a black dog
on papa satan's grand piano
all night long we danced the nuclear bomb
all the live long night
dreaming of the setting sun
praying for a plague of frogs dancing with that black dog
dreaming of the setting sun
angels mouth is where I sleep
against the bone of her spine i weep
the shade from 'neath that yonder window creep
all the live long night
a roman lion at the door
a pretty skull an angry whore
a roman lion at the door
and how the mouths they cry for more more more more more
all the live long night
dreaming of the setting sun
against my heart I hear it softly speak
this seven headed otherworldly dream
otherworldly dreamer
papa satan's grand piano papa satan's grand piano
dreaming of the sad inside
otherworldly dreamer
papa satan's grand piano papa satan's grand piano
otherworldly dreamer
