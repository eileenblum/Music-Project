I lay here silent
How do I tell her
How far away I feel
With every breath she tries to hold tighter
But far away is all I feel

You needed a hand and I tried to be that hand
But life is yours to hold
Strap down tight it's going to be a long ride
It's time you ride alone

Then she said I found  god
But I'm not the god you see
Don't leave me like this
Alone, she said
I died to be with you
I took my own life with my own hands
Listen to me
'Cause I can't save you
Listen to me - listen
I've got to save myself

Then she said I found  god
But I'm not the god you see
Put your nails in me
She said she's never felt alive

Then she said I found  god
But I'm not the god you see
And could never be
No, I can't save you
Put your nails in me
