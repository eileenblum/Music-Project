I feel ugly, I'm so tired
Trying to make it all make sense
I ask you to hold me
Hold me like never before
I might break
I don't know how much more I can take
I ask you
It's getting to me again
I know you've never seen me like this
It's getting to me again
You don't want to see me like this
I'm spitting up life again
I'm feeling it all again
Choking
I don't want you to see me like this
Lay your hands on me
Your skin is warm
You could heal me - heal me
Just show me there's more
I know you've never seen me like this
I never wanted you to see me like this
Choking
I don't want you to see me lie this
I don't want you to see me lie this
I don't want you to see me lie this
I never wanted any of this
