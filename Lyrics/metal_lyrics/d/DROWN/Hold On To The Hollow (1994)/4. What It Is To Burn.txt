This time you couldn't walk away from me
This time there was nowhere you could hide
This time I wanted all the answers
This time I really thought I was prepared

But now I know
I know I wasn't ready
And now I know
I know what it is to burn
I know what it is to burn

This time you couldn't turn your back on me
This time you had to leave me paralyzed
This time I thought it's what I wanted
This time I know that I was wrong
'Cause I know about it this time
I thought I wasn't human
This time I really thought I wouldn't feel
I wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't feel
I wish I could forget
But this time it's for real
Some things you just don't want to hear
Not this time

But now I know
I know I wasn't ready
And now I know
I know what it is to burn

I wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't feel
I wish I could forget
But this time it's for real

I wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't feel
I wish I could forget
But this time I know what it is to burn
