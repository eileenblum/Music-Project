I was awake
Alone - afraid - confused
The only love I knew
The only love I knew
You were the only love I knew
And I was afraid

Scars don't heal
When they grow on the inside
The mind can't kill
What it sees on the outside
Too young to know
Too young to understand
Force fed the real thing
I didn't know what it meant back then

And now you wonder what went wrong?
How can you wonder what went wrong?

Love wasn't explained
Try spending that much time alone
I know this pain
Over time it only grows
Didn't want to believe
Tried not to let it show
Everything inside me
You took more than you'll ever know

And now you wonder what went wrong?
How can you wonder?
You were wrong

Pieces of man
I'm learning the hard way what I am
Pieces of man
Destroyed - destroyed

Fistful of control
You planted this seed inside
Too many times
Too many times
This time you can't deny
You were wrong

Pieces of man
I'm learning the hard way what I am
Pieces of man
Destroyed - destroyed

I was afraid - I was alone - confused
I was afraid - I was afraid
You were the only love I knew
And I was afraid - afraid

Pieces of man
I'm learning the hard way what I am
Pieces of me
Destroyed - destroyed

You were wrong
