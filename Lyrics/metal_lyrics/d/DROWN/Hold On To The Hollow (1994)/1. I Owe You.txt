Wasting time on my own thoughts
Pulling me in so deep
Thoughts of you in our little world
It makes me cold
It makes me weak

I self destructed
I reconstructed
I owe this all to you
For a while you let me forget myself
But once again
The real me is alive

I put myself here
Look what it's done to me
I'll keep myself here
Now watch me bleed

I wanted to believe in you
I tried to believe in the lie
It was a lie
Now you see what it did to me
It was a lie

I'm self reliant
I'm self confidement
I owe this all to you
You showed me that I'm the only one I know
So once again
The real me is alive

I put myself here
Look what it's done to me
I'll keep myself here
Now watch me bleed

I was taken apart by what I never knew
I was taken apart
The ugly part of you
The ugly part of you

Spend time with the broken man
I owe this all to you

I was taken apart by what I never knew
I was taken apart
The ugly part of you
You
