I feel so different now
It all feels so different now

I had you in my life once
I had that feeling of the real thing once
But now you're gone
And that's all gone
Inside, I held on to you once
I never knew there was two of us once
But now I'm alone
And it's all gone

I gave my body and my mind to you once
I thought it all revolved around you once
I know better now
But I'm too far gone
I would have died for you once
And I thought it would have mattered to you once
But now you're gone, and I'm so far gone
And I'm wrapping my arms around myself
I'm free
I hold onto all that I am
But I know that the one I hold onto is dying

I feel so different now
It all feels so different now
