Something is following me
Something has its eyes on me
Someone paid off all my friends
And thinks I don't know

But it doesn't mean a thing to me
I know they're watching me
And your opinion, your judgment
Your words of disbelief
Don't mean a thing

I know it's hard to believe
But they find me in my sleep
And their voices hurt my head
If I try to slow down
So I can't slow down

But it doesn't mean a thing to me
I know they're watching me
And your opinion, your judgment
Your words of disbelief
Don't mean a thing

Keep your voice down

But it doesn't mean a thing to me
I know they're watching me
And your opinion, your judgment
Your words of disbelief
Don't mean a thing
