For seven years I thought you were down
Now the spineless one is all I know
You were a friend of mine

Two-faced
You are

Both faces hide your fear
And both faces you hide behind
I, I wish I didn't see this
You were a friend of mine

Two-faced you are

You were from the old days
I thought I knew you well
But the hard times hit and I learned
About the other face you'd sell

So come confront me
Come confront me
It's the only face you get

Fuck you two-faced

Two-faced you

I thought you were my friend
But you remind me of my father
