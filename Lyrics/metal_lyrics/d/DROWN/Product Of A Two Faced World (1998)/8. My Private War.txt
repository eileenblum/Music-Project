And you get so tired
So tired
Could you help me...please?

I am on point
They call me the pointman
I wait in the silence
I wait for you
Inside the blood runs faster
My heart knows what's next
Refine
Define
I've been abused by my own

Lock load
I am ready to go
I'm wound too tight it's ending
Lock load
I am ready to go
I'm wound too tight

Fearless and solid
I wait
Frozen from sights unwanted
You have turned me into this
Now I turn this on you
Paranoid
I know it's senseless
Beaten into this
And all I have left is a will
A will to burn down my own

Lock load
I am ready to go
I'm wound too tight it's ending
Lock load
I am ready to go
I'm wound too tight

The years go by

Lock load
I am ready to go
I'm wound too tight
