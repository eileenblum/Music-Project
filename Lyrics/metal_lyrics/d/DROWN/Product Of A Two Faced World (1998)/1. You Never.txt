Tried to tell you there was something wrong
But you never listened anyway

All of this is such a waste
The tears have tore lines into my face
Hours spent to find some common ground
Well who is hurting now?
Who is hurting now?
I've tried to tell you for so long
Selfish eyes would not see

This life is killing me
It's killing me

Believed the promise in your words
So I was expected to ignore this hurt
Now I feel her skin and hear her sounds
So who is hurting now?
Who is hurting now?
I've tried to tell you for so long
Selfish eyes would not see

This life is killing me
It's killing me

Tried to tell you there was something wrong
But you never listened anyway

I tried to tell you for so long
I've tried to tell you for too long
Tried to tell you there was something wrong
Tried to tell you something's wrong

I tried to tell you
You never listened
