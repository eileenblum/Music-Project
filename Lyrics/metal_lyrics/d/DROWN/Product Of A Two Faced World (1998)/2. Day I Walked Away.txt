I grew up insecure
Afraid of everything
Just wanted to feel something

No confidence
I had no one who believed
That I was anything
Left to find my own

Through the years I've found
A safety in a world
That some my call "destructive"

Bring on the insanity
It feeds this part of me
It helps the parts I'm missing
Forgive what I've done

You weren't around
On the day I walked away
All I needed was a helping hand
And I saw myself walking away from me

So long, so numb inside
I've found no place to hide
&gt;From a past that sometimes haunts me
But all this pain I've learned
And through the years I've burned
To try to kill what they put inside of me
What have I become?

You weren't around
On the day I walked away
All I needed was a helping hand
And I saw myself walking away from me

You weren't around
On the day I walked away
All I needed was a helping hand
And I saw myself
I saw myself

And no, I can't apologize
For the stupid things I've done
You're looking at a product of a two faced world
And this is what I've become

I need something real
I want something pure
Something pure

You weren't around
On the day I walked away
All I needed was a helping hand
And I lost myself
