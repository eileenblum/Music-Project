I need this
I breed this
I know these wrong ways are mine
I live this
I give this
A slave to a life unkind

Need is the root of my evil
So I will follow it where it leads
A voice that says "just forget her"
And drags me out here on these streets

I blame this need
I am this need
I need this need again

I'm hurting
I'm burning
I need to find a release
I'm watching
I'm waiting
Please give me one more piece

A fiend for the sickness I'm driven
The eyes of my needs stay fixed
Hungry I'm an addict just waiting
I'm waiting to get more of this

I blame this need
I am this need
I need this need again

And I want no more room to breathe
I'll let this night just use me
I want no more room to breathe
It's wrong but I'm free

I blame this need
I am this need
I need this need
Again
