This is for my suffering

No more days putting faith where it doesn't belong
I've been held down here for too goddamn long
Seen you all come and go and I've been led on
But I am still alive and I proved you wrong

Because I am the one
Who feels like a fool
I am the one
Who wasted my trust on you

Endurance
This is my test of time
Persistent
Something's keeping me alive
This is for my suffering

And I accept no more words fro the ones who kill my time
Don't want your excuse to ease my mind
There's nothing inside me that's like your kind
True to my words in this world that I define

I am the one
Who stands here feeling used
I am the one
Who wasted my life on you

Endurance
This is my test of time
Persistent
Something's keeping me alive
This is for my suffering

You will never take me alive

This is for my suffering
