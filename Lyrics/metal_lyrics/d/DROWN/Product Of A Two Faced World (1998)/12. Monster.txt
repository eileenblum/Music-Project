I never wanted to hurt you
I don't like what I am

Father, I blame you
She lies bruised and bleeding on the floor
A victim of what's inside of me
A casualty in this war
Well your fist taught me nothing
Your cold eyes proved you didn't care
You were dangerous, drunk and defeated
And I was scared

She called me a monster

Taking your frustration out on me
Mother I blame you for what you've done
I forgive that you couldn't hit the right one
So you just passed it on
Well your fist taught me nothing
Your blank eyes proved you didn't care
You were paranoid, in pain and polluted
And unaware

That you created a monster
You created a monster
I hate what I am

Take a look at your monster
I hate what I am
