Laying here alone
I am exhausted and nothing here is right
I'm lost here in silence
I'm empty and tired of this life
I am tired of this life

I am tired of the crawling
Tired of the endless lies

I woke up with this pain again
Not knowing why or what I am again
Reached out for another empty hand
And I'm tired of this
Tired of living like this

I'm bored of the cheapness
The weakness I see in their eyes
But I'm unsure if it's them or me
That I have grown to despise
And I do despise

I am tired of the crawling
Tired of the endless lies

I woke up with this pain again
Not knowing why or what I am again
Reached out for another empty hand
And I'm tired of this
Tired of living like this

Tired of living like this
Tired of Living

And days like this I may be the weaker man
I could put a bullet in my head
But I'd be no better than them
You see, I wasn't meant to make it
But I learned to take it
I wasn't meant to make it
But I've learned to take it
Bring it on

Well I woke up with this pain again
Not knowing why or what I am again
Reached out for another empty hand
And I'm tired of this
Tired of living like this

Tired of living like this
I'm tired of living
