You hold what you have to hold on to

The bluest eyes are the saddest eyes
I know this all too well
The blankest stare
The I don't care
A crawl inside type of hell
All of this reminds me
Of how much I really don't fit
I come to you black and blue
And you won't deal with it

So I'm left holding the dirtiest hand
I am told that it's getting old
Just how dirty I am
How dirty I am

A soulless whore, an even score
The eyes in the back of my head
My lack of class, this empty glass
A drink here with the dead
All of this reminds me of how much I really don't fit
I'm begging you please make me new or keep me out of it

Now I'm left holding the dirtiest hand
I am told that it's getting old
Just how dirty I am

I'm left holding the dirtiest hand
I am told that it's getting old
Just how dirty I am

Wash me clean
So, wash me clean

Now I'm left holding the dirtiest hand
I am told and it's getting old
Just how dirty I am

I'm left holding the dirtiest hand
I am told and it's getting old
Just how dirty I am

How dirty I am
