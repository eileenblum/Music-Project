This is a dark world
This is a cheap sick world
This one is tattered and torn
So why was I born into this world?
Infected dirty world
This poor desperate world
Wasn't black and blue to her
What did I do to her?
Welcome to my world

Where I have nothing
I have no one
I am only alone
I am alone

You are a beautiful safe girl
Wish you could heal this place, girl
You are untouchable
But I'm unlovable
Welcome to my world

Where I have nothing
I have no one
I am only alone
I am alone

I wish there was a safer place
For me

I have nothing
I have no one
I am only alone

I am alone
