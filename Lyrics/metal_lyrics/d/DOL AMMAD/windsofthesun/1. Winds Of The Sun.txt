A magic dream
A new beginning
Sea and space in unity
Side by side
The new horizon
I hear angels call my name

Come with us

The key of time
The greater galaxies
Shapes and patterns all around
A sea of stars
A liquid universe
I hear angels call my name

Come with us
The winds of the sun
Fly with us
The winds of the sun

Andromeda and Poseidon
Gave their life to fantasy
Dolphins swim into Orion
Leo joins them in the sea
Virgo Hydra are now aligned
Endless quest cosmic design
