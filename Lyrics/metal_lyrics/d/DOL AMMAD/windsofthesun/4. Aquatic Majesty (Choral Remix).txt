Hear now this tale of mystery
The slumber of our majesty
He was the ruler of the sea
But vanished in black abyss

Fallen star in sea's embrace
I've seen your fear
I'll fire your hope

No one to navigate our souls
No one to liquify blue storms
But all the creatures held their hope
Hear how this ancient tale unfolds

Fallen star out of this world
Return your dream
I'll fire your hope
Turn your face to sea
Rise from misery

Try to believe oh my king
Aquatic Majesty
Never, never leave us
Must return from darkness

Rise magic kingdom
Rise all my kingdom
RISE
