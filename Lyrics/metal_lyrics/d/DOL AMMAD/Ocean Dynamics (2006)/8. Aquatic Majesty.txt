Hear now this tale of mystery
The slumber of our majesty
He was the ruler of the seas
But vanished in black abyss

Fallen star in sea's embrace
I've seen your fear
I'll fire your hope

No one to navigate our souls
No one to liquefy blue storms
But all the creatures held their hope
Hear how this ancient tale unfolds

Fallen star out of this world
Return your dream
I'll fire your hope

Turn your face to see
Rise from misery

Try to believe oh my king
Aquatic Majesty
Must return from darkness

Never leave us

The king of hope
Where is his might?
Will he return and melt this night?

A liquid mask, the fiery eyes
A fallen star to guide them wise

My child
Daughter and son of the light
Infinite power a lesson of time
I will ascend from the void
I will ascend, hear my voice

Rise magic kingdom
Rise all my kingdom
