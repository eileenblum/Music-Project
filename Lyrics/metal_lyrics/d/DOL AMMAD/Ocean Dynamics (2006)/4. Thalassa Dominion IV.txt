We must summon all the forces
Intervention now is needed
See the menace growing stronger
Sea and space an oath forgotten

Plague
That the precursors once spread
Now return to
Use their knowledge
Through their greed
They once abandoned
Now they come to save the ocean

This is where the moment comes
So now release the Kruug
And set us free

Dominion, Dominion
Stars and the sea
Union forever defending the peace

Dominion, Dominion
Balance restored
The ocean breathes life
Like never before

Dominion, Dominion
Kingdom of love
Fortress of freedom
A new Thalassa
