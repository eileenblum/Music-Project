Anger transforms liquid pyre
Spitting out ashes and flames

All melting stream scorch the earth
Here's the rival of the sea

All melting... The rival...

So much lost, so much power
Terra's reign, now the fire commands
So much lost, none will survive
So much lost, life gets new form

Behold
Oh the lava, feel the lava
