Once upon a universe
A distant cry of help
Echoes in the lighthouse of life
An unprecedented disturbance
In the cosmos' oceans

Intervention is needed

Emerging into the light of the sun
Is a message requesting deliverance
from the deepest evil

Illuminate us, for your ancient paths
Were misled

The deviation was repeated

And so it begins...
