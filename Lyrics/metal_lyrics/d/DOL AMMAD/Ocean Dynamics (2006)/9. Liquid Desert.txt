These stormy seas calling me
These stormy seas
Now my hall of fame

Domain of blue
That shipwrecks adorn

A past world of the dry land
Now lies forlorn, the dry land

Liquid desert calling me
To the bottom of the sea
Leave your world and you will see
A new life of blue and peace

Liquid desert calling me
To the bottom of the sea
I don't know what I should do
And I cry

Dry land, Dry land
Come with us

These stormy seas calling me
These stormy seas
Now my hall of fame

Domain of blue
Calling my name
