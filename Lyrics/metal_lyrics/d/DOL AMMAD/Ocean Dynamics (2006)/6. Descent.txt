Is this the way it should be?
I see my mother's hand
A scream...
I must remove this memory

A voice, a heartbeat
Eyes closed
Finally I understand

I let the icy water burn my eyes
I accept the water's raw caress
And I drift into a new existence

We have been expecting you
Traveller of the deep
This voyage has ended
A new one lies ahead

Rest now, don't despair
The ocean protects you
