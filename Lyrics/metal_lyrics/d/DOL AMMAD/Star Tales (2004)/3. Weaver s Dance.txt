Start the dance!

First the eyes, dark eyes
That few can see, now
Seal the gates, it's time
To start the dance-oh

Then the flames, blue flames
That few can feel, now
Seal the gates, it's time
To start the dance-oh

Wait, here they come now
Watch as they rise now
Running out, running out
Time is running out

How they lived and mainly
How they diedâ¦They are judged
How they died and
How they'll live again

Who's the master now?
Who's the master weaver?

All the stars and all the planets
Now they bow to
Their new master
The Weaver's Dance
