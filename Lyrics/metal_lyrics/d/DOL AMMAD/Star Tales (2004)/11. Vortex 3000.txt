Breathing the fear
Only oceans can experience
Drown in the rain
Only mountains have suffered

Who denied to be wise?

Weaving the texture of karma
Your karma and
Harvest your internal soil
Your internal soil

Here the universe ends
Use your soul energy
Glorious skies await
The end of this journey
Victorious visitor
To the essence of life

Gloria!
