Freedom my master of all
Father I'm coming home
Freedom my master of all
Now, I'm back to the zone

Time seems like yesterday
When your soul embraced
My lone destiny

I've reached the starless edge
A dark world of fear
And eternal pain

Freedom my master of all
Father I'm coming home
Freedom my master of all
Now, I'm back to the zone

I've reached the starless edge
A dark world of fear
And eternal pain

Gloria eternal!

Lords of light gather!
