Like a God it appears
Nectar flows
Calls them in
Stargate Pyramid 

They all drink
They fall in ecstasy 
They do not know the gate 
Will bring them misery (The music)

They all dance
They sing in harmony
But now their leader hides
It is a mystery (The nectar)

Torture, Assasinate - Itâs a trap
Stargate of massacre - Itâs a trap
