I once thought that I would know the time just to give it up
You hold more than you think you do
but you're letting go the best thing you have
But you don't hold on
and breaking hold doesn't last
If all the times we let it drop we didn't die just a little bit
The things we love the most
But you break once it settles down
You hurt and you hate the thought of never again
You said you wouldn't break
But you hold onto the light that's left
It rains down
but you take the chance or you just regret that you gave it up
So you just hold on
And I won't be able to let this die
I can't just forgot this moment in my life
And I won't be made to lose the light
I don't want to forget
to live with regret
Lost
you couldn't change how the morals fail
you couldn't change how we fall
I hate to be the one to watch if we fade away.
