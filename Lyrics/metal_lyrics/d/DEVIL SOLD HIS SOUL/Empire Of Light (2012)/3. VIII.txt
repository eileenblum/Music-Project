I can't be open if you are in the way
Another chance has passed us by
If you can't take on the role
how can you expect us to move? Your mistakes are too great to count
But I won't fall for any of your vows
you're falling apart
and I won't break for any of your tears
you're falling apart
I won't be able to scream louder
If I could I'd be able to say
You're not capable of progress
You cannot illuminate the path
Mistakes surrounding you
mistakes engulfing us
We cannot make this alone
Pull out defences and let it in
The water's crashing down
But I won't fall for any of your vows
you're falling apart
and I won't break for any of your tears
you're falling apart
I won't be able to scream louder
If I could I'd be able to say
You're not capable of progress
You cannot illuminate the path
Thread bare
things won't move
Will you even care? This bad dispute
You can only fall down.
