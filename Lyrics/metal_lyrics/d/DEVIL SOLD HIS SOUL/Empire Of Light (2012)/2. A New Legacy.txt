I will take this moment with me to the end
to the withered light
and I won't break like you hoped I would
A lost cause to want out
Fractured breathing won't last
Always hoping for the best
Your intentions were never as good as our dream
I want everyone to know just how hard this is to keep on through the rain
and I won't be reminded of the blackest nights and bleakest days I know
Fractured breathing won't last
Always hoping for the best
Your intentions were never as good as our dream
The darkest nights don't break our cause
The pride we hold to lose will not fall
The darkest nights don't change our hearts
Are we holding our breath? We're not breaking our hold
Withered heart to break through the dark
Give me strength to fight back
to carry on.
