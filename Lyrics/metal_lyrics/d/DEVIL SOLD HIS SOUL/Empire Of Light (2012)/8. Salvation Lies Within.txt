A barren lining in the darkness
A weakness in our lives
The shade of dusk can make us feel alone
Hopeless shaking in the dark clouds
You open up my eyes
You hold me up to understand
You say hold on /hold on
Your open arms will shield the winter
You open up my eyes
Without despair we hold the path
You say hold on
hold on
But I can hardly see the vacant expression in their eyes
I'm not losing all the things that ever mattered to me
Hopeful moving through the cold light
You've opened my eyes
The mist will be clearing and the light will shine through.
