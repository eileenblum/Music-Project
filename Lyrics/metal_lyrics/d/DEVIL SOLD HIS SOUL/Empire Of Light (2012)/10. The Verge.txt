I won't feel the rain
the falling sorrow that guides our lives
Hope will only take you so far
through the darkness and into the light
Our intentions eroding
but what is the point of all this caring
If all the roads are broken
if all the paths lead to one place
The problem isn t what we could have done
but what we do now
Paths - restraining me
Hope - forever
Light - show me the way.
