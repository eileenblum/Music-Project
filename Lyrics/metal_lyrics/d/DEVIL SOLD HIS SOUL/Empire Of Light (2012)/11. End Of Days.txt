The broken rules to wipe this from us
You're taking our souls
You're killing our dreams
You're telling me how hard it's for you
You haven't a clue
We did this all ourselves
The morning sun brings nothing but cold
An empty gesture to a hopeless man
Try living our lives
What could you know of progress? You barely even think
Our dreams are a shattered curse
What's changed now? You'll take it from me
you'll pull me down
A hand held out
You'll never leave us alone
So what's changed now? You never listen
you never try
You sink your joys
You're making my prospect so bleak
The loneliest sun
The loneliest day
The loneliest life
The loneliest life
All I see is an open grave with our names on the stone
You're moving the dirt
you're burying the hopeful
What | changed now? You'll take it from me
you'll pull me down
A hand held out
You'll never leave us alone
So what's changed now? You never listen
you never try
You sink your joys
You're making my prospect so bleak
I will never escape from your grasp
You're leaving us to the sharks
You're sitting in silence to watch us fall
A moment of promise lost for good
You're sitting in silence to watch us fall
We're all going to sink
The end of days approach faster than we would have hoped
You're arms are folded
a last reminder
Living in a ghost town
what can I do? A mocking blow to floor us
we won't forget
The problem is you
Rain pours down
what can I do? I'm not giving up
I'm not breaking our promise
I'm not alone
The rain pours down
but what can I do? I'm not giving up
I'm not falling apart
I'm not letting go
The rain pours down
but what can I do? I'm not giving up
I'm not letting this hurt me
I won't run
The rain pours down
but what can I do? We will never resent this
Even if we were to fail this was all worth every second /Light shines down
in every moment
Even when we're knocked down
the journey is not a lost cause
Light shines down in every moment
Pulling your hopes and dreams kicking and screaming
You'll never regret/not even a second
Light shines down in every moment.
