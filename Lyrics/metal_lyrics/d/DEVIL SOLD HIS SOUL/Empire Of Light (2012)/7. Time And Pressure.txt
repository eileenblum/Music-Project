The passing of our time
we borrowed out own fate
You hurt for nothing in your own mind
The walls are closing in and I can hardly breathe
You cannot hold onto my soul
bearing down
My heart grows darker
My arms grows weak
And I won't be able to see
No matter what they say
they can't explain
they cannot see my eyes
While hiding what I have left
you'll be my light
My arms grow weak
My arms grow weak
Lost
my heart grows darker
I set my sights too high
How can you think with the truth ablaze? Making up an excuse to rationale
the wrong
Your lack of thought will not break me down
But you don't even realize the cost
You take my arms
You take my light
You don't know how this feels to be so alone
You take too long to see that this is wrong
Just ignore all the sleepless nights
we'll break them all.
