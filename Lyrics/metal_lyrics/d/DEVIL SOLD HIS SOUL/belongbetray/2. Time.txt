Through these frozen winter nights
They drain our minds
They test us all
Through these tired and weary eyes
We say farewell to one of us
To a part of us all

And time will wait for no man
All that we've lost we'll never forget
Pull yourself off of the ground
Don't give up on it now
Just stay strong
There's a life to be led
And time will wait for no man

The sun goes down on a day which buried a friend
And through saddened smiles we'll go
Though the night is vast there is hope which always remains
So we'll just move on but not forget

(Through these times of no regret)

These old coins tokens of a time once lost
Its been lost to us all for too long
Through this blood a legacy
We'll push onwards to forge our own
From a part of us

The sun goes down on a day which buried a friend
And through saddened smiles we'll go
Though the night is vast there is hope which always remains
So we'll just move on but not forget

And time will wait for no man
