For all the times
I've been made to feel resentful
Towards the things I should be grateful for
By the ones I've laid trust on

But now it seems
I've become more resilient
For all the poison has been filtered out
And I feel alive again

And even through the hardest times
The storm will fail to break us down
Despite the falters, and there's been a few
We're still alive

And for all the misdirections
For all the broken paths
I've once been led
I lit the fuse to burn those bridges
No more will I re-tread these steps of mine

Even in our darkest times
Our brightest moments are born
Sometimes it takes a fall 
To become a stronger man

For every time
That a high was ripped away from me
By the vultures judging with their keys
I've left them all behind

But now it seems
I've become more resilient
For all the poison has been filtered out
And I feel alive again

And even through the hardest times
The storm will fail to break us down
Despite the falters, and there's been a few
We're still alive

We'll find these answers on our own
If we're led we'll never know
We'll forge our paths with blood and bone
If we're led we'll never know
