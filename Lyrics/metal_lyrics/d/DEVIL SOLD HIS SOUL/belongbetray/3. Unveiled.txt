Like it's my own life flashing before
Whilst they search for a purpose
An open door
And as they stare into false light
Words fall from the page
Their whole world a lie

We'll be saving ourselves
Even if the tides steal the shores
A truth unveiled over time
We'll be saving our god damned souls
Every cry let out falls on deaf ears
The clouds they gather above

When all that faith stands for nothing
How much resolve? How much you have left?

We'll be saving ourselves
Even if the tides steal the shores
A truth unveiled over time
We'll be saving our god damned souls
Every cry let out falls on deaf ears
The clouds they gather above

The truth is unveiled over time
Over time we'll be pulling ourselves from the edge

And we find ourselves at the end of it all
What we'll face what comes next
An ocean will tempt draw us to it's waves
They say we'll be cursed

Place your curse on me
