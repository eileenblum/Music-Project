A hate that outweighs love
Sold like water to the drowning
A frozen core
A thickened skin I have grown
Detached and loveless
Devoid and numb I am here
You must first belong to betray
I've done both I fear

Faceless and haunting me
Something I'll try to shake
Until my heart and veins run dry
Faceless and more than I can ignore
A reflection f a time that I long to not recall
But one we can't let go

For all my faults
For all my wrongs lay bare
And at this time
I'm just carrion to them
For all my faults
For all my wrongs lay bare
And at this time
I'm just carrion to them

Sure, I've bled but I've always healed
I don't believe I deserve to mend this time
Because all my wrongs lay peripheral
And they haunt me every single night
Sure, I've bled, but I've always healed
I don't believe I deserve to mend this time
Because all my wrongs lay peripheral

I've belonged
I've betrayed

(But one we can't let go)
