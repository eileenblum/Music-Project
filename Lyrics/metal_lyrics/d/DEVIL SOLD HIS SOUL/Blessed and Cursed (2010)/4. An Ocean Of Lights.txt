Into the depths that I had never before thought to have been a part of us.
Under bright lights things never quite look the same, the cracks widen through the whole thing.

I stop waiting for an answer, we're all lost.
As rain crushes my face, we're all lost.
The waves crash down around us, we're all lost.
This is a death, not my choice.

With the death of an ocean, will you pray for direction?
And the moment is fading, our hearts will never feel so heavy.
