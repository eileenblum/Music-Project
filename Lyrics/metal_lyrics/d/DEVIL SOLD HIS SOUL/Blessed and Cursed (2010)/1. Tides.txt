Hold down what's inside, I don't want to run.
I can't remember the last thing I said to you.
We'll separate the tides.

I will not give up on this hope but I'm falling to pieces.
I will not give up on this hope, will to survive, and all of this because I am blessed.

As much as I am blessed, I am cursed.
