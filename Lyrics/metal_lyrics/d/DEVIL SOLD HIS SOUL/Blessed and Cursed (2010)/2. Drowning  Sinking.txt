One day you will believe, the time will come to bury your bitter self, and I will be there just to watch you turn around.
Your last breath will be the moment that you realise your fate.
You have gone too far, and you know it's too late to change this time.

Drowning in metres, you don't precede your name.
This is the last time I ever want to hear your words, and I cannot belive this final prayer.
Finally at the lowest point of your demise.

I'll run just to see the sun, and I'll watch as light crushes all.
We'll see how the cities fall on our own.
See the way the vultures circle our heads, is this over?

The sun breathes into our lives, the momentum builds until we are all alone.
