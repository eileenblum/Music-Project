Your faith in people, and no it's never the same.
But I've waited so long.
This is our fall.
And from this moment we'll burn it all.
Let people remember, this is our time.

And even though it never was the first thing in your head, you always questionned.
I will not justify myself to you and this will be our last day, you forced my hand.

A hole in my life that I don't want to resent, but this is so hard.
I must accept the hate in my life, it was the least I could prove.
Will people remember?
This is our time.

And even though it never was the first thing in your head, you always questionned.
I will not justify myself to you and this will be our last day, you forced my hand.

Our hopes are fading, just forget what I said.
All the pieces that had fallen out of place. Well, I hurt and I ache.
So say that again.

With shattered souls and minds around me, I need some answers.
My eyes avoid the light and this can only mean but one thing.
My life has been changed.
