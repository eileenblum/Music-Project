Pray for day as the snow falls through the static air of this final cold light.
And I pray that you understand, you can't stand alone.
You're not frozen by yourself again.
There's not just winter, there's trust.
Without this, you'll sink, you'll never see the sky.

Walls stop the bitter winds from cutting through the cracks,
And I need to know there's a light,
And a life still left to live,
And I know that we will be the ones who stand tall and rise up to the end.
