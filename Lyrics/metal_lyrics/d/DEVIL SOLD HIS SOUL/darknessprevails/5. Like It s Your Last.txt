Bleeding thoughts I once had of you
Might as well not have been formed
Now they burn in an unknown place
I wish that I had said goodbye
Comparisons hold no meaning
So don't even try, I'veheard it before

Something special could grab the air
And pull a cloud over your heart
But it won't
Nothing special will come over you

Don't hold that thought
That single dying breath
It could break the moment in two
Leaving it useless and nothing special
Just broken
The way things are going
I hope this is possible

Wasted thoughts on time lost to broken moments
