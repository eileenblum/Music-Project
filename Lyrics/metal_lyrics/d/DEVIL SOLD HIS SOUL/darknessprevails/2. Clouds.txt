Put down the idea that I'm broken
The idea that you're not real
The idea that you can change
Change to you is no more than a new lie

Flowers unfold to show us a beautiful play
Is this not always who we are?
To keep this motion going is so selfish
Flowers unfold to show a beautiful charade

Let's dance on more time

You fill this empty heart
