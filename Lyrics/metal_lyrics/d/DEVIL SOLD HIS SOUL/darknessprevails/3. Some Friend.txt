You are here in my heart
Why won't you see me?
I can't hate you

I trusted you
You lied to me, betrayed me
How could you make me choose
Between us and you?
And then you treated me like an enemy
Then one day, you cut me out
Erased me from your life
It was like you have died
But I still see you

I was your friend
Some friend you turned out to be
I wish I had never befriended you

And now you talk down about me
Trying to change me into someone else
To erase your guilt
