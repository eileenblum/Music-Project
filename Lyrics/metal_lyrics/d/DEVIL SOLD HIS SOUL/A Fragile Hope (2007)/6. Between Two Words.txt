Your eyes to take cover
and all your lies will see the truth stand tall
Iâm drowning in you

the time has come to take it back
but this silence between two words;
and I promise that this is for real, another planned attack

I meant every second
every last word
Iâm drowning in you
and I can't change the past
Iâm drowning in your plight to fall
this time it's on you
you will take the blame for every single word

I cannot take it
to rise for air
and I cannot take this
to run from
I cannot take this
to rise for air
I cannot take this
my sense's gone and running from your eyes

once more I fade in the abyss of your failing heart
