Shattered pieces
the thoughts freeze my mind

a single breath is all i need
but i wanted to crush the desire in my fist
it's not nearly the same

terror grows inside me,
i'm starting to see the dark come down
bleak freedom surrounds us, you're not that brave

as i build walls around you there is nothing left to flee
falling down, waiting to decide the outcome of accusing you

one last time

i want a new horizon
a setting sun that you cannot destroy
the ashes of your love will remain
dawn is set to rest
and i know what you will say when i don't look back as i'm walking away

one last time
