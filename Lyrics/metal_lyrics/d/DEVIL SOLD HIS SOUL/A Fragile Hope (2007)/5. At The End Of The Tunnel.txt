Let's burn this city and start again
the time is right and we're ready to go
I want to stay but I must run
the last time that we spoke I said there was not a problem, a lie

paper eyes follow destruct and I wish you could see it
you look past the sky and see nothing
these words are all I ask, how can you want this?

kick down the doors, a fragile hope is found
the air is heavier than I thought
this time if it shatters, it's not my fault
and Iâm losing you again
I hope that you realise how this feels

let's burn this city down and start again the time is right and we're ready to go
Iâm seeing stars around your face
your race is nearly up

this is your last chance to see this through
