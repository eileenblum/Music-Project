I can't believe the thing you said to me
I never will relive that painful journey
So the fortress of discontent I build
And then you with your destructive self

Tearing at the foundation of my own happiness
Thick deep in the memory of forget
And infinite minutes of pain
Sometimes I force the blame on everyone
Like wrenching my cold heart from my thread
My cold heart, I'm tormented
By the void of helplessness, my selfishness

I can't believe the thing you said to me
I never will relive that painful journey
So the fortress of discontent I build
And then you with your destructive self

Thick deep in the memory of forget
And infinite minutes of pain
Sometimes I force the blame on everyone
Like wrenching my cold heart from my thread
In my heart, I'm tormented

By images that I cannot forget
And infinite minutes of pain
Sometimes I force the blame on everyone
