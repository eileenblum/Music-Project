Tonight in your eyes, I saw your fire die
There will be dreams to replace what fell apart
There will be hope to mend a child's broken heart
Promises of healing, they can be misleading
They are not what they seem
My love is made of broken dreams
When time was time and life was breath
The hope that still bounds us
Even as this darkness surrounds us
How, tonight in your eyes your fire dies
