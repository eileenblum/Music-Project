Nothing I call love can clear away the clouds
To see beauty, to live under the light of you
Nothing I call love can clear away the clouds
From this cold and rainy day
Just like nothing but fear
Can keep me walking through these dreams
And as the scent of you fills my lungs
My minded is burned inside out
To see beauty once more
I see the world as full as you
And when you're gone I see only grey
Your smile makes my heart stand still
As alive as my trust is for you
The greater my descent in your absence
I hear the rain outside and realize
That I have yet to live under the light of you
This loneliness stands between me
And my own true happiness
As alive as I am outside
A part of me dies when I hear your distant voice
I can't be saved if love cant save me
