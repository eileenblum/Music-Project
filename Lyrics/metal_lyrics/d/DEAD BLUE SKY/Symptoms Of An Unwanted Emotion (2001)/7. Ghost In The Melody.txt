With every act, with eyes, and all of my being
From what is left of me and every dream
That I still hope to share with only you
What once was will never be again
To all that is I give and that I am not
What I've left behind has not left me
The next time you hear laughter
The silence belongs to me
I hold in mind and in heart
This earth that I have not loved
Will hold me
As I lay beneath it
This earth will hold me
