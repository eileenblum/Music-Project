I leave this secret with you
Think of it what you will
I've never felt so empty
This place has drained me
This place I could never hate more
I tried to forget what I've once felt or thought
Back when everyone was so genuine
What have I become?
I'm too close to the end
Of these winding down waters
A heartless configuration
A place I call home
It's all gone just that fast
And I've been alone the whole time
So now we begin the journey to oblivion
It starts to remind me
Of the day we rolled in the posies
Nothing mattered to us but each other
I could stare into your eyes for days
But good things all end the same
One too many memories to remind you
Of how amazing life once was
