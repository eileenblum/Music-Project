Broken wings surround
Shelter me in your embrace
Your feathers have burned
Specks of ash cover your solemn face
Your elegant eyes are merciless
As the wind whips through your silhouette of grace
Shade my eyes from impurity
I put my trust in you, will you put your trust in me?
Instill your undying beauty
Your essence burns in me
Your voice fills my heart
With words to life my soul to fly
I close my eyes
As fingers brush my lips
Words like poetry, dreams lake form
And spreading wings
Your essence burns in me
