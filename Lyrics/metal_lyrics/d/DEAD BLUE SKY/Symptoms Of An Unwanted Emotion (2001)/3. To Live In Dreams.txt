Through the stains in my mind
I put the past to rest
Forget the cold years lie
And walk into forever
Standing in the presence
The days now bleed away
I shut my eyes to see
And dream to see your face again
Quiet reflection consumes me
Until I surrender to screams
I want to breathe again
I want to sleep no more
I have nothing but to remember
A delicate reminder
Say goodbye in a breath
Sometimes you just let go
