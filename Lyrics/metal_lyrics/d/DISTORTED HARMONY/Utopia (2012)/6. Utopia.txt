I walk on roads as red as blood
With bricks of greed and hate
While men are going wrong and right
Making their own fate

But they don't know that death awaits
No matter what they will
They don't believe in hell, just heaven
So they go on and kill
They go on and kill
They go on and kill
They go on and kill

And all into nothing
And all into nothing
And all into nothing

Without mercy without a soul
They make their path in blood
They soon will have to swim through red
For it becomes a flood

But what is blood if not a price
So small and so unnoticed
They shed it with every little step
And no one dares to protest
No one dares to protest
No one dares to protest

And all into nothing
And all into nothing
And all into nothing

We fight wars so we can keep fighting wars
At home, at work, it's all one great big beautiful mess
Countries make their bread by selling weapons
Making death by baking life
Those who rule are ruled by rule
We little people go about our lives dreaming big dreams but taking little steps
Thinking the world is too big for us little people to make a difference
...Is this our utopia?

Is this our utopia?

I see it all and fall and cry
For I forsaw the future
I too dared not to speak a word
I let them go and butcher

We grew like wild weeds in a field
That god forgot to groom
We took control and led ourselves to humanity's own doom
Humanity's own doom

And all into nothing
And all into nothing
And all into nothing
