I heard someone suffered to give you life to make you mine
Carry you everywhere dear old friend you always lend a hand
You kiss me on the cheek as I speak secrets of the heart
All of these years I never asked myself what's inside the box

Open you up to look inside
Finally see the truth that you hide

You're made of sorrow hard work no morrow
I try not to think about it

Nobody knows no one cares - Where stuff comes from
Life goes on everywhere - Doesn't worry us at all
Anything I can't see - Disappears from
My life is hard enough - No more room for us care

When you are old and frail I'll frown a bit, then dispose of you
Maybe I'll keep you locked tight in a drawer, then go find someone new
Soon before long I will forget I ever had you in my life, moving to the next
Next big thing

You're made of sorrow hard work no morrow

Nobody knows no one cares - Where stuff comes from
Life goes on everywhere - Doesn't worry us at all
Anything I can't see - Disappears from
My life is hard enough - No more room for us care
