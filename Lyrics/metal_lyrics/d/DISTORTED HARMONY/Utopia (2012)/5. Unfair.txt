Watch over me
Lost in the mall without her
Responsible for my own fate
I take the slides
Forget all about
Somebody comes takes it all away

Where have you been
I never ask you for anything
How could you
Just try to care about me
About me

Kids have no choice but to fall in love
Fall oh we fall so we can rise above

It's all cuz we won't see
We can understand oh we barely know ourselves
Oh how we are blind to the ones we are closest to

Kids have no choice but to fall in love
Fall oh we fall so we can rise above
