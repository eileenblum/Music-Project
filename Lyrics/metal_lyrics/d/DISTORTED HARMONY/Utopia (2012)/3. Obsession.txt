They say to look into your eyes
s'like through a window to your soul
They've never seen me cry

Mine are naive and childish
but don't say much about me
An honest way to guard a lie

Don't hurt
Everybody's got flaws
You are
Stuck in this shit for too long

Feel my skin burn (skin burn)
A demon lives within me
I am the scorn
I am my enemy
Nothing I can do
I rue my destiny

They ask me why I tell them how
Cause I don't really know for sure
it starts from where it never ends

To touch to smile sometimes I try
To bring myself to understand
Sometimes I only need a friend

Don't hurt
Everybody's got flaws
You are
Stuck in this shit for too long

Feel my skin burn
A demon lives within me
I am the scorn
I am my enemy
Nothing I can do
I rue my destiny

I grew up just like everyone
A normal kid in normal town
My parents were the good guys

It's just something fucked up inside (reverse)
Something is messed up with my mind
It's not my fault at all

Don't hurt
Everybody's got flaws
I am
Not gonna take this shit anymore

Feel my skin burn
The demon is leaving me
I am reborn
Gone is my enemy
Nothing I can't do
I rule my destiny
