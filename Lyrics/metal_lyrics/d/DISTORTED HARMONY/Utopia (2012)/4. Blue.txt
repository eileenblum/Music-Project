Airplane crashes bright white cloud
Blue sea turns red, sun falls down
Good things always end before their time

Diamond eyes been shut a while
Soft hair to a brown old straw
Closing the white bag around her
Put her in the ground

Hold me, I can't stop the tears from falling
Heal me, give me a place to lean on

Pain
Is it just a illusion?
Fear
Lost in my confusion
Lies
There is no place for me
Home
Home is six feet underground

I see the end in everything
I see the end in everything

No matter where, life is unfair, our souls are forgotten
Days come and go, nobody knows just when will it happen
And we spend our time aging

Pain
Just an old broken hour glass
Fear
It's a mistake, I see her eyes
Shine
A bright light a tunnel dies
Life
It's a game, the dice don't lie

I see the end in everything
I see the end in everything

No matter where, life is unfair, our souls are forgotten
Days come and go, nobody knows just when will it happen
Yet we spend our time searching for reasons

Hold me, I can't stop the tears from falling
Heal me, give me a place to lean on
