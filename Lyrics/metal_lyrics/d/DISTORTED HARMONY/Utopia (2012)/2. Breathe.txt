You call it's late afternoon
The mice are all out of the race
I drown in work but you sound disturbed
I guess I can wait I guess I can wait

While he's holding your hand
You don't even care
But you're the kind of girl
Who will paint the skies blue

I close my eyes and open my heart
This time I'm better sorry than smart

Breathe into my mouth
Breathe into my mouth

Inside the shame there's a world coming back for me
A world coming back inside the shame
There's a world coming back for me
A world coming back for me

Clutch release, twitch n' squeeze
Blow my mind, satiate me
Girl better raise that chin
Daddy loves you baby
God will judge his sin

I close my eyes and open my heart
This time I'm better sorry than smart

Breathe into my mouth
Breathe into my mouth

Inside the shame there's a world coming back for me
A world coming back inside the shame
There's a world coming back for me
A world coming back for me
