METHYLENE BLUE â¢ IâM SORRY FOR KILLING YOU â¢ BEAUTIFUL GENE â¢ IâVE FOUND MY OWN STRENGTH IN YOU â¢ FOLLOWED YOUR RULES â¢ CARRIED OUT WHAT YOU CHOSE ME TO â¢ HISTORY IN RHYMES â¢ ALL IN SERVICE OF GREATER GOOD â¢ METHYLENE BLUE â¢ DONâT FORGET WHAT WE DID TO YOU

TAKE ONE LIFE â¢ SO YOU AND I â¢ MAY LIVE â¢ FAR AWAY â¢ WHERE WE CAN HIDE â¢ OUR GUILT â¢ TAKE THIS LIFE â¢ AND WEâLL BE FREE â¢
TO LIVE â¢ FAR AWAY â¢ WHERE JUDGING EYES â¢ ARE DEAD

PRAISE THE SUN â¢ LET HER WASH YOUR SINS â¢ PRAISE THE SUN â¢ BEFORE SHE GOES AWAY â¢ WE ALL KNOW THIS TALE â¢ HEARD IT MANY TIMES BEFORE â¢ ONLY TIME WILL TELL â¢ OR WEâLL BE LEFT WITH NOTHING BUT THE RAIN

METHYLENE BLUE â¢ IâM SORRY FOR KILLING YOU â¢ METHYLENE BLUE â¢ DONâT FORGET WHAT WE DID TO YOU
