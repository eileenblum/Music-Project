ALL THE THINGS I TRIED TO SAY â¢ LOSING TIME â¢ ALL THE PLACES I HAVE dreamed â¢ BLURRED MY MIND â¢ SEARCH FOR THE HAPPINESS AND AGONY

FALL AS YOU GO â¢ ITâS YOUR TIME TO GROW â¢ AND YOU FALL AS YOU GO â¢ ITâS THE PATH TO RISE AND START ALL OVER â¢ FALL AS YOU GO â¢ ITâS YOUR TIME TO LET GO â¢ AND YOU FALL AS YOU GO â¢ AS YOU GO

ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW â¢ WERE SO INNOCENT â¢ HEARTS BLOW UP AND THEN WE BREATHE â¢ AND REBUILD AGAIN â¢ ALL THE SHAPES WE MAKE WILL LEAD THE WAY

FALL AS YOU GO â¢ ITâS YOUR TIME TO GROW â¢ AND YOU FALL AS YOU GO â¢ ITâS THE PATH TO RISE AND START ALL OVER â¢ FALL AS YOU GO â¢ ITâS YOUR TIME TO LET GO â¢ AND YOU FALL AS YOU GO â¢ AS YOU GO
