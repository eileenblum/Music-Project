EVERY TIME SHE CRIES â¢ SEE IT IN HER EYES â¢ OUR OWN FATE SHE GUARDS â¢ EVERY TIME SHE CALLS â¢ SOAKED WITH TEARS SHE FALLS â¢ FOR OUR RIGHT TO LIFE â¢ CALLUS GROUND OF SYMPATHY â¢ MOURN HER RHYMES OF UNITY â¢ EVERY TIME SHE SMILES â¢ PAINTS THE SOUND OF RIGHTEOUS â¢ PATHS TO GUIDE OUR DARKNESS â¢ EVERY CHOICE WE MAKE â¢ BY YOUR SIDE STANDING â¢ WATCH OUR TIME ENDING

BEAUTIFUL LIGHT TAKE US â¢ BEAUTIFUL LIGHT TAKE US HOME â¢ LEAD US TO A NEW BEGINNING â¢ SOMEPLACE FAR AWAY â¢ TAKE WITH YOU OUR WORKS OF BEAUTY â¢ AND MAKE HER SMILE AGAIN

TIMELESS CHANT OF HISTORY â¢ A POEM BORN OUT OF MISERY â¢ A FUTURE WE DECIDE â¢ STROKES OF DISTANT MEMORY â¢ ONE NOTE WILL CHANGE THE LEGACY â¢ OF WHAT WEâLL LEAVE BEHIND

SO SAY WE ALL

BEAUTIFUL LIGHT TAKE US â¢ BEAUTIFUL LIGHT TAKE US HOME â¢ LEAD US TO A NEW BEGINNING â¢ SOMEPLACE FAR AWAY â¢ TAKE WITH YOU OUR WORKS OF BEAUTY â¢ AND MAKE HER SMILE AGAIN

âAnd we should consider every day lost, on which we have not danced at least once. And we should call every truth false, which was not accompanied by at least one laugh.â
[Nietzsche]
