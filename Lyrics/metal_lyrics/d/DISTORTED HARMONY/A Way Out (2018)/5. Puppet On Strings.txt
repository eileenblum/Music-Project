So low, I've been so low
Had to let go of my former broken self
I know, yes I do know
What you're hiding
Underneath your second skin

You put a face on your face
Show no disgrace
You dance all night like a puppet on strings

I know, trust me, I know
What stirs under and behind that empty stare
Magic, beauty, tragic
There's no logic in a world that's so unfair

You put a face on your face (Not alone)
Show no disgrace (I'm here with you)
You dance all night like a puppet on strings

You put a face on your face (Not alone)
Show no disgrace (I'm here with you)
You dance all night like a puppet on strings
