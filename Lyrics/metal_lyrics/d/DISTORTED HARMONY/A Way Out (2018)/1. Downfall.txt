She cried
They never had a chance
For nothing is meant to last

She tried
The one who believed in luck
A dream shattered before her eyes

Tell me how could we have come to this
We took this gift and threw it all away
Tell me why we didn't stop our downfall
What will we leave behind

They cried
Never thought she'd leave
Abandon them in their need

They tried
Repairing what they did
But dreams aren't meant to last

Tell me how could we have come to this
We took this gift and threw it all away
Tell me why we didn't stop our downfall
What will we leave behind
