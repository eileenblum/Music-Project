Awaken to an endless nightmare
Came to be by touch of sin
A soul was lost, reborn
The trust that was, now gone
A faded memory of what used to be

Taken by the silence
Quiet and afraid
Kept inside a deep dark hole
A secret she will never share

She smiles and goes to sleep
Forever dream and wonder
Inside, her mind is clear
Where she lives and breathes

Behind the walls of thunder
A joyful child still plays
Inside, her mind is clear
Where she lives and breathes

Don't let them fade away
Don't let them fade away
Don't let them fade away
Don't let them fade away

Awaken to an endless nightmare
Came to be by touch of sin
A soul was lost, reborn
The trust that was, now gone
A fading memory of what should have been
