Severed and afraid
A lonesome child is crying
Lost beneath the crashing sound
Of our emancipation

Save us
From ourselves
Lead us
To a better place

Take our dream
Know it's real
Let them know
We're still here
We believe

Severed and afraid
Another lonely child is dying
There are no lines, we crossed them all
In our annihilation

Our endless strife
We struggle yet cannot embrace
Our dying light
Corruption has taken its place

Take our dream
Know it's real
Let them know
We're still here
We believe

Take our dream
Know it's real
Let them know
We're still here
We believe
