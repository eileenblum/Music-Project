Sad tides, they keep turning inside
All the reasons I cannot escape
The power to let go

Sides, always playing my mind
Pushing forward yet taking me back
The peaceful devour

Pain, getting further away
In the dark we all play the game
An endless desire

Fear, turn my back to reality
In the midst of transgression
Lies the will to be free

Here, the sun and moon will sing
You are free
Here, the light and dark can see
We are free

Shame, there's no fault in believing
All the things I will never be
The stories I'll never hear

Guilt, there's no pleasure in wanting
All the fragments I cannot pick up
A dreadful desire

Here, the sun and moon will sing
You are free
Here, the light and dark can see
We are free

Here, the sun and moon will sing
You are free
Here, the light and dark can see
We are free
