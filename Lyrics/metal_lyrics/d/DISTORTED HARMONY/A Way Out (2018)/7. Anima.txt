Tender soul
You that guides me
Tell me more
About what I can't see

Tender soul
My one and only friend
You led me through this narrow path
Don't leave me here astray

Taken by the stream
No sense of direction
Within a fading dream
A way out a light can be seen

Gentle soul
You that haunts me
Tell me why
I cannot let you go

Gentle soul
My enemy within
A dream I had where you were gone
And I was finally free

Taken by the stream
No sense of direction
Within a fading dream
A way out a light can be

Taken by the stream
No sense of direction
Within a fading dream
A way out a light can be seen
