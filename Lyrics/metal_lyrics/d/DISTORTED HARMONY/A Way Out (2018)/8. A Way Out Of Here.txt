I'm all out of words
Closed behind these walls
Trying to let go abandon your hold
But sorrow and anger remain
These feelings I wonder, will they ever stop
When silence is witnessed again

Find me a way out of here
Find me a way out of here

This place I created that nothing can touch
Where no one's allowed to be
I thought I'd be safe there, where I wouldn't falter
A prison it turned out to be
Trying to let go abandon this cold and lonely place
These feelings I wonder, will I have the strength to get away

Find me a way out of here
Find me a way out of here
