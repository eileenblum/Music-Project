Treasure all you know and feel
Keep it so itâs never lost
Forever hold these tiny moments
For someday you will see her laugh

Madness carves its own deception
So many voices make no sense
Locked into an endless battle
She lets you see her fading path

What you once were is lost and buried
Forever in its rightful place
She gives you hope a brand new meaning
For someday you will make her laugh
