I wish I was at home
I wish that there was
Someone waiting there
Greeting with a smile
As I come through the door
Showing me a life
I never had

Take away the fear
I never thought would leave
Create a world where
We can be ourselves

Time and time again
I feel it close and wonder
Is she the one, the missing piece

Time and time again
I feel it close and wonder
Will I ever let her in

I wish she felt at home
I wish I could
Forever let her stay
Greet her with a smile
She'll never want to end
Give meaning to the dream
She always had

Make the pain a fading memory
Build a place where we are finally free

Time and time again
I feel it close and wonder
Is she the one, the missing piece

Time and time again
I feel it close and wonder
Will I ever let her in
