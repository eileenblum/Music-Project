Stranded
I stand here again
Baffled
I cannot explain how I got here
Bound by
Handcuffs of shame (they whisper to me)
Welcome, let's play a game

Come here little boy, it's OK
Don't you hide yourself
We've got all the toys, up here
On the highest shelf

Will you find me
Looking for myself
Right before they
take me back to room eleven

Dragged in
The corridor
Feet slide
Towards the door, scraping my skin
Voices
Stronger than pain (they whisper to me)
Don't move, you struggle in vain

Come here little boy, it's OK
Don't you hide yourself
We've got all the toys, up here
On the highest shelf

Until you find me
Save me from myself
Feeling, rising, longing, reaching

You have to find me
Within myself
Right before they *
Take me back to room eleven
