I'll be the future master of the insanity
I will reign with just one word
Keep your mind and your eyes open to survive
Keep yourself alive,
Yourself alive
Be mine this night
Be my queen

Someday my heart will meet your love
(so close to be so real)
Through this road and through this pain
(never been so real)
I'll make my choice

There are no more solutions, no meaning to believe
These words cannot prove, the love I feel for you
I see your eyes in my eyes, cutting like a knife

Yourself alive
Be mine this night
Be my queen

Someday my heart will meet your love
(so close to be so real)
Through this road and through this pain
(never been so real)
I'll make my choice
