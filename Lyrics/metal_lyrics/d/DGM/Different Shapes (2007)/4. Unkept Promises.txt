Un-spoken words, un-kept promises
This is what a man should do in his life
Un-broken alliance, still on and on and on

We just don't know, time after time
Lost in this world

I'll find a reason why
To live in perfect harmony with you my shining star, side by side
Together we will fight
Together we'll survive
To millions battle just to testify our love

Who will be the next today
To forget the lesson learned in wasted years long long time ago
It's been a shame, it's been so fake
To be prisoners of ourself

We just don't know, time after time
Lost in this world

Story will tell, who will be wise
And who will survive
Caught in this world
Caught through this lies
Breaking this chains to be alive
