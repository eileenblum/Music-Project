This time I'll take it my own way
This time it just won't be a fake

Don't look at me, don't judge me now
The words you said; I'm screaming out

Don't speak at me, don't bother me
The shortest straw has pulled out

Infernal thoughts burning my mind
Unleashed upon us all

My brain is cracking down in hate
What should I do is turn the page

I've lost control, I can't believe
The scent of you is killing me

For every step I'll take
There will be a bounds I have to break
I guess I'll be alone

All the things I do are wrong in this world for you
(just give me a peace of mind)
Stay by my side and we will rejoin as one
