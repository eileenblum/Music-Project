Whispers and tears, under the signs of time
Passing through this loneliness, into this silence
Bring to me the war again, I cannot breath, I cannot move
This feeling is to deep for me, for me

This is real, this sort of persistence is killing me
Sad but true, dying is the only way to live for me

Since I'll be back for just one reason
(I will destroy all the barricades)
Fighting for just one more day
I'll keep your thought into my mind
(drinking the blood of my enemies)
Living for just one more day

Facing the desert without fear
Only the brave will destroy this faith
Escaping from this battle
I'm sure I will kill the king of the kings

This is real, this sort of persistence is killing me
Sad but true, dying is the only way to live for me

Since I'll be back for just one reason
(I will destroy all the barricades)
Fighting for just one more day
I'll keep your thought into my mind
(drinking the blood of my enemies)
Living for just one more day
