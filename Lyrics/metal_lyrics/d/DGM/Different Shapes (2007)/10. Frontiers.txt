My eyes, bleeding this tears for you
This earth is your world
Don't let the nature die for your crimes
And build a new frontiers for your child

(I gotta feel it)
Just keep a little moment
( for you and me tonight)
To live just little closer
You can stop this shame, you can give us a chance
To let this shit outside

The sky looks so fine
The mountain is so high
I feel I'm reaching this life
The sunshine makes me fly
Up to your eyes

(I gotta feel it)
Just keep a little moment
( for you and me tonight)
To live just little closer
You can stop this shame, you can give us a chance
To let this shit outside
