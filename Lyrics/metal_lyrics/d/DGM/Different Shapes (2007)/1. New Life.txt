Catastrophic way to live your life until the end
Walking upon your bones this is what you want
Tasting your magic moment, feeling as a god
Distorted visions, without a sense of no return

Nobody will touch you, nobody will hurt you
You'll be a king for a day, a king without his crown

When the darkness falls and the lights go down
Evil thoughts are growing in my heart

A new life is born, and will fight with body and soul
For a future with love and hope
A new day will come, the sun will shine so high, upon our lives

You think is better to leave this life for someone else
Destroyed by the lies this is what you want
Failing your magic moment, feeling as a shit
Distorted visions, without a sense of no return

When the darkness falls and the lights go down
Evil thoughts are growing in my heart

A new life is born, and will fight with body and soul
For a future with love and hope
A new day will come, the sun will shine so high, upon our lives

Something's ride away across the seven seas
Something fade away and I
Search a reason why
I fall into your eyes
Someone will destroy this time

A new life is born, and will fight with body and soul
For a future with love and hope
A new day will come, the sun will shine so high, upon our live
