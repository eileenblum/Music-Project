Knowledge growing inside my head
Refusing all these stereotypes
I'm looking for my thread of thought
Desolation all around reminds me war and tragic deads
We are just poor human flesh

Don't ask me why, I'm feeling lonely without you

I need a reason to break free
I need a place to stay alone
I need someone to tell me what I'm looking for
Feeling you near, tasting the fear
I'm feeling lost in my dreams

I need to find a better way to live
You know I'm trying to survive

Don't ask me why, I'm feeling lonely without you

I need a reason to break free
I need a place to stay alone
I need someone to tell me what I'm looking for
Feeling you near, tasting the fear
I'm feeling lost in my dreams
