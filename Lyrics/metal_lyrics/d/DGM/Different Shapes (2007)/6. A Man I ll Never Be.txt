Someone inside me is changing my thoughts
Someone inside me suggest me the truth
I can't understand well if it's me or a dream
This voice is rising but now I believe

Just right here, I'm sitting alone
Into this cold and empty room
Hiding my face between my hands
I've just realize that I'm a fool

I cannot escape from myself
Please give me a reason to be
A man that I've never been
A man that should be free
To think and to live
Where nightmares and dreams collide

How does it came, it was a mistake
Born from the visions behind my eyes
This thing left aside, now is sweeping in me
Blow it away, now would mean sanity

Hiding my face between my hands
Bleeding I am, I can't understand

I cannot escape from myself
Please give me a reason to be
A man that I've never been
A man that should be free
To think and to live
Where nightmares and dreams collide
