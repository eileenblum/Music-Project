See them fall in love again
Passion rules the way
Until the morning after

Everywhere I look someone is
Hidin
Tearing their pain alone
In a freezin emotion

'Cause all my feelings are fadin'
away
To make me strong
But the reason is gone

It's not a dream
Now or never please don't let me
Alone
It's not a dream
Can you feel it
There's no reason no through the
Eyes of the storm

Everything I feel won't last
Forever
Now can we stop the dream
Or kill this illusion
