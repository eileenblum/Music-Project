Desert's view from the earth
A faithful sense of careless
The stars are watching you
I'm alone in the universe floating
In the air

Facing the light, carry me
Through
Walk behin' the un-breakable walls
I'll live again
Breathing the air from beginning
Of time alone
Now I'm losing my mind in a prayer
I'll se the light

Alone with my agony
There's a rage desire inside of me
I'll turn the page
An dream away

Tears in the night my heart is
Breakin'
I'm feelin lost and blue

When the sky begin to cry and I
Know
You could be mine one last time

I'm feelin' satisfied everything's
Alright without you
Try to carry on ready to be
Strong
I'm still here on my own
