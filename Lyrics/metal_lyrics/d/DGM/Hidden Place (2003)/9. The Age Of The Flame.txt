Sawin' the seeds of evil
The slaves of the darklight
Fightin' fearless against
Shadows of light

Silent screamers comes
From the hell
Calling me in the name of
The god
Burning inside the age of
The flame

Tonight running thorugh
The time will be tonite
Take my hands
Whatever I've done is not
Too late

Can't you see my condition
Am I dead or alive
Don't you think that is
Better believe
I'm out of control
Don't tell me
Stop cryin'
I know what I need

Tonight running through
The time will be tonite
Take my hands
Whatever I've done is not
Too late
