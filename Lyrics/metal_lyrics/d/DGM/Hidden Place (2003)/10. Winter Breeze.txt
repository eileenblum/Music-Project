The winter breeze that caress my
Face take away
All my tears
Spreadin' my sensation of emptiness
Findin' the way to call you

For all time we've spent together
Sittin' around the fire watchin the
Stars and the sky
Surrounded by a magical air
Sometimes I wonder why
Things happen so fast
You don't have time to reflect
No time to think no time to burn
The action is done you can't go back
This time alone

For everytime I've been lookin' for
The light of your eyes
For everytime I've lost my desire

But now I'll keep my energy
To start a new life my time is coming
I will rise

Time will heal your wounds
There's no one here to blame
Time will stop your tears
Again and again

Stay with me and try to reach my
Heaven
Forever like a dream
Without a dreamers
