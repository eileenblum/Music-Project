Lost into your heart one
Thousands miles away from here
I'm searchin for your eyes nothing
To hide
There's no meaning in the words
You said before

There's something everywhere
Feelings can't be wrong
Deep inside you know I'm falling
Down and callin'

Time will come tonite
Theirs is nothing you can say to
Make me feel worse
Than I do you can't buy my soul
I feel so strange
What is the meaning of this
Words I wrote today
I'm out of my mind

And I'll try to understand
Feelings can't be wrong
Your lie can't be no real
