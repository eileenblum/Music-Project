Another day to spend my seasons
Another time alone
Waitin' for a call that never
Comes

Another way to reach my heaven
A place where I will stay
Far beyond the walls has never
Throwin' down

We'll never die
I will stop this night everything
That I feel
Let me cry just for one more time
This is all that I need

It's too much time that I'm still
Losing all my life
To testify my love
To testify my pride

Another wise man told me
..... "Feel inside your heart"
I'll find the way to leave my
Dream
I start to realize
