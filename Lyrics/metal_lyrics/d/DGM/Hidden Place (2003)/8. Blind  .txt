Dark is spinning light goes
Down
Everything goes to the end
But what we know is not will
Find
Blackened all around me makes
Me blind
Makes me blind

Keep all your emotions stand
Up for your rights
Try to free your mind
You can't be wrong,
You can't be right
Let faith surrounds you
Anyway

Never let it down love
Is all you need
Love is all we need

I'm still waitin for my last
Surrender
I'm still lookin for your eyes,
Again

Hear the sound
Why can't you feel it all
Around
Voices from your heart

Screamin' louder inside my mind
