A vision of myself with the anger
Still inside
Surrender by a thin invisible rain,
That seems tears that fall
Day by day until the end of the time.
For what we living
For what has been and for what will
Be tonite
Confusion in my mind (Rifare)
The only goal for spent the life
Alone
Once we were one and now I can't
Believe

It's all so far away - And in this air
We are together
And there's no reason to pretend the
Eternal love we've gave
And take......

C'mon now - Can't wait you - This day
Could be the last train
Believe me, caress me and we could
Be this crazy rain

I slowly close my eyes, before i fall
A sleep
With these promises on the wall
I'll tell you
I'll try to be something's else
I'll try to be the one and only who
Has take your heart tonite
Forever we'll be there until the end
Of time

It's all so far away - And in this air
We are together
And there's no reason to pretend the
Eternal love we've gave
And take.....

C'mon now - Can't wait you - This day
Could be the last train
Believe me, caress me and we could
Be this crazy rain
