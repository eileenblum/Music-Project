Now we probably shall live
Learning from the other side
I'm feeling through my veins

Where the vision of my life
From the echoes of my past
I'm still waiting everyday
To leave this dream come true

Rain is fallin from the sky
A trip inside my head
Tryin' to stop the time again

We fallin' down into a sub-
Conscious way to life
Still lost our time again and
Searching for the truth

Trust me fightin' in my eyes
Together to believe in this sad
Reality

Ridin' the clouds we'll love
Again
The time will be a tear
Insane promise to leave this life
Help me day by day
Save me from this rain
Want you love yourself
Leave this earth today
