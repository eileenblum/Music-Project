I didn't get up from this bed
Everything I need is a warm
Place
Always livin' through a glass
Of something
And always livin with
The fear to die
Before I faced my life

I'm lookin' inside the mirror
Cannot see the end
Shadows floatin' all around
My head

I've never felt alone
And voices from the past
Take me into a deep and
Silent dance
In all my hidden places

Take me far away from here
Save me from my nightmares
Hold my hands for one more
Time, again
Open your heart to me tonite

Time will find, the answers for
Your life
Sun will rise, shinin on the ay
To keep my soul

Wastin time and searching
All my life
To be real
