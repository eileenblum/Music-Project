The good and bad
Are falling in your dreams
A second to decide
Create your destiny
What a kind of conscience?
Magic memory
You will find your secret emotions
Every time you'll need

Every time you'll need

Whisper in a dream
Feeling every sin
Blinded by the light
Reach the eternity

Lost into your tears
Knowing through the fear
Everyone will rise tomorrow, and then fall again

There will be in a place
Where the slaves and masters die together
Under a same dark sky the same will be for you

There will be a time
When you'll find the right solution,
To live without the shadows of your life

[Repeat refrain]
