I believe you'll carry on
Searching into your memories
Take a journey search for life (should be)

I'm in a dreamland
No pain no sorrow anyway
I'm not the same now

Rising from the ground

Everything will rise around your head
Every time over and over again

Lost in what you'll never know
Help me to tear down the wall
Why can't you hear me?
I'm the answer you're waiting for
Lost in what you'll never know
Help me to tear down the wall
Why can't you hear me?
I'm not the same anymore

There's a place for everyone
There's a light into the dark
[Break your chains to be alive]

I'm in a wasteland
I know the frainless that you feel inside your heart

Rising from the ground

[Repeat chorus and refrain]

For your face I search, to take m to the place where i belong
But time is not enough and I'm...Crawling on the floor
Help this restless soul to find
What I'm searching for
