It's the night to be the master
Time to be the one
A star alone in the sky

Cause I never stopped to crying
You never stopped your lies
Lost in my secret shining

Just a kind of dream illusion of what that I can't see,
Try to keep my destiny
Tell me the price I have to pay!

I can't remember what is the meaning of my life
You'll be my guide
Too many voices in my mind

There is something to believe
My religion sacrifice
My soul is burning tonight

I'll searching for my ego
In the echoes of your love
Tell me the price I have to pay!

Dreams are coming through the night
Heaven's gate are closed for my eyes
Losing the faith
My hands are empty, stay with me tonight
