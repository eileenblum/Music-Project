Lost in the darkness, just before you die
There's no feeling there's no time around
Waiting for the holy light
The skies of the other side
Are coming through your madness, you feel unbound
Like a drop in the ocean
Falling in to your destiny

Unable to desire
A so sweet surrender
What is the meaning of my life?

'Cause if you try to understand
You'll find a reason why
Everything will gonna be
The keys of paradise

Awake! Neverending pain, fall into the madness
Shadow shine in your empty rain
Crying out the name of lord

[Repeat chorus and refrain]
