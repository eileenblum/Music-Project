I've been waiting all my life
tell me what you feel
Something that you know and I can't see
Wasting all my time searching for a dream
Lookin' for the place into your heart
Where I belong

No reason to live
When can't dream of you
'Cause what I can feel is in the end
You're the only one that I need

I'm standing by your side
Feelin' all your fear
Something that you know and I can see
The person you should be
The one you'll never be
Looking for the place into your heart
Where I belong

No reason to cry
When can't think of you
'Cause what I can feel is in the end
You're the only one that I need

[Repeat refrain]
