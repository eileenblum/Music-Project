Lie! (lie)
You'll pay the price
Knowing the meaning of pain, into your eyes
Wait for the night...

Cry! (cry)
I'm still alive, lost into the madness of my mind
Still sacrifice...

Returning to my memory

Waiting for the night is coming
Through your eyes I see 'cause I'm still
Waiting for the night is coming
Through your eyes I see 'cause I'm still

Dreams still know your love
Through the conscience of your soul
With no more lies

Fight (fight)!
Wait for the dawn
Running searching the truth
Behind your eyes
I'm still alive...

Returning to my memory

[Repeat chorus and refrain]
