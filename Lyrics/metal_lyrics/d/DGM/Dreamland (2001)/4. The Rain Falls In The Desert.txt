Looking out the window
I see my life, falling like a leaf
Why can't you help me?
To change my destination
With a simple sign, you can darken our sky

Take me with you in this journey
For the place I'm going it's useless and it's enough
Standing by my side

Living together...
Was the only thing that we can make best
I can't remember
Your endless smile beyond your eyes
Searching for the life is gone away

Looking from the mirror
I see the man, I'll never be for you
Help me please forever!

Every time I see the rising sun
Lost into your eyes again, feeling pain...
Where are you now!

Ever and ever...
Running into the labyrinth of my heart
Wait for the moonlight...

Side by side together, we can fly away forever
This is my dream...
Will be so real

[Repeat refrain]
