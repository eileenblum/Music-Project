You are the man that I know
I want your life, just before my eyes
There's a feeling forever, something so strange
Why can't you feel that I'm still without your love

I'm in a dream but I'm crying
Standing by my side
You're in a maze but not alone
Wait for the night, I'll be with you

...Can you see what I see inside?
Awake from my restless night
A storm into my real desire
You're the one in my destiny

I'm in a dream but I'm crying
Standing by my side
You're in a maze but not alone
Wait for the night, I'll be with you

[Repeat refrain]
