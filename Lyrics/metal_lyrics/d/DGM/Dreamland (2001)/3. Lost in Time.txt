Thinking the words I'll never hear
I'll never rest in peace
I'm still wait for the dawn

There's no more time for everyone
Don't tell me anymore
We can live it forever
I still looking for truth

How many words, I'm living in a lie?
How many tears but I'm still
I'm still alone...

If you try to fall asleep, without any conscience
There no beginning and there's no end

I can't believe (in you) 'cause I'm lost in time

And I'll be waiting for you!

I can't destroy my memory
(But) you'll never turning back
I was blinded by the light
I'll be looking for the truth

How many words, I'm living in a lie?
How many tears but I'm still
I'm still alone...

If you try to fall asleep, without any conscience
There no beginning and there's no end

I can't believe (in you) 'cause I'm lost in time

And I'll be waiting for you!
