Too many warnings
Rose from the earth
We are leaving

It's a rush to other worlds
We are not allowed to live into this one
It's our fault

From the place I know
From the words I've heard
To the Universe we'll belong

My journey's turning into
What will divide us forever
In this fairy world
We'll live to build a new heaven
With no more return

Eyes wide open
We'll find the way
To the unknown

We're looking for
Somewhere to start over
Over again

To the star that glows
Shining light exposed
From an Earth we won't live again

My journey's turning into
What will divide us forever
In this fairy world
We'll live to build a new heaven
With no more return

My journey's turning into
What will divide us forever
In this fairy world
We'll live to build
A new heaven
We'll build this
Universe
