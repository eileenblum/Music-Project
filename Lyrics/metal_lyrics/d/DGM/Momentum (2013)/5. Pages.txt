Sometimes there's only
One helping hand inside those nights
A song to sing, a page to write
And I can't let it go

Not Me! Not You!

Can't fight the demons in my head
Not Me! Not You!

The devil and me, just the only "Us" I live!

I can barely let it flow
No reason in falling
A reason to be
Is more than a feeling
Bring it on 'till it's over

To Write down this rhyme is
The only way I know to heal my pain
A rhythm beats, my heart's on fire
I can't let it go

Not Me! Not You!

Can't fight the demons in my head
Not Me! Not You!

The devil and me
Just the only "Us" I live!

I can barely let it flow
No reason in falling
A reason to be
Is more than a feeling
Bring it on 'till it's over

Bring peace within me soothing the fears
Playing neverending music
Is what I want

There's noway to run
I can barely let it flow
No reason in falling
A reason to be
Is more than a feeling

Bring it on 'till the end
