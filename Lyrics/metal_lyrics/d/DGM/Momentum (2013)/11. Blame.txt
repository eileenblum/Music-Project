Stop Breathing
All I want are empty spaces around

Lost memories seem so real
Much as never before
(I'm) Still living in a silly dream
I will do it more than I probably want to show

No Matter what I'll do
I Cannot trust again
I Cannot bring this pain
Blame on me if I miss the answers
Can't you see there are no more questions
Take me just as I need to be!

If it's a joke, they're breaking down
The house of hopes I've built for you
They're trying to bring it down
I can't stand them more
More than ever

No Matter what I'll do
I Cannot trust again
I Cannot bring this pain
Blame on me if I miss the answers
Can't you see there are no more questions
Take me just as I need to be!

I'm losing faith and I cannot talk to you
Remember what I said:

"No matter what
I'll bring the cross
Just close your eyes, embrace me,

(And) everything you wanted
To be you'll be again"

No Matter what I'll do
I Cannot trust again
I Cannot bring this pain
Blame on me if I miss the answers
Can't you see there are no more questions
Take me just as I need to be!
