Don't wanna lose
Is there a time
To second chances?
Staring my eyes on it
I Just can't see
Why you're just so numb

Can't fight, cannot try
Lying underneath my skin
Twisting all over me
The need to be
The right man in this empty being

You're still the one I want

I Need to know
Please remember when
Your feelings were
Close to mine
A little emotion
A treasure in a land of pain

If I would chose
Out there a lifetime
With a sense
No time for hesitate
No silence to hate
Always where we need to be

You're still the one I want

I Need to know
Please remember when
Your feelings were close to mine
A little emotion
A treasure in a land of pain

I Need to know
Please remember when
Your feelings were
Close to mine
A little emotion
A treasure in a land of pain
