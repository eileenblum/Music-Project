Struggling with my inner thoughts
Is it worth or it means nothing?
Should i run the distance between both?

The answers set my soul on fire
A weight I can't bear anymore

If I'd still recall those feelings forgotten
It's all I could do again
To find my way, to find it, find it

And time won't answer the questions
(questions left)
Search for it somewhere else
Blindly believe then is all I can do
I'm filling the void this life puts me through
Filling the void

Hard to pretend a simple life
I've been told to transcend, I will always
Remember or shall I rely on my pure desire to
To find out the reason to live this way

If I'd still recall
Those feelings forgotten
It's all I could do to find
To find my way, to find it, find it

And time won't answer the questions
(questions left)
Search for it somewhere else
Blindly believe then is all I can do
I'm filling the void this life puts me through
Feel the void

To find my way, to find it, find it

And time won't answer the questions
(questions left)
Search for it somewhere else
Blindly believe then is all I can do
I'm filling the void this life puts me through
I'm filling the void!
