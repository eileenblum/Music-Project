A mental abuse trapped in a brain jail
Got to get out of here

It's my destiny(to) appear and not to be
I'm not done

I can be the only one who trust
I'm not afraid

If no one else believe in this time I want

To bring it down to the limit
Feel the wave and move on

Losing control just to be myself
Dark side that I'm crawling into
(My) chaos has born
I need to make it true

The deepest regret is pushing my headache
To a never ending blast

My wounds to relieve with a fury released
I'm not done

If I will be the only one, I'm not afraid
If you deceive me I will rise
These feelings are suffocated
Scream loud and move on, yeah

Losing control just to be myself
Dark side that I'm crawling into
(My) chaos has born
I need to make it true

One day I'll be free

One day I'll try to spit out

This foolish self-control

My mind will fall from ashes reborn

Losing control just to be myself
Dark side that I'm crawling into
(My) chaos has born
I need to make it true
