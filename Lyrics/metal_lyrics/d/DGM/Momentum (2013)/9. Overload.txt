Sometimes my feelings
Fill the rivers of my mind

My darkest desires

Light my soul and make me lose control

These thorns slowly
Bring me down
Slave to my greed
And I feel that it hurts

In my heart I am burning with anger
I need to refine the walk of my life
Emotional overload torns my soul
Let me be with you, now I can be with you

One day your feelings
Will bring peace
Inside my heart

You cannot divide us
I will always be a part of you

These thorns slowly bring me down
Slave to my greed
I'm falling apart

In my heart I am burning with anger
I need to refine the walk of my life
Emotional overload torns my soul
Let me be with you
Now I can be with you

Now that I've been forgotten
I'm drained of emotions
Dead and gone
A drop in the ocean

In my heart I am burning with anger
I need to refine the walk of my life
Emotional overload torns my soul
Let me be with you
Now I can be with you
