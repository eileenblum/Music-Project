Sensation feels so real this time it's true
No more fear the debating is over!
No more words, no more words for you
No more tears, the waiting is over

I can't be there 'cause I run out of energy
If you could only see
Trying my best to convince you that
I don't mind

There's nowhere to run
Reason is calling
No more pretending
This time it's coming the end
Coming the end

I've been given too much warnings
And I bled without control
Word's often cruel we're listening no more

I can't be there 'cause I run out of energy
If you could only see
Trying my best to convince you that
I don't mind

There's nowhere to run
Reason is calling
No more pretending
My time is coming and now

Trying to remember
If there's a "when" or if there is a "why"
Maybe you should try to remember
Maybe I should try, just give it a try, c'mon!

...nowhere to run
Reason is calling
No more pretending
This time, this time it comes to an end
A time is coming
Reason is calling me
No more pretending
This time it's coming the end
