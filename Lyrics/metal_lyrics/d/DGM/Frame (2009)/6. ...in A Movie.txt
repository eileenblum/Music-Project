[Music: Mularoni, Basile, Lyrics: Basile]

I can't remember what I am
Living a time with no tomorrow
You can't be there when I need to love
My heart is just a forgotten place

Everything you have to learn about me
Smiling face hides a place
Where I become an empty man's shape

I feel so strange
(Walking the street of nowhere)
I can be everything you dream of
(I'm feeling)
But you should believe me
I'm trapped in a movie my friend

You still remember what you are
Living a time with no hesitations
You can't be there when I need to love
Your heart is still a forgotten place

I can't be wrong
I'm feeling the blues
You cannot divide what you see
From what I am
