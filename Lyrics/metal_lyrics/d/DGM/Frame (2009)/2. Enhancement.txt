[Music: Mularoni, Basile, Lyrics: Mularoni]

I need something new
To break out these chains
Brand new horizons to unfold

Never look back at my faults
You can't deny my actions
Tryin' to believe in you again, I'm not afraid

I need for someone
To change my life
Inside my head
It's time to be better for me
Calling out and screaming for your help

My feelings' so strong
I cannot feel alright
Without getting better
And I think that's all I need is only you
Every time I failed
He was there to catch me
Even if you were away
Thousand miles away from me
