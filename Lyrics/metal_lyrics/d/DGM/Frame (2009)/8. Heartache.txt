[Music: Mularoni, Basile, Lyrics: Basile, Costantino]

It's chasing me. I don't know
Something that must fill the void inside me.
Will there be a place for me in your life?
Will I be a part of it?
Make this dream come true.
It's everything I need

I need to know that
A meaningless desire
Is what I do believe in
Heartache I feel
As time will tell if I'm the one
If I am the one

An existence with some regrets
An empty room with no light in
You're digging within me
Feelin' naked as reborn
I'm torn and bleeding
If you believe me, son
You're everything I need
