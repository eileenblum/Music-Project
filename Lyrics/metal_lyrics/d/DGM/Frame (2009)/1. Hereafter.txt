[Music: Mularoni, Basile, Lyrics: Basile]

Outside a dream
Through the abyss of time
Close to the flames
We are burning desires
Edge of a universe

No time to lose
Coz' everywhere there's a chance to win

Hereafter we will stand
As a flight of an angel
In the eyes of a stranger
We'll bring back every soul
The land of devotion
This time will be more then words

We're gone with the sin
We are burning desires
Flames in our souls
We have the devil's eyes
But we look like the angels
Shaken by the faith into the instinct

Losing faith
Desecrating trust
And breaking truth
Into this place we can spread our feelings
Free to say no! Free to believe in ourselves

A time with no more words
