[Music: Mularoni, Basile, Lyrics: Basile]

No regret is running through my face
Everything is okay
No one here wants let me say: "I trust in you."
You can buy nice things to cover you
Shit is still outta here
Can you give yourself another chance to live your life?

But I have to learn before I forget it
I can't burn an empty fire

You need me I won't look back
And crawling down, babe
You feel me
And I need much strength
To let you go away

Now I feel the world around me again
Everything is okay
No one here wants let you say: "I love on you"
You can't buy myself
With an empty dream
Can you try to give yourself a chance to really love?

You feel a stranger
You need salvation
You feel a stranger
You need my passion

You're feeding the way from me and cry
