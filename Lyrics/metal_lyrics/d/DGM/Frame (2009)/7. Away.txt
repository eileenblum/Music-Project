[Music: Mularoni, Basile, Lyrics: Basile]

Have you search for someone?
Have you got just one day
With no wasted promises?
Can you live without them?

I don't pretend to be
A man that I don't want to be
Feelings that money can buy
This is not what I need

A land still far from abuses
I can't believe in something more
A breakaway just one day
I know this is my own way

You call yourself a winner
You're only a social climber
I won't waste my time again
With your dirty money

Away from here
I'll give it up just one day
From a burning fire
I'll be back one more day

A man still far from abuses
I can't believe in something more
A breakaway just one day
And let the music find the way
