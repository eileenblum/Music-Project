[Music: Mularoni, Basile, Lyrics: Basile, Arcangeli]

Searching your dreams
It's all about yourself
You can be the number one
Sometimes you feel used
And everything you need
Is to be the only one

This is a part of us
We can feel complete
Now I know

You feel in love with
You're breathing life again
This brand new blood
Can beat so strong
And make me remember
What I've done

Fighting to bring
Peace inside your mind
You will be the number one!
Against my own tears
Climbing these fears
I can be the only one
