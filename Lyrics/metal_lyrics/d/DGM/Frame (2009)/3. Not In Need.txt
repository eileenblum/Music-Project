[Music: Mularoni, Basile, Lyrics: Mularoni]

They can call us freaks
Or every label they have learned
Branding us again

And no one
Is different as it seems
It's time to change

We can live without your rules and lies
We can live without your absence of desires

We're living justifying our beliefs
We're always not in need
of what they're trying to fulfill
How can they always be so greedy
It's time to understand

Living on the edge
As corners of society
Out of bounds again

And this time
They can't forsake the truth
"...They can't forsake..."

Not a hope to going on this way, no
Not hope to live with the absence of desires
