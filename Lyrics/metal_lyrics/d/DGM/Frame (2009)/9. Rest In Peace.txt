[Music: Mularoni, Basile, Lyrics: Basile, Arcangeli]

I can't look back
I don't know what should be
I'm waiting
I'm out of breath

Listen
Things are not so clear
Believe me this is
The only way to die

Time to be a human being
Has passed through this life
So rest in peace my friend
I only feel so fearless now
I have to trust me

I can see through
Every single tear
It's just my past
And it feels so clear

Memories
Things are right enough
This is my time to
Understand the meaning

Peace can be the only way to
Face my past today
I rest in peace my friend
Now I feel my peace of mind
