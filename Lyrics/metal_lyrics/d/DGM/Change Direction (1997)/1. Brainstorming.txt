Silences of the grave are coming in my room
far noise beyond the door witness of my sorrow
This is my destiny perpetuaI in my mind
can you feel the energy? I can't show you it now

Time, I need my time. Time, I need my time

I can see now after my blindness

Why you can't see They're making fun of you?
I was the slave of the darkness,  why don't you see?
You never see me again

Day after day, I'm feeling down
so I cry in my darkest night, hoping I survive
but there is no survival for me,and there is no escape for you
what I feel it's only fear but there's nothing I can do

I can see now after my blindness

Why you can't see They're making fun of you?
I was the slave of the darkness, why don't you see?
You never see me again
