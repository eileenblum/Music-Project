No tirne and nothing around I was the one who survived
and all I could see was only the black of the sky
Memories came back while tears fell down hate grew up into my heart
but I was alone with no enemy to fight
Then I fall asleep and in my dreams I saw the meaning of my life ... of the 
life

Damnation or salvation
from everlasting hellfire?
Around me a bad wind of sorrow is rising but I'm not afraid
There is not more future and there was no past
the present I'm living might be the last

Be free young man and leave the money
Be free young man and save your days

Raise your mind as far as 99th floor and elevate yourself over human thought

Tonight give me one more reason to sleep with better dreams
Tonight give me one more reason to stay with me
Shadows of the sky walk into my nightmares falling down by a light above
crying for their vengeance
a scream from the oceans went through me to the bones
but now I feel so strong 'cause I know what you have done

Damnation or salvation
from everlasting hellfire?
Around me a bad wind of sorrow is rising but I'm not afraid

There is not more future and there was no past
the present I'm living might be the last

... might be the last
