An old man, just and old man, "K" for the friends
An old man, just an old man, shine on my way

Too young to know everything
too young for every traps of thoughts
Dark nights in my soul
too young for you to know

Many women, old and young women
and all the stuff that you know
things will change direction
Dark days in my soul
too young for every trap of thoughts
... for every traps og thoughts
things will change direction

There's no more time for sorrow
there's no more reason for your pain
You take your life for another day
waiting for the last caress ... the last caress

Many women, old and young women
and all the stuff that you know
things will change direction
How many lies I have to pay in this life
I don't need you come back
'cause things will change direction

The monkey you have on your back
now it is gone .. now it is gone

Many women, old and young women
and all the stuff that you know
things will change direction
How many lies I have to pay in this life
I don't need your caress

Things will change direction

...  cause things must change direction
... things must change direction
