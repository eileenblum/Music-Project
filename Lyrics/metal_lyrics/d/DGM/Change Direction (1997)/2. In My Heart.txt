Enter night in my life so pale, an empty black that stuffs all my days
Soul so alone, so sad in this place, with the mind I skim your face

In my room thinking about something, spreading to the ...
... wind all my thoughts are so hungry (of you)

Calling all my sensations, Hours are so slow

Reflecting through your eyes, I remember this time
A candle is burning me, so fast in my heart

When the lights fall down, no more any noises and ...
... sounds of my heart are surrounded (of you)

Calling all my sensations,

Reflecting through your eyes, I remember this time
A candle is burning me so fast in my heart

Reflecting through your eyes, I remember this time
A candle is burning me so fast in my heart
