Days and days waitin' something happened
empty eyes and empty soul
grey sky, dark nights
all my energy goes .. all my energy goes

I'm alone in this lonely night ... like a star without light

The only way to get out of here is looking at this thing without fear
the only way to get out my God is waitin' an answer without love

Slowly, slowly in the silence lonely days in my hands
looking inside at the storm of the soul that reveals the center and the dark 
is gone

You never heard me when I creied for your immense eyes
nobody seems to know the circle of fire - you gave to me

I believe in everythin you said to me the faith is gone and the help is in 
the opposite

The only hope that ou come here makes me feel without fear such a good time 
that we had
I hope the light is flashin' my death

The only way to get out of here is looking at this thing without fear the 
only way to get out my God
is waitin' an answer without love I want to see into your eyes
I want to see what burns inside only your love can take me away
Believe me, don't go far away

You never heard me when I cried for your immense eyes
nobody seems to know the circle of fire - you gave to me

You never heard me when I creied for your immense eyes
nobody seems to know the circle of fire - you gave to me

You never hear me ...
