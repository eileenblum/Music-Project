All my life in dirty chains
all my days hopin' you remain

Like the life that we all live
with the brians we can't control

In the bottom of darkness you are
Try to find a solution that is not coming
Rise up and find a friend
Alesteir Crowley, Rabelais, Gargantua

I want that you do what you want
do what you want, so you can be
I want that you do what you want
do what you want, so you can be
Cut away your head, because
all the thoughts, that you have, are wrong
When your brain is very clean
a new flower there can grow

In the bottom of darkness you are
Try to find a solution that is not coming
Rise up and find a friend
Alesteir Crowley, Schopenhauer, Krisnamurti

I want that you do what you want
do what you want, so you can be
I want that you do what you want
do what you want, so you can be
Alesteir Crowley, Rabelais, Gargantua

I want that you do what you want
do what you want, so you can be
I want that you do what you want
do what you want, so you can be
So you can be .. you can be
