You stupid little woman, try to listen to me
You stupid little woman,  you betrayed me ...

I've tried to give you all my best - and I'm not an angel
I've tried to give you all my soul - and you know what I mean

Oh lady, I want to know ...you bitches are all the same, you are flesh to 
sell
oh my God, I'm so disappointed - oh my God, I'm so angry

Try to understand a man like me

Somewhere in time of my life, I'll see you again
waiting for the night
Somewhere in time of my life, I'll see you again
waiting for the night

You stupid fuckin' woman, I would like to tell you that ...
You are a little woman - I'm so confused
You really don't remember how much I love you
I would like to take your littlehead - and twist ...

Lady, I like to know, how can be possible? How must be insane?You .. you are 
guilty
I ... I am so stupid ... so stupid

Try to understand a man like me

Somewhere in time of my life, I'll see you again
waiting for the night
Somewhere in time of my life, I'll see you again
waiting for the night

The fear is follown'us - the jealousy is eatin' us the mouth is horrible, 
it's my nightmare ...

What is love? What is love?Try to understand what is eal love
is not jealousy, is not anger, is not fear not attachment at all

You stupid little woman, try to listen to me You stupid little woman,  you 
betrayed me ...

Oh lady, I want to know ... you bitches are all the same, you are flesh to 
sell
oh my God, I'm so disappointed - oh my God, I'm so angry I'm so angry ... 
angry

It's your last game!
