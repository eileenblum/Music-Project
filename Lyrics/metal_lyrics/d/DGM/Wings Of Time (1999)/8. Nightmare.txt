I was seeing him in the night
I tried to visit this vision
At the last I went in his dreams
I was there very clearly

Very clear I saw everything he was seeing
Very clear I knew everything he was feelin'

The back of woman I could see
An evil smell killed my breath
Oh, she stunk like the beast
I needed fresh air...I needed air

I felt a pang in my throat and I was so in confusion
Looking for a way to go real blend with illusion

A light wind came into my dark room
And I felt a sense of surrender
The light of the sun came into my eyes
And my mind became so still...
...in the nightmare
...in the nightmare

Big confusion in my thoughts
nightmare changed around me
No voices and no sounds
faded colours surrounded me
