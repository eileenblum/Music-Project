When I went away I saw
How much I needed your smile
Could you give to my heart
Some more of your eyes?
I would meet you again
To stop my tears and pain
And have another day
To say the things
I've never said.

In any case you'll see
this thought so deep into me
in any case  I'm falling in love with you

If I close my eyes your face
goes on flowing my mind
and your glance bewitches me like a child
what a big surprise if I could awake this night
and find out the dream
still wraps me out 'n' inside
