The streets are wet and the colours die
My soul goes down into these grey clouds
Crying for nothing

The end, is running to me through my veins
Let me fight, let me show them what I am
It's now or never
It's now or never

I've got the glory in my hands
But I'm still cryin'
I'm searching for the name of love
I know the mystery of the sky
I keep my desire
I'm waiting for the sunrise

I heard the people have to die
Who said this words? Who said this lie?
Without expectation

A man who changed this rule is the sign
Like the sun, after the storm here he will come back
To be forever
To be forever

To be forever
