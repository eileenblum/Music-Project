Who sais that you must be a worker?
Who wants that you become blind?
Stop the insane business
Take a break and change your mind

Downstair they are workin'
All the days spent without hope
They are screamin' and cryin'
But they don't seems from...outside

Oooh...oooh... they don't seems from...outside
Oooh...oooh... they don't seems from...outside

Why do you wanna lose your freedom?
Who wants to become blind?
Stop all this sense of nothing
Take and master and change your life

Don't stop the fancy
And your dreams to fly free, without chains
You need to have a wildness
Leave it so, go out of mind

Oooh...oooh...you have to look the other side
Oooh...to change the other side

Oooh...oooh...you have to look the other side
Oooh...to change the other side
