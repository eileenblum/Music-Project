Black shadows in the wind
Are runnig through an evil scream
Destroying my tears in the darkness
Another me another you
Across a dream flying on  wings of time
And I can see the reason of our life
In everything that I can feel there's you and me

For every dream that I'm dreaming
Looking at your life don't let me down
For every night I'll dream of you
Dark fear follows me into the eyes
Of destiny- eager for thoughts in my mind
All I can see inside of me is your life
I'm so confused, no time to lose
...waiting for...

Lost in my hands, escape from my desire....
