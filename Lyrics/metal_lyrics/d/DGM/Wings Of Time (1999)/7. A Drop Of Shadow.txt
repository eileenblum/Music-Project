Lights are fading around me
Nothingness is inside me
I'm dragged in the darkness...
A cool shiver is running through my skin

The shadows of my fear
Are waisting my mind
I'd like to be now
A sound so light that's piercing the wind

Only I know myself now
With my mind I would see
Another life to live

In myself I wanna break all this silence
And find the keys that permit me to live
All that I have not tasted till the end
And see all the colours I've never seen

Now my life is a fire
It's burning in my breast
New strenghts are raising...
A voice in my heart is whispering one breath

Once my friend...

"Life is only a game"

So now...I play it

On myself I bet all my hidden anger
A rage so hard like the rust of the time
I need to change all the things I deteste
And feel all I've never felt
