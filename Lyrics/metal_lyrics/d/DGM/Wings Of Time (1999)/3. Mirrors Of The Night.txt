I've seen all my destiny
Wrecked in the sea of madness
Screaming out the name of god
Victim of your  lies and your wasted tears
I'm held captured by my fear
Lost in my myself waiting for a 7th sign

Reflecting into your eyes
escaping from my obsession
I still remember the promise you made

Returning through the light
light of emotions
as you can see I'll rise again

I spent my life to dream
in the mirrors of the night
and day falling down from you
eternal spell now it's broken down
passing through the void of you
can you feel I'll never die
