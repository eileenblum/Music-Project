[feat. Tom Englund of Evergrey]There's no way I can blame you
I can see what is wrong with me
While I curse all the liars
Put me down and neglect me

Let me drawn and leave me
All we behold will not be real
There's no way I can blame you
And I can't see what is wrong with me

Holding on
Crossing the oceans
Crave this heart of mine
Relieve it with sorrow
Crossing the oceans [3x]
I can feel it

Lost in time
Make me rise
Feed me
Stay with me
Just no one will fear you
And I can be anything I am
Leaning onto your claim

Waterfall will continue
Hiding ghost of insanity
Since my cross is on fire
Let my crime neglected

Take my crown and leave me
As all we behold will be unreal
The dawn is on fire

Holding on
Crossing the oceans
Crave this heart of mine
Believe in tomorrow
Crossing the oceans [3x]

Lost in time
Make me rise
Feed me
Stay with me
Just no one will fear you
And I can be anything I am
Leaning onto your claim

Lose control
Redeemed existence
Waking up with no resistance
I don't know what I am
If you could only afford the truth in grey surrender
Fading with all the fools like me

Lost in time
Make me rise
Feed me
Stay with me
Just no one will fear you
And I can be anything I am
Leaning onto your claim
