Bless what I've been
Even if I saw through
What you can't believe in

It's just my higher will to rise
What has pushed me out
From a world of darkest feelings

I am overflow
And I can't deny it all
There is nothing more to complain
Not this time, no one can see

I should be fallen
There's no peace inside my head
(and) you came undone

I should be fallen
And I don't know why
Crossing the bound of our souls
We keep falling down

That was my sin
Hard for me to know
What has to be given

Another side of me will rise
And I won't live without (it)
Nothing's left to be forgiven

I am so wrong
And I can't keep flying low
There is nothing more to complain
Not this time, no not again

I should be fallen
There's no peace inside my head
(and) you came undone

I should be fallen
And I don't know why
Crossing the bound of our souls
We keep falling down

Well bless my soul
Believe in everything I'm not
Don't fear the meaning, no
Rest with me in my soul

Fallen
There's no peace inside my head
(and) you came undone

I should be fallen
And I don't know why
Crossing the bound of our souls
We keep falling down
