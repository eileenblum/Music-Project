Eyes open wide
My soul is torn apart
There's something that you should know
I hid it from the start

Don't judge me from the things I've done
What you have become is not what I had planned

We have been so blind
Trusting each other
A passage intertwined
With dimensions never told

Where do we learn to lie to ourselves?
It's tied in with self-esteem
Misled by what we see

Deception from the trustful eyes
Together as one
A call for humanity

We have been so blind
Trusting each other
A passage intertwined
With dimensions never told

Are we going to change?
Or we'll live in the same way?
There's more than everything you know
Believe what I say
We'll have to fight forevermore
Trying not to implode

We have been so blind
Trusting each other
A passage intertwined
With dimensions never told
With elements untold
