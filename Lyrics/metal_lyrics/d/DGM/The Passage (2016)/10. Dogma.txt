Wake up from this wicked dream
Golden lies for hypocrites
Relieving for the damned

Fake world of nonsense, souls to be taken
A pantomime for human race
A brain dance

Silence deep inside
Hiding from yourself
Won't leave it behind

Silent beholder
Faith of our life is on our shoulders

Numb is the game that we play
Stuck in apart
But we can't surrender
Oh, suddenly peace will come
Blowing dark shadows away

Bleeding symbols of belief
Holy lines for blinded eyes
Redemption is for rent

Merchants of disgrace, white and greedy saviors
Bended minds to idol's will for which no one cares

Silence deep inside
Waiting the breakthrough of a new sunrise

Madness is over
Fear and demise will be forsaken

Numb is the game that we play
Stuck in apart
But we can't surrender
Oh suddenly peace will come
Blowing dark shadows away
