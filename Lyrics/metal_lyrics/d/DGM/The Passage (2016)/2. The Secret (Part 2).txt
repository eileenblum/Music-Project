Voices of cheer
Calling from deep inside
Finding me helpless inside your brain
I should believe in hope
No one can save me from myself
No more fears
Thunders of peace in my head

Grown for gears in idle heart
A war of mistaken gods of stone
Riddles and rhymes
Found in the meaning of a spell
