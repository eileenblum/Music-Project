I walk alone inside your feelings
Fixing the crack across your heart
The falling of the soul
Looking down my side is black
I don't know, we just will be too far (no, no)

You heal me
I need you more than that
In my mind I'll be the dark you'll be the light
I believe the secret that we hide
It glows inside my heart
You know my fear is gone

When you know
There's no other ending
When you know the way
And if my broken soul
Finds another path to the lonely shore
Where lies the secret

I don't know and I don't need it
If you can see it in my eyes
Beneath the dark
Breathe my pride outside my fate
Why go on, we'll just believe it's fine (no, no)

No bleeding
And no tears to cover that
It's a crime I need a reason to confess
I release the secret that we hide
It grows inside my heart
You know my fears are gone

When you know
There's no other ending
When you know the way
And if my broken soul
Finds another path to the lonely shore
Where lies the secret

After all I don't know why you came undone
Stand apart on the deepest side of hope
Ever broken glass filled again, red wine and rain
It all sounds quite hard, so why would you trust me so far?
Something that I don't care
I need to dare
I'd win our fight today

When you know (when you know)
When you know the way (there's no other ending)
And if my broken soul
Finds another path to reach my goal
Where lies the secret

And nothing needs a reason
