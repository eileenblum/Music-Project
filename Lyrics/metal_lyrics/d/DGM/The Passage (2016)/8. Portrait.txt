Every time you point your eyes on me
I own you
You stand still
In this game you'll be my pawn

For you, now's the time for you to know
Fear my greed your blind faith is running low

Hope for bliss but now
Who is going to die it's you

I don't know why you stare at me
Carrying my heart in you
Everything's how it used to be
'Cause you'll be cold-hearted

Present time, an empty space for me
I'll be you 
You won't live
One of us will fall apart

And you, you won't try to break my spell
And blame me, with a cross upon my heart

Hope for bliss but now
There will be an end for you

I don't know why you stare at me
Carrying my life through you
So brave and high your eyes on me
'Cause you'll be cold-hearted

I don't know why you still believe
You're no more part of my soul
This is not my reality
You're driving me insane

I don't know why you stare at me
Carrying my heart in you
So brave and high your eyes on me
'Cause you'll be cold-hearted
