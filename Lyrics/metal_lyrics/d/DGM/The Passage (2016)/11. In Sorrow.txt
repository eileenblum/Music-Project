I want you to know
I'm not in my safe place
'Cause I loved you more than ever
But you hurt me so much

I need something to write down this pain
And I'm feeling sorry
Won't you stay all night?

I ain't leaving without you
There is no way to choose
I can't breathe when I look at you
If there's nothing in you

We'll leave in this house
Guilt and offenses
"Take your hands off that picture! Are you just shameless?"

And I feel sorry
Can't you stay all night?

I ain't leaving without you
There is no way to choose
I can't breathe when I look at you
If there's nothing in you
