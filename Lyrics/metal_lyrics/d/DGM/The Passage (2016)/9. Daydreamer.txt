Made my livin', day by day
Felt my heartbeat, fed my soul
Tried not to lose control down that river
Not planning route
And forever I will wander

Right until the end

The peace I'm seeking
Within myself
I'll seize the day and come alive as payback
I'll keep on breathing
I'm here to stay!
I can't hide between the lines
I'll try to make it clear

I'm starting to realize...

Suddenly closer, I won't surrender, if it's the destiny that's tearing me apart

Lost in my deepest regrets
No more desire
No flame lights the fire
Just do remember, (it's) out of control
Hold on 'till it's over or losing it all

I'm a daydreamer but I closed my eyes
I raise the bar
These are my scars
(I) won't come back where you are
A fate deceiver, back in line
I'll take the time to feel alive
And realize It's true

I'm starting to realize...

Dreamin' is over, time to surrender, if it's the destiny that's tearing me apart
Lost in my deepest regrets
No more desire
No flame lights the fire
Just do remember, (it's) out of control
Hold on 'till it's over or losing it all
