Locked with my crown till it's over
Going down with my greed and my pain
Just a look at my heart can resolve it
I can't keep the secret, let me go

I would not say what the truth's about it
Even if I knew it
Fish your dime from down the wishing well
Don't try to resist me
And deny I'm miserable again
Hell yes I know

When no more tears will tear apart
And no longer haze will blur my sight
Heard that the wise
Tried to believe in someone else

Look now the black king is older
Going down with his greed and his pain
But a look at my heart can resolve it
I can't keep the secret, let me go

I'm gonna find the waiting is over
No beginning and not an end
Even if my aim is shown
Well I'm not holding on till the end

Locked with my crown till it's over
Going down with my greed and my pain
Just a look at my heart can resolve it
I can't keep the secret, let me go

I do know my way
Got my wings I'll spread them wide
Flying high
On and on and on, over lands of darkest feelings
Shades among the walls until the light will come

Then you will call my heart of drunk
My heart of lies
Growing fierce
I can't wait anymore

Animal
The roaring side of nothing
Haunted by the silence of your words
Animal
It's something meant to be
And I can't give it up

Life's a chasing game
A rumble in disguise
Like flying on a desert
On and on and on, with the spirit of a roamer
Gleams among the walls until the night will come

Then you will show your heart of drunk
Your heart of lies
Running free, it shall be evermore

Animal
The roaring side of nothing
Hunted by the silence of your words
Cannibal
A monster set to feast
As I can't give it up

Animal
The roaring side of nothing
Hunted by the silence of your words
An animal
It's something meant to be
And I can't give it up
