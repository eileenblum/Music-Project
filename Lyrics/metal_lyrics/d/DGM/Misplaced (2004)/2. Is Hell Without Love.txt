STAND ON THE EDGE OF THE PARADISE I'M LOOKING DOWNFLAMES OF THE HELL GROWIN'UP FROM THE SEVEN SINSDEMONS ARE CALLING MY NAME IT'S SO REAL I'M FEELING TIRED AND LONELYI'M RUNNING OUT AND FALLINGMY BLOOD STILL PUMPING INTO MY VEINS I'LL GIVE THE LIGHT AND GO ONAND THROUGH THE NIGHT I WILL REACH FROM THE SKYAND NOW I KNOW LIFE COULD BE STRONG WITHOUT LOVE PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE TOO CLOSE TO EXPLORE MY FUCKIN' MINDRISING FROM THE DEEP OF MY SOPUL FROM THE GRACE OF MY LOVEANGELS ARE CALLING MY NAME AND ISN'T REAL I'M FEELING TIRED AND LONELYI'M RUNNING OUT AND FALLINGMY BLOOD STILL PUMPING INTO MY VEINS I'LL GIVE THE LIGHT AND GO ONAND THROUGH THE NIGHT I WILL REACH FROM THE SKYAND NOW I KNOW LIFE COULD BE STRONG WITHOUT LOVE
