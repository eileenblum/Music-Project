OPEN YOUR HEART
THERE'S A FEELING IN THE AIR
IN EVERYTHING'S THAT I DO
LET ME SEE I CAN FACE THE TRUTH

OPEN YOUR MIND IS NOW OR NEVER
STARTIN' TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE
LOOKING FOR LOVE WE WILL RISE
TO KEEP WHAT I NEED

I KNOW THAT YOU LET ME DOWN
BUT KNOW I CAN SEE

I FALL ASLEEP INTO MY DREAM
I'LL FIND A REASON TO BELIEVE
I CANNOT SEE BUT TROUGH MY TEARS
I'LL FIND A REASON.....

EVERYTHING'S I'M FEELING IT'S NOT WHAT I NEED
BUT I'M DREAMING AWAY
ALL I WANT IT'S ONLY YOUR LOVE THAT I FEEL
IN THE AIR

I KNOW THAT YOU LET ME DOWN
BUT NOW I CAN SEE

I'M STARTING TO REALIZE COME INTO MY REALITY
(TAKE MY HAND TONIGHT)

I FALL ASLEEP INTO MY DREAM
I'LL FIND A REASON TO BELIEVE
I CANNOT SEE BUT TROUGH MY TEARS
I'LL FIND A REASON.....
