EVERYTIME I'LL BE WAIT FOR SO LONGTHE VOICE OF MY HEART STILL CRYIN'STAY WITH ME FOR THE REST OF THE DAYS OF MY LIFE I'LL MUST BE STRONG EVERYDAY AND NIGHTALONE IN THIS FALLING TIMEFACIN THE TRUTH I WILL RISE FROM THE GRAVE OF YOUR LIES I'M NOT AFRAID, YOU'RE MY GUIDING LIGHT THAT'S SHINE ON MY WAY FEELIN' LOVE THROUGH MY DESPERATE PAINNOTHING LAST FOREVERNOW THAT I KNOW WHAT I FELT I'M READY FOR I'M NOT AFRAID, YOU'RE MY GUIDING LIGHT THAT'S SHINING ON MY WAY WAIT FOR THE END OF THE NIGHTKEEP YOUR DEEPEST DESIRELEAVE IN THIS WORLD WHAT WE KNOW I'M STARTING TO FLY AWAY ACROSS THE DESERT NO MOUNTAIN TO CLIMBI'LL SURVIVE ENOUGH TO SEEMY LIFE IN PEACE WITH MY DESTINY MY PRIDE WILL NEVER END UP IN CHAINSNO MATTER WHERE I'M GOINGTRUS IN MYSELF I WILL RISE FROM THE GRAVE OF YOUR LIES I'M NOT AFRAID, YOU'RE MY GUIDING LIGHT THAT'S SHINING ON MY WAY
