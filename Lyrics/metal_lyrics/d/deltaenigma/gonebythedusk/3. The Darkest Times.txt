Hours turned those days into years,
but still my sorrows feel the same
No escape
Not today

I have lost myself in the deepest hell
I have lost myself

Silence, solitude and the constant feel of breathing
only lies that won't die
Not tonight

I have lost myself in the deepest hell
I have lost myself

When the world comes crashing down and there's no one else around
only dreams will keep you alive through the darkest times
Will the morning ever come?
I grow colder all the time
Are we meant to walk alone to the great unknown?

I have lost myself and this darkness never ends
I have lost myself

When the world comes crashing down and there's no one else around
only dreams will keep you alive through the darkest times
Will the morning ever come?
I grow colder all the time
Are we meant to walk alone to the great unknown?

The frozen eyes
Moment in the snowfall
Life left behind
Eternal gloom entwined

The frozen sky
Moment in desolation
Distant past divine
Tomorrow undefined

When the world comes crashing down and there's no one else around
only dreams will keep you alive through the darkest times
Will the morning ever come?
I grow colder all the time
Are we meant to walk alone to the great unknown?
