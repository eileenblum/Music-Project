You destroyed my hope for a better day
How could an angel like you do this to me?
I cannot turn back, neither can I go on
I have lost it all

Sometimes I wonder why I rewind those moments of our lives
I shouldn't remember
Why can't I forget?

Turn yourself away from the world
Shards of the broken soul ripped your heart wide open
It hurts, it hurts, god it hurts

Oh so sweet and brief is love before it kills
Love's a deadly sting
Heartache killed my heart and if that is what you wanted,
bring me the end

Why do we lose ourselves?
Why do we shutdown from the world, world?
In the moment of mourning,
where do we disappear?
Where do we disappear?
My fear, sincere

Keep your mind away from the past
It is something that you cannot withstand
You need to wake up
and depart, depart, depart

Oh so sweet and brief is love before it kills
Love's a deadly sting
Heartache killed my heart and if that is what you wanted,
bring me the end

I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted, I'm addicted
I'm addicted, I'm addicted to loneliness
I'm so fuckin' addicted

Oh you're not alone with your feelings dying in the dark
And you will find a way to make yourself whole again

Heartache killed my heart, and if that is what you wanted
bring me the end
