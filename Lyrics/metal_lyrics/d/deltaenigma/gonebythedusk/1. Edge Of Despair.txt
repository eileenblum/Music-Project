I have seen my world burn
and in the flames of love I saw you burning too
The scorch of the yearning
and the final touch, remains of love

I offered you my heart and soul for love
(for love that we used to have)
There's nothing left undone to remind of who we are
We never change

All we used to be... buried underneath every fallen tear at the edge of despair
You're the brightest day
One with the autumn's sway that'll take you away, away

I must face my demons through this downcast life, all the time
And there's not a single reason why I should save myself from this dismal fate

Together in this grief we try to hold our tears
(we grow apart, we've lost our love)
It breaks my heart to think we gave our everything
Guess we're not okay

All we used to be... buried underneath every fallen tear at the edge of despair
You're the brightest day
One with the autumn's sway that'll take you away

Gone by the dusk
(gone by the dusk)
You're one with the fall
I never knew
(I never knew)
that it feels so cold to be alone in this world

All we used to be... buried underneath...

All we used to be, buried underneath every fallen tear at the edge of despair
You're the brightest day
One with the autumn's sway that'll take you away, away
It'll take you away

Away from the edge of despair
Despair
