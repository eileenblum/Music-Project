Before my eyes a sudden drop to love but I don't want to stop
my heart from breaking again

The first, the last
Crazy and sad how we still need love to keep us warm
We need that warmth
I feel reborn

Another day
A different way to view this world so steep and grey
It's a perfect day
That rusty gate to a mellow feel
Forget the past that never healed
It will never heal

Oh the way you smile with your eyes
Let me love and try
I won't break your heart

Cherish the one
Let emotions play
You were there and the pain just went away
It was a perfect day
I recall that day and how you said
that you would never let yourself forget that I was there too

Oh the way you smile with your eyes
Let me love and try
I won't break your heart
All those things you fear will disappear
Oh just watch me love
I won't break your heart

And everything I do, I do for you my darling
Everything I do, I do for you

All those things you fear will disappear
Oh just watch me love
I won't break your heart

Oh the way you smile with your eyes
Let me love and try
I won't break your heart
All those things you fear will disappear
Oh just watch me love
I won't break your heart
