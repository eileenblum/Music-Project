I have seen your birth
I will see your death
A dream that haunts you until the end

I have seen your rise
You will see your fall âcause you want all or nothing at all

Your world (world) ainât gonna be the same
They have sold your soul for fortune and fame
Duplicate yourself to stay in the game
'Cause theyâll steal your life for money and shame

Your world (world) ainât gonna be the same
They have sold your soul for fortune and fame
Duplicate yourself to stay in the game
Causeâ theyâll steal your life for money and shame

New messiah of the sonic anarchy
Can you handle this monster of energy

Welcome to the star factory
Hollywood whores
Synthetic dope for free
Welcome to the star factory
Youâre the future of the music industry

Welcome to the Stardust Gallery

Some big names are closing doors
They sold your soul for Rock and roll
âCause you want all or nothing at all
Sexgod became a dying whore
