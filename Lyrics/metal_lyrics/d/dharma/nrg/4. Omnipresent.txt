Show me how to think
Show me how to live
Show me how to dream
Show me how to build
Show me how to try
Show me how to find
Show me how to smile
Yeah ease the mind

It lengthens my life
It brightens the day
It strengthens the will
Let's born again

I received this love
Sent back to the heart
It's shivered my spine
Like the heat of the night

Use my senses
Do not doubt
Light our fire
It'll take us higher
Never doubt
Never stop
Never drop

Oh I'll never doubt

Thank you for the life
The life you gave us
Thank you for these energies of sacrifice
Thank you for the love
The love you save us
Thank you for showing me paradise
