I have been asking myself
Is it more than I could expect
Is it more than I could do than close my eyes and think about you
I think I speak for everyone when I say that we had fun
But you have pierced all my bones and I was nailed to the cross

Grant me to life
Drag me out of hell
Make the same prayer as the repentant man

Grant me to life
Drag me out of hell
Make the same prayer as the repentant man

I've been draining
You've been holding out with the fire in my eyes
Our bed
Our funeral pyre
Ashes of empire

I've been draining
You've been holding out with the embers in your heart
I've been drowning with a burning liar
Energy Vampire

Stop bleeding me dry

Stop sapping me
