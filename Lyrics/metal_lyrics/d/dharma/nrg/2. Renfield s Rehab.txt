Master
Master
Iâm your slave
Iâm your slave
I wonât betray you
Just let me live
Let me live
Punish me
Torture me
But let me live
Let me be
Let them bleed
Let them bleed

Flies Flies Flies Flies
Fat spiders spinning web
Rats Rats Rats Rats
With their eyes blazing red
Cats Cats Cats Cats
Small bites on their necks

Two wounds give you life
A maniac fight
But the sun has gone
Leaving shadows behind
The blood gives you life
It makes me alive and God wonât damn

My lunatic mind
My lunatic mind

Master
Master
Iâm your slave
Iâm your slave
I keep your secret
Just let me live
Let me live
