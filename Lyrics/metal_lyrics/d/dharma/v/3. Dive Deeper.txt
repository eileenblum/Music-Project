I donât want to see that
There is nothing to hold onto
I canât stand anymore
When the pain is coming through

Iâll try to erase your lies
In the hidden temple of my mind
Iâm chanting secret mantras
Leave time and space behind

I was dropped in the blood
I was covered by the ground
Who are you to bring me down?
Little seeds will reach the sun

I made love to fear
A thousand times
A thousand tears
Your darkness pushed me here
Iâm gone, Iâm disappeared

I open the gates of night
Your black moon, your crying stars
Those red roses keep bleeding
Take my heart, take my eyes

I was dropped in the blood
I was covered by the ground
Who are you to bring me down?
Little seeds will reach the sun

Dive deeper into the unknown
All alone
Dive deeper into the unknown
Alone
