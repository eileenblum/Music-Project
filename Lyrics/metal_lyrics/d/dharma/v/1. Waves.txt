Iâve closed the door of yesterday
Now Iâve thrown your rusty key away
Iâm just standing on the shore of the last chance
I feel the change as Iâm getting in trance

The hole in my heart is filling up with love
Iâm not lost here as Iâm getting above

Emotions flooding
Iâm riding on the waves
Tsunamiâs coming
Iâm not afraid anymore

I wonât waste my time with you no more
Thereâs no point in bitching anymore
Arrogance, ignorance, deja vu
I feel the strength to see it right through

The hole in my heart is filling up with love
Iâm not lost here as iâm getting above

Emotions flooding
Iâm riding on the waves
Tsunamiâs coming
Iâm not afraid anymore

I dived in you for a while
I saw the chaos in your mind
Beyond the depth of the abyss
Crumbling lands, burning bridges

Emotions flooding
Iâm riding on the waves
Tsunamiâs coming
Iâm not afraid anymore
