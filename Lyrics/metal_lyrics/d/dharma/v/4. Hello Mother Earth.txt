Weâre flying to the sky, where the clouds never cry
We move as fast as the ray of light
Hello Sister Venus
Hello Brother Mars, hello Father Sun
Let us dance with the rings of Saturn

One with the universe
One with the stars
So donât be afraid of the start
Wish something from the heart

Shining Milky Way surrounds me
Big smile, big galaxy
Moon in a cosmic love affair
Itâs time to look down from there

Hello Mother Earth
How are you today?
Do you feel happiness?
Do you want a change?
Do you want peace?
Do you feel the same?
