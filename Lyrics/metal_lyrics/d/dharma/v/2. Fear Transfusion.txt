Hunger and rage
In an iron cage
Mad dogs
Dried blood on the face
Killing their youngs
Are you entertained?

Foaming at the mouth
[4x]

Torn our freedom
Ate our brains
Clap your hands
Are you entertained?

Enjoy the show
It's evolution
Money, war, fear transfusion
Enjoy the show
It's evolution
Culture, class, race, religions

Death smiles
The lock falls down
They attack your mind
Barking around

The control power is watching from the tower
Top predators
Destroy, devour

Human toys
Wasted by
White noise hours

Torn our freedom
Ate our brains
Clap your hands
Are you entertained?

Enjoy the show
It's evolution
Money, war, fear transfusion
Enjoy the show
It's evolution
Culture, class, race, religions

(No revolution)
