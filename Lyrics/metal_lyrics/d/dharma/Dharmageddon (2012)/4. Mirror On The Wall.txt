MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL-WHO DO YOU LOVE MOST OF ALL
MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL -WHICH IS THE FAIREST TEST OF ALL
MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL-WHAT DO I SEE AFTER ALL

MY GOD IS BEYOND PERCEPTION
MY PERCEPTION CAN SEE THROUGH RECESSION
GETTING OUT OF THIS DEPRESSION
ITâS NOT A QUESTION
THATâS MY REFLECTION

SHAKE
IF I WANNA WAKE
IF I WANNA SAVE
SAVE THE SANITY
NOT THE VANITY

EVERY WORD YOU SAY TO ME
KEEP THE SANITY NOT THE VANITY
EVERY THOUGHT YOU GAVE TO ME
KEEP THE SANITY NOT THE VANITY
NOT THE VANITY

MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL-WHO DO YOU LOVE MOST OF ALL
MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL-WHICH IS THE FAIREST TEST OF ALL
MIRROR MIRROR ON THE WALL-WHERE IS YOUR MAGIC AFTER ALL
