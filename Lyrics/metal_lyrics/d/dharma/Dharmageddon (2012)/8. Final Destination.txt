You had a dream last night
I was inside your mind
YOU WERE SCREAMING MY NAME
BUT YOU COULDN'T FIND THE WAY
TO TAKE THE PAIN AWAY
THEN THERE YOU WERE
LYING IN YOUR CELL
YOU STARTED LAUGHING
LAUGHING LIKE HELL
Something takes your breath away
SHAKES YOUR SWEATING HEAD
WHILE YOU SLEPT
GUESS WHOSE BACK

I AM CONSCIOUSNESS
I AM ENERGY
IâM VIBRATION
I AM ELECTRICITY
IâM CREATION
IMAGINATION
MEDITATION
THE NEW DIMENSION

I AM FREEDOM
I AM ENERGY
IâM SALVATION
I AM ELECTRICITY
IâM CREATION
IMAGINATION
MEDITATION
THE LAST TEMPTATION

IâM CREATOR
I AM ENERGY
I AM PASSION
I AM ELECTRICITY
APPRECIATION
IMAGINATION

THE FINAL DESTINATION
