IF I ONLY KNEW
WHAT I KNOW TODAY
I wouldn't let you go
I wouldn't let you down
You would take the pain away
RELEASE IT WITH A SMILE
IF I ONLY KNEW
WHAT I KNOW TODAY

You mean the world to me

YOU ARE MY LIFE
SENT FROM ABOVE
YOU ARE MY LIGHT
WHEN I AM LOST IN THE DARK
YOU ARE MY DRUG
YOU ARE MY BLOOD
YOU ARE THE BEAT IN MY HEART

IF I WANT TO HIDE
IN MY FIGMENT HELL
AND IâM AFRAID TO TRY
WHAT IS IN MY HEAD

YOU WOULD TAKE THE PAIN AWAY
RELEASE IT WITH YOUR SMILE
IF I ONLY KNEW
WHAT IâVE LEARNED TODAY
