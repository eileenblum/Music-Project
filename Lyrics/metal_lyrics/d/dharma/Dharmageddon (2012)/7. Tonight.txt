SEVENTH SISTER OF THE HIGHEST HEIGHT
KISSED THE SUN WITH FROZEN MOUTH
BURNED HER WINGS BUT SPREAD THE LIGHT
LIFTING EVERY HEART TONIGHT

TAUGHT YOU EVERYTHING AND NOTHING YOU WOULD SAVE
IâVE PAID THE PRICE FOR ALL YOUR MORTAL SINS
WATCHED YOU MAKE MISTAKES AND NOTHING LEFT TO SAY
CRUCIFIED THE TRUTH
I MUST FEEL THE PAIN

HOLY WATER FROM THE DESERTâS SKY
OPENED THE GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES
SOWING THE SEEDS OF OUR LIFE
ONCE ITâS FOUND IT WILL BE RIGHT

Take me down from the cross
I WANT TO WAKE IN MY MOTHERâS ARMS
