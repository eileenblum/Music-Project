I WANNA FEEL THE POWER OF YOUR SOUL'S LOVE
IT'S SOMETHING I NEED IN MY HEART
I WANNA TASTE THE WINE OF YOUR BODY
YOUR BLOOD BOILING IN MY VEINS

I WANNA HEAR THE SOUND OF YOUR BREATHING
FLAMING LUNGS AND BURNING MUSCLES
LET ME TASTE THE HONEY ON YOUR SWEET LIPS
ON YOUR NECK AND FINGERTIPS

SIX IN YOUR EYES
NINE IN YOUR SOUL
SEX BLOOD AND ROCK'N ROLL
C'MON
STRIP TO YOUR SKIN
AND ENTER THE DOOR
SEX BLOOD AND ROCK'N ROLL

I WANNA DANCE TO THE RHYTHM OF YOUR HEARTBEAT
IT'S LIKE A DRUG RUSHING THROUGH MY MIND
LET ME HIDE YOU
LET ME GUIDE YOU
LET'S REDEFINE PARADISE
