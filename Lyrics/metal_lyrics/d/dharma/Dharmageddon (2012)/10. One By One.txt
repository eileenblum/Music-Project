YOU BREAK INTO MY LIFE LIKE A THIEF
DID YOU GET UNDER MY SKIN

YOU'RE SO CLOSE
I FEEL SO RIGHT
STEAL THE PAST
FROM MY MIND

HELLO HELLO-I KNOW YOUR NAME
HELLO HELLO-I'M IN THE GAME
HELLO HELLO-I'M HERE TO STAY
HELLO HELLO-I CAN'T RUN AWAY

ONE BY ONE
BURN MY THOUGHTS
ALL ARE GONE
ALL ARE LOST
SHINING LIGHT THROUGH MY EYES
MY FUTURE SEEMS SO BRIGHT

LIVE MY LIFE DAY BY DAY
TIME IS TICKING AWAY
HEAL MY HEART
'CAUSE IT'S SO BRUISED
RIGHT NOW
NOT A MINUTE TO LOSE
