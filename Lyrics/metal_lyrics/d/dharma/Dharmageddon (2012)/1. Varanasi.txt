TRAPPED IN THE CYCLE OF BIRTH
REINCARNATED FLESH
WHEEL OF SAMSARA TURNING
BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD

CAME HERE TO PRAY
CAME HERE TO DIE
GANGA THE RIVER GODDESS
Take us to the other side

ASHES ON THE GROUND
AND SMOKE IN THE AIR
NO TEARS TO CRY
SHE SET THEM FREE
MY FRIENDS

THE HEAT IN YOUR FACE
UNTOUCHABLE FLAMES
A BILLION SOUL STIRRING
IN THE WAVES OF GANGES

BODIES CREMATED THERE
PILE OF BURNING LEAVES
AS WE STOP THE CIRCLE OF SUFFERING
WE ARE FREE FROM THE ENDLESS DREAMS

WEâRE ALL AGAIN
