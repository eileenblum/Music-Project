Desire me
The secret in your mind
Plays out your fantasy
Playing the part of your life
It's left you so dirty

We all have a cross to bear
Some of us have a lot of them
Are you bold enough to live
your life with no regrets

Don't get down on your knees
You have nothing to fear
Deliver me to your dreams

Don't get down on your knees
You have nothing to fear
I'll wash away your sins

Desire me
To tell you of the misery
Which memory
Reenacts
Every day and every night
Upon the stage of my heart

The secret in your mind
Plays out your fantasy
Playing the part of your life
It's left you so dirty

We all have a cross to bear
Some of us have a lot of them
Are you strong enough to take
Your destiny in your own hands
