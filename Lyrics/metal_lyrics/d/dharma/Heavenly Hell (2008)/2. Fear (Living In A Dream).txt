Are you living in a dream or living your dreams
Are you awakened every morning by the hollow screams
You've been hiding out, keeping away from the creeps
When will you realize what fear really means

Are you scared

Demons around your head

Are you scared

Facing with your death

Now that you are all alone
You feel like
There is no one out there for you
Now that you are all alone
You feel like
There is nothing you cannot do

It's time to leave your world behind
And come to a place where life isn't blind
You can escape your memories
And live your life within reality
