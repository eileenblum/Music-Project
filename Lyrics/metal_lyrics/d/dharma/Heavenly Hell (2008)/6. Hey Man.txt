I know that you can't fall in love
With anyone else just with yourself
I go
And leave you alone
To let you enjoy your own cell
What's wrong
So you only want to say
That I'll always be the real spell

Now when the time is passed
You came to me ,for tell me that
Made mistake, I love you too
I don't need this shit from you
Forgot you,I've stepped away
No more drama,no more pain
You think,you did it so damned well
I don't need, you go to hell!
GO TO HELL
GO TO HELL
GO TO HELL
GO GO GO !!!
