Hey you
I know what you're searching for
But I can't understand that
Why don't you want a little bit more
I'm here
And you push me away
Like a child gets rid of a bad toy
That's right
'Cause you only want to play
And I don't let you play with my joy

Manipulation and Utilization
Things that you know perfectly
Analization and Judication
It's too easy

Love me for myself
Even if I'm hard
Take me and then break me
Not that is what I want
Hold me with strong hands
Never let me go
Feel me and then lead me
Through your burning soul
