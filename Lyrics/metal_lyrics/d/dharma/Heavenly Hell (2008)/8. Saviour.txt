I was broken and empty
Burnt out inside
They loved me ,They blamed me
I don't know why

But you came
As the rainbow after rain
You brought me to life again
And I opened myself to you

So come come to me my Saviour ,tonight
So come come to me and bring me the light

Cause' I just want to get your fever running through my blood
Shine my heart with sacred fire , keep it burning strong

I choose not to blame them
I choose to survive
I feel something is rising
Deep down inside

'Cause you came
As the rainbow after rain
You brought me to life again
And I'll drift in a dream with you
