The brightest flame
Leaves the deepest scar
You know what's coming
It's gonna hurt you
The highest law
Is the will of truth
It's gonna burn you
Your ashes fall to the ground.
Everything you give me so far
The karma comes back to you
Everything you give me so far
All comes back to you ,threefold

The brightest flame
Lights the darkest star
Burns our signs
It's gonna blind you
With your foolish judge
Tried to bring me down
But I wouldn't let you
You're gonna hit the ground

Self-love slaps you
Right in the face
Put melted lead
In your ears

Self-love slaps you
It makes you deaf
It puts a hole
In your head
