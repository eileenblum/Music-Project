Out of space into the dirt
You re falling down my friend
The summer sun is fading fast
Your world's dying over again

Love, hate, and everything under the sky
Is now aligned like puzzle pieces
Your time has come to fall
Strangers know who you are
You can run, but you can't hide from what you are

Life is so short that it must be lived slowly
Open your eyes look at the things calmly
You might grab the sun
You can reach out for the sky
You can push it around
You can try

You feel most alive
When you are closest to death
But you don't want to die, until you've said,
All you need to say to those you care about.
Sometimes things happen
And there is no way to stop
And there is no way to stop them
