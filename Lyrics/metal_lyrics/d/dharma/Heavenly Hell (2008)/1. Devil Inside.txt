In a perfect world
Where time stands still
Forsaken mind
Makes you wanna kill

Souls are burning
While you still alive
You made a deal
With the devil inside

You've left your mark on me
It will be there for eternity
Where you have always been
And I will never be
We are praying breathing bleeding
Sanity

In your tears
I see their lives go by
Wasted years
You left your mind behind
Can't take
This feeling from the heart
You're more
Than what you've become

Shouting God's name
To the empty sky
You see their lives
Pass before your eyes
