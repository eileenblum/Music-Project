A new life was given to me
Oh please God, help me to see again
I want to rise while others fall
To the ground...to the deepest hole

I see now I must fight harder
Oh please God ,give me the strength
Of a million angels to hold back my fears.
I'm here for only one reason and that's to win

I will be strong while watching others run away
Why should they crawl on the floor
Why would they get away

They tried to kill me a million times
And made me feel more dead than alive
But I'm still standing, I'm still standing tall
I will push them back to the deepest hole

It's time to rise again
