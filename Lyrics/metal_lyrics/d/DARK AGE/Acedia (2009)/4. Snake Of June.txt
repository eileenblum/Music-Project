Demise has attracted a lifelong appeal to ease
The itch of the loving
No compromise steady enough to conceal the truth
My paltry dependence from you

I know I have been tricked again

It is you they call a snake of June
Because nothing of what you say is true
You will see that someday soon
A splitted tongue will speak to you

My tried to escape
From a world that I thought I knew
Have drowned in their laughter
Revealing my weakness to bury my love for good
Has denied self-forgiveness

It was all in your eyes
The trust of faith, all hope and wise
I chose the apple, believed your lies
Felt the poison and closed my eyes...

My eyes...
