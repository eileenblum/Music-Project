Preachers, priests and nuns
Listen to their iron tongues

Parents who dare to care
Welcome a new nightmare

All of us are in
Now let this nightmare
For all of us begin
Reloading Columbine
The trigger pulls the sin
For someone out there
Death is close to win
The frantic bullet ride

They are just some ghosts
They like ghosts in a machine

Teachers, school and guns
Better lock up your sons

This teenage has they share
Brough up this cruel affair

Save me, save our souls

I am no ghost
