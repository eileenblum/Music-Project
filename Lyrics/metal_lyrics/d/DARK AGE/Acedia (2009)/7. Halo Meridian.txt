So mad you talk about this world
Gaining lots of respect
But what does really happen?

How come you find so many words
But then act like what was said is forgotten
You smile like the one who was made
For all souls to save... oh so brave

How come that you know what goes wrong
But then you join the league
Of those who converse
The shining god that you pretend to be
Is lost in reality

So sad inside my head
It's always there, in times I'm not aware
Let's make it fine today, is what you say
But you just stay in your reserve

No more will I believe your words
