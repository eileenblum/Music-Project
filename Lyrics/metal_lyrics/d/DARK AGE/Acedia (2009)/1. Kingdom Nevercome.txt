An interfering link connects with the unstable
My scattered eye in used to fake the worst

I am giving in to a plastic cash return
Working the daydream until my muscles burn

While falling through measures
It's sucking me in
Raising doubt, all sense bleeding empty
It's hard to begin, to break out

I am dying while trying
I am so close to get a life like all others
Fall back on regret, will I ever be myself again
After building my kingdom nevercome

Watch a life collapse for things not to come
The helpless try to compensate this life

The visionary life to himself
Not to others, not to others

Rise to ill
But who has proven life to be alright?
