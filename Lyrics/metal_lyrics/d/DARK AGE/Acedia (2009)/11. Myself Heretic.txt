All mental poison
Comes in many hundred different ways
But instead of searching
I am better off without the prayer's days

Myself heretic, I have chosen not to know it all
Myself heretic, but i know my call
Myself heretic, I know my place and chose to be
Myself heretic, I'd rather die than lie to me

I am asking you if you have seen it all
Have proven this world to be divine
And I am glad, that for you a kingdom shines
And that you believe in signs

This is myself heretic
