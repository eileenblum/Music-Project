We grew up in fences
Drinking light from arid sun rays
Before I saw the sitting brawling
Cutting faces to flowers

Why is everything so blithe and delighted?
Why is everything so full of light?

I have the strangest feeling...

Inside these neon gardens
Nothing's the same
Is the same any more
Inside these neon gardens
I ask you what might have gone wrong

They have tried to blinden me
But my eyes have seen dark long before
They have tried to random me
But their lies have called me before

But we grow without chances
Adjusting time beyond these climes I know
I saw the thinker
He is the soil of the life that grows in me

Don't hold me down
