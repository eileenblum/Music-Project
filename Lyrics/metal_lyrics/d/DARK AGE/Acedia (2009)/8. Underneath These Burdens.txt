I was so close, so close to know resistance
Out of my daymares it's proving my persistence

So why are you... are you asking me?

I am out of line and out of time
I feel this way for so long

I know I am ruined
I am lonely and upset but...
Who was given you the right
What has blinded your sight
I know I'm desperate
But I have no regret, so...
Who was given you the right
What has blinded your sight

I underneath my burdens
I guess you understand
I underneath these burdens
I know that you would bend

So why are you... are you asking me?

Are you aware that I am tired
Empty... worn out... lifeless inside
