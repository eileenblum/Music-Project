Step 1, step 2
We're shaking hands, don't like you too
Step 3, step 4
Our egos call, now I want more

Hands on your rifles
Were facing cash on fragile ground
For bloody sake
Now my skills are worth, the bills unbound

My trifle has come here a long way, stranger
I wonder is you got it close
But all I can show, as a weak man, stranger
Is that I just got killed for the pose

Step 5, step 6
Let's play the game, I know your tricks
Step 7, step 8
I'm falling back, it's not too late

Again has proven
Who washes hands in others blood
It's you and me
The one who looses cannot see

Give in to something   give in to nothing
