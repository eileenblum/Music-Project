You brought it up
Your face reminds me of my better days
That never caught up to me

There were the nights, I chose to search a life
That should fulfill all of my empty needs

Hey you, hey! Are we going the same way?
Hey you, hey! Are we sharing the same day?

Out of the damp and gloomy days
I sing and dance myself away
While everything falls apart
I'll arrange another start

You brought it up
This city reminds me of a poisoned will
For excessive redemptions

Those were the days, I chose to live a life beyond
The things that seem to be forever

Is there no one to share this feeling
I guess my shadow remain kneeling
