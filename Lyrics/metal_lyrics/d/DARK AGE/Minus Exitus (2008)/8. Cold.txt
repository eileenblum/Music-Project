All I need to set me free
Is time to face what dies in me
Empty me, oh bitter me
Time to face serenity

Fatal temptations and I am close to give in
Painful conclusions about to begin
I can feel that I can't feel
Will this heart never heal?

I don't want it, I don't feel it
Inside a world, I never needed he sins,
the weak, the battles and apologies
Days so empty, irrational and full of grief

I don't want it, no, I don't need it
Lost in a world that always bleeded, I die... again

I get colder inside the more that I try
And with every day I fall deeper
I am frozen inside, all feelings have died
And with every day it crawls deeper

I wake up, no peace of mind
Neurotic behavement of a different kind
I don't feel what should make me feel
My blood is cold, I lost what made it real

I don't want it, no, I don't need it
Lost inside a world I never beated
Fate, loss, the battles and apologies
Made days so empty, irrational and full of grief

I don't want it, no, I don't need it
Lost in a world that always cheated

From now on I am not your future

I get colder inside the more that I try
And with every day I fall deeper
I am frozen inside, all feelings have died
And with every day it crawls deeper

I am not your future
