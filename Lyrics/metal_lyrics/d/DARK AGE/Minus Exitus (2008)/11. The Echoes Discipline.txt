Promises and the loving heart
Failed to follow a simple request
Something calling that had fallen to pieces
It never showed why you felt so worthless

You know, you know that you will never be like me
And you know, you know that I will never be like you

Abandoned hearts have a cause to swallow
I was calling for the one who bleeds
Trapped inside all these circles of sorrow
You'll never be at one with your needs

You always wanted it so badly
Be who you are 'cause we already live the dreams that we follow

Echoes returning stable
Results remain the same
No way out, no way out

You know, you know that you will never be like me
And you know, you know that I will never be like you

Your world, your world
Your world is fucking out of reach
Your world, your world
Your world's a million miles away
(Miles Away)

You... you always wanted
You... you always wanted

Echoes returning stable
Results remain the same
No way out, no way out

You know, you know that you will never be like me
And you know, you know that I will never be like you
