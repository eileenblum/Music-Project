Reality has convinced the unsure
Proclaiming peace is a modern term
Give in to something real but silent
It better be the way we learn

No doubt, I am ready to fall
They shaped this world for a formless me
So I doubt, that I am ready to call out
for a life that needs society

Reaction, reflection of values that are false
My actions, attractions- choose life behind a wall

No, no, no, here I go again...

Because your outside shapes my inside
Every day I find to see
That this world that you are loving
Is a smiling enemy

I don't know why I have followed
Without asking where we go
I guess it is just too hard and hollow
In a world that I don't know

I know, it is time to recall
Secular ethics are impossible
I know, it is time for us all
But finding sense is so predictable

Negation, relation, never knew what was the cause
No actions of sections - that decline I never was

No, no, no, here I go again...

Because your outside shapes my inside
Every day I find to see
That this world that you are loving
Is a smiling enemy

I don't know why I have followed
Without asking where we go
I guess it is just too hard and hollow
In a world that I don't know

Life has no meaning
No action preferable to any other

No, no, no, here I go again...

Because your outside shapes my inside
Every day I find to see
That this world that you are loving
Is a smiling enemy

I don't know why I have followed
Without asking where we go
I guess it is just too hard and hollow
In a world that I don't know
