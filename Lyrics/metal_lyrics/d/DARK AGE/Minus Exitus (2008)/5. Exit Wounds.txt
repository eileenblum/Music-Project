Your words have hit me like a ten ton steam hammer, bitch...
... cutted me in two, have pulled me down to kneel for you

You freak... indeed, our battles made me weak
You freak... mendacious bliss in all you seek

When you are falling your wounds are calling
You need to hurt to feel free

Right on
Right on

Who knew what I ran into
Demons that returned to you
A weak, fake fall or helpless need
Inbred to sponge our bleed

Free are the ones who can choose
And you know there is nothing to lose

Follow me into all misery
I choose you to reveal my exit wounds
Fallacy composed my harmonies
I want you to unscar these crying wounds

Exit wounds

Right on
Right on

Your words have hit me like a ten ton steam hammer, bitch...
... cutted me in two, have pulled me down to kneel for you

Free are the ones who can choose
And you know there is nothing to lose

Follow me into all misery
I choose you to reveal my exit wounds
Fallacy composed my harmonies
I want you to unscar these crying wounds
