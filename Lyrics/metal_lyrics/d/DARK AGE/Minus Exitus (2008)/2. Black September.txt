I am the darkest rising
A star that kissed the sky
Faithfully I consume your features
With an injected lies

Bury me, and I'll bury you
Against the odds, it's all I do
Plain whise but you came while calling
Imperialistic lies

Thunder bleeds our purple skies
Carry me to the son who cries
Your caring hearts are full of grain
Our dying children are insane

Will it be today or will it be tomorrow?
It is whatever you say...

...because it feels so real to believe that I heal

No, I am your black September
Unfaithful cries in unfaithful times

Father, fake the colours
I preach them every day
Black blood calls the dollars
Down with life and peace I say

I can hear them talk to me
Fearfull faces all I see
No one climbs the golden tree
So sorry for what we cannot be.

Will it be today or will it be tomorrow?
It is whatever you say...

...because it feels so real to believe that I heal

No, I am your black September
Unfaithful cries in unfaithful times
