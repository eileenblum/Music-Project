I don't see who we are, I don't see what we are
I don't see who we are, I don't see where we are

This world grows an old believer
Where progress means decay
Death as a tempting diva
Tomorrow is yesterday

Dying for a new reality
Who sold it to the ones who sleep?
The death of one is no more tragedy
Statistics have now taken the lead

And we've been searching for ages
Pain and Guilt no one able to see
That life needs death inside a world so instable
No new belief, rewritten history

How shall we all overcome when there are no
dreams that guide how to feel inside? i say...

How shall this world overcome when there is
just death that decides when to believe in life? I say...

Can you feel it?
Can you see it?
Can you be it?

So what do you die for if absence realigns
For rapture it will need more
In death lies life divine

Mortal reactions and the mankind tree
are drying out the rains of gold
Integrity, lack of identity
Carry one what is left untold

Do you hear me?

And we've been searching for ages
Pain and Guilt no one able to see
That life needs death inside a world so instable
No new belief, rewritten history

How shall we all overcome when there are no
dreams that guide how to feel inside? I say...

How shall this world overcome when there is
just death that decides when to believe in life? I say...

Can you feel it?
Can you see it?
Can you be it?

Go! Go!

As we run our spirits pass the timeline
Leaving the organic
Touching earhless life

And we've been searching for ages
Pain and Guilt no one able to see
That life needs death inside a world so instable
No new belief, rewritten history

How shall we all overcome when there are no
dreams that guide how to feel inside? i say...

How shall this world overcome when there is
just death that decides when to believe in life? I say...

Can you feel it?
Can you see it?
Can you be it?
