Take it all away, but who is riding all fault?
Hassel and affectation have become your ways

But I want you to know that the remedy is already here

Just another downfall
Of all unworthily minds
Is there no truth
Why must it all become fake just simply to be worthy of it?

No, no, fuck your better days
It takes what it needs to redefine
These ailing walls
Why must it all become fake to know what we are fighing for?

I want life for blood, I am calling out for the enemy
I want life for blood, this one goes out to our industry
No clear direction has caused a bitter affection
Whatever music needs, rethink your distinctive deeds

It is always the same
Profits kills art
So weak and lame
To play this game

I want you to know that
I want you to know that the enemy is already here

Is there still truth behind this inscutable durtain?
Is there no truth behind these inscutable lies?

Just another downfall
Of all unworthily minds
Is there no truth
Why must it all become fake just simply to be worthy of it?

No, no, fuck your better days
It takes what it needs to redefine
These ailing walls
Why must it all become fake to know what we are fighing for?

I want life for blood, I am calling out for the enemy
I want life for blood, this one goes out to our industry
No clear direction has caused a bitter affection
Whatever music needs, rethink your distinctive deeds

Is there still truth behind this inscutable durtain?
Is there no truth behind these inscutable lies?

want life for blood, I am calling out for the enemy
I want life for blood, this one goes out to our industry
No clear direction has caused a bitter affection
Whatever music needs, rethink your distinctive deeds
