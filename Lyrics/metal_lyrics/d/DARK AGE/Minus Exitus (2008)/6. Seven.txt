I try to be a modern god, following honesty
I try to be a modern god that lives in dignity

But there is still this aching thorn
Moral mistakes that are inborn
(I know them all somehow)

Oh, what a feeling that I am dealing
I know your seven sins need seven allies
Oh, what a feeling that I am dealing
I know your seven gods need seven more lies

Lies... seven lies

I cannot be a modern god living on bleeding knees
I cannot be a modern god without divine release

My soul feels so unreal and torn
Human mistakes that are inborn
(I know them all somehow)

Oh, what a feeling that I am dealing
I know your seven sins need seven allies
Oh, what a feeling that I am dealing
I know your seven gods need seven more lies

I know the ruleless rule gods and others
Your heaven knows not what I have been through

A virtue for ages, they began to close the circle
Declaring doubt to be a sin

I never wanted what I never needed
Pointing your weakness to confirm my beliefs
Beginning to see that sinning is a part that makes us human

Oh, what a feeling that I am dealing
I know your seven sins need seven allies
Oh, what a feeling that I am dealing
I know your seven gods need seven more lies

Seven
Seven Lies
