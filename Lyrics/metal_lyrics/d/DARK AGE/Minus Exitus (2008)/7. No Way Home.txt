Brothers and sisters, find your way home
Brothers and sisters, I feel so alone
Brothers and sisters, don't you know
Brothers and sisters... why I feel so

I want you to know that I still feel
I want you to know that I still believe

Wherever I go, I know I will be yearning
Whatever I know, it's my world that's burning
Never felt free to go where I long
Never felt free to sing this song

Brothers and sisters, I love you so (I hate you so)
Brothers and sisters, I need to go
Brothers and sisters, don't you know
Brothers and sisters... that life will show

I want you to know that I still feel
I want you to know that I still believe

Wherever I go, I know I will be yearning
Whatever I know, it's my world that's burning
Never felt free to go where I long
Never felt free to sing this song
