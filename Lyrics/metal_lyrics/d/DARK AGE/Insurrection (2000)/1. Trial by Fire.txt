The sarcastic demise is calling
For the fragile souls of our times
Sensitive senseless mourning
From the ones who gave up their lives
Revolution for self evolution
Their deaths should attract 
the one and only solution
Despising the world by learning
Their dreams set free 
while this fertile burning...

Decaying mind fall nation
They were fighting 
the world's soul devastation
Aware their last prepare
Farewell letters with fuel stench 
in the air
Pain, hate, body and soul
Nothing should ever take control
Burning for the new beginning
The angels had stopped 
their inaudible singing...

And when your life is ending here
The alternative is near
Welcome the change
Welcome the change
That will take your fear...

Go now, burn now baby
This is revolution, honey
Go now, burn now baby
Go and kill the nation honey

Cries against the lies
Helpless tries to open their eyes
Rise for a world that dies
Accept the size of it's demise

Trial by fire
The burner's desire
Their suicides live in me
Go, try your self with fire
Live your desire
And kill what breaks in us...
