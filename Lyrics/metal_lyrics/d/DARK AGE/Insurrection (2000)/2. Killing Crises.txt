Heavy killing - new and sick vibrations now
A situation is awaiting the truth
This is a moment that will never ever
again allow you to be a part 
of my discouraged youth
Waiting for my downfall
I am here to make you recall
My memories will take you 
to what I have been through
Let me show you what is left inside
It was that institution as your last solution
I was to weak to fight the coming tide
Forced to feel a suffering
I have become a lifeless thing

Breaking on through with I am into
myself escaping from the cause
I need a heart that is able to heal
Because I have lost what makes me feel

Darkness tonight
In a world I cannot fight
These are the Killing Crises
And they are coming straight from you...

It was the process of awaking 
what has slept inside
The thrilling point of no return
I have recovered my strength 
that did for too long hide
Forgive your self for what 
you did never learn
Fuck you for you presence
And for destroying my life's sense...

A psychopathic youth?
I was dreaming of hope 
and searching for truth
Now I can see 
that I will never be free
And still I am more than you will ever be...

No, you won't hurt me
No, no, you won't hurt me this time...
