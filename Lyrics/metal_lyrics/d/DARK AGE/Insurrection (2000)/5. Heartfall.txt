Forever should it be
Our love for all eternity
Will we ever see
This dream become reality?
Nothing is forever...
Hard were the times
we had been through together
After all we do know why
It had to be our last goodbye...

I am dying from inside
I was crying every night

The substance we fear
Truth hid in nights we felt near
Sorry never meant to be mean
The model soul caring never to be seen?
I hope you will remember me
When we both know
What will never be...

I am dying from inside
I was crying every night

Heartfall
Makes our dreams call
In times we cannot see
That our dreams fall
When our hearts call
Far from reality
