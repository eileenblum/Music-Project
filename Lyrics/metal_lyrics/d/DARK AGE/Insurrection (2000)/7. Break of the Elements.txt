Again awakes the season
From the coming of an abstruse disease
Guilt needs no reason
To turn off it's destructive increase
Nature is the host
For the cultures of a parasitic mind
The balance of "4" is lost
Break of the source form the ones who are blind...

Break of, break of the elements
Break of, break of the elements

Welcome the new formation
Chaos from those who refuse to destine
Colonies of salvation
Humanity is the tumour of time
The planet of seas
Is now drying from thirst and willing to please
The need for evolution...

The coming of revolution
Will gain an evolution
Open the last dimensions
To begin from the point where our angels appear...
