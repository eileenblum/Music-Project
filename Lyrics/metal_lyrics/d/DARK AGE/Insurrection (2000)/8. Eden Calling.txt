Abstract believer -
Who follows will fall
Do you know your true gods inside?
It is us
But your mind is so small...

Bastard!
I will make you believe in me
Present impressions are calling for change
Take place for a structure of false dignity
So I suffer
You break
We will harvest -
The seeds are awake
The conflict size will breed the upcoming demise
Creation -
We will pay for the lies...

Eden, where is Eden?
I've been searching so long...
Eden what is Eden?
My heart can't be wrong...
Dreams for your weak lives
Will you make them come true?
When Eden is calling
Calling for you...

Fake of visions
And deny of prophecies
We know it all
Forgotten is what let us see
Concrete is what men can be
Estranged perfection comes with sanity
So you suffer
I broke
The seeds we harvest are sick and without hope
Your conflict size has bred the upcoming demise
Creation?
To high is your price...
