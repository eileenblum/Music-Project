Oh wicked rain caller -
You reflect this lifetime of mine
Alone and empty seem the souls of belief
Singing this chorus
Suffering from grief

This is the chaos of gods
The ultimate silence
This is the chaos of gods
The loss of all guidance

Rise the volumes
Raise the chords
Dark Age is here to fight the gods!
Prepared for a world not made for us
Revenge we seek
No gods between us

This is the chaos of gods
The ultimate silence
This is the chaos of gods
The loss of all guidance

They call me creator of this world
The ultimate one
Gifted with mind, heart and soul
I gave you (a world) of control

Liar!
Humanity breeds chaos
a life of war and lies!
Feel me
Live inside me
Taste my soul and you will see
That in this god ruled world
Only ferocious dreams are free...

Free this damn gods from me
