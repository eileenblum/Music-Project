This distance will take time
And we are tired of dreaming awake
No place for us to shine
No one these days could now take
Will we learn from what tomorrow will be
Heal this fucking world from it's brutality
Frustration thrills every night
But what sense would it make to give up our fight...

Forever
Tired of tries
Sick of waking up with tears in my eyes
Never
I will not follow
I won't wake up because I am fearing tomorrow

Lost in a static motion
And elevating the abhorrent pretence
The guarantor for social erosion
Has become the most ghastly and massive offence
Heartless seem the days
Pretending to be something new
The bitter need for sensation
Has objected the fears of my whole generation...
