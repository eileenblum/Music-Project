We are for wrong denied but conscious
Without a doubt a proof for the lies
For ages have they tried to show us
That our hate is a matter of size

No one leaves until we raised our voices now allied
This world has changed and left the bitterness inside

The prophecies are formatting
While you are betraying rights
Placid and focused were waiting
Soon turning the streams of your tides
Why wont you see that this yearning
Has a cause that shows up the crime
Wake up, the focus is burning
And we are running out of time

All we are will name it
Fear unloads the hate inside 
While we have set our fires
You were sleeping deep and tight

You better fix the focus
And dare not to provoke us
You better fix what will take
The choices that we have to make

We were blind and mindless
Corrosion through and through
No better time to show us
What we have meant to you
Submission now expanded
To believe the one who feeds
But here is truth demanded
The elementary needs
