Fear out of dreams
To escape from today
And as long as it means
To assure this decay
The pureness on earth 
Has infected the curse
Now come on 
We are neokillers baby,
Destroyers of the universe

This Steady cold age of distant minds
Has abandoned all the harmony needs
Inject their dreams with a personal rage
And you will grow steel out of the seeds 
Take machines and
Give them a soul
The serum for a new stagnation 
Fake the real
By what it means
Alpha gods and sensation

The Auditory grace is system fixed
And ignorant with an attitude

(Our) instincts show no way to relief
And reload the tired samplitude
Destroy and heal

Destroy and heal
Modern reputation
Destroy and heal
Destroy and heal
Human domination 

Virtual shelters of hiding ghosts
Cold age of distance
Take the machines 
And arise them from god
