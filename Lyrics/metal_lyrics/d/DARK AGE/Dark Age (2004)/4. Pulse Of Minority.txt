Break it down...and

Reload all your senses
Cause they will never care for your tears
Be aware of your chances
Cause they will never take all your fears
(If you are) lost, be part of the rising
A new scenario will change aliesing
The jaded domination
Is worth a new creation

This is the Pulse of Minority
Let this break all their authority

Revolute - Evolute your self

So increase the pressure
Evoke the structure plain by time
Burry my wrong aggressor
The truth appeals to heal the crime
Shock them, invade their lives
Creative trust to fight the lies
Solid controlled hysteria
Will show them who we really are...
