All that bleeds has died 
And for years the voices lied
At times that we have aimed
To be thankful and ashamed 

Face down 
Before you stare at the sun 
With a nailed crown
Our destiny done
There is no need to face our future
This is the Elegy of a forgotten science

Take it all away
What is lost day by day
The forgotten words allied
4 Elements, now denied
