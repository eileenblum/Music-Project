Impatient I am waiting now
For years have they promised the cure
I got a little different somehow
Nervous and a bit insecure
Everyday I face another disease
And with my self I stand here alone
There are things that make it hard to increase
The feelings that cannot be shown

Neurosis 404
I am addicted to life
But I can't feel anymore
Neurosis 404
I am a fake
And I can't go on anymore
Neurosis, anyone, who knows this?
These voices, anyone, who knows this?

There are voices that reflect this guilt
Former faces, pale but clear
I know the consequences now
Felt the hits with every tear
Can anyone please believe me
I am dying the deaths of lies
Or have you noticed it is nearly
(Like) the essence of (my) helpless tries

"Welcome me, my slave to blind to see
These voices that take you to misery
I'm the tempter that leads your way
But you're the source that you betray"
