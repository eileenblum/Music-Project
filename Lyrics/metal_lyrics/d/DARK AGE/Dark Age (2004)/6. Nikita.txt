I heard the nations are threatened by crisis
A curse from east, where the demon rises
The sin is changing the face of this earth
While we are waiting for the darkest birth 
The coming vision
Was our decision
Can it be
That all we need
Is a resistant breed
The harming cast
Flourishing fast
Can it be
That this is it
The final exit

No
There is no way out of guilt when you free the deceiver
So wont you, wont you please spread disease Nikita
No
There is no way out of guilt when you kill a believer
So wont you, wont you please spread disease Nikita

Politics shaped the organic statement
A lifeless planet as a final judgement
The sickness in me is the sickness in you
The bitter response to the things that we do

Angry virus free us please
From the scum on this earth with a painful disease
Angry Nikita if this won't be
We will destroy ourselves one day else you will see
