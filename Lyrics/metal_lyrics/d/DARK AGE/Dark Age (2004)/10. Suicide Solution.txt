[Ozzy Osbourne cover]

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker 
Suicide is slow with liquer 
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows 
Then it floods away tommorows 
Away tommorows

Evil thoughts and evil doings 
Cold, alone you hang in ruins 
Thought that you'd escape the reaper 
You can't escape the master keeper

'Cos you feel life's unreal, and you're living a lie 
Such a shame, who's to blame, and you're wondering why 
Then you ask from your cask, is there life after birth 
What you saw can mean hell on this earth 
Hell on this earth

Now you live inside a bottle 
The reaper's travelling at full throttle 
It's catching you, but you don't see 
The reaper's you, and the reaper is me 

Breaking laws, knocking doors 
But there's no one at home 
Made your bed, rest your head 
But you lie there and moan 
Where to hide, suicide is the only way out 
Don't you know what it's really about 

Wine is fine, but whiskey's quicker 
Suicide is slow with liquer 
Take a bottle, drown your sorrows 
Then it floods away tomorrows
