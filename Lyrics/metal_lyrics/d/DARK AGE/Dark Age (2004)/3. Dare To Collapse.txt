Can everyone please go for a while
I need to breath
I have to face my darkest trial
Killing me from underneath
For too long have I faced my limits
And failed to see
That all I love and call my substance
Has become my worst enemy

Steady is this run-
A run that rewrites the episodes,
Without a trace and a trusting hand for guidance
A pact with tears
Infected though all inner fears
I give up, to face the one and only chance

To go and break down..., go and break down..., go and break down... 
Until I am calling

Dare to reach out for truth
If you dare to collapse
Inside lie the circles of these endless turnings
Dare to speak out the truth
While daring a relapse
Inside die the circles of these senseless yearnings

Can anyone please stay for a while
I need a relief
I cannot face another trial
Killing me and the things I believe

Ready for the run-
A run that rewrites the higher modes,
Without a face and a devoting sense for guidance
Effects on me
And flourishes to misery
Again have turned spoken words into silence
I am too tired to see
What you made out of me
I have died to feel 
But what it takes is too real 
I can't take it
So why not break it
I can't take it
So I wont make it... 

I turn my face down, I turn my face down, I turn my face down
Until I am falling
