Turn the lights down
Cause there is nothing more to see
Watching the days drown
Inside a world that is no place to be

I have learned to cry silently
But have I earned to die so painfully

Carry the cross low
I have some wounds to show
Don't feel all right
Lost the sense out of sight 

It meant to be this way
Fading day by day
So wont you miss me here today
I am already on my way

It will hurt until tomorrow
But never end the sorrow
It will take me home tonight
And fade the light

This is my own darkness...
