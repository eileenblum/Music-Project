I can't deny
that my heart is searching
And with every try
I can feel my hatred burning
What makes a believer
when it takes no faith to be free
Is there a deceiver
leading us into alacrity

Where are you?

We can't find our freedom
within this agony
Even if this faith could heal
It are we who suffer again
We don't need no freedom
cause we pay for hypocrisy
Even you know in the end
We who suffer again

You should be a saviour
Once on earth to bleed for the weak
Try Modern behaviour
for a world that cannot seek
This fallen belief I know
has no prospect
We will never achieve to grow
If carry on hiding
what is deep inside of us
