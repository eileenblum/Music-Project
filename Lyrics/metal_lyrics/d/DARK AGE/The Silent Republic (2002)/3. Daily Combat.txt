I am a stone cold rocker
With his flames in my eyes
A bloody motherfucker
Who can't take no more lies
I kill just by the way that I feel
My head is up high
Never will I kneel
I am a hater

I was born to fight in a daily combat
But I found my way to a better day
All that you give will be all that you get
This time it is too late for regret

Were you born to fight a daily combat
I have found a way to a better day
All that you that give will all that you get
This time it is too late for regret

The cause for this war
Is hard to realize
I know that you can't take it
Your silence means demise
My thrill will be your overkill
Bad luck to the world of fuck

I am a hater

You don't know how I feel inside of me
You don't know how it feels to be free
You are just a lifeless shell
So worse, even life can tell
