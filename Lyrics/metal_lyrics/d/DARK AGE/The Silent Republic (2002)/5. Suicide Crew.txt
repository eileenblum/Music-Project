Save your souls
We are a new kind of nightmare
Your falling children
Born to show that we don't care
Helpless protest with a weak intention
is our gift to achieve attention
Our loaded guns need no faked liberty
Will blow away our painful misery
Welcome the ones
That know the only way
To show this world
How to get away

We are the Suicide Crew

Save our souls
This is a god damned nightmare
Where are the ones who show
that they do care?
We kill our cries with a wrong intention
Our broken dreams need
the world's attention
Ignored and seen as useless casualties
can't be the way to better possibilities
Accept the truth
This is our destiny
We are the youth
Awaiting your reality ...
