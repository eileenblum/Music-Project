It is the same old path to nowhere
Built from the hands of deceit
Tenacity has failed to repair
the ruins of our hearts
That once had been complete

This is the time to carry our pride
This is the time to believe and to reunite

It's now or never
We can make this dream last forever
All we need is in us
Let it all out to be free
It's now or never
We can make our selves come together
All we are is in us
Let it all out to be free

These inner walls are insecure
Complicity calls, unmasks us fragile
We got free in us what is pure
A revelation that is not hostile

This is the time to show all our pride
This is the time to stand up and to reunite

We play dark and heavy Metal
Born to fight this abrasive battle
We are a kind of new impulse
Your engine to achieve allied results
