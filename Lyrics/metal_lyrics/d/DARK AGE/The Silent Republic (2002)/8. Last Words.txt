Today I have lost my inner fight -
time for me to go
Innocence aches if you are angry inside
I want you to know
that injustice broke my inner defence
and now I am here to take the consequence

Your false and cold society
are dreary minds and mean nothing to me
I can't go any further -
I have reached the point of no return

These are my last words
to a world I will leave behind
These are my last words
to the ones I cannot find

Bury my heart under a different sun
with a light that is brighter
Shining on me to show everyone
here lies no fighter
Just a dreamer born with a crystal soul
inside of a shell
I am Falling deep into a bottomless hole
Awaiting the end that only time could tell

The sources are cold reality,
careless minds that mean nothing to me
I can't go any further
I have reached the point of no return
