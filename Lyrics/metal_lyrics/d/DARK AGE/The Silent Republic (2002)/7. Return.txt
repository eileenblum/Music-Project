Faith falls with its sons
Believers:
Beware of an new probation
The same source sets free the ones
who find bliss in their malevolent determination
Terror to achieve control
What a sinful proof for an ill natured soul
A culture has been forced to stagnate
Empty hope has spread the seeds of hate

Is this the return?

Stay, stay away from me

Stay away
I can't take this one more day
I don't want to give this one more try
A holy war needs a faithless lie

A return of an old damnation
tries to rearrange the coming of time
Close to a situation
known to the world as the mediaeval crime
This is a modern crusade
caused by the decadence of a nation
A conflict with a need to degrade
the greatness of our fragile civilisation

This is the Return

This threat is deeper
It is inside of us all
