The winds of grace inside of me
have turned their directions to set me free
Hidden powers are now reborn
I am immortal, will present you my storm!

Go on, march on and rule in silence
Weakness and fear are stronger than violence
We are the ones, the devil's breed
Together as one, we are the Storm!

Welcome oh thou majestic night
You enchant me and darkish the night
The powers of weakness last eternal 
while human greed is ephemeral!
