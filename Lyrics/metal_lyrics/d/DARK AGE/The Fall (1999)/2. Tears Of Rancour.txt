Deary, dubious existence,
preposterous embodiment!
Still sullen are the lights of life...
Behold then my rancour, my tears 
soaking your surface bloody earth!

Am I the one, the one I fear 
or am I the one and only atmosphere?
I am lost, trapped in time...
My life is a star which does not shine!

Sumptuous elusive significance, 
preposterous embodiment!
Time to believe!
Into the hearts which have died,
into the souls which have tried,
into the tears we have cried 
The tears of rancour!

Forever dying
Forever tryingForever crying 
the tears of rancour!

Alone I walk through ephemeral time,
to enlighten a quest 
once called life...
