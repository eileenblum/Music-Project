The dreams are darker, darker then before
I know my pain is forever
This mortal world I will leave in silence
I will cry and break as ever
But is this what I have been longing for?
And in this dreams, 
they leave me alone and drown my emotions
What a preposterous humanity!
I have lost the will to live, to give, to feel your lies
I will close my eyes and know for sure...

I do see more than you...
I do feel more than you...
I suffer more than you...
I will hate more than you...

Fuck you, my life won't be forever
My weakness breads mortality
My room is empty, cold and silent
And the sun won?t shine again...
