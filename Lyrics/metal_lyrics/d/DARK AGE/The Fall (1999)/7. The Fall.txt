Burn...
Never forget this moments in autumn
Memories which taught us to watch and to feel
As I am falling alone
In this age of emptiness

I dreamed that ashes dried my mourning tears
and dust covered my skin
The sins of mankind so silent
covered with blood and with tears
Creation, experience the fools of thousand years
The rules of time counting our days,
choosing the fall, that shall burn...

We are falling tonight,
shadows become a light of fear and sorrow
Tonight you will see that hate and love
will be one with reality
No man's existence has failed
and has lost it's pride, it's smile, it's cries...

"Never Forget this moments in autumn
Oh, memories which taught us to watch and to feel
As I am falling alone in this age of emptiness
Again I am falling alone
I should be alive
I feel like I hate you
I will...
I will kill you..."

We were falling that night, 
shadows became a light of fear and sorrow
That night you could see
that hate and love were one with reality
I see the fall and curse you all
This life means pain to me
Come on god: end this existence for me...

White dove your wings are burning ...
