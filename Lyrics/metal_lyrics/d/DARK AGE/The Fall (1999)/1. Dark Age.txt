Smile at me -
you were the one who taught me to see
Deep inside I knew I was right - 
A world like this we should fight
Remember me -
Life is pain within your sanity
Your world will fall forever 
and drown in darkness forever...

Rock with me -
let us dream beyond reality
Discover the dark, discover the night, 
feel the atmosphere and refuse the light
Die for me!
Your weakness will feed falsity...
True hearts, which burn forever,
are lights in darkness forever...

Dry my tears, my blood, my wounds
Heal my soul, my life, my pain
Is this your answer to those of the light?
Or a tribute for disbelief to those of the night...
I could be a sun, which should light us the way
I could be a god, who should leave us today
But deep inside we all know this rage
Good bye, I have left you,
I am the Dark Age...

Dry my tears, my blood, my wounds
Heal my soul, my life, my pain
Discover the dark, discover the night
Enlighten the game of life
Behold the powers of the Dark Age!
