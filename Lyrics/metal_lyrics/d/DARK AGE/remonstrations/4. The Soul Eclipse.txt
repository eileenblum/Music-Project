Follow me into the soul eclipse
Into the hearts of the blackened minds so lonely
Memories collide into eternal fate
In a dark autumn night
Between the thoughts of desperate cries
And through the shadows of a past that dies
We search for a place, a feeling called silence
Dreams that let us fly
Ride, ride into the heart of the winter
Into the heart of the north

My soul awakes in a forest
dreaming in winter sheets
Shadows moving around me
My dream internally bleeds
The wind is blowing cold
Carrying their cries
Cries that break the silence
In an autumn night

Follow me into the soul eclipse
Into the heart of the nothern forest so mighty
The escape from anger and insanity
A new life that we set free
Between the thoughts of desperate cries
We search for the reasons that support the lies
The new age is lost, the time is right
To welcome your eternal fight
