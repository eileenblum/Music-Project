Feary dreams while a feary night
The memories you have to fight
Don't be a fool when it's time to die
This is the place where we all have to cry

Insomnia!

What do you feel when you march through the streets
Can't you hear the alien heartbeat
I don't wonder why you can't sleep at night
If I had your mind I would go suicide
