As the blood runs cold through my veins
And the time of guilt contains
I release my anger to be free
Proclamation of a parmount god
With a symbol of destruction
Invading our century

Dark times, setting fire
Evil games - angel heart
Heaven will burn in flames
Angel heart can't you see
That the time has come
To release your hate
And to feel the pain
That was caused by the light
