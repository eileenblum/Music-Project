Life passes, as I am mortal
Time is not left eternally
Your erotic spirit and entire beauty
Makes my self believing in an ungod

Doom Like Lady
Doom Like Lady -
I need you

I can't express myself
Can't make the people see and believe in me
And then I dream of you and begin to see
That life is not worth human brutality

Doom Like Lady
Doom Like Lady -
I need you 

In my soul I feel an eternal ache
When will we finally awake?
