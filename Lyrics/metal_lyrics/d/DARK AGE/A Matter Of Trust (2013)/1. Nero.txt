"Nero"...

I'm facing the days
with trying to feel
nothing is over
nothing is real
while searching for ways 
out of the deep
how this world can be a place to breath again

And I begin to wonder
how life could get away from me
with all I couldn't save
silence the only way

Since you've been gone
I try to arrange
with nothing but fear
I don't want the change
emptiness haunts
at day and by night
And how on earth will I be able to
feel again?

And when I am gone
you'll have nothing to fear
just silence that knows
that I will not be here
I'll leave you in hope
to remember the days
we walked through the light
until we had to part ways...
