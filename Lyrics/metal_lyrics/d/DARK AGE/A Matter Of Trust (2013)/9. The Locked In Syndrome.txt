It's been inside you
It's been around you
It's been here a thousand years waiting inside
And I have warned you
Now I have come for you
I came a long way to overrun
You
To overrun
You

It came from thousand places with nothing but a change
I read it in their faces
Life can feel so strange
It over-drove my borders
Nothing I could do
But hiding from the crazy
Hiding from you

And now I'm locked inside
The key is out of sight
But with denying
Life still doesn't feel alright
Back then I chose to fight
Fight all the things that might
Hoping the days without it
Won't come again

Now I'm torn without you
I'm the one alone
All the things I've been through
Have turned my eyes to stone
Why won't they believe me
This world has left me dead
I wish that I could break free
Be me instead

And now I'm locked inside
The key is out of sight
But with denying
Life still doesn't feel alright
Back then I chose to fight
Fight all the things that might
Hoping the days without it
Won't come again

So rest your call

How come their faces look all the same
When life a million costs
I've been asked for a trillion - lost
Hold me on
The ratio's called a desperate time

I have seen their faces
All the time
Without eyes
We are a million faces
Without traces
And now we're locked inside
The key is out of sight
But with denying
Life still doesn't feel alright
Back then we chose to fight
Fight all the things that might
Hoping the days without it
Won't come again

How come their faces look all the same
How come their faces look all the same
How come their faces look all the same
How come their faces look all the same
