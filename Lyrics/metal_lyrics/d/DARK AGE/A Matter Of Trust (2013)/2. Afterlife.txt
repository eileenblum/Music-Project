You say you want
your end to be chosen free
another death
to defend your honesty
but no one else
will know the answer
you fall with lies
so why not fight till the end

We can fix it
if we try
I know your better days
and there are better ways
to start an afterlife

You say it has
nothing to do with me
we die alone
without any sanity
so tell me please
what will it show
Oh, think of me
so please please don't go

So what do you want to show
where do you want to go
what do want to hide
what do you want from life

It's like a badge
around the neck
it seems your oath is all ready
for attack
