Inhuman emanations rancidly erupts
Bloated veins inflame

In reeking voyage of cysts and gore
Suppurating merciless spasmos
Boiling infernal necrolatry

Veins craving infernal savagery
Mauled nerves encysts and torns apart

In blistering death rage

Incessant storming heartbeating
Bone sawing puncturing pleasure
As my vomit drowns criminally insane
Putrid dosage of abominating slaughter
My desire and diabolic lust
As on turfs crepitating disgust

Flying insanities blur my senses
As vomit flows burning my own

Killing, hacking, destroying
Swallowing all kind of diseased crap

Wolfen instincts prevail
When boiling vomit is running through my veins
Explore my rancid faecal depths
Dreadful tighten foetid fry
Ripping and sharped nailed sty

Boiling vomit through my veins [x2]

Obscene absurd intense pleasure
When my nerves fulfill in purulence

Stiff and cold punzing tenderness

Invades my cremated veins
Blasphemic sensations of the dead
Are my only way to exist
Soggy blobs of edemic maggoty excresence
Emaciated intraspinal carnivorous encyst

Wolfen instinct prevail
When boiling vomit is running through my veins
Explore my rancid faecal depths

Dreadful
Enlighting the swarming incubation
In skin
Nerves and bones
