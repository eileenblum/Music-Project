Bloodthirst I only feel
Melting my rancid emotions of squirm
Sharpening my blades, neverending fullfill
Of this inhume pleasure to kill

Macabre realms of mental ill
Torrid pleasance maiming the skin
Enemized corrupted your rancorous sewage
Maim the skin through drainage

Trash and hack through the steaming avulsion
Necromantic psychedelic high convulsion
Macabre realms of inhuman bestiality
Mazy and vulgar cankerous monstrosity

Frenziedly inhaling this unpleasant reek
Gouging to satisfy my wasted teeth
Culinary carrion purulent rush
Splitting and splattering innards in husk

In this demented lust

Incinerating shocks of ecstasy
Blobs impure blistering fantasy
Curves this necrosanctity
Blurs my conception of insanity

Blessed repulsive initiation
For the most rotted of the deaths
