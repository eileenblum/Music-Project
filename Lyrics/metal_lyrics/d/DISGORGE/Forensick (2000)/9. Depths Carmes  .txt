As I continue exposing
Your incides
Lacking all my senses
Curving shoving and raping
Flyes in the air
Spherical forms I scan
Bites and flows masticate
Ascites infect eject mumps
I need to be in the red stream
Beyond all bounds
Large vaccine acute
Soft tissue swelling
As I constantly arise
On setting my dementia
Abscess squirm liquefy
Your body after six months
Blenchs munched pointed peg
Cortic ensamble rips
Like your most red drip
In your bizarre depths
I drown dark scattered relics
Sliced stiffness
Cold racking and
Randomly sectioning
I see and consume your pustules
In haemorraghic destructive rash
Cutting and smashing
To make you ash
I absorpt puzzle members
My predilect bitting meat
Edemic forms blobs
Smears my disgust
Yawnud site snaped
With maggits sty
Corrupted leads elation
Slime grows and consume
Pica continues grims
Like my epitaphyal feast
Sawing and peeling
My starve needs from the womb
Licks treated spine mump
Carnivore drainage
Spinal pleasure fills
Performed spool eject
Sewed dissect flu
Like my flucteated slight
My starve needs from the womb
Insides the carnest stills
In your depths I still consume
