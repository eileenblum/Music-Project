A special plan to bring about the destruction of the church
And the annihilation of Christ.

I presented a group of twelve men to him as confidants
Supposed followers of his teachings and helpers of his word.

In the conspiracy to kill Jesus

A special plan to bring about the destruction of the church
And the annihilation of Christ.

By the theft of my name.

And you all now know the truth of I your maker
And your once leader
And the horror I will bring down upon all of mankind.
