Purity shadowed with blasphemy
Worthy of unholy doings.
Blood spills through your followers
Preaching your false word.

Delivered from sin, all has lost meaning.
Telling lies of impure ways. A blind religion.
I desecrate your kingdom
All those follow stand before me.

Begging for salvation in tongues
They now kneel and pray to me
Cast down from above injecting Jerusalem
With hatred abomination of all.

Devour the preachers of holiness
Proclaim myself as god. Denying thy summons
I plague the rejoiced to damnation
Manifest thyself unto me, crucify, then disembowel
The inner circle of Apostles with suffering.

Visions of slaughtering
The weak engaged in demonic sacrilege
Perpetual salvation, sent forth to slay
Execution of prophets, bring forth the whore
Fornicate delivering the Apostles
A mistake from god.

Extinction of twelve denying the cross
One by one they will perish like the Lord
And we shall let him see restitution is upon him
And he is ignored descending upon mortals
Projecting ourselves as disciples.

Purity shadowed with blasphemy
Worthy of unholy doings.
Blood spills through your followers
Preaching your false word.

Devour the preachers of holiness
Proclaim myself as god. Denying thy summons
I plague the rejoiced to damnation
Manifest thyself unto me, crucify, then disembowel
The inner circle of Apostles with suffering.

Visions of slaughtering
The weak engaged in demonic sacrilege
Perpetual salvation, sent forth to slay
Execution of prophets, bring forth the whore
Fornicate delivering the Apostles
A mistake from god.

Delivered from sin, all has lost meaning.
Telling lies of impure ways. A blind religion.
I desecrate your kingdom
All that follows stand before me.

Divine Suffering.
