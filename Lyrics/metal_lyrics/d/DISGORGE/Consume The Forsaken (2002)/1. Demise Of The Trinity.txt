Suffocate the only begotten one
Who casts his judgment upon those
Who oppose his false words.

Wrapping my hands around his neck,
Causing divine blood to flow through his veins
As he looks up to god, his father, his traitor.
The one who leads his son to mutilation
Turns his head from his cries
As his son begs for his life.

Sacrilege has been committed by the supreme being.
He who has created blasphemy and now orchestrates it.
He lures his son's own faithful Apostles
Mentally alters them to induce demented plans.
Remnants of a Christ shall now be vanquished
All of those who follow will be destroyed.

The Apostles now return to the church
To alter the meek ones' faith.
To despise their former Lord, his ending in stone
We will dine on his flesh and forget of his life
And of the ones just like him.

The congregation now turns on him
He knows them no more.

"Go to your Apostles, plead them for help
You can confide in them. Meet with them alone."

Sacrilege has been committed by the supreme being.
He who has created blasphemy and now orchestrates it.
The Trinity splits to devour one of its own
To begin the tribulation.

Suffocate the only begotten one
Who casts his judgment upon those
Who oppose his false words.

Wrapping my hands around his neck
Causing divine blood to flow through his veins
As he looks up to god, his father, his traitor.

In their clutches Christ is helpless.
The Apostles look down with no remorse.
Tortured, then bled and beaten severely
He questions his fate.
"Your Lord and your father has asked for your life
And for the Demise of the Trinity."
