Cast down from heaven
By god archangels demons one and the same
We are mortals of fate
Seeking the divine order
Beware my wrath

Revenge the revelation is coming
One by one we feast on souls
All sinners must die
The fall of Babylon

No man can resist my spirit
Seeking the divine order....

Revelation is coming
The fall of Babylon
Revelation is coming
The fall of Babylon
Revelation is coming

Silent lambs slaughtered
Then fed to the clones
Innocence devoured then defiled
Ripe virgin skin
Ripe virgin meat

Risen above to dismember
The congregation

Hollowing unconsciously
Seven heads and ten horns
Abolished then cremated
Lord bears the loins mouth....x3

Hollowing unconsciously
Seven heads and ten horns
Abolished then cremated

Slaughtered lambs
Shredded for consumption
Thrust the sickle
Into the cavities of the heavens
Angels wings torn....

Revelations are coming
The fall of Babylon
Revelations are coming
Silent lambs slaughtered XVIII
