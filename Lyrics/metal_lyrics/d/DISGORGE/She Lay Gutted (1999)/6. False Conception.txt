False false false
Conception

False conception immaculate lie
Impaling her flesh with every stab
Bleeding I remove all from within

Chocking on her own blood praying
For help her breathing
Is constricted I rip the fetus
&gt;From her own womb
Cutting the umbilical cord placing it
In her rectum
Hanging inverted she watches
Her unborn be decapitated

Desecrating her eyes roll back
Losing all bodily fluids
I devour the discharge
Burnt in effigy

Forgotten hatred still remains, deceiving lies
Embedded within internal suffering inflicts

Choking on her own blood praying
For help burnt in effigy
Screaming
False religion falls
As I stab upward
To desecrate this virgin
Bearing a child I behead
Laying in her own entrails
Praying for help as she chokes
On her feces

Jesus bow to me
Rip the fetus from the womb
Cut the life cord
Place it in the rectum
As she hangs inverted
Losing all body fluids
Devour the discharge
Arouse my erection
Fill her bloody orifice

False conception

Choking on her own blood
Breathing is constricted
I rip the fetus from her womb
Cut her cord

False conception immaculate lie
Impaling her flesh with every stab
Bleeding I remove all from within
