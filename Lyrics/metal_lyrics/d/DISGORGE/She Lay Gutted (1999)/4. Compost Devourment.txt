Longevity compendium
Layers
Of epidermis pierced then stripped

Muscles ripped then torn
Absorbing the bodies fluids

Consume on the decaying flesh
Horrid cadavers are purged with pungency

Rotting infested corpses I regurgitate

All the bodies I have
Placed in what
In what remains

A putrid coldness I fondle with the
Cavity, vomiting I tolerate the stench
Of disembowelment

Consume on the decaying flesh
Horrid cadavers are purged with pungency

A putrid coldness I fondle with the
Cavity, vomiting I tolerate the stench
Of disembowelment

Lifeless, carcass
Is forming pus
Around the severed
Entrails compost devourments
