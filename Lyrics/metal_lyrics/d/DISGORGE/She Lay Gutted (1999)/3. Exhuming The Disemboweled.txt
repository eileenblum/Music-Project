Exhuming
Exhuming the disemboweled
Soaking in intestines fluid of the dead
Stomach cut open spilling bowels red
Hollowed out cavities spawning of my seed
Silent desecration of human species

Morbid reality exhuming the disemboweled
Mutated bodies darkness shrouding
Pursuing a disease
Exhuming the disemboweled

Sifting through the innards
Malicious addiction
Ingesting the host
Malama sets in

Exhuming the disemboweled
Cavities rotting insidious deeds
Vomiting up the stomach acid
Gagging on the corpulous
Plaguing the 'fected
Awaiting grotesque

Temptation the cost I pay
No need for the purity
Suffer for acts betray Christ

Ingesting the innards agony
Torturing screaming piercing bones
Exhuming the disemboweled

Sifting through the innards
Malicious addiction
Ingesting the host
Malama sets in

I ingest intestinal track
Disemboweling the infected entrails consume
All that is removed

Tearing the wound open
Rip the torso reaching in

Hollowed out cavities
Plaguing the infected
Grotesque

Exhuming....disemboweled
Soaking in intestines fluids of the dead
Stomach cut open spilling bowels red
Hollowed out cavities spawning of my seed
Silent desecration of human species
