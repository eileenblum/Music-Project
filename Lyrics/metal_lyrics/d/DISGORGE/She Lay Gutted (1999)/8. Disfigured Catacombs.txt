Scorn as withered
Desolate catacombs
Deprived of sanctuary
Cleansing of the afflicted

Constricted the disemboweled
Leathered dermis extracted
Intentional disfiguration

Residues conforming to beget
Subservient humans hung
Pulsating fluids circulate
Bloated slabs obscure
Skeletal regions of genocide

Impenetrable darkness
Carving into reality
Reclamation of souls
Conceiving a mortality

Periodic dismemberments
Carving infants
Periodic dismemberments
Arranged bone structures
Tower over fragmented soil
Cadavers begotten
Infant shun-and mangled

Executed drawn apart
Collectively entangled body cavities
Nomadic ritual ceremonial fragments
Grotesquely decomposed

Impenetrable darkness
Carving into reality
Reclamation of souls
Conceiving a mortality

Scorn and withered
Desolate catacombs
Deprived of sanctuary
Cleansing of the afflicted

Disfigured catacombs
