Ominous, deadening cries of lost conformity
Scars of their faith have eroded faces... of ruin, covenant of... blasphemy

Grotesquely demented sores
Exhumed the defining sound of the ancients
Their tombs disturbed; after centuries of slumber

Vile stench of insanity, sigils of torment and iniquity ruin the premonition of faith
Cause of infection derived from sin
A dawning of the covenant, naustic treachery infinite heresy commended to eternal Sacrifice,
The gods of perpetual realms angelic cries mourn this evolution,
Ancient citadels commence the earth

Scorned from the depths of nothingness,
Deadening cries of lost conformity

Vile stench of insanity; sigils of torment and iniquity ruin the premonition of faith,
Cause of infection derived from sin
Commend to eternal sacrifice; the gods of perpetual realms
Angelic cries mourn this evolution
Faces... of ruin, covenant of... blasphemy
