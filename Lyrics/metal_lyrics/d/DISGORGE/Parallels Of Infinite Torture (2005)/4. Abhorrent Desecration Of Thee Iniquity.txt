In crypts of eternal; catastrophic butcherings
Decrepit formations arise... structures of creations,
Fall to ruin upon this unblessed salvation....

The altars so holy; now begins to decompose
Mutilating breed arise, beneath the infamy
Bodies descend in swarms, prey to be consumed in the
Putrid cavers below purifying the cavities of the... exiled... existence

Uncreating: the orb of light shallow burial for the corpse of humanity,
In crypts of hatred in torment... shadows...
Excrete... abhorrent desecration of thee iniquity
Exhuming to the nocturnal; deliverance to desecration

Their prayers so feeble, unknown to redemption structures of creation,
Altars once so holy, drained of blood; they decompose beneath the infamy
To devour the fallen angels they consume they are no longer dormant
All shall perish beneath creation the ruins of creation

Altars now unholy drained of blood; they awaken above the infamy
To devour the fallen angels
They consume they are no longer dormant
Now they shall perish into nothingness
