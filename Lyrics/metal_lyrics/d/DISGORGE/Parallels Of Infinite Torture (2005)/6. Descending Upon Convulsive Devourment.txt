Descending upon convulsive... devourment
Visions of the war descend... they will be...
Extracted for the thirst... from the catacombs...
With spawns of hate; devourment

Forgotten filth, revile and devour... beyond divinity
The infected and fallen descend upon a dawning
Of vengeance, unleashed unleashed to infuriate the
XUL Gates released, swarm conjured give birth to this emptiness...

Goring their prey Darkened spells:
Angels: Invoking the swarm to the immortal Throne hear the hymns of severed acrimony
Requiem of the deceased; harmony awakens the hate

Horror to the prisoners of the flesh beckoning the Xul;
Formulas of infinity the fallen descend upon,
A dawning of sufferance exiled dementias,
Arise and Destroy the gods that rule.... darkened spells: uncreate the flesh,
Which blinds this torment fallen angels: invoking the swarm to the immortal feast

Repugnant are the apparitions; behold the uncreation
Imprisoned are the words of faith,
The angels are devoured

Descending upon... convulsive... devourment
Visions of war descend... they will be.... extracted for the thirst...
From the catacombs... with spawns of hate
