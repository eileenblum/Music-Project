They have slept for centuries
Rising to enthrone... the... abominations
Realm of decay, malignant stench slowly escapes
From the sufferance below

Mutilated servants of a truthless god... god...
Awaken they begin to thirst the blood
Of what is holy
And reclaim the throne... of a beheaded messiah...

Thrones of blood
They shall perish
Visions of butchery, their eyes begin to bleed...
Penance of this cleansing

Born to indigenous sacrilege
Awaiting the invocation forgotten scriptures
Covenant of the loathing oppressors of the plague

For they are seven; larvae of the ancients
Unborn as a cyst of creation
Defecated on the beliefs of man

Thrones of blood... they all shall perish
Awaken they begin to thirst the blood
Of what is holy
And reclaim the throne... of a beheaded messiah...

They have slept for centuries; purification
Of the parallels

Enthroned.... abominations
