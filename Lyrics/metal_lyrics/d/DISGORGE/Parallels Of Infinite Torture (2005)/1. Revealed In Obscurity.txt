Devouring the divine, beyond mortal resurrection
Impure in the nucleus of Creation,
Condemned Visions awaken to devour the flesh of the fallen
Seeds of the apocalypse; forgotten in this realm

Unholy grace of Obscurity
They... shall... be... suffocated... in his blood
Suffer... endless pestilence; waiting... the endless feast
Of the false scriptures, revocation of the inverted...

Embracing the immaculate
Obscure visions revealed, violently dismembering
Revelations of mortal sin
While nothingness slithers, into inverted minds...

Revealed in obscurity
Unfolding of genesis, is in order, in ruined shrines,
Of unholiness, they gave praise to a demised trinity
Suffer... the pestilence; awaiting... the endless feast

Revealed in obscurity, wrath of the defiled...
Forgotten in this realm, they shall be suffocated
Banishment of false messiah
Your god has been exiled

Embracing the immaculate
Horror to the prisoners of flesh
All is now revealed in obscurity
Obscure visions revealed, violently dismembering

Revelations of mortal sin
