Endless are the screams of incompetence
Abolished by the plague of conformity
They weep as truth is acknowledged
Obliteration of Ancient Rituals
Eternal... Sufferance...
Visions beyond defamation
Blistering carcass of Ungodly Ruin
The offerance of hatred, Legions of Carrion
Horrific Trinity is Demised, wretched Incantations
Torment of disfigurement
Condemned to Sufferance... Malediction
Slowly they will compel... Death without dying
Ageless they will be... imprisoned to catacombs
Of endless Sufferance... Eternal
Orchestration of Immaculate torture
Conquered by the element of wrath
Malediction... Decomposing innards
Slowly they will compel... Life without living
Orchestration of Immaculate torture
Conquered by the element of wrath
Mutilation upon their corpses
Eucharist of the wretched disease
Beheading of the Prophets
Fallen Kingdom, Angels of the light imprisioned...
Decomposing bodies; abolished by the sins of
Heretics They weep as the living are cursed
Obliteration of Ancient Rituals
The belief Resurrection, Eternal Sufferance
