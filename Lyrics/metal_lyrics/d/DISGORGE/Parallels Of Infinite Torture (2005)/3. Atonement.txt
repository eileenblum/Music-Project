God's angels had no grace...
Rotting in angelic flesh, stench of heaven burning
Gorging on the savior, rebirth through atonement
Secreting the filth that fills the crypts

Swallowed soul vomits forth
Spines are severed and collected
Torn apart from the corpses
Bodies left decaying, beneath the rotting sky

Their detached heads, impaled upon stakes
Watching their savior die...
He is no longer, healer of the sick
Perished through atonement

Condemned by his father
To perish with the lepers; immaculate punishment
Dethroned by his prophets;
Decaying false testament in a paradox of abandonment

Atonement of misconception
Death through endless suffering
No after life deliverance scripture of defiance
Rotting in angelic flesh, stench of heaven burning

Gorging on the savior; consuming on his innards
Life no longer everlasting,
Perished through atonement
