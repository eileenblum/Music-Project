God has condemned his creation; forever perished
From the light disemboweled carcasses, drape the
Altars of hate they are left... to asphyxiate...
A pity existence... for what was once so holy

The horizons they suffer the dammed
Oppressed suffering, blood fills the heavens
Testament of the divine rapture blessed prayers...
For the murdered centuries... of defiled faith; decay before the abomination

Severed heads of the angels... now unveiled in the chapel impaled
Bodies... stench of endless infamy severe cruelty...
Beyond mortal redemption and betrayal... to the grace of holiness pierced... with bones;

Blood fills the cavities sacrifice to the failure of hypocrisy pierced... with bones;
Blood fills the cavities, asphyxiate...
The oppressed with torture and confinement of Salvation shadow... of the crucifix;
Cover the bodies of humanity offerings...
To their demise innards of angels hang upon the altars of macabre a pity existence...

For what was once so holy the horizons they suffer the vile oppressed suffering;
Blood fills the heavens testament of divine rapture blessed prayers...
For the murdered Severed heads of the angels...
Hang in the chapel of sin putrid stench.... of everlasting Infamy severe cruelty...
Beyond mortal redemption god has condemned his creation;

Forever perished from the light disemboweled carcasses, drape the altars of hate...
They are left... suffocating... pierced... with bones; blood fills the cavities sacrifice...
To the failure of hypocrisy pierced... with bones torture... and... confinement of salvation
