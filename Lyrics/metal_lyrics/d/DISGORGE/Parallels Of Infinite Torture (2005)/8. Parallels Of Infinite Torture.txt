Summarily tortured; atrocities of unfathomed
Recollection of ominous butcherings beheadings
Before the throne the blessed lie... suffering,
Indulgence by butchery the flowing life... within...

Pierced upon tragedy their eyes no longer see...
Deliverance evisceration... beyond disfigurement
Tortured by their holy desires... now they lay deformed,
Bloody mangled torsos their corpses are devoured... by malice intent nothingness remains

Everlasting disgust angels hang by their entrails blessed sacrifice summarily tortured;
Parallels of infinite torture passage of annulment; ominous disembowelment
The flowing life.... within.... congealed upon tragedy beheadings before the throne
Butchered by.... your god... in torment... exode...

The deliverance of maelstrom a creation that has been cursed...
Parallels of infinite torture, torture of existence their souls diminish;
Bodies become frail Degraded to nothingness beheadings, upon the throne they are lifeless,
Indulgence by butchery the flowing blood within... released deliverance of sacrilege;

Blood of the enemy thirst of continuous infamy severed from reality
Their eyes no longer see.... torture within;
Dark paradox ingesting the most
Holy Parallels of Infinite Torture
