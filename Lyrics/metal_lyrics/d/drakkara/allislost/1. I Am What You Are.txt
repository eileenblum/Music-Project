Spending all, all of time
I will show that all of you will become mine
On this night murderous intentions grow
I will let, let none of you go alone unchained

I am what you are you are me
That is what you will live with everyday
I am all there is you will submit to what I say
Just do it I am what you are and you are mine
All will do as I say in time

Need not fight and let darkness grow
I am alive, forgotten no more
On this night murderous intentions grow
Adhere my task and you will not decay alone

Do not despair I will give you a new life
In death and in your decay
Do not despair I will give you a new life
In death and in your decay
