Growing hate in my mind today fall, fall into darkness
We cannot see the light carry me on your hands
The fall, the fall of mankind in her hands
We will meet falter now it will be soon in our eyes
All will fall before her feet unguarded weapon eternal death

Who will adhere, this is all we have and once again I am under this new sky
And there I will adhere all that I can and of my will
And cry for we will fall forward again
Nothing in this world can cover the sound of her pain
That we will discover soon she will perish all man
All will fall onto her hands unguarded weapon returns with force
