To look upon her face is to accept death now
How all of these men have died for you without a single word from your mouth
How one woman can bring such a plague of death to us all
Now I may die because of you but I will die with my pride
And if it is my end my end I will make it such an end

Your poison makes men abide and serve you until their deaths
All over this âsanctityâ you will not win over me
And if it is my end my end I will make it such an end
Death will come to all of us in this place our demise!
