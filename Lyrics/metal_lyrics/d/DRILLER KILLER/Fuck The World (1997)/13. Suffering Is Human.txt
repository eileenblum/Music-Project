The world so fucked and brutal dark, the mind so bloody weak
Let feelings rule and you go down, ice reigns, hell unbound

Suffering is human - Do you (really) want to live?

Without struggle, man is no longer man
Born to combat, agony, itÂ´s time to make a stand

ThereÂ´s no way out of life until youÂ´re out of it...
