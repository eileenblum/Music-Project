Beyond understanding, without excuse
Beyond forgiveness, I put out my fuse
ItÂ´s hard to live with a will to die
When every promise is a potential lie

To erase millions wouldnÂ´t be a loss
Fuck yourself, thereÂ´s too many of us
ItÂ´s hard to live like a fucking whore
Laughter does not deform my face anymore

When thereÂ´s no more room in hell
The dead shall walk the earth... and they do
