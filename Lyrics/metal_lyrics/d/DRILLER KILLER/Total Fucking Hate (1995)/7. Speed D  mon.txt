King of the hill, feelinÂ´ fine
Talking too much, IÂ´ve had my line
Rivers of sweat down my neck
Chewing my lips like a fuckinÂ´wreck

Speed dÂ´mon - nowhere to go but down
Speed dÂ´mon - how long til I hit the ground?

A sucker for your bag, bag of trixx
Candyman give me my kixx
Face the mirror, it wont do (me) no harm
Fuck that shit, put it in my arm

Speed dÂ´mon - nowhere to go but down
Speed dÂ´mon - how long til I hit the ground?

I do my shit, I donÂ´t give a fuck
Practice what you preach, even if it suck...

Speed dÂ´mon - nowhere to go but down
Speed dÂ´mon - how long til I hit the ground?
