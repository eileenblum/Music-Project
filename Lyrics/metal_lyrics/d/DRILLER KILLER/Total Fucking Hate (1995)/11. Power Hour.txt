Dressed in uniforms, skulls on their caps
TheyÂ´re on the prowl, now donÂ´t you collapse
Remember the years 39-45, the lowest race tried to stay alive
(I lead u into victory, weÂ´ll be the only race soon, canÂ´t u see
IÂ´m the leader, I gotta be, coz I lead insanity)

Age - eye - tea - ell - ea - are

With the big A at the wheel, they sat on the gas
Marching through cities, a massacre mass
People backing him up all along, digging those graves, thereÂ´s nothing wrong
Trained to torment, they were the champs
Working overtime in the ss camps

Hit the shower - power hour
Nowhere to run, why bother regret
ItÂ´s already done...
