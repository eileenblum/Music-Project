Bonded by blood, a united force
Angels of hell, thereÂ´s no remorse
Big brotherÂ´s watching, every night nÂ´ day
The shadow riders are here to stay

Ride as one - Ruled by none

Disciples unbound where ever u are
Knights in armour, prepared for war
Hair is blowing in the cold wind
Summon the troops, the system canÂ´t win

Ride as one - Ruled by none
