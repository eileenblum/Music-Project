I feed on hate, thatÂ´s why I create
The shit I do, instead of killing you
But gimme a reason... IÂ´ll re-arrange your face.. mind.. life

In a split second I kick your arse
Make you bleed, leave scars
But gimme a reason... IÂ´ll re-arrange your face.. mind.. life

My lifeÂ´s a mess nÂ´ I couldnÂ´t care less
I steal your breath and become your death
You gave me a reason...
