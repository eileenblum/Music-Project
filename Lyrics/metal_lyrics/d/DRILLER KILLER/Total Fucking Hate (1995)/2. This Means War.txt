In battle there is no law, or so they say
I roll the dice nÂ´break you twice, my way
Say no more... this means war

The enemy faceless, still everywhere
Your graves nameless, IÂ´ll do my share
Say no more... this means war

Led to believe everythingÂ´s alright
Chatterbox, join the crowd, get outta my sight
Say no more... this means war
