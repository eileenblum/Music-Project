Your fucking comments ainÂ´t worth a dime
Save your beliefs, stop wasting my time
Black, white, yellow or red
When the buttonÂ´s pushed weÂ´ll all be dead

Water nÂ´ flesh... Skin nÂ´ bones

Dressed in a sheet, disguised in a hood
I know what you never understood

Strike - all down / Strike - none to go

WeÂ´re in this together, today - not forever
Your ancient tales wonÂ´t prevail
