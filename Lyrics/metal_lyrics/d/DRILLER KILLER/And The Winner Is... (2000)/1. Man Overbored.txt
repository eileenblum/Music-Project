ThereÂ´s nothing to look forward to
I never believed in you (the future)
Maybe there was a reason to exist
Watching the chaos, being pissed off

I shat upon your policy
9 - 5 was not for me
I sucked the state for what it was worth
IÂ´m one of those who fell from earth

Restless Â´n bored... Man overbored
