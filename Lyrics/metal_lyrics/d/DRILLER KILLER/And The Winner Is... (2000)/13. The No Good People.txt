WeÂ´re the ugly people, the ones that wonÂ´t be cloned
We got too many defects, theyÂ´ll leave us alone
Wherever thereÂ´s masters, there will be slaves
NothingÂ´s changed except the caves

WeÂ´re the no good people, The ones that canÂ´t afford
To travel out of misery And to be blessed by your lord
WeÂ´re the so called people, or so it used to be
If you aint got nothing, then you are nothing... not in this society
