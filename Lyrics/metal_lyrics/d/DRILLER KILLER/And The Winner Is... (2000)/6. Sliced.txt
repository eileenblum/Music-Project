IÂ´m whatÂ´s left of life, about to fill you up
You had your reasons to put me out
And you will never stop
AS the slaughtered one, you have to do me good
Might be contagious, make you sick
Just like I should...

Slice me, dice me, to me itÂ´s all the same
Skin me, fry me, donÂ´t let me die in vain

Grab a juicy part of me, my life is yours
You see x-mas time is jolly good
I wish you could be me...
