You want me to think thereÂ´s a future
You want me to believe
You want me to support your vision
All bullshit up your sleeve

Count me out
I am no part of this
I wont take part of that
Count me out

Cities are burning with anger and hate
And all caused by you
Sweden is burning and we are the fuel
Whatcha gonna do?

The stupidity of humanity
Goes on and on for all eternity
