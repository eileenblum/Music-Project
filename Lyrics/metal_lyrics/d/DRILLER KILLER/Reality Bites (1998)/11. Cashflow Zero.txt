IÂ´m checking out, canÂ´t pay my rent
Going nowhere fast, living in a tent

- Money, moneyfuckingproblem -

Like a shadow, ainÂ´t got no cash
But still not into kissing ass
...live life by the book, what a waste of time
No matter what I do IÂ´m still the local slime...

I hope for the best, IÂ´m prepared for the worst
I wonÂ´t give in, but IÂ´m ready to burst

Cashflow zero
