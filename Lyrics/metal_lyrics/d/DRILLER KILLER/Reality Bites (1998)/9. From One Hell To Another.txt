Down for the last time, shit made me go blind
Messed up the fucking lot, return to zero and look what I got

A last temptation in this hallucination
From one hell to another

Needing it like an angry dog
A kick in the arse to clear the fog
The will to be weird, and mad for being born
Life itself feels like a bloody thorn
