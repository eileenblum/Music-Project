It wonÂ´t get any better no matter what they say
Start digging your hole, itÂ´s you whoÂ´ll pay

The scum that rules - above our heads
Must be stuck with remorse until their deaths

Living in misery, todays reality
Sharing the streets with our own bloody enemy

...no fucking mystery, only pure fucking misery
Nail Â´em to the cross, shoot the fucking lot
Leave Â´em all to rot...

Eat motherfucker, the led from my gun
Then I woke up but youÂ´re not gone
YouÂ´ll pay...
