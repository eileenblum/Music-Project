You opened your foodgate and closed down the store
And spread your disease like an unrubbered whore

Doomed from the start - tear your goals apart

YouÂ´re so fucking lost, thereÂ´s nothing to say
Maybe we donÂ´t suit you but we wonÂ´t go away
(Keep your hand on your gun, donÂ´t trust anyone)
Make a move and youÂ´ll see what the fuck you mean to be
