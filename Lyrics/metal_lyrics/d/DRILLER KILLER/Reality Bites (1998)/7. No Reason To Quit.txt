Extreme noise terror between my ears
Still blows it away after all these years
Green days never last in a world full of shit
When everything sux thereÂ´s no time to quit

The spirit lives on and on
We fucked the fashion and proved them wrong

Like a pack of wolves attacking the deer
Loaded with hunger, entombed by disfear
With strings nÂ´ skins we let go of our rage
Another decade, another page
