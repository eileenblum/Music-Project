How do you know whatÂ´s right or wrong?
When bullshit rules and the truth is gone
You got your side, stay out of mine, right!
I eat you for lunch and shit you out at night

Fuck the phanatix - DonÂ´t point your finger at me
Fuck the phanatix - This is my theory

Go with the fashion flow, join the crowd
Held your banners high, scream it loud
Take your fucking beliefs and suck Ã©m dry
Dry like a desert, then fucking die

Fuck the phanatix - DonÂ´t point your finger at me
Fuck the phanatix - IÂ´ll give you anarchy

IÂ´m gonna place my head in your stupid hat
IÂ´ll stop using my brain, IÂ´ll be a copycat...
