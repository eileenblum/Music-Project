You took me to a place where IÂ´ve never been
A fucked up mess in hell that IÂ´ve never seen

Where the sun never shines...

Inside the vicious circle, I never learn
My future hell is past but still I burn
( Hero in arms )

Day by day, night after night
Minute by minute I run out of light
Dr. Feelgood donÂ´t open doors
He locks you in, fullblown force
