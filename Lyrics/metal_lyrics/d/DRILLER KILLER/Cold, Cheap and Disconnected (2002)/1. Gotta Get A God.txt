You got fucked right from the start
Gotta get a god
Then you found faith n we wonï¿½t part
Gotta get a god

God - My god - God

You got your god, I got mine
In dust I trust, shopchop a line
Guidelines to live, memorized rules
Become a phanatic, 1 suckers tool

God - your god - some god
God - why gods? - no god
Gotta get a god...

All hate &amp; war, now &amp; before
Still your highscore...
