Smoke gets to my head as my whites turn red
Fog, Iï¿½m not the only, timefucked and lonely

Thirst, no friend of mine, Iï¿½m E.T going wild
Mushed, my piece of mindï¿½s nowhere to find
Slow, another show in the temple of thoughts
Sleep, not mine to keep but fuck knows I fought

Cool, creative and damn collected?
Cold... Cold, cheap and disconnected

From hashish to ashes... in dust we crust...
The return of the pleasant fog... Iï¿½m L.I.T.D
