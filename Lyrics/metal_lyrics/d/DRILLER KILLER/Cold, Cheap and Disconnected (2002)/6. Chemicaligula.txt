I hear a jackpot coming in, top of the pops, easteuro voodoo
I see blackeyed action, nonstop kickin' through
You have to walk the walk nï¿½ talk the talk
Then words to them means words you understand, but canï¿½t explain...

Another 1 buysthedust, loud mail lunacy

A nice advice: go brutalize the dustbin, if you think
Whatï¿½s been said n doneï¿½s worth a re-run, fuel up, youï¿½re linked

Another 1 buysthedust...

900 words in a breath, then repeated for years to come
So, tell me, whatï¿½s the sound this time around?
Loud mail coming in - Hi male coming up
