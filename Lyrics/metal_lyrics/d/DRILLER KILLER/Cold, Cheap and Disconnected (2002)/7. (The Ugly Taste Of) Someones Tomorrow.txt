I cut myself bloody, I drank myself sick
I smashed my place up, did I change anything?

The ugly taste of someones tomorrow
The ugly taste of the black bloody hell

I drove somebodies car and bought myself an axe
Hi on acid, speed nï¿½ alcohol - fucked to the max
Wacked a lot of brain, wasted a lot of time
Didnï¿½t have a clue what was on my mind
...who the fuck reads signs?

The ugly taste of...

Got myself evicted, lost my drivers license
Spent a month in jail, it didnï¿½t change a thing
Wacked a lot of brain, wasted a lot of time
Didnï¿½t have a clue what was on my mind

My fucked up past is someones tomorrow
The ugly taste of...... Enjoy!
