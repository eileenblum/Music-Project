I will show my face, and I will remember. Oh I will never forget. I canât help but remember and regret. My veins are filled with desire. Iâm leaving nothing behind. My head is held high. Thereâs some things I canât let go. But they will make me grow. Itâs these moments that will always sink in. I will surface to show the face that Iâve been hiding. (Iâm the enemy, so bear with me.) Iâm the enemy, so bear with me. (I am not to be left alone.) Iâm the enemy, so bear with me. Itâs hard to deal with the fact that Iâm wrong. Mistakes have been made all along. Reduced to ash. Watch as they begin to fade away. There is a constant reminder that I have grown. My callous hands are shown. There is a constant reminder that I have grown. My scars will always hold me. Can I reach higher ground? Iâll analyze my decisions. I will decide. There is a constant reminder that I have grown. My callous hands are shown. There is a constant reminder that I have grown. My scars will always hold me. But there are some things that I cannot let go, but they will make me grow. Here are my callous hands to show. Iâm leaving nothing
behind. Here are my callous hands to show. My scars will always hold me.
