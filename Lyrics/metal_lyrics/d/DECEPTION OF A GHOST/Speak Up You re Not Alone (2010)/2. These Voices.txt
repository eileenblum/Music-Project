I heard them scream. This is the last time these voices call. I heard them scream. Again and again, they cried out telling me how I should be. Iâve been told wrong too many times. Why must it come to this? Another piece has been broken. Iâve been told wrong too many times. Another piece has broken. And Iâll quote the voices. I will keep breathing. Shouting my name, shouting my name. But I will keep on breathing. Maybe I can drown out the voices all around me that want to send me down the same road. It seems that Iâm living for someone else's purpose. If I give into this Iâll be a walking ghost. Shouting my name, shouting my name. How true could this be? I hear the sounds. I hear the sounds again.
