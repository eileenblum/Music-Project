Distant from myself. Finding my wounds are as good as gone. Buried alive. I am conscious and breathing. Buried alive. This is all I have ever dreamed of. Itâs fallen right before my feet. I couldnât ask for more. I swear my heart beats with hope. My eyes are set on the goal, and I have no misconceptions. I have awoken a giant within me. I gave this my heart, and here I am with my intentions at their best. The eyes of all are watching me as I bury this misery and I know Iâm awake. Pressing forward. I have awoken a giant. Iâm in a different state of mind. With my hands clenched at my sides. I gave this my heart, and here I am with my intentions at their best. The eyes of all are watching me as I bury this misery and I know Iâm awake. I gave this my heart.
