Donât close your eyes now you might miss me fall. I know your secret, itâs got you backed up against the wall. Donât close your eyes now you might just miss me fall. I know what you donât want me to know. You donât want me to know. Someone must take me to the light where I can see. Because here I am controlled with no meaning. Itâs setting in. It keeps reminding me Iâm safe, and all I do is listen to its words again. This is where I betray myself and I have lost the truth. Iâve lost the truth. Iâve lost the truth now, so listen close. Is this exactly what you wanted? The grace of these thoughts. I see they are following me. They must be following me. The grace of these thoughts. Believe me itâs not what you think. Itâs not what you think.
