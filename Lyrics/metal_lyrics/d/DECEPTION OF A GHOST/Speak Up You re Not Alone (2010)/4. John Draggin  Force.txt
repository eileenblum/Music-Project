Speak up. I am watching ourselves become what we once were. Oh how familiar this is to me. These faces look exactly the same as the rest. This is a test of my regards. I will not be, we will not be swallowed alive. Itâs safe to say I donât know anything, but I just want to know your plan. Iâm getting signs that weâre ignoring whatâs supposed to be. These signs are haunting me. Iâll let this pass. An imitation of what weâre supposed to be. Keep your eyes focused. Iâll watch my every step. Branded in my flesh. Speak up youâre not alone. Not just an automation. So steady your pulse. So steady your pulse for me. We will not become machines for all to disassemble.
