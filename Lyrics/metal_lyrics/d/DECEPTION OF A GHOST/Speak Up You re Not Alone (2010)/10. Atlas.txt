Open up. With the weight of your past on your shoulders. May we break these chains and move on. When will you let this go? So open your heart so mine might breathe. I want you to help me fill the spaces in between. Iâm trying my best to be real strong and I donât want to be alone. Reconcile my thoughts. I hold this all in my chest. I was left with a simple thought. Youâre strong enough. Singing of memories. We canât sing of these memories for long, and I have been pacing myself to see you open the door. Weâre burning every memory without a sound. Turn back the clock. A heart thatâs bound by what once was. The sea is awaiting us. We live for something more than this. Searching for more. The sea is awaiting us. This is it until the end. But we canât depart and find a new meaning. I can never give this up. Weâre drifting into the sunset.
