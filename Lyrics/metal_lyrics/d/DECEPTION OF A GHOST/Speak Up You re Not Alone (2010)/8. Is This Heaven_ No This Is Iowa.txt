I saw the wind take them away. To a place where they only cared for themselves. Here is your news for the crowd. Is there no more ambition? Is there no more drive? I will find a way to overcome the fear they claim. Wide eyed and hoping to find this will touch the souls of those who have lost control. I saw the wind take us away. Let me hold my tongue, while weâre resting our heads for the dawn. What is this world comprised of? We are animals. I saw the wind take us away. Let me hold my tongue, while were resting our heads for the dawn. I fear we are the ones. Here I make a stand against the world. I am against the world. Here is your news for the crowd. This is a matter of hope. They sing in perfect harmony, but not to me. They are in perfect harmony. Singing to a crowd that is asleep. Iâm not sleeping. Harmonizing. They are harmonizing. Is there no more ambition? Is there no more drive? I will find a way to overcome the fear they claim. Wide eyed and hoping to find this will touch the souls of those who have lost control. We are animals.
