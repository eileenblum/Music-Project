Empty your lungs. Thereâs not much you can say. You are the hopeless one. Youâll stand silenced behind the walls that weâve created. No words can weigh us down. But we are nothing without you. Iâve seen more than you know, so watch the skies as our hopes fly. No words can weigh us down. Iâve seen more than you will ever know, so watch the skies as our hopes fly. No words can weigh us down. There is no bleeding only our devotion. You canât stand between us. This is what we live for. A life of devotion and love. So watch the skies as our hopes fly. No words can weigh us down. There is no bleeding only our devotion. Just watch the skies because our hopes will fly. Maybe one day you will understand. One day youâll understand love.
