We deserve to be hated. We deserve to be dead. We always said forever is what we meant. Take a look at yourself. This is what we get for wanting more than we deserve. âHave we become strangers in ourselves?â I spoke aloud. Because we never knew this would be our life. This was our life. This is our life. We deserve to be hated. We deserve to be dead. Because we never knew this would be our life. Itâs like asking for a curse. Will you take the chance to see this is what we get? I never dreamed this would lead to my death. We are more than just a lie. Some day, with every single lie we ever told. Weâll never be the same. The selfishness we showed will only lead us apart from one another. You left me laying here, and I never dreamed this would lead to my death. Forever our time slows. We will shine again just to let you know. We will shine again.
