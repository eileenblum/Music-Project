Goddammit man
Why are you so fucking serious?
Ride the lightning
Just feel the flow

Just sit back relax and let go
We've all got somewhere to be
And something to see
But the faster that you go
The more you'll miss
It's the little things that make the big picture
It's the little things that make life better

Hey man, where the fuck are you going to go?
And hey man, just let it come to you
Hey man, where the fuck are you going to go?
And hey man, just let it come to you

Just take your time and breathe
Just take your time, take your time
Take your time and feel the vibe
Just take your time and breathe
Just take your time and
Take your time and feel the vibe
Cause it's time to fucking chill
It's time to chill

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Goddammit man, why are you serious?
Goddammit man, why are you serious?
Don't you want to feel the flow
Don't you want to lose control
Don't you want to feel like a man

It's really hard to fuck up this good time
And these could be the best times of your life
So take a break and catch your breath
It's safe to say that you're scared to death
And this could be the first time
You've done something for yourself

So what's the point in keeping your nose clean (nose clean)
If it has never been in the dirt
Trouble rarely kills you
But you've got time to kill (got time to kill)
Trouble rarely kills you
But you've got time to kill (to kill)

What's the point in keeping your nose clean
If it's never been in the dirt
You've never been in the dirt

So take a break and catch your breath
It's safe to say you're scared to death

I've got this funny feeling
That you don't take me seriously
Don't make this complicated
You'll end up pissed and jaded

Goddammit man, why are you serious?
Goddammit man, why are you serious?
