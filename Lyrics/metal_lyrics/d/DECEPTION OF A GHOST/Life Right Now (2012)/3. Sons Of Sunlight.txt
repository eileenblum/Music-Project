And oh my god
We make the simplest shit
Seem so fucking hard
And honestly, brother
Why is your attitude so piss-fucking poor
It can't be all about us
All the fucking time
We've got to face the fact
That we aren't right all the time
So have a little faith and respect for us
We need each other to make this work

Feeling so good about
What we can accomplish
And we'll do our best
To pick you up, to lift you up

We are all the sons of sunlight
We are all gods without insight
Living breathing capable deities
Born of stars and raised as slaves

The stakes have been raised
Let's show them what we're meant for
We have nothing to teach
Because we have nothing to preach
(The stakes have been raised)

The stakes have been raised
Let's show them what we're meant for
We have nothing to teach
Because we have nothing to preach

Welcome to life right now
Welcome to love somehow
Welcome to life right now
Welcome to love somehow
Welcome to life right now
Welcome to love somehow

Welcome to life
Welcome to love
Welcome to life
Welcome to love some-fucking-how
