That's just how it is
Everyday the never-ending push and pull
The constant cycle of eat-sleep-repeat
The perpetual

Grinding of teeth and gears
We barely fit the mold
Our shells are chipped and dented
We look weathered and we feel worse

The spark feels like it's almost gone
We aren't setting a fire in anyone's heart tonight

So don't count on us
But don't count us out
We will see what we're made of
When the dust settles to the ground

Skin like concrete (skin like concrete)
Fingers worked to the bone
Without a challenge there can't be true motivation

Then suddenly in the dark
A small ember, a small spark
The swelling of our hearts
A rush of blood and oxygen
Ignite the fire
A feeling of rebirth
Ignite the fire
This forgotten feeling

Will we let this fire burn out of control?
Will we nurture these embers, keep the fire burning inside?

And allow new thoughts, new hopes, new dreams to flourish
In this all but forgotten fucking body

We are the creatures of habit
Do we have what it take to inspire and ascend?
We are the creatures of habit
Do we have what it take to inspire and ascend?

These tired hands
This shaky soul (shaky soul)
The weak neck that holds our burden minds

It's so easy to seem broken
The bad bones, the broken hearts
Without a challenge there can't be motivation
Without a spark, a lonely ember
We will fail, we will break
Stuck in the cold alone
