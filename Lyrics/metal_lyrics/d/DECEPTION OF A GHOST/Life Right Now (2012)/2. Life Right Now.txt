Feel free to feel me
Cause I can't feel anything anymore
You wanna know about these past few years
And the bottom of the bottle
Ambulance or avalanche
Either way I end up dead
I had it all
I gave it up
It just left me wanting more

What else do you want from me
All that's left is for me to pick myself
Up off of the ground
And wipe the dirt from my shit-eating grin

So take want you want from me
So take what you want and leave
Because I'm strong
And you were wrong (you were wrong)
About the way I feel and how to heal

Go!

I'm walking tall and talking straight
I don't regret the things that I've done
Or the decisions that I've made
I know exactly where I come from

Proving it to myself
Not the whole fucking world
That I can fail my way to success
That I'm not just a son of a bitch

So take what want from me
Take what you want and leave
Because I'm strong and you were wrong
About how to feel and how to heal
You were wrong
About how to feel and how to heal

All that's left is for me to pick myself up off the ground
Wipe the dirt from my shit-eating grin
Cause I'm gonna
Prove it motherfucker

You're not shit to me
So feel free to feel me
There's nothing left you can do
There's nothing left for you to prove to me
You're not shit to me
So feel free to feel me
There's nothing left you can do
There's nothing left for you to prove to me
