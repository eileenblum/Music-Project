Is it even possible to get over this?
How am I supposed to feel?
Does it get easier?

Will I ever find it again?
Could I have been better?
Did I treat you bad?
Where did I go wrong?
Is there someone else?
Were you satisfied?
What can I do to make you come back?

If hearts could talk
If hearts could talk

I laid my heart out on line
You said you'd be there till the end of time
Never thought you'd be so fucking cold
It's my mistake
I took your words and wrapped them around my brittle soul (wrapped around)
What happened to your promises?

My heart feels nauseous and stuck in my throat
I can't seem to focus on the right emotions
I will suffer quietly with a smile on my face
So I don't make you uncomfortable

I laid my heart out on line
You said you'd be there till the end of time
Never thought you'd be so fucking cold
It's my mistake
I took your words and wrapped them around my brittle soul (wrapped around)
What happened to your promises?

All these unanswered questions
I swear to god I'd rather be dead
I'll do my best not to revert to a child-like state

I want to be irrational
I'm tired of being logical
Every sensory feeling
Is going through my heart first

I can't get it off my chest
When it's dying inside of it
I can't get it off my chest

Do you even care that I'm lost
That I have nowhere to go
That I want to crawl inside you
So I make sense of why this is happening
I want to crawl inside you
So I can make sense of how you happened

I can't get it off my chest
When it's dying inside of it

My heart is willing to claw its way through bone and sinew
Just to reach the air
Just so it could see you

It'll claw its way through
Just so it could beat you
So it could beat you in your face

If hearts could talk

I laid my heart out on line
You said you'd be there till the end of time
Never thought you'd be so fucking cold
It's my mistake
I took your words and wrapped them around my brittle soul (wrapped around)
What happened to, what happened to
What happened to your promises?

If hearts could talk
If hearts could talk
