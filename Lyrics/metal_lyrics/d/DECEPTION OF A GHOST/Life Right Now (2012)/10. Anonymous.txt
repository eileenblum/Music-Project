Dear sirs and madams,
You know what?
I've been thinking about this all night
And my most sincere interpretation
Would be presented as such

Why are you always fucking with me?
Is it really necessary for me
To do this much mundane bullshit, just for you?
It's like this slave-driven mentality
Where taking away from others' livelihood
Which in return is an exchange of energy (of energy)

Where the draining of one leads to the false sense of fulfillment
Which is the main downfall in the western ideologue

Why are you draining me?
Why are you draining us?

Do you really think that you're better than me?
You're compromising your own self
For the false god of money (of money)
Which leads to false identification (false identification)
You're compromising your own self
For the false god of money (of money)
Which leads to false identification

Which can be seen in every form from
Politics, religion, corporations
All these institutions, and organizations
With the perceived sense of false power

You push down the heads of the ones that are under you
So you can seek and reach a higher position with no concern

You push down the heads of the ones that are under you
With no concern for the real well-being of your fellow peers
I beg, I plead (I beg, I plead), I implore you (I implore you)
To let this way of thinking
Leave your almost soulless bodies
(Leave your almost soulless bodies)
You push down the heads of the ones (and I beg, and I plead)
That are under you (and I implore you)
So you can seek and reach a higher position with no concern
For the real well-being (and I beg, and I plead)
Of your fellow peers (and I implore you)
I beg, I plead, I implore you
For all our sakes

Do you really think
That you're better than me?
You're compromising your own self
For the false god of money
Do you really think that you're better than me?
You're compromising your own self
