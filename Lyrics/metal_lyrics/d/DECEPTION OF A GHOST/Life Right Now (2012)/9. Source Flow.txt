Everything has a rhyme
Everything has a reason

A constant source flow
It has an energy
That points you in the right direction
The writing's on the wall

The mind's eye has a filter
An ability to funnel out the bullshit
A natural way to keep you feeling fucking right
A natural way for you to feel the other side

Breathe deep now (breathe deep now)
Come on and work it all out now
Focus on the right path, feel the energy
Focus on being alive
Focus on feeling the energy

Hey, hey
Feel the worlds merging
Everything is living
Everything is dying to be alive
You don't have to struggle
If you follow the river's flow
You don't have to struggle
If you learn to just let go

Now be quiet, and be still
Let the hair on your neck stand to attention
Something is speaking to you (to you)
Something is urging you to be alive
Something is speaking to you (to you)
Something is keeping you alive

Everything has a rhyme
Everything has a reason

Everything works together
So we can keep it together
Must keep on feeling
Must keep on flowing
Embrace this unseen energy
Find the fucking source
And be excellent to one another
