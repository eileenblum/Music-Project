How much longer
Can we hold this down
These thoughts that form inside
We hide from our mouths

Our stomachs are empty
With no more food for thought
We starve for something original
And we hunger for knowledge
The guilt is eating away at us
Like a greedy tapeworm
All these scared faces and guilty hearts

Afraid of being afraid
It's haunted us
Since the creation of birth
We need a nudge
To start the free fucking fall
To start the free fucking fall

We aren't asking for a miracle
Just an educated stab
In the fucking dark

Go!

Something to kickstart
A new age of reasoning

Something to be proud of
Something original
Something to fill our minds with thought
And keep our stomachs full of satisfaction
