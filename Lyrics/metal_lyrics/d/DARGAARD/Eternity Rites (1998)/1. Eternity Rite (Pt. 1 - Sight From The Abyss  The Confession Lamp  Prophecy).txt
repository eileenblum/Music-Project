I feel this cold darkness
The very emptiness calls me.
Follow me on my path...
Come, sentence this world to death.

Mortal life is nothing compared to the void.
Your fears will be erased as the thought reaches eternity

What once was balance is now broken.
As this shadows arised from the depths beyond space and time

The abysses beyond the line of mortal imagination

The light faded and left no source
I walked the void

The light faded and left no source
I walked the void

The light faded and left no source
Here time is the traveler and I am the constant
