Blind eyes that see more
as what is hidden in your face
blind eyes see the skull
behind your skin.
It feels you're growing
older with every second.
It sees your decay in every minute.
A soulless corpse with wings of death.
A desolated mind without fears.
This is it what this entity belongs to -
not a linear existence
