I can see what you see not.
Visions milky than eyes rot.
When you turn they will be gone
whispering their hidden song.
Then you see what cannot be:
Shadows move where light should be.
Death is their curse to the sun
to walk the way they had begun.
Out of darkness out of mind
cast down to the halls of the blind.
