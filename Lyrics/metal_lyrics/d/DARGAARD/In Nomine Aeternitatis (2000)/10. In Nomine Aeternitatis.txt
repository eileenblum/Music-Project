So we awaked
In a place beyond space and time
Where mortal limits last no more.
We left the balance
And the fading world
Witout regret,
Without on more thought.
Carried by the shadows we drift
Into another sphere.
Erased are fear
And all emotions -
I feel the great collective now.
Within the everlasting void -
Time never existed
And constant...
Is all existence.
