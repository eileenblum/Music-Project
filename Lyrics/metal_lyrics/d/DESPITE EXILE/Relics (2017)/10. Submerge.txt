A hollow heart that can never be filled
Abandoned to the depths of night
Left alone, floating, betrayed
On the edge of this burning sea
We always thought we were infinite
No limits have ever shown along our way
We followed blindly the winds of perdition
Just to find our end, just to find ourselves
A pulse in the veins as I wait for the end
Let me sink in this ocean
A gaze at the constellations
As the lungs are filled one last time
Left alone, floating, betrayed
On the edge of this burning sea
You were the light that I needed
But now youâre shining in distance
My feelings withered away with your memory
Cold stone replaced your shape
Eventually we will meet again
We always thought we were infinite
No limits have ever shown along our way
We followed blindly the winds of perdition
Just to find our end, just to find ourselves
