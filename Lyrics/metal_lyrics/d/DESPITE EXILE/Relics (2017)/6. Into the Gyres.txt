We rotate
Tied to the pole of our fragile dignity
Plugging our ears with the wax we shaped out of remorse
To prevent us from hearing these mermaids
That instigate the demons enclosed in our souls
The skies seem to have cracked yet once more
We have ignored the coming storm for far too long
Given up on any hope of salvation
Stuck in the gyres for ages to come
We forgot they used to sing fables of love
Still we know we would let them drag us
Deep down the precipice we're longing for
We tighten our knots
Too scared to leave the wrecks we're floating upon
With open eyes
We swallow the winds that blow on this forsaken earth
The skies seem to have cracked yet once more
We have ignored the coming storm for far too long
Given up on any hope of salvation
Stuck in the gyres, we're stuck into the gyres
Driven by insatiable hunger
Hoping to discern a way home
Drifting on the surface of unconscious
A forlorn chant to guide us forth
We've breathed life into those demons
Around us the foaming black whirl
We can only stick to the course
Separate us from spirals and ghosts
