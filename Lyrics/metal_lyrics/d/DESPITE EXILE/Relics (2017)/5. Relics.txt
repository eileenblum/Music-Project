Siren
My screams lose themselves amidst the raging storm
I have been following your swinging tail
Diving into the hazard from which we're born
I was bound to be another failed commander
I led my fleets towards this dead end
Do you recall me, fighting for a lost 'cause?
I have been trying to recompose the sound of your voice
I built the constellations I was searching for
In order to govern this unrelenting flood
I built the constellations I was searching for
And discover the cliffs where you went singing your grief
Now, as the depths swallow me down
I can still hold onto your fading grace
As a feather hanging in the balance
Just for an instant that I must try to condense
I'm holding the dices in my hand
My fist is tight while everything falls apart
You fled away staring at the ruins before you
Buried underneath the crumbs of our shattered history
You will keep existing as the allegory
Of what we could have been
Now the time has come for me to dissolve
Leaving the world to the mercy
Of your silver and gold
Siren
My screams lose themselves amidst the raging storm
I have been following your swinging tail
Diving into the hazard from which we're born
Even if your light abandons the world of men
You will forever be the mark of what we cannot amend
I could never abolish the chance of finding you again
The dices are thrown
