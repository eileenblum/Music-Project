Seized by the mist and the platitude
Of this speechless tide
We've spot the foam, we've traced the absent vessel
That will reverse our fate
Will we drench in his trail
Or will we navigate the horizon
In search for the metonyms of loves now lost?
Yet again we were forsaken into the dead calm
Bearing a reminder of those shimmering coasts
As promises carved in our memory
There's no grasp on what awaits ahead
Our certitude was molded into the matter of our doubts
The very stone of the homes we're leaving behind
But we will sail once more
And just give ourselves to the swinging
Between cruelty and lifelessness
Spending lifetimes to seek for an imperceptible swell
A dawn that never shines
Lies hidden beneath the crest
A pledge we cannot formulate
That we will observe through a single act
