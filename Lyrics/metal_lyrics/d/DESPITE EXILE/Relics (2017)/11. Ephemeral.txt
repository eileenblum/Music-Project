We've prayed for the rain
To cleanse the plagues of the earth
We've prayed for the deluge to wash us away
We were brought to face our disaster
The boundaries have been long crossed
The limit exceeded
This is the day we relinquish all misery
The wallowing in apathy
To have it done with these pitiful creatures
Confined in an ocean of repetition
We've spent centuries in deception
Chasing ethereal delusions
Divided between fate and fortune
Merging with our fading traces
As disciples we wither beside our masters
We'll fracture the laws
That plead us defective
Attending the eclipse
When daylight is one with the dusk
To enshrine the birth of a different order
And unleash the fury they've bred in us
To redeem the relics of our past
The premonition of an unnoticed path
A transient justice reigning upon our vestige
Ephemeral
Just for an instant forever condensed
Just for an instant we'll find a way home
Ephemeral
