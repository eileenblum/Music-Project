I forgot how I found myself
Stranded in this spasm of intellect
In search for the keys of uncharted portals
Lost in a prison without depth
Hollow and brittle chambers for my weakness to dwell
As I plunged in the abyss of consciousness
Empty lanes and paling impressions
Strangled by an unavoidable gaze
I kept evading until I found the thread
Until I reached the bottom of the maze
We are a crease suspended on tide
Abandoned at the mercy of events
Waiting for greater forces to seize us
Before we lose ourselves in the current
Weâll give up our sight by the clouded brims of time
To discover that there is no substance
To witness the answers contract into emblems
And feel them nesting outside our spectrum
The fragments of my identity confuse themselves
Within an infinite mirroring
Just as a set of apparitions reflecting from one to another
While all thatâs essential slithers away with the light
Deprived of the center I never had
I merge with the surfaces that unfold throughout me
Delivered and devoid of nothing
We are a crease suspended on tide
Abandoned at the mercy of events
Waiting for grater forces to seize us
Before we lose ourselves in the current
Weâll give up our sight by the clouded brims of time
