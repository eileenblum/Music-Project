Whispers from a perishing orb
Traverse the crumbling phantom of our world
Specters among the cruelest evoked
Infesting and poisoning the well
That life will attain to re-imagine its form
A pack of exhausted animals
Moving on the traces of their ancestors
Confined and over-determined
Adapt, extinguish
Migrate, revolt
Repeat the cycle only to strive for a missing cause
Tear the garment and congregate the void below
Summon a place where we can just rest in our nightmares alone
Only through fissures
Can we experience a glimpse of the whole
Measuring our disproportion
Retrieving our goals
Weâre just beginning to distinguish the lines that design our trajectory
The insurgent scheme of our cosmology
How can we abrogate our distraction and devise the means of creation
again?
Find the path to reformulate our genesis
Knowing weâre all too feeble to exist
Virtual efflorescence will lead us along
Adapt
Extinguish
Migrate
Revolt
Repeat the cycle
Establish our cause is lost
