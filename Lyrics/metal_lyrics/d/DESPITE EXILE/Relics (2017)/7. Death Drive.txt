Pose an end to this wretched existence
How can we live in this purposeless oblivion
We've let these images overwhelm us
'Til we were crushed by the weight of simulation
Masters decay, idols stand still
We cannot but remain
Alone with our reasons to kill
No more escaping the falsehood
Our legacies are already fading away
These fragments have dissolved the frame
Once more as spectators
We sink in the dust that buried our truth
No more ideals to betray
We are now given back to our anguish
To divide again ever day
What should live from what must perish
To retrace the line within us
Such is the lowest price we'll pay
We just keep fooling ourselves all over again
Orbiting around these hollow centers
Wandering through these corridors full of crippled mirrors
We should eradicate our obsessions
Overcome our addictions
But still we're trampled by the unease of our ancestors
Our legacies are already fading away
These fragments have dissolved the frame
Once more as spectators
We sink in the dust that buried our truth
You cannot divert decay
You cannot invert the mechanism
Eyes shut to witness the fall
Of what's already falling apart
Let civilizations collapse
