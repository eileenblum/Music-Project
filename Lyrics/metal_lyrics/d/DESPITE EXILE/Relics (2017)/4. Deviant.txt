Finally in the sight of your misleader
Here to serve and protect
The chaos that nourished your very existence
A sum of conjunctures
Shapes the event of your own disappearance
While truth overwhelms you as a calamity
Resonating through your gestures
Devoid of an author
I am prophet of contingency
I was stillborn and thrown in the innermost obscurity
Raised by the apathy this world has forced in our throats
Until the warmth of the abyss filled my lungs
Bearer of visions of atoms colliding
Shaman of the absurd
To guide you as you embrace your subversion
And draw the full circle
So let the deviance penetrate your words
Feel the exorbitant weight of all norms
Together we will extinguish every remnant of order
We will emerge as the prospect mankind had overlooked
Stand as anomalies and obliterate this farce
Now, disciple, throw your dices and wither away
Before they even grace the surface
A master must confess
All that is left of these actions
Is bound to amount to some worthless wisdom
Swarming underneath our perception
We do only find exceptions intertwined
Thereâs nothing but a certitude
As patterns weaved from a lack
We revolve and forge our circumstance
So let the deviance penetrate your words
Feel the exorbitant weight of all norms
Together we will extinguish
Every remnant of order
Stand as anomalies
And obliterate this farce
