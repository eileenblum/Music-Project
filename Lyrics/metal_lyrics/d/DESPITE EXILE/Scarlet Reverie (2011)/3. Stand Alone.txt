Everyday is getting worse.
Everyday is a battle to survive.

We'll keep running to save ourselves.
The weak will fall.
Only the strongest will make it through this path called life.
I chose
I chose to fight
I chose to live my life

There won't be an happy ending.
There just will be an end.
But we can decide how to say goodbye.
On our knees, or standing up.
I've made my choice.
Now it's your turn.

I won't let you take me down.

If you want something just fucking take it.
Don't let anyone block the road of your dreams.
Life is one and it's fucking yours.

I chose to fight
I chose to live my life

I won't let you take me down

There won't be an happy ending.
There just will be an end.
But we can decide how to say goodbye.
