She was fast asleep
Just like a rare flower.
So slow to blossom.
So beautiful at sight.
So easy to damage.
So hard to find.
She was fast asleep.
And I will never have the answer
Since I never had a question .
And I will never have the answer
Since I never had a question.

Bring it back to me
I can't sleep since I start caring.
Bring it back to me
I can't breath without my air.

My heart seems to explode
Every time I watch your eyes.
My breath trembles
Every time I see your smile.
Deeper and deeper I'm falling
Without your presence by my side.

Bring it back to me
Bring it back
Bring it back to me

Just like a rare flower
She was fast asleep.
I asked her with my eyes
To tell me those words
For the first time.
For me was enough.
For me she is everything.

I asked her with my eyes
To tell me those words
For the first time
A silent question
And i will never have the answer

I asked her with my eyes
To tell me those words
For the first time
I silent question
That will always remain unanswered.
