I am disgusted of you.
I can't even think of taking a glimpse of your eyes.
You make me sick.
I'd like to rip your face off your head
So that everyone can see your real beauty
And not the mask you always wear.

Lifeless plague of humanity
I will free the world from your noxious existence.
No more lies.
No more false hope.
No more manipulations.
No more you.

Walk with me in the depths of hell.

You can hide your fangs.
You can pretend to be whoever you want.
I won't fall again.
I won't hesitate.
I won't give you the chance to flee from your grave.

I am your fucking god.

Welcome to the end.
Say goodbye to the world you knew.
Walk with me
Through this land where life does not exist.

I will make your nightmares come to life.
The dream is collapsing
You are now facing reality.

Welcome to the end.
Say goodbye to the world you knew.
Walk with me
Through this land where life does not exist.
