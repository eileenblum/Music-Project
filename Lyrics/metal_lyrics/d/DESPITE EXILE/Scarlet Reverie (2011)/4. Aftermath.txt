Like a poison you filled my veins
You hold my heart with cold hands
Absorbing everything I gave you like a black hole
I won't close my eyes

We headed no warnings, we hold no truths.

We have lost all hope of direction,
And any chance of redemption.
New emotions creeping beneath the skin.

I'll burn every bridge I've ever built,
And I'll crush everything I've ever felt
Just to bring you back to me.

There's no turning back.

Time is the only judge left.
Waiting for tomorrow.
A new light will show the way.
May the stars and the moon fix us.

We are knee deep and sinking,
Right where we used to stand.
Are we already giving up trying?
Just take my hand and walk away with me.

We headed no warnings, we hold no truths

I'll burn every bridge I ever built,
And I'll crush everything I ever felt
Just to bring you back to me.

There's no turning back.
