Truth must be kept veiled
Drowning in complexity
Brimming with void
Devoured by doubt
You're bound to fall as we all are
You will strive for an answer
I will seek for a sense

We shall pray for this emptiness to be filled

The axe of wisdom falls right through my neck
Desecrating every last taste of vitality
You're compromising
Disgracing the last drops of a source
The source of a circle I thought I could close
Eternally you shall strike against yourself
Convictions will drag you into failure

Face that we're not meant to understand
