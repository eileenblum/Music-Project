A dim light conceived to set
Invading these gelid grounds
A stillborn prophet descends the mountains
Forsaking symmetry in urge to act
Our possibilities were consumed
The mirage of balance finally traversed
First as tragedy, then as farce
I rejoin with all creatures
To trigger the epilogue
We are the unconscious poison
That sparks the corrosion of every pure image
We are the immanent rupture
That forces horizons to collapse
Dismantling visions for entities to come
We are the terminal negation
In order to affirm
Feast on your idols
Feast on your messiahs
Feast upon me
I offer a body to be dismembered
For this oracle to be achieved
The orb dissolves by the sands of fate
To conquer truth is to wither sight
Trace the line upon our eyes
I am catastrophe.
