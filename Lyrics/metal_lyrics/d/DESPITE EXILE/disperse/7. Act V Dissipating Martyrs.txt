In the beginning was Silence
Perceive the echoes of matter
Cutting across multiplied dimensions
Weâve stood firm through devastation
The bond is now broken
We were tied to an origin
That was lost all along
Eventually authors of inexorable outcomes
Yet called to accomplish a closing gesture
Weâve found ourselves undone in blindness
Still weâve grasped the intuition of a senseless universe
Searching for a finale underneath our eyelids
We shall transcend extinction
In retrospect weâll laugh of our tragedy
Our deeds will reunite with the dust of the ages
As we place a stone upon time itself
Our doom is deconstructed
Dualities are forever overcome
Abolish distinctions between chaos and form
What we had we have left behind
Purged from desires of deliverance
We are free to torch the meadows in our minds
Admiring dissipation while memories ignite
Symbols reconvert and dissolve
These words are fading
Ultimately we submerge
Separate from light
Defy unconscious
And sever the archetypes
No Gods, no Saviours
No Man, no Nature
Dare to lacerate the eternal eye
Endlessly impermanent
Infinitely void
All is uncreated
We have chosen to disperse
We are no more.
