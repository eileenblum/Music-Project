Encircled the struggle
The wound has been sealed
By the weight of revelation
I have been called to operate a superior synthesis
Condemned to unrestraint
Forced to shape the otherness
From which I was produced
One and manifold
Dwelling in endless alterity
I am the act of contemplating an infinite self
An all reflecting stare
A consciousness refracted through multiple patterns
That flows in the intersections of every scheme
I have withdrawn from life
Abandoned the world
To let it exist as its own parallax
Caught in a static ascension to absolute
Embracing divergent polarities
I now perceive the unbridgeable distance
That founds the endless fragments of the whole
Ever-present, ever-aware
Invisible harmony
Arose as a flux of pure intensity
Synolon of chaos and form
I am the self-emptying substance and subject
Perfected in solipsism
Yet engulfed by a sea of ravages
I am forlorn
Have I reached the void to go further beyond?
I shall eclipse the orb
I shall descend.
