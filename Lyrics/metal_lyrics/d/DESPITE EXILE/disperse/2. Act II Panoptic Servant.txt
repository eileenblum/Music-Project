Submit to this hollow structure
we've been conceived within empty signs
tied to a master-signifier
self-replicating masks for the void, is all we are
Our existence united in a painful contortion
swarming like maggots, enduring as an ode to nonsense
that we are forced to repeat through every single act
The myth of creation
the strife for determination
the ever-lasting clash to outreach alienation
projecting our slavery onto cosmic scales
Bound to live through unceasing anguish
we are the wretched servants of a headless tyrant
forever hiding, forever standing as our spectral counterpart
The curse of sight has made us perceive unfathomable glances
constantly obsessing the concept of self
Sentience is but a horde of eyes
chasing us through the glass of our minds
Face the perpetual contradiction
of beholding life as voiceless spectators
Trapped in this conscious inertia
we witness the grin of necessity
There is no escape, for there is no enemy
Only a plague can save us
I am the eye itself
Only the fire can purge us
I am the eye itself.
