Gaping the eternal eye
A colder sun is rising
Dawning creator
I have emerged to pose this world
As the crowning milestone on the path of reason
Born from unending dissension
Prime and sole mover
First and last sovereign form
Feeding on paradoxes
Insurmountable principle of truth
Empowering matter with will
All things shall exist throughout my view
From this frozen orb
I witness the disrupting atoms of cancer
That stream in the veins of human despair
Iâll restore the sacred order
Iâll suture the scar of this terrestrial forgetfulness
I will seal the wounds
I will seal this insignificance
I am primordial vengeance
For all ages to come
Descry me, for I never was
Recall me, for I was here all along
Designing the origin and the doom of all
I scaled every mountain
And slain every god
I am the constant transcendence of every thought
Craving every glimpse of life to enforce my decree
Devouring gaze of Leviathan
Bathing in blood of rotten divinities
I am an act forever lost.
