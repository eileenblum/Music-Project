Time to wake the wake the fuck up
Days spent in darkness
If only we could paint over the pas a new future
Leave the questions behind
Close your eyes and witness the dark part of your being
Where all the shadows are hiding
Open your arms to eternal damnation
Destroy
Searching for something that doesn't exist
Here we all feel alive
Here we all see wonders surround us
We are slaves to ourselves
All these lights got us blind
Release the demon hiding beneath your skin
And when all hope is gone
And every door seems locked
You have to force your way through
It has begun
Dry the tears from your eyes
We can only see as far as we think
The horizon falls
The sky and the sea becomes one
No more limits for you
Now you can fly
Perfection neutralized
