You've got control, learnt ably the principle -
"The bigger always devour the small"
Never a servant, acting more like a demigod!
Exposed power led you to the throne
Vulnerable minds - weak ones asserted you on
Bloodstained ties strengthened your name
Made them feel fright - afraid of death!
Feed them with fear like you feed them with bread

Death sets the value on the world!
Religion's price, authorities, taste of flesh
Death is our favourite dope

You waste life to reach higher and higher
Feeling immortal, the man who'll never expire
Remember time is the reaper, it will bury us all
The hooded end and nothing more than a fragile body and a mortal soul
Hourglass of a hundred years, everything turns into ash
Your all empires will fall with the last of the rotten cells
What is your heritage ?

Death sets the value on the world!
Religion's price, authorities, taste of flesh
Death is our favourite dope

Mother of life, the mother of pain, the birth of chaos, the harmony of fate
The fatal blood, the bond we can't avoid! Search for the aeons lost in her name
The doomed game but worth the show - begins her dance, let the dice be thrown!
The worship of life drives the destiny's course, the cult of death kills the remorse
