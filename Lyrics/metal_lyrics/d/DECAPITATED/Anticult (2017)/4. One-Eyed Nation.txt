The heavy crown of the kings
The confidante of their unabashed plans

A scepter broken in a wolfish grip
Ancient insignia of a lost intent
Is this the burden carried for power ?
A bludgeon crafted to crush heads or just the blind man's golden cane ?

There is no power coming from gods
There is no providence for the chosen ones!
There is no servant created to serve!
Flesh equals flesh like man equals man
The greedy ego tips the fate's scales!

Old sages say - in the land of the eyeless
One eye is enough to reach the abandoned throne
Always wash blood with water. Never with another bloodshed
Dark fruit of the wisdom born in the masterminds

There is no power coming from gods
There is no providence for the chosen ones!
There is no servant created to serve!
Flesh equals flesh like man equals man
The greedy ego tips the fate's scales!

Blinded queen leads the Cyclops
Cyclops lead the visionless folk
Blind men's shoulders, not titans
Carry the weight of this world!

Queen Themis covers her terrified eyes
Words shaped in peace, the peace after war
Her hand of justice wields a double-edged sword
If I could take this blade
And carve the eye out deep in their heads
Pierce dormant minds awake and illume
Raise the one-eyed nation, a race built on truth

There is no power coming from gods
There is no providence for the chosen ones!
There is no servant created to serve!
Flesh equals flesh like man equals man
The greedy ego tips the fate's scales!
