The welkin disappeared
There is no horizon
The sun, the primeval mother, abandoned us
It despairingly burns behind the shroud
The pervasive shroud of the deathly ash
The orphaned nature, the last vital sign
Fades out in the shadow, burying the old vivid earth
I knew that even light needs darkness to shine
But learnt that every darkness always kills the light

Heavy clouds went grey and down
Crushing lungs with acid air
This isn't home!
This is the civilization's grave

This place smells of grimness and fear
The great vigil of the pending extinction
Words spat out from the prophet's mouth
Always tasted so dire, now taste so familiar

Heavy clouds went grey and down
Crushing lungs with acid air
This isn't home!
This is the civilization's grave

Wean off being "human" with every single breath
We perish in a concrete gas chamber
Inhaling the self-prepared fate!
Black visions went real, more real than we'd thought
We were born as free men but the world we have forged
Negates the perfect plan and forces us to crawl

Life - death's hybrids slouching around
Prosopagnosia? Everywhere same blurry faces
Faces hidden behind the masks - the failed escape
Masks saving life or just protracting the end!
