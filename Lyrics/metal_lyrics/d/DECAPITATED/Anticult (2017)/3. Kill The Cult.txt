The plague of our era, parasites batten on us
Chosen to spread delusion, monkeys of a self-made God
The cult of puppets, idols, forged in the artful hands
Hands which pull the strings - the strings attached to weak brain!

Kill this cult!
Cult of lies..
Cult of scars..
Divine falseness

Kill this cult! Cult of lies
I burn your symbols and spit in your faith
Take all this shit and go back to your hell!

Wallow in filth - the great cult of sin
Only one dogma - Their immunity!
Holiness on the charlatan's face
Threaten with damnation, summon Lucifer

Kill this cult!
Cult of lies..
Cult of scars..
Divine falseness

Kill this cult! Cult of lies
I burn your symbols and spit in your faith
Take all this shit and go back to your... Go back to your hell!

Kill this cult! Cult of lies
I burn your symbols and spit in your faith
Take all this shit and go back to your hell!

Kill this cult!
Cult of lies!
I take your lies and stick them back in your throats
Drink the blood your Gods spilled and fucking choke!!!
