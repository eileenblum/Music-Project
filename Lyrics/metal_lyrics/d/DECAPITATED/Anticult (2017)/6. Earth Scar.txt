I scarify my brain with memories
The intensive taste of yesterday's air
The breath of freedom, the breath of fate
Distance between million names and places
The touch of native life, the culture's spell
I'm a man born to settle but with soul born to stray

The source of my being, the core of this path
I'm raising my army stronger than death

The sacred art of waiting, humble votary
Time leaks through the days lost in dissolving dates
The hour of sacrum. The sacrum of stage
Sweet mantra of life, the cure that revives!
I morph into the shaman performing the rite
Trance of the screaming faces, the voice of my tribe
Mellifluous prayer that will never fade
Hear the common rhythm pulsating in our veins

The source of my being, the core of this path
I'm raising my army stronger than death

I'm digging my earth scar. Step after step
Against everything I follow my fate
I'm digging, my earth scar till I dig my grave
Wherever I'll fall, I'll fall as a fulfilled man!

I'm digging my earth scar. Step after step
Against everything I follow my fate

My fate!
My fate!
My fate!
