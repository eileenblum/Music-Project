You are the ones that will free us from colours
That will free us from words
Squeezed in the rock of existence
We never experienced anything else
Mind, moment, spark-there's nothing
The weight of this world breaks my spine
So maybe emptiness completes existence?
Does something that never was exist?
Destroy, change- you are unable
Hatred, fear, frustration- laughter
Is it possible to be in the temple of nothingness?
World is you, you're the eternal everything
Never-always, one- nothing
You think that destruction is the way
Let your own pain be the answer
For nothingness, for non-existence in emptiness
Being for not being, religion of black hole
Did we find already:
Can something that never was give us an answer:  
What you truly hate is a part of you
World without move, we flow in substance
Devoured by perfect entirety
Homogenous millions of perfect shape
