Satisfaction is the seed of hunger 
Beginning of the circle is its end
There's no centre-emptiness in between
And perfection is not always in the midst
Living for a moment? Being a spark
And there's no light but flame
Middle state leading to boundlessness
War is the order of this world
Harmony of the earth is always and never
Everlasting order is illusion and deceit
War is mother, fight is harmony
We're burned to burn
Word is nothing without silence
What is your god without infinity of zero:
Father destroy to create
Father burn to be forever
Father fade to burn again
Father don't be but change
