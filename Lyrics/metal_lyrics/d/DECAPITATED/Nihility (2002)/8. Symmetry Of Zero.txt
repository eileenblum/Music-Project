Thickening mass of reality
Curve the existence descends to zero
Crowd loosing its colors
Tightening nature points at the middle

Weighing of central point
The other side of existence arrives
Reflection of what is known devours imperfection
Existence is defective by nature

Highest independence- sacred zero
Final order-sacred zero
Lack of imperfection-sacred zero
