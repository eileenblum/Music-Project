The music is too loud, you can't hear the clock
Conductor is missing and no one misses hum
Band of politicians, lawyers and false prophets
No one reads notes, yet everyone wants to lead

So you think you can dance?
Said hooded axman to the king
Monarch nods, the wheel turns
Head rolls through the ballroom
Dancers stumble, loose the rhythm
Dogs play with blood-stained crown
Fool looks noble in king's cloak
Cooks and crooks fight for the throne
It's still warm

Herr Fritzl invited his kids and their kids
They stay in shadow and sip champagne
Agoraphobic and somewhat pale
Telling bad jokes to relaxed Natascha

Rwandese waiters serve cold snacks
Nothing for vegans: it's all bones and blood
The night is bright as teh world burns
Or is it Theodore and his pyro toys

Elderly women hunt for soldier boys
Soldiers hunt for civilians, it's always fun
getting hard to breathe, it's either smoke or gas
Master of Ceremony smiles behind the mask.
