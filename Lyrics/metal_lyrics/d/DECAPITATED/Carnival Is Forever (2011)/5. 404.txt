Zero day. Successfully installed on this earth
The miracle of birth, the irony of fate
Enslaved by time, cause and effect
Armed with laughter, doubt and despair
Let me start the game

One needs deft fingers to survive 
Sharp eye and pliant spine
No time to rethink your decisions
Just find the treasure, score high
Avoid bugs

Could the avatar in the mirror be me?
Blood on my hands and empty eyes
Still smiling, too mad to be scared
At this level I'd use the mercy of god
But where's god? He's 404

Don't be sorry it's not your fault
The malfunction is an integral part of the program

There's no save game, no hidden keys
And don't be a fool- for fair play reward
Crash data, fatal error. I'm done

Did I deserve to rest in green meadows
To drink sweet water from his peaceful streams
To stand by his side? To fulfill my needs?
