You will never walk alone
Counted, trained, controlled
Being a cog in the machine
Being a grain of sand in the desert
Being a sheep in the herd
You breathe on command
You shit on command
You kneel on command

Born with no herd instinct, afraid of the crowd
Forced to follow the rules, to obey your laws
deserter in uniform, refugee on constant run
I'm not proud of victories, nor distraught with defeats
I refuse to take part in this conspiracy of lies
I take no orders from your idiot generals
How come motherfuckers that you always unite
For the wrong cases, under false flags?

Lo and behold! Admire the show
Lethal duel between me and the world
Where the world wins the battles 
But I lose the war

I was the crippled Spartan child thrown over the cliff
I was the villain crucified at the right hand of Iscariot
I was the black albino torn to pieces by his own tribe
I was the woman that knew the herbs burnt at the stake
