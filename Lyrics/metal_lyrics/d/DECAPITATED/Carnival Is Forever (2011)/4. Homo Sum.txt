Homo sum and hate humanity
Despise the culture, spit on law
Mongrels, scorpions, snakes and men
Only species that bite their tails
Ever since Nero burnt Rome
All the good roads lead to hell
So learn how to live in the cage
Or die trying to avoid the fate

I'd sell my soul to the devil
Or anyone who would buy
If I had one

I've been a burden since day one
Stranger in the strange land
Blind to what you wanted me to see
Numb to what you wanted me to be
rather philophobic than philosopher
But one thing I know for sure
If I'd free myself from the world
The world wouldn't mind at all

If you want to make god laugh
Tell him about your plans
Erase empathy, abandon hope
Stand up
