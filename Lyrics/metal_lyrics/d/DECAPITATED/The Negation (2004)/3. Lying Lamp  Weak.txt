Pathetic is the species being it's own negation.
Big words locked in the holy books.
Flame in the eyes fixed on heaven,
And the stench of decaying bodies
That have lived to see the answer.
Another word spat out from under the mask.
No meaning, no goal.
Doomed to cling to each other.
They laugh crying and lie sensing their weakness.
Clotted human mass struggles
Trying to rise and run away from themselves.
It's time this jest reached it's end.
The church of the black hole will fulfil the sacrifice.
