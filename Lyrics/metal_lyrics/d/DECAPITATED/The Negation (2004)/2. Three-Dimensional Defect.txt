Blinding void veils colours.
All features melt into one vision.
All-absorbing and all-swallowing time
The singing of the black hole is calling.
The shrill silence of universe
Blows up all minds from inside.
Desire of your own death makes flesh burst into flame.
Another moment of senseless reasoning
Opens the gate to the real existence
That is not for the eyes.
Inexpressible pain of the ripped flesh
Releases so far unknown senses.
No chance for losing consciousness.
Suffering in the thickening void.
Stop! Human defect is triumphing.
The passage into fourth dimension
Is passing out of sight.
