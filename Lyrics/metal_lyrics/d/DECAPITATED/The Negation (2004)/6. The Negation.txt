No! Catharsis through scream
Too many ways, too many truths
The myth of the reward
And the punishment
Still feeds our fear.
No to all of the masks of this world!
No to the empty words!
Open eyes look, yet closed can truly see
Creeping vermin still cross their traces
Seeming movement of the elements
Does not chance the vision the throbbing whole.
No to those that have seen,
And thus have believed!
No to those that have not seen,
And yet have believed!
Global negation of the visible existence
Is thedelusion in itself.
Yet the truth the animal eyes look to
Dies at the closed eyelid glance of spirit.
