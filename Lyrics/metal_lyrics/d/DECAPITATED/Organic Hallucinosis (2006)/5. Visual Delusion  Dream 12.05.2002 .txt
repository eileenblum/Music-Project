Bastard, Lizard! lick my wounds
Lucid dream, (our) world turns to chaos
Demonic shadows floating in blood
Waiting for me to fall asleep

(they whisper... deep...)

Inside my head an outstanding pain
Millions of voices screaming for help
Their/venom poured all over me
An essence (of hate)
So powerful it destroys

(help me!!!)

My visions all flounder in the whirl
Of blood storm. see, feel, smell
I see plastic Jesus nailed to the cross

The black hole of nothingness absorbs all...

(I) see, (I) feel, smell...

Doom, nihility, holocaust comes
The cataclysm I have feared... comes
Doom, nihility, holocaust comes..

ORGANIC HALLUCINOSIS
ORGANIC HALLUCINATIONS
Organic... visual delusion

Stench of rotting flesh
Melted seas of human hate
Doom, nihility, holocaust comes
The cataclysm I have feared... comes
Doom, nihility, holocaust comes..

Why must I be born?
Why must I to be born to this?
To feel my heart and limbs torn
To see and dream through these fears
And shed my poisoned tears?

Cut myself, release the blood
My time has come
Why must I be born?

ORGANIC HALLUCINOSIS
ORGANIC HALLUCINATIONS
Organic... visual delusion

Cutting my veins, infecting my brain
Burn my throat burn my eyes
Throbbing pain throbbing brain
Heavy lids heavy thoughts

Bitter throat pumping blood
Oh fuck.....!!!!!
