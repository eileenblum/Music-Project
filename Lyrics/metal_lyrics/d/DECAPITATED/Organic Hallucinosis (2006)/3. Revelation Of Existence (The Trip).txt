Floating in this world of satisfaction
Contentment for an immeasurable time
Echo's vibrated my universe
The universe of endless dreams... dreams... dreams...

All objects complete in themselves,
Many worlds buried in them,
Each world as worlds and objects endlessly,
Everything continuously in flux,
New things from new they born.

Exhausting in a timeless pulsation,
Reached many eternities
Akin with infinity, akin with death
I'm breaking all barriers
(Revelation of existence. Eternity...)

Unknown peace descended over me,
Not that I was familiar with,
The peace that descends when life transcends to death.
Death... the beginning of eternal silence.
