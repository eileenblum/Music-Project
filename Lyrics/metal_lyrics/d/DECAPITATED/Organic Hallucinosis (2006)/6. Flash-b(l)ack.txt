Black worms and exclamations
Challenge of spoken lies
Holocaust - filled greed and ignorance
The betrayal of human laws

Eruption of pain
Infection of sensual sickness
What are our secret fears?
Black in snow of ice tears...

Screams of lust echo through the earth
Striving for that final truth
Beckoning it with our call
Ignored by pain and misery

Beyond the bounds we flow
Searching for the exit
Goats under mass hypnosis
(only) symbols of rape remain
