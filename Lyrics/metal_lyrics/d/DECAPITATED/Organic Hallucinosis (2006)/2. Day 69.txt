(The) shaft of daylight melts dirty panes
(The) stench of life pulls them out from (their) dreams
Those living wastes on the streets outside
Woken up again with no place to hide

Daily food like shit and beer
Daily bread as tough as steel
(and) this taste is stronger than heroin
I open cardboard door to see
An empty face flowing by... like a stream
As a river of shit pours over me
(The) secretions of city mass machine
Sewers running through my veins
Acid corroding remains of my brain...
