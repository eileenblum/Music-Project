Faceless faces in the "net"
Sleepless watchers of mankind (us)
The society of "chosen ones"
(No) traces left behind

Masked by mist and mystery
Dim lit heads, the masterminds
Transparent faces - silent control
Yet knowing - the unknown

Motionless spawns, governors of life
Hold sway over the earth... (eternally)
Hidden faces, superior command
Owners (of the) portal, of mass control

Rulers of this planet. Lord of the flies (us!)
Raging wars, spreading lies, in control, over mankind.

We the slaves. We the mass (We the flies)
Knowing nothing in the hands of imaginary gods.

Rulers of this planet. Lord of the flies (us!)
Raging wars, spreading lies, in control, over mankind.
