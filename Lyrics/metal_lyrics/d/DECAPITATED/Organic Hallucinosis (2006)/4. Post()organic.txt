Sodium sunrise burns my eyes
Electric charged reanimation
I must recombine my (scattered) mind
After techno-crucifixion

Growling engines
Transmitting praise
Audio sensors detecting wavs
The factory
Reanimates me
As a post organic form of life

Vacuum breath on the surface
Of my positron skin
Covered by the barbed wire
And life-proof membrane

I'm the factory's newest product
Son of serialized destruction
Perfect body - perfect soul
Reborn in a post organic form of life

Oxygen - no longer needed
Brain - lobotomized
Heart - pumping cyanide
Arms - mechanized
Eyes - throwing x-rays
Tissues - mummified
Erased - my memory
All the rest is vaporized

Baptized in a lake of acid tears
I am resurrected in a toxic soul
Hardware body - software soul
In post organic form
Appeared

I've seen the android god preaching
Radiating his nuclear love
I've seen the world around
Bewitched in a pill of mescaline.
