the body of god who died and rose from the dead 
the eye of the body which will never be killed 
first trinity above the earth taking care 
and the god of the night, desert, and storm 
your stony cemeteries 
impossible to destroy, above time flowing 
in the gloom of the night 
in the light of the eye of horus 
they last 
eternal truth,power of words and knowledge 
the river of life, the land of the dead 
fathers of the moon, creators of clandestine books 
and son of su,cursed,powerful 
gods with stolen names 
rituals forgotten forever 
gods of the land which doesnt exist 
the eye of horus a monument of the world 
which is left to oblivion
