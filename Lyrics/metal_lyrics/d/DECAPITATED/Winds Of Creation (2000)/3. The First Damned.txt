i in the abyss on the ruins of my dreams 
my burnt world god treads on the cinders 
envy and revenge two sisters i am their brother 
is it my fault that i am a human being? 
i wont forget how the wind was blowing in your gardens 
i was your knight i was a traitor 
i, created to die, to fall into the abyss 
my existence for you to have your flower 
your gardens grow on my soul 
the roots of your trees draw juice from my blood 
and yield fruit from my wounds 
your world comes from my pain 
my wandering your triumph my cry for you to existmy feelings, longing,and rebellion 
i suffer at the bottom unnecessary for you 
for the first time the question- why me? 
the fire wont flare up in my soul 
chained to my dreams forever 
unfulfilled ,unreal but i last 
and ill be a thorn in your eye forever
