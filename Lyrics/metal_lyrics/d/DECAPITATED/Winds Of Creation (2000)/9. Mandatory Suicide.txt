murder at your every footstep 
a childs toy sudden death 
sniper blazes you through your knees 
falling down can you feel the heat 
burn 
ambushed by the spray of lead 
count the bullet holes in your head 
offspring sent out to cry 
living mandatory suicide 
suicide 
holes burn deep in your chest 
raked by machine gun fire 
screaming skull sent out to die 
living mandatory suicide 
suicide 
lying dying screaming in pain begging pleading bullets drip like rain 
minds explode pain shears to your brain 
radical amputation this is insane 
fly swatter stakes drive through your chest 
spikes impale you as your forced off the crest 
soldier of misfortune 
hunting with bated breath 
a vile smell like tasting death 
dead bodies dying and wounded 
litter the city streets 
shattered glass bits of clothing and human deceit 
dying terror 
bloods cheap its everywhere 
mandatory suicide massacre on the front line
