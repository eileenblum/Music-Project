it was night when they came 
evil and deceit were hidden under frocks 
on their necks-crosses in their hands-swords 
they came to kill on behalf of their God 
dissimilarity is imprisoned 
in the darkness of the dungeons 
the old faith impaled on the stake 
old holy groves were destroyed 
in the name of the cross 
against other people 
against the truth 
against everyone 
against yourself 
tortures of liberated souls 
which are decaying in the cells of the ecclesiastical strongholds 
the knights of good are distributing death 
spreading violence in the name of God
