when the warriors of the gloom came 
when the wolf of the night conquered the sun 
time of revenge and death set in 
the sons of fire shed the blood of gods 
nine steps towards victory of the night 
nine steps to the comeback of chaos 
nine steps to eternal darkness 
nine steps to death 
when the time of the northern rulers was over 
like a drop of blod in the sea of eternity 
thors blood sealed up their end 
the dusk of gods set in 
but their names will never be forgotten 
the memory of these centuries will never pass away 
thors blood still flows in the northern rivers 
thors hamer will shed the fresh blood again
