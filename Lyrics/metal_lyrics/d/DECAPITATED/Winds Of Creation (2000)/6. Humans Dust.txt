light- a flash in the eye of the truth 
darkness- a sea of eternal sin 
we, the shadows without destination 
following the spark, the whisper of the unknown 
the beast of time and truth of the universe 
the human thought trudging from the creation 
to catch a falsity that is no more 
the struggle of forces the struggle of the unknown 
one that defies the dust and ruin ofmankind 
the fire of the truth burning bright forever 
whose light in the world is but visible 
children of the stars that glare without death 
are burning the moment to expire forever 
tears and pain are signs of futile desires 
unknown and lost in the storms of force
