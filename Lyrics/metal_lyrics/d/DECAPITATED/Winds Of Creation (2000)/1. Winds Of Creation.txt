in the beginning there was chaos 
in which the germ of the beginning and the rights 
they emerged from the tangled elements 
not brightness, not human being but dusk 
from which earth and day came into existence 
brightness- a daughter of darkness, not of spirit 
the black sky without its jewels stars 
gave the glory to its father with brilliance 
first parents Ereb-night, eternal night 
and their fruit, mankind, constrains the tribe 
the toys of elements,the children of dreams 
their gods are only illusions 
human rights crushed in the fingers of the might 
long centuries the sleep of mother earth 
the sleep so coloured real but fog woven 
and awakening will come from dusk
