When the warriors of the gloom came
When the wolf of the night conquered the sun
Time of revenge and death set in
The sons of fire shed the blood of gods
Nine steps towards victory of the night
Nine steps to the comeback of chaos
Nine steps to eternal darkness
Nine steps to death
When the time of the northern rulers was over
Like a drop of blood in the sea of eternity
Thor's blood sealed up their end
The dusk of gods set in
But their names will never be forgotten
The memory of these centuries will never pass away
Thor's blood still flows in the northern rivers
Thor's hammer will shed the fresh blood again
