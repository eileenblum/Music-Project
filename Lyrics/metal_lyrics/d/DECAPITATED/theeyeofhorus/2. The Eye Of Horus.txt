The body of god who died and rose from the dead
The eye of the body which will never be killed
First trinity above the earth taking care
And the god of the night, desert, and storm
Your stony cemeteries
Impossible to destroy, above time flowing
In the gloom of the night
In the light of the eye of horus
They last
Eternal truth, power of words and knowledge
The river of life, the land of the dead
Fathers of the moon, creators of clandestine books
And son of su, cursed, powerful
Gods with stolen names
Rituals forgotten forever
Gods of the land which doesnt exist
The eye of horus a monument of the world
Which is left to oblivion
