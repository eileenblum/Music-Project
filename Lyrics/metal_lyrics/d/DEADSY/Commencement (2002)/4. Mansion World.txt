Once upon, and once up high
A dandy dreamed, what means to die?
Things to come, as life goes by
The core of human equation
Tetragram presents a sign
A sign to saviorize
Turn around, I'd like to know you
Everywhere and every why
The answer lay beyond the sky
Pass through the seven satellites pass on to the place we go to
(Learn to read!)
To rhyme, to count your primes
An earthly education
(Climb A Tree!)
In life in hopes to find
(The mid-space time - dilation)
On a Mansion World, the role's reversed
A slave becomes a master
On a Mansion World, the cells converse
And life moves a little faster
We unify in the universe
To arrive in the ever after
In a Mansion World, I might like to know you
Now and then it comes to mind
I draw upon a long lost time
So don't ask me why the angels won't cry 'cause you know what I've already told you
Memories of the Urantia girls they race around my brain in swirls
You never ask me why the change is in the sky bring you up which to the hole
that you go through
And now you're off you've done the time
Prepare for divine invasion
As the spirit binds Morontia minds
Ascend to the cosmic nation
On a Mansion World, the role's reversed
A slave becomes a master
On a Mansion World, the cells converse
And life moves a little faster
We unify in the universe
To arrive in the ever after
On a Mansion World, I might like to know you
New Urantia girl, everything's below you
On a Mansion World, the role's reversed
A slave becomes a master
On a Mansion World, the cells converse
And life moves a little faster
We unify in the universe
To arrive in the ever after
On a Mansion World, I might like to know you
Once upon, and once up high
A dandy dream, what means to die?
