I got the key, key to Gramercy Park

Every night
Looking for the fight
Thoughts on the left
The action's on the right
As you know, the id wasn't meant to be starved

Face white
Revenge of the Hittites
When you're inside
And you thought to take a walk in the park
Think someone is about to be carved

From the other side of the Underscene
To the boulevard of broken dreams
To find a way to Gramercy Park

I got the key, key to Gramercy Park
Where it's safe to be afraid of the dark
Maybe there we'll fuck by the heavenly stars
But I might, might miss breaking in through the bars

From the other side of the Underscene
To the boulevard of broken dreams
To find a way to Gramercy Park
In the other time of mother speed
Through evil eyes and make believe
Where it's safe to be afraid of the dark

And never look at the other place
Stay with what's pristine that touches you
Where the peril accentuates
Something that could mean so much to you
Try save a seat in the golden cage
The media mass has still yet to say
To simply pass or rise from the grave

Now I've got the key to Gramercy Park
Out of my way and I'm safe, not afraid of the dark
Now I've got the key to Gramercy Park
But I might, might miss breaking in through the bars
