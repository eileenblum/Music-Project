...Thinking of the smell that flows of your mouth
or in the light, that shines in your eyes

I shall suffer I'll fly through the waves any place where the body shakes

Where the body is flesh when your eyes are grace are you insensible
or am I insatiable?

Your sins are seeds of my tears that make me rise.
in every sky in every hell is your smile.

Where the body is flesh when your eyes are grace are you insensible
or am I insatiable?

And it's when the horizon is green and pale or when the tiny snow
is reek their faces.

Please let me shine with your sweaty smile please darken my heart
with your knowledge wise.

Until the finals
until the gate
bless me with your right hand
here is my head.

Until the finals
until fate
take with your right hand
my wrinkled face.

In front
to fly
through space
I'm flying slowly.

I must stay reserved
and follow your trace,
fire is not burning
fog is not blinding me.

Please let me shine
with your sweaty smile
please darken my heart
with your knowledge wise.

Your sins are seeds
of my tears
that make me rise,
In every sky
in every hell
is your smile.
