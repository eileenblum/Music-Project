[1st Mov. The Conflict]

Bleed, die, fight! after you've seen
stop, shout! whilst the morning was tempt.

Walk, run, sleep! in your space, on your way
dream, clean! at the wisdom that hate.

Feel heat, cold in your mechanical style
in your bionic heart in your cynical mind.

Go, wait, breathe! this stair is too big
drink, smoke Cause space will be killed.
