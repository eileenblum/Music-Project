I've seen insane hearts
falling down and falling out
but I'm feeling really cold
and I feel my soul alone.

Fear, tragic fear
when I feel my bleeding nails
now I can't see
oh my god, I can't hear!

Hear I can't hear
and my legs are failing me
I can't believe
someone lives inside me.

Shattered confessions
from your blue iced sky
sadless apprehension
of your frivolous mind.

Now I'm writing three or more words
for read my blurred right hand
I will lie again to god
to survive this morbid night.

Far away, behold the shining star
even when you die
prepare your wings to fly
and free the dark desires.

Fear, tragic fear
when I see my rotting hands
spelling the winds
when the clouds are much too light.

Missing my dreams
when I feel your gentle breeze
sleep after kill
In long tearless night.

Shattered confessions
from your blue iced sky
sadless apprehension
of your frivolous mind.

In every secret place
keeping blurred smiles
unholy way to die.

In every special place
keeping lost sides.
