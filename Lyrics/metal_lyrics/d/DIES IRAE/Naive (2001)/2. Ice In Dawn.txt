I feel cold
My life is too short
But I know
My way is long.

I would write
About my life
That will rise
Around this night.

But I've found my faith denied
When I search the word divine,
I want to spit on this fucking time
All my hate upon the lies.

But my faith is falling down
There's a heaven that I've found
It's a crime
It's a spite
It's my heart like ice in dawn?

They're my wound, my red flesh blood
That makes my soul lost
It's my hands, that hurt my mind
Or my mind that falls in strife.

It's the wind, my end, my past
That it freezes my body fast
It's the rain that wets my life
Or the night that may retire.

But my fate is falling down
There's a heaven that I've found
It's a crime
It's a spite
It's my heart like ice in dawn?

I feel cold I'm in the storm but I feign my god is gone
I'm just a slave of olden times I just betrayed their holy stars.

But I find my faith denied when I spit the world divine
I want to search this fucking time all my hate upon the lies.

I've been close I'll end my road what I've done that makes me fall I'm
just laughing of olden time I'm a slave
from shades and fire.

They're my wounds, my red fresh blood that it make my soul lost
they're my hands, that hurt my mind or my mind that falls in strife.

But my fate is falling down there's a heaven that I've found It's a crime
It's my spite is my heart like ice in dawn.
