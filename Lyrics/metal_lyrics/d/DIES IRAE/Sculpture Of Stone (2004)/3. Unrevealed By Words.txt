at times, as you look
into the void
she glares at you too
reveals her true face
the face unrevealed
by words
nor with gestures
is it shown

the face with no feelings,
expression, abyss, chaos,
pain and anguish
at times, when you look
into the darkness
you shall see the face
of your own
and fear shall swallow
your soul

and there cries your being
your entrails are twisted
in pain
your blood turns
into a flowing fire
your mind fades
into oblivion
