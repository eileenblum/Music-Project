the moon shines bright
among the stars
deity among angels
unquestionable ruler
so bright, so cold, so endless
when it calls they obey
lunatic faceless creatures
mesmerized by its aura

blood boils in veins
shadows spy on their masters
strange scent in the air
betrays the pray to hunters
excitement sharpens senses
all shapes become clearer
time stops, the hunt begins

the hunger is appeased
hypnotic trans gives
in narcotic extasy
calms down
the wrath within
lazy indifference
drunk eyes seem blind
yet watching
things that
are not really there

again moon shines
among stars
deity among angels
unquestionable ruler
so bright, so majestic
again it calls they obey
hypnotized by its aura
time stops, the hunt begins
