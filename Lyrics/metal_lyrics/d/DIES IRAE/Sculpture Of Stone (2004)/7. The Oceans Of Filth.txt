in a moral embrace
the giants are met,
fighting for dominion
I am the jugde and the end
and death I became,
destruction of all the worlds
when the time is ripe
I shall spit out
the plague from my guts

I am the day that passed
the eternal frost of your soul

the final cry of the fading life
shall the universe bear for all times
into the black void's infinity
to be the warning for other deities

I am the day that passed
future is my mother
and dusk is my father
I am the eternal frost of your soul

united with chaos
all-knowing and ruthless
I am the judge and the end
the destruction of the worlds

I am the day that passed
the eternal frost of your soul

the oceans of filth
shall dim the glow of all the suns
