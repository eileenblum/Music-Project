you, who come here
abandon all the hope
dare you look into the darkness?
in the land that spreads from
the edge of perception
and the worst nightmares
who are you to deny loathing?
you feel as the black wind
closes about you
with a lethal shroud
it emerges from the very darkness
to drain off your vital strength
you are our strength, our might
our breathing victuals
here is the key to the afterworld
dare you open those gates
to find the winding path
that leads through this realm
undiscovered since
the beggining of time
face the beings from beyond
all dimensions
them who bring insanity
are you ready to kill
or else this shall be your end
