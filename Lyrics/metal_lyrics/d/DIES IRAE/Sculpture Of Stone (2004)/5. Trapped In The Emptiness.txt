every droplet of blood
measures the time of the world
trapped in the emptiness
of the humanity's ignorance

demons driven by hunger
craving for human's fear
they linger by the edge of terror
aware of their time drawing nigh

cruel is the time, its passing slow
as a wide listless river
in its gloomy deeps, it drowns
the pathetic lives
of the pitiful beings

whose kingdom shall reign?
when the demons
swallow the world
who shall reign the dead?
for whom the dead,
empty minds?
