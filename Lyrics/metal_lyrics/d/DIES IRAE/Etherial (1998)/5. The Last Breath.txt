I halt me and retractafter I observe it,I don't believe itI behold the sky lightthat crave into my coming,I try enterbut my soul it hinderslowly the light tuns off. I wish as much as live like dieI love the darknessbut descend in her,will excite me. Into silent valleyI been lost,I don't will know where or whenI will know that I have die. Only you that be lightyou, king of dimensionsjudge of your lawsmistress of my own destinyslowly the light turns off. Oh! broken mirrorthere isn't way beyondOh! Time Masterplease stop here. I need the knowledge keyWhere are youthat I can't see?I need the silver keyfor open your castle doors. A book sealed with my own bloodwill me know that I have die. Ten minutes, let's bringto my last breath,like the final of a song,like will close in my soulwill lost the darkness takewhere cries even make a sound. Into silent valleyI been lostI don't will knowWhere or When. Only you that be lightyou, king of dimensionsmistress of my own destiny Oh! broken mirrorthere isn't way beyondOh! Time Masterplease stop here.
