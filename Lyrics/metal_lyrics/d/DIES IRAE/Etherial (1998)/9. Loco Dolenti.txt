It's for methat the rosewill turn black;It's for youthat my heartwill stop too late. I can't singthis song, becauseyou'll be therebehind the starsamon the birdsinto the skybeyond the night. Finally, I knowthat the timeisn't for us,and the lifenever will end,but you and mewill meet us,there, in the eternalspace, too soonthan late.
