Your mind feel just a feverheart lost into the river,transport your space to skydon't tell me another lie. Fleshthe carnal sensesgo beyond the spiritInfallible shadow of the wish,dismembering the pleasure delights. Woundis time for clos (The doors)for another fallinto a distant hellinto a frozen dawn. Bloodnow is time for bleedmaybe, one more timethe sins will be the samebut how it will be more nice. Fallit's hard to liveso wild!understand the faithand why? Believe in the morning stars. Mindtransport your space to skyignore your stupid crydon't tell me another lie. Feveryour mind feel just a feverheart lost into the riverso hard but I believe itjust make a change and do it.
