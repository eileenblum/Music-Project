This nightin a sensual immensitythe groves, the passionthe intensive silenceand the floaty snowin a road without walls. I had a birds dreamthat fly without wingsand a bendage in their eyesjust blinded their way. I wouldn't say notI don't needed leg as wingsI've only need the cordto approach me every step to you. To feel the smokeI feel that had fireand beyond years, dustand newly the flames. The ambient and the rare faces,is not just the anger. To feel the warmI feel that had fireanf behind wars, dustand newly the pain. But isn't just the flames,isn't just the affliction. Isn't just the indifferencebut the load of fault and agonyand beyond winds, the woundand finally the crust. Isn't just the flamesnow, I want to awake. A twister close to the roadwhilst the body floatedin that dream, in that night,in that sensual reality. The time was wall for warmy soul among the swordswithout thing that I'll be thereand could be the carnal ghostthat violate my long veilbut I know that in the faithnot rest upon mebecause I knowthat even had fire. To feel the warmI feel that had fireIsn't just the indifferencebut the load of fault and agonybut isn't just the flames,Isn't just the same,isn't just the flamesnow I want to awake.
