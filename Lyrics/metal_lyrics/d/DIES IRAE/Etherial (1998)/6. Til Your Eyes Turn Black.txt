Illusion confusedfrom sigh to tearsa feeling of oblivion. Nothing is the samea whisper in your ear,nothing is the samebut I say I can't hearbeyond your liea truelly word forbide. We will be faithfulor maybe just believersWe will like planetsin mystical sceneryWe will like angelsunder pendent clouds. Desert fieldguide me in your rootsplease, be my torturelike the snowsometimes was for you. Beyond desireI go into your hellin that enormous clarityin that intense burning It shall be because of methat I once thought,That I prevent the cryThat I once feltThat I shouldn't say a lie It shall be because of methat I once smileThat I ignore the tideThat I will be blindand overtake the pain This time I distinguishflowers of thorns,When the flesh commands,you become nothing,and in the emptiness gets lostnothing of nothing Something was lostthe earth is reek of sexwill be the place electedfor mankind.That will be again Victim of insanity.The smile of the soulswill bath the heavenwith blood,the battle is don't be battlebut a irrelevant successSometime they will dothe spirit is their nightmare. And like mankindVictims of their own qualitieshere, we are lives, deads,is the last word.
