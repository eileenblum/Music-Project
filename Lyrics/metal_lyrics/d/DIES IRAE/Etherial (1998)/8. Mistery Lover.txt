Insufficient airat the time of crime,I see youBut I don't thinkthat my lifeIs just a snub. I will do itand you are goingto take me by the head,but it's normal, crudewith my dusty lipsI will kiss youuntil your skin turns pale.White as the distant clouds,and running behind timeyou'll never avoid my presence. Your animal bloodthat flows in thejudgment of the soulbreaks the laws of sacrificeThat rips the truth,because I'll be thereand at your sideI'll wait the anger path. And again,to care the thoughtfrom the sameimpenetrable helllong and wavy road. I know that you awake sleepthe cloak and your skinwill be the same,losting the winterthe betray. In the disillusionstay the truth,behind the truth. I'll kiss you againand your skinbe most than honey,your milk bloodwill stay alive,as your warm flesh. Frantic love among thebeastsyou'll be most than evermys mystery loveryou'll never regretIf I'll just see youyou'll be mineforever.
