I shall be freewhen the time has come,the misery will goneand bring me back my soul. My ethereal landscapewill be the gate of love and trustthrough the sand and through the snowI will cross, my eternal road. No more rage and no more bloodthat just recalls for twisted worldsI don't care if I'm faileddon't want damages in my way. Something shinning at the woodsmore even than youbring me rest to all my dreamsdreams of blood and dreams of ghouls. Watch my sleep in this long nightshadow finder of all talesseedind sperm, sperm of deaththousand races will segregate.All my plans fall to decayall those banished, even sky!And the sky will turn to blackat the day when I come back When the hell will come to mefor the deepest feels of lostI'll just felt so offendthen I believed in heavens lost. All my faith will fallen dawnno more wall fances to my eyesall confused, no place to goone more battle, you and I. Times of torments coming outthorny grounds will growing upno more shines lighting my pathbut I don't care because I know,from those ashes I'll reborn.
