Divided soul
Divided body
Cauldron of thoughts
Nine, nine, nine
Open the gate
The ninth level
Illumination of cosen one

Fixed star
Of invisible light
The darkest obssesion
Fidelity of purposes
Which opens the gate
The ninth level
Illumination of cosen one

Infinity of paths
Neverending war
Extraordinary effort
Reccurent influx
Of thoughts
Which opens the gate
The ninth level
Illumination of chosen one

Haphazard dissolution
Of integrity
I am loosing my mind
The last thing after
I enter
The ninth level
For chosen one
