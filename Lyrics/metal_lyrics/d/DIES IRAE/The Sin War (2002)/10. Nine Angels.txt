The first - infinite
I call thee
The second - master
I call thee
The third - messenger
I call thee

The ceremony
Nine beings in figures
In ultraviolet
Azathoth - center of the cosmo
Yog-Sothoth - master of dimensions
Nyarlathothep - prince of the abyss
God of dreams
Shub-Niggurath - the goat of a thousand young
I call thee
On the wings
Of nine angels

The fourth - Ram
I call thee
The fifth - hornless
I call thee
The sixth - sleep
I call thee

Nine angels
The flame of the beginning
And ending of dimensions
I proclaim
Strong bonds with daemons
Daemons of creation
I displume angels of heaven
We are the dreams of chosens
Who are awakening
And man shall speak
In tongue of thee
I conquer the world
In avulsion with heaven

The seventh - ruin
I call thee
The eighth - master
I call thee
The ninth - flame
I call thee
Hail!
