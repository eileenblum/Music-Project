I consume your soul
Flames of armageddon
Raised swords
Heavens gate are shattering

No mercy for the fallen ones
Iron will of desecration
Stronger that mercy
Dwelling in hell

Comrade of death
I am comrade of death

Dark sky in pursuit of light
Blue eyed devils
Howling in the night
Silver moon over the earth

The fall of idols
In the beginning of the end
Horsemen of apocalypse
Conquering a spiritless earth

Comrade of death
I am comrade of death

I expel enemies
Reducing to naught protectors
Covenant with dark forces
Leading to the throne

Comrade of death
I am comrade of death
