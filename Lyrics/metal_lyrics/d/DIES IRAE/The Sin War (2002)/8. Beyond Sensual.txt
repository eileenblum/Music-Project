The inexorable aim
Aim of illumination
Veryfication of theories
On different levels
Engaged
Entirely beyond sensual
Without consolation
In half way
Mode is direct
Uncertain of significance
Lost amongst
Gaping sea of views
Dicersification
Deep urge
Penetration of conditions
Latent for mortals
For their blases
Unwitting way of answers
Self assurance
Lack of scrutinity
Mixed with envy

I am hungry
Gaze delineate the path
Of ubiquitious
I am immerse in this sea
To fight right answer
For right question
