Vacuum, nothingness
Abyss, black space
Infinity, emptiness

Man as the torch
man as the scourge
He vacillate
Beneficence and cruelty
Animal sex
Philosoficial discussion
Both sides
Of the same medal

Vacuum, nothingness
Abyss, black space
Infinity, emptiness

As the necrotic nerve
We wake our consciousness
But after centuries
We are not nearer our goal
Necessary effort
Spread the nebula of dogmas

Vacuum, nothingness
Abyss, black space
Infinity, emptiness

In god-kennel
There's no place
For questions
Empty-headed
Followers of truth
In dangerous tribe
On the earth

Vacuum, nothingness
Abyss, black space
Infinity, emptiness

I am thee enemy
Cause I think
