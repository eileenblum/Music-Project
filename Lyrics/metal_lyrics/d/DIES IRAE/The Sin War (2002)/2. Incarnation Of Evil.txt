You pray
You kneel
You worship
For thousands years
You sacrifice

I am the holy son
Created from the chaos
As the god of the race
Of humanrats
As the heir of evil
I rule on earth

You pray
My will
You sacrifice
My will
My vanity

All energy and faith
All hassle and pain
Gaol in the garden
Legacy of sin
Radiant sign
Of incarnated evil

You pray
My will
You sacrifice
My will
My vanity

Toppled sculpture
The godhead in ruins
Outflow of goodness
As my reprisal
Ruthless I am
And incarnation of evil
