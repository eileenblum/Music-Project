That, which sleep
Is a part of the soul
That, which watch
Is a part of the watching
I know what I am looking for
And I am looking for things
I already know
Contradiction and duality
Contradiction and unity
Of different levels
Of perception
I am wandering
To the innerspace
Of soul
I am looking for the truth
Cause this is my path
Cause this is my destination
Love under will
The key of develop
From rationality to purification
And at the end
The shapeless flame
Wirling voice
The child wilding the bow of light
Standing on horseback
Painted in gold
Symbols united as the lion
Of knowledge and truth
