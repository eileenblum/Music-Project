Behold! 
I'm yesterday
I'm today
I'm brother of tomorrow
So priest said and
So I'm saying now but
Can you hear the demons?
They're awaiting for you
Who rules your innerspace?
Who commands your soul?
Little sins, little wickedness
Lead us to our private hell
And every day, and every night
We face the truth of ourselves
The linear evolution of our greeds
Desires running like the wild
Deprivation of the 10th commandments
Human laws versus nature
Kindness versus instincts
Swornenemies
This eternal war
Has winner for the beginning
So supplant the Christ
And bring back the true law
For every aspect of your life
This change will become
Turning point.
