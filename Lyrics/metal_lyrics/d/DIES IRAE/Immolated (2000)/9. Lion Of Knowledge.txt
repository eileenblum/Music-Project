Transforming into Mobed
For pleasure of mind, body and soul
For all gods
You'll see the light
Shapeless fire of knowledge which
Whirl and clamour again and again

Standing on the shoulders
Horseback painted in gold
The child wielding the bow
Shod in flames

So let's rise our hands
And free our minds
So let's plunge into nihil, into Nuit
Where children of sun and moon
Shine upon our earthly consciousness

Evil against good
Aryman versus Ahura
Soul united with Daina
All parts swimming across macrocosm
Decomposition of our being
Into different dimensions
