"As (the ark) landed, the weight of the ark caused the "blood" to spurt the sky
and gave the star of the tenth moon (...) reality and brilliance".

Dogon oral tradition

They came for us
From Ursa Maior's Child
From the Sirius, the dog star
Nommos, beings of other race
Dividing their bodies among men
They give us forbidden answer
For forbidden questions
We are not alone on the earth
We are not alone in the universe
Masters dwelled in water
Saviors, Monitors, Instructors
Crucified and resurrected
Returned to the stars
Home made of sagala
The brightest and the heaviest star
One day in the future
Nommos will visit the earth again
But this time in human skin
And when assume amphibious form
They become rulers of this place.
