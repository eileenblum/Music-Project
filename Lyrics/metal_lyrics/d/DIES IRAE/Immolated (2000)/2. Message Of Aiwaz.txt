[This lyric is inspired by "Liber Al vel Legis", "The Message of Aiwaz" proclaims the beginning of New Aeon, Aeon of Horus. The Law of Thelema now rules this world.]

When messenger arrived
The groundworks of world shook
And priests-hypocrites trembled
Aiwaz has brought knowledge
And the Equinox of Gods began
He liberated all stars from the bonds
The religious bonds of law and order
And each of them has found

His own sphere of action
And the New Aeon began

When messenger arrived
We took our lot in our hands
Following the law of 93
And worshiping Khabs
We became children of son and moon

I am the snake who
Gives knowledge, delight and glory
I am the snake who
Curses "because" and mercy

What is the law?
Love is the law, love under will
The law of 93.
