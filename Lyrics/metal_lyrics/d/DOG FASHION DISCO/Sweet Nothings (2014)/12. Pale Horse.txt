Staring at the hourglass I hear them marching
Locked in precision Goose-stepping approaching
Reduced to ash, rubble and dust
Mental defects in the brain trust
And now the lonely in their darkest hour
Fall at the hands of obscene power

Heart of the pale horse, pumping and pounding
Chomping at the bit, waiting for the hammer to fall
for the hammer to fall
Ghosts of war walk the killing fields
No second thoughts only a stitch in time
Accomplice to the perfect crime

Everyday illusion don't even bother
You're no competition, don't waste your time
Murder the masses now ash and dust
Worms eat away at the brain trust
And now left hopeless in their darkest hour
Fall at the hands of obscene power

Heart of the pale horse, pumping and pounding
Chomping at the bit, waiting for the hammer to fall
for the hammer to fall
Ghosts of war walk the killing fields
No second thoughts only a stitch in time
Accomplice to the perfect crime

Mortal man thorny crown
Rabid dogs hunt you down
Sinful soul empty hole
Growing numb left you cold

Behold the pale horse
Devouring man
swallowing souls
Tonight we ride
with death in full stride
Tonight we ride
into the cold dark and unknown

Behold the pale horse
and his lone rider
Devouring man
swallowing souls
Devouring man
swallowing souls

Heart of the pale horse, pumping and pounding
Chomping at the bit, waiting for the hammer to fall
for the hammer to fall
Ghosts of war walk the killing fields
No second thoughts only a stitch in time
Accomplice to the perfect crime

Tonight we ride
with death in full stride
Tonight we ride
into the cold dark and unknown [2x]
