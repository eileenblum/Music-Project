This ain't no Armageddon sunrise
This ain't no Hiroshima bomb
This ain't no mushroom cloud laying mother.
This ain't no time space continuum.

Suicide was once my valentine
Now she's laying beside me under the sun
It's no longer cheap to get a proper high
Hit the streets and ask anyone

I eat Hexes for breakfast
Join Sinners for dinner
As the baboons grow louder
My patience grows thinner
Silver bullets in the messenger
Before he can speak
of some horrid abominations
And the plight of the meek

Suicide was once my valentine
Now she's laying beside me under the sun
It's no longer cheap to get a proper high
Hit the streets and ask anyone

I sit and stare at the phone
Inside my head no one's home
The dog is chewing his bones
and in my head no one's home

I say your name over and over repeating
On bloodied knees, I'm begging and pleading
To a God that stares at me through the ceiling
Answer my prayers, anoint me a healing

I sit and stare at the phone
Inside my head no one's home.

The doctor ordered what?
A spoonful won't do?
20 milligrams of Xanax
in the witches brew
Bull whip the synapse
To survive the 9 to 5
Wife and kids, white picket fence
You made your hell, now lay in it

Suicide was once my valentine
Now she's laying beside me under the sun
It's no longer cheap to get a proper high
Hit the streets and ask anyone
