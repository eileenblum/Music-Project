Dancing like a cobra
up on the silver screen
You haunt my nightmares
You hide in my dreams

Without words
you speak to me
Thoughts caught in clouds
the wind through the trees

I'm laying in the gutter
and telling myself
Love may be a leper
it's bad for my health

I don't want to wait til tomorrow
And you don't want to wait for me
I don't want to wait til tomorrow
And you don't want to wait for me
