Now sterilized
we're lily white
With no evidence
we eat our own
So gluttonous
turn to their young
To satiate
they eat their own

Come out, come out
Wherever you are
Come out and play
Wherever you are

Rose buds bloom all over you
Reptilian skin to scales
You stoke the fire without mercy
The fragile betray the frail

Foul is our home
Our den not solemn
Hunger pangs,
I take you in
Come out and play
Wherever you are

Possess the masses
with your snake charm smile
Now our fever is rising high
Overdosed under your spell
I feel your grip
I know it well

Scarlet fever rising high [2x]

Come out, come out
Wherever you are
Come out and play
Wherever you are

Foul is our home
Our den not solemn
Hunger pangs and jaundice skin
Come out and play
Wherever you are

Now overdosed
Under your spell
I feel your grip
I know it well
