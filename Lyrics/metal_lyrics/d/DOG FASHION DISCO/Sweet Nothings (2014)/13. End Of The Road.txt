A wise man once said "Life's just a ride"
Only illusion only a ride
It's brightly colored
goes up and down
Thrills and chills
around and around

But I feel that pale death creeping in
I see my mother's face now grieving
I feel that pale death creeping in
This must be the dead end of the road

A wise man once said
the eyes of love
See us all as one
As below so above
Far from the rainbow
The storms roll in
and as soon as they're here
Then they're gone with the wind

But I feel that pale death creeping in
I see my mother's face now grieving
I feel that pale death creeping in
This must be the dead end of the road

The last midnight
The last sunrise
The last song
Gaze into your eyes

Every breath
Every tear
All of the love
All of the fear

I feel that pale death creeping in
I feel that pale death creeping in
I see my mother's face now grieving
I feel that pale death creeping in

On and on and on and on. [12x]
