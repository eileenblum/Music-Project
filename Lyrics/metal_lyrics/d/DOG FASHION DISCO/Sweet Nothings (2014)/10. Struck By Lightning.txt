Electro shocking treatment
Bug zapping inner demons
I see storm clouds clearing away
Once hissing in a corner
I know now I'm changing form
and if it's for the better, let's roll
Let's roll

Over the moon I'll make it mine
I've got the wind under my wings
The skies are wide and smiling

I feel the love electric lightning striking everywhere
No fear, no reason to hide
I feel the love down to the marrow in my bones
Oh how beautifully calming

Scarecrows and sparrows
Cupid shooting all his arrows
The green fields are vast and calling my name
Tin men and lions blow a kiss to dandelions
and clearly see the error of their ways

Over the moon I'll make it mine
I've got the wind under my wings
The skies are wide and smiling

I feel the love electric lightning striking everywhere
No fear, no reason to hide
I feel the love down to the marrow in my bones
Oh how beautifully calming

Under the sunshine
Only you and I
On the white sand shore
Emeralds waters kiss the horizon
This is paradise
Only you and I

This is paradise
Only you and I

I feel the love, lightning striking everywhere
No fear, no reason to hide
I feel the love down to the marrow in my bones
Oh how beautifully calming
