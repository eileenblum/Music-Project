Before they set the world on fire
by decree of the almighty profit
Before the strike the match stick
they passed out big cigars

They'll sell you a dream
but it's all a lie
They'll spend all your money
on party supplies
They'll act so sincere
pretending to care
They'll pump you with fear
broadcast through the air

I don't want to come to your war party
A VIP ticket to a blood orgy

Poisoned food
no water to drink
with the terror threat high
Does it help to think
that your government's in control?
As the pawns all play their role
And the dead begin coming home
And the pawns have played their role

Before they pull the death card
it's champagne all around
As smiling glad hands
wave false flags

Napalm
Cyanide
Burning bodies
piled high
Hiroshima
Vietnam
Jesus Christ
Islam
Cold War
Communism
Palestine
Zionism
Holocaust
genocide
mass decay
suicide

Endless wars
feed the machine
Industrial complex
an empire of greed
If we can't find a profit in peace
they'll continue to feed the beast

It's 1, 2, 3
what're we fighting for?
Don't ask me I don't give a damn
Next stop might be Iran

Ain't no time to wonder why
Whoopee, we're all going to die
As the pawns all play their role
and the dead are coming home
And the pawns have played their role
and the dead are flying home

Embrace no evil
fear no enemy
Send in the bulls
to a blood orgy

They'll sell you a dream
but it's all a lie
They'll spend all your money
on party supplies
They'll act so sincere
pretending to care
They'll pump you with fear
broadcast through the air

No one wants to come to your war party
A VIP ticket to a blood orgy

Poisoned food
no water to drink
with the terror threat high
Does it help to think
that your government's in control?
As the pawns all play their role
Now the dead begin coming home
And the pawns have played their role

I don't want to come to your war party
