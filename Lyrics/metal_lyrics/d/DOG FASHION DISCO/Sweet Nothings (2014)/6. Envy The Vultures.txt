Cat scratches and smoke burns
on her face and hands
Neglected children build castles
in quicksand
Tongue lashes
and whip cracking innocence
Empty mouths
craving spoonfuls of pestilence

Burn down the harvest
it's a plague nation
The golden noose
is our one and only salvation
The face I wear now is not my own, not my own
These days are rats minutes skin
And seconds are bones

Chain up the pearly gates
We're all flying south
Silence the witnesses
We're out

I envy the vultures
No conscious inside
All they can eat just
as soon as it dies
It won't taste as sweet
when it's still alive
I envy the vultures
That peck out your eyes

Scavenge the New World
Where's your spirit now?
Beckon the wake
and they all gather around
The face you wear now is not your own, not your own
These years are lions minutes skin
Seconds are bones

The face I wear is not my own
The face you wear is not your own
The skin I wear is not my own
The skin you wear is not your own

Chain up the pearly gates
We're all flying south
Silence the witnesses
We're out

I envy the vultures
No conscious inside
All they can eat just
as soon as it dies
It won't taste as sweet
when it's still alive
I envy the vultures
That peck out your eyes
I envy the vultures

Scavenge the New World
Where is your spirit now?
Beckon the wake
and they all gather around
