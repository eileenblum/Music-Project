With the whipping wind the tumbleweeds roll
Suddenly I trip and begin falling down a rabbit hole
Gravity betrays me, strangers enslave me
Neverland becomes a prison under the ground

In the poppy fields I rolled with you
Recall your skin as ocean blue
Sucking your tongue, caress your curve
Soft lips taste just like cinnamon

In a dream state underwater we embrace the tide
Gliding through the current of our midnight ride
Invincible and high never coming up for air
Invincible and high never coming down

We rant and roar
We are young forever more
Songs unsung without regret
without remorse
Fate now takes the wheel
Drives the course
Crash the car become a star
We are young forever more
And now angels begin to grow horns
Halos are melting into ashen dust
Ash and dust

Shrunken Heads
Cheshire Cat
Occam's razor
cuts the fat
All the waves we make
All the hearts we break
All the push and pull
This is just a dream
This is just a dream
It has to be a dream

Wake up
Wake up now
Ghost of malevolence
Wake up and face me
face me

Tempted in the desert
by will and mirage

No place to hide from the sun
No place to hide
No place to hide
Down the rabbit hole

We rant and roar
We are young forever more
Songs unsung without regret
without remorse
Fate now takes the wheel
Drives the course
