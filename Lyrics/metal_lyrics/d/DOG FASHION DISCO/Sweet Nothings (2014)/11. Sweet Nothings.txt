Sweet nothings whispered in my ear
Tell me all you crave now tell me all you fear
Sweet nothings help to kick me into gear
Tell me your desires, not what I want to hear

Dripping honey, hot stinger
Place your bets I'm an ace
Now I'm a dead ringer.
Tied to horses drawn to quarter
Laying in wait now to heed my order
Pillars of salt, statues of white
Moonlight wolf cries, undressing the night
I fear no evil I have not a care
As I lay beside you stroking your hair
From the vine make the wine far more
Thicker than blood as we feast on the flesh now
Spared from the flood

Necks are breaking as you walk in the room
Eyes of the envious all staring at you
Swallow my tongue, no air in my lungs
Like a Houdini punch right in the gut
Lick you out like a French kiss, buckle my knees

Wicked minds reeling emerge from the garden
Denying their God and ignoring his pardon
Empires burned and vast kingdoms fell
Now farther from heaven and hotter than hell

Sweet nothings whispered in my ear
Tell me all you crave now tell me all you fear
Sweet nothings help to kick me into gear
Tell me your desires, not what I want to hear

With my head in the clouds
and my feet on the ground
Spitting lightning at kings
Clapping thunder around

Wicked minds reeling emerge from the garden
Denying their God and ignoring his pardon
Empires burned and vast kingdoms fell
Now farther from heaven and hotter than hell

Necks are breaking as you walk in the room
Eyes of the envious all staring at you
Swallow my tongue, no air in my lungs
Like a Houdini punch right in the gut

Sweet nothings whispered in my ear
Tell me all you crave now tell me all you fear
Sweet nothings help to kick me into gear
Tell me your desires, not what I want to hear
