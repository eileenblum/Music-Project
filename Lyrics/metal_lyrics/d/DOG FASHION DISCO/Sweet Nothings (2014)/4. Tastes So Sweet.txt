One pound of flesh, no more, no less
Punching my heart, and pounding my chest
Bulging tongue, blood on my breath
Devour the hour until there's nothing left

The way you're smiling, tantalizing
Carving the bedpost, counting the passing days
Swirling embers ignite my desire
To set fire to this house ablaze

She's got those bedroom eyes
Now I finally realize
You're the sugar that makes the medicine taste so sweet
All your preaches bring my to my knees
When you wave your hand you're parting the big blue seas
Praise the lord, now you've sold out every seat

I'll follow you to the gates of hell
I've got a story and a soul to sell
Nose in the dirt, sniffing your scent
No reason to pray, confess or repent

Damage done and I'm mending my wounds
A headless thought is polluting the womb
The floor is crawling to exit the room
Not a second to late, not a minute too soon

And now I realize
What's behind those bedroom eyes
You're the sugar that makes the medicine taste so sweet
All your preaches bring my to my knees
When you wave your hand you're parting the big blue seas
Praise the lord, now you've sold out every seat

I'll follow you to the gates of hell
I've got a story and a soul to sell
Nose in the dirt, sniffing your scent
No reason to pray, confess or repent

You're the sugar that makes the medicine taste so sweet
All your preaches bring my to my knees
When you wave your hand you're parting the big blue seas
Praise the lord, now we'll sell out every seat

Tastes so sweet
