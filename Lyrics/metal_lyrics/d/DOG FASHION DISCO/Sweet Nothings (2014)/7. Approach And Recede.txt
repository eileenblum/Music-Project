Death rattle, brittle bones
No sunlight in my tomb
Echoes and emptiness
Now filling up the room
You are a snake
weaving in and out of sight
Shape shift embracing
my bitter loneliness tonight

I can't find a reason to ever push you away
Slow suicide takes my hand
and invites me to stay as

Carnal waves approach and recede
Unrelenting desire overcoming me
The more I feed it the more it needs
Pleasures now a mistress to enslave me

Drag me low down the river of denial
Drown me in your skin I feel you
Primitive and wild
Sinking in and under with nowhere left to hide
Guide me in and slow sliding deeper inside

I can't find a reason to ever push you away
Slow suicide takes my hand and invites me to stay as

Carnal waves approach and recede
Unrelenting desire overcoming me
The more I feed it the more it needs
Pleasures now a mistress to enslave me

You take the stage creeping
Beneath the neon glow
Weakness consumes me
and I don't want to let it go
Jezebel I'm frozen
At the foot of your altar
Unable to control
the fire burning me alive

I can't find a reason to ever push you away
Slow suicide takes my hand and leads me astray

Carnal waves approach and recede
Unrelenting desire overcoming me
The more I feed it the more it needs
Pleasures now a mistress to enslave me
Carnal waves approach and recede
Dominate me, let me be your slave
Dominate me, let me be your slave
be your slave
