All that once moved you
has now gone away
Packed it's bags
and boarded a train
Cattle cars
Prison bars
barbed wire isolation

Believe every word I say
Fear not tomorrow, only today

Act as though
that you know nothing at all
Mind controlled
now you know nothing at all

Hell is now empty
all the devil's are here
Feeding on fire
Binging on fear

Memories exist in the darkest light
Photos of you only black and white

Act as though
that you know nothing at all
Mind controlled
now you know nothing at all

We aren't the world
We aren't the children
We are anesthetized
As we multiply
Ignoring our fault lines
Moving on and on
As the cracks appear
Into extinction
We aren't the world
We aren't the children

It was your enemy
that led me to you
Like flies sent to wounds
that will never heal

A pox on your house
Foul disease in your swine
Chanting sick wishes
Now you will rot on the vine

We aren't the world
We aren't the children
We are anesthetized
As we multiply
Ignoring our fault lines
Moving on and on
As the cracks appear
Into extinction
We aren't the world
We aren't the children

Es ist eine kleine Welt [4x]

May you choke on your tongue
May your blood fill the streets
Like piss in a cup
you tremor and quake
Murder by numbers
accept your fate

It's a small world after all [4x]

Now the world is your stage
becomes your Mark of Cain
The Master and Slave
the Yin and the Yang
becomes your Mark of Cain
Now my tender hearts breaking
as we're waving goodbye
Now we mumble a toast
to our wasted lives

We aren't the world [4x]
