See you in hell my love, under a palm tree, sucking from a bamboo straw,
Patiently waiting for me

All night and everyday I'm in a galaxy far far away
Reborn unable to die I've committed one hundred suicides
Reicarnation, inside an astreiod field, alien skies raining stars,
Sever the lifeline to me
All night and everyday I'm in a galaxy far far away,
Rebon unable to die, I've commited one hundred suicides,
Inside this violent paradise, go waste the day they own you
Lights camre action rolling as the homicidial crows begins to kill

Abort mission head on collission as we swan dive into holy water
I remember when I was crawling in your skin, bathing in your blood
And everything you are take me to the time we walked the long way home
Through a forest full of wolves, where lovers come to die

What a day to die
