Convulsing to your violent rhythm, twisting and turning en utero
I'm out of my body and swimming trough you
A nightmarish dream like a maze
Dream like a maze, dream like a maze

From the rolling hills of suicide, everyone will run and hide
Screaming bloody murder with their heads on fire
There just may be a chance for me, my sweet insanity
If you would take me with you to on your trip to the moon

Disfigured faces in technicolor,
Like roses on the deathbed of your dying mother
As the seasons grow into the angriest people,
Sadistic and slightly deranged
Everyone has changed, slighty deranged

From the rolling hills of suicide, everyone will run and hide
Screaming bloody murder with their heads on fire
There just may be a chance for me, my sweet insanity
If you would take me with you on your trip to the moon

Oh your wicked smile, oh your evil ways
Won't convince me the sky isn't falling down

My sweet insanity, look what we've become the envy of everyone

Inspired by your madness, like furious wind in a storm
Slowly growing cold I'm falling in love with you

From the rolling hills of suicide everyone will run and hide
Screaming bloody murder with their heads on fire
There just may be a chance for me, my sweet insanity
If you would take me with you on your trip to the moon
