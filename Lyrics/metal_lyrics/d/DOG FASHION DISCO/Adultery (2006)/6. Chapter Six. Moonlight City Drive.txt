Moonlight city drive - no one here gets out alive
Moonlight city drive - so sit back and enjoy the ride
Moonlight city drive - it'd take a miracle to survive
Moonlight city drive - sit back and enjoy the ride
No one here gets out alive

The druggies, the hookers, the pimps and the pushers
The faggots, the addicts and me
The neon lights, the murderous nights, the zombies walking the streets

What's a little sin under the covers, what's a little blood between the lovers?
What's a little death to be discovered, cold stiff body under the covers?

All work makes a dull man
All work makes a dull man

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Some famous Hollywood star

Mistress of the night come take a ride in my car

The pleasure, the pain, the needle, the vein hitting targets of delicate skin
Legs spread like disease, bullets buzzing like bees
Down and out doing you in

What's a little sin under the covers, what's a little blood between the lovers?
What's a little death to be discovered, cold stiff body under the covers?

All work makes a dull man
All work makes a dull man

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Some famous Hollywood star

Mistress of the night come take a ride in my car

Moonlight city drive - no one here gets out alive
Moonlight city drive - so sit back and enjoy the ride
Moonlight city drive - it'd take a miracle to survive
Moonlight city drive - so sit back and enjoy your ride

I know you feel me watching you.
I know you feel me wanting you.
I know you feel me hating you.
Now I'm going to kill you.

Checking in a cheap motel, entering the room.
Pills swimming in wine.
Hands around your neck.
Now I'm killing you
Now I'm killing you
Now I'm killing you
Now I'm killing you

Cold stiff body under the covers
Moonlight city drive
Cold stiff body under the covers
Moonlight city drive
Cold stiff body under the covers
Moonlight city drive
Cold stiff body under the covers
Moonlight city drive
Cold stiff body under the covers
Moonlight city drive
Cold stiff body under the covers
Moonlight city drive
