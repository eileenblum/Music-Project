Flesh coloured lips sipping from wasted veins,
Black clouds and stigmata appering again
Imprisoned in cold asylums, handshakes are exchanged
Magnetic rays electric light quickly glowing dim

These are the darkest days,
These are the darkest days of all
And it comes as no surprise all hope will someday die
Lost in a slow kiss goodbye all hope will someday die
As we sink like stones in the river

Terrified children chased through deserted streets
By maniacal madmen grinning with cannibal teeth

Turn your ugly head to me vampire and diety
Bite the neck that feeds you what the heart bleeds

These are the darkest days,
These are the darkest days of all
And it comes as no surprise all hope will someday die
Lost in a slow kiss goodbye all hope will someday die
As we sink like stones

So long so far gone my wild eyed child
It's been so long and you're so far gone
Someday I'll find you when I die
I see you floating away from me
You remind me of the flowers on your grave
Malignant villain you fooled the world again
These voices in my head are begging me to let you in
