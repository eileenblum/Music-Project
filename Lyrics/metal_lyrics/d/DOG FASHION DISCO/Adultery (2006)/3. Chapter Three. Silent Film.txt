Purr pussycat you have so many lives to live
Claws out, dig deep and scratch away the skin
You know you own the night so go howl under the full moon
These streets are filled with killers and comic book goons

This is your life flashing before your eyes
All the riddles and rhymes echo in your mind
It looks as though the joke is on you

Circling spirits loom above the autopsies
Sinners and saints fail to communicate
Unforgiving eyes confessions caught on tape
Wish me luck I'm going in never to return

This is your life, flashing before your eyes
All the riddles and rhymes echo in your mind
It looks as though the joke is on you
As your blood runs cold and the plot thickens
Inside the mind of a killer this could all be yours

Blood tests and x-rays are clear,
Your results came back terminal
Nothing is saving you now at your deathbed confessional
Nurses with baby doll eyes, dont bother to fake a smile
Voices of victims left dead, echo like hospital halls

As you wipe your tears away and the credits begin to roll

You will never be the same, dead silence in your brain
Climactic and so cliche, like love scenes in the rain

Silent film reel, horror pig squels, a child's nightmare-help me
Meeting deadlines, making headlines, and if you,
Are a good girl I will set you free
I'm just kidding, none of it's true, none of it's true

From this lonely padded cell, to the crowded gates of hell
