Headlights stab into the night sky.
Hands gripping tight to the wheel knuckles white
Approaching a figure in the headlights
Where are you headed get in we'll be on our way

I'll engage the conversation like I care,
To set your fragile mind at ease
Then tune you out like the radio,
Songs fading in and out hissing dead melodies

Hitchhiker roadside execution

Midnight stranger, come and take a ride with me in all my misery
I would love some company
This long and winding road isn't safe for anyone,
Now focus all your fear on the barrel of my gun

We are now experiencing technical difficulties

Calm down close your eyes it was all a bad dream
Now go back to sleep

Standing over your dead body smiling at you staring at you

Midnight stranger, come and take a ride with me in all my misery
I would love some company
This long and winding road isn't safe for anyone,
Now focus all your fear on the barrel of my gun

Midnight stranger nothing
Can save you now, beneath the pale starlight
I'll take you out of this world,
Lone hitchhiker I'll paint the highway with your blood,
In the morning light no one will recognize you
