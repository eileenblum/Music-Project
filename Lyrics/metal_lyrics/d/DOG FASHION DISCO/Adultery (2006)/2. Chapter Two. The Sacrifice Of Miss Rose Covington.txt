If you could wash away all the sins you've made to this day
The last rites could be given to you
Because no one is innocent and no one will be spared
Smile at the beauty of your poisonous possession as you're

Burning alive and hanging from the cross, so high
You look so pretty now
The sacrifice for all humanity
Smoke and ash I'm choking on you

Levitate and reach for me, restless spirit hovering
Smoldering burnt offerings of you
Because no one is innocent and no one will be spared
Smile at the beaty of your poisonous possession as you're

Burning alive and hanging from the cross, so high
You look so pretty now, the sacrifice for all humanity
Smoke and ash I'm choking on you
The power of christ compels you, demons be driven

This is the age of the golden dawn and the rising bloody tide
Soulless pitch black witness the return of the living dead
Oceans of blood all at once boil over and carry the bodies away
Mass confusion into submission the end of the world is today

Behind the black veil is the pale widow casting shadows on
The only one she's ever loved
Armies of unholy ghosts march in morbid rhythm chanting mantras
Of the dead under a bloody moon

Oceans of blood all at once boil over and carry the bodies away
Mass confusion into submission the end of the world is today as your

Burning alive and hanging from the cross, so high you look so pretty now
The sacrifice for all humanity, smoke and ash I'm choking on you

The power of christ compels you, demons be driven
