Show me yours and I'll show you mine dial tone ringin
Connect and on I'm on the hotline and talkin now so shut your mouth
I know just what I want, and that someone's you
Paint brush strokin in the sinful art of lust the picture becomes clear
No time to think twice no time for regret and one thing's for sure
This one's for me

I'm falling in love with the thrill of the kill and at this
Masquerade you're the clown and criminal
I will be the devil in your land of make believe
Tell my how the view is down there on your knees
As you beg and plead knee dep in the hot wax all stuck in the quicksand
Sexual slave you've learned your lessons well don't pause for applause my
Bloody valentine with a slip of en tounge
I'm on the inside snap the neck of self control and it breaks like prison bread straightjacket
Seduction whispers like the voice in your ear

You opened up the flood gates and I'm drowning in your love
Too late to turn back

Adultery

I have become a danger to myself a danger to myself
Now that I'm in the palm of your hand I have betrayed my family
Commited in sin adultery
And I can't stop now
