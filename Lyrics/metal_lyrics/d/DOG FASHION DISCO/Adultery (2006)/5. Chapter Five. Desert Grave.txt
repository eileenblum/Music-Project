I'm diggin you a desert grave underneath the burning sun
I'm diggin you a desert grave you won't be found by anyone

Burying the sins of man in an eternal tomb of sand
Vultures circle int he sky and you my dear are the reason why

You fought so hard to get away from the tight grip of death
You tried so hard to run away until your last dying breath

Burying the sins of man in an eternal tomb of sand
Vultures circle in the sky and you my dear are the reason why

Go kiss the daylight goodbye, as the sun lays down to die
And comes to end another day, as night falls on your desert grave
