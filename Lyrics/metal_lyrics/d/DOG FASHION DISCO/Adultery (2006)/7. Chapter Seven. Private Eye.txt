I'm the private eye,
Hot on your trail
The top gun for hire

You'll find me lurking in the shadows,
Always searching for a clue
I'm the bulletproof detective
I got my eye on you

[Spoken:]
Snapshot of the parking lot, man and woman embrace
Partners in crime ignite the infidelity into these crimes of passion.
Betrayal? Â I see it every day,Â 
Like my own reflection in the mirror staring back at me.
Another case, another bottle of booze, life is no longer a mystery to me.

'Cause I'm the private eye,
Hot on your trail,
The top gun for hireÂ 

You'll find me lurking in the shadows,
Always searching for a clue
I'm the bulletproof detective,
I got my eye on you

[Spoken:]
11:18 PM, subject is checking into the Desert Palms motel,
Accompanied by unknown female.

[Spoken dialogue:]
So, what turns you on?
* Pretend you're dead, that'll turn me on.
You're a sick little fuck, aren't you?
* I just get what I want. Even if it's by force.
You don't have to rape the willing. You got anything to drink around here?
* I'm not paying you to sit around and drink.
Well then shut up, I'll punch the clock, and you can fuck me 'til the blood scares you.
* Oh, yeah
Fuck.
* Take it all, whore. Dirty little bitch. Good little girl. Say goodnight, bitch!

Meow.
