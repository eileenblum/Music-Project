Satanic cowboy
demonic hillbilly
possesses country folk to nashville sothern rockabilly
my man's got problems
he ain't raped to tight
i've seem him troting around on his headless horse at night
he's known to hit the scene
he poses in the nude
he started his own cult of redneck biker dudes
known irrevently to some
as the overlords anxiety
claims they are a reflection of whats wrong with society
shits going down so get the fuck out of town
shits going down so get the fuck underground
the root of all evil is the smile of a demon
an inebriated slob on gin and tonic blood and semen
he'll spawn his seed until this town becomes a petting zoo
hearing voices in his head
singing rock n' rolls the devils tool
rock n' rolls the devil's tool
that's what they always told you
now he reaps the benefits of records that they sold you
we must confront the incubus
and see that he dies
so the towns people gathered and they planned his demise
shits going down so get the fuck out of town
shits going down so get the fuck underground
it's all in your head
there's no such thing as evil
it's just a complex personality
there was a little boy
whose daddy drank too much
and then he beat him up i said he beat him up
there was a little boy
whose daddy drank too much
and now he's all grown up
i said he's all grown up
