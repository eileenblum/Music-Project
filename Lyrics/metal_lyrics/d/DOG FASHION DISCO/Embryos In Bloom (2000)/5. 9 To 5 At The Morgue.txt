Within the pale white walls
from 9 to 5 day after day i feel no more alive
that the stiff that lies the table before me
wake up to early to twist the key
stumble on over to the mr. coffee
pour myself a warm black existence
within the pale white walls
from 9 to 5 day after day i feel so cold inside
like the stiff that lies the table before me
wake up to early to twist the key
stumble on over to the mr. coffee
pour myself a warm black existence
9 to 5 at the morgue
overtime for the corpse
hypnotized by the hum of the freezer
hypnotized by the look in your eyes
hypnotized by the pallid cadaver
hypnotized by the look in your eyes
the truth is harsher than you think
it's the hair that fills the sink
or the wrinkles around your eyes
until you're old and hypnotized
9 to 5
die and die
die and draw flies
this day is never going to end for me
the end is closer that you think
so pour yourself another drink
and don't let it get to you
cause that's exactly what it will do
9 to 5
die and die
die and draw flies
stitch his lips
and shut his eyes
9 to 5 at the morgue
