Candy box bugle congregate and point
another star is born he's the boy that shakes the joint
chain link smokestack he breaths and turns out wheezes
invite him to a party and he glows like a plastic jesus
gliding down the gangway the alley rats are one
innocent as angels packing muzzle loaded guns
trigger happy soldier shoots up and down and misses
ignorance he speaks from the same place that he pisses
i saw that red blood flowing like a river
when i cocked the gun and pulled the trigger
i saw that red blood flowing like a river
and i'll do it again
murder the former so faded you blend
send my regards to his family and friends
surpassing all predictability
can't you see that it's just killing me
