Hirudinoids
emotionless and feeding
threatened by anemia
i am helpless and bleeding
suspended in air
caught in another toothless dream
when pagans sleep
and atheists slumber
evangelists and bishops come to comfort one another
silent in prayer
caught in another toothless dream
possesion by twilight haunts me continuously
exercised upon my jaw
there in the garden
the serpent sings a lullaby
that summons the undead from the ground
as vampires and zombies
begin cicling around me
in the year of our lord continuum
possession by twilight haunts me continuously
exorcised upon my gums
possession by twilight haunts me continuously
time continuum
