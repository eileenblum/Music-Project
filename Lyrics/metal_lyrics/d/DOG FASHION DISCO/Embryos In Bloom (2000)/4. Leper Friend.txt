Pretty faces pretty hip
bodies hang to drain and drip
so submit and let's pretend
you're not a hollow charlatan
velcro whores they fill the streets
infecting everyone they meet
the hourglass is karmas curse
each grain of sand is a universe
laser beams and cattle prods
sacrifices for the gods
divinities orgasmic hymns
will fuck you with prosthetic limbs
as ulcerations form they know
they soon will lose fingers and toes
swollen ends and bloody gauze
curse us all
i've watched you suffer
for so long it seems
and somehow i look the other way
i've watched you fall apart
like my leper friend
and somehow i look the other way
an outcast deprived of festal joy
prostration
it seems is here to stay
my limbless friend will die alone
a torso of flesh upon the throne
the cure for clinical depression is a lobotomy
