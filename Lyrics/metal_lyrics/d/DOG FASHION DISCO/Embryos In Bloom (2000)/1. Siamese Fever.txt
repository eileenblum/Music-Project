Once upon a time
an exordium
asceticism formed to haunt human beings
a flux from the bowels
flushes pangs away
to escape from thought
i'll swallow my tongue
hebephrenia hypochondria
personalities multiplied by space
paranoia and schizophrenia
stemming from the constriction in my throat
satan loves you so does jesus christ
count your blessings
one head at a time
they wont respect you in the morning
i feel the same
once upon a time
in a siamese twin anger
formed a threat to his duplicate
rising mercury
mocking mimicry
unanimity can and will not be
scissor homicide
would be suicide
fever in disguise
temperatures will rise
paranoia and schizophrenia
beginning with an incision in the skin
separation
