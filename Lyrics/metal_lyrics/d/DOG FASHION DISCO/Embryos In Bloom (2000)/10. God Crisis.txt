Would you like to be divine?
a healing hand upon your cheek
if you would like to be saved
then just say so
its a long road from first density
walk patient and most pensively
you are well upon your way i said you are well upon your way
the embryo's in bloom
from the tunnel's warm light
a sunset armageddon sky orange flames of fire night
we'll enlighten you
would you like to be divine?
a healing hand upon your cheek
if you wanted to be saved
you should have said so
its a long road first density
walk patient and most pensively
you are well upon your way
i said you are well upon your way
we'll enlighten you
death brings rebirth
soon you will bloom
waiting my turn again
the swine became a buzzard
who then turned to a goat
whose sacrificial blood
fed the worms
who emerged and took the oath
animism i believe just as the shaman does
the doctrines of souls
are key principles of life and death
in that i am saved
in that i am tempted
in that salvation is pure and true
fertile eggs incubate in callow innocence
calm and tranquil days had passed
and once at last the storms had stirred the winds
the embryo's in bloom
from the tunnel's warm light
a sunset armageddon sky orange flames of fire night
we'll enlighten you
would you like to be divine?
a healing hand upon your cheek
if you wanted to be saved
you should have said so
its a long road first density
walk patient and most pensively
you are well upon your way
i said you are well upon your way
we'll enlighten you
death brings rebirth
soon you will bloom
waiting my turn again
