late night at penn state, we exit from the bar
stagger up the stairs, and wish we had a car
cause it's a long walk home and pretty fucking cold
we chat with skins we meet, about the days of old
and bands from skating days, gbh and tedencies
black flag and kennedeys, and everything inbetween
into a crash course of just skins enjoy,
they hollered loud and proud
oi! oi! oi! oi!
so raise your fist in skin head bliss
so raise your fist to a way of life
we start our voyage home out in the bitter cold
and in a drunken state we travel up the road
slowly step by step we drag our drunken guide
up pulls the rhino yelling, "hey would you like a ride?"
oi! oi! to the albino rhino
oi! oi! friends we made
oi! oi! to the albino rhino
so raise your fists like this
in joyous skinhead bliss
so raise your fists like this
raise your fist now just like this
we reached our place at last and chattered over beers
and listened to stories of a skinhead pioneer
then said good bye and it was nearly dawn
i thanked them for the rideand they traveled on
if you're ever at penn state and exit from a bar
and stagger up the stairs and wish you had a car
and walking in the cold is what you don't enjoy
look for the rhino van and holler oi! oi! oi!
