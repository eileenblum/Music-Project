evolutions been kind to you
your indeed a bright baboon
howl, moan, and forage for food
under a blood red moon
convulse and spit upon the floor
just swallow that key and close the door
and no one will harm you anymore
you know how much i'd hate to kill you
so has life been kind to you
or do you feel a bit subdued
is your mind for once at ease
are you everything you hoped to be
convulse and spit upon the floor
just swallow that key and close the door
shut up, shut updon't make a sound
we don't wantto have to put you in the ground
CANNIBALS AND CARNIVORES
i'll hang these antlers proudly
my freezer's full of meat
i've down right stumbled on to
the deal of the century
crack a tin of wheat and barley
and now my stomachs full
plenty of porno to cock and bull
mother nature bends you over
then it's over, yes it's over
walking upright with composure
mother nature bends you over
i hold my head up high
from a reclined position
absorb magnetic waves
from a big screen television
feed my x-rated eyes with sweet perverted play
i'm simply passing time all night and everyday
mother nature bends you over
then it's over, yes it's over
walking upright with composure
mother nature bends you over
flooded town will keep you sober
as mother nature bends you over
a cataclysm overturning
resume position, now you're learning
evolutions been kind to you
you're at home in a warm cocoon
submissive and immune
under a blood red moon
convulse and spit upon the floor
just swallow that key and close the door
and no one will harm you anymore
you know how much i'd hate to kill you
