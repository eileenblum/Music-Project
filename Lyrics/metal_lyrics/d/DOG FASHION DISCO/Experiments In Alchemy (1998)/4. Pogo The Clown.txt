pogo happy clown molester
paints his face to disguise his jester
joined the local moose lodge chapter
spawning evil ever after
he picks his prey up at the bar
gets him drunk and in the car
drives him home and down the stairs
strips him to his underwear
pogo you're gonna' burn in hell
mudrer victim, slice and smile
serial killer pedophile
look in to those empty eyes
you know it's your time to die
as he cuts you up in little bits
cuts you up in little bits
bop, bop on your head again
spills your blood and now he's soaked in sin
pogo you're gonna' burn in hell
drives all night through the city streets
to hack up his victims like a piece of meat
i spoke to the devil the other day
and john is doing fine
the end is true
when the sun goes down on the city streets
pogo's coming after you

track #5: "En La Noche'"
en la noche yo puedo vertus osos
en la noche moonlight and stars in your eyes
en la noche moonlight and stars reflect a spectrum of love
i'll thank you, and you will smile
i'll thank you, and you will smile
and we'll embrace, and we will dance
and we'll embrace into the night
