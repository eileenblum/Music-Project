beyond my self i percieve my own ability
and through these wormholes i search
inside and out of me
i'm not exactly what i'd like to be
so i suffocate my siddhis
gain momentum once again
tell myself don't ever let them
drag you down
i'll take the pain
and wish you all away
i'll take the blame
and wish you all away
