Born in a cartoon of malicious riddles.
Castrated at the thought of moving pictures.
Mutating colours in the 3rd dimension.

Technicolor and amphetamines in another crime scene.

The lord of illustrated disenchantment,
He sleeps to dream up a conspiracy,
With many sugar coated alibis.

Technicolor and amphetamines in another crime scene.

We are anarchists of good taste.
We are terrorists of untruths.

Cartoon autopsy.
Animated effigy.
