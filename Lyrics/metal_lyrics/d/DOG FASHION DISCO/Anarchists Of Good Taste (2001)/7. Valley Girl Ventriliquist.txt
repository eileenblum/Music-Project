Hermaphrodites with x-ray eyes,
Shapeshift into paradigms.
March like nazi's to a polka dirge,
To conjure the spirit of lucifer.
Virgin mongoloid.
Girlfriend mentally begins to bend.

Valley girl ventriloquists.
Move her lips and slash her wrists.

Ammonia sweet river,
Winged rats will take us there,
Anchored by the ledfish.
We are pregnant with animal joy.

Don't fall asleep or we'll mutilate your genitals.

A demon of a wet dream baptized in chlorine,
To a giesha with a syphilis smile
In a hollywood babylon.

Follow me to Shangri-La.
On the comet Hale-Bopp.
