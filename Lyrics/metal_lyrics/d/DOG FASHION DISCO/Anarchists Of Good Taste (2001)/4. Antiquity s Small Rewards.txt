Well the sky is black,
And everyone's on fire.
Neon lights and shallow graves,
Are all I see for miles.

Waiting in utopia,
To liberate the living dead.
Palm trees and antiquity.
Kool-aid and strychnine.

Well the clock is dead,
And everyone's on fire.
Neon lights and shallow graves,
Are all I see for miles.

Waiting in utopia,
To liberate the living dead.
Palm trees and antiquity.
Kool-aid and strychnine.

Sing with me in harmony
In evidence of your liturgy.
I am your god and I've never been so in love.
So spread your legs,
Close your eyes
And say a prayer for me.
Blow a kiss and make a wish.
You're going to heaven.
We're a happy family
And we belong together.
