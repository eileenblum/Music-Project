You are a worm in a dog's heart,
A newborn mongoloid child,
Operating at great speeds,
Covered in vaseline and immaculate skin,
...and immaculate skin

Pathetic little sheep children following the herd,
Guided by the voices in their empty little heads,

You are a milky tear in a dead mans eye,
In disguise an insect martyr,
Under pink light incubation and postcard amnesia,
And fantastic pigmentation,

Pathetic little sheep children following the herd,
Guided by the voices in their empty little heads,
You are a worm in a dog's heart.
