Iâll play the game, in hopes to end this charade,
Youâve got me caught, and tangled up in your web,
DÃ©jÃ  vu, this sceneâs already played through,
A crime scene, the chalk line is drawn around you,

The price of fame, you know could never be paid,
Sleeping pills, an empty bottle of wine,
DÃ©jÃ  vu, this sceneâs already played through,
Your death, Iâve seen it all in a dream,

Haunting familiar dÃ©jÃ  vu,
I know your end is coming soon,
I can't help but think one day theyâll find you,
Sleeping forever ever gone,

Haunting familiar dÃ©jÃ  vu,
I know your end is coming soon,
Theyâll picture your face while dancing on your grave,
Sleeping forever ever gone.
