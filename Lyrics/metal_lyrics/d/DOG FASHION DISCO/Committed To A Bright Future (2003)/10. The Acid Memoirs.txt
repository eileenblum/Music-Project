In my youth I took a trip,
My first initial acid trip,
And then it hit me like a ton of bricks,
My eyes they quickly dilated,
I began hallucinating at the tender age of seventeen,

As I watched the TV my dogs speaking to me,
Telling me I'm going insane,

I recall a scene it's Halloween,
And I am dressed as a drag queen,
Peaking to the point of no return,
I met a man, I shook his hand,
He spoke I could not understand,
He was covered in flies and afterbirth,

The mandrills were singing,
The bees they were stinging,
As pink flamingos laid dead on the ground,

I am the witness, I am Mohammed, I am the elephant man,
These are strange days beautifully chaotic,
In a burning metropolis,

Tuning in and dropping out,
Dancing Buddha's twist and shout,
Buddhatomic Christ is love,
Who resurrects the flower head,
Cherishing the subtleties,
Illusion is reality,
Swimming the electric ocean,
Souls at rest were set in motion,

Martian perform autopsies,
On cattle anal cavities,
Frontal lobe lobotomies,
Electric shocking chimpanzees,
This cause of sorrow is desire,
Ego fuels the selfish fire,
Illusion is reality,
Quantum synchronicity,

Mandrills were singing,
The bees they were stinging,
As pink flamingos laid dead on the ground,
Visions so clearly of Timothy Leary,
The godfather of the movement.
