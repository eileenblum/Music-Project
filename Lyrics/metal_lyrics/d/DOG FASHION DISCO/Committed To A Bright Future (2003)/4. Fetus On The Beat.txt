Fetus on the beat
Red as can be
Rhythmically miscarried
Flushed out into the sea

Funded resurrections
From the local town collections
Sugary sweet secreting glands
Flood the milk and honey lands
Umbilical nooses hang our hest
On every note and every rest

Fetus on the beat
High on LSD
Enter World War Three
While in infancy

Funded resurrections
From the local town collections
Sugary sweet secreting glands
Flood the milk and honey lands
Umbilical nooses hang our hest
On every note and every rest

Conductor of the flies
Piss drunk and in disguise
You keep us all in time
To orchestrate a lie

You keep it on the beat
You keep it on the beat
You keep it on the beat
You keep it on the beat

Abort the beat
Abort the beat
Abort the beat
Abort the beat

Sadists and masochists
Who penetrate the melody
Into a spiral frenzy
They will rape you in a minor key

What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?

Unborn vertebrate
Withers and decays
A cappella fear
Is music to my ears

Funded resurrections
From the local town collections
Sugary sweet secreting glands
Flood the milk and honey lands
Umbilical nooses hang our hest
On every note and every rest

Conductor of the flies
Piss drunk and in disguise
You keep us all in time
To orchestrate a lie

You keep it on the beat
You keep it on the beat
You keep it on the beat
You keep it on the beat

Sadists and masochists
Who penetrate the melody
Into a spiral frenzy
They will rape you in a minor key

What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
What more do you want from me?
