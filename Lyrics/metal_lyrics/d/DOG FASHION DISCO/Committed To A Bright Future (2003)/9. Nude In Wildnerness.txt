If I was the son of god I'd live alone nude in the wilderness,
The animals would speak to me and approach me without hesitation,
The birds would sing to scarecrows in circadian rhythm,
Inside the garden of desperation a voice could be heard,

And all the plastic politician devils cry,
As all the skyscrapers come crashing to the ground,
Whatever happened to a quiet simple life,
Innocence is lost as we near our final day,

Deep in the forest the apparitions are all in attendance,
Phantoms and specters converge in silence under the moonlight,
Behind this illusion is a union of the anthropism,
Inside the garden of desperation a voice can be heard,

Falling bombs on Babylon,
What a perfect ending to it all.
