Little green men follow us from town to town,
Speaking in riddles of digital sound,
Hiding in the shadow of a subway train,
Trying to get to heaven with a worm in his brain,

Where is the hurdy-gurdy man going now,
Playing such apocalyptic sounds, sounds, sounds,
We are the magical band of fools you know it ain't easy,

A horrific durge ringing in my ears,
It seems we've fooled ourselves baby for oh so many years,
Living in the trunk of a hollow tree,
Trying to get to heaven with a fatal disease,

Where is the hurdy-gurdy man going now,
Playing such apocalyptic sounds, sounds, sounds,
We are the magical band of fools you know it ain't easy,

Bloodletting, hypnotists,
Repeat after me, only fools believe they won't get fooled again,
Vampires, organ grinders,
In my youth I was bitten by a girl with a rabbit's tooth,
Oh what's a fool to do.
