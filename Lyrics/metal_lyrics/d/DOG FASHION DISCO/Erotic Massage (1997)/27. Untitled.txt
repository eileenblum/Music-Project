[Hidden Track]

Don't do me no favors
Don't give me no jive
Don't do me no favors, girl
I ain't got the time
An unkind woman
Went and stole my heart
So many times before
They tried to tear us apart
Lady, lady
Where have you gone now?
Cause I've been searchin'
All around the town

So many times
I have tried to love you
So many times
I've been thinkin' of you

When we were together
It felt so right
But now I'm facin'
Another lonely night
But you know, lady
It was over at the start
But now I'm searching
For the way to your heart
Don't do me no favors
Don't give me no jive
Don't do me no favors, girl
I ain't got the time

So many times
I have tried to love you
So many times
I've been thinkin' of you
[Repeat until fade]
