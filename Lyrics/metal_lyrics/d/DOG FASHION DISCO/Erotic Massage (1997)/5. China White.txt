Young and confused
Socially abused
Can't find liberation
Fucked up in a hole

Take my life
Hold me 'till I die

Force feeding me
Umbilical delinquency
Shoot me in my brain
Fuck me in my brain

'Till the feeling's gone
Then just turn and run
Experiment addiction
Dependency is form

Take my life
Hold me 'till I die
[x5]
