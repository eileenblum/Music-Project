Candy box bugle, congregate and point
Another star is born; he's the boy that shakes the joint
Chain link, smokestack, he breaths and turns out wheezes
Invite him to a party and he glows like a plastic Jesus

Gliding down the gangway, the alley rats are one
Innocent as angels packing muzzle loaded guns
Trigger happy soldier boy shoots up and down and misses
Ignorance, he speaks from the same place that he pisses

I saw that red blood flowing like a river
When I cocked the gun and pulled the trigger
I saw that red blood flowing like a river
And I'll do it again, again, again

I saw that red blood flowing like a river
I saw that red blood flowing like a river
Again, again, again

Murder the former, so faded you blend
Send my regards to his family and friends
Surpassing all predictability
Can't they see that it's just killing me?

I saw that red blood flowing like a river
When I cocked the gun and pulled the trigger
I saw that red blood flowing like a river
And I'll do it again, again, again

I saw that red blood flowing like a river
I saw that red blood flowing like a river
Again, again
