I want to go out and get real high
So I can laugh a lot
And sing a lot
So don't ask why

I want to go out
So far away
Away from you
Where I can laugh a lot
And sing about a love that's true

I want to go out
And get real high
So I can laugh a lot
And sing a lot
So don't ask why

I want to go out
So far away
Away from you
Where I can laugh a lot
And sing about a love that's true

I want to go somewhere I can hide
Where I can laugh a lot
A sing about a girl who lied

I want to go out and find a love
A love that's true
So I can laugh a lot
And sing about me killing you

Me killing you [x8]
