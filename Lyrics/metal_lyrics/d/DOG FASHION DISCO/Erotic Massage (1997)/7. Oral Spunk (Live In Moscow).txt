Can't you see eventually
All I really want to be
Is preferred by the self
[x2]

My whole world [x2]
My world, it crumbles
At the thought of you

I watch my time stand still
In my world
It's where I want to be

In my world
I watch my time stand still
In my world
It's where I want to be
This oral spunk

Can't you see eventually
All I really want to be
Is preferred by the self
[x2]

My whole world [x2]
My world, it crumbles
At the thought of you

I watch my time stand still
In my world
It's where I want to be

In my world
I watch my time stand still
In my world
It's where I want to be

I don't want to be
Down, down, down
I just want to be part of you

I am not afraid
You don't understand me
[x2]

I am oral
'Till you bring me down

I am not afraid
You don't understand me
[x2]

I am oral 'till you oral spunk
