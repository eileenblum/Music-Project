Where I go no one wants to say
I will bleed and tonight I fall
I won't bleed, oh no, once you say
I won't bleed, 'cause tonight I fall
[x2]

So I spoke to the blind one
Said "Leave my world alone"
So I spoke to the blind one
And I will stay away
[x2]

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Towards my passage
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Where I go no one wants to say
I will bleed and tonight I fall
I won't bleed, oh no, once you say
I won't bleed, 'cause tonight I fall

So I spoke to the blind one
Said leave my world alone
So I spoke to the blind one
And I will stay away [x2]

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Towards my passage
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Burnt out on swinging hammers

Lost it all and I'm never gonna find you
Plan all in what I say
I'm gone and I'm never gonna find you [x3]
Plan all in what I say

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Towards my passage
Yeah, yeah, yeah

They don't want you
No one wants you
[x4]
