She came from the wrong side of town
She crossed the tracks and then she turned around

Alone and restless, left without a choice
She sought the comfort in a friendly voice

To survive she sold herself away
Every night and almost every day

Alone and restless, left without a choice
She sought the comfort in a friendly voice

I said wait, I said wait, said, give love a chance
The morning when you wake up
The sun will dance

She nearly lost herself along the way
So full of anger in a world of pain
She'd walk the streets at night all alone
No one to turn to, no place called home

Our worlds collided one summer day
I gave her hope and a place to stay

Alone and restless, left without a choice
She found the comfort in a friendly voice

I said wait, I said wait, said give love a chance
The morning when you wake up
The sun will dance

I said wait, I said wait, said give love a chance
The morning when you wake up
The sun will dance

I said wait, oh, and I'll return [x2]

I said wait, oh, and I'll return [x4]

She came from the wrong side of town
And through the pain she turned her eyes around

When everyone seemed to pull her down
She caught herself before she hit the ground

Now so alive she once was dead
She gathered strength and walked the road ahead

Alone and restless, left without a choice
She found the comfort in a friendly voice

I said wait, I said wait, said give love a chance
The morning when you wake up
You'll find your romance

I said wait, I said wait, said give love a chance
The morning when you wake up
The sun will dance
