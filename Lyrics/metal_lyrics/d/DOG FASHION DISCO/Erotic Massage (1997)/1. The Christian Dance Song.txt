They say "sit up, sit down" and I listen
Obey the rules cause I'm a Christian
I am exactly what you want me to be
And this world inside of me, yeah
Is larger than infinity
Pathetic and so untrue

Nail me up again
Under the desert sun

"Just say the word and you're forgiven
And have no fear 'cause he has risen"
Before you realize the rapture ensues
And this world outside of me, yeah

Becomes a fading memory
Rejoice just as the choir sings

Nail me up again
Under the desert sun

And it only makes you stronger
When they're fucking with your head
And it only makes you stronger
Forgiveness
It helps me clear my (head)

Some say the anti-Christ is among us
Quite possibly he is anyone of us
Before you realize the rapture ensues
And this world in front of me, yeah

Becomes a fading memory
Rejoice just as the choir sings
Rejoice now

Nail me up again
Under the desert sun

And it only makes you stronger
When they're fucking with your head [x2]
And it only makes you stronger
Forgiveness
It helps to clear your

Rejoice and sing
And praise the Lord
Repent your sins
Brings great rewards

And it only makes you stronger
When they're fucking with your head
And it only makes you stronger
Forgiveness
It helps me clear my head [x2]
