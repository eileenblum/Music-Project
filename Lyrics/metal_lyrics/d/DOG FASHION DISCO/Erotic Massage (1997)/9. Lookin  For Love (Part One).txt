I, I got a feeling
Deeper emotion
I ain't the only one
Soak up the pain
Until it's gone

Time where have you gone
Precious the moments
Sweet are the sounds
Soak up the pain
Until it's gone

Time where have you gone now
Seems just like yesterday
Caught up with you
Up with you

Some predict my heartache
Songs of love gone wrong
In the end it seems tragic
But so appropriate, indeed
But nevertheless
The end is fate

Barely alive
Afraid of feelin'
Pick me a partner
Find someone else to blame
Wallow with pain
Until it's gone

Time where have you gone now
Seems just like yesterday
Caught up with you
Up with you
