So you say you want to kick my ass
Up and down this block
And I say, "Oh no, no"
So you say you want to beat my face
Into a bloody pulp
And I say, "Oh no, no"

Turn your back and he'll blow you away
Don't turn away

So you say you want to slit my wrists
You want to break my legs
And I say, "Oh no, no"
So you say you want to gouge my eyes
You want to slit my throat
And I say, "Oh no, no"

Feelin' happy on a beautiful day
You step away

So you say you want to snap my neck
You want to break my nose
And I say, "Oh no, no"

Feelin' happy on a beautiful day
(Beautiful day)
Turn your back and he'll blow you away
(Blow you away)
Feelin' happy on a beautiful day
(Beautiful day)
Turn your back and he'll blow you away
(Blow you away)
