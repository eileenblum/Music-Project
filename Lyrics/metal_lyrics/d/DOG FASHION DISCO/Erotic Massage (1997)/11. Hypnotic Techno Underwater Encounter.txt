Waste away the moments
Till they're gone

Iâve never known why I'm followed
But now itâs making sense

Speak in silence

Speak in silence
Iâm going under

Iâve never known why I'm followed
But now itâs making sense
Iâve never known the reasons why I am followed
But now itâs making sense

Speak in silence
My understanding of the
Words of silence
Iâm going under

Iâve never known why I'm followed
But now itâs making sense
Iâve never known the reasons why I'm followed
But now itâs making sense
