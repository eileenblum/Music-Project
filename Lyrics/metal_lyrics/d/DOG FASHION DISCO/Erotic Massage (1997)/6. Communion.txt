Yesterday everything was fine
I read another dead chapter in the book of life
And now my soul's saved,
Hallelujah!

The owls dance with the sÃ©ance in the sand
No need to see a physician because he's already dead
And now my soul's saved,
Hallelujah!

Because I lied to you
In a world that's so untrue

Yesterday I turned my blood into wine
And my crown of thorns has never felt so right
And now my soul's saved,
Hallelujah!

Another chance to forget myself
To follow the dead into the promised land
And now my soul's saved,
Hallelujah!

Because I lied to you
In a world that's so untrue

Yesterday everything was fine
I read another dead chapter in the book of life
And now my soul's saved,
Hallelujah!

Yesterday I turned my blood into wine
And my crown of thorns has never felt so right
And now my soul's saved,
Hallelujah!

Because I lied to you
In a world that's so untrue
