When you find yourself lit up in flames.
Break past the edge, and search for truth.
Find it within Yourself!

You feel it back inside your mind.
You see it right before your eyes.

(Let go of all your fears tonight,
close the door TO EVERY LIE.)

You feel it back inside your mind.
Just close your eyes this is the time.

Donât question what can, not be fixed.
Donât you ever shed tears for all the wrong senseless fears!

You feel it back inside your mind.
You see it right before your eyes.

(Let go of all your fears tonight,
close the door TO EVERY LIE.)

You feel it back inside your mind.
Just close your eyes this is the time.

(LET GO!)

Let go of all your fears tonight.
Keep them out, out of sight.

Let Go, of all your fears tonight
keep them out, out of sight.

LET GO! Of all your fears tonight!

Close your eyes!
And hold on tight! This is your
chance to break free from your life.

(BREAK FREE FROM YOUR LIFE!)
