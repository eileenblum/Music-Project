Through the forest
climbing trees
swinging vines
with the breeze.
Adventuring through a mystic forest.
I'm trying hard to hold on to, these vines of life that break through you.
The bliss of natures kiss saves me from my black abyss.
I taste the salt drip onto my lips,
missing the touch of your finger tips.
Pacing back to and fro I don't know where to go.
I'm so lost.
Fragile like paper, elastic as rubber,
my heart searches for another.

Oxygen in the air breathes into my soul.

Where they fall divides us all
Shows your scares and reads disgrace
This careless life
Everyday before this day you let the earth fade away.
Now with vines holding tight you finally see the light.
This care this care this care this careless
Life we life we life we life we live

Trying to hold on to these vines that
BREAK THROUGH YOU!
Tangled
Thorns piercing your heart.
The pain
Has just begun to start.
