In darkness you find me
Beneath the waves of lightning

Undying
Defying
Awakened
Rearising
Despite all your treasons
You won't take away me freedom

Go,
Take it away
Play the world and win the game
Beware the fangs on the underside

This is our time to take control
You'll never take my soul
Play the world, win the game
But beware of the fangs

Unrest my lungs
Sweet dreams of nocturne now

Go,
Take it away
Play the world and win the game
This is our time
So live it well
You'll never take my soul
Put me in your hell
Yes, you move on and fight ahead
For all that is good and never dead
You'll never take my soul
