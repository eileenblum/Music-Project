Ripping away from worthlessness
Coming alive with power
Take command and blast your way
They rob your mind
And steal your soul

Get the hell out!
It's time for us to take command
Kicking down hard!
Chain in hand I want command
I'm sick of your rules!
Time for us to take command
Metal at hand
The power we have
To take command

Keep your freedom tonight
Take command and stand up high
Raise the metal flag! March forth!
Show those muthas you control

Get the hell out!
It's time for us to take command
Kicking down hard!
Chain in hand I want command
I'm sick of your rules!
Time for us to take command
Metal at hand
The power we have
To take command

Take command!
Take command!
Take command!
Take command!

Metal and leather
Driving our own cause
Pounding and loud
Sweating thrash all night
Making it known
Yeah we're alive tonight
Ripping it out - showing our time
Has come c'mon - let's rip

Rise up high
Time to ride
Stand up tall
Never fall
Bound in chain
Side by side
Make a stand
Take command!

Take Command!
Take command!
Take command!
Take command!
Command!
