In blind fear we live with
The goverment's minds
Rule our lives
Strike and fight back
You know it's time
To bring it down
Bring down the hammers
We are the steel
And together we will pound
Bring down the hammers
Bring down the hammers

Together in leather
THe hammer is falling
They will die a tragic death
Strike and fight back
You know it's time
To bring down
Bring down the hammers
We are steel
And together we will pound
Bring down the hammers
Bring down the hammers

You fucked with us
Well look at you now
Your flesh is torn
And you live in your blood
You know it's time
To bring down
Bring down the hammers
We are steel
And together we will pound
Bring down the hammers
