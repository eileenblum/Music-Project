All alone going insane
Deep in pain
Fury building up in me
Forced to be a vigilante
Stalking the one
Who murdered my family

Court system fails again,
In this justice money rules
Wait this can't be,
The judge sets him free
Turn the tables of insanity,
A vigilante I must be
Instinct to avenge,
Controls me

Storm of steel
Storm of steel
Storm of steel!!!!

I'm living in Hell,
Cannot forgive
Drive for revenge,
Building up in me
Seems there's no alternative
Knowing how wrong it may be

Court system fails again,
In this justice money rules
Wait this can't be,
The judge sets him free
Turn the tables of insanity,
A vigilante I must be
Instinct to avenge,
Controls me

Storm of steel
Storm of steel
Storm of steel!!!!!!!
