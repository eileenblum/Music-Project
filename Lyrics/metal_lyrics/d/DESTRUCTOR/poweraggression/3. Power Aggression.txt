Power aggression
History's oldest game
Power obsession always is the same
Evil, hungry men make their own laws
As innocent people die for a foolish cause
Never ending cycle
Bloodshed the result
Never ending battles are to be fought
When will the world see with their minds?
Before the human race drifts off to die

Modern days
Nuclear weapons bring Armageddon closer to us

Power aggression
Doomsday approaches
Hand of the clock is the threat of destruction
Prophecy of the world's end
Paranoid losers ready at command
Infernal living hell awaits mankind
Who is to rule the wasteland left behind?

When will all the madness end??
The final day could be around the bend
Must hate and war continue??
When the world dies so will you!!
