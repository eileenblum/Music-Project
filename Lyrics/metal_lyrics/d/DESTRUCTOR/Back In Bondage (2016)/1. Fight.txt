I'm heading out to the front
With the sword of metal in my head
Yes I'm alive and I'm coming back
For a fight one more time

Been carving stone with my hands
And I'm here to take command

Goin' over the top now let it all out
True metal is my life, no doubt
You can't take what's mine away, oh no
And if you try you'll surely pay

I'll take you on any time
And I'm back to claim what's mine

I'm alive I'm alive
I'm alive ready to fight, just try me

Heartless souls think you control me
Heartless souls think you can own me, well

I'm alive, yes I feel it tonight
And I can't deny I wanna fight for metal tonight

Heartless souls think you control me
Heartless souls think you can own me, well

I'm alive, yes I feel it tonight
And I can't deny I wanna fight for metal tonight
