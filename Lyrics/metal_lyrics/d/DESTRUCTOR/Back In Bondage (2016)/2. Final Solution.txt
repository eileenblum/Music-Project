Hammering jack boots
Their mission of madness to amass without a fight
Victims of carnage the inferior rage
Hebrews and gypsies death is their fate
Helpless with fear the oppressed they blindly run
Like lambs at the slaughter their screams stiffled by guns

Death see it shine in their eyes
Propaganda heads full of lies
Kill all that is human pollution
Conquer to achieve the final solution

Branded and numbered beaten out of breath
Loaded on board moving out through the rain
Guttural orders carried out in gloom
By twisted minds nurturing their visions of doom
Smiling with evilness their power is so strong
They fire the ovens not seeing it's wrong

Death see it shine in their eyes
Propaganda heads full of lies
Kill all that is human pollution
Conquer to achieve the final solution

The final solution
The final solution
The final solution
The final solution
