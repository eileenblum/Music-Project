Go!
I'm here living free
Natural born killer on your T.V.
I'm a star, ha!

Trigger happy son of a bitch
Loose on the streets again
Confused to steel iron your brain feels
Stop this burning, torture and pain

Burning lead melts your head
Die, die, go down to your grave
Kiss the marble

Blasted motherfucker bloody thing
No longer are you a slave
Quench your thirst, come to me
And now drink of my hands

Burning lead melts your head
Die, die, go down to your grave

Creature of unhealthy childhood
Mutation of another bible school
How do we stop you?

Pull you out by the root
And chop you off at the neck
Make you bleed, make you bleed for me

N.B.K. natural born killer
N.B.K. natural born killers

We're here living free
Natural born killers on your T.V.
