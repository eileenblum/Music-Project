Entering the sargasso
The mysterious sea of fear
An unexplainable calm
Something is growing near
No breeze can drive our ship
The thick sea weed holds us still
Disappear into thin air
Not a trace left of a crew

A mystery surrounding the earth
We are not the first
Mahabharata will tell of this
Eyes are watching from the sky
That before the flood
Ruled the land of mankind

The triangle

Pass into another dimension
Materialize into another world
Lost within a void in space
Where have we been taken to?
Prehistoric engineering
Astronomical intelligence
Alien watchers from deep in space
Legendary fact from our past

A mystery surrounding the earth
We are not the first
Mahabharata will tell of this
Eyes are watching from the sky
That before the flood
Ruled the land of mankind
