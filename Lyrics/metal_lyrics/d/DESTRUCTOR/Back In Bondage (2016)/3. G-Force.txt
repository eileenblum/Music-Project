Mach 4 piercing through the clouds
A madman in manic pursuit of his dreams
The machines controls lie in your hands
Your mind it screams with the sky

G force untamed force

On the back of your 4 16 nightmare
Your thoughts running quickly along side
Never could you turn back sane with your mind
Willing to take the chance or pay with death

G force deadly force

Growing speed burning need overwhelming intensity
Living hell in the spell of reality
In the grip of death sudden loss of breath
Shattering veins in your head your neck snaps back
You can feel your body had never hoped to meet
And now it's over like the ones before
A dream exploding a closing door
