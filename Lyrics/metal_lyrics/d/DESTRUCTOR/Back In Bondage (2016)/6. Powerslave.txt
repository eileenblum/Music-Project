I have come before you
To bear my soul
Release a dream that I know
I'm afraid I've lost control

Feel the pain know the pain live the pain

I'm an eternal power slave
Always eternal that power slave

Still I'm running faster
But I'm going nowhere
My friends please forgive me
The great beyond I want to be

Feel the pain know the pain live the pain

I'm an eternal power slave
Always eternal that power slave
I'm an eternal power slave
I'll take my pain to my grave, yes I will
