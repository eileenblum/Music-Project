Reaching down to the earth
Mother cloud giving birth
Twisting winds killer storm
Natures violent power
Two hundred miles per hour
Ripping life from the ground
Tossing buildings around
A power so strong
It blows you away

Life is short from birth to death
Hammering tornado
Frantic annihilation
Total devastation following
It's a terrifying course
A matter of seconds
Tremendous roar subsides
Complete silence cast
Disappear into the skies
