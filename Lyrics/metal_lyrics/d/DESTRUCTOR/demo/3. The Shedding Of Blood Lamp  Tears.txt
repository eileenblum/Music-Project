On this planet mankind fights his race
Death and hunger, disease taking over our lives
Dripping blood on the peace sign
Staining the hearts of your brothers and sisters
Victims of violence and terrorism
Pay the price of this world's mistakes

The shedding of blood and tears
The shedding of blood and tears

Blood and tears of the ones who are suffering
Wash into the oceans and they soak the earth
Killing one another
Hell bent on self destruction
Outbreaks of criminal violence
Once again the peace maker falls

The shedding of blood and tears
The shedding of blood and tears
