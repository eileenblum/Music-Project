Entering the Saragasso
The mysterious sea of fear
An unexplainable calm
Something is growing near
No breeze can drive our ship
The thick seaweed holds us still
Disappear into the air
Not a trace left of a crew

A mystery surrounding the earth
We are not the first
Mahabharata will tell of this
Eyes are watching from the sky
That before the flood
Ruled the land of mankind
The Triangle

Pass into another dimension
Materializing into another world
Lost within a void in space
Where have we been taken to?
Prehistoric engineering
Astronomical intelligence
Alien watchers from deep in space
Legendary fact from our past

A mystery surrounding the earth
We are not the first
Mahabharata will tell of this
Eyes are watching from the sky
That before the flood
Ruled the land of mankind
The Triangle

Entering the Saragasso
The mysterious sea of fear
An unexplainable calm
Something is growing near
No breeze can drive our ship
The thick seaweed holds us still
Disappear into the air
Not a trace left of a crew

A mystery surrounding the earth
We are not the first
Mahabharata will tell of this
Eyes are watching from the sky
That before the flood
Ruled the land of mankind
The Triangle
