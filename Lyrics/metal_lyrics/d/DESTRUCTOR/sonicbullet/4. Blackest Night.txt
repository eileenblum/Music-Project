Waiting alone, fire invades the earth
Ripping through every piece of land
Surrounded by fallout, the earth is dying
With no chance to survive

No shelter from radiation, no place to hide

The greed for power sent
Screaming iron in the air
None of these bastards even cared

No shelter from radiation, no place to hide
You're gonna die, you're gonna die, yeah
In the blackest night

Fight for your life, your time is running short
Kill to save yourself, or they'll stab you in the back
Torture you, lie in pain, your life will start to drain
Your body, on the ground, twisted bloody remains

Waiting alone, fire invades the earth
Ripping through every piece of land
Surrounded by fallout, the earth is dying
With no chance to survive

No shelter from radiation, no place to hide
You're gonna die, you're gonna die, yeah
In the blackest night
