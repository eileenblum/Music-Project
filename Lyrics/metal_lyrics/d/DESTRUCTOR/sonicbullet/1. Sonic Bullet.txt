Smashed on the ground
From the hammer of reality
Chained and shackled down
But there's a burn that sets me free

Sonic bullet
Ripping past your head
A thousand watts
You'll be left for dead
Iron gun
It has no fear
Blood and guts
And lots of beer
Sonic bullet
Sonic bullet
I'm locked and loaded
Sonic bullet
Aimed straight at you

A perfect day
Kick you in the teeth
I am the weapon now
Put you underneath

Sonic bullet
Ripping past your head
A thousand watts
You'll be left for dead
Iron gun
It has no fear
Blood and guts
And lots of beer
Sonic bullet
Sonic bullet
I'm locked and loaded
Sonic bullet
Aimed straight at you

Sonic bullet
Ripping past your head
A thousand watts
You'll be left for dead
Iron gun
It has no fear
Blood and guts
And lots of beer
Sonic bullet
Sonic bullet
I'm locked and loaded
Sonic bullet
Aimed straight at you

Sonic bullet
Ripping past your head
A thousand watts
You'll be left for dead
Iron gun
It has no fear
Blood and guts
And lots of beer
Sonic bullet
Sonic bullet
I'm locked and loaded
Sonic bullet
Aimed straight at you
