Mach 4, piercing through the clouds
A mad man in manic pursuit of his dreams
The machine's controls lie in your hands
Your mind it screams with the sky, G-Force
Untamed force

On the back of your F-16 nightmare
Your thoughtsrunning quickly along side
Never could turn your back, sane, with your mind
Willing to take the chance or pay with death
G-Force deadly force

Growing speed, burning need, overwhelming intensity
Living hell in the spell of reality
In the grips of death, sudden loss of breathe
Shattering veins in your head, your neck snaps back
You can feel your body crushed into the seat
A fear so strong you'd never hoped to meet
And now it's over like the ones before
A dream exploding a closing door
