Now nothing can stop us
Pound the earth with pummeling steel
The army of iron dogs
Loose canyons to do what we will
Holding steadfast in total combat
Chosen ones kill the poseur shit

Loading fire
The shells begins
Blow all the fake
Metal to bits

With heavy
Heavy artillery
Heavy
As a killing spree, alright

Only true metal warriors
Destroy blashemic music
Marshall wattage, volume in tow
We are well equipped
Heavy metal thunder assault
Armored destructor attack

Tons and tons
Of lethal TNT
Open the floodgates
Standing ready

With heavy
Heavy artillery
Heavy
As a killing spree, alright

With heavy
Heavy artillery
Heavy
As a killing spree, alright
