Held inside with hammer and sickle
Assaulted with tormentive rule
Prisoners forced to live in pain
Blinded from the life they've never seen

The government in control
The massive iron had fallen
Isolated from all mankind
Sick led shadow burned in their minds

The iron curtain [3x]
Chained by the force of the curtain
The iron curtain [3x]

Tormented captive dragged down by cold chains
Light fades darkness invades the dungeon of doom
Hunger is alive in this cell of hungry rats
An evil life they've lived
Now a sentence to pay to the curtain

The iron curtain [3x]
Chained by the force of the curtain
The iron curtain [3x]
