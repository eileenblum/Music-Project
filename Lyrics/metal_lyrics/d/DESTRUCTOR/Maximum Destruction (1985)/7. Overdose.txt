I can feel it in my veins
Feels like fire
Metallic buzz
Pounding convulsions
Stoned with steel
Powerful surge drives us on

Time is wasting
Gasp for breath
Inject it in
Pull away from death
Overload the circuits
Metal spike deep
Feel alive with overdose

You got a need
Metal rush
We're the pusher
Come to us
High energy drives you on
Through your veins
To your brain

Time is wasting
Gasp for breath
Inject it in
Pull away from death
Overload the circuits
Metal spike deep
Feel alive with overdose

There is no doubt
We are wasted
Faithful living
Our own drug
Heavy metal that
We're alive for
Party every night
Until death

Time is wasting
Gasp for breath
Inject it in
Pull away from death
Overload the circuits
Metal spike deep
Feel alive with overdose

Overdose â Overdose
Overdose - Overdose
Overdose - Overdose
Overdose - Overdose
Overdose - Overdose
Overdose - Overdose
