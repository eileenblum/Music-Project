Bondage
We heard all about her
We know her game
Leather whips and handcuffs
Her body wants pain

Take her home
Tie her up
Going wild
All positions
You're her slave
Must behave
Kneel to all her wishes

Around the world in thirty minutes
It's gone too far
When she shows you her rivets
Bruised little body sweet and clean
Wet patch panties lookin' sixteen

Take her home
Tie her up
Going wild
All positions
You're her slave
Must behave
Kneel to all her wishes

Give us bondage tonight!

Hot chains and leather
Against her flesh
Takin' it harder
And faster
That's her wish

Feels so good
Doin' it tonight
Pain and pleasure
It's alright
Strap me up
Really tight
She wants bondage every night!

We gotta get some bondage tonight!

Bondage!
Bondage!
C'mon bitch!
Bondage!
Bondage!
Bondage!
Bondage!
