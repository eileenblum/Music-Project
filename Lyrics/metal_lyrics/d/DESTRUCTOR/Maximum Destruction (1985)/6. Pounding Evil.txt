Mist is rising time is near
Satan's militia appears
The power we have the strength
In hand
We must defeat again!

Sword at side moon up high
Who will survive the fight?
Battle commense blood intense
God is with us tonight!

We're pounding evil!
We're pounding evil!

Satan wants you to be his
Decide what to do
âCause evil is not the way
The fire he's breathing is burning
Down your back
He's waiting to attack

We're pounding evil!
We're pounding evil!
We're pounding evil!
We're pounding evil!

The fighting the burning
The raising of Hell
Our mission awaiting tonight
Out to crush Satan
His eternal domain
No more torture no pain

Devastated they lay all around
Satan is gone fled for now
Scarred in battle but soon will return
Join to pound evil you all must learn

Mist is rising tome is near
Satan's militia appears
The power we have the strength
In hand

We must defeat again
Sword at side moon up high
Who will survive the fight
Battle commense blood intense
God is with us tonight!

We're pounding evil!
We're pounding evil!
We're pounding evil!
We're pounding evil!

Pounding evil!
