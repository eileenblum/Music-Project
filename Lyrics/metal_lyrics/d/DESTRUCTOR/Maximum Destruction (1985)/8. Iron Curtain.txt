Held inside with hammer and sickle
Assaulted with tormentive rule
Prisoners forced to live in pain
Blinded from the life
They've never seen

The government in control
The massive iron has fallen
Isolated from all manking
Sickled shadow burned
In their minds

The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain
Chained by the force of the Curtain
The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain

Tormented captive dragged
Down by cold chains
Light fades darkness invades
The dungeon of doom
Hunger is alive in this cell
Of hungry rats
An evil life they've lived
Now a sentence to pay to the curtain

The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain
Chained by the force of the Curtain
The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain

The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain
Chained by the force of the Curtain
The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain
The Iron Curtain
