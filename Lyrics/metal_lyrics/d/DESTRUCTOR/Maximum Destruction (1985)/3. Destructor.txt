Rabid

Maniac headbanging
Every night
What we must do what
We believe to be right
We were born unto
Leather, chains, and steel
The power of
DESTRUCTOR
Is what we feel
Black iron stacks
Towering the stage
Thrash! Going wild!
We're burning with rage!
Exploding with metal
We ride our domain
Molten sonic feedback
Drives us insane

Pounding the heaviest
Of metal!
Pushing ourselves over
The top to the edge!

We're got the future â
We've got the power

Mad chronic
Headbangers
Shouting louder
People with hang-ups
Try to bring us down
Smash those FUCKERS
Make our sound!

Pounding the heaviest
Of metal!
Pushing ourselves over
The top to the edge!

Come on Flammable
Overkill
Pound Holocaust

We have no mercy
Only total speed
Extreme power metal
On which we feed
Hot melting leather
The chains that grind
Sound of ripping metal
Summons our kind
Our amps overload
You're going wild
Destroyed twisted stage
Left in a pile

Pounding the heaviest
Of metal!
Pushing ourselves over
The top to the edge!

DESTRUCTOR!
