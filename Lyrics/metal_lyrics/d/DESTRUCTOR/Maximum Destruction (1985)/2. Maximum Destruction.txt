Onward through the sky
Carrying a megadeath hunk
Of blackened steel
Bring forth megaton
Elimination
Because of their need
For power causing war

Death screams
Ride on
The fiery winds
Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Holocaust of damnation

Maximum Destruction
Maximum Destruction
Maximum Destruction
Maximum Destruction

We're going to die! Why?

Atomic power cloud
Blast wave moving faster
Than the speed of sound
High pressure grinds brick
Into dust

Glowing intensely
Ball of deadly flames
Knowing our time is ending
Soon to die
On our way
Within thought
Wondering why

Maximum Destruction
Maximum Destruction
Maximum Destruction

Flash burns melt the flesh
Of victims still alive
Raging firestorm millions
Of degrees
Revolutionization of warfare
Welcome to the age
Of maximum destruction

Maximum Destruction
Maximum Destruction
Maximum Destruction
Maximum Destruction
Maximum Destruction
Maximum Destruction
