Challenge me, what I'm about
Go away, like the gout
Me gone? Not so fast
It's you I'll outlast

Straight to hell
You can go
Straight to hell

Remember me, my old friend
Love to see, see me dead
'Til the end, until goodbye
I'm there to remind

Straight to hell
You can go
Straight to hell

Challenge me, what I'm about
Go away, like the gout
Me gone? Not so fast
It's you I'll outlast

Straight to hell
You can go
Straight to hell
