Raging forces, ripping at her core
Raping the land, earth is the whore
Rivers run dry, devastation greets
The seeds of evil deeds

Come and kill her
Come and kill her

Developing death, urban decay
All must pray, we dig our graves
Extinctions birth, finally is done
Blackened skies, fading sun

Come and
Come and kill her

Unearth the earth
Unearth the earth
Unearth the earth
Unearth the earth

As society progresses
We unearth the heart of our mother
Until all that once is no longer

Killer
Killer

Unearth the earth
Unearth the earth
Unearth the earth
Unearth the earth
