You must agree, when on your knees
Torture and death, of which to be
Speak no truth, with lies that hide
If you feel pain, you're still alive

Step inside, feel free to die
In a world of war

Get out your claws, if you want to live
Your first born, be sure to give

Step inside, feel free to die
In a world of war

With blood we clean, the dead are freed
Screams ignored, beyond the door
In a world of war

Ideology, founded on your dead
Mindless beast, with lives it's fed

Get out your claws, if you want to live
Mindless beast, when your life is dead

You must agree, when on your knees
Torture and death, of which to be
Speak no truth, with lies that hide
If you feel pain, you're still alive

Step inside, feel free to die
In a world of war

With blood we clean, the dead are fed
Screams ignored, beyond the door
World of war, world of war
