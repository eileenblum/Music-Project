Raw power, what we come from
Forged steel, second to none
Everlasting, heavy weather
Set me free, studded leather

Immortal metal
It can never die
Forever in leather
Metal will stay alive

Awakening, eternal dawn
Unworthy, all but gone
The gathering, those who feed
We live on yet we bleed

Onward destiny leads me
To another life beyond
I'm still here yet I'm gone
The metal, the metal is living on

Immortal metal
It can never die
Forever in leather
Metal will stay alive

Raw power, what we come from
Forged steel, second to none
Everlasting, heavy weather
Set me free, studded in leather

Onward destiny leads me
To another life beyond
I'm still here yet I'm gone
The metal, the metal is living on

Immortal metal
It can never die
Forever in leather
Metal will stay alive
