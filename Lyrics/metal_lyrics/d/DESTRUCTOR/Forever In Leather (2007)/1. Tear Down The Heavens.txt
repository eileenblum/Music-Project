Alpha and omega
The beginning of the end
Destiny revealed
A messenger is sent
Across the boundaries of time
Good and evil
The burning heavens
Are never ending

Rip apart the sky
Let the fire fly

Tear down the heavens
Beginning of Armageddon
Tear down the heavens
Beginning of Armageddon

Scorn is all life
From our existence
Creating anew
Blood and fire
Across the boundaries of time
Good and evil
The burning heavens
Are never ending

Rip apart the sky
Let the fire fly

Tear down the heavens
Beginning of Armageddon
Tear down the heavens
Beginning of Armageddon

Tear down the heavens
Tear down the heavens
Tear down the heavens
Beginning of Armageddon

Rip apart the sky
Let the fire fly
For all men die
Never again alive

Tear down the heavens
Beginning of Armageddon
Tear down the heavens
Beginning of Armageddon

Tear down the heavens
Tear down the heavens
Tear down the heavens
Beginning of Armageddon
