Leaving here, no time to kill
On the road, do what we will
No restraints, no holding back
Hit the sound, full on attack

Gotta break free from the grind
Need some release for my mind
Moving in for the kill
Test my iron will

Unleashed, unleashed
I'm wild and free
I'm unleashed
Unleashed
I'm wild and free

Think it over, come back again
Hold the fire, in my hand
Neutralize, the coming tide
As I take your soul tonight

Rolling treads 'cross your head
Submit or be left or dead
Moving in for the kill
Test my iron will

Unleashed, unleashed
I'm wild and free
I'm unleashed
Unleashed
I'm wild and free

I'm unleashed

Unleashed, unleashed
I'm wild and free
I'm unleashed
Unleashed
I'm wild and free

Unleashed
