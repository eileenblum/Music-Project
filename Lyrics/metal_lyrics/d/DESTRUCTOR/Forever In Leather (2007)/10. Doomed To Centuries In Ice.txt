So alone and cold
In the distance through the snow
Banished from where I dwell
Tundra of ice and man so frail
Comes death to take my soul
Survival slipping away
Frozen hands clutch in endless time

Now dark days, without light
Now dark days, doomed
To centuries in ice

Slow to die, beating heart
Instinct to stay alive
But with a hope and a will
Doomed to exist, forsaken life

Doomed to centuries in ice
Doomed to centuries in ice
Doomed to centuries in ice
Doomed to centuries in ice
