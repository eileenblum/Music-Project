Fighting, slashing until the death
Metal of the faithful will ever last
Stand in the way and you will fall
Only the believers, they hear the call
Pounding warriors, countries unite
Together in the black night

Pounding warriors
That's the way we are
Pounding warriors
Forever we are
Pounding warriors
We kill at command

Thrashing, destruction
Complete command
Metal armor, united we stand
Hammering drums, crushing guitars
That's the way we are

Pounding warriors
That's the way we are
Pounding warriors
Forever we are
Pounding warriors
We kill at command

Fighting, slashing until death
Metal of the faithful, will ever last
Stand in our way and you will fall
Only the believers, they hear the call
Pounding warriors, countries untie
Together for one 'cause
In the black night

Pounding warriors
That's the way we are
Pounding warriors
Forever we are
Pounding warriors
We kill at command

Pounding warriors
Pounding warriors
Pounding warriors
We kill at command
