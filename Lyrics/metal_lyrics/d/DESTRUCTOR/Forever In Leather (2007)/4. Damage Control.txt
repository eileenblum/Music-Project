Lost control, blinding greed
None at helm, evil succeeds

Feel the need to strike
Eradicate those lives
Wolves are sheep no more
Damage control means war

To the wall, our backs no more
Nothing left, sound the war

Feel the need to strike
Eradicate those lives
Wolves are sheep no more
Damage control means war

Growing cancer, spreading fast
Sickened minds, kill the mass
To the wall, our backs no more
Nothing left, sound the war

Feel the need to strike
Eradicate those lives
Wolves are sheep no more
Damage control means war
