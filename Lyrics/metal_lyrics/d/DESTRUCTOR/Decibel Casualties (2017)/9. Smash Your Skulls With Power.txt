Smoking cerebrums kicking ass tonight
Hitting the stage
Pounding it out, fight for metal, smash the wimps
Hardcore slamming flying flesh
Thrashing mayhem
Feeling intense stand united
Move aside now
Rabid thrashing, as the volume knobs on our marshals melt
There's a holocaust burning out the hall tonight!

Decibel casualties who keep the faith,
Attack! Attack!
The power of metal
Its lethal assault possesses your soul
Over the top punkers raging bangers pounding together
There is no difference between you and me,
Fuck the unbelievers
Overkill... harder banging - devastating
Flammable energy exploding drums
Atomic sound

Smash your skulls with power
Smash your skulls with power

Reigning claw slashing the earth
Overdoing frenzy
Extreme cranium mutilation,
Smash your skulls
Burning frets kick it down I've got to scream
We take control
Never to be stepped on again

Smash your skulls with power
Smash your skulls with power
Smash your skulls with power
Smash your skulls with power

Smoking cerebrums kicking ass tonight
Hitting the stage
Pounding it out, fight for metal, smash the wimps
Hardcore slamming flying flesh
Thrashing mayhem
Feeling intense stand united
Move aside now

Smash your skulls with power
Smash your skulls with power
Smash your skulls with power
Smash your skulls with power
