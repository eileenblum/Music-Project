Slaved away to stay alive
Gearing up in overdrive
Kick it down and decimate
The energy consumates

Hey, are you ready?
We are ready!
Hey, are you ready?
We are ready!

Grinding guts every day
Banging heads 'till it's late
Sweating bullets, obliterate
Total force retaliates

Hey, are you ready?
We are ready!
Hey, are you ready?
We are ready!

Stand you may, long as we do
Many believe this is true
Time prepared conditioned minds
Living for the chosen life

We are ready!
We are ready!
