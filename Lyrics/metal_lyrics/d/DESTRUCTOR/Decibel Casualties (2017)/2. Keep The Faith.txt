When I first heard the call, young was I
Lights and stage, power can't be denied
The Metal sound, did bring me alive
Dedicated to it, all of my life

Surrender not, my undying dream
Born of steel, I am the scream
The spirit breathes, in these lungs of mine
Flowing through me, branded in my mind

Never faulter
From the Metal altar
We are the ones
To carry on forevermore

In the hearts of ours
Are fires burning on
Keep the faith, keep the faith
In the hearts of ours
Are fires burning strong
Keep the faith, keep the faith

Looking back, to the time that changed my life
Driven on, to keep the faith alive
The spirit breathes, in these lungs of mine
Flowing through me, branded in my mind

Never faulter
From the Metal altar
We are the ones
To carry on forevermore

In the hearts of ours
Are fires burning on
Keep the faith, keep the faith
In the hearts of ours
Are fires burning strong
Keep the faith, keep the faith

In the hearts of ours
Are fires burning on
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Made from Metal
Born from Steel
Keep the faith forevermore

Never faulter
From the Metal altar
We are the ones
To carry on forevermore

In the hearts of ours
Are fires burning on
Keep the faith, keep the faith
In the hearts of ours
Are fires burning strong
Keep the faith, keep the faith

In the hearts of ours
Are fires burning on
Keep the faith, keep the faith
In the hearts of ours
Are fires burning strong
Keep the faith, keep the faith

Keep the faith, keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith
