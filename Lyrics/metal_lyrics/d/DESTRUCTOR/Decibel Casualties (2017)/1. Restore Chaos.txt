We are here, gather around
Light and fire burn this town

Rent the air, joining voices
You will fall, making choices

Out of hope, not a prayer
We descend upon your lair

Chaos calls hard and fast tonight
Bloody dreams, battle cry

Blackened hearts wound up so tight
In the frenzy, takes the reins
Souls of fire, crazed and insane
Stone is carved, chaos the name

Restore chaos
Restore chaos
Restore chaos
Restore chaos


Restore chaos
Restore chaos
Restore chaos
Restore chaos

Restore chaos
Restore chaos
Restore chaos
Restore chaos


We are here, gather around
Light and fire, burn this town

Rent the air, joining voices
You will fall, making choices

Out of hope, not a prayer
We descend, upon your lair

With chaos!
