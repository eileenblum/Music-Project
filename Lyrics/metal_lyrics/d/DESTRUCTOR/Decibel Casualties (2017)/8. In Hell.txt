Creeping cloud, to the eyes, hiding unseen
Doom and darkness, coming alive, tonight realized

At your side, now is the
Blackest days
Weak you are, and so frail
To the evil, pay

Black death has cast a spell
A curse crawled up from Hell
Black death has cast a spell
In Hell

Onto the blood, of crawling creatures, feasting
Now on to you, coming your way, it's time to die

At your side, now is the
Blackest days
Weak you are, and so frail
To the evil, pay

Black death has cast a spell
A curse crawled up from Hell
Black death has cast a spell in Hell
In Hell

Creeping cloud, to the eyes, hiding unseen
Doom and darkness, coming alive, tonight realized

At your side, now is the
Blackest days
Weak you are, and so frail
To the evil, pay

In Hell
In Hell
In Hell
In Hell
