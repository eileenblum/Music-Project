God gives us the right
Calling all to demise
Holy curators of grief
Beget extreme beliefs

The coming of all we dread
Beckoning call, to the living dead
So it is written, it now shall be
The last days on earth, for you and me

The last days
The last days on earth
The last days
The last days on earth

Religion disguises lies
Faith, yours is so blind
So the promised land
Never will be for man

The coming of all we dread
Beckoning call, to the living dead
So it is written, it now shall be
The last days on earth, for you and me

The last days
The last days on earth
The last days
The last days on earth
