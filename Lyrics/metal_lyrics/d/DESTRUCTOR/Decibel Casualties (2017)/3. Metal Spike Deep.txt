You've fallen out of grace, on the mountain steep
What has become of the wretched life you keep?
You're a fool, so now you die
To this world, say goodbye

Metal spike deep
The metal spike, goes deep in your face
Metal spike deep
The metal spike, goes deep in your face

Your wealth and power, abused, it sickens me
Without vision, so lost, you can't see
Such a disgrace to the human race
Hammer the spike deep in your face

Metal spike deep
The metal spike, goes deep in your face
Metal spike deep
The metal spike, goes deep in your face

Still you breathe and walk this land of mine
More and more of the same kind
You're a fool, so now you die
To this world, say goodbye

Metal spike deep
The metal spike goes deep in your face
Metal spike deep
The metal spike goes deep in your face
