Keep it alive, keeping it true
Dying for steel, me and you

Together in power, united minds
Pounding it out
Now, commence poser genocide

Heavy Metal for life, Heavy Metal
Metal 'till death
Heavy Metal for life, Heavy Metal
Metal 'till death

The sweat and the fury, molten fire abide
The sound of Metal keeps you alive

Together in power, united minds
Pounding it out
Now, commence poser genocide

Heavy Metal for life, Heavy Metal
Metal 'till death
Heavy Metal for life, Heavy Metal
Metal 'till death

The leather burns, fists in the air!
You, headbangers, are everywhere!
