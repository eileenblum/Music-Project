Viral infection-Divinity destroyed

It's like having anthrax in the pen or having venom in a limb
If you don't cut it out it will infect us all

Breathe disease we've been bitten by the fleas the imps born of Satan's brood
The priest deceives preaching to our minds of peace while free to carry on in sin

I hear it all the time the strain has left them dead inside like they abhor the sacrifice while their lips praise God

Laodicean blood flows within our veins

Cheap grace is a social disease
Bacteria infects heavens liberty
An excuse to sin and act the enemy
Unholiness within profane sanctuary

Return to your first love or have you gone insane

The dead will walk again as an enemy within while wearing saints skin with a mock quarantine

The mouth that singeth praise spreads the virus that will kill

It feeds on blood poisoned soul
This infection takes control
Numb conscience flaunting lust
A good virus won't kill it's host

The undead are reserved for the flames of hell

Something that boils the blood the flesh is red and it's flush
Sweating anticipation to feed like a beast on perverted lust
Something that swells the brain feverish virus that justifies
Reproaching His Holy Name claiming His Truth with sin in your life

Viral infection-Divinity destroyed

It's like having leaven int he bread or like the stench of something dead
A hazard to the soul spread by infected heretics

Feed and breed like this dead world will achieve some sort of peace
Faith diseased like you're on the path the lies appeased just to stave the guilt
