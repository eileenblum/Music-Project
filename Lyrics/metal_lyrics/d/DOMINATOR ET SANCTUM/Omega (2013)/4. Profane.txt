Heaping up this filthy scorn-Unrepentant
Vomit-Repeat-Vomit more-Unrepentant
Nothing will be gained from this-The worst kind of sin-Blasphemy-Forked split the tongue
This is hatred of God's Laws-Profanity-Depraved oaths to mince

I would you will not be deceived
And your religion done in vain
Piling high the need to judge-Blasphemous-Profane
He who bridleth not his tongue
Sells his soul for no profit nor no gain

No temptation to this sin-Unrepentant
Brothers brought to verbal ruin-Unrepentant
Horrid din of blasphemy-Heinous and profane-Blasphemy-Witness made in vain
Stunted Truths by oaths from hell-Deceived by this sin-Profanity-Devil incarnate

Oh what a waste of time-With this heinous godless crime
Claim the Name of Jesus Christ and talk like the devil
Why would you waste our time-hypocrisy piling his
Blaspheming the Name of Christ you hypocrite devil

I would you will not be deceived
While declaring allegiance to your King
Detestable oaths we say-Duplicitous-Deranged
From the mouth that singeth praise
Liberty is excuse for abomination

I would you will not be deceived
And your religion done in vain
Piling high the need to judge-Blasphemous-Profane
He who bridleth not his tongue
Sells his soul for no profit nor no gain
