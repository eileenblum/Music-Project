This is the Royal Bloodline a lineage of the faithful

The Holy King of Kings-Eternal Righteous Being
In Him all things consist-For the Spotless Lamb

Contentious disputes arise when honour is thrown away
And we lessen the Divine Wisdom of the Holy Sovereign King
Man will enthrone himself in profane audacity
Grant this heart of flesh to humbly bow before the Holy King

The Eternal Throne is upon His Blood and Mercy Seat
The Eternal Throne is upon His Blood and Mercy Seat

Architect of Sovereign Will-Perfect governance
And no allegiance-To any human politics
Infinite Eternal Kingdom Everlasting
Infinite adjudication-We get what we deserve
Founded upon perfection-By nothing but a Word
Sacrificial Lamb of the Eternal Offering

Do not put failed intellect
And inject your prerogatives
Onto the Holy Sovereign

On this Eternal Throne-Perfect permanence
Adorned in infinite crowns-Perfect in judgment
Casting out the wretched god that's of this world
Ruling by decree-Never ending majesty
A perfect Holy Law-Kingdom everlasting
All shall pass away except the promise of His Word

Do not put failed intellect
And inject your prerogatives
Onto the Holy Sovereign

This is the Royal Bloodline a lineage of the faithful

The creature must be ruled by the Creator
Lest he claim as his own the omnipotence of God

Jesus is the only King that puts the facts in reasoning
For He is the only thing that is truly absolute

The Eternal Throne is upon His Blood and Mercy Seat
The Eternal Throne is upon His Blood and Mercy Seat
