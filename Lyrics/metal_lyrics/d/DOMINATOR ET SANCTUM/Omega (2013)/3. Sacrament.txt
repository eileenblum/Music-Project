Something old and something new that delicately strokes the ego
Denial of all reason that's an act of faith something fundamental

Religion of no religion
Faith that man will soon be god
Religion of elements
Another tooth upon the cog

In a world of fantasy-Primordial ancestry
Sacraments of belief-Belief in no belief
Partake of Gaias flesh-Saints and sacrifice
Feed the deity of elements-The meaning of life

I know what it really is that keeps you in the dark

Four fundamental needs
Life's meaning with no meaning
Unregenerate and deranged
Atheist theocracy

I know what it really is you're a worshiper of lust

Infinite complexity
Of a protein chain
Only as strong as the weakest link
Impossible probability

I know what it really is that makes you scoff at God

I know what it really is John Calvin was right

Something old and something new that delicately strokes the ego
Denial of all reason that's an act of faith something fundamental

Religion of no religion
Faith that man will soon be god
Religion of elements
Another tooth upon the cog

Eat the flesh of Darwin-Deaths patron saint
Burn the conscience in your sin-wickedness innate
