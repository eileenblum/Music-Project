Father above lift my soul to a higher place
Where the pillars of my mind will be pounded into dust

Even the devil knows the Holy Truth and he hates Its Holy end

Father above lift my soul to a higher plain
Sovereign God sterilize me in my essential pain
Volatile and sublime I choose not to falter
And the fire form the heavens will consume the altar

The infantile mind does not withdraw itself from its fleshly lust

Within flames erased by pain pretensions inside my mind
Mortify the profane allegiance in deeds to my Christ
Garments spotted in flesh the fruits of religious fraud
Unholy heart yet orthodox a beast that will defame God

Sacrifice is sacrilege if obedience to Christ is gone
Unholy heart yet orthodox a beast that will defame God

We are here as sheep among the wolves
We are not in this for our own
Pagan gods unleashing poison flesh
When did allegiance to Christ excuse acting like them

A Holy heart will bear the truth of the fear of God

Persecutors are sowing the profane
The devils brood will make it all in vain
Mocking Holiness with a cheap form of grace
Wicked deeds heap up scorn upon Gods Holy Name

A holy heart will bear the truth of the fear of God

Father above lift my soul to a higher place
Where the pillars of my mind will be pounded into dust

Even the devil knows the Holy Truth and he hates Its Holy end
