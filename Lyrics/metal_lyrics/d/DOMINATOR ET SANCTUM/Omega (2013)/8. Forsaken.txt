There has got to be something more today
Than these religious games that we play
So sincere yet it is still so fake
A soul asleep while the flesh is still awake

Talking about reformation yet unwilling to lay aside all these sins
Talk and talk there is no action history repeats itself again

There has got to be something more today
Than these religious games that we play

Sin is what made the breach between thee and thy God
How can rationality make peace with Him in sin?

Will the devils fire darts ignite the thatch of our own intrinsic corruption?
Only the most sadistic would go plowing through the sacred wearing nothing but a vulpine grin

To take your sin not forsaken is just complete heresy
Only the most sadistic would have God betray His honour by justifying all our sin

Sin can only skulk on terms invented by mankind
The most depraved think they love God while they hold their sin

So sincere yet it is still so fake
A soul asleep while the flesh is still awake

Consider His honour the terms He offers His peace upon you
What lust is so sweet or profits is worth burning in hell for?
What lust is so sweet or profits is worth burning in hell for?
