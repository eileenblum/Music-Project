Whipping up the pride of man into a fury
With a secondary Antichrist doctrine
Corrupted minds would urge against
Yielding of your practical obedience

Making Him a harsh Master for giving us commandments
Contrary in objection to the flesh and blood

Does the animal have the right to tell his Keeper how it is?

Habitual dedication to all His glory
Eyeing of His precepts in all that we do

Does the created one have the right to tell his Creator what He said?

It's the pulpits fault or haven't you heard?
For the mishandling of Gods Holy Word
He's removed the blessings He has given
While we debate metaphysical mysticism

Making Him a harsh Master for giving us commandments
Contrary in objection in all that we do

Does the animal have the right to control the Potter hands?

Farewell to the lust of the eyes and flesh
That would interpret the Absolute Word
Farewell enmity I have to my God
That would bend the Truth to my will

Are yo absolutely sure their are no absolutes?
If their is an absolute you're doomed

Farewell to the wretched pride of my life
I will bend my will to Christ alone
Everything that does not conform to Your Word
Is a lie straight from the poison of the flesh

Are yo absolutely sure their are no absolutes?
If their is an absolute you're doomed
