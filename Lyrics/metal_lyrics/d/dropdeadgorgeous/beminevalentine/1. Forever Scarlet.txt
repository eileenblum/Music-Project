Is this what you want, my heart on my sleeve?
Is this my conscience making my heart beat?
We are so over...
Is this what you call desperate?
Well I'm desperate for you.
She's all I ever wanted, and I'm just a face.
The truth will set you free.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
'Cause you look so graceful burning alive.
