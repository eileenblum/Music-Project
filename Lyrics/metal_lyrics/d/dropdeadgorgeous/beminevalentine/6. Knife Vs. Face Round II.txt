This is a nightmare. You've lost control.
Wake me before you reach the bottom, Of what never ends.
It feels like Summer in the Winter, It's raining all the time.
You fell like snowflakes, In the Summer,
Melting in the sky. This is everything,
This is everything I wanted.
If it wasn't for you, I'd be happier than ever.
And every time I think of you, I'll close my eyes,
And blacken my heart, and never love again.
Is this a 9mm or is this a ticket home?
And I'll forget you, alone, as I lie underground in peace.
Is this what you wanted? Are you happy now?
Will you live a life of lies and never look back?
And leave this place you once called home without a trace,
And call this a tragedy? Is this a tragedy or a romance?
We need a doctor baby, Not a souvenir.
This glass is poison, baby, it's not your last dance.
Hold on to something solid,
Don't run, it's now your time to go.
