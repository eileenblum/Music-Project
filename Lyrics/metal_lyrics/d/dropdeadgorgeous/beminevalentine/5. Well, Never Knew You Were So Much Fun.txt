I'm in line for the murder. First come, first serve.
You aim from across the hall, Your vision blurred,
Is this what you want from me? To hear me scream?
I'll die suddenly, My blood on your hands.
I'll die in tragedy, you'll live in vain.
Here comes the last masquerade.
Don't you just love a good time? I do.
