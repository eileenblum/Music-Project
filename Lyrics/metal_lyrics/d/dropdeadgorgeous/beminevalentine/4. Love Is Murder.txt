I'll be your Romeo. You'll be my Juliet.
You'll be so beautiful, so charming,
Lying dead in my room. I lost touch with my hand,
And the knife in your back. Short story, this tragic ending,
The missing link in the chain of events,
That have occurred gravely throughout the years.
You will not die with me.
