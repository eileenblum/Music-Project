I can't sleep tonight
Let's go.
Settle the score.
Knife vs. face: round I.
Stab me, directly in the heart.
Watch me bleed, lying at your feet.
Dying, living for just one last breath with you.
With you.
I live for you, and only you.
Stop lying, you know I'd lay with you.
We're dying, on the inside.
You're smiling, on the outside.
Forget the taste of me,
And follow your instincts.
