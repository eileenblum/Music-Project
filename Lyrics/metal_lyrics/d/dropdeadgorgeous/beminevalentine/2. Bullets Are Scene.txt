I think I'm missing something,
A subtle target on my heart.
I think I'm missing someone,
And that someone is you.
I want you right here,
I want you right now.
You want me, you got me.
Right here, right now.
So take a step back, tell me what you wanted.
Falling off the deep end, feeling guilty as charged.
Bullets are scene.
