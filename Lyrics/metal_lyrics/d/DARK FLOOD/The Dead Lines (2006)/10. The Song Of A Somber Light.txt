An old friend from the past
Has vanished today
Wathcing over seas
Waiting overseas
Learning to sleep here again

Grey all the harbours
And darkened the course
And the beacon of the tide
The light's only source
I'm learning to sleep alone again

And old friend from the past
The shadow on the ceiling today...

Death told a story
The terminal talks
Of a holy water in a trench
Of prayers and the pyre

Death told a story
The exhaustive talks
Of a halt of an instant machinery
Of a strike in Heaven's factory

And olf friend from the past
Has vanished today
Leave the lights on
For the shadow
Not to fade away
I'm learning to sleep here again...

Thi sleepwalking hour
I call you my world
You're taking me
Don't try to reach below

It's easy to see
Through your eyes
In the night
It's easy to see

To see you are leaving me
