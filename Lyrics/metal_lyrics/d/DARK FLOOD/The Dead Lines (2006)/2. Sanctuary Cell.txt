Let's discard the visions of tomorrow
The sky exploded miles away
And our hands grope
For the empty air

We dress in white
We could hardly bear
The light of the sun
That once came down
Here, to Earth

It was lifted on us
No fault for the wrecked shoulders
And everything in this place
So shredded from yesterday's shape

My dear
See the dark rising
The bird will come to us
My dear
See the dark rising
Feel the world in marvel spirit
My dear
See the dark rising
When the bird has come to us
My dear
It's the dark rising
When the wings break
The grey morning light

We discard the visions of tomorrow
When the sky exploded miles away
And our hope dried
For sanctuary cell
