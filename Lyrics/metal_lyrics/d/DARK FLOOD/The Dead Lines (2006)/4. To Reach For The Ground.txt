See it all breaking sever
Feel it all collapsing down
You know
The trace will never stay the same
When walked with ashes and smoke

And little would you know
If you claimed there's a haven
For us to ashore

We are lowered here today and forever
After everything is told in and out

And what the force can tell us of echo?
There's none calling back from there
The gravity is stronger as we go
The way, deceiving, and we know where

Seen it all never been built again
Seen it all never been risen tall
My friend
The trace will never stay the same
When reached beyond the human kind

And little do you see
'Cause you say there's heaven
For us all above

We are lowered here today and forever
After everything is told in and out

And what the force can tell us of echo?
There's none calling back from there
The gravity is stronger as we go
The way, deceiving, and we know where

No, a few elements of hero
Cannot last forever
After all will become one with it
- the ground
