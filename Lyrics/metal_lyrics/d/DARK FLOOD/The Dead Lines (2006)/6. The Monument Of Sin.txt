Lift the tombstone
For the grave of the Earth
They dragged the ark
To the shores of the wastelands
Their painted moon
And suspended sun
In throes of doubt
Hitchhiking on the causeway of time

The ark followed the waves
To the soils of perdition
Led the kin
To the fields of temptation

Hedon is the temper
Hedon to be the form
While hunger for redeemer
And deeds to come undone

And the sin is stronger
Than you first thought
Even deeper
Than you have sought
And the sin is stronger
Than you first thought
Chapels and temples
The church of the dying
They soon begin to tremble
The monument of sin

Falters leaked
Into a perpetual reactor
To witness the death
Of an indefinite conductor
To wipe out the moon
And cut the strings of the sun
In throes of doubt
Lost on the causeway of time

And Hedon is your temper
Hedon to be your form
Not the hunger for the saviour
For deeds to go undone
