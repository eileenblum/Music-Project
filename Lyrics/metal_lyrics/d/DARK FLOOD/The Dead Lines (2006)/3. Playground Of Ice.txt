I carry the dirge of times
To unfold the misery in men
A single trace behind
My fortune fades
I know it's the same
Thaty you will face
In your subsequent steps

I cannot try in this stream of life
This time my look, alarmed
Will bring you against
Those thousand dreams
I have ever built myself
Do you know now
I'm geting empty?

Trust me back against the ground
To the ice of this playground
Before I turn into soil
Under the wrecked stars

But now, when I've climbed
The trampled heights
And soaked beneath
The desolated skies
See me without disguise
And the dew that mornings brings
Stoned on my back
And with friends bewildered
Someone made me a statue
- so dead

I cannot hide in the sands of time
And let me tell you
This is far beyond control
And you paint my future bible black

But now, when I've climbed
The trampled heights
And soaked beneath
The desolated skies
See me without disguise
And the dew that mornings brings
Stoned on my back
And with friends estranged
You made me a statue
- so dead
