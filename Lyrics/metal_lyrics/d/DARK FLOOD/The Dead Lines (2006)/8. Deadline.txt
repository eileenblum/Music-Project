"Dead breeze from that day
When the fraud made us brave
No soleace today. Decisions made
When it rains into an empty grave..."

We'll see it tomorrow
We'll see how the night bends
The morning light
Built in pieces of future vision
And how dim is the light
In the future's decision

The funeral tomorrow
The Sunday drawing near
Came a streak of light
Brought a flicker of hope
And then disappeared

Trespassers here tomorrow
Left something open
In the morning light
No greeting strangers
No saying hello
If something could make them
Seem like fellow

But maybe they'll find it nowhere
It's buried in the woods
Drowned by the rivers
And waves
Scattered where
The wind blows fast

Well, see you tomorrow
See you when all is at the end
Remember me without sorrow
The mourners have it considered
With each tear swallowed
When trespassing here is allowed
