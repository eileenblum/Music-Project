Pace the burning universe
And the monuments of sin
When body in need of a shadow
And mind drifts with loneliness
And once spoken in great kindness
Save all my words
There are no words for this
The past such a lonely place for being
Life not worth the measuring
And after all this time
Here with this sadness
Wish that some of you could see this
Ragged shroud they wrapped me around
And put me into sleep
Beneath the mound
Through this burning universe
And the monuments of sin
Soon the satellite sky will turn red
The sting of the flesh of the living
And the times are different
No frame of life remained the same
Remains a difference in me
Iâve got my everything
The break of dawn reveals the ruins
Of everything in me
And yet they
Waiting for me to return
That id never crash and burn
That id never feel the embers
On this crumbled ground
That i would never drown
That i wouldn't need someone
To help me through this
