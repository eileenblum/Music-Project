The words of hedon
To speak is to struggle

I cannot help this
Your fingers like five hearses
Running down my spine
A breathing ghost
That keeps my table clean
And papers torn

Repeat the anger for hope
Our famine will grow strong in this night

A perfect state
A perfect mind
A perfect state of mind

Another night gone by
God's hands above my sight
I'm so alone, i'm feeling nothing
And everything counts this time
Could it bring back the night?
Never free, never yours

The words of hedon
To speak is to struggle

Cannot escape this
I seize the noise
Of a creeping storm
While the waves are getting higher
And our bodies roll
Our minds will grow old

Another night gone by
God's hands above my sight
I'm so alone, i'm feeling nothing
And everything counts this time
Could it bring back the night?
Never free, never yours

Another night gone by
God's hands above my sight
I'm so alone, i'm feeling nothing
And everything counts this time
Could it bring back the night?
Never free, never yours
Another night gone by
God's hands above my sight
I'm so alone, i'm feeling nothing
And everything counts this time
Could it bring back the night?
Never free, never yours
