I came here with darkness
You carried the rain
Here's a place for a friend
To be a tower of strength for a pain
The power to let it all go
Demands the power to let it all show
Once came down with darkness
To choke down the pain
It forever to be drifting in the rain

Now stay for my darkness
Stay for the rain
Stay for the friend
As a tower of strength in the pain
You see the power to let it all go
Demands the power to let it all show
Once came down with darkness
To choke down the pain
It forever to be drowning in the rain

Show me the nights of wonder
The nameless edges of the shores
We hoped to sleep on
Those we'll never see
Tell me of the empathy
We felt there once
When loading our guns
Leaving the ones behind
Those we'll never see
I darkened your sun
We will be gone

Won't you stay for my darkness
If I bear your rain
Here's still a place for a friend
To be a tower of strength in a pain
But the power to let it all go
Is the power to let it all show
To see death's a remedy
That brings here the darkness
And noble words for me
To set us free
