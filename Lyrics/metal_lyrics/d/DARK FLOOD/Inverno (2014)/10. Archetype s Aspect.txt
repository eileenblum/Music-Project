Is there a method to this madness
Would it make any difference at all
Just a moratorium before this aspect
Turns to nothing more than the frivolous cries
Of all those who couldn't follow the call

The same mirage as from afar
The hypocrites line up for all time
Garrulous horde marching on and in unison go
We're just a number on our way to the gallows of fall

Take this picture to the heart
Masquerade coming apart
Just as sparrows high and far
Freedom is just another farce
The human way of ignoring it all
Visceral thoughts leading the cattle home

Give this vision a somber sigh
Resolve the madness eye to eye
Give this vision a somber sigh
Take your time and realize
Itâs just another lie

Give this vision a somber sigh
Resolve the madness eye to eye
Take your time and realize
Theyâre just another lie

Contradictions and misconceptions
Shining as a beacon to dull the mind
An epoch to lead the blind
Into a mindless archetype
