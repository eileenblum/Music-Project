I tell you something
I tell you what
Pain is something
You'll never learn

Iâm starving artist suffering
While inspiration flows
My timeâs constantly ending
Like this is the time

And I tell you something
Tell you these words
The body remembers
As long as it hurts

When my chances are fading
Instance by instance
I join the dust
And so it becomes my lust

The winds have been fair to me
As long as I see
Pariahs will soon see the sun
On the edge of a dream

And I tell you something
Tell you these words
It's too late tonight
To drag me into the light
Iâll keep these credits to myself

And I tell you something
Tell you these words
The body remembers
As long as it hurts

Itâs not coincidental
A rebel dies young
Lay garlands on barricade
Cast the crown aside

I had a little credulous luck
But less faith than yesterday
My heartâs barely functional
But mouth spoken dry

And being innocent
For all the things I have done
I leave a cold streak behind me
Being ungrateful for what I became
Throw my body into sea
