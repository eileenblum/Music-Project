Today we forget something for good
The names of our children
Names on the sheets of paper

The night froze the water in furrows
Cold spell settled in for a while
Lingered here those early hours

Our future in family graves
Our past in lines of blood
Breathed the scent of strangers
Into these familiar rooms

They will mark this earth with ruins
And walk the way of five senses
Faces against the wind

They will measure the destination
From the distance
And the mountains height
More than they seem

Chambers into the mature soil
Berths in the felled woods
In the garden of our heritors
The foundation of future cities

We dug our own graves on time
Long before the Heaven heard
Our comfortless cries
