Misery has become a music
Silence has a professional tone
Yes I could play along
But it's a wordless song

It's woeful giant's sluggish walk
A hidden virtue
In a discontinuous talk

It's the end of the world
A glimpse of a light
Shows a few wounds I had
In defeated fight

Orphan spirits
And a love child's part
A wish of something good to come
In a little boy's eyes
A sudden smile
Of a random stranger

Sigh is a silent note
Yes I could play along
But I have hands of stone

A croon is a clear note
Yes I could sing along
But it's a wordless song

It's woeful giant's sluggish walk
A hidden virtue
In a discontinuous talk

It's the end of the world
A glimpse of a light
It's carved in mind
When something is said nice
