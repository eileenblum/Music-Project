Mornings from the east
This time infallibly
In the morning
In great understanding
Enlightened

There is no new beginning
No alternative end
There is no such meaning for this
There is no plan B

How quiet we are these evenings
It leaves your palms passive
And I survey through your runaway eyes
And your tones of goodbyes

And you find yourself dreaming
In the small hour minute
The fingers fumble the leavings
If thereâs something left to give

And you lay your body rest
On the side of the sea
Just to be able to escape
While Iâm still asleep

We look for another view
Mornings from the east
This time infallibly
In the morning
In great understanding
Enlightened
