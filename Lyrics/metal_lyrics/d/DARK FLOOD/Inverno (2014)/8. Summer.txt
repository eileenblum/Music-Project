I've been drinking oblivion
Forsaken my gods for sense of freedom
And then one morning' s tide
Another story flows to the ocean

The foliage has turned sheer
And the fragrances come strong
And the world of freedom
Closes the borders
For the shadow of the fall

And life goes in circles
What goes in circles
Never ends
And life goes on in circles
One moment poorer

You carry the branches
For the winter's rushing fast
The summer is still in your hair

Keep the fires up
For the days ahead
The summer is still in your hair

And then one morning's tide
You have turned the page to another

I've been drinking oblivion
Forsaken my gods for sense of freedom
And the ocean leaves me on the shore

And the world of freedom
Closes the borders
For the shadow of the fall
