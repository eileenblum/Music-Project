Keep it quiet forever
You have read a culprit's script
Now I run out of sight
With a face of a mercury

No other characteristics
Than the palms calloused in fists
The winter-chilled lips
That shared a few cold kisses

Keep it quiet forever
It's my childhood's only crime
Memories just stories
Images of Necropolis

And repentance has bent my posture
Like photos put to rest
Silhouette of an old man
Vital signs through my chest

Keep it quiet forever
It is my childhood's only crime
I didn't say
My mouth was shut
I underline

Whatever I did
I did it not
I wear a cross forever
Like a sinner hides in a lie
I underline

Like a sinner hides in a lie
The compassion will be measured
Put a heart once in their hands
They will chase you to the desert
