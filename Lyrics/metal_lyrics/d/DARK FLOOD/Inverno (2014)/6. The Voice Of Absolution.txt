Give me the apocalypse
For I have scorched the remaining ground
Or other grand emotions
For I have felt the all great loving

Move the world back to its threshold
For thereâs no stead for the future here
Give a judgement in the break of dawn
For I made a fortune in perishable dreams

Reveal the truths from the ends of the earth
For itâs too low to speak the commonplace
Take this guilt from the hearts of men
For no one confessed the violence

Choose me the side to believe in
For I have shouted at the borders for years
Let the rain come as waves of relief
For deserts born to where once was deep

Leave one seat free for an absentee
For the south of the river I rowed
Talk to me with the voice of absolution

How I long for an amnesty
For thereâs no value for my name to give
