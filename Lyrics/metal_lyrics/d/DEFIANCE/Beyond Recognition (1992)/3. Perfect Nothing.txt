[Music: Adams / Harrington]
[Lyrics: Esquivel]

Beyond recognition 
Release me from this grasp 
Another perfect nothing 
Memories of disrupt from my 
past 
It's a lie, I know not why 

A sin forever within 
The darkest side of my mind 
I feel it bring me  
Down to shelter 

Come again this life I feel 
I feel a pretense slowly taking 
over 
In time I seem to dwell and fade 
To a source beyond recognition 

I sleep through my nightmares 
Loneliness I must feel 
And when I cry for laughter 
My sorrows appeal 

So come back again this life I feel 
Numb against the pain that felt 
so real 
Time and time again I say I try to 
see 
Bring forth the light which is 
supposed to be 

So come again this life I feel 
Numb against the pain so real 

In desperate search of reason  
Curiosity rules my mind  
I'm drowning in confusion  
Perfect nothing I know not why 

Come again this life I feel 
Once again I feel a presence  
taking over 
In time I seem to dwell and fade 
To a source beyond recognition 

A sin forever within 
The darkest side of my mind 
I feel it bring me down to shelter 
It's a lie, I know not why
