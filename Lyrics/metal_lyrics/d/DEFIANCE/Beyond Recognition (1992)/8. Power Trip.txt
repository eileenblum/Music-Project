[Music: Adams / Harrington]
[Lyrics: Esquivel / Harrington / Kaufmann]

Freakshow in the streets 
Take over what they please 
One word we thought was safe 
Too late, the crime was made 

We the people, where do we 
stand 
Is there a way to resolve 
The power trip in this land 

[Chorus:]

The power trip in this land 
The power trip which we see 
The power trip that we fear  
The power trip...
Don't put a price on reality  
Can't put a price on poverty  
Don't put a pine on humanity  
You know I doubt your morality 
[Repeat chorus]

So why must we fight  
Scared for this life 
See the man deprived of freedom 
As he's stripped of his life 

So why must we die  
Snipped of his life 
See a man deprived of freedom 
As he begs for his life 

[Repeat chorus]

Don't put a price on reality  
Can't put a price on poverty  
Don't put a price on humanity  
You know I doubt your integrity 

Die with dignity
