[Music: Adams / Harrington / Kaufmann]
[Lyrics: Esquivel]

Into optic illusions 
Try to foresee what is to be 
made&amp;Chosen I may be the one 
Chosen I just might be the one to 
live 

I never heard a word they said 
But now I see the light shining 
Through eyes 
It leaves me pacified 

Illusions leave me blind 
Black is all I see 
Formed is a twisted image 
That was chosen for me 

I never questioned why 
I never saw a reason for suicide 
Or planned to take my life 

The will to live my mind sets free 
Into the vast of misery 
Tomorrow seems so far away 
Illusions of conspiracy 

My conscience is my only friend 
Learn to live my life in peace 
The chosen, I may be the one 
To live my life and be set free
