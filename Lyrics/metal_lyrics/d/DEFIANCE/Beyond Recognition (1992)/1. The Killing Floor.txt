[Music: Adams / Harrington / Esquivel]
[Lyrics: Esquivel]

They're mislead by authority 
And they're guinea pigs with  
dignity 
With everlasting memories 
Frozen thoughts and bloody 
dreams 

[Chorus:]

Mesmerized  
Souls left behind 
In the killing fields 
That leave you blind
In the war of conspiracy 
Young men fight for humanity 
When they're pawned off to the 
killing fields 
Smell the stench of misery 
[Repeat chorus]

Politicians send them off to war 
Deep within the front line 
The only man who's taught to 
survive 
As desperation freezes time 

Innocent lives are wrongly put at 
stake 
Negotiate the fields of blood 
Out in the cold they're taught to 
survive 
Salvation runs in the blood 

Off to the fields of blood 
Into the fields of blood 
Off to the fields of blood 
Die in the fields of blood 

They're mislead by authority 
Soldiers die with dignity 
Survivors live with memories 
Broken thoughts and broken  
dreams 

[Repeat chorus]
