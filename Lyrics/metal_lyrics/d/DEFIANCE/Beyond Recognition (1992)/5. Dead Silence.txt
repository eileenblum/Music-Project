[Music: Harrington / Esquivel / Adams]
[Lyrics: Esquivel]

You say one thing and do 
another 
Heard the same thing a thousand 
times 
Merry go round in reverse going 
nowhere 
We'll never know what's 
becoming of you 

[Chorus:]

Dead silence 
What now, who's got the last 
laugh 
Dead silence
You play your games, you've 
gone insane 
We never know what you want to 
be 
Day after day live live your life 
Wishing you were just like me 
Dead silence 
What now, who's got the last 
laugh 
Dead silence 

You think you see but 
You can't see what's in my mind 
Time turns around you still 
Can't seem to realize 

Sometimes I feel no sorrow 
Sometimes I feel no pain 

Say what you will, my last laugh 
Say what you will while I laugh  
[X2]

Time goes by but you never 
change 
You're always hearing the same 
thing day after day 
In your mind still you wish to be 
Image of hatred, trying to be like 
me 
Sometimes I feel no sorrow 
Sometimes I feel no pain 
You live your life for tomorrow 
Yeah that's right, I live mine for 
today... 

[Repeat first verse, chorus, second verse]

Who's got the last laugh INSIDE
