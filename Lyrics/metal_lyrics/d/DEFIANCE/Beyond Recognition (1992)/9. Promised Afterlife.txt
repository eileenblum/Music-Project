[Music: Adams / Harrington / Vander Ende]
[Lyrics: Esquivel]

This is the real thing 
There's no reality 
Is there a promised afterlife to seek 

Wandering endlessly 
Drift on through the time 
If you're heading for disaster 
You're bound to see the light 

Is there a new way 
To live and die 
Is there a future or afterlife 
I've tried to see through 
But to die is to die 

I've tried to see through times 
The promised afterlife 
I've tried to see through times 
The promised afterlife [X2]

[Repeat first verse]

Wandering endlessly  
Drift on through the time 
If the end is to be over 
Should we pray to see the light 

So try to see through time 
See my eyes 
There is no promised afterlife [X2]

Is there a new way 
To live and die 
Is there a future or afterlife 
I've tried to see through 
But to die is to die
