[Music: Harrington / Adams / Vander Ende]
[Lyrics: Esquivel / Harrington / Vander Ende / Kaufmann]

Inside looking out 
Can you believe what you see 
The unpleasant sight 
For a place with so much greed 
Infectious destiny 
I find it hard to make my stand 

Made to reality - conformed 
society 

[Chorus:]

Inside looking out  
Seems so never ending 
Inside looking out  
Seems so never ending

Inside looking out 
What can you see 
Beyond without doubt - What to 
believe 
What to believe 
When all reality lost its mind 
What to conceive 
Dealing with the people when the 
problems 

Don't fade away 
And you find yourself dreaming 
for... 
Dreaming for another day 

Inside looking out 
Can you believe what you see 
The unpleasant sight 
For a place with so much greed 
Infectious destiny 
I find it hard to make my stand 

I see no way out 

[Repeat chorus]
