[Music: Harrington / Vander Ende / Adams]
[Lyrics: Esquivel]

Day after day 
I turn the page another suicide 
Page after page 
Another death in the back of my 
mind 
Why must it be this way at all 
Why can't we live our lives 
I'd hate to be one of the many 
No compromise 

[Chorus:]

Placed for all to see 
Who used to be  
Family's left with nothing 
But a faint memory
Day after day 
I turn the page another child dies 
Sin after sin 
Another reason for a human 
sacrifice 
Why must it be that way at all 
Why can't we live our Iives 
I'd hate to be one of the many 
No compromise 
[Repeat chorus]

[Bridge:]
See my eves I don't find time 
To look at the price we pay  
Easy come and easy go 
Look at the life time cycle 
Yeah, the people time forgot 

[Repeat first verse, chorus]

You, you know the choice you 
make 
Who, who's next in line to pay 

[Chorus:]

Who used to be  
Now a faint memory 
You see it on TV 
The people pass away 
Family's left with nothing  
But a faint memory
