[Music: Harrington / Vander Ende]
[Lyrics: Esquivel]

Step back and listen to what I say 
Don't worry, put your trust in me 
What to believe when your 
head's overfilled with these lies 
The naked truth separates the  
people lost in time 

[Chorus:]

As if 
There's nothing to do 
Reach back  
And pull your past through
Step back and listen to what I say 
[Repeat chorus]

What to believe when your  
head's overfilled with these lies 
The naked truth separates the  
people lost in time 

I see the future. I see your life 
I see you live your life on 
borrowed time 
You live for your own morals 
I do what I like 'cause this is my 
life 

I do as I please 
With no sacrifice 
Guess what ? Step back 

[Repeat first verse, chorus]

Step back and listen to what I say  
Step back
