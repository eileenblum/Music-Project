What is it called
When you can't sleep at night?
The shadows on the wall
Gives you such a fright
Wish you had a switch
To turn off the light in your head
Could it be that what
Makes you lie awake in your bad?

What will you do 
To make yourself fall asleep? 
Well - have you ever tried 
To count some sheep? 
Toss and turn
You're all tied up in your sheets
Now Freddy's face
Is the one you'll finally meet

Insomnia
You can't sleep at night insomnia
Gives you such a fright
Insomnia
Insomnia

What is it called
When you can't sleep at night?
The shadows on the walls
Gives you such a fright?
Wish you had a switch
To turn off the light in your head
Now could it be that what
What makes you lie awake in your bad?
As you lie awake in bed

Insomnia
You can't sleep at night insomnia
Gives you such a fright
Insomnia
Insomnia

You can't sleep at night!
