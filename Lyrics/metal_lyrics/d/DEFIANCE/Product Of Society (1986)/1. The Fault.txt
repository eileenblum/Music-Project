Danger lingers in the air
Tonight - don't feel right
Something tells you to beware
Your head hits the wall
The floor drops beneath your feet
In a rage of panic
Buildings crumbling to the street

Earthquake... Earthquake
Screams fill the air
Earthquake... Earthquake

Your head hits the wall
The floor drops beneath your feet
In a rage of panic
People running thru the street

Earthquake... Earthquake
Where do you run to now?
Earthquake... Earthquake

Glass falling from the sky
Cuts you like a knife
Desperation fills the air
Shelter is their only care
Didn't hear it's silent plea
Didn't take it's warning
As the city starts to slip
Deep into the sea... deep into the sea

Danger lingers in the air 
Tonight don't feel right 
Something tells you to beware

Earthquake... Earthquake

Your head hits the wall
The floor drops beneath your feet
In a rage of panic
People dying in the street

You better catch a plane or die 
You better catch that plane or die
