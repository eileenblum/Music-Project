Walking lost in the snow 
Can't decide which way to go 
Feel the chill take control 
As the avalanche starts to flow 
See your life before your eyes
No one there to hear your cries
Feel the ground start to shake 
As you lose all your fate

Try to scream
Convince yourself it is just a dream 
Blood flows slow
I tell you that there is no death more slow

Hypothermia in your brain 
As you panic you go insane 
Blood's pumping very slow 
'Cause you fight, the deeper you go 
Life you know starts to slip 
As you lose reality's grip 
Take a breath and make it last 
As your dreaming of your past

Try to scream
Convince yourself it is just a dream 
Blood flows slow
I tell you that there is no death more slow

Try to move, have no power 
It's getting colder by the hour 
Wishing you were in your bed 
There's no feeling in your head 
Death you meet face to face 
Hypothermia takes it's place 
Better kiss your life goodbye 
Tears are freezing as you cry

Try to scream
Convince yourself it is just a dream 
Blood flows slow
I tell you that there is no death more slow

Froze to death 
For all to see 
Souls now trapped 
Never to be free

Walking lost in the snow 
Can't decide which way to go 
Feel the chill take control 
As the avalanche starts to flow 
See your life before your eyes
No one there to hear your cries
Feel the ground start to shake 
As you lose all your fate

Try to scream
Convince yourself it is just a dream 
Blood flows slow
I tell you that there is no death more slow

Tell you that there is no death more slow...
