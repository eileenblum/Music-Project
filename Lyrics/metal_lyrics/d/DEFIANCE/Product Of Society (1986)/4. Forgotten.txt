Forgotten, men who fought for shit 
Went through hell, lived in pain
While our leaders just sit there stupid
Worthless fucking war
All it did for the world
Is to shut a lot of doors

Was it right for men to fight? 
And to risk all their lives... 
Left behind enemy lines 
Trapped behind
Cut the crap, bring them back 
Wake up from your fucking nap 
You know they're out there 
But you don't care

Jesus, ain't this a nice place
You fight for it
Then you come home
And it spits in your face
Forgetting that you had no choice
To the clowns that pulled the strings
Opinions you could not voice

Was it right for men to fight? 
And to risk all their lives... 
Left behind enemy lines 
Trapped behind
Cut the crap, bring them back 
Wake up from your fucking nap 
You know they're out there 
But you don't care

Politics the chains that hold them down
At the rate that we've going
They are never to be found
So let's quit sitting on our thumbs
Get some balls, take control
And get the job done

I'm so sick of hearing lies
While as they sit helpless and die
Is it all that much to ask
To get off your ass and bring them back
To bring them back

Aren't you sick of hearing all the lies?
Aren't you sick of hearing all the lies?
All of their lies 

Bring 'em back!
