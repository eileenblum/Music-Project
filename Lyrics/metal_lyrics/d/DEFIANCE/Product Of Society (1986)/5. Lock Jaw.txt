Have you ever felt a puncture thru the skin 
From a piece of metal that is rusty, dull and thin? 
And the pain it brings you as it plunges deep within 
Your tears have not yet started, but soon they will begin

I don't have to warn you about the feelings it will bring
But when you step down on it your ears will start to ring
So always keep one eye looking on the ground 
You will see there's danger all around 
On the ground, you'll be screaming 
In your veins, the poison's seeping 
Lockjaw's coming, feel it creeping 
Finally realize that you're bleeding

You feel the lockjaw 
Feel the lockjaw 
Can you feel the lockjaw? 
Feel the lockjaw

Now you're not feeling well 'cause lockjaw it's a living hell
Can you fight the pain within as it cuts up in your skin

You feel the lockjaw 
Feel the lockjaw 
Can you feel the lockjaw? 
Feel the lockjaw

Didn't see it lying there, with it's point up in the air 
Can you bear to pull it out, take the pain with a shout
For the dangers that lurk above the ground

Now you're not feeling well 'cause lockjaw it's a living hell
Can you fight the pain within as it's stuck up in your skin

You feel the lockjaw 
Feel the lockjaw 
Can you feel the lockjaw? 
Feel the lockjaw
