Lost mind looking for something 
To fill that empty space 
Glaring at you so coldly 
But yet he has no face 
Driven to mindless murder 
By a world that's so cold 
Product of our society 
Packaged and ready to be sold

Subconsciously sadistic
To live he has to maim
His bloodsheds will continue
As long as the world's there to blame!

He awakens every single night 
With a burning urge he needs to fill 
Nothing to suppress the need 
Nothing that will give him such a thrill 
So every night he'll lose all grip 
Guess he has no will 
Destroying life's his destiny 
He was born to kill

It's true you can't deny it
We live in a peaceless place
Here he comes stand still and ready
Or he'll rip off your face

Subconsciously sadistic
To live he has to maim
His bloodsheds will continue
As long as the world's there to blame!

So every night he'll lose all grip 
Guess he has no will 
Destroying life's his destiny
He was born to kill

To kill!!!
