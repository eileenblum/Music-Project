My life seemed so perfect 
Until that one night 
When the anger grew inside me 
And the moon lost its light

Now I find myself with 
An uncontrollable need 
To kill my victim slowly 
So I can hear her plea

Deadly intentions
Is all my mind cries out
Deadly intentions
Wanting to kill without a doubt

By some stroke of luck 
I escaped possession 
God above convinced me 
That it was only a lesson 
Always to be second 
And waiting to be nexted 
I was never good enough 
For her love and her sex

Deadly intentions
Is all my mind cries out
Deadly intentions
Wanting to kill without a doubt

Now that you will listen 
Look deep into my eyes 
I've been drained of feeling 
And I'll tell you why 
I have gave her flowers 
And all I could afford 
Only to discover 
She's just a fucking whore

Deadly intentions
Is all my mind cries out
Deadly intentions
Wanting to kill without a doubt

Dare to play the game 
Watch her plan unfold 
She knows you will give up 
Your body and your soul 
You give up all your morals 
Your conscience and your heart 
Then you will be trapped 
'Till death do us part
