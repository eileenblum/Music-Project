Take a look into the future 
See a time that will exist 
But you can't seem to find out 
When it really is 
There's talk about a legend 
It rides across the land 
They call it death machine 
He rules with metal hand

Yes, he'll ride 
To run you down 
Silently
Without a sound
Only way to live safe
Was to never leave a trace

On his bike
A death machine
Through the barren waste
All he's really looking for
Is forgotten place
'Cause he rides through the night
It chills him to the bone
Just one thing he wants to find
Is some piece of mind

Hiding under ground 
Fearing that you'll be found 
Take your life at hand 
As he storms the land

Yes, he'll ride to run you down 
Silently
Without a sound
Only way to live safe
Was to never leave a trace

On his bike
A death machine
Through the barren waste
All he's really looking for
Is forgotten place
'Cause he rides through the night
It chills him to the bone
Just one thing he wants to find
Is some piece of mind
