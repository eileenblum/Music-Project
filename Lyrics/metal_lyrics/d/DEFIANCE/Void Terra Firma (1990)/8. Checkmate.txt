The kings and queens send their pawns off to war 
An unfair law upheld in the years before 
They take a life from a child and their dreams 
Imagine people never even stop to think 

Back many years - Checkmate 
They believe to kill - Checkmate 
There was no law - Checkmate 
They killed at will - Checkmate 
Medieval torture - Checkmate 
Now begins - Checkmate 
Man to follow - Checkmate 
Many to hang - Checkmate 
Checkmate - Checkmate 

People die still, some at their youth 
No one knows why 'cause there never is no truth 
Romans believe to send their children off to war 
Retaliation, continuation of the war 

Retaliation of the war 

Some people die still, some still at their youth 
No one knows why, there is no truth 
Romans believe to send their children off to war 
Retaliation, continuation of the war 

Checkmate !....... 

The kings and queens send their pawns off to war 
An unfair law upheld in the years before 
To take the life from a child and their dreams 
Imagine people never even stop to think
