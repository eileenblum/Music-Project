Thousands of the unknown who have died 
Millions of the widows still wonder why  
The children they've left behind  
Their minds now shot to waste  
Innocent victim's now a widow 

Mixed emotions  
The child's depression 
What is the answer ? 
To the questions 
The widow wants to know why 

Day to day never knowing why  
Not knowing who's to blame  
In search of reason  
Don't know what to say  
Don't know who's to blame 

Mixed emotions within  
The shattered widow's mind 
Left with scars forever 

Mixed emotions  
The child's depression 
What is the answer ? 
To the questions 
The widow wants to know why 

Confession in the darkness of life 

Thousands of the unknown who have died 
Millions of the widows 

Mixed emotions 
The child's depression  
What is the answer ?  
To the questions  
To the questions ...
