Look into his eyes 
Never look again 
So much to hide 
For fear that he has sinned 

He's lost all self control 
In his life he has no goal 
He feels he needs no reason at all 
The mutilation of his soul 

Left in a trance - confused 
Wondering what is right or wrong  
Nothing left but life - to lose  
Faithful to his God for so long 

Deception of faith 
Fear inside eyes - screams but no reply 
Deception of faith 
World of misery - beyond insanity 

Witness his world decay 
Thousands of people dying everyday 
All hope for peace is lost 
He'll pay the price at any lethal cost 

Deception of faith 
Fear inside eyes - screams but no reply 
Deception of faith 
World of misery - beyond insanity 

In this world 
Hidden lies that they hiding from us 
Cause for corruption 
Distant signs from heaven above 

Confessions, Deception
