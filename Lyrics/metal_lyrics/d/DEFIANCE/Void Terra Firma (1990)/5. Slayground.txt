Slayground - meets you ! 

Born full of innocence, right from day one 
Infancy our future, from violence they run 
Caused by sickness that diseases this world 
Into the open where it must be hurled 
You know what I'm saying ? 

So what Mr. Morals, if you think there's a cure 
It sure won't be helping that raped little girl 
She now lives her life through intense mental pain 
While you're trying to fix your better-off-dead brain 
So what Mr. Morals 

Waiting in confinement 
You know you'll pay the cost 
Now tell me what do you know 
Now that their life is lost 

Waiting for answers 

Slayground - meets you ! 

So what do you say Mr. Morals ?
