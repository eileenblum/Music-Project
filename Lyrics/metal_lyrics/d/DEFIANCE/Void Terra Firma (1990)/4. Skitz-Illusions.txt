Trapped inside four walls of fear 
Distant signs of pain growing near 
Love the torture, love the pain  
Endless torture driving you insane 

Take the time to look 
Look into the future of mankind 
See the lives that it took 
Set to rest, see illusions of life 

Illusions, disillusions of life 
Never heard your cries - disillusions of life 
Illusions, disillusions of life 
Never heard your cries - disillusions of life 

See yourself, see illusions 
Which appear in the mirror 
Only time can tell you 
What to expect of your future growing near 

Take the time to see 
Take the time to conceive this world 
Don't be confined of what will be  
Or trapped inside four walls of fear 

Illusions, disillusions of life 
Never heard your cries - disillusions of life 
Illusions, disillusions of life 
Never heard your cries - disillusions of life 

Can you see tomorrow ? 
Does your future tell you lies ? 
Seeing signs of sorrow 
Deep within, no one hears your cries 

Trapped inside  

Silent Cries
