Shattered minds of weak decrepit souls 
Distant signs of dark deception grows 
Brought up to the shining of the light 
Eternal forces corrupt your mind 

Mislead from birth to death 
Empty feelings of insanity is known 
Living everyday in fear 
The pain that's growing near 
Is there a way for you to see 
Why you live in a fantasy 

You live your life in confusion 
You don't know how to set your mind free 
You've learned to forget and let them be 
That's why you live in misery 

You live your life in confusion 
You don't know how to set your mind free 
You've learned to forget and let them be 
Insanity ! 

Shattered minds of weak decrepit souls 
Distant signs of dark deception grows 
Brought out to the shining of the light 
Return to the comfort of the night 

Slowly dying in the freezing cold 
Disbelieve of the warnings you were told
