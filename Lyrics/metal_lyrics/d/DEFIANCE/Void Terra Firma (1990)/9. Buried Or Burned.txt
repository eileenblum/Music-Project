Wasted life now gone to hell 
Perfect child was left to dwell 
Destined to fight, destined to kill 
Infant at birth was born to kill 

Which will it be ?  
Which will be his prey ? 
Who will be the first ? 
The first to die 

Stalking on his victim 
Killing what he pleases 
Strive in starvation 
Prey on survival's needs 
Born to kill 

Prodigal life that went to hell 
Torment the victims left to dwell 
Left to die with no remorse 
Born to kill - leave a beautiful corpse 

Punish all those victims 
Laughing as they die 
Putrid smell of agony 
Hear the victims cry 

Eyes that slowly open 
Blood red to seal your fate 
Await upcoming terror 
Marked red to seal your fate 

Punish all those victims 
Laughing at them as they die 
Putrid smell of agony 
Hear the victims cry 

Wasted life now gone to hell 
Perfect child was left to dwell 
Destined to fight, destined to kill 
Infant at birth was born to kill 

Prodigal child gone to hell 
Tormented victims left to dwell 
Left to die with no remorse 
Born to kill - leave a beautiful corpse
