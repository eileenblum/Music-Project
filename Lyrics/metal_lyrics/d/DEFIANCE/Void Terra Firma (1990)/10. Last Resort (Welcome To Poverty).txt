Welcome to lower existence 
Prey on the innocent 
Welcome to the rude life 
Notice life where time stands still 
See the other side of life 
Where the poverty shows their wealth 

When crime means dying 
Placed to steal just to survive 
Pillage and raping 
Smell the stench of the rich gone poor 

They wait for an answer 
One day they know they're gonna pay 
They've lost all their pride 
They've lost their mind in a mental phase 

A time will come and you will see 
Approach the gutters of poverty 
Stench of poor left to die 
Smell the brains of a lunatic's mind 

Welcome to lower existence 
Prey on the innocent 
Welcome to the new life 
Gaze the streets 
See the other side of life 
Notice where time stands still 
Where the poverty shows their wealth 

When crime means dying 
Smell the stench of the rich gone poor 
Pillage and raping 
Placed to steal just to survive
