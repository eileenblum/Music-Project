Lost, out of control 
Nowhere to run - terra firma ! 
Losing all time of living in this world 
No chance, gone insane 
We're living in a dead man's world 

Time, seems to fade away 
Further everyday - terra firma ! 
Losing all time of living in this world 
No chance, gone insane 
We're living in a dead man's world 

Eyes to eyes 
In a battle of lost control 
Lead our world 
Knowing that the bomb is going to blow 
Feel the world come to mend 
Images - ill repent - violent remedy 
Feel the world come to end 
Violent remedy ! 

Mass confusion 

Dying are the people that lost their soul 
Dying for the people of minds of stone 
They rot - they rot 
Dying are the people that lost their soul - the blood 
Dying for the people of minds of stone - the blood 

Feel the world come to mend 
Images - ill repent - violent remedy 
Feel the world come to end  
Violent remedy ! 

Eyes to eyes 
In a battle of lost control 
Lead our world 
Knowing that the bomb is going to blow 

Lost, out of control 
Nowhere to run - terra firma ! 
Losing all time of living in this world 
No chance, gone insane
