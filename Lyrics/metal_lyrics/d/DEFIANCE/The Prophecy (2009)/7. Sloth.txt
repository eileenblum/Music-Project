SLOTH... Good for nothing
SLOTH... Neglectful kind
SLOTH... Lazy bastard
SLOTH... Sluggish mind
Ignorance is yours
Hold on to it tight
Fixed to the floor
Won't even try
One deadly sin
The lunatic within
Flesh eternally consumed
Punishment so profound
Wilful denial of self
Never making ground
Thrown to a pit of snakes
Hells wrath of God
Evil in its full effect
Where we all belong
SLOTH... Good for nothing
SLOTH... Neglectful kind
SLOTH... Lazy bastard
With a Sluggish mind
Disengaged yourself
From the lunatic masses
Good in all defiance now
Reduced to only ashes

Disengaged yourself
From the lunatic masses
What is met by evil
An endless wasteland
Consent of the will
The sin of man
We are thrown to a pit of snakes
Hells wrath of God
Evil in its full effect
Where we belong
Where we belong
Shades of the unfortunate
Sin a summons to life
Calls an immediacy
To do or die
Ignorance is yours
Ignorance is mine
Blind by all the prophecy
You blind waste of life
SLOTH... Good for nothing
SLOTH... Neglectful kind
SLOTH... Lazy bastard
With a Sluggish mind
SLOTH... Good for nothing
SLOTH... Neglectful kind
SLOTH... Lazy bastard
SLOTH... Waste of life
Waste of life, waste of life, waste of life
SLOTH
