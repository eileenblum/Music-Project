Overcome the misery these wall are full of pride
Fire the shot for which the stand
Can't heat these wounds inside
Battered and bruised within
Nothing left to lose
Help defend the war
Divided by the truth

Mental - anguish - wounded - banged up
Mental - anguish - wounded
Divided by the truth

Desperate to survive this cold and awful place
Live in anguish war forever shadows memories
Heal my eyes from all I've seen
Flesh without half name
Mental - anguish - wounded - banged up
Mental - anguish - wounded
Divided by the truth

Mental - anguish - wounded - banged up
Mental - anguish - wounded
Nothing to lose
Heal my eyes from all I've seen
Flesh without half name
Heal my eyes from all I've seen
Flesh without half name
Mental - anguish - wounded - banged up
Mental - anguish - wounded
Desperate to survive
