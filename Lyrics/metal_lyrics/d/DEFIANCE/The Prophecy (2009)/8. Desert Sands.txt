Now I'm in future world
In the cruel divide
Raging on a bed of hate
Scorching all mankind
Now upon society
Nowhere for a cure
Silence of authority
For the revoizing core
A new life is born
A new life is lost
Guilty within no matter the cost
Living to die
Yet living in fear
For love of a god that never appears
Walking through the desert night
Killing everything in sight
With a blade kill the night
Blessed by eternal light
Burn upon the desert sky
Live for the gods
Live for the gods
Living a sin no matter the cost
Living to die
Living in sin
For love of a god who never appears
What is the price
The loss of life
Feel like the throw
While your end is strife
While your land while you fail
Keep inside these frozen thoughts
Buried inside be not afraid
Lord I'm not afraid of god

Now I'm in future world
In the cruel divide
Raging on a bed of hate
Scorching all mankind
