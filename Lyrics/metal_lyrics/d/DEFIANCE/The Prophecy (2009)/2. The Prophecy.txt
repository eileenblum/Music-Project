The end of time we all know
Believe that the words we were told
Shifting of ages
In all gods creation
Judgment day will soon come
The end of time
The great divide
Buy your swords
Destroy mankind
How will i know
The end the cycle of evolution
Time as we know
The end of all our own creation

The march of saints
The sacrifice
The prophecy or a book of lies
The march of saints
The sacrifice
The prophecy or a book of lies

The end of time
The great divide
The bio storm
Destroy mankind
The end of time as we know
Believe that the words we were told
Shifting of ages
In all gods creation
Judgment day will soon come
How will i know
The end the cycle of evolution
Time as we know
The end of all our own creation
