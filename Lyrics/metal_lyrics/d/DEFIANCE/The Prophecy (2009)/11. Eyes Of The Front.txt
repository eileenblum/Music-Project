Eyes, woke up alive
Losing our minds
Behind the walls of deception
We all watch when they fall
Broadcast their goal
Strengthen upon you
Deceiving that's no more in you
We knew the Holy War
They're all brainwashing you.
They live with bloody hands
The blood upon the rebels filled
With all the life that's lost.
For life ability
The red, the white, the truth
The rebel cause
Force fed lies
Corrupt in time
The innocent
The desperate cry
Destroy the things that live
The fire will fill the sky
Relieve it for the age to all the
Things that could deny
The end is drawing near
Force fed lies
Corrupt in time
The innocent
Beyond the desperate cry
Into the war
The lasting tour
The memory
Forever more

We knew the Holy War

They live with bloody hands
The blood upon the rebels filled

Force fed lies
Corrupt in time
The innocent
Beyond the desperate cry
Into the war
The lasting tour
The memory
Eyes, woke up alive
Losing our minds
Beyond the walls of deception
We all, watch when they fall
Broadcast their goal
Strengthen upon you
Deceiving that's no more in you
