Walk away the bastard son
Left alone beside his gun
Watch the blood runs through his veins
A generation without a face
The end of the age of silence
Fate of a newborn sin
Lineage of Defiance
Refusing to lie again
Man of hope and sorrow
Born to live in pain
Product of tomorrow
No matter of time to help
He made the wall of shame
Too young to know a big mistake
He won't forgive what he can't forget
Killed his victims within a breath
The end of the age of silence
Fate of a newborn sin
Lineage of Defiance
Refusing to lie again
Man of hope and sorrow
Born to live in pain
Product of tomorrow
No matter of time to help

All alone this bastard son
Left to die besides his gun
Nothing left to call his own
Left to die all alone
Man of hope and sorrow
Born to live in pain
Product of tomorrow
Product of today
End of the age of silence
End of a newborn day
Limeage of Defiance
Refusing to lie again
Again
Again
Again
