Robbing the down
Changing the endless cycles of life
Breaking the mold
Never ending sacrifice
New life appears
Without hope &amp; without eyes
Living in fear
Welcome to your paradise
Living in fear
Apocalypse
The Asthmaphere
They topple all our leaders
Prophets of the damned
Knowing the gravity here for the world for which they stand
This new wave of violence
The new phase of rage
The blood of the silent prophecy that still remains
Living in fear
The end is near
Apocalypse
The Asthmaphere

Robbing the down
Changing the ending cycles of life
Breaking the mold
Never ending sacrifice
New life appears
Without hope and without eyes
Living in fear
Welcome to your paradise
