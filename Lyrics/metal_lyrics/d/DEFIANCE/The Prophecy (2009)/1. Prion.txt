Whats happening to me can't seem to find my feet
Not feeling like myself can't seem to fall asleep
Too much inside my head, too much won't leave me alone
There is a rogue inside my thoughts, so confusing words unknown
Turned up side down feeling all the sickening
Consuming all the flesh of life's eternity
Diseased newborn society
New world bitter world
Will never last
Born of cannibal's
Funeral rituals
Consuming mans brain
Turning them mad
Eat the meat of a mad cow
Looking to a mass funeral for everyone right now
Diseased conform new society
New world funeral
My own worst enemy
Brain rots inside my head calling me within
My brain is wasted away in a black dark full of sin
My thoughts not my own tear this all away
Now death settles in crumbling the walls
Inside my brain
Within
Slowly rots
Within

Born of cannibal's
Funeral rituals
Consuming mans brain
Turning them mad
Eat the meat of a mad cow
Looking to a mass
Funeral for everyone right now

This prion turning
My body my enemy
My mind is not my own
Now my enemy
Throw it all away
New society

Born of cannibal's
Funeral rituals
