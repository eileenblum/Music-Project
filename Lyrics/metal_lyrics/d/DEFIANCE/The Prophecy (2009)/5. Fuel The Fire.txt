Wake to another chapter of life
The struggle coming to you
Never regret a new day of hope
The shadows of death coming through
Shadows of sorrow wickedly
This nightmare is coming true
With a vengeance
A look in the eye
Showing no mercy
A furious tide
Fuel the fire within
Fuel the fire within
The struggle within
Fuel the fire within
Fuel the fire within

Becoming a victim without a fight
Fear on you again
Stripping your faith
By the end of the blade
Survival a shallow grave
With a vengeance
A look in the eye
Showing no mercy
A furious tide
Fuel the fire within
Fuel the fire within
The struggle within
Fuel the fire within
Fuel the fire within

Fuel the fire within
Fuel the fire within
The struggle within
Fuel the fire within
Fuel the fire within
Wake up a new day of life
The struggle is close to an end
Every friendship a new day of hope
Sunsets a shadow descends
We go into the pit to put down a fight
The nightmare is coming all true
Waiting for death  just look in the eyes
Showing no mercy with you
