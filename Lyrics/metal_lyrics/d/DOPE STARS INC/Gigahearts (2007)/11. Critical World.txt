Television always rule
ordinary people view.
Calibrating what we see.
Telling strictly what we need.
Glaciers slowly melting down.
Thunders razing to the ground
and the statesmen just stand watching
'till we get to the end.

It's a critical world yeah
and everbody knows
it's a critical world yeah
but none wants to say
it's a critical world yeah
and everbody knows
it's a critical world
running to the end Yeah!

Information always rule.
Automatic people mood.
Telling stories to mislead.
Satisfying the public needs.
Territories slowly drown
cause of natural crackdown
and the statesmen just stand watching
'till we get to the end.

It's a critical world yeah
and everbody knows
it's a critical world yeah
but none wants to say
it's a critical world yeah
and everbody knows
it's a critical world
running to the end Yeah!

It's a critical world yeah
and everbody knows
it's a critical world yeah
but none wants to say
it's a critical world yeah
and everbody knows
it's a critical world
running to the end Yeah!
