In a different world I'd know what is really right to do.
To keep far away all the shit that is fucking up my mood.
Pushing down my throat the solution for my brain abuse.
In a dirty world where emotions got a price for you.

Technologic age spreading trough my veins.
Chemical galore of fake emotions and despair.
Technologic age. Digital cocaine.
Have you ever wondered to find evil right in a pill.

Everytime I hope to forget what I am and what I've been.
But it's fucking late to come back to the times I felt for real.
Pushing down my throat a shit load of synthesized pills.
In a greedy world where you have to pay to joy and feel.

Technologic age spreading trough my veins.
Chemical galore of fake emotions and despair.
Technologic age. Digital cocaine.
Have you ever wondered to find evil right in a pill.

Technologic age spreading trough my veins.
Chemical galore of fake emotions and despair.
Technologic age. Digital cocaine.
