I'm tired to serve.
I'm tired to please.
I'm tired to yell to take some breath.

Oh I just found a way to kill my rage.
I'm very proud, according to myself,
to throw it out. With violence it smash
down to the ground and purify my head.

I'm tired to serve.
I'm tired to please.
I'm tired to yell to take some breath.
Fucking dumb asshole.
You're not my lord.
I'm not your lad.
Just bang your head.

Oh I just found a way to keep my rage,
contained down and ready to be spread,
against a crowd of people I can't stand.
Hey bunch of clowns it's time to take revenge.

I'm tired to serve.
I'm tired to please.
I'm tired to yell to take some breath.
Fucking dumb asshole.
You're not my lord.
I'm not your lad.
Just bang your head.

I can't resist to own this hate anymore
and keep this anger play with me countless games.
I want to burn in hell where all this anger dwells
and bring myself away from here

I'm tired to serve.
I'm tired to please.
I'm tired to yell to take some breath.
Fucking dumb asshole.
You're not my lord.
I'm not your lad.
Just bang your head.

Just bang your head.
Just bang your head.
Just bang your head.
Just bang your head.
