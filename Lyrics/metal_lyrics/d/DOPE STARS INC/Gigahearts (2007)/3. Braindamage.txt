Another year without a light to see
Without a lack of chemicals for me
They always track what I do, what I see
There is no chance for me to get a thrill

Another year without a light to see
Without a lack of chemicals for me
They always track what I do, what I see
There is no chance for me to get a thrill
Go!

The corporation always move the wires of these debates
Eradicating all they want to trash away your brain

Prison of thoughts. How should I feel now?
Caged inside a jail for years
It's just a way to take control and just shatter
To make a martyr out of me
Prison of thoughts. Why don't you steal now
Everything stored inside of me?
'Cause I'm so drained and I can feel my brain damaged
By your control incorporated
By your control incorporated

One other dream, the last resort for me
One other spell to get me out of here
My video trap that keeps my memories
Until the end will get inside of me

Prison of thoughts. How should I feel now?
Caged inside a jail for years
It's just a way to take control and just shatter
To make a martyr out of me
Prison of thoughts. Why don't you steal now
Everything stored inside of me?
'Cause I'm so drained and I can feel my brain damaged
By your control incorporated.
By your control incorporated.
