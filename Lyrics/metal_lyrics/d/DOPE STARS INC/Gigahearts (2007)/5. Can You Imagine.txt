Thousands of stars surround this world and
I always wonder where the border
gets to the end.
Thousands of questions in my head.
How many times you have been standing
in front of millions lights still flashing
light years away?
Down to the hole of time and space.

How can you tell where all this world end
Matter and form or just disorder
filling this space.
Multi dimensional arrays
Just take a trip and try to imagine
how many stars that now keep flashing
vanished away.
Down to the universe embrace.

Can you imagine worlds
so many miles away from here?
How many different words
and how many ways to feel the same.
Can you imagine worlds
so many miles away from here?
But I would bet for sure
the meaning of love is still, is still the same.
