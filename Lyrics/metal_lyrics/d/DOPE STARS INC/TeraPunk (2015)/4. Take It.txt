i don't feel any hope
i can't take anymore
Never feel like before
Never hope i could grow
i will never forget to choose again
i will never regret to be myself

so i will take and make it
i'm back like before
and i will never let to lose my way
i do what i want

i will just take it and get it
this way like before
and i will never let my fingers stop
i do what i want

i never found a new
temptation for a cure
but now i have to choose
and fall away from rules
the only thing i want
is right or maybe is wrong
when what is meant for you
has never been so sure

i never felt like i know it
