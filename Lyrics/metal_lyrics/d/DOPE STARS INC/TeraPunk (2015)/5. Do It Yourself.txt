I can record myself
i can rewind myself
i can just cut myself
and listen all again
you can just feel yourself
your home is your own cell
you need nobody else to do what you want
so why don't you do it yourself
why don't you do it yourself
why don't you do it yourself
why don't you do it do it yourself

the world has changed and just everybody knows
don't be afraid don't be afraid
there's nothing bad at all
you are just free to do whatever that you want
so why don't you do it yourself
why don't you do it yourself
why don't you do it yourself
why don't you do it do it yourself

I can record myself
i can remix myself
i can broadcast myself
and spin around the world yeah
I can just be myself
at home in my own cell
I need nobody else to do what I want
so why don't you do it yourself
why don't you do it yourself
why don't you do it yourself
why don't you do it do it yourself
