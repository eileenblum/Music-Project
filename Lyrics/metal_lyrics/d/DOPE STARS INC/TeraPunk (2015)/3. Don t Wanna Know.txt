it is not about to get to know what is real
it is not about to get to know what is good
it is not about to keep your job and your fear
it is not about a bunch of pricks of the gov

this is not the world to pay to your faults
this is not the world to pay for your faults anymore

don't wanna know what is hard to know
i wanna fill my time of empty jokes
i wanna keep inside a petty soul
It is the last way to rest i hope

don't wanna know what is hard to know
i wanna live in a religious fault
i wanna feed my mind of silly hope

it is not about to get to know what is clear
it is not about to get to know what is old
it is not about to keep your life in prison
it is not about to keep your mind overload

this is not the time you pay for your faults
this is not the time you pay for your faults anymore

don't wanna know what is hard to know
i wanna fill my time of empty jokes
i wanna keep inside a petty soul
It is the last way to rest i hope

don't wanna know what is hard to know
i wanna live in a religious fault
i wanna feed my mind of silly hope
