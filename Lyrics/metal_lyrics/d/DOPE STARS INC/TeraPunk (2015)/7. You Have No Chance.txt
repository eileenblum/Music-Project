i will not be celebrating
acting like a baby
never been the one who keep watching and be waiting
Never felt so ready. not even have to name it
never give a fuck of the people standing waiting

I just keep to have my faith and know what i believe
I would enter your debate just now but it's late for me to agree
i can notice in your head there's nothing else that counts you have no chance
oh yeah I know you have no chance
