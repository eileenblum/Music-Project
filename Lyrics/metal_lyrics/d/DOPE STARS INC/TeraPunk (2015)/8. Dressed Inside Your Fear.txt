you keep to hold for what is not or what it used to be
there's nothing more just nothing more to turn around and see
you know it's not for that of you the people had to say
your ready now. wrap up the dawn. it's better run away

i got a feeling inside of me
a feeling that makes me fall down from the status of a living being
nothing to win nothing to lose. I never felt i ever had to care
i never choose the way. only i could show myself dressed inside of me
dressed inside dressed inside your fear
