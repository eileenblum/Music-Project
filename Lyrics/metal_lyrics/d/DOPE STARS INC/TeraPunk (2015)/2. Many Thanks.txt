you took a reason to blame
to make my honor a shame
and told just everybody i was like a monster of pain
there is no way i could tell
the rage i feel in my self
why don't you take a shot inside of yourself

so many thanks for your ego
many thanks for your stupid
way to blame everything on myself
so many thanks for your ego
many thanks for your stupid way
to blame everything on my end

you never thought was a shame
to name a reason to blame
like if not everybody knows i am not that monster you say
there is a way i can tell
the rage i feel in myself
why don't you take a gun and shot in your head

so many thanks for your ego
many thanks for your stupid
way to blame everything on myself
so many thanks for your ego
many thanks for your stupid way
to blame everything on my end

so many thanks for the way you were talking to me
so many ways i could tell was so shocking to hear
so many times i would just take a shot out of you
no matter how now the same i can say that to you
there was a time when i was really eager to see
how would you dare telling all standing in front of me
how would you face looking straight into me
