over the time i had to change
nobody else could be my aim
i always lose myself with
all the feelings ever could be named

Needed some time for what is now
i had a vision. Made a vow
I never pretend to play with
all the emotions i could feel

because I want nothing else but you
because i've no reason without you
all i need to feel again
all i need to tame my pain
not a single day i spent with you
was looking just the same
because I want to die along with you
