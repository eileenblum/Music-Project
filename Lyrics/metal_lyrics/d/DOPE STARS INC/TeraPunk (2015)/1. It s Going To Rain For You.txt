got to find a reason to resist on the road
got to be your slave and clean your shit on the floor
got to feel a pack of shit and take all the blame
got to make a loser get the rights to the fame

now you do realize because you failed after all
now you gonna pay it all the way for your faults
time is coming closer when i'll knock at your door
now you name a reason or i'll push to the floor

i don't want to deal with you
i have a done no promise too
I don't want to deal with you
i am not falling down for you
i don't want to be with you
This is not my attitude
turn away it's going to rain for you


I don't wanna hear a single word out your mouth
I don't wanna feel again so bad for a shout
I will never fall into your tricks not again
I will never lose again the fight to the blame

Not another time i want to please after all
not another time i take the shit of your whores
Not a single reason can be good for exchange
I am not a kiddo to be pleased or deranged

i don't want to deal with you
i have a done no promise too
I don't want to deal with you
i am not falling down for you
i don't want to be with you
This is not my attitude
turn away it's going to rain for you
