It's for you
That I push inside myself
It's for you
You my girl you my hope
It's for you
That I would just sell my own
It's for you that is worth to die
And hope that you can understand

But it's hard hard hard
And even if you can't
Believe and read me down
I'll show you from the ground
And hope you get how much you turn me round
You turn me round

It's for you
That I push inside myself
It's for you
You my girl you my hope
It's for you
That I would just sell my own
It's for you that is worth to die
And hope that you can understand

But it's hard hard hard
And even if you can't
Believe and read me down
I'll show you from the ground
And hope you get how much you turn me round
You turn me round
