When it's time to gain the world just sell
And then only reigns indifference
When the end is going to ring it's bell
And what really really matters
Is knocking at our door and going to bend
All your certainties and dreams will turn to hell

Death will come when your last resource will change into crap
And it's gone in your never land where all is a mess
All I hope, yes I hope on your ridiculous throne you will drown
Stupid aged worm it's time to fall
Because your death will come

In a world that looks so hard to change
And a rule is made persistent
If we even can refuse to obey
It will only make no difference
Â 
Death will come when your last resource will change into crap
And it's gone in your never land where all is a mess
All I hope, yes I hope on your ridiculous throne you will drown
Stupid aged worm it's time to fall
Because your death will come
