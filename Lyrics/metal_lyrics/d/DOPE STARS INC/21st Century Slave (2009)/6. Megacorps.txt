A flamethrower
Cleaning the streets and the holes
A pump rifle
Smashing a thousand bones
A reign of fire
Feeding the massacre. Hunt!
Another war on the street
Worship the end of the world
Nothing around
Only a junkyard of steel
And underground
Raging the battle to live
We are squat
Fighting a reign of fear
No more hope

And then a day will come
And all the groans
And all the screams around this world
Will found a horde, of thousand drones
A nuclear massacre will glow
A day will come like a new dawn
A huge revolt out of control
For what you've done
For what it's gone
For every death we'll strike a bomb
On megacorps

A steel tower
Dropping a shadow of gore
And it's power
Freezing the progress and lore
An age of fire
Feeding the cult of the war
To give no reason to trust
And kill faith in the world
They own the crown
And our life is a trick
And on the ground
Starving a thousand kids
We must stop fighting the reign of fear
We must stopÂ 
Â 
And then a day will come
And all the groans
And all the screams around this world
Will found a horde, of thousand drones
A nuclear massacre will glow
A day will come like a new dawn
A huge revolt out of control
For what you've done
For what it's gone
For every death we'll strike a bomb
On megacorps
