It's a horrible trip
When the time is running quick
It's a struggle
I, the evolved machine
I, the adamant who thinks
I will battle

What you have to convey
I can't die for any strain
I'm immortal
I will never obey
All the years I want I'll gain
And will gather

One day
I figured out
It was just a trick
Was just another game
To fuck me up the same
I just forgot to take a count
And you know what I say to this motherfucker?
And you know what I say to this motherfucker?
And you know what I say to this motherfucker?
Get now your time machine away from my life

And anywhere I roam
And anywhere I can
And anywhere I want
I own the throne of the living dead
But anywhere I roam
And anywhere I can
Then even down the worms
Will start to tremble very bad
