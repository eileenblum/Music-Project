When life is breaking down
Into a thousand grains
And there's no way I can avoid to face
The giant black hopeless wall
That drops inside of me a sense of torn
But now
This feeling that I can't support
Now is gone
Because you're mine and I am yours
And I've found
I would like to get one more minute to stay
And keep looking at your smile

I cannot forget all the times that we spent
Every time I see your smile
I would like to get one more minute to stay
And keep looking at your smile

When all my life becomes so hard to face
And all the force I've got begins to fade
When I just feel gone and void
I know I'm not alone and I can fall
Straight down
Into your arms to find the force
And rise up
And all the pain I feel that drops
Me down
In one minute gets far away from my head
When I'm looking at your smile

I cannot forget all the times that we spent
Every time I see your smile
I would like to get one more minute to stay
And keep looking at your smile

When life is breaking down
Into a thousand grains
And there's no way I can avoid to face
The giant black hopeless wall
That drops inside of me a sense of torn
But now
This feeling that I can't support
Now is gone
Because you're mine and I am yours
And I've found
Whatever I can say, for me for you again
It's just a perfect day!

When a day you're gone I'll just cut up
When a day you're gone I'll just cut up
You're just all I want, all I want
