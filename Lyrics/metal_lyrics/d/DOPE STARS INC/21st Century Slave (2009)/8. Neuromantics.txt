What is abuse? It's something I can say
I'm in a mood to clear my head today
A new reality that connects through my brain
But all in all that's the way I need to cut my pain

It's the hardest dope
And then all around is black
It's the hardest dope
And then all around is dead
It's the hardest dope
That turns your head around
That makes you dream and drown
In all the world abound
In a way it's the best drug found

After the cure there's nothing I can say
My head is full of words without a weight
The art of confusion is to keep all the minds estranged
But all in all that's the only way to cut my pain

It's the hardest dope
And then all around is black
It's the hardest dope
And then all around is dead
It's the hardest dope
That turns your head around
That makes you dream and drown
In all the world abound
In a way it's the best drug found

It's the hardest dope
And then all around is black
It's the hardest dope
And then all around is dead
It's the hardest dope
That turns your head around
That makes you dream and drown
In all the world abound
In a way it's the best drug found
