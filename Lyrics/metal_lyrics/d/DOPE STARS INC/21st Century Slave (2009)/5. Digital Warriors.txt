We are the ones who ride the edge
We have no boundaries to defend
We are a nuclear drive of viral strength

We are the offspring of a dream
We have to fight and we can win
We own the sharpest weapons of the grid

We are the punks
We are the first
We are the drill
And thousands are the holes
Where we can find a trick

Because we are
We are the digital warriors
We are the children of the zero and one

We are the ones who rule the web
We have nobody who commands
Among the bits and bytes we roam we dwell

We are the core we are the stream
In endless bytes we own light speed
We have the fastest weapons of this eve

We are the punks
We are the weird
We are the shit
And all around the globe
We are gonna make a blitz

Because we are
We are the digital warriors
And underground we are gonna kill the sys

We are the punks
We are a twist
We are a kiss
Who's gonna make a blitz
And win the rights we need
