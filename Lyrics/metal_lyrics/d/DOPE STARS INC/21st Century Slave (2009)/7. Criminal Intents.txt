And all it sounds so great
Holocaust date
Is not a late coming fate
It's a call for radical shock
Fighting for the rest
The serial is now cracked

The's a mist of fury I feel
Living in tears
Is no more a novelty
It's the last hijack
To hope to bless
To score, you know they suck

My criminal intents
Above the rage I feel
Above all the lies and tears
My criminal intents
Will show the truth you fear
The giant we all bear

You call 'em outlaw rats
Digital gangs
But what you don't understand
It's a new paralysis brand
Freedom is dead
Ethereal fainting fact

There's no gold no reason to steal
Nothing is real
The system will just conceal
It's a place for silicon threats
Silicon codes and silicon hunter hacks

It's the last hijack
To hope to cure
The world and get it fucking back

My criminal intents
Above all the rage I feel
Above all the lies and tears
My criminal intents
Will show a world of fear
The illusion now is clear

My criminal intents
Will save you all my dear
So open now your ears
My criminal intents
Will break the mainframe spear
That's killing all your dear
