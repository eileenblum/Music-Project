Welcome to the electro fight of the robots
the night that never reflects the beams of the battle
I would like to see, to feel, to get inside this force
giving to myself the life I never had before

you can never fail
this is your last day
your body is still mechanical
burning in my head
pulsing inside me
creating a new connection port
you can never fail
this is the doom's day
your body is still mechanical
my body is still mechanical!

Cause i'm Wired
Straight to the core
cause i'm wired
ready to explode
cause i'm wired
welcome to my own hell
plug ânâ die
plug in myself
Â
