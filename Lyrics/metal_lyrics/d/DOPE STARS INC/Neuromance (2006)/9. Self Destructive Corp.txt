There is no turning point
for my obsession
youâre goneâ¦ Iâm lost
What Iâve been looking for?
Iâve lost all the things Iâve fought (for)

There's a sinful ghost
inside the force
that tell's me: âHardcore!!
Reload your gun:
Forget what you were asking for !â
Iâll sacrifice my soul.
So I sell it now
and I will never get it back
I can feel the whole rapture growing
and my blood starts to run fast
I will dance till coma, fuck yeah!

Salvation, Damnation
I'm going down, I'm just a Whore
and baby don't ask me whyâ¦
I've just sold my soul.

Thereâs brand new host
so full of force
that yells me: âHardcore!!â
you have just become and got
what you were asking for
But you have lost your soul
but you should be proud
cause you will never lose again
I can feel your power flowing
and your blood starts to burn fast
You will dance till coma, fuck yeah
Â 
Salvation, Damnation
I'm going down, I'm just a Whore
and baby don't ask me whyâ¦
I've just sold my soul.
