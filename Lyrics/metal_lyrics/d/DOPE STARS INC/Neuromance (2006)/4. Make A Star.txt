Cannot stop - creeping inside my bones
never stop - even when sorrow grows
i don't mind - thatâs something to die for
and it's mine - I'm asking asking for this

Living forevermore
cause I do wanna be a star
I need to live another day
and that's incredible
to stand still waiting for fame
I don't wanna fail
I just wanna feel it now and
make a star out of myself
make a star out of myself

passion grows - Everyday I want more.
i forgot - most of the things I love
but I can't - cannot avoid this world
my own fault - better than waiting for more

i'm craving for this
craving for my life
i cannot lose this chance once again
