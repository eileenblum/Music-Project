I got a loaded gun
a weapon of beta sex sex
total recall
But I'm still in such a daze

Fed up, I start to realize
can't stop the flow
of upcoming files
hey you, wanna enjoy my artificial love
can't stop the thrills, they don't give me enough
there is no god,
chaos and disorder
it's a party
that's crossing the border

Burn to feel
Burn the last thought
Come and test it
on every dance floor

Another pleasure
just a pleasure of love
another pleasure
is never enough

Another pleasure
just a pleasure of love
10.000 watts are never enough

I'm just a falling star
a victim of excess
digital shock
I'm trapped inside the maze
reloaded, I'm cloning my whole life
chemical love, industrialized

fuck you, I don't need your boring love
I got the pills and they thrill me enough
there's hope
a new world order
a new race, that's crossing the border

Burn to feel
Burn the last thought
Come and test it
on every dance floor

Another pleasure
just a pleasure of love
another pleasure
is never enough

Another pleasure
just a pleasure of love
10.000 watts are never enough

Another pleasure
just a pleasure of love
another pleasure
is never enough

Ich weil in dieser welt
da es euch so gefallt
eine machinerie
gedopt mit sex chemie.
