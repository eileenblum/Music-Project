I've never seen you standing proud
no single light inside the crowd
you feel so sorry for yourself
you dream to be somebody else

Living and bleeding
this suffering can't stop in your head
living and bleeding
and nothing can make you understand

A platinum girl
lives inside of you

You're pure platinum
you're pure platinum to me
you're more than I ever dreamt to see

My guiding light inside the crowd
I always saw you standing out
you make my sorrow disappear
my solitude, my pain and fear

Living and breathing
there's more to the life that you had
Living, believing
will guide you to find your promised land

You're pure platinum
you're pure platinum to me
you're more than I ever dreamt to see
You're pure platinum
you're pure platinum to me
I hope you were the one for me...
