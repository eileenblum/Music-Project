It's you, over my dream frame
falling from hi-grace like myself
it's you, a blue star to stare at
breathing together

in cold sides of my mind
I'm starting to rewind
over the golden heart that is colder
you're fading by my side
all wired I can't stop to cry
losing my only hope in this dark dead world of rust

It's you, over my dream frame
falling from hi grace like myself
it's you, a blue star to stare us
breathing together in the dark
it's you, living for nothing
living in nowhere for my faults
it's you, enjoying this decayed dance
over the dance floor of my heart

in cold sides of my mind
I'm starting to rewind
over the golden heart that is colder
you're fading by my side
all wired, I can't stop to cry
losing my only hope in these dark dead cold sides of my mind
