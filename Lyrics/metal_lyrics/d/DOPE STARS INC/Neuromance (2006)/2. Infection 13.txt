Living another day in these plastic years
We are falling
What we are trying to save slowly disappears

ah ah ah ah
wires wires
burn burn
breath breath
spark spark

hi tech all over the world
infect all that you want
sleep all day, party all night
never grow old and never die
your life starts to corrode
hi tech cloning the world
sleep all day, party all night
never grow old and never die

Living one last day in these fading years
They are calling
What we tried to save already disappeared.
