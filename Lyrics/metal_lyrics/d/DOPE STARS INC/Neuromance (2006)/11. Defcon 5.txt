I got the grade and here I am at the training camp
with my master in robotics, proud I am
I just need to know when I have to start my war
and I want to fight till the rust corrodes

I got no no no fucking commander
no no I'm ready for the battle
no no just give me the power
shut up shut up motherfucker

regenerate reassemblate
connect the wires and loose control
you are just controlled by the system
whoo whoo yeah yeah

I don't understand why I cannot control my hate
and this hate just helps me to destroy my faith
there's no war I really meant to start, I know
just a wireless flesh with no remote control

you are nothing more than a loser
stop this hate-wired battle
switch down your fuckin' power
stop it stop it motherfucker

regenerate re-assemblate
connect the wires and loose control
you are just controlled by the system
whoo whoo yeah yeah

you got a role, you got a round,
you got a fucking way to see what's behind
you had to serve. you're just dead
you are more or less a lifeless mech
