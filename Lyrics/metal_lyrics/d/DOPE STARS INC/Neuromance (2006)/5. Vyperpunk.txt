Infecting the mainframe with all my rage
Fear and anger my heart shaped cage
The circuits scream louder as data flows
With every byte the volume grows

Press play just to hear it loud
and then feel it louder
scream out and keep moving on
like a viral process

Just giving me a VR-place
and kill me every time you want
keep loading shit into my head
it makes me feel like an empty drone

Won't you die for this damn cyber hell
My sick vyper hate is killing you
My fight goes on until you're nothing more
than a single string of code

Uploading my virus to make it scream loud
To detonate my bomb in the crowd
The hate loading process is moving on
Sending my rage with one megaton

Shut down and delete these worlds
that are full of programs
shut down and erase your code
you're a useless process
