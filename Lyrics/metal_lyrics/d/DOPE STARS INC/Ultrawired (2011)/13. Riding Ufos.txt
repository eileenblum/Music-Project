grains from deep space
giving a source
to that faith
of pure ignorance
plain dark fool's cult
of human creed
absolute crap
living the lapse of a dream

shame on you
to keep all this nonsense
now you can not swear
let it be now or a fleet
is gonna take down your beliefs

all what is gone it's up to you
follow the good sense. give us a new chance
all what is gone it's up to you
we want a rich and global existence
give us the knowledge of your world
riding the ufos
hyperdrive to the black hole show

names from deep space
taking a look
to that faith
of pure ignorance
ray lights blue bright
sparks of a beam
absolute grasp
leaving no time for a shield

shame on you
cause everything is gone man
time is not your friend
let it be now or a beam
is gonna take down your beliefs

there's a message on the world just to be heard
there is nothing. not a law. just to be held
giving all my trust to you. that was my fault
there's a coming world disaster from the moon
