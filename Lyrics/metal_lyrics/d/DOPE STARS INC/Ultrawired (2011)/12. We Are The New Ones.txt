We are the new ones
We are a people state
Who's got the future
Who's got the name of change
We got a reason
Just another pierced goon of little faith
Your time is over
Obey or not: you fail
No time for reasons
No time for all these games
Not just a nuance
Another question you won't like to see

A trade of bottle dreams
Your time is over. Time is over
No rage or battle fields
We are breaking through without a warning

We are the new ones
We're the hope
We are the spring
We are just a new round
Around the world
You have to see
A bleeding romance
Over the top
Not just a dream
And what is over
Oh what is gone
Oh what is gone yeahh
Was just a dream

There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part; you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!
