Take a night to know yourself
take a night to know your thoughts
just to ride a dream
Not just typical of you
It is time to look into your doom

take a night into your hands
nothing is above your thoughts
nothing is to blame
Like a vision comes to you
leading all the force inside of you

getting over all the lies you blame
getting over all the truth you say
let the hope be back into your soul
it's a feeling like you never know

whoooo

the need of your desires has come thru the never

nothing is like to lose the edge
living now like the best day
the need of your desires has come thru the never
