Taking a screen
shot of your day
taking a scream
shot in your brain
faking a world of status you've changed

morning and more
backup to save
loggin your tracks
loggin your space
nobody's got the right to escape

the ocean spreading seeds
the ocean spreading seeds
the ocean spreading seeds
the ocean spreading seeds

to backup the world is sad
cause after you comprehend
you wrote all of you
inside of this two
dimensional world
with thousands of new old friends
Just a VR world
Just a VR world

Shocking and vain
That's your update
backup your tracks
backup your face
who gives a fuck of the crap that you say

morning and more
profiles you change
make a new pass
get a new name
leaving behind you a thousand of fakes

to backup the world is sad
cause after you comprehend
you wrote all of you
inside of this two
dimensional world
with thousands of new old friends
Just a VR world
Just a VR world
