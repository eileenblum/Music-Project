You got a stalker in the back of your brain
you're in a fucking tv battle game
yeahhh
no more power
no more breath
another hour left of terror &amp; pain
yeahhh yeahh

A crowd lusting for pleasure to kill
a sick crowd of tv head motherfuckers

run run motherfucker run
run little baby run
we bet on your life today
run run motherfucker run
run little baby run
we bet on your life today

you got a sticker in the back of your head
you're just a number in the hell of fame
yeahh
no more panic
no more steps
we are gonna have a night of pleasure and pain

A crowd lusting for pleasure to kill
A crowd lusting for pleasure to kill
a sick crowd of tv head motherfuckers

run run motherfucker run
run little baby run
show me some fun today
run run motherfucker run
run little baby run
show me some fun today
