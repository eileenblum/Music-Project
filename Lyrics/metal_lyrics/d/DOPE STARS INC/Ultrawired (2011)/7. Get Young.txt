The only matter who brings back the feeling
for chilling out today
is playing with golden axe for just another round
Then switch it off and look for a new game
No dice &amp; shake can let you feel
Like in the edge of the new world
Videogames make you feel
just make you feel good

get young ah ah ahhh

Now all around is just black and blue flashing
into my eyes today
Exploring thousands worlds I've never heard before
right from the TV-scart get in your brain
The pad is shaking. Time to flee
restart the game from a new slot
Videogames make you feel
just make you feel good

get young ah ah ahhh
