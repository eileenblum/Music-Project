We are virtual &amp; real
We are the hope
once the network gave to people the right to talk
Get ready to fight
Cause their rage will grow
They're gonna get a lot of people to kick your bone

An entire earth is looking to change mind
with photo cameras and machine voice
It's better you realize
It's better you know
We're a mass of geeks ready to fuck you

Words on a web map
shine like a new sun
moves from the backyard
cracking the power
words on a web map
bright like a new gun
firing on net pows
cracking the power
cracking the power
cracking the power

It's a mechanical oblivion
to block their doors
when you never give to people the right to talk
they're just so polite
and they love their groove
when systematical corruption just make a boom

An entire earth is looking to change mind
with photo cameras and machine voice
It's better you decide
It's better you know
We're a mass of geeks ready to fuck you

Words on a web map
shine like a new sun
moves from the backyard
cracking the power
words on a web map
bright like a new gun
firing the net pows
cracking the power
cracking the power
cracking the power
