Nothing new yet another quick ride
for the oil and the human rights
nothing more than a bunch of green guys
on the road for imperial fight
But it's not the same
now is not the same
believe it or not
they've got plan

Nothing new yet another rich fight
for the oil and the human rights
like an flash buring into the black night
all around you can hear gunfire
it's the bomb first aid
it's the bomb first aid
believe'it or not
they're going to kill

When lights just start to rain
it makes you feel like every day
is just the last day of the world
You better stop
You better stop
No life belongs to you
No life belongs to you

Nothing new yet another rich fight
for the oil and the human rights
like an flash buring into the black night
all around you can hear gunfire
it's the bomb first aid
it's the bomb first aid
believe'it or not
they're going to kill

When lights just start to rain
it makes you feel like every day
is just the last day of the world
You better stop
You better stop
No life belongs to you
No life belongs to you
