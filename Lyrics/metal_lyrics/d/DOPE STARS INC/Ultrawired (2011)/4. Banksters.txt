It's a matter of ABC
Just a nightmare in your dreams
When electric money grows
Grom your hands goes to the core

Right to please you everyday
They prepared so many games
Just a war of rotten goats
And you know what?

Please the bankster
Shot shot shot one more shot shot shoot the bastard
Shot shot shot one more shot shot shoot the bastard

It's a matter of heavy greed
Polticians gave a dream
To the mass distracted goats
With the weapon of their votes

Information spreading hate
Keep a shadow on real fate
Of the future(?) locked doors
And you know what?

Please the bankster
Shot shot shot one more shot shot shoot the bastard
Shot shot shot 1 more shot shot shoot the (fuc***)bastard

And you know what? And you know what? And you know what?...... BAM!
