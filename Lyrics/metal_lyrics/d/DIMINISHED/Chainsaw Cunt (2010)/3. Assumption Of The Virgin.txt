Youâre not the first
Youâre not the last
No Name
Like, The Rest In The Past
So Innocent
So Pure
So sweet
Now Dead To Me
Elegance has fallen from grace, with a light thatâs cast out
Strip from your charities, your purities taken right out.
Consume by my will I must kill.
Take from you, prestige innocence away
Spread your legs wide open
Bust threw your hymen
Seepage of serenity
Pound out your virginity
Begging me for mercy (Shut The Fuck Up)
Grind my dick threw your anatomy
Sensational urges tell me
Mangle up your cunt viciously
Eradicate your snatch completely
