Feeding frenzy 
Impulse gauging 
Vile substance 
Iâm consuming  
Ripping tearing 
Threw her 
In sides 
Trying to retrieve the afterâ¦â¦.Birth
Feeding frenzy 
Impulse gauging 
Vile substance 
Iâm consuming  
 Sensational urges inside of me 
I canât resist 
The essence of your life will embellish mine 
Immortality 
Pulling out the afterbirth eat of the placenta  
It is key to life, I canât keep it down 
Disgorge 
From in my throat 
NO I must consume, chew it viciously, vile puss is secreting  
Filling me with life 
Consume the after birth
