Horror stains my sanity 
Ascend into sovereignty 
Annihilate those weaker than me 
Survive if I let them be 
Loyal to a false nation 
Kill with no hesitation 
Storming the opposition 
Impaled those resist 
Grotesquely Butchered on the frontlines 
Justify to crucify a nation 
All for the loyalty (Innocent war fatalities) 
Produced by depravity (the war is still gone but Iâm still he) 
A soldier left with no mission 
Vile impudence has pledge me 
I Canât Stop Killing the Weak Beings
In disgust youâre cleanse a must 
Reflection of the horror to be 
Images that stain my sanity 
Emboweled by my hate for thee 
Donât be a hero die a coward 
Violently tearing your anatomy I endeavor 
Donât be a hero die a coward 
The war is still gone but (Iâm Still He)
