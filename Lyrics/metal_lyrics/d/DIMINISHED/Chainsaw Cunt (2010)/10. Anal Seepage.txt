You bitch donât disrespect me
Your about to see another side of me 
Wrapped in Saran wrap hanging from ceiling 
From your anus my semen is spilling
I have already warned you one too many times
(Fucking bitch your gonna die)
Real fucking tired of you disrespecting me
(Donât try to beg and plead)
As if Iâm not knowing- Iâm not stupid
You think Iâm not knowing- Your fucking stupid
Punch you in the mouth, knock out your teeth, (wrap you to death I beat)
Wrap you in saran wrap
While your still alive donât worry (your not gonna die)
Your not laughing now bitch
No disrespecting now bitch
Now Iâll bend you over and take the only thing your good for
My dick is tearing your ass, you fucking whore
Violently raping you in your asshole- Anal Seepage
Muffled screams driving me, anal hemorrhaging- Anal Seepage
Pulling out your intestines with my cock hard as a rock- Pink Sock
Left helpless and twitching
From the violent heavy ass pounding
Your ass dripping my cum
Brutally bent you make sure I get my point across
In your ass my fist got lost your salad gets toss
Now its time to start the killing
I donât care forget the feelings
Stabbing the bitch again and again
Sodomizing my wife with the knife
Stabbing the bitch again and again
Disrespecting me lost her life
Your about to see another side of me
