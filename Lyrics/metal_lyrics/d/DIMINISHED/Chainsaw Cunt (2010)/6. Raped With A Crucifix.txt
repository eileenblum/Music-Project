You lead a life of celibacy 
For your love a deity 
Your hymen kept in tact just for me 
I canât wait to hear you scream 
Raped with a crucifix 
Your services help to spread his lie 
So Iâll help to spread your legs 
The lies ravage my brain like Iâll ravage your cunt 
This pain Iâm inflicting is a must 
Stripped from the cloth and tied to the bed 
This crucifix hangs above our heads 
Tear down the cross with hate and disgust 
In your vagina I must thrust 
Scream gods name as I ram it in 
Ripping and tearing through your hymen 
A statue of Christ crucified 
Cuts through your cunt for the first and last time 
You sure lost your faith real fast 
As I pull your entails out of your ass 
Now you scream in pain, in my pants I just came 
Now you know first hand of sin 
With the crucifix deep with in 
Now you scream to the sky why God why
