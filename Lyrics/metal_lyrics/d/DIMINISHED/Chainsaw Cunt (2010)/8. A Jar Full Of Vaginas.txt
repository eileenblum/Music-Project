Stick in the head, this I know
My sanity no longer holds
Screaming as youâre tied to the bed 
Futile to resist you're soon be dead 
Yea baby I like a little fight 
Pound out your teeth so you canât bit
My dick in your mouth tears in your eyes
My cum and your blood seeps out the sides
Iâm not finished though you though you think I am 
I am not learning without trophy in hand
So many other women I have collected
Your pussy I carefully dissect
Your ever oral vases my dick will infect 
Run my scalpel over pussy 
Mouth is watering your mice and juice
I love it when your eyes get wide
My knife plunged deep inside 
Hold your vagina in my hand and
Fuck it while youâre alive
Ejaculating to the tears you cry.
