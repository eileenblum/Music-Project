Slit Your Stomach 
Open 
Reaching in to the womb 
Extract entrails 
Slowly removing the skin 
Violently convulsing 
Watching me take your life 
Away Dissecting 
The entrails
Dissecting the 
Entrails 
Disemboweling you with my knife 
Carving 
Out 
Yours 
Intestines 
Screaming for mercy but youâll receive none 
(Dissecting the Entrails) 
Impaling your intestines watching your blood run 
The last thing youâll see is me 
Duct Tape, Gag and Tied To the Table 
Fight for Your Life, but youâre not able 
Eradicating with no homage 
Death calls as you fall unconscious  
Dissecting the entrails
