Vile stench of rotting pussy
It draws me near 
Your legs open I will tear 
I do not care
Rotting vagina meat
It draws me near
Your legs open I will tear
From your uterus discharge is seeping 
Into your vagina my fingers are creeping
Consuming vaginal discharge
Molding discharge is secreting 
I began feasting
Grotesque substance fills my mouth
I wonât spit it out 
Now eating your lifeless pussy
It is still juicy
Stains my mouth while Iâm eating
Bleedingâ¦Secretingâ¦ 
Disgusting white puss
Consumption is a must
I cannot stop my lust 
My nut I must bust
Rampant urges I canât control
Where your body is no one will know
Into violence I start my dissent
Now time to start the dismemberment
Starting from your pussy I began to rip
Tearing off all of your skin and pussy lips
Violently stabbing and harvesting organs out
Still taste discharge in my mouth
