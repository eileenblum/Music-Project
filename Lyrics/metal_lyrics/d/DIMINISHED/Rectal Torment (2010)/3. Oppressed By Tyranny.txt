Oppressed by tyranny 
The glass looking back, see what everyone sees
I confront the demons that have taken me
Donât know how I got here this is not who I am 
I walk from the fire and discover man
Neither going back Iâm fixing the blemish
Realizing the reasons man and will not diminish
Neither cold nor hot, lukewarm in the gray
I spew you out my life, jump the bridge you set a blaze
Wear the captainâs hat to run the nation
A new face to heal frustrations 
The dead presidents leaving their mark behind
With only greed on their mind
You say we got to work as a team
To live the American Dream
You say we got to put the nation ahead of you 
But what has it done for you
Oppressed by tyranny 
Wear the captainâs hat to run the nation
A new face to heal frustrations 
The dead presidents leaving their mark behind
With only greed on their mind
Neither cold nor hot, lukewarm in the gray
I spew you out my life, jump the bridge you set a blaze
So many faces itâs hard to tell who is who 
Shouldnât be hard the only tyrant here is you 
Try to pick one I like but I keep losing track
I wish I know which one of you put that knife in my back
Neither cold nor hot, lukewarm in the gray
I spew you out my life, jump the bridge you set a blaze
Oppressed by tyranny 
Please the masses with false promises while the economy burns
Destroying the future for the sake of your term 
Use me how you want you canât stop me
Youâre a tyrant to yourself your own worst enemy
