Evolve from the past societies enlighten to the change
Condemn until declared to the new front thatâs the same
Unrelenting desecration 
No autonomy 
The unrelenting
Portraying everyone free
Blinded by the false illusion
I wonât pander to your amusement
Disembowel all the others from another society 
All the prejudice 
Hypocrite
Lying sack full of shit
Enslave manâs will for your own gain
Feed the rhetoric to the masses to gain all of their trust
Cast down their believes to obtain power
Power is a must
All the corruption, fueled by greed, back by creed
Masked as a nation, who strides for harmony?
Unrelenting desecration fueled by the corruption of mankind
Unrelenting desecration 
I wonât be subdued
Malicious fallacies disguise as promises
In your game of ridicule
