You held so high all by all your peers 
Yet I hold your vain in distain 
Now I'll bring forth your worst fears 
Your youthful essence I'll obtain 
Your false illusion of grandeur 
Solid to many but I never bought 
Digging your nails into my flesh 
You beg for me to stop but I will not 
Penetrate to desecrate 
Whip that smile off your fucking face right now bitch 
I'll leave your rotting corpse lying in a ditch 
Penetrate to desecrate 
Viciously demeaning 
Getting off to your screaming 
Penetrate to desecrate 
Your legs are spread open wide 
Violently piercing inside 
Penetrate to desecrate 
Inflicting so much agony 
Due to the lack of morality 
Leaving your body mangled with no remorse 
For my hate, you are the source
