Salvation in sovereignty, cast the first stone upon me
Still not satisfy in my journey
The struggles go on to keep on searching
Is the highest high worth the lowest lows?
Is this the right path, itâs the only path that I know
The million dollar question that has no value
Conflicted in whether I should or should not continue
To reach this heaven I must endure this hell
Consumed by my tormented barricaded cell
Only I and I alone know
The value that I put on this prize holds
To start the change I want to see
All things are possible if I believe
Bounded by my own pride
Blinded by my own sight
Deprived by my own greed
But it is all that I need
Forever in search of this intangible
Trap in my unrelenting desire
Bounded by my own pride
Blinded by sight
Deprived by my own greed
My ambition
But itâs all that I will ever need
Inquisition is futile
No sense in understanding
Imprisoned by my vanity
To chase and find what I seek
To gain is must at all cost
No matter what is even lost
Glory bound and now Iâve found
What it is I'm looking for
At grasps reach, was this really what I was looking for? 
Or was it the hunt that Iâd enjoyed more of
Contradicting myself, I'm at a cross roads
The hunger continues forever onward
