Well aware you know not to doubt me
I donât care ruthless is me 
Iâm your nightmare that became your reality
Iâm heartless, darkness I take away their lives regardless
No reason why I kill just something inside of me 
Impurity
Itâs not right but I donât care
I could stop but why would I want to
Impurity
Pleasures of the insanity
Impurity 
Itâs not in me itâs in you
Impurity
I know what I have to do
Impurity
The horrible things I do 
Impurity 
I have to remove it from you
Gruesomely murdering with no remorse 
By my hate I am forced  
Violently torturing and punishing 
Cleansing the impurities that infect you
