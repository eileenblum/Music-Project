Fall from a higher state, becoming less through time
Moments of grand delusion forthcoming
A lapse into something divine, perhaps it's all a disguise

Expendable contortions follow, a race against what is real
A lapse from grace is the eternal triumph of evil
When insanity reign's king

So follow me now, you're falling behind
Have the will to set free
