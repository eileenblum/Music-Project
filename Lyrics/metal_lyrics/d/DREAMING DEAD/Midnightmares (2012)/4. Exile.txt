This yearning grows ill when thoughts of you
Slip through me like poison
Birth of this sickness, infecting my will
Relics upon my return

Exiling is futile
Remnants from a world forsaken

Home of the hopeless
Scars of this weakness
Memories fading forever

I long for death's promise to be set free

Roman's escape veneer
Beneath lies a true prison
Never to return to the sweetness of soft flesh

This Elba, a deathbed,
Thoughts of return, fantasy
Broken dreams lay me softly down

Home of the fallen
Scars of battles lost
In sickness forevermore
