In my dreams I cry
Time weighing &amp; pushing towards sanity's end
Towards the end, towards to end; Midnightmares out for you &amp; me
Haunting my body, comes creeping destroying all sense of tranquility
Slipping &amp; falling &amp; hiding &amp; soon out of luck
Lock yourself away before dusk
Deceiving my body, possessing my mind
Quickly now help me, soon out of time.
Soon I shall awaken
And reason with my own
Accepting this sentence in silence
Shame as my new home
Haunting my body, comes creeping destroying all sense of tranquility
Slipping &amp; falling &amp; hiding &amp; shit out of luck
Lock yourself away before dusk
