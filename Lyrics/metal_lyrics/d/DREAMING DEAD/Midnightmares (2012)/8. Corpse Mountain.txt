I rise in this dream world of mine
Stacking corpses a mile high
In this dream world of mine

Valley of darkness, a kingdom of mine
Madness consumes the beast inside
Acres of sickness, nothing left untouched
Ripping through bodies, devouring their guts

Not all shall parish, I must control the urge
And build a strong foundation with your corpse

Valley of darkness, a kingdom of mine
Madness consumes the beast inside
Acres of sickness, nothing left untouched
Ripping through bodies, devouring their guts

I rise in this dream world of mine
Stacking corpses a mile high
In this nightmare of mine
