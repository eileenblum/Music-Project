Tainted water falls on the edge
Of sleep, thoughts coalesce
Into perfect view serenity
So calm completely, breeding
Impending realms of death

Crowned he is born into the night
Blind eyes burning, silent accord
Bring forth the pain inherited then
Death valley awakens the dark overlord

Visions of a lover's warm embrace
Replaced with tears of rage
A friendship's steady bond wavering
Falling, gone, broken
Piercing thoughts consume my flesh

Grinding, teeth will disintegrate
Reason, losing with every step I take
Waking, into hell's reality
Dying, within this dream landscape, escape

Eyes open towards a new day's doom
My soul an open vein
Darkness will bring him forth once more
Never to long for the sleep again.
