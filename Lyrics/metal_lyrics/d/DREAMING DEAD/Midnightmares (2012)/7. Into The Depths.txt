Let the weakness quickly ease the pain
Tomorrow a shadow that never became
Drawn into this marathon of death
Falling deeper &amp; deeper &amp; further away

I cannot confront the pain
And risk what keeps me sane

Now I lay myself to sleep
I close my eyes &amp; heart for keeps
Please let me go before I wake
My home, my heart; my joy, my fate

Demons creeping into sight
Emotions running to the finish line
Racing beats turn to a screech
The end is near, I feel it closing in
I never shall put up a fight

Resignation, doomed for eternity; death forever,
A nightmare within a dream
