Death awaits, from broken policies
At last, we've reached the end of time

No more premeditation
Provocation, the final combat
Casualties now lying in their tombs

The voice of guilt that descends into silence

When death ensues, when it takes place
Hurry now, no time is left to spare

Eye for an eye
For the rich and for the poor
Envy, hate, greed, murder
Power awaits you all
Eye for an eye
For the rich and for the poor
Manslaughter, you've been sentenced for

The voice of guilt that descends into silence
