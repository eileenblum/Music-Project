Dark, dark forest screams
Ancient tales of misery
No heart, no heart left here will beat
Through the cold nights consumed in mystery

You're lost in the blinding light of delusion

Show me your pleasure show me your pain
In my times of trial and doubt
Give me your pleasure give me your pain
You want to be it but you can't feel
So don't follow me until you see it
This moment marks the end of your time
I will now take back what truly is mine

It sharpens the shape of my fear
And I must soon hide away both in vain and in shame
In a corner poor, small pathetic soul
Void is the trembling sight of discourage

You're lost in the blinding light of delusion, of illusion
In your own confusion

Seething, falling, these blackened visions doomed alike
No path left to follow down, no will left where am I now
Where am I now?

Slowly leaving just room for time to fade away
No path to follow down, no will left where am I now
Where am I now?

Show me your pleasure show me your pain
In my times of trial and doubt
Give me your pleasures give me your pain
To me no difference it's all the same
