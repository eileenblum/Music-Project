Falling from up high
Hit the ground at full speed I die
Remains of ashes are thrown
Into an ocean of many, a soul no one knows
Night-filled putrid is the sky
The vortex awaits us now
One day we will rise

Your own conviction of valor
Lying safe in hands of destiny's end
Waiting for the next victim
At my cost, whom should we be-friend

Your ignorance compares to no other
The chance for me to resist
Will be the test of time
For a life that should no longer live
The destiny's calling
For a life that could no longer give

Bodies rotting calling onto me
Whispers silence now death will arise
