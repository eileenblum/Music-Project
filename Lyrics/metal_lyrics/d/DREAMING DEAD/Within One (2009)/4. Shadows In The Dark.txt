Soon darkness will be near, through my mind it bleeds
Thirst of the chosen one, those visions were foreseen
I dare not repeat nor speak, thoughts of pain, thoughts of suffering

And you'll never be too far away
Like the light that follows throughout the day
Hiding, hunting, stalking predator to its prey

Shadows in the dark
Fear born within
Memories from the past
Shadows in the dark
All is closing in
No more can I take
Make it go away

Now I wonder in fear &amp; doubt, fore every step I take
One leads towards fields of dreams, the other fueled by hate
Now everything closes in, a troubled mind always left in shame

Hold this breeze away
Nothing left from you
Nothing left for me
Nothing but dreams in pain
