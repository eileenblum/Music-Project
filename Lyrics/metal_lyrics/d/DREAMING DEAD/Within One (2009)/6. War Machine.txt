Power has spoken again
Since the beginning and
Until the end

Warrior of honor
Your steel suit of death
Embraces fates calling
Don't dare to look back

Lost in a day dream of rage
With backgrounds of fire
Of lives filled with pain

Murder your equal
Destroy it all
No heart, no body
Just war machine souls

Power has spoken

Cries of a mother
Left without her own
All lies now uncovered
As your sanity falls

Forward now
Here it begins
Your sweat drips faster
As your blood runs thin
