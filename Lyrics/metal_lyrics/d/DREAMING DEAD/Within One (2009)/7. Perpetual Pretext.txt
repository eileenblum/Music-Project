Rendered now is the calling
Perpetual pretexts from now and forever more
Pushing through your reasons
I cannot escape the notion of mass murder

Release the dead
I hear them calling
Release the dead
Their bodies still rotting

Orchestrate, obliterate, disintegrate
Three words that only describe the pain
Of those now gone

Never forgive &amp; never forget
The ones that take then return only empty promises
Never forgive &amp; never forget
The hand you shake, walk away
Now feel the knife pierce through your back

I cannot escape the notion of mass murder
