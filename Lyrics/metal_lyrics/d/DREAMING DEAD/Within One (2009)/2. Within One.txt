Behold the secrets of sorrow
Winds of anguish take me away
Hearts of stone only hollowed
Another tomorrow, another heartache

Within lies are true
Word of hate
First me then you

Time of fierce confrontation
Plotting vengeance with detail and spite
The seeds of hatred have risen amongst us
You cannot deny it nor put a blind eye

All is lost within one

Forced to step away
The end is here and you know it
Hold me close
As we fall into the depths of the unknown

Another will tell you the stories to come
No doubt single-sided fabrications
Believe what you will if that's what you want
I'll just pick-up from here and move on
