Eyes filled with redemption
Never could she deny
The emptiness, the sorrow
That laughs as she cries

Cursed are all your dreams
Cursed the pathetic life you live
Cursed forever in your own deceit

Another sun now sets
And again to me he swore
To finish the task that was promised
Far too many sunsets ago

Soothe the day
Kill the night
Sew your dreams
Don't waste anymore time

Soon the day will come
To their desolate minds
Where hopes lies in dark
And in the face of loss
tears are left behind
