Infinite voids of space within the pockets of time
Countless spheres of resistance...coincide
Recreated within the five planes
Reflect the image of each other
And the endless planes beyond
Forward into existence
Worlds embrace the magic of life
Infinity of livid worlds
That out-numbers one another
Cycles woven within cycles
Countless eras squared forever
Mirrors of dimension reflect
Coming future generations
Living wheel of evolution
Perseverance of creation
Circle unending...through reproduction
Diversity stimulates desire
Continued concept of evolution...
