Drawn into the light of deception
The warmth of it's beauty flows through my being
Strangulation, a sensation alien in nature to me
Eyes open and here I am
A dream tells me of my (abduction/conception)

Remembering the ancient dream of a memory
Confined to the physical, inside a conciousless host
Euphoric hypnosis, vivid reality
The addiction, the substances necessary to the illusion - life
I remember my (conception/abduction) and how I was taken,
With the countless number
Cease to be, free existence
I remember the weightless warmth and the light coming from outside the womb
The naked cold of your lie - birth

I commend you on your deceit
A prison so perfectly concealed
Suffer, and gain salvation
Favor, in your eyes
Earn, the privilege of (slavery/servitude)
Bleeding through the doors of rebirth
Brought back to life with a bullet to the head
I thank you for the key, death without fear
The only doorway to re-existence
Now you stand before me, and I before you, the uncreation you regret
I am the living doorway to re-existence
With a single breath you can be forever
I am the (messiah/savior/deliverer) of all
