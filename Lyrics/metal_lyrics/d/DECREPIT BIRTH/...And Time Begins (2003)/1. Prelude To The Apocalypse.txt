Before time it existed a lifeless barren rock
Orbiting perpetually the sphere of light
Incubating life upon the jewel of omnipotence

Harmony (balanced with chaos)

Instinctual process
Learning continuous
Calling upon effort to survive as a whole

Life brings forth life
Through will and determination trial, error
The teaching of experience

Generating growth

The catalyst stimulating evolution blood
The color of a new beginning

An era emerges

And through the farthest reaches of the earth
Consciousness expanded, one dimensional
Standing contradicting to it's very nature

And through time evolution birthed a paradox

Two truths contradict but both exist
Nature-reality and evolution
Imaginary thoughts spawned fictitious lie.
