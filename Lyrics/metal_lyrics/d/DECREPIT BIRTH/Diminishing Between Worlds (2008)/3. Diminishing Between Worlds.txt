Ascending I look down upon the lucid dream I leave behind the division of thought that evolved two suns echoing throughout all world fragments of life.

Separation of being from flesh I transcend back to thought.

The origin of all, Subconsciousness...
Ancient memories Re-emerge

To be lost again, to discover that I am Self
To see behind the shadows of illusion from within the earths.

I touch the heavens reflecting opposite thought

They speak to me, words of vast illusions, the inner and outer worlds, all mirroring creation

Containing all in existence, infinite worlds of relative energies

Intricate balance of oppositions, repeating patterns of complex detail

And self variation
Infinitely
And I am the essence

Engulfed in the light

Universe through unity, all memories diminished.
