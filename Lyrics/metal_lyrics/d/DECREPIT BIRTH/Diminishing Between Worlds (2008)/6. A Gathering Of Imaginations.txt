Existence before this world life
Coherent forms of reason holds
Energies of life... awareness

Drawn by seduction
Drawn beyond intrigue,
Into the blind sphere
The orb of deceit

Absorbed into the concept eternal
Energies harnessed and transferred perpetually
Imaginations deceived in rapture

Infinite experiences
Infinite reflection of emotion

Inspiring my creations
Conscious though imprisoned

Within self...vanities,
Insecurities
The creation of mind

Manifest the living light
Mutation to entity...flesh
Flesh binds the image...for suffering

The creation of my living dream

Beings born to pain
To die in pain... time and again
All are lost forever in the illusion...unknowing

Fade into forever...
