I was...
I am...
and will, forever be...

Reflections of time that once was
And time that will carry all on...

Parallels dimensions cross within me.

I reflect...

The eye opens wide my visions of omnipotence and understanding

Falling into and out of existence,
As light surrounds my soul.

I see the pain of innocence and the guilt of sin
Billions of aeon's joined together through me

To recreate matter
And bring forth solitude to my elite

Follow my light
And we will
All is as one.

To learn from the past
And give to the future
A perfect concept
Will bring your energies to me

Pain and pleasure redefined
Anger and forgiveness no longer disported
All questions answered
All symbols of life removed
To better serve my purpose.
And so I am.

Reflection of Emotion will
Manifest into the existence of my infinity...

Life after life.
