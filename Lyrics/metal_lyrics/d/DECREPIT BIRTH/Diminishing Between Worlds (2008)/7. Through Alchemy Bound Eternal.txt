Unbalance within the eternal existence
Across the planes of sightless vision
Evolves imagination
A dense hole containing the most solid of matter
Endless emptiness without a horizon
Reveals the vastness
Of the planes of time

And through my dreams
Combining the elements
Sealed by blood
Bound through eternity

Endless energies of the living
Summoned to be
I am the source of the magic's
I am never ending

Condemned to the everlasting
The spirit of this world is mine
Bestow my powers of the light

Harnessing of the energies brought fourth unto time
Imagination
Dimension
Condemned to my will

Lucid reality consciousness rendered unconscious
Into the physical form
Forever born into the dream
To suffer
For me

Submicroscopic evolution of substance
At the core the beginning is

I am the universe
I am the sacred key
I am the forced which binds thee eternal
I will forever be
Everlasting
