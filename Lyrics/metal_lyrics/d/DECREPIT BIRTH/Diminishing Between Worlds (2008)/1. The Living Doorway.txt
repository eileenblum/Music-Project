Through the realms of time and space
Exists a portal of the mind
To return unto dimensions
Once inhabited by souls of divinity

Now through my grace
I dominate the will to reveal
Destinies of the others
Who once inhabit this world
Within my unconsciousness
I project the emerging unity of Energy
To absorb their experiences
And claim them mine

I hold the key
To my kingdom

And fulfill my greed, I rule as one

Visions intertwine
The immortal energies combine
Condemned eternally, to be forever

Reborn...

Transcending this immortal dimension
Into the darker realms of light.

Drifting forward
Endless knowledge
Thought and life.

And only I am the doorway to Re-existence.
