Metallic speculum the seventh specere
Mirror of preconception
Heightened expanse of observation
I emerge from within the violet crown

Through time it begins again
An existence of one
Begin the cycle of what is to be
I process the illusion of the dream

Djedi awakens
All points of consciousness
Triad octave division

Isolated from external light
The third eye opens 
Awaken the mind
Imprint the program of self
In the instantaneous experience of being

Opening the source code of embryogenesis
And self unity conceived

Isolated from external light
The third eye opens 
Awaken the mind
I feel myself being reconceived
Beyond the dimensions of humanity

Infinite points of light come together
Cross within my being
Focused within the spectrum
I see my sol beyond the prism

Divine light of recreation
To be born into time again
Three rivers of life come together
Trikaya

Epigenetic Triplicity
Isogenic evolution
Squared eternally within itself
Epigenetic Triplicity (Isogenic evolution)

Epigenetic Triplicity
Illuminated soul of the buddha
Heart and life and mind of the trinity
Manifesting in unity

Epigenetic Triplicity
Three portals of the souls frequencies
Tripled helix, genomatic axiom
Epigenetic Triplicity (Isogenic evolution)

Sequential amino chain
Evolution, evolved

Evolution of the imagination
Contained within the heart of the soul
The purest expression exists within
The nucleus of the universe

Trimethyltryptamine
Molecule of the spirit evolved
Progress through the cycles of the living light
Climax of time perpetual

Polarized balance of the multiplicity
Structured pattern, self similarities
Reawakening of the energies
Through the Axis mundi
