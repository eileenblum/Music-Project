Within the light of life
Exists the sacred paths
Into creation
Existing behind a blinding light of darkness
Of human want illusion
The white magnetic mirror of humanity
A living pool of self-reflection

Reflecting mans self-consciousness
Relive the dream of my ancient lives
Two mirrorsâ¦ we come togetherâ¦ face each other
Selfless I face myself
Kaâ¦ who am I?

Inner-twinning of infinity within myself
The ageless form is again revealed
Mirroring humanity I stare into myself
Kaâ¦ who am I?
I am alone, self-judgment

Illuminated in the light of truth
Living light of recollection
Absorbs my mind in it's vibration
Within the light of life, I become revealed
Self-reflection rebirths wisdom
Eternal knowledge of life returns self-revelationâ¦
I reawaken
Kaâ¦ I am the consequence of my pre-destination
Predetermined through my past lives
The destiny of my actions

Inner-twinning of infinity within ourselves
The ageless form is again revealed
Mirroring humanity I stare into myself

I enter the pool of self-reflection
Shattering the magnetic mirror of deception
Self-revelationâ¦
I reawaken
Awakening within my consciousness
I reawaken myself. Atmanâ¦ ka

Displacing the frequencies throughout the spectrum
Within seven mirrors of self-reflection
Seven eyes of imagination
Seven realms within the imageâ¦
Into which I descend

Within the light of life
I walk the sacred paths of the creation
Existing behind a blinding light of darkness
Of the human condition
The white magnetic mirror of humanity
The hidden light of self-deception

Reflection of my self-conscious
Enter the dream of my future lives
Beyond the light of deception

Inner-twining of infinity within the self
The ageless formâ¦ kaâ¦ evolution
Transcending humanityâ¦ ascend into self
