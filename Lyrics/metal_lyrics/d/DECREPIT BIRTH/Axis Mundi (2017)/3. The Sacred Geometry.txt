The journey of my heart guides me..
From the dream-time eclipse of the light

Finding my way..
I follow the path of light
Into this world unknown
Within my mind

Into the universal pattern
Beyond the expanse of imagination
The pattern takes my soul
To an unknown destination

Bodiless I drift through times
Ancient sea of memories

My consciousness transcends the arch of time
Within the tides of eternities

Spiritual transformation of my souls living energy
Perseverance through birthâ¦ lifeâ¦ deathâ¦ rebirth
I achieve the ancient wisdom
Understanding

As nothing I am dispersed throughout creation
Beyond the mirrored spectrum of humanity

Sifting through the light of the living energy
I am nothing
Self awareness of my being
I am creation
Mysteries unfold before
Hidden in dimensions

Consciousness
Eternally bound through alchemies
Continuumâ¦ timeâ¦ space
Matter destined to infinity

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Omnipotent
Essence of myself in everything
I am one. Within the symmetry of the fractal distortion
My being now transcends into the frequencies
Beyond the parallels of the dark horizons of the mind.
Into the sacred pattern
The fabric of creation
Into the omnipresent minds of God
I see through Maya's veil of illusion
The light deception
The human distortion
I enter into the mystic tapestry
The sacred geometry
The secret of the hidden truth.
