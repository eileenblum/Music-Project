Again the dawn draws nearer
And brings the fiery sky
The songbirds sing the earliest lullaby

I wish you will remember
When once you'll hear me cry
You'll have to, 'cause I'll never leave your side

Turn to black and disappear whenever she awakes
Wings just leave a shadow on her face
Beams so bright, it hurts my eyes and burns me from inside
Victim of the unjust tide of light

Each day I see you wonder, you wonder at my kind
Please be undaunted, shape is just a lie
The friend who was the liar, the wretch that brought you sleep
Oh, tempter let him burn each time I weep

Beams so bright, it hurts my eyes and burns me from inside
Victim of the unjust tide of light

I guard your sleep my dear
I implore you to forgive me
At the night's plutonian pier

"...And my soul from out that shadow
That lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted - nevermore"
[E. A. Poe - The Raven]
