The wideness of the air is my domain
Mine is the sky
Mine are the omniscient eyes
Brother of the tempest and the wind
Master of all
The Gates of Tenebra within

Fly up to the sky my dragon son
Storm and thunder guide your way, ablaze and shine
See with watchful eyes my dragon son
Keep in mind the oath of mine with truth and light

Once I was the victim of the greed
Cursed for all times
Thirsting for sky and light
Imprisoned by the gold beyond the gate
Until a bright
Beautiful beam lit my way

Rule with breath of fire my dragon son
Seek beyond Tenebra's sun the light of yours
Cry out for my name my dragon son
Trust the flame of mine for I will come

Fire is the throne of the night
Trust in thee, as my powers will rise
As we'll return, vengeance will burn
Scream through the night, that Tenebra will shine
