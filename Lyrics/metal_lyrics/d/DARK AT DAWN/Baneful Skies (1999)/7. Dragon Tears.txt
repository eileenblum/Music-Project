The words were spoken by wisdom's might
I've been cursed to leave the light
To dwell beyond the gates at darkest side
The treasure I have to preserve from you
Countless riches here do lie
And no one dares to challenge this power of mine

Let me fly to the sky once again
Let me chase through the clouds, across the land
Just one more time before I have to die

Now dragonslayer come forth from the light
I am yours, don't be afraid
I'm tired and old, take the gold beyond the gate
Just one thing promise me before you will
Kill me for your dignity
I will carry you far, the light is what I want to see

So let me fly to the sky once again
Let me chase on through clouds, across the land
Just one more time before I have to die
Let me take you up into the air
It's the last chance to cure my despair
The salvation for me in every way
It's only an emotion away
