Look above to stormswept skies
Towards the gates of Hades
I am drifting with the tide
On a path that candles light
I will follow your way
Reaching for your hand

A faithful desire - flames light the twilight
A star has died before my eyes
Through this storm of fire - as it falls upon me
In the endless shine

The light that beams only for me

Night will fall as I meet you within the light
And I laugh at the ruins of time
Go ahead through this passage and I will guide
This last starlight's return to the sky

Unknown powers guide my trail
Crawl beneath my skin
And rip apart the heart that failed
Gazing down on stormy grounds
Diabolic scenery
Where beyond our truth is found

Foretold and forgotten - like a word of wisdom
That a fool is pulling down
Beguiled by the rotten - that there's no more time
To turn the page and save the light...

...The light that beams only for me

So come down to waters wild
Take my hand and follow
As it's told, but never done
Just across this sunken shrine
Keeping candles burning
As your star by moonlight shines

Escape from debauchment - Diabolarch's laughing
Soon will ring his own demise
And on this horizon watch a fallen rising
Taking place by Venus' side
