Down in this valley, lost and obscure
Rivers are peaceful and shallow
I came this way on a sunny, bright day
Confounded by traces I followed
Did they return or never die
Were they not touched by the years that went by
Once broken eyes with this mighty disguise
See what all wicked survived

Hide in the sunset - Silva Mea
Screams in the night - lost ancient light
One with this forest - Silva Mea
The candle of time I blew out, this is mine

Farther and farther within this woods
Bloom the most beautiful flowers
Steps make no sound on this velvety ground
Where life's not depending on hours
Onward they fly, cross clearest skies
Power and beauty of wild, pounding life
Eternally free, towards paradise flee
Escaping from mortal men's eyes

And when the light of eternity falls
Bright eyes will blink from the shadows
Safe in the arms of this magical warmth
Tranquillity roams through the meadows
Out of the haze there stands amazed
By sparkling and glistening shimmer embraced
The overwhelmed son with the wisdom to come
To tell where the children have gone
