Moon, as thy silvery beam shapes my shadow
I see these signs on the wall I saw before
I should have known they'd return
Come to haunt me
Take all the tears that I've cried
Please forgive

The dark, the dark
Turn off the lights father
The storm, the storm
Just see the flame in my eyes
The dark, the dark
I see through all wisdom
The storm, the storm
Baneful skies

Gaze at the sinister sky, baneful visions
Clouds blessed with harmless disguise soon will fall
Providence's a friend of mine
From the ashes
Of my past life I will rise
...And return
