So before I'm gonna try
Your picture takes my last caress
I say goodbye
For uncertain is the way I take
So I will swallow this
Before I close my eyes

Eternal Life - awaken
Or will I fade - forsaken wine

Towards the shadows of my time
At the end I see it shine
Breaking a new day
Tumbling further through this gate
Fall through whispers that I've prayed
Onward into time

I still remember there was a light shining on the sea
Fire on the water and the silence in my darkened room
I do remember the words you said, you looked into my eyes
But you never saw the true colour by the mystic candlelight

Knowing that there is this way
The end ablazes the light of day
Future takes its shape
I prepare for your embrace
By approaching a disgrace
Sinister your face
