As the sky's a flame, he stood high upon that hill
Only him to blame, on his limbs this frozen chill
That calls on him, the glow's beyond these mountainsides
And creeps his skin, he prays for sun, he prays for light

Now he fears so deep the second coming of a day
Just to fall asleep, his skin still covered by the haze
That veils his eyes, and in the crimson light of dawn
His life's demise - a stillborn child there in his arms

[Chorus]
This son of mine - Take me
Broken his eyes - Break me
A life for a life - Freeze my heart beneath this new horizon...

As the sight grew clear, a sparrow glides from far above
For to touch so dear, oh, this tiny child, my love
A lifeblood's leave, as the beam caresses its wings
It sings the tune, calling lost life from deep within

[Chorus]

Taking this side for to give him some time - breaks a day
Changing a light is a barter of time - seals the way

[Chorus]
