Night's fallen, flesh's calling
spilling in the flood some tears of blood and agony
There on the beach lying
wasting and staining the sands of time indifferently

Stranded on the shores of life
The fish's kiss - it still remains unanswered

[Chorus]
Bathing in silence, yearning to swim
On a calm and quiet ocean
Urging to sin or to breathe with no motion
While hearing the sound of sweet violence

Torch-bearer's burned wings
firing all the arrows in a broken fantasy
Star's fallen, sand-crawling
Dropping just like jetsam from a lonely ship at sea

Stranded on the shores of life
The fish's kiss - it still remains unanswered

[Chorus]

Until the day's end's
a bitter wet bed seeking a soft place for a rest of my head
Tender the arms which embrace the brave
I am fallen asleep in a watery red.

[Chorus]
