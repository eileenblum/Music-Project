I walk this path in silence
A frozen dawn appears where I set my sight
Stare into the shadows' wideness
Past dreams that I can't freeze
To end this winter's night

Turning back to the west
What do I wait for? What do I wait for?
Just her eyes to look at?
What do I wait for? What do I wait for now?

Behold those inner mysteries
No back and forth, no step to left nor to right
You don't know what this gift means
I laid down by your side
Received this winter's night

Turning back once again
What do I wait for? What do I wait for?
Just forget to give in?
What do I wait for? What do I wait for now?

A golden dawn appears
She flies by my side
And leaves a frozen tear
...but just dreams in the night

Turning back once again
What do I wait for? What do I wait for?
Just forget to give in?
What do I wait for? What do I wait for now?

Staring to the secret in the west
Where to lay my weary head to rest...
