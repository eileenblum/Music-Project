Dawn - the opposite horizon's
Red - a bloody shimmering bloom

Far beyond this sky's
Flickering a light

[Chorus]
So I told the warning
It's a fading light in the shining
Darkness calls the dawning
As I'm longing forth to the endless

Blue - those eyes return to haunt me
Dreams - remembering the past

Far beyond these eyes
Somewhere dies a light

[Chorus]
