I knew one day the time would come
Returning to the place I've been so long
An island here, no boat on shore
To take me far away to unlocked doors

Alone I'll be, just darkness see
And endlessly the surge's song I'll hear
The winds will call, the night will fall
The sound of bell's toll's what I fear

Smiling in the sea
A face - is it me
When I look into the water
My mirror, mirror be
A face - is it me
When I look into and see
Is it me all around here?

Inside here stands the watered me
the tower's tortured toll rings at my ear
The windows' tears, the eyes are clear
outside appears the drowning sea

Smiling in the sea
A face - is it me
When I look into the water
My mirror, mirror be
A face - is it me
When I look into and see
That it's me all around here
