Walk through the mist at the awakening day
Threatening obscure dismal dark clouds my way

[Chorus]
Seducing whisper leads me down
To shallow seas in which to drown
Trapped within magic lullabies
Just as I heard his cursing cries

"Never see the day lit time
Dragon be, revenge is mine

You will forget what you once thought was yours
I'll take your shape and I will take her, too."

[Chorus]

The curse will last until you see
And break the chains of "never-free"

[Chorus]
