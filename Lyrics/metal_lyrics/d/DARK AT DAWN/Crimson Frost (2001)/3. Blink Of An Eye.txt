So please come in my friend, I welcome you
To the world within my dreams
Amidst this place I lie and pray for all
That your eyes could never see

And in this place I hide
As my world for fire turns
And keep the flame alive
Which for all my visions burns

[Chorus]
At day - The way's seen beyond a velvet sky
At night, so bright - far and wide a star goes by

I close the door my friend so you can see
What this world is all about
I see the stars from deep within my sleep
And no way to help me out

And still they shine for me
And slowly turn to ice
Still keep the flame in me
The light behind my eyes

[Chorus]

So here your visit ends
I held them in my hands - believe me
For the blink of an eye

[Chorus]
