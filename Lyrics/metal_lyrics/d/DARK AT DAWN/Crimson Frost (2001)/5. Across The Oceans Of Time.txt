I can't wait anymore
Crossed the oceans of time
Hoping once you'd be mine
One desire I keep - for you
And just one wish I pray
'Til the end of all days

You are the light, the brightest light
I had to bury down deep in my heart
After the gloaming waits for dawn
The only rose that can bloom in the dark

At first beam I could live again
Not just shadows could touch
Be as close as the dark
Heed the voice in the wind
And the first beam of light
Takes away gloomy nights

You are alive, you never died
Deep in my soul you're condemned to live on
The day I desire draws so near
Forces the flame in my veins to burn on

And if there's once a rose that blooms
Like your never fading beauty
The sword of mine is at her side
Across the wide oceans of time

Come to me to carry what was lost
Roam through daytime grey
So long a search still going on
I came to claim what just belongs to me...
just to me...
