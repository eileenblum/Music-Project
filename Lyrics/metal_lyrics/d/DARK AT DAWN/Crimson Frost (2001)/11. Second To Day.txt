Pictures of the past
Memories which never last
Within a moment's time
The blinking of an eye
To oblivion they turn and there remain

[Chorus 1]
When there is nothing I can remember now today
All my faults and mistakes will be forgiven
Then for me grows a second to day
The lifetime of hours

Faster flies a day
In seconds years are gone away
To minds which can't divide
As Lethe's flowing stream
Future from yester days

[Chorus 2]
When there is nothing I can remember now today
All my faults and mistakes will be forgiven
Then there rises a second today
But the lifetime of ours is fading away

The presence of the Now
Nothing to obey and bow
To time noone attends
The turning of the clock
A circle of no meaning ends

[Chorus 2]
