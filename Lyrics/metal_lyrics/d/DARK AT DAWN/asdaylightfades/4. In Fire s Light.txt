Last cry, defeated now's my soul
First lie had sealed the fate of mine
I pray to whom it may concern
A final tear, I leave the light

Now you will pay me the price
In the way I have payed for your lies
In disguise now my face I'd to turn
And I laugh as I'm watching you burn

Good-bye, false friends I need no more
Farewell, and look into my eyes
You tried, but I will give you more
I haunt your dreams, take you away

Look out, noone can judge my deeds
Disgust to taste the blood you bleed
Your soul, a cripled piece I love
To see you rot in fire's light
