Save your words for someone who cares
I already know more than I can bear
Crave for silence, speaking with violent voices
I wish they were so noiseless like the night

[Chorus:]
The loneliest decision of my life
Beyond all borders of your time
Endless freedom will be mine
The final peace that I long for
Through all waters brought me here
To the island of no fear

Fly without wings, suffer the last pain
Which seems to be so strangely short
See without eyes a place I have never been before
I feel like being home in the distance unknown

[Chorus]
