Waiting for years in the endless and dark of the night
For the morning light
Heavenâs beside us, storm clouds to guide us again
Coming for your bane, eternal

[Chorus:]
Unholy trinity, five of the storm
Seven to die, one to live on
Brothers of fire come back again
Taking the world with a lightning rain

You take the scars, I take whatâs yours
Thatâs what our mission is for
And I weep for you
Drying my tears with the silk that you brought
How can I ever repay?
Thankful is my smile, eternal

[Chorus]

Some of our beasts, taking the east, never will come back again
Some of our friends take what remains, follow the others in flames
Some of our best, taking the rest, right by the starlight theyâre slain

[Chorus]
