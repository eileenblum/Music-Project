Oppressive heat is lying over wasted fields
No breath of wind is in the air
Songs of cicadas supersede the battle cries
Curing the sorrow and despair

Merciless sun is burning from the clear blue sky
The smell of oil and tarnished metal
A fag and spirits telling memories of home
Lulling the fear of the next battle

[Chorus:]
Field-gray Nazi booty
Goners for the glorious duty
Hopes and dreams defending narcissistic zeal

Tin hat parade gleaming
Still to hear the fallen screaming
Blood will rust resplendent decoration steel

Bloodcurdling sounds of war - reality returns
Behind the lines the Flaks are roaring
Smoke columns fed with ended lives and shattered dreams
With us the hopes of victory are soaring (into the sky)

[Chorus]
