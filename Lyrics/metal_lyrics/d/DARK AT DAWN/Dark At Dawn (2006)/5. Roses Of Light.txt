[Chorus:]
Roses of light
Gleaming again this time
Beaming so bright
Breathing but freezing
Feeling so right

Seems to me as if there was this light
Just to be a fire in the night
To light a long long way from home

[Chorus]

Still I see this fire burning bright
To be free, to be there by your side
Follow this long long way back home

[Chorus]

Flying, like winds I will be flying
These words I will be feeling, freezing
Feeling so right
Like roses in the night

Seems to me as if there was this light
To be free, to be there by your side
To light this long long way back home

[Chorus]
