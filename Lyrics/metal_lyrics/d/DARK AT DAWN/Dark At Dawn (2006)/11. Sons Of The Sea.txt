Onward above stormy waters we fly
Shoulder to shoulder, rejoicing her might
Ages to come to sing this song

[Chorus]
Nothing can take it from me
We are the sons of the sea
Tossing above and beyond
These northern lights flaming on

Drinking with laughter an joining our hands
Youâre where it starts and youâre where it ends

[Prechorus]
Mother, we sing to thee
Raging so wild and free
Riding your waves and be
A guiding hand for me
Ages to come to sing this song

[Chorus]

Winds in our hair and salt in our face,
Honey and milk at the end of our race
Only live on to sing this song

[Chorus]

We are the ones to look up to the sky
And we are the ones that you take with your tide

[Prechorus]
[Chorus]
