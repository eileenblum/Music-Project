Hot in here, deliveranceâs so far, as it fades away
Breathing in, leave the line
Nowâs the time I think I have to start, in the early day
So I go down the walkâ¦ good bye

Motorsâ breath, the beating of my heart, soon Iâll see the way
Thereâs a lightsâ shine so warm
Crashing in first gear, throttle down, blasting roars to stray
Come to take me away

[Chorus:]
Thereâs a road to eternity
Where the things are like they gotta be
Thereâs a flame in my heart, as Iâm rolling this path
Thereâs a feeling thatâs gonna last

Speeding through the desert, raging on, pounding all the way
Thereâs no crossroad to pass
Oh my light wait for me, Iâll come in time you see
To my last finish line, the last time

[Chorus]

Running, speeding and flying
Living, lowing and dying

[Chorus]
