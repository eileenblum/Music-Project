Down the road
Thatâs paved with broken dreams
On my own
In darkness filled with silent screams
Waiting for
The coachman and his Guards
To carry me away

âI welcome you my son
So take a seat and see
What your life ought to be
Weâre heading for your destiny
Take up the challenge now
And let your journey end
Weâll fan the inner flame of yours my friendâ

[Chorus:]
Painful - the truth
In all my visions
Dreadful - the hate
That poisons my mind
Deep inside my soul
Fire is growing - soon to take control

Down the road
Thatâs bounded by despair
Faster and faster
Rushing through a night so fair
Longing for
Redemption of my soul
To light my lonely way

âPrepare yourself my son
The terminus is near
Dismount and face the fear
