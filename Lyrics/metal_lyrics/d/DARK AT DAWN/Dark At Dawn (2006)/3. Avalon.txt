Thereâs a circle of mist
Hanging high on that hill
And a flowerly breath
Keeps it silent and still
And on and on we go
To hear the old vintage melody

Thereâs a hole in the sky
Thereâs a needle of stone
To this top we will fly
Thereâs a bringer of hope
Avalon

So we walk this old trail
Kept by spells of a time
Which is on to prevail
And remain the last line
So weâre the ones to keep
This for long time waiting symphony

And we walk through this time
Like we know whereâs the light
But all knowledge is lost
In the still of the night

Insist on freedom
Long lasting words
Time heals the wounded
But sometimes it hurts
