The mist covers the trees and flowers
With wet eyes I stand here and stare
Alone I'll find my way in the darkness
Longing to fly through the air

The wave swallows my cries and laughter
Just part of the sea are my tears
When I'll swim through the wildest oceans
Drowning is my only fear

All the beauty I see
It won't last eternally
No more beauty to see
And the world is empty

The wind covers all tracks of me
On hot sand I walk through the night
As stars seem to sear me in the desert
A dream it is to my delight

Don't tell me that
All the beauty I see won't last eternally
When there's
No more beauty to see, then the world is empty
