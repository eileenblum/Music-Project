[Warlord cover]

Deliver us from Evil this day
Deliver us from Evil today

Deliver us from all the wicked
Deliver us from the woe
Free, these chains of hell
and now's the time to strike the final blow

One by one, to the swords, to the guns!
Two by two, and away we go
Father and Son, heed the words we pray
Deliver us from Evil this day
Deliver us from Evil today

Deliver us from ill minded rulers
Deliver us from all their talk
See all the evil and the greed
These people that seek what they've lost

One by one, to the swords, to the guns!
Two by two, and away we go
Father and Son, heed the words we pray
Deliver us from Evil this day
Deliver us from Evil today

Prepare for the final awakening
Prepare for the time it has come
Look to the heavens! a crack in the sky
The ending of time has begun
. . . and now all that you have is gone . . .

Deliver us from all the hatred
Deliver us from all the sin
and we who believe will eternally sing
these words in which we call the battle hymn!

One by one, to the swords, to the guns!
Two by two, and away we go
Father and Son, heed the words we pray
Deliver us from Evil this day
Deliver us from Evil today
Deliver us from Evil . . . we pray!
