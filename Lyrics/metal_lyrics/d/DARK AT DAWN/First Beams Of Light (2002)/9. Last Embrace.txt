I never did before, they'll never know myself
Can't feel like me
I never lived before, how could they understand?
Don't want to die

You have seen me from inside

Why do you love yourself?
Stand, wait another day
The hate, alive

I want to see you from inside

"I don't care what you want,
Not your property,
Come on and hate me for the things
I will never regret."

Why can't I forget?
Perhaps I don't want to forget
The sky gets overcast

I am going to die...

"I don't care what you think,
Not your destiny
Leave me and hate me for the things
I will never regret."

So listen to me now!
This world is not made for you!
Past is never ever again! Time is now!!
