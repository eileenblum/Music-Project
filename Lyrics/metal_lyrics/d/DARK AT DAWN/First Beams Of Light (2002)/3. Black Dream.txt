I have a dream, it's a dream of...

The timeless hours we spent in
The blackness of your eyes makes me
The silence in spite of your eternal
The fire, show me your brightness

Out there, here we stand
In the darkness of the night
Out there, each of us
Is trying to hide away from light

The endless looks you give will widen
Horizons, never see the end of them
The shadows of reality's gone
The bottomless, beyond all boundaries

The coldness of this vacuum
The outer space and its fascination
The alcohol takes my last discretion
And you, black dream, we'll meet again tomorrow

Timeless silence, endless horizons
Coldness, alcohol,
You are my black dream
