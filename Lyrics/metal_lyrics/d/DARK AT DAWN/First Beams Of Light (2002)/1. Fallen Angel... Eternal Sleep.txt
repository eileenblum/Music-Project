"Holy One, speak for me the words of truth."
"Live your dream because your last sleep is eternal."

I don't want to talk, I can't stand this anymore
Take me to the skies, fallen angel - evil undisguised

Carry the light, you are playing with fire
Burn - the west is where you shall dwell

Take the shape and colour of your shadow
and then the light fades
one day you'll look into the mirror and see a figure full of emptiness

Nothing is more than you are...

Fallen angel, I don't want to talk to you
Fallen angel, I can't stand you anymore

I wear the cloak of silence even when the sun doesn't shine
And it won't rain in winter...but you are not blind

Fallen angel - Risen One
Now I will never know who he was

My second spring when the leaves fall off the trees
In my prime as the flowers wither
Save me from myself, myself

You are much too superficial to see that I'm not the one
I pass myself off for

It's not the talking, it's the understanding
Don't think, reflect
