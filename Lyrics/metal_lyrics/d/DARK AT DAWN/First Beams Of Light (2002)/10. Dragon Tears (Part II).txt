Now as we're flying across the sky
Despair's dying as noone lies, winds let us go
Storm, through we're chasing with mighty wings
Deep salvation I feel within
I never did know
That all gold of the earth lies on a dragon's back
A power that I can't deny

So watch us as we fly on, ride to the horizon
Freedom and eternity
Far away up high, the mortal world aside
Believe me just what you can't see

Clouds, endless blue of eternity
Can't believe this but I can see
Overwhelmed by this power

Wish I could do this all again
But my time is slipping away
There breaks my last hout

Whoever would have thought that I could see this all again
So grateful I had never been

Now you can kill me, I am prepared
Saw what I wanted, thankful I am

My sword remains dry now, I did understand
You showed me riches I can't hold in my hand
And tell me the man who can call a dragon a friend

So let us fly to the sky once again
Let us chase through the clouds across the land
And noone hears a lie until we have to die

Let us rise again into the air
This was the last chance to cure all despair
The salvation for me in all ways
It's only an emotion away, let us fly

We fly again
