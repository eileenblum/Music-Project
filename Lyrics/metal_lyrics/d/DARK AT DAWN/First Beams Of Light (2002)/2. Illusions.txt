Don't matter, honey, if you are dead
Most time you've already spent in bed
Your search hast just reached my call
The answer doesn't wait there at all

My deepest wishes take their form
In dreams the future is confirmed
The prediction of the uncertainty
Has never failed its unknown target

The emotions have jsut gone through my head
Amnesia possibly may stay
Knowing how to make someone
Amenable's nearly everything

Illusions of yesterday - tomorrow's reality?
Today's memories of forgotten times

Imaginations fly to the sky
Clearing my mind of the thoughts I've tried
To think seems as a normal word
But have you really ever tried?
