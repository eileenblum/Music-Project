Trapped in a cage all their lives
Death is salvation, the last spark of hope in their eyes
White God created them all
To perish for beauty and colours of arrogance

Lack of emotion for life
The hands of their hangmen are grabbing with hard grip of death
Screaming in wildness and pain
No chance to escape, executed for mankind's survive

Do you want to get rid of it?
Try to and see you can't flee from your shadow
Remove now the veil from your eyes
Creator of horror, your mirror tells truth from your lies
