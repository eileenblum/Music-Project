Please tell me if they are true
The tales and the legends we're told
Happened in ancient times
We don't know where they belong
Tales of creatures unknown
Of things we don't see are they lies?

[Chorus]
Before the dawn of time - when legends all were born
Before the dawn of time - awaiting the first breath
Before the dawn of time - is there anything we've lost
Before the dawn of time - are we allowed to judge the past

While we're searching for proves
All mankind will come to an end
Can't we learn from our mind
When fantasy takes command
Do we have to decide
What's good and what's insanity?

[Chorus]

Can we tell for sure
That nothing exists we don't see
Do we know all the powers
That are between heaven and earth
We've now found the one true explanation
That's killing the creed

[Chorus]
