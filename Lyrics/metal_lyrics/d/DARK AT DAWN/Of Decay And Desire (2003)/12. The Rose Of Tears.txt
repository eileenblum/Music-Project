Futures' light
Shines upon us
In a rainy night
Only one
Little answer
Hides behind your velvet eyes
Lack of love
Doesn't hinder
Men from doing what they please
But just one
Little answer
Tells a victory from defeat

Smile for me, my rose of tears

You're fading on my mind
Be the one to guide me home
Or leave me far behind
Shine on through like fadings stars
But slowly is the light
Before we see their flame has died
A thousand years go by

In my eyes

Is the colour
Of the lake, we were so near
Let me tell
You my secret
The water in it were my tears
