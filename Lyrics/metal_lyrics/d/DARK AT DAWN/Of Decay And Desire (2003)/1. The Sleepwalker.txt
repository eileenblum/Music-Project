On and on
Creeping through my mind
A siren's song, a guiding light
Rainy nights
Fading in the wind
Imprisoned there, in dreams within

There is a way

There is an aim
There is a light
An angel's voice still guides me
Through a winter's night
See her soul is far too clear
To take a grip, just feel her slip
And fade away

Nightly shades

Taking my embrace
A ghostly touch, still warm to me
The lesson's dark
But I now know why
Asleep I smile, awake I die
