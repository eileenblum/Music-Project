On the edge of dawn
Light ends the dark of day
Mourning star at dusk
Brightens with our decay
Forward, just one step
Millions of miles away
Floating back in time
Titans without delay

Wellspring of youth

Drinking your sweet water
Falling like stones - so bitter our tears
Of the one and only truth
Well, you're my fountain
For some you're deep as graves
For others high as mountains

Neverending youth

Aching like Narcissus
Echo sings her song
Whispering words like "Come with us"
Never to return
Hope, in all tears she's bathed
Bleeding hearts of pain
Nigh tend to be portrait
