Dry river-beds end in no man's land
Empty oceans full of waste
We lead ourselves into all man's end
All that remains is a bitter aftertaste
The sea has shed all she had to cry
A shoreless wail which came here to die
Just like an eagle in the sky
I want to spread my wings and fly away

Crying silence is falling over me

Lonely king of the air in deserted skies
How I wish that the end like this wouldn't be
Clipped wings before they learned to fly
Each drop of life spilled into the flood
Acid tears in sweet rain like red raining blood
We're trying to water from deep within
The desert sands of time with our weeping

One with the rain

Feeling the pain
Of the earth I am lain
In sane dreams I drown
Mankind sowed bitter seed
Expects to harvest fruits so sweet
For a thirsty mouth to feed
Insane kingdom's crown
