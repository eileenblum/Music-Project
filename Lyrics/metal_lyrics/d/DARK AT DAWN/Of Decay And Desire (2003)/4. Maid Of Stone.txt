Fade away, my love
Under painful clay
Deep in the desert
Where no mortal's ever set foot
There she is lain
With a rose in her mouth and her hand
Into the voidness
Her sandy hair without colour, for good?

I've been praying, Lord,

Since she's left me
So all alone in the darkness
Guardian made of stone,
Won't you answer
My prayers for her coming home
My dear, please speak to me
Beloved, answer me
Give me a sign to rely on
I know you still hear me
Even you cannot see me
On my knees, don't deny me

Lifeless womb

Her grave, a pyramidal tomb
Crying and praying
That her leaving the light was no end
Then it awoke
After hours and days
And then spoke the rose made of stone
"Who loves shall be never alone."

I've been praying, Lord,

Since she's left me
So all alone in the darkness
Guardian made of stone
Gave me answers to
My prayers for her coming home
My dear, she spoke to me
Beloved, answered me
Gave me a sign to rely on
I know you still hear me
Singing sad melodies
For this rose-water's accompany
