By sharing what's divine
You don't become an angel
The devil's got many faces
All looking into mine
A man among the beasts
A sheep among the wolves
How could there be light
When darkness never sleeps?

As long as there is man

There must be a devil
In female-looking form
To lead them in temptation
From the first sin done by Eve
To the last and nameless night
How could there be hope
When darkness never sleeps?

One man stands, another falls

And leaves by morning light
Another nameless night
Who resists when frailty calls?
Thy name is woman
...and the one-night curtain falls
