In Fire
She's waiting
To turn the ice away
A liar
Is saving
Up on the mountains of pain
Warrior of light be silent
Rule the earth is meant to be
I am here to reign in violence
For my eyes are of ice

Fighter

Bringing the light to the sky
Warrior
Crashing through the gates of icy times
For she'll return to the bright
For a sign
Coming from a kingdom once defied

This scenery

Is aching
Her limbs in silent frost
On fire
Her eyes melt
Showing the world that was lost
Warrior of light be silent
Rule the earth is meant to be
I am here to reign in violence
I might fade, but never die
