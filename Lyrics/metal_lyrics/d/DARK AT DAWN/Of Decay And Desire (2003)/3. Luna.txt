His silver sun is shining bright at night
To enlighten his way from dusk 'til dawn
The Goddes of all stars
Dressed in her cold black dress
Her rays of light - alike a rose's thorn

Melting her eyes with fire and heat

Ere daylight's disguise her beauty conceals
Goddes of the dark, please shine on me
Let my eyes touch and let them see
What the night can reveal

Still I adore you a lot, from above

Mistress of darkness divine
Whispers "carpe noctem" with a heavenly shine
To see her in a way she is not
...is to love
