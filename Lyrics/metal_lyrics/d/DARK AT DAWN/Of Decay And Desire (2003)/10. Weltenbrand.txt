Drowning in fire where it never rains
Burning desire has all the waters drained
Waves of the flood leave the world in flames
Soil's boiling blood and flashes strike his son's wain

Flesh and thunder and blood and lightning

Sol et Nox in heavens hot they feast
Flesh and thunder and blood and lightning
By the eyes of the Gods the night is seized

Taming the horses, impossible to steer

Flaming -the passion- rides into his bane
For all who can see soon it will peer
Doomsday will be, showing the sun's wane
My world is on fire, the heat is my domain
Like suns, even brighter if I don't draw the rein
In fervour I shall sear to swallow all the pain
Souls unite in tears, forever there to reign
