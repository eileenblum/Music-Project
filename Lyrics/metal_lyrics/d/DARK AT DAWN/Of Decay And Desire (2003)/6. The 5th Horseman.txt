Here take this guiding hand
I lead you through this land and far below
Your journey here might end
Just trust a good old friend, the way he shows
Although it's getting cold
Don't doubt the way you go, I'm here for you
You better close your coat
You're risking a bad throat, don't want you to

Four bad seasons

Way I know
Guiding treason
Way I show

The riders over there

Already brought them where they do belong
So gather with these guys
You fit to very nice - another one

Meet them greet them

Brothers five
Growing stronger
Still alive
