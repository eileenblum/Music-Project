The world is turning
The sky is burning
It's weeping down
Frozen leaves lie bare
The sun is watching
Eternal morning
Is hiding there
Beyond the crimson flames
...until the crimson flame of

Eternity is watching me

It shines forever endlessly
Just like your light within my heart
Forever
There are some things that never pass
These are the things that ever last
Just like your light within my heart
Forever

The water's drowning

The waves are sounding
They scream to me
The rush of fading hope
I stand here gazing
It's still amazing
How one could reign
A kingdom's long lost halls
...until the crimson flame of
Still right here waiting for a passed by voice
