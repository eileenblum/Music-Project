From the abyss of wild east sands
Come the trouble which nobody waits
Pain and cries from that day never ends
The Golden Horde come forever to stay

The millions of hearts burn in hate
Their will to win never to stop
There's no place to run no escape
From the Golden Horde's arrows &amp; swords

Fire everywhere can see the eye
Just smoke &amp; blood you can smell
You can hear only suffering cries
And your life coming to livin' hell

Burn the cities burn the towns, time of Golden Horde has come
Left the countries burn to ash, they will take just gold &amp; cash
Forever to take place... forever, forever stays
In our lands, in our towns, in our children, in our blood
