Nothing moves in the air you can't find someone near
Must forget all thoughts, must forget all dreams
It's not only seems in the name of one
Morgoth'll die by sun, comin' (in) next by war

In the name of myst, in the river's twist
Where the clouds are low blackened water flow
Somehow you will know: End of time will show
Surrounded by seven stones in the morning dew grows

The great flower of Northern lands; so we have to find the place
Where we'll get the power of Great flower of Northern lands.
