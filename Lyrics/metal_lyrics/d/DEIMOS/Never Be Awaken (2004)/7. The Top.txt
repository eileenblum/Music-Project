On the top of the hill, there's someone who waits for you
Since your life just began, he's watching over you
And when you feel sick and tired, just let him take you home
His all-seeing eye... will watch above

On the top of the hill there's stormy winds and snow
Nature forces unknown are play there to make hill grow
To the clouds and above where someone waits his time
To make free mother earth, &amp; enslave the humankind

On the top of the world there's God and Devil fights
Fights for those who believe that they're almighty
...And sun send it's rays for those who know the truth
For those who carry it's fire, who run life through.

On the top of the hill, there's someone who waits for you
Since your life just began, he's watching over you
And when you feel sick and tired, just let him take you home
His all-seeing eye... will watch above
