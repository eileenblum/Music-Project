I'm a guardian, I'm a guardian at the gates of witchery
I'm the envoy, I'm the envoy of unhuman nature
I'm searching, I'm searching for the eyes of enemy
'til the dawn come, 'til the dawn come I will stand immortally.

People pushing at my side
Less than pity live their lives.

Mighty armies, mighty armies coming to invade our land
Countless millions, countless millions trampling ground under feet
Stony souls, stony souls ain't got nothing to defeat
Empty handed, empty handed their will turn back in their home.
