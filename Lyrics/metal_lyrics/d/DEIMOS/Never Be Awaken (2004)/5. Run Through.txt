Storm rise - in velvet skies last thunder
In flashes of light lays Earth paralysed
Reality fades in apocalyptic visions
Very last day of mankind

There's no glory without loss
It's everlast wisdom that buried in minds
Forgotten by people that make the war
Let blood flow telling words of god,

Storm rise - in velvet skies last thunder
In flashes of light lays Earth paralysed
Reality fades in apocalyptic visions
Very last day of mankind

There's no price to pay for all
For countless sins that now covered by time
Struggle with evil will evermore last
'til foremost sun will wipe the tears,

Storm rise - in velvet skies last thunder
In flashes of light lays Earth paralysed
Reality fades in apocalyptic visions
Very last day of mankind

Setting... in morrowless souls
Condemned to keep the core of the evil
Like blind in a wasteland we run through the life
Awaiting the day when the truth will rise.
