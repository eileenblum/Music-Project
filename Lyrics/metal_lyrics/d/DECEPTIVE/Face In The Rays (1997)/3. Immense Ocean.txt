The blue planet.
Why is it called Earth.
We rose from the depth of the ocean.
We inhaled the smell of the ground.

The immense ocean.
It's all that's possible to see.
The immense ocean.
Its waves implacable flee.

We subdued the nature of fire.
Its anger was so great.
The ocean... Sometime it will put an end to our lives.
But we send to it a challenge.
Who subdued the fire will subdue the water.

The immense ocean.
Cold water on the coastal sand.
The immense ocean.
Its salt covered my hand.
The immense ocean.
Its power compels to stop the breath.
The immense ocean.
Cradle of life and the abyss of death.

Rage of the flame, tranquility of the ice.
We destroy it and destroy ourselves.

The immense ocean.
The immense ocean.
The immense ocean.
Its power compels to stop the breath.
Oh!!! Immense ocean.
I see your dying face.
