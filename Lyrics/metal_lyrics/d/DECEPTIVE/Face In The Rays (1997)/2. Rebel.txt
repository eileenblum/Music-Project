War!
This is my profession.
Destroy that against us.
Hey!  I'm a rebel,
But I don't know, really don't know
What I must die for?

I don't care about public values.
I believe only in our leader.
We have been bounded
By oath in blood,
But I don't know, really don't know
What I must die for?

Throw the seeds, the seeds of evil.
The spout of hate will never fade.
We are descendants of the old revolutions.
We have been out of law
Under any system.

Blood!
Our banners in blood.
Torches light our way
Screams deafen me,
But I don't know, really don't know.
What I must die for? What I must die for?

Hey!
Victims of tomorrow,
Let's spit in face of the bastard's regime.

Hey!
Victims of tomorrow,
Let's spit in face of the bastard's regime.
We believe in fast retribution.
Who personifies the truth?
It's too wrong to make it right.
