Let's put the sleeping travelers
To their romantic dreams.
They are flying to the fiery towers,
Driving by the ruthless North winds.

They who saw the bleeding stones
On the way to the kingdom of lies
Should never return
To the tower of wisdom.
This is the twilight land
Of the drifting mist.

Kingdom of lies,
Kingdom of my fantasies.
Kingdom of lies,
Kingdom of my fantasies.

The birds burnt in the sky
Would tell about this land,
About the boundless valleys,
Covered by their ashes.

There I left my heart.
Whatever I do,
I can't take it back.
No way.

Never repent.
Tolerable pain.
Intolerable light.
Again and again
The blessed night...

The time when I'll die
Is becoming visible on the golden plate.
But It isn't perceptible yet,
And I'm setting free my hate!
But It isn't perceptible yet,
And I'm setting free my hate!
