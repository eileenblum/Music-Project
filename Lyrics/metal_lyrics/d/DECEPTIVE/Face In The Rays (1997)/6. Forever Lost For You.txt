You can't have your own judgments.
You are surrounded by unmerciful people.
And you turned away from friends.
Around yourself you erected the walls.

You portrayed the fated empire,
Mankind dipped in terror.

But your oil paintings are destroyed by fire
And damned by the old emperor.
The watercolours turned to ice.
Canvas distorted in pain.

It's so simple to be lost
In the forest of dreams
Entering through window
After the celestial princess.

It's possible to take a look to the sphere of Earth
And to paint the picture of world.
It looks like a tiny living pearl,
Wrapped up in the black velvet of death.

A stare from the canvas.
Someone keeps an eye beyond the gigantic window,
He creates the paints of various shades.
He is who is transforming these windows.

It's so simple to be lost
In the forest of dreams
Entering through window
After the celestial princess.
In the cold crystal clear eternity
I'm forever lost for you.

It has happened, the elusive substitution
Of "Tales of life" instead "Novel of obscurity".
On the dome of heaven appears the new constellation,
Resurrected by the great infinity.

It's so simple to be lost
In the forest of dreams
Entering through window
After the celestial princess.
In the cold crystal clear eternity
I'm forever lost for you.
