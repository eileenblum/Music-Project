Inherit the nightmares - can't put them to sleep
Rainstorm of chaos awaiting release
Speaking the truth - considered a crime
A world with murder on its mind

Believe; be deceived - a wound never closing
We're racing the rats - humanity's losing
Under the gun of a nation imploring
Machine infected system controlling

In the casket garden
Bonewhite, bloodred
In the casket garden
Dealing with the dead

The blaming days are over - too late
Falling into the arms of hate
Witness the execution of mind
Feeding another killing kind

In the casket garden
Bonewhite, bloodred
In the casket garden
Dealing with the dead
In the casket garden
Spiders in the web
In the casket garden
Just hate and tread
