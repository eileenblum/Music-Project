Lieproducing, crime-saluting
Humiliating, segregating
Life-eating, gun-feeding
Hypocrisy, society

Warscene overcrowded
Loss of civil liberties
Life spilled like blood
Misanthropical atrocities

Warmachine is discipline
Furiously killing clean
The power addiction
A lethal infliction

Raped by bullets
Innocent dead
Evidence elimination
Strategy spread

Wardead through bloodshed
Face-up, forgotten corpses unburied

Wardead
