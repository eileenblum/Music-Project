Agonized terrified horrified
Emotions brutalized
Crucified nailed to the cross
With spikes through my hands
I shall die upon this cross
All by myself
Salvations lost
Soon to be dead

Consider me as another victim
Of their plans
But my choice
Is not your jesus christ
Now I'm dead alone and
Rotting on this cross
But I'll be back

Hell is what I want
Hell is what I get
In the fires I'll burn
But there's nothing I'll regret

Hell awaits me
My soul is raped
I will get them I will kill them
At the end of time
As long they are free
Preaching their shit
I'll never find peace
