The day of insanityextending like a dream, the outcast of any tribe is king
Generations drowned in self-indulgence and deceit, mass suicide the liberating end
New gods will be born and killed to live again, religion as it's finest being breached
Monstrous conclusion breaks the surface all to late, heaven as the know it out of reach
God-fearing, despairing, each prayer a human grave
Armed and content with the battlefield laid out, delivering the bitter blow
When darkness is tyrant, never see the light, pay tribute to the overlord
As the body count is done and surviving priests dispatched, a martyr's nightmare begins
Atheism made out of divine neglect, on the side of angels unveiling the fiend
Fluid system of hatred made flesh, take the consequence of revelations
Godless god knows when, fail to evolve while chasing the serpent
Shallow and ashen the foundation of souls
Hollow existence, victimized and scorned
