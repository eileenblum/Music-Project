All these years I've stayed faithful
Through bitterness I've bled
Sacrifice, betrayal and deceit, has rid me of the weak
Tragedy of the faithful, dying for a lost cause
Tragedy of the faithful, loyalty unto death
At the mercy of the vengeful
Mislead and betrayed
Through darkness and misery
I've walked the bloodstained path
Tragedy of the faithful
So many has fallen
Tragedy of the faithful
Loyalty unto death
