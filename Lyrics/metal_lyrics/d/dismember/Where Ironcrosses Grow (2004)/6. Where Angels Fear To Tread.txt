War birds fly in tight formation, across the blackened sky
A thousand engines roar, tremors of the approaching storm
One man's insanity, revenge and retribution
Steel birds fat and laden with death, their bellies open wide
Commence to unleash a fiery death, upon the defenseless target
A thousand souls screaming in pain as incendiary bombs detonate
The smell, phosphor and petrol mix with the stench of burning flesh
Firestorms rage across the city, even the air seems to be aflame
The howl of air-raid sirens drowns the screams of pain
Non-combatants pay a bloody toll, whole city blocks disappear
Damnation and a raging inferno, destruction is complete.
