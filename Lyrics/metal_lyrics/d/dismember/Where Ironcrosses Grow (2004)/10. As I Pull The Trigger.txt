What are these visions that trouble my weakened mind
Haunt my fevered dreams and dance before my wide awake eyes
Visions of death a murder, ravaged figures in pain
People dead and buried, filling my head with fear
Demons and shadows tear my world apart, shredding my sanity to pieces
Screaming in horror, crying in fear, my living nightmare never ends
Now I've realized it will never end
I'll do whatever it takes to send them out of my head
Goodbye to the world
Cannot find final words
The dark shadows disappear
As I pull the trigger
