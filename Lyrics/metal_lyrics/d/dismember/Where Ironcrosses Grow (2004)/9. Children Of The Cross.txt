A thousand deaths I've seen, my mind is scarred beyond repair
Don't really care if I survive this life of mental despair
Lies, lies, see the madness in their eyes
Children of the cross, lost on the path of the dead
Undead my savior, from tomb to womb I folow thee
Stigmatized, crucified, I bleed my ife unto you
Seeking the source, of the dark I've become
Hatred and soul is now one
Killing the source of the light I despise
Hatred and life is now one
