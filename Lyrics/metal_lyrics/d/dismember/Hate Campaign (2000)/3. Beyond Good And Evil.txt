[Music by : Sahlgren, Blomqvist. Lyrics by : K?rki]

Through the ages from the dawn of man
We always searched for deity
Forming legends and twisted beliefs
Paranoia and selfdeceit

Sell your soul to the highest bidder
Fooled by stories of life beyond
Losing grip of reality
You are living in a dream

Beyond good and evil
Is where you find the way
Salvation and saviour
To your miserable lives

Sycophants awaiting judgement day
Watching the skies for the third coming
Live their lives prepare for the event
Let them rot it will never happen

Lost in madness and insecurity
Devour the flesh of your saviour
Drink the blood and slowly fade away
Now you are truly astray

Beyond good and evil
Two sides of the same coin
Enslavement and damnation
Deny man's sickest creation

[Lead: Blomqvist]
[Lead: Sahlgren]

Beyond good and evil
Your spirit will live on
Free from religious slavery
Prosper and grow strong

Beyond good and evil
