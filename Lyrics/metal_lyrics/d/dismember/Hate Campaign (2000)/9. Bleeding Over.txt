[Music by : Estby. Lyrics by : Estby]

A reality blown open wide
Bruising the minds of millions
Serpent of war hovering vast
Demanding increase of missiles
Finalizing begging eyes
Proud and distinguished
A human life worth nothing more
Than the myth of a martyrs terror call

An unavoidable definition
Of a primetime killing mission
After action, knife in hand
Still not able to understand
It's bleeding over

Creator of the most
Vicious circles of all
Religious madness holy war
Bringing on the human downfall
Soultrading servants
Where money is taken as lies
Shut your eyes, march on blind
Led by selfacclaimed gods

An unavoidable definition
Of a primetime killing mission
After action, knife in hand
Still not able to understand
What difference does it make
If god or satan pulls the trigger
Still it's bleeding over

Becoming one with the fraction
Victims of so called legal action

[Lead: Blomqvist]

Apocalyptic executions
Brought on by fanatic revolution

[Lead: Sahlgren]

Give in for eternity
To your saviour insanity

An unavoidable definition
Of a primetime killing mission
After action, knife in hand
Still not able to understand
What difference does it make
If god or satan pulls the trigger
Still it's bleeding
