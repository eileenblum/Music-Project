[Music by : Estby, K?rki. Lyrics by : K?rki]

Auschwitz infamous labor camp
Realm of the living dead
Systematic method of destruction
A thousand souls ablaze

And as they die
Jews, Gypsies and Homosexuals
Learn that "Arbeit macht frei"

Brutally effective
High efficency murder industry
Removing the unproductive
To achieve the aryan objective
Weeding out the worthless
Eradication of the unwanted
No mean too extreme
To keep the Reich clean

And as they die
Cripples, Retards and Criminals
Learn that "Arbeit macht frei"

Brutal acts of infamy
Never fading memories
Sadistic hate campaign
In the pages of history

[Lead: Sahlgren]

Feed the fires with the unworthy
Purity decides their fate
Victims of Nazi science suffer
Even to this day

And as they die
Victims of the holocaust
Learn that "Arbeit macht frei"
