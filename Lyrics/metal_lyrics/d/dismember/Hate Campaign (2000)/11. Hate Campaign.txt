[Music by : K?rki, Blomqvist. Lyrics by : K?rki, Estby, Sahlgren]

I talked with God today
He was feeling weak and depressed
Overworked and stressed
I gave him what he needed best
Crying over his failed creation
Could not bear the shame
So I put a bullet through his brain
To relieve him from his pain

I met Allah today
Insane leader to millions of men
He thrust an Ak 47 in my hands
And told me to die for him in the desert lands

I hate it all
The lies and the self deceit
I deny it all
And refuse any divine call
Hate campaign
Free yourself from insanity
Hate campaign
Wake up to reality

I met Krishna the clown
He showed me the celibacy but I fucked him anyway
I heard Satan today
Told me to burn churches in a broad way
Spoke to Hitler today
He gave two options
Become a god my way or their martyr and slave
