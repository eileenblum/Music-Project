[Music by : Blomqvist, Estby, Sahlgren. Lyrics by : K?rki]

Fuck all pathetic moral preachers
And fuck their braindead disciples
Fuck all religious clowns
And their fucked up ways
Fuck good and evil
It's fucking relative
No matter which way you take
You get fucked up anyway

In the end we all will die
So why waste precious time
We all will learn the truth
In death's cold embrace

Fuck the haves
Because they fuck the have-nots
Fuck all fucked politicians
And their power hungry games
Fuck all the bureaucrats
And hang them in red tape
Fuck the fucked up media
With their hype of the day

Look at the world today
Doesn't make sense in any way
Then take a look at yourself
What purpose do you serve

Look at the world today
Ruled with democracy
Feel free to kill yourself
Relieve society from a burden

[Lead: Sahlgren]

Fuck the truth
And read between the lines
Fuck all the lies
It's enough to hear the truth
Fuck the fallen from grace
And all the righteous fucks
Fuck all talk about right or wrong
It all equals out in the end
