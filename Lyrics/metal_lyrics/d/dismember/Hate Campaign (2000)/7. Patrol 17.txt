[Music by : Sahlgren, Blomqvist. Lyrics by : K?rki]

Lying still on a snow covered field
Watch the enemy through my sight
Single column seen from the side
It will be like target practise
Await the moment and act with surprise
The first one killed won't even know he died
As they come closer into perfect range
I pull the trigger and let death take them away

The first takes a bullet in the chest
His face contorts with pain
See him go down in the snow
Then let loose on all the rest
As my weapon hammers away
Blood and intestines spray
Crystal snow now covered in red
Won't stop until they are dead
Recon patrol 17 won't make it home
Presumed as lost in action
In time they will be found
As spring uncovers naked bones

[Lead: Blomqvist]

Emptying the rifle clip
Reload and resume the killing
They turn and try to run away
From the merciless slaughter
Pumping my lead
Into fleeing backs
The ones who rape my country
Will pay with their blood

[Lead: Sahlgren]

The frozen twisted corpses
Preserved by the winter cold
A source of food and life
For various scavengers
And when the sun warms again
The remains rot away
Leaving a pile of bones
For the future to find
