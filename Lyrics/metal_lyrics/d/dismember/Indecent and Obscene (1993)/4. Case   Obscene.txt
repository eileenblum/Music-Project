The gate your portal to life
Falter and grows weak
Your sense of reality somewhat distorted
Morbidity your sanity suffers
In your escape from the truth
Invoke surkai
And amit your wrongdoing

Cursed by the morals
Of generations no longer needed
Living your worthless lives
By the faith written in blood

I weep for your souls
Until they're dust and memories
Forgotten eternally

Calling it 'independence' and 'freedom'
An act that chains them to corruption
That will bring this world down

Your so called truth and righteous light
Who is the one being perverted
Can you ever tell the difference from
Right and wrong
