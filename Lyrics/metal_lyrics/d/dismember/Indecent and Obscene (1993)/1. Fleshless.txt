Fleshless I crawl
Drifting alone
By the realm of the living

Eternal I have become
I will never die
I shall nourish the unborn

Shadowed until the end of time

Twilight is upon me
And deep below I lay
I accept my fate as it becomes

Why should I be afraid to die
Soon my night will fall

Only dreams remain
Through another day
Seems so lonely
In this cold domain
Tainted by my sinful past
Shadows over me it casts
The very power of my soul
Will last until we all shall fall

Painful as it is
I have to realise
I'm not the only one
There is thousands more to die

Only grief remains
With hate I will pass away
TO my land of dreams
Whus it shall stand until we all shall fall
We all shall fall
