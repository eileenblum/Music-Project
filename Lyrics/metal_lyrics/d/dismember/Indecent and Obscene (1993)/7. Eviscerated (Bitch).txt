My hallucination killing need
Your journey into pain
Laugh at your attempt to kill me
I cannot be unmade

Eviscerated bitch

How little I think you're worth
You don't have a face anymore
Fragments of the skull bursting through
Remaining pieces on the floor

A masterpiece of skinless art
I'll sign it in your flesh
Furiously ripping limbs apart
My seed all over this mess

I'm not satisfied
Till your blood is on those walls
I know your flesh when I see it
