Ascending from the grave
Awakened from my sleep
To this world, from this earth
Destined to forever seek

From the fields of an age forever splended
Down to this globular place of dirt

Never realized that my life never ended
Screaming through the process of rebirth

Only existing to die once more
Ever agonizing pain mt only thirst

My rotten carcass
Cold and worn infested
Meets it's destiny
Reborn in blasphemy

Opressing darkness closing in on me
Twilight madness ripping souls apart

Taste my unholiness
Deep in flesh I'm waiting
As hell appeals to me
Reborn in blasphemy
