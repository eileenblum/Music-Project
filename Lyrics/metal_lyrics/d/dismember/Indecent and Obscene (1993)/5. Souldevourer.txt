Spirit side dreaming
Let your blood flow
A last grasp
At your dying faith

I will eat your soul
Your suffering is mine
I'll be your source of pain
Dead ends now entwine

Phantasmal being nightmare creature
Your death is to be sustained
Repeating your act of painful demise
The will to live forever maimed

Demon resurrection
Come die with us

A bloodstained path to oblivion
Scarring both mind and soul
Fuel my evergrowing hate
As I devour you whole

Soul devourer
Lifeeater
I bringer of bitterness

To forever be
Forever sleep
With a hellbound heart

Where pain is born
Carved in flesh
Another object of my art

As I did you also learn
Screaming as our souls burn
The meaning of your severe pain
Your crawling flesh dies again
