[l: Kaerki, m: Estby/Kaerki]

No limit, no number too high
To commit the sickest of crimes
Homicidal enjoyment,
Afrenzied lust to kill
Something they never understood
I crave blood

Incursion
Twist of the knife
Internal adjustment
Mortal flesh impaled

I saw them die
All empty of their life

I'll be thy master
Your sinful messiah
Evil incarnate
Pain and pleasure, death defined
No end to my reign of hate
