[l: Cabeza, m: Cabeza]

On my throne of sin
I watch the demons feed
Nails cut deep into my flesh
And release my pulsing blood

Serpernts dance before my eyes
And tempt the lust inside
Let me taste the pain
Devour me my wicked queen

Whip me with chains of sin
Let your jaws open my skin
Lips and tongues licking the
Wounds
In ectacy I'll rise

Whores of hell
Demons appear to feast on my need
Flesh
Bleed with me
Souls forever free

Taste the pain and its desire
Like a drug its my need
Bleeding bodies, endless orgies
In carnal blasphemy
