[l: Blomovist;m: Blomovist/Sennebaeck]

I feel the tunes of sorrow
Filling my heart
With tears in my eyes
I watch my whole life fall
Apart

Endless days of mourning
I try to move on
Grief is my reality
My hope forever gone

With a smile I hide
Dark emotions deep inside
No matter how I try
All becomes another lie

I look into the sky
Waiting to die
Take me away from here
To a place without fear

Come sweet death
Let me sleep forever
Come sweet death

Life slowly fade away
Nothing more to give
Nothing more to say
No more will to live

Dressed in mourning
I shed my last tear
Through sadeness
I lived my life
Finally the end is here.
