Colder than flesh
Stronger than thought
I dance with the demon
And your dream ends dark

Hunting at night
Blood is my art
Red in sight
I'm killing in parts

A pull of the trigger
And then you're gone
Recoil kicks back
My work is done

Blood sweet blood
I follow my needs
Desecrate your carcass
And watch as it bleeds

Past killing
A season turned in red
Past killing
The art of a man

A soft gentle move
Powered by hungry flesh
Death will be, blood I'll see
Dreams can't last forever;
I'm forcing death to be
Watch you bleed
