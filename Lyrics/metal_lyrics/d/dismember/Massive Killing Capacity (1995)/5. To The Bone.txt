[l: Cabeza/Kaerki, m: Cabeza/Estby]

In this mud of lies I crawl
Emptiness is burning me
Blind hatred
Drives me to extremes

Thorns of lies
Pierce my mind
The bitter truth
Is all I find

Black is all see
Within these waes of pain
If i can't fing myself
I'm better off dead

I can't forgive
Once given trust turns to dissust

I'm lost in misery
I'm deep into pain
Frustration and anger
To the bone it eats
Hate is all I feel

I can't forget
The wounds of betrayal still
Bleeding fresh
