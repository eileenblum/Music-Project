[l: Kaerki, m: Cabeza/Estby/Kaerki]

Unseen and deadly
Phantom of the skies
Tool of massdestuction
Child of an insane mind

Millions are dead
Millions will die
Rejoice this day
As death rain from the skies

Deformed fraks
Survivors of the blast
Incinerated existence
Even death can last

Winds of destruction
Sweep the earth
Worldmurder
This is the new order

No turning back
Drop the iron first
Uncountable casualties
Life cease to exist
