[l: Estby, m: Estby]

Lieproducing, crime-saluting
Humiliating, segregating
Life-eating, gun-feeding
Hypocrisy, society

Warscene overcrowded
Loss of civil liberties
Life spilled like blood
Misanthropical atrocities

Warmachine is discipline
Furiously killing clean
He power addiction
A lethal infiction

Raped by bullets
Innocent dead
Evidence elimination
Strategy spread

Wrdwad though bloodshed
Face-up, forgotten corpses
Unburied

Wardead
