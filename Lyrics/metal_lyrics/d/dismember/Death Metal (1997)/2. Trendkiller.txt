[Music: F. Estby. Lyrics: F. Estby.]

Stab it or grab it
instant the burning
of choices you make
follow prophetic turnings
stinging the eyes
out of every option
go with the flow
a hideous notion

Would you dare to look hate in the eye
kill yourself from within while living outside

Strong will sedated
grow weak and decapitated
selfinflicted  fall
twisting the future 'round your neck
by being a winner
where losing is all

I'm the trendkiller
all out wrecking mindthriller
I'm the trendkiller
onetrack speeding spinechiller

Embittered follower
drink and keep on die for others
