[Music: D. Blomqvist, R. Cabeza. Lyrics: M. KÃ¤rki.]

The night erupts with the sound of small arms fire
tracer rounds snakes through the air
signal flares fly towards the sky
prepare yourself for another assault

I raise my gun and let lead fly
living the horrors of war
move 'em down left to right
i've tasted blood now i want more

Screams of pain echoes through the night
as bullets find their targets
mercilessly ripping through your flesh
spraying intestines and bone all around

Into our trench they fall
The combat goes hand to hand
In a killing frenzy i split someones head
comrade or enemy i just dont  care
