[Music: F. Estby, M. KÃ¤rki. Lyrics: M. KÃ¤rki.]

Indoctrination since early youth
murder of the free thinking mind
religion the root of all evil
the source of all suffering

Deeper and deeper into the void
across the wasteland of your mind
lying to live, living their lie
they make you betray your own kind

Life of agony
you have chosen your way
self induced misery
you are led astray

The free will shall carry the day
drop the bomb and wash the filth away
let the napalm rain

Step into the sickening light
into ruins of heavenly might
embide yourself in their moral vanity
sell your soul to insanity

Religion is an excuse
for a lack of character
something to fall back on
when all else fails

Islam, Hindu, Christianity
it's all based on lies
there is no key to paradise
believe in yourself and all gods die
