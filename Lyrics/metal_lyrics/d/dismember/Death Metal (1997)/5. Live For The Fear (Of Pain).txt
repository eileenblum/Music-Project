[Music: D. Blomqvist, R. SennebÃ¤ck, F. Estby. Lyrics: F. Estby]

Born without dying empty
walk alone for a lifetime denied
the spark of life forever missing
a fear so vast it grows inside

Soul bleeding never healing
at the end of the day my spirit leaving

Of all I own handful of a
solid void what's left to give
can't get rid of all this guilt
blame myself for as long as I live

Shadow of the former me
reach for surface can't break free

Blind, Cold, Bitter [sings "Desire" 1st time]
from dreamfield to death
wasted life on living
suicidals see no reason for another breath

Still forsaken hope all taken
keep on feeding the nightmares within
I see it clear still so tragic
against frustration no one wins

Sinking deep into depression
suffering the weight of confession

Upon the loss of a better fate
laid out before me all pure hate
