[Music: F. Estby, D. Blomqvist. Lyrics: M. KÃ¤rki.]

Holyman the liar
the madman and his call
out on a crusade
fishing for lost souls
slimy holy snake
selling false faith
inject his lethal venom
into weakened minds

Like flies to shit
they gather for mass
approach the altar
of madness
let the ceremonial
comedy begin
live their life
with their head up their ass

Holyman with his bible
deciever  in disguise
shields you from the truth
with promises of paradise

Blinded walk on the trail of lost souls
insane minds bleeding for their saviour
