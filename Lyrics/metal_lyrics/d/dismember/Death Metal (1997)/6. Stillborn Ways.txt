[Music: F. Estby. Lyrics: F. Estby.]

In darkness embraced so dead still so near
come walk towards trhe voices you fear
let the impact of reality fade
of what you dont  believe how could you be afraid

Rape the minds of generations to come
forgiving is living revenge to some
living ghost behind a spirit killing face
stillborn ways of a mindfucking race

Shape the twisted into never sleeping
mourners of god die screaming no more
forever weeping
through hostile eyes never closing
let me inside to live the religious
decomposing

Warped, deranged to see
dying walls inside a kinddom  not to be
entries of fanatic delusions
lose their way in the wheels of confusion
