[Music by : D. Blomqvist, F. Estby, R. SennebÃ¤ck. Lyrics by : M. KÃ¤rki]

Who watches the watchers
hiding behind the light
who'll pay for their crimes
will you die for their lies
the star and the crescent moon
symbol of slavery
soaked in blood
throughout history

Fanatical minds
enforce the way and law
pound the weak into submission
forced into misery
betrayed by their leaders
they're sent out to die
on blooddrenched fields
all praise allah

Deadly, Opium for the mind
it dulls the senses and kills the soul
Garbage, Holy verses of the koran
justify their war on other lands

No fear of dying martyrdom awaits
it's easier to die than to live
