[Music by : D. Blomqvist, F. Estby. Lyrics by : M. KÃ¤rki]

A long dark tunnel
lies before me
through the pain of afterlife
i reach for the light

What was shall be again
though in a different form
erased and blank
i enter life

The path lies open i'm free to choose
from the multitude of options
to let my instincts guide me
through this long and winding walk

Greeted by depressing fear
can't go forward but can't go back
cold and dark remembrance
the years that pass before my eyes

My body grows weak and die
the cycle of death is complete

restrained in moral chains
