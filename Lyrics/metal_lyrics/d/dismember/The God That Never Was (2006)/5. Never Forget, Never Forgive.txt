My darkened soul boils with hate
Memories of my past haunting me
I now truly see who you are
Betrayal has set me free

Darkness once ruled my world
My spirit now roams free

Never forget
Never forgive
Only god forgives
But I do not

Forgiveness and understanding
I'll leave it for the church to preach
The lies that bound me are no more
Humility is not the way to teach

Bitterness, loneliness
Anguish and defeat
I listened, lied and died
Death, resurrection and rebirth
