Ruled by ruin the city of god
Collective madness of the holy squad
Divine violations of dignity
Corrupted secrecy

Hordes of the fallen
Lost and slain
Not epic but insane

Abolition of Christianity
Termination of religious greed
Where no ghost is holy the mind is free
Retribution for persecution
All religions adversary
Where no ghost is holy the blind shall see

The essence of contradiction brings
Blind faith built on sins
Propaganda of unhealing scars
The catholic cancer wont reach this far

Final silence of the battlefield
Where no god is holy the church will kneel
Non-religious eternally
