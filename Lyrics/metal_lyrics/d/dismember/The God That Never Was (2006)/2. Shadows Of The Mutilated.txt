Pale faces twisted in pain
Their hollow eyes watching me
Shadows of the mutilated weep
I dare not to sleep
Days and nights I stay awake
With chemical eyes I greet the sun
Through darkness I waited
For the light to set me free

Insomnia, dementia
I hear the fallen angels sing
Die, die
Lunacy, blasphemy
I hear dying voices whisper
Kill, kill

Behind the wall of sleep
I hear myself scream
Behind the wall of sleep
The horrors beckon me

Feed the demons raging inside
