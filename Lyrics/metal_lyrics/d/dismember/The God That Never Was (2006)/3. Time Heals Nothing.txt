Martyrs of the world
A bleeding nation weep
Decades have come to pass
But scars remain unhealed

The blood on their hands
Will wash ours clean
As we strive for dominance
And our sacred dream
Terror awakens
Death walks among our midst
Resistance fuel hatred
And must be crushed beneath an iron fist

Do unto others
As they've done to us
The world must bleed
As we have bled

Sins of the past
Will keep our cause alive
And as the world try to forget
