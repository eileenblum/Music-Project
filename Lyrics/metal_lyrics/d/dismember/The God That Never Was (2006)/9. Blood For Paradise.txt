I see a storm rise in the east
Forces of evil on the move
Tyranny and blasphemy follows in their wake
Back to the Stone Age
Serpents of the crescent moon
Cast their shadow over weak minds
Live in perpetual twilight
Totalitarian regime bringers of night

Holy wars
Holy shit
Sacrifice
Suicide
Religious tyranny

Masses gather by the blood soaked banner
Unknowing of their fate
Brainwashed, fanatical and blind
They die by the flag of hate

Blood for paradise
Give their lives for lies
Vessels of death
Carriers of disease

Breeding insanity
Religious tyranny
