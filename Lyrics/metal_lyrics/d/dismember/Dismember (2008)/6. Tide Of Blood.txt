Over seas of ice and snow
Through raging waters to foreign shores
We bring you fire, shield and sword
We are your fucking overlords

Hallucinogenic bloodlust
Berserker rage
Sons of the north
Ferocious beyond insane

Raping, burning, killing
Pillage murder
Merciless slaughter
Bringers of death and pain

The coast is ablaze with brutal raids
Destruction as far eyes can see
Massive funeral pyres burning
Where your villages used to be
With the god of war on our side
We don't fear to die
To the Land of the midnight sun
Tide of blood bring me home
