1914 Nations bleed in the Great War to end all wars
young men march on towards the frontline
Unknowing of the horrors to come
Europa burns

1916, young men fight on
Most of them gone in the western campaign

Count the dead and justify
That nothing has been gained
Mass the troops for another push
A sacrifice to the rain of steel
As Europa burns

1918, young men are gone
Horribly maimed in no-mans land
Trenches are filled with blood of the dead
Human waste of world war one
