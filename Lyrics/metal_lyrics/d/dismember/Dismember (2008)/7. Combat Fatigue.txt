Death lurks in every bush
Landmines and booby traps
Fanatic adversaries
Screaming maniacs

Combat fatigue, insanity
Enemy everywhere, even in dreams
Physically unhurt, mentally disturbed
The jungle echoes with the howl of the deranged

Day after day in the line
Driven beyond breaking point
Constant strain, comrades slain
Slaughter house of the damned

Behind the frontline
Shell shocked
The madness goes on
Killing friend and foe
