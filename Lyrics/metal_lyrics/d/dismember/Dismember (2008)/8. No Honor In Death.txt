Screaming ghosts roam the silent battlefield
Locked in eternal conflict neither side never to yield
The blood soaked soil littered with shrapnel, flesh and bone
A gruesome scenery, mosaic of mans destructive need

The stench of rotting corpses, human debris and waste
An eternal embrace with mankind's insanity
Scarred warrior covered with unhealing wounds
Enemies once united by hatred now united in death

No glory in blood, no honor in death
The reward of the brave is a nameless grave
The curse of battle forever live on in their souls
Soldier demons undead they stalk the earth
