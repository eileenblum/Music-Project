Judgement day is near
Armies gather on the plains Megiddo
Angels of heanly might against the forces of darkness
Soldiers of hell, twilight of mankind

Under a blood red sky warriors of god will die
Followers of the holy script pay the ultimate price

Into the void they fly, a final battle cry
Hear the masses roar we will fuck your god
Screaming victims agonized in pain
We rather burn in than suffer the tyranny of god
