We are wolfpack, we rule the seas
In the dark depths we reign supreme
Run silent, run deep, track the hostile fleet
Playing, deadly hide &amp; seek day and night
Dive, dive, dive destroyer sighted
Dive, dive deep out of harms way
Depth charges detonate
Closely enough to seal their fate

Iron, sweat and blood

One hundred men
Sinking to their silent grave

panic spreads, no way out
Flooded compartments
Diesel fumes, fire consumes
Human flesh, burnt to death

Claustrophobic coffin of steel
Broken hulk descent into the dark
