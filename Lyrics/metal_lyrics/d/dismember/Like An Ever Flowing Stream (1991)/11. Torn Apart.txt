Sickening anguish of war
Is tearing my soul apart
I now feel desire
To enter the realm of death

The evil nature of man is tearing my soul apart!

You were left to suffer in the burning aftermath
Forced down on your knees in perpetual torment

The evil nature of man is tearing my soul apart!

Torn apart in front of
The laughing face of death
One last sight of sadness
As I take my final breath

You were left to suffer in the burning aftermath
Forced down on your knees in perpetual torment

In this burning inferno
Devoured by the flames
Drown in eternal fire
As your life fades away

The evil nature of man is tearing my soul apart!
