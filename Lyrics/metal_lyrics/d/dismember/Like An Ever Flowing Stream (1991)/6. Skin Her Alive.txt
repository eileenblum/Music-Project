Haunted by my conscious
Living my life in hell
Didn't (fucking) hesitate
When I moved in for the kill

Screams echoed in the distance
And I cannot ignore
Smiling at the memories
When I slaughtered the whore

Skin here alive

Time has come to confess
I did it for the thrill
I had never [sings: "would never had"] dreamt of
That it would be so nice to kill

Blood colours my thoughts
Slipping out of time
Murder is my crime
Skin here (fucking) alive
