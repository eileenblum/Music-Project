[spoken:]
From dream to dream we have always been
Like an ever flowing stream

As I become one with the earth
By soul has passed the rebirth
In this world I leave my flesh to rot
No regrets, this is my lot

Ashes to ashes
Dust to death

Dark recollections of my past life
Memories haunt me in black'n white
Divine death now descends
Burning as my existence ends

In death I will sleep
Floating deep
From dying heaven
To living hell

A travel through ancient times
Witness only what the dead shall see
Walk among the dead
As my body's still on my death bed

(In death I will sleep
Floating deep
From dying heaven
To living hell)
