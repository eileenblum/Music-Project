Be my valentine
Be yourself (Be)
You're
Lost in my mind
You're
Smoke in my arms
Go
My reason to live
Raze this motion to the ground
I'm seeking sorrow
We're just starting to live
Burning, burning, burning hard
We would fight this time again
Confront your darkest sins
My last regret
Will be dying to your eyes
I'll be a shadow
Just tears from time to time
You belong, you
Belong to (me)
My reason to live
Raze this motion to the ground
I'm seeking sorrow dying,
Crying, rotting
My tears are now behind me
Violent, hurt and broken
My seek is gone
I found a way to demise
Into your eyes
Sleeping is like seeing hell
Through your mind
You're just a ghost
Haunting my sleep
Can't you drop off my dreams [2x]
Be my valentine
Be smoke in my arms
Be my valentine
Be dust in my heart
