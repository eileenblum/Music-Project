Do you feel this anger
Taking appart your head again
Duality, beetwin the shadow and your beauty
Believe Me!

No matter how you do
There are several ways to
Hell eve hate
No matter how you do
By the way, you really don't lead to
Hell eve hate

Do you believe this anger
Taking yourself and the others
Arrested outside, in a psychologic jail

No matter how you do
There are several ways to
Hell eve hate
No matter how you do
By the way, you really don't lead to
Hell eve hate

TOGETHER GIRL!

Go...
Far away, far away of this fucking reallity
Run far away, run!
Far away from me

Stay never
Liberate yourself
Hell eve hate
No matter how you do
By the way, you really don't lead to
Hell eve hate.
