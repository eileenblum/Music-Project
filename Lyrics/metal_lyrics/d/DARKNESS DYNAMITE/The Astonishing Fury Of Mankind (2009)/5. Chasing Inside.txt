We demonstrate
We are only humans
We can create, meaningless moments

Close the doors choosing false ways
I'll chase the mistakes
I'll never surrender !

Demonstrate !
Be appart
Use this fire growing in yourself

Turn your existence into something deeper
Before it turns a murder
No, never surrender !

Demonstrate !
Be appart
Use this fire growing in yourself

Can you keep this fury inside
Let it blow...
And save what we try to hide...

We forget the price of being alive
Engrave the murders !
We know how to leave this pain behind
Billions of children asking to survive

Behind...

We are only humans.
