Fifteen, I am
And here I can't stand
It's not a place to live
Nor a life that makes me believe
Fifteen is what I've got
More and more getting me down
Now I look to the sea
And the raft is ready !

You're really nothing
You're really nothing outside
When inside yourself nothing shines
I stand in black, waiting,
Hidden in the sunrise
Will we get in time...

When the enemy turns the savior
Your own politics kill you more
One last goodbye, mama stands
Straight her feet in the sand
Dead ! It's dead...
NO TURNING BACK !

You're really nothing
You're really nothing outside
When inside yourself nothing shines
I stand in black, waiting,
Hidden in the sunrise
Will we get in time !

We are all in a hurry
We try to save our destiny
In their hands they hold, that power they stole !
