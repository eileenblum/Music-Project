One minute now awake
And the same feeling growing in me
Do I feed this hate ?
Consolidate !
Something to fight for...
My secret mate is the pain I've never left

You evil side can't take a rest
DARE I SAY !
Your evil side can't take a rest
DARE I SAY !

It's your self-experiment to understand what you want
Nothing I've done
Nothing I will be proud of
My anger and my guilt are all that I should miss...

You evil side can't take a rest
DARE I SAY !
Your evil side can't take a rest
DARE I SAY !

DARE I SAY, we can't control !
DARE I SAY, by our own !
DARE I SAY, we can't control !
DARE I SAY !
