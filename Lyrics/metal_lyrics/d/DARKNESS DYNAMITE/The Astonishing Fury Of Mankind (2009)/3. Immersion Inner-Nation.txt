You piss me off
You're full of shit
No one of you will get me inside this
I hate you, believe me !
A worm like you can't fight a storm

You think nothing can stop your brain
You're living a lie, an insane lie
You'll never wake up
Just...die !

No, one of you can stand
To live in this world
Where every passion destroys
Every soul
And then we start again... AGAIN !

Please save me from sincerity
An oceansize of hypocrisy
Poisoned the heart of all creep
Your world is mine !

No, one of you... can stand
To live in this world
Where every passion destroys
Every soul...
THIS END THE END !

This is the end
No everlasting pride for you !
There's nothing left
You'll have to pay the consequences !
Yeah !
