You can't stop me
Escape the world with me
We're all looking for the end
We're such a bunch of liars
Lying to ourselves
Are we looking for something real ?

Fuck you then !

No, never stop walking toward
The way we built
For our own defeat

You can't stop me now !
I will ensure my promises
God is gone
Be yourself, hurry up !
I don't give a fuck !

You can't stop me, I will run again
I will run, far away
Away...

Take my hand.
