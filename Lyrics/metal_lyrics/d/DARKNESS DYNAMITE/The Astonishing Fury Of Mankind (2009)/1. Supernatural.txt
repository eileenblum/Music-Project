Call all your Fucking heroes
That's such a lie
Without any sort of judgement
You shine tonight

Set it back to zero
Show me how you are
No matter how far
We're such supernatural

Set it back to zero
We will never link the sky

Creating the world
Everyday, making something new
Everyday, lot of changes to us

Set it back to zero
Show me how you are
No matter how far
We're such supernatural

You swear baby, that I am supernatural
But supernatural you are
You swear baby, that I am the only one
You need to look into yourself.
