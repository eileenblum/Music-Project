Everyday i seek for the best of me
Fighting my demons to take this fucking sincerity out
What i need, all we need
It's a simple taste of vice to feel alive

Now i know what to chase
We need to feel alive
Now i know what to chase
Far away i see this bullet coming...

I live twice a day
My memory erases the past
Will you trust in myself ?
I really don't give a fuck about those liars already dead !

Now i know what to chase
Some are seeking grace
Now i know what to chase
Far away i see this bullet coming straight

No bullshit !
No matter !
We need a fucking simple taste of vice to feel alive !
