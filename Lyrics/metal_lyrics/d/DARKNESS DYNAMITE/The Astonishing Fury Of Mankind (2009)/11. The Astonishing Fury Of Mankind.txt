I will fill the sky
With the clouds of my wishes
Within a spectral rest, dancing alone...

Life is stuck in my dreams
Accross the mighty nothing
Nothing I feel
My soul was taken from me

We are all creatures made of deny
Down the spotless hole of rage
Delightful depression
The happiness I hide
Tears of black shades

I am the herculean creep
I know...
I am a puppet of my own madness
I will fill the sky
With the clouds of my wishes
Within a spectral rest
Dancing alone
Beetwin the hollow and the desert of my thoughts

We are all creatures made of deny
Down the spotless hole of rage
Delightful depression
The happiness I hide
Tears of black shades
Astonishing fury of mankind
I swear to protect you from me
Is there a place in my brain
Where I can hide this beast inside

No ! I am a number !
No ! I am no priceless life !
