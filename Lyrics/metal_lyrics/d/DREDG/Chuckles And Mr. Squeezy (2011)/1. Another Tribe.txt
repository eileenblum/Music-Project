I've forgotten how to smile
A common relapse, an ocean of change within
I didn't know I was going to be the prey
Until it was already much too late

They always say they're against the grain
Come on, they all look the same
They just joined another tribe
To help them build up some old fight
Nothing new to see here, oh, oh, oh

Here we go, go again
Following all the trends
It's become an obsession
Yet it's time to accept it, yeah

Here we go, go again
Following all the trends
It's become an obsession
Yet it's time to accept it, yeah

It's raining again
Creating puddles of eternity
It's where my passion ends
And the insecurity begins

All of this combined
Contaminating me
Maybe someday we will see
Maybe someday we will see

They only say they're against the grain
Come on, they all look the same
They just joined another tribe
To help them build up some old fight
Nothing new to see here, oh, oh, oh

Here we go, go again
Following all the trends
It's become an obsession
Yet it's time to accept it, yeah

Here we go, go again
Following all the trends
It's become an obsession
Yet it's time to accept it, yeah

Where is, where is your deceit?
Give us something real
Wipe up your smile
No more deception, is this real?

Here we go, go again
Following all the trends
It's become an obsession
Yet it's time to accept it, yeah

Here we go, go again
Following all the trends
It's become an obsession
Yet it's time to accept it, yeah
