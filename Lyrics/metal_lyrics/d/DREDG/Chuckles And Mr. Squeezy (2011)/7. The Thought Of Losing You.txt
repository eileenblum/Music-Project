Today, today is a new day
Put the pain away today
Tomorrow, tomorrow's a new way
Your scars will fade someday, someday

The thought of losing you is not an option
The thought of losing you never was
The thought of losing you is not an option
It's not an option

After all this pain the pain's no more
After all this pain the pain endured
After all this pain I'll be sure that the future is bright
You can follow me

Listen up, listen up
You've come a long way
Listen up to the sound, the sound
But now, now there's a new way
For you to forget and rebound

It's now, now, now
Get up, get on your feet
It's now, now, now
You know it worries me when you go

The thought of losing you is not an option
The thought of losing you never was
The thought of losing you is not an option
It's not an option

After all this pain the pain's no more
After all this pain the pain endured
After all this pain I'll be sure that the future is bright
You can follow me

Like a moth within a windstorm
A drowning bee in a pool
Like a fly beneath the swatter
A spider crushed with a shoe

The thought of losing you is not an option
The thought of losing you never was
The thought of losing you is not an option
It's not an option

After all this pain the pain's no more
After all this pain the pain endured
After all this pain I'll be sure that the future is bright
You can follow me

After all this pain the pain's no more
After all this pain the pain endured
After all this pain I'll be sure that the future is bright
You can follow me
