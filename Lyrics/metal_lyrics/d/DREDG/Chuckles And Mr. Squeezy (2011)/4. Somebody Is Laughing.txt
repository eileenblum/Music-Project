Some are skeptics and some believe
Some refuse to say
Well, if they've seen it they'll believe it
They have nothing to fear, to fear

Searching for a meaning greater than us
Something shiny and grand
While there's plenty right here in front of us
Right here

Somebody somewhere is laughing
Somebody somewhere knows
Somebody somewhere is laughing
Laughing 'cause they know

So many people looking for answers
So many people blindly convinced
So many people looking for answers
So many people forget to exist

We're on our own
We're on our own

Call it heaven or the afterlife
Or a fire-filled hell
It's just this, just here, just now
That's all, that's all, that's all

Somebody somewhere is laughing
Somebody somewhere knows
Somebody somewhere is laughing
Laughing 'cause they know

So many people looking for answers
So many people blindly convinced
So many people looking for answers
So many people forget to exist

We're on our own
We're on our own
We're on our own

So many people looking for answers
So many people blindly convinced
So many people longing for answers
