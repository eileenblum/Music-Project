We need some light, find the lantern
Unzip the tent, we can use the moon
I'm going out into the weeds
To gather everything we need
So stay, stay until I'm done
Until I'm done searching for a clue

Even the faintest glint of light
Can guide me right back to you

You had no choice but to run and to go

(I'll get you)
Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home
Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home

Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home
Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home

Through the dark, through the dark
I've gotta get back to you

You're the lighthouse on the shore
The beacon is my guide
The trail of crumbs, I'm fueled by your light
By your light

You had no choice but to run and to go

(I'll get you)
Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home
Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home

Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home
Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home

Through the dark, through the dark
I've gotta get back to you
The distance we maintain is a stable foundation
The trail of crumbs is my motivation, motivation

We have no choice but to run and to go

(I'll get you)
Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home
Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home

Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home
Anything that you need, anything at all
Oh, I'm down for you and I'll be coming home
