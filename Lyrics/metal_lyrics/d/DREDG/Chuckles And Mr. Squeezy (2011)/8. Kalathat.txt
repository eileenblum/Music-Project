He lived the life, never offended, he played by the rules
Struck the right chords, he never was out of tune
Sacrificed every second for his kids and wife
Thought to himself, "If I only had more time"

He said, "It's a problem that I'll solve
Well, it's a problem to resolve someday"

Commuted daily to his high-tech job
Waited in line patiently with the rest of the mob
Now a taste of success can forever jade
When the pink slip arrived he'd finally lost his way

He said, "It's a problem that I'll solve
Well, it's a problem to resolve someday"

He abandoned his family, he's by himself
There's nothing left now, no substance, no wealth

His whole life was work and business
He could hardly see
The story of a jaded man
Who'll never know what could have been
It's all too common these days
It's all too common these days
It's all too common these days

Well, it's a problem that he'll solve
Well, it's a problem he resolved
