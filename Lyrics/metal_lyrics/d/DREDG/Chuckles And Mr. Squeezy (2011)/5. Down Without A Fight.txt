They laid down
And watched it all crumble around them
They laid down
And watched their city burn

They decided to give into the yearning
To succumb to their ways
They truly believed they couldn't get away
They couldn't get away

Regardless if it was wrong even if it was right
They went down without a fight, down without a fight
Regardless if it was wrong even if it was right
They went down without a fight, down without a fight
Believing positivity breeds positive happenings

Now it's known
(Now it's known)
Everyone should have been brave
Now it's known
(Now it's known)
If they'd stuck around their lives would have been saved

They just turned and walked away
No one ever thought they would
Now there's only soot and decay
Where their city once laid

Regardless if it was wrong even if it was right
They went down without a fight, down without a fight
Regardless if it was wrong even if it was right
They went down without a fight, down without a fight
Believing positivity breeds positive happenings

They just turned and walked away
They're never coming back, never coming back

Regardless if it was wrong even if it was right
(Never coming back)
They went down without a fight, down without a fight
(Never coming back)
Regardless if it was wrong even if it was right
(Never coming back)
They went down without a fight, down without a fight
Believing positivity breeds positive happenings
