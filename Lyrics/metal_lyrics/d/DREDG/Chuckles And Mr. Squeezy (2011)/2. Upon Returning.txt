Well, I can understand to a certain extent
The camaraderie and mass appeal
But the feelings you hold, you've got 'em under control
Make me realize how much you have grown

I can understand what you meant
Very few could even deal
With a task so bold, the bravery you've shown
Makes me realize you're on your own
That you're on your own

But I can lie, I can lie if it makes you feel better
I can lie, I can lie if it gives you pleasure
You'll be fine, you'll be fine if we do it together
But I can lie, I can lie if it makes you feel better

Please know I'll be here when you return

Well, I can understand to a certain extent
What you're going through and how you feel
But the stories you've told and the pictures you've shown
Make me realize you're on your own
That you're on your own

Well, I can lie, I can lie if it makes you feel better
I can lie, I can lie if it gives you pleasure
You'll be fine, you'll be fine if we do it together
But I can lie, I can lie if it makes you feel better

Please know I'll be here when you return
Please know I'll be here when you return

Upon returning nothing makes sense
It's more foreign than the place you just left
Everyone's living, everyone's working, everything's so deceiving
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

Well, I can lie, I can lie if it makes you feel better
I can lie, I can lie if it gives you pleasure
(Give me pleasure, give me pleasure)
You'll be fine, you'll be fine if we do it together
But I can lie, I can lie if it makes you feel better

Please know I'll be here when you return
Please know I'll be here when you return
Please know I'll be here when you return
Please know I'll be here when you return
When you return
