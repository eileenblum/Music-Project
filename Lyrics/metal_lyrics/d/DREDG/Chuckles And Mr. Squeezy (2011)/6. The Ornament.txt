Well, I've been aching for someone I barely met,
And I've been begging for something I'll never get,
And I've been tracing the footsteps of fallen men,
Hoping to fill this void within.

But I'm here all alone again,
Here all alone again,
Here all alone again,
Hoping to fill this void within.

Well, I've been chasing the impossible,
And I've been floating around this world,
Wondering why I'm still in orbit,
Choking on the fumes up here,
Choking on the fumes again.

But I'm here all alone again,
Here all alone again,
Here all alone again,
Hoping to fill this void within.

Well, I've been aching for someone I barely met,
And I've been begging for something I'll never get.
