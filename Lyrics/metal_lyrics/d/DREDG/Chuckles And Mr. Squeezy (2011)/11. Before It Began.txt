He traveled up and down these roads
To venture out and become a man
He started in a familiar place
But ended up in a foreign land
But as the story usually goes
Nothing quite went as planned

He was on an endless road
Feeling like a king
Even after the initial bite
The wound still did sting

It's not an easy thing to do
Even for the toughest man
It was already over before it began
(It was already over before it began)

The same strut was in his walk
The same fire was in his eyes
Before his child was even born
He'd already said his goodbye

He was on an endless road
Feeling like a king
Even after the initial bite
The wound still did sting

It's not an easy thing to do
Even for the toughest man
It was already over before it began
(It was already over before it began, before it began)
