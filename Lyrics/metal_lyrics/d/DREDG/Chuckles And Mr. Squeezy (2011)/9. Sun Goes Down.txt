We know you really wanna join us
We know you really want a part of this

Every little thing, every little thing around us
Every single moment chips away at our past
Everywhere we look, everywhere is an option
Everybody needs some sense of release

The way you look at me
It's hiding in the breeze
You can disagree
But it's all that you wanted

We feel more alive when the sun goes down
There's no time to dream, oh no
We feel more alive when the sun goes down
We're taking it gradually, oh no

Every contradiction, every lasting remark
Every agreement, every little spark
Every single action, every taste of suspense
Everybody climbs over when you put up your fence

The way you look at me
It's hiding in the breeze
You can disagree
But it's all that you wanted

We feel more alive when the sun goes down
There's no time to dream, oh no
We feel more alive when the sun goes down
We're taking it gradually, oh no

Every little thing, every little thing around us
Every single moment fading into the past
Everywhere we run, everywhere an obstruction
Everybody needs some sense of release

The way you look at me
It's hiding in the breeze
You can disagree
But it's all that you wanted

We feel more alive when the sun goes down
There's no time to dream, oh no
We feel more alive when the sun goes down
We're taking it gradually, oh no

We feel more alive when the sun goes down
There's no time to dream, oh no
We feel more alive when the sun goes down
We're taking it gradually, oh no
