You say the sky is falling,
but it's the earth rising,
a perception as precious as some gold.

You spend all of your time in front of the tunnel,
at the beginning of the light,
scrambling for someone, the monster called.

Well, I don't want to, but I have to.
Where I'll end up I'm not really sure.
Well, I don't want to, but I have to.
Yes, I have to let you go.

Change is calling,
but your fears keep stalling,
your potential to progress and transform.

You spend all of your time solving a puzzle,
a beginning window in the tide,
a violent storms waiting to unfold.

Well, I don't want to, but I have to,
Where I'll end up I'm not really sure,
Well, I don't want to, but I have to,
Yes, I have to let you go

Roaming like a Stationary Transient, 
you'll get over it, you'll get over it.
Pages of happiness still remain,
I know that it hasn't been overturned,
Feeling like we've been through this all before,
you'll get over it, you'll get over it.
I don't know what I'd do without all of this
you'll get over it, you'll get over it.

Well, I don't want to, but I have to,
Where I'll end up I'm not really sure,
Well, I don't want to, but I have to,
Yes, I have to let you go

Yes, I have to let you go
