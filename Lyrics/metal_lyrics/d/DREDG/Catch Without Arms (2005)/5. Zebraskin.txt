One Two Three Four

I wonder while I'm running around again
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
Yeah I wonder
Like sprinting on a frozen pond... I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend

A couple of drinks mid-day mid-day mid-day
Haven't felt this way this way since yesterday
A couple of drinks I sway I sway I sway
Haven't felt this way since yesterday

I wonder while I'm running around again
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
Yeah I wonder
Like sprinting on a frozen pond I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend

(a couple of drinks, a couple of drinks)
(a couple of drinks, a couple of drinks)

A couple of drinks mid-day mid-day mid-day
Haven't felt this way this way since yesterday
Beginning to sink and fade and fade and fade
There's nothing that I would trade to feel this way

I wonder while I'm running around again
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
Yeah I wonder
Like sprinting on a frozen pond I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend

(a couple of drinks, a couple of drinks)

[Various vocal background noises]

I wonder while I'm running around again
I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend
Yeah I wonder
Like sprinting on a frozen pond I took my chances
I may have lost my best friend

I wonder... running around again
I wonder... may have lost my best friend
I wonder... running around again
I wonder... may have found my best friend
