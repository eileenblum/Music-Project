I'm not your star
I'm not that beam of light
Here to save your life
To make your wallet fat
While mine's on a diet
It's not my greatest care
But simple needs are scarce
It's never-ending
It really seems unfair
But lately I don't care
I don't care about much
I've given up trying

So sing about love
Sing about lust
So they will care
It's the same difference
That's what happens when you play catch without arms
It's what sets, sets, sets us apart
That's what happens when you compromise your art
It's what sets, sets, sets us apart

We've got this far
I don't know if you care
But I think that you should swear
Or something of the sorts
Show me your trying

So sing about love
Sing about lust
So they will care
It's the same difference
That's what happens when you play catch without arms
It's what sets, sets, sets us apart
That's what happens when you compromise your art
It's what sets, sets, sets us apart

Set the bait so they will bite it
If there's a hook they can't deny it
Sing about love so they can feel it
Sing about love so they can sing it
Sing it

That's what happens when you play catch without arms
It's what sets, sets, sets us apart
That's what happens when you compromise your art
It's what sets, sets, sets us apart

I'm not your star
I'm not that beam of light
Here to save your life
Oh no
Not your star
Not that beam of light
Here to save your life
Oh no
