The old returns while the new can bore
Because you're the one who fell
Into your self-created Hell
We wanted out

It took time to realize
It's a chore to recognize
What your world could take it's overgrown
Take it all the way now
Well soon we'll take this all the way down

The old returns while the new can bore
Because you're the one who fell
Into your self-created Hell
There is no way out
When you build a stubborn shell
That shields from any help
We wanted out

You tried to maximize
But it came as no surprise
Your world is staked to your own dome
Take it all the way out
Well soon we'll take this all the way down

Please, Don't, Go, Stay

The old returns while the new conform
Because you're the one who fell
Into your self-created Hell
There is no way out
When you build a stubborn shell
That shields from any help

The old returns while the new conform
Because you're the one who fell
Into your self-created Hell

Take it all away now
There is no way out
There is no way out
When you build a stubborn shell
That shields from any help
We wanted out
We wanted out
