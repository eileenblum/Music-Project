I was looking down at you smiling up at me
For once I held you tight, but shadow hands grabbed at me
You're head was in the clouds, now those clouds are in your head
It's when you needed me, so I listened to want you said

Look another year went by,
They keep passing by,
But damn I didn't even die,
To hold it so I've grown,
I fought time but lost

It was love like a callous you scarred enough to be
Tough and immune, your body adapts you see
To all above my head, and all below my feet
No that's one freedom you'll never take from me

Look another year went by,
They keep passing by,
But damn I didn't even die,
To hold it so I've grown,
I fought time but lost

To criticize and judge, how did I end up here,
With these standards I'm forced to love, make me disappear.

Hold tight, hold tight

To criticize and judge, how did I end up here,
With these standards I'm forced to love, make me disappear.
To criticize and judge, how did I end up here,
With these standards I'm forced to love make me disappear.

Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
Look another year went by
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight, hold tight
