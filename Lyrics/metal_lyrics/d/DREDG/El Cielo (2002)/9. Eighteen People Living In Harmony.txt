The opera is over
Singers have all gone home
Seats are empty
The kitchen is closed

The sidewalks are sprayed down
The blinds are pulled down
The foundation's unstable
The wrecking ball is back
Quiet business vacancy
Quiet business vacancy

Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down

Symphony's concluded
The instruments are all cased up
The notes are silent
The music's still apparent

Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
Spirits are jaded

Art is dying
Is art dead?
Art is dying
Is it dead?
Believe it
We need it to move on

A one track mind in a one way town
Let's go ahead and gentrify
We let art die with robot minds
Steal the brush and paint boundary lines

A stale kind the people we'll find
Walking in single file line
I think its time to finally rewind
Lets go ahead we might as well

Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
Spirits are jaded
