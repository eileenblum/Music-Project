White cloth, black napkins
Wood chairs surround me
Wood tables, foggy sign
In front with no light

Night falls beneath candle light

Cast shadows
Insence fragrance
From the corner of the room
Cloudy senses Stale light below
Beneath me

Night falls beneath candle light
White squalls beneath winter skies
Night falls beneath winter skies
White squalls beneath winter skies

Faceless crowd of elderly beings
Roses sprouting yellow glow
Subconcious into the light

Night falls beneath candle light
White squalls beneath winter skies
