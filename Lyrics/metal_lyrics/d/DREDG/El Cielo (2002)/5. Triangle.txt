We're born into silence and let it all be
Lift your anchor and just float astray
Born into silence and let it all be
Fortune in silence

Watch it explode
While fragments of ironies examples fly
And hit the shore
And tyranny's torn
From the podiums where leaders stand
But rule no more

Plead with nothing... Why don't we lecture about something
Protest the way we're passive today

Watch it explode
While it's not impossible
For flowers to bloom and grow next to graves
And babies are born
In the same buildings where people go
To pass away
Pass away

Plead with nothing... Why don't we lecture about something
Protest the way we're passive today

We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes

We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes

Born into silence and let it all be
Lift your anchor and just float astray
Born into silence and let it all be
Fortune in silence
