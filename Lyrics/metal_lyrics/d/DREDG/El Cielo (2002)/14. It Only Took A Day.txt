Think we know
Oblivious though
Unified clones
Sit like stones
Up on thrones
Of fool's gold
Looking bold
But all alone

Restore our needed shelter

Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Pants at my knees
Fading with growth
Lie awake
Buried stones
All alone

Restore our needed shelter
Our flawless endeavors
To be alone
To be alone

Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Passing my knees
Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Pants at my knees
Fading with growth
Lie awake
Lie awake
Lie awake
