This lonely old man had heart
Resting grey hairs on wrinkled arms
With nothing but a stool to hold up his back
Skinny legs with Japanese mileage
Crossed at the ankles
He's unaware

Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it

Unaware of his surroundings
Youth, it passed
Swarming like wolfs to a fresh kill
The scented tracks
He's just scared about dying

Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Save your clever statements
Brave yourself if you want in
It's the only way to understand it

Too bad
Too bad
Too bad
So sad
Days have come to an end
Where all
Where all has been lost

Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Save your clever statements
Brave yourself if you want in
It's the only way to understand it
To understand it
