Distorted and complicated
I'm sorry but its over
Essential to awaken
I'm leaving
Here we are
That's what it's all about
I'm sorry but its over
To love here and to love this
I'm finally breathing

Before you go
There is something more to say
Before you go
There is something more to say

Persistent resentment
I'm sorry but its over
Seduction for destruction
I'm finally breathing

Before you go
There is something more to say
Before you go
There is something more to say
Before you go
There is something more to say
