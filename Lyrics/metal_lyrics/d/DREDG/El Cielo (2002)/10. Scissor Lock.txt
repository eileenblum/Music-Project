I think I'm awake
Rolling on my blanket
I am sinking into the bed
Light around me
Beautful washes of pulsating color
Buzzing white noise
It sounds like one hundred bees

I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed

Pulsing
You control it
Body's asleep
And your mind is awake

I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed

I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
