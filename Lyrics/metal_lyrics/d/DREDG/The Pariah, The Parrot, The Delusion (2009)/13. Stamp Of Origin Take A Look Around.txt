Take a look around,
All things green and brown,
Are here to stay,
The people walking by,
Buildings built so high,
Will be gone someday,
A piercing sound so loud,
Takes over the crowd,
Watch them run away,
Objects in the sky,
Blacken all the light,
Total disarray,
What a show,
What a show,
Take a look around,
Everything you've found will be gone someday.
