Gonna miss your ways, your sin, your smell, your smile
An anxious attempt to let you know
Dancing on the roof of some cartoon showroom
But in an instant Id give it all right back
So keep moving onward
Run through that open door
Consuming knowledge
Wormhole through times before

Cant you hear their voices crying
Cant you hear their hearts breaking

There is only so much we can, only so much can be shown to you
The rest is your choice... its your choice?
When I close my eyes, I see two faces above me
One to my left, one to my right
I took you under, under my wing to shadow
It never did bother me to hide you from the light
So keep moving onward
Run through that open door
Consuming knowledge
Wormhole through times before

Cant you hear their voices crying
Cant you hear their hearts breaking

There is only so much we can, only so much can be shown to you
The rest is your choice?its your choice?its your choice
So keep moving onward (Run through that open door)
