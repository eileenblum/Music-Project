To sacrifice oneself never made sense to me
'Cause life is really the only and last gift we've all received
Some will waste it in the name of something you can't see
Continually defeat the purpose of that something creating

Oh, delusions
Are meant to justify, justify the things you do
Oh, delusions
Never really qualified, qualified as an excuse

As he approached the city center with the skyline in view
There was nothing left to contemplate, he knew he must follow through
With the plan certified by faith and a plan written in death
At that moment, this was it, he took his last breath

Oh, delusions
Are meant to justify, justify the things you do
Oh, delusions
Never really qualified, qualified as an excuse

No more hiding, no more hiding, no more blame
No more fighting, no more fighting, no more pain
No more chaos, no more chaos, no more stress
And no addiction, no addiction, no more mess
No more attitudes, no more swollen heads.
No more greed, no more feeding from the hand
No more writing, no more "blame it on the man"
Realize it's your own fault

"Da-da-da, do-do-da-do-da"
