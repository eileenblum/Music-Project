Sitting in the sand, watch the tide roll up
Take the deep breath in, as your past fades out
Let everything else just fade into the horizon

When the planets stop spinning, and the music stops
Take a deep breath in, let your life fade out
With everything else, you'll fade into the horizon

("I'll never leave this place, the place where I was born"
"I need a little more information to add to this confusion"
"These delusions, they are meant to justify the things you do"
"Thankfully, I haven't been taken very seriously"
"Keep moving, onward, keep moving, onward"
"I don't know if I've been reborn, or lived a past life, suffered in another time"
"I'm gathering the pebbles I need to drink from the well"
"We are all part of this problem"
"Just let go, just let go, just let go, just let go"
"Into the horizon... let everything else just fade into the horizon")
