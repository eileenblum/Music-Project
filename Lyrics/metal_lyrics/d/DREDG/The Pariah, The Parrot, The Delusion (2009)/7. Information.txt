You're suffering, feel your pain
Allow me to be your sponge
Cause I can absorb your sorrows
I'm the one

Fire may rain down on you, but I'll be your water
Waves may crash on you, but I'll be your land
Cause I want to give you just a temporary bliss

Just a little bit, just a little bit
A little more information
To add to my confusion
To add to the frustration

I don't need it

So shed your pain, well I'll sit in silence
As you bleed your deepest feelings here
Quakes may rattle you, but I'll be your sky
Winds may twist around you, but I'll be your clouds

Just a little bit, just a little bit
A little more information
To add to my confusion
To add to the frustration

I don't need it
No, I don't need it

He woke up next to her, his head against her head
His hand upon her breast, he knew today meant death
He kissed her on the cheek, and then on her lips
Thought to himself, "it's the last time I'll do this"

Put on a suit, pressed and clean
He brushed his hair, grabbed his keys
Then he headed out to the morning air
With an anticipation no man could bear

The air was heavy
He could feel it in his lungs
With every step he took, a prayer rolled off his tongue
They were prayers of forgiveness, and prayers of praise
And his actions a gift for a god without a name

Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Just a little bit, just a little bit
A little more information
To add to my confusion
To add to the frustration

I don't need it
No, I don't need it

Whoa-oh-oh-oh
