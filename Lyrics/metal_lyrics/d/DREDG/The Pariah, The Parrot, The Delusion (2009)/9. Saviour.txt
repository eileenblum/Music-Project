It makes me wish I was a banger
I'd come and retaliate
I tend to avoid impulsive gangster attitudes
Cause they will blind you

It's gonna eat you up
It's gonna drag you down
Gonna get all that you ask for

Affected many lives
Left a void so wide
Gonna get all that you want

Looking for a saviour
Not one who saves
Been looking for a saviour
One to retaliate

There's no need for forgiveness
It's already said and done
But don't let revenge consume and take hold of you
Cause it will blind you

It's gonna eat him up
It's gonna drag him down
He's gonna get all that he asked for

Affected many lives
Left a void so wide
Gonna get all that he wants

Looking for a saviour
Not one who saves
Been looking for a saviour
One to retaliate

Open up

You affected many lives
You left a void so wide
Gonna get all that you ask for

It's gonna eat you up
It's gonna drag you down
You're gonna get all that you want

Looking for a saviour
Not one who saves
Been looking for a saviour
One to retaliate

You've sworn to retaliate
One to retaliate

Open up
