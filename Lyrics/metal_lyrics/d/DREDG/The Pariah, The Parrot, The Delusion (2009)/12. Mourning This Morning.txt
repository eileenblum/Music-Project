We'll be mourning this morning
There is no need to complain
Cos we've been ignoring this warning
There is no pleasure without this pain

We're drawn together by accident
We'll be forever with these words and
Melodies they'll guide us through this speck in time
We're trying to get the missed attempts
We are forever with these words and
Memories they'll guide us through this night
We're getting older, older, older

Another day, another rut
Along the highways faults
We sat and watched him, the saddened watchmen
He's all alone

We're drawn together by accident
We'll be forever with these words and
Melodies they'll guide us through this speck in time
We're trying to get the missed attempts
We are forever with these words and
Memories they'll guide us through this night
We're getting older, older, older

But it's not over, over
Cos this all, all you'll ever get
Don't forget that, don't forget that, don't forget
Cos this all, all you'll ever get
Don't forget that, it's your one and only chance
Go this far, on your own
We'll be mourning this morning
We'll be mourning this morning
Cos we've been ignoring this warning all along
We're getting older, older, older
