Was put in a round room
And told to sit in the corner
While they washed my brain with a dirty rag

Was given a hammer
And told to build a fortress
With walls impossible to penetrate

You're the only thing I need
And you've become the only thing
That keeps me breathing, without you I'd be
In a dark place, no light switch
An open wound without a stitch
Maybe now you will understand

No matter how stable
The foundation may seem
Everything is crashing down on me

With papercuts on fingertips
Blackened eyes and broken limbs
Forever wounded, it's hard to tell

You're the only thing I need
Whether I fail or succeed
Within my blindness, you are all I see
The morning fog sun burns away
A predator's eye without its prey
Maybe now you will understand

I won't quit on you
No, I won't quit on you
Ever
