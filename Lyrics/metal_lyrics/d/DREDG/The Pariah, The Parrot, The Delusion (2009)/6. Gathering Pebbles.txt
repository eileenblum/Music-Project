Wait for me
You're onto something
Maybe there's no need
To play catchup, to play catchup
Wait for me
You're onto something
Maybe there's no need
To play catchup, to play catchup

You're casually
Casually walking through life without a worry
I'm worried its effects will show
So now I'm gathering
Gathering the pebbles I need to drink from the well
So thirsty, so thirsty

Wait for me
Well, I am not very far behind
So wait for me
I'm still chasing you
Wait for me
Well, I am not very far behind
So wait for me
While I play catchup

But thankfully
Thankfully, I haven't been taken very seriously
Seriously anxious to run the course without stumbling
Stumbling over fences, now I'm falling
Falling down the hillside, it's way too steep
It's way too steep

Wait for me
Well, I am not very far behind
So wait for me
I'm still chasing you
Wait for me
Well, I am not very far behind
So wait for me
I'm still chasing you

I happened to take a chance
Now there's no turning back
Return to childhood dreams, there rested figurines
I've been through life fast
Riding over broken glass
There is no question now
That I will catch up, will catch up

Will catch up...
