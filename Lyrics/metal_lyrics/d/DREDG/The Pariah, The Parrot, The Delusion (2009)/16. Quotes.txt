There's a way
A way to get out of here
To escape these storms and find some shelter
To rid of your darkness, to rid of your boredom
There's somewhere
Somewhere that you can go
It's obvious, well, well it's apparent
It's right in front of you
So reach out and take it
And just let go

Our sobriety will diminish
Discriminate we fade slow, fade slow
These drugs will expand us
United we will grow
Let go, Let go

There's a way
A way to squash all of your fears
When everyone around you seems to be a stranger
You feel their eyes upon you
Your hearing their thoughts
As they walk away their voice grows louder
Illusions illuminate
While your delusions dictate your next move
You're bound by deception and a misled direction
So just let go

Our sobriety will diminish
Discriminate we fade slow, fade slow
These drugs will expand us
United we will grow
Let go, Let go, Let go

There's a way
A way out of here
There's a way
A way out of here
So just let go

Our sobriety will diminish
Discriminate we fade slow, fade slow
These drugs will expand us
United we will grow
Let go, Let go
