I'll Never leave this place,
No I'll never leave this place,
I'll never leave the place
where I was born.
Because beyond these town limits
even though I've never seen 'em,
There's really nothing else to explore
There's nothing more...

Where is your intrigue and interest?
You don't have any questions or wonder
Why would I leave this place
When I'm comfortable right here?
Everything I need and more isn't far, it's near

I'll never leave this place,
No I'll never leave this place,
I'll never leave the place
where I was born.
Because beyond these town limits
even though I've never seen 'em,
There's really nothing else to explore
There's nothing more...

You have created a falsehood,
a focused and closed minded view.
There's no telling where we'll be
at this same time next year
But I do know one thing,
it wont be far from here.

I'll never leave this place,
No I'll never leave this place,
I'll never leave the place
where I was born.
Because beyond these town limits
even though I've never seen 'em,
There's really nothing else to explore
There's nothing more...
