Yes take time 
To realize what you have 
Yes i did 
But suspended 
And now i hang 
Beneath the ground that we have made 
For us 
To walk on. 

See me now 
Crawl away, crawl away 
See me now 
Crawl away 

Yes take time 
To realize what you have 
Content 
But descended 
And now i swim 
Beneath currents of hope and faith 
Now it is time 
To surface. 

?? 

See me now 
Crawl away, crawl away 
See me now 
Crawl with me 
Belive me now 
Crawl away, crawl away 
Come crawl with me
