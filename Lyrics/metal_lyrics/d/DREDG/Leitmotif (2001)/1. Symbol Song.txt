He said: patience is the key to
For a change to ensue
Warm the arctic cold
And drop down
To the ground
Wait for the sound
Of the cold

Take these words
You'll have your day
Live it as your last

He said: love will build your heart and
Bring you up from the sand
Now i wish to go, and settle
Pray for reform
It's all we are
It's all we are

Take these words
Be on your way
You will find your
Now...

He said: faith, distrust, and reason
With this you'll be kneeling
Before the world
And drop down
To the ground
It's all we are
It's all we are

Take these words
Be on your way
You will find your
Now....
