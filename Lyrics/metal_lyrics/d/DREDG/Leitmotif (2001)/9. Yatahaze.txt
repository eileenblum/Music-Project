climbing 
building us up 
tearing me down 
lifted back up we are climbing 
all of this time 
drifting right back to the ground 

suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly 

questioning, and saying 
our opinions, they're failing 
they're constantly changing 
our ignorance, remaining 
we're hoping, and waiting 
we're living, but dying 
while tring to find out 
my meaning isn't planned out 
come to the conclusion 
might as well be an illusion 
while trying to find out 
i did nothing, but shut out
