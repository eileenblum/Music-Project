So you say, 
so you say it right. 
So you say, 
so you say it right. 

Waiting Below the sun, 
getting brighter.(?) 
Downstairs I dwell. 

So you say, 
so you say it right. 
So you say, 
So you say. 

Ceiling slowly squeezing me tighter, 
I'll lay down, but won't run 
Hoping now, that this can get brigter, 
and that time will come. 

So you say, 
so you say it right. 
So you say, 
So you say. 

the river is damned, 
I can't recorrect my path. 
Through this obstructed venture, 
it isn't flowing yet. 
Caught in his stare, 
electricity travels, through my wires where, 
they're reaching for it's core, electricity. 

Feeling sorry for yourself again
