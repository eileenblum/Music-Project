All kinds of pain
Tell that they asked people many questions
Someone is screaming almost from the other side
Do you know my friend? How many
Seven year old military targets
Have been killed?!!!
And they say that we are sick
Oh, and what did they do to the earth in this century?!!!
Because of corruption
And too long closed eyes
Uneven this fight is!
To enter violently into homes
To cut down trees without choice
Not giving any choice but only lies,
Which they want to build hope with
It is worth understanding
Here, cement is for you,
For us wine as red as blood!!!
...they still lie....
