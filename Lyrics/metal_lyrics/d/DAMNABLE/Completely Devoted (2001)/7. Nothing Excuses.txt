The earth will tremble
And the core will melt It will melt your bones
Only shadows will remain
What tells them to be so thoughtless
As not to know what they should stop for
What tells them to be so blind
As to run away later like a coward
The earth will tremble
When the pain explodes
The core will melt
When houses burn
It will melt your bones
When simple words fall silent
And there will be no help
Because only shadows will remain
The underwater world is endangered
Only because they want to strike a bargain
They swim holding condensed death
They do not want to understand
That nothing excuses the production of plutonium!
