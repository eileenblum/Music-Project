The sun cannot wait
The clouds are still before us
Eyes and dream, that's the end of the day
It will surely wake up tomorrow
The wind rages in the mountains
The wind knows all of us
You're not empty, you have a mountain inside you
The mountain will never break down, in which
You believe and trust, at which
You can gaze endlessly
Without ciosing your eyes, without kindling the fire of hatred,
They will never destroy the mountain!!!
It is rising again, it's wild
It will call you with its unnatural glow of the past
The night falls and the day rises.
