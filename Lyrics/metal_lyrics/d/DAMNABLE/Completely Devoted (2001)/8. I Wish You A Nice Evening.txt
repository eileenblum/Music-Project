Two earthquakes took place in Salvador
In which hundreds of people died
Twenty four years old mother has beaten her child
Who died because of wounds
Thirteen people have died and seventy have been
Wounded in a traincrash in Great Britain
In fights on Borneo have already died about
Fifteen hundred of people
I wish you a nice evening
I wish you a nice evening
Or maybe?
About six thousands of juvenile soldiers
Fight in rebel's divisions of Sudan
The bridge has broken down
And seventy persons died in Portugal
Somewhere in the planet a man was born
And somewhere ï¿½ Young Mozart " died
These messages are full of pain
So these messages must be real
Can you see that we are becoming blind
Thinking that we live beyond the horizonts of events?
I wish you a nice evening
I wish yoy a nice evening
Or maybe We are really sorry?
