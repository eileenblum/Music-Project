The picture of transmission is so alive
To create the vision of the other side
The imagination impossible to talk about
Of immaterialized Heavens
And very basic harm
For natural human structure
This is the sense of speaking
The vital energy and idea
The oldest times and beings
How realistic the truth might be
When You transform it by
Your psychic powers
Our aims will prove
The visions, realism and sound
Melted in the waves of thinking...
How realistic the truth might be
Our aims will prove
How realistic the truth might be
Our aims will prove realized dreams.
