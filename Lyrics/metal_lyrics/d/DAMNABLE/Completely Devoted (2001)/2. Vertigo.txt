As far as the fiery courage reaches
And energy which dozes in everyone
Awakened, lively look
Energy which dozes, and power
Without the concrete mask Is not an aggression, but it consistently lasts
Opens eyes All the time searches and discovers
All the time fills hearts
With fire in hands, with fire in thoughts
No plaque and no border, no miracle and no mirage
This is visible in eyes!!!
I fly thinking it is just a moment,
But it lasts eternally for me
I don't know where I'll land where I'll fall
But I accept this element of fear
What is to be, let it be
Seize this energy!!!
