Among the souls of her thick kind
You go through mental world of chaos
The sight creates the picture
Of ancient truths and ideas
Fifteen hundred years
Melted with the time
We look into the dark levels of pitiful life
We absorb the reaching
Burning in the space and time
And there... where the imagination is impossible
We are guided as the animals
We can only live.
For sure we can do it.
We have no choice
We can hear the voice
Now we are living on the Earth
And the music is our inspiration!
