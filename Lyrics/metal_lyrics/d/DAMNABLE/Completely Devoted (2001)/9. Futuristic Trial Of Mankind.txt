When we live we win!
Maybe I love it
Two sides of my ecstasy
The perfect trial of mankind...
I'm not alone
Although there is nobody around
I feel this power
Yes, they have to know
I'm not alone
I'm not alone [x4]
I fell this power [x4]
Although there is nobody around
How many times
I run aay to this side
I know it is natural born
The beauty of dying and the gift of raising up
How many times...
I know it's perfectly
Maybe I love it
I'm not alone although there is nobody around
I feel this power
Yes, they have to know
I'm not alone
Although there is nobody around
I feel this power
Yes, they have to know
I'm not alone
