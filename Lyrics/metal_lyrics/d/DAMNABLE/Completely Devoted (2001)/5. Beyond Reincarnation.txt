Unreality of livin' being
From the reality of the spirit
Immortality of people's activity
On mental surface... in the anomalies of forces
With immortal sanity of compulsion
The compulsion of life
We uncover the aim of survival
And gifted by body (flesh), falsehood and self-sanity
We conceive death...
The purity of existence surround things, acts and thoughts-invisible
No material mind
Would understand the words of humiliation
And the place of this... alegory
