Where is the light in the depths of this hole?
Lizards entiwne so no one has to know
To sleep in the warmth of enriched dark dirt
Blinding my eyes so my spirit is alert
Deepen those of my fears of the life of above
I make them reveal my earthen love
And than the earth grew cold and I felt its response

To hide is to die

Turning towards the sky
Grass bold and rich
Look not behind your eye
