In the past when the old way
Of being was no more
Survival was threatened
Exhausted by gravity
There was a need to live ease
Present time is no more
Survival is threatened
Exhausted by gravity now
There is a need to live with ease
Widespread flowering consciousness
If we remain unchanged
We recreate evolving fate
