Words whether they are vocalized
Into sounds or remain unspoken as thoughts
Can cast an almost hypnotic spell on you
You can easily lose yourself in them
And can become hypnotized into implicity
Believing, that when you attach a word to something
You know know what it is
The fact is you don't know
You have only covered up the mystery with a label
Everything, a bird, a tree, even a simple stone
And certainly a human being is ultimately unknowable

Becoming shallow, lifeless, deadened
To life unfolding around you, within
Grasping the awe inside, around you

When you stare at a flower or a bird let it be
Without imposing a word or label to it
A sense of awe and wonder arises within
A sense of the miraculous returns to your life
That was lost long ago

The quicker you attach words to things, people, or situations
The more shallow and lifeless your reality becomes
And the more deadened you become to the miracle
Of life that continuously unfolds within and around you
All we can perceive and experience is the surface
Layer of reality, less than the tip of the iceberg

Listen to silence [x2]

Words reduce reality to something the
Human mind can grasp, which isn't very much
