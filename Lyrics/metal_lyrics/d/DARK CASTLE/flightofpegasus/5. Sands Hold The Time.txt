become stillness beyond the torment of the past and the thought of what shall be create an impulse to awaken life the sky will open for a short time listen to your mind observe whats inside into your deeper realm erase the thoughts in time presence is a choice to be aware of breath be a watcher of self to prevent eternal death fear is the mass production our minds interuption for the first time ive foreseen vacancy of centuries in dreams a force that binds times course keep the dream alive by giving it time your past routine prevents awakening now is the key to liberation which will not be found in past vibrations clarity from within will reflect transformation thee reverie deep within a dream sands hold the time we hold the key
