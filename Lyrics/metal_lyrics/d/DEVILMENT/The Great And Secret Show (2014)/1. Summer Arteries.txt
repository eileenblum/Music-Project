Witch County murder party helter skelter
To the scaffold reborn
Through the haze of an August swelter
To the wind kissed rustle of the corn

Bored of the dark places
My heart races
Hellraiser's come to start a war

Pretty Miss Ballistic
Let's get... Miss Ballistic
Lets' best be optimistic for the game
Begging for our pardon
We are free to walk the garden
Things will never ever be the same

Crucifixes fail to shit and hinder us today
The sunlight doesn't spit and cinder us away

Breaking bad
The shadow clad
We promised bad
Camaraderie

Dies irae
Of red bouquets
Upon this day
A spray of summer arteries

Fixed, vile, vain, inhumane trail blazers
To the pyre return
Through the fog and the cut-throat razors
To the screams of those unwilling to burn

Bored of the dark places
My heart races
Hellraiser's come to start a war

Pretty Miss Ballistic
Don't get shitty Miss Ballistic
Best be optimistic for the game
Begging for our pardon
They are weak to make us harden
Things will never ever be the same

Never ever be the same

Burning in those angel eyes
Truly wicked angel eyes
Yearning in those angel eyes
Truly wicked angel eyes

Burning in those angel eyes
Truly wicked angel eyes
Yearning in those angel eyes
Truly wicked angel eyes

Crucifixes fail to shit and hinder us today
The sunlight doesn't spit and cinder us away

Breaking bad
The shadow clad
We promised bad
Camaraderie

Dies irae
Of red bouquets
Upon this day
A spray of summer arteries

A spray of summer arteries

Upon this day
A spray of summer arteries
