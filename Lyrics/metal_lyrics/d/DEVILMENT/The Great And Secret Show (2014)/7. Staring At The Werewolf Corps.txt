Madness
Crawling through my veins
I'm tasting blood again
The fallen lamb
In darkness
This heartache leaves a stain
And I wear this mask of Cain
For I am damned

I'm the last line of defence
The raw nerve twitching, spider sense
I break the fingers that alert me you are
Closing in there

I'm the bastard present tense
My teeth are bared and eyes intense
And I will linger on inert, before your hurt's
A closing in, yeah

Rashness
The young mistress of fear
Cavorts her pleasures here
You make the move

Not fastest
Far from the shadow's grasp
My fury paints bloodbath
Across the moon

I'm the exit straight to death
No way out and nothing fucking less
I am the royal guard to great unspoiled
Things there

I'm the final line of sight
The stay between you and the prize
I am the loyal minister boiling in the coiled
Wings, yeah

Defrost me
I'm the weird jackal - reared inhuman Entity
Don't cross me
I'm a psychopathic graphic one beast war

Accosted with fright, fingers overbite
The night delights in lost identity
And while you're wondering 'what for'?
Conscripts...
You're staring at the werewolf corps

Here in the dark
I drain your pained remaining tears
Here sated hunger gasps
With the succour of velvet dreams

And, here like the past
Desire is bound to my grasped covenant
And down here in the dark
I aspire to make you all scream

Scream

I'm the last line of defence
The raw nerve twitching, spider sense
I break the fingers that alert me you are
Closing in there

I'm the bastard present tense
My teeth are bared and eyes intense
And I will linger on inert, before your hurt's
A closing in, yeah

Defrost me
I'm the weird jackal - reared inhuman Entity
Don't cross me
I'm a psychopathic graphic one beast war

Accosted with fright, fingers over bite
The night delights in lost identity
And while you're wondering 'what for'
Hey, bitch...
You're staring at the werewolf corps
