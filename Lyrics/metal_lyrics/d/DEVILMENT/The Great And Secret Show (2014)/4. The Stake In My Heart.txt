Beating with the fury of the Valkyrie in flight
Miasma flips the triggers in my veins
Greeting immortality
Sweet realities take me high
I'm sail past derailing once again

Now
The darkness is a welcome stranger

Running with the comings of
A thousand years ago
The rites of love will soon give way to stains

I seek this freak agility, wreaked debility on
The snow
The winter night is splintered from the reins

Let's make the sun go down
Let's make the sun go down

Belfries will chime
The scratch upon the window
Whispers at your throat are divine
Oh Sister Christ
I know you're wet to get some
Share my many reasons to defy

Keener, Miss Demeanour

Lap up the blood
The wait is near-unbearable
Death is always sweeter at the start
Agree to be
There's something terrible
You shall hold a cold stake in my heart

Meaner, Miss Demeanour

I'll be your navigator
Through this whirl of frozen stars
And maybe sometimes later lady
We will light these scars

Bad Karma Sutra, the future arrives
Dancing grotesquely, caressing our lives
Behold the power the hour provides
Whipping the storm, the trees to swarm
For we will never die

My darling
We shall never die

Dancing with Devil revels on throughout
All time
Madness shall envelop in the end
So for now let us climb to the sublime
And cast aside all phantoms that portend

Let's make the sun go down
Let's make the sun go down

Open the page
The Book of Necronomicon
Shall be written solely of our deeds
Assuage the rage
Eternity goes on and on
Feeding on the font of wanton needs

Keener, Miss Demeanour

Lap up the blood
The wait is near-unbearable
Death is always sweeter it's true
Agree to be
Your skin's so wearable
You shall hold a cold stake in my heart

Meaner Madam Mina
