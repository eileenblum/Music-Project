Love is parasitic, pathogenic, a cage
Departing then absorbing the brain
That is engaged
It came to visit in a physical stage
Before the spores lay dormant
Now they leap off the page

When imposters walk among us
Am I living with the fungus

You're sucking the life from me
A vampiress of the soul
We have precious little time for kisses
Just faking control

We grew together like a mould
On a Petri dish long turned cold
Where madness traps a bitter harvest

Love is psychotropic, in my pocket a drain
And scars upon a woman-handled heart
Are so plain
Her fruiting body suited me all the same
Once this jar lay open
Now it's closed to the pain

When imposters walk among us
Are we living with the fungus?

Lost in the night
You're like the breaking of day
The setting rot on its way

Can't stop the living with the fungus

A terminal blight
Seeping on its prey
Trust is rusting away

The dead are living with the fungus

You're sucking the life from me
A vampiress of the soul
We have precious little time for kisses
Just faking control

We grew together like a disease
Overthrowing reality
Where madness reaps a bitter harvest

I should've guessed by the red
She was strictly poisonous
Sick to the stockinged gills
Breaking down my organic matter

Black trumpets announce
This destroying angel
Death cap tipped to Hell
It so tells she excels at
This fermentation

You're fucking the life from me
A murderess of the soul
We have precious little time for kisses
Just hate on a roll

We grew together like a mould
On a graveyard centerfold
Where darkness reaped a bitter harvest

Lost in the night
You're the like breaking of day
The setting rot on its way

Can't stop me living with the fungus
