In the night
By the light grown to dementia
I'm alright
It's all the others that are clearly insane

Unturning
Discerning what card to lay
I'm burning
Still learning to curb my ways

Pretty little Anna

I felt her heart like the start of a tribal beat
As the trees grew dark at the edge of her
Periphery

I'm not the wolf when I don't want to be
I dreamt a life with me the hero
But when the moon is full
And the alcohol grips my veins
Sanity hits a perfect zero

Desire
I'm alright
It's all the others that are clearly insane

Desire
Fires lick the slopes of a sick Pompeii
I'm tired
Holding roped the beast from its wicked ways

Pretty little Anna

Pretty little hammer
Bury it away

I watched her back for the lack of a front to
Play
As the sky grew black at this beauty in her
Disarray

I'm not the wolf when I don't meant to be
I dreamt a life with me the hero
But when the moon is full
And the alcohol grips my veins
Sanity hits a perfect zero

Sanity hits a perfect zero when you're around
My feet don't touch the ground

Spirited away to a distant shore
Driven to a madness sweet and virginal

What sights!
What rights does she have to steal my mind
Again?
Those cold eyes given her away

They given her away
Give her away
Give her away to this passion plague

I'm not the wolf when I don't want to be
I dreamt a life with me the hero
But when the moon is full and the alcohol grips my veins
Sanity hits a perfect zero

Grips my veins
Its a perfect zero
It grips my veins
