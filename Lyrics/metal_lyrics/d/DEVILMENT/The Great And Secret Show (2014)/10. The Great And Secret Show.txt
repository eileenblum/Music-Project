She
She brought the enemy down
She brought the Great and Secret Show
To my surrender
I, pretender to the crown

She
She's a vessel for peace
She's a trophy of war that caws
Like an omen of darkness
Meditating on the welcoming feast

The Great and Secret Show
Takes away the scars
But will you ever know?

She
She brought the pessimist round
She brought the Great and Secret Show
To my dilemma
Forgotten property to astound

And through
Through the eyes of the storm
Through the tragic and the magical
Celebrations
My sky was soon reborn

The Great and Secret Show
Glitters like the stars
Upon the festive snow

The Great and Secret Show

Great and secret
Sow to truly reap it
Phantasmagoric
Fateful, categoric
Show...

On the cusp of your decided suicide
She comes
An offered kiss, a glimpse of fate

If you reject her
Shun the gifts for lifting fear
She'll bring awful nightmares crawling here

But if you take her hand tonight
Slid, gloved about your waist
She'll show you Christmas in deliria
Love's sweetest taste

She
She brought the circus to town
She brought the Great and Secret Show
With slick agenda
To mend this irksome clown

And she
Like a vision of art
She opened my eyes to a world of
Fresh adventure
In absentia from the dark

The Great and Secret Show
Glitters like the stars
Upon the festive snow

The Great and Secret Show

Great and secret
Hard to really keep
Phantasmagoric
Glad I fucking saw it
Show...
