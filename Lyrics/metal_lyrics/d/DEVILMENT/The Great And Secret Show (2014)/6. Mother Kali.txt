Beast of prey
The ender of days
Dancing fill the livid skies
With the madness in those eyes
Drunk on blood and slaughter
Apocalypse's daughter
Goddess depravity
Come unbridled unto me

Mother Kali, Kali Maa
Cover Partly
Mother Kali, Kali Maa
Oh, lover darkly
Start this party divali

Start this party darkly
Start this party darkly
Start this party darkly

Hiss disdain
Mistress of pain
A brace of scars caress her
Naked limbs bedeck her
Up-lit by fire
Monstrous with desire
She rides, harbinger of
Death, the great vampire

Mother Kali
Kali Maa
Oh cover Partly
Shiva's starred peninsula

Mother Kali
Kali Maa
Oh, lover darkly
Start this party Mardi Gras

Let's go!

The heavens bow before you
The cemeteries adore you
Though daemon lords abhor you
For the creature that you are

She is the totality of nature
Liberator, desecrator, one with god

Bliss regained
Beauty untamed
Sighs untie the knots of time
And bind me to your alibi
Give up your secret
The worlds you've burnt to keep it...

Temper dead endeavours and
Put down you vicious swords

Mother Kali
Kali Maa
Oh cover Partly
Shiva's starred peninsula

Mother Kali
Kali Maa
Oh, lover darkly
Start this last evisceration
