The shine is sipped
The exquisitely drained
I find the grip in my gut
Is religiously pained
Borne for a spiritual gain

I embrace this catharsis
The taste of this forbidden fruit
One taste, I'm in thrall to the darkness
And yes, I guess
I'm a willing recruit

The shine is sipped
Soporific and caned
I dream the seizing of the keys
To the astral plane
Deep in this decadent sleep

I embrace this catharsis
The taste of this forbidden fruit
One taste, I'm in thrall to the darkness
And yes, I guess
I'm too eager to loot

This eve is thrilled by toasts
And the stars intoxicate me

I am in love
My heart is swimming with the sallow moon
Drifting above
Her secret altar

My pen is quilled with hosts
And they foster flotsam poetry

Wing me the past
The now and then weds with the all-too soon
I mean it to last
My soul is burning...

I bid thee night-night
Opiate daze
Takes me until daybreak

It sees me right, right
Set in my ways
Utopian worlds await my coming

Living in the red in a black
And white sea
Never on the level of Illuminata
Dancing with the dead in the cemetery
I'm running with the devil with the
Most stigmata

I embrace this catharsis
The taste of this forbidden fruit
One taste, I'm in thrall to the darkness
And yes, I guess
I'm a willing recruit

My marriage to the baggage of life and
Death's annulled

I am in love
My heart is swimming with the sallow moon
Drifting above
Her secret altar

A greater plan has batched in my
Laudanum skull

Drinking the balm
She's the painted, tainted hand of doom
Sinking to calm
My maniac psalters
