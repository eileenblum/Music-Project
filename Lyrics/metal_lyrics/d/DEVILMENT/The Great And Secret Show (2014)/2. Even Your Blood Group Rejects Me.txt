Remember
Last December
Winterâs temper
Drew your surrender
We were huddled by the blazing hearth
I mustâve been befuddled by
Your witchcraft

And as the embers died
I threw in with the madness
By the fireside
I threw in with the madness
In those tired eyes
I threw in with the madness
Denied and by an by
Driven to demand

Dressed for the guest to show
Spirit before the blow
So press on the net to know
Iâll never let you go
No need to fantasize
Time to intensify
No one will climb this high
Ever again

I flick the switch
You choose the volts
Still spitting deep dark dagger insults
Youâre still a bitch
I ooze revolt
Painful to see
Even you blood group rejects me

Remember
This September
My distemper
Like Edmund Kemperâs
Finds you shackled to the fruit cellar bed
Mine the faculty for
Losing my head

And as I watch you writhe
I soak up all the badness
Against my other brides
I soak up the badness
In my loverâs eyes
I soak up all the badness
Despised and by the by
Driven to command

Dressed for the guest to show
Spirit before the blow
So press on the net to know
Iâll never let you go
No need to fantasize
Time to intensify
No one will climb this high
Ever again

I flick the witch
You choose the volts
Still spitting deep dark dagger insults
Youâre still a witch
I ooze revolt
Painful to see
Even you blood group rejects me

Even you blood group rejects me

Pour forth your hate
We have all life entwined to subjugate it

Dressed for the guest to show
Hatred and vertigo
So press on the net to know
Iâll never let you go
No need to fantasize
Time to intensify
No one will climb this high
Ever again

No...
