I walked alone
Through streets lit precarious
Never caring, never sharing
A ghost that chose to roam

I walked alone
Through forests hung with shame
Pretending, a rose ending
Waited in the wings and spoke my name

What days were wasted
Walling in our lies
While the world appeared amazing
But blindly passed us by?

See our spirits soar
Hear the thunder pound across the sky
For if we're bound to die
Let's die alive

Oh God I know we've both done wrong
But screw the moral tide
Only pain resides
Entangled in our pride

I swam alone
In the rivers of the dead
But dreaming, never seeing
Beauty come so close

I swam alone
In those eyes so damn morose
Unyielding
I beat down the fucking doors
Until they broke

What days were wasted
Walling in our lies
While the world appeared amazing
But blindly passed us by?

What dreams once tasted
Swiftly stole goodbye?
My other, discover
Our souls are meant to shine

See our spirits soar
Hear the thunder pound across the sky
For if we're bound to die
Let's die alive

Oh God I know we've both done wrong
But screw the moral tide
Only pain resides
Entangled in our pride

Now the stars are righted, brightly
Lets put our knives aside

I had a vision
No, more a nightmare
Frightened past compare
Sights bored through a morbid quagmire
Conspired where
I saw scored corruption
On the face of a wraith passed in despair
I don't wanna die like the sign I saw
Of me alone and unloved there

See our spirits soar
Hear the thunder pound across the sky
For if we're bound to die
Let's die alive

Oh God I know we've both done wrong
But screw the moral tide
Only pain resides
Entangled in our pride
