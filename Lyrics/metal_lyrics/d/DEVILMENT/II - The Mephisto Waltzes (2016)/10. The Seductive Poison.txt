Under a sky that spoke dryly and highly
Though some would say plainly, come given the view
Of dust devil prairies, a scary deluge
Poised to drum, thunderheads edged into blue

I fell in a bar, like the clouds from afar
Seemed no more a dream than the stars
Gambling, a Lamb of God, demons contest
Eighty proof truths, twenty-twenty the rest

A Dionysian pull
To the lion's den
I'm a confident fool
Under the moonshine's prowess

I rise again
Ten thousand men in chorus
Could not defend
Against nor bend this tempered Horus

And give or take
I break the sacred vow
This hour was never my goal
For on my knees
The thirst decrees
I now bow to the power of alcohol

Raised glasses praise spirits, a lyrical toast
To the Djinn in my veins and the unholy ghost
Fires are licking, the sickness inbred
The thrall of the bottle, full throttle ahead

I feel the spread of my wings
Across the spiteful mountainside
A dreaded raptor sings
Of delightful flames intensifying

Dark forces rule
The whinges of my flesh
Of course I fall
But always binge afresh

I rise again
Ten thousand men in chorus
Could not defend
Against nor bend this tempered Horus

And give or take
I break the sacred vow
This hour was never my goal
For on my knees
The thirst decrees
I now bow to the power of alcohol

Sekhmet save me
I am not the man that the plan has favoured
Opened gravely
I flounder onward drowned in bliss

Sekhmet save me
I am just a boy that the poison's savoured
Opened gravely
I am but a slave to the abyss

I will rise again
I'll plummet from the summit
But I'll rise again

I will rise again
I'll plummet from the summit
But I'll rise again

I will rise again
I will rise again
