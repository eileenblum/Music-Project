I've gone as far as I can break
Her funeral left all in its wider wake
I'm damned but still I'm running
My assassins, still they're coming
Suitors commence
The future repents

Beauty looked me in the face
I sold my soul for her embrace
But Heaven was a fleeting taste
And Hell came openly

Disfigurement and exile further woe
Cast from castle walls to serve below
Cradled in her arms and then let go
To the moat and potent sea

With a love so overwhelming me
Tragedy just came to be

Garroted by the past
Laughed at by the scars
Got it in the arse
By the Lightning God's decree

Destined to fester
Where time's ripples echo tsunamis

Never knowing what the morrow brings for me
I'm a fallen angel on the wing
What words of sorrow will they sing for me
As I face my plight eternal?

Murder on the Devil's highway
Dark figures point clawed fingers my way
What wicked debts will I repay
Dragged screaming to the pit?

Hunted like a dog
Unrelenting on the scent of loss
Demons ravage everyone I cross
I'm a fugitive under-lit

From a hate so overwhelming me
I feel the heat scourge at my back

Burning with the past
How long can I last?
Horror sits aghast
At the frightening depths I've seen

Courting the onslaught
This is what they get if they FUCK with me!

Never knowing what the morrow brings for me
I'm a fallen angel on the wing
What words of sorrow will they sing for me
As I face my plight eternal?

As I face my plight eternal

The flood is quickening
The dark is drawing in like vulture claws
My blood is thickening for the war

When the moon's been taken by the storm
And the night is rife with tribulation
Think of me as I have you, lovelorn
Our day will come, whatever the sumâ¦

Of our suffering

Of our suffering

Our day will come, whatever the sumâ¦

Of our suffering

Of our suffering
