Midnight swiftly gathers up her gown
And follows Cinderella
Fleeing from the castle grounds
Back to her swallowed cellar

She's no ordinary fairy tale
In contrary quite the diva
For every second spent with her
Bites with a slow and potent fever

Mad as a hatter, does it matter
If the sky burns red or purple?

I love her more than wicked words can say
Insanity is a plot to lean on
My heart will darken come what may
I sing the theme song

She disturbs the moral way
I walk the night, I sleep the day
Lest my lips will deeply miss her
Dea Della Morte

Dea Della Morte

Dark side of the honeymoon
I'm Jeckyll to her Heidi Klum
The real-life Creature From The Black Lagoon
Caught swimming in her dreams

Abducting, conducting
Shared erotic deeds, stroke fantasies
I plucked her out of classified for my needs

Miss Twin Peaks seeks asylum seeker
From a broken soul, for ventures

Pearls in a whirlwind, come what may
Insanity is a purse to cling to
I love you more than wicked words can say
Thanks to my curse, dementia

She disturbs the moral way
I walk the night, I sleep the day
Lest my lips will deeply miss her
Dea Della Morte

She disturbs the moral way
I walk the night, I sleep the day
Press my kisses, deep abysser
Dea Della Morte

Dea Della Morte

She is the flame that flickers in rickety heaven
I am the torch, debauchery covets my name
And we are both together forever fornever to sever
Our bond beyond the pale and windowless pane

She disturbs the moral way
I walk the night, I sleep the day
Lest my lips will deeply miss her
Dea Della Morte

She disturbs the moral way
I walk the night, I sleep the day
Press my kisses, deep abysser
Dea Della Morte

Dea Della Morte
