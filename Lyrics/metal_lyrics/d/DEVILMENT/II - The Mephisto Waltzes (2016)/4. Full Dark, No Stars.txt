Hark, the feral angels bring
The black shadow over everything
Hark, the feral angels bring
The black shadow

On the Devil's trail
The road is blind
I can't speak for you
I don't know your crimes

Your bitter heart
Has us entwined
I feel its edge
Cut through my mind

It could be you
It could be me
That holds the key
To my own reason
My freedom

Sick of the nightmares
Gripped with these fears of guilt
Ground under their stares
Drowned in the tears spilt

What if the 'what ifs' take control
I am lost forever to this
Disgust, what have I done?
I'm slipping to enter another dementia

Nowâ¦
Spiteful nights draw claw marks upon my door
And I'm more than sorry than I've ever been before
Vultures circle numbers up, their caws assure
There's no path back along this grasping, deep black shore

On the Devil's trail
The road is blind
I can't speak for you
I don't know your crimes

Your bitter heart
Has us entwined
I feel its edge
Cut through my mind

It could be you
It could be me
That holds the key
To my own reason
My freedom

Sick of the nightmares
Gripped with these fears of guilt
Ground under their stares
Drowned in the tears spilt

What if the 'what ifs' take control
I am lost forever to this
Disgust, what have I done?
I'm slipping to enter another dementia

Now
The callous sun descends
Upon all my dreams

Think of the world I left behind
While chasing demons in my mind
I pitched into the dark

Who could've know they'd find me there
And in the depths of my despair
Imprison me inside and take control?

Take my soulâ¦

Break me down
Lift me up
To be dashed on the rocks of Hell
I am but  an empty cup
Where once my life's blood overwhelmed

Break me down
Lift me up
To be dashed on the rocks of Hell
But this is but a quick hiccup
If I should rise from where I fell

On the Devil's trail
The road is blind
I can't speak for you
I don't know your crimes

Your bitter heart
Has us entwined
I feel its edge
Cut through my mind

It could be you
It could be me
That holds the key
To my own reason
My freedom

Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom

Hark, the feral angels bring
The black shadow over everything
Hark, the feral angels bring
The black shadow over everything
Hark, the feral angels bring
The black shadow over everything

Hark, the black shadow over everything
Hark, the black shadow over everything
