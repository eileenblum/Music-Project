Come summon the storm
The high plains of the mind
Invoking these drifters again

Drums are becoming
Tattooed and defined
Through ink drops
Of great spiritual rain

Incense is cloying
Raised campfires blaze
Behind our defences

A perimeter fence
To distance the sane

Under the thunder
The War Dancers writhe
In ted feathers dressed
Flesh pressed to the sky

A clawed metamorphosis
Quickens the eye
Tornadoes are at our disposal

Never will enemy lives
Darken our hearts and survive
Hell will be hearkened tonight
Full retribution decides
So now unholy
Death
She starts her canter
And with the ghostly
Under the thunder we ride

Whip up the sloven
Ex-lover of war
Her beauty has softened with age
Spread out her wings
Her legs sing to be bored
The Kraken is itching to wake

Dark clouds are gathered
A slathering bloom
Behind our offensive
Masked in a vast
Exaltation of doom

Under the thunder
The War Dancers writhe
A dread single purpose to usher demise
Try not to provoke
The black smoke to arise
Signalling massive reprisal

Never will enemy lives
Darken our hearts and survive
Hell will be hearkened tonight
Full retribution decides
So now unholy
Death
She starts her canter
And with the ghostly
Under the thunder we ride

Here we go

Our braves are running
Forgiveness not to be
Wave upon wave keep coming
To claim your scalp

Heartbeats flicker with velocity
Manitou steers the reins
Burning with liquor ferocity
Careers throughout their veins

Under the thunder
The War Dancers arrive
Valour and vengeance
Aflame within their eyes
Forever fear the Reaper
Fell creepers in the snow
Living in the shadow of the inevitable
Warhammer blow

Worm caste of men
Don't cross our hunting grounds again
The reason spite that brooked no invitation
Just understand the brutal hand that strikes is always there
To take away your celebrations
To break your paltry aspirations
