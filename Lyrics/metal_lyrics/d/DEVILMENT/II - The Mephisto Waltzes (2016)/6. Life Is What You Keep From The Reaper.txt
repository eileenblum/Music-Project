Life is what you keep from the Reaper
Life is what you keep from the Reaper

Now freedom has come again
Life is what you get to keep from the Reaper
He never makes amends

Lovers here we go
Not too slow
Let the night accelerate towards the mystery show

If the beasts at our back, hunting pack
Reenact their bloody spree
I'll be letting you know

Half the lights are on in Heaven

Through Hell
Do well
Soon tell
We are the stars
The dark between them whispers
Through Hell
We are the ones
Do well
The sons and daughters of the storms
Soon tell
And we were undone
The sons and sinner sisters

Life is what you keep from the Reaper

The world awaits with fated breath
Life is what you get to keep from the Reaper
Adventure baiting Death

Awake, overdosed
Not too close
We're the ghostly last descendants of a past comatose

Survivors from the crack, dressed in black
Never looking back
Now our powder keg is itching to blow

Hall the lights are off in Heaven

Through Hell
Do well
Soon tell
We are the stars
The dark between them whispers
Through Hell
We are the ones
Do well
The sons and daughters of the storms
Soon tell
And we were undone
The sons and sinner sisters

Neutered, dumb
Enslaved by slimy traders who paraded the means
Putrid scum
On a tiny pool beside an ocean of dreams

I will throw my middle finger at them
When they're begging
When they're begging in Hell

We will throw our middle fingers at them
When they're begging
When they're begging in Hell

We will throw our middle fingers at them
When they're begging
When they're begging in Hell

We will throw our middle fingers at them
When they're begging
When they're begging in Hell

Through Hell
Do well
Soon tell
We are the stars
The dark between them whispers
Through Hell
We are the ones
Do well
The sons and daughters of the storms
Soon tell
And we were undone
The sons and sinner sisters

Life is what you keep from the Reaper
