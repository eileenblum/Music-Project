Unleash the creature

I am the dark
A thing most feared that has torn asunder
The laws of nature in my time

Electric spark
Not cunt-born but graveyard plunder
Spare parts of traitors and their cruelest kind

I am a crime
Blame me JudasStein

I'm hating on my maker
A judgment day day-breaker
Unnamed, they call me undivine
Father made me
JudasStein

A composite freak
Mankind's greatest bastard ashtray
Hanging by my heart with my guts chewed out
Priesthoods shout, "Take him away!"

"Take him away!"

I am the path
Trodden in the irons, kissed in betrayal
A monstrous cog turned by a higher will

I bear these scars
The suicide's noose, the hate of aeons
Stitched to evil for the victim on the hill

I'm hating on my maker
A judgment day day-breaker
Unnamed, they call me undivine
Father save me
JudasStein

JudasStein
JudasStein

An Adam of fool's labour
Shut out from Paradise
Without an Eve
A second me, oh God!
Bereft of hope for all eternityâ¦

Help me!

I greet the night with open arms
To strangulate, to wring its charms
Squeezing the spite from out its veins

I'm a Bluebeard, bloodbeast, bugafuckingboo
Scapegoat for the sins you'll all do
A purse of thirty pieces sewn
Together in a rage

I won't welcome pity, only love
Acceptance is a virtue of those high above
Now the need to hurt you fits me like a glove
Upon an obscene hand

A composite freak
Mankind's greatest bastard ashtray
Hanging by my heart with my guts chewed out
Priesthoods shout, "Take him away!"

I'm hating on my maker
A judgment day day-breaker
Unnamed, they call me undivine
Father save me
JudasStein
