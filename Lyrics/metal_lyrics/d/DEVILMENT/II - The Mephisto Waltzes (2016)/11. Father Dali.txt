Mother was a dancer in the Folies BergÃ¨re
Where Father took a shine to her legs in the air
And I was thrown to mysticism
From the schism sewn there

Squirming in the light
Burning, erudite
A yearning parasite, au pair

Dearest Papa was a rolling stone
Calling to the cosmos on the lobster telephone

Clocks are melting
Helter skeltering

Children with mouths to feed, breed in squalor
How paternity turns from thee, Avida Dollars
Ready to make a scene, we'd rather parley
Now eternity worms in thee, Father Dali

Surrealist, can I feel this dark creative energy?
Tortured by my demons and my insecurities
Swans reflecting elephants, ants swarming killer bees

Loather, lover, rake
I overcompensate
A supernova fate to be

Dearest Papa was a rolling stone
Galling fellow mutants with his bellowed overtones

Clocks are melting
Helter skeltering

Bending the arts to lead the starch dog collars
How modernity learns from thee, Avida Dollars
Ready to make a scene, we'd rather parley
Now eternity worms in thee, Father Dali

Thus I finally find inside me
Her spirit rising, all-confiding

It's calling out to be
A voice on the wind
Pulling me closer
Screaming in my dreams
Haunting me

Mi Amorâ¦

Feverous with wealth and gain
Showmanship will leave a stain
Canvasses are mine to pain

A monumental mentalist
Mephisto born out of the tryst
I am this bastard narcissist

Do not judge my excesses
It's best to merely see
A flamboyant clairvoyant
Buoyant on fantasies

The Great Masturbator
My fate will come later

Clocks are melting
Helter skeltering

Your children have mouths to feed, our leader hollers
How paternity turns from thee, Avida Dollars
Ready to make a scene, we'd rather party
Now eternity worms in thee, Father Dali

Father Dali
Father Dali
