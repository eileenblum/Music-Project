I awaken like a cause for war
Not a pause for thought at all
Every note plucked 'til its worse
In disarray
I feel superhuman then
No enemies can take me when
Squealing lust erupts again
Just at her name

I have her running through my veins
Like heroin whispers 24/7
The flame remains the same

She is everywhere and I swear everything
Is but a piece of her Heaven

Sugared with the sweet
My heart beats a rose tattoo
Through the levitating soles of my feet

She is the sunâ¦
Shine on Sophie Moone

She is the sun that fells the gloom
Climb on
Shine on
Shine on Sophie Moone

She is exquisite, a visit from an angel
Enabled and fabled her
Muster the power not to crawl
I picture incidents, coincidences, soft offences
Just a million little tricks to witness consequences
Please take me wanton for a fool

She is the sun that fells the gloom
Climb on
Shine on
Shine on Sophie Moone

Shine on Sophie Moone

Life returns to my yearning shores
Mist it lifts to drop its jaw
I am burning to the core
In varying decrees
She ampoules adrenaline
Butterflies flutter by on her wind
Just one wish to start the spin
Into her sea

I have her running through my brains
Like tearaway airwaves 24/7
The game remains the same

She is everywhere and I swear everything
Is but a piece of her Heaven

Viral blonde
She responds
Her infection making my white crust leaven

She is the sun that fells the gloom
Climb on
Shine on
Shine on Sophie Moone

She is the sun that fells the gloom
Climb on
Shine on
Shine on Sophie Moone

She is the sun that bleeds the strangely red horizon
The world could end
For all I know
Still smitten by her glow

That desirable whore
She just stood there in the spotlight
Like a substitute Valkyrie
In barely a dress, grinning
Mockingâ¦

And her eyes, set with a flash of diamonds
Seeing me with something akin to thin disgust
I didn't care she didn't love me
I just wanted her so fucking badly
It stung like murder

Tearaway stars shine on Sophie Moone

I'm sorry if the words get stuck in your flirty, dirty craw
I'm sorry but it hurts far more to sheathe my claws
