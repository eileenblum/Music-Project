Eyes of time to me
there's no limit come back
death is a toy them
but my mind still roundabout
I can see the beginning
the first cult under the moon

but now I am,
into the sea cell-beign

I can go,
I can see,
Across the spheres
My cambric dream

Demential architecture,
that no concived by human race
flowers and mud,
let's walk into the humid forest

look out the temple
niarlatotep is venerated here
this cave in the wall,
megaliptic repose for my body

I can go...

Mega criptic noises coming from the forest
I can see the temples of archetipic gods

Celular sea,
plis protect me now
I was in the cult,
leave my mind dirty now
horror is follow me,
I need penetrate in the deeps,
protectme of my dream
this deadly dream

I can see,
I can go,

Across the spheres
My cambric dream
