[Klemp , Lubitzki]

Liquid A to A Geymour K
Chill line U to love craft U to lovecraft Q
Liquid C to Geymour C to Geymour P
Robots form their head loops, form their head loops to:

New machine wisdom
A cocaine spirit system
Million dollar stories and headlines
Reporter screams ask the machines
'bout their fancies on addictive day dreams
and 'bout love instinct

Media term point, term point live in Bern
The museums of technics, robots get their food
Drug chips are their software, they spell Geymour K
Robots form their head loops, form their head loops to:

New machine wisdom
A cocaine spirit system
Million dollar stories and headlines
Reporter screams ask the machines
'bout their fancies on addictive day dreams
and 'bout love instinct

Liquid A to A Geymour K
Chill line U to love craft U to lovecraft Q
Liquid C to Geymour C to Geymour P
Robots form their head loops, form their head loops to:

New machine wisdom
A cocaine spirit system
Million dollar stories and headlines
Reporter screams ask the machines
'bout their fancies on addictive day dreams
and 'bout love instinct

Give me the pounding of your heart
says the drug machine in million yelling dollar story lines
We cannot see the ancient dreams,
but we like to live the space dynamics
and we hate museums.
