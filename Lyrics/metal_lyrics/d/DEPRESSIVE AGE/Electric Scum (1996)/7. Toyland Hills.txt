[Schallenberg , Lubitzki]

I see the hinding places in the laundry yard
and a sunny day to play
We were the key kids in the T-block city part
but where are they today?

I cannot tell you things 'bout wild woods
but 'bout the toy land hills
to our local scrap place area
where fancy ruled our skills

Motors, bicycles, radios
We gave the things new forms
Strange vehicles on concrete
The matter was reborn

I recognize two eyes behind the window pane
in the block in front of this
They look like my first love, like waiting on a train
I feel she sends a kiss

I cannot tell you things 'bout wild woods
but 'bout the dream land hills
in our local scrap place area
where fancy ruled our skills

Cases, candles and board walls
The wedding cave was formed
First embraces and shy lips
A new instincts was born

Strange vibrations for concrete
We gave the things new forms
Strange vibrations for concrete
The matter was reborn
