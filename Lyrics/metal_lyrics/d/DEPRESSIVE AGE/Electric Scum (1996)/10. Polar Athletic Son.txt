[Klemp , Lubitzki]

In the icey village, where the rumours whisper
through the easter morning song
stands the biggest cradle in the laser chapel
for the birth of "Wasp the Kong"

Chill fills the aquarium's blastnig scum
Here waits the polar athletic son

All I want to the birth of "Wasp Te Kong"
Son in the easter morning song
to feed new shape's Kwoud Hsou Hloun
Scientists found a system to let have him several parents
but not only men
Sportslords and bacteriums in his mother's whale cell
lie in aquanautic trance

Chill fills the aquarium's blastnig scum
Here waits the polar athletic son
