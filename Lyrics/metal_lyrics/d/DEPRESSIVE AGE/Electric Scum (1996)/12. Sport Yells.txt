[Schallenberg , Lubitzki]

Cartridge siedges of racer teams
slide in tubes through icey streams,
slide in curve from 6 and 8
Thrills in centigrades
Suits as tight as second skin
Proud electric masculine
Chests that wear the cycled line
and the crystal sign

Go, go, go, go
Thrills yells reach the gates

Polar sports fans in their seats
watch exactly how second speed
Telescopes move left to right,
uniform and tight
Now the nations show their class
and reportes boil the mass
Mass could push the resonance
for a winning chance

Go,
go, go, go
Thrills in centigrades
Sports yells reach the gates

To study sports and technics drives our cosmonautic gear
The new intelligence rises up to space career
The blocks of victory are hard to climb for test processes
Young men are moved when medals pounding on their
chests

Go,
go, go, go
Thrills in centigrades
Sports yells reach the gates
