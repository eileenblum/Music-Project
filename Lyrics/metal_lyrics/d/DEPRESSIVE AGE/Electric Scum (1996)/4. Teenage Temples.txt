[Klemp , Lubitzki]

World war archives fill the offices
of the cold war parties to research
the psycho base
in the influence and cause they
need free young slaves

Teenage temples spread
their wings
fly to young men's shore
to send information vibes
to let us know much more.

This is the film where the children shoes burn
where the windy hills of clothes smoke
in the autumn rain
Once upon a time? No it's yet today.

High tech preachers shake their legs
in an ethic scene
New religions leave this ball
with pillar feet on screens

Ride your way my love machine
Conscience, break my stones
Give me the sixth sense for words
and the wide wave phones

Ride your way my love machine
Conscience, break my stones
Give me the sixth sense for words
and the wide wave phones

Teenage temples spread
their wings
fly to young men's shore
to send information vibes
to let us know much more.

Ride your way my love machine
Conscience, break my stones
Give me the sixth sense for words
and the wide wave phones

Ride your way my love machine
Conscience, break my stones
Give me the mechanic sting
and the wide wave phones
