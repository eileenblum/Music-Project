[Schallenberg , Lubitzki]

In the synthetic clink
flows Retron the moon milk drink
Metamorphosis turns ravishing
Liquid waves quard the bowl
A star leads the Retron soul

Cairo has focused countdown to 0

Airport please come 6481
Airport 6481 focus 1
Airport please come 6481
Airport 6481 focus 1
(to merge all holy lines)

'Round the planes moves the Cairo Crabat
as fast as hundred twisted light lines
'Round the planes moves the Cairo Crabat
as bright as the requiem of mars

Spiral staircases sit
in the Cheops pyramid
This ropes of DNA strive one way
Straight from the axis feet
up to the milky streets
'til Cairo recieves the OK repeat.

'Round the planes moves the Cairo Crabat
as fast as hundred twisted light lines
'Round the planes moves the Cairo Crabat
The navel cord of moon's birth
