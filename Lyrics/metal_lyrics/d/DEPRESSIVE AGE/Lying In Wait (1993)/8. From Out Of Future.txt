[Klemp , Habermann]

Once upon a time on this planet
A sudden cry broke the peaceful silence
As an old man stood on the edge of the world
Staring with tired eyes into the endless sky

There's a secret, and with regret
He looks eastwards, there where the sunrise starts
Since aeons the faith lived on, one day they will come from outer space
With an ardent look, he's awaiting them, the ancestors of a lost race

And soon his longing will be rewarded
A giant arrow will tear heaven apart
Unseen creatures coming down
And just mysteries are left for those who came as the next

There's a secret, and with regret
He looks eastwards, there where the sunrise starts

Some centuries later, chaos rules in nature, the old man died long ago
The ancient tradition's wiped out by the arrogance of mankind

One day a flash will point at the grave,
Another old man will go there again
He'll hear the weeping from inside the grave
While they're waiting for a new sign of the strangers

Smash the secrets, feel no regrets
Oh see how nice, this last sunrise

Smash all secrets, feel no regrets
Oh see how nice, this last sunrise
