[Klemp , Habermann]

Mother got pregnant by rape
Identical twins came to being, but they were different in their minds
The fatal flaw was the bad disposition
Two charactes in black opposition
The birth of the twins started this game
And relieved mother from the shame
So we grew up...

-Often I saw you caressing your cat
I devised evil plans, you did not smell a rat
-I told you 'bout things you won't understand
Rays of hope are fading, why can't we become friends?
-Feel the fascination of obscure ideas
Where is room for love? I want to take and never give

-Eclipse and enlightenment since cosmogony
But I'll laugh at your obsequies when you kiss my feet
-You made me cry, then you licked off my tears
Nevertheless I will love you, but replaced love with
-Vibrations fill our discord, I'm craving for the pleasure
I feel when creatures praise me in agony...and die!

-Always before I fall asleep
I sense your presence, Mom, like a good night-kiss
My clown forgot all his jokes, my snowman has melted to tears
When he ripped off my dolls and stuck hails in their furry ears
-Permanent pain release, fantastic disharmony
Injustice is put on stage, you and me in one cage
Die fly! Kiss the abyss!
Arise! Who's wise?
-You never stayed hungry when you smelt the taste of blood
While I taught the wolves crying and broke black widow's heart
We can live, we can die, but always together, forever apart
-Control saves the state, piece falls my hate
No hope still for escape, we follow the cosmic trace
Good and evil
Who wins? The eternal twins!

-Ametric destiny, preposterous comedy
-Atomal overtones, aesthetic abscess
-Immortalized tears, paralyzed fears
-Under a spell in condemned cell

-Loose or bear the bell
-At any rate I'll see you in hell
