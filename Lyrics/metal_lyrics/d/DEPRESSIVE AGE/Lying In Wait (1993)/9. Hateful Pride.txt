[Klemp , Lubitzki]

I am a murderer
No remorse in sin
Kill you fast and sure
My trouble within
Drugdealer you're my enemy
Explanations for what I do?
The roots of your character for the ones you took
Now it's time to break the rules

To sell them short good times
More to bring them the grief
You came on all strong to breed your big crime greed
Deep and deeper in me it burns and I cannot deny my eyes
Human pride is on my side
And I shoot with my hateful pride

She was the sunrise, but she is faint
She's disguised as a new shape
For a new life with a new name
Why is she fading her own way to destroy herself on his side?
Oh why?
No, I fight no inner fight to keep in the fright
That killed her guide
