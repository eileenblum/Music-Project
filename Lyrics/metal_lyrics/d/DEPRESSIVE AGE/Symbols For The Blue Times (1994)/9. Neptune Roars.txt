[Grigoleit , Lubitzki]

Here we live in our wide sea, the occupants in a poisoned zoo
All the woods in water get higher and tigheter too.
Sword fishes have changed their swords
Pairs of scissors on their mouth
They hunt a crowd of whales
from west to east, from north to south

Neptune roars, he's mistreated
Down below kill the dealers and the prong comes out

Carnival from outside,
what strange clownfishes try to imitate fools?
Ironfishes disturb our silence
When they fall down to the seabottom
They don't move, did they die?
why do they have no decay?
Black Mood flows eternal
and it's taste is strange, so strange

Neptune roars, he's mistreated
Down below kill the dealers and the prong comes out
