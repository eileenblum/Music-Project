[Schallenberg , Lubitzki]

I am longing for the day
when my spirit comes back again
In this moments when I'm down
I just have to shake these thougts out

Friends deep within me let's save our brain
Let me see mistakes, I want to be back again

Lightning comes to write my course of life
Beginning in early times
Recollections flow through my hand
What flies suppressed in my self-confidence

Friend deep within me let's save our brain
Let me see mistakes, I want to be back again
Friend deep within me let's save our brain
Roots in my childhood try to explain

What is wrong in the scenes of the mirror
We can never save its fall even with fast claws
What is wrong in the scenes of the mirror
No one every saves its fall even with fastest claws

Dear me, let the words out of me, as true as they can
All ropes that I've made for me get burnt try my friend

Bright sound into my fears when I hear you
with the keys to our frankness, what a good mood
Bright sound into my fears when I hear you
and we use this fancy tools for mind-hope

Dear me, let the words out of me, as true as they can
We dance 'round the fire, only me and my friend
All ropes that I've made for me get burnt by my friend
We dance 'round the fire, we're back again

Never let it end, never lose my hand
We dance 'round the fire, yes we're back again!
