[Grigoleit , Lubitzki]

First dead on this sunny day
Solar rays have taken
mother's life away to transform it
in veils so soft and thin
that overcast our whole earthball thing

Goodbye take your course
Thank you for all your love
Don't wait for your son. Goodbye

Raise now, spread your soft veils wide
and beginn to slide
through all bad brains and through all the blame that rules
In these dangerous fools
Before a new destruction comes

Mother salvation
Stick the needle on your halo in this earth to suck out all our hell!
Don't wait for your son, Goodbye

Take good care on your vacation
think that you slide with me
Fatal holes in all directions
Please don't slip away from here, my dear
We need you in our sphere

Mother salvation
Stick the needle on your halo in this earth to suck out all our hell!
Goodbye take your course
Thank you for all your love
Don't wait for your son
Stick the needle on your halo in this earth to suck out all our hell!
Goodbye
