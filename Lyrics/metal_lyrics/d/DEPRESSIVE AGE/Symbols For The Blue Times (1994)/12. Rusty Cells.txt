[Klemp , Lubitzki]

Here's the spray set for the ozon health
and the glasses to see 'round all corners and bends
My mind is happy, thinking 'bout a ball
and at the same time the media spits out
the reality of war

So it's rust in all the cells
Santa Claus wipes the jingle bells
Never their harmonies reach old charme
Guns sending their greetings without alarms

Peace for hip waste, business called love
cigarette strength, beauty on the rocks
Internet freaks work with holy trends
'til four ill seasons, working at the same time,
are the last thing on earth what's left

So it's rust in all the cells
Santa Claus wipes the jingle bells
Never their harmonies reach old charme
Bombs sending their greetings without alarms
