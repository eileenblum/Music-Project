[Schallenberg , Lubitzki]

See me pepole I am on the Hills of the thrills
Rockets, airplanes, spacecranes under my window sill
Jumping with my friends here on the top of surprises
Bring us fast the ying-yang drinks with stones and with ice!

Cheers angels, cheers sunlight, milky way, cheers marsguide!
Cheers thunder, cheers windways, mooncraters, cheers new day!

Signal me, people to the hills of my thrills!
Planets on my crown turn its way under my will
Don't think I'm a god, I am the king of all skies
Lesson to the recall song of all early life.

Suck ying and yang 'til the end!
Burst! Now you're fat, become an angelrat!

Cheers violence, cheers hatred, all bad things, we've taste it
Cheers raped kids, cheers weapons, cheers all things that happen!

See me people I am on the hills of the thrills
Rockets, airplanes, spacecranes under my window sill
Comfort in our seats, we never want to come down,
never want to put our feet back down on your ground

Suck ying and yang 'til the end
Burst! Now you're fat, become an angelrat!

Can you feel my fruit in your minds
I prepare your angelrat-life

Suck ying and yang 'til the end
Burst! Now you're fat, become an angelrat!

Can you feel my fruit in your mind
