[Klemp , Lubitzki]

Friends go away, plants go away, I go away every night
Duty is hate for rotten brains and hate is endless fight
I want observe children of mine, those from my sperm bank deal
Give the adresses Dr. Tail, don't say never to me!

The breath of these days let heart beats go faster

I waste no time with self compasion, I waste no fears for bad dreams
Video on, five minutes live within my best porno scene
Revelation 'bout our jealousy, I ignore your photos my dear
Your dying love came with my lies, so blank counts the answer machine

Trust in me today, tomorrow forget it!

Give us your laughter, punishment
We are the dazed ones, we hate happy ends

Give us your laughter, punishment!
We are the dazed ones without sense
Give us your laughter, punishment!
We are the dazed ones, we hate happy ends

Mortals we invite you to the woods in our land.
where the trees let slowly fall their leafs down in your hands.
Take these leafs for mouth, eyes, ears to cover you
mortal fears and tears
