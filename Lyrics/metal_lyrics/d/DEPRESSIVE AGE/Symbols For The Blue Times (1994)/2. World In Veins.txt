[Klemp , Lubitzki]

Hello world in veins, drive the ale stuff on its way
Now it's time again, kill the bad mood! Kill hate flames!
Hello world in veins send love to my spirit space!
Woman youu be gone and the movie starts to run.
Now I get lower every day and it's a kind moment to stay
in a whispering reich

Time burns my world

You're a cheap heart!
You're a traitor cunt!
Slut, youu suck your drugs as pastime, fuck!
And I'm minusman, falling down on my knees again,
scream to my mirror's shame, bluaaaah!!

Dark rings under bleary eyes, rasping voice, this is my child
Boy your health had not a choice and I listen to you:
"Hello damaged game, recognize your child again!
Hello dad, lets go to repair you in the toyland store!
Now I just need to find the train to the toyland of my space
and my whispering reich

Time burns my world

You're a cheap heart! You're a traitor cunt!
Slut, you suck your drugs as pastime, fuck!
And I'm minusman, falling down on my knees again,
scream to my mirror's shame, bluaaah!

Mother left us and of all the guilt goes a great part to my side
Child, you have to pay the bill
Is there somebody who'll give this tale an end?
I won't be sacrificed for trends

Hello world in veins, minusman's my name
