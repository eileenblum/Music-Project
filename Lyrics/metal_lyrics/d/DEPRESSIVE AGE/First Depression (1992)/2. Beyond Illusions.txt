We know some things are true and believe it is a lie
At first we smile and when it's too late we just cry
We know it's a lie and believe that it is true
Oh what a stupid thing to do

No God will save or condemn you, set a goal for your life
And find the way to reach it, so you can try to strive for
Intensity and brightness and depth in your life
To get the strength to live
To live beyond illusions

We swallow all the bad facts like bitter medicine
And live conveniently in world built on sand
Carrying on to excess, going to extremes
Real good ideas falling on deaf ears
No God will save you condemn you, set a goal for your life
And find the way to reach it, so you can try to strive for 
Intensity and brightness and depth in your life
To get the strength to life
To live beyond illusions

Short sightedness don't look against the present
Loss of all honesty ruin is declared to progress
Adaptation the law of the crowd
Manipulation sneaks into all brains
Indifference gains the upper hand
Ignorance is no excuse
