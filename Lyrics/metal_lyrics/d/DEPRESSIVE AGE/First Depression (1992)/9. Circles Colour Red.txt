When the circles start to dance
Before my eyes they dance again
I must hit them in the centre until the circles colour red
Blood streams under my eyelids, I wake up in red tears and sweat
I cried

Where chasms of ice fill my heart
Incurable inner war starts
I shudder with my insane pain
When madness takes the reign

Running through the masses
Running through the streets
Running through the centre
Out of sight, out of mind

Waiting for a break
Inside I have lost
My last bit of
Brightness, brightness

Feel the gun under my clothes
See a child run across the road
Jerking hands, a flash in my mind
Think I know this fatal sign

I'm fed up with false
Mercy, try to set
My captive heart free
See in me an evil plat
Searching for
What I am here for
See the world through timid eyes
Only lies, only lies

Feel the gun under my clothes
See a child run across the road
Jerking hands, a flash in my mind
Think I know this fatal sign

When the circles start to dance
Before my eyes they dance again
I must hit them in the centre until the circles colour red
Desire to kill loads the gun, 'til. they catch me I'm on the run

Feel the gun under my clothes
See a child run across the road
Jerking hands, a flash in my mind
Think I know this fatal sign
