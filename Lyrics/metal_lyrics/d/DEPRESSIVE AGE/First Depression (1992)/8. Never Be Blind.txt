I see love and I see hate
I see pleasure and I see disdain
I see hypocrisy and sincerity
I see famine and gluttony

And I will never be, never be blind
I see torture and I see cure
I see patients and freaks very cool
I see mockery and sympathy
I see greed and I see modesty

And I will never be, never be blind

I see yesterday and I see today
I see sunlight and I see dark night
I see meanness and generosity
I see misery and luxury

And I will never be, never be blind
