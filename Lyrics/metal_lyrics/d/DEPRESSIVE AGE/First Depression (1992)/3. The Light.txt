Hear the whispers through the trees
A giant scene senses this cold breeze
No moon, no star looks through blackened clouds
But a light waves in water now it's out

Come, come to me
You can trust me what is this I can't believe?
Behold the waves
Through the trees only a light which I have seen?

Men in the villages talking with fear
Mysterious tales about this rivershore here
More than ten fishermen misguided by a light
Claiming its victims before the sunrise

Come, come and see
What's within me are you the light which I have seen?
The secret thing
In my warm sphere this fatal voice wants to take my will

Extinguished fire's smoke has not yet disappeared
Fire's wiped out by wind and the drops of wet leaves
Now it is still, shyly falls the rain
And the light in the water is shining again

Don't trust your feet cause it makes you insane

Behold the waves
Through the trees are you the light which I can see?
The secret thing
In my warm sphere
this fatal voice takes my fear
Imagine new
Reality you shine so bright I feel the heat
I am your guide
Follow me hypnosis, I fall asleep
The secret thing
In my warm sphere this fatal voice takes my will
I am your guide
Now follow me it pulls me and I move my feet
