Hello my friend, listen to me
I've got a woman and you know her very well
You must help me, yes you will call
Put on a strange voice and tell her I'm dead

There's no risk my friend
Cause I'll come back soon to her

I will be gone two weeks and you must bring the news
To a secret place where we meet
Watch what is happening, visit her at home
Say that you're looking for me, be careful!
There's no risk my friend
Cause I'll come back soon to her

Nice to see you my dear
With innocence in my face
Knocking on her door
Forever closer than before

So it will be

And so the woman is in despair
Goes to the police, they cannot help
For her the only possibility: tablets
And be free suicide

There's no risk my friend
Cause I'll come back soon to her

Nice to see you my dear
Madness and pain races my fear
Standing at the coffin side
Can't look your parents in the eyes

Nice to see you my dear
I remember the day when I found you there
The suicide letter is a secret in time
Nobody knows a reason why
