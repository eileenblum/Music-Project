With intend to die I move onto the roof
I await this fall bringing peace after all
I will cross the border, set my life out of order
Dissatisfied from the superficial frame of mind
A magical attraction disperses fear of height
In sudden ecstasy gravity embraces me

Shadows cross my mind, my inner eyes are blind
Now I try to cry, laughing while I fly
Avalanches of incredible presentiments
Break walls where I left all reason behind
I am like a bird flying south in winter
But for me it is never to return

I will stop brooding, no remorse at all
Finally time for self deception is past
I enjoy this marvelous trip of my body
My spirit flies to an unknown destiny
In the air suspended I look at what's below
Deadly frightened eyes staring into mine

If there is an entry to a new dimension
Can I make any move or am I just a toy?
Was it intention or who threw the dice?
All I really getting to the bottom of life?
After day will be night, after dark shall be light
Who says that those axioms will ever be right?

Can you tell me where's the place of conception?
Can you tell me where's the place of death?
Who decides what, who, how we will be?
Is there anywhere an ultimate goodbye?

I lift my face, seize the expanse of the sky
Welcome to this journey, destination's free
For a moment it seems I could fly forever
But now I feel how the impact broke my spine
I am like a bird flying south in winter
But for me it is never to return

If there is an entry to a new dimension
Can I make any move of am I just a toy?
Was it intention or who threw the dice?
Am I really getting to the bottom of life?
After day will be night, after dark shall be light
Who says that those axioms will ever be right?

Can you tell me where's the place of conception?
Can you tell me where's the place of death?
Who decides what, who, how we will be?
Is there anywhere an ultimate goodbye?

Can you tell me how to get to heaven?
Can you tell me how to get to hell?
I wanna tell you but my voice grows silent
Maybe when you die you will know it too
