Through your torture now I realize
Blind is the rage that
Brings you in front of me
Disintegration of the mechanism
Pulverization of the system
I wanted the perfect creature
And you gave me the end
The end of the world I wanted to create
The final diagram of the perfection
â¦of the machine
The irreversible process has just began
Disconnecting the mechanical extensions
Up to the "central unit"
The system failure I cannot control
Dismembering the internal connections
Which gave me the power and knowledge
No I can't see
I cannot visualize the pathetic future
That you are defending
Through your torture now I realize
Blind is the rage that
Brings you in front of me
Disintegration of the mechanism
Pulverization of the system
The program has failed
The program is dead
