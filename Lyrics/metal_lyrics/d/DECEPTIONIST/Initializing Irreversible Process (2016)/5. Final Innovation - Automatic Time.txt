Run! Fueled by hate can start the day
A man is ready for the task
'Cause the algorithmic world needs your blood
Get ready to produce the final solution
The serial objects of the mass consumption
Who am I to disagree?
Deep innovation and tech organization
Go together. I'm the only one (not the only one)
Who am I? In the fight against time
Your task is to set the piece
That's the right way
The conveyer brings the "thing"
The conveyer belt brings the "thing"
There is no time to think, no time to think,
Don't need to know, there is no need to ask
In the endless flow of minutes
(In the endless flow of minutes)
Deep innovation and tech organization
Go together. I'm the only one (not the only one)
Who am I? In the fight against time
Your task is to set the piece
That's the right way
The conveyer brings the "thing"
Fix, screw, repeat
The perception of the real is irrefutably broken
Fix, screw, repeat
The automation of production can't be stopped
Who am I to disagree?
Another serial number is born to be built
Son of a systematic diagram of consumption
Time doesn't flow, there's no rest for me
Run! Fueled by hate can start the day
A man is ready for the task
And drag the invisible chains
And empty the soul. Another servant is ready
'Cause the algorithmic world needs your blood
Needs your blood!
