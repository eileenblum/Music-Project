Feel the air flowing away
In its place a massive expansion of gas
The world is in chaos
After the defeat of the master machine
Who are the creatures I hear about?
Automata escaped from their master's control
Slowly I move, slowly I breath
Turmoil runs through my veins
Evil intent or friendly cooperation
What awaits me behind the next door?
It stands in front of me
Magnificent creature
Perfection of technology
Son of biomechanical creation is aiming to me
Scanning process, biological subject detected
Reading expressions, facial recognition
Encoding of the senses
The outcome is just another threat
"The red eye" is pointing to its target
â¦And the contact begins
I am the operator number 3
With my own consciousness
Knowledge goes through my circuits
And all I can see is this lesser creature
I am the operator number 3
Equipped with unbreakable extensions
I am the God of myself
Programmed to destroy the threat
And the threat is you!
