Far from progress and the human race
Absurd of opposites is in front of my eyes
Inside a heart of flesh and muscles
The essence of death is in my hands
Pouring down as ancestral tribute
All that is incomprehensible
Is behind those doors
Machines rebels slowly trudging in the dust
Assonance interfaces force me to walk away
The sweet oblivion of the infinite vastness
By the cosmic repulsion
To get close to the beating heart
The quest for identity is finished
Muscle cybernetic beings playing with my soul
I don't want to be alone, I will not go away
Everything I was looking for is in that idea
The essence of death in my hands
The quest for identity is finished
The absurd is in front of my eyes
Intervention for many held to be divine
The quest for identity
