The final sacrifice has pulled me here
Who are you to judge and blame?
Locked in this cage you want me to confess
I am the master and you are the slave
Your crime of blood in this world
Has left behind only death and despair
The humans can no longer tolerate
This once again. Now confess
You're just a machine
You're just a servant of civilization
The heart is weak, the arms too
Replaced by appropriate extensions
Can you feel that?
Can you smell that?
It's not death but a new reborn
Flesh and bone turn into steel
Orphan by blood that turns into energy
Your God cannot disappear
Reprogramming the subject
With a new P.U.M.A. code.
There is no soul, there is no pain
Arithmetical perfection of the invincible man
I am the master of machines
I am the keeper of the human death
You will die for a new deception
