Through the eyes of darkness
Where every single glow is tarnished
Sunlight intoxicate my cosmos
Stars, satellites infinitely macroscopic
It's all in the darkness of pain
When infinite silence
My eyes have seen the glory more absolute
Nothing will seem to have a sense
My flight, empty, immoral, destructive
All will have an end
Light passes through my heart
Through the veil of my deadly deeds
Memories of childhood and my people
Deep hatred of each breath
Fly as a sign of decadence and sadness
Everything that I was. Hypocrisy and falsehood
As the wax of a candle. Slow heats the twilight
Which is fired before my eyes
Now everything is clear to me
Through the eyes of darkness
Where every single glow is tarnished
Sunlight intoxicates my cosmos
Stars, satellites infinitely macroscopic
It's all in the darkness of pain
When the infinite silence
My eyes have seen the glory more absolute
Memories of childhood and my people
Deep hatred of each breath
Fly as a sign of decadence and sadness
Everything that I was. Hypocrisy and falsehood
Oblivion dwells deeper into my roots
Extinction of all feelings
Only the end makes me free
Oblivion dwells deeper into my roots
â¦free to be deadly
