This mortal journey to the sunshine
Like a drone, escaping from the human scum
Corruption, aberration of the human being
That's my mind or just reality
Start the mortal race to survive
Misery left behind, obliterate
Misery left behind, obliterate
To liberate myself
This mortal journey to the sunlight
Feeling the finish line near
Any questions will be answered
Meaning of life
The unstoppable instinct to throw
Into the sun and its surface embrace all
The meaning of life!
Takes myself into uncontrollable
Rise to the essence of the existence
I cannot resist
In the oblivion fall I feel a strange
Wrap myself
No pain, space and time are fused now
This is the source of everything
The divine source of creation
It's where everything began
And where everything will end
Again I become stardust!
This mortal journey to the sunshine
Like a drone, escaping from the human scum
Corruption, aberration of the human being
That's my mind or just reality
The meaning of life
Misery left behind, obliterate
Misery left behind, obliterate
This mortal journey to the sunlight!
