Deep down the earth the river filled with fire consumes the dead with obolus shining in their empty eyes, leaving no trace of what they once used to be... For they were abandoned by those who believed to be gods...

âThrough me the way is to the city dolent;
Through me the way is to eternal dole;
Through me the way among the people lost.
Justice incited my sublime Creator;
Created me divine Omnipotence,
The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.
Before me there were no created things,
Only eterne, and I eternal last.
(All hope abandon, ye who enter in!)â *

All memories of those abandoned by the gods fade away
Transforming them into superior lives for they cannot stay
Fear no gods! As thou are god yourself, rise thy swords!
Quench their thirst! As thou are god yourself... fear no gods!

â(...) Commingled are they with that caitiff choir
Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,
Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.
The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair (...) *

Fear no gods! As thou are god yourself, rise thy swords!
Quench their thirst! As thou are god yourself... fear no gods!

âThese have no longer any hope of death;
And this blind life of theirs is so debased,
They envious are of every other fate.
No fame of them the world permits to beâ *

âAll those who perish in the wrath of God
Here meet together out of every land;
And ready are they to pass o'er the river,
Because celestial Justice spurs them on,
So that their fear is turned into desire.
This way there never passes a good soul;
And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,
Well mayst thou know now what his speech importsâ *

âOnly eterne, and I eternal last.
All hope abandon, ye who enter in!â *

Deep down the earth the river filled with fire consumes the dead...
But you had seen the trace of what they used to be

Fear no gods! As thou are god yourself, rise thy swords!
Quench their thirst! As thou are god yourself... fear no gods!

[* âInfernoâ by Dante Alighieri]
