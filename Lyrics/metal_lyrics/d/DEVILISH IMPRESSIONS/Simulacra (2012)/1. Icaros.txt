An incarnation of eternal mankind dream
Is that what made you worthy to bear your name, oh Icaros?
A memorable act of courage or just a deadly sin?

You dreamt a dream of having wings so you could fly above all men
So you could reach the sun and the moon, never look back, not down at the earth...

A vast, familiar feeling that often passes by 
And pumps your veins with bitter... Is this a prize? Oh, Icaros?!
A memorable act of courage or just a deadly sin?

Oh, Icaros!

Of all ancient ones you are the one that had become an icon for us all
Rise your voice now up to the throne of those who lived and died at pantheon!

Icaros! You challenged your gods, despite their power, despite their curse.
Oh, Icaros!!! 
A memorable act of courage, not just a deadly sin...

You dreamt a dream of having wings so you could fly above all men
So you could reach the sun and the moon, never look back, not down at the earth...
