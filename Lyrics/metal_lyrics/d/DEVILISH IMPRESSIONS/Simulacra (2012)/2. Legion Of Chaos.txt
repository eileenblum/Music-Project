âHow you would please me, Night! without your stars 
Which speak a foreign dialect, that jars 
On one who seeks the void, the black, the bare. 
Yet even your darkest shade a canvas forms 
Whereon my eye must multiply in swarms 
Familiar looks of shapes no longer thereâ *

Vision of disorder...
Meritorious, perpetual annihilation
Fountains of blood running down with rain
Washing away the stench of mankindâs putrefaction

Hail! We are the Legion Of Chaos
Hail! Bow to the Legion Of Doom
Chaos... sperm and ova of all species
Chaos... bringer of darkness and daylight

âYou forests, like cathedrals, are my dread 
You roar like organs. Our curst hearts, like cells 
Where death forever rattles on the bed, 
Echo your de Profundis as it swells.
My spirit hates you, Ocean! sees, and loathes 
Its tumults in your own. Of men defeated 
The bitter laugh, that's full of sobs and oaths, 
Is in your own tremendously repeatedâ *

Fountains of blood running down with rain
Washing away the stench of mankindâs putrefaction

Hail! We are the Legion Of Chaos
Hail! Bow to the Legion Of Doom
Chaos... sperm and ova of all species
Chaos... bringer of darkness and daylight

Chaotic vision of the cosmos...

[* âObsessionâ by Charles Baudelaire]
