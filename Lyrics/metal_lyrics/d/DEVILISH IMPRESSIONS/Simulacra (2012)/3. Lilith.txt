âIs the light vanished from our golden sun,
Or is this daedal-fashioned earth less fair,
That we are nature's heritors, and one
With every pulse of life that beats the air?
Rather new suns across the sky shall pass,
New splendour come unto the flower, new glory to the grass.â *
Why have you crossed the path of my life? And now youâre not here... 
With poisonous kiss youâve taken it all... away from me...

âAnd we two lovers shall not sit afar,
Critics of nature, but the joyous sea
Shall be our raiment, and the bearded star
Shoot arrows at our pleasure! 
We shall be part of the mighty universal whole,
And through all aeons mix and mingle with the Kosmic Soul!â *

I dream of Lilith, sheâd become my obsession... 
Tremendous feeling of great, irreversible love and loss... 

âWe shall be notes in that great Symphony
Whose cadence circles through the rhythmic spheres,
And all the live World's throbbing heart shall be
One with our heart; the stealthy creeping years
Have lost their terrors now, we shall not die,
The Universe itself shall be our Immortalityâ *

[* âPantheaâ by Oscar Wilde]
