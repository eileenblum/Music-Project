âThere is a Reaper, whose name is Death,
And, with his sickle keen,
He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,
And the flowers that grow betweenâ *

Wipe off the tears that run down your face
Frozen in time of your most painful dream
And transform them all into an ocean so the dream may sail away 

âHe gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes,
He kissed their drooping leaves;
It was for the Lord of Paradise
He bound them in his sheavesâ * 

âThey shall all bloom in fields of light,
Transplanted by my care,
And saints, upon their garments white,
These sacred blossoms wearâ *

And once they have sailed away from you
Never look back so they shall not return!
Unless youâd want them to become 
a pain that gives birth to another worthless tear

âO, not in cruelty, not in wrath,
The Reaper came that day;
'T was an angel visited the green earth,
And took the flowers awayâ *

Itâs the last farewellâ¦
