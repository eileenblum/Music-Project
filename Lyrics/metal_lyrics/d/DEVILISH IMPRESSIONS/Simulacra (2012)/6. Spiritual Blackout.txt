Nocturnal passage to worlds beyond the frame of so called reality...
A dream that takes you for a journey across the most twisted scenes as far as your imagination is concerned...
Neurons lost in the labyrinth with no exit, an astral body unable to come back...

âA spirit passed before me: I beheld
The face of immortality unveiled - 
Deep sleep came down on every eye save mine - 
And there it stood, - all formless - but divine:
Along my bones the creeping flesh did quake;
And as my damp hair stiffened, thus it spake:
Is man more just than God? Is man more pure
Than He who deems even Seraphs insecure?
Creatures of clay - vain dwellers in the dust!
The moth survives you, and are ye more just?
Things of a day! you wither ere the night,
Heedless and blind to Wisdom's wasted light!â *

Pray! Devour words and gestures 
Pray! For all your hope is gone
Pray! To stimulate your spirit
Slay! Before theyâll take it all...

An astral body unable to come back
Nocturnal passage to worlds beyond the frame...
Passage - dream to be awake...

[* âA Spirit Passed Before Meâ by Lord George Gordon Byron]
