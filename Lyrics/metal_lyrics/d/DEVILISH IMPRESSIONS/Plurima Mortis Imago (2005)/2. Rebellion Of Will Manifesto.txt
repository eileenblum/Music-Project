We â thinking beings
We â surrealistic visions
We â supernatural ideas
We have been materialized
To possess the forces of God

God who created the world
Full of lament of his daughters and sons
We have come up with blood on our hands
Blood used as ink for writing The New Bible

You have heard about Armageddon
Decadentism flowing from horns of dead heralds
Being afraid someone could discover it one dayâ¦

Come on, do not pretendâ¦
You are one of us, even if you would like
To become someone else
Damned and forgotten, hateful and ruined
Intended for serving the will of yourself

There is no king but you
There is no God but you
Damned and forgotten, hateful and ruined
Intended for serving the will of yourself

Legions were marching through the lands
Bathed in blood
Everything has passedâ¦ people and cities
Cultures and nations
Finally â there was only You and a few more leftâ¦
The thinking beings
Surrealistic visions
Supernatural ideas
Who have been materialized
To possess the forces of God
Damned and forgotten, hateful and ruined
But intended for serving the will of Yourselves

You have looked in the mirror and seen revelation
Heaven suddenly turned redâ¦
