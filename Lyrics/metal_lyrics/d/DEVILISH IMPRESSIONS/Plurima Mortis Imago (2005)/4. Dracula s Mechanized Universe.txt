We all live in entirely mechanized universe...
Being a cog-wheel we just remain a premature dead dream of existence
Deprived of all passions
Deprived of all visions
We are becoming creatures unable to think, unable to feel and experience

Intoxicated with devilish wrath
we are having a dream of drinking a blood
Blood flowing down from the swords of religions,
of mankind addicted to all superstitions

And You
face the world of imagination
And You
face the world of mass devastation
And You
do not be afraid of transformation
And You
throw off the mask of plastic intentions

Passing by streets drowned in a twilight
seeing the whores of laughter and sadness
Walking around and drinking the moonlight
looking for victims to fulfill your madness

Their cry is a sweet melody,
pure, shameless form of Your satisfaction
For ages of lies, false smiles and enslavement
close up Your thoughts in eternal lament

Liberation
Demoralization
Transformation
(?6?6?6?)
Mistification

Unfortunately, the chalice is empty
Would You please be so kind and gently prepare Your throats?
