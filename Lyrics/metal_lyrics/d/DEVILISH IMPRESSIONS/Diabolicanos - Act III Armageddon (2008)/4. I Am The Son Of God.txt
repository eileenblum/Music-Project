I am the one who hanged on the fucking cross
Putrefaction's opening its gates for me
Meant to be dead I still breathe and cry
Everlasting pain has become a part of human's lullaby

I want to die and save all of the sinners whom I love the most
For this was the will of my father
Generations drowned in self-delusion
Will I get your sacrifice?
I am the dream of over-trustful humanity

I am the son of God
Legions marching through the lands
Ages of empty words and nothingness taught by the sword
Merciless source of truth and love
Bow to me as I am the son of God!

"Et inferus et mors missi sunt in stagnum
ignis haec mors secunda est stagnum ignis
Et qui non est inventus in libro vitae
scriptus missus est in stagnum ignis"

Bow to me as I am the son of God!
Bow to me as I am the son of God!
Bow to me as I am the son of God!
Bow to me as I am the son of God!
