"Et in fronte eius nomen scriptum mysterium
Babylon magna mater fornicatum
et abominationum terrae"

With tears in eyes they dream
Her lips bather in blood of tyranny

Fear - the only thing they
Fear - know and respect and that
Fear - had always been their
Fear - supreme sanctity

"Et vidi mulierem ebriam de sanguine sanctorum
et de sanguine martyrum Iesu et miratus sum
cum vidissem illam admiratione magna"

With tears in eyes they dream
Her lips bather in blood of tyranny

[Lead: Szymon Czech]

Hell and heaven - that's where the dreams of man were born
Thoughts intoxicated with false grief and pious jealousy
Immortal forces that feed on their own vanity
Why do we pray to GODS that don't EXIST??

Hail the King that is inside of You, hail that King
Hail the Queen that is inside of You
She who looks at you from the mirror every single day

Hell and heaven - that's where the dreams of man were born
Thoughts intoxicated with false grief and pious jealousy

[Lead: Armers]

Immortal forces that feed on their own vanity
Why do we pray to GODS that don't EXIST??

"Quantum glorificavit se et in delicis fuit tantum date
illi tormentum et luctum quia in corde suo dicit sedeo
regina et vidua non sum et luctum non videbo"

With tears in eyes they dream
That from now on God is Satan
