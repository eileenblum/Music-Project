Naked and cursed
They draw new maps of world
Created by those who stood
for human race's annihilation

"Et vidi de mare bestiam ascendentem
habentem capita septem et cornua decem
et super cornua eius decem diademata
et super capita eius nomina blasphemiae"

They bring the light
Of liberation from illiteracy
They burn the weak and sow the seeds
of will's followers

For they are Prometheus' sons
who didn't fear the wrath of Gods
Never kneeled down in front
of any pseudo prophets
and their egoistic dreams
For the are Prometheus' sons
who didn't fear the wrath of Gods
Never kneeled down in front
of any pseudo prophets
and their egoistic dreams

"Et unum de capitibus suis quasi occisum
in mortem et plaga mortis eius curata est
et admirata est unversa terra post bestiam"

Naked and cursed
They draw new maps of world
Created by those who stood
for human race's annihilation

Scattered across the sky they dream
Pretending they're the stars
Distressing whispers at lonely, dreadful night
Hear their calling and step towards the light

Bathed in blood of believers
They pick The Darkness' flowers
hidden in the eye of night
Tales of the great deceiver
Turned into hand of ash and dust

For they are Prometheus' sons
who didn't fear the wrath of Gods
Never kneeled down in front
of any pseudo prophets
and their egoistic dreams
For the are Prometheus' sons
who didn't fear the wrath of Gods
Never kneeled down in front
of any pseudo prophets
and their egoistic dreams

"Et adoraverunt draconem quia dedit
potestatem bestiae et adoraverunt bestiae
dicentes quis similis bestiae
et quiz poterit pugnare cum ea"

Naked and cursed
They draw new maps of world
Created by those who stood
for human race's annihilation
