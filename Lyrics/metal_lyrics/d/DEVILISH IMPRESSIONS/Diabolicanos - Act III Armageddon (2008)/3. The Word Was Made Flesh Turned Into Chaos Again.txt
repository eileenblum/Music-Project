Whispers of pendulum filling the cage of your mind
Painting its walls with pure hatred
Freezing the flames of chaos once turned into word
Cosmic feeling once turned into dust
Together we stand and challenge the crowds of god

Annihilation of lies hidden beyond the core
Thoughts of free will spinning around
And waiting for souls where life doesn't mean anything -
Dream of a Kingdom where Chaos and Word used to be Unity
Congregation of those who revengefully look into eyes of deceiver
And burn out his world of forbidden truth

Whispers of pendulum filling the cage of your mind
Painting its walls with pure hatred
Freezing the flames of word once turned into chaos

And you - nail him down to the cross
Feel sweet taste of power and omnipotence
And they nail you down to the cross
Feel sweet taste of retribution
and greed for the power of someone who claims to be God

"Et cum consummati fuerint mille anni solvetur Satanas
de carcere suo et exibit et seducet gentes quae sunt
super quattuor angulos terrae Gog et Magog et congregabit eos
in proelium quorum numerus est sicut harena maris"
