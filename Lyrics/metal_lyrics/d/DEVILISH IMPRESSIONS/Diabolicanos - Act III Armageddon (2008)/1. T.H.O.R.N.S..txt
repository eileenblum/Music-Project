We are thorns which killed the fucking god...

We are stars made of broken mirrors
Like fragments of dreams scattered across the sky
Mirrors with transparent bottom
We are the eyes reflecting the essence of unholy "I"
I am the tongue of apocalyptic dusk
I am the poison and the relief

Arise! Sceptre of War!
Fill your soul with power of forbidden rapture
Those who have tasted the fruits of sin
Shall remain the shadows of an oath
For I am them
For I am them and they are me
For I am them
Those who have witnessed God's transformation

Listen to their voices
Echoes...
Shadows...
Whispering the will of liberation
Laments of fucking mob around the cross
We are the stars made of broken mirrors
We are your pain

Arise! Sceptre of War!
Fill your soul with power of forbidden rapture
Those who have tasted the fruits of sin
Shall remain the shadows of an oath
For I am them
For I am them and they are me
For I am them
We bring the agony as we are the thorns and nails which killed the god!

I am the first one and the last one
I am Alpha and Omega - The Beginning and The End
Fire, water, air and the earth - The Perfect Element

"Ego Alpha et Omega
Primus et noissimus
Principium et finis"

We are thorns which killed the fucking god...
