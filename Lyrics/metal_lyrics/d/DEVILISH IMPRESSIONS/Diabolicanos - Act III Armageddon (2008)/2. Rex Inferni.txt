"Infernus subter conturbatus est in occursum adventus tui
suscitavit tibi gigantas omnes principes terrae surrexerunt
de solilis suis omnes principes nationum"

Spit on a grave of the whore
And lick the heaven's wounds
Immortal passion's flowing in your marble veins
Let them breathe the silence and its putrid smell...

Open the coffin
And allow the light to get inside
Rainbow of sadness
Painting the black walls of your mind

Metamorphosis of Kings turned into worms
Rising from seas of oblivion
They've drowned once now they're coming back
Your lack of faith shall never be forget

Anthems of angels written with the human's blood
Gratification for all sins
Thousands of bodies, pile of worthless dust
Lands flooded in mournful tears

Spit on a grave of the whore
And lick the heaven's wounds
Immortal passion's flowing in your marble veins
Let them breathe the silence and its fucking putrid smell...

"Qui dicebas in corde tuo in caelum conscendam
super astra Dei exaltabo solium meum sedebo
in monte testamenti in lateribus aquilonis"

Metamorphosis of Kings turned into worms
Rising from seas of oblivion
They've drowned once now they're coming back
Your lack of faith shall never be forget

"Ascendam super altitudinem ero similis Altissimo"
