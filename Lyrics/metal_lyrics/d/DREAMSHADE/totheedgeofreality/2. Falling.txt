Now it's too late, it's time to go
You left something you never had
When you're walking towards your arm
Searching for the guidelines among the stars

There's no one who can aid you
(It's just a dreamless sleep for me too)
See the death in front of your face
The worst meeting you will have

When you see the reality come back
It's just your sickness, a new form of attack.
It hurts your brain, it's cold like winter's rain
You feel breeze in your veins,you will rest in your chains.
A state you've never been to
Into these world of decadence, I will die and falling down...

I'll carry you where the light's gone
Where the things you created are destroyed
and the words you told me are forgotten
On the path of insanity, you're alone

There's no one who can aid you
It's just a dreamless sleep for me too
See the death in front of your face
The worst meeting you will have

Have you ever been inside the deepest state of convalescence?
Have you ever been a victim of  your own imagination?

I'll carry you where the light' s gone
Where the things you created are destroyed
and the words you told me are forgotten
On the path of insanity, you're alone

Exploding inside, burning brains through the flame of the worst fired disease.
Any justice for you, you're the victim of your sufferings.

Falling down, into the world that binds us
trying to find, a better way to save yourself
going down, you live the shattering of your life
don't forget, you're alone on the edge of reality

From the distant chaos of your mind that decline, of this shock,
This sensation of block that you rock, all this blood
Covers your eyes and penetrates your soul, makes you blind
Disability of living inside, any exceptions for anyone,the eternal downfall of mind!
Downfall of mind.
