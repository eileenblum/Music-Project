Totally wet, I'm followed by someone
The sky cries water, the blade is sharp
The blood is poured on the ground by the weapon
Everything blind, I can't see my opponent

The bodies lacking of life, are suffering images
I can't hear any sound, because my senses now are obscured!

I'm confused, I don't know where I am
This strange landscape, these damned visions

You live the dream! You feel the dream!
You can't escape, you are just trapped!

I can't believe it, I can't explain this,
Is it just an illusion?
My senses are blinded, my body's blocked
What the fuck is happening?
What the fuck is happening?

Totally wet, I'm followed by someone
The sky cries water, the blade is sharp
The blood is poured on the ground by the weapon
Everything blind , I can't see my opponent

The bodies lacking of life, are suffering images
I can't hear any sound, because my senses now are obscured!

You live the dream, you feel the dream
You can't escape, you are just trapped.
You live the dream, you feel the dream
You can't escape, you are just trapped.

I can't believe it, I can't explain this,
What the fuck is happening?

You live the dream, you feel the dream
You can't escape, you are just trapped.
