First you feel burn, then you feel pain, now you feel nothing.
Why am I suffering for you?
Destruction, illusion, I'm in a prison of fusion
And the blood drains from my hands!

Why?
The venom's in my veins, how can I get away all of my pain?
This is the venom of life!

In the silence, it brings you down in the darkness!
You can't think now that you're dead
It destroys you, it removes your memory
And there is nothing left to do!

Go!

Voices, visions, noises from outside.
I can feel the passage of  Death.
Now it's begun my last fight.
I hear crying, am I already dead?
Looking inside your eyes.
And I can't explain.

I hold your hand and I guide you on this path
I know where we're going, you haven't an idea.
In this cold embrace of icy winds, we are searching
for salvation, together!

You killed me with your sick words
You killed my soul and killed my own
I injected you my venom of life
Will you remember me now?
Will you remember me now?

How?
The venom's in my veins, how can I get away all of my pain?
This is the venom of life!

In the silence it brings you down in the darkness!
You can't think now that you're dead
It destroys you, it removes your memory
And there is nothing left to do!

Fuck!

Voices, visions, noises from outside.
I can feel the passage of Death.
Now it's begun my last fight.
I hear crying, am I already dead?
Looking inside your eyes.
And I can't explain.

I hold your hand and I guide you on this path
I know where we're going, you haven't an idea.
In this cold embrace of icy winds, we are searching
for salvation, together!

You killed me with your sick words
You killed my soul and killed my own
I injected you my venom of life
Will you remember me now?
Will you remember me now?
