Wasted hope,
all my wishes are falling down again,
with the consciousness of a reality that deceives me
Secret worlds hidden by ignorance that steals us from inside

From the loneliness of our souls
weâll start to be the same thing,
weâll start to be what we always wanted,
and our wishes come true

Itâs the time,
itâs the moment,
we can make all things better,
we can save ourselves,
we can look for a better way,
this is not the end

Weâre cruelty victims;
predestined not to be together,
sentenced to live this life in sorrow

Listen to this silence,
look me in the eyes
and youâll find my declaration,
confided without lies

I remember âonce upon a timeâ,
when our bodies were designing abstract shapes,
drawing lines deep down in our minds
I remember those times as the best ones of my whole life

Listen to this silence,
look me in the eyes
and youâll find my declaration,
confided without lies

Use your imagination,
follow your heart,
then come to me and speak the words youâve held apart

Time for me is ending,
please donât turn around but start runningÂ away,
donât wait for me
