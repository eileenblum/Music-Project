In front of me, your sedated body,
on your awakening you won't believe your eyes

The trap is ready, the blood will be spread
You are chained to that machine, but is it the same for your life?

The clock has started, its course is irreversible

Now follow the rules;
live or die: make your choice

The time is ending, be prepared to sacrifice yourself
Use your ability, find the road,
I will award your loyalty

The door is closing, be quick,
don't waste your time screaming to no one,
this isn't the way

Please revive in me my flames of hope
I've understood my mistakes,
I won't repeat them again

Revive in me

And I finally won the game,
I earned my freedom,
now all is clear:
there is a reason for this brutality

Now the light of the sun is so brilliant,
life shines with beauty
