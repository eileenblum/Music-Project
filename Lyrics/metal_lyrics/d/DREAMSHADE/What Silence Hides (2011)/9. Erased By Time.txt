I left my world, my friends, my way
a long time ago
My destiny, my future are in doubt,
now I donât know where to go
My past is full of actions
that stain my dignity, full of crime
I would not go back in my steps
âcause my soul was erased by time

I canât recognize my face:
the man I was is not the man I see now
I made so many sacrifices,
so many times you asked me to try again
but time erased every desire we had,
the sand has covered our wasted lives

Destroyed like a page,
torn from the essence of a non-existing book,
born from the ashes of desire,
devoured by temptation,
marginalized by humanity:
eternal damnation as the worst punishment

Remembering all the sorrow I caused,
wounded by indifference, cynicism,
coldness of the people I had around
and now I canât feel anything

Iâm losing myself in self-pity,
the only sound that I can hear is my breathing
Oh apathy steps forward my heart, thereâs no way out.
Iâm losing myself in self-pity,
the only sound that I can hear is my breathing.
Oh agony steps forward my heart, thereâs no way out

I left my world, my friends, my way
a long time ago
My destiny, my future are in doubt,
now I donât know where to go
My past is full of actions
that stain my dignity, full of crime
I would not go back in my steps
âcause my soul was erased by time

Destroyed like a page,
torn from the essence of a non-existing book,
born from the ashes of desire,
devoured by temptation, marginalized by humanity:
eternal damnation as the worst punishment

Iâve forgottenÂ theÂ times I spent enjoying the best moments of my life
Chained in a world that doesnât want me anymore
