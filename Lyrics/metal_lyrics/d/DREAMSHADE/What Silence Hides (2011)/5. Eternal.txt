Here, me and you, onÂ the roof of this world
Where all the pain seems so far and noise sounds like distant echoes

Watching the world change its course
Like fellas in the carnage of a retreat
We are here, hand in hand, with sparkling eyes and hearts full of hope
We are here, in the reign of serenity

We grew up in the sandiest storms, redefining our dreams
we rest here on the roof of the earth enjoying this eternal moment

As long as we'll be together, we'll be unbreakable, invincible, immortal
Together we'll never surrender: united as one

Watching the world change its course
Like fellas in the carnage of a retreat

And we are here
We grew up in the sandiest storms redefining our dreams
We rest here on the roof of the earth enjoying this eternal moment

I've changed my life for you, I've lost my hope,
I've broken hearts so hard, I'll never let you go
Eyes are crying, voices are screaming but IÂ amÂ still here with you
