As a thunder that strikes the ground,
your demise has ripped my open wounds
My loud cries tear the air
'cause you left an empty chair

In the mirror my tearful face,
my vanished soul,
the lack of your embrace

I try to survive but agony is killing me inside
Where did you go?
Why don't you answer me?
You fucking left me alone
The wind will blow your ashes far away

I'll be waiting for you, waiting for death,
waiting to reach you againÂ my friend,
we swore eternal promises,
that couldn't be forgotten

My loud cries tear the air
'cause you left an empty chair

Lying in that coffin, your body, frozen
Pale as winter, fleeting as autumn, far from spring

I'll be waiting for you, waiting for death,
waiting to reach you againÂ my friend,
we swore eternal promises,
that couldn't be forgotten

Makes no sense to live my life without you
No, I still canât believe it
Now all I see are just my open wounds
