You walked a long way, never looked back,
so you can build a new life and start again

So far from home, so far from safety
What will you do when the world will turn its back on you?
When friendship and respect will be just an empty memory
Where will you go?
There's no place for you in this world

Burning, burning walls where you're caged in,
a sensation beyond recall

Open your eyes, come to reality
The time is now, you've nothing to lose,
throw the past away, and regain life; the life that once you've lost

Solitude your only friend in this journey
always waiting for a sign, always waiting to find the door,
search in your soul, search with perseverance

Life shows no mercy, life has no pity,
life is a dirty bastard, it rapes you and throws all your dignity away

What will you do when the world will turn its back on you?
When friendship and respect will be just an empty memory
There's no place for you in this world.

So far from you, so many miles away

Life shows no mercy, life has no pity,
you have to be strong; a heart of stone

Burning, burning walls where you're caged in,
burning, burning your brain

Don't pray to your god and believe in nothing,
be sure of yourself and you'll climb all the peaks,
oh it's just you, it's just your will power,
it depends on your consciousness,
don't waste your life
âcause this is your time to rise
This is your last chance
This is the final chance

Burning, burning buildings around you,
burning your beliefs
