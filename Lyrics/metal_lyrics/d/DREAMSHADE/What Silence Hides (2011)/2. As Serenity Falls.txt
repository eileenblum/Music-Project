Smash,
the pain arrives and destroys your mind
and then you look inside yourself finding only heartache,Â 
finding only the hidden truth

Thereâs only one place
where you can find the answers to your dreams

I gave you the keys,
I gave you the thrust to act as you wished,
and here we have the result: our love will burn forever

We lived through many difficulties,
once beyond the lies

I saw you were crying;
it was your consciousness that made you understand
that our destinies are chained

I will be nothing for you
if youâll be nothing for me
But as serenity falls
I will still have hope

And the worldÂ so celestial,
like heaven, like you
The wind brings me your essence,
your spirit, youâre mine

You know what I feel,
you know Iâve got you in my flesh,
an indelible fucking stain which cannot be erased

So our legend will always survive, through centuries and time:
we have guarded our secret, day by day, enjoying every instant;
we have built our story, we have moved on together breaking every chain

Together weâll never give up,
weâll never abandon, weâll never give up
Destroying the walls, destroying our enemies
and finally opening the doors to freedom

I gave you the keys,
I gave you the thrust to act as you wished,
and here we have the result: our love will burn forever
