The generation of degrade and ignorance:
so many men destroying each other,
fighting for their lands
under the control of schizophrenic divinities
Originally brothers and then sworn enemies

They are supposed to die, only to win the war of their leaders
they are supposed to die
Ignorance dominated this world for all this time

It's not too late so god forgive us all

No future for the weak
No future for the masses
Man's fury will destroy all hope

It's not too late so god forgive us all

We aimed too high, we dared too much,
our arrogance let us touch the sky,
we felt invincible;
we felt likeÂ gods but we were just tyrants to ourselves,
so we deserve the bitter end

Men burnt down their own world without a reason
and now still don't understand their past mistakes

Take your time, look the sky:
clouds are expiring in a slowed apocalypse
The world is changing:
I can see a spark in humanity's heart

Through massacres we spread oceans of blood
Through these tears, in these years shines a new era

We must eclipse this DeGeneration
We must eclipse
