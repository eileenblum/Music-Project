That time you woke up in the night, you felt cold and you started to tremble
Reborn in me oh merciful life
You deserve a better way
Don't let the universe stomp on you

Fuck!

No chance to run away from this guillotine
"Remember you'll always be unique"
Wasted words whispered in a rainy night,Â 
when haze caressed your face, and your voice moved me to tears

Fight!
Fight for freedom
Fight for your life
Fight with the soul
Defend yourself

I am forsaken, I am impureÂ 
Purify my sins, give me a sense of existence,
give me a future, show me the way to follow

That time you woke up in the night, you felt cold and you started to tremble
Reborn in me oh merciful life

Fight!
Fight for freedom
Fight for your life
Fight with the soul
Defend yourself

I am forsaken, I am impureÂ 
Purify my sins, give me a sense of existence,
give me a future, show me the way to follow

When you think things are going badly be prepared for the worst,
so be prepared to live the worst time of your life
without the anguish of death
