[Kevin:]
Why has it all changed?
What have we lost? What have we gained?
Nothing of this will ever remain
Only a bunch of childâs memories
Why has it all changed?
What have I lost? and what have you gained?
Nothing of this will ever remain
Only a bunch of childâs memories
Hidden in shame

We used to stay together
Dreaming of what weâd have become
Weâd have been friends forever
What should I say now that youâre gone?

Through my eyes youâre fading
This is the way I feel

Why has it all changed?
What have we lost? What have we gained?
Nothing of this will ever remain
Only a bunch of childâs memories
Why has it all changed?
What have I lost? and what have you gained?
Nothing of this will ever remain
Only a bunch of childâs memories

I miss those times when we played as kids
No worries about our future, no enemies
Now I close my eyes

[Fella:]
Trying to go back then with my mind
Oh, how I wish we could live the old times again

[Kevin:]
Through my eyes you're fading
This is the way I feel

We canât stand here waiting
Why are we afraid if thereâs nothing but time between us
We canât stand here waiting
Nothing is changing
Will we ever meet again?

[Fella:]Â 
Will we ever meet again?
What are we waiting for?
What are we so afraid of?
