Let's leave sympathy apart for once
just save me from it all
Â 
I hear your whispers
such a pleasant sound
While all my wishes
are spreading around
Please give me another chance
Take me back
I won't ruin it all again
Â 
Let's leave sympathy apart for once
just save me from it all
For I still bear hope in my heart
and don't want to feel agony again...
Â 
Let's leave sympathy apart for once
just save me from it all
For I still bear hope in my heart
and don't want to feel agony again
Â 
Don't forget about our flame
It is what keeps us alive
Â
