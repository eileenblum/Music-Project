It's time to empty the bag my friend
The sandcastle has collapsed along with your lies

(You're not the same...) Is this the end?
(And you've played your game) You've had your chance
The time to face reality has arrived

I always gave the best of me
But nothing ever got back to me
And all I've sacrificed and strived for
All I've hoped and cried for
Never seems to be enough...

All that I want seems to much to ask
And all I need hides behind your mask
I need something that makes me feel alive
And someone who saves my life

Don't lie to me, 'cause memories
One day will come together and you'll have the deal with them forever

It's time to empty the bag my friend
The sandcastle has collapsed along with your lies

(You're not the same...) Is this the end?
(And you've played your game) You've had your chance
The time to face reality has arrived

Don't lie to me, 'cause memories
One day will come together and you'll have the deal with them forever

...It's not too late...

Take your last chance, it's not the end
