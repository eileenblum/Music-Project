Why can't I understand you?
The path you're on I can't get to
Why can't I feel you in my heart?
We're drifting so far apart
Â 
Don't make it up, please be sincere
'cause I just can't sleep at night, since you're not here
Â 
Sometimes I want to fucking scream
Scream 'till I have no voice
Have someone to hold me
Tell me there's another choice
Â 
Take my hand I'm here for you
Let me in, we'll make it through
Â 
Sometimes I want to fucking scream
Scream 'till I have no voice
Have someone to hold me
Tell me there's another choice
so...
Â 
Take my hand I'm here for you
Let me in, we'll make it through
Â 
Why can't I understand you?
The path you're on I can't get to
Why can't I feel you in my heart?
We're drifting so far apart
Â 
Don't make it up, please be sincere
'cause I just can't sleep at night, since you're not here
Â 
Don't make it up, just be sincere
I swear I'll do my best to get back on your path
Â
