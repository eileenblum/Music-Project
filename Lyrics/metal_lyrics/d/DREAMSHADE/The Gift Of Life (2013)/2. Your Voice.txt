'cause I'm not coming home tonight

My time isn't come 'till I say so
Â 
My own solution is an evolution in my state of mind
I want to avoid this disaster
My own solution is an evolution but I am so blind
while time runs fast and I...

Hate your voice, when you're upset
But I know... but now I know I have no choice
so I regret, forget the time we spent...
Â 
I hate to hear your voice, when you're upset
But I know... but now I know I have no choice
so I regret, forget the time we spent...
