[Kevin:]
Will we ever know where we came from
or find the first signs of creation?
Â 
(Will we ever know?)
Â 
These questions hound us
since the beginning of times
Nobody has ever been able
to give humanity an answer
and we're still waiting for one...
Â 
Life is a giftÂ given to men by something we don't know
Don't let it driftÂ away and pick the fruits of the seeds we sowed
Â 
Explore the Universe
breathe new dimensions
and find the answers
to those eternal questions
Â 
From the bottom of our hearts
to the tips of our tongues
we're all conscious
we are not alone
Â 
We must knowÂ who put the seeds of life on Earth.
Â 
and still...
Â 
These questions hound us
since the beginning of times
Nobody has ever been able
to give humanity an answer
and we're still waiting for one...

Life is a gift given to men by something we don't know
Don't let it drift away and pick the fruits of the seeds we sowed

[Fella:]
Will our creator ever show himself to us?
Time for humanity has come to open up our eyes
Earth has become our grave
but we won't die buried in our ignorance
Don't let evolution stop.
Â 
Will weÂ ever know where we came from
or find the first signs of creation?
Don't let evolution stop and find salvation
Â
