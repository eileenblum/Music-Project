[Kevin:]
What am I supposed to do?
If it was up to us we could have slept forever
in the bed of our ignorance
We're so lazy that it takes a war to wake us up

[Fella:]
What do we really want?
Is it just money and vices?
How do we know when it's time to strive for something?
Why is what we really need just so hard to get?
And who'll decide for us if we'll not be ready yet?

[Kevin:]
We always claim to deserve something
but now it's time... it's time to realize
We can't stand on this world alone
This time I will survive
and nobody tell me how to live my life!

I've heard this story a thousand times
and it never had a happy ending
It's made of glory and crimes

We always claim to deserve something
but now it's time... it's time to realize
We can't stand on this world alone
This time I will survive
and nobody tell me how to live my life!

What we need is one of those moments that leave you breathless
I'll breathe life deep
