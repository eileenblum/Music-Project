We all know that
Time is the worst enemy of men
runs fast and never comes back
and even though we think to be free
There is no way out
We're all prisoners of it
Â 
So one last time, stay by my side
between the sea and the stars
Read through the scars in my mind
and you'll see the beauty of life again
Â 
Leaf through the pages of my heart
and you'll see the way I got these scars
Â 
I know it's useless to speak my mind at this point
but there must be a way, to get rid of this weight
Â 
I am just trying to understand what the past tastes like
what is right, what is wrong
what is worth and what is not
Â 
Sometimes I wish I could have had more time
to makes things clear, to explain how I felt
The time we wasted left it's mark on me
That no one will ever erase...
Â 
Leaf through the pages of my heart
and you'll see the way I got this
Leaf through the pages of my heart
and you'll see the way I got these scars
Â 
So one last time, stay by my side
between the sea and the stars
Read through the scars in my mind
and you'll see the beauty of life again
Â 
I am just trying to understand what the past tastes like
what is right, what is wrong
what is worth and what is not

Sometimes I wish I could have had more time
to makes things clear, to explain how I felt
The time we wasted left it's mark on me
That no one will ever erase...
