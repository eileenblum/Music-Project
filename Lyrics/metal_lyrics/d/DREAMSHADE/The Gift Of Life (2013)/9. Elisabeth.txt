Was my life just a badÂ dream
or did I lose my reality?
You ruined it all, now heal me
As I may still have the chance to be free
Â 
Robbed of every emotion
My life's a fucking infection
Since all I had and loved seems disappeard
not getting back what I lost is my biggest fear
Â 
In every moment, in every instant... your violence surrounds me
In every moment, in every instant... your violence is inside of me
Â 
18 years...
Â 
It's been so long but I survived
Stuck in hole for a lifetime
I wondered if I was alive
Although it's over I still feel
Â 
In every moment, in every instant... your violence surrounds me
In every moment, in every instant... your violence is inside of me
Â 
And now I'm free in the prison of my memories
but I'll never know what I'd have become

Â
