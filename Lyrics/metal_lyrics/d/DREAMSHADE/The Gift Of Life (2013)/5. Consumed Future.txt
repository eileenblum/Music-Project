Mama says I'm not good at anything
Keep my mouth shut, say nothing
Not venting my thoughts, just sit and waste
like a living ghost, cause I feel misplaced
Â 
I want myÂ dream
but it feels so far away
I want to be on the cover of magazines
I want to be on MTV or have my own reality
Â 
I wish they would break down the walls to get to me
Isn't this so fucking insane?
The world behind the box is taking over my brain
Â 
Mama says I'm not good at anything
I stare at emptiness and say nothing
Don't open my mouth, just sit and waste
Like a living ghost, cause I feel misplaced
Â 
I hate seeing all this shit
but at the same time I want to be a part of it
"Suicide!" Repeats itself in my mind
Â 
I wish they would break down the walls to get to me
Isn't this so fucking insane?
The world behind the box is taking over my brain
Â
