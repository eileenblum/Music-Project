I've been trying to find a way
To repair the mess I've made
So, I wrote a song for you

Every day seems the same to me
You walk away leaving nothing left to say
You make me feel like shit

I've been trying to find a way
To repair the mess I've made
So, I wrote a song for you

I can't be the way you want
Stop pushing
No, I can't stay no more
It's killing me
Don't wanna play your game
Don't wanna feel like this again
It's over

Now I see what you did to me
Made me believe there was something wrong with me
You just screwed up my mind

I've been trying to find a way
But I guess it is too late 
So, I'm gonna stop now  

I will be myself from now on
I will be myself 
And I will never fall again

I can't be the way you want
Stop pushing
No, I can't stay no more
It's killing me
Don't wanna play your game
Don't wanna feel like this again
It's over
It's over
