Do you believe 'em when they say,
"No man's an island."?
You need to face it.
Let this be.
No reason to wait for me.

I know you want me.
You want me back.
I see right through you.
But let me tell you one last time
"No love can fly on broken wings."

I've seen the girl that you've become,
your eyes are empty.
Looks like you're lost on your way home.
No need to wait, I won't return.
I know you'll hate me
'cause you don't like to sleep alone.

One line was drawn,
once and for all!

I promised I would not return and left you alone.
It was the hardest thing I've done. (Yeah!)

It brings me down.

You hate to sleep alone!

They sayâ¦
I'm not the man I used to be, I'm not the same anymore.
They sayâ¦
I'm an unreliable bastard, a fuck-up to the core.
They sayâ¦
I trust no one. I love no one. I only give to receive.
They sayâ¦
They say a lot of things but it's up to you what you want to believe.

I've seen the girl that you've become,
your eyes are empty.
Looks like you're lost on your way home.
No need to wait, I won't return.
I know you'll hate me 'cause you don't like to sleep alone.
