Another sunset falls
awaiting your return.
I wish upon a star,
for what it's worth.

The sea can't wash away a brother's love.
I've got so much to say to you.

Waiting for all this time (oh, oh)
Enlightened by a starry sky.
Staring at Ocean tides I think of you.

Even though you're away you're still there for me
and I just wonder when you will be back again.

The sea can't wash away a brother's love.
I've still so much to say on my mind.

The distance between us
ain't going to tear us apart
and from the start I've been here

I've been here

Waiting for all this time (oh, oh)
Enlightened by a starry sky.
Staring at Ocean tides I think of you.
Waiting for all this time. (oh, oh)
Enlightened by a starry sky.
Staring at Ocean tides.
