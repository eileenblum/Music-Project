Many doors stand before me
but itâs hard to choose the right one

I am the only one who can write this page.
(Never stop to believe)
Try and fail is not a shame, 
be ready to get up and start again!

Life gets cruel sometimes but I can still fight with a smile.

Dreaming makes me feel alive.
Falling in my thoughts Iâll be revived
Thatâs the way I will lead my life.
Join me and leave your past behind.

No time to weep âcause there will be other falls. 
(Your only enemy could be you! )
Dreamers donât sleep, we never stop.
My futureâs there for me to choose.

Life gets cruel sometimes but I can still fight with a smile.

With my defects I stand.
My dreams , my faith, complete me;
I couldnât do this on my own,
without them.

Dreaming makes me feel alive.
Falling in my thoughts Iâll be revived.
Thatâs the way I will lead my life.
Join me and leave your past behind.

With my defects I stand.
My dreams complete me;
I couldnât do this on my own,
without them.
