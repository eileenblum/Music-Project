"Are they giving us some room to grow
or pushing us deep in a hole?"
Is this all you need to know?

All your fears are knocking at your door,
you're lying on the bathroom floor.
Is this your only way out?

What would you gain from this?

You don't wanna go and let this just be another memory.
We can't pretend again.
You don't wanna go...

(I lie awake)
Every time I look in your eyes
some little piece of my heart dies
(Tonight I will not sleep)
'cause I see you crying for a world you despise.
As time flies by, you tell me:
"How can you live when your love is denied?"
Mate, you've got to realize it
Get back on your feet
Stop feeling ashamed
Tell me, what would you gain from this?

What would you gain from this?

You don't wanna go
and let this just be another memory.
We can't pretend again.
I just wanna know
what hides behind your broken hopes and dreams.
We can't pretend, oh no

Time to clear your mind
and face the fears you hide
'til you see the light

You don't wanna go
and let this just be another memory.
We can't pretend again.
I just wanna know
what hides behind your broken hopes and dreams.
We can't pretend again.
You don't wanna go
