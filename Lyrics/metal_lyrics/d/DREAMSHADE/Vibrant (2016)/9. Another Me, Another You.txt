Sinking in my bed,
Staring at the ceiling while I try to sleep.
The voices in my head are telling me the meaning of the secrets you keep.

I can't forget the words you said,
they're stuck inside my head.
I'm living a lie.

I thought I knew everything about you
but this is something new.
I didn't expect it.
I thought I knew all about myself.
This is how it ends here.
Another me. Another you.

Never felt so weak.
Haunted by the feelings and the memories.
How could you let me down like this?
(Oh, no, no)

I can't forget the words you said,
they're stuck inside my head.
I'm living a lie.

I thought I knew everything about you
but this is something new.
I didn't expect it.
I thought I knew all about myself.
This is how it ends here.
Another me. Another you.

I might be blind but my heart can see.
This situation doesn't work for me.
I might be deaf but my heart can hear.
I guess that something's got to give.

I thought I knew everything about you
but this is something new.
I didn't expect it.
I thought I knew all about myself.
This is how it ends here.
Another me. Another you.
