Oh no!
I'm not OK.
I feel out of place
and I can't control all these feelings
and all my thoughts.
How to clear my mind get to realize
that there is something more outside?

Tonight I'm feeling like the world is in my hands
there so much more I want to see
and I can't wait to give the best of me!

I've been so blind,
I gave up a thousand times.
Now it's all clear
I face my fears
Being myself has never felt so right
All we need is just a spark to ignite.

Tonight I'm feeling like the world is in my hands
there so much more I want to see
and I can't wait to give the best of me!

We are the solution and we will forever be.

Tonight I'm feeling like the world is in my hands
there so much more I want to see
I'll give the best of me!
Tonight I'm feeling like the all world is in my hands
and I'm not scared of nothing anymore

The world is in my hands

The world is in our hands
