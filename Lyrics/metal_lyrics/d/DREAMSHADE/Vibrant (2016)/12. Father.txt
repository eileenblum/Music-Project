I took my time to reflect upon life,
realizing how much you mean to me.
Look through these sparkling eyes.
Can't you see your sacrifice?

What would I do if it wasn't for you?

Every moment lasts like years
in the shades of yesterday.
Wipe your tears away
Oh father, fatherâ¦
Always gave the best of you
and taught me all I know.
Just stay here, stay with me.
Father, oh father

â¦And I'd be so lost without you.
One day I swear I'll pay you back.
I was never able to show you my love.

Take my hand and walk with me through my darkest nights.
I'm just so scared of what life holds
but you're always by my side.

What would I do if it wasn't for you?

Every moment lasts like years
in the shades of yesterday.
Wipe your tears away
Oh father, fatherâ¦
Always gave the best of you
and taught me all I know.
Just stay here, stay with me.
Father, oh father
