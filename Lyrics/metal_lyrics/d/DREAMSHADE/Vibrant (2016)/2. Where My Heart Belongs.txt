We never miss a thing until it is all gone.
This song is all Iâve left,
It takes me back to you.
Missing the place I always loved
So maybe my choice was wrong.
Missing the days when I felt strong
So here Iâm done.
Let me go.
It has been far too long.
Now I know Iâm coming home,
where my heart belongs.
I canât believe itâs real.
I never thought I could make it
but after all these years
Iâm coming back to you.
Missing the place I always loved
So maybe my choice was wrong.
Missing the days when I felt strong
So here Iâm done.
Let me go.
It has been far too long.
Now I know Iâm coming home
where my heart belongs.
Let me go.
It has been far too long.
Now I know Iâm coming home
where my heart belongs.
Missing the place where I felt loved.
Iâm back where my heart belongs.
Missing the days when I felt strong.
Iâm back where my heart belongs.
