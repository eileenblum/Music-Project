Funny how life changes from day to day.
All that we have lived together
Now is nothing more than memories.
We find ourselves lost in this nonsense.

And I know why it's all over.
Perfection fades away.
We let destiny overcome
'Til we're no longer the same.

Sweetie, don't be afraid.
Mom and dad are here.
Sweetie, you'll be OK.
We've been just losing touch.

Now these tears fall down like heavy rain
And everything seems being senseless.
Time will heal your pain
So wipe your eyes cause life isn't endless.

And I know why it's all over.
Perfection fades away.
We let destiny overcome
'Til we're no longer the same.

Sweetie, don't be afraid.
Mom and dad are here.
Sweetie, you'll be OK.
We've been just losing touch.

Oh, oh
We've been just losing touch.
Oh, oh
We've been just losing touch.
