We stay up all night
Working hard and holding tight to make it.
Don't you know what it's like?
Don't you know?

I feel it.
I need to break away!
Can't stay here.
We're going crazy but 
do you believe what I'm saying? 

I'll get you out of here.

Think about the time we've been spending side by side
to make this.
Don't you know how long we tried?
Don't you know?

I feel it.
I need to break away!
Can't stay here.
We're going crazy but
do you believe?
Do you believe what I'm saying? 

I'll get you out of here.

And when you feel dead tired
remember I'm at your side.
I know it's tough sometimes
but in the end we'll make this right.

I feel it.
I need to break away!
Can't stay here.
We're going crazy but
do you believe?
Do you believe what I'm saying? 

I'll get you out of here.
