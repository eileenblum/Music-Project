No one feels the pain,
The pain deep inside that I feel,
No one sheds the tears,
The tears that lay down within me,
No one understands my silence,
The silence which embraces my aura,
No one knows my desolation,
The desolation which keeps me so distant,
No one senses the call of the ocean,
The ocean which called my name today,
No one was there with me,
The child which felt denial and hopelessness,
No one saw the lament of salvation,
The salvation which I dearly need,
No one but I,
Saw the nightside of Eden,
The nightside
