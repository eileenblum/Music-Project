Razing the corpse ridden fields of the dead beggars
Immacualte genocide of the horrific kind Impaling decaying bodies
On top of another Sadism the only cause Burning, disastrous filth
Strench spreads throughout meadows
Pastures and echoing valleys
Pestilence takes its course
Infecting the innocent souls
Impaling decaying bodies
On top of one another Sadism the only cause
Impoverished filth of the crucifier
Black death seeping and stalking the cold and gloomy fields
Two centuries of plague to follow
