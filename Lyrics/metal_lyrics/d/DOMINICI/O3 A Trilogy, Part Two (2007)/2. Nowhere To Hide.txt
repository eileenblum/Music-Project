For years I've worked this city
Where the streets are cold and gray
I've let some clean ones walk
I've put some dirty ones away
But nothing could prepare me for
The case I caught today
And if I have my way

There will be nowhere to hide
There will be nowhere to hide
Once I've picked up on the scent
On his capture I'll be Bent
There will be no where to hide

I had him in the house before
Handcuffed to my desk
If I'd only kept my temper
It would have been a good arrest
The arraignment was a circus
All eyes were fixed on me
The bruises I had given him on his face
Only served to set him free

That judge was out of line
I know he had it in for me
My little indiscretions
And my tainted history
So now this guy will walk
But I am going to make him see
That if it's up to me
If I have my way

There will be nowhere to hide
There will be nowhere to hide
Once I've picked up on the scent
On his capture I'll be Bent
There will be nowhere to hide
