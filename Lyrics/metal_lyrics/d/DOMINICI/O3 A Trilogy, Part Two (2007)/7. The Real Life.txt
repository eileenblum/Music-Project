The sun breaks through a tear in the clouds
A ray of hope in the darkness
The light cannot stay
To the black it gives way
The next is the real life, anyway

This world is but a stop on the journey
The path must be narrow and true
If I lose my way
I only can pray
The next is the real life, anyway

Everything will fade away when colors change to black
Everything will go that day and nothing will come back
Nothing will come back

The loss of this world will be trivial
Compared to what waits on that day
My kingdom come
My will be done
The next is the real life, anyway

The next is the real life, anyway
