He came into my cell today
And offered me a deal
He said he'd check my angle out
To see if I'm for real
He promised me protection
For myself and family
If I co-operate with him
He said I might go free

I told him my great story
He listened quietly
I opened up completely
He started believing me
It seems they had some knowledge of
These men who plan this fury
But never enough evidence
To convince a judge and jury

Together we might stop them
And save the world this time
To bring leaders together
And curb this heinous crime
A task as great as this one
The whole world must agree
The threat of annihilation
Would force them all to see

This most unlikely hero
Who reeks of drink and sweat
Can he be a messiah
The worlds best hope as yet
A task as great as this one
The whole world must agree
The threat of annihilation
Would force them all to see

Should I make this alliance
And throw my fate to chance
A toss of the coin, the luck of the draw
I'll throw my fate to chance
