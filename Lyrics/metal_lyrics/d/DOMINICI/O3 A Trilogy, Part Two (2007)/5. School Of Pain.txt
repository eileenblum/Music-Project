Is this what they call freedom
Justice and liberty
To take me unconvicted
And wrongly punish me

To strip me of my clothing
And throw me in this hole
A school of pain, imprisoned
With nothing but my soul

My brothers tried to free me
Their efforts cost their lives
They leave behind a legacy
And several mourning wives

Am I to blame am I insane
What education can be gained
In this school of pain

These men you say were with me
We're strangers one and all
Our time together in captivity
Unites us to one call

So once again the cure
Is worse than the disease
You wont know my intentions
Till after my release

Are they insane, are they to blame
For the education I have gained
In this school of pain

That witch with the dog
And the cigarette hasn't caught me yet
They threw that holy book
In the toilet bowl, wretched souls

So once again the cure
Is worse than the disease
You wont know my intentions
Till after my release

I've learned the game
At the school of pain
At the school of pain
At the school, the school of pain
I've learned the game
At the school, the school of pain
