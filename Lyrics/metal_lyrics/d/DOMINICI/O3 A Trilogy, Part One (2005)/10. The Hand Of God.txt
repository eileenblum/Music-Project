The hand of God has touched my soul
And showed me my true burden
For I know now what I must do
My destiny is certain

I opened up my heart and soul
I found that love had trapped me
Iâm not the man I thought Iâd be
The hand of God has slapped me

I hold the key to life and death
For everything around me
No man has ever had such power
The hand of god has found me

The time has come, the gloves are off
Revenge will come in time
With no one left to tell the tale
The hand of God is mine

I could turn and walk away
Accept my own defeat
But If I use the Hand of God
My destiny is complete

I should turn and walk away
Exonerate the worldâs deceit
But If I choose this Hand of God
My destiny will be complete

The Hand of Godâ¦
This Hand of Godâ¦
My Hand of God!
