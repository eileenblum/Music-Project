Iâm a lowly worker for very little pay
Have to get up early every day
Just to get some pennies in my hand

I made some new friends and they tell me
This is the land of opportunity
I could rise above if I make my stand

I could be a king in my new land
Could have everything in my new land
I could take some threads and make a coat,
Have my own shop and I could vote
I think I want to stay in my new land

I never knew that freedom could be so sweet
If I had a girl my life would be complete
We could walk the beaches, hand in hand

We could build a house with a white gate
I could walk the dog and we could stay up late
Bringing up the baby would be so grand

I could be a king in my new land
Could have everything in my new land
I could take some threads and make a coat,
Have my own shop and I could vote
I think Iâll make a note to change my plan

In my new land
In my new land
I could be a king in my new land
Could have everything in my new land
Learning how to sing in my new land
My new land, my new land
