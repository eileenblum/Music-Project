While working in my shop
I heard the doorbell chime
A stranger stood before me
A chill ran down my spine
He held a written notice
I knew at once was mine

A parched piece of paper
A code I recognized
I knew it was the order
Yet still I was surprised
I was waiting for this day
I was sure I would be fine

Why this feeling in my gut?
Why this reeling in my mind?

I mustnât show this messenger
Canât let on Iâm insecure
In my homeland I was sure
I was chosen for this reason
Now Iâm blind with thoughts of treason

My pounding heart, my palms are sweat
The time has come to pay my debt

I wish my god who guides my hand
Would strike me down now where I stand
For I must choose between my new world
And what is now the foreign land

I was waiting for this day
I was sure I would be fine
I curse this feeling in my gut
Damn this reeling in my mind

Will this nausea subside?
Can I abide with this malign?

I wish my god who guides my hand
Would strike me down now right where I stand
For I must choose between my new world
And whatâs become the foreign land
What is now the foreign land
