I was barely ten years old
Taken from my bed in the dark and the cold
From the other room I heard my mother scream
I wasnât quite sure if it was real or a dream
They said âlisten boy youâre a soldier nowâ
Like it or not this is how itâs going to be

Itâs hard to know
Who is the enemy?
I search my soul

Months went by in the desert sea
Where holy men were training me
Pushed like a pawn in some great plan
I soon found myself in a foreign land
They said âBlend in well, youâre a sleeper now.
Youâll be contacted soon with the why and howâ.

I want to know
Who is the enemy?
I search my soul

I think about my family every day
The look on their faces as I was dragged away
I was an unwilling volunteer
Never told why they sent me here

I need to know
Who is the enemy?
I search my soul
