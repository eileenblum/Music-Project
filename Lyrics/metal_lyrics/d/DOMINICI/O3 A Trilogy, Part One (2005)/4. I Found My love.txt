While praying in the park today
The fairest girl did pass my way
I confess my mind did go astray
Another kind of heaven
I convinced myself it was OK
I could always pray another day
She was like a prayer anyway
A different path to heaven

I found my love
I did not expect it
I found my love

Days were turning into months soon after
I was living just to hear her laughter
Dancing in the park-the very spot
Where I used to pray
I admit that I did go astray
I knew there would be a price to pay

I found my love
I did not expect it
I found my love
Now I must protect it
