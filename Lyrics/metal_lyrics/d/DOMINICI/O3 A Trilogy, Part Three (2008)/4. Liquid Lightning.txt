I trailed him under cover of night
Down a dark and dusty road, out of sight
He disappeared completely right before my eyes
There beneath the pale moonlight

A flash of burning color
A fire in the trees
A sickening vibration
Brought me to my knees

A frozen fire
Burned my eyes
Am I dreaming, is it real?
Liquid lightning
Cracked the skies
Have I lost my mind?

I had no drink or smoke
My mind was crystal clear
I can't explain
How did he disappear?
My thoughts were going in and out
I barely made it home
I can't forget the fear I felt
Frozen in my bones
I thought I saw him vanishing
Into a metallic cloud
It hovered right above me
But it didn't make a sound

A Frozen fire
Burned my eyes
Am I dreaming?
Liquid lightning cracked the skies
Have I lost my mind?

A Frozen fire
Burned my eyes
Am I dreaming?
Liquid lightning cracked the skies

A Frozen fire
Burned my eyes
Am I dreaming?
Liquid lightning cracked the skies
Have I lost my mind?

[The prisoner returns with a crazy story. He tells the detective that
there are 6 other angels of death and that his captors were not of this world.
There is to be a great reckoning. He and the other six have been instructed to carry out the "plan" very soon.]
