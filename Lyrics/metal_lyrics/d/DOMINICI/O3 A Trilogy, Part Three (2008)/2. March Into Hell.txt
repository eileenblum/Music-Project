Now the eagle flies to aid her fallen sister
Fear and anger growing around the world
Blinded, the false prophet still rings his bell
Signaling his soldiers to march into hell

We've learned to live in pain and fear
We know the end is very near

Never ask for whom the bell is tolling
Never ask me, don't ask me
Never ask for whom the bell is tolling
It tolls for thee
It tolls for thee!

Now the story is getting old
It's all they talk about on TV
It's nearly over and then we're told
Another twenty dead, another three

The fragile hope is history
Talks of peace turn to words of war
The skies are filled with birds of prey
That devour any hope for peace today

Fight or flight
Wrong or right
Day and night
This is our daily plight

Never ask for whom the bell is tolling
Don't ask, don't ask me
Never ask for whom the bell is tolling
It tolls for thee
It tolls for thee!
