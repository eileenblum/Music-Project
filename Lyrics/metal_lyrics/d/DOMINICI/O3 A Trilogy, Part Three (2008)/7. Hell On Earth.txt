Can you hear the sound of Bazuzu in victory dance?
I tell you none of this is happening by chance

We gave you mountains, rivers and streams
We gave you woman that she may fulfill your dreams

Gave you the elements so you'd find fossil fuel
Wildlife companions but to them you have been cruel

We are not pleased with you!
Now your reign here is through!

Gave you free will with which to do as you may please
Gave you commandments but you did not follow these

Your whole world hangs at the end of the rope
We were amused when you thought you had a new hope

We gave you the choice of good or evil now and then
They both exist but only in the hearts of men

Our 7 angels will fulfill your prophecies
Destroy the world below and everything that breathes

(spoken)

Now...
Bowl 1 is poured out on the land
Bowl 2 is poured out on the sea.
Bowl 3 is poured out on the rivers
Bowl 4 on the sun
Bowl 5 is poured out over the throne of the beast
Bowl 6 over the Euphrates, the kingdom of the beast on earth
Bowl 7 is poured out into the air and the cities of the nations collapsed
...It is done!

[Detective Anthony Dam is prepared for his final destination. He is told the truth and the reasons for everything. He is the sole survivor and the only living carrier of the human DNA. He will be placed in a cleared spot back on Earth, in a garden, in order for human life to flourish again.
The only thing he will remember is his name and that he was placed there by his creator, a superior being. He is wearing the remnants of a shirt with his name embroidered; "A. Dam" on the pocket.
The captors refer to him as "Adam". Before being placed on the surface, some DNA is taken from one of his ribs in order to create for him a female companion.]
