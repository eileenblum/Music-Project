Something is familiar about this crazy story
Where have I heard of this plot before?
Something I read somewhere or a film I've seen
Why is there always darkness at my door?

There's a shadow hanging over me
I hear voices in my head
Revelation, of prophecy!
Is this the end?
Devastation! A tragedy!
Is this the end?

As I search through every library
Desperately looking for an answer
Is my past catching up with me
I can almost see the pages turning faster

What are these voices trying to tell me?

"You will go back to field where you first encountered us. We have something for you"

I think this is what I'm looking for
This old book so revered by man
Revelation, of prophecy?
Is this the end?
Devastation! A tragedy?
Is this the end?

I think this is what I'm looking for
This ancient book revered by man

Revelation, of prophecy?
Is this the end?
Devastation! A tragedy?
Is this the end?

Dark! The only part that troubles me
Fear! What stands out in my mind
Loss! According to this prophecy
Pain! There's no hope for mankind

I think this is what I'm looking for
This old book so revered by man

Revelation, of prophecy?
Is this the end?
Devastation! A tragedy?
This is the end!
