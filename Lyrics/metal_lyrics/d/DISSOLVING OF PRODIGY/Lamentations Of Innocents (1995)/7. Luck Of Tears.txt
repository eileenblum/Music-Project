Hear my song, which my breast opens me,
To my hands can lay my heart into your palms of hand.
My love, my love is mournful ship
Sinked in the sea, in the sea of my tears.

Ah my tears!

As rainbow overarch across you her smile
Full of sunsolight and smell of sage.
Exactly you were stick also in my dream.
Now I awake and my eyes full of uncertainty look up...

... to turquoise sky.

Grief, grief this is everywhere, everywhere where you donot bloom.
Addressed by my sadness, I pass all, what when were.
My thought flies toward on black wings of tomorrows,
Toward tragical end of my martyr part.

By mournful handwriting of sadness
Stay forever engrave my tears
In my recollections
On the wall of my wailing.

My soul is full of lamentations,
But sweet is my suffering.
My heart is until to border full of joy,
But my luck is of tears.

Thorny, thorny is my way to your heart
And my suffering soul is full of gashes.
About more this, sadden my eyes, when see how your love
Dies before than she was born.

By mournful handwriting of sadness
Stay forever engrave my tears
In my recollections
On the wall of my wailing.

My soul is full of lamentations,
But sweet is my suffering.
My heart is until to border full of joy,
But my luck is of tears.

Exactly you were stick also in my dream.
Now I awake and my eyes full of uncertainty look up...
... to turquoise sky.
