Look of my eyes, full of sadness
Spread diffusely on affable curves
Of your innocent body.
My sorrow is waterfall dash tompieces
About crystal surface of finded luck,
Later dresses in blossom of Narcissus.
I stray to gather fragments of your voice.

Echo!

In mourning hopeless I heart
In my inside terrible lamentation.
My bankless longing, like snow flake
Dissolve my hope.
I cry and your mouth stay mute.

In your palms of hand I give you my heart - my heart
Unfathomable fate knows, if to you belongs - belongs
Where my lamentations wafts wind only - only
There my soul dreams about you - to you
My lost luck dresses in blossom of Narcissus.
I stay to gather fragments of your voice.

Echo!
