As the cold penetrated in my body
And I heard the child's crying,
Then the strange woman I saw
And in her arms my soul infatuated the sorrow.

Ah no, I departed, departed and lost my love.
In a dream I saw her my dead body to embrace.
I mourned for her, yes, mourned and hoped
That in my new being I would find her perhaps.
