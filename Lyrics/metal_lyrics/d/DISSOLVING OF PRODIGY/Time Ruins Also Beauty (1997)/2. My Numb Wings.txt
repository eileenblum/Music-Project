My numb wings...

Already I don't know the words,
Which once I have known.
No perhaps because,
I'd the god's beauty little sang.

Something's perishing in me.
The pain's impossible to deceive.
That one easily learns to fly,
But the wings leave to break.

My numb wings...

For you my heart beat.
His beating suddenly whispering became.
Only nornes know,
I in truth the lie distinguish.
Until after that...

I have seen the love, which in hatred changed,
The joy, which the saddest tears shedded,
The beauty, which in excess of horror scared,
The life, which the death hid under own cursed wings.

Already I don't know the words,
Which once I have known.
No perhaps because,
I'd the god's beauty little sang.

Something's perishing in me.
The pain's impossible to deceive.
That one easily learns to fly,
But the wings leave to break.

My numb wings...

Still glew in me,
My grief's cold heat.
Only nornes know,
It didn't stop to glew.
Not after that...
