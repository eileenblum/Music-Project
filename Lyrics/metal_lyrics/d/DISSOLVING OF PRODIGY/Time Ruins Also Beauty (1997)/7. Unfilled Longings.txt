Oh, how stone became for me this world,
The world which once in my heart I liked to carry so.
Oh, where has gone the rare flower,
Whose thorns haven't stopped to throttle my soul.

My hopes faded and my longings fell into oblivion.
I lived for love, but the dream became only suffering for me.
In bottomless despair changed my belief and waiting,
In tears is drowned my past and in my eyes the joy isn't yet,
Only unfilled longings.

Oh tragedy, the mother of my gloomy fate,
I can't laugh, when my yarn of life
From sadness you began to weave.

Oh, how I am afraid, afraid of new day,
This endlessly bitter pilgrimage through uncertainty.
My heart dies in palm of anxiety and distress
And my life fades veiled in vexing emptiness.

My hopes faded and my longings fell into oblivion.
I lived for love, but the dream became only suffering for me.
In bottomless despair changed my belief and waiting,
In tears is drowned my past and in my eyes the joy isn't yet,
Only unfilled longings.
