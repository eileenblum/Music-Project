I lived to love,
To retain your magic
In my memory.

By the prickliest thorn
Was engraved in my heart
Your name's beauty,
To my ears so much melodious.
In my hopeless eyes
The time my story started to read.
But stay forever
Only the whiteness from empty spaces.

Oh, how contemptuously laughted the beauty at time.
But unfortunate forgot the time ruins also beauty.

Time ruins also beauty...

And angel flew up to bulwark from foolish glasses.
By his face was charmed enough.
Willy to announce the discovery to the world,
Fell on the ground wistfuled in flight.

Oh, how contemptuously laughted the beauty at time.
But unfortunate forgot the time ruins also beauty.

Time ruins also beauty...
