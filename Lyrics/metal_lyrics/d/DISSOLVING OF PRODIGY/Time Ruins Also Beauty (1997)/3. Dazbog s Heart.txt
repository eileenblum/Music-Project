By the river of passion, empty longings without feeling,
Is Dazbog's heart, did someone take him sun in dawn?
It man disclaimed humility and to nymphs ordered to cry.
Yes a man became a man, want to rule to deadness in his arms.

By Perun's mouth was spread the renown of our land,
To Veles can in peace scatter his seed.
People asked god Svarog to stopped to hammer weapons,
But under pretence of peace was Dazbog by other god hurt.
Although our ancestors have disclaimed old pagan habits for ever
Gods were kind to them and didn't expel them from their land.
They gave only the pain as present to know the feeling of blame.
It for it perhaps we forgot, we are their sons.

By the river of passion, empty longings without feeling,
Is Dazbog's heart, did someone take him sun in dawn?
It man disclaimed humility and to nymphs ordered to cry.
Yes a man became a man, want to rule to deadness in his arms.
