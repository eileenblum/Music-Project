Prepare to what comes towards
My eyes are pointed elsewhere
Under is more to see than here

Let me go, let me out, let me fly
Let me be in my own dream
You could never set me free

Time after time it's the end of the story
Maybe it's time to let go
Time after time I'm defending from worry
Maybe it's time to let it go

Loose the tight grip you should
Stand beside of the mirror
What you see might disappear

Cry out, cry out forever
This is my life can't you see how
It would be better if you'd leave

Time after time it's the end of the story
Maybe it's time to let go
Time after time I'm defending from worry
Maybe it's time to let it go

Time after time it's the end of the story
Maybe it's time to let go
It's time to say farewell
I'm leaving for good now
It is time to let all go
Already dead everything that will follow
Now it is time to say goodbye
