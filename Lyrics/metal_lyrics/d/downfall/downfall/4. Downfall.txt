Morning comes with the fame
Leading towards the same end
Life ain't fair that's what I've been told
But I won't stay alone

By passing with the friends and their troubles
No wounds just broken souls
We will find a way
To high life, we'll never give in

Shout! - bow down
Shout! - Downfall
Shout! - bow down
Shout! - Downfall

Behind the mask and disguise
Lies a bitterness so fine
Touch my skin, oh so divine
And you won't stand alone

By passing with the friends and their troubles
No wounds just broken souls
We will find a way
To high life, we'll never give in

Shout! - bow down
Shout! - Downfall
Shout! - bow down
Shout! - Downfall

On with the show and shout
Bow down, to Downfall
On with the show and shout
Bow down, to Downfall

Bow, bow down

Shout! - bow down
Shout! - Downfall
Shout! - bow down
Shout! - Downfall

On with the show and shout
Bow down, to Downfall
On with the show and shout
Bow down, to Downfall

Bow
