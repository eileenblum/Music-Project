Bless the rain while I sleep
Guard my waking moments too
Let me be while I'm dead
It's just another fall
Another fall with no return

Drift aside to see it too
Who aligned that rose to you
In vein to die behind
To fall
To fall

Flames,
Wash away our sins before the judgement

In flames
Wash away our sins before the judgement
If we don't try to hold on,
We've all been lost in flames
Flames
Wipe away our dreams and leave us in darkness
If we don't try to hold on,
We've all been lost and heartless

Come closer with your death
Pull the weakness away from you
I'll inhale that bloody fate
A fate that shows our dawn
A bloody fate that shows the dawn

Let it all end up in tears
Throw away what is to come
Doesn't hurt so much to lie
To lie, to lie

In flames
Wash away our sins before the judgement
If we don't try to hold on,
We've all been lost in flames
Flames
Wipe away our dreams and leave us in darkness
If we don't try to hold on,
We've all been lost and heartless

Flames
Wash away our sins before the judgement
Before the judgement

In flames
Wash away our sins before the judgement
If we don't try to hold on,
We've all been lost in flames flames
Wipe away our dreams and leave us in darkness
If we don't try to hold on,
We've all been lost and heartless

(Heartless)
Wash away our sins before the judgement
If we don't try to hold on,
We've all been lost in flames
