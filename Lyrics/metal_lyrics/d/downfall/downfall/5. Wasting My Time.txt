I'm waiting again
Have nothing left to say
You wish that I
Would be something else
I'm vanishing away
In pandemonium
I lie when I say that
I could be the way you want

And I'm wasting my time
Where's the feel that I should estimate
No, oh no!
In this night that shines
Right through my eyes and you.

I'm still standing here
I have nothing left to say
You wish that I
Could fly in to the stars
I'm vanishing away
In pretending moment
I lie when I say that
I could be the way you want

I'm running away
And I won't get back to you

And I'm wasting my time
Where's the feel that I should estimate
No, oh no!
In this night that shines
Right through my eyes
That falls over you
Where's the feeling that I should estimate
No, oh no!
In this night that shines
Right through my eyes and you.

And I'm wasting my time
Where's the feeling that I should estimate
No, oh no!
In this night that shines
Right through my eyes
That falls over you
Where's the feeling that I should estimate
No, oh no!
In this night that shines
Right through my eyes and you
