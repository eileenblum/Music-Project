Forgive myself the day she came
Tears of joy falling
As I repeat her name
It's eternal someone said
But it burned a while with glowing flame
Then fade away

I've been buried
For her sake
Dead and buried
For my mistake

I'm not the only one
I feel it in my veins
I'm not awake I am alone

She admires her glorious role
Dancing in the golden streets
While I stagger to her door
I welcome my fears while knowing
An angel changed the side
And I got crucified

I've been buried
For her sake
Dead and buried
For my mistake

I'm not the only one
I feel it in my veins
Wishing to go, wishing to fly
I'm not the only one
I feel it in my veins
Wishing to fly, wishing to go

I've been buried
Welcome to my isolation

I've been buried
I'm not the only one
I feel it in my veins
Wishing to go, wishing to fly
I'm not the only one
I can feel it in my veins
Wishing to fly, wishing to go
I'm not the only one
I can feel it in my veins
Wishing to go, wishing to fly
I'm not the only one
I can feel it in my veins
Wishing to go, I show you hell
