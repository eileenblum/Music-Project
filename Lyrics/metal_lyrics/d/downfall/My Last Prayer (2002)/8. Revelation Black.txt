I'm sitting in my room with this, needle in my hand
I watch the time go by, heavens turn to sand

I wish this night would end and the shadows go away
I'm scared of every move that I will ever make

I've got this revelation
I've seen this revelation
I've seen this revelation
I've got this revelation in front of my eyes...

I'm feeling so insecure - when I got this planet in my hands

I'm laying in the room with this, planet in my hand
Shadows descent like a wrath, my mind turns to dust

I wish this night would end and the shadows go away
Now I'm scared of every move when I cross my hands and pray

I've got this revelation
I've seen this revelation
I've seen this revelation
I've seen this revelation in front of my eyes...

I'm feeling so insecure - when I got this planet in my hands
I've seen the time go by - I've seen the heavens turn to sand
I've got this revelation

I'm feeling so insecure - when I got this planet in my hands
I've seen the time go by - I've seen the heavens turn to sand
I've got this revelation
I've got this revelation
I've got this revelation
I've got this revelation in front of my eyes
