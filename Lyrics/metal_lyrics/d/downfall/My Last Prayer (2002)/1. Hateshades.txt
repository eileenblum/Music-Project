You...you put a thorn into my eye
You think that I'm longing to die
Torment is growing with every breath I take

You...you rip my soul from my heart
You killed the sun and now it's dark
Blinded by hate I am no longer same

And you...I can't explain to you why I'm walking away from you like this
I won't explain to you why I'm turning my head again and again
Hateshades upon me
All the tears are falling from the eye on you
You refuse to believe me
You think that I don't wanna live no more

And you...I can't explain to you why I'm walking away from you like this
I won't explain to you why I'm turning my head again and again

Hateshades upon me
All the tears are falling from the eye on you
You refuse to believe me
You think that I don't wanna live no more
