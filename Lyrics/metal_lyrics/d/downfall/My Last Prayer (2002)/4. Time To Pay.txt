I gave you everything, I gave you all my love
You pushed me away you threw my back against the wall
I wanna hear you say: hate!
Time has come to pay!

I'll come to you with the fear I don't know where to go
I don't know where I'm coming from
I'm coming to you with the fear I don't know where to go
I don't know where I'm coming from

Since the day you passed away you've been within my heart
Now I'm closing the door I cannot live with you no more
Hey I wanna hear you say: hate!
Time has come to pay!

I'll come to you with the fear I don't know where to go
I don't know where I'm coming from
I'm coming to you with the fear I don't know where to go
I don't know where I'm coming from

I'll come to you with the fear I don't know where to go
I don't know where I'm coming from
I'm coming to you with the fear I don't know where to go
I don't know where I'm coming from
[Repeat verse]

Where I'm coming from...no, no
Where I'm coming from
Where I'm coming from...
