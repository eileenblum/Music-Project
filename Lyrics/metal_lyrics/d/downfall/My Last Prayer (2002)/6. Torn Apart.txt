I broke the cycle of my love
Someone told me I can't go wrong
In these eyes I see all black
There's no time, no will to turn back

If you say you were there just for me
Why did you choose another way
You left me all alone in the dark
Why did you leave me, why did you go away

I'm killing you with my hands and then I go away
I'm killing you

You left me here with no love
Well, I'm dying within my heart
In these eyes I see all black
There's no time no will to turn back

If you say you were there just for me
Why did you choose another way
You left me all alone in the dark
Why did you leave me, why did you go away

I'm killing you with my hands and then I go away
I'm killing you with my hands and then I go away
I'm killing you with my hands and then I go away
Oh, I'm killing you - every day

When I'm all alone...my wounds are shown
Why did you leave me and left me bleeding on my own

I'm killing you with my hands and then I go away
I'm killing you with my hands and then I go away
I'm killing you with my hands and then I go away
Oh, I'm killing you - every day
