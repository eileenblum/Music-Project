Inside this hollow man, lies a hollow mind
Why did you treat me this way - you make me go away
Like an angel you came to me - with fire in your eyes
Like an angel you came to me - and you stayed in my mind

Let me tell you how I feel
Let me tell you how, when you walking away from me, I cry
Let me tell you how I feel
Let me tell you how, when you walking away from me, I cry

Inside this darkened mind - I'm a hollow soul
Why did you treat me this way - for you I went astray
Like an angel you came to me - with fire in your eyes
Like an angel you came to me - and you stayed in my mind

Let me tell you how I feel
Let me tell you how, when you walking away from me, I cry
Let me tell you how I feel
Let me tell you how, when you walking away from me, I...cry!

When you walking away from me I...cry
When you walking away from me I...cry
