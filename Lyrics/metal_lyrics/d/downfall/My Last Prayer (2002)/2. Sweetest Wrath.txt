With you I can walk across the sea
With you I can find the things that I couldn't believe before
With you I find the love that died long ago
With you I bring the light to where the sun won't show

With you I see all the things that bothered me for so long
The wrath of god, took the shelter of my sweetest suffering

With you I can sense the cool air
With you my heart is breaking when you say you don't believe
With you the seven deadly sins are gone away
You are the fresco of my love I heard you say

With you I see all the things that bothered me for so long
The wrath of god, took the shelter of my sweetest suffering

What you want me to be?
What you want me to be?
What you want me to be?
What you want me to be?

What you want me to be?
What you want me to be?
What you want me to be?
What you want me to be???

With you I see all the things that bothered me for so long
The wrath of god, took the shelter of my sweetest suffering
