I've been sleepwalking from the day I died
And I've been soul-searching from the moment I tried
Tell me why I feel this way
Tell me where I should have gone
From the day I crossed the line
I've been lost again

I've been shadow casting from the moment I crossed the line
And I've been disloving, your heart it can't be mine
Tell me why I feel this way
Tell me where I should have gone
From the day I crossed the line
I've been lost again

I've been lost again my friend

And I know what's best for me
Though I know it's not good for you
I keep chasing it until it's gone

And I know what's best for me
Though I know it's not good for you
I keep chasing it until it's gone

Until it's gone
Until it's gone...
Until it's gone......

Until it's gone
Until it's gone...
Until it's gone......
