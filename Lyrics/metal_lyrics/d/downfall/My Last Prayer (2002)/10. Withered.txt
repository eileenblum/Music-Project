I thought I could live without you
I thought I could be without your touch
You're away, I'm here and my soul is withering
I thought I could live without you
I thought I could be without your love
You're away, I'm here and my heart is withering

I thought I could live without your love, well oh no
I thought I could be without your touch
But now I'm withering
I thought I could live without your love, well oh no
I thought I could be without your touch
But now I'm withering

I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say without you
Someone tells me not to go on without you
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say without you
Someone tells me not to go on without you

I thought I could live without you
I thought I could be without your touch
You're away, I dwell here and my heart is withering
I thought I could live without your love, well oh no
I thought I could be without your touch
But now I'm withering

I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say without you
Someone tells me not to go on without you
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say without you
Someone tells me not to go on without you

I thought I could live without your love...
I thought I could be without your touch
But now I'm withering

I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say without you
Someone tells me not to go on without you
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say without you
Someone tells me not to go on without you
