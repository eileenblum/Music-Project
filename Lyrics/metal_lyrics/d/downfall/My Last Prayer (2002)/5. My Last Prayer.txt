In your eyes, where I see only shades of gray
Now they're walking besides me

Give me something I can believe in she said, give me something I only see
Rip off these razorblades from my heart, don't drown me in this lake of sorrow
And say me your prayer...

It's the last one you'll ever gave, please hold on
Give me something give me more, something to bury

In disguise you walk beside me, in your eyes I see nothing more than pain
Give me something I can believe in she said, give me something I only see
Rip off these razorblades from my heart, don't drown me in this lake of sorrow
And say me your prayer...

It's the last one you'll ever gave, please hold on
Give me something give me more, something to bury

In your eyes, where I see only shades of gray
Now they're walking besides me
And say me your prayer...

It's the last one you'll ever gave, please hold on
Give me something give me more, something to bury
