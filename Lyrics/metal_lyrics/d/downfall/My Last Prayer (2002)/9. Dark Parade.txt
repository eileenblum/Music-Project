I've been here and lived my life
These silent thoughts they make me cry
Pushing me over the edge of life
I can't pretend no more, this is the end
And I'm trying to get over you
But I can't help myself no more

Step in to my shade
Join the dark parade
Laughter as I fail - I'm going down insane
[Repeat verse]

You pierce my soul, without the pain
Pull down the curtains baby it's time to lay
Pushing me over the edge of life
I can't pretend no more, this is the end
And I'm trying to get over you
But I can't help myself no more

Step in to my shade
Join the dark parade
Laughter as I fail - I'm going down insane
[Repeat verse]

Step in to my shade
Join the dark parade
Laughter as I fail - I'm going down insane
