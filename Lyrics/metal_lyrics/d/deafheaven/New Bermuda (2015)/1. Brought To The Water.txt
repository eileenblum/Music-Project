Where has my passion gone? Has it been carried off by some lonely driver in a line of florescent light? Has it been blurred together in ribboned patterns on the night? Along the stretch of some unnamed plane, we began again. I saw in your face that weâre the same when we began again. A multiverse of fuchsia and violet surrenders to blackness now. My world closes its eyes to sex and laughter.
