With all life profane
The ladles cradling
Streams of buttermilk
Current stretch out
And alabaster lips unseal

So I may recall
The soft timbre of
Whisper in its stillness
Still

Alabaster lips unseal
So I may recall
I may recall
The soft timbre of
Whisper in its stillness
Still

Now

When a fawn
Stumbles into the road
Honeydew high
And deep in afterglow
Mind swarming
Mind small
Honeydew high
Transforming the soul

On purple sand verbena
I forgive its delusion
Caress its world view
Super bloom
Shelter canary yellow eyes

Then search to pin the legs
Of the stalking dog
That lends its teeth
To sticky, sad bedlam
War cries quake through lurching light

I bury a blade between its ribs
Bear hug the soft canine frame
Then smear ash
Then smear the ash on its brow

All who have forgotten
Remember now
Remember now
Now

Now
