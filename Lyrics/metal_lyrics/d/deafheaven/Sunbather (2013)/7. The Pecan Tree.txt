Drooling red from my eyes to meet the bitter
sun that shines past into light. Setting fire
to curtains in hope that youâre dreaming.
Destroying the tomb of memories from your
life. In the room full of family, but couldnât
find one. In the hallways lit up brightly,
but couldnât find myself. I laid drunk on
the concrete on the day of your birth in
celebration of all you were worth.
I am my fatherâs son.
I am no one.
I cannot love.
Itâs in my blood.
