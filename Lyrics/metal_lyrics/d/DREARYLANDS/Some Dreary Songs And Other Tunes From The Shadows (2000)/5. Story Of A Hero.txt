There's no winning, after all, who's the true victor when only death remains?
Anyway, let's begin the next killing.

So you are alive, not just alright.
A part of you is dead but you are still alive.
You came to the war to fight proud by the gods.
Your friends died in harness but you won the odds.

Blood spurted out and your heart burnt as fire.
So your eyes got wet with tears - Tears of a vampire.
You didn't drink enemy blood but you felt the red taste of the foes
You have killed or left dying in the waste.

Don't mind if just all your friends are dying in vain.
Remember the fight... You razed all your foes with might and main.

Never mind what is done, never mind who is dead.
In the shadows your bright died.
Never mind what is done, never mind who is dead.
All this grieving will be in your mind.

Now the war is gone... Blazes burning the ground.
Death is the true champion.
What's the prize? That's the price!
Your pride died in the war... Flames burning in your heart.

Now the war is gone, then raise your fist and yell that you are the winner,
You sent your foes to hell.
All around you is death, ravage, remains and gore.
Who's the true victor in this empire of war?

Never mind what is done, never mind who is dead.
The spilt blood is still alive.
Never mind what is done, never mind who is dead.
All this bleeding will be in your mind.
