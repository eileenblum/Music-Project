Sometimes you are so glad and fain, nothing hurts your heart,
And you feel the joy of life is just around you, ain is just so far.
Someone inside is sad and gone, nothing eases the woe,
And he feels the smell of death is just around him, sorrow is high and low.
In your boring life, nothing you need but your peace of mind

I've got to tell you the truth is in the air.
Don't make up your mind.
Face all the things that you fear in your life.
Don't live your life like an eagle that doesn't dare to fly.
Longer can be really your chains but you're still in a cage.

Can't you see? Don't be satisfied with the crumbs.
All you can't fear is to grow not to tumble.

I know there's no ache in my heart forever more I grieve
But I cannot remember in my life any joy to forget my grief.

Can't you see? Don't be satisfied with the crumbs.
All you can't fear is to grow not to tumble.

I know there's no ache in my heart forever more I grieve
But I cannot remember in my life any joy to forget my grief.

Sometimes you are so glad and fain, nothing hurts your heart,
But you feel the smell of death is just around you, pain is not so far.
In your boring life, nothing you need but your peace of mind.
