I look at myself and what do I see?
Life has no meaning, there is no future to me.
I have lost my way. All my wisdom is gone.
I thought that I just could keep on walking alone.

How fool could I be? What a blunder I did!
Now I know I was wrong, just your glare is all I need.
A shade in the dark is what I've tried to be.
I forgot there ain't shadows in darkness to see.

There are no shadows into the darkness.
I know you are the Queen of the Night.
I feel much darker lit by your brightness.
I know you are my Lady Light.

Oh Lady Light, I need your glare to be alive.
You are my life... There are no shadows without your bright.

I look at myself and what do I see?
Life has no meaning, there is no future to me.
Even if I grieve thousand years of pain, I know someday we will be together again.

Lady your light is my life.
I need your bright shinning over me.
Your glitter is the source of my might.
Alone in the dark I just cannot be.

There are no shadows into the darkness.
I know you are the Queen of the Night.
I feel much darker lit by your brightness.
I know you are my Lady Light.

Oh Lady Light, I need your glare to be alive.
You are my life, There are no shadows without your bright.

Oh Lady!
You're my Lady Light.
I need you to be alive.
I need you by my side.
What a mess I did!
In my life I can't live without you my Lady.
You're my Lady Light.
