I am the heir of Iolchus throne.
In my life there's just one goal.
I must retrieve my father's crown that my uncle once stole.
I must strive for it or fight untill I die.

I am the captain of this crowd who came from all Greece.
They're the bravest crew who ever sailed across these seas.
So many ventures we will find.
We'll face the hazard.
The sail is hoisted, the fifty oars are working hard.

We're sailing through the raging seas questing for the Golden Fleece.

The hardest waves we ride.
In the Argo we'll never fail.
In the highest waves we slide
The Argo where the heroes sail.

Tiphys, my friend, look at the sky and see the way we must proceed,
While Lynceus heed what's on our sight: a storm, an island or a ship.
Sons of Boreas, blow up the sail, too much faster we shall slide and
You Atalanta, you must be ready to skip over the tide.

Poseidon, give us might to win the waves of all raging seas.
Lady Athene, give us wisdom to win all dangers and enemies.

So listen to the advice, the Figurehead knows what's beyond
And you Orpheus, please play your lyre to give us force to carry on.
Castor and Pollux, you both be tight, 'cause before long we're gonna fight.
Hercules, the strong, you must be brave.
You know we'll need all your might.

Poseidon, give us might to win the waves of all raging seas.
Lady Athene, give us wisdom to win all dangers and enemies.
