Who are you creatures around me now?
Your angry faces grieve my precious mind.
Where do you go when night comes over you?
Your eyes seem just the hardest pain of all mankind.

My friend, where's my fantasy?
Was it all real or just a dream I had in a dreary night?
I can't believe everything was only in my mind

All I need is my real fantasy.
Let me here in my land, where I can feel the glee by my side.
All I need is my real fantasy.
Let me tell you my friend how happy a man can be just so blind.

Blindfold I cannot see on my face tears running down.
Dear friend, your eyes cannot see but in your heart there's someone who's crying out loud.

Who are you little children around?
Loading the weight of doom you cannot stand.
Where do you go when pain comes over you?
Your eyes seem just the eternal cold of wasted lands.

My friend, where's my fantasy?
Was it all real or just a dream I had in a dreary night?
I can't believe everything was only in my mind.

All I need is my real fantasy.
Let me here in my land, where I can feel the glee by my side.
All I need is my real fantasy.
Let me tell you my friend how happy a man can be just so blind.

Blindfold I cannot see on my face tears running down.
Dear friend, your eyes cannot see but in your heart there's someone who's crying out loud.
