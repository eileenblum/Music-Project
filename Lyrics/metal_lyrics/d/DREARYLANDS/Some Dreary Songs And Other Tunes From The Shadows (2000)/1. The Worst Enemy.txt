Please, listen closer to this song, my friend.
It tells about a former time.
An age when our crowd was so proud - Peace ruled this land.
An age when fire was all men would be afraid.

Welcome to our land.
Be our guest.
Welcome to our home.
Enjoy the best.

Midnight, tidings show me they are coming.
Strangers arriving from the raging seas.
Bright Mirror - I saw a face of happy man.
I thank you, take my gold and all that you want from my land.

Take a look in the mirror and heed.
Tell me what you see.
Face to face with destiny.
The worst enemy.
See your life decaying in front of your eyes.
Don't believe in a better day if you refuse to fight.

Welcome to our land.
Be our guest.
Welcome to our home.
Enjoy the best.

For all time, I'll feel ashamed, I've played the fool.
Strangers, they came from the raging seas.
Bright Mirror - I see a face of sick man.
I hate you.
You broke my soul, my heart, my faith, you took my land.

Take a look in the mirror and heed.
Tell me what you see.
Face to face with destiny.
The worst enemy.
See your life decaying in front of your eyes.
Don't believe in a better day if you refuse to fight.

Strangers, take my gold and all that you want from my land.
