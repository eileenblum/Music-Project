Time is over for me.
The battle is done and my heart feels the pain.
Dark is all that I see.
On my way I'm alone, crying tears alike rain.
I know the coming step is just the fall.

My village is dead, the mates are all gone and my heart feels the hate.
I don't know where I'll tread.
On my way I'm alone, crying tears of my fate.
Oh, Lord, why did not you hear my call?
I know the coming step is the fall.
I know I'm lost.

You stand on the edge of a cliff so high.
You may cast yourself or learn to fly.

Time is over for me.
The battle is done and my heart feels the hate.
Dark is all that I see.
On my way I'm alone, crying tears of my fate.
I know the coming step is just the fall.

Like a phoenix in fire, from the ashes I rise and my heart feels the flame.
I spread up my wings and bless my demise, crying out my name.
I know the coming step is the fall.
I know I'm lost.

You stand on the edge of a cliff so high.
You may cast yourself or learn to fly.
