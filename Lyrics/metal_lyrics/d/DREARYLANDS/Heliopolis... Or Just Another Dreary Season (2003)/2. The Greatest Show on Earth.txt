Be welcome to the show tonight. We're glad to have you here.
Just pay attention, please, my lord, and see what's coming for you
jugglers, acrobats, tamers, magicians, dancing on the rope, daring the death.

We play with poverty and crime, the starving misery.
Don't try to do this in your home. I know your mind would not stand the pain.

In my world, behind all the makeup there's a face so sad.
See the clown laughing at the ruin.

Now, see how we dance and play, braving the threats and dangers,
avoiding the final day, deceiving until the end.

Now we'll close the act. It's time to applaud.

I hope you have enjoyed our show. The Greatest Show On Earth.
Sempre Ã©s bem vindo para ver nossa aventura que Ã© o viver.

Meu senhor, atrÃ¡s do meu sorriso, guardo apenas dor (My Lord, behind
my grin, I keep only grief).
Sou um palhaÃ§o, rir Ã© minha sina (I am a clown, my fate is to laugh).

Nao, nunca vou desistir (No, I will never give up).
Se o sonho me leva a chorar, melhor saber fingir (If the dream makes
me cry, it's better know how to pretend).
Rir de mim afinal (Laughing at me after all).
Now, see how we stand and pray, braving the streets and dangers,
awaiting the final day, enduring until the end.
