I invite you to take part in our new old dalliance.
Prejudice and intolerance are all that you must warrant.
The only rule is the demise of every one who's guilty for the crimes
against our peace and you're the one who judge felons.

Let's kill the white and then the black, the red... why not the yellow?
Let's put the jew to death, the christian and moslem too.
Let's kill the atheist and the hindu... even the buddhist.

Let's celebrate the death of who is left and who is right and more.
The death of who's to say that our game is wrong.

So we can free the world from the curs, hypocrites and liars, although
I wonder if someone will last to clean the coarse blood shed on the
dust.

Let's kill the communist, the capitalist and then the terrorist.
Let's slay the nazi down... the imperialist too.
Let's kill the anarchist, the selfish one... even the nihilist.

Let's celebrate the death of who's to laugh and who is frowning on.
The death of these fools daring to play this song.

So we can free the world from the curs, hypocrites and liars, although
I wonder if someone will last to clean the coarse blood shed on the
dust.
