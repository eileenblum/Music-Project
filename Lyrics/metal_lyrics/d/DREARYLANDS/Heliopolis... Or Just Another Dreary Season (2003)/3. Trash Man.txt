Once I heard somebody say: Why don't you just die?
Since that day, this grievous question rumbles in my mind.

You can hate me... you can love me, but cannot drive my life.
Listen to the words I sing now as I clean out my heart.

I will change my future picking up the things once I gave away.
I'm carving a new self, reaping all the shadows of my past.

You can't see what's in your face... Your precious garbage is insane.
What you despise makes me alive... I am the Trash Man.

I will change my future reaping all the shadows of my past.
I'm carving a new self, picking up the crumbs, scars, shards and lies.

While you live a proper life, your petty existence, I obey my random
fate that you deem inconsequence.
You love to rate your conscience so clear, but does this count if you
don't use it?
I do prefer an endless puzzle as I may shuffle and piece my world.

You say nobody can live someone else's life.
So why do you live this guile?
Tell me envious mind.
I know nobody can die someone else's death.

You can't see what's in your face... Your precious garbage is insane.
What you despise makes me alive... I am the Trash Man.

While you live a proper life, your petty existence, I obey my random
fate that you deem inconsequence.
You love to rate your conscience so clear, but does this count if you
don't use it?
I do prefer an endless puzzle as I may shuffle and piece my world.
