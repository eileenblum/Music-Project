I found a body last night downfallen in the dark.
I tried to help but what I saw made me run away in pain.
My eyes descried my own face and before that mien not even cry.
Still feeling the acrid smell of death, I kept on my way, tearing my heart.

Now I guess they are digging down the earth and I wonder if there's
someone around, someone crying and mourning for this fate, someone to
lay flowers on the ground.
Let me die to see if there's someone shedding tears for me, someone
lighting candles over the grave, someone carving in stone my holy
name.

The rain is the only wailing (Tears falling in the dark).
I'll die alone and all my deeds will be buried down with me.
My eyes descry my whole life and staring the scene they start to cry.
Just feeling the blame for my solitude, swearing at myself, tearing my heart.

Now I guess they are digging down the earth and I wonder if there's
someone around, someone crying and mourning for this fate, someone to
lay flowers on the ground.
Let me die to see if there's someone shedding tears for me, someone
lighting candles over the grave, someone carving in stone my holy
name.

Let me die to see if there's someone shedding tears for me, someone
lighting candles over the grave, someone carving in stone my holy
name.

I heard someone is mourning (A whisper in the dark).
The lady weeps and her sweet tears make me throw away the pain.
My eyes burst out just crying and spitting my scream I set me free.
Still hearing the echoes of her voice, I keep on my way, cheering my heart.
