There is an ache inside your head just beating all the time.
You know the cure is in your hands.
The bell begins to chime.
You do believe you are the one who's going to save our souls.
All you can hear is the inner toll.
You must to kill our foes.

As I sit down here on the gutter, I can see the death falling thru the
sky and I wonder where they are rushing,as I take one more swig of my
cheap wine.

There is so pride inside your heart smothering your mind.
You know our lives are in your hands.
Redeemer of mankind.
You do believe you are the one who's going to save our land,
just ending all the tyranny, dictating the new trend.

But you don't care about the pain.
It's your addiction to war and you don't care about the fear and the
kill and the hope and the scars.

I'm looking inside the bottle, the fly is struggling hard and, as I
drown all my hunger, the fighter is dead.
You want the power to rule all the lands and the crowds and into greed
you will die drowned as the fly.

There is a war inside your head just striking all the time.
You know the cure is in your hands.
Only you can hush the chime.
You do believe you are the one who's going to tame the world.
Why can't you hear the cry of earth and listen to my words?

As I sit down here on the gutter, every blue and green turns to red
and gray and I wonder where's my last bottle, as I hear the sound of
the final day.

But you don't care about the cry.
It's your addiction to war and you don't care about the love and the
hate and the fall and the loss.

I'm looking inside the bottle, the fly is struggling hard and, as I
drown all my hunger, the fighter is dead.
You want the power to rule all the lands and the crowds and into greed
you will die drowned as the fly.

Do you believe you are the one who's going to tame the world?
Why can't you hear the cry of earth and listen to my words?

And you don't care.
It's your addiction to war.
