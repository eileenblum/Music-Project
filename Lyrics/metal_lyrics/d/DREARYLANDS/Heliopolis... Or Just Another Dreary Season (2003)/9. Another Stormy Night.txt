Now we must keep sailing, there are many seas we have to gain, high
waves to plow, misguiding tides to turn.
Bow your head to our new crowd, we're ready to go and bear away.
Hoisted flag, we are too proud, steering down to the horizon.

Another stormy night, so prove your goals are just true, close your
eyes and stay your course in sight.

So we must keep sailing, there are many fears we have to stare, hard
dangers to face, so many ventures to find.
Say farewell to all your friends, we're ready to board and leave the bay.
Weighing anchor, gripping bends, steering down to the horizon.

Another stormy night, so prove your goals are just true, close your
eyes and stay your course in sight.

Cruising on the raging seas of life, I saw many mates losing heart.
Heavy weather, doldrums, storms and lies, none of this will take me
out of my mind.

Another stormy night, so prove your goals are just true, close your
eyes and stay your course in sight.

So we must keep striving, there are many dreams to realize, new songs
to be sung and strange places to find.
So we must keep sailing forever and a day.

I still remember all the lands I arrived in every shadow of my heart.
