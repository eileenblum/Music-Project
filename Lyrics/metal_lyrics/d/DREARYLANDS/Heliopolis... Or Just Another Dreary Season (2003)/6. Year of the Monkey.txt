Can you tell me where's the future that I had before?
I remember when I was so younger and today would be a new outset.

I remember when the world was coming to the end and two thousand was
the final year.
Was the prophet wrong or are we dead?

Has the judgment day come and I did not enjoy or did you lose the Year
of The Dragon?
Holy father, tell me after all.

Has Armageddon failed? Is this like a post reality?
Or is this just our hell where in pain we'll be eternally?

How many years we have to roam spilling hate while we grin?
Can't you see our time is gone? We must pay for all our sins

The rats are harder, dragons fly high, but the messiah was a monkey.

Now I grieve yearning for the fourth millennium, waiting for the Year
of The Monkey.
When mankind will finally break down.

I remember when we rose from the frosty cave and I hope to see us back
in that den.
How I long for our pristine end!!!

I guess there's a new chaos and this is a post reality
Please, tell me this is our hell where in pain we'll be eternally

How many years we have to roam spilling blood across the lands?
Can't you see our task is done? Let the time just run its sands...
