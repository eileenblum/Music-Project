[Tote/Fralick]

Never awake
Let the nightmares set in
Truth is pain
When truth is dead
Sleep now
Forget all your fears
Life can only get better
When you don't live at all

Don't open your eyes
To only see confusion
Take each breath
Forget all your fears
Does life exist in your heart
When you don't live at all?

An ocean's mile is where we lay
Discovering that I see the way, nothing else will change
You're the passing wave that will drown us all
With the tide and a new desperation
An ocean's mile is where we lay
Discovering, nothing becomes the passing wave that will drown us all
This tide dies

[Lead-Fralick]
[Lead-Masri]

You follow the reaper (follow him down) Don't know which way to go
Life or carnage?
Possessed, this life is dead
Never wake up
Infinite dream
You follow the reaper
You awake from this dream
Away from the pain
You awake from this love
This life is dead now
