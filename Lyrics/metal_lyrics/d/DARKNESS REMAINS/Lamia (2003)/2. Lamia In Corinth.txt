[Fralick]

Unleash this terror on the human race
Specter of the night the one you fear
Hunger is here, this lust inside my mind
Slit the throats feast blood so red
You are now the walking dead
Breaking, crushing, souls within their shells
Be afraid of this
Gripping, holding on the life you ve had
Fall to me a slave to be a servant for eternity
Entanglement of this twisted mind
Destruction of your hollow life

Breaking away up from this day
You re changing the way you live now
You re breaking away inside your mind
You re breaking away
Breaking away up from this way of life
A servant for the demon walking at night
Breaking away

Shadows will follow you through the night
Of painfull blindness were innocence can t hide
Her beauty possesses undying light
Darkness upon us leaves us behind

Crawling serpents, with disgust
Apparition breaking away
Unseen hunters form break up from the day
Casket opens feast on your prey
Endless beauty
Wake up this frozen life

The cold comes
Your frozen in fear today
Hungry for, the fall
Of mankind s demise
