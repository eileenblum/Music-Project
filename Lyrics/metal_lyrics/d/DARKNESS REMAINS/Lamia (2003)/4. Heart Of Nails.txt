[Fralick]

Awakening
Buried in the ground
Call coming from ancient times says,
You ll never be found
Like the process of waking the dead

I see your rotting now
You re grotesque, putrid and dead
Tortured heart is nailed through
Whispering minds, decaying flesh chills the spine
Seeing with no eyes
Mind missing, but thoughts run through
Like the process of waking the dead

Breaking the boundaries
Heart beating that has now died
Like the process of waking the dead

Protect inside this heart has now slowly died
Torn apart, your mind is gone
You your dead die

[Lead-Fralick]
[Lead-Masri]

The heart of nails
