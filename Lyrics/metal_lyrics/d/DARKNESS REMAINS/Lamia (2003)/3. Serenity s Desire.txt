[Tote/Fralick]

I see this coming curse a raid
I am the moon that hides behind the clouds
And the one beam that glows through to shine away from you

My will is stronger than pain
Or do I force myself on what I cannot have?
This must be how I ll end my greatest challenge
This is where choice begins to fall behind
My dying wish that will be forgotten for you
And the way I regain my strength
To give up once again
The way I lost faith in tomorrow
And found a desire for serenity

I dread another dawn
One that will show my misery
She sees my confinement
With her radiant eye and soaring heart
My destiny has been deprived
For her soul is weeping distantly
A presence that belongs to the sky

You're falling apart
You're falling away from this time
You're falling apart

I would follow the light till dusk carries her away
Where life has no reason
And distance is all that I see past my pointing finger
Time has faded within every eclipse
And left me alone to a cold, cold world

Together they dance under the universe
With hope and chance
With change and peace
Now I've lost my desire
Fading out as far as my eyes can see
This is alone

Falling slowly with the tragedy
And without the calm beside me
Help is on its way
The waves crash and drown my sorrow
Sinking further down than ever before
[Lead-Masri]

Distant times are coming this way
His heart beats in passion
He is here today
The rage inside is changing the shape of his fate

[Lead-Fralick]

If I could reach the horizon I would tear it down
So I could see the stars forever
The cold rain is my sadness
And the tears that fall never-ending into my open hands
Asking me questions I could never answer
