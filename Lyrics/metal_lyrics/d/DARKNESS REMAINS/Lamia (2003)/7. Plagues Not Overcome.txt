[Tote]

The silence whispers behind me
The cold wind circling
Crystals shattering
Carried off by the breeze

Today takes a new form
And I try to keep away
It s been long awaited and promising
Even for the dreadful
Another leaf falls with intent and apprehension
Cold rain seeps to the edge,

The storms will never end
I haven't found a way
We won't overcome or escape today
We won't overcome
Plagues not overcome
Forest clasp and far I run

The path I've found will take us nowhere
Weak hearts break like perfect love
Loss will find me and tear us apart
Endless trail with frozen dreams
Misleading passageways to infinite entrances
Today your red heart is my black
Tonight's fate with no way back
Close your eyes today

Because loss will find you and tear us apart

I've been brought to chaos
And inner emptiness
Left pale and hollow
And you re gone forever

Passion is worthless at the end
What can be precious when it's all gone?
A cycle that's left unchanged
A fearfull ending for pouring tears

Vast plague, you haunt me
Sent down to torture me

Forever
Today takes a new form
And I cannot keep away
The storms will never end
And it beckons me

I've been brought to chaos
And inner emptiness
Left pale and hollow
And you're gone forever

[Lead-Fralick]
[Lead-Masri]

Your caress has beckoned me again
