Drowning
In a river of blackened doubt
Stripped away
All securities and comforts
Here I am
Hanging half dead from your values
Crucified [3x]
On a wall of what you thought I should be
I take it all
With a thorny grain of salt
Go ahead
What harm is one more spear in my side

Hang myself
From the words you said
Couldn't hurt more
Than what they meant

Rip my tongue
My words don't matter anyway
Torn apart
But being built back stronger
Took your worst

Nothing left could harm me more
These eyes of death
A beaming focus of my fate

These ghosts
Shall haunt forever
These ghosts
Shall haunt forever
