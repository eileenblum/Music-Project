Sands run low
Or was it high
Time sees no end
No end of time
Lives pass in strains
Yet seem to last
Infinite beings
Knowing no past

These days longing
Shortened by paths
Clinging to times
That never last
Shadows are cast
As suns pass by
Nights bleed to days
Days never night

Stone dials bleeding essence of time
Draining away the counts of life

Under eternity - Past ripped apart
Under eternity - Time shall depart

Clouds ripped apart
Lightning strikes ground

Under eternity - These days shall pass away
