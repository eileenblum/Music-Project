Death
Death
Death comes sweeping down
Filthy death the leering clown
Death on wings
Death by surprise
Failing evil from worldly eyes
Death that's born
As life succumbs
While death and love
Two kindred drums
Keep the time
To judement day
An actor in a passion play
Without beginning
Without end
Evermore
Amen
