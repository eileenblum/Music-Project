This mark you placed on me
Represents everything
I never wanted
To symbolize

The sad thing
Is I'm
Still in love
With the past

You honored me
With the blessing
Of your fruitless lies

Inside this tomb
My way is free
Your efforts failed to finish me

A grave too shallow, a tomb too hallow

I see all the life
See all the world
And seasons they fade
Seasons of pain
Seasons of change

Knowing now what I should have known then
I would have saved myself
If I had just
Killed you instead
If I had just
Killed you instead

No more lies

Now you die
