Lycanthropic
Refuge of sick
Curdled deep red
Minions unfled
Hating all light
Strengthened in night
Flames of hope drained
Darkness remains

Lucidic doom
Crimson tinged moon
Coffins shaken
Ancient awakened
Blackened powers
Weak empowered
Sanities border
New formed order
Chained in chambers
Good remainders
Blood flows faster
New found master
Nails in crowns now
Merciless and foul
This it truth now
This is truth now

Smile
You've inherited this
Through years of opression
