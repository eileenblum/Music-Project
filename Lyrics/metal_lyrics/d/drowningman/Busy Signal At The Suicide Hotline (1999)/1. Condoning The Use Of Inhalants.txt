All i wanted is just to feel high. Little black dots are floating in front of my eyes. Cracking and spinning. I feel high but I can't breathe, airplane glue up my sleeve. The cracking. The flaking. Everything is spinning around, everything is falling down, warm red water. Can't feel my fingers. I can't feel.
