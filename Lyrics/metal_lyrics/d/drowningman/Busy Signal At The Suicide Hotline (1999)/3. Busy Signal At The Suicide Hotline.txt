I want to hear you try to help me. I want to see you try to save me. I can feel it in my hands every time i dial. Oh dear god help me please because i don't want to die. 1, 2 , 3, 4...dead. It's all a lie exactly like i said. I did it. It's the time, the best time, 7 or 11, 10. Hang it up, try again. There're been a couple of really bad nights and I wasn't sure if i was going to make it. It's all i could do to stop myself from picking up phone. But now it's either I tie up the line or i let it...swing.
