I'll tear your fucking heart out, you bastard Get ready to die. Tell me how does it feel? I've got the knife in my hand and I'm pushing it in. You liar You bastard I know where you live, motherfucker, you'd better sleep with the lights on. Tell me how does it feel? I've got the knife in my hand and I'm twisting it in. She said "It'll only take a second and..." Hand me the knife, hand of god, hand me the knife, get ready to die. I don't care what you said. I don't care. You're fucking, fucking dead.
