Your radio can't hear me. You turn me down and tune me out. You signal can't reach me, your station can't feel me. The signal, the station. The last 20 seconds of hesitation. You can call me up if it starts to get quiet, 5,4,3,2,1... Ri ot. Supermarket Riot. Start your engines, start your riot. Green means go.
