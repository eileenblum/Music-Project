I've got the stages, everytime I try to touch you, that's what it's like. I've got the something. I can't even breathe, they built a shelf on my neck and my back. I've got the stages. I can't even say it. Why won't the words come out right? I've got the stages everytime I try to touch you every time I stand too close to you. You freeze the faces, and save them for dissection. you put the pieces in your pocket, smudge them out. Burn the stains to the edge with cigarettes and c herry red. Like secrets on a string. Standing on a line. Standing on the baseline baseline. Standing I can feel you Can you feel me?
