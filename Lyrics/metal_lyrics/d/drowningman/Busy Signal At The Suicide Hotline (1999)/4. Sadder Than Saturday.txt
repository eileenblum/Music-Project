"Wednesday night has always been my night." she said, and no one had the heart to disagree. There was a knife in the drawer....There was blood on the floor and everybody's looking for another way out. I don't want it anymore. Hands all through the window and they're breaking through the frame. It's not what you wanted. It's not what you needed. I'm not what you wanted. Not what you needed. I can't sleep at night. I swear to god I hear your voice outside of the window.
