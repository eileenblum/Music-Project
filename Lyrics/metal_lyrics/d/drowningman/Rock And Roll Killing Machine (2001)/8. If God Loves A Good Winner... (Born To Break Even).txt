those who are chosen do not ask why. if they ask say we don't care. when you're not here we're glad your there, we've still got our eyes in back. if they ask we didn't ask, we just want our bullets back. we'll stand on line to watch you die. historically oppressed. repeatedly marginalized made to stand on stupid lines. back rooms and detention halls. think of all the lives you'd save. your corner offices freshly painted interiors every last one will become your mass graves. say something anything at all if I was you and i'm glad i'm not all they'd hear is one gun shot. born to break even. we're taking over-weak willed. dedicated sinners. god knows, god loves a good winner.
