we're starting over, reset and counting down. now two keys are turning from stations underground. and if we made you feel this wouldn't it be seen as an attack? what once we were receiving, tonight, we're sending back. we are appearances. we are deceiving. all switches on. we are receiving. stilts built on emotion where logic used to stand, will delete all traces with one sweep of the hand. systems go, all engaged with switches on, seems so, so surprised it still turns on. died for your dials, your circuits burning. when we are ruled by our emotions- we approach our crimes with renewed devotion. and tell me can you feel it when your code is breaking? cut of the line, fell off the grid. now we're free y ea, we're free. you never had me, you just wish you die
