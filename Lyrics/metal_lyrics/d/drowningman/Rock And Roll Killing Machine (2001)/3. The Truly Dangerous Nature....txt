I'd rather be your coffin than your pillow because we press through flesh we break the skin. we push back through the skin. we chew through what we're in. we'll tear this place apart we'll piss inside your heart. we'll hit you where you live. we'll get under the skin we'll tear this place apart, we'll piss inside your heart. we'll push, we'll shove, put smokes out on your rug we hit you where you live. we live under the skin. once in 40 seconds. done in 45. this is what we're reduced to just to stay alive. tonight we're coming back and we don't care who we hurt. we'll shovel by the mouthful till they're covered up with dirt. this is where we live. our favorite place to bleed. stitched in any closer we'd be sewed into the sleeve. still stuck to the skin. same place that we're in. i'm the guy who lives next door lines up cans and shoots at the floor. pictures of guns and girls under the bed. we don't care because, baby, we're all dead. baby, we're all still stuck to the skin. same place that we're in.
