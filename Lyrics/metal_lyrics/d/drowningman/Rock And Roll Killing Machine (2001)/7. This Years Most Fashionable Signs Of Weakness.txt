tell me can you see these tears in my eyes. are they cameras picking up the dying inside? needles last night did they stitch or did they stab.? as long as we look good it can't be all bad. don't say you love me with pins in your mouth. tell me i'm beautiful, its a beautiful lie. they'll take it in but they can't take it back. there's things that we say that are ugly as that. they'll take it in but they can't take it back. these hearts on the sleeves come straight off the rack. don't wear this out for anyone but me. don't look down no matter what you do, still can't face those fucking shoes. when we look in mirrors, this doesn't fit right. nothing looks good, this doesn't fit right. nothing looks good on me tonight. next time you tell me i'm beautiful I'll know its a lie. next time you say you love me lets hope it looks as good as it sounds.
