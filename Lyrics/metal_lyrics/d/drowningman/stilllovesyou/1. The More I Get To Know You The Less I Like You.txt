fuck you too. dead. can you feel it when the blood runs out? like it just did. white knuckles. can you feel it? fuck you too. fuck you dead. i said it for the record. said it and i turned away. i can hear these words in my ear. one last time in my ear. fuck you dead. cold. can you feel it when the blood runs out of you. white knuckles can you feel it and fuck you too. fuck you dead. i said it for the record. said it and i turned away. i can hear these words in my ear. and i can see you when you when you hold it and it slips away. and i can feel it when you hold it and it slips away. it's over now. one last time. goodbye.
