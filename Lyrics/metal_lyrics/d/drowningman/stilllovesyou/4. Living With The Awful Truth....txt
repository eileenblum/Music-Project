five weeks couldn't break me. couldn't cut through this skin. no matter how hard you tried. you still couldn't get in. i can't feel it. i can't taste it. you can't break me. five weeks couldn't break me. were chained to the wall. feet held to the fire. i couldn't feel it at all. i can't feel it. i can't taste it. you can't break me so fuck you. if it passes in air. just please don't recall. fill awkward silence with the sound of your voice and instead remember the color and every detail as it passes on the back of our li ds and rewinds as it's played on the walls. crashing down. make it stop. time that is spent thinking alone can kill you. use every channel to account for the flaws cover them up as best as you can. if you see me inside don't turn away you might like it as it's played on the walls crashing down. make it stop. the human body was not designed for any of this, i am demanding a full recall on all of these parts. (shallow breathing. i can hear you) we want answers but we're afraid to ask the question. just ask it
