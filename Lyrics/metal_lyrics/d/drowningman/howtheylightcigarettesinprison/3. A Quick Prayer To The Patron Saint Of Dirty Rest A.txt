Try to draw that day. Puts maps on a page. Anything to bring it back, moves it all away. Tell it like an accident. 100 in the shade. Banks are dripping sweat for me . They're calling out my name. Sing loud, say it away. Sing it like it's what you want or wear it like a scar. Sing loud, say it away. Baby had a gun, bullets in her other hand, to make it easy to find a place to hid all I know is that one of us wants to see the other die. Hang too tight. All I know is that one of us wants to see the other die. I also know that one of us wants to touch the other's insides. She's alright. It's anything you want. She's alright. Explain it away.
