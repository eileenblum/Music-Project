Try to stab me, motherfucker. You can't hit what you can't see. All these lights are blinding me. Let's go. Let's do it, you sack of shit. Try to kill me, motherfucker. You can't hit what you can't see. All these lights are blinding me. Hits like rocks only harder. Tried to drown in an inch of water. You can't hit me. You can't fucking touch me. Way up high, looking down. I can see almost everything. Say goodbye. This could be the last thing you ever see. Like rocks, like knives pushed in; thorn in my side. We're bending back the gates of hell to ride. They moved this city, walls, piece by piece. Every brick and nail laid at the gates of hell. The only thing they left us was this burnt out shell. Never coming back. Won't pass this way again. If I ever did, I'd kick your ass again.
