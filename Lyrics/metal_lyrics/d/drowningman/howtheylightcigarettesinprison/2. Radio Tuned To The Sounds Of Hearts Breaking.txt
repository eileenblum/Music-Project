I'm going to die if they play that song again. If they play it one more time I swear to god I'll die. Can't stand this situation. Change that fucking station. The signal that I need is a hundred miles away and I can't sleep. Eyes wide open and the radio's on. They can't reach me this far away, this late at night. The radio's against me, they just played that song again. It seems like somebody's happy when they try to make me cry and it works out. Why does your radio play songs that make me cry? Drive nails in. You'd better change that fucking station. Touch that dial now. Change that fucking station or you might get to watch me fucking die.
