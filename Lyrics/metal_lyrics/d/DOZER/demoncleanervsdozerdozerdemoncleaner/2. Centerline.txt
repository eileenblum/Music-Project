All around the sun
Going side to side
I'm on a power dream
Inside the fire
Woe
Can I think to see
Universe has said
In the rings of smoke
Can't see the damed
No
All around the sun
Heeding all that's down
Riding soul machine
Better make it work
Now
Leaking from the sea
What's burn'n down
Full on the hill
Makes a strong turn
All around the sun
Going side to side
I'm on a power dream
Inside the fire
Woe
Can I think to see
Universe has said
In the rings of smoke
Can't see the damed
Low
