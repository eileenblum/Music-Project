I can't control it,
You'll never notice,
What you can't see will never be in the open...
It's just a campaign
Of non-believers
They cannot wait until they're facing their master...

I cannot face it,
You'll never know this,
That I am faceless and in need of an anchor...
It's just a new strain
Underachievers
Are waiting for us by the true disaster...

What you try to say
When you are afraid
Is a choice you haven't got...
Once you start to pay
Fear will always stay
Then you know He'll never come...

I've always known that
You couldn't hold it
So what you feel is just a curse on the rising...
it's just a new stage
Of evolution
So now the Lord has fallen down to be broken...

But I will never know
Just what it really meant
As long as it is slow
I know I'm really spent
