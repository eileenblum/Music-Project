Somebody called and you're the servant.
Somebody called though not your name.
The table's turned now have you heard this,
You're gonna be the receiving end...

Your legs are numb, but you're still standing.
Your brain is dumb, but it's still clear.
And if you're tied up I'm still walking...
I'm really in though it's too weird...

I can't deny you all the pain,
It's such a long way,
Still such a long way...
I can't deny you all the shame,
It's such a long way,
Still such a long way...

I shove you down and you respect me.
I shove it down and you are fooled.
I lay the bait and you just swallow.
The blood is warm, the pride is bruised...

As you're kneeling down below my altar right before me,
Your knees got worn throughout the years...
If you think I'm done before it is all over you,
Try to get this past your ears!
