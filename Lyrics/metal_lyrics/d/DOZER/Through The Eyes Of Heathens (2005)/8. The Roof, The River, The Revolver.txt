The card up your sleeve is showing
They're calling your bluff
And now that you need to keep going
You sure have had enough
You're starting to feel a bit strange
Deranged is a plus
Cause when they get you at close range
No need to discuss!

The roof, the river, revolver...
The roof, the river, revolver...

And now it is getting darker
The evil sets in
Beware! Now the dead will haunt you
They know where you've been
Your kind will not last around here
It's perfectly clear
And if you come out high and mighty
You will not appear ...ever again

You're dead and you know it
You're dead and you know it
You're dead and you know it
You're dead and you know...
Know, know, know...
