So long, may you have a pleasant growth
Safe and sound, don't you try to keep them both
Cause everywhere you turn there is another side
So lonely, cause we keep each others hands in line...

Man of fire, sounds like ocean waves...
Man of fire, takes you to the grave...
You will know how it feels to get rid of all restraints...
Man of fire, he will cave you in, cave you in...

Belong, but that's not what you have done
Tied and bound, like you're lying under oath
Cause everywhere you turn there is another lie
So lonely, even though you've kept your hands in mine...
