This might make me strong,
I'll grow weak in the end.
Determined to wear me down
they cannot wait to begin.
I'm bound to badged and then planted again, oh no...

So why behave...
in civil ways...
Cause so much's at stake...
and you still can break...

Tide nor time tarrieth no Man,
The battle is won, but we have lost the war...
Beyond the shadows I crawl, 'neath the stench... of dying men...

From the eternal sea that he rises,
Creating armies on either shore,
Turning Man against his brother
'til Man exists no more... no more
