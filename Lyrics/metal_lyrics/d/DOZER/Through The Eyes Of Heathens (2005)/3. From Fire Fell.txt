Christ, you will know my name when you begin to die...
Blood, you will taste the blood coming from your mouth...

Slaves go hand in hand to suicide...
When the silence speaks the loudest word...
Have you never asked the question: why?
Maybe silence is the blind man's eyes...

Down, you get beaten down and never will you rise...
Cry, no you never cry, you let it pour inside...

Slave...
