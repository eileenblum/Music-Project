Die, yeah you will have to burn
Cry, and you will not be heard
And I will watch you hang below the sky...
Why, I am the burning flame
Lie, no I won't ease your pain
And I won't leave until I've burned the ground...

Before I have to go I'll tell the tide to flood you all
Before I take control I'll be reminded by you all
I'm the untold...

Die, no you will have to learn
Cry, no I won't go unheard
And I will watch you from a higher ground...
Why, you've reached the boiling point
Lie, no I won't ease the strain
And I won't leave until you all have drowned...
