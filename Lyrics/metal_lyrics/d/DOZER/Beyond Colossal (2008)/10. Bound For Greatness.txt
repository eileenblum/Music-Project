As dark as it is now, I feel much worse
Confined I'm in it, it is my curse
A turn for the better, what does this mean
Every day I get weaker, and so do you

And I will die, yeah, I will die
So I will die, and I have died for me

I'm bound for greatness, yeah that's what I'm told
But I cashed in a rain check, as good as gold
Confusion is over and I feel in bloom
I know where to go now, inside my tomb
