Why am I lonely
And my soul's not here no more
Try, yeah I do try
All I do is try and fail

Why the light of day
When it's gone comes the war

Whole, am I whole now
Is this true or shades of grey
Time is a true crime
And it's victims end up dead

Erebus driver - Take your rider
Two coins for eyes...
Fare is offered - Lead and copper
Two coins for eyes...

I'll stop this war by being no more
I won't go on, I won't live on...

Why am I lonely
And my souls not here no more
Time's wasted on me
And I won't hold out for more
