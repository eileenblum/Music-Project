I never wait for tomorrow
It always comes with the light
I can't be worried 'bout sorrow
A sadness that will not ignite

And you got a long way up
When you got controlled by fear

I cannot lay it behind me
It never leaves when it's bright
I can't be stuck in the moment
Amber alerts me in time

I'll never wait for tomorrow
It always comes after night
I hope that you see what I see
But I will not put up a fight
