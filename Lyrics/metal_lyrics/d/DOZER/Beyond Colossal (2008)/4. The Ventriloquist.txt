So you gave your life long before your time, it had not yet begun
I need no hand in mine, and the season's passing by too fast for us

As long as I'll be free internally
As long as I will live forever long

So cold I'm watching you, and the waves take out your fear into the sun
I bleed from time to time, now the rain is pouring down on everyone
