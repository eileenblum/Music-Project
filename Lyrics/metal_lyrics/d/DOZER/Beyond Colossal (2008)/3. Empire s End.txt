Well, I don't know what you've been missing
you've discovered lies
Brush it off inhale your anger and you will only find
I am so tired I still believe...
I don't know why all this fury's coming out tonight
No one's keeping it inside so I will let it out
I am so tired I still believe...

I am the seasons of the North
I am the demon from below
I am the dying and the grief
I am sustained by your relief...

I control the rage you have for everyone alike
I'll unleash it you can't tame the wind I have in mind
I am so tired I still believe...
Death is coming nearer I can feel the demon's out
I have fooled you all and I now you'll pay the highest price
I am so tired I still believe...

Bright borealis - Sounding of horns
March of the wanderers - Breaking of morn
Circles of aeons - Empire's end
Time has no malice - Smoke on the wind
