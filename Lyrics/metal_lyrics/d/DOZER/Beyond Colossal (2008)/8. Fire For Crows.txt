What have you done when it's clearly not so
Destroying it all what was sacred before
It dies, oh you know it dies
Cause I'm overloaded with all that's been said

Loath me - Harm me
Arms out - Reach out

What I've become here no one can like
I will be blind and safe in my mind
All you can do is tell all your friends
And I will enjoy the view ...when it's you

What has begun has become your motto
Enjoyed everything that was hatred before
It dies, oh you know it dies
Cause I am mistrusting with all that I am fed
