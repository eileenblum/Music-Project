From the mountain into the sea
We're burning down flames again

Inside the falcon
Tomorrow will be gone

Out of the sea up on the mountain
Let the fires keep you worm a while

Inside the falcon
Tomorrow will be gone
Inside the falcon
Tomorrow will be gone

Inside the falcon
Tomorrow will be gone
Inside the falcon
Tomorrow will be gone
