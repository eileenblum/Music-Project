Some men walk on water,
and some run on wine,
I know thatâs what youâve heardâ¦
Itâs like that same olâ song,
that is never done,
and itâs all repeatsâ¦

Though - you know thereâs nothing thereâ¦ [x2]

You bring the Lord to shame,
in his finest hour,
And I donât have a doubtâ¦
You know it wonât take long,
âtill you go to sleep,
and then your nightmare beginsâ¦

Though - you know thereâs nothing thereâ¦ [x2]

Well I damn you straight to hellâ¦
You are worse than they all say that you are,
itâs a lost caseâ¦
Well I damn you straight awayâ¦
What is done you canât just undo now,
and never againâ¦

Youâre just as sick as him,
itâs a goddamn shame,
and we all had hopeâ¦
Yeah I am the man,
that runs on casteroil,
thatâs why I never stopâ¦

Though - you know thereâs nothing thereâ¦ [x2]

Well I damn you straight to hellâ¦
You are worse than they all say that you are,
itâs a lost caseâ¦
Well I damn you straight awayâ¦
What is done you canât just undo now,
and never againâ¦
