Reborn as the sun,
a shooting star wonât take you backâ¦
Millions of years ahead,
somewhere âtween now and goneâ¦

Can you hear it call ?
Can you see at all ?

He is the son of evil,
the one that hides in the shadowsâ¦
You better watch your back now,
âcause the hills have eyes,
And now your time has comeâ¦

Long gone now itâs back,
back from the life from beyondâ¦
Breathing electric light,
nothing can save you nowâ¦

Can you hear it call?
Can you see at all?

He is the son of evil,
the one that hides in the shadowsâ¦
You better watch your back now,
âcause the hills have eyes,
And now your time has comeâ¦

He is the son of evil,
the one that hides in the shadowsâ¦
You better watch your back now,
âcause the hills have eyes,
And now your time has comeâ¦
