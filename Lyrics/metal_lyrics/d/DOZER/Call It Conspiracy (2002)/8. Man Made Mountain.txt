Shut up and listen up closely,
my patienceâs running out soonâ¦
Collapsing into a ruin,
itâs goinâ up in smokeâ¦
You wonât be draging your feet now,
exploding out of this placeâ¦
And going of like a needleâ¦

And now the hunger is growing,
with the greatest of easeâ¦
There is no victim to dwell on,
âcause you all vanished in flamesâ¦
Youâre staring into a crystal,
like you would never mindâ¦
And donât you think that is odd nowâ¦

Youâre trying to hide,
well you should try to get awayâ¦
And you cannot decide,
âcause itâs like everyoneâs the sameâ¦

You sure that you understand it?
Or is it torture you want?
So youâve been chasing a dragon,
I never knew it was thereâ¦
And when you scream like a shotgun,
the sky is waiting to healâ¦
The rain is pouring down on meâ¦

Youâre trying to hide,
well you should try to get awayâ¦
And you cannot decide,
âcause itâs like everyoneâs the sameâ¦

Shut up and listen up closely,
And wipe that grin from your faceâ¦
You wonât be saying a word now,
Cause youâre all making me sickâ¦
