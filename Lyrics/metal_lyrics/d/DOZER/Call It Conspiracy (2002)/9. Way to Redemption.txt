Reminds me of a lizard,
now it is the milkywayâ¦
And like the cobra strikes,
shed some dirt as you would sayâ¦

There is no use to even tryâ¦tryâ¦
The judgement taken by surpriseâ¦surpriseâ¦

A whirlwind scattered âcross,
abuse is never acting fairâ¦
Redemption scratched and lost,
like youâd never understandâ¦

There is no use to even tryâ¦tryâ¦
The judgement taken by surpriseâ¦surpriseâ¦

And now the fireâs spreading,
all you gotta do is sayâ¦
But your mouthâs got a million tongues,
and the laughter remainsâ¦
We hunted down your magic,
like a missile in itâs primeâ¦
And they say that nothingâs won,
well we canât complainâ¦

Pull out your gun thatâs how,
that right your trying to defendâ¦
The scent is shipped around,
the deed is better than the blameâ¦

There is no use to even tryâ¦tryâ¦
The judgement taken by surpriseâ¦surpriseâ¦

And now the fireâs spreading,
all you gotta do is sayâ¦
But your mouthâs got a million tongues,
and the laughter remainsâ¦
We hunted down your magic,
like a missile in itâs primeâ¦
And they say that nothingâs won,
well we canât complainâ¦
