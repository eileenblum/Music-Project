Itâs a fact,
It is written down all over you and themâ¦
And how long,
Could you wait it out until theyâre back againâ¦
Be afraid,
Donât let you guard down now it shouldâve stayedâ¦
Like you know,
Youâll break down now just like youâve done beforeâ¦

This time Iâll face it heading onâ¦
And I will never let it goâ¦

Maybe so,
Youâll drop everything and run like youâve never knownâ¦
All along,
You never knew a single goddamn thingâ¦
Youâll find out,
Itâs to late for now youâll find it all out soonâ¦
It is true,
There are times when things just never makes any senseâ¦

This time Iâll face it heading onâ¦
And I will never let it goâ¦
This time Iâll face it heading onâ¦
And Iâm not scared of anyoneâ¦

You slow it up,
itâs boringâ¦
It wonât be long,
itâs overâ¦
What made you follow us despiteâ¦
You get the hell,
out of hereâ¦
Canât say I blame you,
for itâ¦
youâll know that Iâm the chosen oneâ¦
