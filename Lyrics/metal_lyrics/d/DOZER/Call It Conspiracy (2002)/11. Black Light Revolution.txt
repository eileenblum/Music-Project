I cannot see an end,
The cycleâs neverending now.
Just like a pilotflame,
âcause all the worst is yet to come.

â¦and I can see it clear.
â¦itâs all your hate, I fear.
â¦you havenât reached the light.

Just like a nuclear war,
the blacklight taken itâs toll.
Just like a silent freefall,
the revolution will come.

I hope you sleep at night,
Your habitâs growing from now on,
As far as I can see,
Youâll never leave the throne alone.

â¦now I can see it clear.
â¦itâs all your hate, I fear.
â¦youâll never reach the light.

Just like a nuclear war,
the blacklight taken itâs toll.
Just like a silent freefall,
the revolution will come.

Your life getâs shorter by the hourâ¦
I spread my wings on which Iâve flownâ¦
Your life was hanging by a threadâ¦
And then you blew it on your ownâ¦
â¦â¦â¦whoooooooooooâ¦â¦â¦
