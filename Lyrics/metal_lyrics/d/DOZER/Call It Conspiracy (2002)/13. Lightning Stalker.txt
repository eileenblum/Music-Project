Your hands are free,
so tiredly they try to grab this neck of mine.
And you sail across the earth,
youâve always knownâ¦

And after all,
the time comes crawling, turns you all into the dust,
that is found in all your arms
itâs never grownâ¦
And in fair amounts you come,
for what itâs worthâ¦

The search goes on,
the lightning stalker strolls the earth then takes a bow.
But he never settles down,
Wonât wait, wonât goâ¦

And through the cries,
The butterfly is waiting for that last goodbye.
And before it all is through,
it all is doneâ¦
Well another oneâs let down,
you shouldâve knownâ¦

And although you couldnât cope,
it all is solvedâ¦
And you speak the only word,
youâve ever knownâ¦
youâve ever knownâ¦
youâve ever known â youâve ever knownâ¦
youâve ever known â youâve ever knownâ¦
