Send me off on a long trip nowhere,
on a path that we donât knowâ¦
By all means we escaped the deep end,
itâs the root of all evilâ¦
Seeking wisdom that grows like fire,
burning down the remains of youâ¦
You may call it amusing sometimes,
inviting us to go nowhereâ¦

Itâs an orbit âround your soul,
Itâs good grace will keep you warm,
As the oceans always knew,
You can come along,
You can come along,
You can come alongâ¦

Like a dark cloud upon a bright sky,
it will turn your eyes openâ¦
Look into the void of your mind,
cannot wait to become youâ¦
You have come along on this voyage,
thereâs no doubt of a whitewashâ¦
See you later around the vortex,
across the vertigoriverâ¦

Itâs an orbit âround your soul,
Itâs good grace will keep you warm,
As the oceans always knewâ¦

Would you take us along, right into the blindnessâ¦
But there is no response, no reaching out thereâ¦
Yeah we know it is wrong, it has torn us to piecesâ¦
But Iâm still on the way, itâs surprices that kills meâ¦

Itâs an orbit âround your soul,
Itâs good grace will keep you warm,
As the oceans always knewâ¦
you can come alongâ¦
