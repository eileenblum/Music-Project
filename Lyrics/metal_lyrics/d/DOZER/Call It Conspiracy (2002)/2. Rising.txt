I see you strapping on your velvet smile behind me,
although you drown in innocenceâ¦
Go on and swallow down my breath, the one that kills you,
the sun goes down behind you eyesâ¦
Come back to see, itâs always been the same shit,
climbing right up before it fallsâ¦
Come back to see, itâs always been the same deal,
I cannot wait to see you fallâ¦

Rising - You knock me off my feet again, yeah,
I wonât give up until your offâ¦
Rising - You knocked me off my feet today, yeah,
I wonât give up before your doneâ¦

I see just lies behind the truth you think you tell me,
under your breath there flows a smileâ¦
For quite a while the darkness spread it was amazing,
and getting better all the timeâ¦
Come back in greed, I bet you want the same shit,
itâs climbing up right as we speakâ¦
Come back I said, I think youâll get the same deal,
I kick you down to see you fallâ¦

Rising - You knock me off my feet again, yeah,
I wonât give up until your offâ¦
Rising - You knocked me off my feet today, yeah,
I wonât give up before your doneâ¦

Rising - You knock me off my feet again, yeah,
I wonât give up until your offâ¦
Rising - You knocked me off my feet today, yeah,
I wonât give up before your doneâ¦
I wonât give up before your doneâ¦
I wonât give up before your doneâ¦
