When all the wrongs have all been turned to rightsâ¦
Then all we have to do is wait it outâ¦
And when I lay down on my bed of nailsâ¦
I know Iâll rest until Iâm finally deadâ¦

Spirit-Fury-Fireâ¦
Spirit-Fury-Fireâ¦

The crown youâre wearing cannot stay the same,
donât be surprised itâs shiveringâ¦
Youâre disappearing, Iâm afraid itâs true,
yeah, all your hate, well it getâs brighter every dayâ¦

I think thereâs nothing left of me to fadeâ¦
I understand now that you feel the sameâ¦
The steam is blowing at me and I drownâ¦
Thatâs when I knew that they were never farâ¦

Spirit-Fury-Fireâ¦
Spirit-Fury-Fireâ¦

The crown youâre wearing cannot stay the same,
donât be surprised itâs shiveringâ¦
Youâre disappearing, Iâm afraid itâs true,
yeah, all your hate, well it getâs brighter every dayâ¦

Spirit-Fury-Fireâ¦ [x4]

I know Iâll sleep just like an infant childâ¦
Yeah, I can see it when I lieâ¦
And all the voices in this dream I hearâ¦
Theyâll all get quiet pretty soonâ¦

The crown youâre wearing cannot stay the same,
donât be surprised itâs shiveringâ¦
Youâre disappearing, Iâm afraid itâs true,
yeah, all your hate, well it getâs brighter every dayâ¦
