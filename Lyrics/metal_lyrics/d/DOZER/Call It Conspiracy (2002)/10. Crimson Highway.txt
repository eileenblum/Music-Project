My baby - sheâs gonna make hell freezinâ,
sheâs got diamond eyesâ¦
Queen of the darker side, youâll die kneeling,
face down in the mudâ¦

She is cominâ â She is your bleeding heartâ¦
She is cominâ â And Iâm her brand new Godâ¦

I am the demon in her way, ainât no use to runâ¦
I am the one that sets her freeâ¦

My baby â sheâs gonna make you come crawling,
crawling back for moreâ¦
Pure evilâs in her blood, âcause sheâs a sweet thing,
you have sold your soulâ¦

She is cominâ â She is your bleeding heartâ¦
She is cominâ â And Iâm her brand new Godâ¦

I am the demon in her way,
ainât no use to runâ¦
I am the one that sets her freeâ¦
I am the demon in her way,
ainât no use to hideâ¦
I am the one that can see herâ¦
