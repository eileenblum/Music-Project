Can you feel the ride,
From here to nowhere in no time at all,
Burning again?
Smoke and dust behind us fall.

You can fly it down again,
It means nothing to me.
You can fly it down all the way,
It means nothing to me.

Feels like I'm flipping aside,
Feels like I'm falling behind,
It's time to go back again. [2x]

Let's feel the ride going sideways to the far side of you.
I've done it my way and now I don't know what to do.

Let's reach for the sun
And you know you can't come along.
Deep down inside,
Follow the lightning that fuck up you all.

You can fly it down again,
It means nothing to me.
You can fly it down all the way,
It means nothing to me.

Feels like I'm flipping aside,
Feels like I'm falling behind,
It's time to go back again. [2x]

Let's feel the ride going sideways to the far side of you.
I've done it my way and now I don't know what to do.

I've done it my way, yeah.
