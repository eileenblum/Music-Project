Built to be launched
Made to destroy
Created for the final blitz

Born warhead
With hate and uranium fed
Heavier than lead

Heat-seeking
Death-reeking
Launched from its socket is this rocket

Killing mode
Triggered and with a fatal load
I will explode

I carry armageddon

Soon to erase
Nuke and delete
I'm ready for the total blitz

I am warborn and
I am airborne
to bring death where I strike I have sworn

Born warhead
With hate and uranium fed
Heavier than lead

I'm the courier of death

Built to be launched
Made to destroy
Created for the final blitz

I am warborn and
I am airborne
to bring death where I strike I have sworn
I am warborn and
I am airborne
my target in pieces will be torn

I am warborn
I am airborne
