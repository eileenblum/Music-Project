Now our calm nature has changed
as one of us has died
Yet the death is unrevenged
on vengeance wings we ride
...all your beggings denied
Bloodscent is our flawless guide

We will march and invade
with our death parade

We are armed in steel &amp; leather
Dressed to kill and punish tar &amp; feather

Spear-armed, unfearharmed
we will detonate
and devastate
every state
with rage we storm
as we have formed a rigid -
a rigid death brigade

We are the blood brigade
of warriors self-made
we will march and we will invade

Spear-armed, unfearharmed
we will detonate
and devastate
with our death brigade

Charge !

Now our calm nature has changed

Spear-armed, unfearharmed

with our death brigade

We are the blood brigade
of warriors self-made
we will march and we will invade
We are the blood brigade
of solid steel we're made
we will march with our death parade
