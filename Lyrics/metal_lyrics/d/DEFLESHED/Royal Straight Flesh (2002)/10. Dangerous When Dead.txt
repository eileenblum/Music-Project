The larger the island of knowledge
the longer is the shoreline of wonder

Dangerous when dead
Fatal when misled
If hopelessness takes place instead, then
Dreams are dangerous when dead

All the carnal beauty is but skin deep
In spite of the fact that grace comes not dirt cheap
All hail the death of a sailor
Cause nothing beats a try but a failure
Now it's time to stand and to wake up
and realize I've been drinking from a broken cup

Never surrender or beat the retreat...beat the retreat
Snatch victory from the jaws of defeat

If you were born to be shot, you'll never drown
allthough it means not that you won't go down
It suddenly have come to my senses
It's time to batten up my defenses

Never surrender or beat the retreat...beat the retreat
Snatch victory from the jaws of defeat

All the carnal beauty is but skin deep
In spite of the fact that grace comes not dirt cheap

Jewels are few
and far between
but they're not unseen

If you were born to be shot, you'll never drown
allthough it means not that you won't go down
It suddenly have come to my senses
It's time to batten up my defenses

Never surrender or beat the retreat...beat the retreat
Snatch victory from the jaws of defeat

Jewels are few
and far between
but they're not unseen

The larger the island of knowledge
the longer is the shoreline of wonder

Dangerous when dead
When hopelessness comes instead
Dangerous when dead
Fatal are dreams when they are dead
