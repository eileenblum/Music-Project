Brakefailure !!!

Motorized
Hypnotized
Re-energized
I rapidly accelerate,
exaggerate...

On burning wheels
Tuned up ruthlessly and founded in
solid steel

Missiled up when the pedal is pounded
Head over heels

Feeling the heat from underneath the seat
when the top speed is reached and beyond

Brakefailure !!!

Loosing the sight when approaching a light
too bright I'm forced to abruptly interrupt
Petrefied when realizing I'll collide
In neckbreaking speed on the warninglight I read

Brakefailure !!!

Motorized
Hypnotized
Re-energized
I rapidly accelerate,
exaggerate...

Now as the end is near
Put in the highest gear

Fear can not stop me now
I will die anyhow
