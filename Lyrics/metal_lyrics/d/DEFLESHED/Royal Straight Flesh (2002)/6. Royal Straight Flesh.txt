Proud as the dawn and as the sunset brave
For combat our immortality we gave
No remorses, no step aside
If wishes were horses then beggars would ride

Dying is more precious than gold
We know we will never grow old
Crusader
Invader 
No death can wait 'til later
We will never fall on our swords
to fail our sanguinary lord...
...blindfolded and we're made of

Royal, straight flesh, royal
to our king and queen we're loyal
Royal, straight flesh, royal
To their bloodthirst we are loyal

Fullbody-armoured and powered by our king
With pride and with lust our axes we will swing
No remorses no step aside
If wishes were horses then beggars would ride

Dying is more precious than gold
Now we know that we have been sold

Proud as the dawn and as the sunset brave
For combat our immortality we gave
No remorses, no step aside
If wishes were horses then beggars would ride

Royal, straight flesh, royal
to our king and queen we're loyal
Royal, straight flesh, royal
To their bloodthirst we are loyal
