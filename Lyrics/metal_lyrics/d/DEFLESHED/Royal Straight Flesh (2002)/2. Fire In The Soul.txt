Led by a tearing feeling
that grows internally
like the itching of healing rips inside of me

It's burning holes
It is the fire in my soul
Burning holes
I am the firesoul

My strenghts exceeds compared when younger
I'm driven by abnormal hunger -
extreme thirst
Eventhough it feels like if I'll burst
I'm spawned and I am cursed

With powers superhuman
constantly within grow
I am reborn, now few can resist my inner glow

It's burning holes
It is the fire in my soul

My strenghts exceeds compared when younger
I'm driven by abnormal hunger -
extreme thirst
Eventhough it feels like if I'll burst
I'm spawned and I am cursed

Led by a tearing feeling
that grows internally
like the itching of healing rips inside of me

It's burning holes
It is the fire in my soul
Burning holes
I am the firesoul
