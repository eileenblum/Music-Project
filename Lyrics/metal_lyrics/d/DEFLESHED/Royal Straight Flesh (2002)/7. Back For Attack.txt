Do not stand at my grave and weep
I'm not there, I do not sleep
I'm the thousand winds that blow
I'm the frozen blood on snow

I'm wherever there's a tragedy
I strike without sympathy

I'm back
In black and back on track
I'm back for the attack

Easily forgotten
When abscent never missed
But now my flesh is rotten
Yet do I exist, I exist...I exist !!!

I am back to revenge life
With human race I am at strife
I'm the unluck that surrounds you
and the bitter irony too

Don't stand at my grave and cry
I'm not there, I did not die

I'm back
In black and back on track
I'm back for the attack

Easily forgotten
When abscent never missed
But now my flesh is rotten
Yet do I exist

I'm back
In black and back on track
I'm back for the attack

Attack !!!
