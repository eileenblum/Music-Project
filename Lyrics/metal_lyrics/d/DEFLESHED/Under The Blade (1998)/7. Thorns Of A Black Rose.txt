I want to breath you, feed you, seed you 
Hold you, unfold you, grow old with you, 
I need to see you, be you, me &amp; you... 

That's all I want
That's all I need 

I'd like to fly you, spy you, die with you 
Wear you, dare you, take care of you 
I think of meeting you, greeting you, eating you 
Hate you... but all I do is wait for you 

That's all I'd like 
That's all I think 

I've ripped myself on the thorns of a black rose
Lost my will - that's the way things goes 

I dream of pouring you, scoring you, 
getting more of you 
And to find you, blind you, be kind to you
I'd love to dress you, stress you, caress you 
Miss you, skiss you...kiss you... 

I'd love to hate you 
but what is there to do 
when I only hate to love you?
