I have seen the clouds from above 
and travelled between stars 
I've seed them fall in love 
I've walked the moons of mars 

The universe is nothing new 
The things unknown to me are few 
I've seen the birth of our sun 
and beed there when all life begun 

But I cannot understand 
when my life will end? 

I have sailed the seven seas
and did it very well 
Created summer breeze 
I thought you'd like the smell

But I cannot understand 
when my life will end?
