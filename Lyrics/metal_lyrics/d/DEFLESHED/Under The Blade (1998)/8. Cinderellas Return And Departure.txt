It's the return of beauty &amp; pain 
a torture attack 
It's the return of sunshine &amp; rain 
The angel of darkness is back 

Frustration wanted 
Sanity is haunted 

This is the hosting of peace &amp; of war 
a false - sounding law 
This is the haunting of virgins &amp; whores 
I'm in their claws 

Gone together with the sun
was it something I have done? 

It's the departure of fire &amp; ice
a fatal retrett 
It's the departure of truth &amp; of lies 
my welcome I regrett

Frustration wanted 
Sanity is haunted 

It was the return of beauty &amp; pain
a torture attack 
It was the return of sunshine &amp; rain 
The angel of darkness was back 

Gone together with the sun
was it something I have done? 
Ask myself if this is good 
If I only understood...
