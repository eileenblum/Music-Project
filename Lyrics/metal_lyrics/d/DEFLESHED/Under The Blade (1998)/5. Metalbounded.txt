Sword by the blade of metal 
Steel runs my veins forever 

We are lords of this mighty ground 
That's because of our metalbound
Forever and ever again 
This time is never to end 
Metal our blood contains 

United we are standing 
Guard our way
Our might is expanding 
We came to stay 

Sword by the blade of metal 
Steel runs my veins forever 

Come on... 

United we are standing 
Guard our way
Our might is expanding 
We came to stay 

We are lords of this mighty ground 
That's because of our metalbound
Forever and ever again 
This time is never to end 
Metal our blood contains
