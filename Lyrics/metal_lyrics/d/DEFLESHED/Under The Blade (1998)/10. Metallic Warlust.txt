This is the end of a peaceful season 
Violence has risen without reason 

Metallic warlust 
Metallic whorelust

Beauty is no more, 
Loving has turned to war 
We are here to score 

Metallic warlust 
Metallic whorelust

It's the dawn of loving age 
Controlled by enormous rage 
It's the dawn of a loving age

Metallic warlust 

No laws, no compromising 
As our metalattack is rising 

Beauty is no more, 
Loving has turned to war 
We are here to score!
