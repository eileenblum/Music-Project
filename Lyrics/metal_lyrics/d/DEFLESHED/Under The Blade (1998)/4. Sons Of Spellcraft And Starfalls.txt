We sons of spellcraft and starfalls 
It's up to us to destroy the halls 
of enemies 

Our spellcraft we release
and they'll decease 
-our enemies 

We set the starrain free 
and they'll see 
-their death we'll be 

The sword is our spellcraft 
The blade of that means pain
And our arrows are the starfalls 
with which we strike again and again 

Stronger than all magic 
is the blood that runs our veins 
Attack us with wicthery
it hurts like if it rains, yes it rains 

We sons of power and lightning
For us is no thing to frightening 

Our spellcraft we release 
and they'll decease 
-our enemies 

We set the starrain free 
and they'll see 
-their death we'll be 

Try us with your voodoo 
and you'll suffer from your deeds 
All the things that you do
makes us stand and watch you bleed -yes you'll bleed
