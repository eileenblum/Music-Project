Entering my yesterdays 
Travel through timespace 
In order to escape from today 

Run from misery &amp; hate
I can hardly wait 
in my past I will always stay 

I will always stay... 

Despise tomorrow 
which brings me sorrow 
I wish to turn back the years and the tears 

Entering my yesterdays 
Turning back the time 
my peace i want to find

Entering my yesterdays 
Would you be so kind
to leave me with my mind 

Despise tomorrow
which brings me sorrow 
I should have said this yesterday, well anyway...
