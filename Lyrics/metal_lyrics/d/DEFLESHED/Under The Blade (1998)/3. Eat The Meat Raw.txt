It's like a garden with one flower 
and a man feeding it power 
A symbiosis they welcome and greet 
growing stronger every time they meet 
It's like a river ending in a sea
(guess that river is me) 
A time will come when water must out 
Lack of need is what it's all about 

This is the way I see you 
but then I guess you don't want me too 
But after all, what can I do? 
When I think for once, my love is true 

I...I could die for you, if I only knew 
that you would remember me too 

Trapped between fear and desire 
A thousand internal wars 
You are the wood feeding my fire
am I the water on yours? 

This is the way I see you
but then I guess you don't want me too 
But after all, what can I do? 
When I think for once, my love is true 

I...I could die for you, if I only knew 
that you would remember me too 

Eating the meat raw 
on my heart you gnaw 
Living from my tears 

You're eating my meat raw
through my soul you saw 
Living from my tears
