Guess this star was meant to be 
as it was my call 
But what really bothers me 
it seem so small 

Is that the reason why 
it's done with charm? 
Then all this is a lie 
to cause me harm 
But when it comes to pain 
I let it drain 
And with my blood I spell 
farewell to the flesh 

That's another return, another loss 
All the feelings I burn, and all that was 

Farewell to the flesh-tearing it up at daytime 
And farewell to the rest-burning it down at night 

That's another return another loss 
All the feelings I burn, and all that was 

As I am embraced by the universe 
I think of things I could do reverse 

Is this the final end 
of all that was? 
I cannot comprehend 
The size of my loss 

Farewell to the flesh- tearing it up at daytime 
And farewell to the rest- burning it down at night 

That's another return, another loss 
All the feelings I burn, and all that was
