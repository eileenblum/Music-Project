Under the blade, under the blade 
Starting to fade - under the blade 
Becoming my maid - under the blade 

I can never conquer your name
and you will never be the same 
This time you're loosing the game 

See the blade from under 
Waiting for the thunder 
It takes you away from here 

Dare to duell the guillotine 
the sharpest you have seen 
It helps you end your fear 

I act in hopelessness 
due to the fact you are sorrowless 

Under the blade, under the blade 
Starting to fade - under the blade
Becoming my maid - under the blade 
Under the blade - under the blade 
Starting to fade - under the blade 
You're gonna get laid - under the blade 

I can never conquer your name
and you will never be the same
This time you're loosing the game
