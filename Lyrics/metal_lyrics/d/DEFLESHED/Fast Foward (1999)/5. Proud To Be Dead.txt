Here at the end of the grave 
Like a premature sleep 
the result of the brave 

Proud to be Dead 

We'll search through infinity 
and revenge with our trinity 
With the power of a million horses 
We are the mightiest of forces 

Proud to be Dead 

Solid like a group of hundred men 
They'll seem like only ten 
When we're back for them again 

Now our death-tour begins 
we'll bring back the head 
of the comittor of the sins 
A feeling of akward self-esteem 
Our promise we'll redeem 
how unstable that may seem 

Proud to be Dead 

We've came to pay respect 
your death we will revenge 
where you lay I suspect 
That you'll be

Proud to be Dead
