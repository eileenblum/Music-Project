Hesitate 
You'll figure out how 
but that's to late 
Cause you're close to death now 

Rise without shining 
Freedom forces one to chaos 
and these are no good combining 
There's no use to excuse 

Suffering upon the pyre 
And you are wilder 
wilder than fire 

Wilder than fire 
Raw energy is what I require 

Wilder than fire 
Raw energy is what I require 
Wilder than fire 
Essence of speed is what I admire 

You suffocate 
and feel the tension 
It's all to late 'cause 
there's no redemtion
