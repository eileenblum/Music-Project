I had this imagine dream 
but nothing's what it seem 
so I put it out of my mind 

I am the iron 
and she's the maiden 

Sence for reality start fade 
I'm hooked up with this maid 
is this fact or is it fiction 

Or a deadly prediction 
which I hail 
To the fact I am male 
a life-long conviction 

I'm the iron 
and she's the maiden 

I seek 
and the seeker will find 
and by the end of this week 
I'll start to rewind 
Take it all from the start 
I'm nothing close to the mundane 
It is more like an art 
Eventhough I'll go insane
