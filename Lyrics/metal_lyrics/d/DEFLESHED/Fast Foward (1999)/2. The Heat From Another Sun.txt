Ahh...it's a combination 
of rights and wrongs 
and I feel at some occations 
I was gone to long 

Like loneliness 
is feeding hopelessness 
The silent laws 
are broken by it's cause 

Feel the heat from another sun 
The journey has begun 
but there is a choice to be done 

Take the fall 
if it's a fall at all 
Some kind of violation 
that is turning to sensation
