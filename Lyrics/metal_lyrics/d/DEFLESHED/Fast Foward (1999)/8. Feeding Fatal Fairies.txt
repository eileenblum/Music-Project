Fate is to be found somewhere 
and I am halfway there 
If that is all for sure - there is no cure 

And if I'm diehard to the core 
Then will I live forever more 
These are things that have occured 
that's at leat what I have heard 

Time is spreading with the light 
rapidly to fight 
If that is all for sure - we are no more 

Life-lines starting to hitch 
And I know what they mean by the pitch 

I'm feeding fatal fairies 
And I'll take what that carries 

And if I'm diehard to the core 
Then will I live forever more 
These are things that I have heard 
that's at least what may occure 

Oh, it's basically a strategy 
to practise death 
and distributing tradegy
