Armed to the teeth with iron and pride 
we will attack if they don't 
Our troops will collide there's nowhere to hide 
as we move closer to the front 

Confrontate, mutilate 
We'll make them feel like feeble fools 
We'll hunt their heads until all are dead 
then we'll see how's the right to rule 

I stormload my veins with fury 

Fast, fast, fast forward 
Fast, fast 
Fast forward to the front 

There's no future for our enemies 
'cause in the end they'll all decease 
while our powers will increase
