I come 
to see them cum 
While crawling the mud 
and snowballing blood 

Imaginations I design 
A consitution divine 
close to prostitution 

They come in two 
I know they'll do, 'cause I've asked them to 
Join me for a coin 

Imaginations I design 
It's like a constitution 
of memories divine 

And then at last 
it's going fast 

Take it in the mouth 
give it to the next 
the blood is running south 
being over-sexed 

When I intrude, am I being rude ? 
But to be nice is what I despise
