Get in control, I load my soul 
That's a fatal need 
getting high on hyper-speed 
Obviously drifting away 
like today was tomorrow yesterday 

Getting myself in motion 
it's boiling in my veins 
Like a high-octanic lotion 
Which in my body rains 

Returning with enormous power 
The flesh is mine to devour 

Forced to be wild like fire 
as the ambitions are getting higher 

Crushing with a beat 
more solid than concrete 
The rage within me boil 
burning like black oil 

Is this the return of the flesh 
as we know it ? 
The return of the flesh
