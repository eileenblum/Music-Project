Soon to race 
to take it to the top 
and there is no point to stop 
while driving the speedways 

I load up my four-wheeled jewel 
with a high-powered kind of fuel 

Speeding the ways with hate and sin 
There is no thing that can stop me to win 
Speeding the ways with wheels of hate 
There is no thing that can make me wait 

My appetite for speed has been woken 
and speedlimits are to be broken 

No more bored 
You'll see the laws of which 
I have stepped on and ignored 
cause I am the he-bitch
