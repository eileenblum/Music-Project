Impressed by the brightness one starts to wonder 
if that's the lightning, how loud is the thunder ? 

Oh, mighty powers - refill me 
The best of warriors I will be 

Go my way 
Come to me and stay 

Lightning strikes 
Not twice but thrice 
Oh... 
And we'll do likewise 

I feel the power 
Extended forces 
from thunding sources 
Victory hour 

Impressed by the loadness one starts to wonder 
How is my power if this is the thunder ? 

Lightning strikes 
Once, not twice but thrice
