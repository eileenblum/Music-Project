[music &amp; lyrics c by DEFLESHED 1995]

In my sleep
In my dreams
I am temporary free from my life...
So I weep
And I creep into adapted worlds
...I create...
I probably join the bears winter sleep
If possible I'd like some aspirin
As winters' grave is near and it's kind of deep
I much rather fall into dreams...
...I create...
...as darkness appears
and frost attacks sets in
I live where I can slay around
Where I dig massive graves...
Abrah Kadavrah
I wanna reach out and stab ya
