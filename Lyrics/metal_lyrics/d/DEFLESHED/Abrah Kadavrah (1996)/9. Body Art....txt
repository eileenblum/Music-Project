[music &amp; lyrics c by DEFLESHED 1995]

I killed a police-wife with a rusty knife
Then cut through sinews and bloodways
Must I continue ?
It's a shame this art is forgotten
I'm collecting all that is rotten
I love go killing, it's rather thrilling
So happy when I find a jelly warm piece of mind
Sometimes I wanna see them choking
I'll be damned if you think I'm joking
I've ripped some eyes
I've stripped the thice, I'm not telling lies
Down at the bay I throw them away
Practicing death, I've messed around
As I love to be, it strengthens me
Put some in the ground
'cause when it's hot it sooner rot
I drilled a hole there too
To make the sun shine through
(and making love there too)
I master high-tech death
And to drink their breaths
Taking LSD, it's helping me to see
As I slayed that sweet Mary
Call it robbery
Gazing at the sky...wowing
When I'm flying high...raving
I killed a police-wife with a rusty knife
It could have been you
Must I continue ?
