[music &amp; lyrics c by DEFLESHED 1995]

I hang'em high
And watch them die
A collection of ghosts
Me be their host
They will forever remain in my domain
And I guarantee they won't be free
Cleopatra asked me which way
I told her she's welcome to stay
I have this thing with corpses
Communicate
Devastate
I have this thing with corpses
Maculate
Ruminate
Cleopatra told me today
Them XTC's making me gray
A gambrel so chic
Ask me how thick and sick it is
Familiar with pain, entertain
I'm telling you this...
Now as your body will collapse
And I can see it from above
That your organs will perhaps
Land on the people that you love
...score...gore...
I hear people shout and scream
Due to your brains comes out like cream
Cleopatra kissed me goodnight
The walls comes in liquid and light
I have this thing with corpses
Communicate
Devastate
I have this thing with corpses
Maculate 
Ruminate
