[music &amp; lyrics c by DEFLESHED 1995]

"Hello charming, we go Spain...
and land of joy where it seldom rains"
I bring this Heather
And clothes of leather
Her red fingernails are turning black
They might cause some pain
So I hope she will attack
Here we go...dressed for success
We salute this weather
In chains and leather
I sing with my spikes
She moves with her chains
We're dancing with pain
"Hello charming, we go Spain...
Bring some toys on the plane"
Piercing during sex
Skin rubs with steel and peels
We're pinching all night long
Anywhere you go, 
You always bring the leather with you
