[music &amp; lyrics c by DEFLESHED 1995]

Lettin' my feelings rust
As you're turning my trust to dust
Oh, while this season starts
I'm totally pierced through the heart
You will always be my energy
My eyes consists of rain
In tears I see my floor...
...bloodstained...
Oh, while this season starts
I'm totally pierced through the heart
You will always be my energy
Watching what's left of your brain
In tears I cum once again

Gustaf Jorde - bass &amp; vocals
