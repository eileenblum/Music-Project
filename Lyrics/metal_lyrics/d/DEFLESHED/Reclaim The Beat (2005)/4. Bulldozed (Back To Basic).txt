All reasons swept away
And so your troops as of today

You pray for peace yet peace is but a prayer
As youâll decease youâll discover your god is your betrayer

Bulldozed â back to basic

What seven sins, which sorrows seven?
As we are dead we wonât greet no heaven
Your blood weâll spill, we fire at will
Your faith and your men we will kill

Bulldozed â back to basic

What seven sins, which sorrows seven?
As we are dead we wonât greet no heaven

Loaded with pride, steel and ammunition
Death at best is the faith of our mission
Youâll witness the fall of your fellow comrades
In never-ending on-going bomb raids

Overdosed with smoke and gun-powder
I hear the thunder louder and louder

What seven sins, which sorrows seven?
Youâll be surprised as there is no heaven

Bulldozed â back to basic
Bulldozed â back to basic
Overdosed â back to basic
Comatosed â back to basic

What seven sins, which sorrows seven?
As you are dead we wonât greet no heaven

Am I the last standing heathen?
If so this is a black day for Sweden
Am I the last being heathen?
Then thereâs a wound in the flag of Sweden
