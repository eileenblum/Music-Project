Reclaim the beat
Proclaim and repeat
The faster the greater disaster
Reclaim the beat
Entertain the heat
The better sounding the faster the pounding

Organic, cyanic
I need to be fuelled high-octanic
Dynamic, full panic
Raw wildered flesh-mechanic
Blood beating faster Iâm a speed â manic

As every sweet has its sour
You are my power yet I know Iâll be devoured
I donât burn without kerosene
And I donât move without gasoline

As every reason has its cause
Iâll break all laws and never ever stop to pause
I donât burn without kerosene
And I donât move without gasoline

Organic, cyanic
I need to be fuelled high-octanic
Dynamic, full panic
Raw wildered flesh-mechanic
Blood beating faster Iâm a speed â manic

Reclaim the beat
Proclaim and repeat
The faster the greater disaster
Reclaim the beat
Entertain the heat
The better sounding the faster the pounding

I donât burn without kerosene
And I donât move without gasoline

As every sweet has its sour
And every reason has its cause
You are my power yet I know Iâll be devoured
Iâll break all laws and never ever stop to pause
