We were sent among the first
To fight the wounds, the heat, the thirst
Still, with hate we unify
To watch you bleed and help you die

Oh, they say dead men tell no tales
But your death tells me that you have failed

Stripped to the bone
And left here all alone

Dead men tell no tales they say
Well your death tells me youâre away
Six feet down you lay with your eyes closed
So still, winsome sleep, so decomposed

Stripped to the bone
And left here all alone
Stripped to the bone

Stop!
Greaves donât come more false than this
So stop now, traveler, and piss

We are superior to your men
One of us can take out ten
There is no question if or when
So go ahead piling sandbags
Say farewell to your dog tags
While we lean back counting our frags

Stripped to the bone
And left here all alone
Stripped to the bone
