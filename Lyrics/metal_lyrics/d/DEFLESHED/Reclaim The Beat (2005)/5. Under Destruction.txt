In the stars that shall be bright
When we are dust, I put all my undying trust
For while we do fade away... in vein â theyâll still
Remain the same... theyâre all that will remain...

What is any misery worth
To the world and to the universe
And what do any of all stars care
Of our agony and our despair?

The curtain must descend
To set my spirit free
I am best described as a dead end
And a dead one, yes, yet to be

Under destruction
Iâm a fraction of what I once was
A fragile construction
A reaction to my inner loss

Perhaps too young to die
Yet far to tired to live
You must be mad beyond redress
If my next wish you cannot guess

Under destruction
Iâm a fraction of what I once was
A fragile construction
A reaction to my inner loss

In the stars that shall be bright
When we are dust, I put all my undying trust
For while we do fade away... in vein â theyâll still
Remain the same... theyâre all that will remain...

Under destruction
Iâm a fraction of what I once was
A fragile construction
A reaction to my inner loss

Under destruction
There are things you would not comprehend
No more attractions
Eternal darkness descends
Iâm under destruction
Iâve been living my life wrapped in sin
One last fatal injection
So my flesh will begin... to reflect my within
