Iâm not sure anymore, if youâre my cure
My release, my spring-breeze or my disease
Anyhow youâre charm I cannot resist
Youâre the reason why I exist

Tornado â come to me
Wherever you may be

My abstinence for violence and turbulence
Has grown into depths yet unknown
I donât care what happens hereafter
I look at tragedies with the eyes of laughter

Tornado â come to me
Wherever you may be

And if equal affection cannot be
Let the more loving one be me

So come to me

The anguish and the agony have passed
As you, sweet wind, has chosen me at last
Blow for me hurricane â justify
For you Iâll go insane â for you Iâll die

Tornado â come to me
Wherever you may be

Blow for me hurricane â justify
For you Iâll go insane â for you Iâll die
