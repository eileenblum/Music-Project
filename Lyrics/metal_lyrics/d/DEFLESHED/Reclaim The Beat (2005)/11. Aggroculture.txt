In rage we rose
With cries and with scream
Revenge of those
Who fought and died supreme
Now youâll die, so I recon
By my hordes, by our swords, within a second

Aggroculture, aggroculture
Aggroculture, a horde of screaming vultures
Aggroculture, aggroculture

Men and beasts now march to war
Break those unbroken and crack their core

Aggroculture, aggroculture
Aggroculture, a horde of screaming vultures
Aggroculture, aggroculture

Go on cry now â bleed your best
For this is how you will rest
Dead through a wound in your chest

Aggroculture, aggroculture
Aggroculture, a horde of screaming vultures
Aggroculture, aggroculture

In rage we rose
With cries and with screams
Revenge of those
Who fought and died supreme
Now youâll die, so I recon
By my hordes, by our swords, within a second
