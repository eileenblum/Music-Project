Face the wrath of an avalanche
In its path no more can stand a chance

Sheâs sleeping so respect her silence
Or youâll be doomed and trapped in her violence
One thing leads to another
Of all disasters she is the mother

Oh... avalanche â youâre condemned in advance
Oh... avalanche â caught in a fatal dance
... Oh, I will die in trance...

Chain reaction â you own my full attraction
Go on abuse me with full force

Hit by a light that soon will turn to black
Thereâs no way I will ever turn back
Welcome the darkness, death Iâll greet
Waiting for the holocaust yet incomplete

Oh... avalanche â youâre condemned in advance
Oh... avalanche - caught in a fatal dance
Oh... the dance of decadence

Chain reaction â you own my full attraction
Go on abuse me with full force
Chain, chain reaction â you meet my satisfaction
And only you can change my course

Sheâs sleeping...

Now I inhale my last breath
Cause the only cure for life is death

Oh... avalanche â youâre condemned in advance
Oh... avalanche - caught in a fatal dance...
Oh... the day of decadence
Oh... oh, I will die in trance
Chain reaction
