A shot so quick as ending
My life was not for me to save
Mine was not an ill for mending
So I simply took it to the grave

Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is bliss
For what good can ever come of this
I am dead, I am dismissed

Ignorance is bliss
I am dismissed

Turn safe to rest, no dreams no waking
Life was not a gift thatâs worth the taking

I saw the road and where it led
So I put a shotgun to my head

The sooner the better, so than later
After long disgrace and scorn
The longer wait, the heartache greater
This mind and soul should never have been born

Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is bliss
For what good can ever come of this
I am dead, I am dismissed

Ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is bliss
For what good can ever come of this
I am dead, I am dismissed

For living was simply no reason
I saw the road and where it led
Early wise and brave in season
I put my shotgun to my head

Ignorance is bliss
