If young hearts would be more clever
They would be young forever
There is no one to blame for either fame nor for shame
We are what we repeatedly do â so do something new

How come youth is wasted on the young
And why are these old dreams of immortality so wrong

Spirit supernal
Splendor eternal
A creation carnal

Everyone dies but not everyone lives
Dreams, hopes and a taste for flesh is all that life gives

May the flesh be with you
See through, there is no god â make no mistake
May the flesh be with you
So review â there is no fate but what we make

Spirit supernal
Splendor eternal
A creation carnal

May the flesh be with you
See through, there is no god â make no mistake
May the flesh be with you
So review â there is no fate but what we make

... What we make...

Seize the day or face you decay
Soon enough we will all rot away... rot away

May the flesh be with you
See through, there is no god â make no mistake
May the flesh be with you
So review â there is no fate but what we make
May the flesh be with you
