My run. The chase is overtaking me
My life is hanging by a thread
I hate these gray'n'glossy walls
I feel withering glance to my back

Fire in the tunnel
Is winding myself round
Is tearing my soul into peaches
Mercilessly
Fire in the tunnel
Doesn't let to hide out
It's lighting the last island in my
Tired twisted mind

Bells in a haze
Like mother's face
Do you remember that
Life was so good
Couldn't you guess
How it would

Pack of disgusting creatures at my back
My doubt is lifting like a smoke
My hands are betted by the fears
My eyes I'm blind off

Look up the skies
Watch there no smiles
Do you remember the
Stars in azure
Now only ceiling and walls

You are sinned and must pay
It's not my fault
You've got lost your way on passion cross
I'm only man with all my weaknesses
You are unworthy of being alive
Please don't! I'm not a villain
You are sinned and must die
Right now!

Bells in a haze
Here's your last stand
Do you remember how
You were owner
No you're a slave
In our hands
Bells in a haze
Like mother's face
Bells in a haze
Here's your last stand
