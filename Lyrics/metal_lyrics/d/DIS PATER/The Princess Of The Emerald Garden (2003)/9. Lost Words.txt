Let me say last words to you
Today I'm flying to the stars
Thank you for the magic years
I won't return but stay in your heart
I won't return to flash in your eyes
I'm called to light you from the sky
I will reflect in lonely tear
For me this world was only you!

Someone paved the pallor bridge
Hard to make a trembling step
Violin strings instead of rails
I am turning into bow
Mighty hand's directing me
Bears the music, robs of sense
At the end of the way
I close the ring... and start again

Taste my wine, it's tart like blood
You used to follow it's course
Press your palm to my sleepy breast
Won't you share with me last breath
Thank you for the fairy years
Today I'm flying to the stars
Let me say last words to you
I won't return but stay in heart!

Hard to make a final step
Someone paved the pallor bridge
The spider's web instead of rails
It doesn't matter...
I sea the shimmer of the cross
Trough the painful wrinkled haze
At the end of the way
It doesn't matter...
