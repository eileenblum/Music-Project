Somebodyâs tears
Not mine but dear
Seem to be near
But so far away
I close my eyes
And something gentle
Pours down my eyelids
And makes me sad
What is that voice
So frail and moving
Makes a delightful
Impression on me
I know just one
Nothing can happen
While I'm hearing
The distant flute...

Get out of my way
You, my tiresome passions!
Stop tearing me to peaches
Don't wear my soul out!
My lacerated feelings
Demand the revenge
So you better stand still
Cause I hear it again...

I won't believe, I'd lose you
Anytime, if you fade
So please don't be so cruel
And don't stop to soothe my ear
And I will come the swallow
That is lighter then air
And sound of a distant flute
Will foretell my placid flight...
From perturbation
Away from harm
My flight...
Into the mirrors
For new dawn

I hear again
Mysterious sounds
Babbling of water
And whisper of lives
And through it all
I hear the music
Of low weeping
And jingling tears
Fill me with kindness
Give me affection
Deprive me
Of thoughts of weaknesses
I know just one
Nothing can happen
While I'm hearing
The distant flute...
