Coming by the moonlight
Entering the shadow doors
Writing on the night sky
Every shutter's open
Whispering the peaceful words
After long oblivion
From darkness he will weave the led clouds
Those bear the night rain
On sky he'll paint a wild wind
All the nature colors
He'll unite in one
The color of the moonlight
And through the fragrant dreaming
We'll hear someone's voice
Not full of anger but fulminating down!

Sunlight is over
Starlight is cover
Dreaming souls can't sea
The distant fight
Angels battle at the borders
Of the universe
Can't imagine who guards
Our ages
Someone's breathing blows
From stars
Sunlight is over
Starlight is cover
Twelve titanics
Fight for our dreamings
Angels battle at the borders
Of the universe
Someone's scorching breath
Blows among the stars
Twelve titanics save
Our century
Drops of the night rain
Live the touches on sky
Trees light up with ones
Coming by the moonlight
Entering the shadow doors
Slowly plucking starbells
