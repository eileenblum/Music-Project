Bed of silk and velvet
I'm ensnared by cunning
Kite, by flaming plait
Tenacious glance and greedy
Sneer on lips. I'm trying
To resist but it's too late

Unbearable game
No defense you're always late
Repeated disgrace
Walls are made old by scum
A lottery fate
You're a winner you're a slave
Spark on your face
Giant is a pawn

Clench your teeth. I can't
Suppress the clash. I'm frightened
But the passion stains
Stuffy time and fragrant
Spirit. I blow on your hair
You're as a blade to the touch

Thrust claws
Into liver into heart
Forced by kite's beak
Tied and let rot
Skilful glove is crumbling me
Shreds on her counterpane

I'm effaced in sweetness
I reflect in her eye lakes
So gloomy thin ~ as violin...
The bedding's turned over
My shameful deed
Is pressed on my skin
You're a sphinx
And I am twisted at
Your royal legs
I'm blind. I service you

Thrust claws
Into liver into heart
Forced by kite's beak
Tied and let rot
Skilful glove is crumbling me
Shreds on her counterpane
Lottery
You're a bishop you're a pawn
Target on the left of breast
Powerful
Destiny attracts in grave
Flowing walls sticky darkness
