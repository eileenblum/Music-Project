Everywhere where it rains
Of pain my soul is crying
Many words, no reflections around
Wind is sad but its breath
Will give us breathing
Whisper of the night
In our hearts
I see you, you know me ~
Noone's feelings
You are wearing a dress of a dark
I will take you away
We'll touch the sky
Someone's crying to stop
We evade

Let's try to avoid the ruin of dreams
Let's wait for rapid and light cloudy stairs
Someone can break the fetters of soul
I've never been lord to your land
Trying to survive
We walk arm~in~arm
Drink the dew from skygrass
Follow the sun!

I will burn the ships
Of your offenders
Save your spring, your fate
I will take you away
We will touch the sky
I will save your honor
Your radiance
Save your freedom and then
I will take you away
We will touch the sky

Everywhere where it rains
We will bathe in skygrass
We'll reflect our smiles around
Winter said that its breath
Let us flying
Whisper of the night
In our hearts
Someone's tears on your lips
Tears of happiness
You are wearing a shine in your hair
I will take you away
We'll touch the sky
In your eyes there's
A fate of our lives...
