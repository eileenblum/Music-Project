Judgement is easy
You pick a side and a comfortable lie
Heavy the burden
when every victim is self-defined

try to understand it's harder to apologize
when all committed crimes
they're just in our minds

How hard I try
it's not enough
To clear my mind
it's not enough
I'm the jury, I'm the judge
and I committed all the crimes
How hard I try
It's not enough

I walked away, and left you bleeding
as I kicked the mud off my feet
I lay on the ground and watched you leaving
a heart fights for every beat

try to understand it's harder to apologize
when all committed crimes
they're just in our minds

How hard I try
it's not enough
To clear my mind
it's not enough
I'm the jury, I'm the judge
and I committed all the crimes
How hard I try
It's not enough
