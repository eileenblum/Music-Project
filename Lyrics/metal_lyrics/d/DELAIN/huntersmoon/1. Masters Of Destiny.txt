I, I curse the morning star and
I, I curse the moonlit sky

I traced the stars and mapped them all
And to my misery
Each single line up in the sky
pointed back to me
I can't escape my destiny
I can't escape

Like a deer, still as stone, on the road
As headlights approach

No, the things we've said and done
Oh, the things we have become
Oh the things we've said and done
We've said and done
We've said and done

Used to be sure that
It's me who sleeps
But can it be
Somewhere there's a life
That dreams of me

Used to be sure that
I roll the dice
But can it be
Eternity
is playing me

No, the things we've said and done
Oh, the things we have become
Oh the things we've said and done
We've said and done
We've said and done

Hold on
Chance is cruel but there's no one else
Keeping you down
If you don't bow to its will

I am the dreamer
I roll the dice
I'm alive
My hands aren't tied

We are the dreamers
We roll the dice
We're alive
We'll always be
The masters of our destiny

Like a deer
Brick to bone
On the road
Flesh picked on by crows

Oh, the things we have become
Oh, the things we've said and done
We've said and done
Oh, the things we've said and done
Oh, the things we have become
Oh, the things we've said and done
We've said and done
