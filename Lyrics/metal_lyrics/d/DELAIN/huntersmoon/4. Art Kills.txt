Oh ailing ground beneath my feet
Tell me how deep do I dig
To find the soil untouched by humanity
Every stone or home or tree
Every field that I see
Carefully woven in this tapestry

We are the architects of dreams
We are godforsaken
Every artefact
That will rise
Must collapse

Look what we've started
We've built a house
And wrecked a home
Look what we've started
Art kills the artist

Oh ailing ground beneath my feet
Tell me how deep do I dig
To rest my bones
So you can rest over me

We weave our tapestry
too tight around the Earth
We built a house and wrecked a home
We weave our tapestry
too tight around the Earth
Look what we've started
Art kills the artist
