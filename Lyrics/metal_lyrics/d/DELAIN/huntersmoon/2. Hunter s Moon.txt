Shake the heavens
Cross the waters blackened
All before I lose the thought of you

Many suns and moons ago
One heavy-hearted night
I trusted my heart to the waves
And flung her out of sight
Heavy love sank down the sea
And to the ocean floor
Still you're here
Still I'm yours

You - peril of desire
You - sweetest misery
You - you are on my mind now
Time again, time again

Once upon a heavy night
Under the hunter's moon
And under waters deep my heart
Still skips a beat for you
Heavy love will wash ashore
Carried in by the tide
Because you're here
Because you're mine

Will I endure
If not with you
The midnight sun
The hunter's moon
No days and nights
Of solitude
I'll walk with the reaper
Or with you
