[Bonus Track Edition]

Misted windows
Hide your empty eyes
Every moment, every whisper
Separates you from me
Iâve been screaming
Wonât you let me in?
Let me see a trace
Of the places hidden
Under your skin

[Chorus:]
I foster illusions
Of which I am afraid
unknown emotions
Repel your embrace
I foster illusions
Of which I am afraid
afraid of your embrace

Needles sting me
When you look away
And your silence
Sounds like deafening screams to me
Iâve been waiting
Wonât you open your heart?
And let me in
Please let me in

[Chorus]

Free your mind from doubt
All you have, is now
Free your mind from shame
It will only bring you pain

[Chorus]
