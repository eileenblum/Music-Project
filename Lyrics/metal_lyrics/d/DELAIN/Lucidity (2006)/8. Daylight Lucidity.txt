Daylight lucidity
Stream through me
Let me dream
Out of this world, out of this world

[Chorus:]
I cannot sleep
Sedate me
Wide awake
Animate this soul
I'm still following the pain

Daylight lucidity
Beam on me
Come to me
Into my sleep, into my sleep

[Chorus]

Don't try to wake what is unreal
The secrets only you must seal
You hold the key of what I need
Unlock the door that will reveal

[Chorus]
