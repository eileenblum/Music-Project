Judgement is easy
You pick a side and a comfortable lie
Heavy the burden
When every victim is self-defined

Try to understand it's harder to apologize
When all committed crimes
They're just in our minds

It's not enough
How hard I try
It's not enough
To clear my mind
It's not enough
I'm the jury, I'm the judge
And I committed all the crimes
How hard I try
It's not enough

I walked away, and left you bleeding
As I kicked the mud off my feet
I lay on the ground and watched you leaving
My heart fights for every beat

Try to understand it's harder to apologize
When all committed crimes
They're just in our minds

It's not enough
How hard I try
It's not enough
To clear my mind
It's not enough
I'm the jury, I'm the judge
And I committed all the crimes
How hard I try
It's not enough
