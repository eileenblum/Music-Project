I once had an understanding that everything would go my way
But now weâve come too far along for me to hold on to my own beliefs
Iâm not in it for the fun of it but for the pain
Iâm not at all interested in your temporary fame

I just want to see you stare
As I lay my soul bare for you
to crush upon with heavy feet
Iâm in it for the beat

Stranger the faces
Stranger the places
Theyâre becoming us
Here come the vultures
Here come the vultures
Heading over us

Itâs just a black murder of crows
Across the sky
The moon announces that it will soon be night
The light dies down
The spot goes on
As loveless lips
Break into song

I once had an understanding that everything would go my way
But now weâve come too far along for me to hold on to my own beliefs
Iâm not in it for the fun of it but for the pain
Iâm not at all interested in your temporary fame
And the same old song we sing

Hereâs to the ghost
We still seem to host
How heâs becoming us
Here come the vultures
Here come the vultures
Screaming down at us

They said you can not sing the blues
When youâre pretty and young
Let me show you a face that fits to neither one
This heart is black
like blood that has dried
This song is blue
Like bruises bright

I once had an understanding that everything would go my way
But now weâve come too far along for me to hold on to my own beliefs
Iâm not in it for the fun of it but for the pain
Iâm not at all interested in your temporary fame
And the same old song we sing

Murder of crows across the sky
The moon announces that it will soon be night
Fog closes in
And all I see All empty eyes
Through silent screams

I once had an understanding that everything would go my way
But now weâve come to far along for me to hold on to my own beliefs
Iâm in it for the beat
