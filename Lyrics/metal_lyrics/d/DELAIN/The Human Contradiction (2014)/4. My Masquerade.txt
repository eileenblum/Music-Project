Your face, my face
You breathe, I breathe
You fail, I fake
I pray, I pray...

You lose, I lose,
You bruise, I bruise
I hunt, you stay
My prey, my prey

My masquerade
If youâre not afraid
To take a step into my realm

A ball, tonight
Cover your eyes
By touch and taste
Weâll find our way

Your secrets deep
Yes I will keep
I hunt, you stay
My prey, my prey

My masquerade
If youâre not afraid
To take a step into my realm

Take of your mask
And you will see
The freak in you
The freak in me
Tonight we hide
From judging eyes
Weâll dance until the sunrise
