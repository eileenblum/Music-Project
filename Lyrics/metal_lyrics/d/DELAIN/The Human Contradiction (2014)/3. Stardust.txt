Dreamscape in a blanket silver grey
Homesick for a memory washed away
All light in our hollow eyes is stardust (stardust)

Once you learned there is no return to lies
Heaven cried as we left the earth to die
Homesick for a memory
in silent sleep
Eternally

[Chorus 2x:]
Bring me to life
Bring me the starlight
Bring me the sun and moon
Release the stars tonight

Far away in a distant memory
There is lush
There is green
Thereâs you and me
Now all blood in our hollow hearts is stardust (stardust)

Washed away
Like your face drawn in the sand
At the edge of the sea is how we end
Painful is the memory
We did it to ourselves !

Awaken me
Bring back my heartbeat
Bring back the warmth of skin
The world we were living in

[Chorus]

Bring me to life
(Dreamscape into grey)
Bring me the starlight
(Homesick, all washed away)
Bring me the sun and moon
Release the stars tonight

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

Bring me to life
(Dreamscape into grey)
Bring me the starlight
(Homesick, all washed away)
Bring me the sun and moon
Release the stars tonight
