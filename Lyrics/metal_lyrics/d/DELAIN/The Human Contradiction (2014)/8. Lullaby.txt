We are sinking this ship now
By midnight hour
How long can you hold your breath?
To the sirens who sing to
the broken hearts
We are humming the same tune

Goodbye my lullaby

Under water reflected
flashes of life
Floating up from your lungs, your lips
When you decided to sail to
The other side
You decided to sink too

Goodbye my lullaby

I will miss you
