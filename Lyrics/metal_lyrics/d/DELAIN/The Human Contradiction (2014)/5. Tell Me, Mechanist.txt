[feat. George Oosthoek]Tell me, Mechanist, is it true?
Does none of it bother you?

Once upon a time
Upon a time behind us
The mechanist inclined
Clockworks of time define us
Who you are, who you are;
Merely springs that tick
The time of things away

The cry from the beast is just the noise
Of a spring that you have touched
Not a human: not a voice

If only we could go back to the start (Tell me, mechanist, is it true?)
We would see weâre not that far apart (Does none of it bother you?)
Realize the likeness of our hearts
If we could go back to the start

One and the same
Likely to one another
But the mechanist inclined
Merely our kind can suffer
Who you are, who you are
Does it justify
Pleasing your palate
With the otherâs blood?

Tell me why, have the writings on the wall
Nor the dawn of DNA,
Changed a single thing at all?

If only we could go back to the start (Tell me, mechanist, is it true?)
We would see weâre not that far apart (Does none of it bother you?)
Realize the likeness of our hearts
If we could go back to the start

Closing Collision:
The end of our divide
Savor the flavor Of our ancestry rites
Closing Collision:
Weâll realize in time
No opposition
Weâre genetically entwined
