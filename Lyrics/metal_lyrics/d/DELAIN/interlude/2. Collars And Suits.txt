Trying so hard to get by
To be the next big thing alive
But all the same
Every color I see â a pale shade of grey
Trying so hard and they say,
"You're just a signature away,
Just one handshake."
Well, here's to collars and suits
And things that they say,

"Once more it's your chance, just take it
Once more, don't be so blind
For all I care you fake it
It's your chance to shine."

[Chorus:]
And it's all
All that I dream of
There's nothing I want more
There's nothing I would trade it for
All I dream of
(My mistake if I'm not taking it)
It's all I really want
(All at stake if I'm not making it)
There's nothing I want more
(My big break if I'm not braking it)
There's nothing else
My problem if I can't take it

Why would we change our own game
These are the rules by which we play
I've heard it all before
"Try to make up your mind
And make up your face."
I don't believe in a way
To skip a chapter and be great
There's no such thing
Where all traumas and flaws are gently erased

"Once more it's your chance, just take it
Once more, don't be so blind
For all I care you fake it
It's your chance to shine."

[Chorus]

Here's to the collars and suits
(Here's to the collars and suits)
And the things they say
(And the things they say)
Gotta bring something better to the
Table to tempt me
Here's to the collars and suits
(Here's to the collars and suits)
And the things they say
(And the things they say)
Better put your money where your mouth is

[Chorus]

My mistake if I'm not taking it...
All at stake if I'm not making it...
My mistake if I'm not taking it...
All at stake if I'm not making it...
My mistake if I'm not taking it...
All at stake if I'm not making it...
My mistake if I'm not taking it...
All at stake if I'm not making it...
My problem if I can't take it
