[originally by Talk Talk]Such a shame
to believe in escape.
'A life on every face'
But that's a change,
until I'm finally left with an '8'.
Tell me to relax - I just stare.
Maybe I don't know
if I should change
a feeling that we share.

[Chorus:]
It's a shame (such a shame)
Number me with rage
It's a shame (such a shame)
Number me in haste (such a shame)
This eagerness to change

It's a shame

The dice decide my fate
that's a shame (that's a shame)
In these trembling hands my faith
tells me to react
"I don't care"
Maybe it's unkind if I should change
a feeling that we share.

[Chorus]

Such a shame
(Number me with the rage)
Such a shame
(Write across my name)

[Chorus]

Such a shame
