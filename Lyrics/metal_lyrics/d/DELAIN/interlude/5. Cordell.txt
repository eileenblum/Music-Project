[originally by The Cranberries]Though once you ruled my mind
I thought you'd always be there
And I'll always hold on to your face
But everything changes in time
And the answers are not always fair
And I hope you've gone to a better place

Cordell, time will tell
They say that you past away
And I hope you've gone to a better place
Time will tell, time will tell
They say that you past away
And I know that you've gone to a better place

Cordell, cordell
Cordell, cordell

Your lover and baby will cry
But your presence will always remain
Is this how it was meant to be
You meant something more to me
Than what many people will see
And to hell with the industry

Cordell, time will tell
They say that you past away
And I hope you've gone to a better place
Time will tell, time will tell
We all will depart and decay
And we all will return to a better place

Cordell, cordell
Cordell, cordell

Nana, nana, nana, nana
Nana, nana, nana, nana
