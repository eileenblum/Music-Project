I can't forget the faces
I can't forget the sounds
I can't forget, can't get the fever down
I guess imagination 
it makes it come around
whenever lightning strikes
and thunder sounds

We shared nothing
but storm, but wind
one rainswept moment
stuck within

Day by day
I walk the distance alone
walk the distance alone
Day by day
I fight the fever alone
fight the fever alone

I can't forget the shaking
your hands over my own 
both hot with fever
to our very bones
I do regret the feeling
that we will never know
what might have happened
had we not let go

Day by day
I walk the distance alone
walk the distance alone
Day by day
I fight the fever alone
fight the fever alone

I can't forget the faces
I can't forget the sounds

Day by day....
