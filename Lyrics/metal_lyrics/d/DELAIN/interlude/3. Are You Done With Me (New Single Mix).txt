This city drinks and roars
Each word so meaningless
Each word, especially yours,
Echoes inside my head

[Bridge:]
Why can't you see
I won't let you get your way
Let you get the best of me
I just need to know
Are you done with me?

[Chorus:]
So are you done with me
And if you are won't you just let me be?
I try to understand your reasons for leaving
I cannot believe it

This city drinks and screams
This night will never end
This city made of dreams
My dreams have turned to sand

[Bridge + chorus]

So are you done with me?
Are you honestly?
Did you realize that I can't be all you need
Are you done with me?
Are you honestly?
If love is gone then I am done again.

[Chorus 2x]

This city drinks and roars...
