The sun was golden flamed
The air was sweet like honey;
The grass was soft we made
A pledge to keep on running.
The clouds all shied away
The air was warm and damp;
Oh on this golden day,
You ripped my heart away.

It was the dawn of may,
A lonely blackbird singing,
Now the same melody,
Brings back the pain...

[Chorus:]
(bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
Take my advice !
(bring back the pain)
You'll get it, regret it
If you are wise !
As long as you are getting older
Always look over your shoulder twice

The moon was silver-lined,
The air was sweet like honey.
We've said our last goodbyes,
Now what are we becoming ?
Outside the blackbirds sing,
But you keep down the blinds,
'Cause each time you kiss her lips
They'll sing my lullaby.

[Chorus]

Always look twice

[Bridge:]
Not so long ago,
Now we are sober and cold
There's no way to return
We've got to let our bridges,
Got to let our bridges burn

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]

(You played with my heart,
You ripped it appart)
Always look over your shoulder twice.
