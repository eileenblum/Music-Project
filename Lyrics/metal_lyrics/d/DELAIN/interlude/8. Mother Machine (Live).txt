Incomplete, cast in the concrete
walk the city streets
granite sky
My machine built the factories
feeds the worker bees
get in line

Round and round and round
the wheels come down
Dreaming of the steam
the pounding sounds
Round and round and round
the wheels come down
Won't you electrify my soul
intensify it all

Little girl in a concrete world
artificial hurt
in your eyes
You won't see any living trees
any flower fields in my time

Round and round and round
the wheels come down
Dreaming of the steam
the pounding sounds
Round and round and round
the wheels come down
Won't you electrify my soul
intensify it all

I like the plastic people paper world
The silver moon, the iron sun
I'll fold you paper flowers little girl
for you'll never see a real one

Round and round...
