Dreamscape in a blanket silver-gray
Homesick for a memory washed away
All light in our hollow eyes is stardust, stardust
Once you learn there is no return to lies
Heaven cried as we left the earth to die
Homesick for a memory
In silent sleep
Eternally

Bring me to life
Bring me the starlight
Bring me the sun and moon
Release the stars tonight

Far away in a distant memory
There is lush, there is green there's you and me
Now all blood in our hollow hearts is stardust, stardust
Washed away like a face drawn in the sand
At the edge of the sea is how we end
Painful is the memory
We did it to ourselves

Awaken me
Bring back my heartbeat
Bring back the warmth of skin
The world we were living in

Bring me to life (Dreamscape, in silver-gray)
Bring me starlight (Homesick, all washed away)
Bring me the sun and moon
Release the stars tonight
