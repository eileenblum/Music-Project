I was here
When the first morning dawned upon you
I'll be there
I was here
When the first ever, drew breathing
I'll be there
For the last living thing

And now
Turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
And now wakes up the world
Behind of that all
Turn the lights out
Turn the lights out
And make the universe

I was here
When the our kind recognized me
I'll be there
I was here
When you dropped me
When you spited in me
I'll be there
For the last living thing

And now
Turn the lights out
And now wakes up the world
Behind of that all
Turn the lights out
And make the universe
