I need your inspiration in
I feel you're everything now
I feel your hesitation
No, don't let go

If you're fine at the end of a lonely road
it's the light at the end of a tunnel
It's the fall goddess calling all assets, whoa
(I need your inspiration in)
It's your voice saying I've been gone for too long
it's the very first words of my favorite song
it's the face in the crowd that is calling me, oh
(I need your inspiration in)

I need your inspiration in
I feel you're everything now
I feel your hesitation
No, don't let go

It was lonely and dark and it was getting cold 
I was defiled from the light and getting old
I was counting the days and the years to come
(I need your inspiration in)
It take a stranger to make it so easy
it made me dance to the sound of you breathing
it makes it last as my last breath escapes me
(I need your inspiration in)
escapes me

I feel I'll never let you go again, 
I feel I'll never let you go again

I need your inspiration in
I feel you're everything now
I feel your hesitation
No, don't let go
