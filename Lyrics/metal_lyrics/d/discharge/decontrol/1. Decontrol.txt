They fill you up with their fucking lies
You're the victims of government schemes
They take liberties they've no right to take
And you believe they're oh so right
They only show concern when war is declared
Cos you're their power and glory
This whole affair's so fucking unfair
It's so fucking sick

Decontrol, decontrol 
We're being shit on far too long
