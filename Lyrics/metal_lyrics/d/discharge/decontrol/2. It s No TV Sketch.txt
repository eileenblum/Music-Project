The limbs of a child stick out of debris
It is no TV sketch
No no TV sketch

It ain't the work of make up artists
This wounded flesh and blood
No no TV sketch

A child lies dead in a pool of blood
It is no TV sketch
No no TV sketch

It ain't the work of make up artists
This wounded flesh and blood
No no TV sketch
