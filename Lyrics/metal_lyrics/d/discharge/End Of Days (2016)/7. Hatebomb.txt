Don't wanna be a part of your system
Represents everything I'm not
Not a number, not a machine
This pile of flesh and blood

Hatebomb
Hatebomb
Hatebomb blowing up through my head
Hatebomb
Hatebomb 
Hatebomb 
Hatebomb blowing up through my head

Your opinions make me sick
You're adding fuel to my fire
Just another rich man's cause
So out of touch with real life

Hatebomb
Hatebomb
Hatebomb blowing up through my head
Hatebomb
Hatebomb 
Hatebomb 
Hatebomb blowing up through my head
