Can't get my head around all
The government lies
World comes to an end
Now there's a surprise!

They lie you die

Is there any point in asking
Cause you never get the truth
What the fuck do they expect
This resentment from you

Their deafened ears
They don't listen anymore
What their eyes see
They choose to ignore
Never want to hear the truth
They don't listen anymore

Do they really expect our trust
In this system they create
More promises broken by
This manipulative state
