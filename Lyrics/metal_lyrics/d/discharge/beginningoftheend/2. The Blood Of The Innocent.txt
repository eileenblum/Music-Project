More blood is spilt of the innocent
Religious and fanatical suicide
They kill, maim and they slaughter
Until the world bows to their demands

The blood is spilt of the innocent

Never falter keep the faith
You are working for a higher race
It's your path to a promised land
As you kill with a coward's hand

More victims slain in the name of god
Than any wars of genocide
What right for them to pass judgement
What right do they decide
