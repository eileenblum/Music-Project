Observing us the human race
What we breed we must consume
Watch the sky just rot away
One day it will be our last
Don't worry it'll never happen
Mankind won't take the push
Humanity surely ain't that dumb
There's no real risk to us

It's the beginning of the end
Humanity's raised its ugly head
Again, again and again

No such thing as a dead cert
Are you sure of what you see
See some crazy fucker
Make a claim in history

Crazed regimes nothing left to lose
Pushed aside and just ignored
A bad move on your part
Could be the calm before the storm
