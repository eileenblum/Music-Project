A blinding light, winds and firestorms agonised crying 
Never never never again

Unanswered cries of help, panic and desperation
Never never never again

Dazed and stricken survivors search for lost families
Never never never again

Choking lust, crazy with thirst, drinking from poisoned pools and streams
Never never never again
