Sounds of distant aircraft get louder 
Louder, louder and louder
Massacre of innocence

Men, women and children 
Flee from the open in search of safety 
Massacre of innocence

Sounds of distant aircraft get louder 
Louder, louder and louder
Massacre of innocence

A woman breaks down and cries
Her child is left playing in the street
Massacre of innocence
