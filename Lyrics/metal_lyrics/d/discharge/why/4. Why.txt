Besides her man she kneels 
Holds him tight and begins to cry 
Why why why but why 

Her loved one's just another piece of meat 
On the battlefields 
Why why why but why 

Her cries break out into screams 
As she now becomes hysterical with grief 
Why why why but why 

Her loved one's just another piece of meat 
On the battlefields 
Why why why but why
