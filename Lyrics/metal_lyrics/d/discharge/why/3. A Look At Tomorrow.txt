I look out my window to a blinding bright light 
Enola passes, passes by 

Tomorrow, tomorrow, a look at tomorrow 

Hysterical men women and children 
Run in search of their families 

Tomorrow, tomorrow, a look at tomorrow

I look out of my window to a blinding bright light 
Enola passes, passes by

Tomorrow, tomorrow, a look at tomorrow

Skin is shed like that of snakes 
But it's not the work of mother nature

Tomorrow, tomorrow, a look at tomorrow
