Men and women young and old 
Out on the streets homeless 

Does the system, does the system, does this system work 

In plastic bags they carry their homes 
Clothes in rags they walk the streets 

Does the system, does the system, does this system work 

Men and women young and old 
Out on the streets homeless 

Does the system, does the system, does this system work 

In bins they search for the odd dog end 
The odd dog end and food

Does the system, does the system, does this system work
