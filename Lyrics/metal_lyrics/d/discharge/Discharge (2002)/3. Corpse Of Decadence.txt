Ain't running for the prize
Here's to their demise
Here's to their demise

Here's to the corpse
Corpse of decadence
Here's to the corpse
Corpse of decadence

Count me out
Ain't playing their game
Into their bloodied hands
She flaws in their perfection
Every luxury has its price
Here's to their demise
Here's to their demise
