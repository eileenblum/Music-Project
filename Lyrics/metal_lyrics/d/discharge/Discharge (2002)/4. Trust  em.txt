With lies they'll lure you
With walls wall you
With lies they'll lure you
With drugs drug you
With lies they'll lure you
In blood baths bathe you

Trust 'em
Can't trust 'em
Trust 'em
Can't trust 'em

They'll poison your minds
With their rhetoric
Attempt to dominate
Your way of thinking
Set a code for your living
