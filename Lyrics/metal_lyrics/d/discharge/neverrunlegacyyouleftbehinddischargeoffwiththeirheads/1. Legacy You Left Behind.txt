The scars of betrayal
Still evident to see
The scars still remain

Lies and betrayal
The legacy you left behind

Start with a clean slate
Try to forget the past
The scars still remain

To regain our trust
Just as easy as that
The scars still remain

Some wounds never heal
Some scars will never fade
The scars still remain
