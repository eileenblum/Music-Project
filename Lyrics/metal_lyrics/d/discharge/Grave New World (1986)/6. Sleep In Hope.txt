Sleep In Hope
In Hope Of This
A Land Where Thought
Is As Free as The Sun
Where The Altars Of Sheer Power
And Mere Profit Have Fallen
Fallen To Disuse
Fallen To Disuse

So My Friend
Sleep In Hope
In Hope Of This
In Hope Of This
And May Your Will Power Tower
And Your Heart Be Strong
And May Your Will Power Tower
Will Power Tower

A Land Where Peace And Love
Reign Above
Hate And War
Where No Greed Or Creed Do The People
Do The People Heed
So Sleep In Hope
But Your Hope Must Wake
While Your Choice Is Yours
Yours To Make
