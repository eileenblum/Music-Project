Though Grief And
And The Cruelist Of Winds
Loss Must Blow Across
Pain Deadens And Tears Dry
With The Passage Of Time

Though All Must Suffer Loss And Grief
Time Is Kind And Brings Relief
Though All Must Suffer Loss And Grief
Time Is Kind Time Is Kind

At First Hearts Break And Sorrow Numbs
No Words console No Comfort Comes
But Time Is Kind
And Life'll Shine
Life'll Shine Through
Shine On Through
