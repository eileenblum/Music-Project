Too Long Too Long Far Too Long
We've Sailed The Ship This Ship Of Woe
It's Time To Pull Together Pull Together
To Bring The Ship This Ship Ashore

Dry Dry Dry Dry Your Years
Dry Your Years Arm Your Arm Your Fears

In Laughter In Anger For Better Or For Worse
Join Me When The Adverse Wind Comes
Only These Chains Do We Have Lose
Come My Friend Add Your Voice To Voice To This

Too Long Too Long Far Too Long
As Your Anger Remained Bottled Up Inside
It's Your Time For The Cork Cork To Be Drawn
Come My Friend Add Your Voice To Voice To This
