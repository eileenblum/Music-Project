I Remember That Grey Day
She Lay Still On The Floor
Needle Still In Her Arm
Eyes Staring At The Wall
The Tears Didn't Come Right Then
I Don't Know If They Ever Came
But Something In Me Died Back Then And I Know
It'll Never Be The Same
It Seems Like Years Ago
But I think It Was Only Yesterday
The Picture's Still Locked In My Mind And I Know
It Will Always Stay It Will Always Stay

After Reading This
This To Myself
I Know I Know
You'll Be Filled With Pain
So Please Please
Keep My Memory
Close To Your Heart
And Your Love Love
Love For me The Same

Cause At This Stage
I Need Need Your
Friendship More Than Pity
Friendship
Friendship More Than Pity
Friendship
Friendship More Than Pity
Friendship
More Than More Than Pity

And Maybe Just Now
I Can Tell You The Reason
For All These Drugs
These Drugs I'm Taking
For Although I'm
So Scared Of Dying
I'm Terrified
Terrified Of Living
