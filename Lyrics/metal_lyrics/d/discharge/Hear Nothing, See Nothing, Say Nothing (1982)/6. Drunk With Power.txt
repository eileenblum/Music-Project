For how long do we tolerate these fools drunk with power

Drunk with power, obsessed with death 
Death and destruction, drunk with power 

A giant game of chess they play with you and I as the disposable pieces

Drunk with power, obsessed with death 
Death and destruction, drunk with power
Power, power, power, power, power
