You take part in creating this system
That we all must suffer in
We can't stop going round and round
We got to fix this rat race

This is the system you helped to create

They use you for corruption schemes
You're the unrealized and unintended
You're the one, the one they don't like
You let them know your fears

This is the system you helped to create

You ask me why I'm fighting the system
Why I'm preaching anarchy
I'm fighting for the freedom
Fighting for the rights, for the likes of you and me

This is the system you helped to create
