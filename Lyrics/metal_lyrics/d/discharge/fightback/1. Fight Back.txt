Bristol's riots was a result of people's anger
Towards the system

Fight the system fight back

People die in police custody
Where's the justice in that, don't see none

Fight the system fight back

We've been shit on far too long
There are no equalities, no freedom

Fight the system fight back

Stand up fight for freedom
Stand up fight for your rights

Fight the system fight back
