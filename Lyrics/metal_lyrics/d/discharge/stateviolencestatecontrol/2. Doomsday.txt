And now the end, the end is near
It's time to say our last goodbyes

Doomsday, doomsday
It's doomsday, doomsday

Is it reality or just a nightmare
Nightmare, nightmare

Doomsday, doomsday
It's doomsday, doomsday

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
No escape, no escape

Doomsday, doomsday
It's doomsday, doomsday

Is it reality or just a nightmare
Nightmare, nightmare

Doomsday, doomsday
It's doomsday, doomsday
