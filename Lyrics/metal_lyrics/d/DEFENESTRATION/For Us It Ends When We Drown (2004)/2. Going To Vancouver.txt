I'm left blind, by this connection
So unkind, our main affection
There's things that make you, a main attraction
But then I see right through, that same reaction
Why didn't we know?
Your words were always wrong
All our dreams were caught in our throats
They're ours now you've gone
I'm left blind, by this connection
So unkind, our main affection
There's things that make you, a main attraction
It's hard for me to get the satisfaction I want now
Here and now
Can't wait, Won't wait, cos' satisfaction is on your head
We lives with doubts and wait, one day you'd be fair
We tested our beliefs and found out we don't care
Now it's gone, time to move on
These years we'll always know
Are the ones that you have lost on
Caught dreams in our throats
