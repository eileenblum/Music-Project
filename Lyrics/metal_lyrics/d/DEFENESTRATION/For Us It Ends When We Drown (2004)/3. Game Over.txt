Bottle empty, we're all fucked up
Stumbled out words tonight
Heights are taken into our blood
Our eyes are wide delight
No faces you would know
Seems theres nowhere to go
It's time for me to show
I'll never leave you alone
No place to go? so come with me
(we'll stay up till dawn)
It's time to slow but not for me
(And I'll be here for days)
Don't want to come down to
Sounds alone on the phone
Where are you?
Concerning, I'll come to discerning
No faces I can see
There's somewhere I should be
Things start to spin around
I'll sit, before I fall down
No place to go? so come with me
(we'll stay up till dawn)
It's time to slow but not for me
(And I'll be here for days)
