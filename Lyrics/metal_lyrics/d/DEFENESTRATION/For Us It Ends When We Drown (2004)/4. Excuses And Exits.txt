So there's a wall there
we'll find another way round
You think we won't dare
Bounce higher on the rebound
Been kicked in the face
Still burning thanks for nothing
Been put in our place
It doesn't stop there
For us it stops when we drown
And you'd have been there
Still burning thanks for nothing
For us it's too fair that you're not there
Forsaken for our fight
Won't give up day or night
You thought it's said and done
But it has just begun
Excuses and exits you've gone again
You'll be pathetic, and we'll forget
Been kicked in the face
Still burning thanks for nothing
Been put in our place
Forsaken for our fight
And we can make this
Still burning thanks for nothing
And we'll stand by this now
