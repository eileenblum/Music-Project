No fear of being caught(wasted and blind)
Times running out
Temptations killing me (out of my mind)
Check whos about
Lust boiling through my skin(no second glance)
Low down torment
Grab hold with all you've got(don't take the chance)
Wait for consent

I saw you, standing there
Looked right through, dazzled stare
I watch the way, you move
Smile Softly, I'll have you

When you come near, I fill with fear
Can't change my mind
You look to me, I hardly see
So unkind
Pulling you close, who's pulling most?
I'd say it's you
The fear has gone, I carry on
Moments of truth
I'm waking up, near you
I'm woken up, by you
I've woken up(I've woken up)
I can't believe
That I've done this(I can't believe)
Regretfully...
