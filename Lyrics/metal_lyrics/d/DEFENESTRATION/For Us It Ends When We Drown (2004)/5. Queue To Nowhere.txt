Resigned, I know, go places I thought I would never go
I rub my eye, and my head spins
Clouds close outside, and so this day begins
Swallow and join that queue to nowhere again
The place where all, the faces look the same to me
I crawl, don't need to feel, to think or see
I rub my eyes, and my head spins
Clouds close outside, and so dependence wins
Waste away, to get paid, feel all numb, makes me dumb
Get on my feet again
Focus to prove, it don't, have you
I'll be myself again
But will I try to stop? decide
My head's not clear, it's been too long to care
Over my limits I decide to go to highs and tries
I never thoughg I'd know
Don't let me stoop so low
