Always and forever / Burned in my hands / The rhythm of the trigger at home within my hands / It hurts me to see you like this / Just one question / How does it feel / Did you ever stop to think / That maybe you're killing me / How I wish that was true / I now wish you would end me / Always and forever / She swallowed / Choked / Broke her neck as she screamed "never" / This ends right here / This ends right now / You're not going home looking like that / Take one for the road / Every second you wasted on breathing / You could have swallowed the blood in your mouth and said you were sorry / If we make it out alive I swear I'll kill myself first / Why would I hurt you? / This will be over soon / Faster than it would take for 6 bullets to reach the back of your skull / Grind my teeth until my gums bleed / Like a bad dream / I wait simply to speak to myself in my sleep / Just like a bad dream / She burnt out faster than I could have ever imagined / Just like a bad dream / Always and forever
