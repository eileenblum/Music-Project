How tired are you now /Can you feel it burning / You would have thought by now / I would have ended my life long ago / For what it's worth, it's really not / For what it is worth / You're already dead / You know it and you love it / Raptures and explosions / Movements slowing into still life / That vacant look in your eye / I've seen it before / In a mirror cracked by anger / What stands frozen before me / once saw myself / And the image broke / By my hands calloused and bruised / Shards of a reflection of self abuse / Embedded in the knuckles of an overanalyzed dream / I no longer sleep to keep from waking up / I've come to the realization that no matter how hard I try I'm only dying / You're only dying / You are dying / You, you're waking up to do this all over again
