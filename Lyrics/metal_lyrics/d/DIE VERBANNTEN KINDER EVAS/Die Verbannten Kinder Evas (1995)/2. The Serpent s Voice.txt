There was once truth in what you spoke
But teased by doubt alone
I hear the serpent voice inside me
Sands of time will now dissolve

I cry for truth from where I stand
But growing lies my reply
I bought my ship of dreamy pictures
Through the seas of death

I sale but know not where I am
Sinking and no one around
The last sound that my body utters
Is a cry for truth
