Darkened Northwind
Fade away from all mankind
To the darkness
In your heart you feel your dying
Fear the winter
And the cold in which your living
Always sadness
From your soul and in your world

Darkened northwind
Fade away from all mankind
To the darkness
In your heart and in your dying

Cry wherever you want
Crying wherever you want
No tears on that holly ground
No tears on that holly ground
Run from darkened world
Running from the darkened world
No aim you can reach for
No aim you will ever reach
Freeze on this frozen ground
Freeze on this frozen ground
A warmth nowhere in sight
