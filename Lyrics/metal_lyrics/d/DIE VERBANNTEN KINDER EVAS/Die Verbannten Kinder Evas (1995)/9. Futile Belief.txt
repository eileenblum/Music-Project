In the evening call for him
Waiting for the good life he may bring
It won't come to you
He doesn't hear for you

In your darkness beg for hope
Waiting for the good thins he may bring
They wont come to you
He doesn't hear for you

But you never will deny
All the things you've ever done before
You will not deny
He doesn't hear for you
