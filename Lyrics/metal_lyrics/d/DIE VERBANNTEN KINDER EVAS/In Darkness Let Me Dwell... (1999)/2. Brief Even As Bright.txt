The flower that smiles today
Tomorrow dies
All that we wished to stay
Temps and then flies
What is the worlds delight?
Lightning that mocks the night
Brief even as bright

Virtue how frail it is
Friendship too rare
Love, how it sells poor bliss
For proud despair
But we, though soon they fall
Survive the joy and all
Which ours we call

What is the worlds delight?
Lightning that mocks the night
Brief even as bright
Whilst yet the calm hours creep
Dream thou and from thy sleep
Than wake to weep
