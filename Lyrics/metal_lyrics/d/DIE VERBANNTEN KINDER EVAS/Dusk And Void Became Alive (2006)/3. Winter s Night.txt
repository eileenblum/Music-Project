The sky won't be blue again
The scent of meadows forever gone
Fading cries, a colden reign
The magic land of sparkling snow...

Enchanting beauty in its pride
A mystic stranger, softest might
A sad and colden nameless bride
Never forgiving winter's night

Sky won't be blue again
The scent of meadows forever gone.
Fading cries, colden reign
The magic land of sparkling snow.

Enchanting beauty in its pride
A mystic stranger softest might
A sad and nameless bride
Never forgiving winter's night.
