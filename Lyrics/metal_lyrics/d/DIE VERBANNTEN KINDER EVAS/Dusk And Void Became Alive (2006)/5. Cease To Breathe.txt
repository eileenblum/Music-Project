Cease to breathe, my friend, no moore!
Please, no longer live not now
Close your eyes forevermore
Stop your heartbeat sounds somehow.

Tell me no farewell, don't speak!
I won't bury you, don't ask!
Choose your place in mystic dusk
Choose it on the highest peak.

Cease to breathe, my friend, I'll leave
Leave your shadow, leave your shape
Promise me: we'll meet in grief!
Silence nothing more to say.

I will help you now, just wait,
I shall see you'll come to stars.
Bring illusions there so far!
Bring the death there, don't be late!
