She lived in darkness and in light
For pilgrims in the deepest night
For poets searching for the sign
But seen seen the sense only to die

She wasn't warm, she was so cold
But granted warmth to every heart
Of those who were so brave and bold
To let themselves to be apart.

She was to blame of every hope
Of those who're wandering in vain
Who found inhuman deadly cold
Discovering their own ways.

She was the one, she was the star
Or could be brightest, saddest for eternity.
But she was pale, and not so far
To not fall down on Earth one day.
