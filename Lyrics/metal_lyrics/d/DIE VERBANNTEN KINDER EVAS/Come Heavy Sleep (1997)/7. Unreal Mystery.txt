You thought you'd be strong
Far from this place where you've been
When you were in safety so long
So sorry you feel
That all your strength then was gone
And all hopeful feelings were lost

This kingdom of yours
Means nothing more than a
Small tiny point in this universe
Your feelings and thoughts
Mean nothing more than a
Wasted and senseless phantom of time

And the billows of clouds
That roll around you shall sleep
In the light of wondrous days
Where hell and heaven shall leave
You free to the universe of destiny

This world's the nurse of all
Of all we know and the coming
Of death's a fearful blow
When all we know or feel
Shall pass like a so unreal mystery

Who painted all those shadows
Those shadows that are beneath the winding caves
The wide winding caves of peopled  tombs
Or united the hopes of what shall be
With all the fear and the love for that which we see
