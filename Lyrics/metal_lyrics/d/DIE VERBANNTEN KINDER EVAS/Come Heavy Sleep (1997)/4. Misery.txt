Come, be happy and sit near to me,
Shadow-wested, shadow-wested misery,
Unwilling silent bride
Mourning in thy, in thy robe of pride

Come, be happy and sit near to me,
Sad as I may seem, sad as I may seem to thee
I'm happier far than thou,
Lady whose imperial brow is endiademed with woe

Hasten, hasten to the bridal bead
Underneath the, underneath the grave 'tis spread
In gloom may our love hide
I may rest with my eternal bride

Kiss me, kiss me, oh thy lips are cold
'Round my neck, around my neck thin arms, thin arms enfold
They're soft but chill and dead
And thy tears upon my head like points of frozen lead

Clasp me 'till our hearts, till our hearts be grown
Like two shadows, two shadows into one
'Till this dreadful transport may
Like a vapour fade away

We may dream in that eternal sleep
That we are not the kind of those, who weep
Even as pleasure dreams of thee
Thou majest dream of her with me
