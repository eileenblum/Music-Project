Strikes you in the back
Holds you down in flames
Burn your souls for him

He is the master of hell
Bringer of torture
He is the master of hell
Raise your horns

Death dressed in black
Hell of a killer
Reaper of the night
Killer of the light

He is the master of hell
Bringer of torture
He is the master of hell
Raise your horns

Hell fire hell
Coming down on you
Coming down on me
Hell fire hell
Coming down on you
Coming down on me

Strikes you in the back
Holds you down in flames
Burn your souls for him

He is the master of hell
Bringer of torture
He is the master of hell
Raise your horns

I'm evil so burn me
The fire will never cleanse my soul
