Ignite fuel the light
First blood that's right
Your pain is my gain
Obedience to power reign

One choice
Death or destruction

Eyes glare a tragic face
Scared and bruised, what a disgrace
Oh yeah, I sympathize
But mercy never graced my eyes

Damn right evil agitation
Fuel the sinners congregation

Stand high on hostile ground
Malice thrust all around
Solutions light can't be found
Lasting peace dies with force

Damn right evil agitation
Fuel the sinners congregation

Damn right evil agitation
Fuel the sinners congregation
I see no reason, nothing's right
Despise 'em all
Of course you are a sinner

Burn out fading fast
Life's but a minute in time
Hey now, we turn to dust
What's it come to?
Senseless misfortune disgrace
Blame appointed to gods
Hey now, are you so blind
Sinners burn with pride

Ignite fuel the light
First blood that's right
Your pain is my gain
Obedience to power reign
