Visions born out of black
Now I see the reaper here in front of me
Darkness falling inside my brain
Death I have come to discover
Falling burning returning to hell
The goat of evil on the throne
Master, master, master infernal
Let me return to destroy 'em all

Destroy 'em all
Infernal master call
Destroy 'em all
Return to the fire fall

Evil is sent to condemn my soul
Submit to violent overkill
Creation will burn the devil return
Fear the infernal fire
Front line force, fatal remorse
Kiss the goat and die

Destroy 'em all
Infernal master call
Destroy 'em all
Return to the fire fall
Destroy 'em all
Infernal master call
