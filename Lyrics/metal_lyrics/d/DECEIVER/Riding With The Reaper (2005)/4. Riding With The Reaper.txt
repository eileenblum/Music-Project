Life doesn't feel right
But who's to say it's not?
I'm always out to blame you
Death my one and only friend
In whom I place my trust
You're always out to get me

Riding with the reaper
Come and die with me
The reaper
Come ride with me

Now I'm closer to the edge
And I'm about to lose
It's the way it's always been
Hey I gotta watch my back
I'm used to it by now
To stare in the face of evil

Riding with the reaper
Come and die with me
The reaper
Come ride with me

This is how I wish to be
Depraved and vicious
Can't you see?
Betrayed, deceived from here to hell
I guess I got myself to blame

I am my own nightmare
Pleasures call to be destructive

I know it might be hard to see
You always make me feel right
Don't take me for some kind of fool
This is how I wish to be

Kill me with your poison
Deprave me with wine and women
I know you're gonna bring me down
But this is how I play the game

Riding with the reaper
Come and die with me
The reaper
Come ride with me
