I am one of many
Burning the night
Haunted by my past
I wish to move on
Now I can't stand the city lights
I call upon you babe
Help me with my grief
Help me

Cover the wounds, life is torn
Cover the wounds
Take me back to my life

Am I one of many?
That burn in your heart
You say you want my future
I wish to move on
I can't stand your narrow mind
And your way of life
If you want me back
You must

Cover the wounds, life is torn
Cover the wounds
Take me back to my life
Cover the wounds, life is torn

The bitch got something to say
Shut your fucking mouth
I see no reason to listen
I see no reason to care
There is no way out
All that I feel is disgust

I am one of many
Burning the night
You're burning out baby
You're in my way
I can't stand your narrow mind
So back off bitch
Stay out of my way
I must

Cover the wounds, life is torn
Cover the wounds
Take me back to my life
Cover the wounds, life is torn
