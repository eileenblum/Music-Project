Driving through the passage
Riding through the night
I seek the pieces of my life
(That were) lost in torment
There is a dream to be
Another life I see
Far beyond all pain
God of death take me home

I take care of me
I am myself I see
No this cannot be

Struggle to keep it all together
It's time I meet me now at the cemetery
I rule the dark beyond
At the graves I'm home
I can't stand the stench of the living

I take care of me
I am myself I see
No this cannot be

Hey blood shall soak the soil
Free this mortal coil
I am god of dead
Cast in stone forever the legacy of bloodshed
I am god of dead
Cast in stone forever the legacy of bloodshed

Ah, the coffin is so cold
The bones I now exhume
Isn't this a lovely view
I am grotesque, submit to death
I love the dead

The heel is on the shovel
The dead is six feet under
It's time I rule the dead at the cemetery
I rule the dark beyond
At the graves I'm home
I can't stand the stench of the living

I take care of me
I am myself I see
No this cannot be

I god of dead
I am god of dead

Decay my corpse
Consume my flesh
I am god of dead
Decay my corpse
Consume my flesh
