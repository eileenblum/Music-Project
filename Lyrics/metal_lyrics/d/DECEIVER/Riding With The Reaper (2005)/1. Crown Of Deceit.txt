Evil sent from the heaven's divine
Fallen, fallen into fire
Deep into desire
Blood and torture
Innocent whore
I am the one they call evil

Deceiver, who made you divine?
Sinner, sinner to you who see the light
In the night
I know I'm right

Evil sent from the heaven's divine
Fallen in the lake of fire
Standing back to back
Faces reflect the primal evil
The path to god leads astray
Crown of deceit
Crown of deceit

Banished eternally damned
It's come to this
I the forsaken rebel
Mock the words of the sacred whore
Crown of deceit
Crown of deceit

Believer the crucified icon bleeds
Hey, it's a pity that you're blind
Deceiver, who made you divine?
Sinner, sinner to you who see the light
Blood and torture
Innocent whore

Crown of deceit
Crown of deceit
Crown of deceit
Crown of deceit
