I'm here at dawn waiting for another day to come
I'm battered and bruised
Don't even know where the hell I've been

In the morning haze
My poison feeds

Intoxication
Precious substance
Mexican thunder
Black death of hell
Mexican thunder
Pour me another

I walk my way down to town through empty streets
I feel like shit but another bottle gets me going again

When daylight shines
My poison breeds

Tequila tantrum
Pain submission
Mexican thunder
Black death of hell
Mexican thunder
Pour me another
Tequila tantrum
Pain submission
Mexican thunder
Black death of hell
Mexican thunder
Pour me another

Do I want to see it now
The ugly face of my disgrace
Think about what could have been
Now all is lost and gone to hell

I don't really have to think
Just pour me another drink
And now some ten shots down the line
I guess I'm feeling fine
I'm right on top and get some more
And then I hit the floor
No more booze or live to lose
I never got the chance
The chance to choose
