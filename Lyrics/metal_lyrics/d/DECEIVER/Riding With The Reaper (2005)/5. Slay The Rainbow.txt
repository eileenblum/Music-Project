She is the one from hell
Kiss her boots and bleed
Tear you down in a dreadful way

She is one of the damned
Born in the wild
Raised on the streets
Running, running, running
Running through fire and endless hopes

Slay the rainbow
Damage your dreams and vanish to dust
Slay the rainbow
Fighting the lust for widows in black

Plead to be her lover
Revel in her lust
Satisfy her needs
Crawling down her legs

Look into her eyes
A river of silver and gold
Do not play with evil
Do not curse the devil

Slay the rainbow
Damage your dreams and vanish to dust
Slay the rainbow
Fighting the lust for widows in black

Damage your dreams and vanish to dust
Fighting the lust for widows in black

Slay the rainbow
Damage your dreams and vanish to dust
Slay the rainbow
Fighting the lust for widows in black

Do not curse the devil

Do not waste your time
Save your pride and kingdom
Moan to the one who cares
Shake to the bastard who dance

She is the one from hell
Kiss her boots and bleed
Rockin' rollin' fighting
She is one of the damned

Slay the rainbow
Damage your dreams and vanish to dust
Slay the rainbow
Fighting the lust for widows in black

Slay the rainbow
Damage your dreams and vanish to dust
Slay the rainbow
Rockin' that lady ain't your tune
