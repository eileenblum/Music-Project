Some are born to sweet delight,
some are born to endless night (William Blake)

Seeing this world with these eyes
It's impossible to find a way out
I tried to live like normal,
explored the limits of lust
Tried to heal myself, burned my past to dust
It brought no results, nothing
All I feel is...

The relic of everything that has hurt me
My symbol for revenge
The ecstasy beyond boundaries
I'm unconscious
Yet still feeling my dreams so real

Seeking for something
to channel all this hatred
Seeking for inspiration
Like the pictures of 1300's death
Drives me to the edge of sanity

My waltz of obscurity
The journey through years of pain
And still 8 or more remain
And the grief will sustain
My hope disappears
There are no more tears

To lose the only lifetime, all there's left
But still not ready to die - no
Much more deeper I must go

This black rage blinds me
Makes me lose control
Makes me want to kill

And the white one makes me patient
With the power of white
I will wait, be courteous
and dream of revenge

Enough of this bullshit
Time to execute the plan
The operation that will end this all

I mainly feel joy,
so relieved to make this happen
I've got the gun, I've got the bullets
It was so... so easy

They are going to die
They will give their lives
They're like birds on a wire
No chance to say goodbyes

The ecstasy beyond boundaries
Floating in a world of unconscious

This moment of fulfillment
Makes me greater than ever before
I leave the physical world, but hope to
live eternally - In their legacy

Some are born to sweet delight,
some are born to endless night

Seeing this world with these eyes
It's impossible to find a way out
I tried to live like normal, explored the
limits of lust
Tried to heal myself, burned my past to dust
It brought no results, nothing
All I feel is...

The relic of everything that has hurt me
My symbol for revenge
The ecstasy beyond boundaries
I'm unconscious
Yet still feeling my dreams so real
