"In a land made by sword, life ends with a sword"
This steel so clear, shear essence of fear
Implement of honour, forged in ancient manner
Blade wrapped in cloth for clean incission

The journey of a warrior ends here, 
at the highest tier
The they are waiting for his final words

Ritualistic precision
Guilt free emission
Poetic end of shame
Clears the stained name

From left to right
Then upwards tight
Towards chest height
Sensing the pain divine

Turn the blade
Slowing heart rate
Left to fade

All hail the honored dead!
All hail the honored dead!
All hail the honored dead!

[Lyrics by Jukka Pihlajaniemi]
