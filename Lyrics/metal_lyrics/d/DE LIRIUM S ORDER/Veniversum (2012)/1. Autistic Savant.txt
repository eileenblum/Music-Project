The numbers are not silent
For him they mean beauty
Phenomenon - deviation from us
From what is natural

Please decide is it him, the prodigy
Or do you see a being you despise

Looking down from the skyline
To structures so difficult to find
Those landscapes to remember
They remain the same forever
His mnemonic that you shall not understand

Vi veri veniversum vivus vici
Vi veri veniversum vivus vici
The unverse of thought is waiting to be born
The land that's free of human faults 
The orthodox views are ready to be torn
As a result of his mind's accomplishment

Seeing all the mistakes made by the others
Makes him feel uneasy
But the greatest questions, with no answers found
Insomnia... Where is the solution?

Vi veri veniversum vivus vici
Vi veri veniversum vivus vici
Without a thought he sees the world unknown 
Such mental skills he's always had
Within this aural imagery he roams
Where the scale of cosmic and small unite

Vi veri veniversum vivus vici
Vi veri veniversum vivus vici
For a second so close of finding the key 
To understand why he recalls it all
The riddle of human brain, 
Still a mysery remains inside of him

The enigma of his mind
The sounds of those symbols
The voices decipting the numbers
The scenery of number six
These are the properties of savant
Mystery to us

Without a thought he sees the world unknown
Such mental skills he's always had
Could he teach them to me?
So that I could start to see
