Merging my darkest thoughts /  Creating a beast in my mind / Secluded world, inside me to burn / Cries even I can't hear / I can't see clearly anymore / Insanity knocks behind my door / Evil inside, forces of the wicked, from the other side / The dead man did not leave the world / The world abandoned him / No future in life / All hope is lost and gone / Memory to recreate itself / An image in my mind so profound / The legacy of a man never disappears / A man who lived like a beast / Too short of a lifetime / But still he saw everything / The eyes are cold now / Beast

[Tuoppi in Memoriam 1980-2005]
