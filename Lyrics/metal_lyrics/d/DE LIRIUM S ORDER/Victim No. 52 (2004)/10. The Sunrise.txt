The famine is overhelming in Colombia
On the cold streets in 1957
Betrayed and left to be sodomized
A surreal state of appaling life

Prison
Illusions swept away
Anger
In enormous dimensions
Revenge
For raping one's mind for ever
Emptiness
Apocalyptic sense of hate in his appearance

Over the edge of tolerance
No one is safe from the terror

Floods unvocering cadavers of missing persons
Rotten so bad that there's no chance to know how they died
Putrefaction caused by sewage
And the next victim waiting for

The sunrise of Ambato
Staring to the eyes
And strangling to death

The monster of the Andes
And his massive killing capacity

The divine moment of suffocation
Would be a waste in darkness
The spark of life suddenly disappears
For one's gratification

Mass grave
Feasting among the dead
Alive
One is still breathing
5
Minutes to die
Hell (on earth)
She is a part of a morbid circus

Over the edge of tolerance
No one is safe from the terror

Floods unvocering cadavers of missing persons
Rotten so bad that there's no chance to know how they died
Putrefaction caused by sewage
And the next victim waiting for

The sunrise of Ambato
Staring to the eyes
And strangling to death

The monster of the Andes
And his massive killing capacity

The killing never ends
