Pounded skulls and their smashed bones remain
Still hear them scream - still see them bleed
When you enter these tombs of the mutilated

Blood!!! Pestilence and plague
Death!!! Their final destination

Beneath the bones lies the altar of sacrifice
Still hear them scream - still see them bleed
When you see these rites carved in stone

Blood!!! Pestilence and plague
Death!!! Their final destination

Demonic souls and the priest of abomination
Staring through your eyes - staring to your mind
In these chambers where you belong

Blood!!! Pestilence and plague
Death!!! Their final destination
Awaits!! Beneath their bones

Awaits!! Beneath their bones!!!
