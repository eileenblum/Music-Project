The world through the eyes of a murderer
Twisted faces that pray to be mutilated

A memory is haunting his mind
Like every young boy dreaming of horror
He wrote those words in blood
Took a hammer and smashed his parents skulls to pieces

He has born in a place where bodies are melting
And sick voices command to do sick things
And scissors awaited for me every night to be caressed
He forced you to see him him mutilating bodies and eat their livers

The sick mind is burning in a room made of flesh
He is a sinner
And preys to be eaten alive in the depths of his heart and mind

The victims of an innocent, young boy's mind
Every night they hear
Voices of the dead and damned
Haunting every movement you will ever make
You will burn

Blood streaming down the stairs
Mass executions are not in the history
Let out the whip of execution in me

In me...

Terrible nightmares and hallusinations ruin their lives

The spirit of murderer will never stop to chase you
You will suffer

There's no one to help you
The sick flesh cannot be imprisoned
And the more you fear him, the more you suffer
And everything will end up in laughter

The litte boy destroying your body
And raising your head on his hands
You see your own body split wide open
And a myriad of rats eating all of your liver

The spirit of murderer will never stop to chase you
Voices of the dead and damned
Haunting every movement you will ever make
You'll never die

Blood streaming down the stairs
Mass executions are not in the history
Let out the whip of execution in me

In me...

He runs in a frozen labyrinth from victim to another
