Dealing with the dead more than with the living,
Cutting their skin, it's nothing new for him.
No social life with the outside world,
Distant with living human beings.
As years go by this harden mind begins to scatter.
Only the deceased are his partners...
And his lovers.

And when the lights go dim
He begins his grim rituals.
Again from his mind awakes this shameless beast.
All pure thoughts are gone
It's time to feast.
It's time to shed their cold blood.

The dead... they don't hate me.
The dead... they don't resist me.
They do exactly what I desire,
They do it exactly when I desire.
And how I desire.
They thought I am out of my mind,
Well they don't think anymore,
They are here right by my side.

Your eyes are so beautiful
When they are glazed like that,
They have so many stories to tell,
Let me just dig them out so I
Can remember you.
Your skin is s odelicant,
Let me just cut a slice out of it
You dont need it anymore.

The dead... they don't hate me.
The dead... they don't resist me.
They do exactly what I desire,
They do it exactly when I desire,
And how I desire.
