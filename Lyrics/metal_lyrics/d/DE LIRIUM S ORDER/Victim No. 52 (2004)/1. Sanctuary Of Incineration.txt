In the beginning of a monster, there were strange desires
An aspiration to inflict pain on the prey
And to see the blood of a victim creeping in the dark

But fantasy is nothing for Leonard's growing needs
And so he begins to outline the borders of his reality
So beware!

When the masterpiece of the morbid mind is planned with care
He begins to build up a catacomb of your most heinous dread

Fright!!!
In the eyes...
Of the dying
When she sees her family dismembered

The chainsaw starts to mangle, ripping the girl of her own
She's awake and screams for her life
The sickness of bloody dismemberment unites
In the twisted smell of blood and gasoline

The full moon is rising and the chainsaw is hot
Horror resurrected
Eyes gleaming in the dark
Behing the glass, enjoying the freak show
Watching you crawl in the blackness

The fear is embodying
And it makes you wanna die
What is he going to do next?
Leave me alone!

Chainsaw sings in the night
Leonard has the magic touch
Elegant gory murder
Good ol' ultraviolence

The distant sound of butchering

Incineration...

200 pounds of intestinal powder

Fright!!!
In the eyes...
Of the dying
When she sees her family dismembered

The chainsaw starts to mangle, ripping the girl of her own
She's awake and screams for her life
The sickness of bloody dismemberment unites
In the twisted smell of blood and gasoline
