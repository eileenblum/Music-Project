Remains of Lyusov Biryuk from Novocherkassk
Maimed and smothered in a ditch
Eyes carved out, stabbed to death
Russian desolation
Insane celebration

Decomposition
Eyeball waste
And the sickness emerges from nothingness
To create an beautiful artwork of murder
The Rostov ripper is hungry for blood

He says that they deserve it
They don't need to breathe

"I will gain my pleasure by knife and rope
As they did for him
Disfigured, brutally consumed
Mental isolation
Abhorrent deprivation
Human life has no meaning to me"

Decomposition
And the sickness emerges from nothingness
To create an beautiful artwork of murder
The Rostov ripper is hungry for blood
