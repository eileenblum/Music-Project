Rotten practise - deserted and out of use
It has been closed for decades
But by nightfalls, when the doctor arrives
He carries in ther victim and the tools for the torment
Meat is kicking - the victim is still alive
Now the doctor's gonna teach you
Hold still, this wont take long

It is for the thrill of the kill
The screams the blood - to be a god
I practise the art of torture
And I order you suffering

Explore the flesh, study the bones of the dead
Rape the corpse, in the pool of her blood

It is for the thrill of the kill
The screams the blood - to be a god
I practise the art of torture
And I order you suffering

Rotten practise is now full of life
A training ground for the doctors deadly art
Sit back and enjoy - this wont take long

It is for the thrill of the kill
The screams the blood - to be a god
I practise the art of torture
And I order you suffering

Mental gore disciple answers his calling
Drill symphony, dead notes fill the room
In the house were art is dead!
