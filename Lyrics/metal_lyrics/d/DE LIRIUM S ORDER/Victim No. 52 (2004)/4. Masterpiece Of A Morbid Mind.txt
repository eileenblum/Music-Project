People disappearing all over the city
And horror raises to humans' mind
Body parts found in every trash bag
And strange marks written all over them

People crying in their churches
As their children are now eaten

But the murderer won't stop sending eyes and legs
Of the ugly children he has cutted

Moaning and suffering echoes somewhere
Wired flesh rotting in a metallic room

And after the confusion lasted for many months
The hunger of killer is stronger than before
Excited by people who say that he's insane
He raises the hammer and begins to slay

Masterpiece of a morbid mind
Will reveal the sickness and soul of man

Masterpiece of a morbid mind
Is the final rite of insanity

Remember how children were weeping?
Watching their suffering mothers to burn
As they asked you a question
Remember where you come from?

And the morbid mind just watched the holocaust
Thinking that he's the new born Nazarene
And the Nazarene is a slave of evil
And the Nazarene is a slave of evil

Masterpiece of a morbid mind
Will reveal the sickness and soul of man

Masterpiece of a morbid mind
Is the final rite of insanity

Rot!!!
