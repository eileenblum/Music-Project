A life of hate through trials of fate
Feel despair, beckon for the truth
Suffering the fear of pain
Inside of me I cannot escape

Hidden feelings suffocation
Mental surge excruciating
Anger burns inside of me
As I live forsaken hatred

Time can't heal emotional scars
Brought to life by emotional scars
Illusion seen through eyes of fear
Trying to make this hell disappear

Hidden feelings suffocation
Mental surge excruciating
Anger burns inside of me
As I live forsaken hatred

Agony appeals to me
I can't escape the pressure
So I slowly fade away
Sanity, tranquility
Pleading for the time
When my mind and soul are free
Life of pain and misery
I've chosen my path
I now await my fate
Infinite suffering
After forever will I still be me
Hate in my eyes is the way
Ridding myself of internal decay
Change is constant as I see
Permanent will never be
Clinging tight to the end
Is my life an eternal sin
Life I've seen now disappear
Drowning in a sea of fear
Reality fades away
Shattered life hate and dismay
Anger burns inside of me
As I die

Hidden feelings
Mental surge excruciating
Anger burns inside of me
As I live forsaken hatred
