Screams fill the night
Cries fall upon deaf ears
Another one dies
Shattering pain life ending in tears
Controlled by torture
Pain and punishment are one and the same
Violent circle
Stakes are high when playing my game
Screams fill the day
This pain you cannot escape
You have no choice
With Tyraninol your mind I rape
My Innocence
Will constantly deceive you
To you a saviour
Together we can destroy ourselves

My life is evil
I bring you pain
I will deliver the suffering

Once again
You feel the inner pain
Terrorized
By the need for suffering
Inject the venom
Kiss the flesh of death
From my control
Slave of pain now put to rest
Your antedote
For life I have prescribed
No resistance
From inside I watch you die

My life is evil
I bring you pain
I will deliver the suffering
