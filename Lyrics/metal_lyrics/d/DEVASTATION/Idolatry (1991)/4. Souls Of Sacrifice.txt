Souls of black 
Lives of hatred and scorn
Fire of darkness
Dwelling deep in the mind
Blasphemous lies
Like blood on a double-edge sword
Denying the cross
Mocking the one they call Lord

Evil lives everywhere
Come with me meet hate and despair
Will I live of will I die
Weak must perish, the strong will survive

Seeking death
Torment through suicide
At one with Satan
The evil one lives inside
Sacrilege
So foolish is your way
In fire and brimstone
Now you eternally rot away

You worship Satan
Prepare to die
Eternally black
Souls of sacrifice

You worship Satan prepare to die
Eternally black souls of Sacrifice
Walk through the gates into flames of hell
And you see that God prevails

Souls of black
Lives of hatred and scorn
Fires of darkness
Dwelling deep in the mind
Blasphemous lies
Like blood on a double-edge sword
Denying the cross
Mocking the one they call Lord

Evil lives everywhere
Come with me hate and despair
Will I live or will I die
Weak must perish, the strong will survive
