You made us in your image
Or did we make you in ours
The quest for pure supremacy
Now we've limited your powers
Take your place begin the ceremony
I represent all that's righteous and holy
Humanity bow down before me
Desecration of life

Father please forgive me
For I know not what I do
Confessing to another
Will tils release my sin against you
My sanctuary
Is rapidly becoming sanctimonious
Through my eyes
Cast into an archaic mold

Afterlife will not suffice
Born to die pay the price

Take my hand I plant the seed
As the ritual now proceeds
Save me from my fall from grace
Victim of innocence legacy of faith

Kneel to a god you don't know
Finding comfort for your soul
Before the alter you now stand
Drink the blood of the dying lamb
Crucifix and statues show
Ritualistic minds begin to flow
Image of the intangible
The thoughts you can't behold

Afterlife will not suffice
Born to die pay the price

Take my hand I plant the seed
As the ritual now proceeds
Save me from my fall from grace
Victim of innocence legacy of faith
