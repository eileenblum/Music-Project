Born to serve I cannot see
Life of pain trying to execute me
Tribulation persecution of the weak
Souls are lost jest to satisfy the hunger
Immortal blood of those upon my hands
Seeking refuge the promised holy land
Eternity is the price worth the cost
Servant slays the master

Life is of no value
I worship what I hold close to my heart
Master, please don't betray me
I pray your words will find their place in me

There I was among the dead
The point was clear as the blood was running red
For an instant I was alone
A thousand years time refuses to unfold
I worshipped one like myself to put the blood to the test
See me, free me, save me, please take me
I gave you life, you choose to die
But now you're free, forsaken me
Idolatry, idolatry

Can't you see it's killing me the pain inside
From my feelings I can't hide
I chose my fate now it's too late life is gone
Hellish memories linger on
I walk alone into the dark
Bleeding heart now torn apart
Sacrifice the dying one
Hells is here nowhere to run
Hypnotize and mesmerize
Eyes of fire seen in disguise
Father grant my last desire
Release my soul from the fire

Life is of no value
I worship what I hold close to my heart
Master, please don't betray me
I pray your words will find their place in me

There I was among the dead
The point was clear as the blood was running red
For an instant I was alone
A thousand years time refuses to unfold
I worshipped one like myself to put the blood to the test
See me, free me, save me, just kill me
