Existing in my mind
Thoughts I can't control
Altered state of being
Confusion takes its toll
The mental struggle
Of mind and body are one
Oblivious to the moment
When peace of mind sets in

Is it real is it a dream
Can't open my eyes I cannot scream
A parasite dwelling inside my head
Devouring my mind life hanging from a thread

Is there another inside of me, deep within my mind
Without a trace of life blood I see but I am blind
This can't be reality
Fighting for my sanity
Though I try I can't break free
From this thing controlling me

Subconscious-The war inside my head
Subconscious-Twisting into form
Subconscious-Prisoner of pain
Subconscious-The war rages ever on
