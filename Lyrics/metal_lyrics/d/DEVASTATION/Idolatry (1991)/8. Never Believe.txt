Before the dawn one of you will betray me
For you my unholy brother better off if you weren't born
For tonight the prophecy will be fulfilled
Strike down the leader and the people will scatter
Sold my life for a price and now my blood lays on your hands

High priests have gathered
To arrange false evidence and crucify
Send forth no more witnesses
We have ruled against this blasphemer
Your saviour is worthy of death
Awaiting the fate of the world
Release the notorious prisoner
And leave the righteous to die

Betrayal of life you stole
My life you sold away
The world weighs on your shoulders
Repent or take the blame

Never believe open arms set to deceive
Never believe at the altar I prepare to die

Honesty means nothing you've proven that to me
I can see right through you scarred for life you'll always be
Hypocrite until the end yours was by far the superior sin
Epitome of corruption let the cycle of life begin
I can see you fighting, fighting for what's right
Through trials and tribulation you're better off to die

Living for yourself observing no-one else
Faith and comfort bring pain and misery
As my life does end look to begin again
Try not to pretend taking sin after sin
Now I see the way life's paved with bitter hate
Looking to the sky my soul begins to cry
Accept life's final plea of which to set me free
Though it's not meant to be denying honesty

Your saviour is worth of death
Awaiting the fate of the world
Release the notorious prisoner
And leave the righteous to die

Never believe open arms set to deceive
Never believe at the altar prepare to die
