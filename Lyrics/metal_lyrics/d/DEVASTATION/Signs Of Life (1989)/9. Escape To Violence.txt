mutilation death's construction 
another world left behind 
seek the way to no answers 
immortal beings left to die 

escape to violence 
out of control 
carnage of reason 
destined to death 

decimate holy terror 
manipulate archaic soul 
eulogistic of life's anguish 
malevolent hatred blood will burn 
parasitic mutant victim 
rotting thoughts decayed response 
social outcast malicious virus 
random murder armed 

escape to violence 
out of control 
carnage of reason 
destined to death 

rancid martyr pillaged horror 
abdicate morbid fate 
malignant cancer necromancer 
the sovereing one is he dead 
endotrophic cells implode 
corpse of being rabid flesh 
sublimated virtues lie decayed 
the fatal seed has been spawned 

escape to violence 
out of control 
carnage of reason 
destined to death
