living alone yet unafraid to die 
a prisoner of time i not know why 
seeking life through death a deserving cause 
away from all immortal solitude 

afraid to live nothing to give 
total isolation take my soul 
seeking death final breath 
termination lose control 
twisted mind violent crime 
now i'm doomed before my time  
life betrayal as i fail 
set me free from this eternal hell 

you live, i die 
innocent submission is the reason why 
my life, my fate 
stricken by the power left to subyugate 
i pray for infinity 
for the end of time that's all that will set me free 
last chance, final chance 
fallen victim to the future by the past
