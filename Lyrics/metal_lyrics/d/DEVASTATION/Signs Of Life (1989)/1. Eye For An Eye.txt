afflicted pain reveals in life no inner will to live
descending war becomes of us destruction tends to drift
society manipulates deformity resides
evaluate the world in the time an inner choice decides

I see the end and know there's no escape
close my eyes meet death accept my fate
intimidation closes in not asking why
not it's an eye for an eye

prescribed yet to delinquish
no true alternative
seek powers from the unknown
eternity decides again

vindication of my mind
hidden thoughts are weak but still prevail
alienation opasses now
eternal beings cast from the suffering

as i live exist in fear in my mind preserve
thoughts of death once reborn a sentence yet unserved

i see the end and know there's no escape
close my eyes meet death accept my fate
intimidation closes in not asking why
not it's an eye for an eye

chaotic norm cease to exist prestige is now futile
unwilling reform incapable seclusion brings the end
reflecting time as now has seen repeating the process
second sequence falss too short an inner choice decides

i see the end and know there's no escape
close my eyes meet death accept my fate
intimidation closes in not asking why
not it's an eye for an eye
