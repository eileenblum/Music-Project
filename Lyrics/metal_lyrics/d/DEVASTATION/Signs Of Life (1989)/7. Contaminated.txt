rainning fire holocaust, searing death all is lost 
torn and tattered decayed matter, final blow blood will flow 
techno-violence submissive will, push the button overkill 
prevalent hatred fornicated, accepting death denying life 

sacrificial - terms of dying 
terminating - wars reciding 
apocalyptic - genocide 
asphyxiated - mortal plight 

contamination seeds the ground 
death and mortis depriving life 
immolation of the masses 
blinded eyes asking why 

poison air ripping lungs, shattered bones infected blood 
blistered skin tears away, shells of life cast aside 
carnage wretch, horrid stench, your cofin is where you stand 
victims of atrocity, remnants of humanity 

sacrificial - terms of dying 
terminating - wars reciding 
apocalyptic - genocide 
asphyxiated - mortal plight 

contamination seeds the ground 
death and mortis depriving life 
immolation of the masses 
blinded eyes asking why 

contaminated now as my body starts to burn 
feel no pain as i escape reality 
now watch me die as i try to escape the fatal dose 
the will to live merely now just a killing joke 

rainning fire holocaust, searing death all is lost 
torn and tattered decayed matter, final blow blood will flow 
techno-violence submissive will, push the button overkill 
prevalent hatred fornicated, accepting death denying life 

sacrificial - terms of dying 
terminating - wars reciding 
apocalyptic - genocide 
asphyxiated - mortal plight 

contamination seeds the ground 
death and mortis depriving life 
immolation of the masses 
blinded eyes asking why
