a time will come, all eyes shall see 
the coming of foretold prophecies 
to eliminate all future pain 
horror is the price you pay 
realistic terror through the days 
evil minds bring evil ways 
war after war of man and beast 
darkness prevails 
as death's unleashed 

tribulation, cast in fire 
enter the ritual, of life's desire 
revelation laid to rest 
accept the wisdom, unholy test 
wear the mark, evil sign 
symbol of a darkened mind 
suicide or salvation 
blackened heart brings deception 

confusion - am i living or dying 
searching - for my fate left beyond 
survivor of a hell on earth 
descending, i'm waiting to burn 

judgement's been passed 
this day  is the last 
fire from the heavens 
the ultimate task 
the beast shall rise out of the sea 
bringing forth words of blasphemy 
separation of powers 
of both by the law 
foretold by prophets in visions they saw 
out of the earth the second shall rise 
unsightly miracle 
death shines in his eyes 

tomorrow we die 
feel the fire burn deep inside 
no escape - no reprise 
tomorrow we die 

hypocrrisy, the chosen few 
words of wisdom coming true 
abomination, once left to die 
millennium twice passed by 
supremacy, the final wrath 
clear the bloodstains from the past 
countless bodies, piles of dead 
mystery now looms ahead 

a time will come, all eyes shall see 
the coming of foretold prophecies 
to eliminate all future pain 
horror is the price you pay 
realistic terror through the days 
evil minds bring evil ways 
war after war of man and beast 
darkness prevails 
as death's unleashed 

tomorrow we die 
feel the fire burn deep inside 
no escape - no reprise 
tomorrow we die
