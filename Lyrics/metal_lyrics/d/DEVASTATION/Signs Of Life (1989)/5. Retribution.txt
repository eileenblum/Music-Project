victimless circumstance condemned by prejudice 
self-appointed jury concedes no innocence 
suffer of hate plots his vindictive ways 
death becomes imminent, life no longer is a game 

execution, endlessly 
choice of death, what will it be 
the fatal conflict beckons thee 
retribution, set me free 

swift, rabid punishment for those cause the pain 
vehement death vendetta from a man labeled insane 
slicing away his agony, his agony, morbid judgement has been passed 
ravager of solace smiles - the anguish now released 

determinating fury spreading death through the reign 
fallen remnats from a mind described as cynical through pain 
life's value extracted by an unrestricting grief 
inevitable fear unheard destroying silent screams 

retribution, set me free 
victim lies in dormancy 
the fatal conflict has been fought 
endless struggle, death is sought 

justice is served in his mind but not in others 
the law of degradation that cast their shadows seem despondent 
victim becomes victim in a system ran by lies 
pondering what he has done as they tape electrodes to his eyes 
insanity the final plea escape the tortured path 
remorses is inconceivableaccept the chosen path 
blind by hatred driven by a revengeful eye 
no peas, regrets, or penance seen, the time has to come to die 

choice of death, what will it be  
flick the witch to be free 
no regrets, no final pleas 
retribution, killing me
