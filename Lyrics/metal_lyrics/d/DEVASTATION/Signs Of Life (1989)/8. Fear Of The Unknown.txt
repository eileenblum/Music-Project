a dark creation of my dreams 
beneath the surface the evil brings 
unforseen thoughts of what will be 
life or death or eternity 
paranoia is no answer 
the truth can't hide behind the question 
what's to come and what's to be 
my afterlife what's in store for me 

time stands still as it's slipping away 
unanswered questions make me wonder the way 
living in fear a predetermined destiny 
the meaning of life is my own reality 

reincarnation, i just can't see 
coming back as another being 
god is there is he for me 

a savior for my life to be 
nothingness the worst fear of all 
where dead is dead and i can't be saved 
destined to lay decaying away 
inside i'm still living day after day 

cast into nonexistence hear my cries 
fear of the unknown what is life what i am 
wings of tribulation pull the life from my eyes 
now i'm gone nothing but an afterthought 

my fate is only what's in store for me 
the blood of innocence shall set me free 
reborn as my soul will grow i must die 
dreams foretold my fate now i visualize 
sacraments of written lore 
interpret manings of life before 
feel the pain experience the question 
are we dead or in suspension 

time stands still as it's slipping away 
unanswered questions make me wonder the way 
living in fear a predetermined destiny 
the meaning of life is my own reality 

cast into nonexistence hear my cries 
fear of the unknown what is life what i am 
wings of tribulation pull the life from my eyes 
now i'm gone nothing but an afterthought 

subjugate 
life's restraint 
no escape 
drawing nearer to the end 
lives in sin 
death begins 
soul descends 
eternally my life is lost 

the sands of time are running low 
each step draws closer to the end 
where does time begin and where does it end 
my only instinct once was survive 
i've lost the will and the struggle inside 
breakdown the barrier of this life that surround me 
destroying life and all it's worth 
the end is here i await my rebirth 

a dark creation of my dreams 
beneath the surface the evil brings 
unforseen thoughts of what will be 
life or death or eternity 
paranoia is no answer 
the truth can't hide behind the question 
what's to come and what's to be 
my afterlife what's in store for me 

time stands still as it's slipping away 
unanswered questions make me wonder the way 
living in fear a predetermined destiny 
the meaning of life is my own reality 

cast into nonexistence hear my cries 
fear of the unknown what is life what i am 
wings of tribulation pull the life from my eyes 
now i'm gone nothing but an afterthought 

infiltrate 
terms of hate 
sealed by fate 
meant to sufer or set free 
eternity 
dependency 
calling me 
i can't stand what i can't see
