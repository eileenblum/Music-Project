darkness fills your mind with thoughts of life's immortal plea 
sacrament as it once was escape finality 
speculate the inner self consequent with much dismay 
freewill itself now prevails as life as life's blood slips away 

signs of life grow stronger as the end is drawing near 
release my inner anguish now beyond the realm of fear 
afterlife expectant held tobe true to my belief 
domination forbids me to retrieve 

the prophecies have been fulfilled as you've been here before 
internal fate lies listlessnow death is the only open door 
dormant stage of lifeless ways held congruent to its plight 
ways of old now foretold hidden deep behind the light 
hidden truth unseen by those of everlasting faith 
born you're daed as you live a second price to pay 
time the only vital sign did it resolve through me 
insanity my prophecy what do i need to be free 

signs of life grow stronger as the end is drawing near 
release my inner anguish now beyond the realm of fear 
afterlife expectant held tobe true to my belief 
domination forbids me to retrieve 

reality destiny take my life but give to me 
inner strength to sanctify show me signs of life 

living lives of contradiction held to reality by addiction 
bloodstained visions of a future time where life is death 
i've crossed the line 
coincidental my life to pass carved in stoneto make it last 
release the signs show the way the message carried to another day 

signs of life grow stronger as the end is drawing near 
release my inner anguish now beyond the realm of fear 
afterlife expectant held tobe true to my belief 
domination forbids me to retrieve
