Looking for eternity
Of life through the word of God
Innocent people are taken in
While others just choose to ignore
Saying they can heal you just by the touch of their hand
Sitting back, they're getting rich spreading their disease all over the land
Leading you but not the right way
Once they've got your mind
They'll cast you astray
Fame and fortune are all that they seek
Raping your mind as they're destroying the weak

Caught up in a false occult
Where religion can be blind
The words of God are twisted now
And fed into your mind
You're give your life to save your soul
The chosen one now takes control
Satan's your savior, he's your master
Perish in flames as your burning faster
Leading you but not the right way
Once they've got your mind they'll cast you astray
Fame and fortune is all that they seek
Raping your mind they're destroying the weak
