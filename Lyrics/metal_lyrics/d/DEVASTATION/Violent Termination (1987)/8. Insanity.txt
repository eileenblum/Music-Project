Fighting the feeling of torment
That dwells within your brain
Locked up in this padded cell
They've labeled you insane
Our world is nothing more to you
Than a game of life and death
Seeking pleasure as you watch
Your victim's die slow death

Insanity what's in your head
We now see that your brain is dead
Demented mind ruling over you
Now there's nothing left to do

Killed and killed again
But that's your twisted way
Menace to the normal view
But in this (in this) cell you'll stay
There is no escape for you
This torture must go on
For this is the price you pay
For a violent crime so wrong

Feeling your leaving your world behind
Body being ruled by an empty mind
Your living is sanity
Death is your final plea

Probing intrusions
Deep within your brain
Try to find the reason why
You've gone insane
No answer to your problem
Your just meant to be
A victim of society
Only death will set you free

Insanity what's in your head
We now see that your brain is dead
Demented mind ruling over you
Now there's nothing left to do

Feeling your leaving your world behind
Body being ruled by an empty mind
Your living is sanity
Death is your final plea
