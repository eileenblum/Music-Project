Taking your mind they fill it
Taking your life and kil it
Twisting your dreams into lies
Controlling your mind whenever
Changing your life forever
You'll never escape them never
Putting your world in sin
Evil lurks within
Their deadly lessons begin
Killing you with their madness
Leaving a trail of sadness
Death is the only way out

You must die by their hand tonight

Leading you to your grave
You know you can't be saved
Don't even try to escape
Death hides in many places
Striking terror on the faces
Of those who seek their revenge
Killing for their rights
Your death is their despise
An ultimate goal of corruption
The battle's never won
These maniacs have just begun
Spreading they syndrome of terror throughout

You must die by my hand tonight
