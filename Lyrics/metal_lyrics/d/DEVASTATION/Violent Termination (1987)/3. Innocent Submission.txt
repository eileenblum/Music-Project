Here me now these words of creed
Your mind and body are what I need
For I can give you the key to be free
Don't listen to his blasphemy
They gather in masses to praise the one
No lives will be spared when he's done
Death is certain in their eyes
Ignore their pleas and their cries
Give to me your destiny,
Hatred and deceit
For you are the chosen ones, and I will set you free
Your head is filled with fear
You know that death is near
Don't you try to flee
Your soul now belongs to me
Another day. Another soul
I'll take your life and gain control
Death's deception growing near
Corruption of your brain is here
