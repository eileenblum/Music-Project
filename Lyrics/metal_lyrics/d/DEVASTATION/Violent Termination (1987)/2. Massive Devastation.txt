We are now living on the nuclear age
This world once ours is now our deadly cage
We've pushed ourselves so far now there's no turning back
Existence will end at the next nuclear attack

Massive devastation 
Mankind has sealed his fate
Massive devastation
No remorse it's now too late

Who'll see heaven who'll feel hell
The decisions ours only time will tell
Our lives are lead by our own decision
We're victims of our own freewill
Ignorant people who try to hide
Keep the truth in the back of their mind
They know their fate but are afraid to face it
Taking their lives for granted They don't want to die

Massive devastation 
Mankind has sealed his fate
Massive devastation
No remorse it's now too late

The sky turns black the sun explodes
People are frying on the roads
The earth is burnt to the crust
Bodies are instantly turning to dust

Now is the time the last battles come
The war is over and nobody won
No lives were spared every soul was lost
This is the end it's the final holocaust

Massive devastation
It's total annihilation
Massive devastation
The end of our creation
