Condemned to die
Destiny for them was planned
A violent leader pledged to kill
A race thought insuperior
Lead to the slaughter of millions
Camps of death formed throughout the land
Killing of innocent people due to one man's hand

Submitted them into the furnace
They were left to die
Devastating slaying of people
But do we understand why
Now that the lives are lost
Will we learn from the mistake
Or shall we many more perish
Receiving such and unjust fate
Dying taking their lives as the people stand 
and watch their children burn in flames
Crying screaming out in agony as the chosen ones 
are sented (sentenced) to a lifelong early grave
