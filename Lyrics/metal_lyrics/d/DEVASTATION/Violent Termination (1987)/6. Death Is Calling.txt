Pressure building up inside your head
You can't deal with the agony of life
Unable to handle the problems that you face
So you turn to an alternative escape
Usage of substances that now controlling you
Deteriorating your mind and your body too
Internal acceptance of a critical reply
A tragic destiny lies waiting you

Death is calling
But your ignoring
Your mind is falling
Into the unknown
It's life you seek
But your too weak
Addicted now
You've let drugs control your life

Point of inception will this be your last
You've forgotten all the hell you went through in the past
Easy is the answer false is the way
Artificial relief no permanent escape
Signals from hell appearing in your mind
Deadly message warning it's your time
Blaming your problems theres just no excuse
Now you are dead from this abuse

Death is calling
But your ignoring
Your mind is falling
Into the unknown
It's life you seek
But your too weak
Addicted now
You've let drugs control your life
Now the time for you to die

Loss of reality nothing here is real
Pleasure turns pain as you begin to kill
Accidental murder you are going away
Revenge is certain you are going to pay
