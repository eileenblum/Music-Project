Living your life like theres no tomorrow
Caught up on this world of sin
Every single day just beg and borrow
Playing a game that you just can't win

Constructing your life you manipulate
Planning your will make your escape
Nothing is certain for you but death
Now's the time to put you at your rest

Death is here at last
Now there's no second chance
Looking him eye to eye
Now is your time to die

MEET YOUR MAKER

Though you though you would never se
Your final day happening
No time no escape just indecision
Unable to relieve yourself from this position

While on earth you killed and maimed
Life to you was just a game
Your now the victim as I see
The final verdict will be by me

Death is here at last
Now there's no second chance
Looking him eye to eye
Now is your time to die

MEET YOUR MAKER

The verdict has just been passed
Can't you see your dying fast
Your bodys going to rot in hell
And there's no saving you now
