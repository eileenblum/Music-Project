blizzards blast through my veins 
smear the blood across my teeth
sins of my father buried beneath

a coward not to face his true end
an empty burial from within 
a thorn for every sin
black

damnation, my solace
day to night, my soul to ash,
carry me on this black wind

baptized in night by hand of bone
slave
