this is not about right and wrong
this is not about good and evil
this is about progression

blind to ignorance and bullshit tradition
fuck your weakness
clouded minds infect this world

a circle of escapism, apathy takes hold
no place to turn, you throw your life away
a human void, you drown in your self-pity
becoming the shit you consume
you are everything i fucking hate

people suffer, endless torture
not alone but fucking close, 
everyday hangs another noose
separate myself from poison

there are some places light won't reach

not alone but fucking close, 
everyday hangs another noose
separate myself from poiso
