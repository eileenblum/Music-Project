It keeps me alive
Makes me stand 
When i wanted to die
It lifts my head
Whispers you must live
As light leaves my eye
I bleed and I dream
While my heart slows within
Every failing pain 
Pulled through a hole
Inside my skin

Back down here, in the pit of me

Slowly I breathe 
My eyes are open 
Im awake again
Everything locked in
Stuck inside the body
I'm awake again
Broken teeth
Bleeding white wall
Look at me again
Slowly i breathe 
my eyes are open
Im awake again
