I circled the center with a  blue halo crown
Traced shapes in the sky, then shot them back down 
Made man in one day, then rested the rest of the week
I sentenced my tongue to a prison of teeth
I toed the line in faith of divine 
Pulled my coffin lid tight, and shot wings from my spine
I soared towards the sun, I burned down in ash
I felt power in my hands, and let it slip from my grasp.
