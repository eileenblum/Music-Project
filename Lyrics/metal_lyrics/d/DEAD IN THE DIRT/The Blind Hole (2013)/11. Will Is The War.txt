The mind is a jaw 
Teeth gnashed to the gum
The body is a failure
Lungs collapse when overrun
The will is the war
Scabs turn to scar
The skin makes you sick
Feathered and tarred
Words are the cancer
Once arranged they are null
Your fists may pound flesh
But all strikes are dull
The only truth 
The instant of death
We the living in instants 
Suffer eternally clawing for scraps of existence 
In search of the eternal breathâ¦
