Born in the blackest sea, the king of desolation
He holds the keys to devastation
Haunting the darkest depths, in search of revocation
1000 years of isolation

Walk, now with me...to the void of no return
See, what I see...the rite had begun

Vengeance is what we seek, in blood and heresy
Malicious death reside in me
Devoured by lunacy, pitch black monstrosity
We've done this just to set you free

We call you on this night old one to reclaim your throne and majesty
Slither forth from your tomb your hunger shall be sated by the coming dawn
Lands will grey devils revel and obey as your kingdom rises from the dark
Chaos rules over all and humanity shall fall, to depravity and your sins
