Forgotten visions of a thousand hearts demise
Reflections of the horror right before their eyes
Mindless Revenants summon the undead
Bring forth upon this night a veil of dread
As we gaze from out dark, ungodly thrones
Monolithic visions still remain unknown
A revelation overcomes the driven mind
Everything that lives must also die

Through war and glory a light that shall not fail
Flying free with a death's head on the sail
We were born of a tragedy bred of fear
Violent ending to a prisoner, austere
Fetid corpses on an altar left to rot
Held captive by their memories, forgot
His minions feed on this death and decay
My faith dissolves as they drag me away

THRASHED TO FUCKING DEATH

The soul extends beyond the reach of mortal flesh
Echoed in the mind shackled by this death
Pain descends as the final curtain falls
Waiting for the shades a priestly blessing dawns
Abandoned by your savior shadowed in defeat
Entangled violently eternal soul besieged
My mind is his as I take my final breath
No matter what I'm thrashed to fucking death

THRASHED TO FUCKING DEATH
