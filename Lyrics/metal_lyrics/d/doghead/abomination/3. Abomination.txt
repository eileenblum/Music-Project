The wasteland that you call your mind is filthy with disease
Flogged to death, euphoria the scourge remains within your dreams
The longer the throes of madness stay the flesh forgets to sing
Scant amusement unfulfilled I love to hear your suffering

From beneath the maelstrom feeds
Dark waters twist your soul
Your sanity un-intangible
Hurled to the frantic shored
You breathe your own betrayal
To see your angels fall
Cut the throat of celestial thieves
Unleash hell upon the world
They strike as rabid dogma
To exalt the throne of lies
The old ones are loathe to come
Despite the horror before their eyes

Let the veil of grace fall from you eyes
From the dark recesses of your mind
The hounds will stalk you blindly
They will find the weakness in your soul
Relentless they will break your sanity

I breath annihilation
On the wings of desolation
A psychopathic soul unstitched
A paradigm of demon's bliss
Flame wrought Shangri-La undone
Welcomes all to devastation
Devoured by the gods who've fell
We shall not survive
