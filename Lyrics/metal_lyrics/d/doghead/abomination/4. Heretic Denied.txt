I've lived as a god amongst the creeping flock of man
A demon of the flesh I stand
Alas it's true, the beast you knew found breath anew
Along the heartstrings of your soul

Your eyes roll to black, the great deceiver you despise
You'll soon realize I'm more than that
You relent, and like a driven beast of prey
I will break your fucking faith

Succumb to your wicked nemesis
Delight of sweet paralysis
I take control you can't deny I do exist
Lust for damnation, pray for salvation and demise
The black smoke swirls within your mind
Your life is mine...

Awake in a sweat, forsake pleasure for regret
The choirs they sing of your lament
The heretic, so denied your sacrifice
The great deceiver you despise
Flee, demon flee I cast the out please leave me be
I wont relent just set me free
You are my slave, the beast inside is all you crave
For we are one where is your faith?
