I can remember as a child
When no one could play with me
In the attic I would hide
Were my mind set me free

Up the stairs with my favourite toy
A dog with the softest of furs
All the days he gave me joy
And my fantasy took place

Walking trough the wakening woods
The treetop filters the sun
Beams of light cross my path
And it filled my soul with fun

Welcome to my magic forest
Were fantasy and truth collide
Welcome to my magic forest
There's need for you to hide

On the ground a carpet of green
That softens the narrow way
Creatures that you seldom see
Are whispering to me to stay

Underneath the old oak tree
Below the trailing root
A silver stream is floating free
Pouring tunes on its lusty flute

Welcome to my magic forest
Were fantasy and truth collide
Welcome to my magic forest
There's need for you to hide

It's all in the air
I feel their presence now
So divine and fair

Welcome to my magic forest
Were fantasy and truth collide
Welcome to my magic forest
There's need for you to hide

On meadows were I take my chance
The fog fills all the air
Elves seduce me with their dance
Surrounds me with golden hair

Slowly I return from sleep
Walls around me again
Just happiness and I won't weep
Just me and my best friend
