Emptiness and hollow
Nothingness and pain
Twisted mind that won't regret
Coming around again
Evil thoughts, entwines the lies
A forest where trees have eyes
Watching me, from far behind
But there is nothing there to find

To grieve and mourn, the loss of souls
Can't judge what's true or sane
Walk the street, of loneliness
But I will come back again

Still see them, their faces, can hear them
Sneaking up on me
No heroes, no justice, all victims
It's a sabotage

Crippled scared, and unaware
Of what I have become
No one to help, or even care
As I wish of the life beyond

Can someone put, an end to this
Fear of never being heard
Look at me I'm brittle as glass
Crying out an empty word

Still see them, their faces, can hear them
Sneaking up on me
No heroes, no justice, all victims
It's a sabotage

Emptiness and hollow
Nothingness and pain
Twisted mind that won't regret
Coming around again

I try to think of now, not then
As I try to live my life
A house, a car, my dog named Ben
A lovely daughter and a wife

But how I seek, it echoes still
The torture that went on
It forces me to look back
At my endless marathon

Still see them, their faces, can hear them
Sneaking up on me
No heroes, no justice, all victims
It's a sabotage
