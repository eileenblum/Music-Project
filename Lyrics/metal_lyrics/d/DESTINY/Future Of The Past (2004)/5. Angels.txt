Lay down still, you won't fight no more
The battle is over, you reached the sacred shore

Now arise, let heaven free your mind

During countless years the journey took place
Never-ending illness scarred and marked your face

Swim the oceans of time
Let the waves rinse your eyes so blind
Forever hope you'll find
Long lost love and peace of mind

Young and innocent, never meant no wrong
In cold December snowflakes sang their song

Swim the oceans of time
Let the waves rinse your eyes so blind
Forever hope you'll find
Long lost love and peace of mind

Nightfall was your friend of gloom
Safely rocked in the crystal womb
By the altar I wept
Unleashed emotions, I overstepped

Refugees in heaven, not written in the rune
Sometime the gods call their angels back to soon

Tormented in the incessant fire
Purgatory is flaming higher
Burn the anguish and hate
To thirst for redemption is not to late

Swim the oceans of time
Let the waves rinse your eyes so blind
Forever hope you'll find
Long lost love and peace of mind

So this is the innuendo
Choirs of angels in crescendo
Heartbeats like a drum
Realise the time has come

Refugees in heaven, not written in the rune
Sometime the gods call their angels back to soon
