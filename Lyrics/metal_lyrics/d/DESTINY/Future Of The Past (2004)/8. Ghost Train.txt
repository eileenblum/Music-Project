I really don't know if it is yours to find
But something you did put a spell on my mind
I'm beauty, you're beast, and I'm your angel of death
I'm haunting your mind with horrors in my breath

Ride the Ghost train; Fix the Ghost Train of my mind
You've got something there to find
Ride the Ghost train; Fix the Ghost Train of my mind
You've got something there to find

Investigate my soul till you can't find no more
Can it be you who will give me the cure?
An eternal time is running through my veins
The wicked old vampire is out of his domain

He will come for you, and there is nothing you can do
Flying high, the bat is out tonight

Ride the Ghost train; Fix the Ghost Train of my mind
You've got something there to find
Ride the Ghost train; Fix the Ghost Train of my mind
You've got something there to find

[The Vampire]
Step out of the light
Join the everlasting night

Lifeless by the dawn
We are all Satan's spawn

[Vampire Mob]
"Creeping, crawling, digging in the mud
We are doomed to thirst for your blood
Creeping, crawling, digging in the mud
Swimming in the sinners' flood"

I will be present wherever you'll go
But my footprints won't show in the snow
My long lost love, you're back into my life
Once again we will be husband and wife

In life or death will you take side?
Will you be my dying bride?

Ride the Ghost train; Fix the Ghost Train of my mind
You've got something there to find
Ride the Ghost train; Fix the Ghost Train of my mind
You've got something there to find

[Vampire Mob]
"Come on down, to a lower ground
Forever together, forever lost in time"
"Come on down, to a lower ground
Forever together, forever lost in time"
