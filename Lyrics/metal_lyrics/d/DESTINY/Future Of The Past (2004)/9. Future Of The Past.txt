Born of woman Daikini Child
Escaped with maiden into the wild
Set out dogs, try to hunt them down
Float with the stream away from evil harm
Elves and fairies lead the way
Swordsman free, led to stray

When the Phantom Queen arises
In her fiery crimson might
She will conquer land and earth
To sons of sin, she will give birth

Hear the calls, from nowhere
All around you, everywhere
Screams in the air
At the gates, sent from hell
Trolls and demons in darkness dwell
They guard the spell

Can you trust the stranger in a cage
When the Phantom Queen arises
Eerie strangers wander trough the night
Future of the past brings light

Terror and fear in no mans land
Deceiving offspring who won't take a stand
Firstborn of witch, she is sent to kill
Soldier of destiny, their blood will be spilled
Misty shadow spreading fear
Wormhole army in grimy gear

Whisper the prophesy out at night
Death upon thee who will not fight
Storm the castle at full speed
Show no mercy, even if they plead

Hear the calls, from nowhere
All around you, everywhere
Screams in the air
At the gates, sent from hell
Trolls and demons in darkness dwell
They guard the spell

Can you trust the stranger in a cage
When the Phantom Queen arises
Eerie strangers wander trough the night
Future of the past brings light

Men of glory, their faith to be
Killed in battle at Teraslin
Deep from dungeons the prisoners moan
A child is born to retake the throne

Hear the calls, from nowhere
All around you, everywhere
Screams in the air
At the gates, sent from hell
Trolls and demons in darkness dwell
They guard the spell

Can you trust the stranger in a cage
When the Phantom Queen arises
Eerie strangers wander trough the night
Future of the past brings light
