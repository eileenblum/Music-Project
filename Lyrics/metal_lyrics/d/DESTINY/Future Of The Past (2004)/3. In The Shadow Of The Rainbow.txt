When nothing will be the same
What can stop the cry-outs of pain
The end has come for the warhorse crusade
No one can hide in this masquerade

Someone says the end is near
But we've got nothing left to fear
Deliver us from torture
Deliver us from pain

Can you feel the fear tonight
Waves of thunder roar
We are blinded by the light
Here comes atomic war

Blinded by the cloudy heavens
Gazing at the blood red sky
Falling rain will wash our skin
Atomic winter is closing in

Iron bird sound, a piercing wall
Waiting for the heavens to fall
Deliver us from waiting
Deliver us to peace

Can you feel the fear tonight
Waves of thunder roar
We are blinded by the light
Here comes atomic war

Slowly but surely poisoning the soil
Calmly making its pace
Come heaven, come hell the power that bends
Raging battle has come to an end

Pierced by concrete, iron and lead
Ended humanity's maidenhead
Deliver us from suffering
Deliver us to god

Can you feel the fear tonight
Waves of thunder roar
We are blinded by the light
Here comes atomic war
