Behold the mirror of infinity
Do nothing wrong, entrust the blasphemy
As we linger on to life itself
Take the answers, put them on the shelf, on the shelf

Why does god keep on tormenting me?
Just give in and I will set you free
Hide the truth in bad disguise
Swift, remove the mask from your eyes, from your eyes

Light, love, joy, hide it in the misery
Smear, shame, plague, let me be

You feel as clear as a broken glass
Roaring engines filled up with gas
Speeding down the wrong way
When you're there it will be hell to pay, hell to pay

Don't trust the words of the holy liar
He's not saintly that stinking friar
All your money he will spend
Let the crap come down to an end, to an end

Light, love, joy, hide it in the misery
Smear, shame, plague, let me be

[The Friar]
"Come to me my child
In the chapel I'll make you wild
Give your flesh to me
No this is love, not blasphemy"

"Do Not Scream"

The huckster keeps on pushing stuff
But no one notices that it's a bluff
Wake up from your sarcophagus
Please, we beg, come to deliver us, deliver us

Light, love, joy, hide it in the misery
Smear, shame, plague, let me be
