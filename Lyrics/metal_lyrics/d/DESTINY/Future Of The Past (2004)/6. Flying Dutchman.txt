To the man that was lost at sea
See him leaving the comforting land
Icy wind rips the deep apart
His vessel gaining on the roaring waves

Don't go to far, stay close to the ground
No one to save you if trouble occurs
The sound of his loved one echoed in his head
Just today, never again

Nevermore, never again
Man lost at sea
Sank into the deep
Now his spirit's free
Nevermore, never again
Man lost at sea
Fought all night long
The sirens calling me

Screaming, roaring a cry for help
The wind is whipping the dark to white
Taste the sea, the salty foam
Pushed into a void of oblivion

Tortured by the will of the violent storm
Trying not to lose his grip
Sinking deeper into his grave
Just today, never again

Nevermore, never again
Man lost at sea
Sank into the deep
Now his spirit's free
Nevermore, never again
Man lost at sea
Fought all night long
The sirens calling me

All is quiet, soft and warm
On the horizon a vessel of ghosts
Resting upon a mirror of streams

Not one move, not a sound on deck
Just the wind whispering the nightmare
Rest the truth that no one will know
Just today, never again
Just today, never again

Nevermore, never again
Man lost at sea
Sank into the deep
Now his spirit's free
Nevermore, never again
Man lost at sea
Fought all night long
The sirens calling me

Nevermore, never again
Man ceased to be
Sank into the deep
The sirens calling me
