I'm sorry if I dropped the ball again
You will never be my long lost friend
If we shall go on this way
Someone will have to pay, for this mess
And it won't be me

I'm standing on the outside, always looking in
Standing in a corner, to watch you cause the sin

To commit the worst of crimes
Disgrace and shame are blessings in my world
Sign the deal in blood
An obligation you never can slow down
I didn't read the fine print

I'm standing on the outside, always looking in
Standing in a corner, to watch you cause the sin
I'm standing on the outside, always looking in
Standing in a corner, to watch you cause the sin

Some things cannot be undone
We just have to move on
Carry on with our lives
How we want it to be
Praying to god
That our life is not a fraud
All the glamour and hurt
Lose the dreams in the dirt

Perpetually in life we learn
Being dissident we yearn
When the deal is signed
You can't rewind, your life
Baptised in holy water

I'm standing on the outside, always looking in
Standing in a corner, to watch you cause the sin
I'm standing on the outside, always looking in
Standing in a corner, to watch you cause the sin

Some things cannot be undone
We just have to move on
Carry on with our lives
How we want it to be
Praying to god
That our life is not a fraud
All the glamour and hurt
Lose the dreams in the dirt
