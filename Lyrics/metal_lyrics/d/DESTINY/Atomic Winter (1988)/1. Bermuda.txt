The triangle, it's a mystery. Disappearing, both ships and planes. What kind of a secret? We can only guess.  In Bermuda, we don't stand a chance.  There must be night, in Bermuda. Use all your light, to find what's going on.  Is it heaven or hell? Only time will tellif it dares to show itself, dares to show itself.  How will we find it? How will we find the key? How will we break the blockof the mystery?  There must be nightin Bermuda. Use all your light. We must have peace of mindand common sense.  And what if we find it, if we find the key. Are we sure we want to open the door to our DESTINY...
