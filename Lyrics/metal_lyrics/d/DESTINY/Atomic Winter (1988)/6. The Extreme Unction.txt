A crowd of people are shouting and screaming. I flinch in fear, I must be dreaming. The judge stares with the eyes of a lizard. The crowd they shout: "Death to the wizard!"  I'm searching the seven. That door isn't heaven. It's leading straight to hell.  Suffer and burn. There's no evidence. Where's my defense. Suffer and burn. What have I done, what the hell is going on.  Looking for heaven, they took me for a raven, in a game with very bad odds. Same words from the priest who looks like a beast, I pray for all the gods.  They're pointing and laughing. "Let him burn", they're shouting. I'm scared, I hear the bell.  Suffer and burn. What have I done, what the hell is going on.  The extreme unction...  Looking for heaven, they took me for a raven, in a game with very bad odds. The extreme unction has not the right function. My soul was already with the gods.
