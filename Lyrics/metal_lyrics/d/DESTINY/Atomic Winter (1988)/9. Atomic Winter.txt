In 2048 there came some desperate waves. They called it war, everything was all right so far.  But when the nations declared that nuclear defense had failed, you could hear the sound of deathwhen it hit the ground.  The human race was doomed. They started to dig them selves underground. Trying to get shelter from the radiation fallout.  It was nearly to late, there was no time to hesitate. Just try to survive, then the snow started to fall.  You know we don't want to die, trying to hide from the nuclear fire. Take your homeless soul and come with us in the unknown.  The migration had just begun, they walked from town to town. Trying to find a responsible person to hang for their pain.  Then they found some fuel. The snow was glowing hard and cruel. The temperature went down to 20 below at most.  You know we don't want to die, trying to hide from the nuclear fire. Take your homeless soul and come with us in the unknown.  They constructed a vessel and down belowthey started to coad it with hard glowing snowto lift them of the earth, to find another home.  Higher and higher they flew awayfrom pain and disease, trying to live in peace.
