The open grave shines of black light. Oh, it hurts my eyes. The wind, it whispers, don't feel fright. I know it's only lies.  Now I know it's time to do my work. I'm protected by the dark. I can hardly walk away from the graveyard. And I hear the wolves howl.  Living dead, it hurts so bad. Can't find a friend. Oh, I feel so sad.  There is the man, I've got a contract on. He starts to run away. I pick up a brick and throw it through the night. I hear the human cry.  There is a victim just in front of me. He starts to beg for me to set him free. But no I can't, I'm tied by the fee.  Living dead, it hurts so bad. Can't find a friend. Oh, I feel so sad.
