In the time when I was born, the human race was at it's dawn. Darkness wiped away the hope. Lightning was my birthwhen fear ruled the earth. It was my mission to take away the pain.  I wasn't given no name at all. Tell me why. I was sent out to fight until I fall. Who am I?  On the edge of danger, on the edge of lies, I feel the powerin my body start to rise. I start to enjoy the killing, I start to enjoy the shockof fighting the devil in disguise.  I wasn't given no name at all. Tell me why. I was sent out to fight until I fall. Who am I?  When I strike the enemyand send him back to hell. I have to pay for the victorywith my soul. I was born to be sacrificed, I was born to be doomed. My destiny was to hang by the gallows pole
