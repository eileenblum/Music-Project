They are fighting on islands. They are fighting at sea. They are fighting for justice. They are fighting for me. I'm not a believer. Thank God for that. They try to use me as a receiverfor their useless chat.  The root of all evilis what we have in mind. I don't know whatthey are trying to find. Maybe the creator of Adam and Eve. But why in hell must they hateeach others beliefs.  Roots of all evil. The roots of our minds. Religion, religion.  One man is for heaven, the other represents hell. And they start to fightwhen they ring the bell. Don't think I'm watchingthis senseless game. For me and my soulthey do just the same.  Roots of all evil. The roots of our minds. Religion, religion.  Black: is the collar of the priest and his voice. Light: is the force he wants to praise. Knight: is the title of the man who does the killing work.  People are ruinedby the collecting man. And the money finances a plan. The meaning of his message is to get you signed on their list of hired minds.  Roots of all evil. The roots of our minds. Religion, religion.  Black: is the collar of the priest and his voice. Light: is the force he wants to praise. Knight: is the title of the man who does the killing work.  Why can't they be satisfiedwith their work with souls? Why must the money take control? The priests are all waitingfor the final cut of the universe.  Roots of all evil. The roots of our minds. Religion, religion.
