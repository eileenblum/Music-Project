It was about midnight, my body was falling apart. I could feel it spread all over the place. It was like a ghost in my veins. My blood was boiling, the heat was cruel. Got to get out from my place. Got to escape from this case.  While I was running my feeling was taken away. I received a message from my mind: "Prepare yourself for the journeywhich you are going to do, the journey into your soul."  The ground started to tremble, suddenly he was there. Pointing the finger he said: "Now you be ware. Welcome to my cave, just follow me. I've got something for you I want you to see..."  I trembled in shock, tried to keep awake. But it was taking over all my mindabout the thing that poisoned me. Still he was nowhere to be found.  The ground started to tremble. Suddenly he was there, pointing the finger he said: "Now you be ware. Welcome to my cave, just follow me. I've got something for you, I want you to see..."
