He needs blood, he needs darkness. He's the count on the hill. He hates sunlight, he hates the cross. He needs you for his survival!  I'm a victim, I'm a victimwaiting for the Spellbreaker.  Don't kiss the strangerwithout a look in the mirror! Suddenly there, suddenly gone! Hey girl! Do you feel the danger? Spellbreaker!  Get Down! Here we come! Lay down! Are you ready to die? Don't strain! It's all in vain. Just scream out in pain! We're going to stab the poleright through his heart. We're going to burn the castleon the top of the hill.  We took the cross, we took the poleand destroyed him forever. But his friends in the night are still there. They have tasted the final kiss. They are victims, they are victimswaiting for the Spellbreaker.
