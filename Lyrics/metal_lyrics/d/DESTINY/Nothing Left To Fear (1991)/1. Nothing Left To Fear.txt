The edgy electric eye controls you day by day,
so nothing in the process can go wrong.
The cloning was a success taking control over human minds.
There are thousands of me and I feel so strong.

Nothing to fear.
I have nothing left to fear.
There will come a day when I'm the only one that exists.
Then I'll be the master of the world.

There has been a rumor that says
I don't have so far to go,
try me dear, I'll show you what I can do.
I am immortality, don't make a big mistake
and try to kill me when I need you so.

Nothing to fear.
I have nothing left to fear.
There will come a day when I'm the only one that exists.
Then I'll be the master of the world.

Now I'm flying high
Now I can't die.
Now I'm all alone.
