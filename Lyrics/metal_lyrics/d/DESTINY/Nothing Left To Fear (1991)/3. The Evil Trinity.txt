Don't leave me now.
I'm all alone here in this world,
no one can help me when the battle begins.
You have to be without sin.
In the crystal ball you see the evil split up in three,
THE TRINITY.

When they march, they have all the might so strong.
When they march, trinity rules all alone.
When they march, try to hide away.

When they come together they are mighty and strong.
I fought them well I fought them all alone.
The demon, the devil and the damned.
I swing my mighty sword,
trying to force them to break their evil pact
trying to save this world.

When they march, they have all the might so strong.
When they march, trinity rules all alone.
When they march, try to hide away.

Now I'm there: fight them with my sword and break the pact
Now I'm there: fight them hard,
fight them well send the trinity down to hell.

When they march, they have all the might so strong.
When they march, trinity rules all alone.
When they march, try to hide away.
When they march, you will never see the day.
