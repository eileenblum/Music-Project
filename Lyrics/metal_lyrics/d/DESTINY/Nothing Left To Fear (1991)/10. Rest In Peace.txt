The soldier in the grave is screaming for vengeance.
What did I fight for, what did I die for?
He's looking for an answer, looking for a clue.
And still he wonders: I really don't know.

Fight for the nation, fight for the peace.
So shut up, get down on your knees.
Fight for the nation, fight for the peace.

Screaming for vengeance, screaming for blood.
Still he wonders: Is there a God?
Give him the answer, give him the clue.
It's a soul on the run and that soul could be you.
So let him rest in peace.

You got to do your best to hate your enemy.
Kill for fun. We're never on the run.
Fight for your life, you have to be brave.
Fight to kill or you are nothing to save.

You better live today, you may be dead tomorrow.
Even if you ask you'll never know the truth.
You only live one time and time can't be borrowed.
And no one will bring back your youth.
