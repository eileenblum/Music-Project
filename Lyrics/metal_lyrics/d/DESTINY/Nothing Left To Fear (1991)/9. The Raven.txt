The deformed wings, the deadly eyes,
his precious head, it has a price.
The bird has a mission here, don't loose your faith.
It will be there.
Feel he's coming to take your soul,
don't you come near him, you won't get old.

And the raven came out from the woods.
For his survival he'll take your blood.

His presence here must be known.
Your veins burn but it's freezing cold.
When his beak breaks through your skin
then you're lost, you can't win.
The salivary secretion he spits in your arm,
takes away your feeling and makes you warm.

And the raven came out from the woods.
For his survival he'll take your blood.

Now draw your bow to destroy him and wipe him away.
Fight for your life and don't make him stay.
It's your decision not to invite him in.
Find another playmate.
Or don't play at all.
