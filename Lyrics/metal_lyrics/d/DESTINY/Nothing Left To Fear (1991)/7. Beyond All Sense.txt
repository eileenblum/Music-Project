It started this night when the rain fell down.
Hush, hear that sound.
She came all the way in, dominating my life.
Now I can't stop her say: "Come and be my strife. "

Now you leave me be woman,
I want nothing from you.

Now she's got me hooked, I'm in her sight, haunted all night.
You're insane, my dear, hang up the phone.
I have nothing to fear, you are all alone.

Now you leave me be woman,
I want nothing from you.

Hear my story, it's for you. It isn't overdone, it's realistic, it's true.
You came into my life when I wasn't on the top,
trying to twist my mind. I thought that you meant well.
Spending nights outside my door, spending nights inside my mind.
I tried to escape from you, somewhere I couldn't be found.
But you reach me wherever I go. Don't preach to me. Oh, I hate you so.
I rather live in solitude then to live with you.
So just lave me be woman,
I want nothing from you.

Now you leave me be woman,
I want nothing from you.
