The feeling of the dangercan get it all aroundIt comes from the strangerthat strange feeling soundThe order from the leadercan put it all to restDon't look out for tomorrowwith that pain in your chest Balance of terrorBalance of terror You can run but you can't hide'cause the land stands open wideTry to get together with yourfriends and mates and together break the lineA flash! Crash!A flash! Crash!The danger comin' nearGet down on the ground and forgetThe sound and try not to show your fear Balance of terrorBalance of terror The bright light in the nighttells me the balance has been movedThe fear of the force thatkills, grinds and woundsWhy vote for unificationthe score's already setThey say you will be happywithout any regrets Balance of terrorBalance of terror You can run but you can't hide'cause the land stands open wideTry to get together with yourfriends and mates and together break the lineA flash! Crash!A flash! Crash! The danger comin' nearGet down on the ground and forgetThe sound and try not to show your fear
