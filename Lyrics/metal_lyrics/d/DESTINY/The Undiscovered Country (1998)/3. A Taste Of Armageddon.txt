The silent sorrow surrounds me
Can't find my own way out
The tomorrow will haunt me
I'm hidden up in the clouds

I'm coming home, I'm flying high again
I'm coming home, you're my dearest friend
Don't lock me out,I have nowhere to go
Don't lock me out, Don't stop this soul deep show

Can you imagine my fear
When you're not available
Why are you not staying here
And make yourself comfortable

This hidden place is my Shang Ri La
This forbidden space is my well
Just come along, inhale and come with me
Don't try to hide from the things you will see 

Now we're on our way
How do you feel my friend
Now we can save the day
It will become a lifelong pretence
This country is made for you and I
Don't betray our secret
It's further up above the sky
There is no place for regrets

When the daylight is going down
Then you have lost the crown 

There's no longer a chance to win
If you wanna stay in sin
You will have to pay the price
For the benefit of feeling nice
The undiscovered country's law
Is fair but also raw
It's no use to run and hide
There is no escape from this ride
now when you have met your soul
face the fact your getting old
No time to lose, do or die
look at yourself, look in the eye

The silent sorrow surrounds me
Can't find my own way out
The tomorrow will haunt me
I'm hidden up in the clouds
