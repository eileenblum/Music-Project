Can you avoid my eyes
I seduce with my desguise

Don't dare to look away
I'm gonna make you stay
There is no resitance left
Come to collect my debts

In the beginning at the age of five
Your soul was strong as a hurricane
I thought you never would or could be mine
That you won't dare to break the line

Lay down on your bed
And I'll kiss that pretty head

Don't dare to look away
I'm gonna make you stay
You can't deny my spell
I'm gonna do you well

See me comin' through the fog
Scary like a rabid dog

You begin to feel good
When I start to drain your blood
I've got you in my hand
And under my command

Look in my eyes and you will see
anything that you never been
Countess of a foreign land
If you just dare too take my hand

Your skin is smooth as peach
And your soul's within my reach

Don't dare to look away
I'm gonna make you stay
My will you can't deny
And then you'll never die

You begin to feel good
When I start to drain your blood
I've got you in my hand
And you're under my command

See me comin through the fog
Scary like a rabid dog

You begin to feel good
When I start to drain your blood
I've got you in my hand
And under my command

You're out in the woods 
and you don't know
you can't get away

I have never feared the darkness
I have never feared the lies
Laying on the ground like mines
Never feared to roll the dice
I have never been disgraced
Never temped by a man

Now your mine...
