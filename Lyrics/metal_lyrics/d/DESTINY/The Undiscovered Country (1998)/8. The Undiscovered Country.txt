The moonlight shadow is searchin' for meYou'd better hide, don't you hear what I sayHe put a spell on me and I can't run away And it's real to meDagger of the mindWhy can't you see Dagger of the mind He is commin closer, I can feel his breathIt's smellin' awful, the smell of death My brain is boiling, the panic it's on it's wayI must delay him so I can be saved by the daysaved by the day He's looking down at me, I can see his eyesI tried to fool him, I was in for a surpriseHe shook my body, he ripped it all apartThis nightmare agony, was eating out my hearteating out my heart  And it's real to meDagger of the mindWhy can't you seeDagger of the mind Every night it's the same thingHe haunts me in my dreamsEvery night I fall asleepHe's there and he is mean I can't get him off my backIt seems he wants my soulHe's eating out my inner spaceI'm getting out of control I can see the light in the end of my dreamsI must go there, got no choice it seemsI know it is my rescue, I got to come inInto the light there is no hate, fear and sin Can't you see it's meDagger of the mindCan't you see it's meDagger of the mind The moonlight shadow is searchin' for meYou'd better hide, don't you hear what I sayHe put a spell on me and I can't run awayI must delay him so I can be saved by the day
