The feeling of the danger
can get it all around
It comes from the stranger
that strange feeling sound
The order from the leader
can put it all to rest
Don't look out for tomorrow
with that pain in your chest

Balance of terror
Balance of terror

You can run but you can't hide
'cause the land stands open wide
Try to get together with your
friends and mates and together break the line
A flash! Crash!
A flash! Crash!
The danger comin' near
Get down on the ground and forget
The sound and try not to show your fear

Balance of terror
Balance of terror

The bright light in the night
tells me the balance has been moved
The fear of the force that
kills, grinds and wounds
Why vote for unification
the score's already set
They say you will be happy
without any regrets

Balance of terror
Balance of terror

You can run but you can't hide
'cause the land stands open wide
Try to get together with your
friends and mates and together break the line
A flash! Crash!
A flash! Crash! 
The danger comin' near
Get down on the ground and forget
The sound and try not to show your fear
