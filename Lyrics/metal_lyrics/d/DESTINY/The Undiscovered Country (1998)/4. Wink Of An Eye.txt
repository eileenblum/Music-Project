I'm tired and old
I wish I was dead and no one could remember me
Now you shall be told a story of the insane: my history

When I look back at my life
I see sorrow and pain
I don't deny if you criticize
My deeds were insane

I never felt
I never cried
with just one look 
everyone dies

I was born by the gates
Mother was proud, she showed me to the crowd
Don't know where I learned to hate
Anger and agony was my headless crown

I never felt
I never cried
with just one look 
everyone dies

There must be someone out there
Who don't feel fear
There must be someone out there
Who dares to come near
To try to end my life
Let me die!

I took service in hell
I got an offer I could not refuse
Tried to come off the spell
They laughed at me, it was no use

I'm fed up on evil feats 
Got nowhere to go
Can't no one see my needs
Put an end to this show 

I never felt
I never cried
with just one look 
everyone dies
