The blood is pumpin' faster
My heart is working hard
It's been so long since last time
You are my latest award
The end is coming closer
I can feel it's on its way
Don't think of the consequenses
Now is no time to pay

You ask me if I enjoy it
Like you pro's always do
I tell her I always like a ride
no matter where or with whom

If I had a chance to regret 
all the things I've done to you
Would you forgive me baby
for the things we'we been going thru'

Don't cry don't weep must try to keep
my care for you in mind

You're not asking me to stay,
why am I losing you
Can't we find another way
to come thru'

You thought you knew me by now
But you never knew me at all
Don't sing the blues for me baby
Like you do every time I call

Don't cry don't weap must try to keep
my care for you in mind

You're not asking me to stay,
why am I losing you
Can't we find another way
to come thru'

You're not asking me to stay,
why am I losing you
Can't we find another way
to come thru'
