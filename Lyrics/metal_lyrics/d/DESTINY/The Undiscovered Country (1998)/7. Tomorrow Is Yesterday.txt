Your nature tells me that your lying
Why does my mind say that you are wrong
Can't you let be, what has been
leave the past and try to get along

My tomorrow is your yesterday
take it away

Tears from the children
wet down the flames
Burning around them
don't forget their names

What you say now can be proved
It is a ghostflash in your mind
Why try to keep us separated
It's all against the human way

My tomorrow is your yesterday
my tomorrow is your yesterday

Don't try to tell me it's alright to burn a human
Don't try to tell me it's alright to kill the poor
Don't try to tell me it's alright to shut your eyes
Don't try to tell me it's alright to close the door

Tears from the children
wet down the flames
Burning around them
don't forget their names

Your tomorrow is my yesterday...
