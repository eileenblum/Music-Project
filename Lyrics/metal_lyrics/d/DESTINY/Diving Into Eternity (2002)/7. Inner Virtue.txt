The consciousness and the rest crush me
A sea full of wounds inside of me breaks the waves of the painful hope
And the whispering echo draws me in the rising red sky
And my eyes will run
The scars on me are carved for you
And how can I shine
My burning lips won't kiss again
Waiting ardently to embrace the day with all my devotion
Watching the sky and being wrapped in thoughts
I follow my feelings
I distrust you
My internal loyalty paints my beliefs into my heart
Relishing this moment to burst open the frame
Emotions burn pictures out of my heart
This is my passion
My unconditional love
