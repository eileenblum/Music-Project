Is it a revolving disc that we give each other
Does the path that accompanies me lead to sense to a moment
Warmth lies in dark freezing eyes
Eyes that speak a tricky language
Tasting the leading drop
The drop that allows me to speak from the deepest conviction
A wave that nips every rock in the bud
In the intoxication of warmth
I relearned to inspire courage and willpower in a puppet-like figure
Being somebody's slave
Used by others
A new pedestal has been cast
It was sketched by hope and confidence
Riding on a merry-go-round of passion
Dreaming and never waking up again
I woke up
