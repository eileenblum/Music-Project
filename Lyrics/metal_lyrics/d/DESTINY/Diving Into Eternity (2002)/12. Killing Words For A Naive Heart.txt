I take a look into my heart
Filled by days of remorse
I want to feel you
But I can't touch you
I'm lost in devotion
A love that suffers
A love like hate
And I'm longing to die
Longing for death
Never trust you could love
This naive heart once broken
I'm sorry
It's over
I'm gone
And I will live this love forever


Thanks to xpeterx for sending track #5 lyrics.
