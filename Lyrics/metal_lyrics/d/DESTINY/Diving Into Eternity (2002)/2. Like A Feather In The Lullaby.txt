Do you feel the sorrow of the sun
Do you hear it crying
It's burning in my sight
I've got a wish that drowns me in melancholy
To put it back into your empty arms
In stormy nature
Under a crying sky the sun leaves me
A new notch carved that I follow
I notice that a voice is absent in the melody
If this composition tears
It tears me up
The tone of silence is the sound of all possibilities
Everything sounds possible out of it
And has already dried that tear
And the tone sounds
I love this tone
