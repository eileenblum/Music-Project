I want to be part of your dream
You are the title of my story
No word can replace my disappointment
I'm lost in guilt
I want to reach you
Drown my conscience in compassion
Fill my heart with hope
Save our day before it falls into oblivion
My desire cries for peace of mind
And my heart will burn in the fire of liberty
I want to look inside you
I want to get inside you
I want to protect you
The fear inside of me begins to bleed
Remember the day that carries dreams
I don't want this dream to die
And I will sacrifice
Look right at the sky and imagine how it would be without it
Close your eyes and imagine not to feel my nearness around you
When the sky comes falling I'll be waiting for you
And with this my story ends
