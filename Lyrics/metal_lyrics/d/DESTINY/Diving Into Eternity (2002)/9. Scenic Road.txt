I'm sitting here n the middle of a meadow
In the nowhere
I breathe the scent of a ray field
Imagining how it would be to feel closeness around me
A song in my head
Revived by an illusion that ends in a quiet fall
I'm standing here looking down the cliff
My fingertips sink into the streams of the wind
I see this
That I am
My trembling hands are lead by a breeze
Inside it I'm accompanied by a soft strength
Disappointment is the end of deception
