Before someone is taken out of his dreams
Before all good and bad on earth start its turn
Sun rises first
No one asks for it
It shines for all
To give someone
To give something
The feeling to be a part of the day
Clouds change their faces and all good and bad does the same
So many things stir you up and will never be understood
The world is crying
But my virtuoso vision of life inside my heart
Wakes my hope to be a part of this wonderful day
Again and again
Imagine this feeling
I don't dream it
I live it
