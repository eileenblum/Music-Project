The needle that hurts my heart is getting deeper and deeper
This time so short seems to be infinite so long
But it's so beautiful
And this journey will find its end too
The circumstances even allow it to talk about feelings
Sometimes I think that my heart is filled with my hope and drowned in your compassion
Hopefully just a misunderstanding
Everything I want is inside of you
Everything I dream of lies in your heart
All of my dreams
And the night in your eyes there is a star that shines for me
And it hurts for a lifetime
Like an angel that holds and carries me
And love lets me fall
I stagger
My hand's embrace your body weak
I don't want to hurt you
Silence surrounds us
We look at each other
But our thoughts in this moment stay hidden
I die for you
