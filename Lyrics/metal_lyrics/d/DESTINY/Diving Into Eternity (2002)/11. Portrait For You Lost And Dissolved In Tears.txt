I don't need your words
I hear them everytime I die
This confirmation... leave me here
The sound of disappointment
The power of hate
The will for an end
Warmth is freezed to death
This feeling died with me
Dead blood flows through my heart
So cold
So dark
Living in dead days
Fallen words
Broken letters
It's just a cheat of my sensation
You cannot break this heart of stone
I don't believe in this hateful love
A war between love and hate
There's more indifference than affection
Take this life and end the feeling of being alive
