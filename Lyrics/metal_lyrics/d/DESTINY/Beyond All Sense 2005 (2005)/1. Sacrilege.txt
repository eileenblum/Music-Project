["I got this idea when I saw an old movie where the Vikings invaded England" / HÃ¥kan Ring]

In a hamlet far away with Christians
lives an old man so wise
With power so strong he watched
Kingdoms fall and rise.

Then came the strong men from the north
with only destruction on their minds:
Kill, rob, rape and burn.

When he looked into the Crystal ball,
he wondered why.
Learning that this freedom's going to fall
and his people about to die.

This people lived in peace
with happiness and freedom.
The children played together
and love was a natural thing.

Sacrilege. Sacrilege. Sacrilege. Sacrilege.

Savages from north came with swords,
hungry for the treasures.
Gold and silver, female slaves and blood
just for the sake of pleasure.

The old man so wise,
killed a beast - a sacrifice
and prayed to his idol...
Blew away the nightmare.

Sacrilege. Sacrilege. Sacrilege. Sacrilege.

A blaze, a voice:
You evil, forever I make you blind!
Return to hell!
You evil, forever I take your mind!

This people lived in peace
with happiness and freedom.
The children played together
and love was a natural thing.

Sacrilege. Sacrilege. Sacrilege. Sacrilege.
