X and Y together
joined - made him forever.
The embryo was growing.
Oh no! It's glowing.

X-ray beams discovered
what science couldn't cover.
A first borne of this nature.
Who my creator?

Power by birth,
stronger than the curse
Power by birth,
stronger than the curse

The birth of this creation
astonished the population.
A galaxy liberator,
a new kind - of invader.

A human race defender
made the dawn - surrender.
A golden gate to freedom.
Long live his kingdom.
