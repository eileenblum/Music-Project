He needs blood, he needs darkness.
He's the count on the hill.
He hates sunlight, hates the cross.
He needs you for his survival!

Spellbreaker

Don't kiss the stranger
without a look in the mirror!
Suddenly there, suddenly gone!
Hey girl!
Do you feel the danger?

Waiting for the
Spellbreaker

Get Down! Here we come!
Lay down! Are you ready to die?
Don't strain! It's all in vain.
Just scream out in pain!

We're going to stab the pole
right through his heart.
We're going to burn the castle
on the top of the hill.

We're going to stab the pole
right through his heart.
We're going to burn the castle
on the top of the hill.

We took the cross, we took the pole
and destroyed him forever.
But his friends in the night
They have tasted the final kiss.
They are victims. They are victims

Waiting for the
Spellbreaker.
