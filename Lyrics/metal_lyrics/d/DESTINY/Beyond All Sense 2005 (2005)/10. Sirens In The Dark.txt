In 1682 there was nothing they could do.
A ship full of people sank to the bottom.

Sirens - In the dark.

A Laugh of joy, the sailors was their toys.

Cold and rain, screams of pain.
Hell - not heaven, blinded by beauty.

Sirens - In the dark

Beauty, beauty. Here I come.
I'm far away from home.

Eternal sleep down in the deep.
Someone is collecting souls.
Calling - Why were they calling
