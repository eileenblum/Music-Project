Living in a future that was not meant for me.
People all around me. I got nowhere to flee
The eyelid of the camera points at every pace
Wishes to see something, there's just an empty face

I lived in sorrow
The demon in mind

Times long forgotten it still haunts my head
Years of resilience, someday all end up dead
In moronic oceans, I'm trapped I can't get out
Wickedness and horror will get me there's no doubt

I lived in sorrow
Wash the demons of my mind

There's no way out
Stand up and shout
There's no way out

When the earth was younger there were so many things
My life was a riddle but I saw an opening
Community of madness I thought it was the way
Troubles all and over I knew I couldn't stay

I lived in sorrow
Wash the demons of my mind

There';s no way out
Stand up and shout
There's no way out
Stand up and shout
