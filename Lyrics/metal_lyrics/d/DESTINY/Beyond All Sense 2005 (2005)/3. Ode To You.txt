Nothing stays the same.
On whom can we put the blame?
Some will live and some will die,
repeating the question: Why?

A flood of tears and an aching lie
It must not happen, no one should die

A flood of tears that should not be
Nevermore a killing spree

Ref.
Ode to You
Fallen One
Plague the deeds to come

Day after day the dread gets swept away
The end is not so far, so try to reach the star

A flood of tears and an aching lie
It must not happen, no one should die

A flood of tears that should not be
Nevermore a killing spree

Livin' it! Yes, I'm livin' it!
