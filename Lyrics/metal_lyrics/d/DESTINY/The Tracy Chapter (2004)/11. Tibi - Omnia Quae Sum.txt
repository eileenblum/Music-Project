Seized by your smile with your voice as beautiful. When you call my name I watch
myself dying. So kill me. The beautiful tatste of death lingers upon your lips. I hear
you name every single day. Your face in my mind. We're sharing words with each
other. Feeling my heart drumming its final beat. Relive me with the assurance of our
emotion. Every part of me within you has passed by. Living on the other line. Dead to
you. Preserving what you adored. Still carrying a picture of you with me.
