Loved without any condition only to have this heart ripped out. With every hope comes
more fear. All that's given was taken away. You turned your back come after I opened
up my heart to you. Loved with all certainty just to find a place in your heart. Left to
watch my world fall apart in your hands. Left to watch my life perish inside your
heart. But watch if you missed this life to love. But what if you missed this love to live.
