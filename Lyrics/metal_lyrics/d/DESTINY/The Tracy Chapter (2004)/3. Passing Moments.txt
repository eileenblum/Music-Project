Why do your eyes shun me. And why does your presence paralyse me. Why don't you
look back on those days. Losing myself inside my heart you die with me. And with the
pain of longing the flower of passion has withered. The search for sensuality lost in disappointment. Fallen because of
worries and caught by depressions. Despair is my
companion. The heardsman of my suffering. And here are some words for you. I don't
want to love you anymore. I search my heart hoping not to find you. Love just a satisfying word. Just a lie. These
moments will pass bye. Goodbye.
