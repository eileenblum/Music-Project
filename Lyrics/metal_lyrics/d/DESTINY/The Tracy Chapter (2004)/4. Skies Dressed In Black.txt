You spoke of it in your letters. Asking for it in return. Another memory dies for you.
Another life fades within you. I miss the comfort of being sad. Do you still write both
names on your paper. Not forgetting the last. Your hands on my chest. A gesture of
solidarity. Clear skies don't comply with my graditude. These words don't make sense to
you anyway. Broken pieces of existence cut my eyes. Pictures of our days pave my way. Can
you hold this memory in our embrance.
