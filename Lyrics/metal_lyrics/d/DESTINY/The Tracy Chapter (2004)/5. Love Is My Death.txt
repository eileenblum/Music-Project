I'm just a word in your verse. My longing that hides behind my thoughts breaks me.
I only live in your poem as written in grief. I'm just a memory. Another forgotten. Left
to tears. To go through this moments never again. You made me feel this way Without
your embrace I'm left to loneliness. Forgotten in cold. Why don't your eyes fill me
with warmth anymore. Heartlessness between us. Memories crashing against my heart.
Could I have my kisses back from you. Your distance will never end. To look at you makes me feel this way. My memories
will die 'cause you're no longer within me. Love is my death.
