I'm sitting here all alone writing about my past. The forever I shared with you which
wasn't forever. Apart from you your touch grows within me. Your feelings are to far
away. Wishes that are searching for you will never find you. I feel so cold I sink into
the dreams of my heart. My love bleeds for you no longer. With a cry you died inside of
me. And that's my only memory of you. With the embrace of beauty my heart stopped
beating.
