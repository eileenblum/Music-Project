A knife cuts my life. The symbol of the end. Tears of blood escape from your eyes.
Thought your wish so perfect and yet so weak. Every breath contains exhaution. So fast
and so quick you threw away goodbye. This heart bleeds for every tear you cried. For
every day of unrequited love. Another day passes by. One more day without you. I give
you my life for the last goodbye. A waiting for death. End this new beginning.
