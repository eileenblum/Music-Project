The fragments of your dreams now a part of us. How does it feel when I touch your
heart. Hold this moment. All I am I gave. All I have I spent. I'm lost inside of you. Are
you longing for these words: Kiss me. Do you miss those moments. Tight holding arms
around me. Beginning the day out of connected dreams. I take this last breath to relive.
