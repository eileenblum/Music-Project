Tasting your lips with every kiss. Smelling your scent on your neck. Holding you in my
arms. Every moment with you is written upon the tablet of my heart. Washing to live
this life again and forever. All memories are eternally burning pictures within my
soul. Every day I'm still beside you. Living in memories. Dreaming my life away. Thrust
our hearts. You and me together against the world. Losing myself on you. Losing you.
Losing so much more than just a part of me. Memorable beauty gives birth to my pain.
My world is broken. Life is gone.
