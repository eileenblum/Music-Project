Rain falls on my face as your tears touch my heart. You are so beautiful when I look
into your drowning clear eyes and tears touch your cheeks. I'm waiting for a better
day. A place to find for you and me. Back to days of embrace. Your hand in mine. I need
you around me. Your words run right through me as they did times before. Maybe it's
time to say goodbye. But I want to thank you. Angels left me as death kissed my heart. I
miss you. Always and forever in my heart.
