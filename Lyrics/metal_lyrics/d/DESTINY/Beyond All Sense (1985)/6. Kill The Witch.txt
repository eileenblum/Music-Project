She's the witch in my heart. And she tore it apart. She's the evil in my mind. Oh no! Can love be so blind. She got me in her spell. I know I'm trapped in hell. She caught me with her eyes. And now I'm captured by her lies.  Kill, kill the witch. She's the evil dressed in black. I said: "Die! Die, die bitch." There is no way of turning back.  She shows no respect. She doesn't think I suspectanything she has done. But one day I will be gone. She got me in controluntil I've found my soul. She took my future. I have to kill the creature.
