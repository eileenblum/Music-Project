If we're gonna have full control, many heads will have to roll. Up and down! Now is the day! The day has come, when they have to pay. For all the tears and all the hate. For them it's now to late. Now we are ready, the time has come. Scream and shout it out.  Tonight they hang together, no more King and Queen. Tonight they hang together, we want to hear them scream.  All those years in hell, now we broke their spell, and now it's time for them to die. So many lives on the run, for all that they have done. So let's hang them high.  So many died for the aristocrats. Hunt them like living rats. Kill more, kill more! For everything they have done to the poor. Fight for your home and bread, or it will be your death. If we're going to have full control, heads will have to roll.
