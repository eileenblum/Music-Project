X and Y togetherjoined - and made him forever. The embryo was growing. Oh no! It's glowing. X-ray beams discoveredwhat science couldn't cover. A first borne of this nature. Who - creator?  Power by birth, stronger than the curse.  The birth of this creationastonished the population. A galaxy liberator, a new kind - of invader. A human race defendermade the dawn - surrender. A golden gate to freedom. Long live his kingdom.
