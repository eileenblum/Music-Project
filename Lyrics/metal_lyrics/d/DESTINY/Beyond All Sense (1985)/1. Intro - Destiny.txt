The human race - Are we living on borrowed time?Questions we ask: Who takes? Who gives? Who dies? Who Lives? Are we going to live in heaven or hell? The answer the future will tell.  Why are we so afraid of the eternal dark? Why are we running from the unknown? Always these questions: Why? Why? Why?  So give your life a chance before it's too late. No one has the answer, the future is our fate. So live and let live! Do it good! Do it well! When your time has run out and you hear the bell, don't be afraid if you are a believer......in DESTINY...
