In 1682 there was nothing they could do. A ship full of people sank to the bottom. Sirens - In the dark. A Laugh of joy, the seaman is their toy.  Cold and rain, screams of pain. Hell - not heaven, blinded by beauty. Sirens - In the dark Beauty, beauty. Here I come. I'm far away from home.  Eternal sleep down in the deep. Someone is collecting souls. Calling - Why were they calling.  Beauty, beauty. Here I come. I'm far away from home.
