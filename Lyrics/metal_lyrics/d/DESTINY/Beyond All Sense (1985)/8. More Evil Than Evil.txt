My body is of iron my mind is of stone. Killing is the only friend I've known. I'm a torpedo, I'm killing for fun. There is no escape from me and my gun.  I am evil, I am evil, more evil than evil. I can hear you, I can see you, I'm coming to get you. In the night - you can't get away in the night. In the night - you can't get away.  You run for your life you tried to get away. I was your last moment on that day. I've done my job. I've done what I've been told. You were fey and had no chance to get old.  I am evil, I am evil, more evil than evil. I can hear you, I can see you, I'm coming to get you.  You were doomed by your curse. It's your sin, what could be worse. Than all my hate, it's your fate. So take your punishment and die like a man.
