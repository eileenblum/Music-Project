In a hamlet far away with Christianslives an old man so wisewith power so strong. He has seen kingdoms fall and rise.  Then came the strong men from the northwith only one thing on their minds: Kill, rob, rape and burn.  When he looked into the Crystal ball, he wondered why. He knew this freedom was going to falland build flames up to the sky.  These people live in peacewith happiness and freedom. The children play togetherand love is a natural thing.  Sacrilege. Sacrilege. Sacrilege. Sacrilege.  The savages from the north with swords, hungry for Christian treasures. Gold and silver, women bodies and bloodjust for the sake of pleasure.  The old man so wise, killed a beast - sacrificeand prayed to his idol: Blow away this nightmare.  A blaze, a voice: You evil, forever I make you blind! Return to hell! You evil, forever I take your mind!  These people live in peacewith happiness and freedom. The children play togetherand love is a natural thing.
