Assault the earth
Let cities burn
Destroy the population
May mothers kill their children
Sparing them the degradation

[Chorus:]
Tear... it... down
Your world falls apart
Tear... it... down
Before it kills you
First you and now the rest of us
(Rest of us...)

My anger saves
My anges saves
My power
It guides my wisdom
My will commands
That I will bring to all
A new direction

[Chorus:]
Tear... it... down
Your world falls apart
Tear... it... down
Before it kills you
First you and now the rest of us
(Rest of us...)

Your hatred becomes your sight
An angry truth does not teach
Your principles die with you

This world will pass away
This world will pass away

Many are the sorrows of the wicked
Many are the sorrows of the wicked

[Spoken:]
O Daughter of Babylon
Doomed to destruction
Happy is he who repays
You for what you have done to us
He who seizes your infants
And dashes them into the rocks

[Chorus - Altered:]
(Tear... it... down)
Your world falls apart
(Tear... it... down)
Before it kills you first
Before you kill us all
(Kill us all...)
