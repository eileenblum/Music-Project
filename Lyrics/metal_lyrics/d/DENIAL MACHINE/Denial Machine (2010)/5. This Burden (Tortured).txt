All have forsaken me
Delivered me
To the martyrs of tyranny
Bless the sin
Praise the death

[Solo - Anderson]

Nail in; my final breath
Who I am
All I am
Tortured

Crucify all hope
Wash your hands in blood
How easy can you clear your conscience?

[Chorus:]
Defend the wrong
(The wrong)
Deny the weak
(The weak)
How easy you will stab at the righteous

This burden carries on
Hold me up when all seems lost
This burden carries on...
And on 'til forever comes!

Who I am
All I am
Tortured

Fear, embrace the emptiness
Endure the suffering
Erase the emotion
Becoming...

[Solo - Cichra]

Divinity!

[Chorus:]
Defend the wrong
(The wrong)
Deny the weak
(The weak)
How easy you will stab at the righteous

This burden carries on
Hold me up when all seems lost
This burden carries on...
And on 'til forever 
'Til forever comes!

Tortured
Tortured
Tortured
Tortured
