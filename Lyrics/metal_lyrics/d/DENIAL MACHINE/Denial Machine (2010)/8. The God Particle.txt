Loss for dreams
Can't wake me now
Silence circles all around me
I can't remember
Do you recall
The whispers to me
The rising call

"We keep what we have...
... Only with vigilance..."

[Chorus:]
Eternal sleep
Your life fades away
Your message of hope
Eternal sleep
Your life fades away
Your promise of freedom

No remorse for cold succession
Short sighted fate
Will never lead me

No affection
No advocate
Point the blame to last inoculation...

[Chorus:]
Eternal sleep
Your life fades away
Your message of hope
Eternal sleep
Your life fades away
Your promise of freedom

Static pain
Greets me when I'm sober
Have I become
Womething mother would be proud of?

[Solo - Anderson/Cichra]

One more trip to slow me down

"We keep what we have...
... Only with vigilance..."

[Chorus:]
Eternal sleep
Your life fades away
Your message of hope
Eternal sleep
Your life fades away
Your promise of freedom
