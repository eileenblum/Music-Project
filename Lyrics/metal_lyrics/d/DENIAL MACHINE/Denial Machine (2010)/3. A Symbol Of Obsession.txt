Forget not these scars
For they're all too real
Will time still heal?

Still aging
And fading
Vanity!

Take a look in the mirror
Don't be afraid
It's only shame

You idolize your image
When the mirror breaks
Your image will fade

[Chorus:]
You pray
You pray for redemption
And salvation
To save you from yourself
You pray for salvation
To save you from yourself
From yourself

Now you'll give your confession
The guilt of perfection
Overwhelming pride
There's nothing real left in you
Alone you stand a symbol of obsession

[Chorus:]
You pray
You pray for redemption
And salvation
To save you from yourself
You pray for salvation
To save you from yourself
From yourself

Make your last confession
Of a plastic Existence
Your God is your possessions
Alone you stand a symbol of obsession

Take a look in the mirror
Do you recognize the eyes that stare back at you?
Embrace the cold 
The cold reflection

Pray for your redemption
Pray for your salvation
Save you from yourself

Alone you stand
A symbol of obsession
