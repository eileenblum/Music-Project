I'm waiting
I hate it
The end I have created
I fear it
Revere it
I feel it drawing near

I am the enemy
The adversary
I am now aware we can't avoid this
I wait to be destroyed

Apocalypse
Your ruin
Rise
The strong survive

This truth is terrifying
May it never come to light

[Chorus:]
Please give me tomorrow
I will find a way
I'll die for one more day
(One more day)
Please give me tomorrow
Give me a chance
To find a way to hold back time

Apocalypse
Your ruin
Rise
The strong survive

This fear is paralyzing
If I have spend my life [?]

[Chorus:]
Please give me tomorrow
I will find a way
I'll die for one more day
(One more day)
Please give me tomorrow
Give me a chance
To find a way to hold back time

[Solo - Anderson]

This will not be
Who I will become

[Chorus:]
Please give me tomorrow
I will find a way
I'll die for one more day
(One more day)
Please give me tomorrow
Give me a chance
To find a way to hold back time

I will not be
Who you have become
