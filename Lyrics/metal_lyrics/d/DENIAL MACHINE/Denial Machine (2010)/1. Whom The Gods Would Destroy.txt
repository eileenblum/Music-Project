Descending into madness
Derived from self hatred
Lost in the clarity
The memories have faded

The needle pricks the skin
Invasive therapy begins
Push and pull
There's no way out

Failure, you're praising failure
Over and over again

[Chorus:]
Am I the only one
To see the writing on the wall?
May the hammer of God
Be brought down
Now you're set up for the fall

The vile
The rapist
Heroes to be honored
Just how far have you fallen?

The guilty bring home all the praise
A new idol to adore your pray
What was right is now wrong in this age

Failure, you're praising failure
Over and over again

[Chorus:]
Am I the only one
To see the writing on the wall?
May the hammer of God
Be brought down
Now you're set up for the fall

Slowly you're swept away
Slowly you're swept away
With the tides of this persecution
Defiance brings wrath through self righteous indignation
Amoral pragmatisk
Does the end justify the means?

Whom the gods would destroy
First they make mad
Whom the gods would destroy

[Chorus:]
Am I the only one
To see the writing on the wall?
Am I the only one
To see the writing on the wall?
May the hammer of God
Be brought down
Now you're set up for the fall

You're set up for the fall
