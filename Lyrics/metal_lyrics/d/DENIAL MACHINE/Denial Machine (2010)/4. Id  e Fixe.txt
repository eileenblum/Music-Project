We will be
We will be reborn

Yaoh!
I am the one with the weight of the world
On my shoulders
Burying me

When will you learn
I can't walk away
It's too late for me
To turn the page

Why does pain inspire
Life to be reborn

Now I watch the world burn
The fault lies with our humanity

Why don't we learn?
Destined to repeat the mistakes
In our soul it's engraved

Why does pain inspire
Life to be reborn

We will be
We will be reborn

From dust we came
To ashes we return

[Solo - Anderson]

Are we forgotten?
Condemned to silence
In solitude comes revelation

We're nothing
We're everything
We're nothing
Forgotten in silence!

Why does pain inspire
Life to be reborn

I can't let myself
Be the one who falls away
(I will be reborn)
(I will be reborn)
