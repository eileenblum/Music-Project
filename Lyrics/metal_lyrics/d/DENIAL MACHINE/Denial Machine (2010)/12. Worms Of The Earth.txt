Built on blood
Behind the guile of peace
Subjugate!
The worms of the earth
Spread their disease
Do you believe?
Condemn you with one hand
The other subverts
The guilt placed upon you
"Will you serve?"

[Chorus:]
This is the only way
To heal the division
This is the only way
To break my convictions

Break down the will
Deny the right to exist
To dominate!
All in the name
Of the progressive mind
Self interest denied
Focus their anger to give punishment
You support the derision
You now serve!

[Chorus:]
This is the only way
To heal the division
This is the only way
To break my convictions

Is this the only way?
Is this the only way?
Is this the only way?

[Solo - Anderson/Cichra]

The life
Blood is the price for everything
In the end...

Bring down
Turn away
The dissenting voice
Violent words defy
Leaving no choice

To bring them down
To silence all...
To bring them down
To silence all...

[Chorus:]
This is the only way
To heal the division
This is the only way
To break my convictions

Silence dissension
To further progression
Dogmatic delusions rise!
