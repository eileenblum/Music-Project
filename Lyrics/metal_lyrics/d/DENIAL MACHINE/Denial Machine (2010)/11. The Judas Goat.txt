I am he
The archetype of betrayal
Allow me to tempt you
I walk among you
A lying divination

[Chorus:]
Forgive me?
For I know what I will do
Follow me
Sorrow is my only truth

I am he
The adversary
And I accuse
No absolution
I am within you
Leading you astray
BURN WITH ME!

[Chorus:]
Forgive me?
For I know what I will do
Follow me
Sorrow is my only truth

[Spoken Spanish words]

"Repent not of your murder
Or thy iniquity
Eternal ashes rain down
Your soul won't rest in peace
I betray thee

I betray thee"

[Chorus:]
Forgive me?
For I know what I will do
Follow me
Sorrow is my only truth
