You're right
Growing, evolving
The change
For a better life

You're wrong
Broken by promise
You lied
A waste of my time

[Chorus:]
Challenge me
Delivering failure
Challenge me
Ignore the truth

Tell me why must you call on me?
I'm not the one to serve you
Tell me why must you call on me?
"You're not my fucking God"
I'm not the one to serve you

A stranger
Tempting, leading, my home
I see through you
I see through this
Direction: press down
Till shaken
What has begun
No longer lives

[Chorus:]
Challenge me
Delivering failure
Challenge me
Ignore the truth

Tell me why must you call on me?
I'm not the one to serve you
Tell me why must you call on me?
"You're not my fucking God"
I'm not the one to serve you

Liar, play the prophet
Be my guide
To your heresy

I can see no other way
But desire loneliness
Once again
Never more
Crawling back to me

[Solo - Anderson/Cichra]
