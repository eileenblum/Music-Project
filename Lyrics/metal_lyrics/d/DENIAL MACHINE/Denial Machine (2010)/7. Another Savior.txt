I've walked this line
One too many times
With no promise of fortune
So much wasted time
Yet you already made up your mind
Undertaking progress

[Chorus:]
Cry out "I believe"
Embrace the end

My efforts have expired
Common tradition
Suffering addiction to conflict

[Chorus:]
Cry out "I believe"
Accelerate the immanence
Cry out "I believe"
Embrace the end

[Solo - Anderson/Cichra]

You won't make me
A part of this
You won't make me
A part of this

Pledge yourself to another savior
You won't make me
A part of this
My dying words will still resist
Pledge yourself to another savior

See the collapse
Which you bring to us all
Now your curses are true

The line is crossed
Hasten the end
Live with the path of destruction
You walk through this world

[Chorus:]
Cry out "I believe"
Accelerate the immanence
Cry out "I believe"
Embrace the end
