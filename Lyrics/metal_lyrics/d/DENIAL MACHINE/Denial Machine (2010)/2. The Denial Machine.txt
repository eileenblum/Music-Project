Denial, a doubter
I'm part of that machine
Alarmist, a realist
You preach failed ideology

Just another way
To control our lives
Tell us what to say
And what to do

[Chorus:]
You want the world made in your own image
I will not listen!
The never ending stream of contradictions
Contradictions!

The theories, unproven
They're still placed as policy
Restrained, silenced
To try and render us defeat

Just another way
To control our lives
Tell us what to say
And what to do

[Chorus:]
You want the world made in your own image
I will not listen!
The never ending stream of contradictions
Contradictions!

Design of threat and punishment
Their statement of faith
Become the mass delusion
May God protect us from those
Those who want to save the world!

[Solo - Anderson/Cichra]

Refuse
Become
Insurrection
Refuse
Become
Revolution

Refuse
Become
Insurrection
Refuse
Become
Revolution

[Chorus:]
You want the world made in your own image
I will not listen!
The never ending stream of contradictions
Contradictions!
