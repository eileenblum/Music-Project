Macabre priest from beyond
Riding the night skies
Evoking tyrannic fiends
From the immaculate void
No solitude in death, no sanctuary
Kill with hate in their eyes
Earth dethroned by the death dealer
All holy is destroyed

Ghouls of the dead
Spit of death from the black breath
Poisoned bloodshed
Ripping the flesh for him
EMPEROR OF SIN

The tale began by the rope
In the churchyard of doom
Armies of hell devour the living
The dead walks the earth
His soul outspan death
Spells of evil beneath the tomb
Die by command as the eyes of horror
Cast the morbid curse

Ghouls of the dead
Spit of death from the black breath
Poisoned bloodshed
Ripping the flesh for him
EMPEROR OF SIN
