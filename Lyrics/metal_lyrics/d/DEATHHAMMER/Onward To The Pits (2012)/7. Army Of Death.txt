across the sea they came forth with swords in hand 
crushing human scum under the hooves of Satan 
burning your homes and raping your daughters 
resistance is futile in this endless slaughter
ARMY OF DEATH
they drag you through the thornfields of gehenna 
ripped up and sore you pray to your feeble saviour 
but he can`t hear you, he is burning on a cross 
as you face the blade of death, you are now dead and rot
ARMY OF DEATH
you will die under the hand of Satan 
you will crawl in his blood 
you shall never see the light again 
the army of death has taken your soul!
