the stench of rotten corpses fills the air 
as the fullmoon lights up the cemetary 
rituals are performed to raise the dead 
arise from your graves, christian blood must be shed 
torment, witchcraft and blasphemy 
raise your bloodfilled chalice eternally 
the flames burns tonight for his return 
for priest to slaughter and lambs to burn
FULLMOON SORCERY
we gather around the ancient sacrifice 
spawned by hellfire the beast arise 
possessed by evil and hungry for flesh 
we rip the arms of jesus and eat his head 
an unholy bloodslaught on wings of doom 
satans dark legions are rising in bloom 
to the black oath we have forever sworn 
its time to sacrifice the fuckin virginborn
FULLMOON SORCERY
a lightning strikes the earthly soil as darkness falls on earth 
demons rise up from below to witness the rebirth 
a morbid voice penetrates the ghastly funeral winds 
we kneel before the burning flames and hail the king
