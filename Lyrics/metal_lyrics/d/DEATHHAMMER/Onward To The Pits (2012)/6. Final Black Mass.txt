Riding the hearse of the reaper
Beyond the borders of no return
We ride into the darkest abyss
And rejoice in the black flames of death
Total destruction of the heavens
A sea of blood wash away the light
The mouth of Hell gapes open wide
And swallows the burning earth

Devastation, total torment
Massacration of the lambs of god
Black terror reigns supreme
Hear the screams of death resounds in the ancient temple walls
The spell is cast, the torch is lit, tonight we sacrifice...
In this FINAL BLACK MASS

Standing in blood as evil reigns
Demons are whispering his name
Tortured souls are praying for mercy
We answer their cries with death
The chains are broken, now we are free
Eternal darkness rules our land
Thy kingdom has come and our will is done
Tonight is the night of the master

...of the master!

Devastation, total torment
Massacration of the lambs of god
Black terror reigns supreme
Hear the screams of death resounds in the ancient temple walls
The spell is cast, the torch is lit, tonight we sacrifice...
In this FINAL BLACK MASS

Summon death to end it all
All that is left is a burning black hole
Evil spirits now haunt the skies
A new empire in flames shall arise...
