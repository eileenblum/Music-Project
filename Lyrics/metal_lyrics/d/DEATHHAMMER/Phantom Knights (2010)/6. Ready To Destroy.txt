Living high times in the speed of lightning
Destruction and chaos, great night for fighting
Perpetual screams after the attack
No fucking mercy, no looking back
Ready to destroy with terminating rage
Relentless rush of power, noise from Hell on the stage

Blood upon the stage tonight
Ready to destroy
Scream for Metal and fight
Ready to destroy

With the force of my fist mercy will not exist
I have chosen the ways of Hell
Blasphemic cruelty under wicked Metal spell
Riding with Satan, destruction in the air
Assault of fatal violence, glorious nightmare is near

Mayhemic uproar tonight
Ready to destroy
Strike of supreme Metal might
Ready to destroy

[LEAD - SERGEANT SALSTEN - SADOMANCER]

Blood upon the stage tonight
Ready to destroy
Scream for Metal and fight
Ready to destroy
