Entombed in darkness you cry out in pain 
A horrible death waits for you 
Creatures of evil grasp for your soul 
The master have prepared your tomb 
Now you shall die and enter Hells fire 
Stare into the abyss of death 
The last thing you feel is the slice of the blade 
As black blood flows down your neck

Die by the cold winds of death
Feel the grip of darkness
Beyond Hells gates lies forever pain
The only way out is to die again
When you`re in Hell there is return
Submit to Satan or eternally burn

Gruesome soldiers of Satans spawn 
Dwellers of the seven gates 
Let loose the oceans of endless flames 
To bring forth total death 
Reapers of evil, sons of the damned 
Summoning the fires of Hades 
Your life fades away in a ghastly black haze 
As cold winds enter your flesh

Die by the cold winds of death
Feel the grip of darkness
Beyond Hells gates lies forever pain
The only way out is to die again
When you`re in Hell there is no return
Submit to Satan or eternally burn

Now that your soul has been consumed by His flames 
And trapped in the eternal pits of Hell 
My throne will arise above your worthless remains 
For I bear the cold winds of death
