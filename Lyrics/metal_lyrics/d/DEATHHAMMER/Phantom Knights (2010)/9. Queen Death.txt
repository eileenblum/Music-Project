Awaken! from my ancient slumber
Caressed by a foul voice from beyond
Lucifers host i have become
Now I glance through mirrors of death
Through my blurry vision, I see a gate
I enter through a portal in the sky
The horrors which haunted my human dreams
Now unfolds before my eyes

Take my morbid soul
Queen of death
I kneel before your Satanic majesty
Queen of death

Satans throne unfolds under a blackened sky 
As death put an end to all life 
Raging flames lay waste to the human plague
As the horizon is covered in blood
The power from hell burns bright in my heart
Our promised land finally appears
Filled with ancient crafts of the black flame 
I ride the mighty winds of blood

Take my morbid soul
Queen of death
Now I`m at one with the pentagram
Queen of death

[LEAD - SADOMANCER]

Take my morbid soul
Queen of death
I ride the mighty winds of blood
Queen of death
