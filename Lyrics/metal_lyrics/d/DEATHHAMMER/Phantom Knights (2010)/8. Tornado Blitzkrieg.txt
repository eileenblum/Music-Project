The storm of damnation is coming
straight from the depths of Hades
The winds of blood sweeps the soil
as the Phantom Knight reigns

The final bell of doom chimes
the horned king of the underground
Takes his mayhemic vengeance
on the hordes of light
Tornado blitzkrieg tonight

Attack of the the black leather demon 
destructive windstorms descending from the sky
Total destruction, the earth turns to dust
absolute silence, now you die

Call forth the storm
Phantom Knight
and ride the sky with wrath
Tornado blitzkrieg tonight

[LEADS - SERGEANT SALSTEN]

The final bell of doom chimes
the horned king of the underground
Takes his mayhemic vengeance
on the hordes of light
Tornado blitzkrieg tonight
Call forth the storm
Phantom Knight
and ride the sky with wrath
Tornado blitzkrieg tonight
