In my mortal realm I fought to the death
The Reaper caught my hellish soul
A black fire of evil penetrate my flesh
The kingdom of Satan unfold
Facing the seven gates, unleashing wicked spells
Riding on the demon's flame
Thrown into the abyss, condemned to rot in Hell
Bestial sacrifice beyond the grave

Gazing upon the fiery pits
Awaiting eternal torment
Morbid possession at the threshold as Hell awaits...
GATES OF HADES

[LEAD - SADOMANCER]

Hellhounds guided by Baphomets will
Tied in burning leather, thirsty to kill
Ogres and witches appear from afar
Riding in darkness, yearning for destruction and war
Pounding death by Satan's hand, end of life, DIE HARD!
Mighty lord of the stygian domain, evil master, morning star
At the black wicked seance I can now feel
(that) In this blackest of dominions ONLY DEATH IS REAL

Gazing upon the fiery pits
Awaiting eternal torment
Morbid possession at the threshold as Hell awaits...
GATES OF HADES

[LEAD - SERGEANT SALSTEN - SADOMANCER]
