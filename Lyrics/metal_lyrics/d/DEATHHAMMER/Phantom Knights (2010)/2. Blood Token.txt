Arise! from the vast pits of death 
and join us in (the) hunt for jesus christ 
Trample the holy and deny the cross 
desecrate all weaklings in sight 
Come forth! in this ritual of doom 
we call upon the raging seas of fire 
Seduced by the flames we violently strike 
obeying his darkest desire

Fire burns bright in our hearts 
Sworn an oath to follow the dark 
Knights of the underworld, take heed and obey 
The call of death shows us the unholy way 
Splendour and glory through this ultimate upheaval 
Descending to His ancient domains of black evil 
The heavens crack before our eyes 
A token of Satans might

Appear! mighty demons of Hell 
give us the power to rule this night
Armed with swords of immortality
our vengeance will strike upon those of the light
Satan! steps out of the flames 
snakes crawling out from his mouth 
Darkness and evil have taken its hold
the legions of Hell arise

Journey into the coven of the undead souls of Hell 
Join the hordes of lucifer, in darkness now you dwell 
Take the masters hand and walk side by side with death 
A servant of the blackest oath and pure unholiness

[LEAD - SADOMANCER]
