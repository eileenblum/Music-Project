He foresaw a grand vision
Thus he rendered the rite of submission
Following the diabolic sensation
He entered the realm with vast anticipation
In the obscure domain he now dwell
Worshipping death, pain and Hell
He'll never reach the souls of the dead
Eternally staying one step ahead

In this twisted reality I see the vast black abyss
At the threshold of obscurity He beckons my presence with the
Devilish Dirge

A moribound spirit without rest
Pleased to wander on the verge of death
Beyond the graveyard of the condemned
Where only true believers descend
So now await my end and behold my coming
Conjure my soul away after the immense longing
I hypnotize my mind and torment my flesh 
As I too enter the kingdom of death

In this twisted reality I see the vast black abyss
At the threshold of obscurity He beckons my presence with the
Devilish Dirge

Hatred poisons my veins
The devilish dirge echoes in my brain

[LEAD - SERGEANT SALSTEN]

At the threshold of obscurity I hear a haunting chant
Devilish Dirge
