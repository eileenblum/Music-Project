Black spells bursting in the cult of sodom
Evil power and possession
The sinner's wrath of diabolic force
In the unholy procession
Slashing and whipping, thrashing and ripping
Son of evil's vengeance tonight
Bashing and bursting, scourging and purging
Smashing the feeble to fight

Bedeviled by the flame, sinner's procession
Wrath of the abyss and power of the night
Ignite the killer aggression, sinner's possession

In the misty depths of the black hole
Lurks the root of evil
Command of sodom, sacrifice in sin
Hellishness and bestial upheaval
With savage lust we summon the horned beast
The holy ghost will tremble
Cities shall bleed as demons will feast
Trampled weaklings shall crumble

Bedeviled by the flame, sinner's possession
Wrath of the abyss and power of the night
Ignite the killer aggression, sinner's possession

[Lead: Jon Doom]

Hellbent on spreading their pest
Banshees screaming with hellfire breath
To incinerate the rest
The devil's hex is upon the earth
Resistance obsolete
Our lord belial rises
The ritual is complete
