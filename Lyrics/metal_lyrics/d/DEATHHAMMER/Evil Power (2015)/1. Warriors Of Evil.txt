The sea is in flames, the sky has turned black
Total death rips 'cross the land
Plague of possession, Satan is back
Annihilating the race of man
Warriors of evil will show no mercy
Endless pain and devastation
Cast them to hell and leaving behind
Only total desolation

At night they ascend from the depths
Execute havoc and death
Strike from hell, evil's return
By Satan's blade you will burn
They are the warriors of evil

There is no garden of Eden and peace
Only destruction and death
No pearly gates waits for you in this realm
Fire will torment your flesh
Lucifer's legions will show no mercy
In this unholy invasion
All life is rotting and burning in sin
Bursting out evil damnation 

At night they ascend from the depths
Execute havoc and death
Strike from hell, evil's return
By Satan's blade you will burn
They are the warriors of evil power

All that once lived met their end by thrust force of steel
Flash of the blade swept and burned with maximum overkill
