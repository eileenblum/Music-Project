Black night, the cauldron is boiling
An ominous presence lurks
Nightmare in hell, Satan's return
Evil is spreading its wings
Hellions of mayhemic vengeance
Burstin' out from the flames
At the threshold of no return
He stands in the fire and wields the sword of death

Gaze at the black sky - now you die
Burning to hell
The sun turns red with heaven's blood - omen of the beast

Rays of darkness penetrate the earth
As creation dies
Armageddon, the last day of life
Ring the bells of doom
Blackness is all you can see
Your soul is on fire
And all that remains is death, your final sanctuary

Gaze at the black sky - now you die
Burning to hell
The sun turns red with heaven's blood - omen of the beast

[Lead: Sadomancer]

On this night of eternal demise
As witching hour strikes
The pentagram lights up the sky
Omen of the beast - you will all die!
