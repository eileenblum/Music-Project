Black storms of sulphur
An omen of infernal dread
Emerging from forgotten woods
Our unholy path lies ahead
The altar is ready, a virgin displayed
Darkness has claimed her blood
I curse the dagger and raise the blade
We chant his name and hail the crimson flood

Evil arise!
I breathe the stench of ancient death
Black fire!
Our malediction - a success
Invocation!
The summoning has begun
Armageddon!
This black mass cannot be undone
Belial's curse!

A portal opens beneath me
Festering death in a hole
Fiends of infernal upheaval are eager to violate your soul
No blessing or ward can protect you
From the corruption of your flesh
The curse of belial will ravage to the death

Evil arise!
I breathe the stench of ancient death
Black fire!
Our malediction - a success
Invocation!
The summoning has begun
Armageddon!
This black mass cannot be undone
Belial's curse!

Lucid nightmares of gehenna
For all who is under the spell
Voices of blasphemy sounds through the rift
A gaping gateway to hell

...And I watch the earth collapse!
