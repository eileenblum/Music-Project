A seething surge of power is running through my veins
Hate and destruction, off the fucking chains
No pity or remorse, we mock the holy cross
Hot molten metal, the only way for us

We never kneel at anyone's feet 
Destroy and thrash when we feel the pounding beat
Show no mercy to any of your kind
With high speed metal, posers we grind
Decibel junkies, total mayhem
Never too loud, let the rawness rip
Death to all posers, tear them to shreds
Behold the might of our powertrip

Crushing the weak with great fists of steel
With furious vengeance, we slaughter and kill
Ruthless remorselessness, crackling bones cry
The thrashing won't ever stop until we die

We never kneel at anyones feet
Destroy and thrash when we feel the pounding beat
Show no mercy to any of your kind
With high speed metal, posers we grind
Decibel junkies, total mayhem
Never too loud, let the rawness rip
Death to all posers, tear them to shreds
Behold the might of our powertrip

Destroy!

Tonight is the night to strike
Evil shall rule at last
Tortured screams of pain
Metal - wrath of the insane
