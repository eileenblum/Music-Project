This is the return of darkness and evil!
Die in hell! Satan is back!

A thousand years of peace has passed
This night will be the very last
Against the light we fight in the name of
Satan
To victory!
Kill all that lives
Make way for total death
Armageddon is unleashed in all it's glory
Hear our warcry!

Darkness, poison, hellish wrath
Pounding evil in our hearts
Rise to conquer, souls of black
Satan is back
Stalkers of the light
Possessed by Satanic might
Evil - the reason we fight
Satan is back

Death comes rippin' from the sky
By his command you all will die
Satan's fist strikes through the ground from down under
Tearing earth asunder
The heavenly gates are drowned in flames
As chaos rape the white domains
Demons feast upon the flesh of christ
As we celebrate the death of light

Darkness, poison, hellish wrath
Pounding evil in our hearts
Satan is back
Stalkers of the light
Possessed by Satanic might
Evil - the reason we fight
Satan is back

Death to life!
Eternally to reign in hell
Sworn to the black
The gates are closed, no return, there is no way back

Rise master Satan!
This is the night without end
Dweller of the blackest hell
Come forth and strike your sword through
the heart of god

[Lead: Jon Doom]

Darkness, poison, hellish wrath
Pounding evil in our hearts
Rise to conquer, souls of black
Satan is back
Stalkers of the light
Possessed by Satanic might
Evil - the reason we fight
Satan is back

[Leads: Sadomancer]
