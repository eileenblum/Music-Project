He arose from the pits of hell
With an aim to crush the light
As a mortal he once fell
But now he's back again to fight
Wherever the christian scum may dwell
He'll butcher them with hellish might 
An evil, mean, hateful rebel
Are out to kill this gloomy night

He's a soldier of satan out to desecrate
Killing with a vengeance to stimulate his hate
Demonic avenger!

The barbaric hunt is on!
Christian rats please his bloodthirst 
A rising horde of death has spawned
The race of god is cursed
In the massacration the cult has grown
1000 hellish beasts has emerged
Night is over, now it's dawn
And demonz have conquered the earth

He's a soldier of satan out to desecrate
Killing with a vengeance to stimulate his hate
Demonic avenger....

...the cause of white light's tribulation
laughing in content as he sheds their blood
causing total annihilation
butchering the race of god!

He's a soldier of satan out to desecrate
Killing with a vengeance to stimulate his hate
Demonic avenger....
