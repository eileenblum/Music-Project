On an unholy killing spree 
Christian death is what he need 
He's wicked, violent and profane 
Chop of their heads and eat their brains 
Chaos, terror, endless disaster 
All in the name of Satan, his master 

Tormentor! 
Obsessed by evil deeds 
Tormentor! 
He spits at god's kreation 
Tormentor! 
He won't rest 'till every fukker bleeds 
Tormentor! 
In his gruesome massacration! 

You'll not dear to defy 
When you stare into his black eyes 
Devastation and pain 
Is his only aim 
The holy man will pay his price 
As the scum of god gets sacrificed
