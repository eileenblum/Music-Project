Sacrifice of virgins, unholy desecration
Burning needles penetrates the lambs of god`s creation
Skinny hairy witches dancin` round the fire
To celebrate the return of sin and lustful hellish desire

Gather black priests of doom
Possessed under the moon
Evoke the green-eyed demons
To spread their poisoned semen
With this torch I light up the ancient flames of death
The winds of damnation shall rape all holy flesh
Unholy Sacrifice

In the silent nigthly woods, we gather for the last time
We sing the hymns of Satan to praise the unholy light
Draped in silver starlight, I raise my hands to the sky
I proclaim the spells of darkness and watch the lamb die

Gather black priests of doom
Possessed under the moon
Evoke the green-eyed demons
To spread their poisoned semen
With this torch I light up the ancient flames of death
The winds of damnation shall rape all holy flesh
Unholy Sacrifice
