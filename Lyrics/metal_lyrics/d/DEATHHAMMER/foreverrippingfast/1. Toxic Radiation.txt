Humanity is facing a vital distress
Total eradication, a slow, merciless death
The dawn of a perilous threat
The greatest curse you've ever met

Toxic radiation!
This is our damnation
Toxic radiation!
Suffer the global annihalation

A massive explosion of chemical bonds
You'll all be dead when you leave your homes
The nuclear death beam burns your skin
Coughing blood and crying in pain you know you cannot win

Toxic radiation!
This is our damnation
Toxic radiation!
Suffer the global annihalation

Face the atomic apocalypse!
This is judgement day
Your soul's descending into hell's pits
As your lifeless body decay

Toxic radiation!
this is our damnation
Toxic radiation!
Total fucking devastation
