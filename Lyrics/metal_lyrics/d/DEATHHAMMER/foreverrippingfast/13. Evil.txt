Lucifer rises from the old pile of bones 
the light from his eyes burn a hole in my soul 
as a morbid stench penetrate the cold windz of death 
a honorable hail, as we feast on christ`s flesh 

horned master of the fire 
fullfill me with the delightful desire 
possessed by the glorius flames 
in hell I will eternally reign 
EVIL 

we kneel before the burning flames as evilness reign 
and slash the crucifix till death with bulletbelt chains 
the necrosleezers rape the angels with their savage sword 
kill the lamb and praise the beast and bend before our lord 

horned master of the fire 
fullfill me with the delightful desire 
possessed by the glorius flames 
in hell I will eternally reign 
EVIL
