I met an evil wizard with prophecies of death 
From the pits of hell I saw the coming of perdition 
I felt the massive power and the pleasure of darkness 
The dark lord below blessed me with satanic visions 

Satanic visions arise, through the smoke in my eyes 
On the altar of death, a deceased goat rest 
I drink its blood and eat its flesh, and feel the burning sensation grow in my chest 
I swear the oath to the pentagram because I know... 
I AM POSSESSED!! 

At the black mass I drink from a bloodfilled chalice 
From it arise an intoxication of strenght and supreme hate 
After the ritual I'm forever filled with infernal malice 
Followers of the jesus christ, death will be your fate 

Satanic visions arise, through the smoke in my eyes 
On the altar of death, a deceased goat rest 
I drink its blood and eat its flesh, and feel the burning sensation grow in my chest 
I swear the oath to the pentagram because I know... 
I AM POSSESSED!!
