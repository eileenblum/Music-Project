Here we are in a new age
The weak lie in my wake
I dream of structures
Erected out of violence and hate
Do you know why you are here?
Do you question your existence?
When you look into the mirror
What the fuck do you see?

Pissing down a wishing well
Violence and hate have served them well
Nobody here deserves to die
But nothing will stop this genocide

You donât know the things I feel
You canât change whatever I say
Try and try to block them out
Problems just wonât go away
Fuck you, you never understand

Iâm in love with anger

Iâm married to frustration
I only feel at ease
In social isolation

Who can I turn to but myself?
No compassion no one else
Sleep forever in my place
I feel no pain no disgrace

Carving knife-holes in the fucking walls
Pacing up and down the motherfucking halls

Stuck in this cycle riddled with regret
Waiting for complacency anticipating death

Paycheck to paycheck
For whom for what
Contemplate my future, but I donât give a fuck

Unyielding thoughts of evil
In the wake of deep depression
Personalities I see through-I abstain of this bullshit

Your life is full of fiction fooling no-one but yourself
Your a walking contradiction
I abstain of this bullshit

Doom, not a shred of hope,
Iâm grinding through their skulls
And feeling no remorse [2X]

Your way, my way everything will be the same
When our minds melt in the flames
On our judgment day
Memories of the past are erased

Doomâ¦ end of saga [4X]
Doomâ¦ end of saga [3X]

Doom end of saga and the weak ones are the first to go
Thoughts and actions are forgotten end in human war [2X]
