Endlessly searching
For a reason for existence
Dead end, pointless mission
You wait your whole life
For the messiah to take your fucking life
Endless waiting pointless praying dulls your mind
In religion common sense is hard to find
Government dulls your senses blurs your vision
Unaware you let a book make your decisions
Your thoughts are programmed
Inscribed in your mind
Ignorance is bliss, violence is divine
Lobotomize
Existence filled with pain and strife
Violence in your afterlife
Brain-dead masses thrown aside
No remorse for those that died
Blindly believing every lie
Worship till you fucking die
Ignore contradictions found in religion
Join the herd
Waste your whole fucking life...
