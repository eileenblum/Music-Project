Emerging from the depths to
Desecrate the population
Feeding on the greed and hatred
Of humanity
Ignorance eclipses the minds
Of the apathetic
Climbing of the spine of the earth
To reduce us to dust
It knows nothing of compassion
Hate fuels this machine
It kills without discretion
Slowly spreading its disease
Vivisection of the planet
Pinned down, gutted like an insect
Limbs are frozen you are helpless
You cannot escape its clutches
Brains are stagnant
Conforming to pain a daily habit
Memories of pleasure fade away
Blind to lies we slowly decay

Apathetic eyes wide open
Never seeing bodies broken
Profits compel greedy minds
This one way system never dies
Path we're on a vicious circle
Religious wars that no one wins
Beast that dwells in all of us
Will eventually consume our being

Action must be taken today
As minds melt away
Corporations destroy the planet
Accelerated state of decay
Planet rots away
Your motherfucking bible useless
Visions of the past slowly die
The present I despise
I canât bear to even see the future
Living under threat of war
God that you adore
Canât be bothered to save
What he created
Who is your god?
Where is he now?
Fuck you
Greed engulfs the world
The scum of society
Swarm like maggots to a corpse
Consuming all, this greed disease

Masses growing never knowing
They are slaves to mass hypnosis
Randomly lobotomized
Reduce to primitive psychosis
