Profit from disciples
Theories are recycled
Force fed indecision

Memorizing what was said
Unasked questions in your head
Religious cancer in your mind
Spreading tumor, not benign

Profit from disciples
Theories are recycled
Force fed indecision
Christened in their vision

Donât believe, they deceive
Free from sin, immaculated
Crucifixion for your sins
Book of fiction full of shit
Donât ask why just fucking die

Human toll, it will rise
What brought them together will now bring demise
They've become what they once despised
Murder is easily justified

Your fucking mind runs on superstition
You worship Santa Claus, terrified into religion
This fucking parasite, burrowed into your mind
Fearing the afterlife, salvation youâll never find

Repent it will not die
Ignorance is everlasting

Comfort from lies
Independent thoughts despised
Open your eyes, the priest has hands on your thigh
Molestation

Dying doctrine, system of lies
Rejoice in the blood of the unknowing innocent
Repent, I refuse to spread your ignorance

Dying doctrine, system of lies
Birth of ignorance, death and demise

Tombstones smashed to pieces
Human rag-dolls thrown to the side
Die, holocaust, die, genocide

Armageddon, it has been written
Destruction overwhelming
Restrictions on your mind
Death to disciples of every fucking kind

Total discrimination
Of every race and creed
Exploit entire cultures
To satisfy their need

Tombstones smashed to pieces
Human rag-dolls thrown to the side

Prophets for profit
Believe the bullshit
Obeying, decepted
The followers of horse shit

Fuck the world
