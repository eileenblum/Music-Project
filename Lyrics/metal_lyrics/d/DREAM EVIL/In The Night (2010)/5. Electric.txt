God damn their poetic rock
You're in for a metal shock
Like a bomb we will blow your mind
We never leave our friends behind
Like a clan we aim for the night
We won't give up without a fight
Together we are strong
We always have the will to go on
Blood brothers in to the bone
A clenched fits hard like a stone

Let's get ready
We need to win this war

Just like lightning strikes a fire IN THE NIGHT. Metal is the only way
The devil's sign confirms you're ready for the fight
Built to last and here to stay. It's electric

Be assured that we are back. With power we lead the attack
We're stronger than ever before. We're metal in to the core
Like steel we shine IN THE NIGHT. We spread our wings for the flight
We'll take the night as it comes. We are the chosen ones

Are you ready? We will win this war

Just like lightning strikes a fire IN THE NIGHT. Metal is the only way
The devil's sign confirms you're ready for the fight
Built to last and here to stay. It's electric

The tension, electric. The power, electric.
Together, electric, the night is electric.
The crowd is electric, metal electric

Just like lightning strikes a fire IN THE NIGHT. Metal is the only way
The devil's sign confirms you're ready for the fight
Built to last and here to stay. It's electric
We're like lightning strikes a fire IN THE NIGHT. Metal is the only way
The devil's sign confirms we're burning for the fight
Built to last and here to stay. It's electric
