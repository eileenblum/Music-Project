We are made of metal
Our hearts are made of steel
Even if we're stained with blood
You know, we got that sex appeal

Swords and axes reflect the light
Gut-spreading metal IN THE NIGHT

We believe in lots of love, we believe in love
We believe in being proud and wild and free
We believe in lots of love, we believe in love
We believe in being all that we can be

Sometimes we get tired
Ohh...of being metal stars
Sometimes we get hired
To play on Jupiter and Mars

It doesn't matter where you go, he's always there
That fucking Snowy Shaw

We believe in lots of love, we believe in love
We believe in drinking boers and booze and wine
We believe in lots of love, we believe in love
We believe in drinking booze and act like swine
When the children cry

You can be the one who cares
You could be like four in the morning
You can be the one who's scared
Or you can raise your fist in the morning
In the morning...

We believe in lots of love, we believe in love
We believe in drinking boers and booze and wine
We believe in lots of love, we believe in love
We believe in drinking booze and act like swine
When the children cry
