Rise through the ashes to fight for the legions of hell
Blinded by madness in fire and death I dwell

Need to heal. My religion is blood and I need it to live
Need the steel. It's the key to the Gods and I need it to lead
Never kneel. I'm the only king you'll need

IN THE NIGHT. Bounded by leather
IN THE NIGHT. Surrounded by chains
IN THE NIGHT. Metal forever
IN THE NIGHT. We rise through the flames

Onwards I move as my enemies spread like the wind
Fight by my side and the bloodletting will begin

As they bleed
We will unleash a hell that will conquer them all
As they scream
We're like brothers in arms and we will make them fall
They will kneel
I'm the only king you'll need

IN THE NIGHT. Bounded by leather
IN THE NIGHT. Surrounded by chains
IN THE NIGHT. Metal forever
IN THE NIGHT. We rise through the flames

We will unite
Hail Metal, we will fight
Lightning will strike
Hail Metal, IN THE NIGHT
Freedom in sight
Metal is why we're alive

When we ride, blood red sky
All dark demons will with hell unite
We will fight

IN THE NIGHT...
