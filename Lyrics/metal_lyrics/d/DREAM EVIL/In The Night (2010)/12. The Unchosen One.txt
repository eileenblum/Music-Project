This is a story about greed
Finding a person no one needs
She's a shell
You can call her the cousin from Hell

Started the day our grandma died
Honoured her standing side by side
Who could know
That all time she was playing a role of a lady in grief

Always thought she was a saint
Things ain't the same in daylight as IN THE NIGHT
Always thought she was a friend
Things ain't what they appear

At funeral day she brought her clan
People that didn't care at all
They were there
Just to see if there were any threats

After the ceremony, they left
Convinced that the things they've done may rest
They were wrong
The old woman had something to show them that's shaken their souls

Always thought she was a saint
Things ain't the same in daylight as IN THE NIGHT
Always thought she was a friend
Things ain't what they appear

Where have you got your greed from? Our side of the family, no way!
Surely from someone we all know. I think when this case is over
If you win or lose doesn't matter. I hope you'll be conscious of one's guilt

Always thought she was a saint
Things ain't the same in daylight as IN THE NIGHT
Always thought she was a friend
Things ain't what they appear

Shame on you IN THE NIGHT, bitch!
