One day I'll be a star
Can't stay, I've come too far
You wait for me and see
I will fulfill...my dreans

But life is too cold...Be still!
A company of trolls
They seek the thrill
The trolls have come to...

Kill! Burn! Be Evil! Kill! Burn! Forever!

They've come to take my life
They've come to take my wife
They murder, rape and steal
With axe and club and knife
They broke my bones and face
And had my mind erased
They stole my dreams away
And made of me...a slave!

Come and behold and see
A company of trolls
They seek to kill
The power of my will

Kill! Burn! Be Evil! Kill! Burn! Forever!

And the beast forsakes his offspring hordes
Monsters, slain. Man and troll. Blood and gore
Limb and head. They all lie there...dead

Kill! Burn! Be Evil! Kill! Burn! Forever!
