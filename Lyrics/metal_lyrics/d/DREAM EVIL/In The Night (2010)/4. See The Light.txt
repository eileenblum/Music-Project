Just like a shadow in the street
Under the moonlight, feeling incomplete
Searching to find a friendly face
Stuck in this God-forsaken place

After the dusk there will be dawn
I stood before you like an angel in disguise
Reach for my hand and don't let go
I'll be the one that saves your soul

Have a little patience now, come a little closer
Wait until the time is right, you'll see the light
Have a little patience now, try a little harder
I promise if you trust me, you'll win this fight

It's hard to remember what went wrong
Been living in darkness for so very long
Open your door and let me in
I'll help you find your light within

Have a little patience now, come a little closer
Wait until the time is right, you'll see the light
Have a little patience now, try a little harder
I promise if you trust me, you'll win this fight...win this fight

Watch out there are forces you can't see
Beware, they grow strong IN THE NIGHT
Stand up before they take over
Be strong, stick to the light

Have a little patience now, come a little closer
Wait until the time is right, you'll see the light
Have a little patience now, try a little harder
I promise if you trust me, you'll win this fight
