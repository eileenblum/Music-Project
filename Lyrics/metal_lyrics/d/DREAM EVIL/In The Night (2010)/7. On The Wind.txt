It seems to me you never learn
Play with fire, you get burnt
What's the reason for your sympathy
Why don't you leave me alone

I'm your dream, I'm the sky, I'm the sea, I'm the air that you breathe
I'm the wind, I'm the sky, I'm the sea, I'm the wind

You got all reasons feeling sad
You got all reasons feeling bad
Can't you realize I'm out of reach
You'll never be the one for me

I'm your dream, I'm the sky, I'm the sea, I'm the air that you breathe
I'm the wind, I'm the sky, I'm the sea
You'll never learn how to fly on the wind

Just IN THE NIGHT, just in the morning light, way to tight

You played with fire, you got burnt
I turned my back, what have you learnt
Everybody wants a piece of me
Everybody, stand in line

I'm your dream, I'm the sky, I'm the sea, I'm the air that you breathe
I'm the wind, I'm the sky, I'm the sea
You'll never learn how to fly on the wind
I'm the wind, just IN THE NIGHT, I am the wind
