Here we are, step aside if you want to stay alive
Got to avoid this evil force
Our gift, a kiss of death
We will seduce you with our breath
We smell the fragnance of your fear

We are the legions of the dead, when it's dark we strike
You're not alone IN THE NIGHT...Frostbite

You're still alive, you have survived
A garlic necklace around your neck
But you know we'll strike again
Another night has now passed by
But rest assured, the next you'll die
You can't resist the kiss of Vlad

We are the creatures of the night
Ignore the cross avoid the light
Who can resist the taste of blood...Frostbite

Sleep tight IN THE NIGHT...Frostbite

Your bodies twist in pain
When we suck your blood
Your pillows stained with blood
Frostbite

Our thirst, bound by blood, growing stronger day by day
Starving shadows in the dark

We're the legions of the dead, when it's dark we strike
We're the creatures of the night
Ignore the cross avoid the light
You cannot hide, you cannot run, our mission's just begun
We will erase the human race...Frostbite
