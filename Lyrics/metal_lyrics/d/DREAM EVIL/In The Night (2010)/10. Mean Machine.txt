Every day I need to feel you, I need you around
Every night I need to hear you, I love your sound
I just can't live without you, we are blood-bound

Before our life together, I was alone
I was a mean old bastard, bad to the bone
Cared only for myself, had a heart of stone

When the day arrived, and I saw you in the light
I knew we're meant to be forever

Aaaah, aaaah my mean machine
Aaaah, aaaah controls my destiny

Every day and every hour, you fill my mind
I got no friends or family, I left them behind
A force of steel and power, IN THE NIGHT

When the day arrived, and I saw you in the light
I knew we're meant to be forever

Aaaah, aaaah my mean machine
Aaaah, aaaah controls my destiny
