I see the sun rise in the East
My skin is touched by waning winds

Sacrifice...
Sacrifice...

In the fires of the sun
We will burn as one
On the pyres of the sunrise
The smoke will part the skies
We all now realize

Sacrifice...

In the fires of the sun
We will burn as one
On the pyres of the sunrise
The smoke will part the skies

In the fires of the sun
We will burn as one
On the pyres of the sunrise
The smoke will part the skies
We all now realize
Like angels we've become
