I took you by surprise
And lead you through the night
I knew you never felt that safe
I turned and whispered to you
You turned away
I'd never lie to you my friend

But you should know this one thing:
This thing may one day save your life
It's real but can't touch it
In every corner of the night...

Blind evil, standing in the darkness
Waiting in the pouring rain
Blind evil, wants to bring you sadness
Brings you to eternal pain

You turned away in anger and walked alone
You said that I could go to hell
But in the streets there's something you can't deny...
The path to death is where you lead...

But you should know this one thing:
This thing may one day save your life
It's real but can't touch it
In every corner of the night...

Blind evil, standing in the darkness
Waiting in the pouring rain
Blind evil, wants to bring you sadness
Brings you to eternal pain
