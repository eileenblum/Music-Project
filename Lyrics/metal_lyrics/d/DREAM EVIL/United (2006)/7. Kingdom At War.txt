We stand here in silence
Ten thousand with weapons in hand
Brought out of violence
For freedom I gathered these men

We're riding on the wings of Odin
In glory we believe

A kingdom at war
Forever stand united
A kingdom at war
Together we gain ground
Fight in the war

Steel strikes like lighting
Bodies are twisted in pain
Although it's frightening
Our losses should not be in vain

We're riding on the wings of Odin
In glory we believe

A kingdom at war
Forever stand united
A kingdom at war
Together we gain ground

Just like a shadow we sneak up behind
Don't take no prisoners, it's killing time

We're riding on the wings of Odin
In glory we believe

A kingdom at war
Forever stand united
A kingdom at war
Together we gain ground
Fight in the war
