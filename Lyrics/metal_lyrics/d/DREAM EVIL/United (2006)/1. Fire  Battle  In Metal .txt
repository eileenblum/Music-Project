I am your dark desire
The one that comes with fire
The one that gonna make you scream
Too late you will discover
I much more then a lover
I pay no fear your evil dream

Now its time for
Fire! Battle! In metal!
I live for the metal
Metal, screaming in Lightning
I cry for the metal and die for the metal

I am a Evil soldier
The mighty most of warrior
The one you wish you never seen
I am the king of darkness
You are staying homless
im gonna take your fast and clean

Now its time for
Fire! Battle! In metal!
I live for the metal
Metal, screaming in Lightning
I cry for the metal

When you think that is over
You will wake up and feel my breath
I will force you to feel the pain...again
When the morning is broken
You are falling down and out
But I still will come back for more

I am made for you
You are made for me

Fire! Battle! In metal!
I live for the metal
Metal, screaming in Lightning
I Fight for the metal

metal! fire! desire!
you live for the metal
you die for the metal
Fire!
