It's time to be the man
The man you have seen in your dreams
It's time to make a stand now, believe
Can't wait another day
Got to be quick now or fall
I swear to God to give it all

Stand by me, eternally
Forevermore, forevermore

Evilution, no matter who you are
Evilution, we're aiming for the stars
Evilution, to be or not to be
Evilution, believe

Your heart belongs with us
Your fate will fulfill our dreams
It's time to realize now, believe
The troops are gathered now
Prepare in the night we strike
I hope that God will heed the call

Stand by me, eternally
Forevermore, forevermore

Evilution, no matter who you are
Evilution, we're aiming for the stars
Evilution, to be or not to be
Evilution, Evilution, believe

If you don't like it
You don't have to breathe
Hail Satan, hail me
Spending your life in an unfulfilled dream
Hail Satan, hail me
