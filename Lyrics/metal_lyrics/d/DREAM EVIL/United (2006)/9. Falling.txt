Sunday morning
I want to leave this painful life
Yesterday's evening it was glorious
The king of the dancefloor
The man with the irresistible eyes
They could not deny it, I was glorious

But if they saw those eyes today
They should have screamed and walked away
Probably called 911

I am falling into the darkness
Once again I'm the joke, I am the clown
I am falling
And now I pay for my sins again

Friday evening
I'm out to take back the throne again
I warmed up my engine I am glorious
The queen of the dancefloor
She aims and shoots straight for my heart
I could not deny her, she was glorious

But if you saw her face today
You probably screamed and run away
I surely called 911

I am falling into the darkness
Once again I'm the joke, I am the clown
I am falling
And now I pay for my sins again

'Thou I'm awake I'm still dreaming
Everything's fake all around
When should I learn to not crash and burn
'Thou I'm awake I'm still dreaming

I am falling into the darkness
Once again I'm the joke, I am the clown
I am falling and now I pay for my sins again
I pay for my sins again
