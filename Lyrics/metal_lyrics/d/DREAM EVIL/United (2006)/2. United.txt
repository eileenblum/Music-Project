Welcome to the evil side
Spread the word nation wide
Come and drink this blood of mine
It will increase your metal spine

Promise you, time is now
your wounds will heal
Don't be scared, join the force of steel

We are all united
We will spread the word
All united
We can change the world

(How ball's roll each on their wheel?)
Metal warriors never kneel
Stand up proud prepare to fight
Srceam out loud your Metal, rise

Promise you, time is now
your wounds will heal
Don't be scared, join the force of steel

We are all united
We will spread the word
All united
We can change the world

We are all united
We will spread the word
All united
We can change the world
