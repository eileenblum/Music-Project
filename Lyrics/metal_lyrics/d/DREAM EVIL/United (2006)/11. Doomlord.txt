You can see him riding on the wind
You can see him with his wings of fire
Like the speed of light he rules the winter sky

When it's freezing cold he will come back
Like a fireball he's gonna be there
No one can take away his strong will to be free

You want this, you wanna be just as free
In starlight, black, red and white

Doomlord

In the forest you might hear him scream
Feel his anger, fear his fury
Blood-painted chest with a metal spine

You want this, you wanna be just as free
In the starlight, black, red and white

Doomlord

Cast in iron, this soul of mine, my metal spine...

Doomlord
