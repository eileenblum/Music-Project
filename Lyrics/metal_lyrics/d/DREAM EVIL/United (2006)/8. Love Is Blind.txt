How many years
Can I accept what's going on?
So many tears
I'm going blind
But love is blind
And I'm loving you till the end of time
Shall I wait and see?
It's up to me

You talk my name
But you wouldn't share my love
It's a shame of the road we ride
Give me peace
I turning into a beast
On the edge of suicide

Ease my heart of sin
Can you be the sound to give in
Leave your pain and hate
Come to peace before it's to late

A life in pain
Is a life we don't deserve?
Take my hand
In love we burn
The way you feel
You know that it's a shame
The love we had
Will fade away

Ease my heart of sin
Can you be the sound to give in
Leave your pain and hate
Come to peace before it's to late

But love is blind
And I'm loving you till the end of time
Shall I wait and see
It's up to me
