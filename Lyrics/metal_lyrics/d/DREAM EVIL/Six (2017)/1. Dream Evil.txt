When will you wake up
Start to realize your life is just a fake
No real opinions, just compromise
Your front's about to break
You're left, you're right, you're in-between
Got nothing real to say, yeah-yeah!
You live your life in a fantasy
It's the same thing every day

So listen up now little fool, open up your eyes
Lay your fears aside, you've got to speak your mind

You just see no evil, hear no evil
Speak no evil, you just dream evil!
Dream evil! So open up your eyes
Dream evil! Don't pretend you're blind
Dream evil! Say what's on your mind

We all know you're just a drama queen
No need for this charade
'Cause you're the one who's suffering
You're the one betrayed

So listen up now little fool, open up your eyes
Lay your fears aside, you've got to speak your mind

You just see no evil, hear no evil
Speak no evil, you just dream evil!
Dream evil! So would you be so kind
Dream evil! Don't pretend you're blind
Dream evil! Open up your eyes
Dream evil! Say what's on your mind

So listen up now little fool, open up your eyes, realize
Lay your fears aside, you've got to speak your mind
Don't let us down

Dream evil! Dream evil! Don't let us down
Dream evil! Dream evil! Don't be so blind
Dream evil! Dream evil! Gotta realize
Dream evil! Dream evil! You're just a lie
