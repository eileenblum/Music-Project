It all began that morning
When they came knocking on my door
They met my older brother who was weak
He was poor
He told them he believes in hell
And how they could be released
He asked them into our house
And called upon the beast

And the thunder rolled across the sky
And the wind picked up an evil cry
Can you feel it entering your mind?
Now is the time for the devil's sign

Sin city, sin city, evil's all around
Sin city, sin city, burned down to the ground
Sin city, sin city, the flames will make you drown
Sin city, sin city, so pretty

The devil proved to be really nice guy
And they partied all night long
Thou who always believed in God
Admitted they were wrong
The beast was really satisfied
And with a big smile on his face
He suggested that they should continue
But bring the party to a hotter place

And the thunder rolled across the sky
And the wind picked up an evil cry
Can you feel it entering your mind?
Now is the time for the devil's sign

Sin city, sin city, evil's all around
Sin city, sin city, burned down to the ground
Sin city, sin city, the flames will make you drown
Sin city, sin city, so pretty

The evil lives inside your mind
The evil lives inside your mind
The devil's giving you a sign
He wants to take you all away
In his flames we disappear
In his flames we disappear
We feel no pain
We feel no fear

Sin city, sin city, evil's all around
Sin city, sin city, burned down to the ground
Sin city, sin city, the flames will make you drown
Sin city, sin city, so pretty
