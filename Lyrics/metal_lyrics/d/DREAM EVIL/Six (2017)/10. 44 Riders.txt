It's after midnight, the air is warm
Chrome reflects the starlight, ignitions on
One by one the engines start
It's in our souls it's in our hearts
Hey you! Twist the grip now, here we go!

Summer night, a smell of gasoline
Feeling hiding riding with the wind
In moonlight, a trip from town to town
Old school rules, we are all blood bound

Me and my brothers travel with thunder
Iron horses we ride

Friday night, the engines roar
44 riders, ride until the dawn
Friday night, the engines roar
44 riders, ride until the dawn

On the road is where we want to be
When we stop a beer is what we need
Brotherhood, our passion is too ride
Adrenaline, need the speed to stay alive

Me and my brothers travel with thunder
Iron horses we ride

Friday night, the engines roar
44 riders, ride until the dawn
Friday night, the engines roar
44 riders, ride until the dawn

Then the darkness comes
With cold autumn winds
Hibernation time for the bikes
Love and honor bros
Keep your heads up high
In the dark winter time
We got beer to stay alive
To stay alive

Ride to live, live to ride
It's all we need to stay alive
Ride to live, to stay alive
