You've come too far to see the light
The fear is now your master
So from this deep you try to climb
From pain and your disaster

Soon you will find your peace in the fire
Your desire, so real

Take my hand
The demon, yes I am
Come get your fix
Six hundred and 66

This is the point of no return
The gate to domination
Face the fear and let it burn
This is your salvation

Soon you will find your peace in the fire
Your desire, so real

Take my hand
The demon, yes I am
Come get your fix
Six hundred and 66
