I'm the path to destruction
I'm your every lie
I'm the road to salvation
That is why I hide

You will need me and I'll be gone
Forever in my claws
You'll beg but I will tear you down

Just scream my name
I'll take you to hell and back
You will play my game
And fall through the crack

Hellride - The ride of your life
Hellride - The ultimate price

Now you know why you're shaking
Why you're terrified
I will stop you from breaking
'Cause I need your life

Now you fear my name
We are going to hell and back
We are one and the same
As we fall through the crack

Hellride - The ride of your life
Hellride - The ultimate price

Keep the fire burning, feed the flames
I will cleanse all worries, no more pain

Just scream my name
I'll take you to hell and back
You will play my game
And fall through the crack

Hellride - The ride of your life
Hellride - The ultimate price

Hellride - The ride of your life
Hellride - The ultimate price - Hellride
