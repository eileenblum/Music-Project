You are the one, you have no reason
You're like the sun, you have no seasons
You're on your own
No one tells you what to do
Alone but strong
You know it's all up to you

But your world is all an illusion
Behind the mask you're a lie

You're a creature of the night
Seek your prey after sundown
You're a creature of the night

You lost control, you're in denial
You sold your soul, you are a liar
There's no return
You can't go back to what's been
Your soul will burn
Still you make sin after sin

Behind the mask you're a lie

You're a creature of the night
Seek your prey after sundown
You're a creature of the night
You're a creature of the night
Seek your prey after sundown
You're a creature of the night
