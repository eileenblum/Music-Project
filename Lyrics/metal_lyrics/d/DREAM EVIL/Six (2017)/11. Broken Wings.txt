I choose the darkness
It's in my blood
I'm forged in the deepest depths of hell
And I am heartless
A broken spell
I rule the world and I do it well

Feel me creeping under your skin
As you beg you let me win

Fly free
Fly with your broken wings
Fly free

I am the strongest
I conquer all
I'll lift you up to see you fall
And you're addicted
Just one more time
I'm in your soul, I'm in your mind

Feel me creeping under your skin
As you beg you let me win

Fly free
Fly with your broken wings
Fly free

Take a leap into freedom
There's nothing, nothing
That will make you see
We're not stronger than the weakest link
Hold on, hold on
To your precious greed

Fly free
Fly with your broken wings
Fly free
Fly with your broken wings
Fly free
Fly with your broken wings
