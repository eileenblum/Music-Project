Down to zero, seatbelts on
I hear the engine start
Leave the tower, taking off
Good bye to ground control

I live my dream as I am leaving home
I spread my wings and fly away
Shooting through the night with balls on fire
Just like a bullet from a gun

Flying away into the night
Cruising the stars at speed of light
I do what I want, I'm out of control
I know just how to start a war

I reach a planet, it looks so nice
I want to set it down
But my ship is too big and I crush a home
And kill the emperor's wife

I take off right away, I have to flee
I set my course right back to home
But I didn't see them following
They are coming for revenge

Flying away into the night
Cruising the stars at speed of light
I do what I want, I'm out of control
I know just how to start a war
