The beer is cold, the night is hot
This party's going on for weeks
But we don't seem to get enough
So tell your friends to get on board
Bring your daughter, bring your wife
What's more important, bring more booze

The neighbors threats to call the cops again
But we're too high to understand what they say

We're too high, too loud, too drunk, too proud

All the girls they sing along
The stereo play our favorite song
The drumbeat rolling through the neighborhood
Don't you dare to fall asleep
Another drink is what we need
Metal warriors, they will never kneel

The neighbors, they have finally called the police
And they are welcome to our feast

'Cause we're high, too loud, too drunk, too proud

One day we will have to surrender
We will have to grow up
But not yet, we're still too young
And everybody wants to rock

'Cause we're high, too loud, too drunk, too proud
'Cause we're high, too loud, too drunk, too proud
