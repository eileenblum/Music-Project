It's time to choose your side
We've come too far and here we draw the line
It's time to change the game
I refuse to follow and live my life in shame

You hide behind your lies
And we are paying with our lives

Demons running through your veins
A display of broken dreams
You are the poison
And we're the antidote
You try to choose our fate
And make us your powerslaves
You are the poison
And we're the antidote

You think you are divine
Ruins and death is what you leave behind
But now we know your name
I refuse to follow and live my life in shame

You hide behind your lies
And we are paying with our lives

Demons running through your veins
A display of broken dreams
You are the poison
And we're the antidote
You try to choose our fate
And make us your powerslaves
You are the poison
And we're the antidote

Your devilicious plan
It will never stand
Trying to hide us in your graves
Evil incarnate show your face

You hide behind your lies
And we are paying with our lives

Demons running through your veins...
