Taste the truth, it's venomous
Sweet the taste of lies
Hide behind your ignorance
Belief is what you'll find

You gave your all and I was blind
Just lead the way and I will shine
Everything that's sane we leave behind
Now do the deed, the murdered mind

Greet the foes with agony
Make them feel the rage
Let us spread this leprosy
All unites in hate

You gave your all and I was blind
Just lead the way and I will shine
Everything that's sane we leave behind
Now do the deed, the murdered mind

I won't reveal what's underneath, it is sacred
Don't try to help, just let it sink
And drown in hatred

You gave your all and I was blind
Just lead the way and I will shine
Everything that's sane we leave behind
Now do the deed, the murdered mind
