We are forever
We are eternity
We're strong together
Through pain and agony

You broke the promise
You said we would be free
We did the labor
We lived in misery

Blood on the windows
Tears in the lake
This innuendo
Forced us to break
Tired and wounded
Blood on our hands
We were forsaken
In foreign lands

We stood beaten in the rain
Now you won

We are forever
We are eternity
We're strong together
Through pain and agony

We felt so broken
You thought we couldn't see
And then you forced us
To do dirty deeds

The dark is upon us
Reality wins
Crushed under sorrow
Scars on our skins
The weight we were under
Crushing our fate
Lonely and broken
We turned the stakes

We stood beaten in the rain
Now you won

We are forever
We are eternity
We're strong together
Through pain and agony
