Ripped me off, your wayward stream of thoughts
This is my bloodshed, this is my payback, war!
Your treasury of words, betrayal ab initio
Rejected and selected, as there hasn't been a final cause

A part of personality erased by animosity
Do you had epiphany?
I hope you still enjoy your life while I'm dying on the other side
This is my pain, this is my final fight!

I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna sledge you
I'm gonna make your life not worth to live
I wanna squeeze you, and you will bleed onto you
gonna catch on to the truth
I wanna slit your throat, I wanna break your nose
Repugnancy the sum of what you caused
I'll end this living hell, I swear in pain you'll dwell
You're not worth shit
AWAKE!
