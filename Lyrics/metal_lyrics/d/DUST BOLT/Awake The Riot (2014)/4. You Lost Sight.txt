Lost inside space and time, no wisdom there before
Mind pollution feeds the contents of lies, radiation growing more
Nuclear waste, we're running out of time - the stench and the scars remain
Prophets of death, control's refuse denied - the lesson is not taught in time
Breeding the hate in me - border's crossed, seems like you lost sight
The lesson is taught too late

Send more troops to win another war - braindead constructs
Spill more blood to terminate the fight - seems like you lost sight

Justice splits, poverty streets, got locked to see no ships that sink
Knowledge's lack, refused to hate - controlled braindeath served on plate
Nuclear waste is spreading like a disease - the stench and the scars remain
Blind gunfire, human greed succeeds - the lesson is taught too late

Send more troops to win another war - braindead constructs
Spill more blood to terminate the fight - seems like you lost sight

Destroy the earth 'til mankind has fallen piece by piece
Save your thoughts, as no one of us is forced to think
Continue your deceit - seems like you lost sight

Desolation, rotting seas, all pale - contradiction, worthless thoughts
Eradication, demand defines the rules to play the war
Send more troops to terminate the fight
Does your suit fit well? Is luxury allright? Seems like you lost sight
