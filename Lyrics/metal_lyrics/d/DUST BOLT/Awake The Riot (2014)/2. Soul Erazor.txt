To strike the empire of the ones who come down and take our visions to the though
Dominance of a masked way of lie, blind suppression rules the men
But I shall live when there's darkness left, I smash the lights of control
Thou shall fear the endless pain coming to erase their soul
Razorsharp the war will start, there is no hope for cure
Destroy - Take back your freedom now, just don't conform the bonds

Smash the servants, societies control
A bloodline, my pleasure
Awaking the riot, Soul Erazor

Running back there's nothing left, eternal war consumes
Bodies left in the killing spot, sickening thoughts control
But I shall live when there's nothing left, aggression is the rule
Label me insane passes easier for you
Go on killing what you can't attain

Clash the pretenders, executive's control
A bloodshed, my pleasure - forever determined
Smash the servants, societies control
A bloodline, my pleasure
Awaking the riot, Soul Erazor

Predatory violence, mandatory bloodshed
The measures of power to adapt 'em to the same
Media's message, subliminal oppression - stultification rules the mass
Individuals drop dead, pressure to success - meritocracy feeds the mind control
Bondage casting, everlasting - a soul erazor til the end

Suppression supports reality's control
A truth you want inflict on me
We stand forces to fight chains of humanity

Clash the pretenders, executive's control
A bloodshed, my pleasure - forever determined
Smash the servants, societies control
A bloodline, my pleasure
Awaking the riot, Soul Erazor
