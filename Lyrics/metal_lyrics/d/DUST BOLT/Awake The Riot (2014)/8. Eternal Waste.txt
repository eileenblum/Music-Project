The hordes and dreams are willing, with tempting thoughts to kill
To erase the pain forever, til justice shows its bill
Miles that we passed by - inconsiderate and braindead
You lived, I died - the hate breeds in my head

Torture! and sick propaganda, lies are shaking hands with men
Life burns down to ash, til nothing's left to win

Blinded by greed and possession, value drop out like ash
Once your friend, now an enemy - we're all victims of this tragedy
Resources put down in bags and slowly thrown away
No grasp to hold
Release us from this cage

In scenes of eternal, in fields of oppression
Torture and sick propaganda, death is calling from the grave
Life burns down to ash, til nothing's left to gain
In dreams of eternal
In fields of endless pain

In scenes of eternal waste

Darkness thrills through the light - dust rains in black haze
I live, you die - soaked and armed with hate

In scenes of eternal waste

Bodies drop dead, cities collapse - a living hell began
Injustice's been erased, discharged by common death
Equality now prevails

The strong and the weak, together they bleed - past led to penitence
Not until there's nothing left, our world will apprehend

Living in morbid hell, we do not learn a single thing in this dwell - eternal waste
Human race will burn away until we realize, we're living eternal waste
Insanity in minds - scenes of eternal waste
Living in a lie - scenes of eternal waste
