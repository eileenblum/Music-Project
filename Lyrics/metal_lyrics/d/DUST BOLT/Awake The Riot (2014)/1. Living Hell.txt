Attack! Welcome you're thrown to the spot you live inside the war
Casualties of world wide death on the last of the poor
Bloodthined, join the feast you'll be served the preys of the scheme
Methodical woolgathering malpracticed by the supreme

Eradicate the final goal, prosperity the single cause
Like a nuclear time bomb they'll send you into war
Born inside this living hell

Prison bars of social arrest, detonation of inner rage
Piercing loss of consciousness til the end of future days
Tattered until you're in the ditch, no one asks or cares when you get lost
Be another entry in the system; be a slave, conform, consume for any costs

Eradicate the final goal, prosperity the single cause
Like a nuclear time bomb they'll send you into war
Come and face agony
Tortured and born inside this living hell

A time bomb, they send you into war
Tortured, mistreated and broken down
Now your chances have died, a living hell has begun
You're born into a world of... a world full of lies!
We share the burden to bleed, we shall remain to fight

Dirty blood on every hand, isolated intimately
Toxicated formation, interaction of stupidity

Eradicate the final goal, prosperity the single cause
Like a nuclear time bomb they'll send you into war
Come and face agony
Tortured and born inside this living hell
