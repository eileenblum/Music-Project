Time is spinning round, a black circle of birth and death
Derogation of primal sense feeds the access to my final breath
All that we see or seem just a dream within a dream
Have we lost what once was real? did we trade our souls in causeless fear?
Born to die! A restless kind, conformed hardheaded minds
Living a lie! Only flesh and bones, inconsiderate and blind

Tell me that this war, show me that there's something more
Tell me that this battlefield is just another restless dream
Expose the truth, no hope - cannot stop the inner cold
Tell me that this restless fight is more than just living a lie

Like puppets, this little stage we dance on, not a care in the world
Just nothing, just another point in this picture of despair
Born to die! A lifetime spent in bone-crushing fear
Living a lie! Believe half of what you see and nothing that you hear

Tell me that this war, show me that there's something more
Tell me that this battlefield is just another restless dream
Expose the truth, no hope - cannot stop the inner cold
Tell me that this restless fight is more than just a waste of time
Waste of time

Tell me that this war, show me that there's something more
Tell me that this battlefield is just another restless dream
Expose the truth, no hope - cannot stop the inner riot
Tell me that this restless fight is more than just living a lie

Is this nothingness still worth to fight? Is there something beyond the shell?
Or are we just a marionette, a perfused cover encased with skin?
A plain sequence of DNA, a product of godless thoughts?
A proof for evolution fault - man machines without heart?
