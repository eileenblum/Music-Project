Predatory! The owner of the night
Through streets of demolition, unite for fight!
Kill those who oppress us, slay their mind control
You can't get us down, we're one in the war

Faster than you'll ever get
Crushing your bones and bringing death
- Agent Thrash!

No future, no rules to obey
Agents of thrash, in the pit, our destiny
Societies repulsion, the hypocrite's flame
We won't be a part of this reckless game

Drinking till it's dawn, get wasted every day
The owner of the streets, looking for his prey
Reluctantly seen, never been esteemed
The mad maniac he will stay

Faster than you'll ever get
Crushing your bones and bringing death - Agent Thrash!
