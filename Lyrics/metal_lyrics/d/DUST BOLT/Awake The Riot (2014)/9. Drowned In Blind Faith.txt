Come on sit right next to us, come clean, take the time
A rubdown is now what you get, as you still think that you're sublime
No sympathy for your rest, for fools like you who live with their limited minds
You went blind, you group in black and white, realize your time has died
Off my way, can't you see there's more than your sick aspects?
Brains for sale, in your ignorant ways to think, no capacity

People like you don't care for one another, you still believe in your power
Machine gun fire of hate is what you gather, there is no hierarchy in this hour
Traced by your bigotry - wake up from mediocrity
Narrowminded lunacy, for ignorance no sympathy
Drowned in your blind faith
No sympathy for you rest, for fools like you who live with their limited minds
You went blind, you group in black and white, realize your time has died
