Far behind! Where the last few steps are surrounded by four walls
Storm the fight! Where tales have lied and nothing's left for hope

Black will call you for the death, soon you shall lay to rest
There is no choice you see, no piece of legacy

Live when a thousands die, right inside the storm of lies
Face the ultimate death, the reign of fire
People pass and people come, the damage remains, can't be undone
A self destructive, appetizing hollow stain of mind

Places you've been in your head, all your crimson dreams are dead
Trust is an illusion, your biggest past mistake

Down to the ground, reach to the sky
No one's there to open the secret locks of lies
Chains we do serve, manipulatable minds
Blind masks hide our faces, beneath the earth we cry

Far behind! Where the last few steps are surrounded by four walls
Storm the fight! Where tales have lied and nothing's left for hope

Greed has formed a world of hate, voracity the cause to take
decisions made in insane ways for granted and in array
Trust it never has been real, where people trade their friends for bills
Despise the human race in all its ways

Places you've been in your head, all your crimson dreams are dead
Trust is an illusion, your biggest past mistake

Down to the ground, reach to the sky
No one's there to open the secret locks or ties
Chains we do serve, manipulatable minds
Blind masks hide our faces, beneath the earth we cry

No one to hear your cold voice - Silence! as you have no choice
Played every part of the game, lived in your own stream of lies - violence
Everything you did, you betrayed - everything you lost and forsake - regret
A mask hides your face - beneath the earth you shall remain
Played every part of the game, lived in your own stream of lies - violence
Everything you did, you betrayed - everything you lost
