Pain - belief lies dead, to act is to conform your autonomic ways, altruism is no more
War, for control mania - to possess and not to be
Human's hunt to dominate, burned deep in our quality

Live to empower my own need - no love, just insanity
A dagger laid to rest, until truth sows its seeds in worlds formed to deceive

Rational thoughts, greed for power - emotions hidden by lies
Reality unfolds a life so wrong, a story lies untold
War for estate mania, possession takes control
Since purpose left our sense lies dead - scared deep inside our souls

Live to empower my own need
A curtain built from emptiness
A followed lie succeeds
A dagger laid to rest, until truth sows its seeds in worlds formed to deceive

Live to die in emptiness, no core beyond the shell
Promises just another way to lie, a conscience to betray
Fate - we all write our stories meant to be heard
Filled up pages, with empty words
Live to empower my own need - no love, just insanity
A dagger laid to rest, until truth sows its seeds in worlds built to deceive
