A place in fear, a scene in pain,
lasting chaos in the dust
The battle is on and warfareÂ´s cruel,
tornados of bullets, the next attack
nothingÂ´s left from days of commands,
metal strikes the pigs abolition
ruthless in the face
Run to War!
opressing forces fall!
no distinctions in fields
of Violent demolition
end in pain, if you wanna judge us
abusing your tall force
damaged weÂ´ll keep on
joining the pit to save our lifes
years have bred a youth in rage,
a bloody pit gone wild
violent abolition will end tonight,
ruined dreams shall now arise we run to war!
opressing forces fall!
the power obsessed we fight
with violent demolition
demolition, thrash!
a place in rage
keeps thrashing the wasted land,
in the pit! run to war!
opressing forces fall
violent abolition leads to war
we fight violent abolition
in fields of violent demolition
