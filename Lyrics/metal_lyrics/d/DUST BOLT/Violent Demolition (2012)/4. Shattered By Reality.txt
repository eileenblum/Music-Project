Truth layed down
in words to hollow wounds
into the never again I'll wander
blood drained mind
violent declined

Butchered me back there,
cut me in the groin
cut me in the leg,
profused blood flowing
tried to spill me in your form,
an irrevocable failure
my vengeance on society's humiliation,
killer!

Cruelty, callousness beyond human feeling
existence turned to execution,
my nemesis revealing
there is no prison more relentless
then your inner self
Your parasites look straight at me,
you will see yourself

In violence

Truth layed down
words to hollow wounds
open my chest you will see
a shattered personality

Hateful morbid mind
aggressions now arise
orders and shapes designed for consciousness
this is your veil on your way to death

Truth layed down
in words to hollow wounds
your lack of identity

Blood drained mind
violent declined
open my chest for you will see
I'm shattered by reality
