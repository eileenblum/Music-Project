The sea of men being conquered by their lies
blown backwards by lost souls - genocide
with hate I rise, spreading that we must die
now we'll kill the sea, we rise
we're leaving our souls, hell's riot fight

Break down chains of lying threats
terrorize til' bloodlust is stilled
shredding strength of melting death
innocence is being killed

Oppression it ends, bleed to feel,
life's downfall, evil's overcome to the end

Death is on, it's killing now
our hell prolonged - into madness
the sin is formed from down below
your evil vault - into madness

The sea of men being liven up by lost souls
Fucking smashed, running small
in temptation's eye, we're spreading that we must

Breakdown chains of lying threats
terrorize til bloodlust is stilled
shredding strength of melting death
innocence is being killed

Oppression it ends, bleed to feel
Evil's overcome to the end
