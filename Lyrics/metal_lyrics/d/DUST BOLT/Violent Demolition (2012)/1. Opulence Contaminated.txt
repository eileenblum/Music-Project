Drawback! Havoc has won
we starve on rich tables
profiting of their ruin
opulent born, accepting to murder.
This is our faith, our human grace order?
Eternally we kill -
deathless they shrill
a global act of calm,
a beauty ruled society 
eradicates the raw
a profit swallow, 
death will follow,
trash now fills your soulless hollow
in clustered stupidity we shall
become our worst enemy

The deserts of black are rising,
opulence just soon will kill
destroying the unbelievers,
til opulence to doom will thrill

Toxic! We build our own bust waste dump
and bash it to the weak but
pollution will not end
till voracious souls retreat
demand for more and greed
for things we don't need
opulence devastates and builds
our own decay

The deserts of black are rising,
opulence just soon will kill
destroying the unbelievers,
til opulence to doom will thrill

Death! The closer calls,
take your own last breath
Torture! A ravenous brawl,
for greed killed our camped sanity
