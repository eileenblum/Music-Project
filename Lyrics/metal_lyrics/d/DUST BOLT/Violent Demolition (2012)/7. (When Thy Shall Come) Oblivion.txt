Savage sphere, killing floor
Spiritual spite in this one coursed world
Cluttered mass, one takes four
Decadence our daily bread, our overall
This is why earth coincides
The pestilence of life
The plague of mankind
Existence destroys

Warpath, killing floor
Lunatic hordes in a deaf, dull world
Endless pain, one takes all
This is our gift behind shelter walls
Start up, this new will
This that feeds our virous drill
Structure death, caustic trays
This is your philosophy
Now this is why
Earth coincides

The pestilence of lies
The plague of our mankind
A severe taste of failing
The end of human race
Existence is pain

One world one place to contradict its brains
When lobbyism rules the world and causes killing pain
One kind, one man, to devastate
A ground of nature lovely that has lost its purity, did you forget

Our seas will dry, all life shall die
Dead birds will be raining from a blackened sky
I end, I'll go to a world of thrones unknown
An endeavor so wrong, what have we done
Keep convenience, deny mortality
Conform, consume your insanity
Live on your lives resembling leprosy
Let's eat the world, until we'll eat ourselves
Without me
