Build for profit, failed for Earth, last resources die
machines on fire spread to toxic gas after the explosion consummates
we're diving down into the pit!
Machines
determined to feed, to kill,
another toxic agent lives

Dehydrate or bathe in melting poisoned ash,
agent death arise
dust rules the wits from nuclear attack,
existence leaves this race
in fields of pain of dying plants,
fire reigns the Earth
contamination now in every place,
displaying our toxic game

Determined to feed, to kill,
another toxic agent breathes

Obsessed now to kill, determined to will
enforcing the kill, human machines begin
to breathe
toxic attack
toxic attack

Death and pain fire reigns the Earth
Attack! - Pollution displays our morbid game
Toxic! - A new born venom agent lives
Demolition! So violent in fields of dying men

Determined to feed, to kill,
another venom agent breathes
Toxic Attack
Toxic Attack
Dust rules the wit prepare to die
by Toxic Attack!
