Talk talk but you've never learned to refuse or to
Disagree and find beliefs you call your own drawn
By your leader's words rasterized in chains your course is set and foretold
Can't step outside your porch you throw away your life and take the easy ride
The common sense to hide between black and white

No I won't change my way no reason for me to stay

Face of a smug - I can't do nothing but break free from all you are
Brain wide shut no sense for nothing
You erased your heart you're fucking blind to art

All you seed becomes staid
A narrow-minded concept of pretended success
But you build your own hell
What does not come from within is sadly forced to pale

What about the beauty of variety and all the art you never felt, you never did?
Can't you see the win of creativity? Or is it something you can't stand?

Need to get away
And find another place

Face of a smug - I can't do nothing but break free from all you are
Brain wide shut you can't see nothing
You erased your heart you're fucking blind to art

I don't need your world of hypocrisy - blind to art
Leave you behind and follow my own beliefs - blind to art
And I don't care about assaults or words you say - blind to art
I'll go my path and be taking the hard way - blind to art

They said I'm doing it all wrong
They said I'm living for an utopia

I'm a dreamer they say
Cause I'm doing it my own way
