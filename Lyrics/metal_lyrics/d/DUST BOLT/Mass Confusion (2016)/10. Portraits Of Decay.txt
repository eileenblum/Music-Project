Blood that's dropping silently
Washed away beneath dead leaves
Storms are weeping desperate cries
A world that's dying right before our eyes

But yet another day we are crumbling away
As time attests its impact in the mirror of decay
The bottles are speaking volumes
To nurse the pain of change
As grounds that once seemed solid decided just to fade

I can see it's coming near, like a chronic cold disease
When all that's seeded once grew wide becomes your enemy
As we burn all that is left to be
Light a fire burning down the rest of me

Our hands are bound in fury and the seas
Seem to cede to move on with this dying day
In these portraits of decay

How should I catch the light when I can't even catch myself?
Too far away clarity seems distant in this cold abandoned hell
And we take and we take but who cares who's to give?
Did we lose our hearts did we ever exist?
Sometimes it feels like an edgeless dagger stinging into the ribs

I can see it's crawling nearer, a chronic cold disease
As all that's seeded once grew wide becomes an enemy
As we take all that is left to be
Drink my blood and eat the rest of me

The plants are dug in fury and the seas
Seem to retrieve their waves back from this dying breed
I wonder if it matters if I leave or if I stay
Will it get worse or just a painful other day
In these portraits of decay?
