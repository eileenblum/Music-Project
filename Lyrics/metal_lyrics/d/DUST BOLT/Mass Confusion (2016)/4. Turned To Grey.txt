Vanities get shut, hear the starting shot
These nights are our nights that we play
We all came together, adrenalized blood
Let's bring on what was taken away
Cut down the fences, break every wall
High is the night that we face
This is our game and we are meant to destroy
No one will change our, change our way

The lights get smashed this spot'll be splashed
You've lost your say
Our force won't go away
It's the end for us to blame
The ones that do create more than just fake

But today the dye got washed away
And there's nothing left to say
No single thing will be OK
When everything has turned to grey

Everything has turned to grey

We came to bring the barrier down
Nothing justifies to separate
Let's tear down the borders and come together as one
No longer we'll accept the doctrine
A riot on fire, with burning desire
A message for all out to see
Cut down the fences and break every wall
Let's paint this place as it should be

The lights get thrashed
This spot'll be splashed
You've lost your say
Elitism gets smashed
Our blood - we all share red
Collective strength to spread something meant to last

But today the dye got washed away
And there's nothing left to say
It's the start of our decay
When everything has turned to grey

Units are coming to tear away
My last place of dreams and faith
Soon everything is forced to fade

As they tramp on our beliefs
Like lifeless cold machines
They kill until the last piece bleeds

When the dirt gets washed away
And there's nothing left to say
The beginning of our decay
When everything has turned to grey

When our thoughts get locked away
You'll be forced to meet your fate
Nothing ever lasts in world so pale
When everything

When our dreams get thrown away
It's the beginning of our decay
When all colours begin to fade
And everything has turned to grey
