It's not you that I hate potentially it's still myself
Just trying to keep the distance meant to guarantee my health
A part of me that's fighting it, a part of me that's dead
Overcoming is a sacrifice. An avoidable mistake.
Protection of my own. Protection of my fear.
A drift away from anything inside that once seemed real
Repugnancy implanted from the head unto the toe
A monster living deep inside that I still see in you

Fuck

Lost inside the pain, the needle strikes, feeding the insane
I'm lost inside my head
Rotting skin, deep within it's dead

Every time it hits me as I rebound, like a slap
I didn't foresee things are gonna fuck with me like that
Same old day, same old shit, can't stand it all, sick of it
Distant shades, substantially pale
Look at me - see the eyes of a dead man's face
Marginal - on the floor, a chunk of waste
I'm sick. Too sick to continue it

Lost inside the pain, the needle strikes, feeding the insane
I am lost inside my head
Rotting skin, deep within I'm dead

Burned in deep within my head
Too much time wasted
A spoiled complex within
A soul at rest
All these demons inside
Too many days wasted
As the waves crush apart
Stepless
Allergy deep within me
Allergy - need to let it be
Allergy - there's no choice you see
The reason I despise it all is...
