You erased me buried me deep in the ground
Again another worthless try to bring me down
Without mercy and sleepwalking my mind
Tried to kill my fire but it won't die

Blistering pain neurotoxic drenched veins
An acardiac creature made me totally insane
You spit stings but watch me step aside
One by one your shape of glass' gonna die
Just a snitch - that gets smashed
Count your every second cause your life won't last
I see you and I see war
Foot the bill and knock on your death's door

I can't relate to people sucking off
And make their living out of other's pain
Got stabbed chewed up spat out then fucked
More times than you can spell my name

We all lie when we look into the mirror
But you can't lie when you're facing death
Just follow me one step closer
And you'll be taking your last breath

Every laugh of you becomes a leech placed on my neck
The rope tied on my head
Just a matter when you tighten it
You spit stings but I spit fire
Final stroke finite no more fake messiah

A fucking snitch - that gets smashed
If I told you all the names you caused me to detest
I see you and I feel pain
So stay the fuck away from me
Last breath

We all lie when we look into the mirror
But you can't lie when you're facing death
Just follow me one step closer
And you'll be taking your last breath

Everyone's to mortice his weights and to fight his own cruel war
Doesn't implicit we can throw our bombs and take aim at other's doors
As you spread your pain and spread violence you expose your evil ways
Can forgive but sure I won't forget until my final day

Here I am waiting to die
Never again no more lies
Never trust
Never again
