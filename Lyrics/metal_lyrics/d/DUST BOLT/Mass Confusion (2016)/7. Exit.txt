Like these seven claws of pain
The rain is coming down against
List. A thousand miles away
Comes undone. It's better to run
With the wind. Like dust to fade
Again it aches

Sky spreads open wide as the loosened ties
Make him seem given to fly
Staring and waiting to die
Uncomfortable to live this life
But at least he tried

Knowing when he's gone that sure it'll hurt
Caused by the fact that the sun feels nothing
But at least that's something
Though this exit was meant for you
You won't realize and you won't care
Does he care?
Through the days he was facing the ground,
Broken
Did you win?
Though his destiny, the words he speaks
Do they mean a thing?

You might think he's living a dream
But can't you see his nightmare?
Trying to run and hide from the devil
He surely knows but he can't find
What more could he ask for?
