Lifeless cold bodies - as a plague for themselves
Won't discern from the living dead
But does anybody else?
Do they feel the pain? Breathe the air I breathe?
Lost and drowned identities these empty faces killing me

Every day it surrounds you the rope tightened around your neck
This brain solitude leads to mind chaos
I wonder how much more can I take?
Just shades of shapes
That cover shadows of their lives
I think I will not make as this ground's too slick to stand it
Please help me handle my hate

It grieves me to see that we've lost our life - dead
Displeasing me I can find nothing more than (nothing more than)

Lifeless cold bodies - as a plague for themselves
Won't discern from the living dead
But does anybody else?
Do you know the pain? Share the view of my eyes?
Lost and drowned identities these empty faces I despise

Grown up in this world confused
From birth to death this life abused
Base motives that rule our forgotten core
I'd rather disappear and do not wanna see
The ones I need my enemies
We had to chance to live in peace but chose war

It's not the story we tell, it's about the story we live
Mind polluted from a constant lie
As long as we fall we're meant to live in pain
Until we die

It grieves me to see that we've lost our life - dead
Release me I can't take any more

Lifeless cold bodies - as a plague for themselves
Won't discern from the living dead
But does anybody else?
Do they know the pain? And breathe the air I breathe?
Lost and drowned identities these empty faces hunting me

Empty
I can't eradicate my mind
Got used to live this daily fight
Gotta deal with being the one to hate myself
Do I differ from anybody else?
