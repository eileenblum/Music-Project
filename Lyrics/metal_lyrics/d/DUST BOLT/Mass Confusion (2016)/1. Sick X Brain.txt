Guess who's that
The psycho sick-head thrashed up guy
Presumed dead, almost smashed
But resurrected back on track

A tale of a living psycho
Deep inside his brain
Gossiped viciously about
Every step attained

As they watch him as he fights
For legacies before death
They see him jumping off the walls
Hits the barrel against his head

Refuse to conceive him
Displeased as you touch him
All efforts formed to rotten
In pain but not forgotten

Gotta gotta sick brain
Gotta take the sick brain
Had to buy this sick brain
Gotta deal with sick brain

Sick sick brain
