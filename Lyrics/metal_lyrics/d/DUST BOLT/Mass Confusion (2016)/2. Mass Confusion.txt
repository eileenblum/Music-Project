Found yourself in bullets under flak of control guides
Religious lines and media folded and channelled your whole mind
You are not supposed to dispute though
We sprawl in violence and pain
As we're fattened by these preset codes
It is ourselves who we betray

Hypocritical are all the lies that we seed
And polemical when you're looking at me
So fucking critical my eyes that you see convulsing your whole ground
It's cynical and crazy world that we're in and I can see us all and
How we're losing our sense
Not just political should be decisions we pledge
They must come from within

Covering up your eyes tearing down our faces
Wanting us all to live a masquerade
The day everybody lives in confusion

Dreams lie smashed, they're laid to rest
Life's substance's purchased in a can
Can't you see that he who's not burning will never ever fan the flame?
Breastfeeding our suppressed lives and thickening it
With blood that they gained out of war
Subordinated bent and good saluting too by choice
We swapped maturity to conform

It's hypocritical all the lies that we seed
So pathetical when you're looking at thee
So uncritical think you can find what you need
But you have lost yourself
It's cynical and crazy life that we lead
And can't you see the war and how it's soaking our breed?
So goddamn criminal for the sake of prestige
We spend our life in bad faith

They cover up our eyes tearing down our faces
Making us all to live a masquerade
The day everybody lives in confusion

You keep staring at me
Something you've never seen
Lost in stupidity
You're just an empty face to me
Welcome to Mass Confusion

Covering up your eyes tearing down your faces
Making us all to live a masquerade
The day everybody lives in confusion

Mass Confusion

Think for yourself
