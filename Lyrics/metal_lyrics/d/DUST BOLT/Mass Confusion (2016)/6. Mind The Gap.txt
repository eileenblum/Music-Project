You think you can storm into my house, think you can take away what is my choice.

âDo what youÂ´re told, youÂ´d better watch out and look alive and afterwards
shut your little mouth.â

Want me to act like a marionette. But let me show whatÂ´s real and that I wonÂ´t fuckin act.

Raise the flag, demonstrate your pay. But you wonÂ´t kill whatÂ´s built and meant to stay.

Your last chance to take my hand, was thrown away back at the day weÂ´ve met.

And you will never see the things IÂ´ve seen
Please mind the gap between me and your society.

By the try to escape this sick worldÂ´s rules, I find out more weÂ´re all playing the fool
And IÂ´m echoed in the same old patterns, that I tried to break loose
The more I see, the more I do, the more I know that I hate you.
IÂ´ll never miss and let me say you wonÂ´t brake me to go my way
hear the sound you dumb ass canÂ´t relate.
Heartless minds, disimpassioned kinds
howÂ´ll you react to this to ensuing lines?

Are you afraid of death? Is it cause youÂ´ve never started living?
Make sure IÂ´ll dance on your grave, cause thereÂ´ll be no one else, no one else coming.

And you will never see the things IÂ´ve seen
Please mind the gap between me and your society

You, you think you know. But this is my life and not your life, that youÂ´ll never own.

And I will never get old. None of my body, not my mind. You canÂ´t have my soul.

Mind the gap between me and you cause IÂ´am fucking wasted and youÂ´re just a fool.

And you will never see the things IÂ´ve seen
Please mind the gap between me and your society.
