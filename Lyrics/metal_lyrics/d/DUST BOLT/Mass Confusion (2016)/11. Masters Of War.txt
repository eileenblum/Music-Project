Now it's time to proceed it's our time to defend
No your mass confusion won't succeed and drench my sick brain
Through the sound of the guns
Through the pace of your bombs
There still lightning telling me to go on fighting for hope
Might seem simple to kill
Might seem easy to hate
But how can something emerge by going the easy way?
Call me young and naive
Overzealous barefaced
But you masters of war won't capture me with your game
All your money and glory
Will it be on your side?
Don't you forget to tell me
At the day when you die
