[Music: Lenny Bruce / lyrics: Lenny Bruce]

Now close your eyes,
Now can you see?
Can you dig inside
And find what's meant to be?
Open your arms,
Break off to breathe
Embrace the pain inside
And how it's soaking in

You hurt yourself
For you to see
No wrongs or rights
But still a will to be
Clench your fist
Squeeze the feel
Do you taste the real?

Now you're trapped
You're trapped in chaos
Trapped you're trapped and
Still you can't find
What's left behind
It's desecration
And in the end you start to mold
'Cause you are trapped in chaos

I punched my head for you to see
No wrongs or rights
But still a will to be
And when you leave
I'll chose to die
Do you taste the life?

And now we're trapped
Trapped in chaos
Trapped
We're trapped and
Still we can't find
What's left behind
It's desecration
And in the end you start to mold
'Cause we are trapped in chaos

When we were born to die
We signed up with life
But I could not foresee
This radioactivity
