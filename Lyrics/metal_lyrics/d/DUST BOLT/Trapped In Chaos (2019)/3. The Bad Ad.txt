[Music: Lenny Bruce / lyrics: Lenny Bruce / Sarah Kane]

I think that you think of me
The way I'd have you think of me
Dying in the arms of a soulless womb
Watch my final defeat
Sanity is found where madness is scorched
From the bisected soul
Back to my roots as everything dies
And walks away with a killing smile

Still black deep water
As cold as the sky
Cease this war as I shall freeze in hell,
Ready to die
The swords in my dreams,
The dust of my thoughts,
The sickness that breeds
In the folds of my lungs
Watch me vanish
Now watch me die

Through the night
No sirens no more
In this fight
Walk out the back door
The world will see
The pain I adore
You and me â two enemies
That's all we'll ever be

A bad ad for me

To you I'm just a bad company
That don't do someone good
A mind full of attacks and lightning
So better get off of me
If you need someone to please,
To demonstrate what you achieved
You'd better don't stay right next to me
But run as fast as you can

Still black deep water
As cold as the sky
Cease this war as I shall freeze in hell,
So ready to die
The pain in my dreams,
The dust of my thoughts,
The sickness we have brought to this world
Watch me vanish
Watch me die

Through the night
No sirens no more
In this fight
Walk out the back door
The world will see
The pain I adore
You and me â two enemies
That's all we'll ever be

Through worthless nights
Through too many days that I've tried
Tried to be
Something but a bad ad for me.
