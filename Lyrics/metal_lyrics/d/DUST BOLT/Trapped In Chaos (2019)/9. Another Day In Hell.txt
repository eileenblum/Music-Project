[Music: Lenny Bruce/ lyrics: Lenny Bruce]

Tried to seek what I've never did,
I've never seen before
Lost in the pace of the battle of these days
In the battle for something more
If I can reach that I'd ever feel
What I haven't reached before
Don't tell me there has ever been
Another way
Another way to walk

Another day in hell

I will fade into oblivion
Like I've never lived before
Tossed in the sand soon the better of my days
Relieve the bitter days I once wore
I've tried to consider that it's soothing
When you're moving through the motion
Without holding 'til your dead and gone
To achieve a better day
Without anything or anyone at all

Another day in hell

If you got close and scratched my edges,
Screaming loudly at my door
Don't tell me that it ever meant,
That it ever meant something more

When I burn out and you shut the door
I've might not seen it all
If I can be what I've ever been
I never need
I never needed more

Another day in hell

When I fall down to another day
When I dig deep into another wave
When I fall down though I'm bound in chains
It's another day
Just another day in hell
Another day in hell
