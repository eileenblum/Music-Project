[Music: Flo Dehn / lyrics: Lenny Bruce]

Time
Are we just wasting time?
With pictures in our minds
Of things we chase but can't need inside
Time
Why are we wasting time
Too painful we can't find
What's set to grow
Deep in our minds
Soulless inside
Killing time
Soulless inside
Killing time
Crawl in my brain
'Til it doesn't let me go
Time goes insane
There's nothing to be told
Can't find the inside
Distracted mind
Soulless inside
Killing time
