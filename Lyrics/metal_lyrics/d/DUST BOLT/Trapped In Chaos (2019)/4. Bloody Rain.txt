If I count down the bloody days
A fact, no dream, a quarantine
If I come down and I wasted me
A trap, a run through a bloody maze
A push swallow deep
Life's got what's killing me
Talk indiscreet
I don't wanna say, I don't wanna stay

I am stained
In bloody rain
Run till you die in vain
High, join me endless ride
Ghosts who cannot find the lane
Why aren't we trying?
To try to think we cannot see?
Life, the reasons
Washed away like dirt with bloody rain

If I come down it's killing me
A badge for things that you wouldn't say
If I move on but remain the same
If I proclaim to be ok
The cop and the thief
Both got what's killing me
God, I'm not here
And I've never been, I'll never be

I am stained
In bloody rain
Run till you die in vain
High, join me endless ride
Ghosts who cannot find the lane
Why aren't we trying?
To try to think we cannot see?
Life, the reasons
Washed away like dirt with bloody rain

Bloody rain
Bloody rain

You are nothing
So am I?
Let us dance
Among the bloody sky
