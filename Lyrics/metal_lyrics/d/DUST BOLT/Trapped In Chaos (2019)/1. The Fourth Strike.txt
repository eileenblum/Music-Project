[Music: Lenny Bruce / lyrics: Lenny Bruce]

Trapped in the maze
In a horror pace
Trapped in walls of time
Trapped in this nightmare
Trapped inside this mind
Black inked sheets
Scars that bleed
Patch every day of your life
The fourth strike
Awaking beliefs that died

Feel the fire lit
Demolition at its birth
Hear the blistering shatter
Through your burning earth
See this fire lit
Demolition at its birth
Hear the blistering
Destruction ripping
Through your bones
The fourth strike

Trapped in these days
Between endless ways
Pass the memories by
Trapped in this chaos
Trapped inside this life
Black inked sheets
Scars that bleed
Stand the march of time
The fourth strike
Awaking a pain that died

Friends they are dropping away
Like a time bomb
Lit as the years pass by
The fourth strike
Another try to escape
Of a man on the edge to die
Nothing but the truth to his darkness
Displays his only desire
Grab hold of the soul
Where the lights have been closed
And set this man on fire
