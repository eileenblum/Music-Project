[Music: Lenny Bruce / lyrics: Lenny Bruce / Sarah Kane]

Rhythm to my madness
I can see it in your eyes
Like a fire
Like a burning wish to get off the ties
A rhythm to this madness
A healing pain inside
Violence in blood features
Lost of control
It's a pain that lives within our minds
That needs to be alive

This is the rhythm to my madness
A storm before eternal night
This is my medicine of savage
A mind trick to resist this fight
Your truth, your lies, not mine

Days to dream and nights to think
Nothing's what I might achieve
Days to dream and nights to think
Nothing's what I might achieve
But it needs to be alive

This is the rhythm to my madness
A storm before eternal night
This is my medicine of savage
A mind trick to resist this fight
Your truth, your lies, not mine
This is the rhythm to my madness
Madness
Madness
Madness
