[Music: Lenny Bruce / lyrics: Lenny Bruce]

Sick of living in illusion
Sick to swallow my disgust down
Shed surrounding false conclusions
Shed twisted limitations

Let me be
Let me be what I am
24 but I still don't understand
Let me be let me be
My worst friend
Let me try, until the end

I'm gonna shed my skin
Relieve the pain inside
Gonna shed my skin for living 'til I die
I'm gonna shed my skin
And make this war an end
Gonna shed my skin
Before I'm dead

Sick to follow your directions
Sick to live in your control
Shed all these irritations
Shed anything I own

Let me be let me be what I am
20 past 4, I still don't understand
Can you try to take my hand?
And I won't go, not 'til the end

I'm gonna shed my skin
Relieve the pain inside
Need to shed my skin for living 'til I die
I'm gonna shed my skin
And make this war an end
Gonna shed my skin
Before I'm dead
Before I'm dead.
