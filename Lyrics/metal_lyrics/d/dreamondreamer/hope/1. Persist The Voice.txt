You called us sons and you would be promising this time..
We all wake up under the same sun.

(And this is nothing without you here
I stare at the blank chair because you're all alone)

Oh god can you tell me why is everything I see a tragedy?

(It's left us wondering what is this for?
Just say something, something you really feel.)

(We walked this way before)

Just waiting till it all comes to an end.

(And now it is all gone)

We pray with sirens till we all fall apart
This is me calling out to a man that knows my destiny.
Clouds will be waiting at the end where our father ones shook our hands.

(Give me strength, Give me reason
Give me something that I can hold on to so I'll never stand alone)

I wont praise you anymore with your promises nailed to a wall.
You let me down so many times wake up wake up please give me a sign.
We all wake up under the same sun
Walking miles towards reached out hands to see that this is never gonna end.

(Make sense of this at all, can't give it no more
Do all these empty words that I repeat help me in any way at all

We've walked this way before
And now that its all gone)

I always wondered why you looked down, looked away when I felt you were so close..
I'm standing on the edge on my own. Will you come and save me?
Still standing on the edge on my own. You will come when I am gone.
