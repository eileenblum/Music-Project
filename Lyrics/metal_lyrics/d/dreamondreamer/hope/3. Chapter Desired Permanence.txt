Still looking for a day it all comes true
Where we sing this song together and remember 
every word that you said, every king is dead. 
Another day. Another way. Why is everything so far away?

(Far away)

Everything around me is fading away. 
Why can't you stay, hold me, break me free.

(Everything I say and do is useless to me)

Why can't we be another perfect dream?

(If I had one wish right now you know I'd make the earth shake)

so you would hold on to me and we would never break. 
You wont forget any of those portraits
You wont listen to the sound when my heart breaks.
You wont forget...
Can you hear the sound of my dying voice?
Can you hear the sound of me trying to avoid...
Another faceless dream in another scenery.
You cant just fall asleep in another mystery.

(Everything I say and do is useless to me, 
Why can't we be another perfect dream?
Everything around me is fading away. 
Why can't you stay, hold me, break me free.)

When we look up to the sun we both know that we never going under.
When we look up to the sun we both know that we never going under.
