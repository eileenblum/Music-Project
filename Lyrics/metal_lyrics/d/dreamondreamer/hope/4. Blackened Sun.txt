Bright skies on my mind 
Am I a free man or a prisoner?
I spent all my life trying to survive. 
Tired eyes don't feel this way.
I've been awake for far too long. 
I'm over feeling like the only man alive.
A story with no end.

(Delay the senses that came to us)

Father can you hear me? 
Why don't you see us struggling?

(Nothing's left in our head, we've all forgotten the last line so help us with this one)

Why can't you see that everyone you love is hating?
You won't die in my own hands.
Don't be afraid just yet.
If you take one step and push away those dreams you will soon enough again wake up 
to the memories of times shared.

(So now we'll sing, just because it's beautiful
And not because it sounds sane
And now we'll sing, just because it's beautiful
And not because we can)

Now that your lies are all unfold
You would see that my hands aren't as cold as you think they would be.

With no direction, just straight ahead.
Ignored will be my voice which was meant to save.
Save you from a story that you wont ever forget.
A story with no end.
We can't be stopped.
