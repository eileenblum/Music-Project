Spread out like an open book trying to be understood.

I walk with my own ideals and leave my life shut in pages.
Find the key and read between the lines.
Between the lines it stands.

No book can ever tell you this.

More than thousand words will be explained with those eyes.

Did you really think you would believe in this?

(I would like to repeat myself) again and again but it should be clear enough.
(clear enough for you to take your) your eyes off me, your eyes off this world.
Your eyes off me, your eyes off this world.

Dance dance if you wanna.
Dance dance coz you never get enough.
Dance dance if you wanna.
Coz this shits gonna get rough.

I don't follow any kings when queens will soon put their faith in me.

(I would like to repeat myself) again and again but it should be clear enough.
(clear enough for you to take your) your eyes off me, your eyes off this world.
Your eyes off me, your eyes off this world.

You drown in your dreams while I pull up my anchor. 

For the ones who never listened.
For the ones who failed in trying.
You drown in your dreams while I pull up my anchor.
