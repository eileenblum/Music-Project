I'll be remembered as the one
Who never was afraid to fall 
You said you would be able to crawl up 
You fold your words to dreams

Nothing but an exaggeration of words you used to say
From now on alone

(I said stop starring)

I said stop staring at the ground
When the door is wide open

And now this stands
The test of time
Another section broken off
Do you have me in mind
I hope that one day, we will be able to sleep again 

We will be able to sleep again

(Escaped as two remained as one)
From now on alone
You'll remember our days when we used to watch the skies clouds
We had plans to
Find peace and harmony

I look down to you now and see what you've become
