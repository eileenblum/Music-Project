Everyday there's something new to bring me down
Worlds collide, no answers to be found
But don't get me wrong, it's not you I blame
I just never learned to live without the pain

[Bridge]
Somehow I've lasted until the end
Without the thought I never could survive alone
Somehow I've lasted until the end
But I don't feel the same no more

[Chorus]
I'm letting go that feeling you once cared
I'm letting go that feeling we once shared

Everyday there's something new to dream about
Passing lives, universal doubt
Don't get me wrong, it's not you I blame
But I won't forget the person you became

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

It fell apart in the end, but you know the reason why
You went looking on that other side
I keep searching or that man I left behind
But I fear he's lost in another time
I'll find a way through this water before I drown
And I'll be back to show you all
You can't keep me down

[Chorus]
