I've never feared sleep so much
Or dreams that come in the night
When will I find all that I need
How can I live without you

[Bridge]
Nowhere left to turn and nowhere to hide
No one left to believe in or care about
You said that you were leaving
But I've no time for goodbyes
That only means there's nothing to lose anymore

I have been lost for so long
Lost in the fear I would die alone
There's no one left to bring me down
How can I live without that

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Outside I left my pain
And headed for the door
You used your lies to get inside
I won't be the victim no more

Well I'm older now and learning to forget
But I just can't hide the scars you gave me
With every day I think I'm farther from my heart
Further from the place I long to be

You left me in the dark
When I would die for you
With every lie
You know you said goodbye
You sealed that coffin shut

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
