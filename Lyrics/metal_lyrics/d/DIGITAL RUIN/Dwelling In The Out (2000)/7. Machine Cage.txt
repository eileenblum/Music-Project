Seven years and counting into the future
All empires gone
Existence is obscure
Pirates rule the wasteland and there beyond
Lords of the underground and hope of the world
Come take my hand
I'll show you the way

Machine control is the object of mankind
A vision lost at the hands of time
Now silence rules the wasteland and there beyond
While the killing machine moves on
Come take my hand
I'll show you the way

[Chorus]
From Towers of Fire and mechanical rage
Take My Hand
We're lost in the machine cage
From rivers of black and deserts of ice
Take my hand
We're lost in the machine cage

Dark Mountains in the sky
From ashes we will rise
Into oblivion, into the unknown
Black towers scar the sky
We will forever fight
We're dreamers from another land
Victims of the master plan

[Chorus]
