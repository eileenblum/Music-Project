I can't turn back the hands of time
Can't change the past or bring back a life
I'll stay inside if you talk with me
About the places I've left behind
Tonight I'm going back to remember
And walk these streets of my yesterdays
Tonight I'm going back to the feeling
Life goes on and we are what we are

[Bridge]
Tell me now, do you feel the same
Have you found an answer deep inside your soul
Tell me now, can you take me back where I belong
Back to my yesterdays

Well I'm here for the day and closer to the chase
But I know when tomorrow comes
I'll be right back in the same place
And I've come so far, to turn back now
Would mean the end of everything I fought for

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Living for yesterday, hope there is another way
Tell me now, do you feel the same
Tonight I'm going back for the last time
Tell me now, can you take me back where I belong
Back to my yesterdays

We all were left behind
Passed by changing times
I still feel it's coming back someday
We are the last to fight
For what once was and still could be
Can you take us back?

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
