Lay still and don't make a sound
And pray to God that you won't be found
Don't close your eyes, it could be the end
We've lost sight of what we defend

[Bridge]
If it's all the same, are we gonna learn someday
If it's all the same, take me now

Rain falls on the battered ground, blood red from the bodies down

[Bridge]

Bullets fly and bodies fall, but can you find the courage
To face another day, just knowing that we never will be forgotten

[Chorus]
Remember me - And cherish the life that we all fought to defend
Remember me - And tell me that we never will be forgotten
Remember me - And cherish the life that we all died for
Remember me - And tell me that we will never be forgotten

Fire rains and cities burn and I've fallen by the dead
To say a prayer for those who care but left me here instead

[Chorus]

Under darkness they will come, believing in their cause
The chosen ones, our only sons, left dying on the shores

[Chorus]
