I know that shadows give you comfort in the dark.
Tears that rain down rip my inner strength apart.
I will not break my back to substitute myself again.
For the shadow that drapes over your self awareness.

No Longer will I set the highest standard.
Into mountains of sulphur I descend.
Day after day after night
I expect nothing to see, nothing to become
But a stranger in misery disguised.

Within these borders your quest is ignored
Your work recreated, and your story untold
As I was from heaven send...
Will I not see my stronghold mend?
Into sulphur I descend

Our Reflections will never be seen together
The gates to your being...closed forever

When did our development die?
When did our search for progress end?
It all vanished with a cry
Time I shall never betray!

Will I not see my stronghold mend?
Into sulphur I descend
