Retreat to your cramped damp shelter
To separate the shadow from your soul
Seeking refuge from the hell you lent her
Where conscience died to lose control

You may try to bury me
Underneath you stack of lies
But through impatience you missed to see
I will surpass your pathetic cries

Will I invoke the burden you bare?
To lower slit wrists into rivers of regret
Chaos Banished

Your foul manner reaches above and beyond my realm
Day after day... your presence fills me with hatred
So sickened by the sight of inhuman filth
And it was decreed that all must be exterminated
