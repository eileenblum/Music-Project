I am able to withstand
I am able to withdraw
I can break your world apart
By turning your lies into pain

There is a clear social chaos,
Always present in your eyes.
Constantly trying to evolve
Incapable of submitting

Boundaries-enforced beyond the margin
A Sacrifice made
Disturbance in my perception
I was created in distress

As life withers away below my feet
And rain pours down as oil
Suffocating my body with greed
My skin burning into soil

A prisoner of my own perspective
Captured despite my will to change
I Witness the clouds divide
The air turns cold
Your futile world subsides...
