Your touch is dead
As is the life I pursue
Onward I stare into the surreal
My mind dies
As slumber comes for me to heal

By binding light I strive to obtain
The pendulum sharpens its axe once again
To fore fill my needs
To embrace my silence is gold
Means the loss of motion control

Within me hides a dead soul
A world of mirrors breaking
I gasp for air no more
As I unleash my impulse

My mind clouds
I don't think their was anything there before
Permanently unconscious
(To turn the abducting faces forevermore)
