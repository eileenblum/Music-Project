Taste the despair coming from my hands,
The insanity flowing through my veins
Strength unknown has taken control
A challenge lost forlorn

My sight has been blocked
Although it cannot keep me down
Stolen from vision, detached from tears
I guest for sanity, constant after all these years...
End of sight, end of fears!

Strength unknown
Has taken control

This weight I cannot bear
Hands trembling aside
Capture my vision, and take my fears
An era coming to an end
Motives I do not comprehend
Oblige me to collide!

Incomplete is my reality.
Savaged within my insanity.
As I gaze upon my world
I start cleaning my hands
From the blood I have spilled
From the mistakes I have made

My time will soon pass
I lost the will to resist
Taken from vision, relieved from tears
I guest for sanity, constant after all these years...
End of sight, end of fears!

Strength unknown
Has taken control
