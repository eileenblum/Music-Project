Let me dream of a fearless world
A life without pain
Let me dream of a desolate place
Where I can taste the falling rain
A search through isolation
Neglecting doors that are opened wide

Nothing, nothing to gain!
Further away from Utopia
Gone, the portals are gone!
Save for the ones to Uphobia

Valour departs from the inside,
Despite its' futile destiny
Daylight falls upon my sight
Confiscating paths that used to be

A fragile wall which separates
My reason from insanity...

Decisions have to be made
Changes are set to occur
