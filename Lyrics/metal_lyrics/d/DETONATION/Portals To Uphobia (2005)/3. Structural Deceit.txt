As I search for energy to feed my resistance
Paths are blocked to decrease my persistence
There's something else that I need
A wound that cannot bleed
A room with innumerable doors
Energy from an endless source

This is my creation
Here is no custody
Where chaos and order
Are replaced by lunacy

Ignore my voice
While you're hunting me down,
For I cannot be forced
And I cannot be saved

From my own deception
Towards structural deceit

I am the God of my own creation
I am the deceiver of human perception
I will secure the ground on which I stand
As it was foretold, deception is at hand

Energy to feed
I am not the enemy
Structural Deceit
We shall stand!

There's something else that I need
A wound that cannot bleed
A room with innumerable doors
Energy from an endless source
