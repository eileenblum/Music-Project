Despair! With every attempt you make
It grows back, twice the strength.

Despair... an arrow, shot through the soul
Challenging thoughts, whether to bleed, or to restore itself.

With every attempt you make
It grows back, twice the strength.

Despair, expanding itself beyond belief
Divided minds collide with senseless grief.

Divided into different states of despair
Reclaiming what belongs to be
Though light shall be taken away
among the ones that strive to see.

Despair, expanding itself beyond belief
Divided minds collide with senseless grief.

Can I leave this place behind?
As once before... in terms of fear.

The collision of despair!
