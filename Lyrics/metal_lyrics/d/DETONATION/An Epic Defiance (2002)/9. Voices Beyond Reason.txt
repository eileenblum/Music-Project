Blinded by the withered thoughts of lust
I shatter a dream that left me no longing to trust.

What it is, is an ocean frozen in time
What it feels like are hours that are not mine.

When I tried I could not brake it
For the life I lived I could not take it
The dead man within me took over my realm
I walk into another life that feels like hell
For disease, the one that forged my blood,
the one that shaped my soul
Can you recall the summoning of angels.

Blinded by the withered thoughts of lust
I shatter a dream that left me no longing to trust.

Voices beyond reason
Gather around me every day.

As paradise crumbles into infinity
The rest of my life has left me to betray.

Blinded by the withered thoughts of lust
I shatter the dream that left me no longing to trust.

I wither away, to be left alone
For disease, the one that forged my blood
The one that shaped my soul
Can you recall the summoning of angels
like an ocean frozen in time...
