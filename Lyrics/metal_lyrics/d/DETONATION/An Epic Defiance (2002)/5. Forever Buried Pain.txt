Into a new state of presence
My body thrown away
Earth and flesh collide
As blood goes down and let wounds reborn,
never to be closed again.

Lost inside
Forever buried pain
Cast aside
Facing, bleeding, shame.

I dream of reaping through your soul
Slit your fucking throat while you're not aware
Submit your life, deserve the pain
Suffer the flames, they'll fade, they'll fade!

Into a new state of presence
My body thrown away
Earth and flesh collide
As blood goes down and let wounds reborn,
never to be closed again.

Lost Inside
Forever buried pain
Cast aside
Facing my bleeding shame.
