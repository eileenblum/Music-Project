Crawling through spaces oh so vile
Screaming out suffocated air
A cave from which escape is divine
Where sanity is left behind.

Flames roaring through a clouded sea
Beyond the reach of light
Dissolving...
I am beyond a state of life.

Crawling through spaces oh so vile
through the corridors of time
this place from which escape is divine
will night and day entwine?

Fear not! For your soul I see
Fear not! For the demons you lost are with me.

Fear in your eyes, I see not!
As I recall the dismay in which you dwell
Knowing I'm cast away
Denying the spirit of a light that soon will fade.

Flames roaring through a clouded sea
Beyond the reach of light
Dissolving...
I am beyond a state of life
For many years, I've been waiting for this pain
Dissolving...
