Drawn into another night
Forced to submit to the presence of time
Take me out of this paranoia
A still betrayal feasting on the silence that I create

This is my life, were no one follows
Sight of a dead stare, cold, hollow.

Surpassing my fierce being
Drawn back my will to succeed.

Behold and beware!
The wrath of time
Which no one has noticed
And no one has seen before
Take me out of this paranoia
A still betrayal feasting on the silence that I create.

"Claimed to be a meaningless cause
Nothing takes more from a soul
But there is nothing more to lose
And nothing less I will give in"

Nothing lasts forever, my soul left to die alone
With a sickness that I have spawn
The dying of our world, a follower to sea.
