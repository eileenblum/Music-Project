I have foreseen the conspiracy of the next confrontation
Decapitated bodies, abandoned lives
But yet not all is what it seems
The prophecy unfolds.

Our time will come
The prophecy unfolds
Shapeless being, filled with lies
Your presence is creating blood-shaped skies.

Defeated on our own ground
As if filthy slime always darkened our lives
There's still no solution found
But to tolerate and await the prophecy.

"Pay for your share in this crime
You shall repent, when the first light regains its strength"

Be gone!
Do I deserve to be distracted?
Be gone!
I am not yet on my knees.

Behold my becoming
Leave with nothing, suffer from shame
Behold my becoming
Admit your failure and leave no stain.
