Averting the plague
I shall repent injustice
For whom may ever retake my place
I shall be forever.

Prodigies of valour I see
Forever an epic defiance.

Revenge on those who command
Witness a setting of a burnt land
Eternally doomed in frustration
Fire in the eyes of my creation.

The blood-drenched window I laugh at
Feeds off my decay, rot!
I spent my days looking at death
Dying to gather sanity, needing no sympathy.

Prodigies of valour I see
Forever an epic defiance.

A soul with never-ending pain
A shadow of a lifeless form banished from sight
Left alone to decay, torn apart
As blood turns black.

Eager to taste
Consume to survive
As night devours its prey.

Prodigies of valour I see
Forever an epic defiance.
