Modulation
Beyond a state of reckoning
As I welcome the unknown
My shallow world is crumbling
Saving my heart from dying

Too many boundaries
I have yet to overcome

Fighting for domination
I'm changing my view tonight
Starting the infliction
Leaving these wasted eyes behind

Creating distance with words
Decimating wisdom with lies
Feasting from my soul
My patience declines
And repulsion evolves

Too many boundaries
I have yet to overcome

Fighting for domination
I'm changing my view tonight
Starting the infliction
Leaving these wasted eyes behind

Into fields of deformity
Where thoughts form into one
Where logic seems beyond repair
The shadow that I have become

This pulsing urge I feel
Where to find my needs?
Observer of unbearable acts
Festering from the inside out

Within the borders of tolerance
We are being put to the test
The breakdown of our system
Only the dead are allowed to rest
