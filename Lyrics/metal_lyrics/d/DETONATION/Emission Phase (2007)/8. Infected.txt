In desolation we stand above all
The ignorant fools we have become
Into these depths we must fall
The downfall has just begun

[Lead: Romeijn]

Within my shelter I await
The wrath of the innocent dead
A promise has been made
Infected souls bound to be shred

The process gaining in strength
With every stone that fractures
We are joining the misery at its end
Breeding from the hatred it captures

Infected
Infected from head to heel
We've building our structures to last
Then why are we destined to perish?

[Lead: Romeijn]
[Lead: Ferguson]

The barriers are set and raised
Raised high towards the heavens
Do you know where to run and hide?
When our grounds turn to useless waste

Infected
Infected from head to heel
We've building our structures to last
Then why are we destined to perish?
