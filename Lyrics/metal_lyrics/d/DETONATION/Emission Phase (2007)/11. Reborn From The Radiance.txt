[Acoustic Leads: Ferguson]

Craving for consistency
Towards and beyond a deficiency
Poison to my fragile mind
In search for a critical silence
Healing these wounds from the past
Existence has lost its balance
A covenant written in violence
Life's spawn contaminated

[Lead: Romeijn]

As I try to neglect this demise
Old ways are no longer of use
Fall of a shallow disguise

All the promises we have been breaking
All the sickness we have been faking
In battle with frailty
My fragile walls shall withstand the trail of time

Reborn from the radiance
Life's spawn contaminated
A weak foundation of scars
Life's creation devastated

The pain arrives in chapters

[Lead: Romeijn]
[Lead: Ferguson]

Craving for consistency
Towards and beyond a deficiency
Poison to my fragile mind

Reborn from the radiance
Life's spawn contaminated
A weak foundation of scar
Life's creation devastated
