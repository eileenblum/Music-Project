Insanity has come
The strength unveiled
Its fury unleashed
From a place once concealed

I have failed to see
Failed to learn
Is this the end of my fall?
Or am I still falling?

I'm awake, but dreaming
I'm dead, yet breathing
I cannot face reality
I cannot avoid fatality

You can't deny my suffering
Just taste the aura of pain that is surrounding me
A rejection of light so easy to see
I'm trapped in a world of sodomy

I have failed to see
Failed to learn
Is this the end of my fall?
Or am I still falling?

Awake, but dreaming
I'm dead, yet breathing
I cannot face reality
I cannot avoid fatality

Awake, but dreaming
I'm dead, yet breathing
I cannot face reality
I cannot avoid fatality
