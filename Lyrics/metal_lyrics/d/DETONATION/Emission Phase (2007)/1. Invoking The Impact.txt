Reveries of a futile world
Approaching my deepest fears
Prophecies that ghostly unfold
The blindness of 61 years

This is the ending of all
This is the day we shall fall
From the depths of our souls we must crawl

Ever since the birth of Trinity (July 16, 1945)
We are marching towards our banishment
In contempt with our own divinity
Will I ever comprehend?

In this day and age we wander
Awaiting the things to come
Through these times of slumber
Have we already foreseen it all?

This is the ending of all
This is the day we shall fall
From the depths of our souls we must crawl

Too many questions that haunt me
The answers are hard to find
Structural torment without an end
Revelation to the blind

[Lead: Romeijn]

'From the edge of Distress
We will never surpass
Innovation belongs to the past'

This is the ending of all
This is the day we shall fall
From the depths of our souls we must crawl

Ever since the birth of Trinity
We are marching towards our banishment
In contempt with our own divinity
Will I ever comprehend?
