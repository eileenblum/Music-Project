[Lead: Romeijn]

When curtains fall
Moments surpass in time
Invocation of our greatest fear
Accepting this great decline

I've questioned it all a million times
Through the simplicity that aspects combine

[Lead: Romeijn]

Drained towards oblivion
The fading of clouds amidst a burning sun

Entering the emission phase
The spirits that once formed us
Their guidance now lost

I'm trying to find those delicate words
Yet I'm craving into hopelessness
The spirits that once formed us
Their guidance now lost
As the discharge pours down upon us

I've questioned it all a million times
Through the simplicity that aspects combine
You embrace your decay as if it was mine
Awaiting the emission as the flash goes by
Changing my awareness, my perception of time

[Lead: Romeijn]

Entering the emission phase
The spirits that once formed us
Their guidance now lost
