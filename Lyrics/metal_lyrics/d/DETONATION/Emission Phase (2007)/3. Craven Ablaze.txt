Virtue has been drawn away
Your shadow set ablaze
Your destiny to follow through
Who will lead you through this maze?

Craven, through the ages
Craven, as we bury ourselves in shame

I am the deaf king in the land of the blind
My sight decays with every day that passed by
I am the one who knew though I never spoke
Lightning spells out my name, its disgrace I invoke

Craven, through the ages
Craven, as we bury ourselves in shame

Fighting to be heard
Thoughts beyond your self-control
Guiding me towards your shadow
Free me from your seductive soul

[Lead: Ferguson]

Down the chosen way
Where streets are paved with gold
Summoning the presence of light
I stand alone as this disaster unfolds

[Lead: Romeijn]

Craven, through the ages
Craven, as we bury ourselves in shame

Fighting to be heard
Thoughts beyond your self-control
Guiding me towards your shadow
Free me from your seductive soul
