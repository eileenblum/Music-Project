Hidden beneath the surface
Colliding with think lower clouds
Where layers are formed
Along the dark serrated floors

When the candle lights fade
Options are instantly decimated
All solutions are erased
And by now, your lungs deadly carbonated

Chokedamp
In silence you gain admiration
Extinguisher of light
Origin of damnation

Light killing blackdamp
Combustible sources that feed from the fires

Pathways are blocked
Your senses gone numb
Primal instincts now activated
All systems are in shock
And by now, hope to prevail has been decimated

Chokedamp
In silence you gain admiration
Extinguisher of light
Origin of damnation

[Lead: Ferguson]

Physical unstableness
Our minds assaulted with chemicals
Heads lost in the dark
There will be no place left o hide
Light killing blackdamp

[Lead: Romeijn]
[2nd Lead: Romeijn]

Chokedamp
In silence you gain admiration
Extinguisher of light
Origin of damnation
