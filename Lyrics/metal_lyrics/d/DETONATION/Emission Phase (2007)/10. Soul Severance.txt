Dust replacing my darkened blood
Ready to take this turning point
I cannot stop the being I'm destined to become
Growing in need for my soul to depart

This is barely an option
This is no way to be
Exploringã»

Witness the vile frustration
Emerging from my soul
Taste it and follow me down
Down into oblivion

This is barely an option
This is no way to be
Exploring the paths of friction
Denying the options I see

[Lead: Romeijn]
[Lead: Ferguson]

Inferior as I grow to be
Relieving myself of thoughts
No need for guidance
A condition I have learned to see

Separation from my soul
Detachment of my fears
At one with my darkness
The meltdown of all control

This is barely an option
This is no way to be
Exploring the paths of friction
Denying the options I see
