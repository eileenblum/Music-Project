A growing mass developing
Useless bodies vanishing
Dark side perception
Dynamic pressure forcing ground
Sickness spread in full contempt
Faster than the waves of sound
Fire rages with flair
Visible splendour exposed
Erasing that on which we depend

When stone turns to ash
Our minds divorced from flesh

Learn from these tears
Rise from the fire and leave your world ablaze
Never stand down, never submit
Time is now to rise!

Now is when we show our pride
Now is when we stand and fight
Now is when we pay the price
Now is when we chose to die

My sight has been ruined by the blast
Extermination of innumerable lives
Towards salvation's end I falter
The frail ends of misery surpassed

Next phase approaching
The essence of pain revealed
Its heart filled with blasphemy
Its trail saturated with violence

[Lead: Romeijn]

When stone turns to ash
Our minds divorced from flesh
