Condemned on Death Row
Staring at the walls.
Counting down the hours
They throw the switch at dawn.
No stay of execution.
No governor's reprieve.
No appeals or dirty deals.
No chance they'll set me free.

[Chorus:]
I am a monster / I am your disease
My wicked game inflicting pain
Brings you to your knees
No one can stop me
You don't stand a chance
I CANNOT DIE. MY WILL DEFIES.
KILL ME. KILL ME IF YOU CAN.

"Hear my last confession."
The Priest stares at the floor.
"Father,yes, I have sinned.
Since the day that I was born.
Look deep into my eyes
Tell me what you see.
No remorse. A Demon Seed
The Perfect Kill Machine."

[Chorus:]
I am a monster / I am your disease
My wicked game inflicting pain
Brings you to your knees
No one can stop me
You don't stand a chance
I CANNOT DIE. MY WILL DEFIES.
KILL ME. KILL ME IF YOU CAN.

My evil is eternal.
And all I've got is....time.

In chains I walk the mile.
They strap me to the chair.
Before I don the hood of black
I give them all a scare.
"Think you've seen the last of me?
Be warned and beware."
"On the day your numbers up,
You'll find me waiting there."

[Chorus:]
I am a monster / I am your disease
My wicked game inflicting pain
Brings you to your knees
No one can stop me
You don't stand a chance
I CANNOT DIE. MY WILL DEFIES.
KILL ME. KILL ME IF YOU CAN.
