Free the bonds of conformity
From The Land of the Blind
Can you read between the lines of lies

Can you feel it slipping away?
Will we waken too late?
From the darkness destiny awaits

Chorus
I am the Moth drawn to the flame
Into a fiery grave
Jaded truths that I never learned
Lost &amp; Fated to Burn.

As Atropos holds the fate of man
There's no escaping her hand
Never a master - a hopeless slave
I am....oh....

Chorus
I am the Moth drawn to the flame
Into a fiery grave
Jaded truths that I never learned
Lost &amp; Fated to Burn.

We are black in the night
We are death in disguise
We are blood and the knife
We are Judas revived
Oh, tell me why
I'm Fated to Burn
Fated to Burn
Fated to Burn

I am the Moth drawn to the flame
Into a fiery grave
Jaded truths that I never learned
Lost &amp; Fated to Burn

We are the Moths drawn to the flame
Not too late to be saved?
On a road of no return
We are all Fated to Burn....
