Ever since the cold war It's reared it's ugly head
Behind a veil of secrecy , It's hunger must be fed
Gross abuse of power, Freedom in it's wake
Civil rights stripped away, hunted by the snake?
ã
Integrated entity on a global scale
Codename : ECHELON; The coffin's final nail
Shadows all around you, nothing's as it seems
Slaves to a totalitarian machine.

Control the airwaves, make us believe
They guard the gates against our enemies
We cannot stop what can't be seen
THE EYES OF THE MACHINE
ã
Transmission intercepted. Converge at Station 9
R-FID &amp; satellites â No place left to hide
Spies, lies, alibis â Where did it all go wrong ?
Supercomputer chess and we are the pawns.
ã
Control the masses / No one is free
Bow Down at your master's feet.
A New World Order / Optic feeds
THE EYES OF THE MACHINE
ã
World Domination
Who's behind the scenes?
Subversion repressed, they
Build their Iron Dream.
Super-class Plutocracy,
Directive 51.
The Final Coup d'etat,
The Fourth Reich has begun
ã
Control the masses / No one is free
Bow Down at your master's feet.
A New World Order / Optic feeds
THE EYES OF THE MACHINE

We are the masses / Can we be free?
Or will we drown in oppression's sea?
A New World Order â This cannot be
BLIND THE EYES OF THE MACHINE
BLIND THE EYES OF THE MACHINE
BLIND THE EYESâ¦.
