Please Step Inside; Iâll Be Your Terror Guide
The Coverâs Free My Friend But Youâll Pay in the End

Now Exhibit A Is âEvil Freaks at Playâ
Watch as They Laugh And Slice Themselves In Half

And Now You Will Believe / But You Can Never Leave
For You Have Been Received
And Now Your End is Near; Itâs Everything You Hear.
A Festival of Fear

And Down the Path Not Far Youâll Find âThe Chambre Noireâ
Enter at Your Risk And Meet the Hexorcist

Let Me Introduce A Skeletal Recluse
Skinless As Thou; He Lunges At You Now

And Now You Will Abide; But Timeâs Not On Your Side
To Brave This Morbid Ride
What Have You Done My Dear? Youâve Locked Yourself in Here!
A Festival of Fear

And Now to Close the Show The Hooded Czar of Throe
He Speaks in Tongues And Breathes With Darkened Lungs

And Now You Will Believe But You Can Never Leave
Itâs You We Will Deceive
What Have You Done My Dear? Youâve Locked Yourself in Here!
A Festival of Fear
