[I Shadows Of The Abyss]

Consider a Parallel Fate Unobscured
Where Fiction and Fact Come Unglued
A Place Where Atrocities Thrive Unrestrained
Where You Don't Want your Dreams to Come True

I Navigate the Nexus The Key to Far &amp; Wide
Amid a Black &amp; Starless Sky I Search for Evil's Guise.
I Become what Strikes your Fear. Your Deepest Darkest Foes
Phantoms of the Underworld - Their Powers I Invoke

[II The Summoning]

I take what you can't find -Architect of Dreams
Thief by Night. Second Sight. Nothing's what it Seems
You will fall Victim to Slumbers' Soft Embrace
Terrified. Fear Defined. Nightmare Interface
Seventh Son. Hired gun. Telepathic Breed
We Converge then Traverse, Beyond Reality
In your mind. The Perfect Crime. Secrets are Revealed.
You've been Burned but can't Discern - What's Fiction or what's Real?

Go to sleep. If you dare.
Welcome to my Dream Lair.
I am all that you fear.
Every evil finds you here.
Trapped inside a private hell
My designs they serve me well
I'm the Master of your Dreams
I am The Nightmare King

Corporations, Countless Nations. Clients on the Rise.
Target synched. Neuro-linked. Eyes upon the prize.
Live or Die... I decide. Let the games begin.
No escape. Dreams I shape. Subterfuge within.

Go to sleep. If you dare.
Welcome to my Dream Lair.
I am all that you fear.
Every evil finds you here.
Trapped inside a private hell
My designs they serve me well
I'm the Master of your Dreams
I am The Nightmare King

[III The Construct]

I am The Nightmare King. Master of Dreams.

Upon a Throne of Black I Reign
The Altered States - My Domain
Riding on an Astral Plane
A Dream within a Dream I make
Within you Lies the Truth I Seek
Pray The Lord your Soul to Keep
On this Night before you Wake
A Dream within a Dream I Take

I Take what you can't Find - Architect of Dreams
Thief by Night. Second Sight. Nothing's as it Seems
You know where to find me - Where Terror stalks it's Prey.
Where Gloom, Doom &amp; Horror roam and Darkness Blacks the Day.

[IV Eternus Nocturne: The Dark Domain]

Nightmare King. Nightmare King.

Go to sleep. If you dare.
Welcome to my Dream Lair.
I am all that you fear.
Every evil finds you here.
Trapped inside a private hell
My designs they serve me well
Will this terror ever end?
In this place there's just one friend...

I'm the Master of your Dreams
I am The Nightmare King
I'm the Master of your Dreams
I am The Nightmare King
Nightmare King. Nightmare King.
Nightmare King. Nightmare King.
