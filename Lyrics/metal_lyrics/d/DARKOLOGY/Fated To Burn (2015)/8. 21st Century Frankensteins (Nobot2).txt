Their Past was a Nightmare. Their Future Untold.
Programmed by Man now they've Taken Control.
Victims of Progress. Technology's Toll.
Retribution for the Seeds that We've Sewn.

[Chorus]
Legions of Death Machines Seek and Destroy Mankind
Sinister Twenty First Century Frankensteins

Resistance. Existence. Hope Wanes in their Wake.
Millions have Died for a Single Mistake.
By Whatever Means they Must be Expelled.
Kill or be Killed. We Live to Rebel

[Chorus]
Legions of Death Machines Seek and Destroy Mankind
Sinister Twenty First Century Frankensteins

We Live Our Days Trapped Like Rats, Hiding Underground
If We Dare To Show Our Face, Trackers Hunt Us Down
Searing Eyes of Infrared. Death is on the Wind.
Improvise and Overcome. We will win.

Willing to Die for our Final Campaign.
Vengeance For Those Who Are Dead or Enslaved
Let this be the Night that their Reign of Blood Falls.
Death to the Nobots! Death to Them All!

[Chorus]
Legions of Death Machines Seek and Destroy Mankind
Sinister Twenty First Century Frankensteins
