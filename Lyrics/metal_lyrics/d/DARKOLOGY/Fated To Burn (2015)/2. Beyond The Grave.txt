The Madness began in 1692.
Evil's loose, Prepare The Hangman's Noose.
Misguided Child you Played The Vexing Game
At Salem, You will Hang! You will Hang!

I Stand alone, the Seeds of Venom sown.
A Shadows' throw from Beyond the Grave.

On this day in Salem, Ye hath been Accused.
Charged with Witchcraft What Say you Miss Good?
Do you Conspire with Spirits? Do you Obey their Will?
Confess or Thou swings on Gallows' Hill.

Tell me who's behind this Masquerade
The Fear, the Pain....and the Lies.
I Pray you Return from Whence you Came
I Bid thee Goodbye.

I Stand alone, the Seeds of Venom sown.
A Shadows' throw from Beyond the Grave.
Before I die my life goes flashing by
A distant cry from Beyond the Grave.

Travesty of Justice. Hanging Judge's Rage.
On The Good Book swear away your Fate.
In the Darkest Hours Truth was told in Vain.
You Can Hear Their Cries still today.

Tell me who's behind this Masquerade
The Fear, the Pain and the Lies.
I Pray you Return from Whence you Came
An Eye begets an Eye.

I Stand alone, a lost, tormented Soul
A Voice unknown from Beyond the Grave.
âTis not the end. The dead shall rise again.
So cries the wind from Beyond the Grave.

Beyond the Grave Beyond the Grave
Beyond the Grave Beyond the Grave
Beyond the Grave Beyond the Grave

I stand alone.
