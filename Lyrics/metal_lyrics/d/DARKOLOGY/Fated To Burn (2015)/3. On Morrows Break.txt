Three Hundred years I've hunted here.
One Hundred Thousand kills
My Primal Rage - A Lust for Blood
Holds reign upon my will

On Morrow's Break The Stars will fade
As Darkness comes Undone
I'll greet the rays of the Morning Sun
Through The Gates of Hell I Come

Too long I've played this deadly game
I still can see their eyes
How many more must sacrifice
That I alone survive?

On Morrow's Break The Stars will fade
As Darkness comes Undone
I'll greet the rays of the Morning Sun
Through The Gates of Hell I Come

Cursed by the Light. Slave to the Night
Trapped for all Eternity
There's just one way - I Seize the Day
Free me from this Misery

No sympathy. No Funeral Pyre
When it is our Time to Die
Tormented Soul befriends the Fire.
No One cries for The Vampire

On Morrow's Break The Stars will Fade
As Darkness comes Undone
I'll greet the rays of the Morning Sun
Through The Gates of Hell I Come

On Morrow's Break The Stars will Fade
As Darkness comes Undone
I'll greet the rays of the Morning Sun.
One hundred thousand One.
