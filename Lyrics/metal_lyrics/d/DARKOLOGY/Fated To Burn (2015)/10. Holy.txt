Slithering through the sands of time
Behind, a golden tale
From the pages of a book, I shape the Hammers and the Nails
History has shown, my mark on every throne
Amidst the blood and bone

Iâm your savior, Iâm the one.
In the dark I hold the sun,
Before your birth you wear my stain
I am HOLY,
You know my name

I was born to elevate, man above the world
Keep him separate from the beasts, from the strange and the unheard
Fear and hate my soil. Ignorance my coil
I bring you shame and toil

Iâm your savior, Iâm the one.
In the dark I hold the sun,
Before your birth you wear my stain
I am HOLY,
You know my name

Confounded by their emptiness they fill their hearts with lies
Twisted by their righteousness, their wrongs become their rights
Forever living in the dark they pray the end is bright
For the promise of eternity they throw away their lives

Though youâll never see my face, youâll never be alone
Iâm watching all you do, carving it into a stone
Forgiveness mine to sell, from the garden where they fell
Is it Heaven - Is it Hell ? Yeah !

Iâm your savior, Iâm the one.
In the dark I hold the sun,
Before your birth you wear my stain
I am HOLY,
You know my name.
