Behind the Churchyard There Is a Secret Square
Unspeakable to Those Who Dare to Enter There
A Silent Portal For All Who Will Transcend
To Beckoned Eyes A Dark Surprise Awaits You Now My Friend

And Then Weâll Ride Together
We Will Abide Together
We Will Reside Together
In the Shadows of Oth / In the Shadows of Oth

A Fright of Passage This Is No Fantasy
Your Deepest Fears Will Now Become Reality
For All Who Know It; Their World Is Argus-Eyed
The Nth Degree Of Sanity So Follow Me Inside

And Then Weâll Ride Together
We Will Confide Together
We Will Reside Together
In the Shadows of Oth / In the Shadows of Oth

Look Up Ahead in the Dark; What Do You See? I Think Itâs a Ghost of My Past
Iâm Trapped In My Mind; Seeing My Kind; Never Behind the Form That Was Cast
Look Up Ahead In My Path; Itâs My Own Wrath And It Is Laughing At Me
Iâm Caught In A Bind; Paranoid Kind; Megalomind; What Will My End Be?

Mountains of Sorrow Heal My Weary Mind
Child of Tomorrow Feel What We Left Behind

Look Up Ahead in the Dark; What Do You See? I Think Itâs The Wraith of My Dream
Iâm Trapped In My Mind; Seeing My Kind; Never Behind This Obscurity

Mountains of Sorrow Heal My Weary Soul
Child of Tomorrow Feels That Heâs Losing Control

Uncertain Webbings Will Tangle You And I
You Need Not Worry; I Know Several Whoâve Survived
A Realm of Trepidation; But This One We Must See
No Tragic Tale Will Thus Prevail; Just a Craniotomy

And Then Weâll Ride Together
We Will Abide Together
We Will Reside Together
In the Shadows of Oth / In the Shadows of Oth
