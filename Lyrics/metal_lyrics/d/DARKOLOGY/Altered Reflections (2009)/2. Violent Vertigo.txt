Deep into the arc of Hydrus
Entering the var domain
In the name of all before me
I must save all who remain

Permeating all dark matter
Breaking barriers of speed
A sea of stars is my dominion
In the midst my enemy

[Chorus:]
Calling I'm falling
I'm cast upon a dream
Firing expiring
I hear the silence scream

Acting reacting
My system overload
Chasing erasing
This violent vertigo

Rising from the blinding darkness
Thrust in two worlds beyond
Hour of attack approaching
Imminent, our reason strong

Shields engaged, a line of terror
Spinning into realm unknown
Laughing as I alter my course
Once again to meet my foe

[Chorus:]
Calling I'm falling
I'm cast upon a dream
Firing expiring
I hear the silence scream

Acting reacting
My system overload
Chasing erasing
This violent vertigo

Look into my savage eyes
As I play this game of fate
At one with my machine am I
And fueled by fear and hate

Weapons all around me now
But the one I can't forgot
Is the weapon in my mind you see
The weapon in  my soul

[Solo]

As I return to Hydrus 7
Yet another mission's end
A fleeting force, collision course
But sovereignty I must defend

As I await impending missions
Guardian to progeny
Astral plane is my dominion
In the midst my enemy

[Chorus:]
Calling I'm falling
I'm cast upon a dream
Firing expiring
I hear the silence scream

Acting reacting
My target detonate
My breathing and wreathing
Machine disintegrates
