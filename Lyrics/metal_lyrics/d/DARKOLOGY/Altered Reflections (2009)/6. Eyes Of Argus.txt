Subject unstable
In room 23
One hundred eyes will liquidize
Into a spiral sea

Silent remission
Bipolar clone
A black abyss, a mind amiss
A soul that you've outgrown

Hydrating visions
Into your head
One molecule inside a pool
A tear you dare to shed

Altered reflection
Casts a new light
You know not who inside of you
Mutating parasite

[Chorus:]
Into the eyes of Argus
Forever more
Every breath upon us
Opens the door

Inside your conscience
What do you see?
Delusion of illusion
A blind anomaly

Calming contentment
To straitjacket rage
A day to night, a black to white
A cretin to a sage

[Chorus:]
Into the eyes of Argus
Forever more
Every breath upon us
Opens the door

Dignified, justified, glorified

Nullified (dignified)
Vilified (justified)
Horrified (horrified)

[Solo]

Behind the window
Who do you see?
One hundred eyes will crystallize
Into a spiral sea

Silent division
Bipolar clone
A black abyss, a mind amiss
A skin that you've outgrown

[Chorus:]
Into the eyes of Argus
Forever more
Every breath upon us
Opens the door

Dignified, justified, glorified

Vilified (justified)
Mortified (horrified)
