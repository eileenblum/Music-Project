Phantom existence
Violent remains
Boundless resistance
Constant in change

Rate of expansion
Forces obscure
Dark energy

Imploded square waves
Weapons of rage
Limitless anger
White noise engaged

Voice of the ozone
String interplay
Dark energy

[Chorus:]
Black shift parallel
Lost in all we see
Trapped in darkened shell
Cosmic entity

Shattered frequency
Piercing your domain
Sonic overload
Amplitude insane

And as my hands
Reach out for you
Invisible, distorted view
A shifting form into the sea

I am the one
Dark energy

[Solo]

Numbers are crunching
Perplexing void
Erratic equation
Must be destroyed

Genius in question
Answers unfold
Dark energy

[Chorus:]
Black shift parallel
Lost in all we see
Trapped in a darkened shell
Cosmic entity

Shattered frequency
Piercing your domain
Sonic overload
Amplitude insane
