They ruled in forces of might
This ghost battalion by night
They had the aura
Had the aura of Xhad

They won with damaging game
Controlled a savage terrain
They had the aura
Had the aura of Xhad

[Chorus:]
Powers of Thiron
Terror strikes our path
Won't you save us
Save us from their wrath

Bringers of mercy
Spirits evil eyed
Make their presence
Village ours, they ride

With weapons of sinister course
They fought invisible force
They had the aura
Had the aura of Xhad

A devastating domain
Then off and not seen again
They had the aura
Had the aura of Xhad

[Chorus:]
Powers of Thiron
Terror strikes our path
Won't you save us
Save us from their wrath

Bringers of mercy
Spirits evil eyed
Make their presence
Village ours, they ride

They ride
We'll ride

In a sudden light, apparitions sight
Elionic rite, as one
Angered alchemy, to the ninth degree
Wizard of decree, undone

A magic sect will circumspect
And then detect an Achilles' heal
Pre-meditate, intrepid-ate
Retaliate, resistance is real

No one ever knew, mission overdue
Coming into view, as one
Dare to overthrow, weapons are below
Power they bestow, undone

The book of quell a truth will tell
Of ancient spell, existence denied
With dauntless force and no remorse
Uncharted course, your lifeblood deride

[Solo]

They ruled in forces of might
This ghost battalion by night
They had the aura
Had the aura of Xhad

[Chorus:]
Powers of Thiron
Terror strikes our path
Won't you save us
Save us from their wrath

Bringers of mercy
Spirits evil eyed
Make their presence
Village ours, they ride
