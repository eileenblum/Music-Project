No yesterdays, a lifeless haze
This reverie is all I see
I'm lost in time, you freed my mind
My sullen sting, your vanishing

[Chorus:]
Nowhere to go, all you bestow
On one dark day was swept away
Your peril eyes, now distant cries
A somber seed is what I bleed

I bleed

You introduced undying truth
Existence null, intangible
All that I find you left behind
The distance stares but you're not there

[Chorus:]
Nowhere to go, all you bestow
On one dark day was swept away
Your peril eyes, now distant cries
A somber seed is what I bleed

I bleed
I bleed

[Solo]

I crawl inside, my tortured pride
In silent rage must turn the page
Open the door, dimension four
Reality just a memory

[Chorus:]
Nowhere to go, ex nihilo
On this dark day, just swept away
Your paralyze, now distant cries
This dismal seed is what I bleed

I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
