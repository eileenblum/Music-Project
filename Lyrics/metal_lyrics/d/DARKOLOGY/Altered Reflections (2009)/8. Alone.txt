Possess your will

A shifting lie surreal
Appears from nowhere
Its presence that you feel alone

A shiver as you crawl
Through shadowed doorways
And halls of your cage one, alone

When illusion calls and its mortal claws
Clutching grip divides you
And the poison minds of your designs
Will think their way inside you

The creatures from your past
Return to haunt you
Your strength is fading fast, alone

This mandible within
Is manifesting
A soul ingesting one, alone

[Chorus:]
When the jaws of nihil possess your will
Their peril eyes deride you
And the poison minds of your designs
Will think their way inside you

One, alone
Your soul mutating zone
Two, of you
A splitting cell is two

One, alone
Your new intrinsic home
Two, of you
In monolithic view

[Solo]

This game of solitaire
It has consumed you
You're trapped inside its square alone

How will you overcome
That which infects you?
When it injects you one, alone

[Chorus:]
When the jaws of nihil possess your will
Their peril eyes deride you
And the poison minds of your designs
Will think their way inside you
