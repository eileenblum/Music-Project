You crawl into a box
Can't look it in the eye
The tigers of your trip
Are eating you alive

So break out of your shell
And live it like you feel
And start to get in touch
With all that's real

[Chorus:]
Revitalize
Humanize
Revitalize
Normalize

The world you see is one
Of vice and fantasy
Hallucinations of a place
You'd rather be

You feed the hand that bites
A hand that clutches skin
You've got to get out
Of the fix you're in

And every time you walk a line of truth
A mind to let your spirit free
You can't escape the reign of harsh reality

[Chorus:]
Revitalize
Neutralize
Revitalize
Mechanize

[Solo]

You crawl into your cave
Can't look it in the eye
The tigers of your trip
Are eating you alive

So break out of your shell
And live it like you feel
And start to get in touch
With all that's real

[Chorus:]
Revitalize
Improvise
Revitalize

Re-vital eyes
Human eyes
Re-vital eyes
Mechanize

Revitalize
