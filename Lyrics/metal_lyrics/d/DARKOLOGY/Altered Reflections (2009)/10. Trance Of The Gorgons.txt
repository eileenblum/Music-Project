Ends of earth, a fated birth
For all that legend's worth
Brazen claw, one fatal flaw
Athena's sordid thirst

Flesh to stone, a curse ingrown
Petrifying all that is your own
Sisters three: a trilogy
With a power yet unknown

[Chorus:]
Mistress of the feast
Beauty turned to beast
A maiden of the storm
Reflected eyes forewarn

Godly breed on evil steed with ill appointed need
A terrifying seed
Shackled stare and slithered hair
One mortal's neck his deed

[Chorus:]
Mistress of the feast
Beauty turned to beast
A maiden of the storm
Reflected eyes forewarn

Perseus of sky
We hear Medusa's cry
Upon her land you tread
It seems she's lost her head

(Polydectes laughed out loud to himself
Realizing Perseus' futile attempt to behead Medusa
However, Perseus, with the aid of the winged shoes
And crooked sword of mercury caught sight
Of the Gorgons' reflection in Athena's bright shield
Thus allowing him to complete this macabre yet mandatory decapitation)

[Solo]

Sinful choir, a dark desire
With jezebelian fire
And meet you must, your Perseus
With your very end on wire

[Chorus:]
Mistress of the feast
Beauty turned to beast
A maiden of the storm
Reflected eyes forewarn

Perseus of sky
We hear Medusa's cry
In life's vindictive act
The mirror stares back

Stares back, stares back
Stares back, stares back
