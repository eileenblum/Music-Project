[Chorus:]
I was so lost and so lonely
Was vainly searching for my sense
I needed to find my muse strongly
Notwithstanding the expense

Before I met you on my way
I was falling into decay

I knew you would
I knew you should
Change my life

Your smile, your eyes
Your voice, your guise
In my heart

[Chorus:]
You gave me power
To free myself, unlock the gate
I know
It is the hour
To be delivered from my fate
I'm free

I could not feel, no joy, no zeal
You gave me strength with might
And you changed me so I breathed free
I felt the mirth of life

I was locked in a tight cage
With no light and need for rage
It was you who set me free
And helped me now I can see!

Youâre the one stuck in my mind
The only thing I wished to find
I won't survive without you now
You are my air, my life, I swear!

You saved me reached out your hand
It was the best I could demand
Now I can feel that I'm alive
It's due to you owing to you

[Chorus:]
I feel that I'm so different when I'm with you
And i will be forever close to you
