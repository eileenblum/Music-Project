You feel the pain
How can I heal this broken heart?
The ruthless flame is what you feel
You fall apart!

[Chorus:]
I can save you
Please reach out your hand
You must leave your
Fears right where you stand

You got your life in your hands
I will tear them open
You will understand
Your fears are broken

Don't go away
Don't fight just stay
You will survive
You will survive

Don't go away
Stick to your way
You will survive
You will survive

You want to find a new tomorrow
Trying to drown your inner sorrow
Just make the move, canât wait no longer
Just make the move to make yourself stronger
I will release you from the pain

Donât refuse and donât you lose your last chance
