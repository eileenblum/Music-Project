[Chorus:]
Falling down it's the end it seems
Cruelly you destroyed my dreams
I'm struggling through difficult days
Get me rid of all my dismay

It's all over
Infinity and pain
It's all over
The very end of fame
I cannot trust now
A single soul
Behold!
Fate has played its role

I got no power
Getting on my knees
I got no power
Begging you, please
I'll turn to dust now
So make haste
My fate!
I canât stand your taste

Your deeds
Took my breath away
Your deeds
Led me to decay
The strife
Help me in this strife
My fate
I feel a lot of hate

[Chorus:]
I close my eyes,
And see the dream
Of better times for me
I'll leave the past
So plumb and fast
And I'll be happy again
