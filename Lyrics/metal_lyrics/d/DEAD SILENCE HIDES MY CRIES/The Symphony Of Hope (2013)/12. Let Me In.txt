Please clean my dismay
Take me away
Straight to heaven
To your site
I just went astray
Show me the way
Light the beacon
We'll unite

I want to be there
That place's free from lies
There are no words like care
And no one ever cries

Why did you leave me here?
I am now all alone
If I don't have you near
My heart will turn to stone

My pain is so severe
Can't wait to have you near
I'll join you in heaven
Sorrow will be outdone
