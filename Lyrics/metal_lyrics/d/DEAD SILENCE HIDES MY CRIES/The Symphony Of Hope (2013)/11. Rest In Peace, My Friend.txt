Good bye
Good bye, my friend
Know that i will
Always miss you

Good bye
Good bye, my friend
Know that i feel
Sad without you

My love to you is brighter than all sunbeams
I will not let you go from my heart, never!

Now!
Come to my dreams
Take me away
Come to my dreams
Come and stay

[Chorus:]
May your soul
Be blessed in eden
Rest in peace
You will not
Be forsaken
By your friend

I wish, I could find a friend like you, brother
I won't change you for anyone and anything
This damn separation! I can't take it!
I wish that you were here my old ally

Oh God, why did you make him die today?
Why of all roads was he lead to this way?
Bring him back to earth and let him stay there
He is truly worth it
His death was unfair

[Chorus:]
May your soul
Be blessed in eden
Rest in peace
You will not
Be forsaken
By your friend

[Chorus:]
I'll miss you my friend
My heart will not mend
