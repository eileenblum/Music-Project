I can no longer bear it

Hey!
Where is my freedom?
Will it come to me again?
Besides my old hope
I do not have anything

I miss my home, miss the things
That used to give me might all the time
I want to come back to my home
I will return to the haven of mine!

[Chorus:]
I run to you my beloved sight
I see the sun is shining bright
The saving light that helped me everyday
I'm close to you, I'm almost back
It is the day I cannot slack
Just one more dash and I'll be home again

I feel the fetters are taken away
I know, I'll come home forever to stay

I believe that I will take what is mine! All mine!

[Chorus:]
I run away (I am alive, I am alive)
No more dismay (feeling relief, feeling relief)
I reached my home (my home is my Eden)
I'm not alone (this is my best joy, this is my best joy)
