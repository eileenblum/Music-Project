You do it all the time
You bring pain, you bring crime
Itâs the way of exile
You never ever smile

[Chorus:]
Do you remember the pain? (Pain that you caused) Say!
You show repentance, get blame (You get the blame) Pray!

You think you are so fine
But you are worth a dime
Inside you are so vile
Your soul is full of bile

Waste the fucking disease filling your head
Make your last breath to change your way
Donât walk away, remorse is so nigh, accept it now, regret!

You take away
All their sacred hopes
You maim and slay
Enjoying their bawls

Deprived of grace
You drive them to suffer
Hiding your face
You leave them nothing
