Dreams coming true despite everything
Focus your mind on your craving
Dispel all your doubts and fears
Believe in yourself
The goal will be achieved

[Chorus:]
Your tomorrow is gonna come too fast
Leave your sorrow in the past
Hope will make your dreams come true
So be sure it's the clue

Don't you listen to anything
Except what your heart is saying
You are so close, gather your will
Your dream now looks, like it is real

Stand up fight for your fate
Until it is too late

The hundreds of roads and pathways
Brought you to these long-awaited days

You've reached your goal left all behind
Your restless soul is satisfied

[Chorus:]
Your tomorrow turned into today
You have done the whole long way
You have walked through ice and fire
You have paid for your desire
