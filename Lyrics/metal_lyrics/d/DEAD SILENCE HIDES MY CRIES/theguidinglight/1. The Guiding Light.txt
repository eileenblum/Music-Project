Who are these people and what do they want from me?
I can no longer trust them, disgust is what I feel
What seems to be a helping hand
Turned into the clutch of a hungry lion

Keeping the secrets tight under their chelsea smiles
They're taking all my might, behaving so damn vile
I was lost and destroyed. Oh world, please hear me!

Through the dark times of betrayal and lies
I will be your light and guide through this life
Please, give me your hand. I will always hold it
You can make it, my friend. Now you can't be defeated!

Through the dark times of betrayals and lies
I'll be your light and guide through this life
Give me your hand, and Iâll hold it
I'll be your friend, now you can't be defeated!

You search for answer to all of your questions
But listen to your heart!
And break the chains that are pulling you down

You must open your eyes and wake up!
We are heading to the skies, no time to stop!
In this fight for our dream I will battle for you
Even if itâs too hard, we will break on through!

I was lost and destroyed. Oh world, please hear me!

I'm no longer afraid of the secrets
Behind their chelsea smiles
I'm no longer afraid of the secrets
Behind their chelsea smiles

You are the answer to all of your questions
So listen to your heart!
And break the chains that are holding you down
You found the answers to all of your questions
And you've heard your heart!
Iâm by your side, I'm by your side

Through the dark times of betrayal and lies
I will be your light and guide through this life
Please, give me your hand. I will always hold it
You can make it, my friend. Now you can't be defeated!

Now you can't be defeated!
Now you can't be defeated!
