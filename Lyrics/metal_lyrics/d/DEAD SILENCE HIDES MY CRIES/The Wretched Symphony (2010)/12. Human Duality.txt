Do
We know the sense
Of our lives
Or how could it be found

[Chorus:]
We're enslaved by freedom
And we wage war for peace
Dreaming of far Eden
Staying on our knees

We try to find
The truth being stuck
In lies we have
Created

Betraying for cash
We start loving
All the things we
Have hated

[Chorus:]
We're enslaved by freedom
And we wage war for peace
Dreaming of far Eden
Staying on our knees

We are the only black demons of this world
We are the only white angels of this world

We make own graves
Make own lives

So reach out your hands
I'll show the way
Reach out your hands
I'll show right way

[Chorus:]
We're enslaved by freedom
And we wage war for peace
Dreaming of far Eden
Staying on our knees
