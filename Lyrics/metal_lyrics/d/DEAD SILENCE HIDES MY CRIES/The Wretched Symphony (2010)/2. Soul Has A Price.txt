God! Damn you all!
Kneel before you will die
Please! Close the door
To your greed and your soul

Where is now
Your sense of life?
You have no value
But you have a price

Where is now
Your sense of life?
Cost of your souls
Is reflects in your eyes

All have the price
In fucking life
In fucking life
I'm dead inside
Though I'm still alive
I'm still alive

Save
Me now
The hope
Is far
I search faith
I lost my chance
Return
My soul

Sold souls
Lost lives
