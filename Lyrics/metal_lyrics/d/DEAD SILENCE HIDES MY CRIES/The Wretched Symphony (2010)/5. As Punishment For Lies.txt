You lied too long
The doom begins
It's time to pay
For all your sins

Look at your grave
Say farewell
Now you can't stop
Fall into hell

Seeking the forgiveness
You will find your grave
And you will remember
Life you couldn't save

Damned by your god
You lost the fate
You search for hope
But is too late

Locked in hell's jail
You're doomed to hear
Screams of the souls
Which bring the fear

Seeking the forgiveness
You will find your grave
And you will remember
Life you couldn't save

Sickness embraced your mind
From it you try to hide
Prepare for hell!

Darkness embraced your eyes
Now you hear demon's cries
Prepare for hell!

You can't run away
You can't die to pay
Now begin the expiation
You can't erase all your deception

You run away from the truth which you're afraid of
