We survive demise
But It's time to rise
We'll stand on our feet
And we will defeat

This war has no end!
This war has no rest!

[Chorus:]
We realize
That we live
That we live
With hollow hopes
And everyday
It's getting hard
It's getting hard
We're broken

Tired of this deceit
Which we've heard lifelong
We want stop the pain
Which we've felt so long

No strength to resist!
No strength to escape!

[Chorus:]
We realize
That we live
That we live
With hollow hopes
And everyday
It's getting hard
It's getting hard
We're broken

We can't stand back now
And our fears can't break us down

We will be fighting
We will believe that
Tomorrow we'll rise
Tomorrow we'll win
This world is ours
And we won't stand still
We are not cowards
Tomorrow we'll win

Tomorrow we'll rise
Tomorrow we'll win
