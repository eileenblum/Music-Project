I curse the names
Craved for my death
It's time to stop your breath

I'm back for blood
Which I'll consume
You feel the taste of doom

My revenge. It's embraced my senses and mind
I promise. The torments of traitors will come

I've found your place
That place is a tomb
Your flesh will rot in gloom

The choice is clear
Your end is Near
I want to feel your fear

My revenge. It's embraced my senses and mind
I promise. The torments of traitors will come

Fall to your knees
Repent your sins
Feel the weakness
Soon you will cease your existence
