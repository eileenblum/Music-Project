We were so weak to stop this long war and
We were so numb to shout out these words

We aren't weak!
We make our lives!

[Chorus:]
We were closed in our fears.
Maze of fears.
(In our fears)

Now it's time to ruin these walls.
Strong walls
(Break these walls)

We all should break this
Weakness damnation
We have made our choice
It's our salvation

No one can ever force us
To lose our pride
No one can ever force us
To crumple inside

Now we can not lose this fight
Cause we are one
Now we can not lose this fight
It should be done

[Chorus:]
We were closed in our fears.
Maze of fears.
(In our fears)

Now it's time to ruin these walls.
Strong walls
(Break these walls)

Hold your truth in your hearts
And all fears will fade
