Your time has passed
It's your demise
Your life is flashed
Before your eyes

Through dimmest light
You try to see
Time of the past
You become free

What's pain inside?
That makes you weak
What memories
Have made you sick

Time will destroy
Chance to exist
Make your last breath
And don't resist

Time is ruthless
This is prison
In which we are
Locked forever

Time it rules us
Time it kills us
Now we can not lose this fight
Cause we are one
Now we can not lose this fight
It should be done

[Chorus:]
We were closed in our fears.
Maze of fears.
(In our fears)

Now it's time to ruin these walls.
Strong walls
(Break these walls)

Hold your truth in your hearts
And all fears will fade

Staying on our knees
