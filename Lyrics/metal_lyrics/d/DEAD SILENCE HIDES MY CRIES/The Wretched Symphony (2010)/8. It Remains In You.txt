Emptiness
Starts to fill
Your memories

And you don't
Remember of
Past miseries

You think it's over
Your fears is gone
You think it's over
But you are wrong

[Chorus:]
Do you believe that you cleaned up all you mind forever.
No!
Always be some things you can't forget.
Never never.

You can erase
The past from your
Black memory

But you can't
Erase your sins
So easily

You think it's over
Your fears is gone
You think it's over
But you are wrong

[Chorus:]
Do you believe that you cleaned up all you mind forever.
No!
Always be some things you can't forget.
Never never.

Throw
Your thoughts
Away
You must
Know
You can't
Hide from
Your past

It lives in
It lives in
In you
