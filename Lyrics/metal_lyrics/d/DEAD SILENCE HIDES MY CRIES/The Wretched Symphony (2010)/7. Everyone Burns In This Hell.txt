Waken up!
Hear the screams!
It's your soul
Slowly burns in hell
Faith is crushed
Blood is flushed
And your god is brutality

Everyone Burns In This Hell!
Pray!
Everyone Burns In This Hell!

You blame god
For your sins
We've become
The shame on this earth
Dark fills hearts
Hate fills minds
This is all vile reality

Peel your soul
From the sins and hate
Cry out words
Which will save your fate

Your god is taking your life
Your heart obscured by lies
Your mind was swept by dust
And now you're hating your past
