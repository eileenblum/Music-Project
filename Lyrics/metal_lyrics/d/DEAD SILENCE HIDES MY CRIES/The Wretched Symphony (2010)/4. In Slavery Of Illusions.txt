It's filling
Your veins and
Embracing
All your feelings
Mirage
Enslaving
Your reason
It is senseless

With no mercy
Like a cancer
It's destroying
All your senses

You think
That this life
Is perfect
But it's  falseness
Trying
To save you
Is hopeless
You are blinded

With no mercy
Like a cancer
It's destroying
All your senses

[Chorus:]
Being High is just an illusion
And it leads to confusion
It makes the rules you follow
Sense it gives is hollow

You can't waste your life on it
Don't waste yourself on it

Clear your mind
Change your life
