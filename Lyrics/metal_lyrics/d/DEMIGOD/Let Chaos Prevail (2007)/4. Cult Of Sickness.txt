Clear thinking, less words
Pure eye view, sterile mind
Dark visitor, fierce intruder
Born in fear, breed in disgust

Cause, produce - smaller cut
Cause, produce - bigger effect
Cause, produce - smaller cut
Cause, produce - perfect parasite

See all taken, see all end
This ceremony, slow, but certain
Speak it back, blood the stimulant
Orgiastic pain, cleanest burn

Cause, produce
Cause, produce
Perfect parasite

Framework for life
Survival through death
Scatter your filth
Through your cult of sickness

Clear thinking, less words
Pure eye view, sterile mind
Paralyzed vision, black language
Of unfeeling soul, sleepless reign

Cause, produce - smaller cut
Cause, produce - bigger effect
Cause, produce - smaller cut
Cause, produce - perfect parasite
