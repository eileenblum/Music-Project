Dead in my dark memory
When did I die?
Nearly lost grip for my life
I've opened my eyes

I feel regret for being struck
Since my sorry birth
I am done with the memory
Of this life I had

From the depths of self pity
I rise above everything
I'm now one with the liberty
To control my head

I drowned my boiling emotions
Feeding unconscious
I've reached the surface finally
Not knowing the outcome

Why crawl when life turns an option
From the deepest hatred
No rest from thoughts unspeakable
My treacherous dawn

From the depths of self pity
I rise above everything
I'm now one with the liberty
To control my head

My mind works intensively
Perspective narrows
I can focus on one thing
When dark turns black

I've found outlet for my soul
For what is inside
I hate everything and everyone
In my pride of rage

From the depths of self pity
I rise above everything
I'm now one with the liberty
To control my head

Tell me am I human anymore
Can I feel like this?
I will never turn my other side again
So you'd better turn yours
