Uncertain endurance
Who will stand last
Seeker of salvation
Seer of horrors

Defense mechanism
All seen before
Desperate answer
Foregone conclusion

The longer you resist
More rage it will have in return
The nature's trail
Cracks your humanity into pieces
The last witness
Of this fearsome act to come true
See, I am the hand that you raised against yourself

Unnamed king
On a disease's breaker
Threat prevention
Feeding the fire

Silent murderer
Surge of hysteria
Need is one to blame
Hell finally teaches

To see the last one die
To see the last one die
To see the last one die
To see the last one die

The longer you resist
More rage it will have in return
The nature's trail
Cracks your humanity into pieces
The last witness
Of this fearsome act to come true
See, I am the hand that you raised against yourself

The pain between birth and death
Comfort awaits unexpected fate
To see the last one die
