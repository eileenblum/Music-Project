What triggered this treachery
One way lane to extinction
Through my skin into ones mouth
To be spit back on my face

You blew the air in
You got my blood out
But to you I'm not dead
Still not dead enough

Powered by the machine
Getting empty from the inside
So virtual and unreal
No life should end like this

You blew the air in
You got my blood out
But to you I'm not dead
Still not dead enough

Someone waiting for a birth
I've wasted my life for it
The order that I scorn
The order I must die for

Heal me anyway you can
End my cold life functions
Feed me no more
No longer should I be

Not dead enough - you blew the air in
Not dead enough - you got my blood out
Not quite alive - but to you I'm not dead
Still not dead enough

Burn me over and over again
Being dead must be liberating
