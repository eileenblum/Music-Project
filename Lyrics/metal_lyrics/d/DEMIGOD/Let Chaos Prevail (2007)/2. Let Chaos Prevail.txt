There is no upward direction
See the timeworn hands
Inured to coldness
To act and die martyr

Murder for your precious misery
Wear the crown in front of the blind
Smell the dry blood on your hands
Enchain your greed, let the chaos prevail

Never knowing the moment
A need to be recognized
Ground of ignorance
Portrait of a lie
Thrown away from comfort
Distraught with grief
Insufficient sacrifice
Starter for the rage

Revalue the adoration
Shorten the frequency
Loosen the strangulation
Revalue the adoration
Shorten the frequency
Fill the hollow mind

Revalue the adoration
Shorten the frequency
Loosen the strangulation
Revalue the adoration
Shorten the frequency
Fill the hollow mind

Never knowing the moment
A need to be recognized
Ground of ignorance
Portrait of a lie
Thrown away from comfort
Distraught with grief
Insufficient sacrifice
Starter for the rage

Murder for your precious misery
Wear the crown in front of the blind
Smell the dry blood on your hands
Enchain your greed, let the chaos prevail
