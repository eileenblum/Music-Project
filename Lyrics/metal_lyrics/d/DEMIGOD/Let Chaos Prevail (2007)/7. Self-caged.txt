You can hear them speak
The remnants of your past
What joy can they bring
When all they want is to suppress

Those eyes lurking behind
The dust you breathe in
Thirst will never leave you
Needles stick in your throat

Those creatures at your door
They keep you awake
Constant stare you feel
The aim that you run for is lost

Those eyes lurking behind
The dust you breathe in
Thirst will never leave you
Needles stick in your throat

Walls of your home collapsing
Only safe place is now a trap

The beast is roaring louder
Stand-up tall for defense
Sad way to save it all
They're laughing at you
Laughing at you

Those eyes lurking behind
The dust you breathe in
Thirst will never leave you
Needles stick in your throat
