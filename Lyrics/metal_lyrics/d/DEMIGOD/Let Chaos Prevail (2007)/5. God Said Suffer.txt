Come to me my child
Love my god, but worship me
I am your despair
So fear the beast
Given in to my lust
Keep my secrets deep within
Take my god, take my beast
Come to dark

Monster
Hater
Killer of my dreams
Monster
Hater
Cloaked in light
His dark mind

Leave me be my child
I've confessed, forgiveness is mine
I am now so pure
I'm in the light
On your knees monster
Fear did surely die in me
Hate implicates death
Taste the steel

Monster
Hater
Killer of my dreams
Monster
Hater
Cloaked in light
His dark mind

Monster
Hater
Killer of my dreams
Monster
Hater
Cloaked in light
His dark mind

Unleash me in your sleep
See all dark through me
Wash away the hate with blood
