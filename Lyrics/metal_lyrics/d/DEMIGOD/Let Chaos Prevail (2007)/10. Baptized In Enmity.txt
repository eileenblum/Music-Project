I am blessed with an instrument of determination
Concession leads to forgiveness
My phobia's to see a heretic rise to power
Forgiveness means defeat

Baptized in enmity
Craftsmen of killing
Passion for order
Uncompromising will

With emptiness I suffocate your false ideals
For theory of balance you must end
Make your stand before your final occupier
I will not persevere

Baptized in enmity
Craftsmen of killing
Passion for order
Uncompromising will

Illiterate writer
All unwritten hate inside
Nameless leader
Thinker with a wrong mouth to speak

Blind seeker
Visions that were born before
Veiled future
Hidden behind the truth
...Your truth

Baptized in enmity
Craftsmen of killing
Passion for order
Uncompromising will

Baptized in enmity
Baptized in enmity
