Liquid ground, semen of death
Uncontrollable, rage of the earth
No sympathy, for a dying wish
The blade will cut, beginner's luck

Fragile lives, bloody feathers
No sky to fly, my land deprived
Severe justice, end of evolution
Closing time, end of evolution

Tired provider, expected outcome
No one heard, no one learned
No sympathy, for a dying wish
The blade will cut, beginner's luck

Fragile lives, bloody feathers
No sky to fly, my land deprived
Severe justice, end of evolution
Closing time, end of evolution

One step down in the food chain
Pride, the last thing you can swallow
Transparent, characteristic
Wake up to be late from your life

Liquid ground, semen of death
Uncontrollable, rage of the earth

Fragile lives, bloody feathers
No sky to fly, my land deprived
Severe justice, end of evolution
Closing time, end of evolution
For the unwanted

One step down in the food chain
Pride, the last thing you can swallow
Transparent, characteristic
Wake up to be late from your life

Lurk over the unknown
It is time for you to step aside
Recreation, correction
End of evolution
