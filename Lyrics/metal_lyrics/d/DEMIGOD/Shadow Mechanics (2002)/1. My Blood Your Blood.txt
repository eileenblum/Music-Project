[Lyrics by Laitinen / Kiiski]

Follow my way of thinking
True human way of life
Lay yourself on my seed
Depart from your kind

I am your father
I am your son
The start and the end
In time you'll see

Heal yourself from yourself
Act without emotion
I am the upward direction
Your insuperable fate

You thought life is a gift
Let truth speak for itself
The course for you is settled
You are now on my leash

Dreaming of this dominance
Ruined by your impotence
See the reverse side of life
Come and hide your excuses

You thought life is a gift
Let truth speak for itself
The course for you is settled
You are now on my leash

I am your father
I am your son
The start and the end
In time you'll see
