In between time
The sun has set forever
Tranquil, silent state
Worlds eldest wisdom

This place of all known fears
Minds unfound corner
Peace seeks its way to hold
Until they return

Suppressed...unreal
No sight no ground to walk
So down you reel... derailed
Deeper you will stray

Halos and flashing lights
Haunting endlessly
Scared and cornered
Driven to the limit

Parting of the consciousness
Delusions of mirages
Natural order of all things
Relentless reign

When they reveal in flesh
You'll see what you are made of
Call for light and find out
The truth'll push you down

The sand in your veins
Melt into fear
The flame in you dies
As you drown in blood

Suppressed...unreal
No sight no ground to walk
So down you reel... derailed
Deeper you will stray

Suppressed...unreal
No sight no ground to walk
So down you reel... derailed
Deeper you will stray
