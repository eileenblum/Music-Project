I remember her standing by the window
So innocent and beautiful
I remember her crying bitter tears
Trying to cope in her loneliness

I saw pain in her eyes
Heard her desperate silent cries
I couldn't stand there for you

I remember her listening every night
Whispering wind in the silent air
I remember her struggling against pain
Withering away by every single day

I saw pain in her eyes
Heard her desperate silent cries
I couldn't stand there for you

I remember her listening every night
Whispering wind in the silent air
I remember her crying bitter tears
Withering away by every single day
