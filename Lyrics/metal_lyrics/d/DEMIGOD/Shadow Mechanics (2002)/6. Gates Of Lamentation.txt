At the gates of still and cold domain
Where sinister clouds were filling up
the sphere they watched
There in nothingness nothing ever existed
Except the freezing wind that so many perished

Inside this lifeless
Cradle of damnation
Darkness below death
Your eyes shall be opened
Again

The dark beauty is now in shades
To break your world of tranquility
Echoes of nothingness
Burned sights will kill your faith in god

Your god has gone astray
You unfathered fool
Seal your fate
Forevermore... Lamentation

At the gates of still and cold domain
where sinister clouds were filling up
the sphere they watched
There in nothingness nothing ever existed
Except the freezing wind that so many perished
