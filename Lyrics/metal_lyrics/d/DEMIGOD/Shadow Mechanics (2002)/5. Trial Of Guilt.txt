Their quiet sighs
Will follow your trail
Their endless pain
Will haunt you in dreams

Silence the guilt
They made you feel
Deep in your heart
Deaf, dumb and blind

You can not feel the guilt and shame
You can not heal, they bleed cause of you
You can not feel the guilt and shame
You can not grow, they bleed cause of you

Their painful cries
Now twisting your truth
Your soul like ice
Standstill and cold

Their freezing touch
Now grasping your soul
Look at yourself
Deaf, dumb and blind

You can not feel the guilt and shame
You can not heal, they bleed cause of you
You can not feel the guilt and shame
You can not grow, they bleed cause of you

You can not feel
the guilt and shame

You can not heal
the guilt and shame
