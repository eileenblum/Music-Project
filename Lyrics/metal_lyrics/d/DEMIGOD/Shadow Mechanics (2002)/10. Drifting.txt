The fear of looking inside
The pain of my life
The memories are so real
The scars grow so deep

The pain of my life
The shame that I feel
Crying, all colours fade to grey
Drowning in tears I fade away
Away from the light

The pain of my life
The shame that I feel
Crying, all colours fade to grey
Drowning in tears I fade away

The essence of innerself
Horrors burn my eyes

So real... the pain inside
Falling... I'm drifting away

Falling... Drifting away
Away from the sun
Falling... Drifting away
Away from my heart
