no way out of this hell
solitude holds me through time
misery found a way to my heart
tears raining upon my path

memory of the time
I lie silent with earth
awakened to eternity

in search for my paradise
I am lost on my way
the path darkened by others
my earthly remains decay

memory of the time
I lie silent with earth
awakened to eternity

you gave me everything
you gave me this pain
you gave me this world
you made me insane
