I'm coming from the place unknown to me
Guess it's my insane personality
I need to find peace for my mind
For there where I was I only dealt with pain

The silent voice echoes in my head
Aware but I am frightened to dead
I know I am alone without protection
Oh, please save me from these burning illusions

The fire that burns inside my soul
The flame in disguise burns my sight
The fire confuses my weary mind
Is it my head that makes me suffer?

Burning illusions - Tear my being apart
Blinded eyes do see - Shattered identity

The silent voice echoes in my head
Aware but I am frightened to dead
I know I'm alone without protection
Oh, please save me from these burning illusions

The fire that burns inside my soul
The flame in disguise burns my sight
The fire confuses my weary mind
Is it my head that makes me suffer?
