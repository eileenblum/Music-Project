Seen by your eyes
I stare into the void
Hearing me move
I hear nothingness

Your breath on my neck
I'm gasping for air
Put down by the beast
I crawl in my own dirt

You set the fire on me
The fire that burns my fire

Walls around closing in
Cracking my vision
Fading my strength
I'm choking on your sweat

Somewhere below raging storms
In the moist dark unconscious
Together with another soul
Far apart but still the same

Replacing now my own soul
To obtain the strength to see again

Fiery soul cleansing
True mind erasing
Gods only method
And I'm facing it

Pain means healing
Objective lashing
Adaptable being
Must become deaf

You set the fire on me
The fire that burns my fire

Endless grinding
Called for bowing
Non stop feeding
All must be swallowed
One option remaining
No way of hiding
I can see...
you in the mirrors!
