Where the shadows clash
Upon my world
Where the world goes blind
Where nothing is real

Now I'm dying here
Under the falling down shadows
Starve my soul
Eternity craves for me

Grey this world of dawn
God made in my dream
I have gone blind
Praying to die... alone

Where the shadows clash
Upon my world
Where the world goes blind
Where nothing is real

I burn for the shadows
That have found me
I show excruciating pain
My blood is black as in my dreams
I moan, for betrayed I am
This is the throne where shadows clash

Where the only man
Will suppress his life
Son of god
Lost deep inside

Where the shadows clash
Upon my world
Where the world goes blind
Where nothing is real

I burn for the shadows
That have found me
I show excruciating pain
My blood is black as in my dreams
I moan, for betrayed I am
This is the throne where shadows clash
