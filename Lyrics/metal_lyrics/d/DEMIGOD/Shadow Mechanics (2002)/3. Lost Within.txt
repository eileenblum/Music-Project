Birth of new life
Hope of this world
Smothered since birth
Estranged of what is true

Elders their dreams are lies
Spoken behind my back
Piercing through my mind
I don't see what you see

Stagnant this view I see
Frozen deep within
Raving in lunacy
I am lost within

Strange man in me
Unleashed my hate
Stares back through hell
In darkness I dwell

Aimless path
To the end
Forever
Your words betray

Stagnant this view I see
Frozen deep within
Raving in lunacy
I am lost within

Crestfallen life
Your words betray
Crestfallen life
Lead me astray
