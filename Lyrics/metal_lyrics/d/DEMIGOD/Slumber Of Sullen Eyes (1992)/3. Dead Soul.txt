In darkness
Your soul is now free
Morbid illusion
Entombed in frozen ground

Divagate in obscurity
Obscene frost of eternity
Disgusting mortal existence
Cruelty of nocturnal paradise

I shall dwell
In eternal obscurity

Unholy adoration
Of suffocation
Mortify and despise
The mind of the chosen one

I'm the deadsoul of darkness
I shall crucify your bastard soul
