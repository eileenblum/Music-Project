Obscure mass of silenced souls
Drifting misery, frozen shapes
Numbed herd entranced with fear
Kingdom dead, silenced life

Depressions of the soul
Emotions from darkest mind

Darkness dwells in your fading spirit
Ominous silence of misery
As thee lay beneath
Fear obscures from within

Supremacy, pay homage to the grief
Mourning, the waves of dismay

Darkness dwells in your fading spirit
Ominous silence of misery
As thee lay beneath
Fear obscures from within

Agony and dismay
Unforeseen dimension unfolds

Depressions of the soul
Emotions from darkest mind
Supremacy, pay homage to the grief
Mourning, the waves of dismay
