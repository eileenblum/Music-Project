Obscuring mourning of blood
Powers of beyond oppress me
Death falls from dismal eternity
Slain souls shall scream forever

Bringing calm into my existence
I walk away from false belief

He who created my dreams
Shall now be forgotten
In my time of blasphemy

Thoughts of my darkened being
God has incurred in pain
I struggle though trials
I have chosen my path

I travel into uttermost shades
Creatures are now awaken
In flames they shall tell
Immortal are the hunters
