The wind that whispers within my sorrow
Has calmed my dreams and created depression
But I saw those tears that were pouring
Down from the once called paradise

Tears of god
Darken unholy domain

So cold is the touch of dismay
Bitterness shrouds me into eternity
Ceased as I am the damned soul
You forsook me left me succumb alone

Descending into paradise
Where all is forsaken
Towards the oblivion
Macabre damnation
Behold me I shall rule
All the shrouded eternity
The grief from below
My domain the everlasting

Tears of god
Macabre thy lord's kingdom
