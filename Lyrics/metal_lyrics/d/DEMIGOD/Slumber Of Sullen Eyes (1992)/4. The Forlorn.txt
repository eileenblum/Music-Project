Through horizons I am dreaming
I sense the mourning of skies
Desolate sands forming below me
Mortals are gathered for the passing

Smoke rises from the earthly past
I hear the dirge of morning dusk
I'm drifting into the beauty of darkness
The Forlorn

Black abyss of damnation
Feel the grief that is eternal
Solitude of darkest sorrow

No illumination
Misery holds me with an immense grip
I fall into the beauty of darkness
The forlorn

Powers shall remain
To Seize with pain

Eternity awaits me
Horrors of misery
But I never dreamt to be sane
The forlorn
