I shall befall thee
In the sullen halls of dark oblivion
In an eventide of abysmal grief
Hybrid form of life
Hidden from the immortal
Your soul will burn through time
The dark realm dwells in no light

Dismal dreams of lives forgotten
In the visions of my slumber
They lie silent in chasms
The bleeding eyes of sorrow

The gathering of miserable beings
Grievous existence underwent to the end

In blackness they mourn
The souls of sorrow now bleed in tears

I shall befall thee
In the sullen halls of dark oblivion
In an eventide of abysmal grief
Hybrid form of life
Hidden from the immortal
Your soul will burn through time
The dark realm dwells in no light

Dismal dreams of lives forgotten
In the visions of my slumber
They lie silent in chasms
The bleeding eyes of sorrow

Frozen eyes gazing to stillness
Beckoning into the dark
Summoned to the vale of tears
To feel the appearance of grief

Slumber of sullen eyes (repeat)
