Grip of dark eternity
Dwell in infinite misery
Through darkening I came
With agony I now reign

Thee, the suffering soul
Deceased dwell below
Thee, shall be despised
As I'll be thy lord
Thee, the perished
In the shadows beneath
Veiled are the dying souls from reality

Towards the shrouded infinity

The dawn of gods
Shall bring the truth
For the lifeless
In the shadows beneath

Thee, the suffering soul
Deceased dwell below
Thee, shall be despised
As I'll be thy lord
Thee, the perished
In the shadows beneath
Veiled are the dying souls from reality

Deification of blackened skies
Towards the shrouded infinity

Lifeless are their minds
In the embrace of death
In infinity awakened souls
Shall remain forlorn
The journey through eternities
Mists and blackened skies
I became the one
Beyond all mortal purity

Thee, the suffering soul
Deceased dwell below
Thee, shall be despised
As I'll be thy lord
Thee, the perished
In the shadows beneath
Veiled are the dying souls from reality

Lie in infinity
