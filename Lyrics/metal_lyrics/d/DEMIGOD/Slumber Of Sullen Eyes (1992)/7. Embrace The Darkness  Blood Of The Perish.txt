Consumed bodies to the depths
Awakened souls dwell all
Arising sinister dawn
Awake the eternal

The world of lost existence
Perpetual, obscure kingdom
Illusion of paradise is lost
Entering of the dead has begun

Mortals, perished
Blood has been shed
The lord, master of darkness
Desecrates the purity

Creator of coldness
Has calmed the path of life
As paradise covers
The tombs of mortality

Blood of the perished (repeat)

Incantations I have heard
This dismal grip, shall I be lost
Coldness takes me below
Now I'm one with darkness forever

Creator of coldness
Has calmed the path of life
As paradise covers
The tombs of mortality
