Surrender everything I've earned
For one last chance
I designed a way to secure the end
The blood will shed

Ignorance is blinding your judgment
Evolution erased and redesigned

I am  severing
All of your forgotten failures
Religion now must die
Sensations to eradicate

What are these worthless things that I take from you in vain

Design a better life and say you wouldn't kill it
Design a better death and say you wouldn't live it
Subdued and killed for
Deciding once again
That you'll destroy your self alone

The blood is wasted
I have the only thing you need
The blood has been shed
And then there nothing to love
Tearing yourself apart
The blood is wasted
Rip fucking walls apart
