I'm taking over now
This is the only way out
I'm scarred and broken from
Dealing prescriptions sold as
Temporary weapons of terminal mass destruction
Swallow the sleep deprived manufactured insomnia

We're taking over now
Sleep deprived hallucinations
Drink it down crushed or swallowed
Chewed up methamphetamines

Drugged and still trying
Taking this life for granted
Slurred sleep from popping pills
Manufactured insomnia

Sleep deprived hallucinations
This is the final solution

Breathe in get high
Get high
Absorbed
The day melts away
Breathe in
Get high
Two vics
I'm falling asleep as the day melts
Away into...

Slip away into another dimension
I'm comatose and I'm unresponsive
Fucked up beyond recognition
Swallowing my own insomnia

Breathe in
Get high
Two vics
I'm falling asleep as the day melts away
