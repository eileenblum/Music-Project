I'm Feeding the Virus that's released the poison
my addictions running out of control
This  idea  of a restrained inception
exposes your true ignorance

Spread the disease  and arrive at
the point that your trying to make
now  you  have spoken your last words
they will be your  final lie

I have a  thirst that's
burning in  my mouth
feeling overwhelmed  i need to get high
its hard  to  envision  sobriety
while I'm downing handfuls of  dissent

Spread the disease  and arrive at
the point that your trying to make
now  you  have spoken your last words
they will be your  final lie

further down the spiral we go
an indestructible overdose

spread the disease  and arrive
at this  goddamn  point your  trying to  make
spread the disease and arrive
now you have spoken your only last words
spread the disease and I'm craving
sickness  desensitized
substance abuse has arrived at an
indestructible overdose

you fucking open up the bottle
swallow those goddamn  pills
indestructible overdose
