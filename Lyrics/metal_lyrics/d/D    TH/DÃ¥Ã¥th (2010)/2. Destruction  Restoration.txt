I decide the way this has to end
fighting through my distracted doubt
create a method of execution
there's only one way out
manipulation
cancer of the mouth
exposing insecure and codependence
decide the answers based on your
forced suggestions

I have nothing left
self destruction restoration
injecting the poison in my veins

degrading silence slowly the toxic sludge devours
decaying violence sedation through the solitude

I destroyed my fucking insides
ripping out my collapsing veins
falling into a drugged deception
I'm slowly going insane

I have nothing left
self destruction restoration
injecting the poison in my veins
I have nothing left

manipulation cancer of the mouth
I'm insecure and codependent
decide the failures based on your fucking suggestions
