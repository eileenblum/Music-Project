Overcome the sickness
of there infected genocide
I'm stuck in this nightmare
we call life

the hailing gunfight
bullets ripping through the night
only in the violence can the cries be heard

rebuild another life
a mass human race
extinct before its born
without a trace

the hailing gunfight
bullets ripping through the night
only in the violence can the cries be heard
the war of demolition
cut the soldiers down
disappearing in the end is useless dying

it makes no fucking difference
far away from the distant dissection
ill take your time away
from this earth and sold back to you
repeating the misquotations
removing morals forcing out negation
