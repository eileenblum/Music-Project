You cant escape this sealed in fate
delete your past is not an option
watching the clock for the precise moment

their you are waiting
so just sit back
and exhale
for the very   last time

take the chance
and board the plane
headed into the
final  destination

plane crash into the fucking ocean
plane crash a lifeless emotion
plane crash a short sting and then you suffer
plane crash into the fucking ocean

nothing here to bind us
now you are left with an exit plan
there are no survivors
only god can save us now

plane crash into the fucking ocean
plane crash a lifeless emotion
plane crash a short sting and then you suffer
plane crash into the fucking ocean

there is no way to scream oxygen deprived
the air is depleting from with inside
you are deprived from with in your lungs
choking on your guiltless devotion

plane crash into the fucking ocean
plane crash a lifeless emotion
plane crash a short sting then you suffer
plane crash into the fucking ocean
