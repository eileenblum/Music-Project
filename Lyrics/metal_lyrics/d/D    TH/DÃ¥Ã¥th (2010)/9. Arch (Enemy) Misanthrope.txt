Stab away intentions
With shards of the broken glass
Visions smeared with images
Beyond the red and black

The veil of hypocrisy
Commanding down its distant suffering
Disfigured idols commence
That the truth will be unveiled

Blind are the fallen
Acid peels the skin
Omen of the reflecting god
The mirrored discontent
Blind are the fallen
The virus of lament
Omen of the reflecting god
Feeling a mirrored discontent

Separate the stigmata
In the hands of the prophecies
Retain the dismissive
Agreements of the weak

Their misguided decrees of
Silent murder of reign and terror
The observations wasted and sentenced to burn of silence

Blind are the fallen
Acid peels the skin
Omen of the reflecting god
The mirrored discontent
Blind are the fallen
The virus of lament
Omen of the reflecting god
Feeling a mirrored discontent
