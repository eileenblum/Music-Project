Forcing me into this emotion
Enduring years of punishment
I'm observing the path of destruction
From a distant reality

Light the candle at both ends
And distort the flame inside
Everything is a cold devotion
Left to its demise

Oblivion now begins to set it
Opening truth from the fucked up wounds
Anticipate when you turn away from
The scars of face that you seek to replace

Light the candle at both ends
And distort the flame inside
Everything is a cold devotion left to its demise

I've lit the candle at both ends
Spiralling into the hell
Distort the flame
Everything is cold and blacked out
Collapsing from your selfish demise

Demise

Anticipation overtaking
Unrelenting methods of laceration
