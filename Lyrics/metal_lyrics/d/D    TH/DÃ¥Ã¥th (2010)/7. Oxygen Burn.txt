Gasping for one last breath
Crushed in the endless vortex
Implied decisions are reborn
Swallowing it down with the taste of poison on your tongue
The sun consumes the oxygen

I fucked your life

I fucked your life
Torn apart and demoralized
Destroying all that you've clung too

A plane is drawn
The line that divides
Feeling the sting from the
Sharpened point at which you fail

Oxygen burning every sense
Carcinogen inhaling death

I fucked your life
Demoralized

Choking on a new disease
Drowning in self pity
Taking one last breath
Taking one last breath
