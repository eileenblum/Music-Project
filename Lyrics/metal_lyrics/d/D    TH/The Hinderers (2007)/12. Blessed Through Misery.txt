Trained perversion
On whose back we ride
Peace through misery
Gibbous hunchback
Harmful vision
Scabbing over your eyes!
Blessed through misery
Blessed our castle to shame

Whose opinion nullifies
Thoughts from the brain
Pervert!
Decaying evidence...

Lust!
Unmeasured
Sent down
Under me
Put on
The garments of disease
Sent out to breed...

Lay down on me
With your somber dream lost
Souls they seek
Undead company ripe from rot
Intangibly the dead shall pave
The way from here
Beyond fill their mouths
With dirt uncircumcised
Of lips
That have no voice compassion is grounded
Our face turned in shame of course they'll give it to me
A person of disease...
