Visions gone, the memories are stung along
Visions gone, they're grown thinner as the years grow
Long
Fight, fight the sentient
It turns automatic
Fight, fight the sentient
For years of bitter memories

Urgent stares break the visions apart
And block the world we see
Long dead stares break the visions apart
Black tears that block out the light

Visions gone, no time to cry for gods of sight
Visions gone, the soul digger plucked the eyes of
Light
Fight, fight the sentient
It turns automatic
Fight, fight the sentient
For years of bitter memories

Urgent stares break the visions apart
And block the world we see
Long dead stares break the visions apart
Black tears that block out the light

[Solo - Werstler]

Urgent stares break the visions apart
And block the world we see
Long dead stares break the visions apart
Black tears that block out the light
