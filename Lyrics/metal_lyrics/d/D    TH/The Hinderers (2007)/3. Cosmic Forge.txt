Behold the face of transfiguration
An extension of the harm from cast-out nations
Fall from the above
A fall from the above
And the fog surrounds
And confounds your vision

Time starts to bend
Can't stop the masochist
Time finds its target
It - can't survive

Who finds their nature to measure?
Who finds their fall at the end of a blade?
Who finds their nature to measure?
Who finds their fall at the end of
The end of the blade

Behold the face of transfiguration
An extension of the harm from cast-out nations
Fall from the above
A fall from the above
And the fog surrounds
And confounds your vision

Time starts to bend
Can't stop the masochist
Time finds its target
It - can't survive

[Solo - Levi]

Bound tight chains surround the cast-out nations
Bound tight chains surround the place you live
Drown within your chains from false conceptions
Far from dying, these human laws cut inside your mind

Life sought through transfiguration
Fills your mouth full of falsehood misinformation
Fall from the above
A fall from the above
A life of limitations
Trapped within the confines of time

Time starts to bend
Can't stop the masochist
Time finds its target
It - can't survive

[Solo - Levi]

Prison
From within
Forged ascent
Starts to falter
Out of time
The years shall follow
The tears of the dead
Who thirst for life
