The great wrathful shall roam
Stalks
Cut free of life
From
The kingdom of lies
Bend
Your knees for me

Home
The great wrathful shall roam
Stalks
Cut free of life
From
The kingdom of lies
Bend
Your knees for me

Those that take
From those who are sick
With minds that mix
The facts with fantasy

He loves
The part
He was taught
Disowned of thought
With nature to judge
But it's all on one side
Inside it's dark
But it's home to his mind
His path
Shall free
The tortures inside
The tortures
Inside

(me! me!) - in the background
Fill these voids with light
Praise the great profane
Pain shall procure the rain
Raping the barren land

Home
The great wrathful shall roam
Stalks
Cut free of life
From
The kingdom of lies
Bend
Your knees for me
Bend
Your knees for me
