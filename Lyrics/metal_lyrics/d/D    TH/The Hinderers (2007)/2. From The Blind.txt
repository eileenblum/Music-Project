Seasons pass by the shells
Of the names unknown
Silent a void of thought darkening/cells of the mind

Taken from the blind
Truth from behind
Scorn for all their kind/their
Lives we bind
Within the throne
Secret overtone
The people chanting
Not heard as they're trampled over
Rise in fury
The start of progress
The broken promise
You place your full trust in
Rise in fury
The start of progress
The broken promise
You place your...

Reason spills out like
Our shouts to ears unheard
Your thoughts devoid from enlightening
Cells of the mind

Taken from the blind
Truth from behind
Scorn for all their kind
Their lives we bind
Within the throne
Secret overtone
The people chanting
Not heard as they're trampled over
Rise in fury
The start of progress
The broken promise
You place your full trust in
Rise in fury
The start of progress
The broken promise
You place your...

This ovulation, eager for divulsion
Thrust on limitless livestock, our battle waged
From the mist of diversion, our force shall further
The reign of blood, for ages to come...

Thoughts behind lock and key
Talk inside cause they won't go free
Silence is their only decree
Die inside cause they can't go free

[Double Solo - Levi / Werstler]

Not heard as they're trampled over
Rise in fury
