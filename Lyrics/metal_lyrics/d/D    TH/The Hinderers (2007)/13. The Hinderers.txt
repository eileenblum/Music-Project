Using your hands to murder to fasten minds
That feel no mercy and who knows us
Who knows us?
Bound by diversion rehearsed
Endlessly through time hindered
Your life is measured
By those inhibiting your mind

Who's the scapegoat?
Who is labeled?
Who gnaws the desert
In frustration?
Now who's the scapegoat?
Who is labeled?
Who gnaws the desert
In frustration?

[Solo - Werstler]

Bound by
Diversion rehearsed
Endlessly through time hindered
Your life is measured
By those inhibiting your mind

Awe-inspired by murder
To trample dead
Those who are subject to torture
And to hinder
To hinder

[Solo - Levi]
