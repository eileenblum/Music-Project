Fall
Spawns of malicious mantra seek
The dogs are looking but they will not see
The thoughts fall apart
The false elite
The broken shells feed on the living yeast

Jumping dark in the bones of
Me resonate in the lower part
Best double in elation
Seek looking but your not free

Rotten
Eats of its own
A mind that's sick
Feed the flood
Compassionate

War born
Contemplation
War born
The dog's perdition
War born
In complication
War born tri-adverserenade

The thoughts of normalcy
Locked in the halls of victory
The hands reach up
Supporting the cup of conformity

Fall
Spawns of malicious mantra seek
The dogs are looking but they will not see
The thoughts fall apart
The false elite
The broken shells feed on the living yeast
