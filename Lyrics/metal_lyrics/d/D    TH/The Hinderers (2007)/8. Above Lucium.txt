Beyond
Your sun
Beyond
Mundane fate
Bind the mass repression
Broken teeth on
Burnt possessions
You fall apart
Soul repression without chains
You falter

Beyond
Your sun
Beyond
Mundane fate
Neck-chains bind
The masses muffled cries wail
From ashes consulting peace
The unrepentant without chains
The feral

Above lucium
Above lucium
Above lucium
Lay sonnelion
In your mind
Taste pity
From the harlot's tongue
Red tunnel
Comfort of my lips
Hate finds
Heart in submission
Your crooked ways
Your reputation
Drowned in a mixed emotion
Might be
Something wrong - with - you

Lost in the trenches of dreams
Waking gleams beyond
Treason calling from the void before me
Slut
In the trenches of dreams
Waking gleams beyond
Treason
Calling from the void before me

Slut
Empty born child
From the womb is torn
Deviating form
Sonnelion is born

Look beyond me
It's
It's evolved
The force shall withdraw
The boundaries
Beyond me
It's
It's evolved
An empty offspring
Drove me on
An empty offspring
Drove me on
An empty offspring
Drove me on
An empty offspring
Drove me on
