Spokes of the merciful forms are no more
Whose force is irascible under black skies?
Born to the lands of the merciless forms
The birth of irascible tempest by terror

It forms a vision
It forms a vision
It forms a vision in me

Ride through the mist of misery
Row through the silent abode
The wisp of misery
Row through the silent abode

[Solo - Levi]

Blind, the sullen seasons
A somber sign
A tomb of reasons
Is home - to -  me
Berserk - wrathful - hinder - visions
(visions) berserk (berserk) wrathful (wrathful) hinder
(hinder) visions

When the great tempest awakes
The forms align

Ride through the mist of misery
Row through the silent abode
The wisp of misery
Row through the silent abode

Ride through the mist of misery
Row through the silent abode
The wisp of misery
Row through the silent abode

It forms a vision
It forms a vision
It forms a vision in me
