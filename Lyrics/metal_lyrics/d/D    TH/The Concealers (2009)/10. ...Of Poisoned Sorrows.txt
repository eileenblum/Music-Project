The reason is forbidden
To live within the nothing
Men of contention will thrive on devoured minds
Devoured minds of poisoned sorrows
Succumbing to worthless paths of devout cravings
Succumbing to worthless paths of devout cravings for you

Cravings for you
Realize that patience is a virtue
Discarded ignorance is a mask without a mind

Nothing more than pitiless minds
Without a strong sense of time
A sense of time
Devout cravings for you

The cravings for you
Realize that patience is a virtue
Discarded ignorance is a mask without a mind
