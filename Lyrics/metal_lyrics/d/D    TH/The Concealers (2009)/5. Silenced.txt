Remove your veil of hidden demon secrecy
Convert all the wicked, vengeful, cast out disbelievers
Silence the opposing forces rising up in vein
Devour!
The minds of purity
All that has been foreseen
Of all your impure thoughts

They lied to us about the real truth
They shut us up and took control
We have been silenced
Mouths sewn with fear
Silenced and left to die

[Solo: Levi]

Remove your veil of hidden demon secrecy
Convert all the disinformed cast out misconceives
Silence the opposing thoughts that led to our decay
Devour!

They lied to us about the real truth
They shut us up and took control
We have been silenced
Mouths sewn with fear
Silenced and left to die

[Solo: Werstler]

Remove the veil
Convert the wicked
Silence all thoughts that led to our decay
Decay
Silence our thoughts
Decay
Silence our voices
Decay
Silence all thoughts
Decay
Destroy the power and control

They lied to us about the real truth
They shut us up and took control
We have been silenced
Mouths sewn with fear
Silenced and left to die
Silenced
