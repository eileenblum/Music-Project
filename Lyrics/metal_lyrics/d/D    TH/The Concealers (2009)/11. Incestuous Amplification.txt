Blind, to keep us hidden in the darkness
Cover up our eyes from the grand deception
Lies, to keep us clueless and complacent
Incestuous amplification
This is all want
Half-truths, not the bigger picture
This is all we see
Reveal the hidden secrets

[Solo: Werstler]

Whose hope shall be cut off?
Trust lost in the eyes of pure
Who shall, shall be cut off?
Wrath spilled from the mouth
Who shall be cut from the mouth?
Blood shall be spilled from the wicked
