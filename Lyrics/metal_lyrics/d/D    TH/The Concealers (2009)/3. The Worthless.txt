Ignite a burning flame
Swallowed up by waves
Inside diseases linger, seeking out for a new host
Blight caused by the wind, evil blows in from the east
Burn the village down, in an ocean full of flames

We can never give up our lives
Thinking we will live forever
One by one we turn to ash
We can only die alone

Infected with disease, spread the virus of deception
Inside the fear consumes in an ocean full of flames

We can never give up our lives
Thinking we will live forever
One by one we turn to ash
We can only die alone

[Solo: Levi]
[Solo: Werstler]
[Solo: Levi]

We can never give up our lives
Thinking we will live forever
One by one we turn to ash
We can only die alone

The cleansing of victims
Anointing in ash
In the darkness of death
Bathed in the blood of the worthless
The worthless
