I had an insane vision
Infest the marsh with death,
Metallic birds of prey
They spread their wings and scatter
Sharp blades deep in the earth.

Sharpen the blades
That cut through opposition
Stabbing into submission
Slicing right through everything

I had an insane vision
Controlling everything,
Metallic birds of prey
They spread their wings and die

Sharpen the blades
That cut through opposition
Stabbing into submission
Slicing right through everything

[Solo: Werstler]

You will expose your mask
Omit the lie
Only against their will
A mass division
The cleansing of the soul

[Solo: Levi]

Sharpen the blades
That cut through opposition
Stabbing into submission
Slicing right through everything
