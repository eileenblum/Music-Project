Buying up the truth
And selling it for lies
Left hidden buried in the dust
And living with the lie

Fight
But I am weak
Hide
A selfish mind
Hate
Perceived as living
Bound in secret
Death by deceiving

Now release the pain
Encased in self-destruction
Destroy the enemy of self-corruption
Bind your face in truth
And stabbing out your eyes
Preparing for eternal darkness
Thriving with the lie that life has bound

Fight
But I am weak
Hide
A selfish mind
Hate
Perceived as living
Bound in secret
Death by deceiving

Now release the pain
Encased in self-destruction
Destroy the enemy of self-corruption
Chose on your persistent failures
Choke on a masochistic state of bliss
Self-corruption

[Solo: Werstler]

Now release the pain
Encased in self-destruction
Destroy the enemy of self-corruption
