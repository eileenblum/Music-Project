[x2]
Why can't I free the things I want
Why can't I be a part alone

Thrusting hate
Inside, I found a reason
Nothing from nothing attacking something from nothing
we'll find
Thrusting hate
Inside, I found a reason
Tracing dead habits and finding nothing from nothing
untrue

You forsake my mind
You should have never possessed
Arid demon
Yourself undone/done/done

[x3]
Keep on looking but you fuck it away
And you'll keep on trying but your minds led astray
