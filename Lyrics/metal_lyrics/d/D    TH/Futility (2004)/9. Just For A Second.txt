I, I'm the on little me
Summer any day
You were never found
But tell me anyway
Want that instant salvation
What I want I want
You were never supposed to see

Everything was given to you right from the start
Born from greed and corruption but you never knew what this was about

[x3]
Not for a second
Not a single second

Don't think logically
Why don't you tell yourself I never did look upside down?

[x4]
Lie dormantly
Take them down for a sign

Don't think logically
Why don't you tell yourself I never did
Look upside down

Lie dormantly
Take them down for a sign
Lie dormantly
Take them down for a sign
Lie dormantly
Take them down for a sign
Lie dormantly
Take them down for a sign
