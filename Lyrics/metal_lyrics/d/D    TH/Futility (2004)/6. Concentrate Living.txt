The pigs downtown live in the thick thicket
If I had a knife I'd just want to stick it

Overweight women when they sweat I can't take it
If I had a fork I'd just want to stick it

The living dead downtown live in the thicket [x4]

[x2]
I live in underground cities
Forced down to do your bidding
I want to break this prison
Squashed chaos and concentrate living

[x3]

Stick 'em
Blood ceremony
Kick 'em
My territory
Kill them
Death matrimony

Slicing off a shade of skin
Appeases the ghosts and ghouls within
Prisoner of pain
Shall I awake from this inane
Lying in this crib tomorrow
'Till then I'll bide my time in sorrow

Stick..stick stick stick sticiciick

Stick 'em
Blood ceremony
Kick 'em
My territory
Kill them
Death matrimony
Stick 'em
Blood ceremony
Kick 'em
My territory
Kill them
Death matrimony

I live in underground cities
Forced down to do your bidding
I want to break this prison
Squashed chaos and concentrate living
I live in underground cities
Forced down to do your bidding
I want to break this prison
Squashed chaos and concentrate living
