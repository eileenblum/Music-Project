All must change
It all must change

Owned but concealed
Coma, tunnel vision
Undercover down
Midtown mutation

Hold the insect down
Hostile automation
Keys to unlock yourself
All must change

All must change
It all must change

Deep, deep in me
Hidden, keep
Filling this void inside of me
Is this the way I'm to be?
Building a wall around me
Is this the way I'm to be?

[x2]
Non stop shaking
Now your mind sickens
And your thoughts collapse
But you fight suggestion
Stop the navigator

Deep, deep in me
Hidden, keep
Filling this void inside of me
Is this the way I'm to be?
Building a wall around me
Is this the way I'm to be?

Non stop shaking
Now your mind sickens
And your thoughts collapse
But you fight suggestion
Stop the navigator
Now your mind sickens
And your thoughts collapse
But you fight suggestion
Stop the navigator dead

Shaken
Forsaken
What's taken
Is making
The logic
Unmoving
Unfeeling
And stealing

Over load my senses with multiple connections
Of forgotten complications aborting jumpers in all my cells

Someone bought
The servant of broken laws
My summoner overloads
For celibate arrow
For life without love is a name I know I can't say you
put on a mask and go to the termite god
A definite goal accomplish a massacre to open a different door
