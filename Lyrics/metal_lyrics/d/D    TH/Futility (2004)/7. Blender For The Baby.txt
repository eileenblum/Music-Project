Your cells are gonna get it
Your strain contaminated
Your cells conjoin shun the love, but you're going to get it

Your system torn from the straps of the gods
The one you chose will be gone by night
Insect philosophy
You're now disconnected

[x2]
Odds are nothing would never go right
Darkness forever will hold you tight

Long night,
darkness kills the innocent,
the world's end is it imminent?
No one wants to take the hint,
No one wants your baby
Blender for the baby
Hanger for the baby,
bitch you're fucking crazy

[x2]
Odds are nothing would never go right
Darkness forever will hold you tight

Endless season
No safe place improper methods
Splintered feelings run for cover copulating whore
Inside infinite on fire, illuminating no one
Outside natural robot doom

All it takes
Let it fall out the emotion charged commodity

Dominate
You're so false sucking all she soul right outta me

And then you rub it in

Do it some more till I'm overcome with all this haste

And now I'm pounding your face
Never let go lay motherfuckers in their place

[x2]
Odds are nothing would never go right
Darkness forever will hold you tight
