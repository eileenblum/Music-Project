On your face unfallowed?? eyes
You can't disguise that you're lost
The trusted one
The only one you knew
Now fills your mind with poison

How deep does your blood run
You're far from brainless
Grace could be with you now
Yet you feel loneliness

In times of darkness
You will find decay
In times of light
You are unworthy

The fallen one
The only thing you knew
Has filled your mind with poison

How deep does your blood run
You're far from brainless
Grace could be with you now
Yet you feel loneliness

He is the one you feel
He takes all you own
There is no end

Fear of the unknown
Of what is true
You'll see no light

Belief
The unknown
He has no proof
Yet he sees the light
