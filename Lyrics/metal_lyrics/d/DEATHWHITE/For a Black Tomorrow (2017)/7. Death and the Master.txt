What you waste
It's not ??
Although it seems to be

Time slips through the cracks
And breaks the foundation
It's not your face

Your bleeding heart, it cries
Ruled by pain
It's all you ever knew

Falling forever, without fail
There is no way out
There is no way out

Now it's real
The coming of dark
Death and the master
Time is yours to burn

A cruel speck of hope
But time wears in
You won't be missed

Falling forever, without fail
But only you I will forget

Hold the flame??
The flame is fleeting
Death and the master
Time is yours to burn

Cold run of day
Shines through forever

Now it's real
The coming of the dark
Death and the master
Time is yours to burn

The coming of the dark
Time is yours to burn
