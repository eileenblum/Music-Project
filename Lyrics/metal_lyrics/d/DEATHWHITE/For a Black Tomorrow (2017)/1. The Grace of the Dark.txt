I had hoped to hear a voice
That was familiar
Now this isolation
Is bearing down on me

I should remain still
Where all is quiet

There is nothing to remember
I won't wait
Or hope
For days
To come

I can let it go
This is a promise to keep
As I stay below

Into the dark
I will be free

On death's path
The grayscale is weak
Utmost pain I will never feel again
Utmost pain I will never feel again

There is nothing to remember
I won't wait
Or hope
For days
To come

I can let it go
This is a promise to keep
As I stay below

Into the dark
I will be free

On death's path
The grayscale is weak
Utmost pain I will never feel again
Utmost pain I will never feel again

As I stay below
