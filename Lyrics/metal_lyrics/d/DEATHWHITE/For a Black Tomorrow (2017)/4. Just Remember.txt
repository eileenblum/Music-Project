Just remember
Your vanity will only serve to haunt you
And just remember
That the last time Iâm saying goodbye
And all that ever mattered is gone

Just remember
You are but a trace of air, temporary and invalid
And just remember
Your bitter reflection has shown
That empty shell is all that is left

All comes down around you
Dying inside, helpless and weak
To pull you under, a fragile heart now shattered
No one sees a trace, no one ever will

All comes down around you
Dying inside, helpless and weak
To pull you under, a fragile heart now shattered
No one sees a trace, no one ever will
