Deeper down
Into the unknown
Lots of perspective
It lingers?? in the other side

Keep calling your name
Looking for purpose
When I'm drowning
I'm drowning

Reaching outward
But moving backward
But there is nowhere
In the kingdom of old??

Reaching outward
Moving backward
Powerless to grasp these words

Lost on on every side
Appending from the start
How can I be strong
When nothing is worse than this

Lost on every side
Appending from the start
How can I be strong
When nothing is worse than this

Dreaming I was
You are
I can't
Let go
Of anything

Being I was
You are
I can't
Let go
Of everything

Dreaming I was
You are
I can't
Let go
Of anything

Being I was
You are
I can't
Let go
Of everything

What is worse
Than seeing the other side
And knowing that nothing is worse than this
