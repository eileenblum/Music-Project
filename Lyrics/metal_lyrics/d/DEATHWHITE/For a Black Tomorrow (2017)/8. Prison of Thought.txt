When I woke up, it was gone
Sanity, stability, taken for granted
There is no parallel for remorse
I feel pain is born from memories of what I did do
But now I answer to you

I can't let go for I am
So afraid of the way
The pain, the heart within would not remain
For it's useless to try
I'm not worth saving
This comes with a promise
It's only for you

In my mind there is no reason
Every thought afoul
Here I say
This is my prison
It's where I will remain

In my mind there is no reason
Every thought afoul
Here I say
This is my prison
It's where I will remain

I can't remember
When it was all clear and crystalline
Words are ?? ever speech in tongues
It colors my sense of being
I've never been so subdued
I'm altered
Discouraged
And alone

In my mind there is no reason
Every thought afoul
Here I say
This is my prison
It's where I will remain

In my mind there is no reason
Every thought afoul
Here I say
This is my prison
It's where I will remain

In my mind there is no reason
Every thought afoul
Here I say
This is my prison
It's where I will remain

In my mind there is no reason
Every thought afoul
Here I say
This is my prison
It's where I will remain
