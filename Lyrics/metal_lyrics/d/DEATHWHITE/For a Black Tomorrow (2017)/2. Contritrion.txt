Behind my back it's always near
The losing of time it's getting clear
Behind my back will be my fears
Yet to find the answer, no matter how I die

How I die
How I die

I was lost along the way
Can't believe how things are going
I hope to change today
Back to when I was you, but I've been destroyed

Been destroyed
Been destroyed

Calm in our regret with full remorse
I've left no mark
Feel you now you know
And left behind
Feelings of contrition forevermore

Rush through, wasting every muse
The longest route to take
Is the path of resistance

Rush through, wasting every muse
The longest route to take
Is the path of resistance

Calm in our regret with full remorse
I've left no mark
Feel you now you know
And left behind
Feelings of contrition forevermore
