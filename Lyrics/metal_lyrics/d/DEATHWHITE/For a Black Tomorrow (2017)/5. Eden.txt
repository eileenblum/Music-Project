Let me be apause??
When you have your own way
I am sworn to deridgen??
When it's not crystal clear
Saw your soul into fragments
The time has come to forget

Where were you
And how did we get here
May you rest inside
As your inner side ?? dies

Who were you thinking of
When the tide turned to blood
You no longer know what it's like to be alive

Where were you
And how did we get here
May you rest inside
As your inner side ?? dies

Eden
How did we get here
May you rest inside
As your inner side dies
