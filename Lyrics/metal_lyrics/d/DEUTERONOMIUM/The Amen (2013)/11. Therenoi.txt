[Job 3]

Let the day perish wherein I was born
Let that day be darkness
let gloom seize upon it
let the blackness of the day terrify it

Lo, let that night be solitary
Lo, let that night be barren

Let them curse it that curse the day,
who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
Let the stars of its twilight be dark;
let it wait for light, and have none.

Why died I not from the womb?
why did I not give up the ghost
For now should I have lain down and been quiet
then had I been at rest

Lo, let that night be solitary
Lo, let that night be barren

Let them curse it that curse the day,
who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
Let the stars of its twilight be dark;
let it wait for light, and have none.
