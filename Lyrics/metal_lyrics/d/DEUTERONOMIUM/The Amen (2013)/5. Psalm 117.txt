Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

O praise the Lord, all ye nations,
O praise The Lord, all ye people,
O praise the Lord, all ye nations,
O praise The Lord, all ye people,
For his merciful kindness is great toward us,
and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever!

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

O praise the Lord, all ye nations,
O praise The Lord, all ye people,
O praise the Lord, all ye nations,
O praise The Lord, all ye people,
For his merciful kindness is great toward us,
and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever!

Hallelujah!
