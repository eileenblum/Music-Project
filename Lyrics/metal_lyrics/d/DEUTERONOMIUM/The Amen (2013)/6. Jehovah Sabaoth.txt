[Isiah 6:3]

Holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts
Holy, holy is Jehovah Sabaoth
Holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts
Holy, holy is Jehovah Sabaoth

For behold, He Who forms the mountains
For behold, He who creates the wind.
For Behold, He Who makes dawn into darkness
the Lord of Sabaoth is His name

Holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts
Holy, holy is Jehovah Sabaoth
Holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts
Holy, holy is Jehovah Sabaoth

You are worthy, our Lord, the Holy One,
to receive glory, honor, and power,
Holy, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,
who was, and is, and is to come.

Jehovah Sabaoth
