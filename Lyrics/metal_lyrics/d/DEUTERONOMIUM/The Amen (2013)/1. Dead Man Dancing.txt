Come out! Come out!
You're not dead anymore
Take off your grave clothes and go!

Sing, mute man sing!
Hear, deaf man hear!
See, blind man see!
Dance, dead man dance!

Wake up! Wake up!
A loud voice calls you by name!
Wake up!
You've been born again

Sing, mute man sing!
Hear, deaf man hear!
See, blind man see!
Dance, dead man dance!
