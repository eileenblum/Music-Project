[Matthew 12:40]

On the day the Christ was crucified,
darkness covered the land,
on the day the Christ was crucified, the earth shook,
on the day the Christ was crucified,
the veil in the Temple was torn in two
on the day the Christ was crucified,

He descended to Hell,
conquered the devil,
destroyed the power of Hades,
He descended to Hell,
conquered the devil,
took from the deuce all his power,
all of his power

On the day of Christ's resurrection,
Doors of Death fell down
on the day of Christ's resurrection
Grim Reaper was trampled on the ground
on the day of Christ's resurrection
The Devil lost the war,
on the day the Christ was resurrected

He descended to Hell,
conquered the devil,
destroyed the power of Hades,
He descended to Hell,
conquered the devil,
took from the deuce all his power,
all of his power

On the day the Christ was crucified,
darkness covered the land,
on the day the Christ was crucified, the earth shook,
on the day the Christ was crucified,
the veil in the Temple was torn in two
on the day the Christ was crucified,

He descended to Hell,
conquered the devil,
destroyed the power of Hades,
He descended to Hell,
conquered the devil,
took from the deuce all his power,
all of his power
