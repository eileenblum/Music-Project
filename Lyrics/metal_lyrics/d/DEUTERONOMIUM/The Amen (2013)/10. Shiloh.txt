Come, Shiloh, come
Shiloh is the...
Shiloh, come, come!
...the Peaceful One
Shiloh, come, come!
Shiloh is the One...
Come, Shiloh, come
...the One who brings rest.

Peace I leave with you;
My peace I give to you; not as the world gives.
Do not let your heart be troubled,
do not let your heart be fearful.

Come, Shiloh, come
Shiloh is the...
Shiloh, come, come!

Shiloh, come, come!
Shiloh is the One...
Come, Shiloh, come
...the One who brings rest.
