[John 8:58]

I am who I am
I am who is and who was
and I am who is to come,
I am the Almighty

I am - before Abraham was
I am - whom they sought to kill
I am - the Son of Man lifted up
I am - the Resurrection - I am the Life

I am the same today
I am the same yesterday
and forever and ever
I am the Lord

I am - before Abraham was
I am - whom they sought to kill
I am - the Son of Man lifted up
I am - the Resurrection - I am the Life
