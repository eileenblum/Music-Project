Arise, O Lord!
Deliver me, O my God!
Strike all my enemies on the jaw
break the teeth of the wicked

I am in the midst of lions
I lie among ravenous beasts
men whose teeth are spears and arrows,
whose tongues are sharp swords

How long will you look on?
Rescue my life from their ravages,
or they will tear me like a lion
and rip me to pieces

I am in the midst of lions
I lie among ravenous beasts
men whose teeth are spears and arrows,
whose tongues are sharp swords

They make their tongues as sharp as a serpent's
the poison of vipers is on their lips

I am in the midst of lions
I lie among ravenous beasts
men whose teeth are spears and arrows,
whose tongues are sharp swords
