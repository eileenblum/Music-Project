[Mark 15]

Jesus of Nazareth, was clothed in a purple robe
Jesus of Nazareth, was crowned with thorns

The king of the Jews, carried his cross to the place of a skull
The son of the God, was slaughtered on the place of a skull
The blood of the Lamb was flowing down the place of a skull

Jesus of Nazareth was beaten and spat on
Jesus of Nazareth was executed on a cross

The king of the Jews, carried his cross to the place of a skull
The son of the God, was slaughtered on the place of a skull
The blood of the Lamb was flowing down the place of a skull
