[Psalm 119]

I call with all my heart; answer me, O Lord,
I call out to you; save me
I rise before dawn and cry for help;

I long for your salvation, O Lord,
I long for you, O God

My eyes stay open through the watches of the night,
Those who devise wicked schemes are near,
Yet you are near, O Lord,

I long for your salvation, O Lord,
I long for you, O God

Look upon my suffering and deliver me,
Defend my cause and redeem me;

Many are the foes who persecute me,
May my cry come before you!
May my supplication come before you;
May your hand be ready to help me!

I long for your salvation, O Lord!
I have gone astray like a lost sheep .

Seek your servant, Seek Your (servant)
Seek Me!
