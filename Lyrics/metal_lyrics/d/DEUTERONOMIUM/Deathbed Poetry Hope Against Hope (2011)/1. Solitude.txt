I've become an outlaw, I've been ostracized 
My lovers and friends stand apart from my side 
My neighbours stay far away

Solitude, the greatest torture 
Solitude, the greatest torture 
This agony I cannot bear alone 
Solitude, the greatest torture

Keep my soul safe against any invader 
That in my weakness might undermine 
The trust I have in you through my faith

Solitude, the greatest torture 
Solitude, the greatest torture 
This agony I cannot bear alone 
Solitude, the greatest torture

Let it be known for every man
That you were my God and I was your servant
Until my end
In my end

Let it be known for every man
That you were my God and I was your servant
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

Solitude, the greatest torture 
Solitude, the greatest torture 
This agony I cannot bear alone 
Solitude, the greatest torture
