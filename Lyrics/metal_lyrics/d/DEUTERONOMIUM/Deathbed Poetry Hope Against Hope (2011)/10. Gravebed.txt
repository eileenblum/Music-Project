This malady bed is but a grave 
All I can say just an epitaph variation 
My hands and my feet, oddly shackled 
These feeble sinews, my chains of iron

My chained wrists remain the stiller 
The looser their bonds have become

On this bed of sickness I am the ghost of my own 
Frightening those who see me at my worst

Consider me dead as I lie here still 
Practising for the time I'll be lying in my grave

Lord, is this how you hang a man 
In front of his own door 
As you nail him down 
In the bottom of his bed?

No one remembers you when he's dead 
Who praises you from his grave? 
No one hears me singing your praise 
On this bed of disease, this door of my grave

- Gravebed, gravebed

State, even lower than this malady bed 
I might be lowered deep under ground

If my body shall fall into grave
You shall lift up my soul, washed out
Over and over and over again
In your tears, in your sweat, in your blood

"Do you want to get well?" [John 5:6]
"Be merciful to me, Lord, for I am faint;
O Lord, heal me, for my bones are in agony.' [Psalm 6:2]
"By his wounds we are healed." [Isaiah 53:5]
