Fear; imitating every state of mind; looking like love, yearning for something 
Yet being fear of losing; envious, suspicious; looking like bravery, dangers despising 
Yet being fear of losing respect and admiration

I cannot express what fear really is, I do not know what I'm afraid of
I'm not afraid of the incoming death; still I fear the progress of this sickness

There is no obscurity found in you, my light and my brightness
No untangled discrepancy exists in you, my sun and my moon

Not every sense of fear is cowardice, not every swerve an aim to escape
No, every claim is not a conclusion; no, every wish of change not a sign of despair

There is no obscurity found in you, my light and my brightness
No untangled discrepancy exists in you, my sun and my moon

Fear and joy, fright and delight belonging together, one breeding another
Those rejoice of you who have fear for you; for the fear of the Lord is the origin of wisdom

There is no obscurity found in you, my light and my brightness
No untangled discrepancy exists in you, my sun and my moon
