Like thousand years is one day for you, my Lord
Please, now for me, let one day be like a week
During mis singular day, for seven critical days
Allow me to weigh and judge myself
So you would not have to

First day is the day when you come to me
No matter the way, you always put me in crisis
Second is the light and witness of my conscience 
In which I have both sorrowful guilt in my soul
As well as glee of your sun that rose

Third one is the day when I prepare to receive
Your Son through sacrament he has decreed 
And as I become participant of bread and wine 
Your Son's flesh and blood also become mine 

On fourth day my house shall be parted 
As from this world I must depart 
This is the day or Lent, eve of a quantum feast 
Fifth one is the day of resurrection 
I shall be awaken, my body and soul reunited 
Then joined to the body of Christ

Sixth one, the day of crisis and judgment 
When my sentence shall be passed 
My seventh day, my abiding sabbath 
In your rest and glory I shall live
With no need for counting more days

"Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age" [Matthew 28:20]
"Never send out to ask for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for you"
