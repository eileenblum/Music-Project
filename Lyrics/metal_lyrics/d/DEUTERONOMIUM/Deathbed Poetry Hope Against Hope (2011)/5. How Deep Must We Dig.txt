I drink misery
Happiness I only get to taste
Gnei I reap with a scythe
By hands I pick spikes of delight
In sorrow I tramp constantly
Rarely do I get to lay my feet
Onto the soil of joy

My misery is absolute, my sorrow unambiguous 
My happiness is dubious, my delight inconstant

Barely any bliss is free from false and vile 
I must be poor and live in dearth 
To be able to show true gratitude 
And to be able to have patience 
I must be forlorn and tormented

How deep must we dig, and yet 
How impure is the gold that we find

Your grace may crowd into the depths of my soul 
But it does not make it unsoiled 
Your chastisement might burn deep into the core 
Yet I won't get rid of what is spoiled

You let the rain fall upon me 
It doesn't always melt my harshness 
You light your blaze within me 
But not always burn away the dross

You leal my wounds, still the scars remain 
The scars remain, scars still remain

My misery is absolute, my sorrow unambiguous 
My happiness is dubious, my delight inconstant

"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners." [Mark 2:17]
