The man who's funeral these bells are ringing, has reached his destination yesterday 
How come the bells didn't ring 'til now?

Bells that rang yesterday
Ushered his soul, the vanguard, out of this world
The ones ringing today bring his body, the rear, into the church
Bells that will ring wnen he gets there bring him to me so that I could learn

The bulls that now ring
Memento mori, memento mori

My God, besides this fever, do I still need
Another reminder of my mortality?

Do I need to watch the skull in the ring 
When my own face shows me the same thing?
Must I seek death from my neighbour's house
Though I can find it inside my blouse?

The skull in the ring
Memento mori, memento mori

The bells that now ring
Memento mori, memento mori
The skull in the ring
Memento mori, memento mori

I can hear this late brother of mine Whom they now lower into his grave 
Preaching through these ringing bells My funeral sermon
Speaking out aloud fratai that belfry Silently whispering from these curtains 
Uttering your own words: "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on"

[Revelations 14:13]
"The bells rings out: the pulse thereof is changed;
The tolling was a faint and intermitting pulse, upon one side;
This wronger and argues more and better life.
His soul is gone - whither?
Who saw it come in, or who saw it go out?
Nobody, yet everybody is sure he had one, and has none."
