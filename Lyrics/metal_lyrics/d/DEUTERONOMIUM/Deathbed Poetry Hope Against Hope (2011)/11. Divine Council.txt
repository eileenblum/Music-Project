As long as there's a chance to negotiate 
Things are not in totally hopeless shape 
Even in evil there's found some goodness 
Well enough to arouse frail confidence

O worthy guardian and sentinel of men 
Who turn to counsel while guarding them 
Whose every external deed 
Is a deed of the whole Trinity 
And within every task and duty 
Lies the hand of triune Deity

In my body there's no such blood vessel
Your Son's blood hasn't filled, I humbly confess 
The Son of man I've crucified time and again 
With my sins, so manifold and frequent

O Messed and honoured Trinity O divine and complete society
If you accept this confession or mine And consider it in your counsel divine
Then is my case not a hopeless one And my ruin not beforehand done
