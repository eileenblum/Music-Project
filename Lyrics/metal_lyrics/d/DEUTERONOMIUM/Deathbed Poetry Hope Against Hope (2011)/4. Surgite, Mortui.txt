Earth is the center of my body 
Heaven the center of my soul

My body falls down with no-one pushing 
Soul doesn't rise up without pulling 
Slowly my soul ascends towards heaven 
Like head over heels my body has fallen

Along with the first touch of sickness 
I also feel it's victory
 - It makes my life deceased

Gone is the sleep, the image of death 
To make way to the exemplar itself
- I might die rigtit now

Surgite, mortui - rise up, you dead 
Surgite, mortui - rise up, you dead 
Rise up, you dead â surgite, mortui

God shall not give me into the hands of Satan
I have fallen into the hands of the Lord
My bones have no peace for the sake of my sins

Pass my sins upon the one in whom you've pleased 
I shall see how great is his mercy 
And peace shall dwell within my bones

Gone is the sleep, the image of death 
To make way to "the exemplar itself 
- I might die right now

But God calls the nonexistent as if they existed

Surgite, mortui - rise up, you dead 
Surgite, mortui - rise up, you dead
Rise up, you dead â surgite, mortui
