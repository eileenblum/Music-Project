Why does not my soul foresee; beware, suspect and be aware of sin 
Like my body bewares of sickness?

On every path there's a sneaking snake 
A hidden temptation in every vocation 
Yet I walk, run and fly to these 
Paths of temptations I could flee 
Burgle a house of raging plague 
Far too far I test my fate 
-I entice the Devil himself

Sin makes me sick (sin makes me sick) binds me to bed 
Makes me decayed (sin makes me sick) buried and dead

I never had a conception of my disease
O greatness and depth of this wretched misery 
Where the first symptom of sickness is hell 
Where the fever of lust, pride and envy 
Never rang a bell
Where the first messenger speaking to me 
Does not utter "You might die" 
Neither he says "You must die" 
Harshly he states "You have died"

Sin makes me sick (sin makes me sick) binds me to bed 
Makes me decayed (sin makes me sick) buried and dead

There, my soul first becomes aware of
The irrevocability and incurability of my sickness
And yet, my God, I cannot accuse you
For you've placed an alerting artery into my soul
The voice of conscience which I extinguish
I speak, I drink and I sleep until it's defeat

Sin makes me sick (sin makes me sick) binds me to bed 
Makes me decayed (sin makes me sick) buried and dead
I am the prodigal son, my share was not denied 
I got my heritage, wasted and threw it away

But you, my God, have taken me back again and again; paid for my sins 
With the life of your Son; for the wages of sin is death 
Is the end of sickness
