That which is the most clandestine is the most perilous as well

By the curse of the serpent, I am cursed 
By his creeping I shall be ruined 
His sting in my heel was but a start 
And along with death, afterwards 
Through my ears, through my eyes 
He has invaded into my neart 
Through the holes in my very soul

In me the serpent works in secrecy; his presence I do not notice
One of his greatest deeds; when I sin, none perceives
His undeniable master deed; I sin so secretly even I don't see

Not that the Devil is within me 
But that I've become the devil for myself 
I do not only hold an adder on my chest 
But for my own self I am that serpent

Let your serpent of brass be ever-present in me 
Let nim heal this wound, stung by the serpent of old 
May the lion of Judah stand protecting me 
Against the roaring lion, seeking whom to devour

Grant me the wisdom of serpent to guard me 
Against the wickedness of the serpent

Serpent of brass against the serpent of old 
Lion of Judah against the one that roars 
And the spirit or your Dove against them both 
Against the roaring and the wicked ones

"For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil." [Ecclesiastes 12:14]

"So do not be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known." [Matthew 10:26]

"When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as m the heat of summer. Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniguity. I said, 'I will confess my transgressions to the Lord' - and you forgave the guilt of my sin.' [Psalm 32:3-5]
