Feel like screaming
Feel like screaming, I feel like crying
Feel like bleeding
Feel like bleeding, I feel like dying

Do not leave your brother in the dust
Care for the wounded
Do not hit your brother when he's down
Care for the wounded

Bleeding outside
Bleeding outside, I'm bleeding inside
Weeping for myself
Weeping for myself, I'm weeping for you

We're troubled but not crushed
Perplexed but not in despair
Persecuted but not forsaken
Cast down but not destroyed

Hurt by the enemy
Hurt by the enemy, I'm hurt by myself
Burnt by the lust
Burnt by the lust, I'm burnt by my sins

Do not leave your brother in the dust
Care for the wounded
Do not hit your brother when he's down
Care for the wounded

The words of the Lord I hear as a soft call:
"Come; rest in me, come; have my peace"
