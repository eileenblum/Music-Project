The remnant few who follow Jesus our King
No sound of retreat, time to rise and besiege

Retaliatory strike!

An assault with authority determined the
Work done on the Cross
We invade on waring knees
In Christ's name on high

We follow the cries of victory
Of the saints that have gone before
Will we falter at defeat? No!
We may lose a battle but we're sure to win the war

Retaliatory strike!

Onwards, onwards
A blood stained cross on our battle flag
Forward, soldiers
The sword will pierce the enemy

Retaliatory strike!

A forceful kingdom, made of forceful men
In violent travail, Hell has been shaken again

We follow the cries of victory
Of the saints that have gone before
Will we falter at defeat? No!
We may lose a battle but we're sure to win the war

Onwards, onwards
A blood stained cross on our battle flag
Forward, soldiers
The sword will pierce the enemy
