I don't know what exactly do you
expect from me, don't know
if what you see when you look at me
Is gonna disappoint you

I'm not the one to seek for you
I'm not the one to preach
I'm not the one to be seen there
Waving the flag in front of you

Please don't judge me harshly
Don't punish me because of my deeds
I know they're not forgotten quickly
That's why my heart still bleeds

I'm not the one to seek for you
I'm not the one to preach
I'm not the one to be seen there
Waving the flag in front of you

I'm just someone roaming these paths
Carrying a frail hope of a brighter day

With some love to give, some to have
Trying to guard that little flame of faith

I'm not the one to seek for you
I'm not the one to preach
I'm not the one to be seen there
Waving the flag in front of you
