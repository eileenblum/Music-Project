How many days we have left
How many days we have thrown away
How many years just passed
'Cause nothing serious happened to happen
I hate myself for a reason
For ruining the best years of my life
The only thing that keeps me alive
I know God is on my side

Nothing serious to say
It's only all about you
It's only a matter of
Matter of life

I really don't need to ask
Has the past treated you well
You look just like a zombie
You are nothing but a shell
Correct me if I am wrong
You have been longing for a rest
On Calvary Hill has been stocked
Life in it's fullness

Nothing serious to say
It's only all about you
It's only a matter of
Matter of life and death

IN SHAME
NO MORE
BY GRACE
IN CHRIST

Nothing serious to say
It's only all about you
It's only a matter of
Matter of life and death

Something serious to say
Christ died for you
It's the matter of
Matter of life and death

Of life and ...death
