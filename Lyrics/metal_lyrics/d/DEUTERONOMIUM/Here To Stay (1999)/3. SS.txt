Sin - more than actions, more than thoughts
Sin - more than feelings, more than words
Sin is what I am - my nature

Still I stand before my God
Holy, righteous and just
Hope He sees me through the blood
For I am ashes and dust

I am a man, fallen and filthy
Completely spoiled, selfish and greedy
The Son of Man, innocent and holy
Shed His blood and paid the penalty

Still I stand before my God
Holy, righteous and just
Hope He sees me through the blood
For I am ashes and dust

I am a part of holy priesthood
Completely forgiven by His Blood
I live no longer, Christ lives in me
In His name saint I can be

Still I stand before my God
Holy, righteous and just
Hope He sees me through the Blood
For I am ashes and dust
