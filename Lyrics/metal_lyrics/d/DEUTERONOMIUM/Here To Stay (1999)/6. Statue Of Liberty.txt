[Lyrics by Manu Lehtinen]

Weâre marching on, cry out for freedom
We wanna get liberty or death
Do whatever, whenever we want to
We donât see our liberty is dead

Manâs freedom, freedom to sin
Godâs freedom, freedom from sin

Free to stay, no need to pay
Free to leave, we wonât bleed
We donât care those crying out there
Weâre satisfied, when our love died?

We bow down to the statue of liberty
Worshipping our idol of freedom
The problem we donât wanna see
Weâre slaves to our freedom
- the fake freedom

We can only reach true liberty
In the Word of God Almighty
Live by grace, live by forgiveness
Have liberty in all itâs fullness

I bow down to my Lord of liberty
Worshipping my God of freedom
He has set me free
From the slavery of my freedom

...freedom ...freedom ...freedom!
...freedom ...freedom ...freedom!
