[Lyrics by Manu Lehtinen]

Jesus is the Lord of my life
The reason for my being
He lifts me up when I fall
Guides me through this world
To live is Christ

He is the Lord of my life
He is the Lord as I die

For to me as His child
Deathâs but a step to a new life
Iâll meet Him when I cross the line
Death canât take my joy away
To die is gain

He is the Lord of my life
He is the Lord as I die

Jesus is the Lord of my life
The reason for my being
He lifts me up when I fall
Guides me through this world
To live is Christ

He is the Lord of my life
He is the Lord as I die
