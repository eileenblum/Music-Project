[Lyrics by Manu Lehtinen]

âBehold, I am coming soon!
I am the A and O
The First and the Last
The Beginning and the Endâ

Hey, Jesus, come back
Wonât you come back
Come back to take me home

"I am the Root
The Offspring of David
The bright Morning Star
Yes, I am coming soonâ

Hey, Jesus, come back
Wonât you come back
Come back to take me home
