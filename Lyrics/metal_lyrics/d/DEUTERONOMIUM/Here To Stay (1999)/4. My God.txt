[Lyrics by J-J Kontoniemi]

People come and people go
I keep going against the flow
Too divine or rockinâ too loud
Always standing alone in the crowd
They think Iâve got low I.q.
âcos I donât think the way they do
I just want to search and take
Another view to see what is fake

Just me and my God

People come and people go
For peopleâs sake I wonât bow
Only thing that matters to me
By Jesus Christ Iâve been set free
Break the chains and listen to me
True belief will set you free
Dreams of freedom can be true
Itâs your life, itâs up to you

Just me and my God
