[Lyrics by Miika Partala]

Itâs not always easy to live this life
Itâs so much easier to see Paris and die
Well, I havenât seen it yet but maybe some day I will
But today Iâd like to ask what kind of man I am?

I am not a man with a sense of humor, I have no jokes to tell
If you get bored, you can go, I wonât blame your taste
But if you are curious and you have some time to stay
Please stay and listen to what kind of man I am

I am a fool of Christ
Does it bother you?
I hope it wonât and Iâm sorry if it does
But that kind of man I am

Well youâve had time to listen this far, are you still surprised?
I guess you are, but thatâs OK, you will surely survive!
But let me ask you what kind of man you really are?
And hey; let me know if Iâm too familiar!

I am a fool of Christ
I think itâs OK for you
Thank you and bye bye then
But whoâs fool are you?
