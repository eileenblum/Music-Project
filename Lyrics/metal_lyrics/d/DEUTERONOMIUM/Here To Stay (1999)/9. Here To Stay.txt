[Lyrics by Miika Partala]

I think everyone of us is waiting for something super
Prince or princess or whatever it is that could make this perfect
But life ainât easy, life ainât perfect and itâs not even fair
But still I love the life thatâs given to me and I want to live it wisely

Well, weâve been given the cards we canât change so we have to play with them
I would like to have some other colors and other numbers too
Yâknow Iâve lost some important ones and I know thatâs sad but true
And I hope when itâs my time to go I still have the best card to choose

I am not here to stay forever
I gotta go and it wonât take long
Just a bang and no me no more
But I have this moment and you have it too...

Well, I have told you about life in general and now itâs time for afterlife
I believe and I think itâs true that there is heaven and hell to choose
Eternal life or eternally died, I know itâs quite black and white
But who am I to re-write the Bible since I know itâs the word of God

I am not here to stay forever
I gotta go and it wonât take long
Just a bang and no me no more
But I have this moment and you have it too, so what we gonna do?
