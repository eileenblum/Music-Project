[Lyrics by Manu Lehtinen]

Jesus Christ, Lord of life
You say he is a liar
But itâs you whoâs telling lies
That mock the true Messiah

Better for you if youâd gone swimming
With a millstone around your neck
If youâd been thrown into the sea
With a millstone around your neck

I donât care what you say
Donât listen to your lies
But woe to you if you tempt away
One of these little ones

Better for you if youâd gone swimming
With a millstone around your neck
If youâd been thrown into the sea
With a millstone around your neck
