[Lyrics by Manu Lehtinen]

My purest thoughts
Filth in Your eyes
Most beautiful deeds
With ugly motives

Wash me clean
Fill my heart
Wash me clean
From sin apart
Iâm Christ addict

Sweetest words
From rotten heart
My purest love
Mud of the swines

Wash me clean
Fill my heart
Wash me clean
From sin apart
Iâm Christ addict

Self drags me down
Sinking swamp of sin
Give me Your hand
Jesus, and lift me up!

Most honest caring
Only foolâs gold
Deepest friendship
After selfish mind

Wash me clean
Fill my heart
Wash me clean
From sin apart
Iâm Christ addict
