[Lyrics by Manu Lehtinen]

Little do you, the children of darkness
Know the authority of true Lord
You, who dare to rise against Him
God through the ages, Creator of all

Think youâve chosen your part
As enemies of my God
But the fallen nature of sin
Makes every man His enemy

Lord our God, holy and righteous
Cannot stand the filthy and impure
Only chance to avoid His wrath
Blood of Christ, for our sins

We do not fight against you
You are not our enemies
Weâre asking you to break through
Deceiving darkness disease

Foreseen the end of your journey
Not understanding to be afraid
How pathetic that the sentenced
Think theyâre marching towards victory

Think youâve chosen your part
As enemies of my God
But the fallen nature of sin
Makes every man His enemy

My Lord gave His life for me
Your lord is taking yours
My God took the victory
Your god has lost the war

We do not fight against you
You are not our enemies
Weâre asking you to break through
Deceiving darkness disease
