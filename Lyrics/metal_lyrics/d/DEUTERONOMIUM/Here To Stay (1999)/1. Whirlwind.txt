[Lyrics by Manu Lehtinen]

So the plan was too good to waste;
Iâll just go near and Iâll just walk by
I wonât take and I wonât taste
Iâll only watch, no I ainât gonna die

Well, only this time and only this much
After that another and yet one more
It seemed like I was in control and I got the guts
But now whatâs happening, what am I heading for?

Iâm in a whirlwind, whirlwind
Round and round and round I swing
Falling into whirlwind, whirlwind
Deeper and deeper and deeper I spin

What seemed to be innocent is tightening the rope
Now the slave becomes master and the master is a slave
Yeah the slave leads the dance âcos the master is a dope
The whirls are speeding up and I ainât feeling so brave

Iâm in a whirlwind, whirlwind
Round and round and round I swing
Falling into whirlwind, whirlwind
Deeper and deeper and deeper I spin

So the life is too good to waste
I donât wanna fear and I donât wanna cry
I ainât gonna fake so I gotta haste
I wanna get up âcos I donât wanna die
