[Lyrics by J-J Kontoniemi]

Yeah, the life goes on
But somethingâs wrong
âcause the beer has lost itâs taste
Yes, the life goes on
But I canât go on
Iâve got no more years to waste

Yeah, the life goes on
And I try to hold on
âcause Iâve got no guts to go
Yes, the life goes on
So whatâs going on
Is this all that the world can show

Bad situation, no use trying
Lying on the floor, loudly crying
All that time and money I spent
Just to end up here, dead end

Yeah, the life goes on
Iâd better move on
Thereâs something beyond belief
Yes, my life goes on
And now I know
Godâs grace wonât ever deceive
