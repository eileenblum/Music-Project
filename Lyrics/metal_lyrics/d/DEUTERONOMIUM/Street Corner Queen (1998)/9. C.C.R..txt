You say hate is rising, death taking over
You've seen the right things, but there's more
The other side of the story
This side is seen with eyes
But there's another reality
Not seen with natural eyes

All this and a lot more
Told in the Book of Eternal Truth
The rise of hate, death and murder
Only beginning for events much greater:
The Great Tribulation and carrying away the
Church of Christ

Christ Church Rising
North from here, Heavens
Christ Church Leaving
These mortal landscapes

The Last Judgement, when living and death
Shall be righteously judged
Only ones who can stand before God
Are those whose deeds are seen
Through the blood of Christ
Washed clean - innocent

Christ Church Rising
North from here, Heavens
Christ Church Leaving
These mortal landscapes

Even today Jesus helps agonized mind
Presents the faith for a longing heart
Even today He turns hate into love
Presents the hope instead of despair
Even today you can be forgiven and God
Presents you the one-way ticket to...

Christ Church Rising
North from here, Heavens
Christ Church Leaving
These mortal landscapes
