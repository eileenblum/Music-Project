Dark figure of Black Raven
Has overshadowed my life for so long
Time and again I have cried out to You
Begging for freedom
But when the Raven comes back
It's only me against him - I fall

Black Raven of sin
His nails tearing my heart
Fear kills my yearning for purity
Shame keeps me in cold embrace of filth
Black Raven of sin

It's been said You're the Almighty
Why can't you take off this burden
Fear makes me shiver as I hear
The swish of his black wings
Clenching my fist I try to fight
Just to find myself drowned in the lake of sin

Black Raven of sin
His nails tearing my heart
Fear kills my yearning for purity
Shame keeps me in cold embrace of filth
Black Raven of sin

Through the tears I see my only chance
Turn my eyes away from fear and shame
Cast my glance at the glimmer of Light
I tear myself off the Raven's grasp
Drop my burden into Jesus' light
"I have sinned" -with no explain
Dancing in the crimson blood rain
I sing a new song, song of freedom

Black Raven of sin
I brought my sin to light
Fear no longer, shame no longer reign
Christ ripped off his wings, dead is the
Black Raven of sin
