Another night in a smoky club in town
Just like yesterday, just like tomorrow
It's the same place &amp; same people
Only the names have been changed

You're on the stage, like you've always been
A shining star, shining in the bar
Pick up a pretty lady in the crowd
You think about the night after the show

You point your finger and she gets embarrassed
You wink your eye and now she smiles
You smile too 'cause you know she's willing
Ready to kneel before your feet

That's your human nature, so who am I to criticize?
That's the human nature, sin has blinded your eyes

Tonight - you're not sleeping alone
Tomorrow - she's alone and you - you will be gone

That's your human nature, so who am I to criticize?
That's the human nature, sin has blinded your eyes

[Part II: True Love Waits]

You have sex with your ex and have sex with your next
Have sex with miss X if she's got some interest
But next time you wink your eye, take some time to
Think about the lie it's okay to get laid with
Anyone, anytime

'Cause the True Love waits
Sex gives it's best in the holy marriage
True Love waits
Pure when you commit yourself
To the one you really love
True Love waits
No one gets hurt when there is no dirt
True Love waits
And blessed by God are the lovebirds
Who want to fulfill His holy will
