Could someone tell me who took away
The light from my eyes
I'm walking through my nightmare called life
I don't care if it is day or night
Don't have any plans for the future
My future is dead
I only need my needle, don't need no bread
Deep in my head I know the butcher

Druglord, you stole my soul
Druglord, melted my brains
Druglord, made me a living dead
Don't give your pinkie to Druglord

I walk alone in my colorless world
I run for needle, steal for a trip
Whore for the Druglord, kill for his wish
I am as free as a wingless bird
I've lost my family, I've lost my friends
In this valley of misery cold are the walls
And in my head, House of the Damned calls
Will I follow before it ends

Druglord, you stole my soul
Druglord, melted my brains
Druglord, made me a living dead
Don't give your pinkie to Druglord

Druglord, leave me alone!
