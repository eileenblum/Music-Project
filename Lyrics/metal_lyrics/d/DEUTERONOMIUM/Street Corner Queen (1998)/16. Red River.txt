Bad boy, bad boy
Wanting some attention
Looking for some action
Can't get no satisfaction
I am, bad boy
Searching for my place
Falling on my face
Crying out for grace

Take me down
Take me down to Red River
Oh, I need to start again
Take me down
Take me down
Wash me clean in Red River
Cover me in Crimson
I need Red River

I know, I know
I've made a big mistake
Don't deserve no break
His love will never shake
I cry, you cry
Cry out for salvation
Hear this revelation
Ain't no condemnation

Take me down
Take me down to Red River
Oh, I need to start again
Take me down
Take me down
Wash me clean in Red River
Cover me in Crimson
I need Red River

Dripping from that tree
Flowing down Skull Mountain
Into that bloody sea
Cover you
Red River, cover me

Take me down
Take me down to Red River
Oh, I need to start again
Take me down
Take me down
Wash me clean in Red River
Cover me in Crimson
I need Red River

Take me down
Take me down to Red River
I need to start again
