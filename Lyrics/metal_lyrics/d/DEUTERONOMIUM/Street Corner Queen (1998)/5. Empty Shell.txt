It feels like yesterday
When I decided to turn away
Raised you to the place of God
Respected more than cleansing blood

I built my life with my own will
I became tough, conscience was still
In fever of love I did it all
Counted on you, now I shall fall

Long time I was running blind
It was up to me, I left all behind
You took my all and gave me hell
Wonderworld crushed, I was empty shell

So what I got was worse than nothing
Hurting memories, silent suffering
The shell stands tall and show goes on
But all from inside seems to be gone

Watch me God as I'm creeping back to you
I'm crying for mercy and feeling blue
Open my eyes and make me see
Bless my life and set me free

Long time I was running blind
It was up to me, I left all behind
You took my all and gave me hell
Wonderworld crushed, I was empty shell
