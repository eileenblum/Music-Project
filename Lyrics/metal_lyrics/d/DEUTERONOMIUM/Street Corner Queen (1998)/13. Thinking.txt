I've searched for hope from the ways of men
From the mazes of those hectic nations
And what have I found? Sun and happiness?
Or eternal moonlight, eternal sadness?

I've seen all those lands and people so far
Whose children had to born into the midst of war
Their homes were burned down by the hate of brothers
And the women were raped right under their eyes

So many ships sailing at those cold-watered seas
All those planes on the sky, will the bombing never cease?
So many catastrophes with countless innocent victims
All those bleak tears left behind by sadness

Questions asked, never answered
Hearts without love, not being cared
What is this senselessness of life?
Thinking, but do I have to cry?
