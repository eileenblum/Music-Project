In the evening she stands in the corner of street
Every single night, she is a street corner queen
With so many like her, she is selling the love
But still she knows it's not love at all

If you'd stay beside her and listen to her heart
Maybe you'd hear what is her little spark
She's waiting that there will come a day
With a prince on a white mount
Taking her away

From the midst of all that dirt and filth
He knows her past, he doesn't judge or punish
Just looks in her eyes and loves her so much
Just looks in her, in her eyes and loves

If you'd stay beside her and listen to her heart
Maybe you'd hear what is her little spark
She's waiting that there will come a day
With a prince on a white mount
Taking her away

Who would tell her that the Prince is already here
Waiting for a chance to save her from that misery
The Son of God who wouldn't let her fall
But loves her with a love that can change that all

Love her with a love her with a
love her with a love her with a love
