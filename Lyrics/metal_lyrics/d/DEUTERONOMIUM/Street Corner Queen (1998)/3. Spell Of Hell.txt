"Hell is a totally cool site
So let's get there, all right?"
"I'm gonna party down there all the time
All the pleasures I'll want are mine!"
"Satan has given me his vow,
I'll rule over souls, beneath my feet they'll bow!"
You are all bewitched
Bewitched by the Spell of Hell

Spell of Hell
Spell of Hell will pass
Spell of Hell
Only pain will last

Let me tell you the Spell of Hell
Is just a lie that makes you die
That lie is Satan's crooked tool
He's gonna get you, Hell is not so cool
you think, and Satan thinks you're fool
"No fun in Hell", that's number one rule
And you will not rule over any souls
But suffer under a pain that holds

Spell of Hell
Spell of Hell will pass
Spell of Hell
Only pain will last

There is a way to avoid that place
Escape Satan's trap, enter God's grace
Bathe in the Blood of Christ
Receive forgiveness and new life
Let's get spelled with Christ
Savior, Lord and Light
Let's get spelled with Christ
Who takes away the night
