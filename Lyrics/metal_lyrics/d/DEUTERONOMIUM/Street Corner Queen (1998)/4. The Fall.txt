He is tired of living in the world of lies
Tired of walking with the boots of lie
Betrayed and crying his destiny
Stucked to last hope, he stucked to death

He betrayed himself and runaway
Was afraid of wounds and lost everything
The priest uttered "Rest In Peace"
But after death pain starts to scream

His father never loved him at all
Lots of money but never mother's warmth
He wanted to make others feel guilty
Self-destruction, he run away from humanity

He betrayed himself and runaway
Was afraid of wounds and lost everything
The priest uttered "Rest In Peace"
But after death pain starts to scream

When the fall comes, leaves are dropping
From the trees, onto his grave
He will never feel the peace
That was wished to his soul
He continues his endless running
Screaming his pain into eternity
