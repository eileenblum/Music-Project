Tribal Eagle with no wings
You cannot fly, tied up in skin
You cannot scream, you cannot sing
Sign of freedom, tied up in skin

Tribal Eagle freedom couldn't bring
You are nothing without black ink
Ink as black as your heart of sin
You don't exist without pricks of pin

Pricks of pin cause some ache
Ache for nothing, but one man's pain
Washed away the black ink sin
To your heart, freedom brings

Tribal Eagle, your wings grow strong
With His peace inside, you won't go wrong
Tied up in skin no more you are
A real eagle, fly free, fly far!
