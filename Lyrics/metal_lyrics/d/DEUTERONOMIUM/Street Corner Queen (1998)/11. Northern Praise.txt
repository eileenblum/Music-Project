Jesus Christ, the only Son of God
You are my only Lord, I believe in You
You have died for me so that I might have life
So I will follow You, Jesus, I love You

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, You have set me free
I've got a new life, I will praise Your name

Jesus Christ, the only Son of God
You are my only Lord, I believe in You
You have died for me so that I might have life
So I will follow You, Jesus, I love You

My heart's desire is to obey You
I want to fill Your will, share the Gospel to the world
My heart's desire is to obey You
I want to fill Your will and share the Gospel

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, You have set me free
I've got a new life, I will praise Your name

Lord, give me the words of life
And the power of Your love to be Your shining Light
To show Your lost lambs the way
Their way back home again
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, You have set me free
I've got a new life, I will praise Your name
Jesus, I will praise Your name!
