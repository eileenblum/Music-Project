The maestoso compositions of their debut album conquered our hearts.
Dark Sanctuary is offering here in their follow-up an even more mature effort:
wonderfully arranged and performed strings based layers and the legendary awesome female opera voice
on top of this somber orchestration.
Music to be played at dusk !
