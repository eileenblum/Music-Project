Death
Close my eyes
Stop my cries
Misery
Set me free
Hear me pray
Show me the way
Take me home
Now it's done

I'm a lonely sad spirit
I'm near you, can you feel it?
The death has taking me
And I roam for eternity

I'm flying around mankind
I can read in every mind
The escape, I want to find
But I'm so blind

I'm searching for the end.

In the kingdom of insanity
An unholy muddle consume me
An eternal scream
For an infinite dream

My realm is the pain
My tears are like rain
And now I'm gone
I'm going home

I'm waiting for the end.

My heart, colder than death, is so tired
Beyond the death, I live forever
I roam among the living, I hope I'm dreaming
My life is black, how can I escape from my destiny?

Oh, death, come and take my breath
Look the tears on my face
I want to burn in fire
This is my last desire.

There's nothing you can say
To block my bloody way
I have reached my last day
Now it is time to pay.

Death
Close my eyes
Stop my cries
Misery
Set me free
Hear me pray
Show me the way
Take me home
Now it's done
