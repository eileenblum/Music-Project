[Music by Arkdae, Lyrics by Marquise Ermia]

Valley of pain
Each tree is a part
Of sadness

Behold deep rivers
Which are a drop
Of a girl

Singing a song
Towards time
Forever

Dream never ends
I walk upon the plain
In your heart

The horses cry
Hear their words
From another edge

Valley of pain
Each tree is a part
Of sadness
