With my razor sharp and shiny claws
I'm reaching out to tear your soul apart
I'll suck you eyes and eat your flesh
A cannibal they call me
but I'm more the human fucking waste

I'll tear your soul
Tear it down 
To the ground

As my hunger grows I slit your wirstst
I am the wolf and you've been fucking warned
No pigs are save when I'm around
I'll turn your crosses upside down
and burn your temple to the ground

To the ground
Burn it down
To the ground!

The burden of life shall be carried no more
For me all your flesh and to the Devil your soul

Condemned from this realm as your last sun shall set
The maker of shadows collecting your debt
A feast for the wolf, for the beast above man
I shall revage an murder, til nothing is left!

When you least expect me I'll be there
For  I am death and you my whining whore
I'll cut yout throat and spill your blood 
I am a force from the abyss and I will take your

Worthless soul
Tear it down
Slit your throat
Bleed you dry
And I will bring you down with me to Hell
