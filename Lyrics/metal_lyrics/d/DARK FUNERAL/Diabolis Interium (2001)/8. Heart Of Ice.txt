[Music by Lord Ahriman. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula]

They howl in the night,
They are the children of the damned.
Cursed to live in darkness,
With a soul and a heart of ice.
Heart of ice..... 
As nightfall sets in, they crawl out from their caves.
Where they been hiding from the sunlight rays,
Until the moon calls out their names.

The endless search for fresh blood.

The never-ending hunger, burns their inside.
Like a flame from hell, never easing pain.
They are the living shadows, cursed to live in black.
You can see the reflection of the moon, in their empty eyes.

Look deep in their eyes, as the burning flames of hell arise.
Burning in their empty souls.

They move in the night, like a pack of wolves.
Hunting down their victims, there is no escape.
As nightfall sets in, they crawl out from their caves.
Where they been hiding from the sunlight rays,
Until the moon calls out their names.
The never-ending hunger, burns their inside.
Like a flame from hell, never easing pain.

They howl in the night,
They are the children of the damned.
Cursed to live in darkness,
With a soul and a heart of ice.
