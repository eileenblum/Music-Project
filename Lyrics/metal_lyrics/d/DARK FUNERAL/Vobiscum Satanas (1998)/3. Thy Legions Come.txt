[Music by Lord Ahriman. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula.]

MY WORD WILL SET THIS WORLD AFLAME.
HAIL ME!!!

WAR, WAR, WAR...
THE EARTH TREMBLES, BENEATH THE ALL-CONQUERING
CLOVEN HOOVES OF THE BLACK HORDE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS,
THE HORDE HAS BEEN DENIED THE THRONE.
AND THE WINGS WERE TAKEN FROM OUR LORD!
HE WAS CAST DOWN, INTO THE NETHERWORLD FOREVER.
BUT NOW IT'S TIME FOR US, TO RECLAIM HIS REALM.
AND BRING THIS WORLD INTO, ETERNAL DARKNESS.

[LUCIFER] LORD OF THE EAST, GATHER YOUR BEWINGED LEGIONS OF
THE WIND AND PREPARE TO DEFEND OUR LORD ABOVE THE GROUND.
[SATAN] LORD OF THE SOUTH, SPREAD YOUR INFERNAL FLAMES ACROSS
THE LAND AND GATHER YOUR STRENGTH TO FIGHT FOR THE THRONE.

OH, TYRANNOUS MASTER, BRING HELLISH STORM UPON THE CELESTIAL
KINGDOM SET THE VAULT OF HEAVE, INTO FLAMES
WAR!!!

SET THE LEGIONS FREE, OPEN WIDE YOUR GATES LET THEM STRIKE THE
EARTH, WITH YOUR WRATHFUL HATE LET ME SEE, YOUR MAJESTIC KINGDOM.
RISE BEFORE MY EYES, THE ABODE OF THE DAMNED
LET THE WEAK BE HURLED, INTO YOUR ETERNAL FIRE.
TO PERISH FOREVER MORE.

LISTEN TO ME INFERNAL LEGIONS OH, MIGHTY HORDES OF NIGHTFLYING
DEMONS THROUGHOUT THE DARKNESS THOU SHALLT  RIDE JOIN MY WARLORDS
AND FIGHT THE WAR WITH PRIDE.

[LEVIATHAN] LORD OF THE WEST, COMMAND YOUR APOCALYPTIC WAVE TO
BREAK THROUGH THE BARRIER OF THE WEAK.
[BELIAL] LORD OF THE NORTH, MAKE THE EARTH STRONG FOR OUR LEGIONS AND
DO NOT DENY THEM TO TREAD FORBIDDEN LAND.
