[Music by Lord Ahriman &amp; Typhos. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula &amp; Lord Ahriman.]

I AM ONE WITH SATAN.
I AM THE HORNED BEAST.
I AM THY MIGHTY EMPEROR.
RULER OF THE DARK DOMAIN.
MY BODY IS A TEMPLE.
WHEREIN ALL DEMONS DWELL.
A PANTHEON OF FLESH AM I.
AM I.

HAIL ME THE HORNED ONE I AM THE BEAST.

I AM THE TRUTH.
I AM EVERYTHING.
WHEREVER LIFE IS BORN. I AM THE FLAME.
WHEREVER DEATH WILL STRIKE.
I AM THE KNIFE. WHEREVER EVIL DWELLS.
I AM THE ONE BEHIND.

INFRONT OF THE INEFFABLE KING OF DARKNESS.
YOU SHALL DIE !!!

I AM ONE WITH SATAN.
I AM THE HORNED BEAST.
I AM THY MIGHTY EMPEROR, RULER OF THE DARK DOMAIN.
MY BODY IS A TEMPLE.
WHEREIN ALL DEMONS DWELL A PANTHEON OF FLESH AM I.

HAIL ME THE HORNED ONE I AM THE BEAST.

REGE SATANAS, AVE SATANAS, HAIL SATAN !
REGE SATANAS, AVE SATANAS, HAIL SATAN !
