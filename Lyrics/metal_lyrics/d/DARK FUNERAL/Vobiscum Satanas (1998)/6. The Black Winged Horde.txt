[Music by Lord Ahriman &amp; Typhos. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula.]

OPEN YOUR PORTALS, INFERNAL LORD.
OH, GREAT OPENER OF THE WAY COME FORTH HEAR MY CALLS,
BLAST YE FORTH THROUGH THE GATES UNHOLY MASTER
SPREAD YOUR WINGS FLY THEN HIGH, INTO THE BLOOD RED SKIES.
IT'S TIME TO CLAIM YOUR RIGHTFUL DOMAIN.

SEND OUT YOUR BLACK WINGED HORDE, THROUGH THE NIGHT.
DEFEND THEIR LORD, WHEN ANGELS STRIKE.
UNHOLY WAR, THUNDER ROAR ANGELS BLOOD FALLS TO THE GROUND.

SATAN LORD - THROUGH THE NIGHT HE FLIES HOLDING HIGH
THEIR IMPALED NAZARENE SON COVERED IN BLOOD, AND HIS
JAWS AGAPE HIS EYES AGLOW WITH THE FIRES OF HATE.
SATAN LORD - THROUGH THE NIGHT HE FLIES.
HOLDING HIGH THEIR IMPALED NAZARENE SON.
COVERD IN BLOOD, AND HIS JAWS AGAPE.
HIS EYES AGLOW WITH THE FIRES OF HATE.

ONCE AGAIN, THE DARK AGE WILL RISE WORLDS SET AFLAME,
BY YOUR HELLISH HATE NO MORE FEEBLE CHRISTIANS EVER
WILL REIGN BURNED INTO ETERNAL FIRE, IN YOUR DARKENED DOMAIN.

SATAN LORD - THROUGH THE NIGHT HE FLIES.
HOLDING HIGH THEIR IMPALED NAZARENE SON.
COVERED IN BLOOD, AND HIS JAWS AGAPE.
HIS EYES AGLOW WITH THE FIRES OF HATE.
SATAN LORD - THROUGH THE NIGHT HE FLIES.
HOLDING HIGH THEIR IMPALED NAZARENE SON.
COVERD IN BLOOD, AND HIS JAWS AGAPE.
HIS EYES AGLOW WITH THE FIRES OF HATE.
