[Music by Lord Ahriman. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula]

AS THE NIGHT OPENS, I SEE YOUR FACE IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON.
I SEE YOUR GLIMMERING EYES, REFLECTED BY THE GLITTERING SNOW.
FROZEN WINDS, WHINES OVER THE SILENT LANDSCAPE.
THE ONLY SOUND I HEAR, ARE THE STROKES OF YOUR WINGS.
RAVENNA, STRIGOI MORTII.
OH, COUNTESS IN BLACK, YOU WHO RIDES ON STORMY WINDS.
PRIMEVAL GODDESS, WHO'S NAME IS SPOKEN WITH FEAR.

THUNDER ROAR, LIGHTING STRIKES.
UNLOCK YOUR DEMON GATE.
COME FORTH, THE SERPENT'S QUEEN.
TORTURE BE THY NAME.

I GIVE TO YOU THIS SACRIFICE, TAKE THIS CHILD.
LEND ME ONE OF YOUR SERPENT EYES, TO SEE BEYOND THE DEMON GATES!!!

I INVOKE THE FLYING GODDESS, COME OUT FROM THE GORGE OF NIGHT.
SPREAD YOUR DARKENED WINGS, AND SOAR ABOVE THE GROUND.
RAVENNA, STRIGOI MORTII.
CAST THY SHADOW OVER EARTH, IN ANSWER OF MY CALLS.

DEMONIC BEAUTY, I SUMMON THEE.
THE INFERNAL MISTRESS OF THE UNDER WORLD.
FROM THE DARKEST DEPTHS OF THE ABYSS,
THAT HOLDS LIEGE ONLY FOR YOU.
WITH YOUR MALICE, AND YOUR SPITE.
WE COMMAND THE UTTER DESTRUCTION OF LIGHT.
SO COME FORTH, SERPENT QUEEN.
LEND ME YOUR FLAME OF HATE.
