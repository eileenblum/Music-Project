[Music by Lord Ahriman. Lyrics by Emperor Magus Caligula]

IN THE NAME, OF HE WHO REIGNS IN THE KINGDOM
OF FIRE AND ICE ARISE YE CREATURE OF SATAN - LORD.
ASCEND YOUR STORMS ACROSS THIS WORLD, AND
ANSWER TO OUR SUMMONING OH, SATAN - LORD.
I AM A CREATURE OF THY CREATION, SPAWN OF
THY FLAME, INFLAME OF THY MIND CARRIER OF THE
ALTERATION LET LIGHTING STORMS HAIL THE
APPROACH OF THY ARRIVAL OH, MIGHTY SATAN - LORD.

EVIL LORD OF THE DARKEST FLAME.
ARISE FROM YOUR GRAVE.
OH, IMMORTAL GOD.
SLAVA SATAN!!!

FLY OUT OVER HOLY DOMINION.
OVER THEIR TEEMING LANDS.
THROUGHOUT THE DARKENED NIGHTSKY.
CARRIED BY YOUR BLIZZARD STORM.
BRING WITH YOU THEIR WORLDS DESTRUCTION.
THAT ABIDE WITHIN THE ABYSS.
ALL-CONQUERING FLYING DEMON.
YOU ARE UNDER MY DOMINATION.

EVIL LORD OF THE DARKEST FLAME.
ARISE FROM YOUR GRAVE.
OH, IMMORTAL GOD.
SLAVA SATAN!!!

EVIL LORD OF THE DARKEST FLAME.
ARISE FROM YOUR GRAVE.
OH, IMMORTAL GOD.
HAIL SATAN!!!
