Speed freak
always cleaning your dentures
spending your last dollar
so you can stay up a little bit
longer.

All these years I've watched you crumble,
while you thought you 
were my hero
Dig 
your 
own 
hole
Dig 
your 
own 
hole
Speed freak
why are you wasting away?
I can see death in your eyes
bleeding from the noise as you cry...
It's so sad
no one's hearing your screaming
struggling for salvation
ending up with no teeth
chewing on your regrets

All these years I've watched you crumble,
while you thought you 
were my hero
Dig 
your 
own 
hole
Dig 
your 
own 
hole

All these years I've watched you crumble,
while you thought you 
were my hero
Dig 
your 
own 
hole
Dig 
your 
own 
hole
