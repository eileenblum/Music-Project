We may all have problems
Mine don't look a thing like yours
Is it enough to close my eyes
and justify so much strife
in the name of god?
If that's the case,
your God is what's fucked up

SILENCE
Tie your own knot
The only way to end 
to end all your suffering

Tie your own knot
Do us all a favor 
AND END ALL YOUR MISERY

Tie your own knot
The only way to end 
to end all your suffering
SILENCE 
Tie your own knot
Do us all a favor 
AND END ALL YOUR MISERY

to be swept aside
by anyone with a bigger gun
THAN MINE
THAN MINE

WITH A BIGGER GUN THAN MINE
THAN MINE
THAN MINE
THAN MINE
With a bigger gun that
Unjustified brutality 
Unjustified brutality 
Unjustified brutality 
Unjustified brutality
