Eyes wide,
life forces us,
to feed of our own fears
of others 
in order to
further our own interest.

Political agendas
Religious separation
Economic devastation 
And Racial segregation

I've learned
life forces us
to feed on our own fears
of others 
in order to
further our own interest.

Political agendas
Religious separation
Economic devastation 
And Racial segregation
SAVE ME!

We're taught only to take.
We're taught only to take.
I've nothing left to give.
I've nothing left to give.

Political agendas
Religious separation
Economic devastation 
And Racial segregation
How much longer till we fall apart? 
Born for nothing.

We're taught only to take,
only to take
only to take.
We're taught only to take,
only to take
only to take.
