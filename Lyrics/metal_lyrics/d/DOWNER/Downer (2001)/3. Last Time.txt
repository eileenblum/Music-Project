This is the last time 
I will fail you
This is the last time
I will fail you
This is a release from me
I must not be thinking straight
the weight on my shoulders 
is nothing but a headache to you.
You wanted your freedom
I hoped for food on your plate
either way WE LOSE.

Life has failed you 
for the last time.
This is the last time
I will fail you. 

I take home a portion 
I live to produce for The State
Trying to protect
your family from starving to death
I known a person 
who lost it all in one day
Job 
Wife 
and his friends

Life has failed you 
for the last time.
This is the last time
I will fail you. 
SIX FLOORS ON MY HEAD

In time to save you 
from the truth.
Who isn't my enemy? 
My sacrifice for you...
A sign of hope
goes into the air with me
AND INTO THE SIDEWALK BELOW

Forget about your fears
Forget about your fears
Torture for all these years
Torture for all these years
I failed you
failed you
failed you
SIX FLOORS ON MY HEAD
