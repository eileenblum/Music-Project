Squeezing your neck til suffocation
Future old enemies
Future old enemies.

Wallow in the shit of another day,
forced into ingesting the waste of society.

Cut out your tongue in protest
your voice
won't make a difference
you weren't meant to succeed
by any means...
That does not mean you're easily beat down
and easily faltered...
It won't make a difference when you're 
lying in a ditch cold.

So far from intelligence it sickens me
future old enemy
future old enemy.
Forged into tolls of hypocrisy
escape with integrity 
future old enemy.

Cut out your tongue in protest
your voice
won't make a difference
you weren't meant to succeed
by any means...
That does not mean you're easily beat down
and easily faltered...
It won't make a difference when you're 
lying in a ditch cold.

I can't
deny
I've more anger than fear
We fear
We lie
Help us save ourselves
I can't 
deny
NO ONE CAN SAVE YOU
No one can save you
No one can save you
No one can save you
No one can save you
