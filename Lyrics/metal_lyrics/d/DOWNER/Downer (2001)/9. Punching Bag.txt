I've led a pitiful life
need a scapegoat to blame
got a sick mind
you'd probably like it,
down on your knees
he said
"You should have know better" 

I PLAYED YOU 
YOU BOUGHT IT
I'VE BROKEN
THE TRUST YOU HAD IN ME
TRUST YOU HAD IN ME

You've got a gun in your mouth
you think it's somebody's fault
the dress was so short
you probably liked it
Down on your knees
he said 
"You should have know better"

I PLAYED YOU 
YOU BOUGHT IT
I'VE BROKEN
THE TRUST YOU HAD IN ME
TRUST YOU HAD IN ME

Turn your head away from me
forced to trust what you can't see
turn your head away from me
forced to trust what you can't see 
we are stronger on the outside
we are stronger on the outside
we are stronger on the outside
we are stronger on the outside
