My wallet gets thick from you fools
you pray to my hairpiece 
and my luxury.
It seems you're all victims to be
run for your lives.

Could it be time that god falters? 
Could it be time that I fall? 
Except for the pulpit I lean on
I've no legs at all. 

Faith is so blind it might hurt
and lead you to jump off the edge of the earth
it seems all you suckers would see
that I'm just a thief.

POOR MICE.
You said you would like me to stay
and lead you away from your problems
I helped create. 
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
I am. 

When life hits the bottom
you'll pray for my sympathy 
I don't c are what you hoped for
you paid for salvation
your prayers unaccounted for
stupid
wasted and poor.
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
I am.
My wallet gets thick from you fools
you pray to my hairpiece 
and my luxury.
It seems you're victims to be
run for your life.
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior? 
Who is your savior?
