Complicated
but always on my mind.
Why I've been down here
for sometime. 
My angst and frustration
when will it all end? 
But I'm down here
ALIVE. 
INJURED.
INJURED.
INJURED.

Leave me hanging
strums up by a threat. 
I've been living for a lie.
Often ill-fated
sometimes left for dead. 
But I'm breathing.

ALIVE. 
INJURED.
INJURED.
INJURED.

I'm alive
almost dead once
almost dead once
almost dead once

Would you be my friend? 
Who's bitter til the end
I'm up til I descend
you hate my friends
Bitter till the end
Bitter till the end
Bitter till the end

I'm alive
almost dead once
almost dead once
almost dead once

I'm alive
almost dead once
almost dead once
almost dead once

I'm alive
almost dead once
almost dead once
almost dead once

Would you be my friend? 
Who's bitter til the end
I'm up til I descend
you hate my friends
Bitter till the end
Bitter till the end
Bitter till the end

I'm alive
almost dead once
almost dead once
almost dead once

I'm alive
almost dead once
almost dead once
almost dead once
