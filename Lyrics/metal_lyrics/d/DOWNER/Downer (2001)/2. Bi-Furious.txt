Do you ever feel like your life
IS WASTING AWAY? 

with no purpose to speak of

If someone could just forget your name
AND ALLOW TO SLIP AWAY.

a life time of suffering could end 
your life time could end
your life time could end
your life time could end

Have you ever felt you're sinking
WITH MORE WEIGHT ON YOUR BACK?

no surface to scratch for

If someone would just forget you're alive
AND ALLOW YOU TO SLIP AWAY

a life time of suffering could end 
your life time could end
your life time could end
your life time could end

how many times have you promised
that no matter what you'd save us? 
Too much trust and we're often
let down quickly. 

All alone you sit
and contemplate these times
and how you're gonna survive
when everything safe around you
can't pull you to the side again. 
To lift to your feet
wipe the bloodstains from your teeth.
your life time could end
your life time could end
your life time could end
your life time could end

how many times have you promised
that no matter what you'd save us? 
Too much trust and we're often
let down quickly. 

You try to be someone
you're pretending you're the lucky one
what if I could barely make it to the surface...
We try to be someone
you're pretending you're the lucky one
what if I could barely make it to the surface...

Poor friend
poor friend
a life time of suffering 
Poor friend
poor friend
a life time of suffering
Poor friend
poor friend
