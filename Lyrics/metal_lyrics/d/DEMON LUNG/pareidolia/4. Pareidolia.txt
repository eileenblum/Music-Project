The sleeper
Awakens
I have seen
Him stirring

Itâs your disbelief
That gives him strength
Your stubborn lack of faith
That allows deception

Its gaining strength
I can feel it all around
Spoken with wicked tongue
This time you lose

The light was unafraid
Had seen before
Just when it entered night
The veil of sorrow

The image ominous
Despite the pure
A new motherâs son
This time you lose

You will not be saved by the Holy Ghost
You will not be saved by God

I live!
