Placed at the gates
Among the loss, left nothing
Tragedy struck the meek
You keep saying, but this time I mean it

The soil is thick
You should know that each buries its own
Not one word of what weâve done here
What weâve done will never be known

Mistaken ill intent
Put the life in sour ground
Watch it walk with me
The manâs heart may be stonier

Now the secret walks
Not strong enough to take us yet
But soon the love will cease
Repeat the cycle again, yeah

He doesnât know why he does the things he does
He knows what death really means
Itâs where the pain stops
And the ravage begins

Sometimes dead is better
Better than the faceless they

The ground is sour
