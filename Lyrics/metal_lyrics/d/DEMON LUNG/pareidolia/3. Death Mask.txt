Blacked out sun
Underground fire
Breath of life
Stacked on the Pyre

Stalactites on the dirt
Strange evolution
Sixty six days
Of changes within

Abstaining from life
To journey inside the mind
To the next realm
Oblivion to find

Sacrifice for an awakening
To see our lordâs face
Satan in flesh
Revealed to me

Before the death mask
Donât take a breath
Just relax while you
Witness your death
