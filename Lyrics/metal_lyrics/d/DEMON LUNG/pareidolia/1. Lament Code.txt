You have exhausted
That of this world
This is the object that you seek

With a key of lament
Much release is due
Take it, itâs yours

That day he fell from god
Now owned by Leviathan
Forever in his dark
The pleasures of flesh, preserved in Hell

Now that theyâve changed the rules
What was once the wicked
Is now an evil queen

Go on young girl
Break the Lament Code
The doctor soon begins

That day he fell from god
Now owned by Leviathan
Forever in his dark
The pleasures of flesh, preserved in Hell

His desire, then regret
Demented beyond control
Now a product of the deep
Go back, go back find him here you will not

Now thereâs no going back
Cause weâre already here
Theyâll be no more surprises
Cause we always have been

Now eternity to oblivion
Take it, itâs yours
