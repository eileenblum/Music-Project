child born, blessed by the goat
her reign will be unrelenting
ascent to a throne of darkness
centuries of sin

a mother warns of the evil unveiled
false prayers uttered to the heavens
his grasp closes in around her
answered from below

behold, the daughter
invoke, the father

disguised in a holy cloth
they pushed her away
canât know yet what is her path
now awakening

rest easy now child this is your home
life must go on and forget the old
hiding behind purity, it is her veil
but truth in her eyes tells a different tale

dark thoughts of ruin
disguised with a smile
no one will believe
what is within this child

bound to the father
with blood and bone
queen of the abyss
awaiting her throne

now the year of 15 has arrived
the end begins
darkness falls, unto this house of light
the end begins!

watch her rise from below
noble heiress, welcome to her kingdom
