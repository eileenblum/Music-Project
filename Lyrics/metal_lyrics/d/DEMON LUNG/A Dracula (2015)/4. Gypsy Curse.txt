enter the covenant
lips adorned with blood
blend into each other
then blend into he

giver of all fruitfulness
leaf, flower, and fruit
behold, thy new servant
we call unto you

we beseech the arianrhod
we beseech the silunus
we beseech the arianrhod
we beseech the silunus

contorted dance of flesh
indulgence of excess
they lie within a trance
sacrificing innocence

visions of the dark taking over
they canât be saved, Samaritan
futile, are the prayers of the sister
the left hand path has chosen them

with this bond we shall always be
our evil lives on eternally
if one is torn away, avenge
we shall show no mercy, repent

bow down before your Gods
the new angels of light
