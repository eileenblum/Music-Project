this is what the devil does
fulfills desires
now feel the warm embrace
from the kingdom of fire

the sacred adversary
no longer denied
a promise that we have sworn to you
to bring down the sky

we made a pact
sealed it with our blood
father, we made a pact
now the deed is done

you call yourself blessed
and deny the presence of the dark
you worship death
I worship life

I call the lord of earth
to curse this holy place
come forth from the abyss
strike down this sacred space
