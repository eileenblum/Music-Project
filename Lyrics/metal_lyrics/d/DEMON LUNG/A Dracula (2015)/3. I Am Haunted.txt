I hear their call
out from the past
I recognize
its tortured cry

you know weâve been
been here before
we can always be
instead of dust

donât be afraid
deathâs not the end
I live in you
would you die for me?

my body is a graveyard
and I am haunted

innocence is a blessing
easily tarnished
impossible to maintain
slips right through your fingers

I was once wounded here
and very near dying
if it pleases you my dear
we can go together

my body is a graveyard
and I am haunted

by the black of the night
and the bend of the trees
their boughs will crack
when we sleep beneath

if you are afraid
to bleed for our love
let us swear by the grave
the shelter of our souls

avoid the moans, give me your time
what we swear is not of light
for we will die, in the marsh
beyond the grove

it feels so cold and awful here
but I know I am back
the meadows we leave behind
we will die together
