once of beauty, now she sleeps
in a coffin of blood
rises now to bleed the world
raped by the serpent
now the Babylon whore
Dracula of the convent
a tormented disgrace
blackened by the flames

rip the throats of the pure at heart
turned into the phantomâs shadow
scratching eyes, happiness derailed
this love brings death

curse these words
I speak unto you
one by one
they fall to a scream

oh hear how they burn
tears of vile and black
no one is spared
their lives are cast away

together they ripped out their eyes
for the times that they looked away
tore out the tongues from their mouths
for each time that they spoke her name

they snatched the hearts from their chests
for trying to destroy love
removed the hands from their arms
for the times that they prayed to god

nevermore to feel the pain
their hearts connect like fire
