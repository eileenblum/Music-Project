It is known as the Devil's Wind
This wind of 300 years
The evil is magnified
In the eye of the storm

Arrival
Behold the new world
Preying on the minds of the weak
I will slaughter them in time

The ring is mine
The blood from a sinner

Now guidance I seek 
To the book of leather bound 
Could this somehow be the year?
Three centuries Iâve lost

It is known as the Devil's Wind
This wind of 300 years
The evil is magnified
In the eye of the storm

Oh ye people of a new day
Whether known or not
The dark will I show you all

Now what I seek is a path to follow
Will you see me now? 
Then see nothing at all
