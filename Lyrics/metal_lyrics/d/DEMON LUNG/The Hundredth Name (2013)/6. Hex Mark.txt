Barn engraved
Symbolic Sign
Wards off evil
That slithers inside

Abandon hope
When skies grow dark
The Devilâs trespass
On a frail hex mark

Show me your fear
Tis the air I breathe
For you have what I seek
Now taken from you

Pray, stop the carriage
Tell me your woes
Signs tell the clear
We are bewitched

The horse that sweats in morning
Sustenance sours overnight

We are marked with the hex
We are marked with the hex
