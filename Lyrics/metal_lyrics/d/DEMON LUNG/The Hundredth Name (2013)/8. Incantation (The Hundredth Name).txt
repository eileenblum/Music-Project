Pieced together time to remove
Backmasked was his name
A riddle has been reversed 
Now all is none

Pieced together time to remove
Backmasked was his name
A riddle has been reversed 
Now all is done

So I've come a century old
And I will bring the end of time
What you have you canât protect
Erase the face of existence

You know enough you cannot toy
Your legacy folds, tomorrow ends
Before it comes, hush your words 
And feast upon the witch fire

Pieced together time to remove
Backmasked was his name
A riddle has been reversed 
Now all is done

You have forced this pain on her
Now you must make a choice
Bring me the pages the torture
Will be removed until the end

And so it ends on unholy ground
Show yourself and the pages rest
End the torture of this girl
What you hold for what I hold

I am he of stillborn foal
I am he heart forged black
I am he the chosen son
Whose coming the stars have foretold
