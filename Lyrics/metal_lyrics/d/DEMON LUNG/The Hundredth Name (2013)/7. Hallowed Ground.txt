This place of eternal rot
The ground feels like my home
We shall lay you down here
In consecrated dust

The mark will show 
The final pages entombed
Relief when I see the hex
Now a horror so great

Here lies my bed
Giles, of the cloth
The body is dead, yet still I walk
My life is lost

Iâve spilled his blood 
The ground tells nothing
Writhing not, new tomb must be
Buried in unhallowed earth

The two were here, I know
I mean all harm, so heed my word
Now let you sit and talk of pages
Or be born of cold flesh

When we find the hex
By the smoke of the vane
But why do you hide this?
Where is my way

The vane spins one last time
Shall we end it now?
I will take her to hereafter
Shall you hand to me

Before the end
Fore the dawn of today
Complete the book
