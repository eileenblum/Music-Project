Ungodly Warlock, bound in chains
Send it back to hell
Bodies lie in the wake

The Blackened Book canât be destroyed
The answer lies in thirds
Separate the parts

Imprisonment, now death they bring
Once destroyed, now safe, or so they think

16 hundred 91

Hurry the hanging, stoke the flame
I can see the terror in their eyes

16 hundred 91

He's tracked me his last
Tomorrow will not take me 
For the storm boils 
The mark upon thine door fades
