A fatherâs arrogance
Seals a childâs fate
To believe in nothing
Has killed

Stripped from the child
The unbaptized fat
Cooked and consumed
The gift of flight

From this village i shall have my rite
Come here child and speak with me
You can give me strength be you not baptized
A thousand flights you bring to me

Ego sum unus
Ego sum potentia
Hoc esse tempus
Hoc est hora,
Aetheres et aves,
Supra caput meum.
Gravity iam solute
Dimitte me volare in caelum
Nunquam cadens
Nunquam timens

Why your absence, why not join?
Is your father not of faith?
He has made a grave mistake

I will take the fat for mine spell
The child burnt to a cinder
My journey now much quicker

Blame not, he suffers the loss
Unbelief has broken you both
Be not afraid of the dark
Now I shall take to the sky
