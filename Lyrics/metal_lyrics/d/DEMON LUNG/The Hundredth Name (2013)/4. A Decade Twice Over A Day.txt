Tout, Tout, through and about
Dismay
Rentum, Osculum
Torment
A decade twice over a day
A decade twice over a day

When worlds collide
Reality ends
Unfortunate time
For the son to appear

He takes weaknesses
And makes them your fears
Undeniable vanity
Dispensable years

Decades of slowly dying 
Advance to few days
The soulâs carriage now sinks
Beneath

An aging bodyâs shell
She can never escape
To break this wicked spell
Follow the page

Decades of slowly dying 
Advance to few days
The soulâs carriage now sinks
Beneath

So unfortunate
Marked by him
Morning Star

Know you this
It grows
To the end!

Tout, Tout, through and about
Dismay
Rentum, Osculum
Torment
A decade twice over a day
A decade twice over a day
