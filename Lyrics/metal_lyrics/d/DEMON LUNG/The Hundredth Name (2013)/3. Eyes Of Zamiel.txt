He is one of many names
I must speak with him now
Father, why have you sent me here?
I know there is a plan for me

My son, in this world I have 
Been forgotten with time
Make whole that which has been thriced
My bible: The Grand Grimoire

Take the eyes of the clairvoyant
Let them be your guide
Use each page to gain the strength
Assemble them and speak His name in reverse

Once gathered, complete
But what of reward?
For service to thee 
Will not fulfill

Only through me can you 
Undo creation
The one begotten 
Son of Satan

Do what I demand
The three parts together
Then you shall be him
IT SHALL BE ME!
