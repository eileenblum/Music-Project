"Hear our prayers Gods of Wrath,
Strike with swords of fire
Blood of man we've sacrificed
Genocide invoked"

[Riders:]
"You have given us power to rule
The power to take you away
Hatred our food the spilled blood our wine
You made sure that you fed us well

You've awaken us finally fools
And offered us eternal reign
Night and day we will turn into red
And as we are here we will stay"

"Hear our prayers Gods of Wrath,
Strike with swords of fire
Blood of man we've sacrificed
Genocide invoked"

[Goddess of Fate:]
"So you've chosen and so it may be
It finally comes to an end
Man has chosen his own destiny
In death you will now lay to rest"
