My loyal companion how I wish I could
run far away from your hand
but married we are and together we'll stay
til' Charon me offer a ride
Famine's your name and starvation you are
Your presence my body has leaved
Your weight on my shoulders I've carried through times
No mercy you've given to me

Starvation!!!
Hunger my consort!

Instinct of self-preservation my doom
No would I will inflict my self
The fear of the Reaper is equal your weight
I'm destined to carry your curse
Ny colleagues of famine through ages of time
all equal in your face we are
From Ukraine and China to southern black men
United in famine we stand

A slow walk upon the path towards the gate
a gate that's leadint to Styx. Leading to Styx.
I must walk with the weight of your bweing
upon my shoulders. Until the end. Until the end.

My loyal companion how I wish I could
run far away from your hand
but married we are and together we'll stay
til' Charon me offer a ride
Famine's your name and starvation you are
Your presence my body has leaved
Your weight on my shoulders I've carried through times
No mercy you've given to me

Starvation!!!
Starvation!!!
Hunger my consort!
