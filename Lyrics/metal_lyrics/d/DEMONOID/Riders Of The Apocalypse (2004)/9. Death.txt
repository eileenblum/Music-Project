I've spread my wings over earth
Embraced you all...
My kingdom come!

Eternal night, so still and dark,
Forever last...
This is my realm

I am Death - horseman the fourth
I am Death - striking you all
I am Death - there's no escape
I am Death - the Final One

Rich and poor equal at last
Young and old in death unite
The final age without end
A timeless void so cold and dark

Bellum - The finest of human arts
Fames - Our tragic curse
Lues - Medicine against us
Letum - Our final reward

War, some survived this madness and starved. 
But still some survived to get plague.
This ended mankind and death now dominates all.
