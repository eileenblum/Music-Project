Millions on the run
Fear in their eyes
Black Death pine for their lives,
Loves them to death
Nowhere left to escape
Embraced in the arms of the plague
Yersina Pestis penetrates all

Coughing up your lungs
Abscess suppurates
Your fluids clot inside your limbs
Finally the end
corpses all around
40 millions left to rot away

14th century plague
cure against mankind
14th century plague
deadly gift from the gods
