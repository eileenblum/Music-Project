Cancer humanity
Necrofertility
(The) gods sent the plague as a cure
Bloodsoaked infinity
Greed ruled endlessly
Welcome, the end of our times!

Await the final day
Rotten in fields we'll lay
Corse of the mankind soon fulfilled
For all our deeds we'll pay
and even though we may
regret our crimes, it is too late

Welcome, the end of our times

War - your blood was spilled
Starved - decreased mankind
Plague - the final strike
Death - Your emperor

Welcome. the end of our times
