Warbirds, fills the skies (and)
release their seeds of anger
Millions on the march,
when east and west collide
Fatal genocides invoke the global terror
No man can deny all sides share the guilt

The smoke fills the skies
this incense of war
No one can deny
what gods we adore
Rage and fury
millions flee outcome doesn't matter
gods of war in worship
we plant your seeds of hate
Murder, slaughter, millions raped
eastern works of terror
'Death and Glory' myth's revealed
honour and pride breeds hate

Wargods, hear us pray
glory to the brave
millions sacrificed
praise the church of war
preachers, of the faith calling for the mass
begin ceremony, our sacraments are blood

Wargods!
We practice what you preach!
Wargods!
Waaar!
Wargods!
We practice what you preach!
Wargods!
Waaar!

The Bloodred Sky's reflecting our rage
Dominion of terror prevail
Insanity has ravaged our minds
Attempting to slaughter mankind

The memory haunting the survivors...
a morbid vision to bare in mind
A field covered with bodies, loose limbs and pools of blood,
The stench of death being too much even for the vultures.

The smoke fills the skies
this incense of war
No one can deny
what gods we adore
