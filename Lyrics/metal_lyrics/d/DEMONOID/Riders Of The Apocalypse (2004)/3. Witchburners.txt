Murders in the name of Christ
A heavy guilt upon mankinds shoulders
Genocide, torture and rape
Jehovas name blessed with blood
Bad seeds only wicked will breed
Inspirations came from the Holy Bible
The centuries of this organized kill
spewed out from morbid religions

WITCH!
Tortured to confess
WITCH!
In flames you were burnt
WITCH!
Your innocent blood
WITCH!
By christians was spilled

Church of Christ forever marked
Your people all to be doomed
By joining you inheritage guilt
May it way hard on your shoulders
You await the Final Day
Sinners to burn in Purgatory
You'll be surprised who will burn
Souldiers of Christ, now it is your time to burn

WITCH!
Tortured to confess
WITCH!
In flames you were burnt
WITCH!
Your innocent blood
WITCH!
By christians was spilled
