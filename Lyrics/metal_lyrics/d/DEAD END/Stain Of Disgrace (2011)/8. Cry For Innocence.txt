Wake up to reality
Your sin just makes me laugh
Grown up with insanity
Rip off the binds that make you half

Would be better if you just died
(Died)
If you can not stop that cry
A cry for innocence
Lies are fogging your eyesight
(Sight)
Raise your hands to start a fight
This endless war for vengeance

[Chorus:]
See how the sight of the world is hollow
Just bite the hand that's feeding you
Don't give in, find a way
Wait for the moment you feel it too
Give a pray for another day
Another day

A cry for innocence

Pulled down by mortality
Rewarded somewhere in time
Disgraced with vitality
By letting you think that it will last

Would be better if you just died
(Died)
If you can not stop that cry
A cry for innocence

[Spoken:]
You have to choose your way
There is no escape from the road
That is leading you to pay
See how the sight of the world is hollow

[Chorus:]
See how the sight of the world is hollow
Just bite the hand that's feeding you
Don't give in, find a way
Wait for the moment you feel it too
Give a pray for another day

[Chorus:]
Just bite the hand that's feeding you
Don't give in, find a way
Wait for the moment you feel it too
Give a pray for another day

Start a war, start a fight
Make 'em fall, make it right
Kill 'em all
(Kill 'em all, kill 'em all)
Wake up to reality
Your sin just makes me laugh

Start a war, start a fight
Make 'em fall, make it right
Kill 'em all
(Kill 'em all, kill 'em all)
Grown up with insanity
Rip off the binds that make you half

Start a war, start a fight
Make 'em fall, make it right
Kill 'em all
(Kill 'em all, kill 'em all)
That's just a cry for innocence

That's just a cry
A cry for innocence
That's just a cry
A cry for innocence
