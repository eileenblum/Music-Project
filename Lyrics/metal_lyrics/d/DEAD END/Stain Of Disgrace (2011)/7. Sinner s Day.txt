Can you see it
A price of lying
Hate of God
Now you're dying
You can't see the sun
You can't see the day
Your rueful life is fading away today

There is nothing left to do
There is nothing left for you
There is nothing left to see
There is nothing left to believe
There is nothing which is real
(There is nothing which is real)

[Chorus:]
It's today a sinner's day
Get down on your knees and pray
Black and white fades to grey
It's today and you're on your own
There is no one left to blame
It's time to pay for all of your mistakes

There is no bad
There is no good
Just a cause of actions and brotherhood
Deal with it or don't
But it's coming your way
It's your last day and you hear me say

There is nothing left to do
There is nothing left for you
There is nothing left to see
There is nothing left to believe
There is nothing which is real
(There is nothing which is real)

[Chorus:]
It's today a sinner's day
Get down on your knees and pray
Black and white fades to grey
It's today and you're on your own
There is no one left to blame
It's time to pay for all of your mistakes

It's like an eye for an eye
Don't hide behind your lies
Back to the days you knew your moves
You remember the rules

Now it's late to regret
There are no chances left
You have done your last choice
But I can't hear your voice

[Chorus:]
It's today a sinner's day
Get down on your knees and pray
Black and white fades to grey
It's today and you're on your own
There is no one left to blame
It's time to pay for all of your mistakes

[Chorus:]
It's today a sinner's day
(A sinner's day)
Get down on your knees and pray
Black and white fades to grey
(Fades to grey)
It's today and you're on your own
(And you're on your own)
There is no one left to blame
It's time to pay for all of your mistakes
