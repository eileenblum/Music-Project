It's crawling in, never getting out
Like a cancer which spreads inside
Never count on luck, never trust the faith
I check another side then I choose my way
I try to control it and it's getting worse
Like a taste of fear before it bursts
Taking hold of me, never let's me go
It's just a cruel start of this show

It tells that this is the end
But it happens again
How can it ask for more
Though it reached the core
It smothers my last words
Doesn't care how it hurts
When I die inside
But that's the fate
My fate

It's my fate
That's slowly drowning me
It's my fate
That's surely killing me

It's written to my hands you see
The cursed line that's leading me
To my bitter end, there's no other way
Itâs not the death, just the agony
Itâs sitting there laughing at me
And what it sees, sinner's destiny
Letter of damned, drawn with fresh blood
Here upon me, tells me to rot

It tells that this is the end
But it happens again
How can it ask for more
Though it reached the core
It smothers my last words
Doesn't care how it hurts
When I die inside
But that's the fate
My fate

It's shutting my mouth but I can scream
I am awake but it feels like a dream
Distressed life has weighted me down
Lived life seems so meaningless now

It's my fate
It tells that this is the end
It's my fate
It's slowly drowning me
(How can it ask for more)

It's my fate
It smothers my last words
It's my fate
That's surely killing me
(When I die inside)

It's my fate
It tells that this is the end
It's my fate
It's slowly drowning me
(How can it ask for more)

It's my fate
It smothers my last words
It's my fate
That's surely killing me
(When I die inside
