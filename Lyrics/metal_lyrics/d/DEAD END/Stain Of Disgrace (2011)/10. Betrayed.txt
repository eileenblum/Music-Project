Black clouds fill the sky above
Day has turned to night
Hope has betrayed me again
All fears become alive

Rain tries to wipe despair away
But it buries me deeper in
I choose this path of my own
Any other way back is the one
That's killing me

Blinded by this empty reality
Guided by my burned soul
Still filled by hostility
This life is ruined by sorrow

[Chorus:]
These dreams keep on haunting me
And they keep me so tight
Doesn't let me live
Doesn't let me die

[Chorus:]
These dreams keep on haunting me
And they keep me so tight
Doesn't let me live
Doesn't let me die
Let me die

Voice of silence is folding me
Sadness makes me blind
Disease of mortality has cripled my eyesight
There will be no unforgiveness
Salvation denied
Just the lack of my time
Is reminding me
That any way I choose
It's killing me

Blinded by this empty reality
Guided by my burned soul
Still filled by hostility
This life is ruined by sorrow

[Chorus:]
These dreams keep on haunting me
And they keep me so tight
Doesn't let me live
Doesn't let me die

[Chorus:]
These dreams keep on haunting me
And they keep me so tight
Doesn't let me live
Doesn't let me die

[Whispered:]
Rejected by the light
Hollow was her soul
Blood turned cold
Unknown path
Rode she with halo of secrecy

Rejected by the light
Hollow was her soul
Blood turned cold
Hopeless was the heart of betrayed

[Chorus:]
These dreams keep on haunting me
And they keep me so tight
Doesn't let me live
Doesn't let me die

[Chorus:]
These dreams keep on haunting me
And they keep me so tight
Doesn't let me live
Doesn't let me die

[Chorus:]
These dreams
(These dreams)
Keep on haunting me
(Keep on haunting me)
And they keep me so tight
(Doesn't let me live)
Doesn't let me live
Doesn't let me die

[Chorus:]
These dreams
(These dreams)
Keep on haunting me
(Keep on haunting me)
And they keep me so tight
(Doesn't let me live)
Doesn't let me live
Doesn't let me die
