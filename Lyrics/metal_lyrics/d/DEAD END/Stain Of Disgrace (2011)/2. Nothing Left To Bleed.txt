Nature judgement, execution
From pain and torment to mass destruction
And you're alone
You're on your own

And you're alone
You're on your own

Symmetric chaos
Devastation
Ultra violent has painted our future
But you're alone
You're on your own

But you're alone
You're on your own

[Chorus:]
What we left behind is written to scars
Our filthy wounds will be open and sore
Until there is nothing left to bleed

[Chorus:]
What we left behind is written to scars
Our filthy wounds will be open and sore
Until there is nothing left to bleed
Nothing left to bleed

This has to be my destiny
I can't see any purity
There is no peace nor justice

Six bullets without an empty slot
Greed is a gun and the nation is the shot
And now it's done, all hope is gone
And now it's done, all hope is gone

Under pressure breaks a hardest soul
Keep care of your life
I'll keep care of my own
Because now it's done, all hope is gone
(Because now it's done, all hope is gone)
Because now it's done, all hope is gone

[Chorus:]
What we left behind is written to scars
Our filthy wounds will be open and sore
Until there is nothing left to bleed

[Chorus:]
What we left behind is written to scars
Our filthy wounds will be open and sore
Until there is nothing left to bleed
Until there is nothing left to bleed

[Chorus:]
What we left behind is written to scars
Our filthy wounds will be open and sore
Until there is nothing left to bleed
Until there is nothing left to bleed

[Chorus:]
What we left behind is written to scars
Our filthy wounds will be open and sore
Until there is nothing left to bleed
