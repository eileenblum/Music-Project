Naow

Now it has begun
Erase and refund
You'll be facing me as your enemy
One more shot, one more kill
One addiction to fulfill
Your despair means nothing to me

Scene of fear just makes it justified
Praise not the value of
Meaningless human life

[Chorus:]
Time of fear
This will be the end
Time of fear
It's better to pretend
Time of fear
Another day will come
Time of fear
And make your sins undone

Crossed the line of a man to become a god
Torched the bridges and started a flood
One more day, one more dawn
One last night to stand alone
Your despair means nothing to me
Nothing to me

[Chorus:]
Time of fear
This will be the end
Time of fear
It's better to pretend
Time of fear
Another day will come
Time of fear
And make your sins undone

[Spoken:]
Welcome to the black parade
Of sorrow led by hate
Walking through the darkness
To the silent fields of genocide

[Chorus:]
Time of fear
This will be the end
Time of fear
It's better to pretend
Time of fear
Another day will come
Time of fear
And make your sins undone
