You tell a lie, that's disrespect
You take a life, I will protect
Eye for an eye, that is correct
You take what's mine
You're my target

You are scum and have no value in my eyes
You've got no idea how much I do despise
I would not shed a tear
If all of you should die
It would be a relief to us all you can't deny

Dead unite
Today it's your turn
You take control and let your fire burn

Dead unite
Today it's your turn
You take control and let your fire burn

You represent the kind that we reject
You persuade the ones that we neclegt
You despite the fact it will reflect
Spreading, expanding, it will infect

You are scum and have no value in my eyes
You've got no idea how much I do despise
I would not shed a tear
If all of you should die
It would be a relief to us all you can't deny

Dead unite
Today it's your turn
You take control and let your fire burn

Dead unite
Today it's your turn
You take control and let your fire burn

This stain of disgrace won't fade away
These wound are so deep they will remain
Scars for lifetime
This burden of sin is withering
These ropes of deceit, they burn the skin
Piercing, choking

[X4:]
Dead unite
Today it's your turn
You take control and let your fire burn
