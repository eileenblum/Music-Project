Like autumn leaves drop one by one
A part of life is gone
A little trip is done
Your empty gaze looked through my eyes
Why you had to die
No one can tell me why
This yearning brings me down

[Chorus:]
You walk a path of shattered dreams
Sorrow leads your feet
You drift away from reality
In a sea of eternity

Deadly wind against us yells its evil curse
Freezing rain can not make it worse
Maybe everything is how it's meant to be
No one gets more than is able to carry
This anger brings me down

[Chorus:]
You walk a path of shattered dreams
Sorrow leads your feet
You drift away from reality
In a sea of eternity
It's time to spread your wings and fly
Rise from human's cry
Yet everything goes to an end
Death unites again

Why you still keep on
Keep hurting me
Why you just can't keep
Can't keep on waiting
Everything keeps on
Keeps on reminding me
Why you still keep on
Keep on hurting me

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
You walk a path of shattered dreams
Sorrow leads your feet
You drift away from reality
In a sea of eternity
It's time to spread your wings and fly
Rise from human's cry
Yet everything goes to an end
Death unites again
