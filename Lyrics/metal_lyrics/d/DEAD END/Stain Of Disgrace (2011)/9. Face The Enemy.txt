Face the enemy

Hold your breath and what you see
The end is near and it's so real
That you can feel the taste of death
And weight of all sins on your neck
Your bloody flesh is here to stay
Trying to find a better way
To live this life to the bitter end
Wrong choices front of these ways

Face the enemy
Face the enemy
Face the enemy
Face the fact, hey
Face the enemy

The world is dead don't ask me why
Generations die but you don't mind
Living this life day by day
Make you trust everything is ok
Closing your eyes is not a solution
Waiting just a self-destruction
You can take the action and start to fight
Or swallow all shit that they have lied

Face the enemy
Face the enemy
Face the enemy
Face the fact, hey
Face the enemy

Blinded eyes
(Blinded eyes)
Can never see the truth
Living a lie
(Living a lie)
Doesn't make it true
Standing here
(Standing here)
I have lost my faith
I have grown
(I have grown)
I'm now stronger than hate
I'm now stronger than hate
I'm now stronger than hate

You can see it
You can read it
You can dream it
But you never did it
You can taste it
You can smell it
You can hear it
But you never believe it
Trust it, feel it, hold it
Why you never did it
Sense it, touch it
Face the fact, hey
Face the enemy

Blinded eyes
(Blinded eyes)
Can never see the truth
Living a lie
(Living a lie)
Doesn't make it true
Standing here
(Standing here)
I have lost my faith
I have grown
(I have grown)
I'm now stronger than hate

Blinded eyes
(Blinded eyes)
Can never see the truth
Living a lie
(Living a lie)
Doesn't make it true
Standing here
(Standing here)
I have lost my faith
I have grown
(I have grown)
I'm now stronger than hate
I'm now stronger than hate
I'm now stronger than hate
