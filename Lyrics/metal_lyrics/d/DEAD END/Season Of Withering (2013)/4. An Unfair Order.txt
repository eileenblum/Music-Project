Remembrance is all I have left
I need to be proud but I am bereft
Every route has its dead end
May this one be mine from depths to ascend

Empty months follow each other
Like a night is chasing the day
Intimates surround and bother
But everything just stays the same

Balanced with pain and pleasure
Feeling between life and death
Determined with pills and measure
Killed in an unfair order

[Chorus:]
Scared to face the dark and blindness
Is it worse that I can't hear in this silence
Is it the darkness that I fear
Or that blindness overcomes
There's nothing left to feel
We're empty inside

I can't swallow all your solace
Dying here without the grace
Nothing can help us anymore
There's no task for me to live for

When the sun rises and night has gone
You will know that I am done
I have gone through the shadows
To the deepest place so hollow

Balanced with pain and pleasure
Feeling between life and death
Determined with pills and measure
Killed in an unfair order

[Chorus:]
Scared to face the dark and blindness
Is it worse that I can't hear in this silence
Is it the darkness that I fear
Or that blindness overcomes
There's nothing left to feel
We're empty inside

[X3:]
Empty inside

[Chorus:]
Scared to face the dark and blindness
Is it worse that I can't hear in this silence
Is it the darkness that I fear
Or that blindness overcomes
There's nothing left to feel
We're empty inside

[X3:]
Empty inside
