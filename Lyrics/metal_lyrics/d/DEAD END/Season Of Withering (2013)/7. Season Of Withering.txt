We failed

Look at the nation
What can you see
Colossal scars
You have to agree
Satellites reflect disorder
Confusion and murder

Who would teach me the wrong and the right
When surrounded by people ready to bite
Politics full of lies can't answer
With their face disguised

We failed
We failed

Forthcoming times can't give us much
But another Midas with a golden touch
Corrupted bank without the real assets
Feeding the beast of greed

[Chorus:]
Season of withering
Help me
It's defiling me, it's raping me
Season of withering
Help me
It's smashing me, drowning me
We, we failed

We failed

Faults always result in actions
Actions have an effect
Effect lead to resistance
Resistance and revenge

See the sky with the chemical trails
Government takes care, takes care of the bails
Was 9-1-1 just a cheap and priceless trick
All these doubts make me sick

[Chorus:]
Season of withering
Help me
It's defiling me, it's raping me
Season of withering
Help me
It's smashing me, drowning me
We, we failed

A trivial turn to make it
Better just burn it down
When the fire is gone and the dust is set
You'll feel the silence and get to rest

[Chorus:]
Season of withering
Help me
It's defiling me, it's raping me
Season of withering
Help me
It's smashing me, drowning me
We...

[Chorus:]
Season of withering
Help me
It's defiling me, it's raping me
Season of withering
Help me
It's smashing me, drowning me
We, we failed
