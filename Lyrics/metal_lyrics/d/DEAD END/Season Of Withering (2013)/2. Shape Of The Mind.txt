Can you understand the shape of the mind?
Thoughts tortured with obsession
Of a weirdest kind
The pulse of a heart is fading away
Heading to an era of dismembered
Influence is lethal, incurable, long searing
It's the pleasure of my slow decay

I follow
Guide my way
Out of here
Somewhere else

Under the pressure the mind will break
Your thoughts in pieces or you just can't take
Can you remember what history has taught?
Chaos reigns on every state they've reached
Murder, mayhem, chaos
It's the pleasure of my slow decay

One way to go
When it called I looked back
And knew my soul would never return

I follow
Guide my way
Out of here
Somewhere else

This is the time for the cleansing rain
That erases these crimes away
Sick minds that caused the pollution
Ready for new evolution

One way to go
When it called I looked back
And knew my soul would never return

I follow
Guide my way
Out of here
Somewhere else
