Never felt this much alive
All this struggling stimulates me
Now I need to keep this up
Not to resist might just be the key

Everyday's the same
Stronger than the pain
Come on give me more
Nothing affects me anymore
I'm insatiable
I have to find it out
Could I find a cure

[Chorus X2:]
Sands of time run out
Please forgive me
Lay me down to sleep
This darkness takes care of me

All the broken promises
They were too good to be true
Misery and agony never leave me thanks to you
Life has been too kind for me
It is time to set things straight
No more love and happiness
They are both just excess weight

Regular adversities
Maintain my interests
A day without the suffering
Would be the ultimate test

Everyday's the same
Stronger than the pain
Come on give me more
Nothing affects me anymore
I'm insatiable
I have to find it out
Could I find a cure

[Chorus X2:]
Sands of time run out
Please forgive me
Lay me down to sleep
This darkness takes care of me

They receive an evil seed
Without even knowing it
You feed it with anger
You fill it, fill it with your thoughts
It's rooted
Growing stronger than the hand that feeds
The route is determined
Stable, smooth, unstoppable
An evil seed
An evil seed
You fill it
You fill it with your thoughts

[Chorus X2:]
Sands of time run out
Please forgive me
Lay me down to sleep
This darkness takes care of me
