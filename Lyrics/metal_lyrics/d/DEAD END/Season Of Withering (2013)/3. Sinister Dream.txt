Did not see this come
I realized what have I become
Until we part our ways
No more tears running down my face

No time for goodbyes
I've got to break up these ties
Give it up
Rest in peace
No need to forgive my deeds

Tough times
Fear and loath
Love and hate between us both
There's only so much I can bend
My spine will break in the end

Last drop of my soul
Broke out of your control
No more you can hold me here
Just watch me disappear

Tell me the truth
No more lies
Reality
Claiming its prize

[Chorus:]
Fading away
Lost in a sinister dream
Beyond the reach
Preparing to die

All the light is gone
My deeds can't be undone
Your heart is so hollow
There is no left to follow

Gone blind, lost my sight
Lost all the options to win this fight
Cancel this endless war
From surface to the core

Tell me the truth
No more lies
Reality
Claiming its prize

[Chorus:]
Fading away
Lost in a sinister dream
Beyond the reach
Preparing to die

This darkness is so silent
Still feeling this coldness on my skin
Still I feel this coldness on my skin
I'm sitting here all alone
Knowing someone's gazing at me
I feel someone is gazing at me
The black water in my veins
Eyes dazed
Paralyzed
Eyes dazed
Paralyzed

[Chorus:]
Fading away
Lost in a sinister dream
Beyond the reach
Preparing to die

[Chorus:]
Fading away
Lost in a sinister dream
Beyond the reach
Preparing to
(Preparing to die)
