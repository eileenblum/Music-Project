[Music: Teske / Gruber; Lyrics: Keller / Teske]

Duplicating human cruelty
By order of the higher science
The outcome of their greed
To be the sovereign of all threats

Overestimated intellect
Turns against them
As they realize having
Created their own hell

No spheres not to be affected
The centre of all breathing
Cause of all being's essential diversity
Evolution's instrumentation

Man's interruption
Inquiry's insatiability
Genetic engineering.
New possibilities came forth
Creatures built for immortality
Emancipation of torture
Experiments of the absurd

Human dignity, reduced to misery
Holocausting all eternity to
Defeat our last remaining sanity..
