[Music: Gruber / Lyrics: Keller]

Their blast inside
Devouring offals
The clot of blood in
My veins... Eliminating

Preventing any neurological orders
To their contentment to act
To their world to adapt
To their hell to descent

Captivated in the wake of moral decadence
Deprived inner sublimity
Hallucinations determing perceptive faculty

Neuralgia corroding inner stamina
I pass through the lifelessness
Into the void I'm falling...
Towards my hell I'm soaring

Fictious illusions merge with
the Dreariness of reality
Through the mist I'm staring
At the remains of our race

Central limbic system
closest to behaviour
Affected. Disabled. Eliminated

Substituted by cruelty
Guided by licentiousness
New Dimension of Annihilation... Now Born

Disfigured bodies creeping through the
Putrifying flesh of their fellows
The state of flesh adjusted to their minds
Their beast, their enemy, their fall...

Liquifying Cerebral Hemispheres
