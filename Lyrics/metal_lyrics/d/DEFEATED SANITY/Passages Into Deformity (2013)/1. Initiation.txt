HUNGER - "A condition characterised by possessiveness and insatialbe desires which govern one's actions"

[Music: Gruber, Lyrics: Gruber/LÃ¼hring]

Bardo of becoming
A state of unrest
Astral body
Beholding lustful impulses
Incestuous selection
A fragile host
Possessed by
The insatiable
Catapulted into another existence
Re-creating the previous shape
Distinctive features regenerating
Mind already saturated by elitism
Endless cycle
Of immortal energy
Taking on
Mortal form
Physically defined
Mentally immature
Blinding its victims
To achieve- dominance
Forged in the flames of limbo
Vile reiterating energies
To dim the utopia of peacefulness
[Repeat]

Earthly existence confined in Samsara
Endless cycle
Of immortal energy
Taking on
Mortal form
Physically defined
Mentally immature
Blinding its victims
To gain - control
