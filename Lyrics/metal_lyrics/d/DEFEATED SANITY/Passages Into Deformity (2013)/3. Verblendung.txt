ANIMALITY - "It is the nature of beasts to threaten the weak and fear the strong."

[Music: Gruber/Schmidt, Lyrics: Gruber]

Thrown into this world of filth
Subject to hostility
Temptation lurks the void
(Of) a lacerated soul
Mistrust and disarray
Growing stronger everyday
Destructive ego takes control
As the Viciousness is creeping into the self-centered mind
Twisted creatures â poisoning,
Inbred habits â disseminate,
Virtues, morality â mortify
A hopeless world consumed with rivalry

Engraved deep inside, a mindset broadly accepted
Maladjusted, small doses of perversion
Vile influences obscuring the path to purity and reason
Animality takes over.

Blinded by impurity, a slave to earthly fray
Cannot liberate myself, forever bound to these chains
Condemned to live a life of longing until I die
[Repeat]

Developed deep inside, a process perceived asâ¦.. harmless,
Protection of the self, absorbing theâ¦. majority
Struggling to overcome the ones surrounding you
Yet bonded with your surroundings, a paradox that will poison your life

Brought about
By their
Own hands,
Environment turns into inferno
