ARROGANCE - "None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free"

[Music: Gruber/KÃ¼hn/Schmidt, Lyrics: Gruber]

Realisation of
Intellectual advantage
Urge to rise above all
Drain their life's blood
Selfish ego flourishes
In an opponent's defeat
Immersed in elitism
Rivals erased from the face of the earth
Or molded into useful tools
Profiting from their weakness
Eliminating competition
Ruthlessly gaining authority
Resistance withering
Conviction of complete sublimity
Imprinted into the wicked mind
Scruple buried deep inside
Morbid
Elation
Rejoicing in
Destructivity
Apathy -
A blockade
To prevent oneself
From giving in
A blind being
Unable to escape
From this realm
Of arrogance and jealousy
A latent sting, un-definable
Clouding the joys of existence
[Repeat]

Awe and antipathy
Emerging from those conquered
Catapulted into
A state of isolation
Anger replaces grief
Morally desensitized
Absence of compassion
Illusion of happiness
Existence defined by status and prosperity
Profiting from their weakness
Eliminating competition
Ruthlessly gaining authority
Resistance withering
Conviction of complete sublimity
Imprinted into the wicked mind
Scruple buried deep inside
