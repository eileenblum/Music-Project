[Music: Gruber/KÃ¼hn, Lyrics: Gruber]

A degenerate relation to nature
Unseen paradox, hypocrisy silently imprinted
Morbidity trivialised, belittled
To keep themselves away from the horrendous reality
Immersed in carnivorous dependence

Cutting throats- A daily routine
Ripping out testicles- Unanesthetized
Scalded alive- A minor accident
Panic stricken, twitching headless, drowning in their own shit
Screaming, kicking, crammed together, half dead
Stomping on their own heads
From my actions
Thousands of tortured souls cease to be
My task to satisfy tongues that are poisoned by greed
I take upon me their guilt to indulge themselves in death
Mentally brutalized - A cold faÃ§ade conceals what's deep
Within - Mercy, compassion, respect for life
Species enslaved, bred to please the superior
Condemned - A short life of servitude
A pile of rancid flesh
Spillover of excruciating pain
Butchered in the name of luxury
Emotionless, I execute my duty
A dull life until fate strikes me down
Grave event - To crush my vitality
Sudden spiritual elevation
Drawn into an unknown state
Panic overtakes me as I
Look upon my physical self
Whirlwind of karma upon me
As my life rewinds before my eyes
Soaring further intoâ¦The unreal
Awakening - In a scene of lurid images
Visions - Creatures craving to retaliate
Fury - Clutches and fangs excoriate my flesh
Agony - Forced to feel what I have once inflicted
Transcending
The unearthly
Unforeseenâ¦
Release
From infernal claws tight around me
Returning to reality, Purged by netherworldly trial
Regaining consciousness, second life begins
Ethical transformation
Tranquilized by misery
Compassion thoroughly flows from within
To cast an altered view on all living beings
