HELL - "A state of perennial misery - breeding pestilence, utter squalor. Ignivomous abyss sprouted reddest spate.
A vision where death becomes absurd and life absurder. A bleak infinity where joy's ribbons have slipped.
A sublime condition of terror where the dross of transgression cascades from consciousness."

[Music: Gruber/KÃ¼hn/Teske, Lyrics: Gruber]

Cities oozing out disgust
Claustrophobic state of misanthropy
A source of calamity
Diversity breeds conflict, clashing individuals
Spiritual depravity
Tortured souls enduring the weight of karma
The presence of evil
Creating a violent compound

Minor grievance, sufficient to provoke aggression
Hatred is boiling, no room for compassion
Kill or be killed
Menace
Constant fear of attack
Density
Crushed by the weight of commitment
Oversaturated
With human contact
Confined
In a purgatory of unavoidable relations
Torrents of stress tampering with the vulnerable psyche
Essentials of existence, lost in confusion
Desperate attempts to numb the pain that's deep within, within
Pathological need for constant stimulation
Stimulationâ¦That will replace all natural forms of bliss
Intoxication will only aggravate the immense deformity
Substances providing false joy
Strong physical and mental dependence
Initiating a downward spiral
Innocence forever lost
Love transformed into perversion
Blackness wrapping around what once was pure
Sickening compulsion
Carnal insatiability
Brutalized instinct
Overshadowing all
The impulse to rape their women
And take their land
Bleeding incompetenceâ¦
To deal with inevitable dissonance
One's own infernoâ¦
Mistrust and bitterness prompting atrocious acts
