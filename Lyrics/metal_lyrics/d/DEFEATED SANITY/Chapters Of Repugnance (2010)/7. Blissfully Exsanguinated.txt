Delightfully dripping from above as I wallow in their warmth
Muffled sounds of anguish a sweet lullaby to me
Exsanguination - their youth now flows within me

A land of dismay
Daughters sold into servitude
Hundreds if desperate souls
Slaughtered with impunity

Lunatic in nobility
Intense fascination with the blood
(As) tragedy provokes fury
Cruelty becomes mass murder

Morbid odour - as they enter her lair
Dozens of corpses - stuffed in every vacant space
Mastication - missing large pieces of shoulders and neck
Disciplined, tormented, cannibalized, beaten to death

Their enquiries have unveiled the appalling truth
Brought about a judgment equally twisted
Accomplices, scapegoats who now take her blame
Fingers ripped out then immolated alive

While confined
In stone
Her existence will end
Left alone with a compulsion to torture
