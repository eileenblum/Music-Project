Wandering through hostile lands
A veil of confusion still controlling me
And the visions grow darker

Blood drinking demons come to dawn, ghastly faces, embodied anger
Human skulls, putrefying entrails decorate their flame-enhaloed form

Unearthly manifestations - The reflections of your mind
Psychedelic horror - Particles of discriminating wisdom
Wisdom shineth upon thee
So that you may transcend this fainting state

Recognize, merge with those abominations, conquer thine animalistic self
At one with wrath, know it to be the embodiment of thine own intellect

Cryptic instructions from the carnal world enter the mental ear
Through esoteric teachings, somehow comfort is found
Terror and awe create one pointed attention

[Solo: KÃ¼hn]

Tutelary deities
Appear before thee
Merge into them

Animal headed
Weapon wielding
Miscreations
Trust them as they were human acquaintances

Dissection
Disembowelment,
Cannot harm you, since you are bodiless

Emptiness cannot harm emptiness

Yama - Lord of death
Judge of sinister authority
Accumulated karma
Is evaluated
Judgement is inevitable
Surrender to thine inner sublimity

Do not attempt escape
A fall into the unhappy worlds
Will result
Thou will be
Trapped inside hostile lands -
Veil of confusion â Timeless suffering

Unearthly manifestations - The reflections of your mind
Psychedelic horror - Particles of discriminating wisdom
Wisdom shineth upon thee
So that you may transcend this fainting state

Recognize, merge with those abominations, conquer thine animalistic self
At one with wrath, know it to be the embodiment of thine own intellect
