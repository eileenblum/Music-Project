Stripped of my material body, spirit travels
Boundless liberty, visiting places
Approaching my loved ones, people I cherish
Left with no reply as I'm trying to reach out

Seeing relatives weeping
Now certain, I have died

I can look upon my mortal vessel
A shroud of despair engulfs me
Trapped within another dimension
Forced to abandon my earthly existence

Once again I hear the voices call my name, blessed by their existence

"O nobly-born being, oppressed with intense sorrow, the thought will occur to thee, 'O what would I not give to possess a body!"

Dharma-Kaya, abide in unattachment, devoid of weakness
Tranquility, in this uncreated state thou will gain perfect enlightenment and birth will be obstructed

"O nobly-born, (at this time) thou wilt see visions of males and females in union.
When thou seest them, remember to withhold thyself from going between them."

Lust and aggression
Asphyxiate me, unable to resist
Whirlwind of impurities
Familiar patterns of Samsara

Hatred and envy
Struggling with sexual rivalry
Sinful desire
Wallowing in emotions

Do not enter the womb!
Become one with bliss!
Escape the endless cycle of suffering!

Dharma-Kaya, abide in unattachment, devoid of weakness
Tranquility, in this uncreated state thou will gain perfect enlightenment and birth will be obstructed

Lust and aggression
Asphyxiate me, unable to resist
Whirlwind of impurities
Familiar patterns of Samsara

Entering the womb
Thou will be propelled to repeat the endless cycle of suffering!
