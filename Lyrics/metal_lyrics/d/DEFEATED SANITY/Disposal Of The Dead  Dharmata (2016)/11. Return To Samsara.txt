Thou did not recognize
Luminosity of thine mind
Absorbed in impurities
Familiar patterns take their course

Tormenting furies
Compelled to push on
Through terrifying hail-storms
Darkness, snow and rain

"O nobly-born, do not seek refuge in the womb!"

Visions of thine future existence will arise
Caverns and blossoms will appear to thee, avoid to hide inside
For they ate the womb
Passage into another painful reality

Flesh eating demons
Ghosts of those forever lost in this intermediate state
Haunt me, paralyzed with horror

Ridden with sorrow of loosing my past life
Feeling drawn
Towards the realm of pleasure and pain

"Anxiety and despair will take hold of thine fate"

Visualize thy tutelary deity
Massive limbs, terrifying appearance
Possessing the might to reduce to dust the legions of mischievous spirits

The power of its grace will separate thee from the tormenting furies and thou will wilt obtain ability to select the womb-door you desire
In deep faith, heed this profound teaching

The power of its grace will separate thee from the tormenting furies and thou will wilt obtain ability to select the womb-door you desire
In deep faith, heed this profound teaching

Hiding in my place of refuge
To escape the horrors of the Bardo
Hearing the sounds of immensity
From outside my resort

I shall never return to that hostile plane
Longing for existence like it used to be
Gravitated towards Samsara
Thou will faint away into unconsciousness

Womb-door opens, conciousness resets
Seeing the light of day, cycle is complete
Slave to ignorance and attachment
Yet another lifetime to accumulate wisdom

[Solo: KÃ¼hn; Gruber]

Visions of thine future existence will arise
Caverns and blossoms will appear to thee, avoid to hide inside
For they ate the womb
Passage into another painful reality
