Awakening from this swoon
Extracted from my mortal shell
Trapped within the unknown
Subjected to the netherworld

Visions, intimidating powers appear
Glorious orbs of lights
Emitting rays of unbearable radiance

Divine figures embracing each other
Casting glances, both morbid and inviting
Torn between terror and affection
Whirlwind of impressions
Lurid, glaring colors
Violent sounds

From thy own self comes this immensity
Rays of grace forming frightful entities

Paralyzing luminosity
When confronted with the deities
Awful bliss will strike against thee
Do not fear the light, let it enter you, free of attachment
Know it to be wisdom, guiding the pathway to liberty

[Solo: KÃ¼hn; Gruber; Schmidt; KÃ¼hn]

Distant prayers from the world of the living
Soaking in my conciousness
Intensifying my perplexity
Until I recognize my noble guides

"Oh, soul unprepared for the phenomena of the afterlife, listen undistractedly."

Chants of compassion and profound knowledge
An exalted voice instructing me in this dark realm of uncertainty, preparing me for things to come"

Paralyzing luminosity
When confronted with the deities
Awful bliss will strike against thee
Do not fear the light, let it enter you, free of attachment
Know it to be wisdom...

From thy own self comes this immensity
Rays of grace forming frightful entities
Karmic obscurations weaken the mind
Seeking escape will block the portal to enlightenment
