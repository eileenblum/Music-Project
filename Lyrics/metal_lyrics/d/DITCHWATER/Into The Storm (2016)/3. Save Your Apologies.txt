Wait, I've got something to say
Waited so long to put you back into your place

Why can't you see what you've done to me
Won't you please just let me be

Save your apologies
I don't need them no more

Hold onto what you have
Living just to live will kill you in the end

Why can't you see what you've done to me
Won't you please just let me be

Save your apologies
I don't need them no more

Fight for every step you take
No failure, no regret, no promises to make

Why can't you see what you've done to me
Won't you please just let me be

Save your apologies
I don't need them no more
