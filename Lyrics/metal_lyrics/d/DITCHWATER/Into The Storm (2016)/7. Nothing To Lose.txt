How is it that you see yourself
Blackened by this world you hate
Now you bury yourself so low
Try to stop it's too late

Noting to lose
Your far away from me
Nothing to lose
So far I can't see

Wasting for a taste
Of freedom you don't really have
Goddamn you lost again
And in your vanity you fall

Noting to lose
Your far away from me
Nothing to lose
So far I can't see

Giving is your only way
Giving into your weaknesses

Noting to lose
Your far away from me
Nothing to lose
So far I can't see
