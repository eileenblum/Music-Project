What motivates you my friend
I think I see your plan
To push me to the edge
On the edge of a short rope
You push my buttons and hope
That I will lose control

I cannot hear you but I know you're laughing
I cannot see you with the mocking smile that's on your face
If we ever meet, will be no doubt
That the first chance I get, knock the taste right out of your mouth

Is your life really that low
That you feel the need to go
And bring me down with you
Don't have the courage to face
Your empty life is waste
A waste of my time and space

I cannot hear you but I know you're laughing
I cannot see you with the mocking smile that's on your face
If we ever meet, will be no doubt
That the first chance I get, knock the taste right out of your mouth

Wasted all this time
Watched you cross the line
Time for you to fight
Pushed me way too far this time

It shouldn't get to me
'Cause I can easily see
That you mean nothing to me
You try to pull me in
A battle that I cannot win
I will not let it begin

I cannot hear you but I know you're laughing
I cannot see you with the mocking smile that's on your face
If we ever meet, will be no doubt
That the first chance I get, knock the taste right out of your mouth
