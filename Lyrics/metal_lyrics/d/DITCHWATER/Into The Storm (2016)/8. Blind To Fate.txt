Since opening eyes I was compelled
These words I'll speak one day
The seeds planted so far away
Blossom yet were contained
In this heart a book it reads
Allowed only in song

And you just condemned my only gift
Your blind with few days are left

Chained in life meant to fly
But never left the ground
You stood by and watched it all
And never showed me right
In this heart a book it reads
Allowed only in song

And you just condemned my only gift
Your blind with few days are left

In this heart a book it reads
Aloud a book it reads to you
All I see is what you left me
It's so empty like my life.

In this life I only wanted
A chance to make you proud
But you hold on to your resentment
Blind to your own child

And you just condemned my only gift
Your blind with few days are left
