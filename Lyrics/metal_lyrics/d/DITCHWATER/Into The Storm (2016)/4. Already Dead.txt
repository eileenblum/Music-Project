This pain I feel
To you is not real
Nothing I can say will make a difference anyway
No one to blame
For my past mistakes
Noway to erase your perception of me

Pull the trigger it goes all away
You only have myself to blame
Why am I always one step ahead of you

Please don't forget
Hold back all regret
This is something
I had to do for me and you
Can't get past this
Feeling of emptiness
You won't be missed
By anyone but me

Pull the trigger it goes all away
You only have myself to blame
Why am I always one step ahead of you
Pull the plug, push the needle in
I just committed your last sin
Close your eyes I'm already dead

Won't be long now
I'll see you soon
Don't pull away it's almost over

Pull the trigger it goes all away
You only have myself to blame
Why am I always one step ahead of you
Pull the plug, push the needle in
I just committed your last sin
Close your eyes I'm already dead
