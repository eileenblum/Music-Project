All my life
I've been searching for someone like you
In my dreams
Hand in hand we will always be

Every time I close my eyes
I see you looking back at me
Every time I close my eyes
I see you, I see you

In my mind
All I hear is the pain I caused
The same pain
Pain I cause myself never leaves

Every time I close my eyes
I see you looking back at me
Every time I close my eyes
I see you, I see you

In my dreams
All I hear is you
Cry at me
Set me free, set me free

Every time I close my eyes
I see you looking back at me
Every time I close my eyes
I see you, I see you

Every time I see what I am
When is all this, blood on my hands
All I can say is I'm not guilty alone
