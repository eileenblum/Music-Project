Been through too much to settle for less
This fire I hold won't burn me yet
A new day dawns and there's new hope
All this gray is all I hold

Break this spell
I ache everyday
Break this spell
Your hold is too great
...and I feel the light coming

I see your eyes as you pretend
To understand how I am
Now my eyes don't see so blind
I can see you've lost your mind

Break this spell
I ache everyday
Break this spell
Your hold is too great
...and I feel the weight shifting

Did you really think I would back down
And let you walk all over me
Did you think I'd stand aside
As you pretending to be real

Vacant stares replace the smiles
That once lived on your face
Now you've been defeated again
Do you know who I am

Break this spell
I ache everyday
Break this spell
Your hold is too great
...and I feel the light coming
