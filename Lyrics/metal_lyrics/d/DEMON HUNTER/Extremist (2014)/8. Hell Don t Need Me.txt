I donât wanna close my eyes
I canât tell if Iâm asleep or if Iâm blind

Weâre going nowhere
No one seems to care

I could sell a peace of mind
I could tell you every time that I divide

The water will decide
Where to feed me
Mother donât you cry
Hell donât need me

I will see it all in timeâ¨I canât be the only one across that line

Weâre going nowhere
No one seems to care

[Chorus]

Donât need me [4x]

[Chorus 2x]
