Time is wearing down my fight
My determination
Dividing in my head
This degeneration cull
It's my definiton
Recalling all I am
Where I begin

I could live my life for the void inside
To the vacant rise surrender mine
Forever divide

But I know
How the rest will go
And the line
That I live behind
Never hide
Never Compromise
Like Them
Everything I am
Is what I'm not

In my revelation
I can see it all clear
My enemy, my guide
Every idol I refuse
Every declaration
Becoming all I am
To my end
