These quiet words, they carry me away
Returning
They keep coming back
In idle thoughts and hollow cut-aways
Disarm me
No will to attack

Though the sorrow and fear they may depart you today

I will fail you
Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you
To the core

Lost in the shadow of an endless grace
Relentless
My reign is unbound
In this abandon I will devastate
Dismember
Till agonyâs found

Though the sorrow and fear they may depart you today

I will fail you
Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you
To the core

I know they prey upon me
I feel them just beyond my door

I will fail you
Of that I'm sure
I will remind you of the pain forevermore
And when my sins are just a memory
Faith restored
I will fail you
To the core
