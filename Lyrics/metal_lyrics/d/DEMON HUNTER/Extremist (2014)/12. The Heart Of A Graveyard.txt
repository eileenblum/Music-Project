Everything in time
Set your eyes upon the shallow surface
Hollow out your mind
How divine, you disengage your self

Tell me
Tell me of your consolation
Tell me
I am lost in the gray
Tell me that your final home is not aâ¦
A shot in the dark
Tell me that your hopes and dreams donât end in the heart

Of a graveyard

Set aside your soul
Let tomorrow realize itself

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Brace for the ending
You may not see
Will you stop descending
Six shallow feet

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
