Tell me your misery
Give us the antidote
I heard the voice of change
Behind a vacant note

All this tearing apart
Without a reform
Call it what you will
I'm not afraid to say

I've heard it all, connection lost
We're standing by, artificial light
You sell a fix for our defect
And all we find, artificial light

Doesn't break the model
I can't feel it in my bones
Nothing shattering my world
No...

We want a real cure
Not idle sympathy
The dark consuming light
That you have failed to be

No, it's not enough
I resent this deprivation
Your remedy is not a weapon
To slaughter the sorrow
It's just to keep you from feeling alone

I'll never see what they see in you
