I thought about you
I thought about the ones that I forget
Oh please forgive me
I hope that I've not pushed you to the edge

Let me wash away the painful words I wrote
We can smother out the flames within my soul
No more standing by the way that I believe
We can smother out the flames

With gasoline

You break around me
You say that I should give my heart a rest

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Weâll watch these flames
Like a tower of dissent, choking out regret
Devouring light
An image of my soul, out of our control

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
