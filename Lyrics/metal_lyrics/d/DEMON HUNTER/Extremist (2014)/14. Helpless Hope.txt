[Bonus Track]Now the soil takes your breath
Nothing left
Just bones and empty roads
And a want for something more
Open door
But careful not to ask

And holding fast

Now sorrow burns around you
Anger, fear and death surround you
So afraid
Helpless
Where is the void you're after?
Emptiness, the final chapter
So afraid
Helpless hope

To the hollow hands of fate
No escape
No panic, no reprieve
And the faith it was too blind
Too unkind
But faithful in the wholeness of

The hole itself

[Chorus]

Let go
Follow

[Chorus 2x]
