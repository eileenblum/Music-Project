[Bonus Track]This is not for the undecided
For the other side
We made our bed in the lionâs den
No place to hide
Rejected, refused
We were born to lose

Or were we born for a higher call
Those scattered few
[2x]

Sing

I made my vow and I swear
Take it to my grave
My grave
Will not regret to say
Before I fall away
Waste me
[2x]

We are not for the fate of this world
Disillusioned, damned
May not maintain our foothold
But know where we stand

We were born for a higher call
Those scattered few

Sing

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

This is not for the undecided
For the other side
