These are trying times
Made to break the heart wide
But we still defy
We will make the dead rise

We can't be silent
We can't belong
We have a promise
To die upon
We'll set the fire
Into a song
To burn eternal
When we're all gone

These are trying times
Made to break the heart wide
But we still defy
We will make the dead rise
We will make the dead rise
