[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Oh, keep it behind your eyes, no one has to know
Hide, let all who burn inside turn inside to stone

And every time you breathe, you feel it leave
Leave

I feel the static of a shadow in your place
I see a savage in the still upon your face

So, buried a thousand feet underneath your soul
Lie all of the vows you made, ties you laid to rest

And every time you breathe, you feel them leave
Leave

I feel the static of a shadow in your place
I see a savage in the still upon your face

I feel the static of a shadow in your place
I see a savage in the still upon your face
I feel the static of a shadow in your place
I see a savage in the still upon your face
