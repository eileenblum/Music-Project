Don't leave us
They said that you had gone astray
Don't lead us
Away from the light

We stood behind the veil and watched you walk away from us
You shattered all our dreams in one fatal mistake

You fractured every piece of life that we cared about, remember how
You breathed in us new life and then you took it away, you'll never live that down

I gave you every guiding word to cut it off, cut it off, cut it off, cut it off
Now you hand me back the blade to make that first incision for you

[Chorus:]
Wait and see
The weight of life may be the end of me; the tension, break me

We held you up on high so why did you abandon us?
We never thought you'd be the one to fall so far

You fractured every piece of life that we cared about, remember how
You breathed in us new life and then you took it away, you'll never live that down

I gave you every guiding word to cut it off, cut it off, cut it off, cut it off
Now you hand me back the blade to make that first incision for you

For you

[Chorus]

[Incision deals with putting people on a pedestal. Often times, people like to think of certain others as immovable or unfailing, and they look to these people for a perfect example at all times. No human, aside from Jesus, should ever be looked at in that way. That kind of thinking will only bring disappointment and confusion.

This song explores two different perspectives. The perspective of someone who has been disappointed by someone that they thought was supposed to live a perfect life, and that person who might have failed them. The pressure that may accumulate from a situation like this is bound to break a person. True hope should only be placed in Christ, and no man. Christ will never fail you. Man will always fail you.

It is better to take refuge in the Lord than to trust in man.
-Psalms 118: 8]
