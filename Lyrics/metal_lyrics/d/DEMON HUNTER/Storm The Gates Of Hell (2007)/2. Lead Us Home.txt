One more day
This time I'll bite the bullet
Let me stay
And set this life ablaze

Give myself to compromise
And let the hammer fall
From blackened eyes to broken ties
I've bled to know them all
Driven to the brink of death
I heed deceptions call
Through bitter tears, forgotten years
I've come to sever all

[Chorus:]
Lead us home
Lead us home
Our tired hearts are failing now, from the inside out
Lead us home

One more time
This day I kill the witness
Take back what's mine
And give disgrace a name

Give myself to compromise
And let the hammer fall
From blackened eyes to broken ties
I've bled to know them all
Driven to the brink of death
I heed deceptions call
Through bitter tears, forgotten years
I've come to sever all

[Chorus]

Blessed hands will tear me off
And break me at the wrist
Drag me back to solid ground
And slay the fate I kiss

[Chorus]

[This song is simply about the constant struggle in this life to make the right decisions. In the song I ask the Lord for "one more day" to make things right. I think that seems to be a common thought amongst Christians, that if we just had more time on this earth, we could learn to be better followers of Christ. And although that may be the case for some, we will always face temptation, sadness, depression and pain in this life.

And in light of that fact, my plea in this song is simply for God to lead us home, to him. Time and time again, day after day. It's a song of surrender, that Christ would show us his face in our times of failure or pain.

I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.
-Proverbs 4:11]
