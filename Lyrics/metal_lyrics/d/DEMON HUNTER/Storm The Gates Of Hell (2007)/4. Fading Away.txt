It's in this wake that I find myself
Losing the will to resume this Hell
When every breath is a dying wish
It's harder to follow the point of this

This broken place that I call my home
Has deepened the sorrow that I have sown
And I can't erase what is in my heart
I want it to finish before it starts

My own solution insufficient again
No false illusion, this devouring threat
I break the vessel, giving air to its red

And open my fate to the darkened sky

[Chorus:]
I've been fading away
I've been waiting on the call to reach my veins
Ready or not
No attention to waste
Every sorrow of the soul will read my name
When I cease to exist

So now I've come to the final sleep
I pray that forgiveness is mine to keep
I know it's hard to forget this man
Driving the failure into your hands

My own solution insufficient again
No false illusion, this devouring threat
I break the vessel, giving air to its red

And open my fate to the darkened sky

[Chorus]

[Fading Away is about waiting to hear a call from the Lord. I think we, as Christians, can get caught up waiting on a specific word from God, all the while sitting stagnant and unproductive. Sometimes it seems like we can slowly begin to fade away from the Lord as we wait for something to slap us in the face. I think in many cases God wants us to take some necessary steps in order for His will to be revealed to us.

This song talks about how our own selfish attempt at life is likely to be ill fated, and how we so often live according to our own desires.

For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.
-James 3:16]
