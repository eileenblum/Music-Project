A black heart in an empty shell where the desperation laid waste - I am you
A blank page in an unknown book and the opposition you face
I am the endless scar, the broken hope, the gaping hole in your faith - I am you
The dark trail of endless graves where all the lifeless lay

I am waiting for that blade to fall and cut me free of this
Hollow life that leads to all the ends that don't exist

[Chorus:]
Time to burn this design, to free ourselves
We will burn this together
Time to fuse this design, to make us one
We will burn this together

A new voice for the broken souls in a world awaiting its death - I am you
An everlasting well of life for the hopeless and the wrecked
I am the dying self, the narrow path, the calm that conquered the storm - I am you
The crosshairs on the head of shame, the negation to conform

I am waiting for that blade to fall and cut me free of this
Hollow life that leads to all the ends that don't exist

[Chorus]

I will rise
I will break this
You will rise
You will break this
We will rise
We will take them down
Rise and break them down
Down, down, down
Break them down

[Chorus]

[I wrote this song with the intention that the listener might be able to associate with the best and worst parts of myself. It's important to know that other people face the same issues and deal with the same pain that you do, so that you do not feel alienated or alone. But it is also important to know that we are all created in God's own image and that he has created us for His glory and that each of us has a purpose in this life.

"I am you" means that I share in your struggles, but that we can also share great blessings and we can both be powerful through Christ. It's meant to lift the listener out of a weary state, and into feeling spiritually powerful.

I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.
-Romans 15: 30]
