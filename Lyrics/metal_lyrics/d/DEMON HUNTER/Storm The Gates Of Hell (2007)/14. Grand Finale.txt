You'll find me face down, hands bound, ready for the blade to make me two
If judgment falls to meet this ground, that fate will run me through
No day of wrath will see me break for that faithless breath of shame
When the heretics come to make that list, be true to speak my name

Leave all you see
The curse of man is dead, the hourglass turned on its head
And every care will fade away
To wake a new day

[Chorus:]
Take every throe within us all
The very breath inside our soul
We bleed the life into your hold
The very death of our control

No man can bring a fatal sting and I laugh at the gallows thrall
Just line it tight around my neck so my words will break that fall
Fall

Leave all you see
The curse of man is dead, the hourglass turned on its head
And every care will fade away
To wake a new day

[Chorus]

That final day will fall
And those who curse the sky will face the earth
The many turn to one
The God of Gods' own righteous son
Begging for that second birth

[Chorus]

[This song is fairly self-explanatory. It's essentially about the end times and about the assurance that my soul is safe no matter what may happen in this world. I speak about being bold and standing strong for Christ against adversity. I warn those who stand against God that they will one day be faced with judgment.

Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Philippians 2: 9-11]
