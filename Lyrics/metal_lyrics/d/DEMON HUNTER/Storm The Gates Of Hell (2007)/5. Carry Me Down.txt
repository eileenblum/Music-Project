And if you see me losing ground
Don't be afraid to lie
I know the pain inside my heart can't break the fear inside of yours
And if you see me losing faith
In what it means to die
Don't let me leave before I know what lies behind the stained glass doors

Save sorrow for the souls in doubt
Bleed every care out

[Chorus:]
Will you carry me down the aisle that final day
With your tears and cold hands shaking from the weight
When you lower me down beneath that sky of gray
Let the rain fall down and wash away your pain

For every word we never spoke
We have a tear to cry
For every silence like a wall between a better you and I
So if you see me losing sight
Of all the death in life
You'll find the peace in every time I failed to see the death in mine

Let all the fear inside you drown
Tear out the blade and lay it down
Save sorrow for the souls in doubt
Bleed every care out

[Chorus]

Oh, the blood is rushing out
Oh, I'm better off without
Oh, the walls are closing in
Oh, sing for me again

[Chorus]
(Rain down, oh rain down, no care for the flood)

[This song, although seemingly very sad and depressing, is in actuality a love letter to my friends and family. It is essentially something that I would want them all to know if I were to die. I ask my true friends to carry my casket down the aisle, and as they lay me into the ground, not to mourn for my soul, but rather rejoice for my salvation.

Death can be viewed as a very negative thing, but for Christians, it is where we find our true hope. Death is never something I would take lightly or toy with, but to address it I think can be very revealing. If you never spoke of the reality of death, you would be ignoring such an important part of life. This song asks my friends and family to "save sorrow for the souls in doubt," for they know that my soul is safe.

Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death.
-Isaiah 57:2]
