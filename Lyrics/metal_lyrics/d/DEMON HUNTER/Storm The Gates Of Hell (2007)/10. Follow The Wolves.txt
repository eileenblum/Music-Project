Run

Every second is a pure affliction
But I can feel your pain
Choke back the burn of wrath as they violate your name
No sign of innocence in this godforsaken place
When the truth is in your hands, they'll spit upon your face

Dismantle the ground they stand on
Give power a name
You've traveled the path of slander
Now bury the shame

Shed rejection
Learn to follow the wolves

[Chorus:]
Run away to the blackened sky, through the fear of disbelief
Run away from the hollow cries, to the shelter of release
Run away to the blackened sky, through the fear of disbelief
Run away from the hollow cries, to immunity

See the struggle of the faithless lot as they negate their time
How low to sink to the depths of their frame of mind

Dismantle the ground they stand on
Give power a name
You've traveled the path of slander
Now bury the shame

Shed rejection
Learn to follow the wolves

[Chorus]

No tear for desolation
Nearing the end of our misery

[Chorus]

[The idea behind Follow The Wolves comes from a thought I had about being "wolves in sheep's clothing," and how you could very well refer to us (a Christian heavy metal band) as "sheep in wolves clothing." And in conjunction with that thought, I thought of how the term "sheep" was often used to deem someone a mindless follower. And if someone were being a "sheep" by mindlessly following the flock of worldly desires, then again, we must be the wolves.

This idea got me thinking about some of the fans that have written us that feel like outsiders in their schools or churches. There are a lot of Demon Hunter that feel very alone in their principles and convictions within their environment, and they've written to thank us for being a source of inspiration and stability for them.

This song is for all of the fans out there, pressured to follow the rest of the world and fit in with the crowd. The pre-chorus says "Shed rejection, learn to follow the wolves," which means to forget about the ridicule from your peers. Follow us, the outcasts. We understand your struggles and we will overcome this world.

"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."
-Matthew 7: 13, 14]
