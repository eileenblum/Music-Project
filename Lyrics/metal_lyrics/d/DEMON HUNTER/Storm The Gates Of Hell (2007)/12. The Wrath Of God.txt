Tear at the voice inside
Dig a deeper tomb and all the self can finally resonate, resonate, resonate, resonate
Tread on the path of pride
You can be the god and let the faith become your enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy

Breathe redemption into wasted life
Closer, closer
Find the wrath of God inside your eyes
Closer, closer

[Chorus:]
Breathe deep
And as the fear before you falls
I know the pain is so unsettling
Breathe deep
So now you've built a thousand walls
But in the end it's all unraveling

Stand with a worthless sign
Wave it in the path of every face you cannot tolerate, tolerate, tolerate, tolerate

Breathe redemption into wasted life
Closer, closer
Find the wrath of God inside your eyes
Closer, closer

[Chorus]

This is the last day that you will regret
Wake from your sleep and never forget
This is the last day that you will regret
Closer, closer

[Chorus]

Closer, closer, closer, closer

[Unintentionally, The Wrath Of God almost acts as a sequel to Fiction Kingdom. The song essentially begs the listener to wake from their spiritual coma, and live in reverence of God and his power.

I aim these lyrics at those who live their lives for themselves, with no care for their own spiritual welfare. I ask them to evaluate their place in this life and to open their eyes to God's presence.

You can ignore God, but that doesn't make him disappear. Your choice to disbelieve doesn't change God's objective presence.

Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.
-Ecclesiastes 8: 13]
