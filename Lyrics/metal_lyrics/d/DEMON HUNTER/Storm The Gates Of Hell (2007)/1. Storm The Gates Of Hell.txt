Broken teeth, a shattered jaw
Ten to one, behold my God
Wicked sons of Heaven's loss
Raise your own inverted cross
Kings of earth, iron first
Serve the sacred you dismissed
Stand before your final day
Choke on every line you pray

Raise your glass to death
Not one second left

[Chorus:]
Wake the lifeless, die to fight this
Stand beside me, storm the gates of Hell
Wake the lifeless, die to fight this
Stand beside me, storm the gates of Hell
Storm the gates of Hell

Coward's heart, a serpent's tongue
Stand to face what you've outrun
Fear of death, fear of pain
Bound to all you took in vain
No more lies, no regrets
Sever ties and hollow debt
Open eyes, live to learn
Or watch your blessed temple burn

Raise your glass to death
Not one second left

[Chorus]

Hell hath no fury at all

[The lyrics for this song came to me when I was reading the Psalms. It talked about the "kings of the earth" and worldly rulers. My intention is to warn these people, in our day and age, to beware of the almighty power of God.

It also acts as a call for everyone who listens, to lay down their worldly cares, take up their swords, and fight with us against the evil and Godless powers of this world. To "storm the gates of Hell," means to boldly stand in the face of adversity, and strike back against Satan's deceitful ways.

Arise, O Lord! Deliver me, O my God! Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.
-Psalms 3:7]
