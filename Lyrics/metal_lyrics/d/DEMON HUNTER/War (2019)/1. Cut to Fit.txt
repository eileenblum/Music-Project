War in every breath...

If I remember this day when the war is through
And all the fires that were leading to this
Then I'll be civil in the corner I was backed into
A lot slower to raise my fist

I knew the fight was all in vain
But I felt you falling

Now
I know my way
Found a world of pain
And cut it to fit in the place of my heart
I cut it to fit in the place of my heart

There is a crippling plague underneath this weight
And I'm afraid that I know what it is
Because the further we get from the way of truth
The much further we descend the abyss

I feel the venom pervade, demanding its way
As you nailed me against that wall
In your wrath you preyed on the hope I gave
So now I'm praying for a final resolve

I knew the fight was all in vain
But I felt you falling down
Why should I wait to feel the same
When our fate is calling

Now
I know my way
Found a world of pain
And cut it to fit in the place of my heart
I cut it to fit in the place of my heart

Now
I know my way
Found a world of pain
And cut it to fit in the place of my heart
I cut it to fit in the place of my heart

I found my truest way was not my way at all
Save us when we fall

Now
I know my way
Found a world of pain
And cut it to fit in the place of my heart
I cut it to fit in the place of my heart

Now
I know my way
Found a world of pain
And cut it to fit in the place of my heart
I cut it to fit in the place of my heart
