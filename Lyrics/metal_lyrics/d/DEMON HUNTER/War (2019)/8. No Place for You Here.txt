All hail the broken ones
Daughters stray and bastard sons
Those come to fight this dark
Claim to heal our shattered hearts

But I can't trust in you
To pull the weight entrusted to
Every guiding light
Guiding all our blind

They tell me
There is no place for you here
Don't waste your time

I saw the crack run through
Every word you thought you knew
You swore to meet us there
Swore to lead in what we share

But I can't trust in you
To pull the weight entrusted to
Every guiding light
Guiding all our blind

They tell me
There is no place for you here
Don't waste your time

There is no place for you here
Stay with your kind

I can't trust in you
Pull the weight
Entrusted to

I can't trust in you
Pull the weight
Entrusted to

There is no place for you here
Don't waste your time

There is no place for you here
Stay with your kind
