Some of us won't live
In your mind's abyss
You say we're all bound
How do I get out?

Caught in the all-connected heart
I'm no saint, but I can tell the shades apart
That's where I start

We are not the same
You don't speak for me
All your matter's gray
My world is black and white

We are not the same
You don't speak for me
All your matter's gray
My world is black and white

You ensured I do
See this world in two
How can I resign?
To your faint through line

Caught in the all-connected heart
I'm no saint, but I can tell the shades apart
That's where I start

We are not the same
You don't speak for me
All your matter's gray
My world is black and white

We are not the same
You don't speak for me
All your matter's gray
My world is black and white

Caught in the all-connected heart
I'm no saint, but I can tell the shades apart
That's where I start

We are not the same
You don't speak for me
All your matter's gray
My world is black and white

We are not the same
You don't speak for me
All your matter's gray
My world is black and white
