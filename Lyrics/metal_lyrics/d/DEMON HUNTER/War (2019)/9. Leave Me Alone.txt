Where's your reason
I would die to know
Feel like I've been torn apart
And left in the cold
Same old season
Over and again
Every needle building up
To cut me down to the bone

Outrun
I'm gunning for tomorrow's eclipse
And the panic is all that's bound to be
One by one
'Til every single plot is erased
Fear is all of the fate that's left for me

That's my only guess
Break the flesh 'til nothing's left to atone
But I wanna know
When the grave will need me
Or just leave me alone

That's my only guess
Break the flesh 'til nothing's left to atone
But I wanna know
When the grave will need me
Or just leave me alone

My delusion
Fed my yesterdays
I can see my change of heart
Was always a mile away
Ever-fading
Giving weight to faith
This has been my call to wake
And breathe in the light of the day

Outrun
I'm gunning for tomorrow's eclipse
And the panic is all that's bound to be
One by one
'Til every single plot is erased
Fear is all of the fate that's left for me

That's my only guess
Break the flesh 'til nothing's left to atone
But I wanna know
When the grave will need me
Or just leave me alone

That's my only guess
Break the flesh 'til nothing's left to atone
But I wanna know
When the grave will need me
Or just leave me alone

Don't leave me waiting
I wanna know
How much further down?
If there's a reason
I wanna know
Turn this time around

Outrun
I'm gunning for tomorrow's eclipse
And the panic is all that's bound to be
One by one
'Til every single plot is erased
Fear is all of the fate that's left for me

That's my only guess
Break the flesh 'til nothing's left to atone
But I wanna know
When the grave will need me
Or just leave me alone

That's my only guess
Break the flesh 'til nothing's left to atone
But I wanna know
When the grave will need me
Or just leave me alone
