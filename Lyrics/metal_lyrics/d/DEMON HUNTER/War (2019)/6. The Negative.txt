I see the fall out
End before it all
True perception is a
Place I default

There is a side I
Try to mediate
To set a fire to
Show some restraint

I suffer the wages
Blind in the age of flesh
Weight of the world
Beating my heart to death

No faith in them, no faith in us
No fix for lifelong distrust
No faith in you, no faith in me
I gauge our fate on history

Everyone
Everyone starts in the negative (The negative)
The negative (The negative)
Everyone
Everyone starts in the negative (The negative)
The negative (The negative)
With me
With me

I know the outcome
I will separate
The very matter from the
Ways that I hate
Hate, hate, hate, hate

I see through deception
Never a soul to trust
All but one
Led by a heart of lust

No faith in them, no faith in us
No fix for lifelong distrust
No faith in you, no faith in me
I gauge our fate on history

Everyone
Everyone starts in the negative (The negative)
The negative (The negative)
Everyone
Everyone starts in the negative (The negative)
The negative (The negative)
With me
With me

I set the line, I built the wall
I brought it low to break your fall

I set the line, I built the wall
I brought it low to break your fall

I set the line, I built the wall
I brought it low to break your fall

I set the line, I built the wall
I brought it low to break your fall

Everyone
Everyone starts in the negative
The negative

Everyone
Everyone starts in the negative (The negative)
The negative (The negative)
Everyone
Everyone starts in the negative (The negative)
The negative (The negative)
With me
With me

Everyone
Everyone starts in the negative (The negative)
The negative (The negative)
Everyone
Everyone starts in the negative (The negative)
The negative (The negative)
With me
