Unbound
Unbound
Unbound
There are no chains on me
Unbound
Unbound
Unbound
There are no chains on me

I need no validation
Self-righteous swine
No aimless misanthrope will tell me what is mine
I see your disconnection
You made your choice
You speak deliverance but all I hear is noise

Don't cast your illusion of panic on me
'Til the rope is around

Unbound
Unbound
Unbound
There are no chains on me

Stand by your revelation
Your fake control
No faith is faith the same but stripped of all its soul
I find your reason empty
Devoid of hope
Your plea for final word is going up in smoke

Don't cast your illusion of panic on me
'Til the rope is around...

Unbound
Unbound
Unbound
There are no chains on me
Unbound
Unbound
Unbound
There are no chains on me

Don't cast your illusion of panic on me
'Til the rope is around my neck
Unlearn your compulsion to fall in between
Find your place in death

Unbound
Unbound
Unbound
There are no chains on me
Unbound
Unbound
Unbound
There are no chains on me
No chains
No chains
No chains
Nothing restraining me
Unbound
Unbound
Unbound
Unbound and free
