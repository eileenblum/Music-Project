Ash, ash
Nothing here was made to last
Ash, ash
End of days are coming to pass
Everything you love will rust
Time will turn it all to dust and
Ash, ash
Raining down in blessed black

Opulence has run its course
The idols of our time in great divorce
Cling to your hollow ties while
Flames arise and take them all by force
Let go and suffer the ash

Ash, ash
Blackening your wayward path
Ash, ash
Level set and leave it to glass
All the ways you feel complete
Time will render obsolete in
Ash, ash
Reckoning of holy wrath

Opulence has run its course
The idols of our time in great divorce
Cling to your hollow ties while
Flames arise and take them all by force
Let go and suffer the ash

Higher, higher
Walls of your empire
Higher, higher
Built for the crash
Fire, fire
See it descend into
Fire, fire
Ash

Higher, higher
Walls of your empire
Higher, higher
Built for the crash
Fire, fire
See it descend into
Fire, fire
Ash

Let go and suffer the ash
