[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]We're learning to see through the eyes of the cold
Reading between their lines
Where nothing is safe from the ties of control
Run where they cannot find

Descending further
Upending trust
You reap the ashes
You deal in dust
We heard you crawling
We saw the mark
You drew the blood in silence
But you left a scar

No
We could not escape it if we tried
There is no turning back to hide
We gave them every piece we had inside
We made our bed and now we lie

We're learning to see through the eyes of the cold
Reading between their lines
Where nothing is safe from the ties of control
Run where they cannot find
Why play dead in the dead of night
Why play fair when it's always a gun fight

Descending further
And bleeding dry
In blind devotion
To vacant high
You sold us all into a system of fraud
To fuel the commerce of a trivial god

No
We could not escape it if we tried
There is no turning back to hide
We gave them every piece we had inside
We made our bed and now we lie

We're learning to see through the eyes of the cold
Reading between their lines
Where nothing is safe from the ties of control
Run where they cannot find
Why play dead in the dead of night
Why play fair when it's always a gun fight

Cast your souls upon this fleeting throne
Listen while they strip you to the bone
Lock and load

We're learning to see through the eyes of the cold
Reading between their lines
Where nothing is safe from the ties of control
Run where they cannot find
Why play dead in the dead of night
Why play fair when it's always a gun fight
