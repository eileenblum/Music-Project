I hold you in like a deep breath.
Feel you like the last beautiful touch before a final rest.
I know I'll see you forever.
I want it painted black and red.
It's so beautiful to me, it's everything I see.
It's so beautiful to me, but it's nothing that I need.
And I can't taste anything less.
Every time I'm forced down.
To be with yourself, take all the blood you want.
But not from here.
It's so beautiful to me, it is everything I see.
It's so beautiful to me, but it's nothing that I need.
Not a hand, not a finger.
This is my home.
I'm dying here.
I hide in the corner.
That look on your face, I'm accustomed to it.
