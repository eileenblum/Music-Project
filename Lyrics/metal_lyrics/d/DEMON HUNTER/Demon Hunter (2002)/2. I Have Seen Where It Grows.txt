A shell for the earth, all seasons reverse.
A life inside out in a jet-black hearse.
The feel of pain and the taste of dirt.
A dardened sky and the loss of worth.
Lower me down under glorious green.
Eternity waits on a broken machine.
Exit the soul in a vibrant white.
Leaving the shell in the dead of night.
Life is a path, Death a destination.
I've met the end of being, my eyes are open wide.
I feel myself depleting, and watch my body die.
A step to the throne, I stand alone.
A vacant mind and a destined home.
Engaging the end in a seamless gaze.
Like blind I climb through the tortured blaze.
Raise me up into white unstained eternity gained, only life remains.
Forever the scars have been washed away
Like blood on the brow of a forgotten day.
Life is a path, Death a destination.
Ive met the end of being, my eyes are open wide.
I feel myself depleting, and watch my body die.
Life is a path, Death a destination
