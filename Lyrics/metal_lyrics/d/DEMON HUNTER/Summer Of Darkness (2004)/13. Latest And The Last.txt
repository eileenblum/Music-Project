Words of high cost (you spit a curse at my name)
When thoughts of hate cross (I can't devour your blame)
This is your choice (this is your hammer to crush)
I have no voice (you're not the hand that I trust)

Throw it down on me.
Throw it down on me.

[CHORUS:]
Before you break your silence, before we tear this open...
We'll count the dead and hopeless for every word unspoken.

Thoughts, like blood, run (forever staining our hands)
Mouth like cold gun (before the barrel we stand)
The latest and the last (you put a price on my head)
The latest and the last (the worst is already said)

[CHORUS]

Spilling through your teeth
You're sick of what you've seen
You point your guilt at every step we took in loyalty

[CHORUS]

Throw it down on me.
Throw it down.
