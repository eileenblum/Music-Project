Fall into the flood of your awakening
Drown. You're just a trace of what I used to be

Waging the battle for the appreciation you'll never win
Behold the army that will harken with open souls
A tiny voice of pester softer than a drop of a pin
And so naive thinking you were
The source you told
I was composing the beginning before you had begun
Where did you sharpen such a tongue
For the sound you spill
I want the honor for the favor that I've already won
Without the ignorant deduction
That you reveal

Give me the pain of something real
No empty notion, I want to see the pressure rising
Give in a way that I can feel
When you disgrace me I want to see your eyes burn

Fall into the flood of your awakening
Drown. You're just a trace of what I used to be

You wrote the words you couldn't
Stomach manifesting with breath
I read the thoughts you never
Questions would show me your face
If confrontation were to wake and
Rear its ugly head
I get the feeling you'd be wanting it all erased
This simple gossip is your only definition of life
And what a vacant purpose taking it to your grave
There is no threat of loss in
Hearing the slant you cry
Oh what a fool to think you fell
On the mass you crave

Fall into the flood of your awakening
Drown. You're just a trace of what I used to be

Awaken from the delusion of validity
Awaken into the truth of how it used to be
Wake up

Fall into the flood of your awakening
Drown. You're just a trace of what I used to be

Awaken
