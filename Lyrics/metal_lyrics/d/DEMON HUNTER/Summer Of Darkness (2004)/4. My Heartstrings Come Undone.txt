It's buried deep with in the past, I hope it doesn't last
It's something I already chase, I already chase
I try to give it all away, but it's never gonna fade
It's something I don't wanna face, I don't wanna face
I know you feel it's all the same, But I promise that'll change
It's something I already chase, I already chase
You know I'm trying to believe that you're never gonna leave
It's something I don't wanna face, I don't wanna face

There's nothing left! The fear is gone!

When my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, I will pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you

I know I'm not the perfect one, This pain has just begun
It's something I already chase, I already chase
You bring me to a better path, It's everything I asked
It's something I don't wanna face, I don't wanna face

There's nothing left! The fear is gone!
There's nothing left! The fear is gone!

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, I will pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you

If you fade out without me, you'll know all about me
If you fade out without me, you'll know all...

And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, I will pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you
And when my heartstrings come undone
I will wait for you, I will pray for you
Before I make my final run
I will stay with you, decay with you
