There is a pathway
Tried and true to its heart
Everlasting
Stand the test of this dark
And all the others will fail
One by one derail
Into the ashes
The burning abyss of false hope

And though my heart will stray again
I know in the end...

There are only two
Two ways
Two ways to die
Eyes shut or open wide

No longer blind
Read between their lines
Every outcome
Now in the clear and defined

I heard you call
When I ran
Same as it was
When time began
