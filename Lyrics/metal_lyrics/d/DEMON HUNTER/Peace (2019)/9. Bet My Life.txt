Some say there is a void beyond our eyes
Feeding on the light
Souls torn away to vacant night
Nowhere to arrive

Where is your soul inside
Telling us tomorrow died
And every life was led in vain

I find
Emptiness is not my state of mind
I will find the other side
I bet my life

Tell me all the ways you ease your mind
Sell me on the lie
Leave everyone you love behind
One lasting goodbye

Even in my darkest day
I commit my spirit to a place
Where the fire never dies
I bet my life

I see the light of endless time
Hope without a narrow mind
All I need
