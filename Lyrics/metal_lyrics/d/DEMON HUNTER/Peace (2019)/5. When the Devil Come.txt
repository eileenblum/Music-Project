No inception, not a sound
Break or fault line in the ground
When the devil come

Idle hands in quiet peace
Waiting for my soul to sleep
When the devil come
Pure deception painted clean
Vacant flesh in lucid dream
When the devil come

When the devil come
Let my spirit breathe
When the devil come
Lay me at your feet
Come to me in shallow waters
Hold me underneath
When the devil come

All my world is burning lust
Every need there ever was
When the devil come
I will fold in seconds flat
Throw my heart into the black
When the devil come

No inception, not a sound
Break or fault line in the ground
When the devil come
