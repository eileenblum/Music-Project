Divided in cycles
We beg to slow the turning of days
Fixation eternal
And so we live to find the escape

The measures we take
Will anchor our soul-defining place

But time...
Time only takes
Time...
Time only takes

Our futures unfolding
We build our walls to keep it away
No sense in controlling
These hopes will fall apart as they may

The measures we take
Will anchor our soul-defining place
Decisions we make
Tomorrow may come to shape our ways
