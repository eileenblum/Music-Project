I will filter all I know
Feed it through my soul
Tear it out and lay it at your feet
Set a fire for tomorrow
Set it to your woes
Feel defiance burning through my teeth

It's not enough to drag this blade across the day
Not if I can stay

More than bones
You'll never be alone again
When I leave you, I leave you more than bones
More than bones
You'll never be, never be alone
When I leave you, I leave you more than bones

When the fear is your messiah
Weaponize your mind
Carve these hallowed words inside your soul
I will send to you a passage
Far beyond my time
Hear my fury echo through your cold

It's not enough to drag this blade across the day
Not if I can stay

More than bones
You'll never be alone again
When I leave you, I leave you more than bones
More than bones
You'll never be, never be alone
When I leave you, I leave you more than

You'll never be alone again
When I leave you, I leave you more than bones
More than bones
You'll never be alone again
When I leave you, I leave you more than bones
More than bones
You'll never be, never be alone
When I leave you, I leave you more than bones
When I leave you, I leave you more than bones
More than bones
You'll never be, never be alone
When I leave you, I leave you more than bones
