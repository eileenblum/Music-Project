Remember me
Remind me the last time
Remember me
And when the tides were low
But now you're gone
I'm lost by the wayside
It's been so long
I can't but fight to breathe

Is that you in my head?
Have you woke from the dead?
Or is it loneliness?

It's all I see
The light of a past life
Alone to bleed
I am without release
You set me free
To wander the shoreline
Or is it me?
Too proud to speak the need

Where is the fire you gave me?
All of the weight to remind me of all that we were
How long 'til I turn?
