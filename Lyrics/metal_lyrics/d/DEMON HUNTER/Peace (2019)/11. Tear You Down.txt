[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Every passage worth its weight
Lives to separate
Don't eclipse it beneath the gray
Tell me something
Not a thought to appease the day

Don't wait for the wolves to tear you apart
There's always a cage around your heart

So let them make their rounds
The loudest make no sound
If you don't give them ground
No one will tear you down

You don't follow what they leave
Fall for what they breathe
We don't bleed when the fools surround
Feast while they sleep
Let them wake in a world without

Don't wait for the wolves to tear you apart
There's always a cage around your heart
Don't wait for the wolves to tear you apart
Don't give up the end before you start

I see them circling now
It's time we shot them down
