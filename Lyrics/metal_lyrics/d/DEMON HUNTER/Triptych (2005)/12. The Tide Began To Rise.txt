I don't belong here
I never saw this on the path I walk
The blood-stained walls, the lines of chalk on the floor
It's getting so hard
I never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise
I can't remember
The way it was when everything felt right
My mouth held shut and eyes sealed tight with control

[Pre-chorus:]
So I remember on the inside...

[Chorus:]
I found a dark, infernal place I don't want to face anymore
Somehow, I won't stop feeding the pain
My heart's just the same as before
I found a dark, infernal place that I don't want to face anymore...
...somehow...

So now I'm stuck here
Between the guilty and the insincere
The words I spoke have left here all alone
I should have known this
Never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise.
I wish it all gone......
I could've burned it when I had that choice
And now I'd die to kill this noise in my head

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

So I remember on the inside, the inside...

If this is all the love my spirit can give
Just take it back tonight
There is not a reason more to live...
