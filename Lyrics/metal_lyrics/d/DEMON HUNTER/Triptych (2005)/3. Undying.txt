[This song is an anthem for eternal life.
I wrote this song because I love the idea that with everlasting life, we are in essence, untouchable and invincible.
I wanted to convey that concept in a way that made people feel strong and proud.
I remember back in the day when bands like Living Sacrifice and Embodyment made me feel totally proud to be a Christian.
That's the feeling I wanted to give listeners with Undying]

Ever since the day that I was made I've been deciding the end
And I was made of wood and stone and won't diminish or bend
So when the heavy hand of death is here to take me away
I'll be the solid grip of time, forever holding my stay
Nobody ever made a force that took a beating like me
I call the earth and every scum to come and try to fight me
Cause when I made the choice to live beyond the dirt that we tread
I felt the curse of mortal limit fall before it was said

[Pre-chorus:]
When this season ends

[Chorus:]
One final heart-break
And blinding lights will guide our way
Free us our blind state
They will call us by our name
Undying

Tearing through these days I find
The tolerance to strive and push on
I know what lies beyond this life for me is already won
No one can take away the blood that covers over my fall
Without the blood of perfect life
I know I'm nothing at all
So now I reign forever hallowed in eternity's hand
No man can shake me from the everlasting ground that I stand

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

We are the ones who will still remain when all is laid to waste
We are the ones who, when angels cry, will see them face to face
We are the ones

[Chorus]
