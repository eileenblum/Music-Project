[As a lot of you may know, this is a song that was originally recorded by a band called Prong in 1993.
It was released on an album titled Cleansing and it's always been a favorite of ours.
Back then is when we really heavily got into metal, and this was one band that really influenced us, on a musical level.
We covered this song to pay a sort of tribute to the band, an in essence, dust off an old classic for a new generation of metal-heads]

Nothing breeds more contempt for this world
Than memories now formed
Every moment a new seed
Is grown to no reason, the trouble unfolds
For the trials of today
I'm no jury, really don't care how you feel
The pleasant notion of miraculous change
Drifts into multiple jeers

[Chorus:]
You want the good life
You break your back
You snap your fingers, you snap your neck

Seconds drip through my hands
Washed of moments unborn
All the spaces between bleed
A tribute to a sacrament never exposed
A message to the forces,
I've no pity, don't know how thankful to feel
Expectations of my daily bread
Gives me the hunger to steal

[Chorus]
