[I wrote this song from an outsiders perspective.
I tried to create a scenario of someone who has shut his life off the possibility of spiritual interaction despite hearing and feeling that it's there.
This person realizes that living life on their own terms, with no spiritual direction, is only making them suffer]

We flow with bitter words that file sharp our teeth
And we bite off our own tongues
We trample any trace of your divinity's hope
And we sacrifice our young
With our eyes sewn shut now the light can't shine
Oh, we'll never wake from dead
And when you beg for us to open up and let you in
Then we'll cut you up instead

[Pre-chorus:]
You promised you'd give us your word
We never believed it was true
And we pretend that we never heard
Cause we still don't believe in you

[Chorus:]
I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul
Is this the voice we die for?
We die for life

We built a wall to keep you out
Ignoring every word
And we saw your face behind our thoughts
Apathetic to what we'd heard

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Why does it falter? We built it all ourselves
Why does it hurt so bad, forsaking all this help?
Why are we choking on pills designed to heal?
We threw our hearts away cause we're too afraid to feel

[Chorus]
