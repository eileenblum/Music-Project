There you stood in disbelief,
Trying all you could to see through these lies
And every word that I could breathe,
Would you find more inclined to leave,
But I tried, I tried

And knowing what I've done to you,
With every thought you suffer through
My heart as black as evil can
And everything I could have been,
Erased by what I wanted then
I couldn't think a lesser man

[Pre-chorus:]
All the delicate ways
That I deepened our graves
My apology pales

[Chorus:]
Oh, the pain in your eyes
My regrets have never known such sorrow
Oh, the shame that you hide
Resolutions are the same tomorrow

So now I reap what I have sewn,
And any rapture I had shown has bled dry
And I walked the streets alone,
Accepting pain I'd never known,
As you died, you died

Then I hurt myself to see it too,
To feel the knife I put in you
My heart as broken as my ways
I never should've let it pass,
This fall was never meant to last
The reason gone and damage stays

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

[4x]
Count the cost of your vile means
Solace comes to less

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Oh, the pain in your eyes (the delicate ways)
My regrets have never known such sorrow (I deepened our graves)
Oh, the shame that you hide (the delicate ways)
Resolutions are the same tomorrow (I deepened our graves)

Deepened our graves
