[For all of our fans fighting in the war overseas, we wrote The Soldier's Song.
This is a song we wrote to give back to them, for their courage and strength in such difficult and unknown circumstances.
We feel that a lot of people, somewhat specifically, bands and a large part of the music industry, has the tendency to make these men and women feel unimportant.
This is not the case in our eyes and we want these soldiers to know that DH supports you with our thoughts, prayers and this song]

Through the clouds of fallen ash,
A lonely mother's cry
Among the fields of broken glass
The loyal few will arise
Faith now regained
Finding strength within the void,
A raging fire ignites
A spark of ever-burning power
And conviction to fight
Pride be your name
They will spit upon the honor that
You guard with your life
And run to hide in selfish fear
When threat of death is in sight
Lay down your shame

[Pre-chorus:]
Armed with resistance and blind to the cost
The say your purpose is mindless and lost
But we don't adhere to the slander they spill
We mourn with your losses and stand by your will

[Chorus:]
These tears we spill
They haunt us still
The cries of the weak lie quiet in sleep
Beneath our feet

We are the sons of holy wrath,
A shining light in the dark
The ones who walk amongst despair,
No sign of fear in our hearts
Stand in death's way
Shut out the voice of mindlessness,
Open your eyes to the truth
Believe the words that stand the test
And not the slurs of the youth
You're not what they say

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Turn over the tables and watch them run
You'll be the weapon they can't outgun

[Chorus]
