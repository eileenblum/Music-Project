I was the light
I was the quiet heart
I was the place we used to dwell
And when the cold would tear your life apart,
I was the warmth that you had felt

What have I become?
Thoughts like shadows swelling through my mind
What have I become?
Something else inside

Is driving nails into my soul
Angels from my door
Driving nails into my soul
Something inside

I was the blood inside you broken heart
I was the stone that you had held

I close my eyes
Search for you
Retracing every step
