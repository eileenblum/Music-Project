Don't come on quietly when you draw near
Don't go on lightly
Don't leave me here
I wither quickly in winter's cold, but carry onward like I was told

And I wait for a sign

Like blood in the tears of all my enemies (So they will see)
Knowing the pain the way they should
Blood in the tears of all my enemies (Given to me)
Leaving a trail to where you stood

And when it's quite, when you can hear, I beg you take me away from here

Cleansing red, wake the dead
