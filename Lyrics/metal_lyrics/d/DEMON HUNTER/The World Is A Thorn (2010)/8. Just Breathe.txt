[ft. Christian Ãlvestam]

So now you try but the blade is primed to just cut you down again
To no avail, this fix divine was wrought to do you in

Seemingly endless, beckoning debt
Vacant and nameless, where is the end?
Aching just to endure again sweet loss
Abide again to feel
This is real

Just breathe
Suffer again
Look back
Stand in the wake and breathe
Wait for the end
Fight back
This isn't over

One single touch will further crush your corrupted state of mind
You carve the way for regret to take you further down the line

This isn't over
