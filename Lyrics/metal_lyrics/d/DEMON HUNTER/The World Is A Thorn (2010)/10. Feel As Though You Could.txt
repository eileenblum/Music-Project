[ft. Dave Peters]

Rebellion
Oh cheap thrills and vacant youth
Carry out your own will
Shovel deep and bury truth
Social stain, punk wreck, mother's own defect
Sing that song you know so well
Sing it one foot in Hell
Eyes wide black
Turn your back
Oh, how the foolish will see
How every man he will bleed

The vultures circle, halo of the dead
Another vicious cycle, swallow what you're fed
And now the vultures circle, halo of the dead
Another vicious cycle
Be true to your dissent

Somehow feel as though you could
Somehow, in all your petty suffering
Burn this down

Rejection of weak trends and fake hate
This is what you're fighting for?  Some fools mistake
I will devour you
I'll overpower you
Rise from the ashes, screaming eternity

Ignite upon these words and breathe defeat
Your shallow deeds make Hell for wood and stone, flesh and bone, this alone
