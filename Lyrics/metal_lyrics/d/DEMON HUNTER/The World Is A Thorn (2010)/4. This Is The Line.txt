Fire surround, in cleansing repose
Letting the filth, like venom it flows
Scar, the mark, remind us the pain
Breaking the bones that will reach out again
And now we will rise to conquer them all
Many will challenge, many will fall
Bring us your vile, malicious of mind
We will bring their neck to the line

Scum of the earth
Power of air
You wanted the world
We'll bury you there

This is a battle
We are the blade
And this is the line, this is the line
All that they build we will break
This is the line

And though you will fight, you will not return
For when in the fields, your temples we burned
And scattered the ash upon every grave
To honor the ones that you have betrayed

Scum of the earth
Power of air
You wanted the world
We'll bury you there

This is a battle
We are the blade
And this is the line, this is the line
All that they build we will break
This is the line
[2x]

You wanted the world
We'll bury you there

This is a battle
We are the blade
And this is the line, this is the line
All that they build we will break
This is the line
[2x]

Whose side are you on?
