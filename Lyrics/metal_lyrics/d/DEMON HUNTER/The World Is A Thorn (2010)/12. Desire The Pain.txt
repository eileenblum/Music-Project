[Deluxe Edition bonus track]

This is your dying will.
Forced to feed â and over again.
Flies to filth, greed, wealth.
And we take what they give â every piece that we can hold.
Is it all that we are?
Is it all we seek to be?

Soiled hands will meet us there.
Choking the light from our souls.

I desire the pain.
I desire the weight.
And I will face my grave.

Draining the life from our veins â into a curse that we despise.
What a sickening way to spend our lives.

Soiled hands will meet us there.
Choking the light from our souls.

I desire the pain.
I desire the weight.
And I will face my grave.
I desire remorse.
I desire release.
And I will chase this away...
Away....

I desire the pain.
I desire the weight.
And I will face my grave.
I desire remorse.
I desire release.
And I will chase this away...
I desire the pain.
I desire the weight.
And I will face my grave.
I desire remorse.
I desire release.
And I will chase this away.
I desire the pain...
