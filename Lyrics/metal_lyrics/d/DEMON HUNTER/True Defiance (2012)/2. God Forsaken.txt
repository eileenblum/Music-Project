So my dissent was a shallow defense I made to lay waste to the powers of fate
And all the blame I carry around my neck, a dead cycle of pain that I chase to find my way

When the sovereign comes to me
I eclipse in the shadowâs veil
Killing all I seek to be
For the passing vain inhale
A fall to the fires of Hell never failed to awaken
Though my soul ascends, in the darkness of my heart again... Iâm God forsaken

With every turn I fail to learn my path and itâs wearing down my days
To be the voice of a half-dead, suffering age
A never-ending seek that I chase to find my way

When the sovereign comes to me
I eclipse in the shadowâs veil
Killing all I seek to be
For the passing vain inhale
A fall to the fires of Hell never failed to awaken
Though my soul ascends, in the darkness of my heart again... Iâm God forsaken

Now the grave is all I see
A fall to the fires of Hell never failed to awaken
Though my soul ascends, in the darkness of my heart again...
I'm God forsaken
