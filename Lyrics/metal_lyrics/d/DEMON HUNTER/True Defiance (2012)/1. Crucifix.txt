We will trample on our children till this world is flooded red
No boundary for depravity, no silence for the dead
Now weep for the life that youâve lead
We will follow vacant voices into our shallow graves
Reiterate the verses of some self-consuming slave

Now pay for the Hell that you praise

Every curse, lie, violation of our lives
Every careless error of breath, corruption of our minds
All the blood and the shame, defamation of name
The weight of a wicked world
Embodied on a thankless crucifix
Embodied on a blood-soaked crucifix

The sacrament is broken, and all I see is red
The idols of humanity, they tower overhead
Now weep for the life that youâve lead
The gates have severed open, setting death upon this place
Compelling us to hope in a revolting human race

Now pay for the Hell that you praise

Every curse, lie, violation of our lives
Every careless error of breath, corruption of our minds
All the blood and the shame, defamation of name
The weight of a wicked world
Embodied on a thankless crucifix
Embodied on a blood-soaked crucifix

Thine eyes have seen
Sometimes I close my eyes to escape this crooked place
It seems these foolsâ¦ well, they never learn
I guess itâs easy to see the world the way I do
The emptiness is a promise, the sin is just the proof

Embodied on a thankless crucifix
Embodied on a blood-soaked crucifix

Thine eyes have seen
