Lay your fear on the line and wake up
Now solitude of will has held you still against that wall
Dividing soul from self, you cannot help but to dissolve
Back down
Donât come crying for help when the fire surrounds you
When desperation calls you will obey
Donât you follow the mass to an endless grave
Youâve cut that vital main, now...
Lay your fear on the line and wake up
Lifeless years, unholy tears
Throw your panic aside and let go
Pain will bring to light your fears
The gravity of death is on your breath, it dwells inside
Hold fast to your distraction, feed ambivalence your time
Hold your breath, retain your silence
I donât buy your self-reliant soul
