I feel ashamed
With abandon in my heart
And on my face

I suffered the blame
I would show you this way
But I'm too late

When the sorrow it breaks them
I will replace them
For you

Dead flowers for the torn apart
Laid at the grave
To heal a broken heart
Let it rain until it floods
Let the sun breathe life once more
Reborn

Wish you the same
To walk beside
And carry on this flame

To see you again
With a radiance
Of a pure and holy name

When the sorrow it breaks them
I will replace them
For you

Dead flowers for the torn apart
Laid at the grave
To heal a broken heart
Let it rain until it floods
Let the sun breathe life once more
Reborn

Dead flowers for the torn apart
Laid at the grave
To heal a broken heart
Let it rain until it floods
Let the sun breathe life once more
Reborn

Dead flowers for the torn apart [3x]

Let it rain until it floods
Let the sun breathe life once more
Reborn

Dead flowers for the torn apart [10x]
