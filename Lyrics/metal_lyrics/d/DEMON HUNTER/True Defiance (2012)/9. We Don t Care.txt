This is the end of everything
A degenerate cultureâs elegy

Now the reaper is waiting at the door
Drunk on our blood and craving more
This is the sound of a thousand holy feet treading on a soon forgotten grave
This is a life-long declaration of war, no sacrifice in vain
Let them remember the name
Feels like weâve run out of air
They tear the breath out from our lungs
And we donât care
Feels like weâve run out of air
Damnation passed down to our sons
And we donât care
Witness the end of apathy
We have embraced our suffering
Will the pain illuminate our fall?
Or will we see the blame at all?
No compromise to end
Weâll wash the blood off from our hands and fight again

Remember the name
