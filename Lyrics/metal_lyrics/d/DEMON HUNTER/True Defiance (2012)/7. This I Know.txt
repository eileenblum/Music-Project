Let my soul be a silent storm
Conceived in the fire of war
I am the ruthless bane of a wicked world and I pray on the killing floor
When I carve my name across this place it is to defile its vain and vile ways
With every breath like a threat for tomorrowâs embrace
And the battle is my way
I will go this path alone
I will take unto my prey, this I know
All others will fall
Let my will be a violent path to tear apart whatâs left
All Hell falls down around my feet when I speak with a word of wrath
And the battle is my way
I will go this path alone
I will take unto my prey, this I know
All my life will sing the pain
My suffering will show
In the fight I find my name, this I know
The blade of my call
One name above all
All others will fall
