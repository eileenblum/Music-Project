Conviction was your shelter
Boarded up, rejected, left behind

To lower life where aimless spirits die
Suffer your indifference
Tie that troubled stone around your neck
Exalt your fall and hear your motherâs cry
Colder now
Thank your hopeful solitude itâs colder now
Throw your blackened heart into
Resistance (You had reason in your hands and you walked away)
Resistance
(Your time will not outlive your debt to pay)
Resistance (You had reason in your hands and you walked away)
Resistance

Defiance on this day
This plague is not your savior
Turn the barrelâs eyes upon this strife
The truth, it will reveal that fading line
There is a kingdom beyond your eyes
Whole of redemption, defining will
The path of self is wrought with fatal lies
Send them back to Hell
