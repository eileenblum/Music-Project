Is there nothing I can say?
When you turn around and carry on this way
Have you lost the path we made?
When your fear had pulled you far away from grace
See you fading out again
All your promises are taken with the wind
And if tomorrow never comes for all the cold and bitter ones... we can breathe
And if tomorrow never comes for all the cold and bitter ones... let us sleep
Did they still your beating heart? (all the soul you gave)
Did they take your words and tear them all apart?
Does it kill to let it go? (sacrifice your name)
I hope if follows you and breaks your frail bones
Here we are, one final time
To go and leave your soul behind
