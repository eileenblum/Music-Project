[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]Itâs hard to say that Iâm back on a straight line
Youâll see my path is in fact just a fault line
Itâs in my blood, itâs in my lungs, and it wonât die
I fight these words, I bite my tongue, so I donât lie
Though itâs me to blame, there is no more shame in me
I just feel the same, immune to all this pain
And the scars donât write a song for me at all
I am a stone, unaffected
Rain Hell down onto me
Flesh and bone, unaffected
Your fool I will not be
I tried to see and believe in the short-sight
Accept the burn of a vain and a half life
And how you rest your faith in these for a lifetime
The hollow lie against my hope that I wonât buy
No, your tears wonât line a path for me to crawl
The waters rise above my eyes
I will breathe it in and go out with the tide
And when you think this is the end
You will find me there where I have always been
