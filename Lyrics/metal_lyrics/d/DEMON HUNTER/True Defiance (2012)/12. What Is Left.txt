[Deluxe Edition Bonus Track]I saw you through my window
I let you crawl inside
Your face became my shadow
Your voice became my guide
What is left?
I take what I can get, and black out all the rest
What is left?
Some words that I forget, and more I regret
I came here alone
I thought youâd gone
I left you in bones at the end of the road
I came here alone
The long way home
I left you in bones at the end of the road
Iâm trying to evade you
Iâm dying to be done
One solemn night Iâll take you down the barrel of my gun
