[Music: NÃ¶dtveidt/hman]
[Lyrics: NÃ¶dtveidt]

I - have travelled through eternity
I will - reign once again

You will never rule again!

Hunger - A thirst for your pain
I will - see your kingdom burnt by sins

Join my crusade of a time left to come
To spill the blood,
Youre the ones who never saw the sun

Now I hear it, the calling
I hear the calling of the mist
The ancients and their slumber
Eenai, will rise again from the sea
Prophecy...
From the sea...
