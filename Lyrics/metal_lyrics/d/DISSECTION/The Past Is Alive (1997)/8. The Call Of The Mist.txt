The darkened sky above possesses a sense
of far beyond
Dismal visions from a distant past summons
a fate unknown
Ancient visions sweeps fast by your blinded eyes
A raven flies over the cenotaph, an ancient
force to rise

Rise!

Caressing the ground of the evil one
Infinite songs heard clear and strong
This once so placid place is now
where the dead speak and walk
The call of the mist - suffocation
of all life
Conjuring of souls, then lain in
destruction

Devour my souls in eternal blasphemy
I'm the mourner of the ones who died for you
Swallowed by the dark embracement
Open wide the somber gates!

My god has horns......
