Searching the meaning of life
Pages of satanity unfolds
This is a nice hell, paradise
Open up for Satan, and bleed

Fallen angels, come for me
My body is dying, I'm no longer me
Satanized

Come forth and open the gate
As we are burning the symbol of Christ
And forever we'll be satanized
Demons now come for me
My body is dying, I'm no longer me

Behold my power, and die!
Legions of hate will conquer
All will follow my spell
I lead people from Christ

Satanized I was born
Satanized I will be
