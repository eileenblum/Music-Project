From her throne of skulls rules our Queen of endless might
She is the initiator of dark dreams - Bringer of Luciferian light
She is Satan's mistress, a reflection of the Black Sun
A Queen of the sinister moon - She's our dark mother divine

Lilith - Our Dragon Goddess
Taninsam - Destroyer of lies
For your glory we kill this world
In thy name we Sacrifice

Bringer of nocturnal light
Grant us the powers of the eyeless sight
Unveil thyself our obscene Queen
And cleanse us with the Black Flames of your beauty

We are your faithful children
And we call upon you in this blackest of rites
Open now the gate that is your womb
Engulf our spirits with your raging night

We wash your lotus feet with blood
The life force of our enemy
We slay all those who would defy you
And with grim death seal their destiny

Bringer of nocturnal light
Grant us the powers of the eyeless sight
Unveil thyself our obscene Queen
And cleanse us with the Black Flames of your beauty

Bringer of nocturnal light
Lilith, we cry out thy name
Bless us with thy infernal presence
And open the pathway

Ishet Zenunim Taninsam Ama Lilith, Liftoach Kliffot!
Ishet Zenunim Taninsam Ama Lilith, Liftoach Kliffot!

Ishet Zenunim Taninsam Ama Lilith, Liftoach Kliffot!
Ishet Zenunim Taninsam Ama Lilith, Liftoach Kliffot!

Dark Mother, Mother Divine!
Dark Mother, Mother Divine!

Dark Mother of Wrathful Chaos - Come forth through the gate
Grant us the blessings of the dark bleeding moon
Virgin, mother, whore and crone
Open now wide the Kliffot's shell - Open wide the gates of Hell!
And lead us to the kingdom of Chaos where the dark gods forever dwell
