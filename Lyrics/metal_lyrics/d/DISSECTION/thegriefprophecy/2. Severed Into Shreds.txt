Holding a magic cube
Not knowing about my fate
Prince of darkness leads
my way down
As seas of morbid
thoughts and shaped sets
in this evil spell
Deformed being laughing
at you
Now you are in hell

Growing dead
Deep inside
The fear of my fate
Will I ever wake up?

Hook after hook
Tearing your flesh apart
A red cascade flows
Is it nice to bathe in
blood?
Malignant severing
Slow excrucation
Cutting you to shreds
Why this abomination?

Severed into shreds!
