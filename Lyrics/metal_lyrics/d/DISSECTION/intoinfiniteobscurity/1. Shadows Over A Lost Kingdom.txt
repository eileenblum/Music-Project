[Music: Nodtveit/Ohman Lyrics:Nodtveit]

I - have travelled through eternity
I will - Reign once again

You will never rule again

Hunger - a Thirst for pain
I will - see your kingdom burnt by sins

Join my crusade
of a time left to come
to spill the blood
you're the ones who never saw the sun

Now I hear it, the calling
I hear the calling of the mist
The ancients, and their slumber
Eenai will rise again from that sea

Prophecy....... from the sea
