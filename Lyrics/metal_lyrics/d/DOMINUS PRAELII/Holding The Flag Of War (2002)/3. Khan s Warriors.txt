Yet, boys and fathers separated
Lived for years in a endless battle
In the heat of the desert, in the cold of the mountains
They fight
For the glory of your Khan

To take away in the cities terror and hate
Their mark: the massacre, fire and scuffle
Slaved the children
Raped the woman with pleasure
For the glory of your khan

In the plains they march - For your Khan
With violence they kill - For your Khan
With out conscience they die - For your Khan

Crush the enemies head, their bodies deface
Drinking their blood guarter with mettle
Anthropofagic banguet on they helmets they eat
For the glory of your Khan

Yet, boys and fathers separated...

To take away in the cities terror and hate...

In the plains they march...
