Do you know an ancient, battle that has done
Where the forces of rage, stood on
A chalice of blood was just welcome
And a spell of disgrace, has ever gone

Warriors have felt, those cold winds
They made us cry, they made us brave
Don?t try to hide, from cold wilds
And death won't lead you to your grave

Our armies carry on their destiny
To change the dark night into a clear day
Whenever they need to use their ability
Claim to magic forces, don?t let it stray

Warriors have felt, those cold winds...

We fought the last battle in the east
Running so fast, spreading vengeance
We saw many enemies behind the mist
We took the lead, to spread allegiance

Warriors have felt, those cold winds...

And when we lay down our heads tonight
It seems to us that everything gets to real
We tought that was finished your fight
But we invite you to prove the taste of the steel
