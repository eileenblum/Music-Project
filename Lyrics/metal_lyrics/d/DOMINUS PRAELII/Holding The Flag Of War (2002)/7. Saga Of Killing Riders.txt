We left our homes behind
Running out inside the night
We were weak that time
But now we grown strong
Ready to conquer freedom
And rebuilt our kingdom
Possessing armored bodies
Without any fragile streams

The legion came, using the dark ways
Brought death, misery and flames
But their sorcery won't keep them in power for so long
Yes, we claim for vengeance

Is time for our vengeance
Is time for we to strike!
The Saga of Killing Riders!!!

Holding heavy swords and strong shields
As we arrive the dark legions frighten scream:
Run cause they're back, claiming for what we stealed
The Lords of Battle comes, and this time we can't win.

Is time for our vengeance...
