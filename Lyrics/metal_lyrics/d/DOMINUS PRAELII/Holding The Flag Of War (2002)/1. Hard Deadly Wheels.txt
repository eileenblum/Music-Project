Hatred in my mind
Riding Alone among hot mist
On the road in a high speed
I have flying wings 

Rage into my spirit
Iron around my fist
I never say its too late
Where is booze, I am too

Hard Deadly Wheels - Lost and far from Paradise
Shooting at their heels - When beasts show their claws
Hard Deadly Wheels - They haunt and they arise
Shooting at their heels - Time Of learning the laws

No blood on my hand
Imposing destiny
Nothing can be better
Than a life in a custom bike

The sound of the engine
The smell of burnt tires
The freedom that it give
Feel like I can do anything

Hard Deadly Wheels - Lost and far from Paradise...

Hatred in my mind...

The sound of the engine...

Hard Deadly Wheels - Lost and far from Paradise...
