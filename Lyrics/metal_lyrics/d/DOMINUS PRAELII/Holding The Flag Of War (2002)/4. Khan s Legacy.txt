The cowards poisoned Yesugei, my father
Very young I stood orphan and alone
Had everything to be a simple man
But I had a world to conquer on my own

By fire and sword I've taken China's sea
Drunk the blood of the asian warrior
India paid tribute to me

I'm a leader without blame
My fear I turned into flame
On my trace there is no shame
Ilya Temujiyn is my name

I am Kha'agan
The Ulan Bator
I'm the first Khan
From Orient to Europe
I'm Genghis Khan
I've taken the terror

I had four sons with Borte my wife
Worn with perfection the weapons and acessories
But was Sacha, my bastard who saved my life
Nevertheless that's another history

I'm a leader without blame...

I am Kha'agan...
