They used to arouse the spark
Setting on fire the unholy flame
Crossing trenches in the dark
Ruthless legion is their name
Brought axes on their back
With shield fought the wind
Wielding swords for attack
And carrying out their stint

Soldiers sated at the same table
Where the blood was spilled
Pride and honor are they label
One more mission is fulfilled
The sage blessed all then
From the top of the old mound
Bended knees those men
To spurn every curse around

When the night come apart
Enter the Hall of Power
Join the heroes for a start
Raise your sword in the Hall of Power

In search for true victory
They delivered the magic seed
Retribution of history
The mighty army marched with greed
To consecrate the final decree
They got to destroy the last clash
From inside that hall they see
And, kill the enemies like a flash

When the night come apart...
