Like a wave of flames in the grass
The legend started and spread
He carried the glory in his soul
And his prize was extreme force

The creatures of land he takes care
With power he brought liberty
His blessing was beyond our knowledge
And applied against evil was his rage

The tale of the Knight of the Silver Moon
Was told across many centuries
And his journey will not end soon
It will hold on to the memories

When his life was ripped and torn
By his old enemies
Our hero raised up his sword
In the sky, till of blood it was filled

To accomplish the promise he made
For years he has been on this fight
And he will not rest before
Justice reign, and his vengeance is complete

The tale of the Knight of the Silver Moon...
