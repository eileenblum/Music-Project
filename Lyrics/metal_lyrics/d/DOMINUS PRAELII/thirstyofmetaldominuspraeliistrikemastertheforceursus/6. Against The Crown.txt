[performed by Dominus Praelii]An earthquake has begun, the noise of riding horses
They come with armors stained with blood of heroesâ¦heroes
The crown starts to play, Chips in subordination
Theyâve blocked the road and the rivers

[Pre-chorus:]
Black out I feelâ¦Theyâve come for plunder
Scream loud and preachâ¦This time is too long

[Chorus:]
We need salvationâ¦Leftraro take me on
To freedomâ¦Submission must end
Now youâre strongerâ¦Than the Spanish sword

The tribes do not obey, Religion mandatory
They stole our customs, dreams and all the treasuresâ¦treasures
The chains release someday cutting off the abomination
Recovering the lost for the people

[Pre-chorus:]
Black out I feelâ¦Theyâve come for plunder
Scream loud and preachâ¦This time is too long

[Chorus:]
We need salvationâ¦Leftraro take me on
To freedomâ¦Submission must end
Now youâre strongerâ¦Than the Spanish sword

[Chorus:]
We need salvationâ¦Leftraro take me on
To freedomâ¦Submission must end
We Need salvationâ¦Leftraro take me on
Now youâre strongerâ¦Than the Spanish sword
Than the Spanish sword
Than the Spanish crown
Than the Spanish Lord.
