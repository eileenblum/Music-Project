[performed by Dominus Praelii]A Danish plunderer with an ambition of his own
Hastein wanted to take over Rome
He saw a city so splendid and so big
But it was well protected and they could not get in

To get in he faked his sickness and then his death
And once inside for his Christian burial he was...

BACK FROM THE DEAD

But this majestic place was the city of Luna

As after the sack Hastein found out

Mad by his mistake he commanded a slaughter

Massacred all the people and burnt the place down

To get in he faked his sickness and then his death
And once inside for his Christian burial he was...

BACK FROM THE DEAD
