[performed by Dominus Praelii]Look people around scratching the ground
Implore for your help
To rise from shadows like soldiers and warriors
They fight for the land
They fight for the land.

Hey, watch your back, they've come for a fight
With anger and pain
They become your nightmare, your mind lost in
madness
Lost in madness
Lost in madness.

Brave nahuel's heart beating...
Destruction has begun
Go, hunt, searching...
Don't give up take your sword
Brave nahuel's heart beating
The weapons like a storm...
Go, hunt, searching
Break silence now it's war.

Die, die for your rights, believe in your sign
Incrusted in your skin
That guide us to follow, the truth and the path
This army of death
This army of death.

Brave nahuel's heart beating...
Destruction has begun
Go, hunt, searching...
Don't give up take your sword
Brave nahuel's heart beating
The weapons like a storm...
Go, hunt, searching
Break silence now it's war.
