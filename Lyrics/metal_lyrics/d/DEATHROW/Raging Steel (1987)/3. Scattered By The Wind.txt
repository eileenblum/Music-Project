In 1939
A crazy man ruled Germany
Hitler was the assholeÂ´s name
The name of tyranny
The people that were against the regime
Were executed and hunted
His twisted mind decided to
Destroy the Jewish race

A new kind of killing had to be created
A giant machinery of death
The final solution, the holocaust,
The concentration camps

[Lead-Sven]

Forced in waggons like cattle
On their way to the slaughterhouse
They deported them to the camps
To extermination them all
Auschwitz and Dachau
And whatever they were called
Sadistic tormentors and immense pain
Awaited them inside

A new kind of killing had to be created
A giant machinery of death
The final solution, the holocaust,
The concentration camps

[Lead-Sven]

[Chorus:]
Hunger and thirst, torture and fear
Coldness and deadly disease
Medical experiments
To test how much pain can be born
Slow death by Zyklon-B
In the shower rooms
Bones and flesh, burnt to dust
And scattered by the wind

Senseless work, till total exhaustion
Left to die, naked in the snow

[Lead-Sven]
[Lead-Thomas]
[Lead-Sven]

Executions, in the early dawn
Emaciated, corpses for or from the flames
Barbed wire, heavy current fence
No escape, from this earthly hell

[Chorus:]
Hunger and thirst, torture and fear
Coldness and deadly disease
Medical experiments
To test how much pain can be born
Slow death by Zyklon-B
In the shower rooms
Bones and flesh, burnt to dust
And scattered by the wind
