Night after night, the same thing happens
Something takes over my soul
I try to resist, but IÂ´ve got no chance
Again I lose and it wins
Emptiness fills my body
My eyes see things which cannot be
Am I insane or is this a dream?
I am no longer me

A strange feeling grips my mind
A growing need to kill
It comes out of the nothingness
And possesses my will
Orders start rushing through my brain
To kill everything in sight
I feel itÂ´s diabolic lust
To slay with delight

My body is lead through empty streets
By the invisible force
I hide in the shadows, smell every being
Unheared of instincts awake
IÂ´m like a puppet, guided by strings
Filled with the breath of life
Pliable IÂ´ll obey my master
Will feel no remorse

A strange feeling grips my mind
A growing need to kill
It comes out of the nothingness
And possesses my will
Orders start rushing through my brain
To kill everything in sight
I feel itÂ´s diabolic lust
To slay with delight

Now the thing totally unfolds
Making me itÂ´s slave
Want to look for harmless victims
To send them to their graves
The order are clear, I will obey
-Kill everything in sight
hungry for the smell of blood
I will slay with delight

Morning light is falling, on my sweaty face
I open my eyes
My clothes are torn to pieces, dry blood everywhere
What have I done?
I look on the clock, already afternoon
I know it will happen again

Again ! - It will happen to me
Again ! - The thing wonÂ´t set me free
Again ! - I will obey
Again ! - The thing will be my fate
