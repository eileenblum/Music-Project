Now the dawn rises, the tension awakes
Silence falls over the plain
Thousands of knights are facing each other
To fight for the heathenÂ´s domain
Nobody knows what is to come
The suspense is growing with fear
Everyone is prepared to give his life
They feel the battle is near

[Chorus:]
"The final judgement will say you are right
Right to do all you have done"
-Just an illusion against any remorse
Given by the "holy ones"
Believers fought a war without sense
Killed and were killed by the force
Of raging steel

The leaders has giventhe sign to fight
Now the crowds are moving on
Both sides are meeting, hate and contempt
So many lives will be lost
Screams and cries, orders and shouts
Echo over the mass
Dying bodies among raging steel
Fighting and dying for nothing

[Chorus:]
"The final judgement will say you are right
Right to do all you have done"
-Just an illusion against any remorse
Given by the "holy ones"
Believers fought a war without sense
Killed and were killed by the force
Of raging steel

Murderers under the sign of the cross
Crusaders with orders to kill
Searching for heathens in the holy land
The plans of the church to fulfill
Blinded by words of priests and popes
The lie of a life after death
Too blind to see that each God you pray to
DoesnÂ´t mean nothing-but hope

[Lead-Sven &amp; Thomas]
[Lead-Thomas]
[Lead-Sven]

The leaders has giventhe sign to fight
Now the crowds are moving on
Both sides are meeting, hate and contempt
So many lives will be lost
Screams and cries, orders and shouts
Echo over the mass
Dying bodies among raging steel
Fighting and dying for nothing

The leaders has giventhe sign to fight
Now the crowds are moving on
Both sides are meeting, hate and contempt
So many lives will be lost
Screams and cries, orders and shouts
Echo over the mass
Dying bodies among raging steel
Fighting and dying for nothing
