Footsteps are coming near
Voices are crying a strange tone
Your body is full of fear
The night is black and you are alone
The wind rushes through the trees
It's howling is filling your ears
Restless breath at your back
The anguish of your mortal fear

[Chorus:]
You can't escape
From your own mind
Deadly pain
Insanity reigns
Mortal Dread !
Mortal Dread !

Unnatural coldness
Is embracing your heart
Eyes are staring at you
Laughter comes out of the dark
You feel surrounded
By something you cannot see
Running from the shadows
No chance to be free

[Chorus:]
You can't escape
From your own mind
Deadly pain
Insanity reigns
Mortal Dread !
Mortal Dread !

[Lead-Sven]
[Lead-Sven &amp; Thomas]
[Lead-Sven]

[Chorus:]
You can't escape
From your own mind
Deadly pain
Insanity reigns
Mortal Dread !
Mortal Dread !
