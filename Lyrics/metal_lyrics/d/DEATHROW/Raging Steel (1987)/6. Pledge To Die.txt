Fight for the symbol, which you defeat
DonÂ´t ask what for or for whom
Follow the holy call and defend
Your land against infidels and martyrs
Do you really want to die for someone
Who gives you the order:"Fight till death" !
"Save and defend our religion
and youÂ´ll get my blessing for sure".

[Chorus:]
Murdering, destroying both woman or children
Forever weÂ´ll follow his command
Take these lives to save your own
In the name of God weÂ´ll kill
Pledge to die !
Pledge to die !

Not you command your thoughts as if hypnotized your body follows the call
Millions of fanatics are addicted already
And kill for the tyrant you live for
Expelling the evil, saving the good
Christianity turns into hate
If you see the good in yourself
Use it or die in illusion

[Chorus:]
Murdering, destroying both woman or children
Forever weÂ´ll follow his command
Take these lives to save your own
In the name of God weÂ´ll kill
Pledge to die !
Pledge to die !

Fight for the symbol, which you defeat

[Chorus:]
Murdering, destroying both woman or children
Forever weÂ´ll follow his command
Take these lives to save your own
In the name of God weÂ´ll kill
Pledge to die !
Pledge to die !
