Haunting the earth in ancient times
When magic was strong and true
When dragons and demons were
A reality people knew
Witches and warlocks
Where casting their spells
Fighting for power in the magic realm
Sending each other to hell

Immortality
The highest might
Could be reached
In only on fight

[Chorus:]
To become a part, in the arena of gods
They had to be
Forever safe, safe from the scythe of death
By taking a bath
In dragonÂ´s blood

Armed with swords and magic rings
They sought to reach their aim
But their corpses were filling the caves
Where all of them died in pain

[Lead-Sven]

Haunting the earth in ancient times
When magic was strong and true
When dragons and demons were
A reality people knew
Witches and warlocks
Where casting their spells
Fighting for power in the magic realm
Sending each other to hell

Immortality
The highest might
Could be reached
In only on fight

[Chorus:]
To become a part, in the arena of gods
They had to be
Forever safe, safe from the scythe of death
By taking a bath
In dragonÂ´s blood
