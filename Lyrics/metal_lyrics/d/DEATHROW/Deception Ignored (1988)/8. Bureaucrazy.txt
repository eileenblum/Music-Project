Pedantic and narrow-minded
Stiff and boring
Clean and synthetic
Short-sighted
Cowardly and lying
Pretending kindness
Shiny scum

In necessitation with bureaucrazy
I wield my weapon with one hand
I try to win the contest
Of one-legged people in kicking asses

I hate
I hate

Corrupted
Incredible and nervous
Insufferable and careless
Merciless
Inefficient
Impersonal and fussy
Needless
Useless
Mentally confused

In necessitation with bureaucrazy
I wield my weapon with one hand
I try to win the contest
Of one-legged people in kicking asses

I hate
I hate bureaucrazy

Pedantic and narrow-minded
Stiff and boring
Clean and synthetic
Short-sighted
Cowardly and lying
Pretending kindness

I hate
I hate
