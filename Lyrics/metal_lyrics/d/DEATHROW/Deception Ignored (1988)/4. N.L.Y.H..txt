The alarm clock rings, I open my eyes
And watch the yellowed white of my room's ceiling
The dull light of the dawn falls through my window
Raindrops are hitting the ground
The splattering sound promises me a day
Full of depressive thoughts
I torture myself out of bed
It's time to go to work

Live your life in your own way
Free and full of fun
Keep on smiling every day
Think - but never get depressed
Follow the golden rule
Never loose your humor, man
Never forget - N.L.Y.H.

The work today is like everytime
Tiring, boring and grey
Nine hours later I'm at home again
Time to have some food
Now I want to disperse my thoughts
So I switch on the TV
TV-clowns grin like they want to show
How good they have cleaned their teeth

Live your life in your own way
Free and full of fun
Keep on smiling every day
Think - but never get depressed
Follow the golden rule
Never loose your humor, man
Never forget - N.L.Y.H.

But the news
Confirms my thoughts of a sick world
Can't believe
What some men are able to do
Our fate
The future of a billion souls
Lays in
The hands of a few fools

Tired I switch off the TV
Time to go to bed
Tomorrow's day won't bring anything new
But nevertheless I'm glad
I think that I have recognized
The things for what they are
I'm alive and that's all that counts
I learned to laugh in the face of fear

Live your life in your own way
Free and full of fun
Keep on smiling every day
Think - but never get depressed
Follow the golden rule
Never loose your humor, man
Never forget - N.L.Y.H.
