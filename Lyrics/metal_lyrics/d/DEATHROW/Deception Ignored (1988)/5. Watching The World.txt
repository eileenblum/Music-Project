Look up to the sky
See the stars there, shining bright
Are they the aim
The aim we should all reach for
That launch us into space
But who thinks of the earth
Where our ancestors lie

We are so clever and arrogant
It's in our hands to change everything

Who thinks of the children
Killed by hunger and disease
What about the people
Slayed in stupid, senseless wars
We're always reaching
Just for money and success
But what will we buy
When there's nothing more to sell

We are so clever and arrogant
It's in our hands to change everything
Who's watching the world
Who's watching the world

Why can't we take
All our intelligence
To create something new
That's not determined to destroy ourselves
Who's to say that it can't be done

We are so clever and arrogant
It's in our hands to change everything
Who's watching the world
Who's watching the world
