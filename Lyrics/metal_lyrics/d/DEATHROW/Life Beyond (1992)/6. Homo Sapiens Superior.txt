Computer rules We are slaves
Atomic world Violence reigns
The rats eat the children, the children eat the rats
The human race is at an end

Trouble! Don't fall in doubt we got something new
Trouble! They came from above with super-powers

Snikt! in the night
You know what I mean
Use your feet
Because wolverine is on the way

What is that in the air
Can it be a plain? Nooo!
Can it be a bird? Nooo!
Oh, I see!

I can feel the breeze storm is coming down
With her mega body and her big tits
The reavers treat the world, there's no way out
Blaze of colour make them blind
Jubilee has done it right

Wolfsbane, Jean Grey, Nick Fury, Boom boom
Cannonball, sunspot, iceman, beast
All you evil watch your steps
Or you gonna burn in hell
