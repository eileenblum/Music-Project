Why don't you show yourself?
You always hide your face
You never tell the truth

Why are you playing so cool?
No one ever can reach you
Everyone wants to know

Hidden truth
Hidden truth

Why do you believe in lies?
Playing the hero, you never let go
False reactions, a perfect show

Why don't you free yourself?
Shut the door-let nobody in
Close your book-let no one read
