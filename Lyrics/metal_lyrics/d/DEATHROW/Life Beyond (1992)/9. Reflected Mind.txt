Standing at the abyss I disdain my life for the mistakes I made
Mad but it's true I lost my friends who had trust in me
Falling in a deep hole and there's noone around who will help me out
Hopes getting smaller but the trouble remains bigger &amp; bigger

For all that don't give your life away
Stay cool and face your problems

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Black shadows surround my soul
Please, please help me now
And do it fast before I die

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Black shadows surround my soul
Should I stay, should I go
Tell me now or let me fall

Don't smash the mirror if the person you see isn't looking at you
The ability that you have is a big one so don't let it fall
My train passed the station and I can't find the emergency break
All that you do, all that you made
Will some day be paid so stay in tune
