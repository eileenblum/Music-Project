This is the world we live in, this is a place
Full of twisted minds, people with their eyes closed
Killing is just a game

War instruments of evil
War I can't believe
War killing brothers
War is killing me
This will never end
This is the way we live

Nothing will ever change, nothing will ever be
Better than yesterday, better than anytime
Killing is just a game

I am left in the night, trembling with fear
I have seen the future, and the future is here

War, blood, death, pain

Freedom that we search
Freedom that we need
Freedom that seams so near
Freedom is just a dream
Freedom that we see
Freedom is just a hologram

You can't feel
You can't touch
Just a dream
