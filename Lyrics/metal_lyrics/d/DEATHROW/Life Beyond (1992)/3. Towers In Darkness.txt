To open your eyes
To see the world
To make you believe
What's happening here
To see the crimes
Just step outside
So open your eyes
And you will see

Help is what we need
What we get is a piece of cake
Black is the day
Without money you can't buy the blue sky
Pain is what you get
If you try to answer back
War is the end
If you think you are there, you're dead

We have elevators
We have terminators
We have Arnold Schwarzenegger
We have Batman, Superman, Spiderman
These are all heroes we want to be
To falsify the world we see

Tell me who can I trust in this world
Can I trust you or better not
Are the politicians right
Or should I better make my own world

Towers in darkness reach the sky
Towers in darkness beam hate
They are watching you, they know your face
They know when you laugh, they know when you cry

And I ask you something
How much is to much-enough is enough
And that's what I mean

Watch your steps
Run away
From this state of madness
