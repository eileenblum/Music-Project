Walk through the streets
See what we've done
To the world
Children are walking with guns in their hands
News day by day
Reports about death and pain
We just watch
And don't understand the reasons of war
Intrigue and pain
Love and hate
That we see on TV
Idols of evil showing us the way
Blind we imitate and don't see
How we became what we are
Evil Bad and Mad

Help before, before we destroy, before we die
Help we need, we need something that will help us out
Of this crazy evil

World we live in
Battle field with human corpses
That's the reason we hide underneath the cover
Skinheads dressed to kill
Fear makes our eyes locked
We don't see what we see, nothing will ever change
Human refuse, nuclear fission, ozone perforation, radiation
Plutonium, dioxines, mercury
All these things will destroy our world
But we use it and don't care
