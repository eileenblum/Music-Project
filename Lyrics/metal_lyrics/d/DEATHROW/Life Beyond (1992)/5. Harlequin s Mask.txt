One day she came into my life
Gave me her hand and set me on fire
Out of the flying-pan into the fire
She broke my heart and stole my desire
Is it true what I see or is it hard to believe
She is dancing with a friend of mine
Armed to the teeth I stand in between
Between ourself I shot him down

No more, no more you will play the fool with me
No more, no more oh you will see
No more, no more you'll be laughing over me
No more, no more you will fuck with me

I saw her again
On the sunny side she walked
I can't believe, how can it be
A blaze of light everywhere she go
She is the reason for the evil in myself
She is the evil but no one can see
One sweet smile and you are lost
She's a monster with a harlequins mask

I am free, I am free so bring me back
The time when I was myself
I am free, I am free so bring me back
My eyes that I can see

The eyes
That I see
Tears are falling
It's better I loose you
Before I get lost
