Thunder in the distance, the battle begins
The enemy is on the attack
The smoke of the pulver is taking your breath
Kill or be killed--face this fact

The ditch in front of you now turns to a grave
For thousands of soldiers who died
Smell the smell of burnt &amp; rotting flesh
A pleasure for the demons of war
The cries of the wounded are stealing your mind
Once more death falls from the sky
Look around you search for your combats
In blood they must lie

[Chorus:]
Mutilated
Lagerated
Perforated
Slaughtered

Slaughtered corpses are covering the plain
A secret mist at the dawn
Somewhere moaning
Some take their last breath
You lie among them in pain
Th wounds of your body are yawning wide
A senseless war no-one won
The bell is tolling the world is turning black
No-one will pray when your gone

The ditch in front of you now turns to a grave
For thousands of soldiers who died
You smelled the smell of burned rotting flesh
A pleasure for the demons of war
The cries of the wounded had stealing your mind
Once more death falls from the sky
You looked and searched for your friends
Like them in their blood you lie

[Chorus]

The generals in shelters had nothing to fear
For them the war was just a game
Millions of soldiers trampled in graves
The cries of their mothers in vein

One more stupid order just moving a banner
Sent innocent people to hell
They never know the embarre of war
The fear and pain the soldiers felt

The ditch in front of you now turns to a grave
For thousands of soldiers who died
You smelled the smell of burned rotting flesh
A pleasure for the demons of war
The cries of the wounded had stealing your mind
Once more death falls from the sky
You looked and searched for your friends
Like them in their blood you lie
