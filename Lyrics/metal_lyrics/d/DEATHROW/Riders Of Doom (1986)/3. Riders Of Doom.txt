Armed with magic, the sun in their back
Ancients warriors appear
Covered with fures 
Hold swords strong in hand
Death reigns where they ride near 
Mean red eyes glow hot in their skulls
Their swords shine bright in the sun 
Their black horses run fast as the winds 
The ride of the damned has begun

Down in the valley a small village lies 
The people there can't guess their fate 
Before the moon has disgraced the sun 
Everyone there will be slayed 

From a hill they ride down, black winds blow 
The people hear cruel battlecries
They reach for their arms 
But it has no sense
They know that they have to die 
No one can fight the riders of doom 
The reaper now holds life in hand 
When this day is over they all will be dead
Barren and blazed will be their land

Children are crying, men are ripped
Flesh-cutting blades are spreading pain
Steels meet teel, heads ride spears 
Blood is now falling like rain 

They searched for steal
The secrets for men to survive 
Swords, signs of might 
That was what they were searching for
Power to rule the whole world
Many had died for this cause
Victims cry for help
But no one could ever fight 
The riders of doom
