How human cow?
Wet the streets
A thousand hours
Stealing away

Lymphocyte!
Back for some more
Mortal mortal pain

Satan is hammer is sure is destroyin' the Earth
Sleepin' at the baptism, bringin' the smell of death!

Stealin' the bodies and stealin' souls
Demons in your path
Killing the woman, killing the man!
That's just blood in the well

Talkin' 'bout emotions like Schwarznegger
Watchin' and watchin' as you heart is what slips away

Satan's gift to the human race
Satan's gift to the world
Satan's himself is coming from hell
And givin' his final comaaaaand!

Slave in the slough, well I choose God
And show with significance as I ride
Armies of metal, metal on your mind
Auschwitz growing right

Been through ice, and now I'm feelin' pain
The handlers scoop betwixt your Holy eye

It's Satan's gift to the human race
Satan's gift to the world
Satan's himself is coming from hell
And givin' his final comaaaaand!

[wild solo]

It's Satan's gift to the human race
Satan's gift to the world
Satan's himself is coming from hell
And givin' his final comaaaaand!
