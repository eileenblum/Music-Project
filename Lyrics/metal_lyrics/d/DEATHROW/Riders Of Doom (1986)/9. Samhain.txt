The supernatural is everywhere
Sometimes it's leaving his realm
To terrorize over the earth
Bounded with the fear of mankind
It joins witht the servants of hell
And dispossess the wake of good
The heaven fight his useless fight
The power of hell awoke

The nature holds back her breath
Evil takes possession of time

The black bird of death cries his call
Halls back from the cemetary walls
Down from the town of the dead
The reaper rises up to kill
He chooses his helpmates from the dead
And speaks exorcisms to resuscitate
Now the ground if filled with undead life
Hands break from down through the surface

When summer goes to the end
The dawn reigns the land

[Chorus:]
The reaper calls the beyoyed spels
To raise the dead
Broken eyes are open wide
The strength of hell
Streams through their veins
Samhain

The wind howls through the branchless trees
Brings the smell of corruption
Attended by the transparant inscrutable
Marches his army of samhain
The magic of mayhem is bursting
Drives n the corpses to march
The reaper takes over command
Soon fear will rule the land

When summer goes to the end
The dawn reigns the land

[Chorus]
