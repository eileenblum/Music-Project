Exhale through my life, I am above the rules. Conceal behind the truth, hurt but upright.
Trust -- bring me near the sun
Feel -- My empathy and run.
Close your eyes, open your mind, watch the wings that liquify. Through my deepest regret, there Comes my demon. My infinite threat, for my most evil acts, there comes punishment, I shall not Forget. Chain me to this stake, fulfilling my requiem, As, They, Fall, Apart.
