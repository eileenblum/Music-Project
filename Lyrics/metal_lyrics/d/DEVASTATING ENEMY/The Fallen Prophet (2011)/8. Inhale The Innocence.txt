The dawn of mankinds dusk, reflected on each one of us. Sequently they fall apart, obvious but in Disguise. Fate, traitors of ourselves, burdens the elements demise. Chained to reflections, Obsessed with damnation, my suicidal hopes streaming into a sea. Killed by your actions, stressed With frustration. My suicidal hopes streaming into that sea Consume virginity constantly, take it with Every single breath. Inhale the innocence secretly, go on and uplift your neglect. Inhale the Innocence secretly, go on and uplift your hate. The spine of an eternal void belting sickness and Man. Sequently they fall apart, obvious but in disguise.
