I see the wrath on a vision inside. I take a toll on devastation. Suffocation on the untouched of the Pure. Tainted vestment soaked in blood feigned to enhancement. Breed of lust, ridden by anger (Magnitude of hate). Driven by lunacy, pity the blinded (victims of their fate) for not soiling that Purity. Choosing the right to defend obscure desires as fault and guilt and freedom of choice, Combined to a death-bringing vault. Absurdity, my evidence of pain. My church / my hope. My Everlasting lack of constraints. Find my passion in dust, destroyed by the impact of righteousness. Recognizing the roles in this play, slowly paralyzed down on my knees.
