Psycho I'm bringing decay, standing up for a farce, spilling gas on your views. I'm getting away With a handful of hate, and no need for the truth. Hate me to the bones, fuck with my dark Thoughts, Enter my own hell. Make a mind up on your own. (You're) taking part in this act, yet Can't control how I react in this twisted egomania. Taking sides to feel alive, yet petrified, it's inside Of me. Filled with guilt and constant rage, upon oneself abolish me.
