A picture of hatred, razors of insight. Minds fucked by the wisdom of traitors, becoming one with The will, torn into pieces of slavery and chasing memories of dreams. Here comes the razors of Insight, may your discretion arise. This is the judge of your white knight, that came to keep up your Fight. Become a picture of hatred, become your ravenous greed. Abolish anger with mania, let your Obsession exceed.
