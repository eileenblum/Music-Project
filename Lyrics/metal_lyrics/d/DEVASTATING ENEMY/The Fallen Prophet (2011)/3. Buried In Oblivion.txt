Desire to unleash your mind from my memory, to persist the time's pitiless photography. Carved in Souls, ready to remain, I stand upon decay. Fueled by grief, I shall not be buried in oblivion. Forsaken, lost but purified, constant moving eyes to seize the moment's tempting way of suicide. Revolving within your soul, I beg to release me and I surrender. Control to the ones that conceive Me. Release my mind from the burdens of grief, seize my sorrow, try to conceive.
