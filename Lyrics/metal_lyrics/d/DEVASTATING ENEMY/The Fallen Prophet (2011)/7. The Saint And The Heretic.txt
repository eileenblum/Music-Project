Out of the blank, abomination ascends into the hole that compresses deathless slaughter. It seems To be one final scene perceiving screams. Victims to be the witness, the fall of empathy. Refrain from inverted dignity. I trust in ways of scum to seize its chance, molest divinity. When the saint And the heretic refrain from the evil of immortal design. When the saint and the heretic express Their ultimate warfare.
