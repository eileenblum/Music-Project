You make confessions true, I hate to construct my cage. You push aversion through and ride it Through. Fields of dust. As I surrender, I take my pain. Don't change a thing and I'll make you feel The same. When I surrender, sanity's yield. I turn my back and step into the mine field. Perpetuate Seduction of things you've been fighting for. Devote your will to nothing, break through the open Door.
