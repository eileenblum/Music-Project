Try to sacrifice your love, your hate, your sins. Is there a reason for you to cede it all? Can't use Conversion, keep standing tall. As bloodshed begins, I raise my flag and wave it high. As Bloodshed begins I trust my fate, never resign. Troops of pride assigned, alone, I stand, confined, Step up, insult, impact.
