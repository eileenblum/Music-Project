Nastylicious, you have failed again
Guilt is just a word, greed is everything
Can you feel the thrill, taking whatever comes your way
Get it, get up that hill, growing inside the modern muse, smell of decay

We wonât ever be the same again, you and me
How it all came down to this, we cannot agree
And now I hear Iâm saying that I care, but thatâs a lie
The lust is eating in on me, wonât even try

She went in and out, itâs a useless fate
Revolting cynical, it is all too late
Youâre my inner force
I feel no remorse

We wonât ever be the same again, you and me
How it all came down to this, we cannot agree
And now I hear Iâm saying that I care, but thatâs a lie
The lust is eating in on me, wonât even try
