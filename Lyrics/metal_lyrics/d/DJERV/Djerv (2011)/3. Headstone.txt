When, when will, when will I, when are you gonna die?
Oh, got to track you down, whoâs got who now?

Now, now we, now we will, now Iâll have a blast
Bang! That was fast, I got you
Bang! That was fast, we ainât through

Iâm coming for your headstone
Bringing a crew or doing it alone
Coming for your headstone
They wonât refuse, I donât dig my part on my own
We got a big one for me, head over here, new higher throne
Iâm coming for your headstone

This I do, will I do, well this I do too
Oh, got to drag it home, makes my bedroom
Over the hills, fighting a guard, working it here in your backyard
Done it before, this I do well, making a bed, itâs hard as hell
But I like it this way, all my trophies will stay
Gather again, all of my men, forward!

Iâm coming for your headstone
Bringing a crew or doing it alone
Coming for your headstone
They wonât refuse, I donât dig my part on my own
We got a big one for me, head over here, new higher throne
Iâm coming for your headstone

Now I know the shame is like the fear, you only feel it once

Iâm coming for your headstone
Bringing a crew or doing it alone
Coming for your headstone
They wonât refuse, I donât dig my part on my own
We got a big one for me, head over here, new higher throne
Iâm coming for your headstone
