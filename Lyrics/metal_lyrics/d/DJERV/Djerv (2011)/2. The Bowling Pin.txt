Iâm the one to say Iâm sorry if Iâm wrong, but none of this seems like a crime to me
Itâs morbid, but it must be done
Nothing heard, nothing said, one more purist is dead
In the corner thereâs a Roman dwarf, turning into a horse

Call them in
World is moving at my will
Boredomâ¦
Call them in
Is taking up their time, until I call them in

Turn out the light now, theyâre still moving

Push that pedal to the floor, hit and run, you are my bowling pin
When that bastardâs driving, I can call myself a heroine
This is the highlight of your life, this is where white trash fails
We donât do curses in remorse

Itâs so kind of you to visit me in my loneliness, I understand
You see, itâs not the first time for me
Iâve already turned my back to you, to get a stab, then a kiss, youâre loving this
It has to wait, itâs you you hate

Call them in
Words are meaningless until I say them
Call them in
But youâve been called upon to sin
I call you in

Push that pedal to the floor, hit and run, you are my bowling pin
When that bastardâs driving, I can call myself a heroine
This is the highlight of your life, this is where white trash fails
We donât do curses in remorse
