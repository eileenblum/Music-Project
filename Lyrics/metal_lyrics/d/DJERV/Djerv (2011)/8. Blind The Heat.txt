We want you both, weâll make sure we get you
Wait for the darkness to blind the heat, you never thought about that fatal deed
He walked in on what he created, drugged her down, then couldnât live with himself
Listen brother, I will not let you break down, what if there is no more fun to have in this town

We will always be the low-life breeders, youâre in it
Get up, hey, get up, hey, get up, hey, pay up, hey

Get bored, fill it up, itâs all there is when youâre grounded
Suck it in, this is your ritual, ah, you think Iâm louder, wonder if youâll live the day
Weâll visit you tonight with a dark tale, itâs when you feel youâre blood is starting to boil
Here comes the part where you lower her coffin, we do enjoy the misery of you all

We will get it done, both of them, now gone
A silent witness in mind, two new bugs weâll find

Iâve done it to this song, but Iâve never been place where the air is wearing thin
They waited for my wave, can you hear my call turns into a scream?
We will get it done, both of them, now gone
A silent witness in mind, two new bugs weâll find

We will always be the low-life breeders, youâre in it
Get up, hey, get up, hey, get up, hey, pay up, hey
