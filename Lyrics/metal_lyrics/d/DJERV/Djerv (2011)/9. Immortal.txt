Win or die, buried alive, I killed your dog tonight, faceless
Win or die, dig start to fry, Iâll eat your dog tonight, faceless
I put my lips around the meat, a bird of evil omen's heat, too long Iâve been waiting
Win or die, eye for an eye, Iâll burn your soul tonight, you wonât see me faceless

Fear the light, a mortal combat, walk into the nest and start a fight
I do, I always let you in
Fear the light, a mortal combat, get the cue and go into the nightâ¦nightâ¦

Win or die, yeah start to cry, Iâll eat you any day, headless
Scan the crowd, fearless and proud, always ahead of you, you wonât see me faceless
I put my lips around the meat, a bird of evil omen's heat, too long Iâve been waiting

Fear the light, a mortal combat, walk into the nest and start a fight
I do, I always let you in
Fear the light, a mortal combat, get the cue and go into the nightâ¦nightâ¦
