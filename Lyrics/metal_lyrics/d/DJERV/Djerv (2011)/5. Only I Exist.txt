In bed, you love me, Iâm old with you
I mind you leave me, fluid flow, I aim for this
Now let it be the both of you, your sister, a broken child
I say youâll have me, you win this first time, take your bow

Given a scene from the state youâre in
Iâd like you to pose right now
Given a scene from the state youâre in
Iâd like you to pose for me now

And now I leave you lying, there on the floor
Heavy crosses flying, I need to go

Too late to have me, the cross is miles away
This leaves you empty, but come on, you only made me moan

Given a scene from the state youâre in
Iâd like you to pose right now
Given a scene from the state youâre in
Iâd like you to pose for me now

Morphine, into this, the shit you want me in
Do only I exist here? Were you with me?
And now I leave you lying, there on the floor
Heavy crosses flying, I need to go
