They had to let her fill in, deceitful words
I kissed her cold lips, need to show I deliver
I loved her endlessly, what has she done, they have to know Iâm alive
Every legend has an end

In a wooden bed, never so mislead
Oh, bravery, donât leave me so easily

I had to make my way out, there was no door
Fury remains around me, your dog, Iâm sure
I used a bone, got through the lid, the mud and out
Oh, murder like yours, they wonât be seeing you again

End your story, never ending mine, Iâll be around and Iâll be digging you
Bring you down to meet the evil hound, you had your time, tasted the wine
Now itâs gone
Howling wind
One less twin

Day, youâll pray, today youâll pray
The nails in place, letâs do it your fine way
This was a brutal one, admire what weâve done
Oh, victory, youâll go to hell with me

End your story, never ending mine, Iâll be around and Iâll be digging you
Bring you down to meet the evil hound, you had your time, tasted the wine
Now itâs gone
Howling wind
One less twin
