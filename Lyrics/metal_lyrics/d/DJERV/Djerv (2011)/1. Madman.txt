Madman!!!

Jump the gun, never-ending madness, you know who's soon to appear
Your vote, you left it, you filthy scum, I don't see why you are here
I know the end to this, I know the end to this
Now, why would I let you in, a sting of death
Now, why would I let you in?

Let her in, let me see her eyes, fat, sad-faced Japanese whore
And through the wall came a black-headed one, gritting her teeth on the floor
I thought I ended this, I thought I ended this
Head up your ass and see if it fits
I play the record for you, you sing along on the hits

You got the grin, now put your mind into it then you are in
Down, sword in your hand and draw it, fight or fall, do as I command

Tear 'em down, put the fattie on fire, tension is a killer and that girl is tense
When my mouth is moving, yours doesn't, you fool, one day wonder, suck it up, it's cruel
I can't believe you madman, you brought la diabla in a van
Now, why would I let you in, delivery man
That's why I will let you in

You got the grin, now put your mind into it then you are in
Down, sword in your hand and draw it, fight or fall, do as I command

There you were years ago, I'm always here to let you know
You won't ever see the entrance to my wonder world
I'll let you goâ¦

Down, sword in your hand and draw it, fight or fall, do as I command
