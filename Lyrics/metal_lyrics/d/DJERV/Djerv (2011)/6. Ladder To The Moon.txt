Back on the field, a blow and then Iâll end it
This is for real, Iâve brought my animal kit, feed me
Being betrayed, Iâll bring the beef into my home
Now letâs get laid, I change from wolf into Jerome

Going to face the war, youâre on the death roll
Iâm gonna pull you out, itâs gonna be so solid, goddess shout
If you donât get it now, youâre on the death roll
I know the smell of you, Iâm far from faking, rather overdue

Guilty again, Iâll build a ladder to the moon
Then lick your blood, my friend
Got one more duel coming up soon, shoot me

I always end it, the taste is now the same
The taste is now theâ¦

Going to face the war, youâre on the death roll
Iâm gonna pull you out, itâs gonna be so solid, goddess shout
If you donât get it now, youâre on the death roll
I know the smell of you, Iâm far from faking, rather overdue

Yeah, again

I always end it, the taste is now the same
The taste is now theâ¦

Going to face the war, youâre on the death roll
Iâm gonna pull you out, itâs gonna be so solid, goddess shout
If you donât get it now, youâre on the death roll
I know the smell of you, Iâm far from faking, rather overdue

(Say you will so, telling the other one that all is mine)
Going to face the war, youâre on the death roll
Iâm gonna pull you out, itâs gonna be so solid, goddess shout
