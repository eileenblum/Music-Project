[Music: BrÃ¤ndstrÃ¶m]

This life was thrown
Out to the elements for failure
This life was over before it had its time
The distance blurred the edges
And sickened the resolve
Our overturned perception
Held forgotten virtues true

We failed to hold our promise
Of never letting go
The doubt is now inoperable
As faith is to the blind
Man-made virus of deception
We must vaccinate the mind
Alter our climate
Tune the world to our will

The dust has settled in
The broken structure
Is now one with
This shattered beauty
In timeless indifference
Become one, become none

The upturned soil, the reversed sky
Mock with promise of our last hope
Skybound in our will
We seep beneath the surface layer
Become one, become none
