[Music: BrÃ¤ndstrÃ¶m]

So after all that has been said
Can we find a way back to when
The days were ours to take
And nothing ever hurt,
And we failed to offer or forgive?

Reach out for the favors
Take down the hopeful light
For even the broken, even the broken break

In the silence that only you know
What hides in the emptiness that only you know?
When the night is long and the will is weak
Even the broken break.

It is a pain you will never know
Held up to a light you once shone
For every hour in my head the mind distorts
So what can the broken ever say?

Phase out the noise pollution
Tune out of insanity's dream
Take the hopeless, take the hopeless down

In the silence that only you know
What hides in the emptiness that only you know?

In that darkness that only you know
In the silence that only you know
What hides in the emptiness that only you know?
