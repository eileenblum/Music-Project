[Stanne, Mikael Bengt / BrÃ¤ndstrÃ¶m, Martin / Jivarp, Anders / Sundin, Niklas Bo / Henriksson, Martin]

To connect
And make sense of it all
We draw lines
Through the chaos within
We measure what is everything but real
On a crooked scale

Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Shape it in our image
The science of noise

Fill in the blanks
And avert the gaze
Descend upon
Those who trespass against us

Torn from the sheltering safety of faith
As crooked as they come

Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Shape it in our image
The science of noise

One clear cut line
That separates it all

We challenge the void
To bare it secret beyond

We look until we see
What our truth now will be

Now
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Bend it to our will
Dream it into form
Shape it in our image
The science of noise
