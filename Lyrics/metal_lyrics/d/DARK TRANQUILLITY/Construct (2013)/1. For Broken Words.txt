[Music: Jivarp / BrÃ¤ndstrÃ¶m]

[Whispering:]
No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie

It twists and turns
Into something that is not to be
What truth is left
Was abandoned as the lines flew by

Our words are broken
Commit to sacrifice
Betrayal of the code
Thrust into nothingness
No truth, no lie

Our words are broken

Our subconscious bias
Confirmed what we already believe
There is no message
There is no value
We give shelter to our false ideas

Commit to sacrifice
Betrayal of the code
Thrust into nothingness

Tear our thoughts into splinters
Stab the sense
That's forced to remember
Our words get thrown
Out of focus
As we test our will
Dissolve to nothing

Break all bounds of unfair holding
Track this line to journey's end
We're breaking
We're breaking down

Our words are broken
Commit to sacrifice
Betrayal of the code
Thrust into nothingness
No truth, no lie

...our sacrifice
...betray the code
...into nothingness
