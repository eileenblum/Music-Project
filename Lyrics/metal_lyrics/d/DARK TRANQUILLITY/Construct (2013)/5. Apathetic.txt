[Music: Sundin]

Take the loss to heart
A new beginning
Start anew
Apocalyptic bliss
Lost to the hours
Bare essential needs
Succumb to this
Non-reality

Sometimes I feel
What silence best describes
Sometimes I feel
Apathetic to this life
Turn your back
On helpless failures past
Awakening
Shut the mind
To equal parts of nothing
Reality now
Wicked
The sense of nothing lost
Will of the steerless ones

Face away
From the garish light of day
Remembering
Something I supposed
To have believed
Reality now
Face away?
