Uncontrolled spaces
Lifeless âtil provoked
Deep uncharted oceans
Nonexistent âtil claimed
Great raging fires
Silent

When there is no one
When no one is mine
The no one is me
The no one is me
Me, me, me, me

Tall reaching branches
Pointless to even try
Countless flaming cities
Measured without cost
All-seeing eyes
Without stories to tell

Inside the orchard there's a scent of devilry
As was in my heart
(The sweetness overripe)
Rancid in attempt to overcome the shackles
If only the soil could hold

When there is no one
When no one is mine
The no one is me

And when there is no one
When no one is mine
The no one is me

And when there is no one
When no one is mine
The no one is me
The no one is me

And when there is no one
When no one is mine
The no one is me
The no one is me

The wide open wound
Won't heal without purpose
It never stops
The wide open wound
That never heals
The no one is me
The no one is me
