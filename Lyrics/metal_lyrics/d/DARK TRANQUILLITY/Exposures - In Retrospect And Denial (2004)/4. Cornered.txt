There never was a night like this
How could there ever be?
Through sweat and velvet misery
The fever-race in me

Cornered in symmetrical design
Sphere-like chrome on a sea enraged
Hatred

What the mirror sees
Is the clutching at straws, auh
Taking us under
The storm of the ocean
This velvety crush
Ring-corners, firm in the outrage
Synoptic patterns
Waves contort
Break into these cellular walls

Whyâ¦

Globes of disease
Infest my dreams
Burning the ends of my veins

Oh!

Pattern and form
The squares cling fast
Dance the tide now

Could never bear another night
Although i know it will come
The freezing ends of what is me
The icing rages free

Cornered in symmetrical design
Sphere-like chrome on a sea enraged
Hatred

Take hold of the boundaries
On this perimeter sea
Burn, enflame the oppressors
And if four was one
In a corner alone
Recovering, licking the wounds
Delirium coming
The weakness kicks in
Reforming, cornered within
