Nothing of a man was he
His true face of sleep a deception
Fell through all the way to the bottom
Learned to hold

Again we vowed not to hold sacred
But to damn that hollow gaze
Unsteady on these shorelines
Mute to an unthought scream
Another word fell silent
Like the static in their eyes
Against all fleeing logic
We let our minds go blank

Why define ourselves by misguiding light?
How can we receive the static in their eyes

Each blink of light an accuser
Each unlit shape an assassin

Crawled the outer rim
With his back exposed
The shadows unending
Fought off the stares

Again we vowed not to hold sacred
But to damn that hollow gaze
Unsteady on these shorelines
Mute to an unthought scream
Another word fell silent
Like the static in their eyes
Against all fleeing logic
We let our minds go blank

Nullify the ego, stay right back
Stay right back
How can we receive the static?

Uh!

Fear that strangles spirit
Denial speaks the truth
Fear that strangles spirit
Crushes me and you

Wicked are the senses,
Wicked are the words
Give me the static

Again we vowed not to hold sacred
But to damn that hollow gaze
Unsteady on these shorelines
Mute to an unthought scream
Another word fell silent
Like the static in their eyes
Against all fleeing logic
We let our minds goâ¦ blank
