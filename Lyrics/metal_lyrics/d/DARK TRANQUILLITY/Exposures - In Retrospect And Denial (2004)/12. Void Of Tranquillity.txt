[Lyrics: Sundin, Stanne]

In orbit they pass around youâthe memories from abandoned past
Images from within your mind bring unknown feelings into your veins

Delve into thy twilight past, a voyage done before
The borderland 'twixt life and deathâexisting evermore
Emerging from material guiseâan ever-living soul
Thy spirit lives forever more, in spite of aim or goal

The forces of your vital mind determinates vaguely
As you're about to pass away the darkness that
Surrounds you fades...

You reach out to touch, to feel the eternal
Forgiveness for thy impure soul
Desperation fills your mindâapproach the centre
Centre of infernal salvation and infernal death

Enter to the plain of life, to knowledge loomed through time
An ever-living certainty where life is formed to chime
Foolishness and wisdom walk gently hand, hand in hand
Embraced in darkest universe as contraries blend as one

Fear fills your mind on this ongoing journey
Journey to a thousand secrets untold
Credulous at first to this place of wonder
Wonder's so realâit could be an illusion

Through dark veils of destinyârealm of shades revealed
Through dark veils of destinyâinfinite life concealed

Your soul now levitates slowly and below your body fades
Your consciousness remains but thy skin will soon rot away
Visions from an obscure reality appear as your soul departs
This once so undisturbed and now frail and feeble world

Brought forth, the abyss now appearsâ
Foulmouthed temptations call me near
Dark visions laughing over meâif swallowed I will cease to be
Tempted to this world beyondâeager to break the bond
The sacred promise of an earthly stayânow broken as you writhe in dismay

Come to where all life descends in brimful harmony
Cautious, interlacing, they engrave what they shall be
All bounds cannot be broken or confusion will prevail
- lifeless dark eternity of chaos and despair

Indescribable light descends between spheres
Spheres that behold that nondescript fear
Thought of the sins that were done in the past
The past is forgotten and the present will last

Through dark veils of destinyârealm of shades revealed
Through dark veils of destinyâinfinite life concealed

Floating through these halls of light, emotions burst within
Pure beauty of divinity enrobes remaining sin
Alone, enthralled, I bow this force, paternal majesty
Freed from anguish, freed from hateâinto my destiny

Into the void of tranquillity

Through the rise and fall of worlds, one greater mind prevails
Conjuring new creations as it watches the old ones fail
Eternal coil of time and placeâreality and tale
The answers to all questions hide within this astral vale

Passed through tranquillityâaeons now flow away
Claimants of destinyâdeath can no more hold sway

Forced to returnâdeparture of soul
Material worldâarrival as told
