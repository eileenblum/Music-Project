Enthroned through this age of confusion an urge,
He weakness and flooy since aeons emerged,
Created life in fetters from cradle to grave
A future in darkness with mankind enslaved

Trail of life decayedâwasteland wall prevail
Hatred lies in storeâchaos evermore

So runs the spiel from where lives are found and lost:
"Learn from past failuresâprevent to pay the cost"

Sunlight fades as nightfall rises in shadows formed in clay
What once dwelt shall dwell no more when darkness sees the day
A bleakwinter of enmity and terror shall take form
What man created will be ruined when hate conjures the storm

When our time spells an end to our ruling of this earth,
Will a wasteland remain?
Will all life cease to be by the wicked ways of man
- his enfeebled domain?

Nature left in flamesâsuffering, now to maim
Cataclysm at handâunveiled unto man

So runs the spiel from where lives are lost and found:
"Progression in spirit eliminates all bounds"

Sunlight fades as nightfall rises in shadows formed in clay
What once dwelt shall dwell no more when darkness sees the day
A bleakwinter of enmity and terror shall take form
What man created will be ruined when hate conjures the storm

Hallow minds start to burn with the flaming shades of fall
Let disorder arise!
An avenge to be brought to the ones who graveled earth
Hides now cloaked in disguise

Blind deception, mass confusionâinterbreeding dark illusions
Tumbling, falling, brings conclusions -
Constant fatal life-corrosion

Autumnâbeckons forth the
Winterârising gloom in hand
Raging with bleak coldness 'til
Vernal light commands

Final chapter closedâworld devoid of use
Failure brings despairâdeath reveals its lair

Sunlight fades as nightfall rises in shadows formed in clay
What once dwelt shall dwell no more when darkness sees the day
A bleakwinter of enmity and terror shall take form
What man created will be ruined when hate conjures the storm
