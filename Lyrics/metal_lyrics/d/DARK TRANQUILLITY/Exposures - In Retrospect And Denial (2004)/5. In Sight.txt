We are to be something here again
We are to play soldiers now, pretend
We are born inside these endless halls of shame
We are jaded by the error-ways of man

It doesn't make us strong
It doesn't make us strong
The things that I find stranger here
Will not let us in
Will not let us in
Show me, I won't tell
And even if I go today
And understand, understand

We are to be something we are not
We are to repeat our faults my friend
We are taken down from sanity's lonely heights
We are shown the downward spiral ways of man

It doesn't make us strong
It doesn't make us strong
These things that I find stranger here
Will not let us in
No, they will not let us in
Oh, show me, I won't tell
'cause even if I die today
And understand, understand, oh-oh
