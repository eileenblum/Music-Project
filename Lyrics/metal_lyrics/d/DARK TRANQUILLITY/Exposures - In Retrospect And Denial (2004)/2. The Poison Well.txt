Unless another wall is breaking
Nothing can come of this elusive
Against our better judgment
Our image to stand ground
Turn around and

Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes
Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes
Nobody ever goes, oh

With ideals as infestations
Hinder the radical mind
Re-tune our aim
Now it's time for hiding
For it stabs fear in you
So coward

Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes
Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes
Nobody ever goes

Uh!
A thought to infect you
An idea to perfect you

A flesh to restrain you
No heart to forgive you

The poison well
I dried

Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes
Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes
Nobody ever goes

Uh-oh!
