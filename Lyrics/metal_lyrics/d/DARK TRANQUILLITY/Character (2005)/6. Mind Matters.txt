You are all that matters in my private demonology

Those who fail us now
The sons of wishes
The bastard child of dream
Enemies of hope

Let it be gone
It's all pretend

Mind matters, matters not

Never again
In perfect clarity
See the day in childlike vision

Where does it lead from here?
On without that guidance
Disaster role model without a part
Our search is wider

Cast off those wide-eyed hopes and dreams

Mind matters, matters not

No need to see you there
The path we made is clear
Just stay ahead of me
This is not for me to see

Mind matters, matters not

This time a prayer onto nothing
Project again
Direct oppose to action

All across the board
Shortcomings close to call
Let it be gone
It's all pretend

Mind matters, matters not
