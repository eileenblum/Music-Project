You try to hide the fact
Hidden from yourself
Your own favourite entertainer
Is none other than the one we call you
And you need the others to fortify your disgust for the worst of us
To the rest of us

Now, entertain the thought that we are still alive
Entertain the notion of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions and our fears
Just pull us in and take us down

I hear a mighty cheer
Your faith could not be any stronger
In your head the stage is set
A product of what we're being fed
Oblivious by design
Not susceptible to any mind

Entertain the thought that we are still alive
Entertain the notion of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions and our fears
Just pull us in and take us down

I can take what's being given
I can down whatever comes
I will do what you deem necessary

My fear compels me
My fear compels me

No more fictitious needs
I will not be made a mockery
No more chaos seed
I am not what you're supposed to see

No
Without a sense of danger
Everything is lost
In the name of entertainment
We are doomed

Entertain the thought that we are still alive
Entertain the notion of impending doom
Entertain our worst suspicions and our fears
Just pull us in and take us down
