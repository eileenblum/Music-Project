The unsaid tone of weak despair
Fail to resonate
Frayed ends of our binding
Threads will disintegrate

Now
By laws our physiques state
Failure to communicate
None too sentient
Hear no, see no works its magic
Against all function

Ongoing choices the trials will end
Filter the nonsense and laugh at what's left
Indecision / nonvision
What matters taken away

Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over
Lost to apathy

So overcome with pointless tears
To test pain receptors
Nothing matters ever here
Put up a non-reaction

These eyes will never see
Covered up from reality

Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over
Lost to apathy

[Solo]

The unknown world that you deny
No priority
Cannot fail if you never start
How predictable

I want to know where did it end
For madness to start
Always the skeptic
And never be part

Introvertive
Non-descriptive
It matters not
Not

Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak

We areâ¦

Look at the shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak
Soon the battle is over
Lost to apathy

The shell that is you
Empty, fragile, weak
Now the battle is over
Lost to apathy
