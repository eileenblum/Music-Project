It's all this reeking ego
Craves the sun to never set
Why do threads of anger never linger
Why does the ember turn to stone?

To where the longing goes in
With the sins of old
A face of nothing
To never see as blind as free

[Solo]

Everything I want is in the end of this
Everything I need will be the end of me

My negation
How will you know my name
And sense the danger coming?
My negation
How can you see my face?
What's to become of me?

Oh, the art of reduction
Stripped down through what seems defendable
Scaled to bare revisions
To stop making sense

Leveling pillars of towering fear
Rational instincts and insight to spare
End of falseness
End of grace

Everything I fear is in this failing
Nothing of what I am is in this end

My negation
How will you know my name
And sense the danger coming?
My negation
How can you see my face?
What's to become of me?

Will you know my name?
