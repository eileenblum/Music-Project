It comes from all we're giving
In seemingly endless supply
As signals cross defiantly
Into this volatile mix

We charge
And the stubborn mind repeats the errors
To challenge our grounds
Either soar above
Or the detour takes you right back down now
To where no one wants to see
Misgivings in this starry night lights
Fill in the blanks that one will fall
To the haunts and horrors
To the haunts and horrors

Now there is nothing left
A mere shadow
When adrenaline runs dry
There is nothing there
An empty prop
When adrenaline runs dry

It gets you deep down low now
As they told you of the blazing heights
The stage from which the world is viewed
Is the mirror to shatter the image

The crypt he kept for hiding
Retreat from another attack
Pointlessly forgiving
A refuge in deceptive black

It works within the system and they won't understand
A lesser known deceiver will fool you even more

[Solo]

Now, now, now, now taunt the wasted
It's all about nothing
What to squeeze within the span of attention
Brought to ground
Let the chaos pass

That one will fail by the screams and terrors
By the screams and terrors

Now there is nothing left
A mere shadow
When adrenaline runs dry
Now there is nothing there
An empty prop
When adrenaline runs dry
