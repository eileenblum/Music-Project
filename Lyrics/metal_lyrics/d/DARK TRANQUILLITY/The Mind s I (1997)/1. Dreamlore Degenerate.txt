[Music: Henriksson, Sundin]
[Lyrics: Stanne]

For thou sweepst me in thy robe of guilt
with garments forged in spiteful steel
No tainted pride shall make conviction cease

For none shall be unto thee proven
worthy of thy outmost fear
Let alone the silent longing
instinct shun the ones you dear

As the hunter boldly stalks his prey - intoxicated
Conviction reigns where truth might sway - intimidated

Silence the bore
You shun the ones you dear

The hunt is over
so the feast begins
What feast is enduring when all is said and done?
Everchange of hearts

The hunter's reason fail
The hunt is treason

The hunt is over
so the feast begins
Why search for endurance when all is said and done?
