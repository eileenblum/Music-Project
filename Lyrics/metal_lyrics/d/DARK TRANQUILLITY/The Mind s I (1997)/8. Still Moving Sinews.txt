[Music: Sundin, Johansson]
[Lyrics: Sundin, Stanne]

No one survives such an attack
We all stood like monuments baring the nails in her back
Still moving sinews
in a graceful impression of life
shyly the arms, shyly the breasts
fold, fear, die

Ten fingers driven through the heart, through the core
I stare into these strange, magnetic eyes
and wonder, wonder for you, wonder for me
are the demons there?

I knew it all the time:
The misanthropes were right
to crucify themselves in the need of a saviour.
Still moving sinews struggle fearsome with a lifeline forlorn,
caught in the nest of the impending dark fate.

Ten fingers driven through the heart, through the core
I stare into these strange, magnetic eyes
and wonder, wonder for you, wonder for me
are the demons there?

Semi-worlds, lifetight lodges
where our faces stiffen,
plagued with the frost of disease
Our capsules barely meet

The worms of disorder like living black numbers that drip from her pergament skin
Joined in sweet fury to anoint the decay fragile and reddened in lifelost array

Ten fingers driven through the heart, through the core
I stare into these strange, magnetic eyes
and wonder, wonder for you, wonder for me
are the demons there?

Joined in sweet fury to anoint the decay
