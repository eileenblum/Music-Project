[Music: Henriksson]
[Lyrics: Stanne]

Fast fading roses
Non-lingering words
Scythe be my instrument
Through dreams I now rage

No guidance is me offered
No forgiveness thee is promised
Now will distance be a factor
when engraved in me thou art?
engraved in me thou art?

Your soul shall serve to nourish the torch of the earth

Denial serves me
Denial serves me right
Denial serves me to the end of time
it serves me right

That fire cannot burn
with flames of no origin
That star cannot bring guidance
without force or form

Denial serves me
Denial serves me right
Denial serves me when ... pledge

sweet silence and darkness
Without silence the darkness loses its splendour

Sweet bliss that sleep now giveth
tempt with forgetful night
Ever haunting that image within
swear to the answers denied
