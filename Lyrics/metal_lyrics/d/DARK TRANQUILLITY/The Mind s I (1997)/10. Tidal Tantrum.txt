[Music: Johansson]
[Lyrics: Stanne]

Come death or dearling
the claws of the raven hold fast
Enticed and starving
Lustful revenge to the last

Unlight flood the seeker's eye

Come flame or false hope
gifted in spirit as I
Forced upon freedom
Let impulse nor stillness be spared

Fierce tidal tantrum
nourishing rapture within

Come feast or fire
repellent in forceful defence
Unchained, forgiving to none
solemn in swirling embrace
