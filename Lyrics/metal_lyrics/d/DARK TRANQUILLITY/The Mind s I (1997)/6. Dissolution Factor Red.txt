[Music: Johansson, Sundin]
[Lyrics: Sundin, Stanne]

Drenched in the perfume of hell
Impasto of burning oils
forming continents on my outstretched naked body,
erupting

crimson
stains of shame
stains of shame

Limbs that leave their nests of red
to spin the reels of pain
Attach the nails and electrodes

and spin the reels again

Retreating hunger running through the years
carries the scorn on skeleton wings

Storm me, thou with the sharpened claw
swift hammer nails that pierce the shoulder of time
Behind the sunset, with movement regained

For there lie shadows even farther from the light
Farther from the light

I run,
Devoid of motion, devoid of name
attach the nails and electrodes

black moratorium, haven of refuge
