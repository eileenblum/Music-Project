[Music: Sundin, Johansson]
[Lyrics: Stanne]

With each daring new concept, creation and form
one fragment of shelter from heaven be torn

The bleeding through barriers
shine of redemption
The taste of renewal
let art once again be a weapon

The whim of the forger is theft from the flow
the hatchet now reddened with creation's blood

Constant is forever

I am the creation
so bold in design
The errors of one thousand minds
bleed out through a world gone blind

This is the magic that a name would stain.
