[Music: Henriksson, Sundin]
[Lyrics: Sundin]

Enter suicidal angels;

How hungry we've become;
like animals naked in shame
Fed with the tongues of apocalypse
that galloped down disordered worlds behind

From word to a word I was led to a word
that spanned over cultures in rage
Crimson masses, steeped in decadence
holding our tongues to the thirsty sun
So, is the future still open?
(so tell me, tell me)
Then enter, hornet, from our hive-dark hearts
And draw down the end from within

We need not the horns
That emanate from our dying, haunted bodies
severed and numbered they are

Nihilist, Hedon
the priceless art of their lives
Sorrow is a wing laid atop their heads.
skin deep, we carve our immeasurable sorrow
in the fold of your shivering arms

How hungry we've become
Like animals naked in shame
Fed with the hooves of apocalypse
That galloped down disordered worlds behind

Hedon,
Your children wild
and filled with death

# Jupiter in our unforgiving eyes:
a pandemonium of bodies and gold
Eager, as a part of your face
and the sickness attached to your skin (stone)
As the wine rush,
Charging from androgynous wombs
to open free the lid of pain #

Hedon,
rinsed in post-human shadows
a monument scorned by the teeth of time
Stale-faced keeper of secrets,
loaded with implosive fire
the whore that carried the apostle
to the mating point on the graves of giants

We look at you,
afraid to see what we really are.
