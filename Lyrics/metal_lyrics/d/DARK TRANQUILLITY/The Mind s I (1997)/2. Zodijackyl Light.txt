[Music: Sundin, Johansson]
[Lyrics: Stanne]

Crown the impulse that deliberately falls
Defeat in spiritless action â isolation
 burn the greenwood
Order of the vertical path

Descendent â crawl in the remnants of one thousand lies
Restaging â torching a world that was left behind
Zodijackyl light

Cross the sharpest void
Deride the embers of his faith
The bringer that on million horses ride

Waiting for the call within, the spark of sin
Ever reminiscent of the coming of storm
Can you see the cosmic face in which disorder lies?

Burning of oppression
Burning the inventors
Burning is the killing hand
Be that of the darkest sin
To frustrate hope and love

I shall not be blinded
I shall not be forced

Resistance
Feasting on debris from celestial wars

Burning in the sky
Beyond the realm of time
Sequence of the nucleus
The glowing dust in flight
Zodijackyl light

And they ride, they ride
The drama takes the lead
And they ride, they ride
The beast of heaven their guide

Racing through the vastness
Constellation disarray
That dark should not have existed
That bares no witness to the light

I shall not be blinded
I shall not be forced

Sweet endless
Perpetually plunge through interior vaults
So seamless
Joints of time cannot shackle the beast

Zodijackyl light.
