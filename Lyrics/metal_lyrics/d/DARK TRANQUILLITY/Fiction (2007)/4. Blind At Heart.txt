I tell you here
Of all the crimes and hours broken
What never came, will never be the same
Uh, I tell you this, I tell you what

The mind that has been flooded
All the exits sealed
A poison set to enter
The unforgiving me

Probes and infiltrators
Infiltrate me

It's in these hours we forget ourselves (forget ourselves)
Within a fire that consumes itself (consumes itself)â¦ Go

No need for your defences
My angerwall will hold
Take your steady pride
In monotony and beat

Invaders and corruptors
Invade me

It's in these hours we forget ourselves (forget ourselves)
And never again (never again)
Within a fire that consumes itself (consumes itself)

A super nova of flame on fire
This broken spirit, blind at heart

[Solo]

Bite down hard on frustration
The siege that can't be broken
This hollow flame of fear
Uh, I tell you this, I tell you what

So close without connection
Locked inside the sphere
I take the blame upon me
And scream at what I see

I'm blind at heart
So blind at heart

It's in these hour we forget ourselves (forget ourselves)
And never again (never again)
Within a fire that consumes itself (consumes itself)
