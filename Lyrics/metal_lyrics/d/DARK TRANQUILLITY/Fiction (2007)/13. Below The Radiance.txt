[Expanded Edition Track][Music: Henriksson, Jivarp. Lyrics: Stanne]

I don't mind the fall
It's the climb from the bottom
That hurts the most
Here today
A stab of emptiness
Divert your eyes
From the judgemental stares
So non-forgiving
Yet what do they know
And what have they seen
I cannot do it

I plunge myself against these rocks of ice
Go!
Hell-driven hounds now on my trail

To play a part
Uphold a bland facade
Do the expected
If only nothing remained
Of facts and furies
These are the seconds
That will not be forgotten
This is the time
What have I done
What do they know
I cannot do it

I plunge myself against these rocks of ice
Go!
Hell-driven hounds now on my trail

[Solo]

Eyes on the prize
Yet never tell them
In shadows hide it
What eyes can tell
How well you know
Familiar urges
Is the same old place
Where you will know it
And they will pay
They will pay

Hell-driven hounds now on my trail
I plunge myself against these rocks of ice
