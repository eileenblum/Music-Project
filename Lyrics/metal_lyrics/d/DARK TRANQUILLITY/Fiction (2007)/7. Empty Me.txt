What night never abandoned
In shallow darkness dwell
The evidence in pools of black
Light cannot penetrate, light cannot penetrate

Uh, have you come for my forgiveness?
There's nothing left to give
No response to your repentance
This empty me

Lifted from the living days
To be bent right out of shape
Let blades and satisfires
Cut and lick these wounds
In reversal of repentance
This bastard son of lies
To bring meaning to it all, meaning to it all

Uh, have you come for my forgiveness?
There's nothing left to give
No response to your repentance
This empty me

Take now from this body
A coward's heart
And a soul beyond repair
Empty me

[Solo]

Between insecurity and reason
Self deprecation as a means to the end
Out of reach but never closer
A cure that searches for the cause of this
Cause for chaos

Uh, have you come for my forgiveness?
There's nothing left to give
No response to your repentance
This empty me

Drawn from memories the fragments linger
On ages of thought and seconds of sleep
What is it here that tempts the night
To stab the day and kill the light
