[Japanese Bonus Track]As in the life of rain
You're only alive when you're falling
The coldest chill
In the emptiness of reason

You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
With nothing to gain
You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
It begins today

So light up the days
With the darkest of waking dreams
For endless puzzles
To reflect our aim

You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
With nothing to gain
You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
It starts today

It seems you've passed the mark
Of indescribable dark
I fear you've drowned
In hope of what you think will come

Extracted from the sharpest of moments
Built to greet you when the time will come
Empty spaces on foundations of denial
Your structure is dust

As in the death of dream
Awakenings will leave you stranded
Where no one is listening
Where no one is around

You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
With nothing to gain
You brought it upon yourself
It's slow but final
It begins today
