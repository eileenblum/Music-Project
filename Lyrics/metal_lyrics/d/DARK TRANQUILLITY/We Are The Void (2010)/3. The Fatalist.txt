Eventually they'll come
Your name has been called
Out for aeons
To claim the blood
And salvage what remains

For once we've seen the fragile nature
Of things behind these windows
Where nothing lives
And nothing ends

And seen what drives the hopeless
In between their closing yellowed walls

The day has come
You are the fatalist
The day has come
You are the fatalist
You walk on soil that dreams of blood

How can we fight fatigue
In pre-historic sorrow?
When all is preordained
The cycle never ends

What once had been an endless realm
Of possibility and dream
Now laid to waste and ruin
Laid to waste again
You wash your hands in blood

You squander time
We borrow from eternity
Is it another lame excuse?

The day has come
You are the fatalist
The day has come
You are the fatalist
You walk on soil that dreams of blood

You are the fatalist

[Solo]

If nothing changes
Then nothing ends

Your thoughts are broken
Your reasoning is flawed
The defense is just an act
And lies are all you've got

Now, you are the fatalist
You are the fatalist

How easy can we see?
Defeat behind your argument
The fatalistic smile

The day has come
You are the fatalist
The day has come
You are the fatalist
You walk on soil that dreams of blood

The day has come
The day has come
You walk the ground that screams for murder
