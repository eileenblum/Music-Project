Why do I see her, the never ending nights?
Why do I see her, wearing nothing but the dark?

Have you come here to warn me
Of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something
But you do not have the words

I know where you live
I can see it through your darkness
And when you sleep
I hear the heart that beats you

Have you come here to warn me
Of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something
But you do not have the words

Eyes far into the distance
A life that does not connect
Time played well its part
On the strings that bind us

[Solo]

Encounters in silence
Words elude the freeing night
Wish I could fathom
What is too hard to tell

Her head hangs low
In the silence of her room
Her head hangs low
She takes a bite out of her heart

Have you come here to warn me
Of what I cannot see
You want to tell me something
But you do not have the words
