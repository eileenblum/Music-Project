Do not hide your sorrow,
Or banish it from sight
Take it out to burn,
Turn the pain against it

In a day, that holds no other
What are we? The fuel or the flame?
In a life, that hides behind you
What are you? The fuel or the flame?

In the proud momentum,
Thrust ahead from the start
Our fragile fate falls apart

I hear you in my echo,
A few steps behind
I see you in my shadow, waiting inside

What if we don't question the meaning of it all?
The answer in our system
Bound to kill the spark

The moments so illusive
One dream never ends
Scorns the doubting nomads
That burn another trail

In a day that holds no other
What are we? The fuel or the flame?
In the life, that hides behind you
What are you?

The shine of trembling stars,
Out in the distant
Curse this lack of site,
Into darkness without end

In a day that holds no other
What are we? The fuel or the flame?
In a life that hides behind you
What are you? The fuel or the flame?

In a day that holds no other
What are we?
In a life that hides behind you
What are you? What are you?
