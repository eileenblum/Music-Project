What if you are an island of sorrow
Then I'll be the raging sea
What if you are the reaching trees
Then I'll be the storm that with fire rages

The new loneliness
Your name on the door
Just like a diagnose
For venomous disease

Man is the cemetery for unlived life
All for nought
The grand accusation

Your face is your name
Word and shield
Sharp as a curse

Man is the cemetery for unlived life
All for nought
The grand accusation

You chose rejection
Over thoughts of insight
You take action
From focus on intent
And brace for impact
Not waiting for the fall

What cries here, cries inside
Man is the cemetery of unlived life
The grand accusation

What if you were a country of grief
With me the invading force
What if you were to measure the hollow
That captivates and devours you

The new loneliness
Your name on the door
Just like a diagnose
For venomous disease

Man is the cemetery for unlived life
All for nought
