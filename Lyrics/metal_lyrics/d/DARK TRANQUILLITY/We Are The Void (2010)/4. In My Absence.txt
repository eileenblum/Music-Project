Now!

Eyes that meet to say farewell
And linger through the sleepless nights
A trail of days that end in tears
But I can never be there

The rush of hours that never seem to end
What life has dealt you can not comprehend
I am the absentee

I know you're out there searching tonight
I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see through your eyes,
I'm right here

How could I have known what preceded your own thoughts?
Wish that I could listen to what only speaks inside
Every raging dissonance
Each jarring note
But I could never be there

How could you think that I would understand
When words just go around what the heart truly wants?
I am the absentee

I know you're out there searching tonight
I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see through your eyes,
I'm right here

I want to tell you,
Of the exploding light
How everything is visible
Moments before the dark

[Solo]

I am never, never there

I know you're out there searching tonight
Another day and I'm not there

Thrust with nails of conflict
Anxiety and pain
Through spells of anger, confusion and defeat
I wish you'd see me here in front of you,
But I am not here

I know you're out there searching tonight
I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see though your eyes

I know your out there,
But I'm right here
Another day and I cannot see though your eyes,
Lead me right
