He takes a stand
And looks his enemy in the eye
This goes no further

I have the upper hand
This ends on my terms
I challenge non-existence
Every single day

The end of mind
End of freedom
End of everything

A most violent event
Breaks individuality
And turns out your shadow

Now, in devastating light
That push against our eyes
Now, a dance to the blood song
In dream oblivion

He makes a point
Of sticking to the lie

This is the last time
I am now done with this
I carry my nothing
Every single day

The end of mind
End of freedom
End of everything
The end of everything

Now with reality on end
The fall of all morality
A dance to the blood song

Now, in devastating light
That push against our eyes
Now, a dance to the blood song
In dream oblivion

The end of faith
End of meaning
End of everything

A most violent event
We dream oblivion
