[Limited and Tour Editions Bonus Track]We throw ourselves
Like rocks against the heavens
To call to us attention
And set our sights for higher ground

Weaved within the nervous system
Of our planet and the vows we keep
The dormant fragments
Of self-destructing code

Into the emptiness
Where fires cannot feed
No way to hold
The burden of love alive

We nod at each other from across the open plain grave
And go to memories to visit our own lives

[Solo]

You carry my life
Inside you my only witness

We hide in the bodies of greater beings
Together as one through endless trials

Into the emptiness
Where fires cannot feed
No way to hold
The burden of love alive
