[Tour Edition Bonus Track]Hey
What is your life about today?

A pit of emptiness
A close resemblance
To what you thought was right or wrong
You don't belong
The face you hold is false

Drawn to the darkest emotions
Sworn to the vortex of grief
Disguised as empathy
It's not supposed to be
I know you're faking it
So take a look around

Zero distance
From where do you see yourself?
Zero distance
How far are you willing to go?

A broken perspective
That you impose on the innocent
Your fallen set of standards

You go beyond what is decisively human
Take from others what you do not have
What you cannot own
Wear the mask
Be the mask

You hide behind
You're not supposed to see
I know you're faking it
So take a look around

Zero distance
From where do you see yourself?
Zero distance
How far are you willing to go?

Zero distance
Can you see what I see?
Zero distance
How far are you already gone?

To the end of what you fear
Take a hold of that utmost misery

Oh!

I want to see you show
Disgust for sympathy
Honour and bravery
I know you're faking it
So take a look around

Zero distance
From where do you see yourself?
Zero distance
How far are you willing to go?
