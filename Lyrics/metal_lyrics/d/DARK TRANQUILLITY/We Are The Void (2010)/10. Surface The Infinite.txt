It starts below
The pile and the burning darkness in the recipe
A fire of the soul
To paralyze and strangle hold

Disable the design
The remnants of reality
In our measured time
Is torn apart

We carry our fear inside,
A space that holds the darkness
We stretch our skin around,
To cover the abyss

The smirk on our reality
At the future we foresee
Blood that seeks redemption
In endless nights of sin
Spades without spears
That pierce the blinding sun

We heard from the heralds of grief
That nothing remains

We carry our fear inside,
A space that holds the darkness
We stretch our skin around,
To cover the abyss

Breaks into day
Upsets the system
It's in our nature
To bear the hidden to the end

[Solo]

What if this feeling contains the truth?
What if our dreams give way to the dogma of old?
What if lost desire can be found?

No shelter, no barriers between what's already inside
Betrays what the surface holds

We wear our lives
On waters and dust
Like daemons of the lost
Still wrapped in our own confusion,
The call of the abyss

We carry our fear inside,
A space that holds the darkness
We stretch our skin around,
To cover the abyss
