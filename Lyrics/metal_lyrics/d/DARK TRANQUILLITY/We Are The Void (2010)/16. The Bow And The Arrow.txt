[iTunes and Tour Editions Bonus Track]The print you left
Bear just witness
To the forceful push
With which you thrust yourself
Out from this world
Your own very being
Launched away from this
Temporary hold

You are never gone
The letters of your name
A scar that never heals

So be the bow and the arrow
Be the rope and the angered scream
As time now eats away
At the unmarked graves
And indifferent winds take speed
Over lands of uncertainty
To hold what can be held
Against the coming dark

In the minds of the hollow
Hollowed out
Your words rang once so true

You are never gone
The letters of your name
A scar that never heals
You are never gone
For you are ours now
We hold you in our hearts

There are still tremors
The occasional sparks
A voice unheard
From the empty void

We can still feel it
Your body turned loose in the darkness
Grief as the razor
Within these walls of skin
To the end of forever
To the end

You are never gone
The letters of your name
A scar that never heals

So be the bow and the arrow
Be the rope and the angered scream
You are never gone
As indifferent winds take speed
Over lands of uncertainty
You are never gone
