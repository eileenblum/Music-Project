Let the horizon lead
Onto the ether of the night
Draped across the burning heavens
Flying homeward like a bird of the soul

Shattered into a million brighter stars
Each flare unique and rare
Scattered across forever
Out from creation's core
An end beyond compare
Iridium

Now is the time to leave
We lie awake, we stand afire
At the edge of the world
Above a myriad of light
Below the mantle of the stars
As strangely they fall

Shattered into a million brighter stars
Each flare unique and rare
Scattered across forever
Out from creation's core
An end beyond compare
Iridium

[Solo]

Shattered into a million brighter stars
Each flare unique and rare
Scattered across forever
Out from creation's core
An end beyond compare
An end beyond compare
Iridium
