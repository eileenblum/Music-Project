[Japanese and Tour Editions Bonus Track]Each and every night
My heart shoulders the armour
And charges into the dark
To slay what took you from me
But there in the eye of the prey
I see my reflection
The armour now shatters to pieces
Until I hear the call again

Alone I set out to find you
Below the timeline
Alone and far from the stars
I walk out of gravity

As lightning scorns the night
And conspires with the sunken seas
Out there are hunters of the invisible
Tracking mere dust for days
On cracked soil now they walk
On ground that has lost its hold

Alone I set out to find you
Below the timeline
Alone and far from the stars
I walk the nether paths

In void-like silence
Through veins of man
A new disease breaks our ground
By venomous sorrow's hand

[Solo]

So steep my longing
I give in to vertigo
Whipping of cold black tongues
Poisons my wounds

Alone I set out to find you
Below the timeline
Alone and far from the stars
I walk out of gravity
