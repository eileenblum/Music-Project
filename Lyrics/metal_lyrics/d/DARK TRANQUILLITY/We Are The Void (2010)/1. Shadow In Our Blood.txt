We are delusional
To go against mortality
Still we fight, love and create
As the only creatures
In on life's grand secret
We sense the pointlessness beyond

Now there is a void between our hands
That drown the sounds of night
An arrow laced with liquid darkness
For every sungod's heart

Now, it has always been right here
Like a shadow in our blood
Now, it waits for you and me
The shadow in our blood

We are delusional
From fictional reality
To prayers for prosperity
Our loneliness
Can we resist your pale attraction?
Give in to the dream with open eyes

How will this world within a world live on?
Another page torn from the book of strangers
Who says, "I," when all voices fear their own sound
And who remembers the hours?

Now, it has always been right here
Like a shadow in our blood
Now, it waits for you and me
The shadow in our blood

[Solo]

Here in the barren and still
Far from the shores of real
Dreams borne beyond borders
On weave of thought and want
Here we're invincible

Now, it has always been right here
Like a shadow in our blood
Now, it waits for you and me
The shadow in our blood
