This architect of sorrow
Matches words to his reality
These ashen filters let no light in
Stories counter every move

This happens when nothing happens
This happens when nothing happens
Deaf to the orchestra of reason
Deaf to the orchestra of reason

To feign a force of creativity
Blind to the truth
The stories now betray

This sorrow's architect is broken
Wishes as predictions fail
Slave to faith and not to reason
Not to reason

Who mends a pattern unbroken?
Who tends to the one unharmed?
Who says your world is not real?
Who questions why you feel?

Who mends a pattern unbroken?
Who tends to the one unharmed?
Who questions why you feel?
