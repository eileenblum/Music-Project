A memory self-aware
To windows still left open
With all parts rearranged
To find a truth that suits us
Behind veils of dogma
Preconceived illusions reign

Strong-willed determination
Will shatter these walls
(Strong-willed determination)

Turn our heads to face the way
Our fears have led us on now
Awake to find the vision eyes
Deceive us all the time
Itâs all there is
Just a memory construct
Itâs all there is

A temporary glitch
In our imagination
Set to work against our reason
And devise what is not right
So when our worlds collide
Itâs under different skies

Strong-willed determination
Will shatter these walls
(Strong-willed determination)

Turn our heads to face the way
Our fears have led us on now
Awake to find the vision eyes
Deceive us all the time

Do you remember?
Do you recall?
Do you remember
What in our hearts we saw?

Let us make it real
This creation of our thoughts
And see what building stones
We have brought with us

Strong-willed determination
Will shatter these walls
(Strong-willed determination)

Turn our heads to face the way
Our fears have led us on now
Awake to find the vision eyes
Deceive us all the time

Do you remember?
You're just a memory construct
That's all you are
