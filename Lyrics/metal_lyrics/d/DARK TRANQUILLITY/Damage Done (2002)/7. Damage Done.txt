Went inside the caves of seven wolves
Felt of the forces that lend themselves to speed
Those final words to fracture the very structure
Can't stand this glacial pace
The damage done

It seems these days are getting shorter
Derails my train of thoughts

What said in hand was done, uh
Chased unforgiveness down these corridors
Locked down the basis for the willing form
A trail far from strayed
The damage done

Set aside from eyes of others
Our frail structures can't keep up with the pace
Oh, no! Our frail structures can't keep up with the pace

No
Brought out for all to see
For all to see
What the damage done
Face contradicting needs, oh!

We bring our cages home
For none to see
In vain to lessen
Responsibility
No, the damage done

It seems these days are getting shorter
Derails my train of thoughts
(Derails my train of thoughts)
