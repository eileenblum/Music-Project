Could not have foreseen
What the lies of the bearer would bring
Trailing the marks of his errors
Trace the original sin

Fallen I cling to deception
This talk of madness is in me
Come now as the drapery falls

From homes that take the foul in hand
Mind cloven Sweet spoken
With words that led us off the track
Truth altered blind-sighted, oh

Thrive on the illusion
And the image of a life to be
Unmount the shielding facade

Fallen I cling to deception
This talk of madness is in me
Come now as the drapery falls

Uh-I!

Fallen I cling to deception

Endure the spit of others
Locked inside the pretence cage
Where the cause will be certain
Fallen I'll see you inside
