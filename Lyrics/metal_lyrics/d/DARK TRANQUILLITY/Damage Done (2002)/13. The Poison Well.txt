[Japanese Bonus Track]Unless another wall is breaking
Nothing can come of this
Elusive

Against our better judgement
Allow our image to stand ground
Turn around and

Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes

Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes
Nobody ever goes

With ideals as infestations
Hinder the radical mind
Retune our aim

Now is time for hiding
For it stabs fear in you
So coward

Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes

Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes
Nobody ever goes

A thought to infect you
An idea to perfect you

A flesh to restrain you
No heart to forgive you

The poison well
Runs dry

Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes

Break the path and let's get going
To the place where nobody ever goes
