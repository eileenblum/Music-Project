To remain objective
To a closer call, uh
Secretly rejected
And to mediocrity fall
Caught on the down lopes of life

The patted shoulder remembers
The elbowed side resists
Encircled ad nauseum
An enemy to define ourselves
An enemy to refine our hate

Encouraging on the negative scale, uh
Bent out of shape is the measuring norm
In words and in writing
No one knows my enemyâ¦ like I do

A social repellant
Merely an adversary
Lost to the falling words
Kept the last of all
Understood glances
To work against

The patted shoulder remembers
The elbowed side resists
Encircled ad nauseum

An enemy to define ourselves
An enemy to refine our hate
