[Sacred Reich cover]

Striking fear in the hearts of men
The war machine will leave you dead
Rockets launching, lightning up the sky
The end is near, it's your time to die
Lightning war hitting fast and hard
No time to act the world caught off guard
The Fuhrer's troops invade the land
To spread his teachings the master plan

Blitzkrieg, lightning war
Hitler to kill them all
Pure bred Arayan man
Sacred Reich's master plan

His Nazi army to control the world
Exterminate those who stand in his way
Evil butchers know just what to do
Killing millions of Russians and Jews
Can this madman be stopped
Is there hope for world peace
We must kill Hitler
To stop this Nazi disease

Blitzkrieg, lightning war
Hitler to kill them all
Pure bred Arayan man
Sacred Reich's master plan

Goering's Luftwaffe turned to ash
Stormtroopers fall in defeat
The end of the Final Solution
The Third Reich falls to it's knees
His dream undone
Hitler is dead
The beloved Fuhrer
Put a bullet in his head

Blitzkrieg, lightning war
Hitler to kill them all
Pure bred Arayan man
Sacred Reich's master plan
