Make all the cold trees mourn
Their branches frozen in sightless motion
Waving, reaching for the whipping rain

There was silence
And the firmament withdrew
Revealing all, shapelessly and swiftly
In carmine and crimson stood flaming the sky
The relics of myths that exploded and died

Dismantle the sun and stars in their rise
And rend from the skyline
The black in our eyes

The skyline so empty
All but one, nonexistent

Words were not, nor gesture, thought or life
The skydancers laid slain and old
The firmament in perpetual withdrawal

Lux Aeterna - Sing unto the world
