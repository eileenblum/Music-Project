I see myself
In the bodies being carried out
I see myself in you
When safety falls again
It broke something essential
Like nothing ever would
A promise to give
A promise to hold

This is not what I want to hear right now
But our time is running out
So far removed from what you need to know
Words too hard to handle
Our time is running out
We're by demons encircled

Eroding away at reason
The bile of insecurity
This fear devoid of nuance
And fact resistant belief
I hold together what I can
I hold together what I know

This is not what I want to hear right now
But our time is running out
So far removed from what you need to know
Words too hard to handle
Our time is running out
We're by demons encircled

These are just symptoms of experience and life
I wish I could postpone

It eats at our logic
Like nothing ever should
It claws at our humanity
So that nothing can remain
This is the currency of faith
And we are coming up short
The reality of failure
Now upon us

This is not what I want to hear right now
But our time is running out
So far removed from what you need to know
Words too hard to handle
Our time is running out
By demons encircled
