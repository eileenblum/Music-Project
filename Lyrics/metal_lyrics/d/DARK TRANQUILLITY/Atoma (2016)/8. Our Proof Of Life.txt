At a certain point it happens
Life becomes too real
And nothing can hold back
What is about to be

I don't know
How close we need to get
To blind out the surroundings
And focus on the real

I know you're gone
But this reality
Is crashing down on me
Crashing down
To defeat all purpose
I know you're gone
I'm just not ready
I'm just not done
I am ever
In resistant disbelief

When raw emotion gets in
The way of our thoughts and words
We pass so far beyond our breaking point

I don't know how far we need to be
From all that we don't want to see
To regain perspective

I know youâre gone
But this reality
Is crashing down on me
Crashing down
To defeat all purpose
I know youâre gone
I'm just not ready
I'm just not done
I am ever
In resistant disbelief

I know
Yet I fail to find purpose and form
I know
But the truth just makes it harder

I know youâre gone
But this reality is crashing down on me
Crashing down
To defeat all purpose
I know youâre gone
I'm just not ready
I'm just not done
I am ever
In resistant disbelief
