[Bonus Track]It gets ahead of us
Blind ambition meets our desperation
It gets ahead of us
It leads a charge to where we should not go
It makes no sense to me
Our willingness to hold on to belief
It got away from us
The thought of understanding what's around
Have we gone too far this time?
To argue from authority in this case
It just got away
I feel we've lost our place in time
It's getting closer now
The fear that we have held off for so long
It's getting closer now
To where we know there can be no return
It makes no sense to me
What has been set in motion here today
It makes no sense anymore
Was it too little, too late
Or too much too fast?
This time we've gone too far
