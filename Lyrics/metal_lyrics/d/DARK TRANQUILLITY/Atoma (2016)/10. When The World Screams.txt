Let the weakness set in
This world I know
Days cannot hold me
I blur in between
Never fully engaged
The mind races between words
As far as I can get
Away from it all

When indecision ends can life begin again

I am silence
When the world screams out
I am escape when you reach out to me
I am panic
I am fear behind these walls that protect me
I am failure and resistance
I am lost where I belong
I am silence when the world screams

My insecurity extends
To others talking about themselves
Fed with this poison of
Self righteous false confidence
It's in their eyes
It's in our lives

Set to the tune of darkness
This is one to hold
I cannot stop insanity
From chasing down my thoughts
Linger in the mind
For what now seems indefinite time
My mind is holding me down

When indecision ends can life begin again

I am silence
When the world screams out
I am escape when you reach out to me
I am panic
I am fear behind these walls that protect me
I am failure and resistance
I am lost where I belong
I am silence when the world screams
