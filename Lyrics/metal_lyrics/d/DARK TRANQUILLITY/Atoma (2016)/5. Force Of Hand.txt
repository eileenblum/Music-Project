This is not a failure
This is not an end
These are just symptoms
Of a trajectory descent
Further down the line you hide
from the memories of unresolved
The struggle is lost

All this time of knowing
Letting piece by piece slip away
Cause when they're all against you
You fail

Don't you force my hand
Don't you force me

When the silence has spoken in this imminent storm
Taken to the nth degree where failure forms

Spiraling deception
Left the mindless drifting away
Cause when they're out to get you
You fail

Don't you force my hand
Don't you force me
All this time ends in nothing
These walls of doubt built into our minds
All this time signifying something
A victim without circumstance

All this time of knowing
Letting piece by piece slip away
Cause when they're all against you
You fail

Don't you force my hand
Don't you force me
