Where were the eyes that followed
How could they've found?
These misery's merchants
Struck the message deep
"We have come to stay"

Dogs fled there in the dark of his path
Feared him as once they all did

Like a ghost in daylight
On an overcrowded street
He wishes
To be something he is not
Like a shadow at midnight
That originate in air
He wishes for release
Deep in the back it had caught him
The anchor they threw at his life
Oh, these misery's merchants
Dragged through life as a burden, no
Noâ¦

Rushed off to his cage of glass
To open the single window
A means of escape, out in the open
There are still holes in these walls
Puking information into the unwanting
Probing the last hope of defense
So he plugged up the holes
Shut the outside window
In doing that, madness payed a visit

And then suddenly in mid-thought
Escape was a factor and as from inside
Pushing out were words
Through fingers came uncovering
Revealing the truth of him there in the darkâ¦

Skin began to crawl as they neared him
Is all pleasure release?
Oh, these misery's merchants
Saw the message clear
"It is time to pay"
Dogs fled there in the dark of his path of the damned
Feared him as once they all did
Like a ghost in daylight
On an overcrowded street
