Outsmart the fever
And take us farther from
The killing life in capsules
A life that can't belong

If I wake up dead to the world
With the helm at my command
The reaching out of this

Oh, faced tomorrow
In the eleventh hour
Beckoned closer
Now as nightfall sends its grace
Oh, cue to enter the insatiable ideal
Slam it shut,
But the portal pounding lingers

What it is? Is time undone?
I cannot falter in the security of labor.
Was I supposed to believe?

Where did I sign?
Oh, did I miss
Oh, the auction?
Oh, where my lifeâ¦
Where did I sign?
Did I miss the auction?

Went the half mile
Wondered when the resolution would come
Life became too solid
Diluted by the essence of denial
Caught in fire's eye
Oh, the self and the filter that is I

My lip was venom
Words formed in my mouth
And hid beneath the tongue
Never to beânever to be seen

Where did I sign?
Oh, did I miss
Oh, the auction?
Oh, where my lifeâ¦
Where did I sign?
Did I miss the auction?

Was I supposed to believe?
Where did I sign?
Oh, did I miss
Oh, the auction?
Oh where my lifeâ¦
Where did I sign?
Did I miss the auction?

Oh, where my lifeâ¦
Where did I sign?
Oh, did I miss the auction?
Where my lifeâ¦
Where did I sign?
Did I miss the auction, where my life went under the club
