There were words of lust
In these arms, arms of the stranger
And there in silence though were words, words of no milder
So in thinking of that madness
That ravages the thoughts
In the loneliest of hours

I resist without control
I resist without control
I resist without control
No! [2x]

The demand I get from excellence
The void I felt from answering
Not only an addition
It generated need
In these endless nights of freezing
My weight on the other side, the other side

I resist without control
I resist without control
I resist without control
No!

Feel the thorns of uncontrol
Feel the thorns of uncontrol
Feel the thorns of uncontrol
No!

I resist without control
Feel the thorns of uncontrol

Claws that set in sleeps December
Let loose on the verge
Talked to me as strangers once did
The tone was set for winter

Sweet uncontrol
Beyond proportion
Oh, into the night
So strike me deeper

I resist without control
I resist without control
I resist without control
No!

Feel the thorns of uncontrol
Feel the thorns of uncontrol
Feel the thorns of uncontrol
No!

I feel the thorns of uncontrol
Feel the thorns, noâ¦

The death that craved no life now ended
In return, itâll return
Drifting uncontrollably
Within the night

Sweet uncontrol
Beyond proportion
Oh, into the night
So strike me deeper
