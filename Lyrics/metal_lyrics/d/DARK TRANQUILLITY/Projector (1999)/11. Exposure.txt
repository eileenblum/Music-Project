[Instrumental]Rise I say, yes, rise above!
'Cause evil is as evil does
What evil does to me?
Down you go to lands below
'Cause evil is as evil does
What evil does to me?

They who reign in sand
Take this brightest strike
In their so-called castles
Now with walls of glass
I can see, I can see, I can see
All your deeds, all your needs
On your knees
So I'll crack your feeble shell

Can you even see
The works of what you fear?
'Cause evil is as evil does
What evil does to me
Further inside
âTil all you have is mine
Evil is as evil does
What evil's done to me

Uh-ahâ¦

Dreams he said, dreams he wore
Dreams he wore, dreams he wore
Hope he said, hope he wore
Evil he said and evil he wore

I'll strip you down
I'll tear you down
I'll plunder up and down
I'll break the lock
âTil nails come off
You're under they all lie
Rise above the light
Rise above afar
Rise above your fears
And tread on what you know, oh

Blind to your eyes
Blind to your mind
'Cause evil is what evil does
What evil does to me
Taste and you'll see
The fruit you took is foul
Evil is what evil does
What evil does to me

Oh, you who turn to others
With everything you lack
A face that bears not seeing
Then I'll turn my back
I can see, I can see, I can see
All your deeds, all your needs
On your knees
So I'll crack your fuckin' shell, oh-uh.
