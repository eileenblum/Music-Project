Neither here nor there in our unity of twine
Solitary sanity, traded in for life

Once we crawled into the artificial night
All was left and I arrived on your time, on your time

And so afterâ¦ up closer

There in the collision
Wish answers could arrive
Was I kept up for this?
Did the physical emotion
Break the fall of sleep?

I'd never thought of things that you would say
I could never tell if what you said were lies, lies

It's in here eating
It's down there drinking
Be with me, not against me
Bear with it, love against me

I've never known if there was enough time
Could never tell if it was done just right

Uh, I've never known
I've never known
I've never known
If there was enough time
Could never tell
Could never tell
Could never tell
If there was done just right

An icicle thrust
To soothe the disorder
Between the eyes
Where the well is the deepest, ah
The deepest well

I've never known if there was enough time
Could never tell if it was done just right

So unease carried words
That spoke of no matter
Was I held here for this?
Did the path of devotion stay from what you felt?

I've never seen things here in this light
Could never tell it your touch was deeper than skin

Oh, I am on your time

Once I thought that what no time can heal
Is here in me - but time proved me wrong
Deeper still toward an outward pride
No more lies, I'm here on your time
