Waiting for the day to end
As silence came too late
I turn my eyes inside
Close the lids
Deny the world to enter

'Cause I'm turning the desires down
Again rose the monstrous of hours in between
I taint the thought
The trauma born inside
All the thoughts that you defined
Tread the light again
Take the pain away
It feels as though time as tears
Never seem to end

'Cause I'm turning the desires down
Again rose the monstrous of hours in between
I taint the thought
The trauma born inside
Oh, inside
Oh, inside
Oh, inside

As I hold you in I try to make sure
These treasures that I hide
These treasures that I hide

'Cause I'm turning the desires down
Again rose the monstrous of hours in between
I taint the thought
The trauma born inside

'Cause I'm turning the desires down
Again rose the monstrous of hours in between
Taint the thought
The trauma born inside
