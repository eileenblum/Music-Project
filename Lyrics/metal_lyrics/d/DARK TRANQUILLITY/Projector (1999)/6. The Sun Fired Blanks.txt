Upon our evening
When the sun fired blanks
There rode the sickness
Out of our sight

Carried torches
Burned out long before it's time
Among these ruins
Where our love isâ¦ to be found

Ambition falters
When no better is to be known
Cling to the unfounded pride

Death to our belonging
And our ministry of two
Set the higher standard
And to a greater fall descend

Slaves to one another
And to others be it not
Soothing be temptation
Force the conscience to a halt

Caused a high vibration
A tender light to be part of you
The two-way escape

Death to our belonging
And our ministry of two
Set the higher standard
And to a greater fall descend
