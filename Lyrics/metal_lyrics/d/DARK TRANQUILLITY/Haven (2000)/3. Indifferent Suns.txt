[Music: Nicklasson, Henriksson]

And although it can be argued
Whether time will ever come to end
There is an overcoming sense of failing
If you never can see the end
In the giving of our hope eternal
We stumble blindly and forget the way
Is there ever time for answers
When the world comes tumbling down
World comes tumbling down

[Chorus:]
All along we keep staring at the sun
Closing our minds
Saying we're the ones
All along we keep staring at the sun
Blind to see it when the day will come

And even if in days of wonders
A glance that may stray from the fold
Cast aside in the spirit of ignorance
A mere nuisance when itâs time to pay

Come undone now the strive and the passion
Giving under to the forces that be
Can you even think of questions
When the world comes tumbling down
World comes tumbling down

[Chorus]

We shut our eyes and turn away
We shut our eyes and turn away

[Chorus]
