[Music: Brandstrom, Jivarp, Henriksson]

What we always fear and loathe
Becomes of us
Repay the visit of our loss
Reset the marks again
The turning points
The turning point seems to be holding on

Sands of ages and the stars above
Everchanging as the same heart beats
Repeating 'til the end
Seas of slander and the soil we walk
Everchanging as these old hearts beat
It ends up all the same

The sail that never knew the wind
Oh, barren and lost
Our wrecks these shores will never reach
A trek on darker trails
Let days be done, let days be done, let daysâ¦
It takes forever, holding on

Sands of ages and the stars above
Everchanging as these same hearts beat
Repeating 'till the end
Seas of slander and the soil we walk
Everchanging as these same hearts beat
It ends up all the same

Come on now, holding on

Sands of ages and the stars above
Everchanging as these same hearts beat
Repeating 'till the end
Seas of slander and the soil we walk
Everchanging as these old hearts beat
It ends upâ¦

The same!
