[Music: Jivarp, Henriksson]

In waiting forâ¦
Waiting for the signs to bring
The first to sing
Felt in-between these fears
Set to unknown tunes
So tempt these fragile fiends
A grace gone dark
You'll never know
You'll never feel
You'll never taste
The depths of your defeat

Break into the hearts and minds of man
Never one to tell, never one to tell
Sucking on a lie that never ends
Found at loss for words, found at loss for words

Break into the hearts and minds of man
Never one to tell, never one to tell
Sucking on a lie that never ends
Found at loss for words, found at loss for words

Locking onâ¦
Locking on to faith gone bad
Sweet touch of sin
Not in the sleight of hand
Can facts be lost
So never understate your case
Deny our weight
There never is
There never was
There never can be
A break from binding chains

Break into the hearts and minds of man
Never one to tell, never one to tell
Sucking on a lie that never ends
Found at loss for words, found at loss for words
