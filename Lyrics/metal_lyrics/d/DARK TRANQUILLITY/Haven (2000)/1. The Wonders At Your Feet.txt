[Music: Brandstrom, Jivarp, Henriksson]

All right!

Deeper shades of red descending
Smear our names, the stains unending

Turn forgiveness, break the lens distorted
Crush the infidel and turn about
Famine in our hearts, bring up the silence louder
Eradicate the lungs and take us higher

These are the wonders at your feet, oh
These are the wonders at yourâ¦

Weighed upon a wider scale
Afraid to see what takes us down
Sing destruction, sing of unfulfillment
Search abandoned, let the blood be fevered
Ridden of the self provided things get easier
Ignite our minds and let's burn brighter

These are the wonders at your feet

These are the wonders at your feet

[Solo]

All right!
These are the wonders at your feet
All right!
These are the wonders at your feet

I sad, âAll right!â
These are the wonders at yourâ¦
