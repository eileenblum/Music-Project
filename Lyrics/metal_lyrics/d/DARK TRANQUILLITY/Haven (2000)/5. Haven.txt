[Music: Jivarp, Henriksson]

Now as the lights go down
Deeper now it seems than long before
There are no noises here
Just a silence gone bad
Something I will never hide
This urging need to

Invite the darkside in
Invite the darkside
Invite the darkside in
Invite the darkside
Inâ¦ inâ¦ in
Into my haven

If there were words for this
How would I sing or should I scream?
I'd give my blood to stay
My blood just to stay right here
Something I can never share
This urging need to

Invite the darkside in
Invite the darkside
Invite the darkside in
Invite the darkside
Inâ¦ inâ¦ in
Into my haven, oh!
