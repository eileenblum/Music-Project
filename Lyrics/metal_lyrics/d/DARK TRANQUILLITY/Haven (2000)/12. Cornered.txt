There never was a night like this
How could there ever be
Through sweat and velvet misery
The fever race in me

Cornered in a symmetrical design
Sphere-like chrome on a sea enraged...
hatred

What the mirror sees
is the clutching at straws
taking us under
The storm of the ocean
this velvety crush
Ringcorners- firm in the outrage
Synaptic patterns
Waves contort
Break into these cellular walls

Why...

Globes of disease, infest my dreams
burning the ends of my veins
Pattern and form, the squares cling fast
Dance the tide now

Could never bare another night
although I know it'll come
The freezing ends of what is me
The icy rages...
free

Cornered in a symmetrical design
Sphere-like chrome on a sea enraged...
hatred

Take hold of the boundaries -
The Perimeter Sea
Burn!
Enflame the oppressors
But if four was one
in a corner alone
recovering - licking the wounds
delerium coming
the weakness kicks in
Resigning, cornered within
