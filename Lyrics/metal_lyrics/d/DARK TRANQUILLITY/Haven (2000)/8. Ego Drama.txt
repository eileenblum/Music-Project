[Music: Jivarp, Henriksson]

Wrestled on its back, ah
Our ego shows his face
Charged up, receiving
Came out knowing, ah-uh

Hopeless intrusion
Where nothing can be found
Strewn, the seeds were wasted
On the innocent in awe

Fruitless in connection
In the ripeness of his age
Drawn and thrust in anger
The dagger once again will fail

The ego drama unfolds
Hopeless intrusion
Where nothing can be found
Strewn, the seeds were wasted
On the innocent in awe

It's over, it's over
If nothing comes along
It's over for you

So in denial stand where shame is not
And unto others fall
The blame, the guilt,
The others fault
Come on now

Scratch and claw with all your strength
Take on the wildest bull in the horde
Come burn them fingers fast
Take back what they owe
Return the safety where there was noneâ¦

Hopeless intrusion
Where nothing can be found
Strewn, the seeds were wasted
On the innocent in awe

Fruitless in connection
In the ripeness of his age
Drawn and thrust in anger
The dagger once again will fail
