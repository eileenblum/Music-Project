[Music: Henriksson]

Secrets in here
Claim no belonging
Together again
Or send me to madness
I know that I should have listened
Was given a choice I turned down forever

Oh no, so tell me, are you lonely?
So tell me, are youâ¦

Emptier still
As time takes us farther
Away from the goals
By which we are measured
I know that I should have stayed true
To you and to me
But time never heals
So here alone I stand

So tell me, are you lonely?
So tell me, are you mine?

I see you standing there
Your face against the wall
You turn right around, turn right around

I who know your deepest fear
And yet you walk away
You turn right around, turn right around
Uh, why?

Uh, why?
So tell me, are you lonely?
So tell me, are you mine?
Don't speak for you and me
