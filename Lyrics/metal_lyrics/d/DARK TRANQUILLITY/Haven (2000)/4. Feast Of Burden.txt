[Music: Henriksson, Jivarp]

(Scars torn open
Bandaged slave
Eating my wrists)

A thrust that numbs the pain
Secondary now the instinct
Thrust beyond control
Chaotic
Are the tracks before me
Barren are the ones behind
Carried in a cage controlling

Driven
Driven on, driven in
Headlong onto the breach
Driven on, driven in
Taken to the extreme
Headlong onto the breach, oh

Oh-ah!

Pumping fast the race is on
Furious in striving
The feast of burden begins
The feast of burden begins

Driven on, driven in
Taken to the extreme
Headlong onto the breach
Driven on, driven in
Headlong onto the breach, oh

(The enslaving force
Thrown ahead
Unrelenting)

Faithfully holding fast
Steaming ahead unknowing
Careless again it seems
Unknowing
Oblivious to the pressure
The feast of burden begins
Feast of burden begins
