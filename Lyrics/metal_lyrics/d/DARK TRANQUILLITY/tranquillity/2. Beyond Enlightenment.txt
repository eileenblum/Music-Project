[lyrics: Sundin]

Now oppression stalks the remnants of compassion,
brewing hatred to surface in wicked actions
Cloaked in peace and mercy, force their false confessions
Sentenced am I dying, cleansed from all salvation

"Defy our accusations and a certain death you'll meet
A fool denies the obvious, and fools we shall defeat"
All sanity now vanquished, ever mould beyond control
My guilt stands yet unproven though they still demand my fall

Demand my fall

Blood runs beyond enlightenment at inquisition's hands
Vicious burn the fires swiftly out of hand

Now my fate lies in their "hands of liberation"
forming law and justice into obscuration
leading lies ensuring my life ceased in fire,
In the name of peace, to cleance my dark desires

"You stand accused of herasy and all what that implies
With darkened minds you summon those who're fallen from the skies"
Envenomed bleed their poisoned hearts, the power they've abused
A deadly game of envy in which my life I'll lose

Blood runs beyond enlightenment at inquisition's hands
Vicious burn the fires swiftly out of hand

Shackled, fettered - choking as I drown
Fooled and tortured - confess comitted crimes
Shackled, fettered - choking as I drown
Fooled and tortured - confess comitted crimes

Sentenced by superstition - my innocense denied
Truth is strange than fiction - religious genocide

Alone in blind desperation, I face my mournful death
In flames I meet termination, but my memory will be left
