[lyrics: Sundin]

\Voice of the Shadow of Beauty\ - sung by Anders FridÃ¨n
/Voice of the Shadow of Darkness/ - sung by Mikael Stanne

\shadows play
in my wilderness' mindscape
they seek\
/one spiteful and wicked
one humble and meek/

\a windswept pale landscape
of edified thought\
/two frictional forces
a triad have brought/

\woven\
/a soft breeze whispers slowly/
\within me\
/in the valley of my mind/
\the aerial mists sink falling\
/and its breath both foul and holy
is like the deer to a dying hind/
\slowly traversing the atmosphere
calling\

/wordless, yet in soul so true/
\nameless, yet it lives in you\
/shapeless like the purity of pain/
\lawful when all fear is slain\

-one shadow of beauty caressing the flowers
the paleness of winter reflects in her eyes-

\deity of stardom\
/enticer of stardoom/
\so soft and so silent\
/maternal - eternal/
\serenity fades\
/blinded by visions of sunlight nocturnal/
\with the darkening of skies\

/one shadow of darkness
a shade of deep hate
a wanderer's spectre with fury ablaze
in sheets of sharp silver
laid youthful to die
reborn into vengeance
dark flames dance in grace

dark flames dance in grace
in the grace of storms/

\one shadow of beauty\
/one shadow of darkness/
\sailing free on the sea within my mind\

\surging dark oceans
perpetual waters
creator of life
and reclaimer of souls\
/mother ocean/
\watching the deep fjords uneasily moving\
/whipping the white waves towards the cold air/
\rising like swans in a scarred, sudden motion\
/a cascade of lost feathers
adrift on the sea/

\hark\
/a serenade in the tongue of the wind/

\the sighs of the centuries, so sonorous in the bower
hovering further athwart a leafy cover\
/a shelter for those whose time's wind make them wither
and therefore they choose to guide this time-wind hither

alas, in tune with the tide of time
i was, but I'm not
nor I'll be with its pride

yes, aeons have flown
but more is to come
for I know time/
\but time is not eternal, their life stars not immortal\
/a friend that I greet with open arms/
\setting souls can never\
/a brother soul of deadly harm/
\pass through the pearly portal\
\no bliss be given\
/and joy/
\nor joy\

/flowing down the gates of hell
fire/
\i cry for you...\
/don't spill your tears for me
but for your kit and kin/
\my scions of light?\
/deprived of the lust and the treasure of pleasure
which is the fuel for life
and glory/

\silent your dark desires within entirety's light\

-solitude
sanctity
sanctuary
sanctum, sanctum,
sanctum (tranquility)

\hear me
/you who hold the fate of stars in hand
before creation's eye I stand
my soul set free/
in summerland\

\mighty the strand of the universe\
/a chaos void tomb of dead worlds/
\hark\
/what?/
\divinity flows in your heart
cast it alight, the seed of all art
slowly reborn from a sunless state of mind\
/silent, you fool/
\a cradle of roses
embedded in stillness and shade\

/silent, you fool
thine words are untrue
remember Endymion's crestfallen tears
serene art the gods, yet pain is their way
he touched by the heavens
his hellfire nears

a silent divinity, now see your body of air/
\free now your heavenly body of air\

\come bathe in the rays of the all-seeing one
holding the fate of all life in both hands
breathing life-force
like gold made from sand\

/my winged steed of moonlight
black stallion of thunder
we rode above the greenish earth
and tore the green asunder/
\but what you left bleeding
destroyed a soulforsaken world
and your deeds of sharp silver
decoyed a mindforsaken herd\

\a duet of shadows\
a duet of shadows
\a duet of thoughts\
a duet of thoughts
\of beings we feed
with the dust of our thoughts
residing within us
the two-fold wheel of life
of insight created: a triad of jewels\

a thin leaf of the life-tree's truth
