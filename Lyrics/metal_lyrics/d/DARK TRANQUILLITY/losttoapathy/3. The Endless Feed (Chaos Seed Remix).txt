No more chaos seed
I am not what you're supposed to see, no
I hear a mighty cheer
Your faith could not be any stronger
In your head the stage is set
A product of what we're being fed
Oblivious by design
Not susceptible to any mind
No more fictitious needs
No more chaos seed
I am not what you're supposed to see, no
I can take
What's being given
I can down
Whatever comes
I will do
What you deem necessary
My fear compels me
My fear compels me
I hear a mighty cheer
Your faith could not be any stronger
In your head the stage is set
A product of what we're being fed
Oblivious by design
Not susceptible to any mind
My fear compels me
My fear compels me
My fear compels me
