To each a blind eye
To all the filter of self-control
To none a sense
That we are lost inside
Victims, not witnesses
An accomplice, not a bystander
In a time when worlds collide
For us a safe denial
Not to push beyond our goals
For us a shattered image
What our sanity allows
You're an island of tranquillity in a sea of chaos
