Searching for a light but the bulbs have all shattered
The rose result stains my lustful feelers
Solitude can be such a blessed accompaniment
Were it not for the echoes of my own screams

Fear not for the stop as the fall is the whole of this nightmare
We find ourselves hoping for a concrete stop to this rabbit hole

Iâve got the direction! Backwards we glide
Having never seen the wall to admit it is there
My countrymen! My brethren! This is progress in its prime!
Progressively downward is still progressive

Are we so hooked on the official line?

Fear not for the stop as the fall is the whole of this nightmare
We find ourselves hoping for a concrete stop to this rabbit hole
