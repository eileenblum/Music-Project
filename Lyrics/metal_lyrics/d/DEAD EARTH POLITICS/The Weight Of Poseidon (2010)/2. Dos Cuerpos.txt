Two bodies in my El Camino riding West into the sun
Two bodies in my El Camino â wonât come back with either one
When I killed them it felt so real, with my own two hands I slew
When I killed them it felt so real, choked them till their lips turned blue

Donât hear their lies â donât hear their cries â donât hear their lies
Dos Cuerpos

Two hands paint the wheel smearing blood with every turn
These two hands have cleared the path that leads to eternal burn
When I gripped them, the power grew â strength of theirs became my own
When I gripped them, the power grew â now these morals have been disowned

Rotting bodies rotten in the Sun

Three bodies in my El Camino, capsized â baking in the sun
Three bodies in my El Camino, now this body is the final one
I pulled the trigger â it felt so real I have found peace anew
I pulled the trigger now its come to passâ¦I found my place with both of you

Donât hear their lies â donât hear their cries â donât hear their lies
Dos Cuerpos
