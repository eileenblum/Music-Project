Under the water the planet seems clearer
I canât breathe, but Iâd rather see
Canât feel the bottom, canât reach the shore
The truth fills my lungs and I breathe no more

A world Atlantian now awaits me
A dreamscape of never ending embrace
As the light from her ocean ascends
So the questioning of this choice begins

Sink, Sink â Truth in these lungs

Feel the bite in my chest as the pressure mounts
The pain from all who swim about me
Breathing false was so much easier
Cough up this truth from my lungs

The sky above my head is leagues away now
Rippling and panicked as I
Buoyant in knowledge though saddened by its weight
Only the gasp of stale air can alleviateâ¦
â¦This painâ¦
â¦My painâ¦

Feel the bite in my chest as the pressure mounts
The pain from all who swim about me
Breathing false was so much easier
Cough up this truth from my lungs
