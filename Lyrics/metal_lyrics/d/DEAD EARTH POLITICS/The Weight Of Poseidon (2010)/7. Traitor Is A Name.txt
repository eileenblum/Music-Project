Behind the dark phoenix glows a rebellious sun
Rays doused in immortal darkness, offering failure to none
Gleaming metal clashes against broken blade
Over a mound of her enemies, her law is laid

Traitors! Dissidents!
Rise up, follow me and take the day!
I'm no leader, but i know the way...
Traitors! Dissidents!
Rise up, follow me and take the day!
Traitor is only a name

Fortified in shadow, the clouds' descent cover our shame
She holds her flag above us all, our strength is reclaimed
"Fight!" she cries. "Fight and fall!"
Hers is our will!
Charge with me, toward victory
If not for the kill - fight for the thrill

Traitors! Dissidents!
Rise up, follow me and take the day!
I'm no leader, but i know the way...
Traitors! Dissidents!
Rise up, follow me and take the day!
Traitor is only a name

What the fuck is in a name?

Our Lady Liberty is now our Lady Vengeance
Her veins of bronze pumping veins of pain
Her torch of justice lights this path of dissent
And in its wake leaves the liars in flames

Traitor is only a name...

No more left, no more right
We'll drive this tank down the center
No more left, no more right
Raise your fist, beautiful dissenter!
