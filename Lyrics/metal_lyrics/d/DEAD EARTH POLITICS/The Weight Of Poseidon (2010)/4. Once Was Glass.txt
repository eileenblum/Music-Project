The earth shifts beneath these heels as I wade through pain
Slowing this heartbeat as to not attract the flies again

Iâm leaking the lust
For which I crave
The twisted hope
To populate another grave

The desert glare blisters this hide as I wade through dissidence
Slowing this heartbeat as to rest for now
And lay upon what once was sand

I learned so well from a man who knew nothing
From a bastard saint whoâd hide behind the lines
And wants his son to stand tall
And watch as his father falls
