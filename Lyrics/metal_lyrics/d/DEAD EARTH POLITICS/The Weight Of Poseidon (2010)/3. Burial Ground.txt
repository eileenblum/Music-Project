Iâm kicking Iâm scratching Iâm tearing the walls
You scream till you bleed I wonât hear when you call
The satin suffocates as the darkness falls
Dig up my grave, Iâm not dead after all

Open your eyes â I canât open my fucking eyes
Open your eyes â see what theyâve done to you, lies have been told to you

Enterado vivo seis pies yo

Iâm weeping Iâm clawing Iâm gasping for air
I pray to my god, but God doesnât care
None can hear these relentless prayers
My lips cease their begging â I count my fare

Dig â dig deep
On the Burial Ground! One foot in the grave now Iâm kicking you down

Laughing and grinning, I pat the earth
Smooth over the soil to guard its worth
The bell has silenced, the chord torn down
None can pull from your burial ground
