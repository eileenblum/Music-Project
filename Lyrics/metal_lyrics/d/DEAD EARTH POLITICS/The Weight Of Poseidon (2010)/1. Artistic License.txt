So it flies - the life that pumps your venom
is painting these scars
Knuckles brushing the mixes
into this magniloquent masterpiece

Inside this fist -
You're powerless and drowning in regret
Inside this fist -
is an artist waiting to be born

How many ways can I break you?
You haven't got the digits to count anymore
How many tears can wash your manhood away?
No more prayers...

Streaks of misinterpreted splendor
paint your smile...forming an abscessed grimace

Disillusioned revelry
inspires the loathing from millions
of others lost
Now the rays that shot
from your soul-window...
danced like the sun but slumber now, fading like the moon

Inside this fist -
You're powerless and drowning in regret
Inside this fist -
is an artist waiting to be born

How many ways can I break you?
You haven't got the digits to count anymore
How many tears can wash your manhood away?
No more prayers...by now your knees must be broken
