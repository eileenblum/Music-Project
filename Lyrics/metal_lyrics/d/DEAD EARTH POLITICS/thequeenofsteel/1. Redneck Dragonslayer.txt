Black skies are overcast
something darker approaches me
over the knoll feet press firmly
making their way, gnashing their teeth
i stand before you scarred and
ready to take on the coming day
against my chest i bear the crest
loyalty runs red in these veins

heed the crack in the sky - for its the harbinger of my name
read the folds in the water - the cresting tide will overtake your shore

muscles sore and wanting more
revenge is what keeps us alive
doing wrong against those who've wronged
embed by the evil that I imbibe
i stand above it beaten and bloody
the beast lay at my feet
with my soul i've paid toll
with this blood letting I am free

heed the crack in the sky - for its the harbinger of my name
read the folds in the water - the cresting tide will overtake your shore

my demons are slowly waking
my lich has arrived
my blade is profusely bleeding
your overthrow is nigh

muscles sore and wanting more
revenge is what keeps us alive
doing wrong against those who've wronged
embed by the evil that I imbibe
i stand above it beaten and bloody
the beast lay at my feet
with my soul i've paid toll
with this blood letting I am free

heed the crack in the sky - for its the harbinger of my name
read the folds in the water - your overthrow is nigh
