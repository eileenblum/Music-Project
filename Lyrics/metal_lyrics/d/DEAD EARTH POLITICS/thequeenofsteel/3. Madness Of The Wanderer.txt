Across the wastes the sun purifies
Thoughts hone in on the prize
The astral wasteland - dune shaped princes
Moan my name and writhe
Blisters on my tongue aid me
I chew through the pain to find the words
Pharaohs of before stand watch as I
Defile the world of waking man

A man of empty face gazes
I force the scars to bleed again
A crone of many children cackles
I embrace this madness

Egyptian sky is in my head
Leading my hand its marks
Guttural songs and harmonies praise
From the belly of the cat we embark
Ocean roads paved with fear and lust
Embellishments of my human skin
I fall through cracks, breaking the bond
The wandering madness embraces me again

A man of empty face gazes
I force the scars to bleed again
A crone of many children cackles
I embrace this madness

All pray to me - a transient god to bleed for
All beckon me who seek to steal away my madness
