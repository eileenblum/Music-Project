Tribute or death - they're all thats left for you
capitulate or bend your knee
peons and princes; all pay the price
subjugated harmony

blood and souls by the lady's hands
her dark will shall be done
her savage horde will rape the land
harvesting one by one

bones are cast for you
its written in the stars
the queen of steel has run you through
her spoils of war lay screaming
in the light of the crescent moon
the queen of steel has mastered you

in the gloaming she stands astride the land
dark mistress in all she surveys
for blood and empire
lust, love and malice
upon these things her bones are made

blood and soul by the lady's hands
her dark will shall be done
her savage horde will rape the land
harvesting one by one

bones are cast for you
its written in the stars
the queen of steel has run you through
her spoils of war lay screaming
in the light of the crescent moon
the queen of steel has mastered you
