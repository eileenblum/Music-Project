You're planting the seeds,
But they're harvesting the fruits
Starving cause your teeth,
Are broken by their boots
They offer you the keys,
But there are no doors
When you're enraged
They give you peace by force

You're watching the worms,
Eating you alive
Beginning with your soul,
They are stabbing like a knife
When you'll be dead,
They'll leave you all alone
But they will come back
To your child that now has grown

Rotting in the sand,
While water cleans your memory
In this world of sickness,
We've got the same destiny

Fight against their illness,
Against stupidity
Even you will die in pain...
Face reality
No more rules
I will obey
No more rules
That lead me on my way

Alone I breath,
Alone I suffer
I won't get
This bullshit that you offer
No more me
To slave for nothing
Now it's you
To eat my shit !

My tortured brain
Cuts you in pieces
My self control
Fastly decreases

Enough of this life
Lived struggling for
You are rotting...
I'm enjoying it
