Their bodyes are hiding,
Evilness inside
You've got the chance to choose,
But they will decide
Feel like losing control,
Thirst for destruction
Your brains are boiling
Chemical reaction

Dark thoughts
Born from the boiling hatred
Flooding your mind,
Kindness has ended
They fuel your head
With hate and disgust
Taking your money,
Your soul and your trust

The peacefull mind,
Is now infected
Honesty,
The biggest lie inveted
Lovem
An idea of manipulation
Hate,
It's the only love's creation

The shaking fist
Is closed so strong
This hate inside
Is boiling for too long
Break the chains
That keep you tied
Now is your turn
Their fate to decide

Walls of the world
Are painted in black
Once you were born,
There is no way back
