They lie...
With sincerity
Pure hypocrisy...
They call it democracy
Never go beyond...
The promise that was told
You get the...
Fool's gold

Injustice everywhere
No one seems to care
No one to beware

You lick with your tongue
What they shit all along
You pretend you're strong

Hypocrisy
Without limitation
Societies
Lubrification
When they are all asleep
No one is a hypocrite

Integrity,
Destroyed by lies
You are small,
In my eyes
Hypocrisy,
Never dies
It gets fed
With your lies

ROT....... HYPOCRISY!
ROT....... DEMOCRACY!
