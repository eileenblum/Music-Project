Time is running,
People are dying
Darkened the path
That doctrines are brightning
The open doors will lock you in,
The innocent one
Will give you the sin

Locked in a room,
Running in circles
You are their slave,
To much acceptance
Got your eyes open,
But you can't see nothing
Laughing and merciless,
You'll be left rotting

The hourglass
Turned so many times
Nothing has changed,
Still living the lies
Break the glass,
Let the sand drain
Burn all the rules,
They are in vain
