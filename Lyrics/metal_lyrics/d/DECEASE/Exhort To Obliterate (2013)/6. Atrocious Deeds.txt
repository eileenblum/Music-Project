[feat. Andy Ghost]War is the simptom,
Not the disease
Spreading death,
Thirst for victories
Bathing in blood,
Swimming through corpses
Their greed is consuming
All your forces

Peace time...
Sons burying their fathers
War time...
Fathers burying their sons

Silent scream of pain
Bullets falling,
Like an acid rain
Pieces of flesh,
Smoke and fire
They are selling death,
You're their buyer

Peace time...
Sons burying their fathers
War time...
Fathers burying their sons

They led you to
The battlefield
Staying behind,
Their purpose is concealed
They tell you to
Fight for justice and peace
You increase their reputation
But you're not born for this

They are your masters...
You are their slave
They take all the credit
While you're falling in graves
Combat boots,
Walking along the minefield
Business suits,
Their lack of care revealed

Silent scream of pain
Bullets falling,
Like an acid rain
Pieces of flesh
