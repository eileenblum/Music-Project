More and more,
People now are born
But you all
Will soon be mourn
You are blind,
You cannot see it comming
Death is here
And nobody is running

You're asking for medication
From the center of infection
You;re hiding under their wings,
But there's where death lives

Looking for some shelter,
In this world of hate
They pretend
That you're their friend,
But they are full of shit

Greed
Sucking everything from you
Exactly like a bitch do

Lies
Misleading, choking, killing
Playing with youre brain,
With hate filling

The promises are never kept
Never know what to expect

More and more,
People now are dying
You see it clear now
But still not running
Still believing their lies
Still deceived
By their fucking cries
