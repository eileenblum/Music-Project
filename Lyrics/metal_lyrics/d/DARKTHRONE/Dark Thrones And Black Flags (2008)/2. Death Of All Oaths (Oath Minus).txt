Our time of visit is over
And over again
Kneedeep in false idols
Demonic fairytales, prophets of nothing

The great death of all oaths
Burn you all into oblivion

Poisoned to admire our race
Poison all of your ideas
Putting the final end to it all
Breathing out the mantra

Past present and future prophets
Mould into meatball
My sole fire in vast forest
Nibble slowly, cosmos watching

The great death of all oaths
Burn you all into oblivion
