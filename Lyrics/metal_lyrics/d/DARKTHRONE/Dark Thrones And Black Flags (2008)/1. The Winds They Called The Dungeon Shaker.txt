In the depths of the underground
Through the nurseries of real metal sound
Governing the molten core
No more slavery anymore

The Winds! They Called - The Dungeon Shaker
The Winds! They Called - The Dungeon Shaker

We are older and wiser and the underground thrives
(but) posers are the same with their metal lies
In a seance of insanity with maniacal screams
Does your metal knows what metal really means?

The Winds! They Called - The Dungeon Shaker
The Winds! They Called - The Dungeon Shaker
To the Bone!!!
