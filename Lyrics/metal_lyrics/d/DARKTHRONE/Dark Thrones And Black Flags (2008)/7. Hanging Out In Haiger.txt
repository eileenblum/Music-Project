I'm in the air!!!
Hell bent for a Rockarolla trip
City lights wave beneath
This year it's Germany!!!

At the end of a dark ride
Guided by the general's eye
With of couple of die hard's
I'm hanging out in Haiger!

Well the party still ain't over
Checking' out the chainsaw cover
Another round in the bar in the cellar
- It's headbang heaven this night
