Drastic Duties cloak my mind
In darkness they can't see my game
All walls are drawing nearer
Keep on pushing, I'll be born again

Courtmarshalled for doing my job
- Bitterness scraping at my thoughts
The stupid eyes of the world are watching
I will never cave in

In the cerebral abyss
The grizzly trade thrives
Unpleasant necessities
Uh, mandatory pain

I laugh at your distorted accusations
You're not worthy
See the blazing truth in these eyes:
You'll be judged by me on the other side
