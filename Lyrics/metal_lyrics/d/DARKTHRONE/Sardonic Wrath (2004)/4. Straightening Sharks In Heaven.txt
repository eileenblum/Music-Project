It would take a world of executioners
to see the need of henchmen in everyday life
(the) credibility of the meek
Stained with the juice of frustrated priests

What you don't feel will hurt (you) in hell
I'm straightening sharks in heaven
What you don't feel will hurt (you) in hell
We're straightening sharks in heaven

(when) All you take for granted is fake
And all the angles are on the take
Fear the silent majority
When you hate, God can't see you

The sins you don't feel will hurt (you) in hell
I'm straightening sharks in heaven
What you don't feel will hurt (you) in hell
We're straightening sharks in heaven
