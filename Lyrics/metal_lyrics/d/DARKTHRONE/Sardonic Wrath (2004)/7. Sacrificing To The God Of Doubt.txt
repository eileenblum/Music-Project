The road is paved while we walk it
To the place where we pay for the sins
we have no yet paid for in life
Sacrificing to the God of doubt

Fuck hope
My empty stare just might make you
want to think twice

(more damage than) Misinformed philantropers
It's those christian thieves
Even the narrow path leads to Rome
Sacrificing to the God of doubt

Stray pulse
My empty stare just might make you
want to think twice
