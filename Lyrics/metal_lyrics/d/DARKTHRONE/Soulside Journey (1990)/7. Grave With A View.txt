I am allergic to my own tongue
Licking my wounds, end up in Tears
I sweep my teeth in yellow Spit
Rotting Christ before my eyes
I spit in the mouth of the priest -
Revenge for Those Who Died
So what if I am fuckin' insane
I'll fucking kill you anyway!
My very heart blows out of my fucking chest
And the beams go wild against the brown, brown wall
I hope they give me
A Grave With A View...
