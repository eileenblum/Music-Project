When Hell Calls Your Name
There's No Way Back
And the Burning slaves
And the Burning holy
Will be seen from afar
As the New Risen Throne (Star)
And when the fires have Burned
Beholding the Seas of Ashes
And roll the (ir) Blooded flesh
On holy areas Now Cold
And Dead
And flowers Smell of Black
Now Emperor of No Light
And Pain
For the Eternal slaves
The envy of losers so indeed upon losers themselves
And destruction upon the holy man
Who hails a
Join us We Are (the) Future Now
Be Desecration Master
Be The Hammer
The Hammer

[Lyrics by Fenriz, January 1994]
