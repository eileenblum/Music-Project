[Lyrics by Fenriz, January 1994]

En mann dro for Ã¥ lage ild,
Om hjertet brant hans sjel, var vill
I et slag hvor far var glemt, det ble hans lange, kalde siste vinter.

VrÃ¦Ã¦Ã¦Ã¦Ã¦l

En kriger stor, med kovnet sinn
I tÃ¥kedal, han ble fÃ¸rt inn
Fra sitt ariske palass
Det ble han siste, lange, kalde, siste vinter

Kvitekrist og jÃ¸der feirer nÃ¥
De tror at Odin ville forgÃ¥
Men kampen den har nÃ¥ begynt
Det er hans stÃ¸rste Ã¦refulle seier

[English translation:]

One man went to make a fire
His heart was burning, wild was his soul
In a battle where the father was forgotten, it became his lang, cold last winter

[Scream]

A great warrior, with a strangled mind
He was led into a foggy valley
From his Aryan palace
It is his last, long, cold last winter

Whitechrist and Jews are now celebrating
They thought that Odin would perish
But the battle has now begun
It is his last big honourable victory
