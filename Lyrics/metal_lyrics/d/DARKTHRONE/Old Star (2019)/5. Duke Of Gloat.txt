Too old to wring the secret from the master
The well you encountered as a child
Merely acknowledging the beacon now
And now you are not well any longer

So this is the pact of the gloat
Double hell for all
All to repair and one to watch
No freedom in these domains

Hail the satan
Sinister duke of gloat
Wrap up the wretched fates
Intriguing eternal laughter

Encyclopedias
Of endless futile life toils
Shrapnel wounds
From shattered inner gargoyles

So this is the pact of the gloat
Brave beating hearts, But
All must repair while one beholds
No freedom in these domains
