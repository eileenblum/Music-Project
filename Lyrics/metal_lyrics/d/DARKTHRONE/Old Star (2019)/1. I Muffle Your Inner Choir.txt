I muffle your inner choir
Rehearsing twisted screams
Level the jesters dream
Numbening your live wire

Click your shit boots together
We are not in hell anymore
In the land of the blind
The one eyed man is dead

Stew hack disagree
Brew the divine sweat
Eat the forest alive (you) unman
Pollute the entrails

Click your shit boots together
We are not in hell anymore
In the land of the blind
The one eyed man is dead
