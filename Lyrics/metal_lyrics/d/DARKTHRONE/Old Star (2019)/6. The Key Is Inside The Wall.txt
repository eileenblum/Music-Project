The key is inside the wall
Every wall. Every way
Every minute. You don't understand
Dying reveals the wish

Wishing is the beyond
A seance is beyond
Talk to the four keys
Lock yourself in

Confused isolation heroics
Chilled concern fragments
Morbid kaleidoscope draws you in
Stigmata of satan pulls you out

Downbeaten souls, bowed heads
Competance of guardians impotent
Glorious idiots of the flesh
Stake out the danger in our heads

Walk free but mind your fingers
Thought you would fly away with satan
Fingers able. Just stumps now
The key is inside the wall
