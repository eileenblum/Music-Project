Desert... Night...
Coyotes Feel the Cold Wave of The Dark
Red Eyes eats through
the Vast Nocturnal Landscape
A Strong Light - The Only Night

This is where he made Sculptures
from the Visions that Created The Force

Baphomet in Steel
For the Flesh of Cain
A Throne made by remains
of 12 holy Disciples

New Disciples rose,
one by one, ten by ten
All met under the Desert Moonlight
Knowledge fired across the Landscape
Sparks that mixed with Coyote Eyes
Diabolic Forces in a Ceremonial Union

And each Beast of the Land
took its own way in Living
(the) Seven forbidden things
were Eternally Desecrated

Kathaaria was Built - World without End
