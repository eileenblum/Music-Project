Stripping on twisted knives in miscreation
Norway be my grave
Increasingly insecure
Combine with stagnant joy

Half my life in your name
Fucked up and ready to die

Death just takes a moment
Suffering is forever

Let's leave this sinking ship together
The water of life will fill your lungs
Drink 'till you bleed
When contradictions fail to soothe

Half my life in your name
Fucked up and ready to die

Murder only takes a moment
It'll last you forever
