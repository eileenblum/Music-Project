Sinking deeper into the fabric
Investing more in the movement
Facing east
Skin 'em alive

Scar tissued shadows
Grease factories for weapons

Black Metal is the devil's fuel
Ram painted abattoirs
Hail the new born king
Join the dead (join the dead)

Beautiful goat regime
Venomous perils
Do you feel safe ?
Tomorrow will never end !!

Bathing your singed hair
In rust

Black Metal is the devil's fuel
Ram painted abattoirs
Hail the new born king
and join the fucken dead
