Divided we stand
Knucklescraping pain
Unlocked and insecure
To be all open wounds

Down there I see you
No no, further
Feebly twinkling
Stellar filth
Redeemers wacked up like suicide

I'm out of my cage
no time for scars now (I'm being fed)
Brigades of contempt
Maximus Lord of Lies

Curling up
for (the) ironic residue
Feebly twinkling
Stellar filth

How many hasn't cursed the wall ...
How many hasn't cursed the wall ?!
