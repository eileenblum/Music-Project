Striving for a piece of Lucifer
Don't you know it can never be digested ?
I've noticed a (certain) lack of demons lately
And it really worries me sick

Let's see who stands when the somke clears
Keep kicking that litter our way
We ain't about to throw the fight here
We all shall die

No sense of sublime estetics
No clue about obscure origins
So high on centerfold wisdom
Some tombs will never be silent

Let's see who stand when the smoke clears
Keep kicking that litter our way
We ain't about to throw the fight here
We all shall die
