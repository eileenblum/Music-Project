Despair, torn by hate,
DISTORTED ATMOSPHERE
Alas, observing the inconvenient horizon
Prepare to launch all terrestrial
imprudence, until nothing remains;
COMPLETE THE IMMOLATION

THULCANDRA PROVIDES!
THULCANDRA PROFANES!

Abstract emotion, major impropriety
philanthropic tendencies concretely oppressed!

IMPORTUNATED PROPHECIES
EXTERMINATING AMNESTIES
DECAYING IMMORTALLY
FREEDOM IN OUR DEATH!

SOLUTION!!!

For England and the monarchy
we free our souls; our destiny
Though it is implied tratory
TO THE ENTIRE EARTH HUMANITY
