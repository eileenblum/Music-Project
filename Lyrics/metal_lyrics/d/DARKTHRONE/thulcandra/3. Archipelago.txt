One by one, they fell into the sea
The gleam extinguished; arduous future wait for me
Gravity; the deep pulls me under
Darkness fills me, and I gurgle as is sink

THE CLOUDS ABOVE ARE DARK, I CAN FEEL IT!
AS ARCHIPELAGO WANTS TO SWALLOW ME
MY BLOODSHOT EYEBALLS; MY PRESSURED LUNGS
MY LIFE; MY LIFE IS IT SLOWLY FADING!?

CONATION COMES IN WAVES; THEY TAKE YOU TO THE SHORE

RISE!
RISE!!
RISE!!!
