Daimon
It's been years
Daimon
Since I discovered the other world
The other world
Where shadows draped to our feet

Evil
Possess me

I pretend
But daemons
I can only
Dream of

In coldness and darkness
I know I'm possessed

Bodies
Are what we all see
Dead or alive

We're alive
But our truth is dead

Invisible
For all to see

Demon
When it's cold and dark
Possess me

More and more
