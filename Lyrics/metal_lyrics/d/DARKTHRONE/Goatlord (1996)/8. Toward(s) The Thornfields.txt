Now
Now that I'm through with you

My black wings have gone

But remember
When you smile
You forget the pain inside

The feeling you all hate
I'm there to bring it
In another world

Have you ever been true
That's what you know I have

You feel I hurt
You feel that I have

Take me to the thornfields
