Engulfed in frost
I sailed our dreams
Gloomy inner landscapes come to life

I am the wolf in the darkest scene
Phantasms sweep my role
I am Lucifer, I bring you light and pride

Three steps for the white
A journey for the black
No flags for the tens lines
(but) I'll shoot you full of signs

In other dimensions
My visions grew black wings
