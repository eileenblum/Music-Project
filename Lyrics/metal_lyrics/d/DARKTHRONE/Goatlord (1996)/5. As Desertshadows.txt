I must embrace visual hell to satisfy us
Rape the Whores in Blasphemy
I am Him while I feast upon your flesh

Glance into my eyes
And see the darkest shadows dancing
Playing in the desert of my life
Burning, - and my soul is descending

Glance into my eyes
And see the darkest shadows dancing
Into the night
