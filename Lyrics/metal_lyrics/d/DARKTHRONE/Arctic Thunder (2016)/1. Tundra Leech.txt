In within circle unbound
Ripping roots from holy ground
Laying bare where needs sown
Caring nothing but my own

Can not cope pull the rope
Posers in breeding
Sown why bleeding
Damned ones destroy hope

TUNDRA LEACH!

Claim claims even forgotten
Resurrection carry back and forth
Begone stalemate and treason
Initiate the corrosive birth

The empty scraping
Wombs outbled, frozen
All terrain and no direction
(You) Crawl towards your own dissection

TUNDRA LEACH!
