[lyrics by Ihsahn]

Fire
Fire I greet Thee
Give life to shadows grim
So that they may writhe where you dwelt
In life, now dead within

Gaia!
Once mother of all life
Now raped by death
To breed the brethren of black fire

Destruction!
In claw-controe
Neverending bleakness
In the sight of the undead

Black desert of ashes
Under a dark clouded sky
Given shelter to flesheating flames
Starved since creation

Reign from skeleton thrones
The realm of the beast
Black victory of death
No life in this funeral beast
