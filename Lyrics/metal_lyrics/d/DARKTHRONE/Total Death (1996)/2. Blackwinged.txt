[lyrics by Nocturno Culto]

The urge...so strong
To do the devil's work.
The flock of jesus christ
I will rape your souls
till you see the devil clear

Blackwinged

Evil wings bring torture from the skies
With a limb so huge,
to serve you christian sluts
Penetrate your pure cunts with might
Now you filthy cunts, do you see the moon?
Its glowing for the black wings return

Blackwinged

We'll burn your worthless bodies
and send the fire and stench
to heaven high, Remind your worthless
god, that our victory is complete
Clean this earth of holy bitches
Desecrate mother mary

Blackwinged
