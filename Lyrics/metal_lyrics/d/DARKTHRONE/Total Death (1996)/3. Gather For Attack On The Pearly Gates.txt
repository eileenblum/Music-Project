[lyrics by Nocturno Culto]

Brothers of north, brothers of doom
Ravens has spoke. The attack must begin

The shadows of our warrior souls
will float with infernal speed

Souls of christ, prepare for fight
We'll crush your halls with bonecrushing
might supreme

Your feeble cries will not be heard
Since your god lies dead and buried
In the ruins of the pearly gates

Brothers of north, brothers of doom

Endlessnights of total war
Coming closer
Gather, Hell is calling...gather
Gather for attack on the pearly gates.
