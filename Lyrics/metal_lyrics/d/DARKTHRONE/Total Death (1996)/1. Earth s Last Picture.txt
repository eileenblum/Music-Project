[lyric by Garm]

We sail the seas, of negativity
to banish kindness from this place
(Sans scruples, sans humility)

To behold the fierceness of wolves
assailing ye saints thoroughly
(Sans love, sans compassion)

To behold the wails of thine in affright
whilst evil preyeth upon thy hearts
(Sans warmth, sans pity)

To behold a world, darkly astir
rising in madness and mystery
(sans light, sans life)

Would ye not rather fall into pleasant reverie
Than to tremble amidst, this old memory?
Alas for the damned thou art...now ye behold!
Tis the rise of satanic divinity...

Oh we rejoice at the destruction
of all ye have ever lived for...

Hark! as lands tremble, and empires fall
Ye may hear us laugh with sardonic wrath
(tis the voices from the past)

Aye we can not mourn, for
never morrow shall dawn
World without end...
