[Nocturno Culto]

Crawling out of the dark hole
drugged on alien medicine
It runs in the family of lesser men
the circle of life speaks for itlself

Molecular structure defines
the imaginary balls
Vaporizing intellectual leftovers
the wall of life is closing in

Draining the potent orb
final showdown
Behind closed gates of hell
everybody will hear you scream

You are of lesser men
