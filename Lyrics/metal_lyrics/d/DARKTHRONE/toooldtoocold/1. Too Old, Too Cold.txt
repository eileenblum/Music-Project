Nothing to prove
Just a hellish rock'n roll freak
You call your metal black
It's just plastic lame and weak

We're too old
Too cold
Too old
And too cold

Second to none
Like an angel unâfuckingâborn
Down with people
It's done
Your attitude
It's still born

We're too old
Too fucking cold

Nothing to prove
Just a hellish rock'n roll freak
You call your metal black
It's just plastic lame and weak

Second to none
Like an angel unâfuckingâborn
Down with people
It's done
your attitude
It' still born

We're too old
Too cold
Too old
and too cold
