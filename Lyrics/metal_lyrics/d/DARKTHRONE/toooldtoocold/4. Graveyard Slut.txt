(I) first saw you at the graveyard
nice rack 'n' all
Creepy &amp; lost in a fucked up head
aftershock dark woods and blurry lights

Graveyard sluts!
Graveyard sluts!
Graveyard sluts!
Ooooo!

Relentless, paranoid, volcanic lust
Primitive shines of a confused pulse
My burning riffs and rapish drums
A soundtrack to the wHory nuns

Graveyard sluts!
Graveyard sluts!
Graveyard sluts!
Wow!

All right!
(I) first saw you at the graveyard
nice rack n' all
Creepy &amp; lost in a fucked up head
aftershock dark woods and blurry lights
