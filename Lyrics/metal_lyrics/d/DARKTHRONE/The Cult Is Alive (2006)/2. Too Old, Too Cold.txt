[Music: N. Culto. Lyrics: Fenriz]

Nothing to prove
Just a hellish rock n' roll freak
You call your metal black?
Its just plastic lame and weak
We're to old to cold
To old and to cold

Second to none
Like an angel unâfuckingâborn
Done with people
Its done
Your attitude
It's still born
We're to old to fucking cold

Nothing to prove
Just a hellish rock n' roll freak
You call your metal black?
Its just plastic lame and weak
We're to old to cold
To old and to cold

Second to none
Like an angel unâfuckingâborn
Done with people
Its done
Your attitude
It's still born
We're to old to cold
To old and to cold
