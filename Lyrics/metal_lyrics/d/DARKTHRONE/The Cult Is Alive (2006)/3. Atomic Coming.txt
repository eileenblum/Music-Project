[Music Fenriz. Lyrics Fenriz]

Propare your swollen apathy
Or forge numerous sturdy platforms
Behemoth tankers of mankind
Are now leaking nuclear fear

Atomic coming! Prepare
Atomic coming! Forge
Atomic coming! Behold
Atomic coming! Uncertainty unfold

Choose your weapons, choose your direction
They're pulling rank through the clouds now
Or basking in the fossile smoke
No one left to fight but ourselves
HAHAHA

Atomic coming! Choose
Atomic coming! Pull through
Atomic coming! Disintegrate
Atomic coming! Fight till death

Fight till death
Choose your weapons, choose your direction

Atomic coming!

Atomic coming! Prepare
Atomic coming! Forge
Atomic coming! Behold
Atomic coming! Uncertainty unfold

Propare your swollen apathy
Or forge numerous sturdy platforms
Behemoth tankers of mankind
Are now leaking nuclear fear

Choose your weapons, choose your direction
They're pulling rank through the clouds now
Or basking in the fossile smoke
No one left to fight but ourselves

Atomic coming! Pull through
Disintegrate
Fight till death
