[Music N. Culto. Lyrics Fenriz]

666 steps ahead
I can not be traced
You sense my presence here
Like the fear of cancer

HAIL BABYLON!
The cult of Goliath
Scraping on my fence
Feeble religious slugs

You can not come inside
Inferior to the might
You criticize the Cult
Stumbling confidence under my blackfoot
Uh!

Hail Babylon!
The cult of Goliath
Superior crown wielder
Dome of exclution
