[Music N. Culto. Lyrics Fenriz]

Fuckin' forced to sleep
In this life
Enough time to be sober
In death

Whisky
Funeral
Whisky
Funeral

Brandish the brandy
Shrouds wave in fury
Raise the fever pitchers
To our glorious demise

Whisky
Funeral
Whisky
Funeral

Whisky
Funeral
Whisky
Funeral

Withdrawl trembling
This, the black weapon
Hear the roaring sensation
Of my fuckin' flamboyant wake

Whisky
Funeral
Whisky
Funeral

Fuck Off!
