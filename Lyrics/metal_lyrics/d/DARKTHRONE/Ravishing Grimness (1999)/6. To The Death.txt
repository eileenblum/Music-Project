Another Day
Of Misery Ablaze
Running Screaming From Insanity's Reign

(It's) A Living Nightmare
Confused Mind
Carpetbombed and Pierced
By Utter Psychic Havoc

Pinehill Salvation
To the Death
Sore Trembling Haven
When (the) Pain Overwhelms
(What if death won't set me free)

Under the King
Carnal Life
Hedonistic
Turning In (The) Animal
Alien, Unhuman
Detached from RAOM

Pinehll Salvation
To the Death
Sore Trembling Haven
When (the) Pain Overwhelms
(What if death can't set me free)

En Skygge Av Det Som Engang Var
I've become and Empty Soulside Shell
From my Solemn Hill in the Sunset
I throw myself to Grim Forverhell
