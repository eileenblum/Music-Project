Sex With Satan the loudest song
Sounds like a hammer from hell
Pyrokinesis and Take This Torch
Sounds that fill me with no remorse

Canadian Metal

Whimsical Uproar, Tortured Souls,
For these fuckin' sounds my angry heart calls
Canadian metal, just obey
On your weak sounds (new plastic metal) we will prey...
