You have nothing in common with me
you think old-school is 1993
ha! I've been a thrasher since '84
almost nothing sounds true anymore

I've made my own code
sold my soul to Manilla Road
modern metal I don't give a fuck
UH! I was raised on rock

It went plastic in '94
oh my god you're such a bore
if you don't understand what I mean
fucking listen to Venom's "Acid Queen"

I've made my own code
sold my soul to Manilla Road
modern metal I don't give a fuck
UH! I was raised on rock

[Solo]

raised on rock!
