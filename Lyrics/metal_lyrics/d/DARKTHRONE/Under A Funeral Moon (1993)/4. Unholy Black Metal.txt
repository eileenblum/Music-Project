When the sun has died
When the angels are blind
When the fog lies thick
Over the Palace of god

When the fullmoon lights the earth
When the wolves gather in the open
When blood rains from the heaven high
And from the pearly gates

When Jehovas hordes are slaughtered
When disciples twelve are dead
When beliefs of easter land
Are raped and raped again

When the whore of Babylon rides
When pity turns to hate
When all sons of Satan
Sodomise the lambs of Christ

When the gates have all been opened
When the funerals never end
When Satan's power paint our hearts
And satisfies our souls

When witches burn the priests
When the Ancient Ones return
When demons ride the nuns
With their horns of dark desire
