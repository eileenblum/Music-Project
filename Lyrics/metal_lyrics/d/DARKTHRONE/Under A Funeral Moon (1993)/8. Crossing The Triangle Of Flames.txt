Engulfed in frost
I sailed our dreams
Gloomy inner landscape comes to life

I am the wolf in the darkest scene
Phantasm sweep my role
I am lucifer, I bring you light and pride

Three steps for the white
A journey for the black
No flags for the ten lines
(but) I'll shoot you full of signs

In other dimensions
My visions grew black wings
You wouldn't know if I was him

The dragon rises before me
I'll fornicate the beast
Possess me as I burn
Into your painted realms
