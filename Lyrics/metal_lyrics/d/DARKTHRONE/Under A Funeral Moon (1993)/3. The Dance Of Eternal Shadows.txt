I must embrace visual hell
To satisfy us
Rape the whores in blasphemy
I am man while I feast upon your flesh

Glance in my eyes
and see the eternal shadows dancing
Playing in the desert of my life
Burning -
And my soul is descending...

Leader of all - face the apocalyps
You fools deep under the black rain
And nothing remains

Flowers to step on, flowers to burn

Am I ready for the god below
Red flesh to penetrate my skin
To send my soul away
To the grave I work
Until I'm feeling weak...

But there's fire
In my heart, in my eyes
In his body, in his eyes
And in his lonely kingdom
