Forward into this battle
that no one can win
Labyrinth trench on torn land
Sin origin, sin driven

I am of pride and contempt
A crossfire volunteer
Laughing while my world get trampled
Life is just a shadow of death

Absurd hopeless rivalry
Ubertragic trinity
the damned one, swan and sunray
Sick engine; the piston hammers away...

Unthankful future
stands frozen in the biting winter sun
crying as reality falls numb
Entertaining Satan on a wet electric stage
