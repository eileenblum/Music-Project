Dreary bitter soulsets
Life runs painfully gray down the walls of time
Clenching onto the void
Laming intense shivering terror

Evilution of the mind
Severe plunging lightning
Cracking, trembling, reeling
The world left behind

(the) Beast hovering greedily
Waiting (insanely) to do me in
Struggling exhausted to the cold paramounts
Sliding down the razorblade of life

Evilution of the mind
Severe plunging lightning
Cracking, trembling, reeling
The world leaves you blind
