Hung out to dry
Liquid rites engulf
Eaten alive
Again and again

It's raining murder here
and the caves are cold
I curse the skies
while the ground slides away

Sinking nowhere fast
Scorching upstream road
The chisel melts
And darkness falls forever

Too many words
fighting backwards
Suicide, down the hatch
This one's for the dog fight
