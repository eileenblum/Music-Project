Muscledistracting sicksphere
Lacerate, damage, wreak
Disintegrating lifeblood
Colliding spikes, unlife

Labyrinth contagious
The world means nothing now
Immer, always blasphemous
Scepter raised in fucken fury

Suicidal winning streak
Decisions held by steel fists
The frames constantly slipping
With repent the Reaper reaps...

Labyrinth contagious
The world means nothing now
Immer, always blasphemous
Scepter raised in hazy bloodrush
