There's too many struggles
There's too many fears
I've hardened my blood now
For so many years!
Uh!

I am the graves of the 80s
I am the risen dead
Destroy their modern metal
And bang your fucking head
Uh!

There's way too much black
And there's too little metal
Dealing with this had me breaking my shackles!

I am the graves of the 80s
I am the risen dead
Destroy their modern metal
And bang your fucking head
Destroy!

United by hatred...
Reborn through hate...
