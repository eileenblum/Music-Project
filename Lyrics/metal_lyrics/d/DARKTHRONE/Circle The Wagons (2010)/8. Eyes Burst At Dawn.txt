Struggled to awake for eons, merciless fate
Fingers moving, twisting sickly, silence is broken
Air is dead in this cave, dead as murdered
Only 10 feet crawling to get outside, black night
Hysterical laughter is hammering the stone walls

Ears bleeding... depressed

Overcoming psychical nightmares, starts crawling
Fingers broken, don't fucking care, move on

Outside the air is clean, cold and still
Eyes are open now, to see this dead night
Attacked by sudden fear, unknown constellations
Are threatening from above
Shivering cold, damaged brain, bleeding the blood
Alas, Deathstar is rising, finally to see this place
It gets brighter, hurting my eyes, can I bear this pain?

As my Deathstar is rising above the hills, my eyes burst
Pain so strong, havocing my head, it's dark again
