I am in a mountain cave
The night is playing outside
Seas yonder swim in starlight
Swirling fires grace the plains

There are treasures (the) night can't hide
And within me things no sun can see
This is where I stood my ground - opened gates for you and me

For each day that passes
I see more and more
Sometimes the universe opens
(and) the soul cries, hoarse and sore

Still I live for those moments
At least the ancient ones stand by my side
No matter how the human plagues weighs heavy
Night on earth can harbour eternal pride
