21 years of minimum wage
Got no problems with manual labour

You stepped up in the 90s, wanna show me how
Well, I don't need no fuckin' favour

[refrain:]
I am the working class!
All day
So I don't have to
See your face

I am the working class!
Discipline
The daybreak is when
I begin

I am the working class!
Each day
I bust my bones to
Get paid

I am the working class!
Damn straight
The daily grind is
My fate

Through 7 seas of alcohol
And a jail of dank depression
Well, I turned my back and where are you now?
...and I've bucked up for that recession

[refrain]
