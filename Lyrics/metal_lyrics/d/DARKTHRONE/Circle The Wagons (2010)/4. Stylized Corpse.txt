Walk around, like royalty
Just a stylized corpse
Life has reached the end
On the inside

Proud of what you have "achieved"
You'll soon see the truth, I'll show you
Grabbing my tools, I firmly believe
I'm your saviour and icon

Chain you to the wall
Blowtorch literally open your eyes
You feel superior now?
All you can do, is imagine my world
Let the chipmunks feast on your heart

Oh, this luxury life
All the juices of lies
Doesn't smell like a bowl of fruit
But I am strong and brute

Send you back among the dead
No one will see that you're born again
I'm your saviour, and I made your day
Sleeping in a pool of human debris
