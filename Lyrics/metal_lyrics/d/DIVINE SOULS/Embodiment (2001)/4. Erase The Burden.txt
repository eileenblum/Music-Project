One more day without my deepest love
Another day in sorrow
I struggle to survive from the
Life you left behind

But I know that our time will come again
When my life be erased from the burden
I'll be cherish the memories within my heart
In my dreams I hide

You gave me everything
The laughter filled my void
Lonely and unbearable
I leave this world behind

So I say farewell to the life
That I never wanted
Like a shadow I will disappear
Without a trace

Will it ever be the same again
Will we meet on a planet above
Or is it true what they say about heaven and hell
Or will I be reborn
