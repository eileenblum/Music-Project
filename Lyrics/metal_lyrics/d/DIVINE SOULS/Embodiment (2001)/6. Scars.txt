I never thought that it would end like this
I never wished for this burden of mine
Like a splinter I fall of every word that is said
A hopeless shadow in closing longing for my release

As I embrace the separation
Of flesh and of soul
A placid life turns to dust
I will depart

Like a well within my deepest wrath
Ripping through me like a plague of pain
Bursting out my cage of glass
I scorn life

Sever my heart rip my soul
Shred this useless life of mine
I can't bear these scars no more
I'm falling down I'm burning my soul
You can have this pain of mine
You can have it all I'm forever unbound

So many hours of fear loathing and remorse
Entangled in this web of self-denial
Like a venomous thorn in my heart
Silence fell with eyes wide shut
Failing the grace eternal
