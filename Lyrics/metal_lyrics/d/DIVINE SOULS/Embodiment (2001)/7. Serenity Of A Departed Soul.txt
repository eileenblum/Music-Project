Do you want to taste my pain
And to live in fear until the end of time
I will guide you towards the end
Behind the curtains you never seen
But I shall cherish your soul
Within my heart eternally
As I end your frail life

Its the calm before the storm
All your dreams have withdrew
A body deprived of its soul
I pursue my hate on you

You gave me scars within my heart
But they fade with you
My wounds will heal with your demise
As I crucified you on the cross
Your life ceased to exist immediately
As I ended your frail life

A precious soul so divine
The blackened heart turns to dust
A precious soul so divine
The serenity of a departed soul
