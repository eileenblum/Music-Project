I'm bleeding those crimson tears
From my soulless heart
In this void of emptiness
I'm drifting further and further away
All emotions have faded away
I'm losing my self in this hell
One colour is all that I see
The colour of blood pure red

When life slips away the body of man will rot
To be put in a casket six feet down and never wake up

I can't decide if I will take suicide
But the thoughts are raping my mind
After all I think I'm better of dead
Is this the end of my life

Let's roll the dice and face the fact
It's the end of my path
A sadly moment as I know it's about to end
Let's roll the dice and face the fact
It's the end of my path
As I opened my veins with a blade razorsharp

There will be no more sorrows
There will be no more fears
In death's cold embrace
My eternal slumber
