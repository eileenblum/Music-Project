How I long for that precious moment as one with the soil
Redeem my soul from my pitiful life
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust

A journey beyond all pleasant towards another existence
Through dimensions of burning souls my voyage ends

I'm just a marionette pulled by puppet strings
In the absence of light I scorn my wrathful demise

But I try to hide in a glade of gleaming darkness
I want let my soul stand ablaze I didn't vanished in vain

I'm forlorn yes I'm godforsaken in the pits of hell
All I wanted was to sleep forever inside my tomb of dusk
Divine angel you beautiful goddess embrace my soul with your wings
I ask you forgiveness for all my sins
I'm lost and I'm astray
