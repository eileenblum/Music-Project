Egypt the land of pyramids
Filled with legends of ancient gods and kings
A tale lives on about the one eyed god
Buried in a chamber deep within
Dusk so intact so bittersweet
Still the eye shines with it's beauty

The crimson crystal are shining
Red like a blood red sun
Guarded by the spirit of the one eyed soul
And his fetid corpse
And by the myth there shall be a curse
Of diabolical wrath
Chaos shall appear and the dark lord will
Reign your mind

He embody his soul with your flesh and bones
He redeem and cherish the heart of man
He embody his soul with your flesh and bones
One final silence a departed soul

Destination towards hell
Through purgatory and into the flames
The soul shall suffer a thousand deaths
In the fire your spirit ,explode
So intact so bittersweet
Still the eye shines with it's beauty
