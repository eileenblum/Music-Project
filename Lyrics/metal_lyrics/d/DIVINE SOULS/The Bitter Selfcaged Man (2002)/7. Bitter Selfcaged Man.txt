I'm so afraid
But I'm prepared for the worst
I keep crying myself to sleep
Forever gone, all I loved is lost

I'm sinking deeper and deeper down
Take my hand before I fall into the void of nothingness
I'm sinking deeper and deeper down
As I descend towards the bottom, a downfall of bitterness

Although it's said, it's said that life is so fragile
But I know it's best, the way it all have turned out
You cant help me from falling, I'm falling towards the end
It's like they say, misery loves company

After my demise
I adore the tranquil silence
My visions are lost
It ain't nothing left but memories
