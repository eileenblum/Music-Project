Don't think I'm bothered if you are sad
If you are drowning it's me who pull you down
You say you're sorry but I don't care
You're all alone without my sympathy

Well I'm sick and tired of all your complains
You're not the only one with a tortured soul
Who wants to hear the story of your life
One more word and I'll ease your pain

Behind the mask my bitter face
All emotions seems to be numb
You are heading for the fall
My desire is your misery

I cant forgive how much I try
I cant forget even if I want

The shame, the guilt - let go of the burden
I swallow my pride I erase my thoughts
Please spare me from your lies I scorn your deceit
From cradle to grave Now reconcile
