I gave you my heart but you took my soul
And you just threw it away
I have lost my pride I'm an empty shell
Covered with scars and open wounds

I were never yours to cherish or love
I cannot still forget your emptiness
The pain in my heart which you did cause
It will never go away how much i try
I cannot escape this pain

This was the final fatal blow of indifference
Which were buried beneath the foundation of lies
All that we had were simply shattered
This is just like the remnants of a tale gone black

There's no turning back no soothing of pain
The fever that rages overturnes control
Now when my world comes tumbling down
I stumble blindly towards the end
