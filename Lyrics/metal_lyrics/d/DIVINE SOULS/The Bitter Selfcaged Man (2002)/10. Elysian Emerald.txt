In this fallen kingdom, there's a sacred path
A secret trail only known by the gods
Here lies the wisdom to eternal life

Within the shrine the powers are sealed
This is the threshold to my dreams
As I opened the chest to immortality

Within the shrine I found the answers to infinite dreams
In my hand I hold the key to the wisdom of the gods

I have awakened the treasure within from it's eternal slumber
An ancient gift from aeons ago the elysian emerald now is mine

I inherit the force of life and death
The secret is revealed for me
This was a legacy from the gods
Let my kingdom come
