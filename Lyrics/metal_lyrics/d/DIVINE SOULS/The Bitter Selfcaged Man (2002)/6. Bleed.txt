With a crown of thorns, I'm impaled to the cross Forsaken and disowned, I'm blinded by my fear
One last crusade a final burden
I carried the cross to the hill
To face my bitter end

The masses are gathered, To watch me as I slip away
With spikes through my hands, This is my fate to be
One final breath before redemption
My soul demised from its womb
As my body was drained from blood

From the wounds in my hollow soul
I will bleed until I am dead
Then I transform into another shape and fly away
Pardon me if I rape an angel on my way
My soulless body has been erased and deleted

I say farewell, I say goodbye I leave this world behind
Like a flower I will wither until the end of time
Even though my soul is free I cant forget my dismal fate
When all is said and all is done, Pain shall be written in my soul
