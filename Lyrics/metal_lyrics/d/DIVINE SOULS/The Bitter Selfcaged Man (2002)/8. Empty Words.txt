I cannot be what you want
I will not preserve your image
Whatever pain you may bring
I cant feel your curse

Cause all the little pieces of me
Will turn the truth from your lies
I wont crave forgiveness
You keep tearing me blind

Of all the selfishness
You could be the image of me
From failure of detonation
I'm caged forever trapped

I will never be free, I cant control my mind
I hear your screams so alive
Tears of regret stings my eyes, I just want to be
One single heartbeat away from you
And your lies

Infectious bleeding
You're turning me insane
This I cannot comprehend
My hatred grows

Cause all the little pieces of me
Will turn the truth from your lies
I wont crave forgiveness
you keep tearing me blind

I will speak no more of my feelings
Cause they seem to disappear
From failure to termination
In my mind, my all, gone
