I see no reason to live this life
It's seems to be lost and bleak
A pale reflection is all thats left
Of the shine I once had
I've lost it all but my pain
And it never leaves me be
Ever since the cradle to the grave
I will live this life in hell

How could you be so cold, how could it be so wrong
How could you say those words, when you despised it all

Those empty words you said to me, those empty words I cannot bear
Our given time were such a waste, in solitude I fade away

I'm not the one with those empty words
I'm sick of all your lies
I trusted you but you betrayed
You stole my pride with your love
Pushed aside down the soil
I cant struggle no more
I guess I'll never understand why
You hurt me with your lies

I see those faces turning away, I see those faces fading out so cold
I feel there is no forgiveness, I feel there is failure everywhere
Time wont heal my torment, time wont make my life complete
Trust will only bring me pain, my life rapes me over and over again
I say farewell, I say goodbye I leave this world behind
Like a flower I will wither until the end of time
Even though my soul is free I cant forget my dismal fate
When all is said and all is done, Pain shall be written in my soul
