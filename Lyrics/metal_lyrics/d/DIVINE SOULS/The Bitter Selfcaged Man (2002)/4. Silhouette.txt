It's another day and another sorrow
A life in pain the pain is mine

Like an endless torture
That's tearing me apart
Rip my soul to shreds
Just reap what I have sown

I'm the bitter selfcaged man
With demons clinging unto me
I have lost my sympathy
This burden dies with me

As time goes by it's raping my mind
I got suicide thoughts I want to end it now
