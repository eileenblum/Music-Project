I feel it all, the hurting and the anguish but it is time for me to move on
Still it hurts, deep within my mind It's buried within my soul and my all

Will it break the silence, will it open my heart
Will it turn my face towards the sun
To feel the passion, to feel the joy
And lay my fears to die

I have become my darkest shadow and I fear I will shed my blood for you
Time will pass but pain is never-ending I'll spill my crimson gift for you

Will this end if I take my life today this hollow scar wont fade
I cannot love, not myself or you I only see you all as dead

I hear my voice, screaming your name
I'm ready to fall, into the black
Now I'll die
