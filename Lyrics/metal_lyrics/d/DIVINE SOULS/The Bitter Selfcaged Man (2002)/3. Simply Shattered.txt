Inside of me there's only hatred and sin
A demonic being that is feeding on me

Piece by piece, torned apart, I'm devoured by non divine
Day by day, an endless torture, that makes me weak it make me bleed
Raped by faith, deprived by god, everything comes bearing down
I lost it all, the pain wont end, I'm drowning in this bitter hell

I feel so numb by this tainted life
I'm a silhouette invisible
Like an autumn leaf I will wither away
I declare this my silent end

The plague evolve until life has ceased
I succumb and my spirit dissolve
