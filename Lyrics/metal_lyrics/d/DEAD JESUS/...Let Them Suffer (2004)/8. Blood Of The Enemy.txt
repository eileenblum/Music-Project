I stagger and fall in the alley bleeding profusely,
Spattering everywhere.
The war I just fought
Has left me mutilated, gaping wounds
I can't get this hated blood off me.
Peeled back flesh this putrid aroma besets me.
Choking on blood stained vomit.
Cornered and stricken, I fought with the violence
And hatred bred into men.
Blinded by anger, numb without fear
Let the enemy come.
Lungs feel like there going to explode.
Breathing fire.
This violent struggle
Has left me disarrayed and forgotten.
Painful images flaring across my mind
Where are they?
Where am I?
I am left here dying all alone.
Feel my pain.
Why did no one help me kill this enemy?
Why?
Why?
Is this world really out to get me?
Leave me be.
Suffer in silence, I can't explain why
We chose to fight.
The wounds I've sustained, ignore all the pain
But I can't be alright.
Wrists feel like they were split wide open
Like the scars all over my chest.
Razor blades scattered all over the ground
And I am the only one here.
I have lost this battle must embrace death.
Who ever did this to me Is really going to pay with their life.
Loss of blood really starting to get to me
Getting dizzy.
I can't believe it will end this way.
The light is starting to fade,
Mental pictures of my life going by, an ugly sight.
Now I lay reflecting on how I've defeated
Mankind's worst enemy.
Himself.
