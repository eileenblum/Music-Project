Since the beginning of time,
We've been warring for the divine.
That's the way we are.
Human mentality dictates that we should
Kill each other off.
Fighting for the stupidest of reasons-
Oil, religion, power.
Like a disease.
We'll keep spreading.
The end is near.
Complete bio failure.
Our grim future.
People breeding like lice and parasites.
Choking the earth.
Nature's immune system has started to kick in.
Humans are the virus.
New diseases are germinating,
They will wipe us out.
Like a disease.
We'll keep spreading.
The end is near.
Complete bio failure.
Our grim future.
Governments are way to powerful
Controlling us like little puppies.
Thinking that we can't think for ourselves
Yet they continue to lie, steal, and cheat.
Then claim they're always broke
With their taxes and corruption.
That's putting the drain on human life,
And bleeding us dry.
Amassed inside, internal bleeding.
Fortified, tubes for breathing.
Comatose, combative measure.
Overdose, for our pleasure.
Computerize, we're in the making.
Single cells, ripe for raping.
Intoxicants, inhale the species.
Now we're gone, it was way too easy.
Poison the earth and no one cares.
Pave the way to armageddon.
With toxic waste, contaminate.
Self destruct, dig your own grave.
Blood and stone, the seeds.
Empires continue to rise and fall.
We cycle on and on.
Amassed inside, internal bleeding.
Fortified, tubes for breathing.
Comatose, combative measure.
Overdose, for our pleasure.
Computerize, we're in the making.
Single cells, ripe for raping.
Intoxicants, inhale the species.
Now we're gone, it was way too easy.
No matter what we do
We will never be forgiven.
Time will always keep going
Even if we don't.
