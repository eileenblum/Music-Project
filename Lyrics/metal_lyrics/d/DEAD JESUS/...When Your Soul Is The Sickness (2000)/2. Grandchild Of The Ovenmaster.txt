I Hear jews screaming in agony.
I Follow orders.
Master to the flame.
One man with a different vision, out to save the superior race.
Blood streaming through the rivers of the nations,
Blinding colors blanketing the sky
With a brightening dispostion of death.
Propaganda spreading like brushfire.
Lies out of every mouth
With newspapers filled with deceit.
One accent will spread and destroy all.
Gasses flow.
Rockets flare.
Faces melt.
In the fire.
A million bullets.
Burn.
Completely wiped out.
Rot.
Scarred forever.
Decay.
No regrets.
Put to death.
Landfilled dreams.
Hatred.
Lest we forget.
Never.
Grandchild of the ovenmaster.
Smiles with delight at the creamtion.
100 Degrees of pure pleasure.
Wipe out the races for the cause.
Smiles of evil, pleasure, rotting flesh Lungs burst with flame.
Screaming, clawing, no way out
Unite all or die.
Grandchild of the ovenmaster.
Wipe out the masses, the desecretion.
Tonnes of steel an ominnous presence,
Destroying all it can see.
It doesn't matter, it doesn't care,
It only lives to kill.
Grandchild sitting on his throne,
In a field of bones.
Proof of blindness and the measures of war,
Control the population because we have to.
Torture of the mind.
Killing of the human spirit.
Breeding childern of hate.
Thriving on killing sprees,
So we can also have jobs of military rage.
