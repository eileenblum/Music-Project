An animal of not human descent,
Lying in the middle of the road,
Struck down in a very vulgar way.
Lying there, awaiting a slow agonizing death.
We drive by it.
It really catches our eye.
We love animal flesh especially, when it's warm.
A good fuck and then good eating,
No need for the creature to go to waste.
A good fuck and then good eating.
What else could a person ask for?
A good fuck and then good eating.
It's a finger fucking treat.
I go in from behind and drive it in,
Sink my teeth in at the same time
And tear a nice big chunk of flesh,
Where I chew and fuck, chew and fuck.
You have to do it just right or you just might choke.
A good fuck and then good eating.
What else could a person ask for?
A good fuck and then good eating.
It's a finger fucking treat.
Moo.
