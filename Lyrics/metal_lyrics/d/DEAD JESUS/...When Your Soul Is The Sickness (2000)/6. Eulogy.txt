Stanleys' carcass rots in silence,
Eulogized in ultraviolence,
An attack of the heart with brutalitiy in the mind,
A soul within his own private domain.
Now your just a clockwork corpse,
The shininng of a snow blind king
Couldn't await the darking,
Till death do him apart, with the final cut.
Veer to the left, writhing in pain.
Numb with eccentricity,
Voices finally made to stop.
Peircing through my frozen mind,
Land left so far behind.
In the fridged water, we all die.
Stan was the man
Who envisioned oddessy to ectasy
Hidden in my man-made world.
You can't escape it.
Making people see life,
The way we make it.
Making people think that
Everything around him is insane.
No cure for insanity from war to technolgy,
The struggle to survive,
To make it in this imperfect world.
Portrayed onto the big screen,
Mortality's little indescenities.
From sex to violence all the little mind games.
To die in this imperfect world.
Hidden in my man-made world.
You can't escape it.
Making people see life,
The way we make it.
I Stayed away, crushed by my own morality.
I Will rest now for eternitiy.
