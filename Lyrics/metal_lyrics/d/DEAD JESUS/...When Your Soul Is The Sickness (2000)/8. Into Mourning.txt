I
Wake one morning.
To dismal darkness.
It was kind of odd, it was about noon.
I go outside, and I can't feel
The sun anymore today.
The mourning has come.
Salt stings my eyes.
Drawn to the sun.
If only you knew...
It was if an ecumenical eclipse occured in my sleep,
Or if I was dead.
I Go back in, turn on the news
And everything seemed to be the norm,
But I turn and look and see my body lying there dead.
I
Have died.
I
Fell down and started to weep in my hands.
Tears of black soiled the floor into a pool.
I
Go back out with a horrified look on my face, I am so confused.
I
Wonder if
My spirit should wander out into the plains of black
To see if I can find an answer to death.
I Set forth through the black earth
To the point of no return.
The mourning has come.
Salt stings my eyes.
Drawn to the sun.
If only you knew...
I
Come to a gate where I break down the door,
Where, evil a lies.
Lust.
I
Will cause the dead to rise.
I
Will cause the dead to a rise and devour the living
And outnumber the mortals.
