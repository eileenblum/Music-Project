Forever setting sun.
I Welcome the awakening cold.
To become one with the earth again.
This infertile dream now ends.
As the moon a new beginning.
Eternal... and alone.
I Went for a walk late last night
In the midst of the fridgid evening
To clear the cobwebs out of my head.
My mind totally exausted from thought.
I Wander aimlessly through nowhere,
Yelling in anguish at the fucking air.
A pugnent stench surrounds my body.
I Fall down in the snow ptomaine begins.
Blood flowing out of my wrists onto
The angel white snow.
Dark juggernauts go through my mind.
How could I be so wrong?
How could I sacrifice my mortality to the beast?
Darkness setting in, I'm lost.
Lost in time, lost my mind.
I get up wandering aimlessly,
End up back at her place, time for the final talk,
It has to be done or my day should've never begun.
I Tell her I love her, but it never sunk in.
I Would do anything for you,
This is the final chapter and the end.
We talk and talk, blood gushing.
My brain can't handle it anymore,
The time has come where something has to be done.
It will end the way I envisioned it.
I go in the kitchen,
Pull out the biggest slicer of them all,
The one that will end it all,
As I am slicing our jugulars.
We will be together as one.
