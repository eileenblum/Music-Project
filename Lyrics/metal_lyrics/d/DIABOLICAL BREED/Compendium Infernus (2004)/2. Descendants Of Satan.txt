As cold as the silence embracing this world in the hour of power exposed.
Frozen stars that enlightens infernal art of black, magic profound.
Ingratiating darkness conquering mortal minds forlorn, sadistic ideas art born.
Ecstatic exitement misanthropically, fullbread descendants of Satan art we...
Worthy of being hated by God.
The order of chaos hast taken control, enchanting the wisdom of man.
Blossoming seeds of a dark intellect, by the hands of God untouched.
Heretic outcasts of Heaven ravaging the mortal realm for centuries of darkness to come.
Like wolves among sheep in christian herds upon tender souls shalt feast,
Praising the art of gluttony. Fullmoon light reflecting cruelty morbid,
A ruthless hangmans grunt to pathetic pleads. Black roses flourishing in beads of
Melting snow, telling tales of purity lost from which they grow.
Greatness beyond measurement swaddled in eternal darkness overpowering
Heavenly forces in desperate struggle for light.
I descended from the beast, a heritage divine. Forever faithful... I worship.
Prince of darkness, origin of all, in awe I kneel before thee.
As cold as the silence embracing this world in the hour of power exposed.
Frozen stars that enlightens minions that art bound to him... the one who bless the night.
Genesis torn to unholy fragments scattered in darkness opaque.
Before the fading image of a fallen regent divine, diabolical mayhem mystique.
May death take away those unwilling to fight for the ancestor's kingdom of might.
May the nights unholy spirits arise... Breeds out of Hell in nocturnal disguise.
Written gospels profane for pagan souls to preach, fading celestial lies.
Disintegrated remains of beauty abhor... an angel's face with the Devil's eyes.
We bleed for thee...
