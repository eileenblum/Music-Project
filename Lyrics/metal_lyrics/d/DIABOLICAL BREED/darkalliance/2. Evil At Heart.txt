One last screaming prayer from the youngest one of angels tonight.
One tear for each pair of demon eyes that stares at him from the dark.
Chaos breeds in this could autumn night, heaven's herd of sheep infiltrated
By bloodthirsty wolves in disguise. The prodigal son hast returned to claim
His rightful heritage.

Dark angels, evil at heart, once banished from the heavenly haven.
Former brothers of light, now marked by the heathen screams of the raven.
Listen to the pathetic screams of christ. Witness the death of god.
Lord Lucifer walks on sacred ground again to ensure eternal damnation for all humanity.

The unholy battle has ended at last, in this ruin that once was to be called paradise.
White ones defeated by an army so vast led by the figure... Antichrist.

By the power of the mighty pentagram and our lord's unholy name, a new world
Order innovated shalt be, by the sacrelegious souls of those who have fought
And died under the black banner of Satan.
