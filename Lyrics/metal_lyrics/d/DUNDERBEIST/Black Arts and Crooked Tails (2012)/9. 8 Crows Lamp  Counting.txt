Just put the stone in the crack
And dam up endless worries
thick liquid seeps on through the broken promises!
Bird for some, crow for all
They can't see that
A bird's a bird, not a fool

When the rooster's on
And the chickens run
The little crow at the back
Has found a loophole!

mean as hell evil dwells
They can't see that 
What is done can't be undone!
What is done can't be undone!

Keep looking at the sky
It is burning your eyes
now You can't see us!
What is done can't be undone!

Ein, Zwei, Drei, Vier!
8 figures, 16 eyes
Hear the crows are singing!
Hear the crows are singing!
Funf, Sechs, Sieben, Acht!
the wrath just multiplies
Hear the crows are singing!
Hear the crows are singing!

When the good season has passed
And all the vultures' gone
You pick the cream of the crop for your own pleasure!
false alarm, hmm something's wrong
It is us against them!

When the good season has passed

Ein, Zwei, Drei, Vier!
8 figures, 16 eyes
Hear the crows are singing!
Hear the crows are singing!
Funf, Sechs, Sieben, Acht!
the wrath just multiplies
sign the name

RAM-BEIST
Ein, Zwei, Drei, Vier!
the wrath just multiplies
Funf, Sechs, Sieben, Acht!
Hear the crows are singing!
Hear the crows are singing!
