For all what's worth
I meant those silly questions
About who you really are
About how you want to see yourself with me

For all what's worth
I meant that struck of empathy
I really want to be the hero here
And of all those freaking clues

For all what's worth!
I meant those silly questions!
About who you really are!
About how you want to see yourself!
So hear me now baby, just hear me now baby!

For better!
For worse!
Through thick and thin
And all the way through the after! Life!
It's always been this way
It's how it's supposed to be
It's you and me 
In a big canoe!
That floats through life!
So paddle and paddle us home!

Of all those words
None of them came just out of sympathy
They were all spoken as the truth
They were all tokens of my honesty
you hear

Of all those words
Came from the need to understand your lost
It came from the need to understand the pain
That this life has forced on you.

Of all those words!
None of them came just out of sympathy!
They were all spoken as the truth!
They were all tokens of my honesty!

Of all those words!
They came from the need to understand your lost!
It came from the need to understand the pain!
That this life has forced on you!
So hear me now baby, just hear me now baby!

For better!
For worse!
Through thick and thin
And all the way through the after! Life!
It's always been this way
It's how it's supposed to be
It's you and me 
In a big canoe!
That floats through life!
So battle and battle us home!

So paddle us home!
So paddle us home!
So paddle us home!
So paddle us home!
Yeah!
