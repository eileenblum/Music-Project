These little drops of sweat assembles, builds a whole
An embodiment of reactions to the people you know
You hold your breath for the secound slip of the tongue
In numbing fear of the golem created when all went wrong.

Fear and loathing building body
Fear and loathing building body.

The bastard climbs out of his hole
And draws his first breath of air
At the dawn of his first encounter of this new world
The newborn climbs out of his hole
And stares his maker down
Building his strength
Of your need to suppress this new body, body, body.

These little drops of sweat assembles, builds a whole
An embodiment of reactions to the people you know
You hold your breath for the secound slip of the tongue
In numbing fear of the golem created when all went wrong.

Fear and loathing building body.
Fear and loathing building body.

I wonÂ´t let this build up inside of me
I wonÂ´t let it out of his hole
But as a product of my imagination
It sure as hell feels alive.

Fear and loathing building body.

Build a better me build a better you
I canÂ´t kill the stenche of this body its body

These little drops of sweat assembles, builds a whole
An embodiment of reactions to the people you know
You hold your breath for the secound slip of the tongue
In numbing fear of the golem created when all went wrong.
