Hmaiaiaaai!Hahaha!
D-DU-DU-DU-DU-DUNDERBEIST!

The only time you see your shadows and
Then you're ///
Just when you feed the drrum machine
With the coldest ha-hahahands

And if anyone could tell you that
That you've beat the shadows
By turning around and face
The sun!

Hmaiaiaaai!Hahaha!
Maaiiaheeeaa!
(D-DU-DU-DU-DU-DUNDERBEIST!)
Hmaiaiaaai!Hahaha!
Maaiiaheeeaa!

I want to
Show you
That you know
Nothing!
Nothing at all!

But if I should be the one
To carry the wei-ei-eight
Or the torch for you
Then you should give me a reason.
But I don't want to!
(I don't want to be seen with you!)

If you could manage to watch the night
(Hmaiaiaaai!Hahaha!)
The darkness is rumbling around you
(Maaiiaheeeaa!)
Then you would see that it's not only I
(Hmaiaiaaai!Hahaha!)
That don't want to be seen with you!
(Maaiiaheeeaa!)

If you could manage to watch the night
(Hmaiaiaaai!Hahaha!)
The darkness is rumbling around you
(Maaiiaheeeaa!)
Then you would see that it's not only I
(Hmaiaiaaai!Hahaha!)
That don't want to be seen with you!
(Maaiiaheeeaa!)
(Want to be seen with you!)

So
There is no time to fix you
There is no time to heal
There is no time to fix you
There is not enough time to heal
There is no time to fix you
There is no time to heal
There is no time to rescue you
There is not enough time to heal
There is no time to fix you
There is no time to heal
There is no time to rescue you
There is not enough time to heal

(SEEN  with you!)

If you could manage to watch the night
The darkness is rumbling around you
Then you would see that it's not only I
That don't want to be seen with you!
