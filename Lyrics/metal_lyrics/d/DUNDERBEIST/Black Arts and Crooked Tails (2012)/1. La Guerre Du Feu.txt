This whole bottle of hope has been crushed and left at the gates
This whole reason to seek the truth has been flushed deep down the drains
And then all of your peers settle for less, less than what you could afford
Gather all of your fears, aim for the unknown. DestinyÂ´s best faced alone

The weight won`t be put onto someone else
La guerre du feu

Once all of this hopelessness has been carved deep into stone
And the plainness of your own life has been a ride towards this hate
Let go all your fears, and count what is left. Dive into oblivion
And then all of your friends settle for less, less then what you ever could afford

By the time you speak your mind it will be lost
By the time you speak your mind
Onwards meaning be all what you have become
Onwards menaing do all what you havenÂ´t done

And then all of your friends settle for less, less than what you could afford
So you roll up your sleeves and cling to your pledge
Destined to Carry the torch and go forth alone. All alone.

About time to show some real muscle
The lord of the flames
Carries the weight
