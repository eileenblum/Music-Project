so you seriously thing you got the antidote?
Well. Could it be that that is the problem?
It's in the flesh
Through veins in your heart
A black caress
So, addictive
Gotta have it gotta have it now!
Craves it, wants it need to feel it body aching
Gotta have it gotta have it now!
Gotta have that: tiny fix it's just one more fix
Give it to me Give it to me now!
So you crave it, want it need reliving
now! 
You need one more hit!

Beaten by yourself. WAR!
One by one they fall. WAR!
Color of your heart is black. WAR!
Damn! You got it got it!

Give me more of it. give me more of it gimme.
Give me more of it. give me more of it gimme.

There came the offer
Oh tempting haunting you
The force of craving nature
Is rambling behind the steering wheel

Give me more
Beaten by yourself
Give me more
One by one you fall
Give me more
Color of their heart is black
Give me more
Damn! You got it got it

Be whole again
Fulfill that void of primal mating needs
Set fire again to the furnace of your loudest happy end

Set fire again
Open the doors to your personal hell
Set fire again
Open the doors to your heart
Be whole again
You cannot escape from this constantly
Nagging to be back to start
Beaten by yourself. WAR!
One by one they fall. WAR!
Color of your heart is black. WAR!
Damn! You got it
