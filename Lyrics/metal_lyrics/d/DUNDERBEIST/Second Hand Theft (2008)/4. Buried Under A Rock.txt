It's all a breeze
And you feel like it's all over
A rush of blood to your head

They never said a thing about
When the seasons changed and you're buckled up

Cowboy,
Your second hand is too slow
And you know
Just step down
Don't come around
And let them run
And take cover

When you light the fuse you hear
"Kombaya!"
or you might get burned
There is something about you that fits in a turn!

When you light the fuse you hear
"Kombaya!"

You'll burned
There is something about you that fits in a tube
And I'll know you'll see one soon!
Yeah, that's right!
You ain't got nothing to step up in here ladyboy! Hahah!

I see dust surrounding your ankles and heels
Feeling it all cooked in the sun

As I rolling down the street
But I don't remove my eyes from you
Cowboy,
It's too late
It's soon bed

Just step down
And turn around

And take cover!

When you light the fuse you hear
"Kombaya!"
or you might get burned
There is something about you that fits in a turn!

When you light the fuse you hear
"Kombaya!"

You'll get burned

When the sun goes down
And the crows are leaving
You hear a "clik-clak"-sound
