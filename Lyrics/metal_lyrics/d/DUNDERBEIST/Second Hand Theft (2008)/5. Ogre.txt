Breaking a door in that
Who wasn't supposed to be open, no
Eating a course that I wasn't
Supposed to be tasting, no

Well I always thought that I
Never could end up like this (NO!)
Saying those words that (BLABLABLA)
Sounds best unspoken!

Well I know you celebrate
The death of my good fortune!
Of all the labels you could have ate
You got the worst damn meat
It went up and choking me

But was she really that bad? (Oh yeah!)
I guess she was...
Fooling around blind
Her day break blind

I shut it all and
See no evil, hear no evil...
Just saying those words that sounds
Sounds best unspoken!

Well I know you celebrate
The death of my good fortune!
But if I was the one to tell
You how
You'd know this
Honest
Heartless
Why it is
And I'm sure you
Would break it
I'm ..
Because..
I labeled you an ogre
A demon and a foul
I labeled you an ogress
That's all they're all about!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah!
I labeled you an ogre!
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah!
Im sorry for what you become!

And I know you celebrate!
The death of my good fortune!
But if I was the one to tell
Well now I should shut the fuck up...
