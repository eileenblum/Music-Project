Oooh!
Dunder! Dunder! Dunder! Dunder!
Dunder! Dunder! Dunder! Dunder!

Theres Something creeping out
Something fully understandable
Between two moments
With one moment
That is seariously un-comf-ortab-le!
The blood runs cold
(Down your back)

When the lights are out
And the shadow's reaching out for you!
Your'e either beating oh now
Be careful what you do!
When you listening
I know you hear.. This:

Hey!
??
Hey!
Her taste so bitter!
Oh yeah!
Eeh!
Dunder! Dunder! Dunder! Dunder!

You tipety-toe a withedy-with yourself
In your own disease!
You see the ghost!
Your former actions
Line in front of you.
Move Silently!

Could you hold your breath?
Don't Cough!
And then you got some fingers
Praying that this night will pass!

There is always one that is up about!
You want to wander
Off into oblivion
But no!
Dunder hunts you down, down, down, down, down!

Hey!
??
Hey!
Her taste so bitter-ohyeah!

Eh! Dunder!
Ah-i-ah-i-ah-it's here! (BEIST!)
To feed!
Ah-i-ah-i-ah-it's here! (BEIST!)
To feed, yeah!

Just lock up your doors
And shut the darkness in!

You hear them slice on your walls
The beast that freeze underneath your skin

Can you feel it battering in your eardrums when it wants to get in..
It's here...

[Whistling]

Ah-i-ah-i-ah-it's here!
Can you feel the presence
Of the being that we're / to see?
Ah-i-ah-i-ah-it's here!
Can you feel it battering in your eardrums when it wants to get in?
Ah-i-ah-i-ah-it's here!
Can you feel the presence
Of the being that we're / to see?
Ah-i-ah-i-ah-it's here!
Can you feel it battering in your eardrums when it wants to get in?
