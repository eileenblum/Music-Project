Hi my good neighbour,
Wow, you see me naked through the
looking glass you got.
(I know you got it, got it, got it)
Well by the time you read the paper
I've got six hundred little shivers,
From the porn that I just watched. (Muhahahahahaha!)

You see whenever I leave,
You know I've got you deceived,
Cause I'll be running around right to your side
And hide right under your sleeve.

It's time
On rhyme
I got your dime
Six times
What are your faultlines
As a crime
You'll know why

And if you find the right binoculars
And if you poke through your peephole
Then I'd know, that you know that
I know that you're fucked

You know the story goes,
That if you're friend or a foe
If you break into my private life,
I'll show you stuff that makes you choke.
You know the story goes,
That if you're friend or a foe
If you break into my private life,
I'll show you stuff that makes you choke.

Do you get it get get it?
Do you get it get it get it
Do you get it get it get it
You're too slow!

You see whenever i leave,
You know I got you deceived,
Cause I run around right to your side
And hide right under your sleeve.

And so the story goes, that if you're friend or a foe
You cannot poke your nose
In my backyard before I've told you so.
And so the story goes,
If you're a beggar or a horse
If you break into my private life I'll show you stuff
That'll make you choke

You know the story goes,
That if you're friend or a foe
If you break into my private life,
I'll show you stuff that makes you choke.
So the story goes,
That if you're friend or a foe
If you break into my private life,
I'll show you stuff that makes you choke.

You see whenever I leave,
You know I've got you deceived,
Cause I'll be running around right to your side
And hide right under your sleeve.

Do you get it get get it?
Well do you get it get it get it
Well do you get it get it get it
You're too slow
