The undead has a dream
I'll tell you lads
The sound proof for some dark, dark matter!
To raise hell at the gates
Death is knocking on the door
The truth they ache for
Something more!

This front has not been taken
From a dream you wont be waking
Up the boost and hit hard 'gainst the ground!

Just hold the line
I'll cut you up
One leg at the time!
Truth and dare
You move!

Back into back into, back into line!
Hold it,
Shields Aligned!
Hold formation!
Wait for my sign!
Hold it!
Hooold!

(Wait!)

Back into line!
Hold it,
Shields Aligned!
Hold formation!
Wait for my sign!
Hold it!
Hooold!

Duuuuh! 
Duuuuuuuh!

Cold moon 
Hold them all so mezmerized
RRumbling ground 
Tells a tale of something bigger!
The woods is black, 
Call this dawn beeing trampled on!
But the bones of the dead,
Death! That vigorous spell.

This front has not been taken
From a dream you wont be waking
Up the boost and hit hard 'gainst the ground!

Just hold the line
I'll cut you up
One leg at the time!
Truth and dare
You move!

Back into back into, back into line!
Hold it,
Shields Aligned!
Hold formation!
Wait for my sign!
Hold it!
Hold!

(Wait!)

Back into line!
Hold it,
Shields Aligned!
Hold formation!
Wait for my sign!
Hold it!
Hold!

When the bridges are burned
And the tables are turned
And the greavest have changed
And the finger is pointing at you! Ooh!

So,
Lonely the king
The old king
He has said Such a wonderful thing
But the finger is still! AH! Pointing at you!

Ooh, now.
What do you do?
(Hoooh!)

Get back into, back into, back into, back into!
Back in to line!
Hold it,
Shields Aligned!
Hold formation!
Wait for my sign!
Hold it!
Hold!

(Wait!)

Back into line!
Hold it,
Shields Aligned!
Hold formation!
Wait for my sign!
Hold it!
Hold!

Duuuuh! Duuuuuh!
Duuuuh! Duuuuuuuh!
