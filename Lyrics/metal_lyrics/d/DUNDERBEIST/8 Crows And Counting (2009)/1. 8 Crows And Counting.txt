Just put the stone in the crack
And then aband these worries
Through
Through broken promises!
(better for some...

They can't see that
A bird's a bird, not a fool

When the rooster's on
And the chick is hung
The little crow at the back
Has found a loophole!

As hell
Evil wells

They can't see that
What is done can't be undone!
What is done can't be undone!

Keep looking at the side
It's plenty allright
You can't see us!
What is done can't be undone!

Ein, Zwei, Drei, Vier!

Hear the crows are singing!
Hear the crows are singing!
Funf, Sechs, Sieben, Acht!

Hear the crows are singing!
Hear the crows are singing!

When the good season has passed
And all the vultures' home
You pick the cream of the crop
For your own pleasure!
Damage's done!
One by one!
It is us against.. Them!

When the good season has passed

Ein, Zwei, Drei, Vier!

Hear the crows are singing!

Funf, Sechs Ziben Acht!

Hear the birds...

Ein! 
Zwei!

Funf!
Sechs!
Siben!
Acht!

Ah-ah-ah! Ah-ah-ah!
Hear the crows are singing!
Hear the crows are singing!

Ah-ah-ah! Ah-ah-ah!
Hear the crows are singing!
Hear the crows are singing!

Ah-ah-ah! Ah-ah-ah!
Hear the crows are singing!

Ah-ah-ah! Ah-ah-ah!
Hear the crows are singing!
