The greener lace
The lace are dawning under
The white haze
That pushes hard up through
It pushes, it pushes hard up through

The new day
Goes longer, come what
Come what may
Its a new start
Well its a, well its a brand new start!

The white haze
The light days
A subtle trace of the new bed ofÂ ??
A new face of warmonger passion
A season's born
And another one is torn asunder!

Now could you do it, could you, could you, could you do it, do it?
Could you, could you do it, could you follow your heart?
???
Say what you want, don't cover it!

Now could you do it, could you, could you, could you do it, do it?
Could you could you pull it, could you pull this one off?
Expose your heart I don't possess it
Say what you want, and go for it!

It's all gone
But a day, what a day of the
??, but never mind, never mind
No one can dare to do that to me
I say what I'm supposed to say and

So what's the cost of this bloody out-roar?
Tell me, what's the cost of this shit?
Just cause you don't agree with me yet
It doesn't mean that its I that have got it all wrong

The white haze
The light days
A subtle trace of the newÂ ??
A new face of warmonger passion
A season's born
And another one is torn asunder!

Now could you do it, could you, could you, could you do it, do it?
Could you, could you do it, could you follow your heart?
??
Say what you want, don't cover it!

Now could you do it, could you, could you, could you do it, do it?
Could you could you pull it, could you pull this one off?
One bad call
In this house of cards!

You'd ruin it should you
Stick to it and
Let the numbness run it's course

Don't leave it like this!
Don't leave it like this!

Now could you do it, could you, could you, could you do it, do it?
Could you, could you do it, could you follow your heart?
??
Say what you want, don't cover it!

Now could you do it, could you, could you, could you do it, do it?
Could you could you pull it, could you pull this one off?
One bad call
In this house of cards!
