Hoo!

Hey! Your words are going home
My gracious lady's on
You're really like a picture book, you're...
Hey! You're like a corner stone
All better, all flesh and bone!
A reason to end up:

Carving, carving. Carving, carving
Carving your name on my arm!

Hey! Yeah!

Hey! You watch it grab my shield
A sword of diligence

I know you're needing it
I will be feeding it
And it serves you right!

Hey! We're building on solid ground!
No one can tear it down!
You made me strong enough...

To be carving, carving. Carving, carving
Carving your name...

Whenever I keep trying
To make this shit work and
Brace myself for this life
Whenever I keep hiding
These things that make me me 
And suffocates the rest of me

Whenever I keep trying
To make this shit work and
Brace myself for this life
Whenever I keep hiding
These things that make me me 
And suffocates the rest of me

Hey! Yeah!
Hoo!
Yeah!

I keep on
Carving, carving. Carving, carving
Carving your name in my arm!

(Carving, carving, carving your name!)
