Remember the good times
Remember the good times
Out from the ashes
arose a little flame crusted hafling,
a bastard of a half-breed
He shook his head one time,
and then raced right for the front line.
Some colors is needed some colors are needed
For the transition of all the crap back into the norm
The world is bright if you remember all the good times
remember all the good times
remember all the good times

The winter passes by the air gets richer the white in the woods
seeps away through the ground: it's an end to the cold

a sudden turn of events made this
The turning point for the bastard's new horizon
He shines, and grins and growls and howls
and make the changes worth while in time
So, whatever is done, wherever you go 
whatever you do, whatever you choose
Whatever you want, be well prepared to battle the front
you're second to none
The path is laid out, just walk it and welcome the result
it's hidden you won't know it till you see for yourself

Will it ever be uncovered?
So much for the path
that you found buried under the white snow,
Walk young soldier, walk your way home
Whatever is back in the cold
absorbes the warmth from the one

So eager to be there
The one thats always there for you
At dawn the only one we trust
The sun the only one to trust

remember all the good times
remember all the good times

The winter passes by the air gets richer the white in the woods
seeps away through the ground
it's an end to the cold
and a way to recall a season of prosper and awe.

welcome to the sunlight
it's an end to it all.
