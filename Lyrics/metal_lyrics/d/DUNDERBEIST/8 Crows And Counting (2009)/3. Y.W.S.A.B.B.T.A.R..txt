You needed something I'll be there, then revenge...
You wanted to make sure 
That you control the where and why and what and the ifs...
But when the shore 
Have been torn and the

And the end was staring at you
You see the payback you sought
Had been lost in the process 
Of being the other fool...

[Latin]

Enough, enough
Know your good intentions!
Enough, enough
Transparent well meant lies!
Enough, enough
So called good intentions!
Enough, Enough
Release and then it slide!

But bohoho!
You feeling trampled on 
by my victorious boots!
You know that all that you do
Is keep on digging your own grave
To rot in to

And you're forever the one 
With the gun when the smoke clears

Enough, enough
Know your good intentions!
Enough, enough
Transparent well meant lies!
Enough, enough
So called good intentions!
Enough, Enough

I could smell it from a mile away!
The devious betrayal!
Betrayal!

Enough, enough
Know your good intentions!
Enough, enough
Transparent well meant lies!
Enough, enough
So called good intentions!
Enough, Enough
Release and then it slide!

(Enough, enough!)
Transparent well meant lies!
(Enough, enough!)
Release and let it slide!
