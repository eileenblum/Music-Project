One man said to me
That mankind never learns from history
Now I understand so well his mention
Memories of long lost time
I'm facing all my doubts inside
Is there something I should know
That you won't tell me
Senseless actions
Devastating realistic genocide
The threshold bursts upon the point of climax
Forgotten years

I'll hide my tears
I'm feeling that I'm thrown again
Down for execution
Through the floury shades of mist
I see a light shining
Gates of love and gates of hate
Facing insignificance
All I ever dreamed about
Buried in the rain of tears

Ride the snake and ride the thunder
Through the acid tears we cry
How could we forget the celebration
Chilled to the marrow of serenity
Or is it still the pouring rain
We know it's not the rape of virtue
November fears, November tears
Abuse them all, abused for years
Being torn is our contribution
November fears
