Feelings of an ocean in pain
Dreams of wars I can not explain
I thought about the ancient blood
I watched the frozen pictures from our God
The 10 commandments are they so real?
You shall not murder, you shall not steal

Jesus Christ they wrapped in chains
Ancestors of the ghost of Cain
Witches convicted to burn in flames
The inquisition played their holy games
The crusaders with their cross of the dead
A machine gun etiquette is the head

I can't go on, I'm falling from you
I can't go on, feels like I'm losing ground
I can't go on, tearing all our lives apart
I can't go on bowing to your God

With one foot in the new millennium
The other buried in sanctum sanctorum
Frightening shadows of history
Holy wars, the holocaust nothing but misery
The words are venomous disguised to thrill
Should the image of God destroy, rape and kill?

I won't bow to a killer in disguise
I won't bow to a xenophobic agitator
I won't bow to the churches or the priests
I won't bow to the Lord of Lies

The Lord of Lies
A killer in disguise
The Lord of Lies
A killer in disguise
Jesus Christ
An erotic sacrifice
