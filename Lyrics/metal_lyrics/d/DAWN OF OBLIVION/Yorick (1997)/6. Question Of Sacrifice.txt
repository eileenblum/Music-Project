The darkness keeps me in the distance
I hold it back, I keep it out of reach from the light
Will they ever hear a fervent prayer
Will they listen to me
Will they ever take me out from the night

I cannot choose my own destiny
But what's the purpose, I hope it will be a merciful fate
Come dance with me, we'll hide together
And share your strength with me
To break the hypocrite's gate

Is it a question of time?
Is it a question of love?
Is it a question of being kind?
No it's a question of sacrifice

Are these raven's of gold, or are they of ashes
If the kingdom will come, I've been waiting so long
But life is short, I'm getting older
With all running figures around
These are the days we belong

The bloodstained faces appears in the attic
Full of lies, full of hate, full of doublemoral bullshit
The drowning truth, what's the problem
When nothing makes sense
I'll never be the one to admit

Why is it so hard to say: I'm sorry
Why is it so hard to say: I was wrong
Why is it so hard to say: It was my fault
When it is so easy to deceive, lie and betray
