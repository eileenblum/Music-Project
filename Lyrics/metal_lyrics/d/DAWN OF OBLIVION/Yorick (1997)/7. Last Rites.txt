He watches from a dull old thousand land
Over the smoke and over corpse's mirrors
As the whispers of sadness if he should forget it all
And kill as they want to cause the effect

Rage and ravage, exterminate and kill on the road to sorrow
He took the mourning train to watch the sun go down
Bodies floating over the messiah never returned
And bodies floating over Europe blood is all around

Watches from a pale and bitter face
What went wrong
Watches from a pale and bitter face
These last rites

Conjuring to the time to hold on for a second
An ancient gallery of memories flows up into his mind
A picture of his mother as she kisses him goodbye
The day he marched away to finally be a man

This world of fireworks and guns of insanity
There'll be no such things as saints and martyrs
Engine calling on the electric way, laughing corpses
This is not his country, or religion
He shouldn't be there at all

Purgatory's closing in
