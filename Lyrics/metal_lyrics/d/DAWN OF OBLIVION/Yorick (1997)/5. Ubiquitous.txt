I'm sitting here alone again
I'm praying for time
Time to heal my wounds
And time to make up my mind
I don't want anybody to touch my soul
Just leave me alone
'Cos I've been burned once before

It is in the air, it is everywhere
The smile on your face is on a dead skull
The air is thin, my mind is filled with darkness and pain
And I am the clown who forgot how to laugh

Love brings you problems and worries
Love brings you hatred and lies
Love is never what you want it to be
So why should we fall in love

In love, in love, in love
Falling in love

I think about the past, how I was fading away
Away from reality, rebirth in midwinter pain
I can wait for hours, I can wait my whole life
I can watch the stars above and wish I'll go there
Some day...

It was in the air, it was everywhere
The smile on your face, my God it was a dead skull
The air was thin, my mind was filled with darkness and pain
And I was the clown, but I couldn't laugh

I will never watch myself turn back again
My suffered brain just screams: "No more!"
As I know that you will find it everywhere
So I just want to be alone

Alone, alone, alone
Leave me alone
Falling in love, in love, in love
Falling in love
Leave me alone, alone, alone
Leave me alone, alone, alone
I'm sick of you
I'm sick of it all
I'm sick of everything...!
