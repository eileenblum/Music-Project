I watch a world under siege
I watch a world out of relief
The twisted bodies of our youth
Taste the shame of their own blood
The age of wrath, we're all doomed to die
But justice is far from our hands
I don't know what they're trying to prove
Hate your neighbour if he's not like you

I could stand here just for the night
I could watch the children cry
Burning houses, empty rooms
Face the new world

A young sweet girl is going to bed
She's anxious 'cause she's not going alone
Her own father wants to feel her
Sex! Sex! Sex! Sex!
It's not sex, it's not love, it's awful waste
She will never feel the love to a man
His incestuous addiction destroys her life
It's not a fiction, it's everywhere
Take me out of this place, out of this hate
The Chaos surrounds us hour by hour
If the world is Charon then what is hell?

Come to me
Come and see
Come to me

This path is long, an eternal inferno
Who gives the right to take a life in one's hands
If you don't have the knowledge
To resurrect one from the dead
You should not be so eager to deal death sentences
While they're killing themselves on the Balkan
For country, for colours, for religion
We're all the same
We're all the same

If God exists, well is he proud of this?
