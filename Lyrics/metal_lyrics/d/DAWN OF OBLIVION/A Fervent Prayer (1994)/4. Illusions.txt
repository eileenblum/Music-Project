I hail them again "my friends"
The brothers and sisters of my life
They're black, so dark and white, my light
They're playing on the razor's edge
So guide me to the paradise
This compulsion makes me feel like hell
Makes me feel like hell

It's a long, long way to live that life
It's a long, long time to suffer, my love
I feel, I think and I have feelings
I can also cry
You see, I can
Or is this just illusions for me, for you
Or for them...

I listen to the radio
But I can just read the papers
It's the same so I say
Fighting for peace
Is like fucking for virginity
Like fucking for virginity!

Why do they have to steal our love
Why do they have to steal our lives
Why do they have to steal our friends
It's for nothing like all the rest

After a while what have I got
Nothing they just kicked me out
After a while what have we got
Nothing they just kicked us, kicked us out
