Remember how to live in the dark
Still remember snowflakes in my throat
I was dragged in, who dragged me out
How was I supposed to get it through

I can still wake up frightened
Afraid of going back
God I'm so glad it's over
Who has the faith in me

I thought I had the size of the ocean
I didn't know I was just a pond
I took the keys, I took the truth
Just for going down and watch Lucifer smile

And the light was guarding me
Through the gates so open and wide for me
I could watch the flowers, I could watch the sun
These things that has been held for me so blind
And I looked at my shadow who lived in vain
I tore it apart, I threw it away
And finally I had reached the dawn
Finally I could seize the day, but

These days were covered in black
Black curtains of suicide
As I thought my time was over
I saw the eyes of faith
