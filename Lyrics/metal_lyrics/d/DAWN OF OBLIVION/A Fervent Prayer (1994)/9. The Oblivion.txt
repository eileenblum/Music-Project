She sits in a room, tries to remember
What to do next for pleasure and pain
It hurts so bad to think about
The day he left her in the rain
In the rain, rain, rain

One day, one day, one day oblivion
The weight/wait is gone
One day, one day, dawn of oblivion
She will find herself in distance
When it's done

Her finger's on the pot, don't open it
It can't help you from this pain
But understand these words he said
"You can't get everything and use it all"
Now listen girl, don't try this way
It's something you just got to understand

She sits in a room, tries to remember
What to do next for pleasure and pain
It hurts so bad to think about
The day he left her in the rain
No don't lose your mind
