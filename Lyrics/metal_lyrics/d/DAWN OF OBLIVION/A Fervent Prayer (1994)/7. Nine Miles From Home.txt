Pictures of grey, they fade in black
I'm running through the flowers of dust
The breathing walls comes like snow
I thought it was you, or was it just a picture
I'm falling again, I'm falling to the last chamber

So here it is these walls of glass
To release our sins, I'm riding on
Try to find the passage back to you
Why am I alone again
I see that there's no time to ask you why
I'm stranded nine miles from home

Can't find it
Remembering how they always told you, have some fun
But I could not feel, maybe I just carried on
So don't walk with me, feel the pain that tears inside you
Let the engine blow and don't look sideways
It makes me vomit

So I try to breathe just one more time
I see the raven's landing now
These pictures they are calling for death
I'm waiting for the sun to appear
To show the world how it really looks
I'm stranded nine miles from home

Home
From Home
Home

I try to breathe...
