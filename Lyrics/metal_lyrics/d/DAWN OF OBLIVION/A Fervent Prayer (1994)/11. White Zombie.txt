I don't believe a word you say
It will carry me towards a rising hell
I see no future there
All I see is faces that is laughing at me
So take this picture
And throw it away in the wind
So you can leave me here
With the vulture's all around

Feelings of love and hate
Feelings that I can't relate
Should I cry or should I die
Kill the day, kill the night
Will I never ever do something right
I'm stuck in here with my nightmare

Everything was happening so fast
Though it seems like 15 years
You came in front of me
But I never thought you came from the dead
Leave me and take those eyes
Away from me, away from all my tears
So act like you used to do
A living cold machine from hell

Calling the white zombie
Kissing the white zombie
Loving the white zombie
So love, ooh love it

It's not against me and you
It's just the fear in bloom
The jealousy's blood killed our lives
The lies you made will never fade
Vengeance's not a too easy word
To explain what we had or caused our death

Hit by the white zombie
Raped by the white zombie
So kill the white zombie
So kill, kill it now, and kill before it kills you
Kill it now because you couldn't hurt me more
Kill...
