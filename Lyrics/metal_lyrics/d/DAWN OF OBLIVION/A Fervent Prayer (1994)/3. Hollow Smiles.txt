Watch those faces that they brought to you
It's all the same behind their masks
Everybody has a place to go
So don't disturb my own destination

All those years I went from
Institution to institution
They'll never see me wear the mask
Never get cheated by the hollow smiles

Those familiar pictures appear in silence
With their leering eyes and their hollow smiles
I wonder what it might have been
If I just once would let them through
If I would let them through!

As I went to watch the flowers grow
The words are still ringing in my ears
"Follow the leaders, don't mind your own track"
I can't believe it, I won't do like the masses

But watch out
Beware
