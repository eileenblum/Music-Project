It's dark outside, it's dark in my mind
Where's the light I used to find
Once I was riding on the clouds
But now I'm miles from the sun
I am miles from the sun

I'm out again, I try to find the way back home again
Too many questions, but no answers
When all I want is

To be free from all the tears
I keep inside, I'm drowning in
Be free from all the pain
That tears me apart
Like an earthquake inside
Turn back now

I see a face, I see a light
I see the damage to come
What am I supposed to do
When everything
Goes round and round my head

I'm not to blame for all the fear
The dying seer
You see I have to take another way
Out of my mind
Turn back now

I don't need no sympathy
I don't need no charity
I know it's all up to me
If I will see the dawn

I'm back in time to live again
I'm back to the scene of the crime
What am I supposed to do
When everything goes round and round

Be free from all the tears
I keep inside, I'm drowning in
Be free, don't need to fly
There's no use to cry
Fight the pain
Turn back now
Turn back now
NO!!
Turn back now
Before I'm fading away
