Wake up from the past
A time to leave, to celebrate
Watch the cold blue sky
As you touched the rain
You touched your pain
What is this quiet noise
That ravage my soul
My mind is on parole
Due to circumstance
You can buy a throne
But you can't reign it alone

As we're moving forever
We are moving together
And you'll find my person is there, forever
We don't have to endeavour

Come on touch the sun
You can't embrace my heart
With that iron fist
So tell me who are you
The failures you make
Is the failures I'll take
Just put everything down
But don't expect that I'll be there
When you wake up
You build a wall full of pride
You do it your way
I'll do it my way
