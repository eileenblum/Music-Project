What is this cold dark room
Why can't they let me out
I can't see any resource
All I see is bars and bricks around my head
Do you think that they would hear my scream
Do you think they would wash my face
There's nothing special with me
There's nothing special at all

There's no use to resist
Unless you're flying high
So all I have is lust
So all I have is lust for a prayer

What's life and what's it for
Live your life you will never get more
And after this what is to come
And what is 101

I've always believed the words you said
But I was never convinced
I had to know if it was true
But now your lies bends out in my brain
I run around with screams of pain
Was it worth all the weeping sorrows
So what the hell am I crying for!!
