Listen to the sound in your head
And try to understand what it has to tell
Listen and fight for your fears
It's just another bad day as the ugly face appears

Walking all alone in the dark
The cold begins to break another statue in the park
I'm walking, I'm walking to a brighter day
'Cos I can't stand to know that it was just in vain
Mother, please listen to me now
I hope you'll understand, 'cos I am half of you
Oh mother!, where is my other half
Yes I know I wouldn't listen, I didn't want to know
I'm feeling a calling for me
But I don't know if it's a calling for help
I'm feeling the ambition to be free
Free from all the questions that's been tearing me apart

When I close my eyes
The train begins to move
When the lights go out
The smoke begins to flow over me
On me
When I close my eyes
The angel starts to call
When the lights go out
The abyss is opening wide for me
For me

Dreaming of gold and green woods
Where I can live with pleasure and enjoy the dawn
I'm dreaming of a life that I'm free
Free from all the fightings, and free from compulsion
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming
I'm dreaming to be free, I'm dreaming for me
I'm happy, I'm happy, I'm happy
I'm happy to know that this is what I want to be
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Expect me to be there, 'cos I'll be there

I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
Expect me to be there, 'cos I'll be there
Here I am alone again on second floor
With my own, my own sweet vendetta
Are you coming with me
Are you coming with me
Are you coming with me
Will you follow me...
