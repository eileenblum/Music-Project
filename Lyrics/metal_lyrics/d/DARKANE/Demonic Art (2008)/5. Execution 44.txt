Signing up to the final fate
Leaving a life once full of hope
Your trust is now in the hands of hate
Souls falling down the darkest slope

While living a secure life in peace
Trying to make the best for yourself
Pulled away from a normal existence
By those self claimed to rule

Moved, transported, deported, imprisoned
Never to return
Born in hedonistic blasphemy

Painful existence in the dark cell
No windows just a solid door
Prisoners suffocating in this hell
People laying, dying on the floor

How valuable was a life to you?
For your last mission I had to crawl

Born in unholy blasphemy
Exterminated

[Lead: MalmstrÃ¶m]

Moved, transported, deported, imprisoned
Never to return
Born in hedonistic blasphemy

Others forced to stand all night
Screaming for help not able to move
Pressed together painfully tight
So what are you trying to prove?

How valuable was a life to you?
For your last mission I had to crawl
Dragged through dust in humiliation
Shot against are in forced wall
