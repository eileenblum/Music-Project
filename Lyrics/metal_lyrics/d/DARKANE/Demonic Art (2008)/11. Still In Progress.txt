Alienating everyone that once was close
Punished wandering in no mans land
Feeling how the madness still grows
Ignorance holding stupidity's hand

While the crime is still in progress
Choirs of demons chant
All your anger is channeled in to hate
Not able to hide it in your heart

Frustration I'm no true believer
Soaking up Judas kiss
Punished the lowest deceiver
Hell would be paradise compared to this

Gaining all my forces to reach for your crown
Traveling through an endless psychotic storm
Finding you caught with your guard down
A victim out witted by the lowest form

While the crime is still in progress
Choirs of demons chant
All your anger is channeled in to hate
Not able to hide it in your heart

Believing daemons fading away
Making up for what I missed
Stolen with years I had to pay
Life's too short to walk around pissed

While the crime is still in progress
Choirs of demons chant
All your anger is channeled in to hate
Not able to hide it in your heart
