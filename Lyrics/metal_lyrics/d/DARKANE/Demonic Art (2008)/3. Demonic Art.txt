Try to find the right reason to go on pleasure or fear?
All these wounds I created will they be surpassed?
Is there a way to finish my work of art?
Will I find the pieces to accomplish my work?

When I'm prisoned there is nothing but time
Carefully plan my next exhibition of flesh
Resurrect the sadistic creature within
Rise from the ashes of humiliation

I might be limited in here
But my mind is outside
Harvesting the souls of the weak
Get rid of this human waste

I'm knowing the position where I control my own universe
Bow before me your superiority
I stand above this aboulic breed
I free them from their meaningless lives

They have to be avenged for ignoring their existence
Not having visions of their own
I'm insulted for being part of a species
That doesn't strive for its maximum capacity

I might be limited in here
But my mind is outside
Harvesting the souls of the weak
Get rid of this human waste

You seek remorse but you've encountered the wrong one
Time to fulfill this mission of demonic art

Time to fulfill this mission of demonic art
