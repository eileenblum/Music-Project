A it ravel deep down below further and further
Until reach the bottom of this endless well
Memories that never existed and words never spoken
Not recognizing what should be the essence of being

Confronting what's not supposed to surface
Nowhere to reside but the outer borders of this lost mind
Responsible for things that was not meant to be
Knowing that the material world is nothing but a charade

On broken wings I travel
Searching resistance
A fragile trip to the unknown
Leaving existence

In a split second the so-called life changes dramatically
A wrong turn straight to the deepest pits of hell
Buried in a fragile shelter soon to fall apart
How easy to forget where the limits form compassion are

Travel somewhere else and maybe just maybe
There is guidance for a soul set to break apart?
A life depraved the ultimate sacrifice
A price higher than life itself

On broken wings I travel
Searching resistance
A fragile trip to the unknown
Leaving existence

[Lead: MalmstrÃ¶m]

Lost in a delusive world
This is where it all ends

[Lead: Ideberg]

Confronting what's not supposed to surface
Nowhere to reside but the outer borders of this lost mind
Responsible for things that was not meant to be
Knowing that the material world is nothing but a charade

On broken wings I travel
Searching resistance
A fragile trip to the unknown
Leaving existence
