Far beyond the silent down
Come join me above the sky
Where no one ever forced to mourn
Bring on the wonder never die

There is nothing we'll ever regret
Using the sense of a blind
This has to be our secret
Be surprised of what you'll find
A perspective indulgence we'll bear
Weakened by its strange ling rope
Floating through a spiral of dreams
Incarnating mankind's last hope

Emotions are unnecessary
Just let your inner forces win

Impure
Is this the cure?
Only imaginary shells
Hear what the infinite tells

Prepare your self for the last move
Your past forever concealed
Inhale the future unlock improve
Let all tour senses be healed
So there is nothing we'll ever regret
Using the sense of a blind
This has to be our secret
Be surprised of what you'll find

Emotions are unnecessary
Just let your inner forces win

Impure
Is this the cure?
Only imaginary shells
Hear what the infinite tells

Far beyond the silent dawn
Come join me above the sky
Where no one's ever forced to mourn
Bring on the wonder
A perspective indulgence we'll bear
Weakened by it's strange ling rope
Floating through a spiral of dreams
Incarnating our last hope

Gaining from occult powers
Counting the hours

Impure
Is this the cure?
Only imaginary shells
Hear what the infinite tells
