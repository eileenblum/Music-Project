How I fear what lies beyond
Slowly draining inside
Waiting for a change to come
Indulge the life of others

Personal pleasure distinguished euphoria
Digest my soul to nothing conclusion zero
Turn to the depths inside horrid waste
At this bottomless pit

Confined within this mental cage
Is this the end?
Is this the last human resort?
Walk the distance leaving no prints

The killing of I
Gone with the blink of an eye
The killing of eye
The soul is set to tie

Craving the unreachable
Wanting the impossible
In the depths a growing conflict
Nowhere to run

Bleak mere shadows of what once was
Put asleep since nothing more to gain
Yearn for what's not there no light at the end
Leave the path of prediction

A battle that can't be won
Heat waves reaching the boiling point
My life is torn to pieces
Scattered by the wind

The killing of I
Gone with the blink of an eye
The killing of eye
The soul is set to tie

No actual sorrow
Just the hollow emptiness
A painful trip to insanity
Wanting to be reborn

The killing of I
Gone with the blink of an eye
The killing of eye
The soul is set to tie
