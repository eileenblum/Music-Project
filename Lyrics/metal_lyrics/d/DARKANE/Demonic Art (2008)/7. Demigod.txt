From heaven we wandered the earth
Our spirits blinded man
While we spread our seed
Dreams were shattered
Lies were thorn in our way
Our off spring lived on dead souls
While we gave our way to his will
Hatred manifested itself
Beyond every known boundary

Bounded by blood
For a false god
For an evil god

The demigod reborn in flesh
We failed his divine test
The punishment was blessed

Formed by fire
Encompassed by light
Sadistic tendencies awoke
He split our unity
Sided with the dark
In our veins floated wrath
We his first creation
Will never bow to man
To crush the tyrant
To rise over the clouds
To conquer the weak man

The demigod reborn in flesh
We failed his divine test
The punishment was blessed

[Lead: MalmstrÃ¶m]

From dark caves
Chained to the wall
Our minds twisted apart
Searching for a way to die
Immortality such a bleak escape

The demigod reborn in flesh
We failed his divine test
The punishment was blessed
Was blessed...

The demigod reborn in flesh
We failed his divine test
The punishment was blessed
Was blessed...
