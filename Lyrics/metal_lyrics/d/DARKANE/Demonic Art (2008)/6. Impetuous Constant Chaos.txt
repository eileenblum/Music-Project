The goal is to alter the human
Give guidance to be reborn
Follow the path to the other side
Fresh and free from remorse
Stuck in this blank phase
The common factor for an extinct breed
Limitations imposed on the emotionless
Greet accident expand the thrill of life

Twist the arm of a soul-drained body
Guided by an impetuous constant chaos

Let desire flow freely get rid of control
Deplorable because nothing is attached to life
Detach oneself from oneself to become  anti-addicted
Liberate personality from this controlled state

Twist the arm of a soul-drained body
Guided by an impetuous constant chaos

Lust fear hate disgust
Guilt rage pride all a must

[Lead: Ideberg]

When truth surface there's nothing to turn to
Dig into the unexplored facets of yourself
Unleash the multiplicity of you needs

Always strive for more indulge your very need
Lack of imagination an obstacle to one's advancement
Don't convey a predestined concept of life
A mental trap that leads to vanity

Twist the arm of a soul-drained body
Guided by an impetuous constant chaos
