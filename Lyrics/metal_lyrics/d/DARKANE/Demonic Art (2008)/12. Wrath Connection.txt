It's not the new beginning
I am still here haunting dread
Looking to the mirror
Realize the forces of the living dead

Once human now in between
Darkness void re-created hell
Floating in a state never before seen
Trapped within a mental shell

Reigning my world of fantasies
Dwelling beyond a landscape of dreams
A lonely demon an ice cold wrath
So if I am not the victim in here
Then why is my heart like an open sore?

Once human now in between
Darkness void re-created hell
Floating in a state never before seen
Trapped within a mental shell

I'm sucking up your sorrow
Eating from your worst fear
I'm feeding from your anxiety
Giving a toast with every tear
Judging me by my outer shell
But who knows what lays within
Dare to ring the doomsday bell
Forever sleep in eternal sin

[Lead: MalmstrÃ¶m]

Your vision is my dark deed
A connection between me and you
Watch me fulfilling my filthy greed
And there's nothing you can do

Once human now in between
Darkness void re-created hell
Floating in a state never before seen
Trapped within a mental shell
