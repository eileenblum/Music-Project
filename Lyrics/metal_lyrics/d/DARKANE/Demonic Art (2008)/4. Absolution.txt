I duplicate my sanity
A distance from an outside world
I know there's no remission for my sins
Cause I feed on filth
The trinity of inner turmoil
Neatly pinned on my wall
I will set the tone my will is a hoard

In a parallel universe
It all seemed so clear to me
Inner absolution
It's enough, enough for me

You separated my heresy
Sodomy the cult of clergy
I feel there's no redemption for disgrace
And I kneel in vain
Nakedness of ill-fated belief
Wearing only my sin
I will wear your crown

In a parallel universe
It all seemed so clear to me
Digital illusions
It's enough, enough for me

In a parallel universe
It all seemed so clear to me
Inner absolution
It's enough, enough for me

[Lead: MalmstrÃ¶m]

Edicts of grace you will confess
What I ask of you is to repent
Heretical blasphemy
Will gain you only pain

I duplicate my sanity
A distance from an outside world
I know there's no remission for my sins
Cause I feed on filth
The trinity of inner turmoil
Neatly pinned on my wall
I will set the tone my will is a whore

In a parallel universe
It all seemed so clear to me
Digital illusions
It's enough, enough for me

In a parallel universe
It all seemed so clear to me
Inner absolution
It's enough, enough for me
