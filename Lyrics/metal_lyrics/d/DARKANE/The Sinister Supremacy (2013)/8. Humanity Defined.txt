[Music: MalmstrÃ¶m, Mackrory, lyrics: MalmstrÃ¶m]

Blinding your vision, reality shut off
I control what has always been mine
Self-contained and contradictory
Unaware of when I'm crossing the line

The world begins and ends with me
I'm the center of what's known
Prevent the ability to see
Trapped in manipulation zone
Creating chaos and disorder in your mind
I have no interest in what's your destiny
See me complete and divine

Logic discarded, reasoning fails
No interest if you want to run or stay
I'll make you believe that you have a choice
As long as we do it my own way

The world begins and ends with me
I'm the center of what's known
Prevent the ability to see
Trapped in manipulation zone
Creating chaos and disorder in your mind
I have no interest in what's your destiny
See me complete and divine

Blocking your vision
Turning blind
The universe is in me
I'm humanity defined

Deny the truth, the evil within
All too late, you'll be aware of the signs
Knowing your guilt while I'm free from sin
Unaware of when I've crossed the line

The world begins and ends with me
I'm the center of what's known
Prevent the ability to see
Trapped in manipulation zone
Creating chaos and disorder in your mind
I have no interest in what's your destiny
See me complete and divine

Blocking your vision
Turning blind
The universe is in me
I'm humanity defined
