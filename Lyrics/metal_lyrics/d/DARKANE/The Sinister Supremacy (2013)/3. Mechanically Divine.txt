Limbs failing to comply with impulses from my brain
Physical limitations are proven too great to be accepted
Structural failure, a product of poor carnal design
Unsatisfactory bodily architecture

A severance of carnal bond
Mechanically divine

When the act transcends human bounds
I can always accept the pain

Forced to live in this pod of moldering flesh
Left to die in this shell in which we are born
Redefining the concept of mankind
Perpetual

Corporal deconstruction
Mechanical fabrication

A need to improve on this frail human pattern
Researching ways to amend the flaws of creation
Ameliorate this weak, substandard anatomy
Reinforce the frame and substitute piece by piece

I will surpass both flesh and blood
Bionically supreme

When the act transcends human bounds
I can always accept the pain

Forced to live in this pod of moldering flesh
Left to die in this shell in which we are born
I'm becoming mechanically divine
Perpetual
