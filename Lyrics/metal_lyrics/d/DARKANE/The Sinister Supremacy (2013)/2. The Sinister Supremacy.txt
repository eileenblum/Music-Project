[Music: MalmstrÃ¶m, Mackrory, lyrics: Mackrory]

Violence is all I can see
When I close my eyes it takes control over me
The nightmare has me confined
The only relief is to succumb to my mind

There must be a purpose of this hell
This covert assailant that guides me I cannot repel

I feed on your fear
As you see the end coming near
And all senses disappear

Murder is all that I crave
Feeling no remorse for those I sent to the grave
My bloodlust will be your demise
This power compels me to bring death in disguise

I am enslaved by this mastery
No way to control this malevolent conspiracy

I feed on your fear
As you see the end coming near
And all senses disappear
You'll be set free

This monstrosity
The sinister supremacy
Will it be my legacy?

In blood red ecstasy
Devoured by lunacy
This malicious demonocracy
Death resides in me

Vengeance is what I seek
I am the aggressor now and you are the weak
Relentless sealer of fates
This pitch-black misery is all that awaits

There must be a purpose of this hell
This covert assailant that guides me I cannot repel

I feed on your fear
As you see the end coming near
And all senses disappear
You'll be set free

This monstrosity
The sinister supremacy
Will it be my legacy?

Will it be my legacy?
