[Music: MalmstrÃ¶m, Wildoer, Mackrory, lyrics: Mackrory]

I wage a war against society
My tired eyes have finally seen enough
We once stood united sworn to uphold
The structures set forth
Witness the collapse
The inevitable end to our way of life
The oncoming darkness
Has emerged to swallow us whole

Under control
We will govern your worthless soul
Stand in line and wait your order
Under control
There's no other to save your soul
Controlled by fear

Retaliate this virulent regime
Initiate the protocol
Take it back and let this surge or rage endure
Break the silence
Insurrection is imminent

The harder you fall the higher you bounce
We have strength in numbers
Our voices cannot be suppressed
Denounce possession
We all own the ground that we walk
When the dust settles
And all the blood's been washed away
Ascendancy will be obsolete
It cannot wait

I stand my ground against society
My battered fists have finally strengthened
We fight united to overthrow this despotism
Behold the arise
The few have spoken
We've awoken
The uprising has begun
Stand up and be counted

Retaliate this virulent regime
Initiate the protocol
Take it back and let this surge or rage endure
Break the silence
Insurrection is imminent
