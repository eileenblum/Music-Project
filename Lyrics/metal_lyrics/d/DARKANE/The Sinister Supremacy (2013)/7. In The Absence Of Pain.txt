[Music: Wildoer, MalmstrÃ¶m, Mackrory, lyrics: MalmstrÃ¶m, Mackrory]

Filtered through the nervous system
Your body does not respond
Failing neural connections
Communications with the outside world

Living in the absence of pain
Never feeling a thing
No way to sense injuries sustained
Trapped within this shell
Shattered mind, soul in vain
A future so bleak
Broken bones, lethal wounds
Senses docile and meek

Waiting for sensations to appear
How long can the body persevere
One by one, functions letting go
What it feels like to die
I will never know

Never felt what others take for granted
Nothing signals what's wrong
Brutally harming your body
The severity will never be known

Living in the absence of pain
Never feeling a thing
No way to sense injuries sustained
Trapped within this shell
Shattered mind, soul in vain
A future so bleak
Broken bones, lethal wounds
Senses docile and meek

In the absence of pain
Living life in vain
Sensations bound to be restrained

Waiting for sensations to appear
How long can the body persevere
One by one, functions letting go
What it feels like to die
I will never know
