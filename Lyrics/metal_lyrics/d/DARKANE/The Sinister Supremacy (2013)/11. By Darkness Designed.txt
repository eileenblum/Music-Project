[Music: Ideberd, Mackrory, lyrics: Mackrory]

I treat the world as I know it to be
Morally dead and decadent
I conquer life as I see fit
Unparalleled

I have defied every rule of man
Just to be the anomaly
A sadistic abomination
Incomparable

I will not go down
I will never wear your crown
Will not conform to your ways
In this heart malign
There's a darkness so divine
I'm on the shore as you drown

See me coming alive
This is the era in which I will thrive

I stand aside and enjoy the collapse
Drive a wedge in the crack
I have transcended life and death
To reign in chaos

In this heart malign
There's a darkness so divine
I'm on the shore as you drown

See me coming alive
This is the era in which I will thrive
Detached from this theater of the confined
Grand, superior, by darkness designed

Born from a malignant strain
Designed to inflict pain
In chaos I reign

I will not go down
I will never wear your crown
Will not conform to your ways
In this heart malign
There's a darkness so divine
I'm on the shore as you drown

See me coming alive
This is the era in which I will thrive
Detached from this theater of the confined
Grand, superior, by darkness designed
