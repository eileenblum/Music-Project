[Music: Ideberg, Mackrory, MalmstrÃ¶m, lyrics: Mackrory]

Here we stand with all hope gone
Tainted by the death we've seen
Pushing onward on barren land
Feeding on the will to live

Left with all the pain,
The fear and denial
With open arms we fall

When the shadows descend on our souls
And the end is so near
When the smell of defeat is in the air
We embrace our fate

With no life left to give
We survive into defeat

Despair, dispirited
Bereaved and without hope
Frantic, ravenous
At the end of my rope

We succumb to the dark
Where all life goes to cease

When the shadows descend on our souls
And the end is so near
When the smell of defeat is in the air
We embrace our fate

When the darkness devours our minds
The solution's so clear
And we all stand aside
To watch it die
When it all fades away
