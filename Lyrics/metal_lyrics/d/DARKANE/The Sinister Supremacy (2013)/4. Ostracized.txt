[Music: Ideberg, Mackrory, lyrics: Mackrory]

A brush with death and it's painfully clear
Who am I and what I'm doing here?
I've sacrificed and bled my heart out but for what?
What is it really worth?

Contemplating whether to leave this earth
The hours passing by but time stands still
Scourged there is no longer comfort in mindless violent acts

The hours pass but time stands still

Hate and rage fills the void
Banished from life
Pain and fear haunts the soul
Ostracized

I conquered all that I possibly could
I summoned all the strength I could find
If there's a place for those depraved
By all means send me on my way

An eternity of kindness and grace
Will never be enough to save my soul
Bound to an existence in agony for all eternity

It's not enough to save my soul

Hate and rage fills the void
Banished from life
Pain and fear haunts the soul
Ostracized

But there is no place in this world
For this depraved and decadent monument of humanity

Scourged
This is no way to live
Is it enough to die for?
The sands of time are sinking further
Bound by this burden of life
Death, the final endowment
We're all born just to die

The sands of time are sinking further
We're all just born to die
