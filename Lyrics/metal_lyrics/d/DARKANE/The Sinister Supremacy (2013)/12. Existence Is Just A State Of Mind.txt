[Music: Ideberd, Mackrory, lyrics: Mackrory]

Lost and forgotten
Emotions collide in
Empty battlefields
Denounced and rejected
Slowly fading away and into nothingness

Suddenly a sense reminds us
There's nothing to take for granted
It surrounds us all
In a second all might fall
Existence is just a state of mind

Down and discarded
The lies construct a new reality
Complete isolation
Only self-abducting joy that might have been

Suddenly a sense reminds us
There's nothing to take for granted
It surrounds us all
In a second all might fall
Existence is just a state of mind

Rise up, reinstate
Stage your own escape
Dismantle asperity
Design your destiny

Suddenly a sense reminds us
There's nothing to take for granted
It surrounds us all
In a second all might fall
Existence is just a state of mind

Suddenly the void collapses
Washed away like time forgotten
It surrounds us all
In a second all might fall
Existence is just a state of mind
