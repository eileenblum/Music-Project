[Music: Ideberd, Mackrory, lyrics: Wildoer]

A dark, bottomless well of grief
Travelling into the heart of sorrow
There is nothing more to see within
Only horrors interlaced in patterns of pain
Feed the ghost with depravity
Reach the final decadence
An intense stretch of awareness
The panic enfolds the present

The demons from deep within
Seducing the soul into sin
Searching for lost conclusions
The collapse of illusions

Concealing the infinite expanse of unbounded intellect
The agitation discomposes the inside
Shattering the individual boundaries
The self profoundly altered
Transformed into contingency
The dissolution of true belief
Redefining reality

The demons from deep within
Seducing the soul into sin
Searching for lost conclusions
The collapse of illusions

Obscuring impurity
Illuminate deception

The demons from deep within
Seducing the soul into sin
Searching for lost conclusions
The collapse of illusions
