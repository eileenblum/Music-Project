Condemned to spend my life in darkness
Being punished beyond all sanity
Forever paying harmless sins
Bleak surroundings breaking my soul
Grotesque
Anger
Is killing
My
Passion for life
Going insane
No more dreams
Free me from pain
Convicted
Now here to hide my horrid feelings
Isolated, in this dreadful hell
Possessed by human life outside
Doomed and banished from reality
Grotesque
Anger
Is killing
My
Passion for life
Going insane
No more dreams
Free me from pain
Convicted
Lead: Malmstrom
The final torment takes away the fear
No more suffering, now the end is near
Escape obscurity, make the sacrifice
Had to pay the inevitable price
Grotesque
Anger
Is killing
My
Passion for life
Going insane
No more dreams
Free me from pain
Convicted
