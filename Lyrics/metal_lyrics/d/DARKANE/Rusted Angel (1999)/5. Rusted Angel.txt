Assembled from bits of other creatures
Created not born
Not having to age beyond recognition
I have no soul
Arrogance and ignorance
A useful tool to destroy those with faith
I despise everything. And will annihilate you all
Crucify and justify. The ones who won't follow
In your eyes I see your demise
I am the superior sovereign. Creator of pain
Dressed in sin. Filled with wrath
Vengeful is my vein
Floods of hate boiling distress
Follow the journey to my dark side
See the human remains cover the ground
I feel no guilt for this genocide
Praising true evil with blooded thoughts
Swearing faithfulness to the dishonest
Nourish my lust for immolation
I represent your devastation

Assembled from bits of creatures
Created not born
Not having to age beyond recognition
I have no soul
In this chaos no one is free to do what he pleases
Watching the sky above. But praying to those below
Hunting for my daily rage. See the rising slavement
Using lies to fulfill my dreams
I am the superior sovereign. Creator of pain
Dressed in sin. Filled with wrath
Vengeful is my vein
Floods of hate boiling distress
Follow the journey to my dark side
See the human remains cover the ground
I feel no guilt for this genocide
Praising true evil with blooded thoughts
Swearing faithfulness to the dishonest
Nourish my lust for immolation I represent your devastation
I am the superior sovereign. Creator of pain
Dressed in sin. Filled with wrath
Vengeful is my vein
No compassion for the mortal
