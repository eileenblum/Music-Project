Long before man ever existed
We had to dwell in the void between spaces
Being prisoned now and for evermore
An utterly inhuman punishment
Having to wonder in nothingness
Is both a curse and a blessing
Stare into the untold eternity
Like oceans beyond the horizon
I'm your thoughts
Your despair
In control
Of your mind
Centuries ago we took our revenge
Showed you our true faces
Tempted to be released
Possess your darkest dominions
Manipulate you from inside
While you still have a soul
Feed on the spark of life
Obliterate the human existence
Listen to the screams of agony
Knowing that the pain won't cease
No control of your horrid acts
Spreading affliction, not knowing why
There is now way to fulfill
The hollow hope of promises
Wherever you will run
I will always be there
Bound by them which I bind
Need for the fragile human life

[1st lead: Ideberg]
[2nd lead: Malmstrom]

I'm your thoughts
Your despair
In control
Of your mind
Unable to ease the suffering
Living this tormented life
No remorse for infliction
Driven by an endless malevolence
The feeling of being dead inside
So exquistely desolate
I am now and forever
I will exist beyond your oblivion
Bound by them which I bind
Need for the fragile human life
