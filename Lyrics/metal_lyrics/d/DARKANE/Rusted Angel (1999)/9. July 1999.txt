This man was no deceiver
This man was never wrong
You must beware, believer
This prophecy is strong
The prophet has predicted
Four hundred years ago
The King of fear decided
The north of earth must go
Holocaust
See it coming
You can't escape
All are bound to be destroyed
A bloody man in under
Who stands upon his head
he saw this yearly number
and upside down he read
Six six six and one
The prophet has predicted
Four hundred years ago
The King of fear decided
The north of earth must go
Holocaust
See it coming
You can't escape
All are bound to be destroyed
In nine teen ninety nine
Is the point of time
The month is July
When millions will die
By the devil from the sky

[Lead: Malmstrom]

The prophet has predicted
Four hundred years ago
The King of fear decided
The north of earth must go
Holocaust
See it coming
You can't escape
All are bound to be destroyed
Nostradamus predicted fear...
