No truth will ever set you free
Or help to expose this conspiracy
Always being watched
Every move documented
No more freedom
Oppress the masses
The distress of
Knowing their total control
Not being able
To convince others
Try to spread the word
About society breaking
Those who have
Built what we think is ours
Lead: Ideberg
They feed from fear
The have no limits
As they feel the urge to 
Violate, The
Rape of Mankind
They try to
Silence what is good for man
But fatal
To those with power
Just standing by
Watching this secret show
So secret that
No one knows it exists
The truth is no more
Did never really exist
Deep down inside
We know that we will never face the perfect world
No truth will ever set you free
Or help to expose this conspiracy

[Lead: Malmstrom]
