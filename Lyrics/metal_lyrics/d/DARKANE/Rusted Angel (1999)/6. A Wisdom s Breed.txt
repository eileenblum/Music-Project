As we walk through the valley of transparent souls
We have to find the knowledge of sin
So we will fear the light as the darkness
Hate lies beyond the fall of any angels
Search the lies
In the insane sanity
And try to invent hope for
Those who have denied
Never seen
Never touched the wisdom of pure pain
Look into the anguish of faith
And see the helpless face of reality
Take a look and see the time forever
Through endless sorrow we have to wander
Drift around in a chaos of regret
We're being slain in the true circles of hell
Search the lies
In the insane sanity
And try to invent hope for
Those who have denied
Never seen
Never touched the wisdom of pure pain
Don't compare your souls to mine
Use your dark powers from deep inside

[1st lead: Ideberg]
[2nd lead: Malmstrom]

Let the hate guide our minds to total control
A world full of souls
That have failed to complete their dreams
Anxiety, the breeding of deranged erudition
Search the lies
In the insane sanity
And try to invent hope for
Those who have denied
Never seen
Never touched the wisdom of pure pain
The eternal battle between good and evil
Saint and sinner
