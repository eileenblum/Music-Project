[Lead: Ideberg]

The beauty of your escaping soul
Behold my true distress
Your naked mind is barely existing
I have dreams you could never imagine
Explore your forbidden defiance
See the realm of temptation
Knowing anger
Will betray me
Disconnected
From all feelings
The chase for my existence
Centuries has passed me by
Suffering has now a face
It'll free me from my future
You have your whole life behind you now
Depravity, is what you'll find
I am blind to the darkness in myself
No longer able to control my urges
You have to accept your destiny
Feel the lack of compassion
Knowing anger
Will betray me
Disconnected
From all feelings

Centuries has passed me by
Suffering has now a face
It'll free me from my future
