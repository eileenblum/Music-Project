Emotions crucified from the beginning of time
Condemned, not knowing what's my crime
The dreams that ever grew in my mind
Has risen to hatred beyond mankind
Obsessed thoughts are choking me
No one else will ever see
So alone, so cut off, so lost
Have to be free, whatever it will cost
I'm falling below mental darkness
The demons taking control over my head
Won't ever leave me until I'm dead
Insanity eating me from inside
Nowhere to go, now here to hide
I'm forced to give vent to the rage
That has grown in me since early age

[Lead: Malmstrom]

Blinded by obstructed imagination
My conscious is reaching the twilight
Erasing the difference between wrong and right
You don't see what I see
Frenetic visions that will never set me free
My world will never be like yours
Greedy lust took me off the course
Trapped in a sadistic desire
That burns my mind like fire
Frustrated by darkness devouring my past
Only the terrifying memories will last
I'm falling below mental darkness
The demons taking control over my head
Won't ever leave me until I'm dead
Insanity eating me from inside
Nowhere to go, now here to hide
If you could hear what I hear
You would join me in this world of fear
Haunted by pleasured and furious screams
Not knowing if it's reality or dreams
