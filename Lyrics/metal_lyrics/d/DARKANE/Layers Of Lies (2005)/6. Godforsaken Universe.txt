Look into my eyes and get a glimpse of annihilation
Seek deep within me, but you will find no pity
You have entered my dominion. Nobody belongs here but me
Once you're here the portal behind you is closed
I'll guide you to agony
I'll make you detest
I'll bring you depravity
This is my quest
No one survives a visit in my hell
Sit back and enjoy your own demise
Feel free to explore, but you will find only wrath
You will dwell in torment and affliction for eternity
I control this godforsaken universe
A passionate sensation, being superior to God
Vanished, nothing left
Perished, no one survive
Do you share my passion for death?
I will serve you a dinner of vengeance
I'll guide you to agony
I'll make you detest
I'll bring you depravity
This is my quest
As your soul is torn with surgical precision
And the void that is left is filled with darkened oblivion
Left is an empty shell, erased egraded
An inexplicable fear of what dread waits
Vanished, nothing left
Perished, no one survive
