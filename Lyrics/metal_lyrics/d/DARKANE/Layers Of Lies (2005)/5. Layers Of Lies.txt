A dull perception of an ever-shrinking world
The desire to live outside the given sphere
Set aside the free will and human emotion
How it hurts to know that freedom is gone forever
Lies, layers of lies, layers of lies
Piece of a puzzle, a pawn in a game
Lies, layers of lies, laers of lies
That never will be solved
Thick layers of lies
Is there a choice, or is it in the hands of destiny
No such things as faith, everything is predestined
The presence of all, and the perception of every feeling
Is just a dream that follows a written script
Lies, layers of lies, layers of lies
Piece of a puzzle, a pawn in a game
Lies, layers of lies, laers of lies
That never will be solved
Thick layers of lies
Use the flesh to breed artficial machinery
Bend the time, the past ahead of us
A well kept secret revealed in an instance
Cut through the thick layers of lies
A piece of a puzzle, a pawn in a game
A piece of a puzzle, Cut through the thick layers of
Lies, layers of lies, layers of lies
Piece of a puzzle, a pawn in a game
Lies, layers of lies, laers of lies
That never will be solved
Thick layers of lies
