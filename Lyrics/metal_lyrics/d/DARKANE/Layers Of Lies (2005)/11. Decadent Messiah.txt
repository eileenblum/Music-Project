Castaways on anguish island
Haunted by a thousand ghosts
Tortured to complete denial
Threatened by the truth
Propagate in bitter anger
Multiply in clone like twins
Serve, obey, believe
Kneel down
Bow before his feet
The master of deceit
Bloodstained, raging liar
Rule with death and fire
Decadent Messiah
Throw yourself into darkness
God invented you to be
The saviour of mankind
Dive into the well of hatred
Turn away all sense of guilt
Drive yourself through fire and pain

[Lead: MalmstrÃ¶m]

Have no fear, have no thought
The less you know the more you gain
Ignorance complete the madness
Pledge allegiance to the flame
In sickness and in death
'Till Hell do you part.
