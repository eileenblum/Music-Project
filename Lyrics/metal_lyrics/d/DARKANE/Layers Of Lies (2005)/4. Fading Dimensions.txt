Captured in this domain of flesh and blood
An implant of illusions before closed eyes
Forced into the moving shadows
Reality challenges the most vivid imagination
The mind needs to discover for itself
Awake from this dream, living a nightmare
Controlled imagination
Washed away in the waves of insanity
The face of reality is twisted without a form
Placed in this given, yet unwanted madness
Pushing all rational thoughts aside
Reopen the closed doors to infinity
Walking this delusive path
Fantasies more true than life itself
Controlled imagination
Washed away in the waves of insanity
A growing equation of fading dimensions
Thirst exceeding the oceans

[1st lead: Ideberg]

[2nd lead: MalmstrÃ¶m]

All access to devoted lust
Are only visions of passionate flesh
Forced into the moving shadows
Reality challenges the most vivid imagination
The mind needs to discover for itself
Awake from this dream, living a nightmare
Controlled imagination
Washed away in the waves of insanity
A growing equation of fading dimensions
Thirst exceeding the oceans
