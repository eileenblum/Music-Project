Addicted to fleash, in pieces in parts
Embracing sense of control
The smell of the pure, untainted untouched
Reaveals as the beauty unfolds

Intoxicating, innocence impelling me
Invoke the creature, imperious the beast

Tormented by pleasure, my fantasies roam
Imprisoning visions untamed
Drowning in anguish, feel no remorse
Feeding the lies to the flame

Strapped down, pinned down, punished by my mortal mind
Sucked dry, drained out, all essence of my soul

Craving, needing, feeding fear...
Frustration, desperation, devastation
Penetration, escalation, emanation of fear

Caught in a sling, hung by a noose
Can't reach to cut the rope
Betrayed, deceived, don't trust a soul, not even your own

Intoxicating, innocence impelling me
Invoke the creature, imperious the beast

Craving, needing, feeding fear...

Sucked dry, drained out, all essence of my soul

Craving, needing, feeding fear...
