Vanishing weak flesh, dissolving in pain
Trapped together with torture in this body domain
The air is growing thicker with frost
Yet so warm, though my senses are lost

Traced and innocently condemned, brutal forces judging my blood
The silence of seductive chaos shatters my logical structure
The upper world beyond this death
Grows with the power of the soul
That have been violently consumed - I've made my contribution

The toxic power attach my soul
Disorders my nervous system
The primitive side of my brain is splattered through pyschic pain

Inner chaos - Shattered structure

[Lead: Fredrik Thordendal]

Dimensions in a forgotten existence
Explosive nothing, burning insanity
I'm feeling the lights from cosmic structures
Exploring the untold lies of madness
Invisible state of extatic coma embraces the outer septic world
Of devastating holocausts in me, a bleeding hell of obscure void

A blood stained pathetic slave
Impured desire, longing for my grave
Vanishing weak flesh, dissolving in pain
Trapped together with torture in this body domain

Inner chaos - shattered structure
