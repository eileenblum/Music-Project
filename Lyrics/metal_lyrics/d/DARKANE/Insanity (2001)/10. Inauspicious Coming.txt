[Lead: Malmstrom]

Growing - Evil Faith is leading us
Control - Lost in propagation

Realms of chaos - sterile wasteland
Twisted humans - lost their value
Drowning in a - wave of sorrow
Perished by the - evil desire

Realizing death, divination of raising hell
Impure world betrayed, raped, destroyed

Degenerated breed, reprobate genetic failure
Incinerating hope of generations to come
Harvesting the unfertile seed, destruction isn't what we need
See the inauspicious coming, fear the infernal chaos rise

Oppressed by the urge to reign
Wheels of bones on a road of flesh

[Lead: Malmstrom]

Increase - Devastating space reduced
Fatal - Doomsbells screaming no response

Realms of chaos - sterile wasteland
Twisted humans - lost their value
Drowning in a - wave of sorrow
Perished by the - evil desire

Realizing death, the progress irresponsible
Impure world betrayed, the final dawn closing in

Degenerated breed...

Oppressed by the urge to reign
Wheels of bones on a road of flesh
