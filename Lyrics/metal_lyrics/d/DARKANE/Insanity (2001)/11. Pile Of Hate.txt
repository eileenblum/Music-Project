Deep down in the unfathomed hollow pits of disbelief
These bottomless viods of despair and anguish
Countless masses dwell in misconduct
Bonded ny chains built by our own urge to devastate

Enter the abandoned desert
A world built here for our blind eyes
Based on lies of dark disbelief
Grown to obey under ignorence

As they feed on the
Remains of our pathetic lives
Evil minds molten
Together in a pile of hate
That gives birth
To infinite malice
Used to reap the harvest
Of the least resistant

I am worshipped by your Gods
And chased by your demons
I am worshipped by your Gods
And chased by your demons

Enter the abandoned desert
A world built here for our blind eyes
Based on lies of dark disbelief
Grown to obey under ignorence

Millions of souls unknowing that their
Destiny is to give nourishment to
Their own Holocaust

[1st lead: Malmstrom]
[2nd lead: Ideberg]

Forced to spend their precious
Lives in a savage existence

The evolution has stopped because
Our instincts were programmed to
Selfextermination

Locked up because they have to
Believe they are superior
Freedom broken down to
Fragments of lost dreams
in this dominian all illusions are lost
Faith is a word that
Has lost its meaning

I am worshipped by your Gods
And chased by your demons
I am worshipped by your Gods
And chased by your demons

Enter the abandoned desert
A world built here for our blind eyes
Based on lies of dark disbelief
Grown to obey under ignorence

The evolution has stopped because
Our instincts were programmed to
Selfextermination
