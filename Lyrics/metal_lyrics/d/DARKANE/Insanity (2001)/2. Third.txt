Reality breaks into your mind
A flash of light cuts through the head
You search for clarity, cannot find
Your mind is dull, your eyes are blind
Scream for help but no one hear
A dark tornado, Distorting ear
Try to escape as you turn around
Nailed by fear down to the ground

Floating

Slowly reaching consiousness
A feeling overwhelming in distress
The focus slowing returns from dead
Realizing creatures face above your head
Evil expressions facing through
Internal experiments based on you
Paralyzed by cosmic horror insane
Surrealistic screams of panic, of pain

Floating through inverted spheres

[Lead: Malmstrom]

Floating through inverted spheres

The world of hysteric silence
Expanding by abusive violence
Growing red in organic disorder
Apathetic attempts to reach the border
That will free you from this insanity
A shapeless dimension of humanity
Paralyzed by cosmic horror insane
Surrealistic screams of panic, of pain
