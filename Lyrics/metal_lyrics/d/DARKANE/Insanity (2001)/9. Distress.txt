Arising wrath in a penurious existence
Hunting a being of my own
Treading on disconsolate faces
Desperately climbing for the throne
Denying the gift of humanity
Like a stillborn walking the earth
I'm reaching nirvana of insanity
Praising indolence, banning birth

Craving for distressing acts
My impulse for violent art
Forces me to inevitable impacts
Is tearing your destiny apart
A brutal reality destroying all life
This terror will always reign
Constantly frustrating society, in my world I'm the master brain

Join my morbid parade - A horrid masquerade

My dark blood is screaming from the past, the spirits of a lost generation
The howling voices will always last, will lead me to my own devastation
If I had chosen the other path, If I had to make myself clear

Join my morbid parade - A horrid masquerade

[1st lead: Ideberg  2nd lead: Malmstrom]

Arising wrath in a penurious existence, hunting a being of my own
Treading on disconsolate faces, desperately climbing for the throne,
Denying the gift of humanity Like a stillborn walking the earth, I'm 
reaching nirvana of insanity, praising indolence, banning birth
