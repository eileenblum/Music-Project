No boundaries of what you've been through
Abused, molested
The pain you suffered from meaningless lunacy
Raped, penetrated, lunacy
Once innocent, now that is gone
Tro to build your life from constant lies
Despise the one who bore you
Hate the one that made you
There's no one to confine to

The hate you feel inside
Rots away with the soul that died
Innocence is gone
Only limbs

Try to conquer your pain
Never daring to say no
For the fright of more pain to come
You let the act pass by
To be brutalized in the worst possible way

The hate you feel inside
Rots away with the soul that died
Innocence is gone
Only limbs

Shattered body and soul
Shattered body and soul
The plague will not withdraw
The hate you feel inside

[lead: Malmstrom]

The plague will come to haunt you down
Grind you down to nothing
The black light you see is all that you feel
Darkness, numbness fills the soul

The hate you feel inside - The hate you feel inside -
The hate you feel inside - The hate you feel inside

The hate you feel inside
Rots away with the soul that died
Innocence is gone
Only limbs exist in fearful hate
The hate you feel inside
Rots away with the soul that died
Innocence is gone
Only limbs
