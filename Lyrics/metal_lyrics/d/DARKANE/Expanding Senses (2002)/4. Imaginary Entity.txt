Twisted forms implanted in y mind
Choked by the fear of the unknown
The virtual being exists
Anguish rising inside, abnormal behaviour
Show no feelings, nor good nor evil
The apathy of a depressed human sense
Deep in this black soul lies the final horror
Take a step into your personal hell

Try to identify the unrecognisable vague shadows
Elaborate fantasies or definite reality

Denial, the best way to protect a weak mind
The state of protection evolve into possession

Have to have some kind of belief or psychosis is near
Unable to separate impressions, paranoia sets in
Amnesia the utter protection towards
A world full of illusions
Compassion is someting I never felt
Psychotic features a major depression

Life will now fade
A state of void
Haunts my soul
Life will now fade
It haunts my soul
Haunts my soul
