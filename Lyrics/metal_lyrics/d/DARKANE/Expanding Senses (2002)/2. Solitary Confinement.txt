Gaining strength by tearing you down
Weakened by physical torment
Broken down by psychological exhaustion
Stretch the limits of psychic tolerance
Paint out their pain in black and white
The pleasure of someone else's pain
The suffering of thousands created by my sinister hand
Thoughts made real

Trapped in mental prison for all eternity
Infinite pain far beyond the pleasure of suffering
No more fragrance, vision or sound
Just the conception of fear

Taste the darkness
Inhale the fear
Feed from hatred
A vision of purity

[1st lead: Ideberg - 2nd lead: Malmstrom]

Gaining strength by tearing you down
Weakened by physical torment
Broken down by psychological exhaustion
Stretch the limits of psychic tolerance

Punished into oblivion by this mind gone insane
Innocently condemned for all time
No more fragrance, vision or sound
Just the conception of fear

Taste the darkness
Inhale the fear
Feed from hatred
A vision of purity
Taste the darkness
Inhale the fear
Feed from hatred
A vision of purity
