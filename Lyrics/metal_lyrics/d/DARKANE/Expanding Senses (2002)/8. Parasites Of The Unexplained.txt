Approaching the end of mass destruction
Where countless lives fade away
Receiving the dark shadow of disruption
eternity has reached its final day
Ending the misery full of remorse
Absorbing the streams of hate
inhaling directly from the source
Arriving at the winter cold gate

The blood in my powerful veins
Spilled at unpromised domains

[lead: Ideberg]

Unexplored in a diminished sphere
Searching a new way to fulfil it self
secret wisdom in a labyrinth of fear
Now exploding to organic hell
No longer in charge of my destiny
The future is dark as my soul
The thoughts are growing with insanity
I'm falling down a bottomless hole

The blood in my powerful veins
Spilled at unpromised domains
Buried, my head in a wall
Hearing the deamons call
Scenting the evils breath
Doomed to be tortured to death

Approaching the end of mass destruction

eternity has reached its final day
Ending the misery full of remorse
Absorbing the streams of hate

The blood in my powerful veins
Spilled at unpromised domains
Buried, my head in a wall
Hearing the deamons call
Scenting the evils breath
Doomed to be tortured to death
