From peaceful moments to inferno
Early years passing through your mind
The expected world, now coloured in red
And within seconds, your soul is blind

I hear myself scream
The panic's chasing me
This is no dream

I'm not supposed to be here
I've never felt such painful fear

Aware of my flesh, is this for real
Turned inside out, (horrified) reality
The smell of death, subconscious, so clear
Gaining strength from own misery

I hear myself scream
The panic's chasing me
This is no dream

I'm not supposed to be here
I've never felt such painful fear

[lead: Malmstrom]

Awake from one nightmare to another
A new born tragedy, is this the bitter end?
The price I paid, a body slain
Entering a lower level of life

I'm not supposed to be here
I've never felt such painful fear
I'm not supposed to be here
I've never felt such painful fear
