[a=andreas]
[l=lawrence]

Agonised, in undecaying gloom
Dispassionate, agonised, calamity

[a] The mind is an ocean where chaos coincides with strict order
Sinking in a spiral the lowest abyss

[l] An infernal dominion built on annihilation
Subconscious sleep, no awakening

[a] Look towards the future
[al] But not so far that you can't see today
[a] Look towards the future
[al] Stand above all and set your spirit free

[m] Transmigration to hysteria
Infinite mortification
Mass destruction, divine ignorance
No shelter in the soul's sanctuary

[a] The destiny to be aggrieved into abhorrence
Deathless dimensions of nausea
[l] Diabolical evil from within
[al] Results in mental immolation

Agonised, in undecaying gloom
Dispassionate, agonised, calamity

[a] Look towards the future
[al] But not so far that you can't see today
[a] Look towards the future
[al] Stand above all and set your spirit free
