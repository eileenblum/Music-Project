Gain perspective of complex observations
Repulsive images painted on my retina
In deadly fear of this imaginary entity
The intersection of the material and intangible

Catatonic state of mind
Severe mania
Chronic schizophrenia
Catatonic state of mind
Emotionally devastating illness

Fading away
Memories are drained
Fading away
Embrace the paralyzing sin

Complete absence of emotions
Severe psychiatric disorders
Redemption from vengeful malignity
Sadistic rampage recalled from violence
Dissect the horrid madness
The bitter taste of anguish

Catatonic state of mind
Severe mania
Chronic schizophrenia
Catatonic state of mind
Emotionally devastating illness

Fading away
Memories are drained
Fading away
Embrace the paralyzing sin
