A deep lake of bitter silence
Surrounding the darkest side of hell
Savouring, memories of blood
Emotions drowning in lust

Expanding senses, constant pain
No more barriers to cross
Inflict the suffering on others
The world must face its loss

Hail the reptile behaviour
Once crawling from deep seas
The eternal face of humanity
Infected by fatal disease
All the horror you indulge
All the pain you create
How can you escape your fear
When the object of fear is hate?

Expanding senses, constant pain
No more barriers to cross
Inflict the suffering on others
The world must face its loss

Satisfy all appetites
As they arise
Pleading ignorance
This is your hell
That's where you want to be
Satisfy all appetites
As they arise
This is your hell

This is your hell
