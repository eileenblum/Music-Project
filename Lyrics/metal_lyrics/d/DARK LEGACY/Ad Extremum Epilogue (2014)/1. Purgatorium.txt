I'm passing the gates
There is fire aside
Though fields of neverend
There is nowhere where I can hide
Flames reaches higher
Purity by fire
My soul's been tainted
Shadows from the past
No forgot or forgotten
My pride leave me last
Flames reaches higher
Purity by fire
Condemned into fire
What's done, is left behind
Through suffer comes pain
A hanged man is blind
Flames reaches higher
Purity by fire
