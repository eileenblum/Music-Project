The moon was on the other side
of the earth, as darkness
Encloses the land
She runs through the forest
Forced by her own fear
All alone in the dark
Run, run, run for your life
Run, run, run for your life
In wane of all light
Among the wolves that howls in the night
Sacred she cry
She runs through the forest
Forced by her own fear
All alone in the dark
Run, run, run for your life
Run, run, run for your life
