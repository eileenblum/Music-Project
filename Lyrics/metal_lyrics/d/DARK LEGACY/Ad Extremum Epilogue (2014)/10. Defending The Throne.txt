Stormcloudâs forming, darken the sky
Bright fires agleam through the night
Black rainâs falling, as the thunder awakes
Sharp-honed steel in the pale moonâs light

Stormcloudâs forming, thunder now roar
Foreign troops has come to this land
Flaming torches burning bright
We grasp the swords in our hands

Defending the throne
Defending the throne

Silence brakes as the war horn alerts
Bright fires agleam through the night
Black rainâs falling as the thunder awakes
Sharp-honed steel in the pale moonâs light

Defending the throne
Defending the throne

Silence brakes as the new dawn awakes
Foreign troops has come to this land
Flaming torches, burning bright
We grasp the swords in our hands
