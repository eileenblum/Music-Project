The spark that once fed us
Now pat in our hearts
Bred from the starlit wonder
United after torn apart

Molten sea of darkness
Onto suns in twain
We ride the astral plane
Again and again

Eternal might
We were born to wield
Waging eternal wars
Glory lies afield

Molten sea of darkness
Onto suns in twain
We ride the astral plane
Again and again

Kneel you cowards
In the grip of fear
Across a crimson sky
We now appear
