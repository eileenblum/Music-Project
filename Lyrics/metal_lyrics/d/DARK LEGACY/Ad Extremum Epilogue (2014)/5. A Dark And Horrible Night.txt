Ride her white horse
Away from the past
Trying to escape
And vanish at last
A wolf is howling at the dreadful moon
As the elves are dancing
In the twilight zone
My only daughter
My firstborn child
Out baby's crying at the darkest sky
Disappeared in the night
Out of my sight
Horror and death
Her last breath

Forced by evil
They killed our daughter
In a dark and horrible
Night of slaughter
Angels cried demons gazed
A bitter end
With disgusting taste
Her only sin
Was love pure and strong
How could that be so wrong
Cruel and insane
But without complain
They left her bleeding
Alone on the ground
