Six, six, six feet under
Six, six, six feet under
The wind is cold and the sky so dark
The only sound a dog that bark
Digging a grave to bury my dear
On Halloween they all will fear
I'll command "wake up and rise"
Without a grace
My word shall be your law
Seek and destroy, there'll be no joy
Hour of revenge!

So there I stood in the front of the grave
Thinking of misery like a poor slave
The rain's been falling for far too long
Lightning strikes and break my song
The gloomy atmosphere
and the smell of death
So unreal just like a dream
Just want to leave, take me...
Six, six, six feet under
Six, six, six feet under
