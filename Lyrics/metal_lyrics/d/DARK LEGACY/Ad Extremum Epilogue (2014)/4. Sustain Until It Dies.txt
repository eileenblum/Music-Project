I crawl through nightmares
My light has come to fade
Remember sulphur rain falling
Falling as I close my eyes
I pray for mercy
Can no one hear my cries
A scream in suffocation
Sustain until it dies

Awoke in increasing pain
My bodyâs in mangled wounds
In blood I lie not breathing
Slowly in time to die
