Night arrive, the moonâs grown old
He shudder by obtrusive cold
The wind sough through trees in sway
Cluttered leaves on his way

Shimmering moon to thy he cry
Fallen tears that never dry

A streak of light caress his face
Trapped in here, this gloomy place
You darkened soul, descend in agony
Sudden mind of melancholy

Shimmering moon to thy he cry
Fallen tears that never dry
