I cry out to the world
âSo this is lifeâ
Pain, suffering and bleeding hearts
Why should I even try
When everything they told us
Seems to be nothing but a lie

In two thousand years
Youâve been waiting here in trust
The chosen ones who can heal this globe of lust
Where can I find them?
When will they appear?
Broken promises, is this what we deserve

Cry
Mankindâs going to die
Cry
Will we ever survive?

Thereâs a casket in the graveyard
For the wounded corpse
Ashes to ashes, dusk to dusk
May your soul rest in peace
Hope youâve lived this life so well
âCause beyond the door there may be no more

Cry
Dark and empty sky
Cry
Did God create this land?

âI donât want to cryâ
âI donât want to dieâ
