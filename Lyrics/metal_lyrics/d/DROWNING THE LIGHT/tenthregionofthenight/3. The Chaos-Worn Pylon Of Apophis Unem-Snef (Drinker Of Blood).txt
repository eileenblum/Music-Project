They sleep, dreaming the birth of shadows and un-creation
They writhe in primal darkness as their limbs retract and transform
Transcendence into the throat of Chaos, bathed in crimson
Let the cultic drums of the Mesu Betshet stir the ancient ones to undeath
Awakening with a memory of the screaming visage of long-forgotten prey
The stench of slowly mummified remains and the taste of dried blood
The mask of earthly Seth be taken off, in this abyss we are one of many coils
Apep stir and let your circle tighten to strangle and crush the living world
Darkener of the Earth, Saatet-ta, the names are many
Against the rites of Osiris the abyssic waters again storm against creation
Unem-Snef, I am protean in shape and form
Darkness my essence, a blazing flame to devour all life
No pylon is sacred, no deity untouchable
I smell all of their fear and shrinking terror, I will drink the blood of this world
Apep triumphs over Ra, let us drink the life of Ra
I am fiend and shadowy darkness, we devour to satisfy primal desire
Neha-hau, rotting awake in the cold, storming waters of chaos
Creation shall be un-made as we enter reverse into the mirrors of this world
Nothing shall halt our desire for primal chaos, immortal in our fire-shaped pylons
Ra is flayed and the essence of the Sun is un-made in darkness
We wake now in nightmares, even shadows shall be eaten
We thirst for the light, even the moon shall die in our strangling coils
Mesu Betshet under the Mask of Set-Typhon, our mastery shall remove order
Over the dead we shall feast and bathe in blood rather than water
Unem-Snef, I am the apex of the soul-eaters!
