Neter-kua Apep
Dejd-Hkna Ak-hkna!
Apophian majesty flays the skin of those before us
Into the Tuat our infection shall be planted
To grow and with disorder overthrow the old gods
No Order shall be the lawless spirit of Un-Creation
Bring Osiris before me, I shall strike and devour his Ka!
Ra shall enter my Black Sun of the chaos-sickened cosmos
None shall halt our shadowy mortifications of black fire
Your life is meaningless, yet the blood and flesh is but a taste
Become Apep in this circle, time is reversed and darkness consumes light!
My rites whispered to Unas to be practiced in great peril
Those who become gods shall enter my fiery gaze before me
No effigies except the broken symbols of order, your temples are nothing!
Let Sekhmet bathe in blood with us
Apophian triumph over Ra! Seth stands beside us now!
Apep conquers the light, all flesh will wither before our jaws of death
The Sun is devoured, creation un-made by rites of darkness
This world is consumed by the emptiness of the Void
Neteru become my feast and fiery transmutation, throats cut into my chalice!
Anet hra neter hen Apep, shape-shifting devils of darkness!
No gods before me, I devour them!
Hating the Sun, all must become darkness the primal ecstasy
Consuming the Sun, the other side of the mirror is wreathed in blackened fire
Apophis triumphs over Ra!
Neter-kua Apep
Dejd-Hkna Ak-hkna!
Apophian majesty fills the flesh until our time has come!
Into the Tuat we rule a crumbling vision of Order, Chaos remains!
