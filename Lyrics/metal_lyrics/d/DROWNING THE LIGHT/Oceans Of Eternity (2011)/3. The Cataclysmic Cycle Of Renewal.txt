Mushroom clouds grace the sky
heralding a new and sunless dawn
Nuclear fire rains upon the lands
the Armageddon made by human hands.

The wrath of God could not lay waste
the wretched world He once created
Mankind does not seek any salvation
from her self-inflicted damnation.

The judgement day won't be coming
like a thief in the dark of night
but with bloodshed and roaring thunder
of the world breaking asunder.

While earth is shattered and burnt
by a hailstorm of fire and steel
For those who are watching serenely
the utmost devastation is Epiphany.

That what is falling must be pushed
beyond the point of no return
but a New World bestowed upon New Man
From the abyss shall rise once again!
