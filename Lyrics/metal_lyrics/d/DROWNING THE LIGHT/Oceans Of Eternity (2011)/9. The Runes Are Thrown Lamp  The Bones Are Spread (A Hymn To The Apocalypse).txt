From the great halls of wisdom
a putrid virus grows 
A force of disaster
as the knowledge is sown
A hymn to the apocalypse
The runes are thrown
and the bones are spread
The sacrificial blood spilt
They all tell the same future...
One of death!
Watching the plague envelop
the inferior sheep
This curse as a wave
rotting the minds of the weak
A hymn to the apocalypse
