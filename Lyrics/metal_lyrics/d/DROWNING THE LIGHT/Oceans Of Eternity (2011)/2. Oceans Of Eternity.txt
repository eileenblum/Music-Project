Veins bleeding in the sky
red and blue pulses
Tearing storm clouds
above the horizon
The cold beat of my heart
in time with the thunder
The enchanted shimmer of the starlit night
across the oceans black face
Oblivion an endless sea of grief before me
Look up to a vision of that which came before us
and that which will remain long after our demise
And look down to the roaring void below
Oceans of eternity
I am torn from the rocks to the depths
No turning back no regrets
Coral cuts my skin as I descend
to the ocean floor amidst bone and sand
This tortured spirit that now rests
Slowly releasing my last breath
I am one with all and all is now one
A phoenix back to ashes where the circle begun
Oceans of eternity
