Raptured by the dawn of a new era
Your god long forgotten
Now reawaken the spirit once lost
A world in ruin
Despair in the hearts of even those who have faith
The white light now fallen
It is time for the tyrants to rule again
Ensnared by chaos and conflict
True strength emerges not from compassion but oppression
A new dark order
to light the path of the future
A new dark terror
to spread cruelty and suffering
They're too weak to fight
Our strength only grows
Our iron blue honour
Their final breath slows
