Ghastly phantoms stalk the hallways
Grey as the moist dungeon walls
The screams of past torture echo
and the rusted iron chains swing
The essence of pain forever stain
this ancient ruin
One can still feel the spark of black magic in the air
from a long dead being which cursed each corner
and carved in each wall
It haunts my dreams and knows my name
Now a relic of time
The 3 torches burning for centuries
The tombstones decayed
and the key still not found
