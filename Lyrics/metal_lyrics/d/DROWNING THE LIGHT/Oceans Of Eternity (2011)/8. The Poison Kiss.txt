The grass lands burning through summer heat
The marshland fog where dead spirits meet
The mountain air stealing my soul
This unholy dominion takes control
I am bound to this dark pull
that possess my being
In this desolate southern dominion
where all hope is fleeing
The horizon beckons to eternity
as a black tempest swarms so vigorously
A torrent of hatred takes my hand
as master Satan takes command
I am bound to this dark pull
that possess my being
In this desolate southern dominion
where all hope is fleeing
The left hand path I forever take
Pain and devastation in my wake
For our enemies their bones will break
and their own faith they forsake
For when you hear the call from the abyss
there is no escape from the poison kiss
And when it's all dust none shall miss
the christian scum &amp; the zionist!
