Dusk...
As the mountains swallow the sun
Shadows of eternity reach our enemies throats
Cutting the hope from their hearts
As the stars light the path of glory
And the time of man at the end of its story
Their blood forms rivers that divide nations, but they are of the same poison
Children of the light... Extinguished...
Now nothing more then smoke in the wind
As the stars light the path of glory
And the time of man at the end of its story
Their saviour - death
Their heaven - soil
Their eternal glory - rotting
Their god - forgotten
The weak always fall
No instinct left
All their faith based on lies
The beast within suppressed
Their saviour - death
Their heaven - soil
Their eternal glory - rotting
Their god - forgotten
Embrace the beast inside!
Or the shadows of eternity that are cast at dusk will reach your throat next...
