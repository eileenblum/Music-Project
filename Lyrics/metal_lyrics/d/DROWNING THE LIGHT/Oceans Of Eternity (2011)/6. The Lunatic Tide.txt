A wash of scarlet over the moon
confuses the ocean tides
A midnight hymn out of tune
Calling out to something deep within
A brooding insanity that will begin
For when this night song of original sin
possesses my soul the lunacy starts therein
To dance the dance of insomnia
To feel the surge of nature
To know the kiss of the unsettled
To taste the essence of the creature
The lunatic tide
Moon! I am yours!
