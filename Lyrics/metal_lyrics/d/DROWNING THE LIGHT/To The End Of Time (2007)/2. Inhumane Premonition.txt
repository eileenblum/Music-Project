Symbol of static, void of chaos
Burnt into the flesh, scarred within the bone
The chill evoked the Apparitional Mist
The fate of spirit, the trans-communal tapping of blood
The web of entrapment veiled upon the sleeping corpses
In flesh we shall crawl, as pestilence with the determination of maggots upon decay
That which gives death, is marked with our Sign.
Abominations which contort the 8 ways of Chaos, from the all seeing eye
As preternatural being, as spirit projected from the Blood
The path of the unseen illuminates
The portal of touch is forced open
The curse of will is breathed into life
A pestilential projection,
A thorn in the sleeper's side
Blood shall lead the past
Blood shall lead the future
In the blood through the blood
The present reveals all
The Foreboding visions of which glance into the blind
The whispering of demon tongues into the mind
The draining presence of astral tyranny
All unseen by the sleeper's eyes
Through Fire, through Thought
The consumption of Ego
Extensions beyond flesh
Earthly matter ceases to exist
The moon is drawn into ethereal shape
Shape wielding talon and claw
The Eye of Thoth opened
The star in the serpent moon is aligned
The grand star fall, the omega of Eclipse
A planet evolution spawned from chaos
Descending to Death
None shall stand in flesh and witness rebirth
