Where is your pride,
Have you all forgotten the laws of nature,
Hailed by our ancestors forbearers of our lands,
Where are your eyes,
Have you lost your path,
Once follow the way of our elders,
The way of the wyrd,
Have you forgotten our pagan past,
Take heed of their call from the forest to the mountains,
The throne of once gods,
Now man ruler of all,
Tell your folk to take heed.
Where is your pride,
Foreign belief and god you wear,
A path that is not for you,
When will you understand?
Your pagan past calls,
To join the march of our heathens blood,
Our pagan past,
Ancestor's pride that is our honour,
March of ode,
Our pagan past to survive,
We must destroy this foreign belief and way of modern life,
Where is your pride.
