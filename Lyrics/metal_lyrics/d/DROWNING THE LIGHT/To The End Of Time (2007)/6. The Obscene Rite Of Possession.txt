As Night Terror, as Plague, as Pestilence and Darkness
The inhuman manifestation of Demonic turmoil
Tearing from the gates, ripping at the soul,
A presence known through means of Torment,
The shadowed left hand of darkness
Reaching through the Luciferian Twilight
Seizing the right hand of God
And the gates are let open.
Diabolic Ascension
From the mortal flesh of the Possessed
The gate of blood spilt is drawn
The mortal shell is ripped apart
1 of 3 fallen, 1 of 3 which bear the venom of God
Lurking in Shadow, shifting in form
Bearer of the Morning star
Sic Lvcreat Lvx!
Sickness, as the lord of all fevers and plagues
Splitting of the Mind, Schizophrenia
Revelation, spoken in ancient tongues
Cursed, humanity.
In serpent skin, one may slither amongst the rats
Immune of the venomous rebellion
As an angelic sigil inverted
As a scar upon the name of God
