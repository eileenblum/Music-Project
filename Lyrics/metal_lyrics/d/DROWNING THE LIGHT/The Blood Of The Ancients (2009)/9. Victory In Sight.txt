Blood!

Through the turmoil we rise
With our pride burning deep inside
As its rooted in our veins
Blood passed on from fathers
To their sons
Our motherland calls to its children
Fight on! fight on!
Our motherland calls to its children
Fight on! Fight on!

Through the turmoil we rise
With our pride burning deep inside
As its rooted in our veins
Blood passed on from fathers
To their sons
Our motherland calls to its children
Fight on! Fight on!
Our motherland calls to its children
Fight on! Fight on!

Under one banner victory in sight
Win or lose no matter the outcome
We have fought with honour
We have fought with pride
We have fought for our blood
We have fought for what's inside
Our motherland calls to its children... fight on...fight on...
