As the funeral dirge solemnly plays
A grave ravaged by time
With one decaying rose
Laying subtly on top of the cracked earth
Alone in a cemetery of benevolence
Death by ones own hand
Gives them this curse

When dusk breathes its last breath
And the eerie dirge fades
A melancholic apparition appears
Sitting in sorrow
Waiting to pass the other side
Forever bound here
Longing for that which will never come

And when the dawn bleeds in
Fading back to nothingness
Till dusk breathes again
The nights so empty
The nights so lonely
Haunting in sadness
