Through the flames of the modern world
An honour is still held high
Through the corruption of this poisoned earth
A pride that will never die

March to the end knowing we may never win
Watch all that you know crumble
Yet still fight on for all you believe in

March to the end knowing we may never win
Watch all that you know burn

And as your comrades fall all around
As all you once knew rots in the ground
You cannot lose sight of the higher purpose that your serve
Never forget what this wars about they all get what they deserve

March to the end knowing we may never win
Watch all that you know crumble
Yet still fight on for all you believe in

As your blood flows over the earth
The seeds you have sown
Dying with a purpose
This will not be the end
But a new beginning
This is not about one but all
The darkness is the guiding light
And now we are one
This will not be the end
And now we are one
