The waves swelling as the tide rolls in
shimmering black rocks reflecting the moon's glow
the thunderous echo of water breaking on stone
cloaked figures gather and form a circle
chanting to the depths of the abyss
the darkness hearing their call

O' Leviathan of the deep
hear our chants
vengeance to reap

The water bubbles and a piercing scream is heard
the moon is eclipsed in cloud
the murky waters reveal the one

O' Leviathan of the deep
hear our chants
vengeance to reap

A pin pricking the fingers of the cult
a fimble of blood poured into the ocean
a burnt scroll with a list of names
the last time these scrolls will ever be seen
baptised or not, the demons of the depths
shall drag you into the black beyond

O' Leviathan of the deep
hear our chants
vengeance to reap
