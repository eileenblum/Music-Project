Through moss and stones
Under the fallen leaves of the broken forest
Lays the path to the lost passage

A passage of mystery and knowledge
Lost in legend and time
A fallen angels spell unfolds
through the cavern of black light

A ghastly wind whips the fallen leaves
They cut through the air like knives through flesh
revealing the cobbles below
Towards a cave like entrance lit by the fading rays of the sun

A passage of mystery and knowledge
Lost in legend and time
A fallen angels spell unfolds
through the cavern of black light

A storm of ages covers the sun and the rays of light are extinguished
Rain moistens the moss and stone and an ancient mist rolls over

The mountainside eclipsed by shadow, revealing sigils in wood and ash, and the streams of life dry
As plumes of a vile aroma intoxicate the air, this ancient curse has been unleashed
The masters poison we drink, knowledge gained from his elixir, we reap and harvest the worms below
The occult shroud lifted reveals the angles within angles we are his carrion
