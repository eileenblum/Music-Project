The scent of the soil fresh after the nights rain
floats through the mausoleum

From his crypt
staggering after centuries of collecting dust and dirt
the devourer of the sun and child of the moon

Cutting the throat of innocence
drinking the sacrament of purity
rituals of blood and flesh
an ancient evil still walks the earth

Forever plagued
he's never fled
from his blackened heart
that is forever dead
Immortal bonds
keep him in earth's cage
cast from heavens grace
he wields a thousand year rage
