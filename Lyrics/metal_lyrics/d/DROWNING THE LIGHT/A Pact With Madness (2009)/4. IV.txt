After meeting the spark of all that breathes and bleeds
How could I leave with my pride and sanity intact?
By understanding of the world in ruins
By image blurred
By I in doubt
By soul at one with nothing.
I lurk amongst the waters
I can see but cannot hear
And inside I cannot hear
In this secluded environment
I can sit and manifest the mystical practices of old
A bark pillar grows within me, Stone overturns stone
Until my soul is nought but rock, hard as my conviction
All life is merely passing phase, a breeding ground
For vermin, filthy as they are naive
So as I hold in my hand this burning bush of sacred herbs,
So in my pillar of heart I hold contempt for all life in this realm
And it is contempt that fuels My thirst for pure knowledge...
