"And it will whisper to me secrets of the world...
...There will come a time
When a golden worm will gnaw it's way into the center of my skull.
It will whisper to me secrets of the world
And unfold truths to which I have been blind.
At this point I will utter final curses
And promptly hang myself
So that I may achieve an immense amount of spite
By holding back all the knowledge gained
At the conclusion of my life."
