To brown all and any sparks of light
Seems to be the only semi-comprehensive goal
Present int he hermit's slippery brain.
(His thoughts writhe almost as if
They were the embodiment of coiled serpent
Slowly eating and digesting itself, unawares...)
To Drown the self in the murky depths of the self
Layer by worthless layer the soul is peeled of its breath.
By virtue of non-action the modern sadists get their fir
Kobed in wounds teething with pus
Gathering dust
Screaming in torturous tongues
Spinning webs of lies.
Every miserable corner of the earth is the same.
