And from a ruined kingdom we RISE!

As disciples of the shadows - we rise
Storming the gates of religious filth - their demise
Like an epidemic of utter darkness - we rise
Being swept away by holocaust winds - their holy lies

And through darkness we find enlightenment

Like an epidemic of utter darkness - we rise
Being swept away in black smoke - their holy lies

A plague of blackness

In desert sands
filth of the land
and nailed to the cross
The king of lies
whom we despise
his end is not a loss
For its never to late
to change our fate
and rise above the rest
For on this hour
this empires ours
to pass our final test
In the darkest night
we see true light
Under Satans mighty horns
the power of our plight.
