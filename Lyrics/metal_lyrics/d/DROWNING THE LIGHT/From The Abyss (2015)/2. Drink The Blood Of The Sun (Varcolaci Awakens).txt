As a thread is spun in the darkness by a forgotten witch
a bridge between planes and a portal through the cosmos unfolds!

In the skin of a wolf
On the wings of a ghost
Drain the essence of the moon
Drink the blood of the sun

As the heavenly bodies drip from the crimson thirst
and through the severed astral veil the Varcolaci returns!

Light a red candle before they close
Inhale the jasmine smoke
Let it all melt away and take flight, to their dismay
Absorb the feeling of pride inside, before leaving your earthly side
Whether in the form of a beautiful flowing phantom
or a ghastly wraith
Open your wolvish maw and drain the world of it's cursed soul!
