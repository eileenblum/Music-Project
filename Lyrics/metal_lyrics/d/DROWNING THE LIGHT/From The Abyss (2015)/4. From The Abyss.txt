A swirling tempest above
tearing asunder the clouds

The fabric of existence
torn and ripped yet immortal

As i stood at the edge of time
I watched a world in decline
Creating light through Lucifers eye
and to escape from deaths reaping scythe

And from the abyss we emerge
Heavy hearted and yearning
For that dawn that will never come
We are the nocturnal children, nights unholy sons

A new uprising of dark power
For we have tasted the end
But a Promethean flame
is lit in the heart and mind
To embrace the new tide.
