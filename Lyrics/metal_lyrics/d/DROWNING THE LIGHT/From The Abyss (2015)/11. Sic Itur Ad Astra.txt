Cloaked in the shadows of the dead
and robed in the skin of damnation
Black sun and black moon
The power of will, the power of flesh

Ordo ater anguis
Luceat lux vestra
Sine metu
Sic itur ad astra
Lux ex tenebris
Mors omnibus

The standard bearer of plague and lust
The illuminated eye opens

Luciferi Lux Mea Est
Sic itur ad astra
