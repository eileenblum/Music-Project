Injecting venom into the stream
where the well thinking pigs drink

As a serpent coiled around its prey
Filling the blood stream with deathly toxin
Tightening, restricting as the veins blacken
Yet entranced by Apeps eyes

To swallow the river of life
and to bring chaos and strife

Just below the horizon he stalks
Waiting at dusk his whispers forked
Then come dawn to strike the sun again
Encircling the world in an eternal flame

And in the end, our destiny like scales to be shed

As the tail is released and we fall towards oblivion
The light dies as worlds collide enraptured by the forbidden

As the tale is told the strong crawl out from the darkest hole
The serpent once again locks its jaws regeneration to behold.
