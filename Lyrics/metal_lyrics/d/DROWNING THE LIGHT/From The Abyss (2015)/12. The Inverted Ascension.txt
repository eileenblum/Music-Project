The absolute absence of light
is not to be found above but below.
In a world hidden from our sight
beneath the calm surface of the sea.

With awe does man look upward
to the myriad of stars in the sky.
While he trembles in silent fear
of the horrors lurking under his feet.

Maelstroms in the bottomless depths
echo with murmurs of the Ancient Ones.
From deep down they call your name
tempting you to join them in their realm.

Be baptized with the primordial waters
let them wash off the stench of humanity.
Ascend deeper, and rise farther down,
until the darkness and you become One.
