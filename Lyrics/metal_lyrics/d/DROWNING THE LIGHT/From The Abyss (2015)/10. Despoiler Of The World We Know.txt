I am the spear in the side of christ
I am all you fear and spite
The flame that ignites your feeble church
The crushing defeat that you makes you hurt

I am the black smoke in the air
I am death and despair
The immortal spirit of the past
The one who makes you the last

Heresy! Bringer of the old cold
Heresy! Despoiler of the world we know.
