A starry endless night of grief
An eternal sea of mindless sheep
A void in life one can't deny
Longing for the heavens to cry

A spirit corroded and corrupted
Not bound to your morals and codes
Sleepless nights studying the dark arts

To forge a path in hate and death
To know the secrets of the darkest spells
To master the knowledge of the ancient ones
To embrace the curse of endless nights

To spit in the face of god
and to set the heavens ablaze
Turning their light to ashes
The only phoenix from these ruins - death!

A now reborn world free and unfettered
A once lost beauty returns and flourishes
Religious heads on pikes
Their fall will not be mourned.
