Through the morning fog
leaving the port behind
A cursed voyage sets sail

Across the seven seas she goes
towards the unknown
Through mist and tidal fury
A watery tomb enthroned

Those on deck
yearn for promised shores
In gallows below
Exhausted to the core

And from the rocks a melody mocks as they hear the sirens call
Luring sailors to their deaths are these angelic whores
The captain screams as the harpies gleam proud of their devilish work
A dozen men, drowned and submerged, and then a dozen more

Escaping one peril only leads to another
and soon they became one with the fog
Lost, forgotten,and cursed for eternity.
