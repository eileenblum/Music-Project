In a crumbled city
of forgotten dreams and lost hope
Overgrown ruins
gilded in shadow and cloaked
This decaying glory
A once prosperous land
To the dead hearted
They were never my clan

The return of medieval sorrow

Fortify your own soul
Know the power of the flesh
Expand your deepest thoughts
and drown the weakness

We bleed our own path - unto glory
We cut the ley lines of the new millennium

Fill them from your veins
and let the sanguine
feed the earth
It is now ours! And they will lament!

The return of medieval sorrow.
