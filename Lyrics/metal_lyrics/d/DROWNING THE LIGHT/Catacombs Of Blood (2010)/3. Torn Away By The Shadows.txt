In a time of tyranny and strife
A bloodied hand rises
In adversity to conformity calling out the night and embracing the beast insides
For a new dark age is upon us

The cycle around the sun soon to cease and the coming of the dawn that never rises
The empty throne of a dead god
Twisted and distorted by the white light
Torn away by the shadows
For only in utter blackness can you truly see the light

The frozen stone which marks the death of thousands of the Nazarenes "chosen"
Void of any remaining hope
All that is left if the passage of death as ties with this world are severed
The oceans spill the black blood of the earth as it rots from the inside

The cycle around the sun soon to cease and the coming of the dawn that never rises
The empty throne of a dead god
Twisted and distorted by the white light
Torn away by the shadows
For only in utter blackness can you truly see the light

The strong transcend through spheres of negative energy
Times stands still as the world falls below
Guided by morbid phantoms and shadows that watch over
Tendrils of blackness mother the spirit and caress the soul with poisonous affection as Satans will is enforced
