Rolling thunder echoes the cries of war to crush the miserable disciples of the white light
A curse is unleashed to spread rot and mould withering the elysian fields

Smash the gates
Victory awaits
Reeking of sin
Crushing gods kin
Unholy power this darkest hour
The heavens flood with angels blood

Smouldering remains of hypocrisy showing no mercy to the slaves of Jehovah
The fire that burns is one of wrath vengeance flails their weakness

Smash the gates
Victory awaits
Reeking of sin
Crushing gods kin
Unholy power this darkest hour
The heavens flood with angels blood

Drinking the scarlet wine from seraphims lifeless carcasses
Faces gaunt and eyes of stone the surge of immortality pulses as this curse is enthroned
Bow to your new Master

Smash the gates
Victory awaits
Reeking of sin
Crushing gods kin
