Beginning of the return journey
To the tree of knowledge
Where once our race was born
The hunger, the thirst
Eating my soul from within
Time for this dream to seize
Blood flows all the night

Never too soon, never too late
To change the course of life
As the heinous symbols are carved
On the entrance of illumination

And from the north comes evil
Weaving destructive spells
The serpent's voice in my heart
As a guiding arctic star
A sign for the lineage of kings
Who were all hinderers of God
By the miracle of Satan
By the will of Satan

Ascend, immortal spirit of wisdom
Let the light of your Black Flame
Shine through and purify
Burn the false and causal truth
Tear asunder the illusions
Revealing the hidden forbidden
Through your prophet and mouth
The timeless resonance is spread
