[performed by Drowning the Light]A plague is born Upon a new era
That which grows in the minds incapacitated of will
As a virus wide spread

One falls and infects the flock
Contaminating the masses
The ego no longer within But stained in mass hysteria
Belief no longer founded by trial

Their will be of survival diminished
Their struggle for life yields nothing
All to succumb to the point of Zero
From useless to used

As slavery can produce Mighty goals of one mind
Immune to the infection Are those who instigate Rebellion from the herd
And testing the limits of one's self
The limit's of one self Must be fought with aggression
