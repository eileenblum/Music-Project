[performed by Drowning the Light]By law, standard and remorse
Trained away from instinct
the more upright species walk
There is one source of the life sustenance

Survival is recycling the life
The beast shall strive again
Once gifted of all life form
abandoned by the aliens of hybrid experimentation.

Perfection beyond nature has been tries
Never has it been surpassed
Upon the Earth, in heaven and within hell
The cosmos have yet to be explored

A glimpse into the milky way
Still altered by poor vision
Science of democracy
Approved by the consensus of the blind

There is a time to hold your breath
There is a time to move silently
There is a time to cover one's own stench
There is a time to aim and strike for the heart.

Blessed are the reptiles, the ageless, the oldest ones
Simple yet most advanced
Cursed are the living who desecrate the land from which gave birth
Common are the parasites

As a splinter in the flesh the wound shall heal itself
To live requires death
To overpopulate requires redemption
The infestation of parasites, or the abundance of human beings

The importance is nil
Eyes (of silence).

There was once one rite
that we seal the sores of the mother of wounds
(black) sun steals their life and filters the filth from that
There is only one cycle that revolves around and cycles around us
Yes millions of cycles revolve around us and pain
The Cycle of Oblivion.

Importance is great
there is no Surface to Pain.
