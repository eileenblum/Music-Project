[performed by Drowning the Light](A splitting of the mind a tearing of the flesh
Such as one's very own world ripped to shreds
There exists a fork in the road)
at the path's end of lividity
one towards eternal rest
and one of a circle to the beginning

As great as the tests of illusion
greater are the floggings of time
As sturdy as the fist of physical laws
the astral experience works as fluid

Bending around matter
Torn but healing instantly
Blood which never coagulates
One drop or one thousand liters

The essence remains immaculate
In sudden breath, the last breath is exhaled
Fast as the slight of hand ties the noose of the hangman
The Reflex of Shadows
(tightens in an imminent knot)

There is but one exit
From the everlasting cycle
the tail to the mouth
Of the orouborus spiral
The hourglass opens the portal
The scythe clears the path
