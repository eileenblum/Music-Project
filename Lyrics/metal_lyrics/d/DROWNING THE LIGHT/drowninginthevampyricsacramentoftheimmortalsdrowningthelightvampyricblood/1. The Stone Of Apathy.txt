[performed by Drowning the Light]A bullet to my brain I saved
For a rainy day of depression for many years
Now it has meaning
For the enemies forgotten there is always one who I don't forget
One that will walk without fear
Now the Bullet is a symbol for vendetta

And the Skull shall split wide open
I will bathe in the blood and see the grand maneuver
Of Azrael's Descent as my enemies die
One must wait down stream
And watch their enemies float by
This is when the beauty of time and vengeance conjoin
Surreal to let unfold as an art-form
