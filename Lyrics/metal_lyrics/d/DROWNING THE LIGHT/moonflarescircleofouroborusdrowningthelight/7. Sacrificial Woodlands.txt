[performed by Drowning the Light]A murder of ravens circle the woodlands below
Drawn to the crimson sanguine
Dripping from the altar
Souls gather around the stones
Chanting incantations
And burning native incense
The sacrifices' screams tear through the sky
Sigils painted over their naked body
In blood and ash
As a cloaked and painted figure
Plunges a knife deep into their chest...
Between the lines of the pentagram
The blood flows
And then the forest is silent
The eyes of the worshippers
Wash over in black mercury
The dark pull in nature raptures their very being
Possessed by darkness, haunted by the light
Now one with all
