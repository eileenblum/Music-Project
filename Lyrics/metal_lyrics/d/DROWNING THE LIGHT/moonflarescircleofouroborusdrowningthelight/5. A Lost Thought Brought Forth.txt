[performed by Drowning the Light]A fate forever unknown
As the spiraling illusions swell
Within this chaos comes calm
And from this calm comes chaos
Waking from morbid dreams
But never remembering their message
A frozen moment in time
A lost thought brought forth
A frozen moment in time
A lost through brought forth
To walk the path of ruin
To know the voice of despair ...it is my own
A choice now in stone ... it is my own
This insanity that plagues me
I now call home
A frozen moment in time
A lost thought brought forth
