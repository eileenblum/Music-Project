[performed by Drowning the Light]The bell tolls for my passing
Put to rest in the moist ground
So dark and reminiscent
From a time when I was younger
When I knew the destiny
That carved its name into my chest
One of uncompromising pain
Dark visions and sorrow
Silver so cold on my eyelids
Payment for the ferryman when he comes for me
I passed with honour and pride
I did not fear this next phase
Only embraced it... I had always embraced it...
The only certainty
Is the uncertainty of what lies beyond
And where my dark soul will soar forever after
