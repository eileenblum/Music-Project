[performed by Drowning the Light]As the cycles of the moon draw to an end
To that night where only the stars can see
Where darkness conceals the horror
And death stalks the warmth in the autumn air
Innocence is all but lost and forgotten
And this night knows no forgiveness
Oh how the moon's light brought comfort to the living
And in its absence the true nocturnal creatures lurk
The wind howls an unearthly howl
And the candles flicker before their glow is extinguished
The darkness can play tricks
Swelling and changing as one's eyes adjust
It is too late then...
Swept away into the unknown... by the unknown...
Innocence is all but lost and forgotten
And this night knows no forgiveness
Oh how the moon's light brought comfort to the living
And in its absence the true nocturnal creatures hunt
