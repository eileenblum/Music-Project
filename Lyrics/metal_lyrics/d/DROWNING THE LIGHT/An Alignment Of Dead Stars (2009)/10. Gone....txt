As the structured decay
as the reign of modern man falls by his own hand
there is nothing left but rubble
black burnt buildings
and a dead silence.
Walk with your head held high
to the end of time
the final chapter of our existence is night
and as the black snow of fallout remains flutter down
embrace that which you are.
The hand held out by god is a lie
this hell we created for ourselves.
I remember a time when I still cared
now it's all gone!
I remember a time when I still feared
now it's all gone!
I remember a time when I still cared
now it's all gone!
I remember a time when I still feared
now it's all gone!
Floating away in flakes of black human remains
