Touched by darkness and abandoned by light
lost at sea.
A vessel of damnation, a cursed voyage
the broken mast torn free.
Sent by the church to bury the evidence
manuscripts in blood.
Taken from the souls struck down by the inquisitors
alive on burning poles.
Pulled by black currents below, the dark one has a hold.
This ship will not reach it's final port it will be dragged to the depths
Struggling crusaders scurry like rats
to their life boats.
The ocean bed covered in black oil
covering all that remains above

One by one the survivors fade
slowly being dragged to their ocean grave
There unholy shipment washing away
back into the unknown where they shall stay
and in their final resting place
deep below the darkness they will face
our dark lords secrets fade
until the final judgement day
