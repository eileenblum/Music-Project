From the depths of the Carpathians
a tyrant whose family was tortured and bled
by foreign invaders
In 1453 when the final christian stronghold fell
their presence was obliterated by the wolf of carpathia
Come 1456 his tyranny reigned
those who disobeyed him got no mercy
infants impaled through there own mother's chests
the rotting forests of impaled corpses
decaying for months as a warning

As the turkish dogs attacked his keep
his ivory goddess flung herself landing deep
into the river where her body slowly sunk to the bottom
her last breath taken in beautiful suicide
condemned to purgatory for eternity

The impaler takes his revenge
renouncing the cross and drinking the sacrament of eternity
burning these muslim rats alive
taking their life force
immortal and proud
drowning the white light
