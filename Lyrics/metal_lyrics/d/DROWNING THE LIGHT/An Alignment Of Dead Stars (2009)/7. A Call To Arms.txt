Our united dark lands sound the battle call
brothers it is time to take up arms and make the enemy fall!!!
Arms to the sky as our banners fly high
this is our calling, this is our pact
we cannot - turn back!
This war may never be won, but we will fight until the bitter end!
This war may never be won, but we will fight on
We will meet again
Stories will echo of those few who stood strong
those few who fought on
Our united dark lands gather for attack
brothers it is time to take up arms and make the enemy fall!!!
Arms to the sky as our banners fly high
this is our calling, this is out pact
we cannot - turn back!
This war may never be won, but we will fight on
until the bitter end
we will meet again my friend..
We answered out call to arms!!
