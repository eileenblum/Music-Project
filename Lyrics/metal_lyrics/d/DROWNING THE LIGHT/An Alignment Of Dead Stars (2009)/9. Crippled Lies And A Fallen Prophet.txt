Black putrid and frail
this modern shell of a world
hollowed out by greed
filled with materialism and hedonism
you have forgotten your way!

Candles light the path of truth
and the journey to salvation
is not one through your god
but through what you might call damnation
we are the spear of black destiny
and the nails in the cross
we are the crown of thorns
and all that you lost

Crippled lies and a fallen prophet
your false idol
cries, whimpers, and bleeds
