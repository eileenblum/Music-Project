Blood covered rust
on my blade
comrades at arms
by my side
awaiting the call...
The sound of battle horn flows throughout the land..
The sound of the battle horn strikes the heart of our enemy...
Clash of steel, splintering shields
severing flesh, cutting through mesh
ending ones life, into the night.
The battle rages for days and the weak ones fall
the passion that drives us will make them crawl
Clash of steel
splintering shields
severing flesh
cutting through mesh
ending ones life
into the night
We break through their front line
screams of victory as the cowards retreat
