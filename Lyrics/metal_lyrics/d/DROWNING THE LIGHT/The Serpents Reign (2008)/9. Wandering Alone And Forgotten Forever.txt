[Lyrics by Tortured Soul]

The soaring peaks, forgotten by time
Alone and desolate in the cold forever
The soaring cliffs of suicide
Calling me, embracing me
Wandering alone and forgotten forever
Bitterness brought upon by the ages
Following footprints in snow
made by warriors long ago
Along the frozen path of time
into the bitter winds of eternity
Across icy seas of sorrow
the end is calling me
the birds fly south
from the freezing shadows
Behold the wondrous gift
to end ones life
