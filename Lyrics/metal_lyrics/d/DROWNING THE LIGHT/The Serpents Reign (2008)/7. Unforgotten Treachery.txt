[Lyrics by Azgorh]

Pain and agony from our wrath
Suffering is not enough
writhe in torment
Your betrayal has not been forgotten
Your false ideals and attitudes are not worthy
You claim to serve under the master's name
You serve for your own selfish game
You dog of god
Our dedication
Our hatred
Our intolerance
For Satan
It reaches to you
Look down and see the blood
See your end and know why
Your support the sub humans
we crush
You tolerate the degenerates
Heil Victory as we will not lose
In his honour!
