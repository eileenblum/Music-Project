[Lyrics by Azgorh]

Lightning strikes upon the mountain
Where dark old rituals take place
Sermons of unholy filth
and depraved acts in his name
for the coming of a new age
and his new empire
Candles burning through the soft rain
Contorted faces surrounding the altar
as the witching hour strikes
The last candle burns out
an unearthly scream
with the birth of a new ago
Godless cries
from the lord of all flies
Dark chants continue till dawn
he is unearthly spawn
The child...baptised in lamb's blood
and sigils carved into his body
Soon to lead both man and beast...
