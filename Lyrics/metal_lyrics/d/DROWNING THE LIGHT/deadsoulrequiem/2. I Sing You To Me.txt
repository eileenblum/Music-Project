Baptized in Serpent's blood, I wait for thee.
Bloodstained rituals carves names into me.
Visions mesmerized whispers obscure
of long forgotten Sins, Salvation insecure.

I have read of Stones that wept wounded.
I have seen old Trees that once cried.
I live the Curse of the meaning forever
and all I have left is to sing you to me.

I sing you to me!
