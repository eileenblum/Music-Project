Through my lifetime I wrote the words
for my Requiem.
Was I hated? Was I loved?
What's my legacy?

Was the burden of my lies
a daemons charm?
I'll stay abandoned, from his grace,
in my woe and harm.

And the pikes rages endlessly
through my dead veins.
Hunting down my mortal soul
eternally...
