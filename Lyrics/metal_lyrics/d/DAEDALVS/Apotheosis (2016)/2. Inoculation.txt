Beneath the twisted shards of incessant pain,
Reborn by the celestial phases above
Lust for perpetual death and ethereal ascendancy

Unleash me from wretched existence
Blackened vessel of aberration vomit me forth.. vomit me forth
The confines of this mortal realm cannot contain me
Purge and expel forth
Humanity lost, reincarnated once more
Submit to facile cessation
The infinite cycle starts again

Purge and expel forth
Humanity lost, reincarnated once more
Purge and expel forth
Submit to cessation

Beneath the twisted shards of incessant pain
Reborn by the celestial phases above
Lust for perpetual death and ethereal ascendancy

Held within the shackles of eternity,
Unlimited vitality I am power wrought beyond bone and blood
A spectre of the universe
Purge and expel forth

With no sense of purpose but immortality
Ingrained forever between life and oblivion
Sanity fading [2x]

Beneath the twisted shards of incessant pain,
Reborn by the celestial phases above
Lust for perpetual death and ethereal ascendancy

Unleash me from wretched existence
Blackened vessel of aberration vomit me forth.. vomit me forth
The confines of this mortal realm cannot contain me

Humanity lost, reincarnated once more
Submit to facile cessation
The infinite cycle starts again
Beneath the twisted shards of incessant pain
Unleash me from wretched existence
Blackened vessel of aberration vomit me forth
Humanity lost, reincarnated once more
Submit to facile cessation
