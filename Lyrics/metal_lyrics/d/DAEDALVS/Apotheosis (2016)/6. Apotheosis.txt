An efflorescence of perfection
Vulnerable amongst the frigid infinity
Vulnerable
Fit for dissection and reprogramming
A befitted prize of allure for whom to claim

Plunging into earth, an empyrean entity emerges with a surge of dread
A cosmic chariot of antiquity awaiting for departure
Resolve quickly relinquished
Under the dismal rays of the sun

Abducted, inseminating forcibly bereaving her humanity
To plant the future seed

A surrogate to hold forced genetic mutations
The future seed of extinction
A descent into the desolate void and regurgitate (intelligent design)

Re-purposed to kill itself through violent ignorance
Our false apotheosis is at an end
Evolution decides who is god now
Our false apotheosis is at an end
Evolution decides who is god now

Our false apotheosis is at an end
Re purposed to kill itself through violent ignorance
A descent into the desolate void and regurgitate mankind
Collapse, to the true inheritors of gaia

Vultures gorge upon the rotting flesh
Miasma sickening and infecting whats left
Necrotic fasciitis
Our false apotheosis is at an end
Becoming one with the dead
Collapse, to the true inheritors of gaia

Extraterrestrial infrastructure has been built for millennia to house coordinates of return
This method of extermination is gradual but absolute

A re engineered human genome to cause mass suicide by nuclear detonation
As... as the flames cleanse this method of extermination is gradual but absolute


Thanks to daedalusdeathmetal for sending track #4 lyrics.
