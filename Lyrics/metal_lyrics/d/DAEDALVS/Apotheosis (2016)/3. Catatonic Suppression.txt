The structured reality bleak reflects the peak of technological advancement
Mechanical hives keeping pace with the rate of efficiency
Transmutation of the earth, demand of production consuming life
Becoming closer to the machines we replicate
Invalid awareness by suffering of corporate oppression
A digital shroud fabricated by beings of steel that facilitate beyond perception
Hard wired in the sleeping pods we waste away
A God delusion spawned by the early stages of incorrect binary process
Displaying a temporary state of vision to view the captors who hover above flickering in and out of sight
Human cattle we have devolved into
Our minds fractured, dementia inherited for thousands of years
The origin of enslavement unknown, domesticated from birth
As a living energy source, veins flowing with toxins/sedatives
An appalling tower spire with its denizens suspended
Hard wired in the sleeping pods we waste away
The structured reality bleak reflects the peak of technological advancement
Mechanical hives keeping pace with the rate of efficiency
Transmutation of the earth, demand of production consuming life
Becoming closer to the machines we replicate
Invalid awareness by suffering of corporate oppression
A digital shroud fabricated by beings of steel that facilitate beyond perception
The dead fall to be recycled below into the cesspool, planetary grave
