The once opulent temple of hierapolis corroding
An impenetrable fortification overseen by the ancient nephilim
Vehement warrior priests tasked with the protection of a vile artifact
A parasitic re animator imprisoned within it's deconsecrated shell now unguarded
An aura of darkness enshrouding the burial chamber


Unholy relic of extirpation obscured
Decades elapse, within the structure it inhabits
Disfigured by time and its malignant presence
Transfiguring vermin into carriers of plague, harbingers of death

Byzantium priests corrupted,
Their eyes transfixed upon the maggot infestation of flesh
Congregating amongst the malodorous chapel
In synchronous invocation, decomposition now begins [2x]
Reanimation
Rites of self immolation to be reanimated as one

The deceased levitate in zero gravity revolving counter-clockwise
Bodily fluids discharge outward, leaking upon the floor
Skeletal structures fracture contort and sever
Extracted and absorbed into being

As the lunar mechanism chimes the final terror
The appalling manifestation of atrophy
Harvests the remains of the dismembered
A perversion of the human form obtained
