Transcendence rooted in truth made fiction,
We witness the Harbingers of revelation,
Crushers and dispellers of sovereignty,
A return foretold by the ancient ones.
Precursors to our own misfortune,
For like them we shall become.

Inferior, incorrect,
They cannot tolerate such existence.
There is an error in our own construction.
They are not the heralds of peace,
Cybernetic beings of subjugation.

Seize the consciousness of our race,
And conjoin us into the collective embrace of their hive mind God machine

Rewrite the flawed code of our ideal sapience.
Strip the design to its basest form.
Conjoin us into the collective embrace

Surgical dismemberment and organ salvaging to convert the populace
Rebuild anew. A society of perfection, zero tolerance
Restructure the blueprints to human DNA
There is no way to tell where flesh begins,
And technology ends.

Void the intellect, and void the will of man.
Obey, receive the code of automation

Delete self awareness
Under the god machine
We are one entity
We are unity

Under the God Machine
We are one being
Under the God Machine
We are unity

Conjoin us into the collective embrace

Inner thoughts being suppressed, voices of torment channel through me
All recollection nullified by internal enslavement

Delete self awareness
Rewrite the flawed code of our ideal sapience.
Strip the design to itâs basest form.
Rebuild anew. A society of perfection, zero tolerance
There is no way to tell where flesh begins,
And technology ends
Under the god machine
Obey, receive the code of automation
