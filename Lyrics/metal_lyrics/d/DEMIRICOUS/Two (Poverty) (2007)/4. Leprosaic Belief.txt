Gather all of your thoughts of god
Give yourself a reason for a shot
At riding the nerves of the washed
Life (or) faith decide
Another violence -- slave to comfort
Dragging through your head until exhaust
Condition that is easily lost
Grinding Pointless Endless
Punish Sufferless
Fuck a martyr Take the time
To know your Enemy
The threat is synthetic
Worldwide chemical imbalance
When someone else's god makes you a target
