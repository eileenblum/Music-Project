Living and dying for no one
Playing god &amp; steering all the bullets
Disregarding vapid is your credit
Never can a leader be believed
Jesus Christ will never be concerned
Bloodless depthless hopeless alive

There is no value - I have no trust
I represent nothing - fuck yourself
There is no common bond
No damage that cannot be done
I have nothing left to feel
Jack off thy public
Dead man no regret
One life all revenge
Engineer
One man all revenge

Another civil war is on our backs
We'll carry out the stresses through our necks
Unknown visuals -- story has no end
Dragging out the lines in the sand
Pointless the supremacy at best
No confession - causing us to die
