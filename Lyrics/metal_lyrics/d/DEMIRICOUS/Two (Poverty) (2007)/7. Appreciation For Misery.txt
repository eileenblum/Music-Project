Bile washing oral drainage skin
These thieves are on the battleground again
Naked is addiction through the nose
Pressures that are lurking w/ the floods
A need to suffer grow the character
Another product of the warning
Embrace intentions of the terror
Condition disorder unstable
Choking down the arteries of breath
Ashes of revenge are on the path
Cavities in cells and nurse the lice
Drowning in insomniatic waves
