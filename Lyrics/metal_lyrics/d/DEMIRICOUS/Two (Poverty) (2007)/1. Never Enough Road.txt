Pure is the stone on the path of this ocean
Treasures are abandoned &amp; the warzones are in welcome
Python eagle man wasted ghost
Torche is in hand the thunder grows

Digesting tip of the sword taking in spit of poison
Gods pigs upon field avalanche of man
Horns fangs are in sight lungs to ear
Never to be tame

Gauntlet on gauntlet the skin whips amok
Bone how it slithers like blade liquid wind
Crimson faces baptismal light
Flawless the damage the flags fly high
Throne &amp; altar hammer of gods
