Violence addled dislocated drunk
Walking on constricted vital signs
Preying on the health of mortal skull
Lurking vision pale hands wrapped in pain

Zombie

Crawling through the ground with endless skill
Hunting earth to numb untranquil brains
Broken lungs &amp; rancid oral steam
Through the bone the medication lays

Burn rot want waste

Pale hostage to death
Endless history
Nobody will ever die
Expression of immunity to god
