Nothing left to fight Nothing left to kill One thing left to fuck
Bitter till I die there's a slaughter that's leaning on time
The spiders in my throat A hole is in my sky
I'm dying to fuck off -- You're pissing in my skull
The last thing that I want is the first thing I need
Septic presence all around me And now you're all a fuckin' target
Vomiting the damaged past Revenge use once and destroy
A fuckin' disease Voice of unreason lives in me
Crushing the pillars of their lungs Life won't wait
Burning the flesh Smashing the face Fucking it all
