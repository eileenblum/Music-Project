Blessed with a broken home and affliction - a bulls eye for prostration.
The upper hand is outta reach and he's starving - this trip may never end.
Live like a human vulture born without his wings - your trash his golden treasure.
Goddamn he's fucking low but in my mind - he's got the upper hand.
Vagrant all-star on a rampage.
Dig deep in the trash can goldmines - comfort found in an asphalt pillow.
Vagrant all-star on a rampage - trooper fully loaded from the gutter .
Life like a human vulture born without his wings - your trash his golden treasure.
Goddamn he's fuckin' low but in my mind - he's got the upper hand.
Vagrant all-star on a rampage.
Born in a burden no time for god one concern to stay alive.
Daily war to find the fix to find the camp to find the will to live in hell and suffer over everyday's necessities.
Armed with purest rational and kevlar skin and shattered ego.
