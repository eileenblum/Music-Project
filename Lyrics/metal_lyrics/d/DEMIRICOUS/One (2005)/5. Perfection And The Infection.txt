Storming the bodily warzone - the masterpiece is toxic.
Scarlet lined veins constricting - blood piss of fire.
Caustic fixations orchestration of decay.
Feeding disposing erosion of the engine.
Vile discharge.
Curse of perfection and (the) infection.
Dusk drunk habits fuse to early closure.
Breathing carcass scars us marks us.
Perfecting misleading infecting.
Strapping and dominating the machine is Godly divine.
Whores and racists depression and wars rapists and suicide.
Volcanic and pressure inside mankind to purify.
We took perfection and grew infection - we're so divine.
Contagious obsessions.
