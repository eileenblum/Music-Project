Assassins unscavenge.
Aesthetic trauma.
Bringer of the rising tide of low-carb soiled suicide.
Naturally unnatural the satisfaction on its knees.
The arsenal of chemicals is riding shotgun underneath.
The setting sun of ashy skin achieving catastrophic dreams.
Deploy the decline.
Feeding vice through abscess.
Death beyond dishonor.
Laying cells to rest.
Find out what it meant to love to death.
Purgatoric beauty.
Putrefactious allies.
Wrinkles rise infesting bliss from toxic means ingest the curse.
A caustic vice that licks the lips it fills the void a parasite.
The cauterized the dialogue it crippled lungs eclipsed a life.
The verdict is a blistered soul that never sleeps and breathes regret.
Eternal withdrawal.
