Trample onto the voyage - travel as forest fire.
Through the wreckage down the spine - facing your utmost obscene.
Inner earthquake running amok as the seasons drip through the skin.
Cold you are - one foot in the coals - the sight demands your sight.
First impressions's paralyzing the sight of one's own soul.
Poisoning depressing mouth with epidemic smile.
The past is present - death ballad setting abortion like tones.
Scabs of your impurities presented for your review.
A nightmare colored vulture falls - It Falls!! - it wraps you in its sleep.
Prosthetic words are spit listen - Listen!! - you are your own worst enemy.
Castrate callous ideas - mercy like no other is the medicine - medicate!!
Your very own civil war right before your eyes - possessed by your own revenge.
Wearing the badge of the asshole.
Misery is unrestrained - nausea exploding - carrion peeling back - Brain is turning inside out.
Pissing Blood - wreaking shit.
So on with the disaster.
