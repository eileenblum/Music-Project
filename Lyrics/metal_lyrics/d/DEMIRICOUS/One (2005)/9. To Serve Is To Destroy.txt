Pissing Blood, a fractured pledge, enter vein - this warzone.
Conviction folding and derail.
Dying proof is revving up - rifled fangs are sinking, down.
Snorting toward supremacy.
Endure.
To serve satisfaction.
(is to) Destroy perseverance.
Behind the wheel of compulsive bullets.
Burn in the wake of the oblivion.
Digging for the whiskey fix - bitter and acidic itch.
Chemicals - the cells of misery.
Dissecting dependency - wasted - the relentless seeds.
Opening the ulceration.
