Heed these hands
Born from sands
Pray for stone wings
To ease the heaving pain
Of your burden
Wait for the fall of time
Wait for the fall of time

Dust to flesh
Flesh to stone
Fly the embers of your name

Feed the sands to the grave
Thirst the bones of your slave
All I own
All I've known
In the hands of this stone

Craft these limbs
Of dust to skin
The silent terms
The bonds of your bloodied
War have begun
Wait for the fall of time
Wait for the fall of time

Turn your back and walk forever
Lest we be cast in stone together
