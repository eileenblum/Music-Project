A freezing fog on distance shores
A story lost in ancient lore
Now words of gods from mouths of men
Speak the truth to the great condemned

If I dare to step beyond
Stray from the path beneath my feet
To reach into the great unknown

So let me go, to dream again
Unholy truth, unholy pain
Open my eyes, I reach again
Beyond the grey veil

Deep in the cold origins of birth
The curtain falls on freezing earth
Grasp the thorn of freedom's sin
For at last the night comes rolling in

Leave me now she says to me
And cover all my dreams in black
For all is lost in earthly fire
