Come up from your crosses
And graves filled with dust
The clouds of your losses
Will darken the path that guides your soul

Years arrive and pass it seems
In a breath of sorrow
But the wheel of time will never cease
So we roam in the shadow of a dream

Time takes the world from under me
The sands beneath my feet
Are falling fast
Trapped in the hourglass

Weave sinews to your weary tread
The shallow of your twisted soul
Will never stop the spinning thread
Time to shake the twilight into flaks of fire
