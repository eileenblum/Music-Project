A line that can't be broken
Of the duty bound unspoken
Wielding hammers to the sky
For the greater good they die

The world is weary of the past
Might it die or rest at last
Yet the iron and flame of empires
Thunder on the shore

Light a candle for the dead
And the wounded hearts that bled
Echo songs gods and men
Raise a glass to seasons end

We bear the fate of our fathers
Spectres of the dead hours
So he crept from tomb to grave
Traveller of endless day

Fragments of the seasons fell
Across the oceans vast and cold
So we rise and fall
With the tides of the earth
