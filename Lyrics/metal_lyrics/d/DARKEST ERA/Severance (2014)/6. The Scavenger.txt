Falling deeper towards where no hope can escape
From the heart of the darkness
Piercing eye searching for just a glimpse of your fire
In this winter of madness

The silence is broken
All that remains in decay
The scavenger has come
The scavenger has come

Hear the voices of sacrificed souls on the winds
The words of the damned
At the end of all things is the place I shall wander
With the ghosts of the earth

The pieces of life, that lay shattered and broken
And tear through the flesh
In doorways of time I am longing forever
For my nightmare to stay
