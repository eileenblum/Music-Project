From across the stormy seas to godless lands
I sought for answers
Roaming through the bitter wilderness
On the winds of vengeance

Blood on my hands
The tyrant of man
Dragging further from the light

Blood on my hands
They call to me
A thousand screaming souls in the deep

By the dying light of day I turn away
From your towers of splendour
And the dregs of life stare back at me
From the darkness

The fearless might of the untamed
That rips the skies apart
And the vast emptiness
Is all that remains for me
