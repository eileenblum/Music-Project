On the crest of the night
Alone in the silence around me
Where the ravens that roam through the eyes of the storm
Circle above their prey

The beggars that mourn are
Sleeping through breaking of day
Caress every thought with the peace that you bought
Praying in silent scorn

Blood for blood
Soul for soul

The scream of death the pyre burning bright
The serpent and the shadow of the black light

The demons that crawl
The fury of nightmares unknown
From their severed tongues come the words of their songs
Poison the gods of old
