Into the darkness
Of the wild we wandered
The cruelty of your poison
Shook the weakness from your stride
And the wolves were drawing near
Ghost of grey by your side

Boundless realm of sorrow
Boundless realm of sorrow

You took your madness
And the terror bounding
Like a creature of aching soul
Through your veins to howl and die
There is evil in the beast
And a yearning heart in me

Boundless realm of sorrow
Boundless realm of sorrow

I have lain too long
In this pit of misery
While you writhe on your back
In loathing

Into the wild we wandered
Ghosts of grey by your side
