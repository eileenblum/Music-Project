A somber sky above your head
A lonely path below
And hand on heart I cannot see
The light to guide me home
And so it is the end of our days
So walk with me till morning breaks
And so it is the end of our days
So walk with me till morning breaks

We travel down this trodden path
A maze of stone and mire
Just hold my hand as we pass by
A sea of blazing pyres
And so it is the end of our days
So walk with me till morning breaks
And so it is the end of our days
So walk with me till morning breaks

A somber sky above your head
A lonely path below
And hand on heart I cannot see
The light to guide me home
So sing me songs of love and war
Songs of hope and pain
For we are lost within a dream
Unyeilding once again
And so it is the end of our days
So walk with me till morning breaks
And so it is the end of our days
So walk with me till morning breaks

We travel down this trodden path
A maze of stone and mire
Just hold my hand as we pass by
A sea of blazing pyres
And every thought and every word
That's ever come to me
Has fallen to the great beyond 
With hope and memory
And so it is the end of our days
So walk with me till morning breaks
And so it is the end of our days
So walk with me till morning breaks

Aaaaaa.....
