Goddess of war, serpent of doom Destroying all who encounter you But there is one who you won't kill There is one whose blood won't spill  Seeker of souls, taker of heads I watch you conjure war emong men I will strike each form you take Till you return to me and steal my fate  For one last glory I will prevail The Morrigan she calls out my name  Guarding the borders of my homeland I slay the warriors of Cruachan With bravery and battle rage I kill them all in my domain  She appears to me before my eyes Baying for blood in each disguise Tell me now, how does it end? Whisper to me, prophetess of death  A maiden wept as I came to the ford With bloodied shield and broken sword I could see they were my own She stood lamenting this fallen soul  She disappeared from my sight I knew I would not return from this fight A black crow waits before I die As I depart, she'll watch my spirit fly
