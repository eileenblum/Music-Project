The tides are turning, the mists of war descendTo break the cage of sorrow's spellRelinquish all that you perceive to be trueAnd place your trust only to within I am the serpent's severed tongueI am the venom that lies withinThe darkest skies, the falling rainI am the Tyrant, hear my name One the mountains edge above ungodly earthRaise your blade and proclaim to the skies"Let the winds whip like chains across my backAnd bring the thunder crashing down upon me" No tempest will ever take meFor I have stood on the crest of doomI turn my face towards the marching hordeAnd brace myself for the coming storm The crimson curtain has fallen on our timeSo we must bow before the worldAnd you will linger with the corpse of the earthFor on this field of war, a storm shall rise
