Worn and weary is the soul, torn and frayed the mindThis present day so far away from what I left behindThe shadows that have followed me plague my memoriesNow that I am watching and waiting for you Quenched my thirst upon your tearsDrowned my sorrows in your bloodNever rest till my journey is doneThe wind shall carry me now Another world awaits meAnother time, another place to be Silent as the sunset that warms the pale grey skyShe moves among the shadows as day fades into nightWith every passing hour my strength begins to fail meTime holds its breath for me no more I hear your voice on the cold windI hear your cry in the barren landsThough it pains me, when the visions come to meI dream of all that once was Another world awaits meAnother time, another place to beAnother world awaits meAnother time, when I can stand alone
