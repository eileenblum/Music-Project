[Part I - Love]

Lips like roses touch my neck
I'm flowing in lakes of her eyes

On snowed white cheek tear like diamond
Falling from grace
I feel love burning my heart
I'm ready for her

When blood starts to boiled
Stars fall from skies like flowers
In cosmic endless cry
Like blade, piercing through my chill heart
But love so burns, like flames of eternity
Salvation of light, touch my neck
On skin I feel her touch of roses like lips

(I) Don't feel the pain
In divine pleasure I drown...
In lakes of her eyes
Like stone throw by lone spirit

Which cry for her beloved fate
Rest in peace
From which I call you through time and death
My only love, my life
My life...

Lips like roses touch my neck
I'm flowing in lakes of her eyes
On snowed white cheek tear like diamond
Falling from grace
I feel love burning my heart
I'm ready for her
On evergreen fields I fly
To mountains cold, as heart that died
On peaks my burning body freezes
In chill that pierce my heart I breathe...

[Part II - Landscape]

From the stars that shining bright
From the mountains cold and high
From the depths of endless hate
To the sorrow, grimness and pain
Spooky woman talks to stones
Headless creatures without bones
Trembling ground, grain of sand
Bleak headstones marks the end

Spears of lightning piercing my brain
Dance of warlock calling rain
Falling stars from skies on earth
Mighty anger calling death
Twilight of the man at hand
Angels crying fire tears
Hungry before Christ is born
One who makes dreams gloom
Memories skulking between trees
Heartless Old-One under sea
From beneath to gather minds of
Minions of His genocide
Let us know the mystery
Of the blood and memories
Of the ancient tribe of Kain
Of the mortal sin and dying

Many brothers drown in blood
Wars and plagues - servants of doom...

On this land oblivion falls
Do they live forever?

Through time and death?

Through time and death...
