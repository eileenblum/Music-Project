Eternal loneliness...

A thorn in my heart...

A drop of blood...

I caught it before it fall...

Somehow I could not realize
My memories steps away from desert storms to sea waves
I drink life, from my sanity
From trees I've never seen
Whispering creeks between green...

From dark dreams I try to wake up
Buried under burden of blame and disgrace
Painting my nightmares with colors of faith
To never dream, to never wake up...

In emptiness of life...

Here is my sacrifice
I'll give you all...
Immortal deceiver
To be unstopped,
To be unseen
To never see
Your twisted dreams!!!

Be your Jester in depravity, wide smiling in insanity [x2]

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.....

From dark dreams I'm trying to wake up
Buried under burden of blame and disgrace
Painting my nightmares with colors of faith
To never dream, to never wake up...
