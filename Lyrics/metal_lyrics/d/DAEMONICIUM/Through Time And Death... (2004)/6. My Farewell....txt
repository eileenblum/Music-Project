To see this land where she has gone
To never feel again alone
Eternal darkness embracing my soul
In cosmic endless cry

I walk the Milk Road where she has left me
My heart is weeping but eyes remains dry
And stirring blindly on endless road
On life spilled blood to silence my cry

I'm creeping through the gloom of mind
My footsteps seeing by the eyes of Blind
Awake but asleep forever
To dream eternal, love together
Life is freezing in this madness
Colors flying kills my sadness
As He dwell in depths of ocean
Putting life in blurred motion

Awake but asleep forever
Is this my life or tomb eternal
I see her kissing me farewell
I see her eyes in flash of scythe

Now I'll be gone from this mortal world
It cannot give me nothing but pain and blood
I don't want to hear how my heart is crying
To never see my beloved dying
Star-Dweller I'm coming to reach your realms
I fought with you but now I'm your prey

Now I'll be gone from this mortal world
It gives me only pain!

I feel empty I feel blind
Cold as the stone is my heart
But bleeding every night without you
And slowly falling into cold darkness
This is the end I can't take any more
I'm leaving now this empty shore
To meet the Old - One, to reach the stars
To free my soul and to soothe my heart!

Eternal darkness embracing my soul...

I am leaving now!!!

To meet the Old - One, to reach the stars
To free my soul and to soothe my heart...

I am leaving now...
I cannot hold out my immortality...!
