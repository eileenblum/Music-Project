In my eyes I know I've failed her
I'm not the person that everyone thinks (I am)
Over my shoulder she will linger
Witness my sins but she never blinks
I know I don't deserve her
But still she watches with disgust on her face
When will I come to my senses
So she will never have to be disgraced because of me again

I know that everyone must certainly have one
Another person, a bad side to their life
For reasons known I cannot explain
I should go down by the blade of her knife

I know I don't deserve her
Of all the sins and wrong that I must confess
Done without bad intentions
Of ever hurting anyone this is something that I must (stress)
Please forgive me

Now that I have told you all about this
Please forgive me
Who do I ask for this absolution?

My fingers sliding down your face
I wipe the tears of my disgrace (from you)
You show no fear to take some blame
Would it, could it ever be the same

Of won't you please just tell me...?
Please forgive me
Now that I have told you all about this
Please forgive me
Who do I ask for this absolution?

Please forgive me
Now that I have told you all about this
Please forgive me
Who do I ask for this absolution?
