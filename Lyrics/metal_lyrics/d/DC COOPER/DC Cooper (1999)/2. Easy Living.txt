[originally by Uriah Heep]

This is a thing I've never known before
It's called easy livin'
This is a place I've never seen before
And I've been forgiven

Easy livin'
And I've been forgiven
Since you've taken your place
In my heart

Somewhere along the lonely road
I had tried to find ya
Day after day on that windly road
I had walked behind ya

Easy livin'
And I've been forgiven
Since you've taken your place
In my heart

Waitin', watchin', wishin' my whole life away
Dreamin', thinkin', ready for my happy day
And some easy livin'

Somewhere along the lonely road
I had tried to find you
Day after day on that windy road
I had walked behind you

Easy livin'
And I've been forgiven
Since you've taken your place
In my heart
