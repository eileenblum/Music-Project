Travelled from the home so far
For a price of everything he has
A man said he would take them
beyond your faith not saying
Promise of some hope and dreams
Never saying that your life will be at stake
(Freedom) Where is their home?
(Freedom) Never finding it's embrace
Not a country or a place
(Freedom) Where is their home?
(Freedom) Never finding it's embrace (embrace)
Such a desperate face
Shots heard from the ridge upon the hill
Take them to a place where you can hide
Take you child and run now

But no promise of a means to help survive
Offers of hope asylum they provide

(Freedom) Where is their home?
Not a country or a place

(Freedom) Where is their home?
(Freedom) Never finding it's embrace
Such a desperate face
(Freedom) Never finding it's embrace
When can a person who is sleeping in the streets
Take back a part of their life from a time when they were complete
(Freedom) Where is their home?
Not a country or a place

(Freedom) Where is their home?
(Freedom) Never finding it's embrace
Such a desperate face
(Freedom) where is their home?
(Freedom) Never finding it's embrace

(Freedom) Never finding it's embrace
Not a country or a place
(Freedom) where is their home?
Such a desperate face
(Freedom) Never finding it's embrace
