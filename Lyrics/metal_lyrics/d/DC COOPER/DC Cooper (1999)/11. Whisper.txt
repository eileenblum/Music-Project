Feeling in my bones
As a chill is running down my spine
Is it when I asked you: are you the divine?
Said what I had to say
Did what I had to do waiting for a sign
As she dances among us
With a feel that's known to trust

Whisper in my ear that you will stay
(Whisper in my ear that you will stay)
Asking please, oh please whisper this way

Tired of waking up
Over and over again
The lines on my face were so deep and in disgrace
I sit in a corner room, awaiting for you to help
The thoughts were clear before

As she dances among us
With a feel that's known to trust

Whisper in my ear that you will stay
(Whisper in my ear that you will stay)
Asking please, oh please whisper this way

The father, Son, and Holy Ghost
They shall remain
Can you tell me? Will you tell me?
You'll whisper this way
