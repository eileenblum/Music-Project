The time that the dreaming had started
No patience to fall in a deep sleep
Vision's coming through strong
Found something was wrong
Please give me a key to a door
And worry no more
Of me when I die and leave here
If the dream will blind you, will remind you
A dream reminds you, always shines through

Shows the light that took me from my fears
On the days when I'm hating my life
I'll never know why
It seems there's too much to remember
Leading me to my final goodbye

My tongue rids me of the truth

That no one will know
If the dream will blind you, will remind you

A dream reminds you, always shines through
Of me when I die and leave here
Shows the light that took me from my fears
That I'm standing in a place
I open my eyes to find
On my final resting place
And I'm looking down...

A hand that touches my face
Wipes away my tears
If the dream will blind you, always blinds you

Of me when I die and leave here
A dream reminds you, always shines through

If the dream will blind you, will remind you
Of me when I die and leave here
Shows the light that took me from my fears
A dream reminds you, always shines through
Shows the light that took me from my fears
