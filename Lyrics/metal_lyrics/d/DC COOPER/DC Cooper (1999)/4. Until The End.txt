Off into the room
He sees her all around
Surprised him that she sat right down
Was not to be replaced
The smile upon her face
Has to last him all his life
Deep inside is where she'll find
Until the end, oh until the...
The only heart that's on his mind

The only heart that's on his mind
Deep inside is where she'll find
Until the end, oh until the end
Everything they shared

Took advantage of the time
As if it was a dream
They ran into a wall
Setting themselves up
Enjoyed it all before the fall

Deep inside is where she'll find
The only heart that's on his mind

Until the end, oh until the end
The only heart that's on his mind
Deep inside is where she'll find
Until the end, oh until the end

For each other, they shall pray
Every single day

And what their life's like now
They wonder where they are
Hoping there is a time
Knowing that it went to far
When they will meet again together (together, together...)
Always 'til the end

The only heart that's on his mind
Until the end, oh until the end
Deep inside is where she'll find

Deep inside is where she'll find
The only heart that's on his mind
Until the end, oh until the end
