Just before the fall...
You see me run to a place that's facing hope again
To change the way I feel...
The way I feel

The story that must show the way...
Missing line's not there to tell

I was wrong, so wrong
I realize there is no way to return
A fantasy that opens to the world...
Of the union

Ever before, never again turn on you
Even the wait, if it is great comes with truth
Why must time be for so long?

Ever before, never again turn on you
Time not forgotten
Can it be regained?
With no restrictions

Is there a place where they can hide?
Could it be the same as before?
The journey now begins inside
It comes with no guarantee
Believing in the fantasy

Fear the resentment of what it is they'll say
Risking so many, what a price to pay like before
The journey now begins with pride
Is there a place where we can hide?
It comes with no guarantee
The union of the fantasy

Even the wait, if it is great comes with truth
Ever before, never again turn on you
Ever before, never again turn on you
Why must time be for so long?

Together, forever that is all that we should feel
The union of us two will be the one dream that is real
We should go anywhere to live in the love of life
Fueled by the memories of a thousand lonely nights
Ever before, never again turn on you

Even the wait, if it is great comes with truth
Why must time be for so long?

Ever before, never again turn on you
Even the wait, if it is great comes with truth
Why must time be for so long?
Ever before, never again turn on you
Ever before, never again turn on you
