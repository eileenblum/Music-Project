Do you think one can walk away from there?
Using their energy and all that they can spare
The more that they wait the better, the chance that they will lose
Arrange ideas in order that you'll use them
Have the power, take control
Within yourself, within yourself, within yourself
In your own mind live within yourself
It takes some time for destiny to show it's face

Reality it seems will never take it's place
Whatever is done can always work out in the end
But maybe there's no way to make ammends

In your own mind live within yourself
Within yourself, within yourself, within yourself

Have the power, take control
The minutes and seconds of all that was late
The crossing of lives small brushes with fate

Using your energy that's keeping you in fear
Do you think you can walk away from here?
There are no excuses and no one is to shame
The one in the mirror is the one who's to blame
In your own mind, in your soul

Have the power, take control
Within yourself, within yourself, within yourself
Have the power, take control
In your own mind live within yourself
Within yourself, within yourself, within yourself...
