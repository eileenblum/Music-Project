What an evil look
Of your existence
That showed your true side
And all the bad things you hide
Simple distracion
The way you bring us down (down, down...)
Because you like us
Always will invite us
To wear the exact same frown
Why is it like this? (Why is it like this?)

No pleasure is allowed
The angel comes and shows her face
Why do you like it? (Why do you like it?)
You like this pain that makes you proud

The angel comes and shows her face
And puns you in your righteous place
And puns you in your righteous place
What happened in your life

That made you feel so cold
Lies from the past come forth
And never take a hold

The need to breathe
Never before this have I felt
The time has come now
The choice is made you know

I have to leave
Why is it like this? (Why is it like this?)
No pleasure all despair
Why do you like it (Why do you like it?)
This is the pain you think is fair

The angel comes and shows her face
And puns you in your righteous place
And puns you in your righteous place
The angel comes and shows her face

About the time the dreaming had stopped
That's when I fear that you're gone

That's when I feel...
The angel comes and shows her face
And puns you in your righteous place
And puns you in your righteous place
The angel comes and shows her face

And puns you in your righteous place
The angel comes and shows her face
The angel comes and shows the way

And puns you in your righteous place
That's when I fear that you are gone
About the time the dreaming had stopped
Never before this have I felt, never before...
