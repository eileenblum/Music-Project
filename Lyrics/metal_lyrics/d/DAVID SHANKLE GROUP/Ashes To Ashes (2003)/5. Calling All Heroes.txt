In the days of old
Stars disappear, nights are growing cold

Oh, heroes of our schemes
Reaching out to someone, someone of their dreams

When the lighting strikes
When the children sigh
When the magic dies
Calling all heroes
When the voice decays
When the death remains
When the music fades
Calling all heroes

In these days of old
Heroes appear, fantasy unfolds
Stories untold
Voices of the heart, magic of the soul

Oh, heroes of our schemes
Reaching out to someone, someone of their dreams

When the lighting strikes
When the children sigh
When the magic dies
Calling all heroes
When the voice decays
When the death remains
When the music fades
Calling all heroes

It's calling out to me
Fantasy or reality, love can never be
Oh, solidarity
Deny the cheap insanity, you're reaching out to me

When the lighting strikes
When the children sigh
When the magic dies
Calling all heroes
When the voice decays
When the death remains
When the music fades
Calling all heroes
