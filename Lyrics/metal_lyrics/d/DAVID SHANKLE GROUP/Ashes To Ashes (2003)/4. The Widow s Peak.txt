You involve us in actions that are not our concern
Repeating the history - you just never learn
No thought to the families, no thought to their fate
Playing the war games against those you hate

How dare you place the blame at the widow's peak?
Faceless apologies for the words that you speak
False atonement with the tears that you weep
At the height of the widow's peak

Designing the costumes in war widow black
And practicing feelings, those you lack
With delusions of grandeur-illusions of fame
Your pointing the fingers and leave out your name
It's not your son who's sent to die
Proving a point with omissions and lies

How dare you place the blame at the widow's peak?
Faceless apologies for the words that you speak
False atonement with the tears that you weep
At the height of the widow's peak

You justify actions with plans to attack
Concealing intentions and twisting the facts
Magnanimous promises take the extreme
Praise be to you, praise be your needs

How dare you place the blame at the widow's peak?
Faceless apologies for the words that you speak
False atonement with the tears that you weep
At the height of the widow's peak
At the widow's peak
