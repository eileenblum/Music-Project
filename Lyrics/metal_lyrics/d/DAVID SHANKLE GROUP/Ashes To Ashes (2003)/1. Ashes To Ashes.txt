There she walks, touching your soul like holy fire
Heaven knows, heartache to your ears, madness disappears
She's kissing the flame of desire
Yesterday's pain, illusions are on fire

Lightning strikes when she walks by
Ashes to ashes
Lust to lust, dust to dust

Tears she cries, touching your heart like holy water
When she sighs, magic to your ears, madness disappears
She's fanning the flame of her desire
Yesterday's pain, illusions are on fire

Lightning strikes when she walks by
Ashes to ashes
Lust to lust, dust to dust

The way she cries, grabbing your soul with blind ambition
Nothing remains but her illusion

Lightning strikes when she walks by
Ashes to ashes
Lust to lust, dust to dust
Lightning strikes when she walks by
Ashes to ashes
Lust to lust, dust to dust
