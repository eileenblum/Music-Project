In these days of confusion, in these nights of strife
The past comes back to haunt you
In this kingdom of madness, you fight for your life
Tempestuous storms of deja vu

Silver and gold, souls bought and sold
Curse of the Pharaoh
Sky full of dreams, a fortune in schemes
Curse of the Pharaoh

Beware of the prophets with self-serving rules
They are not your saviors
The modern-day hero becomes yesterday's fool
And this you must remember

Blood in the sand, toil through the land
Curse of the Pharaoh
Chains rattle on, a new Babylon
Curse of the Pharaoh

You suffer the sinner, forsake the lost
May the strong survive
You cast out the demons whatever the cost
Keep the dream alive

Silver and gold, souls bought and sold
Curse of the Pharaoh
Sky full of dreams, a fortune in schemes
Curse of the Pharaoh
Blood in the sand, toil through the land
Curse of the Pharaoh
Chains rattle on, a new Babylon
Curse of the Pharaoh

The chains rattle on
In this new Babylon
