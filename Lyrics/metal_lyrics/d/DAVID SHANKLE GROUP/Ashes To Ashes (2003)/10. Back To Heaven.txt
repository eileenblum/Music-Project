Experience of lifetime, lessons of our past
The mist of total knowledge lifted now at last
A universal college, we learn from our mistakes
Achieving understanding, achieving grace

The legions of fate warn when it's time to move on
The march of the saints teach us one by one

A new inventory, a fresh shot at glory
Then it's back to heaven
A new range of feeling, a ripe time for bleeding
Then it's back to heaven

Each try gives us courage, each try gives us strength
Each try tests the borders of our growing faith
Lives of observation, choices are retraced
Achieving the wisdom, achieving grace

The beacons at night signal the right time to go
The guardians of light rearrange your soul

A new chance for freedom, a dream to believe in
Then it's back to heaven
A new time for learning, a fresh heart for burning
Then it's back to heaven

The legions of fate warn when it's time to move on
The march of the saints teach us one by one

A new inventory, a fresh shot at glory
Then it's back to heaven
A new range of feeling, a ripe time for bleeding
Then it's back to heaven
A new time for learning then it's heaven
It's back to heaven
