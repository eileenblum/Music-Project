I've seen your face before somewhere in my dreams
Years and tears cannot erase
I know the time is right, fate has intervened
Lonely souls can now embrace

Somehow I sense you still remember
Somehow I feel that you still care

Steeped in the mystery
Secrets of you

I've played your heart before, hidden by the past
Memories returning strong
Magic of deja vu justified at last
Destiny can't hold out for long

Somehow I sense you feel the yearning
Somehow I feel that you still care

Steeped in the mystery
Secrets of you
Uncharted history
Secrets of you

I know the time is right, fate has intervened
Lonely souls can now embrace

Somehow I sense you still remember
Somehow I feel that you still care

Steeped in the mystery
Secrets of you
Uncharted history
Secrets of you
