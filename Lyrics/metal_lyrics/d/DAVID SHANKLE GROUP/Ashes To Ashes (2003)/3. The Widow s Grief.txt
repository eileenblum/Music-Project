A woman sits and cries for her loss
Counting the tears, estimating the cost
She's blaming herself for letting him go
Instead of defending the rights of her home
Now her grief cuts deep like a knife,
A knife made of guilt, and the loss of a life

A woman sits and dies more each day
Little by little life slipping away
Wishing it soon will be her time to die
Lying in peace with him by her side
Not a thanks for the price they have paid
A family lost with so little to say
The widow's grief
