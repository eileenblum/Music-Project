Silently still, the wrath of ubiquitous gods
Sanity wills, the manmade destruction to come
Is it the full moon that summons the madness to grow
Stealing the heart from mankind?
Are the heroes and saints, the souls who create
Fated to run out of time?

With destiny calling it's moonshine
With empires tumbling it's...

Moonshine and madness
Headlines leading to sadness

Madness gone wild, destruction now rains from the sky
Pity the child, tears flooding millions of eyes
Will this new wave of madness be nurtured or slain?
What will we favor to preach?
Will the lessons of old grow toxic with mold
Poisoning all within reach?

With empires tumbling it's headlines
With destiny calling it's moonshine
When towers go crumbling it's...

Will this new wave of terror find converts or foes?
