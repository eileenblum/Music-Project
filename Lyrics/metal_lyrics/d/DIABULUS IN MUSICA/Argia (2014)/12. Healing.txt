Taber est quisque fotunae suae
aut viam inveniam aut faciam

Etrkizunagurea da bakarrik
Guk eraikiko dugu ibilbidea

We should not look back, but just accept the past
All was just the path to where we are
We know that it means to fall and pick ourselves up
No more strives to lose, it's no more our war

Now together we fly stronger and proud, rise and see what we have become
No more treasons to bear, all masks were unveiled and today our thrills still grow

Leading our path, head up high
With courage and passion, just you and I
Joy fills the clouds where muses roam
And smile while they hear our song

We should not look back, but just accept the past
All was just the path to where we are
You know what it means to stand alone for so long
Now we share our fight, my dream is yours

Del mio cor laspre catene dure sono infrante
E le rigide mie pene che parevano infinite son finite
Oh pace, pace
