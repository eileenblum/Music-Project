A new autumn calls and old leaves must fall
A new star will shine for a blossom to bloom
Whispering your life made me understand
This world is a stage, but it isn't the end
Cause I could clearly feel your soul
Fly away towards the warm sun
As light as a feather went fast through the wind
No farewell cause you'd be here

In memories its your voice that still sings
Wise old melodies come to me every time I need to have you close

Tired of life's path, years soon dragged on
Now that you've arrived to the shore a new light glows

And in peace your long journey end
Like an angel you'll never fade
Watching over us, you safeguard our paths
And timeless you'll last within

Yes I can clearly feel your soul
It flies away towards the warm sun
As light as a feather goes fast through the wind
No farewell cause you are here
