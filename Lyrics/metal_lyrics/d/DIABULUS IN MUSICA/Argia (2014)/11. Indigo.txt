Now its time to tell you a long forgotten story
Its about an unusual being
He came in a winter silent night
He was from the distant land of nowhere

He only knew the stones of his lonely universe
They were so cold and hard for his longing thirst for love

He was born from a storm under a bright night sun
His aim was to search for warmth
He came to Earth and suddenly he learnt
That war was our daily bread

Was your heart a perfect rose in the garden of my dreams
But in shadows you were concealed and remade into nust
