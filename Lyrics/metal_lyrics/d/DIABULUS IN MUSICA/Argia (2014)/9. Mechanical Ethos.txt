Ready to roll downhill again in this funny wheel
And get submerged in this idyllic game where there's no need to think
No strategic plays, just follow their rhythm
Let yourself get lost in others' dreams

Proud of our consciousness, a treasure inside that they cannot destroy
Our minds being poisoned, injected by lies, human cores violated

A realm where our hands are tied
But our minds still stay free
Don't believe what we are shown
We are under control

Ready to let your creed be settled, well organized
The guarantee of the correct life pattern that everyone should live
A superficial radiance, a shallow success
Carton puppets hang by golden threads
