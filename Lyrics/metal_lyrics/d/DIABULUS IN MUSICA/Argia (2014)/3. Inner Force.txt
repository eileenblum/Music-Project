Search your inner strength, find the self within
Explore your consciousness, set out on your quest

Here I come through space and time
Born from your nightmares
But modeled by the energy of life

You can decipher
From night I rise
An improved version
Of everything you didnât dare to start

Donât you recognize your eyes in mine?
If you only looked up in the sky
You would be able to see
The sun rises always near
Every morning shines and waits for you to live

Search your inner strength, find the self within
Explore your consciousness, set out on your quest

Iâm an illusion
Maybe not real
Just a reflection
Of inner fears that drowned your beliefs

Donât you recognize your eyes in mine?
If you only looked up in the sky
You would be able to see
The sun rises always near
Every morning shines and waits for you to live

You had fed your perfect hell, have built your fears, have set your downfall

Donât you recognize...

You have fed your perfect hell, have built your fears; have set your downfall
Seek deep in your soul and you will find the true self that lies within you. Deep down inside.
