A presence in my winding road
That relieved my deep anguish
A sparkling shine lightning my life
A new reason to smile

I feel I'm not alone
To restart my way (and keep walking)
We could build a smoother path

You'd better go back
The child entered my realm
He doesn't deserve anymore
The fury of your enemies
Leave, your egotism
He'll stay here

You are lost in my dark maze
You are misplaced, go and find your nest
He'll stay here
Your struggle comes to an end

You are lost in my dark maze
You are misplaced, go and find your nest
He'll stay here
Your struggle comes to an end

I will not leave him to his own

When I entered his small world
And perceived for once innocence
I rediscovered what hope was
So fragile in my hands

I feel I'm not alone
To restart my way (and keep walking)
We could build a smoother path

My time has come
Don't try to fight against fate
Your last change
You want the world
I'll give your mine, come...

Go away, leave the child
Your secret is not safe
He wants you. That's a trick
Leave the child. Go away alone
You aren't one of them
Your secret will be unleashed
Leave the child. Go alone
You know you aren't welcome here

Cannot choose a way
You left me with no key
I won't leave him here
Mine could be your realm

I will not leave him to his own

Maybe in the past I gave up my aims
That's why I won't lose this game now

I feel I'm not alone
To restart my way (and keep walking)
We could build a smoother path
Together we'll build a smoother path

Sit vis vobiscum
