Through the darkness I can see
Faded stars are showing me
All the tracks I should follow

In the coldness of this night
It feels so warm
It feels so calm
I feel I'm out of danger

No more inflicted wounds
This new dawn might the last my refuge

All in my hands
Freedom flows through my veins
Hope it won't fade
Never again

Life in my hands
Now there's no one to blame
The beams of fate
Light my path again

No more looks of disdain
To reach this time my new lair
Now I'm far from compassion

Through the distance my sight
Crosses the barriers of time
My eyes keep gazing the sky
They can recall the shore
But forgot lands on the other side

All in my hands
Freedom flows through my veins
Hope it won't fade
Never again

Life in my hands
Now there's no one to blame
The beams of fate
Light my path again

There's no need to hide again
Need your cloak of green I am safe (fear's going away)

There's no need to be ashamed
There is no need to be afraid
I can be myself

Ubi bene, ibi patria

All in my hands
Freedom flows through my veins
Hope it won't fade
Never again

Life in my hands
Now there's no one to blame
The beams of fate
Light my path again
