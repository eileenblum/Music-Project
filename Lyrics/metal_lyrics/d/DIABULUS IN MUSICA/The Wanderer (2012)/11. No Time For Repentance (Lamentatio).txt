Time has come
There's no hope
You lost your chance
You didn't take the moral in her words
One reaps what one has sown.
Yes. It's our turn. It's the norm
One reaps what one has sown

Ravens come, they bring winds of death
There's no time for repentance, it's your end

One reaps what one has sown
That's the norm

Is there any warmth beneath your skin?
A human trace might remain inside your chest...

Excidium hic est finis
Hic et nunc est finis

Your destiny can't be avoided
That's your fate and you wonder why
Why are you bearing now this nightmare?
Your blunders, your end
The karma's force
Now rules your world
The second coming comes to grief
Since you insist on ignoring

One reaps what one has sown

Time has come
There's no hope
You lost your chance
You didn't take the moral in her words
Yes, it's our turn, it's the norm

Ravens come, they bring winds of death
There's no time for repentance, it's your end
Is there any warmth beneath your skin?
A human trace might remain inside your chest...

Per quai peccai quis, per haec et torquetur
Excidium hic est finis
hic et nunc est finis
[Once the wayfarer recovered hope innocence.
She fond herself alone again. Facing destruction.
In the meanwhile, the damned souls fly and they'll keep flying in the
void, until they realize the meaning of their existence, your existence.]

Your destiny can't be avoided
That's your fate and you wonder why
Why are you bearing now this nightmare?

Your destiny can't be avoided
That's your fate and you wonder why
Why are you bearing now this nightmare?
