Memories from the distance calling me
Tonight I'll meet my roots
Our spirits are soaring through the fog
They won't forsake me again
They won't leave me alone in my pain

Painful days of sorrow will draw in the past
My night will turn into a bright day
I'm prepared for whatever the future brings me
As long as my secret is safe

There's no peace I can go to hide from dark thoughts
I try to escape from the perception of my soul, my decay

Falling down a cesspit of hatred and lies
A wild vision torturing my mind
Awakes my soul which I am feeling now stronger
Prepared for the eternal fight

Fighting against themselves
Are the echoes of my inner voices
I cannot stop them
They start crying while I'm becoming the silence
Among the shouts of the crowd

There's no place I can go to hide from dark thoughts
I try to escape from the perception of my soul, my decay

You know they won't understand
They'll never see who you are
They see the dark in the light
You are the unveiled secret

They don't want to see beyond
You are a threat, you're like a ghost
A mystery, a silent word
You are the unveiled secret
Unveiled secret, unveil yourself!

Quis es?

Quis es?

Quis es?

I meant to shadow myself
Cannot deny what I am
Concealing my uniqueness
Always and forever

There's no place I can go to hide from dark thoughts
I try to escape from the perception of my soul

Unveiled secret, unveiled being, unveil yourself, now!
