Come close your eyes and let me see,
I'm in your dreams, I'm here
Coming from death to bring you life
To stand your ground, I'm real

I don't wanna let you go,
There's a hole in my soul, since you were gone

My heart's for the one who brings me the sun
When I'm so afraid to get lost in the dark, the dark

Don't kill yourself with loneliness, no need to mown again
So this is not the end, wind keeps it's breath, I'm still on earth

My heart's for the one who brings me the sun
When I'm so afraid to get lost in the dark
My heart's for the one who brings me to light
To kill the black shadows that darkened the path

My heart's for the one who brings me the sun
When I'm so afraid to get lost in the dark
My heart's for the one who brings me to light
To kill the black shadows that darkened the path, the path
