I'm the dark in the night when you're scared,
I am the fire when something needs to be burnt.
I've got the power, your lives are insignificant.
And when I dry out her life, nobody's going to stop me.
I want her blood...

For me, I said
Fiat volontas tua
For me, I said
Fiat voluntas tua

Die or join me, still you think the choice is yours,
Your life is my time, and my time will last forever
I want her blood...

For me, I said
Fiat voluntas tua
For me, I said
Fiat voluntas tua

I curse you!
I've seen your future! You're soon gonna die!

Shut up! Put him on the floor! I want his dead, right! Now!

No matter where she is,
No matter what I have to do,
I'll find her, and her blood will be mine.
(Use the child...)

Bring me the child! I said
Fiat voluntas tua

Appropinquat, appropi,quat
Vita sua nostra erit
Appropinquat finis suis
