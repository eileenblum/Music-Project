Itxaropena ez duzu galdu behar, beti gogoratu nor
Zaren
Zurekin egongo gara iluntasunean zure bidea
Argitzen

Time passes by still I remain the same
A shadow in a misty land
I am confined will this be my demise?
I am a mirage in the sand

Will I be brought to life?

I am alive
But roaming like a ghost
A haunted soul who fights alone
Contending with misery and despair
Longing for somewhere to belong

After the storm, after the nightmare
A new world dawns to let me in

Ex nihilo, ad futurum
Exurge, perge!

You won't be able to repair the damage you've
Encountered
Forever you are doomed, can't flee from destiny

I am constrained
I want to take the helm
The force of the tide swept me away
I need to find something to weave again
The mystic net of my life that was frayed

After the storm, after the nightmare
A new world dawns to let me in

I have to move on with my life
Try to learn from all that's left behind
Yearning for tomorrow
A brand new day
Just another chance

You won't be able to repair the damage you've
Encoutered
Forever you are doomed, can't flee from destiny,
Change your destiny

Flee from destiny

Change your destiny

Itxaropena ez duzu galdu behar, beti gogoratu nor
Zaren
Zurekin egongo gara iluntasunean zure bidea
Argitzen

After the storm, after the nightmare
A new world dawns to let me in

I have to move on with my life
Try to learn from all that's left behind
Yearning for tomorrow
A brand new day
Just another chance

I have to move on with my life
Try to learn from all that's left behind
Yearning for tomorrow
A brand new day
Just another chance

Leave your ghosts behind, open your eyes, the dawn
Is breaking...
