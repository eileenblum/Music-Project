Far from the ocean, another journey to start
Far from the paths that were so familiar to my old compass
Far away beneath the dark meadows of the sky
And my way starts to fade
And I wander, I drift, I lost my way

I didn't own yesterday, but tonight is mine
Tomorrow or yesterday? Choice is in my hand, the future's mine

Far away the meaning, the sways me high
I wander, will leave erase
I wander, how did will find a way

I didn't own yesterday, but tonight is mine
Tomorrow or yesterday? Choice is in my hand, the future's mine

Far away from hatred and pain
Far away, no chance to return
Far away there's no ground to place
My soul, my heart again

Far away from hatred and pain
Far away, no chance to return
Far away there's no ground to place

I'm the girl from nowhere
But I'm free

Will you be there if I close my eyes, I need your presence as a guide
You're the savior I need to escape my sacrifice

Will you be there if I close my eyes, I need your presence as a guide
You're the savior I need to escape my sacrifice

Far away from hatred and pain
Far away, no chance to return
Far away there's no ground to place
My soul, my heart again

Far away from hatred and pain
Far away, no chance to return
Far away there's no ground to place
My soul, my heart again

I'm the girl from nowhere.
I'm the land
