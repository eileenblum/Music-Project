If I only could erase all my memoriesAnd begin another time to liveI would turn my heart into steelI feel living is so painfulThat I think I can't go onIt kills me Cause your soul still lingers hereIn my dreams, in me... How to find my wayHow to get the strengthHow to feel that I'm aliveI wonder why can't go away with youI must be strongI feel all alone If I one could stopThe blank that grows in my mindSending flowing tears awayFrom here How to find my wayHow to get the strengthHow to feel that I'm aliveI wonder why can't go away with youI must be strongI feel all alone I will go on loving youUntil the endOf timeEven though you're gone
