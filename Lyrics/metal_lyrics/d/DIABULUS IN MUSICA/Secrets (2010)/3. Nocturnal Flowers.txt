Your stalk is lacking sap
Like your dry leaves
What will your dreams become
If your shine and beauty disappears?

Who was the love who could
Not feed your roots
Who is the gardener
Who has sown this field full of death trees?

What do you feel
When you open your leaves
To all those poor men?
YOu need this to value yourself
Cause you're empty
Are you sure that this is the life you want to
Live?

(Yes you, come here, this night will be special
one and also your last regret...)

You are a lonely man who lost his course

Don't believe this night will be a special one
Don't listen to his voice,
Don't listen to him you know that...

(Why don't you accept this is your condition,
You have no choice your roots don't let you move)
And I'm not going to fall into your clutches

...This is not your condition
You have a choice 
Your life is only yours,
Don't listen to him
You have a choice

Cause I understand now that my life is led
Astray is not my way.
Could nocturnal flowers see a new dawn?
Can they believe in themselves?
And restart

What do you feel
When you open your leaves
To all those poor men?
You need this to value yourself
Cause you're empty
Are you sure that this is the life you want to
Live?
