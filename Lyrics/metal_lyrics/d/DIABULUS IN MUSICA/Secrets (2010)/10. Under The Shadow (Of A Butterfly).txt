There's so much you'll never knowCause you think our life it's so shortThere're so many place to seeAnd no time to realize your dreams Over the hills, under the skyFeel the sun, touch the snow and smell theRain Feel the freedom, spread your wings and flyAway... Close your eyes and try to seeFar horizons so far away from hereLook at the shadow of my wingsCan you imagine the lands they have been in? Over the hills, under the skyFeeling the sun, touching the snow, smellingThe rain I know you feel a slave of routineYou watch the sky fly over meYou want to be like meYou can do all that you wantIt's not only a dreamWhy don't you breakYour crystal wall? It's just the time to realize your dreamsOver the hills, under the skyFeel the sun, touch the snow and smell theRain You are the only one who can decideFeel the freedom spread your wings and flyAway...
