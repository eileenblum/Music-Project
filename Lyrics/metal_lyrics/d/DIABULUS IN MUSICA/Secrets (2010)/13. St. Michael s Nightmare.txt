Defende nos in proelioContra nequitiamEt insidias diaboliEsto praesidium imperet illi DeusSupplices deprecamirTuque, princeps militiaeMilitiae coelestis In the beginning of timeThere was a great warThe prince of light against Belial he kept the way of the tree of lifeThe gate of paradiesProvoking the rage of the most lovely angelOf night (I'll ascend to heaven:I will raise my throneAbove the stars of GodI will ascend to the tops of the clouds,I will make myslef like the most high) (You were cast out of heavenWhere you'll never come back toYou were cut down to the groundLight bringer, you were brought low*Lucifer qui mane oriebaris*) You cannot win this battle nowJealous angel, surrenderStop shedding bloodJealous angel, surrender No mercy You've lost this fightAnd heaven has lost one of his sonsYou have now what you wantedYou are now your orn God in hellA thief of souls (You refused our loveIt really hurts meYou were my brotherBut I won't have mercyCause the fight has started) He was not strong enoughHis place in heaven was lostHis ambition hurled him down Since then he has been flyingAbove the abyssWith his host of angelsAmong the dark clouds Please, show me the wayDon't let me fade into the darkness of hellWhy did he choose the other side?He decided to betray us Defende nos in proelioContra nequitiamEt insidias diaboliEsto praesidium Satanam aliosqueSpiritus malignosQui ad perditionemAnimarum pervagantur in mundo.
