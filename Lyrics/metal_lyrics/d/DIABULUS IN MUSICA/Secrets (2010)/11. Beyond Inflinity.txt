(I try to understand the messageOf the other sidebut I cannot see anythingCause everything is darkthe Echoes of the blankAre booming in my head Once and againRelease me from them!) Does anybody know the meaning of our lives?Are you frightened of the hard reality? What is beyond in eternity?Is there a new life?What is beyond infinity? (Make this voice stop shoutingI cannot stand his wailHere you have the sign of weaknessThe sign of human's fearsYou do want an answerWhat would you like to hear?The only thing in my mind prophesiesIs that your end is here) Does anybody know the meaning of our lives?Are you frightened of the hard reality? What is beyond in eternity?Is there a new life?What is beyond infinity?
