Obscuritas nemorisObscuritas in abyssis (Shut up,Don't disturb their dreamsShut up,Or you will stay with them forever) Drops of black water fall downWetting the dry treesOf this forestWhere the souls of sorrow sleepSince the sun appearsThat's the punishment for all their sinsStreams of blood nourish this landAnd the frozen windFreezes everything that was alive At least I can breathe the stillnes I wantedI feel myslef reborn from the ashes Don't be afraid of darknessWe come from it and we'll go thereMoon can be our new sunSilence will be our best allyDon't be afraid of darknessWe come from it and we'll go there (nobody can ruffle our calmThis is the shelter of dead soulsWe have no bonds out of this place) What is heaven and what Hell?What is life and death?In my forestFar away from happinessFar away from painOnly silence only peace Obscuritas nemoris quae omnia penetrasNos omns in abyssis custodiasSalus nostra, quies nostra tu es
