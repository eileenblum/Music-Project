New era is here waiting for meA new reality will appear, are you ready for aNew life?Our revolution's going to startCome with us prepare the future, are you readyFor the new life? A new life has just beganI vae learnt to liveAnd I just want to keep this feelingIf I could stop timeAnd catch it with my fingersI would fly... And I could start my revolutionMy heart against the worldI am going to find my own solutionMy own war Don't you think that it's enough?Don't you see the tears of the earth?Our mother's cryingWe all are accomplices of disasterAnd of hate You cannot stop my revolutionMy heart against the worldI am just finding my own solutionIt's my war New era is here waiting for meA new reality will appear, are you ready for aNew life?Our revolution's going to startCome with us prepare the future, are you readyFor the new life? A new life has just beganIt's my turn, it's time for changesThe present will become the pastNew era is hereTo take us on a long tripTo my dreams At kast I've started my revolutionMy heart against the worldHere you are this is my own solutionMy new war
