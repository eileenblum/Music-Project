You know I'm deadThere is no blood now in my veinsOnce I was fireToday I'm dustIs this my defeat?No, I am sure you/I will return to life! Can you hear my breath in your neck?I hope your remorse won't left you live in peaceYou made me realize I was a deceitA science's whim, the progress lust Don't you know who I am?I can feel, I can tasteMy world's the same world you're living inI'm not a cell, your experimentDon't you see me cry?! How many years have you wasted making me?Only a few minutes to destroy your workFull of pain, full of grace: yeas, I reproach youFor my disgrace, for all my tears I would like to knowWhat you wanted yo do with meAt least tell me my sadness has been useful Don't you know who I am?I can feel, I can tasteMy world's the same world you're living inI'm not a cell, your experimentDon't you see me cry?!
