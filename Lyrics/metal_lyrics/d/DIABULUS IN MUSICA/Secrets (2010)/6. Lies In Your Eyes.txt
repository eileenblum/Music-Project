Don't disguise your emotionsCause I know what you thinkI vae a sixth sense thatYou could not imagine I know what you're thinkingIn every moment of your lifeI can see beyond your eyesEvery time you look the mines Why don't you say things straight to me?Now I can't trust you if you've lost faith in me Lies beyond your sightIcy pupils freezing our eyesThis will be the endOf the knowing glance we had Do you want to blind me?What kind of trick will you use?Are you going to dare me?Do you think I'll believe you? Your truth is in disguiseBehind all those cunning liesYou fling them as daggersWhat is happening with us? WWhy don't you say things straight to me?Now I can't trust you if you've lost faith in me Lies beyond your sightIcy pupils freezing our eyesThis will be the endOf the knowing glance we had
