Everlasting days shape the path to weariness
Endless sleepless nights shaking your thoughts
It's your need to feel everything's under control
Your own demons feed your inner storm

It is never too late to start off
It's never too early to change
Your life is only yours
Rely on you

To your aims the key, I'm the voice of all your dreams
I'll show you the stars that shine above you
If once you rose up now your steps can be your guide
Just look at the stars that shine over you

Is that hard to believe you're no longer on your own?
After years of fight and no result
Tell me, can i trust? Will you stay like in a trance?
Or will you dare to think there's a new chance?

It is never too late to start off
It's never too early to change
Your life is only yours
Rely on you

All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us
Precious hours, golden gift, don't waste your time and start being who you want

To your aims the key, the voice of your dreams
I show you the stars that shine above you
