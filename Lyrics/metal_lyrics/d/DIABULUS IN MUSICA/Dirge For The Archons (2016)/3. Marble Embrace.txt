I'm attracted by an odd spell, lurings and magnetic cold
I can feel you shiver, the game has begun
I dream that with my hand I light a spark
Feel my energy flowing into your blood stream

Your blur my sense and let me out of control
You cloud my sight and make my storm rage on

By your steely gaze seduced I cannot escape your frozen arms
I can feel you shiver, my game has begun
Paralyzed by an unconscious need to hold your frosted hand
You're nailed to my wishes, controlled by my wrath

You blur my sense and let me out of control
You cloud my sight and make my storm rage on

I yield myself to your cold embrace
Reality is fading as our minds blend
I turn myself into your marble jail
Reality is fading as the bars melt

Es mi abrazo eterno. Perdida en tu immensidad
Ye sientes desvanecer. Siento be gÃ©lido aliento
Fundidos nuestros nÃ­veos cuerpos
Me arrastro hacia la eternidad...
