Veritas

The sun keeps rising day after day
We rely on the sight that sees in vain
(nothing is true)

Through fake filters we observe a world
A silent enigma waits to be unfold 
(nothing is true)

Between dimensions we drift
We perceive a lie and assume it's real
(nothing it's true)

Limited by our senses
Awareness being hindered betrayed by our lense
(nothing is true)

Veritas de terra pra est. 
Veritas filia temporis vulgus resitatis pesimus interpres

Living our own truth, building our own roots
We will never know what's behind

Veritas filia Dei 
Veritas est adequatio rei et intellectus
Veritas
