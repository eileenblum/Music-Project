I am your nightmare, am I your dream?
I am the lie you'd want to believe
I am the magic, your reverie
I'm your storyteller

I, like a mirage seem to be fake
but I'm the queen in this crazy dance
Come take our hands and join in this wheel
Join in this crazy madness

All your life playing hide and seek
All your life searching the door to my realm
All your life fleeing your fantasy
and here we are waiting

I am your nightmare, am I your dream?
I am the lie you'd want to believe
I am the gate to insanity. 
Welcome to Arcadia

The night dark fairies came, they danced around my bed.
They took me up to ride their Carousel.
In that crazy masquerade I felt confused 
and dazed "ring around" I could never escape
