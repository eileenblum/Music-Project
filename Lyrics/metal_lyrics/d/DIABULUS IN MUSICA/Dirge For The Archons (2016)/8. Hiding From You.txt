Broken is the promise
On which I built these years
I fell and I am stumbling again
I've been captured by new unknown fears
They soak into my brain
I am lost I feel there's no hideaway

Broken is the promise
I made to myself
Every stone in my path flies away
I lived as if there was no tomorrow
And now my dreams collapse
I will face my future behind this wall

I fear for us now that our lives collide
But I am ready to fight

I'm so afraid to go on
Is this the need to feel we're not alone?
I've been searching so long for peace
My firm ground now is shaking

I'm so afraid to fall
I don't want to walk alone
I've been searching so long for peace
And you broke my serenity

No need to say I'm sorry for all the pain I caused
It is never enough to say I cared
You have crawled again into my heart
To rid the tears I cried
All my aims faded like smoke between my arms

We've searched for a hideaway where we don't feel so insecure
What if we fail again? It's meant to be the story of our lives

I've been hiding from you
My heart's hiding from you
My love's hiding from you
All my being is hiding from you
I've been hiding from you
My heart's hiding from you
My love's hiding from you
There's no safe place to escape from you
