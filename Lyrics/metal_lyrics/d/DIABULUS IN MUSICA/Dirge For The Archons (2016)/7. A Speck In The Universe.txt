I find myself pondering about my place here
Burden by awe
By the vastness, my dreaded solitude
By the real meaning of all
By my own fragile existence

Is the journey worth it all that we're forced to leave behind?
The bonds we embraced in every stage of life
Will they transcend? Will we go beyond?
Rocked by the eternal tide

There we flow as a speck of dust in desert lands
We're all stars in the universe
Despite the trials we must walk the path
We're small drops in the tide
