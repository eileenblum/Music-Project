There was a time when we lived wild
We were free spirits in this land
We ran under the sun and dream over the moon
Brother Wolf was my ally
The night my shelter the day my hut
Until the evil came and destroyed all that was

How would i take you back?
I will never resign
Woods are our home, where you and i belong

We were fed by mother Earth
We drink out of her streams when we were thirst
Will her breath dry now my tears away?

Hate and pain is what they bred
They built a fraud that was our bane
Poisoned life no longer will greet the dawn

How would i take you back?
I will never resign
Woods are our home, where you and i belong
Your glance up in the stars
Reminds me about my fight
We all had our place in the circle of life
Now we are just dust
