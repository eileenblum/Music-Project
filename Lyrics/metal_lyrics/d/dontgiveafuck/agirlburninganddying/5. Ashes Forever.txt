You told me you missed everything
What you had won't come back
Eden burned down to the ground

When you came along (I thought that you were the answer)
I see now, it was not love I felt (All I needed was anyone)
This question remains unanswered
(I never cared who you were)
As long as you were a voice in the dark (All I needed was anyone)
This question remains unanswered

These last few months have fucked with my head
Nothing made sense
But now I've walked out of the darkness, refound myself I'm a new man

These last few months have fucked with my head
Nothing made sense
But now I've walked out of the darkness, refound myself I'm a changed man

Fate didn't pour the alcohol down your throat
Destiny wasn't the one that tore us apart...

You did.
We had paradise, you can't rebuild from ashes.
You burned it the fuck down, and left me in the darkness, with nothing.

I don't miss a fucking thing.
I don't give a fuck.
