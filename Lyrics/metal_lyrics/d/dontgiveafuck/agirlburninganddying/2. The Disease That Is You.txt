I feel like we are at a standstill
I don't know how it came to this
I gave you everything I had
And it was never enough

Drink by drink, fuck by fuck, those months tore me the fuck apart
This life of excess you maintain will be the death of me
Drink by drink, fuck by fuck, those months tore me the fuck apart
This life of excess you maintain will be the death of me

Nothing moves you, day in and day out
Drink, smoke, fuck, fight... Is that all you're about?
How can I take judgment from you, when all you care about is fucking drinking?

In crowded rooms I feel alone
I'm struggling to connect
Fuck everything you said
I believe it more every day

Drink by drink, fuck by fuck, those months tore me the fuck apart
This life of excess you maintain will be the death of me
Drink by drink, fuck by fuck, those months tore me the fuck apart

The weight of the world is on my chest
I don't know if I can survive
The weight of the world is on my chest
I know I'm made of more than this

Fuck you
Fuck what you put me through
Fuck you
I deserve better

I'm starting to believe... There is a way out of this
I'm starting to believe... This isn't my fault
I'm starting to believe... I'll be alright. I know I'll be alright.
I hope you fucking drown in a sea of liquor. I know you'll fucking drown.
