It's January, so lost so cold
Wandering in that bitter wind
Tearing through run down Brooklyn streets, at midnight

There is one thing I'm clinging to. With all I have, I hope

I won't feel this way forever
There's something ugly deep inside of me
I've lost my fucking mind

I want to end it all

Will I ever emerge from this?

I want to end it all

I'm left with this burning bitterness
Hating every rundown building I fucking see
Years pissed away dancing in this tragedy
All my hopes and dreams have perished
I want to end it all
I lost the one thing that I knew

Fuck this city. Fuck these streets. Fuck these memories of you.
I'm so cold.

(I lost) Thanks for leaving me with heartbreak in the coldest time of my life
(All I knew) Every time I was there for you, the one time I needed you
(Lost) You fell the fuck through. I'll turn to cheap one night stands

(I lost) and New York romances that are all the same
(All I knew) Counted on a guiding light through the rocks of my life
(Lost) Now all I'm left with is a burning sinking ship, I'm sinking

(Why'd you have to go) You left
(And tear my whole) World apart
(Every memory of us) Now ruined by what you went and fucking did

(Desperation. Creeping like a cancer) You were my world
(Walking in silence at midnight...) You walked out right out that fucking door

Despite everything you did to me
Still I long for your presence
You took my life right from me, and walked away

I am nothing
The world fell apart
When you left
