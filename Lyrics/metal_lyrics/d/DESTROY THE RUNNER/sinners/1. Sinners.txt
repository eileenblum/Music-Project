Do you know who we are? Weâre the living dead.
We get inside your hearts. We get inside your head.
We are spreading lies, and we spread disease.
Just like your god weâll bring you to your knees.
False prophets you say? How Flattering.
False prophets weâll claim.
Your children are not safe. So be afraid. (Be Afraid)
Your crosses, your temples, and rules will break.
We are not the truth or the life. We are not the way.
We bring the dark instead of light. We dwell in graves.
Our God starves the hungry. Our God drowns the weak.
We persuade and tempt the holy. We are the devilâs seeds.
False prophets you say?
False prophets you say? Then false prophets weâll claim.
Your ego is not safe. So be afraid. (Be Afraid)
Your crosses, your temples, and rules will break.
If we are damned then hell is waiting.
If I am damned then youâll go with me.
