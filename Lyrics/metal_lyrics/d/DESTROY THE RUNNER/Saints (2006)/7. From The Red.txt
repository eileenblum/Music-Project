I saw the future in a tree outside.
There was your heart, and there was mine.
This love, torn apart by every word.
Is hopeless love all we have?
Is this what we dreamed?
I cannot go.
Take this heart, let it die slow.
Tear away from the pain.
Tear away from the red.
Are we trading in our hearts for emptiness?
Is this love or human condition?
I close my eyes to see you.
Hope is in your name.
Where you are I cannot go.
Take this heart, let it die slow.
