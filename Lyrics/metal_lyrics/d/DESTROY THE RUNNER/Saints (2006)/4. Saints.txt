This was my call to your arms.
Sounding silent alarms.
Will you love me when you hear me lie?
This last time.
I've seen a see of change.
This fleeting love that leaves me alone.
This last time.
Lift me now from this pain.
You know the way to bring me home.
As we die.
We've dimmed our lights past darkness.
Hiding our way back from this.
Swallowing every glimpse of our faithfulness.
Who will guide us home when we cannot see?
The weak to follow the lead.
Its taking over our lives.
As we live, as we die.
