As I turn my face two ways.
Take a hold.
There can be no hesitation.
Tonight I must fight.
This won't be long.
I will meet you when I'm strong.
Ashes in my eyes bring scars of deception.
Blinded I am, forgive me.
Forgive me, for I was wrong.
There can be no hesitation.
Take my hand.
There can be no regrets.
Take this blindfold from me.
