It's written with your name on it.
The aleph is what we stand on.
Mirror images of everything.
Burning in your eyes.
The reflection in your eyes.
Speaks to me on love's eulogy.
It was only a game that you wanted to play.
I won't be the same.
Say goodbye to all that you hold.
I knelt down to kiss you.
But you wanted to die in your own arms.
You were the one to call me hopeless.
You were the one to call me dear.
Standing side by side, eyes full of fear.
