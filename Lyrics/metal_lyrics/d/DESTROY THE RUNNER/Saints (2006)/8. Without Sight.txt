All the pain that you painted on my face.
All those pretty colors on your pallet.
Stabbing my chest.
With your brush of hopelessness.
And this whole time I fell for it.
I fell for it.
You think you can pull this over my eyes.
I can see this without sight.
Slowly fade away.
I'll walk with my thought.
But my heart will always stay.
I wish you could have painted a moment.
A moment with all sincerity.
A moment with all honesty.
I can see without sight.
