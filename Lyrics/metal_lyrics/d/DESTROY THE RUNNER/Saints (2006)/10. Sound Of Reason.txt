I feel so weightless.
Nothing inside is keeping me grounded.
My self-decay brings tears to my eyes.
Fingerprints of the dead.
Descend on my window.
I feel it's all I see.
I feel it's breaking me.
Haunting words of emptiness.
I'm not afraid, so take me.
I feel it's breaking in me.
I'm not afraid to take me.
I'm dead inside, so save me.
As a new campaign marches across the dead.
In uniform with one vision:
Delivering our children.
Each step making a sound of reason.
Breaking and burning caskets.
Marching across the dead.
