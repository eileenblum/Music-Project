Another second wasted or is it another year?
We've tried hard not to face it.
Erase a thought so clear.

A we've tried to cover our eyes and ears,
(But we can see with our hearts,)
And it's the greatest view from here.

[Chorus:]
Give them your eyes.
(They are no longer invisible.)
Give them your eyes.
(They are no longer invisible.)

Comfortable, we are so blind.

The vision lives on inside this wasted time,
And the dream is growing.
The time that is gone we've tasted,
But now we crave a different song.

Give them your eyes.
(They are no longer invisible.)
Give them your eyes.
(They are no longer invisible.)

And we all know,
And we all know and do nothing about it.
And we all know,
We all know and do nothing do nothing.
We do nothing about them.

And if it was all turned around.
What do you see now?
All of their many tears could drowned
Apathy that' is found in you.
In you
In you
In you

Give them your eyes.
(They are no longer invisible.)
Give them your eyes.
(They are no longer invisible.)

We all know,
We all know and do nothing about it.
We all know,
We all know and do nothing do nothing.
We do nothing about it.
