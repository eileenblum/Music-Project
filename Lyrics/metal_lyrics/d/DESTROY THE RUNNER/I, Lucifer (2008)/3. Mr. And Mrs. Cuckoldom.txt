Cut out a heart and then ran away with you.
Today I'll start and do the same to you.
I'll watch you leave.
I'm not what you need.

Everyone wants the same as I do.
As you wait and bleed, I am trying to forget you.
I'll watch you leave.
You'll watch me grieve.

Lie to me to make this better, and I won't leave.
I will stay, I have made grave with you.
We can sleep now. Entombed, we can sleep now.

So this happens once again to a child without sin.
Don't say, "This is love."
Just say, " This is greed."
We'll watch you leave.

We won't give up this time.
We won't give up.
We'll give our all this time.
We'll give our all.
