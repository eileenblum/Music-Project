Outside,
They hear a different song than inside.
What's in your heart?
You'll find that they are just waiting for you
This time to watch you fall.

[Chorus:]
If you're drawing lines you can get off our side.
We want to be wrong if what you say is right.
Down on you, Down on you! They'll never stop.
How can you? Now can you use what you've got?

A fire,
Is burning inside of you,
And they've tried to put you out.
You'll find that possibly maybe that you might die,
But not on your own.
But they will tell you that you're wrong.
If you're drawing lines you can get off our side.
We want to be wrong if what you say is right.
Down on you, Down on you! They'll never stop.
How can you? Now can you use what you've got?
Your blankets of "What if's?" there making us cold.
We've tasted life wasted and it's getting old.
"You'll never make it" ,at least we tried.
And If we make it, well, at least we tried.
We've tried
We've tried
We've tried
We've tried
You can not stop us.
This is who we are.
You can not stop us.
This is who we are.
If you're drawing lines you can get off our side.
We want to be wrong if what you say is right.
Down on you, Down on you! They'll never stop.
And how can you? Now can you use what you' have got?
