Another child is born into this pain,
And the unfortunate die slow.

Who do we blame?
Give our fingers a place to go.
Give us a name that youknow.
They know.
We all know.

A God we can't see
(is barking orders)
A thought and a dream
(is more as it seems)
As children play in thestreet
(children are also crying)
As they choose what to eat
(childrenare also dying)

One question started off,
And now there is more.
Areanswers found in hats of thorns?
What is the point?
He's given us all a choice.
We'll flip a coin,
And rejoice, rejoice,
We rejoice!

Thedrowning are asking
"Who'll stop the rain?
Have the angels all goneaway?"
The suffering's not passing.
"Who will stop the pain?"

A God we can't see
(is barking orders)
A thought and a dream
(is more as it seems)
As children play in thestreet
(children are also crying)
As they choose what to eat
(childrenare also dying)
