Give me one reason and I'll give you more.
It seems I'm not what she was looking for.
I was waiting for something.
And I found out that it's nothing.

[Chorus:]
Never act that way (and then let's talk about growing old)
Never say those things boy (and forget all that you know)
You will love this pain (you've got nowhere to go), and you will play her games.
And do what you're told

I'll be happy with or without you.
You make your choices and become what you choose.
Break an organ that's mended, and fake who your in love with.

Never act that way (and then let's talk about growing old)
Never say those things boy (and forget all that you know)
You will love this pain (you've got nowhere to go), and you will play her games.
And do what you're told

Tell me, "That distance is why we fight."
And though your not like other guys, everything I say is right.
Tell me, "I envy and hate your God."
Life is a meaningless song.
Hope and true love all have gone away.

I'll never act that way (and then let's talk about growing old)
I'll never play your games girl (I am letting go).
You're not what I need (now I really see), and you are what I leave.
I have never felt this free
