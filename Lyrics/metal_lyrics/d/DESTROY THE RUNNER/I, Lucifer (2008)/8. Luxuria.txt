He was given a thorn in his side.
Was I given the same?
Around everycorner in this life
Lies are whispering.
I follow what they say.

As demons hide,
I'll curse your name,
And I'll say it to your face.
WhenI've died and touched the flame,
I'll know who I should blame.

Theblankets of this leave me cold.
Curse my thoughts and my eyes.
Lookingback at all of this I know
Maybe I should of cried.
Maybe I don'tmind.

As demons hide,
I'll curse your name,
And I'll say it to your face.
WhenI've died and touched the flame,
I'll know who I should blame.

You've got today,
But you always say
That you'll change tomorrow.
Good intentions fade
When you sit and say
that you'll change tomorrow.

We have stolen blood running through
Our veins like a cancer.
We havefound a cure and it's you,
And we have found the answer.

As demons lie,
I speak your name,
And I'll say it to your face.
When I die,
I'll saywith a smile
That you are the one to blame.
