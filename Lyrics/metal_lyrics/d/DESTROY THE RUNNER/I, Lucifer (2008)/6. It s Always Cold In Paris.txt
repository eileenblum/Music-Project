Death to my will.
Oh, can I fill this hole in my heart?
What will ever fill?
I've fallen way to far.
I wanted only you.

Tell me what we are
When I'm hurting you,
Your hurting me,
And whyare we in love?
Nothing is ever new and we both can see that.

Death toyour will.
Oh, can I fill this hole in your heart?
Swallow me as a pill
And stand with me in the dark.
Oh, I wanted only you.

Winter haslasted to long.
Oh, it's always cold here.
We can't see right or seewrong.
Oh, it always snows, dear.
Winter has lasted to long.
Oh, it'salways cold here.
We can't see right or see wrong.
Oh, it's always cold,my dear.

Tell me what we are
When I'm hurting you,
Your hurting me,
And whyare we in love?
Nothing is ever new and we both can see that.

With crumbling, ripping, and failing,
You'd think that we'dget the point.
God and the devil are saying,
"The well has rejectedyour coins."
