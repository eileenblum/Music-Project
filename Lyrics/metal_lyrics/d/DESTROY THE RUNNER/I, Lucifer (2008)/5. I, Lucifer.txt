I carved you picture into my skin.
I showedeveryone that I never sin.
Just 'cause I bleed like you
I am not aman.
I am not of this world
And you must understand that.

I have apredestined plan,
And I walk better than you.
I preach what I practice,
And I will practice on you.

Carved your holy name inside my skin,
I showed everyone I'm not a trend.
I am a zombie,
I'd be better offdead.
Speak of angels,
But host demons instead and...

I am prayingfor a prayer that's true.
I am preying on you.
I talk aboutwalking,
And I try to walk upon you.

When I look at all of you I see,
I seethe weak.
I'm a wolf among the lost sheep.
When I look at all of you I see,
I see the weak.
I'm a wolf among the lost sheep.

I will tell them thescriptures.
I will profit from your name.
I will sell them thescriptures,
and I will pocket your fame.
I magnify splinters
Whiletrees grow from my eyes.
I am posing for pictures.
I am feasting on bread and your wine.
