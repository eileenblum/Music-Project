I watch him cry,
And hold onto his legs as a mother waits outside forher son to come.
I've seen to much.
I haven't seen enough.
You haven'tseen enough until you have seen a family breaking up.

(no one..)
It'slike nothing that you've felt before.
(No one should ever feel like...)
(like this)
I'll cry, but tears won't lock the doors.
(no one...)
It'slike throwing away all of those years.
(no one should ever live likethis.)

I'll cry,
But my tears won't keep you here,
Or keep us together.
Fathers and Mothers,
Know that your sons and your daughters
Might walk a road that is harder
Because of the choices you've made
Or the onesthat you make.
We have lived with your blood on our hands.
What we'vebeen waiting for now...
Now it's our chance.

We will stand,
Sisters andbrothers,
From broken homes and broken lovers.
We will fight forsomething true,
And we will stand for something true.

(no one..)
It'slike nothing that you've felt before.
(no one should ever feel like...)
(like this)
I'll cry, but tears won't lock the doors.
(no one...)
It'slike throwing away all of those years.
(no one should ever live likethis.)

Where others havefailed,
we will make it.
Where families derail,
We won't lose track.
We'll start a trail,
And our kin will take it.
We'll fight tooth andnail when lies attack.

Falling Leaf.
