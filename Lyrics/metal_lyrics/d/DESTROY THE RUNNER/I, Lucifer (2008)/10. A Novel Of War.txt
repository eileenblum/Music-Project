They fight and it never seems like it ends.
"Are you too busytonight?"
When all of your children cry,
"Oh God, when will it end!?"

Will we ever see the day
The world stands as one?
Love and peace arehidden
Somewhere under this sun.
We are on our knees and
Praying to endthis war.
Time will already murder
What they are fighting for.

Justifybelief in a God that's left you behind,
But we're still hoping tonight
That our prayers and our wishes,
Find a way through their hearts.

Will we ever see the day
The world stands as one?
Love and peace arehidden
Somewhere under this sun.
We are on our knees and
Praying to endthis war.
Time will already murder
What they are fighting for.

All of this time their burning down bridges.
All of this time warsfought from religions.
All of this time spent burning the witches.
All of this time they're fighting for riches.
All of this time theirbreaking the stitches
All of this time their dying in ditches.
All of this time...
