[6th Movement]

[Murmurs]

Blinding light, forced from within his crypt
Evergreen mounds turning red to fire
As I'm heading higher, clear the fire
Boast your light, crushing to dust
Nowhere, got to flee on footsteps while there's time
Teaching his every space of desire
Red Alert, for can't you hear the
That's it now, dig deep
Climb through madness
