Take a deep breath
Pulling once again
It'll get you through on your own
Coming down with the dead behind [?]
Murderous nature of the dream
Black door, reveal the end
I'll never come and serve him, die to your God

Dark fear, alert to the night here
Weeping for them alone
Weeping for them alone

Take a deep breath
A bullet once again
It'll get you through on your own
