Down to three
Black path discovered
Roll on further, down from the moonlight

Killing reads on your face
We know the kill, will arise
Kneel downward one more time
And arise, use your arm
For protecting the heat of your own mass
You will be gone now, forever
Try to sleep one more time
And arise - suffer - use your arm
