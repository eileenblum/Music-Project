Killing reads on your face
We know the kill, will arise
Fear starts behind your gun
Suffer, shoot - use your arm
[Murmurs]

Smoke churned into the room
Collapse, the heat of murder
Why can you bring - come closer... [?]
Lost the control of the burning path [?]
[Murmurs]

Shooting reads on your face
The need to kill, will arise
Fear starts behind your gun
Suffer, shoot - use your arm

Someone deserved, over the dead one
