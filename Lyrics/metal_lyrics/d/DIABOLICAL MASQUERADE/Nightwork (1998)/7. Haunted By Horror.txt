The shadow we for got of the dead some tragedy
I'm crush dead frays out fame it to do
Path of blackness the path to mighty forest
Bleaching through defeat it purr back its wallow it shay:pick turn infernal

Gave it to the spat the forest lent be hide look at this sane legion we're won't to die

Desire in latch we want it forehead and captured within for resole is side
Breed on slowly doubt pride pay be frosted on dot haunted moon

So I am the dead, arrow blood and thunder
Make me wonder of the hate and moon clays
Turn back the fault shove me with anger
And revolve of the blood with hatch never be dead

Fallen for reborn I am is stand in high
Rising for dying dream ultimate in shade
