Dark dead story true by goes
Tell your true my demons tread
Nub the endless time
Moon for gave this looted red
Dread asleep and wake frosted you by
Sealer of truly cap

Superb war existent
It's chock on trait
Tear above the fission
To cover in cease
Low on heal the cemetery
Obsessed by the might
Abort get as I reached dead
Modern face of world

Haunted by destruction find the shades of bluff
Ride the gates for fiction cross the other side
Bear the light of unbound of world comfits of wonders
Sheik unbounded truth to find the top to death
