Terror, reaching forward with blood
The face here before him, meant to allure him
Rider on the Bonez
Repulsion, a curse of scenes obscene
Parallel fragments, uncharted ruins
With the power to blind
Petrified, three years in the old ground
Dragged by the hair, embraced with filth
The worries that probably had drowned
Horror, a five second collapse
The serial pain, blazing through rain
The clock that ticks on and ticks on...

"God... is it really you? God? is it really you..?"
"DO I LOOK LIKE GOD TO YOU!!?"

In birth and flight for terror
I'm the chamber of time
To burn plague through them
The outer white light
The funeral attendance
Rising from within
Dragged by the steel
The world on his shoulders
