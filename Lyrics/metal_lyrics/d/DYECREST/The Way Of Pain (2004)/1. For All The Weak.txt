[Takala]

I've seen your show before
I know how it will end
You're selling your very own truth
For all the weak who wanna believe
in your way to be saved

You will get your prize or make them burn in hell
When the fools are under your spell

How do you explain it to your own soul-to-be-saved
when life is running out and there's no sign of light

All the nonsense has been made just to rule
Made to be followed by all you fools
They think for you
And tell you what to do
To keep your mind away from how the things really are

For all the weak who wanna
believe in you
For all the weak you wanna
you wanna rule

How deep the lie will go?
Will you die before you know?
