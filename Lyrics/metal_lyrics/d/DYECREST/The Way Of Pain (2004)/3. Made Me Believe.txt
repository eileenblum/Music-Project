[Takala]

Here's no use in sheding the tears
'Cause there's no one to hear them drop
There's no use in telling the fears
'Cause there's no one to cease the pain

Not just to make it through today
If only I could live it, that's my dream...

There's no use in laying the faith
'Cause there's no one to understand
There's no use in sheding the tears
'Cause there's no one to dry them away

Through my days I have been
much too many times
The victim of the crimes
Made by their eyes,
too weak to tell the truth,
it stayed covered up with lies,
so strong that they made me believe
