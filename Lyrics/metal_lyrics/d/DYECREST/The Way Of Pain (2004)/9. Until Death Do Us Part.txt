[Oksanen]

Sitting in my cold chair waiting for the dark
Feelings overwhelm me giving me a spark

I see you standing there with fear in your eyes
Begging me for forgiveness no big surprise

Voices calling in my head
keep telling me these things
Thoughts racing through my head
in this game no one wins

See you by the window planning your escape
Should I just tie you up just to play it safe

I'm gonna make you pay
For every tear I shed
Until death do us part
I'm gonna love you...
I'm gonna love you 'til you're dead

I need help to get me out of this damn maze
(I need help)
I'm afraid of what's alive in me will kill
(Oooo, I'm afraid)
I need help to get out of this damn maze
(Oooo, I need help)
I'm afraid of what's alive in me will kill
(Ooooo, what's alive in me will kill)

Keep my eyes on you just to make it sure
In this lonely world I feel so insecure

Guilt and anger don't give me moment's rest
Should I end it now wouldn't that be best
