[Takala]

With fire in their hearts,
yearning to live their lives
all they ever wanted
was to bear their own cross...
(but) What is left after the fight?
Faith and pride lost in time
War will always be the same
Lost dreams in lost horizon

Too much pain to keep up the fight
No faith to believe there's time
War will always be the same
Lost children with lost tomorrow

So little thet ever asked for
So much was taken away
They weren't the ones to choose...

...Lost faith

Too many children - Have lost their faith
Too many children - Have seen their brothers die
Too many children - Have lost their own
Too many children - Have learnt how to hate...
