Felt the rhythm
Of days Disappear
When I heard your words
About another truth

When was the trust defined as livin'
Behind a curtain,
Where you were hiding
Another you

Making a fool of my restless heart
Though you don't know the shape I'm in
Once whole, now torn apart
Belief in life within, my only sin

Seeing the change
Of a dream long ago
When the stakes were getting higher

When you were the one to pull me near
I was blind enough to see you'd feel
When you were the one to give the signs
Was it clear to you I did believe

I don't wanna
Wish you well
To the darkness
Where you dwell
That's not my hell
