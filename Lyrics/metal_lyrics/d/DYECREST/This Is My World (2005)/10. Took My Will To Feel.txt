Every smile I got from you
Was only born out of pity
And never meant to let me know,
To let the unknown flow

You just wanted to share your pain
And make two feel the same

When you saw me,
Dying to see how the unknown would be
You just turned your face away
Denied the truth,
But asked me to stay

I took your hand
To guide you through the dark

Remember the night
When you lost my will to live?
Remember the night
When you took my will to feel?

(It was then)
When I should've put an end
To torturing you
I should've stopped
Torturing myself,
And said goodbye...
