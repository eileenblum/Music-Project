Laughing as you try to save me from fallin'
Don't waste your breath, I'm already crawling

My master and savior has promised me freedom
As long as I don't question these methods he's keep on

This is the time you choose
The side you're on, win or lose

Rush of life
The minute I let go
Injected by fear, refusing to say no
Rush of life
The minute I'm going down

Searching for meaning, now seems so futile
I am still locked inside my own mind

This is the time you choose

Rush of life
The minute I let go
Injected by fear, refusing to say no
Rush of life
The minute I'm fallin'
The prize is mine
As long as I stay alive
