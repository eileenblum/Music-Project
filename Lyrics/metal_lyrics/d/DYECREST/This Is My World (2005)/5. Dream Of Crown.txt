I go to sleep
With you by my side
It's someone else
With who you wake up

I was there
When livin' meant together

When I look back
At all of my traces
I'm searching your eyes
Among all the faces

And you're not there
Not one of those
Who made me be

To find life again, could there be a way
In my eyes, it seems to fade away
When the ties were gone, can you name the day
When the lies came in, left nothin' to say

When did it all turn around
When did I start losin' ground
When did I turn upside down
And forgot the dream of crown

When did we turn
The way we always feared
I can but burn
The way I always knew
