Floating in the jet-black waters once again
Mind is bright like the starlit sky above
Lettin' the waves drift me to the open sea
Strayed off course so long time ago

Feel the changes in the air
Shifting of the wind
Echoing voices now insisting
New direction is ahead
Towards much deeper shadows
Than ever before

White bright light in the sky
Follow 'cause you know
Now it's the time (it's the time)
Across the oceans sailing star so far away
Illusion, your only truth
Go astray

Step off the path credulous soul
I am now waiting for you
Ask no more questions, wanderer
One true believer
Obey me with no reservation
I'm the one to say your will
Take it in trust, embrace my truth
It will make you complete
