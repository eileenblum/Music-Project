Right now I'm reaching
The point of no return
I'm entering the emptiness
Redeeming myself
From everything I feel

Far too long
I've watched this show
Where everything is nothing

I'm hollow
There's just the fear
When the eyes are drawing near
I'm hollow
Deep in the core
Not even a shadow
To live for

Gazing the mirror
I see a halfmoon backwards
And I'm inside out
The fear is growing
I'm feelin' all so clear
The emptiness is filling me

I cannot cry
I cannot laugh
Just this emptiness in me
