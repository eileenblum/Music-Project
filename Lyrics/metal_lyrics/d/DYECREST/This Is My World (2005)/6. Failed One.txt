Chained spirit in the shadows
Fettered by shame
Incarcerated by the only one
Who knows his real name

Give the ravens a treat
And let it be
Naught but the bones
Escape scot-free
Deny the growth of your own seed

The thrill of flying was better than in my dreams
Now but the pain in my fractured wings

Enter the real world, weak one
You are to rot till your kingdom come

Let the dirt wash away
There's no one for you to stay
Stream can take it all away
Take it away
Let the filth wash away
You can't live with all this shame
Avert your eyes and walk away
Walk away

Your bloodstained hands can be washed
Your own blood that it is
With oblivion comes relief

Leave the failed one in the shades
Fragile shell turns to dust, day by day
