Thought we had found a shelter
Keeping us safe from the cruel world
Took it as a sanctuary
Now we are banished for all eternity

Among the wolves we wonder
In the snow with cold and hunger
You have now proved your power and might
Driving your children out into the night

Clear vision with a black heart
Fortune is what you're after
Drawing you to the dark side
One day will pull you under

Found a place to rest, realized
I was lying in a pile of snakes
Black eyed gaze in the dark
Your dark schemes grant your desires
Now it is your time

Know the price of a failure
Wither, waste away
You are not worthy
To earn the right to live

Do you know the price?
You should know the price!
