Before it was all so clear
I knew where to lay my head
Now the crystal has turned to a mirror,
Showing me the false
Of the past

Reflecting
How it was so easy
To betray myself
I was Faking
The things I ever dreamed of
Could've been
My own

This is my world
The walls aren't closing in,
They're out of sight
This is my world
Where the dreams are not to come true,
They're to burn me

Yesterday
It was crystal clear
Now the mirror's
Chosen the way of pain

It's showing pictures
Of a man who was me
Now just the shattered pieces of a restless soul
