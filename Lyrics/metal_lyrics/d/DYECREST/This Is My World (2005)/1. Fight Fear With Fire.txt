Spreading your wisdom
Behind the hood that's blinding you
I never understood your "Freedom",
Your everlasting truth

And with that almighty gaze
You're keeping all of us safe

Cease the lives of those who make you fear
Silent the screams you don't want to hear
There's always someone to take the blame
Your soldiers keepin' you in the game

So many hands
To secure your Eyesight
Keepin' your look
Straight ahead

You'll never ever have to see
All the trash you leave behind
You'll never ever have to be
Responsible for your lies
