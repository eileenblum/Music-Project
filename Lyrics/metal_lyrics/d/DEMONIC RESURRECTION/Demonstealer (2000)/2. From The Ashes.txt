Burnt to cynders the ashes still remain,
Burried under the earth nothing can contain...us.
Burnt to death we still live on,
Slowly we rise in the light of dawn.
As we stand tall and strong we sing the cries of death.

We will rise from the ashes,
That were buried so deep.
We will rise from the ashes,
And awaken from our sleep.

Swallowed by this earth we are given rebirth,
Exit the ashes and enter the earth.
Finally reborn we stand alone,
Killing the fire and everything goes cold.
The clouds grow evil the sky turns red
We have opened the gates to hell.

We will rise from the ashes,
That were buried so deep.
We will rise from the ashes,
And awaken from our sleep.

Into your mind we shall wander
It is your soul we conquer.
Turning your dreams into nightmares
Making your life a living hell.

We will rise from the ashes,
That were buried so deep.
We will rise from the ashes,
And awaken from our sleep.

Far beyond the threshold
From the remains of us
As light slowly fades
We await the final dusk.
&gt;From the ashes buried under
And the serpents blood.
We are the choosen ones
To begin the massacre.

We will rise from the ashes,
That were buried so deep.
We will rise from the ashes,
And awaken from our sleep.
