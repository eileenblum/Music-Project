From the cold mystic frost,
A creature unknown to man.
Is born into the world
With inhuman powers in his hands.

The Demonstealer will conquer the earth
He is the choosen one,given rebirth.
Leader of satans army,master of all
With his coming, humanity will fall.

Undone the shadow and behold,
The creature from the past.
In the form of a man
With the powers of a god.

The Demonstealer will conquer the earth
He is the choosen one,given rebirth.
Leader of satans army,master of all
With his coming, humanity will fall.

With the strenght of a 1000 dead
And might of a million souls.
With every demon he hath stole
His warth turns into a burning inferno.
He wrecks havoc in his path.
As in search of demons he goes.
To steal their corpses from the grave
And resurrect them unto his horde.

A devil in disguise
To create a new breed
Of the lost demonic souls
And rule the earth eternally.

The Demonstealer will conquer the earth
He is the choosen one,given rebirth.
Leader of satans army,master of all
With his coming, humanity will fall.
