Born into the world though I didnt ask.
Made to live a life against my will.
In this world I live my sick life.
A longed life I live in my mind.

This is my world of sadness.
This is my life of pain.

So many friends but still so few.
Just a joke to most liked by a few.
Playing the jester to them all.
Just another laugh thats all I am.

This is my world of sadness.
This is my life of pain.

Why cant you see?
That I'm so alone.
That I have no one.
Who is my friend?
Who is my enemy?
I know their all the same

Please take my pain away!
Make this life a little better!
Make the words hurt less !
Help me make sense of the mess!
When will I find my inner self?
When ....when will it end??..never?
Then I'll end it myself!

This is my world of sadness.
This is my life of pain.

This is my world of sadness.
This is my life of pain.
Care to take a look inside?
Step right up this way.
