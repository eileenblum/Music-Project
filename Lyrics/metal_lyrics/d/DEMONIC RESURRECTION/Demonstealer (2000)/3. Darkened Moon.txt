Pumping darkness into earth,
Heavens angels start to cry,
Mothers milk baby denies,
Holy people burn the church.

As we watch the sinful things,
Darkness creeps behind our backs,
The blinding light begins to flash,
The shroud devourers me!
The Darkened Moon has show its warth.

Devils rodents eat the flesh,
Children watch the little green men,
Corpses roaming the dark grave,
Darkness makes the children pray.

As we watch the sinful things,
Darkness creeps behind our backs,
The blinding light begins to flash,
The shroud devourers me!
The Darkened Moon has show its warth.

Teachers watch as children bleed,
Gardners plants mutate to weeds,
Brothers pull the puppets strings,
Hunter hunts for harmless things.

As we watch the sinful things,
Darkness creeps behind our backs,
The blinding light begins to flash,
The shroud devourers me!
The Darkened Moon has show its warth.
