I tried and tried like forever it seemed,
Against all odds that stood against me.
I did my best I was put to rest
Just another dissapointment
I will forget and move on!

Crestfallen..I was meant to be.
Crestfallen..Why always me??
Crestfallen..Rejected Again.
Crestfallen..You're to blame

Every chance missed is another chance lost
Every chance i take in sorrow i sit and rot
With every breath my body deteriorates
Soon I will be gone and no memories will remain.

Crestfallen..I was meant to be.
Crestfallen..Why always me??
Crestfallen..Rejected Again.
Crestfallen..You're to blame

Why is it always the same?
Why did it have to be this way?
What can i do to change it??
How can i make up for my sin??
How do i cover up my mistakes??
Is this the end of my life?
Are you ready to face the future?

Crestfallen..I was meant to be.
Crestfallen..Why always me??
Crestfallen..Rejected Again.
Crestfallen..You're to blame.

I have fallen and so will you.
I'll come back to life to haunt you forver.
The guilt will return and never leave you.
I have died but u will sufFer.
As you rot away I grow stonger.
