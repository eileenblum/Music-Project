Sitting all alone with the lights out
except that of a candle burning.
Sitting all alone with my thoughs and you
are all that I can see.

All i feel is the pain you left me.
All i think is how much more misery.
All is wish for is my own saviour
Come and save me before I forget how to feel.

I feel nothing anymore.
I feel no joy or pain.
But the sadness still remains.

The howling wind and sound of the ocean
bring my pain to life.
As i look to the ocean and my heart bleeds
I wish i was not me.

I always though.
I always believed.
I always felt that you were the one
and we were always meant to be.

I feel nothing anymore.
I feel no joy or pain.
But the sadness still remains.

Kill the pain i feel,
Kill the misery I bleed,
Turn the darkness into light,
Turn what wrong into right,
I have waited for this day,
When i feel happiness again,
Witness to failure again,
For all of eternity the sadness will remain.

The silent tears I cry help release and heal
the pain i feel now.
The music playing burns into my soul
and i slowly go cold.

I feel nothing anymore.
I feel no joy or pain.
But the sadness still remains.
