Forever I bleed with eternal misery.
The sickness thats born from within.
Just an excuse to be diffrent.
Wierd But never special.

I'm stained with dirt.
From my head to my toe.
Let the pain corrode the filth
And cleanse me of my misery.

Forever I cry tears of sorrow.
Slowly I feel the pain.
What have i done to deserve this?
Why do i always feel this way?

I'm stained with dirt.
From my head to my toe.
Let the pain corrode the filth
And cleanse me of my misery.

Time.....is said to heal.
All...of my wounds.
Make....my life .
Something...better.
But time...has failed.
Time has failed to kill the pain
And the pain never fades away

I'm stained with dirt.
From my head to my toe.
Let the pain corrode the filth
And cleanse me of my misery.
