It was revenge that fueled Hiranyakashipu to undertake years of austere penance,
It was his vow to avenge the death of his kin, slayed by the hand of Vishnu.
Brahma did offer a boon âoh lord grant me immortalityâ
âThat I cannotâ Brahma did speak, Hiranyakashipu chose his words carefully.

Let death not come to me,neither by man nor beast,
Not by day or by night, not on the earth or in the sky.
Let death not come to be, neither indoors nor outdoors,
Nor by any weapon, grant me lordship over the material world.

âSo let be itâ said Brahma,
And he became lord of the heaven and earth.

It was his son who did betray, a devoted follower of Vishnu,
How can he worship my enemy, the god who killed my brother?
Worship me or I will kill you, where is your god, will he protect you?
I fear you not for he will protect me, the all pervading Lord Vishnu

If he is all pervading, he must be in this pillar.
Let him come and protect you.
For I shall slay you,
Vishnu, in the form of Narasimha, emerged

He is neither a beast nor a man.
It is the twilight hour, neither day nor night.
At the threshold, neither indoors nor outdoors.
Upon his body, neither on the earth nor in the sky,
Disemboweled by his claws.
Alas, Vishnu has outwitted me.
