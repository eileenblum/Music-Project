Siddhartha was a prince,
Scion of a king
His majesty enjoyed luxuries of his choice,
Ignorant of the world's evil,
Until he left his world.

Stepped out, into the world,
His chariot on the road,
Went forth to lands he owned.
His inquisitive soul,
He saw, truth behold,
Untold before unfold.

And he saw pain, agony, misery.
And he saw anguish.
And he saw suffering.
Cries, thru his eyes.
Lies, thru his eyes.
Death, thru his eyes.
Lies, thru his eyes.

And he asked, is this life?
Questioned existence. Questioned life.
Abandoned his wife and child.
He ventured out in search of the truth,
Abandoning the lie.

Years passed and time went by,
Meditating under Bodhi, enlightened by.

And he returned to live among men,
Sharing what he had gained.
Another gospel for the world,
And this was his sermon.
And so he became Buddha.

Buddham sharanam gacchami.
