The demon king Ravana grows powerful,
He is all but immortal.
In fear, the devas approach Vishnu.
Fear not for I shall slay him,
Manifest myself in the sons of Dasharatha,
In Rama the eldest, and partially in his brothers.

But fate would have its way,
Ram was not crowned king.
Banished into exile,
For fourteen years to the day.

His brother and his wife chose to stay by his side
Follow him into the forest, into his exile.

And so she came, one day in to the forest,
Shurpanakha, sister of Ravana.

Smitten by Rama, who spurned her advances.
Even Laxman did turn her away.
Infuriated by their mockery she attacked Sita.
Hacking off her ears and nose, Laxman sent her on her way.

And Ravan vowed vengeance on Rama,
Take what he holds most dear, his wife Sita.

It was a deceitful golden deer,
That led Ram and Laxmanastray.
Ravan did have his way and abduct Sita.
They searched the forest, all but in vain,
In befriending Sugreeva, the answer, it came.

Sita was held captive in Lanka, Ravanâs domain.
On the quest to bring her back, the ocean stood in the way.
Rama called upon Varuna, who said, âlord build your wayâ.
The bridge across the ocean, to Lanka, you must lay.

The army of Rama did lay wasteto the demon kingâs.
With the twang of his bow, victoryâs cry did ring.
Ravan did perish, Sitaâs freedom.
And so Vishnu did complete the quest for which he came.
