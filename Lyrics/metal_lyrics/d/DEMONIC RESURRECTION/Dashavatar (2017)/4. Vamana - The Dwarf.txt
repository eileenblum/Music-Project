Mahabali, the Asura king, son of Vairochana, grandson of Prahlada,
His penance did reap him the golden chariot, celestial weapons for the conquest of heaven.
Riding into battle, conquering the heavens, Mahabali sat powerful, on the throne of Indra.
He will fall, when he does not heed to words from his counsel, a curse will fall on his head.

A brooding mother did pray, for the glory of her sons, observing a payovrata for lord Vishnu.
To restore the order, he was born into this world, a dwarf son to Aditi, mother of the devas.
Marching to the kingdom, with tricks up his sleeve, asking for alms, Mahabali agreed.
Tell me oh Bramhachari, what will you have? I will fulfill your desires, grant any wish you have.

Three paces of land are all I need,
And three paces of land are all Iâll have.
You wish shall be granted,
Said the pompus King Mahabali

He paid no heed to his guru Shukracharya,
Who warned him of deceit.
Vamana did claim the land he did seek,
From a dwarf to a giant he grew.

Vamana! The great deceiver.
Vamana! Mahabali was fooled.
With every step you take, you cover the world.

With his first stride he covered the distance,
From the heaven to the earth.
With the second he covered the netherworlds.
With one stride left and nowhere to go,
Bali offered his head.

Vamana! The great deceiver.
Vamana! Mahabali was fooled.
With every step you take you cover the world.

I grant you immortality for your humility,
I grant you the chance to visit your people.
