At the dawn of the new kalpa,
As Brahma did architect his creations,
Bhoomidevi tossed upon the waves,
And sank to the bed of the ocean.

Swayambhuva and Shatarupa came into being.
Father your guidance is what we seek.
Beget many children and rule over the earth,
Keep your heart free from jealousy.

I shall obey you wishes Father,
But I have a question for thee.
Where shall me and my progeny live,
Bhoomidevi lies submerged.

In his hour of need,
Brahma turned to Vishnu.
He meditated on the lord,
And lo and behold from his nostrils,
Appeared a boar.

No larger than his thumb,
As he gazed upon it, it grew.
Larger and larger, up to the skies,
It was indeed Lord Vishnu.

He tore through the clouds and rose to the skies,
Dived into the ocean to retrieve.
To safely restore Bhoomidevi, his quest,
Swallowed by the oceanâs depths.

As Vishnu raised Bhoomidevi from the ocean bed,
The asuraHiranyaksha came spoiling for war from the west.
Vishnu paid him no heed, rising from the ocean floor.
Enraged Hiranyaksha challenged the beast, with his mighty roar.

The boar kept rising while the asura gave chase,
Vishnu did succeed in keeping her safe.
Blessed Bhoomidevi and he turned to face,
Asura versus god, a war they did wage.

As the hour of twilight draw near,
Brahma spoke to the boar.
Slay him before itâs too late.
It is the hour that favours his might,
Slay him before he grows formidable.
Slay him and rid us of this pestilence

It was not long before Vishnu was victorious,
Hiranyaksha lay slain.
