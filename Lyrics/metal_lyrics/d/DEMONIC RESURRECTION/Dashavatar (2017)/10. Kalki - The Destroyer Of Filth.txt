Evil walks the earth freely, and its supremacy grows strong,
But all hope is not lost.

For when the evil kings will feed on the pious,
Kalki will be born.

In his most human form Vishnu will descend,
With his sword and riding his celestial horse,
He will restore dharma to this world.
He will bring the coming of a new age.

Man made demons, man made gods.
