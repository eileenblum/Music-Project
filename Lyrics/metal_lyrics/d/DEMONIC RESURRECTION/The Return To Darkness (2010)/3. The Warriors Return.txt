And he has returned
From the lands afar
A place thatâs unknown
A realm beyond the stars

He will fight the war
He will save us all
The kingdom long forsaken
Will now be restored

And he has returned
Nemesis of the dark

I breathe new life
I bring you hope
I shall conquer the evil
Their dominion I shall burn.

I see the signs
I read the scrolls
Grim visions of the haunting past
I bring to ruination

I will save this world
From the end of time

So he has returned
The fool, the mortal
He never will learn
That he can't succeed
No mercy shall be shown

Death and destruction
This world will burn
Down to the ground
Annihilated, nothing remains

The prophecy did read that he would one day return
The warrior has returned!
The warrior has returned!

I foresee the darkness will fail

I will save this world
From the end of time

I breathe new life
I bring you hope
I shall conquer the evil
Their dominion I shall burn.

I will save the world
Nemesis of the dark
