Die by my sword, blasphemous demons!
I tear you down, blood stains the earth

Show them no mercy, blasphemous demons!
We slay them as they stand in our path

Kill!
Dismembering the fallen

The ground it shakes
The earth it quakes
Marching forward their armies appear

Stand your ground men
You will fear not the reaper
This is our time and this is our glory

The ground it shakes
The earth it quakes
Brandish thy sword
It's now or never

We must not perish
We fight till the end
See them through darkness
Unto their deaths

I do pledge my heart, soul and body
To give all I have to save us from darkness

I will not follow you into defeat
This is our last chance and we must believe

I will now tear the flesh from their skin
This war be done and a new life begins

I will not spare a single soul
When this is done the story will be told

Charge! Attack!

Torn limb from limb
The bodies are piled
The stench of death and
Vile, filthy, dirty, rotting flesh

Charge! Attack!

The time is now
To raise the blade
And send them back from whence they came
