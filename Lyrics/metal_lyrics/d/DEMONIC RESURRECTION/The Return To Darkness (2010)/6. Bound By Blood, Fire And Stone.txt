Mark my words
The code of the ancient world
To which we must return

Spoken, the words of the prophecy resound
Through the silence of the night
While the world still sleeps

Broken, the honour by which we were bound
But we have returned
To fulfil the promise of the past

Did I close my eyes for too long?
Enough for them to strike you down?
Let it not be so that I failed you
For forgiveness I would not accept

Engraved are the words, forever they hold
Blood of the elders that marked us four
The light of the fire that guides us forth
We are bound by blood, fire and stone

Boundâ¦ as one

Spoken, the words of the prophecy resound
Through the silence of the night
While the world still sleeps

Broken, the honour by which we were bound
But we have returned
To fulfil the promise of the past

Did I close my eyes for too long?
Enough for them to strike you down?
Let it not be so that I failed you
For forgiveness I would not accept

The mouth that bites must not be fed

The code of honour that will guide us on
We stand united in this bleak hour
Go forth into battle, we will march
We shall fight until death and not accept defeat

We are the hope for a new world order
United for the world we stand
We are the four who will end this reign
Of tyrannyâ¦

We stand tall among the multitude
Like gods among the men
We are the ones who will vanquish the dark
Into obscurityâ¦

The mouth that bites must not be fed.

Engraved are the words, forever they hold
Blood of the elders that marked us four
The light of the fire that guides us forth
We are bound by blood, fire and stone

Boundâ¦ as one
