Long was the road to the end
But I fought on
For what I must defend
To fulfil the vow
To return and avenge
To slay their breed
And uphold to the death
What I believe

In my heart I believe
Victorious now I will be

I see through your severed soul
I shall bring your demise

Now as the hour looms near
The darkness wanes
And our path shines clear
We march toward the gates
Where he awaits I will face
My arch nemesis
With the hopes of the world
I march on through...

By my hand
You shall perish
Face my fury
I unleash my wrath

I will not spare the last
The shadows of doom no more shall he cast
Crush his soul into the ground
No trace of the darkness shall ever be found

The warrior has returned triumphant
The kingdom now restored
Above the bodies of a thousand foes
He stands among the gods

Victorious he's returned
The guardian of us all
Avenging our fellow men
He did vanquish them all

The time has come, to leave this world behind
To find new meaning, a new life
This world holds nothing more for me
Its time, to leave it all behind
