This startling confusion of where I am
Floating memories and images drifting
I found myself beyond the stars
Through time and space with darkness leading me

Where dreams and darkness unite
Infinity and oblivion entwine

There is no choice but one
To forge ahead or to retreat
The struggle has begun
The ancient foe I vow to defeat

The startling confusion of where I am
I've journeyed long and here I stand
Poised at the gate to eternity
I'm on my own and I must proceed

Where dreams and darkness unite
Infinity and oblivion entwine

Screams of the dying mortals 
I can hear their screams
Grim visions of the dead
that I dream

Embrace the cause that once united
Break the walls that once divided
Lose not the hope you once had
The dream still lives and I will not fail

At the threshold, one step to change
To make a choice 
I promise that I will not fail

Embrace the cause
Break the walls
Lose not the hope
The dream still lives and I will not fail

Into these dreams of darkness that unite our souls
Into these dreams of sadness forever weâll go 
Forsaking the illusion that turns the flesh from stone 
Forsaking this illusion that binds us to the bone

Weeping words are spoken, bespeak the misery
Time has taken apart what's meant to be
Hope has been shattered, the pieces that you see
Words are shaping, this message I will read 

My choice has been made
I shall return to dark 
This time I do not believe
Death be mine, I canât betray 

I turn the key and lock the gate
Close the door and seal my fate
Take the road that leads me home
Death be mine, I canât betray
