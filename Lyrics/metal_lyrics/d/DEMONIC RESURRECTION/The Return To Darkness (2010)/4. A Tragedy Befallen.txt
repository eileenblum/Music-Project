My blackened heart does still bleed red
I rue the day that I cursed you
And watched you bleed in the cold winterâs night
The light in your eyes still haunts me to this day

I saw the words, and fears in your mind
I knew that you would never forgive me this day

No one will ever understand
The way the world turned that night
We knew not the road, we knew not the path
But you closed your eyes and I led the way

My blackened heart does still bleed red
I rue the day that I cursed you
And watched you bleed in the cold winter night
The light in your eyes still haunts me to this day

I saw the hurt and the tears in your eyes
I knew that you would never forgive me this day

We will find the way out of this place
I promise not to break your faith
This road I've walked before and I know
I'm sorry that I've led you astray

Silence breaks when the clock starts ticking
Our race against time, never ending
This time is slowly running out
This time is slowly running out

A leaf will fall and the earth shall crumble
Deranged visions, my hands tremble
This time is slowly running out
This time has run us out

My oath, my word of honour
The promise I was unable to keep

My truth, still not forsaken
The courage that wonât let me weep

This horror, unseen
My brave face is wearing thin

The tears that run dry
The pain that's mine to keep

My heart is spinning darkness
To this world I don't belong
Fortune is not with me

While the world soundly sleeps
I put back together the broken pieces
Mortal life, immortal sin
I begin my journey once again
