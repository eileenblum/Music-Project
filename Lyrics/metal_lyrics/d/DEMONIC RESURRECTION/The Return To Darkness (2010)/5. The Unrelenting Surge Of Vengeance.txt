The rage, the hate, the anger, the pain
The memories that still keep me awake

The love, the lost, the spoken, the thought
The memories that tear me apart inside

My rage, my hate, my anger, my pain
The feelings that can no longer be contained

My love, my loss, the vengeance I sought
I am now compelled to unleash my wrath

Innocence betrayed and destiny did forsake
The pieces of a tragedy, laid waste

And your blood I will spill to avenge what's lost
You'll seek my pardon and I will not forgive

From the pain I inflict upon your wretched soul
You beg for mercy and I take your life

Fear, you reek
Suffer, you will
Death is inevitable
Time to meet your fate

And your blood I will spill to avenge what's lost
You'll seek my pardon and I will not forgive

From the pain I inflict upon your wretched soul
You beg for mercy and I take your life

Fear, you reek
Suffer, you will
Death is inevitable
Time to meet your fate

I am the hatesphere, engulfed in rage
I am the bringer of death and decay

Of the everlasting pain that I inflict
A man possessed, and I can't be stopped

I close my eyes
And find the strength
To carry on
Without you by my side

I will go the distance, I will not recede
My path is drawn and destiny beckons me
