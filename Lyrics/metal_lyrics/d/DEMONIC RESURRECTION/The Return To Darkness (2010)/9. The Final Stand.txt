We built a kingdom but the world around
Succumbed to the evil that brought us down
There was no reason for us to fail
Or for the castle to crumble this way

We walk down a fallen road
Take back the power we did hold
I will break the walls and tear you down
I will return to claim the crown that's mine

To the end alone
Far beyond and far away
By the blade of my sword
This is the final stand

The world enslaved and by darkness bound
A black veil of evil that still surrounds
The pain of mankind in their eyes
A grim painted picture but we did survive

We claim what was once lost
Take back the hope that we lost
I will raise the blade and I will bring you down
I will prevail and i will not turn around and die

To the end alone
Far beyond and far away
By the blade of my sword
This is the final stand

This life is ours
I am all that you are not
Eradicate the heart
You perish this night

Fire, to dust we all do turn
Fire, to death we will burn

To my comrades fallen
Dead at my feet
Your death will not be in vain

Take me down, where the river flows
