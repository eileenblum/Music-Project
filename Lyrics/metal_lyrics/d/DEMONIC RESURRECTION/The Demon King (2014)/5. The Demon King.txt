Smoke billows from the mountains
Fear grips the villages
It seems the signs were true
The demon king will rise

Legend and folklore did tell a tale
Of a demon so powerful who could not be slaved
He was under a spell of eternal sleep
Never to be awakened, never to be seen

But now it seems
That the legend is true
He has been awakened
This world is doomed

Barbaric and savage, a beastly form
A merciless demon, unleashing a storm
He roamed the lands annihilating all
He did rule the world 'til under a spell he did fall

But now it seems
That the legend is true
He has been awakened
This world is doomed

The human race
Will meet its demise
Once he awakens
There will be no respite from his wrath

Are we doomed to fall?
Is there no way out?
I will fight 'til the end but
I shall not be your slave
