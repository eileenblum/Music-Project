On a darkened day, I did receive, the letter did say, I must return
I asked myself could this be real, in disbelief, my hands did shiver
She feared the worst, I had to leave, the Promise I made, I would return

The Promise I made to you, a Promise I will keep,
believe me when I tell you that I will return from war
The Promise I made to you, a Promise I will keep,
I would not betray you, I did not deceive
Unless death finds me first

Oh lord above,
deliver us all from evil, the battle is lost,
take the darkness away, no more,
this is where I go when all is lost, bow to me

I had to leave my unborn child, devoted wife, to serve my king
Called to war, I had to be strong, my heart did break, her tears did speak
I bid farewell, our hearts entwined, eternal love, I Promised to return

Our last kiss this night,
at dawn I bid good-bye

Engulfed in guilt, my heart is weary,
Each step I take wears me down
The oath by which I'm bound,
This promise will not break me
