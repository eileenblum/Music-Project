A storm is coming
An army of a thousand warriors
A breed of pure evil unlike no other

Overcome with fear I pray to you, lord
Watch over us, father
Do not let us fall

Brace for attack
Retreat is not an option
Fight them 'til death
A merciless execution

A shadow looms
Of fear and desperation
The sound of an army marching
The blade is drawn, we go to war

[2x]
The crushing wave of a mass of demon warriors
Annihilating all that dare to cross their path
Leaving a trail of death and devastation
In their wake, an endless human graveyard

Raised to the sky his mighty sword
An unholy form that shadows the sun
The sweetest taste of victory
The annihilation of man has only just begun

Torture those who survive
The unholy pain of being skinned alive

Show them true meaning of fear
For I will now rule this world
Pray to your father in heaven
All of god's children must die

In their wake, an endless human graveyard
