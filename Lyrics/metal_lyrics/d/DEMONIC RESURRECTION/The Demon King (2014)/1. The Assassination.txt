The king is dead!

Son of God, the ruler of the realm of earth,
He lies dead and lifeless on the throne
Son of God, the ruler of the mortal men,
Bloodshed, assassinated by his own

The son of God has fallen,
We stand alone

Darkness falls, a ruler is no more,
temples burn, a God is now destined to fall
Son of God, in his kingdom lies an empty throne,
Buried, a kingdom now left without hope

The son of God has fallen,
We stand alone
And in this land of fire
We are burning

And there he lies, with a knife through his heart,
Once a warrior now lies dead and cold

Slaughtered!
Maimed!

Turn back the time for it is running out,
all that we've lost is now turning to memories

The pyre
Burns to ashes!

Is this the end of the world?
As it turns and turns around
Will we die, or will we survive?
The coming of the storm
