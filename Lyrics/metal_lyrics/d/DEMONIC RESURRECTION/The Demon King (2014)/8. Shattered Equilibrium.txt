I, watcher from the sky,
surveying all that exists in this universe
I have devised the system of Equilibrium,
perfected symmetry

The structure of existence destroyed,
blurring of the dividing line

I have seen discordance, disharmony,
Equilibrium torn

And then there was disparity, the axis has been shifted
the balance of the world is no longer even
above, from his kingdom in the sky,
he watches

The structure of existence destroyed,
blurring of the dividing line

The unwritten rule in the book of the Gods,
intrude not on the world of men with mortal heart
for their own destiny they will create,
God must remain forever merely a silent observer

The structure of existence destroyed,
blurring of the dividing line

Sleeping demons awaken softly, will he answer their prayers?
In a world where there is no hope, facing death's cold stare,
the balance of the universe must be restored,
a Promise broken but a silent observer no more

Silent no more, rising from his throne,
descending from the heavens

And then there was disparity, the axis has been shifted
the balance of the world is no longer even
above, from his kingdom in the sky,
he watches

The structure of existence destroyed,
blurring of the dividing line

Shattered, destroyed
