"That which is created, can be destroyed"
the golden rule by which he lives,
a craftsman, a wizard, a creator of things,
he is but one from the world of old

The chosen task at hand

And so he will create that which will destroy,
the weapon with powers unmatched,
a warrior is needed to wield the axe,
to deliver judgment, sentence and execute

Old wise wizard, humanity is at stake,
deliver me a hope, do not betray,
grant us this deed and grateful we'll be,
a war is coming and this is humanity's need

"To destroy, to annihilate, to bring to an end,
you must find the weakness of your foe
I will devise a weapon that will slay The Demon King,
the weapon alone won't kill him,
a worthy warrior is needed to wield it, no ordinary man will do"

We will see the dawn this day,
fragments of the world torn
This time we believe he will create,
Architect the Destruction of a God, of a God

GOD!

"Heed my word; this power must not fall into the wrong hands."

Into the wrong hands!
