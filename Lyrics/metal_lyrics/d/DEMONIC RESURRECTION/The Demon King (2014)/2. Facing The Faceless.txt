War, an enemy is upon us,
into this battle we must go,
forward into the unknown,
Humankind alone

His ashes are scattered far, the memories still live on,
we will remember, we will not forget, we will forever live on
Come forth my brothers, this is a call to arms
Come forth united, we're Facing The Faceless

Death, a premonition foretold
This heart must not despair
Undaunted, we will stand strong
Prevailing against all odds

His ashes are scattered far, the memories still live on,
we will remember, we will not forget, we will forever live on
Come forth my brothers, this is a call to arms
Come forth united, we're Facing The Faceless

We gather our forces, our strongest warriors,
we call upon our allies, strengthen our numbers,
an army like a human sea not willing to accept defeat,
we will fight whatever evil comes our way

We took an oath we swore to uphold,
relinquish our spirit and soul,
Fight this battle until the end
'Til the blood is drawn and the ground turns red

The fire's lit, the gates are locked,
the night is here, be on the watch

I know it's there, I feel its presence, I feel the impending doom,
I do not know when they will strike, I do not even know if it's human,
we can only wait and be prepared, be prepared to fight, be prepared to give humanity a fighting chance,
Whatever evil awaits us, we will give it hell
