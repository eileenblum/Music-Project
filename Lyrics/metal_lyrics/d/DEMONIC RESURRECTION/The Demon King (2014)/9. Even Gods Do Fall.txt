War on the threshold between where Heaven and Hell lie,
God against The Demon King, 'til the death they will fight,
the fate of the human race rests in the hands of God
or annihilation, at the hands of The Demon King

The deafening sound of the clashing blades, the war was waged,
a clash of powers that made the universe shake
The balance of the universe must be restored,
this time, God must destroy The Demon King

Dreams of despair and darkness will haunt
the man who believes and fears

And we must not ever lose this faith,
his strength, our prayers will make

And we must not ever lose this faith,
his strength, our prayers will make

Battling from heavens, they descend
TO THE GROUND!

The power of evil has grown strong,
Even a God can't withstand

Weak and Fallen,
the final swing of the blade is made, from the heavens to the grave

And so he's met his demise
on the edges of Paradise
Victorious, The Demon King stands tall,
how can you still believe, when Even Gods Do Fall?
Do you still believe your temple is more than just four walls?
Wake up in the night and find that you're alone,
these dreams of evil, they will take control
