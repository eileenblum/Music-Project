Fear! A blackness is upon us
In holy books inscribed
The signs are now becoming clear

Infect! The frail heart of man
Unable to withstand
The sickness that infects us all, from within

Death, desolation and despair

Fear! The epidemic spreads
The rising count of dead
Far and wide a fear it grips the world

Infest! The soul of humankind
You see it in their eyes,
Disease infesting body and soul before they die

The streets are now deserted
The wind it now blows cold
There is no sanctuary
In a kingdom without hope

Will this come to pass
Just like days of old
Or is there some force evil
Lurking in the shadows

I see a man fallen in the street
His skin has begun to corrode
Eyes that speak of pain and sorrow
A darkness infecting his very soul

His pulse starts racing fast
Gasping for air, he chokes
His trembling body shudders
To his dear life he holds

His bloody, trembling hands
He tries to fight the cold
The disease has now run its course
He lies, a mass of flesh and bone

The houses in the street
Their doors are bolted shut
But death still grips them all
There is nowhere to run

The infection is spreading
Rising, the death toll
Humanity is weakening
To a force unknown
