[Demonic Resurrection - Beyond The Darkness]

...And the dream will cease to exist
For if tears could speak, death would be told

Shaping the destiny that has come into being
Believing the future that would exist
Somewhere along our journey we came to a halt
The world stopped turning and we lament

How far are you willing to go?
How much are you willing to forsake?
If I told that this would mean
That things will never be the same.

Would you still stand by my side?
Would you still battle till the end?
If I told you that from here
There was no looking back

Can I trust you'll be there forever?
Can I trust you'll be there till the end?
Would you save me from tyranny and oppression,
Or would you hold yourself more dear?

One step closer to kingdom come
The throne within my grasp
Seemingly real I feel I can touch it
And the link is shattered
This dream does not exist
One step closer
