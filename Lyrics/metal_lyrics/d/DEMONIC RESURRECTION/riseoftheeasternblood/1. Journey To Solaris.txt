[Demonic Resurrection - Beyond The Darkness]

My shattered soul in torment,
Darkness within me brewing
A thirst for the aging star.

I believe in destiny
I must journey forth

The fallen star lies dormant,
Its power encompassing me,
Drawing me to treacherous deeps.

I believe in destiny
I must journey forth

Nocturnia - Damned visions of nebulous
Nocturnia - Breaking my cold sleep

I believe in destiny
I must journey forth

To Solaris where aeons will be
To Solaris where my journey completes

We will find a way tonight
Through the stars to the other side.

Through darkness, through pain
Through wretched bleeding spawning beasts
Through time, through space
Through tempests passing never ending fields
Storms of cosmic debris

Destroy my world and plunge me intro darkness
These dreams, my dreams of distant memories.

Over the horizon as far as the eye can see
A vision of Solaris, at last my destiny

Soon we shall be one
This journey is complete
