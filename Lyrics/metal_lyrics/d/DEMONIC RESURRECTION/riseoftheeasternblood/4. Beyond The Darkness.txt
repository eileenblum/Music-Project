[Demonic Resurrection - Beyond The Darkness]

The aeons have come and gone
Over landscapes and textures the wind moves their way
Time had laid bare the origin of the One
The cloud of deceit through which we cannot see your face

I hold the key that opens the gates to realms beyond

Beyond the darkness - I'm all that you can see
Beyond the darkness - I control your destiny

What lies in wait behind the shadow of hate?
Are you waiting for the aeons to return?
This place of star dust, magical remains
We transmit illusions through the darkness of space

Shooting stars leave signs and shapes
A cryptic code with a cosmic trace
There is a path to be followed
And there is a choice to be made

The darkness transcends the illusion
Fragmented forms of data remain
Our nexus has been weakened
Evacuate the systems

Beyond the darkness - I'm all that you can see
Beyond the darkness - I control your destiny

The link has been shattered
Transmission of hope is lost deep in space
We must transcend into worlds unknown
Are we destined to ever leave this place?

Darkness is falling and we shall go beyond
Through passage of time beyond the cosmos into the unknown

What lies ahead is not seen
The key to this door belongs to me
This time I shall not fail
This time I shall return

Did I pass the horizon deep into space?
Have I gone beyond; crossed over to a better place?

Do you believe there is a place in the stars where all of us will go?
Do you believe that through this journey of life we have no control?
Do you believe there is a place in the stars where I must go?
Do you believe that through this journey of life I will die alone?
Tonight I wish upon the shooting star to take me away
Far beyond this reality through time and space
This is the time that I close my eyes and dream of thee
And open my heart to the falling stars and weep...
