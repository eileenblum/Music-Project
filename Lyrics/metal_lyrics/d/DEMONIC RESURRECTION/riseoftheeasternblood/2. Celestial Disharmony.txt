[Demonic Resurrection - Beyond The Darkness]

Follow me...over sonic landscapes
Follow me...through intangible shapes
Follow me...down into darkness
Follow me into celestial disharmony

Blackness fills my eyes
I feel these walls caving into me

The system has been weakened
The countdown begins to total annihilation

A shadow in the darkness is all I can see
While everything crumbles to dust and all that's left is me

Benight my heart for in Aurora Borealis
I see her form; to her I must be gone

It is hollow and revolving
Benign lonely planet
A melancholic colour of grace
Journey me away, travelling past the stars
Leaving this place until I find belonging

I'm beginning to believe beyond this time and space

I am but a mere mortal soul
Blacken thy life; this heart, it weeps to belong
For in the stars I see the signs the coming of the one.

The sharp stinging pain I begin to feel
Consciousness slowly dawning on me
Blurry forms and figures cloud my vision
Torn between dream and reality

Here I lie wounded and broken at your mercy
Give me strength to waken my guardian
Before this darkness, consumes me.

In hope they wait for my return
My final stand for glory
Give me strength to waken my guardian
I must fulfil my destiny

Men have tried and died for
The sake of humanity
Give me strength to break them guardian
I will continue my journey
