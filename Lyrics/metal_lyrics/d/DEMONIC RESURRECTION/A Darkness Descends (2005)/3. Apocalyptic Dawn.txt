A shadow falls upon the earth
This is the coming of our nemesis
Slowly we watch as their armies descend
We are prepared for battle
We will fight until the end
Till every soul has passed
Weâll never let them take our lands
Weâll fight them till our deaths

Seek not the coming tranquility in days of darkness that fall
The darkness is spreading fast and its black shroud engulfs us all
And hell descended upon us
Like a raging flame, spreading through the trees
Destroying all life in its path, destruction and devastation I see
Lands of kings and might of men will not reign supreme
In this world thatâs tormented by darkness, infested by demons
The future has been sealed

Up in arms we prepare for the final conflict, prepare for the coming storm
They come from the darkness of the nether regions, seeking power and eternal domination
War Cries, the silence dies
Impeding doom, we shall deny
Sentence all your destinies to the after life, in total oblivion
We shall not fall in darkness, we shall stand and fight
Rid the world from the harness of the evil demons
Over lands and souls of ours, we shall deny them life

King of darkness we wage war on you against your vile plague.
We wont fall before you
Succumb to your sword
We'll wage this war
The shadow of darkness has fallen before us
This war is won
Into the future we step forth
With dreams we go
