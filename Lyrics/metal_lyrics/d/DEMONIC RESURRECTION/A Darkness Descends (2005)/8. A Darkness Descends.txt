Watch me ride
Into the night
As the darkness descends on me
Watch me ride
Into the night

Into the forest I walk alone
Down the winding path, through trees
I feel their eyes fastened upon me
I feel their evil stare

Amongst the shadows I dwell
Surrounded by the darkness
Embraced by the emptiness
I feel the curse upon my soul

Watch me ride
Into the night
As the darkness descends on me
Watch me ride
Into the night

Over the forest a darkness descends
Slowly uncovers the creatures of night
At one with the forest I am
At one with the evil forever

Amongst the shadows I dwell
Surrounded by the darkness
Embraced by the emptiness
I feel the curse upon my soul

Frozen Eyes stare deep inside
Deep inside of me
Darkened shrines breed demon life
Demons for the coming

Watch me ride
Into the night
As the darkness descends on me
Watch me ride
Into the night
