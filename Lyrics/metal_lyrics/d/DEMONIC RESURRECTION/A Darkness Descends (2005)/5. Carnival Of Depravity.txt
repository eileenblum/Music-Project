Infernal forces loom above you
Your journey to depravity begins now

While you sleep, images forming
The blur begins to shape
See him rise before your eyes
And he beckons

Step inside the circle
Where bodies lie waste
Welcome to my show
Malefic and depraved

Silence... breaks the screams
Unveiling

A forsaken land which lies desolate
Home to terror, hidden in wait
A home to your fears
A wailing wind of the chilling kind
Encompasses the circus you find
Encompassing evil

Step inside the circle
Where bodies lie waste
Welcome to my show
Malefic and depraved

Haunting dreams of torture fill your mind
This is a carnival you canât leave behind
Relinquish your spirit to forces unknown
Abandon all hope, as you wont go home

The dancing queens of horror
Demented ogres and fiendish gnomes
All part of the show

The blood stains in ring
Tells the stories of bleak times
Of savage beasts and dying screams
Of the victims that had died

The wicked clowns did run around
To do the ringmasters bidding
