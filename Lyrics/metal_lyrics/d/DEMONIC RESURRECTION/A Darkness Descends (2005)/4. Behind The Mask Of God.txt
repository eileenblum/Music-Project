In him we believe, we pray, we trust
We believe the lie, we believe his existence
Used for control, a source of power
For all that's evil on this earth

Behind the mask of God
Lie cruel human intentions
Used to exploit
The ignorant human being

For him, we give all that we have
But all is lost into the hands of politics
He was made by men, to hold control
Over the masses, the millions of people

Behind the mask of God
Lie cruel human intentions
Used to exploit
The ignorant human being

How much longer will this go on?
How much time will it take?
For the world to realize there is nothing there?
To open their minds to the truth
To show them the real purpose of GOD!

Behind the mask of God
Lie cruel human intentions
Used to exploit
The ignorant human being
