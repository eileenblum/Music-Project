In my dreams, I dream of the living dead
Walking

From the grave a hand appears
I donât know if I'm dreaming
Suddenly before my eyes
Demons begin to appear
They want my body they need my soul to keep their own

Dreams of the dead

Theyâre closing in, Iâm losing speed
I fall they come, to devour me
Suddenly I wake and itâs all a dream

Dreams of the dead

The earth begins to obliviate
Far away from here
Leaving behind no trace
Gone into another world
