Long forgotten, broken skies
New life, denied
Forsaking the journey tried
Passage forth, denied
Left to roam the earth alone
Long forgotten, forlorn
Trapped between worlds unknown
Roaming the mountains in hope

Lost in time, searching souls
Lost forever in worlds
Finding the road that leads to home
Finding the path of snow and stones
Searching for the answer hidden
Searching for the reason

Mountains bleeding, standing tall
Haunting spirits, reborn
Icy peaks breed cold souls
All immortal, never grow old
Sweeping shivers across the land
Feeling their presence at this hand
Slowly descending from worlds unknown
From the old lands, disowned

Lost in time, searching souls
Lost forever in worlds
Finding the road that leads to home
Finding the path of snow and stones
Searching for the answer hidden
Searching for the reason

Spirits of the mystic mountains
They lived forever, lived deep inside
Now youâve uncovered the past you cannot hide
Itâs too late, your dying cries denied

Lost in time, searching souls
Lost forever in worlds
Finding the road that leads to home
Finding the path of snow and stones
Searching for the answer hidden
Searching for the reason
