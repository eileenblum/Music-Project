A silent shiver sweeps the land
An eerie feeling of cold
Far away in the distance
From beneath the snow
I hear the pounding
Of a heart, beating slow
Oh, ice maiden let your heart go

Lost in time, long ago, lost forever
Now I go all-alone, in search of answers

Her kingdom of cold, is mine to find
Her heart Iâll melt, make forever mine
This is my quest and no one can deny me this

Oh ice maiden on thy throne

A shadowed land beneath the snow, conquered not
Land of ice, land of frost, forever been lost

Her kingdom of cold, is mine to find
Her heart Iâll melt, make forever mine
This is my quest and no one can deny me this

Oh ice maiden on thy throne

I hear you call my name
Calling me, again and again
I know there is nothing to fear
But still I fear everything

I found you now and vanquished your throne
Your kingdomâs lost and forever will be gone
