This world of pain and death, hate and tyranny
A war that's left a trail of dead
So many years of darkness pending
So many lives lost in the killing

My tears havenât found their dead
Paint a picture with countless shades of red
This world that lies before us is dead

A shadow covers the sky, and black reigns through day and night
Beware the coming plague upon mankind
But even in time when all hope is lost, we find a ray of hope
The shinning light is a passage to the shadowlands

Guide me master, through the land of darkness
Past the fiends and demonkind
I travel swift among the mist and fog
This journey of mine must be concealed
I will not fail you father
I will not fail you master

The path before unveils past
The darkness leaving me behind
The key to hope is within my grasp

There is hope tonight
Where the shadows lie

I will not fail you now
This task is mine to complete
I shall not fail you brothers
I will come through the dark

Spreading through the world
I can feel the darkness breeding
Time is of the essence and the clock is slowly ticking
The hour of extinction is at hand

Come not without aid by your side
The dark forces have grown stronger from within

Come through the darkness
Bring with you light
There is hope tonight
Where the shadows lie

We shall not bow down before them
Perish we shall, but not enslaved

I will not fail you now
I will come through the dark

There is hope tonight
Where the shadows lie

My tears havenât found their dead

It is not fate intervening
We have carved our destiny
The path has been made
We built this kingdom alone
