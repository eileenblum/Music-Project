You have the wings, which rain can't drench
And still they are trembling beneath the touches of stars
In the massive chords of insane sounds
You are speaking to god, who doesn't see you

Alone with your pain under guard-sheath of the night
Joined by mysterious singing of nocturnal birds

From the light beams to the shadows of the stars
When night is still vernal
Dissapointed by the light in the abysses of dreams
Blackness shadow, uprised angel walking to the dark

You are the Lord of dusk but yet you shine
Fervent heart vestured by the night
Alone with your pain under guard-sheath of the night
Joined by mysterious singing of nocturnal birds

From the light beams to the shadows of the stars
When night is still vernal
You emerge uprose from the darkness of your heart
From life's sorrow, above the upland of glory

You have the wings, which rain can't drench
And still they are trembling beneath the touches of stars
You emerge uprose from the darkness of your heart
From life's sorrow, above the upland of glory

You are the Lord of dusk but yet you shine
Fervent heart vestured by the night
Alone with your pain under guard-sheath of the night
Joined by mysterious singing of nocturnal birds

You have the wings, which rain can't drench
And still they are trembling beneath the touches of stars
In the massive chords of insane sounds
You are speaking to god, who doesn't see you
