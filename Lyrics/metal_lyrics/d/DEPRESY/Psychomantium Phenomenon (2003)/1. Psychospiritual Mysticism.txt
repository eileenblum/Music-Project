Lost Leukaristos
Laugaricio found...
Vagus endeavouring dolomite of Carpathia...
Harmony of spheres in sadness of valleys
Voiceless for three years

In embrace of night music is born
Patron of dark lyrics
That breaks mournful echo of silence

We are bright flame of this ball
Where Muse created flower in dance with PsychÃ©
Founded past of eternal magic
Revealed spell of black art

Star of knowledge is ablazing in reflection under our feet
In its light merged five sights in distance
Now we are standing in cinder, new is melting with old one
Wind kindles only smothering embers
And silence dies drop by drop again...

Between the world of logic and fantasy
Techniques and rituals lies the realm of shadows
Space, which is ruled by mighty hierarchists
Of hermetic illusions

It was rejected as a land of maniacs
Which knowledge is wicked and dangerous
Yird where illusion is the truth
And the truth faded away

Space around which religion raised the walls
Having no courage to enter
Space, which exhausts the soul, perforates feeble mind
And rack - rents the skin off mortal body

So it was rejected as a land of maniacs
Which knowledge is wicked and dangerous
Yird where illusion is the truth
And the truth faded away

When the night ravishes the day
And the twilight choir dies away
Green beam burns the inner flame
Scattered star light rules again
State of holy lunacy,
Domination of shaman's space

Psychospiritual warriors swarm
Invoking rebirth of the 'I'
Via rituals of new aeon
Others, who are not only members
Of existential collapse within space and time
But they are becoming its creators
Supremacy of shaman's space

From the highlands beyond good and evil
Governs entities of astral empire
Through magic rhythm finds the keys
Like a mystic bell into the sleeper's soul

Between the world of logic and fantasy
Techniques and rituals lies the realm of shadows
Space, which is ruled by mighty hierarchists
Of hermetic illusions

Shaman's space
