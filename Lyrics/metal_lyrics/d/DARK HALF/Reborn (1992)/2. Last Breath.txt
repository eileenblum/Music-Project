Faster, save me from this agony
Please, tell me if this is a bad dream
I donât want to die in this misery
Fallen into this weird

[Chorus:]
Iâm living the world
Crossing the deathâs door
Itâs time to meet the dark
When I close my eyes forever

Iâm waiting for my final breath
Forgotten and alone in this place
Without movement, without someone who cares
I hear the screams of the dead

Walking alone, giving my soul
Killing my body, killing my mind
Involved as I was into drugs
Too late to ask for help
