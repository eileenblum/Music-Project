Evil and madness
Control your blindness
Power of masters
Reign of disasters
Dead by the time
I have arrived
He renacido
En tiempo fallido

[Chorus:]
Losing control?
Where is your soul?
Reborn in this world
To take your soul

Humans will pay
And now is the day
But Iâm here
To cure your fear
Dead by the time
I have arrived
Iâll take your soul
âCause Iâm your Lord!
