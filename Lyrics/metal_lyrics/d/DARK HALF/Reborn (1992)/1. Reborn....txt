Open my coffin, my faith falls
Lord, in person, the same, calls
Moving inside the grave
I watch again the daylight

Awake in the dawn
Out from the dark
Walking around
Far from the fog
Dead for centuries
Was like a dream
Now breathing again
With no pain

Chorus:
Arise from the dead
Reborn
Out from my grave
Return
Near to the light
Reborn
Far from the dark
Return

Listen the steps of the dead
Theyâre walking
Look at the men in the end of the edges
Time is forever
Running slower
Final judgment has arrived
