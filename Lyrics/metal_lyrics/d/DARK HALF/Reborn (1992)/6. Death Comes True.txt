Muted senses canât tell me
Where I am and if Iâm free
Time is running, getting away
Covered by doubts
Nothing can be explained

Dead in hell?
Iâm paying all my sins?
Dead in heaven?
I canât stay in here

Touched by the darkness
Feeling the air
Someone to talk
Nobody is nowhere
Praying alone
Waiting the death
If Iâm still alive
And this is the end

Not anymore...

A voice is calling me
Coming through the air
Coming from the darkness
Straight to my brain
Filling my head
Struggling my soul
With no pain
Taking me with...

Calling my name
Striking my fear
Shaking my soul
Freezing in cold
Minutes of terror
No time for error
Mistress of dark
Takes my soul apart

Hear my holy voice
âCause you have no choice
If you want to stay
Youâre going to pay
Repent for your sins
And let me get in
Break up the spell
Donât go to hell

Chained by my reason
In the end of the seasons
Time does not exist
Here where I am
Fighting myself
Pulling the veil
Searching the truth
Beyond the death

Breakable truths is what we have
Untouchable lies is what we make
And a hatred god is what weâve made
But hell is alert to take us in

Donât be afraid of dark
Donât be afraid of light
You have to pass
Beyond the black

This is the death coming true!
