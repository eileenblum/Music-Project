Searching for the entrance of a mystic land
A holy place, unknown to men
Soul adventures, dangerous escape
Fool illusion for the simple mind

Magical experience for the elected one
Heâll explore beyond the life
Heâll become, to the forbidden land
Where evil and goodness look alike

Heâll be lost in the damned land

Thereâs no place for mistakes
Every step is something new
Every error is something worse
Alive or dead, he keeps his fate

He discovers all the truths
About life and death
The price for knowing is very high
And he has to pay with pain and suffering

Thereâs no way to escape
Even dying, heâll return
To be an angel or a demon
Thatâs the end of the voyage

Many lives he will have
Paying sins of humanity
Only then heâll be free
For goodness or evilness

Heâll return again and again
