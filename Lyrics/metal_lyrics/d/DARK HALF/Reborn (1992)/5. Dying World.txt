Dark has fallen, over my path
Another day of despaired wait
Evilâs waiting for any mistake
To make me fall into his reign

Thereâs no excuse to be safe
Thereâs no innocence around this land
Iâm sick of seeing, my heartless town
Crumble down, through the time
Nobody wants to change the rules
To live or die in this emptiness

[Chorus:]
Dying souls
Evil lords
Getting worse
Dying world

Into this dark and madness, you can be lost
Take your dreams from blackness and youâll be free

Day and light, an endless war
A fighting evil, against myself
The path is long to be walked
Another one, controlling me

The fight remains until one day
Light comes true and I will say
Iâm sick of seeing my heartless town
Crumble down, through the time
Nobody wants to change the rules
To live or die in this emptiness

[Chorus:]
Dying souls
Evil lords
Getting worse
Dying world
