When twilight falls over the wastelands
where the tombstones are overgrown
When fogbound clouds embraces the moon
and the stars are shining so bright

You shall dig in the name of the lord
Unchain the powers you've been longing for
Stain the earth with the holy blood
Until the ceremony's complete

[chorus:]
Outnumber the living
The dead shall rise and smell the incense
Unholy resurrection
The dead shall rise and smell the incense

Like weed from hell
the crypts emerges from the ground
The carrions trembles and opens their eyes
and crawls out from the tombs

Eat, devour the human race
Feed upon mortality
Behold and watch as they resurrect
Deliver this gift to mankind

[chorus:]
Outnumber the living
The dead shall rise and smell the incense
Unholy resurrection
The dead shall rise and smell the incense

[Guitar lead by Ulph Johansson]

The night vanishes slowly
but the mist of horror remains
Countless generations are now awake
to infect the earth with this plague

The soil is black and shall so be
for a thousand years to come
Life and death is united
it all is now the same

[chorus:]
Outnumber the living
The dead shall rise and smell the incense
Unholy resurrection
The dead shall rise and smell the incense
...smell the incense!
...the dead shall rise! Rise from their graves!

[Guitar lead by Andreas Johansson of bleeding]
