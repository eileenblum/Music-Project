Count the stains
Read your sins within the blood
Caressing the scorched flesh
Desolated and helpless
With your forsaken soul
crying out in agony

Your lacerated eyes
Gazes straight into death
And the throbbing red stream
keeps ebbing as you stare...

Heading for death
Meet the void beyond the gates
Forever burn in the purgatory
Bloodcurling whisperings
from your lungs, throat and lips
Take my hand and I'll spare your soul
Follow me through eternity
Come to me, I'm bleeding for you

[chorus:]
Lick the wound - let the black blood flow in thee
Lick the wound and feel the rush as life begins again
Lick the wound - to be blessed by the hand of death
Lick the wound, to feel the rush as life begins again

Wrists torn open wide
Pulsating erupting veins
As if the wine of life itself
You shall seek unto it's well

Feast upon the blood of the dead
A gluttony in demonic seed
Suck until the very last drop
Drink, swallow, quench your thirst
A desire deeper than passion itself
Join with me in a crusade for blood,
an everlasting orgasm of ecstasy

Feel the hunger within, feel the ancient lust
Drying veins crying out in pain
Lick my wounds and become one with the night
In the ageless obscured infinity
Close your eyes and greet immortality
Greet the demons' cold embrace
The touch of death shall awake you
let the carnage begin, my veins are open for you

[Guitar lead by Jens Ryden]

[chorus:]
Lick the wound - let the black blood flow in thee
Lick the wound and feel the rush as life begins again
Lick the wound - to be blessed by the hand of death
Lick the wound, to feel the rush as life begins again
