[Cello by Maria Hamrin]

Twelve chimes echo from beyond
Mixed with whisperings from the coldest of winds
Saluting the birth of the darkest hour
The time when spirits are flying free

[Female vocals by Ann Akerman of Lucky:]
The circle of candles is lit
Evocations are spoken by twisted old lips
Summoning of the ones who cannot be named
Invoking the souls of the dead

[chorus:]
Entombed in the midnight hour
The awakening of the dead
Entombed in the midnight hour
Rise and walk the earth

Coffins are lowered into the ground
Mud and earth is torn down and closes the graves
Blood, blood is poured in ancient signs
As abysmal storms brood beyond the trees

The chantings drown in the howling winds
The candles are quenched by whirling restless souls
The ground trembles as more blood is spilled
The coffins open from within

[chorus:]
Entombed in the midnight hour
The awakening of the dead
Entombed in the midnight hour
Rise and walk the earth

[Guitar lead by Ulph Johansson]

The dead have risen from their graves
Awakened by the souls of the ancient ones
The fog of death sweeps across the land
to consume the earth

[chorus:]
Reborn in the midnight hour
We all shall resurrect
Reborn in the midnight hour
We all shall walk... consume the soil...
the dead shall walk the earth
