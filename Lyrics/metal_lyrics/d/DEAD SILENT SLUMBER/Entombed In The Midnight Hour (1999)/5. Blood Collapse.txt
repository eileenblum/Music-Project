Sinister - unholy conjurations
Raises black daggers in the dim candlelight
Rhapsodies - chantings in the night
Words of ancient wisdom, remembered
Open gothic shrines containing human blood
glimmering crimson, liquids of death
Yet unaware, but soon to detect
as these shrines are now burning to ash

[chorus:]
Sulphuric acid flows down the sculpture of clay,
dissolving, corroding it's smooth shape
as skin's dripping from the boiling ravaged flesh
Veins implode in convulsing jerks,
torn as strings which snappes like limbs
Blood collapse - the enigma of melting within
- the essence of death invoked

Burning blood - and shriekings far away
Erosion of the organic tissues inside
Curse of death - inconceivable affliction
Physical leakage by bowels defunct
Bodily deformity
Mutilation of the shattered torso bursting of the strain
Corporal infection, like poisonous injection
An excavation through pus and flesh and bones

[chorus:]
Sulphuric acid flows down the sculpture of clay,
dissolving, corroding it's smooth shape
as skin's dripping from the boiling ravaged flesh
Veins implode in convulsing jerks,
torn as strings which snappes like limbs
Blood collapse - the enigma of melting within
the essence of death invoked

In the unearthly arms of voodoo
Fiery powers unleashed and cast upon you
Scorching deathspells
and soulconsuming spirits nailing the heart

Putrefaction sets in but the eyeball's still see
Beholding this rapid decay
Flesh and bones crumble into dust
and buries the final decomposing bodyparts
in the reeking ashes
Ceremony - the curse is complete
The blood of the victim has collapsed
One again - the unholy preparations
for another ritual has begun

[guitar lead by Christer Bergqvist of Disorge]

[chorus:]
Sulphuric acid flows down the sculpture of clay,
dissolving, corroding it's smooth shape
as skin's dripping from the boiling ravaged flesh
Veins implode in convulsing jerks,
torn as strings which snappes like limbs
Blood collapse - the enigma of melting within
the essence of death invoked
