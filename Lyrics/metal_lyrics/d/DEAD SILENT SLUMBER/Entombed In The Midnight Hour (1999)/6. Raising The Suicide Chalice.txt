Staring on the golden chalice, watching deep into the 
black boiling water inside
In trance you beholds it's swirling dark majesty
as the past flashes before your eyes
Final thoughts written on the parchment
A last memorandum for  the living world
A silence quite as the grave spreads within
and unites with the inner emptiness

So sharpen the blade and open your veins
Lay the noose 'round your neck and dive into death

[chorus:]
Drink from the suicide glass, kiss the venomous lips
Enjoy the taste of death - Raising the chalice!
Inhaling the fumes from the reeking juice,
This is what you chose - Raising the chalice!
Drink, let your soul set free, with a smile you'll see
The false eternity - Raising the chalice!
Now it's time to close your eyes and swallow your pride,
Take the final step - Empty the chalice!

Sip and you will exit this life
and enter the abyss beyond
As rigor mortis sets in, your mind will rise
escaping this useless host
Just a gulp away, it's just to swallow
and then you will feel
Fell how the pain of life
is slowly being drained 

So tear your veins, kiss your wrists
With stainless steel you shall end this misery

Obliteration - the perfect solution
Suicide, the ultimate sacrifice
Mix your tears with the blood and get it over with
Finis malorum - life is complete when you die

[chorus:]
Drink from the suicide glass, kiss the venomous lips
Enjoy the taste of death - Raising the chalice!
Inhaling the fumes from the reeking juice,
This is what you chose - Raising the chalice!
Drink, let your soul set free, with a smile you'll see
The false eternity - Raising the chalice!
Now it's time to close your eyes and swallow your pride,
Take the final step - Empty the chalice!

...and as you weep and falls into eternal  sleep,
drowning in it's nothingness...

[chorus:]
Drink from the suicide glass, kiss the venomous lips
Enjoy the taste of death - Raising the chalice!
Inhaling the fumes from the reeking juice,
This is what you chose - Raising the chalice!
Drink, let your soul set free, with a smile you'll see
The false eternity - Raising the chalice!
Now it's time to close your eyes and swallow your pride,
Take the final step - Empty the chalice!
