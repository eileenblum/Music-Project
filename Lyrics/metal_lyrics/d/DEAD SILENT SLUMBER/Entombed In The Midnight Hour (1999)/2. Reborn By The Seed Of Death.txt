Scratching on the wooden lid, inhaling the coffin air
Slowly opening your eyes,
just to see the blackness of the grave
Dead, but breathing... just silent creeping
From within, the sound of a devilish voice
hissing, whispering, speaking to thee...

[chorus:]
Rise from the grave
You are blessed from the scythe of the grim reaper
From now on you shall walk by his side
to spread the plagues of pain and suffering
For him their souls
For you their blood and the pleasure of dread
Leaving the remains for the earth and the worms...
...and so you are blessed - Reborn by the seed of death

Your pulse grows stronger... Pounding, beating
Chiming like the bells of hell, as if the veins shall burst
Something grows deep within, some infernal embryo
Like a spawn of a demon, of a devil,
of Satan himself, constantly repeating...

[chorus:]
Rise from the grave
You are blessed from the scythe of the grim reaper
From now on you shall walk by his side
to spread the plagues of pain and suffering
For him their souls
For you their blood and the pleasure of dread
Leaving the remains for the earth and the worms...
...and so you are blessed - Reborn by the seed of death

Aeons of death and iniquity
Carry this inheritance throughout the evolution
The lid slams open as the earth gives away
Behold this night, this starclad night of resurrection

[choirs by mattias holmgren of embracing]

Reawakened in pure depravity
Reborn in immortality, in endless sins
Baptized in the ancient ones' blood
You are a spawn of a demon, sent back to life

Reborn by the seed of death

And in the horizon the silhouette of a man is dancing
Swinging his cloak in ritual moves,
holding a scythe raised to the sky
And from his throat comes the words...
...as if reading your mind...

[chorus:]
Rise from the grave
You are blessed from the scythe of the grim reaper
From now on you shall walk by his side
to spread the plagues of pain and suffering
For him their souls
For you their blood and the pleasure of dread
Leaving the remains for the earth and the worms...
...and so you are blessed - Reborn by the seed of death
