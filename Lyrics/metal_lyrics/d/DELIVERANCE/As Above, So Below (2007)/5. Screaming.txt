Silence in the night, in between the compass readings
Pages turn in my head and keep my mind breathing
My eyes close, I take the night flight once again
To where my dreams turn so real, and feel the coming rain

Screaming out, intensity builds
Running from my fear of Hell
Trapped inside surrounding walls
By this power, will I be held?

How long will I allow
This evil to continue
Awake at night until I slip into the dream
Visions screaming in my brain, trying to reclaim

Screaming out, intensity builds
Running from my fear of Hell
Trapped inside surrounding walls
By this power, will I be held?

Careful as I tread the night
Laying on this sea of shattered glass
I need the peace promised, is it waiting there for me?
Or will I once again, meet the black and empty stare?

Screaming out, intensity builds
Running from my fear of Hell
Trapped inside surrounding walls
By this power, will I be held?
