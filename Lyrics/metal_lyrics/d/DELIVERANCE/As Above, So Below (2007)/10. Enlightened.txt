I see the minds of enlightened man forging through the fiery gates
I hear intelligible words of reason foster seeds of love with hate
I smell arrogance dripping from their beings about gods that donât exist
With a smile and a kiss they welcome me thoughts I canât resist
The argument of man against deity with a scientific findings of truth
With more faith than me in a world that finds itself in constant refute

And I read between
All the things unseen

To justify their plans with ministry of absolute defect
And cure the world of a sickness that has plagued us with extreme effect
The need for man to cling to a hope thatâs beyond themselves
And place in reach the firm belief that weâve created our own hell

And I read between
All the things unseen
I hear all the obscene
The wretched human being

Logical sites to contradict the stories we were told
And question the men of truth whose lies slowly unfold
The differences between the worlds are ones of fact and of faith
Either way you paint it, taste it, it all ends with blinding hate

And I read between
All the things unseen
I hear all the obscene
The wretched human being

I hear and see your point of view, and understand the arguments clear
I donât want to end our talk with a fist of rage or a sighing tear
So let it be written, so let it be done, you have your views and I have mine
No sense to argue anymore because at least we agree weâre all part of mankindâ¦
