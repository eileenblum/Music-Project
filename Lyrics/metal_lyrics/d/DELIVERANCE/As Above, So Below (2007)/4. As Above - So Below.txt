The mirror is held up high, reflectionâs hard to see
A darkened view of what this worldâs to be
Illusion is set, and the glassy skies do not exist
As the perfect world stares, the lower worlds persist
Silence is felt as the Spirit moves upon the deep
And chaos finds itâs harmony when dark and light finally meet

Let the mountains shake and the rocks declare your glory
As it is with you, so mote it be with me
Let the rivers run strong and all nature bow with humility
As it is with you, so mote it be with me

Quicken the hearts to âreceiveâ the unfettered plan
And lose yourself in the eyes of an egoless drowning man
Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done both light and in the dark
In my body the Holy Name, I bear the mark

Let the mountains shake and the rocks declare your glory
As it is with you, so mote it be with me
Let the rivers run strong and all nature bow with humility
As it is with you, so mote it be with me

Your creatures turn to sedition, has the ocean lost its way?
In matters of transition, reflective powers fight decay
I see through the crystal haze to find myself again
How is it that beauty only reflects disdain?
As above â so below in light and in the dark
In my body, the Holy Name, I bear the mark

Let the mountains shake and the rocks declare your glory
As it is with you, so mote it be with me
Let the rivers run strong and all nature bow with humility
As it is with you, so mote it be with me
