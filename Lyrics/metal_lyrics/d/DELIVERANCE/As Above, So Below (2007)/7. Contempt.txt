You stole from my life and the endearing part of my youth
You led me thru and all around in your circus you called âtruthâ
Take a knee and learn to submit, itâs the only way!
You said it was to God, but somehow you were always in the way

Never again â Never again â never again
Will I submit to you!
Never again â Never again â never again
Will I bend to you!

With trembling hands, I remember terror when I look at these scars
The tears of hate would roll as I ponder how youâd go so far
Scatter the sheep, and the shepherd moves in for the kill
Shear the little ones many times, skin them only once of their will

Never again â Never again â never again
Will I submit to you!
Never again â Never again â never again
Will I bend to you!

You prayed for the well, while the sick couldnât make it to the stage
Performed ill-licensed counsel while playing the role of a sage
I learned to hate myself, to be ashamed of what I feel
Unable to determine from what is a farce and what is real

Never again â Never again â never again
Will I submit to you!
Never again â Never again â never again
Will I bend to you!
