Iâve turned the other cheek, now your time is due
No plans for limitations of what I will do
With a crushing blow you will feel my hand
Striking on you like the grains of sand

You have done us wrong, no more we will take
The chips are all in, thereâs too much at stake
Your raping force has caused nothing to lose
Your waiting demise will be courting the muse

Weâve had all that we can take!  Nothing more to have!
The Worlds disintegrates, should we cross paths!

Justice lies beyond the Wailing Wall
To cleanse the threshing floor of failings all
A cure for humanity, to eliminate the waste
Should we cross paths, my victory youâll taste

Weâve had all that we can take!  Nothing more to have!
The Worlds disintegrates, should we cross paths!
