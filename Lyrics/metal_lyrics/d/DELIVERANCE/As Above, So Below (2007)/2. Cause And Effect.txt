Blame the gods for the deeds &amp; wills of violent men
Forced inception interrupts the plan
Create the lies &amp; breed the hate
Feeding of the lions to commemorate

Zero tolerance for Biblical creed
Anti-Christ laying its seed
Mark the words written on the wall
Truth divides how the mighty will fall

Saddened by the weak minded thoughts of ill mankind
Sadder still is when I look in your eyes
Create the hate &amp; breed the lie
Dividing forces into millions, the world dies

Zero tolerance for Biblical creed
Anti-Christ laying its seed
Mark the words written on the wall
Truth divides how the mighty will fall

Have you not seen?  Have you not heard?
The day of shadows is at hand!
Your eyes have seen!  Your ears have heard!
Decree this hour unto man!
