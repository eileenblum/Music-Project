Alas, the years have, have fallen upon us
Thru the storms and seeing the lighted end
Weight lifted in times for the rush
Remember when you first came into my sight

I fell just like a dream, it seems so long ago
Conscience, it did not take long
To see all that you were to me
My love, all that I am is yoursâ¦

Soaring on the wings, they caress you in the dark
Listen to the waters that calm us in surreal
Believe the Faith thatâs led us this far
Emptiness filled by all that we feel

I fell just like a dream, it seems so long ago
Conscience, it did not take long
To see all that you were to me
My love, all that I am is yoursâ¦

Amazed at the heights, surround my total being
A wall, a sigh, a whisper ignites
Time will tell fantasyâs withheld
Insurmountable force, turning wrong to right

I fell just like a dream, it seems so long ago
Conscience, it did not take long
To see all that you were to me
My love, all that I am is yoursâ¦
