A tour de force, the old school returns to form
Sounds to me like an overdose of chloroform
Iâve read beliefs and values that bend the scene
A fine line between ideals and obscene
The people say they want the past come born again
Regurgitate the truth from lies, see how it bends
Plagiarize the greatest story ever told
Play the bluff on the cards to see who first folds

Character flaws seems to be the latest trend
Like looking for lost loves by simply clicking send
Zeroes and heroes returning from their graves
To spread the hatred cloaked with the words âJesus Savesâ
I never understood the need to criticize
In same likeness so far my words ostracize
The pointless task to tell what you already know
The course endeavor of sailing high and staying low

Return to form

Time marches on, yet in a circle we run
The cowards way of dying, whilst I reflect the sun
I find myself in the same sea I once escaped
Shipwrecked again while I brave the waters that rape
The fire burns, surrounding smoke to block the view
Creation to serration, despair ensues
Iâll pursue it once, maybe twice to avoid conform
The bastardized approach, the dregs return to form

Return to form

A tour de force, the old school returns to form
Sounds to me like an overdose of chloroform
Iâve read beliefs and values that bend the scene
A fine line between ideals and obscene
The people say they want the past come born again
Regurgitate the truth from lies, see how it bends
Plagiarize the greatest story ever told
Play the bluff on the cards to see who first folds
