And there he stood so very still
His weary eyes gased
Into the open sky
Voice of Jehovah breaking
Through the den of noise
For his humble servant to hear

Now take your son, your only son
The one I know you love so dear
Land of Moriah calls
A place for worshipping
A place to sacrifice your son to me

And if we're still, so very still
Our eyes gasing into the heavens
Voice of Jehovah will break through
Teh cares of this world
For all his children to hear

Love his son, his only son
The one who draws us near
Voice of Messiah calls
A time for worshipping
A time to sacrifice our hearts to Him

In the will
