Memory of myself the slave
Realize the one who brought the pain
Looking back, I feel the need to blame

It was then I cried

Help me
I know you see
And I'm all tied up
Help me
Set me free

I've seen the rain
And I've felt the pain it brings
Remembering me
The life I lived
The toll it took
The night you found me in the rain
