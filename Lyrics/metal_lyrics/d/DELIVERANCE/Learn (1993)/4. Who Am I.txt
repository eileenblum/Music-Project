Who am I to say what's right
Or for that matter to say what's wrong
What am I but a man
With big ideas but small plans
Guess I'm not much
Different than some

I found it hard to believe
That my brother would deceive me
Am I to assume that he
Meant to do right?
I now know he's not what I believed

Who am I but a man
Your eyes see just who I am
Who am I that you are mindful of me
Lord crash down these walls and
Remind me of who I am

I'm questioning
What's in the heart of a man
That makes us cling to what is wrong
Second birth causes me to
See the distance
From flesh to the spirit is long

Who am I but a man
Your eyes see just who I am

Not anything you've done
That I haven't done
Not anything in which Christ
Was not tempted
Not any crime for which
We're not criminals
Deserving to hang from that tree

Crash down the walls Lord
