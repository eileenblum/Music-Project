Time - it said will tell
Time - will always take away
Time - reveals the signs of age
When youth has passed away

Time - I feel it lurking here
Time - I see it coming clear
Time flies when there's peace of mind
How it's measured in the rough
Like one being so unkind
Rising from the dust

Time - we live by it's counting
Time - the beating of the drum
Time - it tells us when we can
Or what we cannat do

But our GOD is not held by time
Nor is He restrained
By it's hard bindings

Like chaff blowing in the wind
Time exposing your sin
Appearing clean
But hiding evidence within

When will we escape the strongholds of time
