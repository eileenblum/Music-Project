As I start to pen my thoughts
A rush goes through my head
Memories of 1990
Slowly passing by
I can still feel the pain
Like a sword pierced my heart
Selfishness, robbing me of you

I would always talk to you
But now not for days
I was slowly leaving you behind
Caught up her in what was going on
(It seemed so important then
but looking back now I see)
I didn't see what was ahead

Where did I go
What did I do
I let myself become king
I've seen where I've been
I know what I've done
It's time to let go and forget 1990

Again I'm here to pen my thoughts
Rushing wind blows through my head
Memories of 1990
I guess I'll always feel the pain
Feel the pain pierce my heart
Selfishness robbing me of you

Where did I go
What did I do

I let myself become king
I've seen where I've been
I know what I know
It's time to go on and forget
