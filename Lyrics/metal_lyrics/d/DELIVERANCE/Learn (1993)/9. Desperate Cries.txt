I see the cars passing by
Countless people walking the streets
Desperately hurrying to
Where they must go
Living a life
Believing a lie
Refusing to see what must be shown
They're dying

When we know the truth
We hide it all away

Who'll speak the Father's words
Can you hear them crying
With desperate cries

The cries of the children all around
Being robbed of their innocence
Learning and seeing the depravity
Of a nation gone to hell
We must give His truth unto them
They're dying
Can you hear them crying
With desperate cries
