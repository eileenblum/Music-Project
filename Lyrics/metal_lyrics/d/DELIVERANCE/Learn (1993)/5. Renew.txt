You tell yourself that you've been had
'Cause even dead you still seem sad

Robbed of your peace of mind
Letting the cares of this
World take control
Why don't you just pass it by
Allow the renewing of your mind to
Take it's place

Was it better for you when
You were alive
Rotting contentedly in your old life

Strung out on what you can find
Injecting confusion to the new found grace
Why don't you just let it go
Allow the renewing of your mind to
Take it's place

Even dead you still seem so sad
Get a life and make us all glad
The stench dwells
All around you
Get a life, let light surround you

Robgbed of your peace of mind
Letting the cares of this
World take control
Why don't you just pass it by
Allow the renewing of your mind to
Take it's place
