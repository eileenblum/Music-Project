Should the stars get in
Your eyes tonight
Remember - remember - Love
And should the strong winds
Become far too much
Remember - remember

Your sanctuary

Should you come into
The promised land
Remember - remember
From where you came
And if your greatest fears are realized
Remember - remember

Your sanctuary

Hush pretty baby and don't you cry
Your daddy's here so
Brush the tears out of your eyes
Brush them from your eyes

Should you find you have
The things you need
Remember - remember - Me
And should the moon turn red
Stars leave the sky
Remember - remember

Your sanctuary
