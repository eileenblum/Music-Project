There is only right and wrong
There is no in between
The enemy will only blind your eyes
And make it all unseen
You must open blinded eyes
Open all to see
Spirits of Hell are calling
Beckoning calling thee

The bloody cross, it stands alone on a hill
It cries out to the souls of men
Accept Him if you will
Jesus comes that you might have life
Satan comes to kill
There's really only one choice, my friend
Choose Christ if you will

Whether you know or don't know
The Word of God is true
It's a double edged sword
Ripping the heart in two
The day to choose is near at hand
Your ending is drawing near
It will either be the King Jesus
Or the defeated one Satan
