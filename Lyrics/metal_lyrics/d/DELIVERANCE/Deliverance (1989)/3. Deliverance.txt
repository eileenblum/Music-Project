Look around
Tell me what you see
People running nowhere
Thinking they're free

The path they're on leads to destruction
Do you see?
They think they're having fun
But it's just a fantasy

We've been sent from the Master
We've been sent with a message to hope
We've been given the keys to the Kingdom
To unlock the chains and bonds
Deliverance

Look at yourself
Tell me what is there
The enemy has your life
But do you really care
