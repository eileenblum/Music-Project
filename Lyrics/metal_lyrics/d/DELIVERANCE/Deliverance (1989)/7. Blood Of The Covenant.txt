Without the shedding of the Blood
There is no remission of sin
The hour the veil was wrent
That is when it all began
This was not the covenant that was made with our Fathers on Sinai
The Blood of the New Covenant shed for the remission of sin

A man hanging on a tree
His blood gushing from His own flesh
Will you dare commit
Or be another to fall at Satan's hand
The Blood of the Covenant
A testament
A remission of sin
