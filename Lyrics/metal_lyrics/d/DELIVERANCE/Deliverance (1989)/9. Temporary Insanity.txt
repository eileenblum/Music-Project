Insanity is filling me with unreality
My mind is a it of morbid fantasy
The more my mind wanders
The more I indulge of a fantasy so un-utterable
The more real it becomes

[Chorus 1]
Imagine I am the king and you are the queen
You lied and said you would set me free
Of this temporary insanity

I look in the mirror and what do I see
That I have become an image of Thee
To take your own life is what you have schemed
But for some reason unseen
The victim is me

[Chorus 2]
The ultimate selfishness
To not care for no one else
Because all I think of is me
In my temporary insanity

[Bridge]
I look in the mirror and what do I see
That I am you and you are me

Insanity is filling me with unreality
My mind is the pit of a morbid fantasy
The more my mind wanders
The more I indulge of the fantasy that was so un-utterable
The more real it has become

[Chorus 3]
I have fulfilled my fantasy
I learned it was I who lied to me
Now I burn eternally
in my temporary insanity
