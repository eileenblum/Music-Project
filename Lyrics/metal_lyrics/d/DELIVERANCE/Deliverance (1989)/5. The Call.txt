I was once blinded by Satan
I had no friend
I was a prisoner of these
Of these four walls that surround me
But then

[Chorus 1]
I heard him
A voice calling me
My answer to all

My friend, you know the answer
But will you heed the call
I know you want to reach out and touch Him
But He can't answer if you don't ask at all

[Chorus 2]
Do you hear Him
He's calling out to you
Do you hear Jesus calling?
He's calling you
