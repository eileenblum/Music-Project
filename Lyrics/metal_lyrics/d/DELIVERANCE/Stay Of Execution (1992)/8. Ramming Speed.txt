Slaves to the King of Kings
And slaves to love
Steer the ship by the sweat
Of our brow and beat of the drum

War against sin with the weapons of our unity
Right on the mark with a love for humanity

Building up to ramming speed...
The power of God is ramming speed...

The sea is raging, there's the enemy ahead
On fiery waters float the bodies of the dead...

We count our casualties, but we'll never stop
Set the captives free with a strike against the enemy
We'll live to tell the tale of bravery and gallantry

Building up to ramming speed...
The power of God is ramming speed...

[repeat 1st verse]
