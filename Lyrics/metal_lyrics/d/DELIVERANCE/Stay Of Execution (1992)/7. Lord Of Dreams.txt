Sunlight is pouring all over me
The cracks in the window blinds
Tell me I'm free

But in the night when fear paralyzes
Allowing no pathway to see
Weighted eyes close and blood pressure rises
I'm traveling where this slumber leads

Into the dark, crawl inside your mind
To worlds hidden by night
Visions and nightmares, or just another dream?
One step away from the light

They say to ignore most of what
I might find there, I fear I'll
Spend most of my time there

Dream control is so hard to achieve
Mastered through some evil scheme
There is one way followed without fear
Make Jesus the Lord of your dreams

Out of the dark and into the light...

[repeat 1st verse]
