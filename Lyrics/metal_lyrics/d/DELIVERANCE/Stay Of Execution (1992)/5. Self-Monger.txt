Hard not to get caught in the world and
Its thoughts when this mad world keeps
Blocking your view
Through a slap in the face or a kiss concealed hatred
Reality keeps pushing through
Keeps pushing through

But what do you win if you gain the world
And lose your own soul?

Selfishness reigns where there is no one kind
Though most of the time it's not me
Now and again I'm the center of light and
This selfmonger longs to be free...

But what do you win if you gain the world
And lose your own soul?

Segueways of illusion invade while I'm sleeping
Come vision to taunt me again
Where am I going, what am I becoming?
A selfmonger dying within
Dying in sin...
