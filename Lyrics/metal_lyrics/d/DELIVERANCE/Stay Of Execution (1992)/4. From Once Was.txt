Unfortunate souls will often say
We need to cling to yesterday
An evil there or light to see
Gives of hope of what might be

Faith gathered from "once was"
Hope gathered from "once was"
Peace gathered from "once was"
Love gathered from "once was"

I dream the past, the burning bridges
Old photographs, discarded pages
Unanswered prayers, the childhood endings
The bitter tears, the new beginnings

The life and times of a child alone
Searching for love in the cold unknown
Soul beat and scarred with the truth in sight
The lessons he's learned in the darkest night

I dream of youth and unrequited love
There lies the truth, in what once was

And through it all I see at last
The Saviour's hand and all that's past

Memory is clear, Saviour drawing near
Feel my heart embraced, see desire's face
Here my soul will rest

The answered prayers, the childhood endings
The bitter tears, the new beginnings
The new beginnings...
