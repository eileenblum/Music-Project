Strong is your hold, oh mortal flesh
And now I've fallen to you again
Mighty's the faith that overcomes
But somehow you always seem to win

Stay of execution
Stay of execution

On the straight and narrow path of life
The word always comes to lift me up
Brings me to my feet when I fall
But you lie in waiting to bring me down

Stay of execution
Stay of execution

And so the struggle still goes on
Between the spirit and the flesh
Knowing His Word will make me strong
For the tormenting of my flesh
Stay of execution...
