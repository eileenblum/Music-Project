Too much time on my hands
I've learned to love the night
It's disguised itself to appear like the light

Takes me by the hand
And reminds me that a wrong is sometimes right

And I know the state I'm in can't last
But the closet's bursting with the force of rage
From the demons in my past

And she stands and stares with eyes of disbelief
And makes me feel so alone
Awaiting to relive the sight unseen
From the seeds that I once sowed

But that's not me anymore
I've sought and I've grown
But that's not me anymore
