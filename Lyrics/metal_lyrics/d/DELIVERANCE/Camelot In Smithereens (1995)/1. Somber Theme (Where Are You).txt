To the four corners and beyond
From the ghettos to the farms
Babies born / Babies die
Poor are broken / Rich are strong

Where are you?

There still are lies / And always truth
Hershey Bars and Baby Ruth's
Power's both weak and strong
For one right / There's plenty wrongs

Where are you?

Choices made / Even if not to choose
Deciding when or what to use
Wars will start / Wars will end
Pending on which side will bend

Where are you?

Hiding in a glass asylum
Living on and off your own kind
Ignore the world around you
Hoping for a new mankind

Medicine cures / Disease kills
Desert sands / And grassy hills
Grace abounds / Yet so does sin
But not for you in your world within

Where are you?

Close your eyes so you can see
The river flooded with mercy
There's so much more that we could do
Break the glass between me and you

Electric blue / translucent green
There's more than what our eyes have seen
A world of love / A world of hate
Bleeding hearts / For you they wait

Where are you?
