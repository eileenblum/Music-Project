From up here it all looks the same to me
A different point of view is what I know I need
What you say

I look around this sea of souls
But all I see is one face
The eyes all blend into one color
There are no features to trace
The more one looks
The more one's drawn
To simply stay away
But I can't wait to leave this top
And be with You in the start of a new day

But for now I just sit here on my red roof
Looking for Your face /
But the clouds are in the way
And still I stay here longing on my red roof
I wait for You to steal me away

The days drag pass me /
And I hear the clock ticking in my head
The weather is muggy /
As I make the shingles of my bed
The air is hot /
But I feel fine -
When I hear the breathing of her wind
Though it feels like I will never see You once again

I close my eyes and I drown in thoughts
That swirl in my head
Waiting for you...

But for now I just sit here on my red roof
Looking for your face /
But the clouds are in the way
And I still stay here longing on my red roof
I wait for you to steal me away.
