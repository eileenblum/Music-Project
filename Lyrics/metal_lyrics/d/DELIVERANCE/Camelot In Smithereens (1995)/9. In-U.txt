The day light is coming
But it's borrowing that gets me down
But I know He's coming
For it's He that gave my sight &amp; sound

I was trying to get out of here
By following an aspiring dream
Of living life large in this scene
It was then I awoke

The daylight is coming
But it's borrowing that gets me down
I don't lie to you
But I know He's coming
For it's He that gave my sight &amp; sound
My sight &amp; sound

I looked around and saw I was poor
With a stack of bills that came from the store
So I grabbed the Holy Book from my room
And I read that I was rich... in U
I know that He sees when I cry
And I know that he hears when I sigh
Life will be complete - when I see your face

The daylight is coming
But it's borrowing that gets me down
I don't lie to you
But I know He's coming
For it's He that gave my sight &amp; sound
My sight &amp; sound

Ain't it funny how it is
Just when I thought my life was through
It was then that I found my faith
in the fact that I believe...

in U
