I look at the ocean /
Oh so cold &amp; black
It's never ending mystery
I look at the sky /
So polluted &amp; cracked
A reflection of the sea
I'm closed in /
No where to turn
The four sides of this river have my mind in a swirl
All alone /
And I hear my heart breaking
The end result from all that I'm taking

But I know

If I make my bed in hell /
You're with me
If I dwell in the depths of the sea /
You are there

Reality check /
Is coming down
Sweat pouring off my face like rain from the clouds
I feel it coming /
Oh yes but I can't see it yet

My eyes are waterlogged from this yoke of oppression
My God / Let me hear Your voice
A sense of doubt remains /
My life becoming a void

I'm slipping

If I make my bed in hell /
I know You're with me
If I dwell in the depths of the sea /
You are there
If I chose the darkest corridor of time
It's only cause I was blind
But I feel the edge of the mercy shores
And it tells You are with me
