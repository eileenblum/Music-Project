[written by David Bowie]

Weaving down a byroad
Sing the song
That's my kind of highground
Gone wrong
My-my
Smile at least
You can't say no to
The beauty and the beast

Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong
But darling, something's in the way

There's laughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned
How???

My-my
Someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to
The beauty and the beast
Darling

I wanted to /// believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should

Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God Heaven left us
Standing on our feet

My-my
The beauty and the beast
