Forming the water around me /
I was protected from the truth
Innocent cries /
A child's closed eyes /
How I was to know
A normal life growing up /
Taught wrong from right /
The does &amp; don'ts
Then the world's sphere got off it's spin /
And threw me in a new mold

I'm on the shelf
At 15 I fell in love /
And ran away from life
I didn't know how to feel /
But what I felt sure felt right
5 years later /
I met this girl /
And she showed me the light
The plot twists and turns /
Leaving one for the other
In order to be saved?

Now I stare at the readings of my life
Page after page /
They don't paint a pretty picture of me
Eyes wide /
As I pull another book from off the shelf
When does the heartache end /
Of a life torn between
These 2 book ends

Life is a tale told by a fool /
Signifying nothing
I thought what I did was right /
By leaving the past behind
But now all I see is a trail of pain and misery
So I beg you to search your heart /
Or might your books read like these

Now they stare at the readings of my life
Page after page /
They don't paint a pretty picture of me
Eyes wide /
As they pull another book from off the shelf
When does the heartache end /
Of a life torn between
These 2 book ends...
