[1]

The changing times have caused me to see me for what I am
But I know you /
You taught me oh so well to just ignore
Ignore the things my heart beats for

Life with you /
It's complicating - like a crowded room
I thought you had died /
But with morning rise I see your still alive

[chorus]

And I can't let go /
Even though I know your not too good for me
It's a terrifying flight /
When darkness over rides her light
But I can't let go /
Won't let go /
Can't let go
Even though I know your not too good for me.

[2]

The time's we've had /
Were so much fun and me I loved to laugh
But something's wrong /
My rebirth came and said that we can't last
Cut the cord and place you in the past

But I still love /
The things we did together once before
And now I'm torn /
Between new life &amp; an open sore

[chorus]

And I can't let go /
Even though I know
Your not too good for me
It's a never ending flight /
That only leads me through the night
But I can't let go /
Must let go /
Can't let go
Even though I know your not too good for me
