King of Kings, Lord of Lords,
Emmanuel God is with us
First and Last, He erases past,
He's Lord and King
He's everything
High Priest touched with feelings of our infirmities
Advocate, One with God, the True and Only Son of God

Jesus is God
Jesus is God
Jesus is God

King of Kings, I am is He, 
He's coming back to rule this
Land with swift sword in hand,
All the gods, of gold and stone, will fall
before Him when they see His eyes of fire

Jesus is God
Jesus is God
Jesus is God
Jesus is God
