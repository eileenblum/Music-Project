I am your messenger 
and your plea has been granted
You must leave at once, go back to your planet
Your time is limited so go at once to those
Who you're going to warn of your new God forsaken home

Don't play games with God this Hell we heard of is real
Don't ignore the preacher when he says the thief comes in to steal
Don't be fooled this world ain't worth damnation's fee
Or come live in the fiery pit with me

Awake
