An innocent man's blood was shed
Foretold this was in past
It will cleanse the people of their sin
Forever the covering lasts

The sacrifice has now been made
We are saved by His blood
Having done all to stand
In victory from above

[Chorus]
There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel's veins
The price has now been paid
For you

The time has come for you to choose
Choose whom you will serve
As for me and my band
Christ we have chose to serve

[Chorus]
