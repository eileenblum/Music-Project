I've been through the day and I don't have the time
To speak unto friends or to speak Lord to You

There is only one thing on my mind
And that is pleasing myself which I've no time to do

[Chorus]
No time, no time
That's my constant cry
No time to help those in need
At last it's time to die
No time

At last before the Lord I came
I stood with downcast eyes
He held a book in His hands
It was the Book of Life
He opened up the book and said, 
"Your name I cannot find
I was once going to write it down
But I couldn't find the time."

God opened up His book and said, 
"Your name I cannot find
I was once going to write it down
But I couldn't find the time."

[Chorus]
