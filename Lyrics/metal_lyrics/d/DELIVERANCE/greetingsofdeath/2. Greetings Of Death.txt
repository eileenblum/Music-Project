It has been appointed once for a man to die
but after this the judgement
Once the appointment has been made
nothing can be done to change it
no need to be afraid of the greetings of death
will you be wrapped in the chains of torment?
or pass from life unto death?
the power of death knows not one
but to live you must die
life is for those who have offered their lives
to live is Christ to die is to gain
are you afraid to die?
