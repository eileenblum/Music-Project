There's something in the words being said
Between the blurry lines
The fury and worry inside your head
Ignore all the posted warning signs

Picture this, a perfect world inside
The firmament is reflecting all
Tightly woven shroud engulf the mind
The silent film that's showing your fall

You've been suckered, you believe it all
A victim of the selling game!
There is hope, just believe The Truth
It's out there waiting, waiting for youâ¦

It's not impossible, it's not worse than that!
An answer lies in wait, just see!
It won't come easy, friend that much is fact
Seek and you'll find, the righteous path will beâ¦
