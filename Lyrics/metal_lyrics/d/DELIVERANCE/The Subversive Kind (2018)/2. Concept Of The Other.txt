Prejudicial blinds, become the dark veil of truth
A guilty eye for an eye, a bloody tooth for tooth
Call attention to the differences in their belief
Selling God with different names, the educated thief

We've clearly drawn the line
Oh who to justify to hate
Reasoning by law and love
The blindfolded one has sealed their fate

They seem to think that we serve the same God
All rolling out their mats or sealed in their pods
If only I've seen Christ in the way some live
The more we push and take, the more we make them give

We've clearly drawn the line
Oh who to justify to hate
Reasoning by law and love
The blindfolded one has sealed our fate

And though we pretend and come off so concerned
The misread parables incentive what we've learned
The price of human life, we somehow think we've earned

We've clearly drawn the line
Oh who to justify to hate
Reasoning by law and love
The blindfolded one has sealed their fate
