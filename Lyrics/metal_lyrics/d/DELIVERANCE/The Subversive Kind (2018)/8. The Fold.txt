Wait! There's something not right here
It creeps in like nightmares and pumps me full of fear
Why? Should this be happening
Disarm me by frightening
It's all too alarming

I won't give up, won't take the bait!
I'll see it through
I'll run the course
It's what's at stake!
Too easy to fold, easy to give in!
Not let them control me
Keep fighting for the win!

Lies! They all surround me, in fÃ¤lschen commodity
In hopes of disposing
I won't let faith unravel
Crushing down the gavel
Awaiting arrival

I won't give up, won't take the bait!
I'll see it through
I'll run the course
It's what's at stake!
Too easy to fold, easy to give in!
Not let them control me
Keep fighting for the win!

I won't fold!
