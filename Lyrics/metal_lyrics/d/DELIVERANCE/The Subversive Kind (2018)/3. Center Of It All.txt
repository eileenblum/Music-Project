You crave it all, to be the noticed one
What's really in your head when the day is done?
Are you really that self-absorbed you cannot see?
Your thought process is your centricity

You really are the center of it all
The other names you can't recall
You really are the center of it all
The ditch is dug, waiting for your fall

You've got nerve to proclaim the truth
Poisonous lies infection surround
Double minded is what you are
Duplicitous, it has taken you far

You really are the center of it all
The other names you can't recall
You really are the center of it all
The ditch is dug, waiting for your fall

I look at you and see myself, image of what I used to be
Don't get me wrong I'm not your judge
Just calling out what I see
If you heard half your BS, you might understand what I mean
The limpid, the crimped, the crawl to a slow insanity

You really are the center of it all
The other names you can't recall
You really are the center of it all
The ditch is dug, waiting for your fall
