Insurrection, a call to the unrest
The revolt puts courage to the test
Retake, repossess powers that be
The harmless dove subdues so subtly

But I'm not the subversive kind
I'll give you products of a disturbed mind
But I'm not the subversive kind
Be careful of what is hidden behind
Lock me up in a cell or padded room

A carriage ride to the impending doom
Circle is broken but will soon mend
A stress test to see how far you'll bend
You'll see them rise, numbers like the sand
While the world runs for a shelter less land

But I'm not the subversive kind
I'll give you products of a disturbed mind
But I'm not the subversive kind
Be careful of what is hidden behind

Pick the locks with a pocketful of keys
No use for reason is the decree
Proprietary on the contrary

Propaganda is all you see
When it comes, no use to resist
The result being added to the list
