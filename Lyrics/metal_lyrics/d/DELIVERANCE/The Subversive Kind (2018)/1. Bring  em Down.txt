Superficial views of what my life's supposed to be
Abnorm is norm, we adopt a fractured reality
Shattered image, human frailty is wide awake
Polished gems, a golden hue of idols that we make

The censorship is real, but we're all afraid to look
And put our trust in a man, ignoring the lives he took
The bets are 5 to 1, 1 and 5 to mark the damage we'll make
Slavery prevails, the zombies walking tall
A game of give and take

Give and take! Bring 'em down!

Misled, misunderstood, misinformed!
Red, white and blueâ¦and green
The only colors that we see

Did you stand in line? Did you partake in atrocity?
Did you replace logic and reason for a misplaced reality?

Bring 'em down!
