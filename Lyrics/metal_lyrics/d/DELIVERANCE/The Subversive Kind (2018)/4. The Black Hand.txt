Gasping for air, heart rate rises
Impending doom awaits
No danger in sight, only feel fear
Neurosis waits for you to take the bait

And when it comes in day or night
Your senses numbing rob you of sight
A sense calm it brings you down
Chemical reaction ensues

Nerve endings climbing, pupils dilating
De-realization propels the cues

And when it comes in day or night
Your senses numbing rob you of sight
Fire and ice lost in a haze
The hand gripping you, the mind in a maze

Swiftly moving like a hurricane
You'll feel the pulsing through your veins
Fight or flight ignites, dark energy
Sense and madness find no synergy

And when it comes in day or night
Your senses numbing rob you of sight
Fire and ice lost in a haze
The hand gripping you, the mind in a maze
