The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want
He makes me to lie down in green pastures
leads me beside still waters
He restoreth my soul
leads me in the paths of righteousness
for His names sake
Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil

You are with me
Your rod an staff
they comfort me
You are with me
Oh Lord

You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies
You anoint my head with oil
my cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy will
follow me all the days of my life
and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord, forever

You are with me...

The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want
