You say you're getting tired of the spiritual march
Your life is slowly growing cold
life just seems so much harder; all the battles day by day
That's when we must stand up and be bold
Be bold
So, let us not grow weary in doing what is right
God shall renew our strength to fight
remember, we reap what we sow
flesh sows corruption
spirit everlasting life
it's yours

We shall reap - if we faint not

Seeing that we have a great high priest,
Jesus; the Son of God
in all points tempted as we are
sinless, He won the battle; given power to His own
look up, your redemption is not afar
be ready

We shall reap...
