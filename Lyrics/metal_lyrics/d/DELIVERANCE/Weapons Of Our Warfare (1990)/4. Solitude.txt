A coward dies a thousand deaths
A hero dies but once
but what no one else has seen
is the truth that lies inside
That behind the eyes of a hero lies a fear
no less
a fear
no less than mine
I say it time and time again

I don't want to be alone
in this solitude

what is truth?
Once one had asked
and still he seeks to find it
A man's fear is crushed when thoughts
recall words heard so long ago
Search for an answer
a holy book upon a shelf
words cutting deep inside
speaks to my heart and to my soul

In the dark I weep alone
in this solitude

what is truth?
Once one had asked
and still he seeks to find it
A man's fear is crushed when thoughts
recall words heard so long ago

I don't have to be alone
No more solitude
