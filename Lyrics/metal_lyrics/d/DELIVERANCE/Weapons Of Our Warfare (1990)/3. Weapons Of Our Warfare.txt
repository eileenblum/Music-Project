Imaginations running wild
innocent they seem
polluting your mind
a formulated scheme
the battle; it starts in your mind - a lesson to be learned
Provoking thoughts only cause the sin
that provoking thoughts have earned
Cast down imaginations of every high thing
that dare exalts itself against the knowledge of God
The weapons of our warfare

No nuclear warfare attacks can bring these strongholds down
to take dominion over Satan's own ground
Rise up with the sword of God and put your armor on

And the weapons of our warfare aren't carnal

Imaginations running wild
innocent they seem
they've polluted your mind
the formulated scheme
the battle; it started in your mind - a lesson to be learned
Provoking thoughts only caused the sin
that provoking thoughts have earned
Cast down imaginations of every high thing
that dare exalts itself against the knowledge of God

And the weapons...
