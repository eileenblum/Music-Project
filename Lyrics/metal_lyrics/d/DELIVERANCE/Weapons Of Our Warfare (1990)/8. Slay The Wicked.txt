Angelic forces fighting the battles
unseen warriors
might they are
there is no place where angels fear to tread
drawing swords of His awesome power
the word of truth on their lips
prevailing over the rulers of this age
Release the power
not ours
not angels
but God's above
This is the hour
Demons
your fate is sealed

Slay the wicked

Demonic forces lie waiting to deceive
fallen angels incite rebellion
the human race is their prey;
don't be enslaved by their sinister scheme
resist the devil and he will flee from you
don't give place to his lies
not being ignorant of any devices
submit to God; be a vicar of Christ
Release the power...

Slay the wicked...

Release the power...

Slay the wicked...
