Thousands...
Heads are waiting for

Flash...
In their eyes, louder than all

Ready...
To start the fight

Screaming...
To take our life

Dust rises high
Light covered by...
Your mind must be stronger
Then gods that they prey

Go, go on, untill the end

Our hearts...
Burn of new dreams

Their mouth...
Cannot say who I am now

Their words...
No power in my mind

Burnin' lights...
Will be the guide to see my way

Dust rises high
...

Untill the end fights for your life
"Untill the end fights for your life"
Untill the end runs side by side
"Untill the end runs side by side"

We never stop and quit
"Our rage don't die"
We run near people going to "die"

Untill the end "dust rises high"
Untill the end "dust rises high"

Dust rises high
...
