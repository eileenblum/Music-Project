Creep the blood inside me
Creep the end of life
The stone around me that I see
I never could believe

One mistake that I prayed for
Cruel sins of reason
My eyes cannot see
What I've never seen...

Now the stone cover me
Cruel inhuman sorrow
I'll wish soon to die
"Please destroy my soul!"

Immovable like example
And u cannot call revenge
Life is a god condamn
And death is kindness of hell

Scream, through your grey heart
U can start your string
Now tears falls from your eyes
But nothing changes this life

Now the stone...

Prey the end of shadow
Prey the end of life
End of god justice
Blind ruler of mankind

Trapped under stone mask
Tears drop from my face,
Who want to believe it
A message for survive!

Blind, worst, cold, night
Now the stone...

I'll wish soon to die
I'll wish soon to die
I'll wish soon...
