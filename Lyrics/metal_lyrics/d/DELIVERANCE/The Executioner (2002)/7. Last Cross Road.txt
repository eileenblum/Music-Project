So dark
I don't find my way

Now I sit down
And alone start to tell my life

Seeking my way
Found a new day
Anybody
Calls my name

Why I sit down now?
Near me there are silence and tears
While  devil 's eyes are
Dancin' around, burning me

So scars
Found the silence and desert in me

Please morning come back!
It should lighting in front of me

Seeking my way
Found a new day
Anybody
Calls my name

And my fire is alive tonight
Waiting only for sunrise

So dark
I don't find my way

Now I sit down
And alone start to tell my life

Seeking my way
Found a new day
Anybody
Calls my name

Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
