Seeking you our mission is done
Screaming people rip dark cold
Go on the practice, blood is comin'

You don't known but it ll be done
Put the head on bloodiest stump
Swing the axe to hit the life
No solution to go out

Rise the queen of the end
To kiss the hangman too
I tell you damned
Who kill the thrash roots

I hope u die
(Yes we want it)
With pain and agony
(It must be done)
Don't call, poor man
(But pray yourself)
Who kill the thrash roots!

I smile, listenin' your hope
Emptyness like infinite cold
I can't believe in humanity

Your blood will be wine
Drunk on your face
Swing the axe to hit the life
No solution to go out!
