Light of death imprison your sight
Before u realize that u die
An intense fire burns your skin
While u think all is normal
A wild wind of fire takes away all what you've known
My life finishes in a little moment

There's a big power in the edge of the universe
We don't understand cause our ignorance

A white light covers all the sky
The earth burns under my feet

The memories are invaded
By fantastic things

On our heads rains the power of the universe

My eyes cry the comin' of the dark
And my sight is ripped by a white light

There's a big star in the edge of the universe
Now they remember me my ignorance

A white light covers all the sky
And the earth disappear with me

The memories are invaded
By fantastic things

On our heads rains the power of the universe

My eyes cry the comin' of the dark
And my sight is ripped by a white light
