The preacher speaks his idiocy
in the name of prophecy
submit to me to be allowed
into the ministry
he knows what to say
to make you feel good
but your mind is plagued with confusion
something's left not understood

who is man to formulate
the way God uses men?
they pervert the word to indulge
in their lusts
you fool your being lied to
in the name of Christianity
sixty six books tell it like it is
not an act or liturgy!

Prophet of idiocy
