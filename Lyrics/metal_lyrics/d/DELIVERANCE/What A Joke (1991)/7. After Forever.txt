[Written by Tony Iommi]

Have you ever thought about your soul
can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead
you just stay in your grave
is God just a thought within your head
or is He a part of you?
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book
when you were in school

When you think about death do you lose your breath
or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the pope on the end of a rope?
Well you know that ain't cool
Well I've seen the truth yes I've see the light
and I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared
at the end of our days

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends
might say
If they knew you believed in God above?
They should realize before they criticize
that Jesus is the only way to love

Is your minds so small that you have to fall
in with the pack wherever they run?
Will you still sneer when death is near?
And say they may as well worship the sun
I think it was true it was people like you
that crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had
was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near
say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down
Now you can't retreive

Perhaps you'll think before you say that
God is dead and gone
Open your eyes just realize that He is the One
The only One who can save you now
from all this sin and hate
or will you still jeer at all you hear?
Yes I think it's too late
