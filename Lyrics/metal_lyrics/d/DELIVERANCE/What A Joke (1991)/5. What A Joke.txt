I'm so tired of all this guile
Homo's saying they're not perverted
it's an alternative lifestyle
law enforcement, politicians and businessmen
these days with most of them
corruption is a synonym
we fight this battle not against evil
against those who think they are good
I've not stolen, murdered or destroyed
God will let me in!

What a joke
God will laugh at your calamity
What a joke
He will mock when your terror comes

Want to be intellects spew
"There is no God"
Proving themselves fools, liars and frauds
remnant prays this battle against evil
against those who perceive they are right
They've not stolen, murdered or destroyed
God must let them in!

What a joke
God will laugh at their calamity
What a joke
He will mock when their terror comes
What a joke
Despising knowledge, choosing not to fear
What a joke
Complacency of fools will destroy
