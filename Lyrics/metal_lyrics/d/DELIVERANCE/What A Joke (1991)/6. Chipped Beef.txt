Chipped beef, such a treat, one jar of dried beef,
two cups of whole milk, one tablespoon of
cornstarch, two tablespoons of butter, half
package of frozen peas, fresh if preferred, salt
and pepper, to your own taste, Here are the
directions, follow closely, fry the beef in the
butter, in a medium saucepan, add the milk, then
the peas, then salt and pepper to taste
Mix cornstarch with quarter cup of whole milk
then add mixture to simmer ten minutes or so
although the recipe calls for fried, fried linguine,
I prefer several layers of warm buttered toast,
lightly toasted
AHHHH!!, Man, AAAAH!!!
