You run, you hide but soon you'll find
That your life has been put on the line
Keep going, soon you will see
That the one, you once called friend,
is now your enemy

Be ready for attack
Be ready for attack

Put on the whole armor of God
That you might stand the evil, that's to come
Soon will you grow weary of the fight
Trust God, hold to His hand tight
