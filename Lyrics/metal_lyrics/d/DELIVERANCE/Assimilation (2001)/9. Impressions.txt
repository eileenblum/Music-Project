Can they see the person that cares?
Can see the person that hurts?
Can they see the beauty that lies within?
We first learn how to lie
And confess the truth
How appropriate the sequence as Joshua Judges Ruth
Since Iâve taught myself to beg for the abuse
Impressions / not always what they seem
Impressions / itâs when my mind takes leave from me
Can I love my neighbor as myself?
The cry to Adonai as always to change me
Donât let my stare become a fearful glare
When I see their humanity, will it change the scenery?
Or does the prejudicial eye leave none to tell?
Can I love my neighbor???
