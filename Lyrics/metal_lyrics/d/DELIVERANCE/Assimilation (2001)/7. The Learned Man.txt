Learned man, paint the picture of life
Did you see it full of pain
Did you see it full of strife
Did you see the horrors of it all?
Or did you indulge yourself to ignore your call
Would you?
Quiet now, a recluse who questions being
Why and where do we belong
What arenât my eyes seeing?
Split the hair in 2, such a meaningless task
To throw away yourself without a word to ask
Landing here through this revolving sphere
Torn away fromâ¦
Eyes are wide, thin disguise
A fraction of the sumâ¦
You are the learned manâ¦
Quiet now, reflections seem so clear
Mine are the eyes that watch from afar
Seeing is believing, I might beg to differ
To master the deception
And sink further into the river
Life is yours, your quest was always here
To catch a glimpse of the Savior
Through this multi-colored smear
Wipe away the tearsâ¦
You are the learned manâ¦ you areâ¦
