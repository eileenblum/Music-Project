Split my brain, how could this be?
The central theme of life brought by this seed
Let me see cerulean skies, chase the rain
The tale of sinful thought ride the course of the bane
Raise the bar once again, challenge my soul
The limitless light ignites the coals
Real, I ask for real I heard one say
The hands of YHWH form the clay
Between 2 worldsâ¦
Torn between 2 worlds
Where the traffic is thin
To reach the point of I am NOT
Between 2 worlds / split my brain
Between 2 worlds / raise the bar again
Between 2 worlds / form the clayâ¦
