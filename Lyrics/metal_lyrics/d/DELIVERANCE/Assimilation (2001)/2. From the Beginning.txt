The brooding darkness enveloped in the sky
The Spirit moved on the water still
Black lay upon the face of the deep
Shaping of the hemispheres formed by the will
A blowing in the air, new thought engaged
Speak to the nothings, and light filled the world
The Age of Auer, and the age of thought
The dust sprang forth the man
Perfection embodied, in the image he was made
And all was given in his hand
Do we want our eyes again to see?
Why is it in these chains I feel free?
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Let no strain come nigh
Beguiled by the snake, man lost his sight
There was no one left to blame
The veil was raised and the cord now severed
The beauty now became their shame
The Ani looked and saw that it was good
Perfection embodied and the plan understood
Sacrifice to save mankind from themselves 
Brought back to YHWH to rid them from this hell

[Ani--Hebrew for "I AM"]
[Auer--Hebrew for "Light"]
