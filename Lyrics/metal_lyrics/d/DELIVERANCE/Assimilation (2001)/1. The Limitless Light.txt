The zeroes are calling once againReminding me of life beforeRecapture the essence from Torah to ZenYHWH's truth again revealed to the poorThe air carries the mystery of YouThe answers I didn't find in the pewsThrough Your name I foundredemptive planThe holiness forms the body of manCome take me to where You dwellEven through the fires of hellI know You will...The writer sits to write againTo make reason of his rhymeThe truth that courses through our veinsLong before there was timeOut of the silence I ranTo where I first felt Your handNo wondering why in the starlit skiesThe 2-way mirror has blinded my eyesBeyond infinity, there is no end...The Ocean calls you once again, my longlost friend...
