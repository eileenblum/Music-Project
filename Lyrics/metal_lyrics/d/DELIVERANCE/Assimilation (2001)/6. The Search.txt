Far from this land of dismay
Is where I want to be
Take me to the reaches of the mind
Let my eyes again see
The never lands pave the search
To destruction or creation
Idealistic formulas, truth or temptation
Is it all just complications?
To search for truth, such a noble cause
Deafened by the roar of applause
My wayward spirit to descend
For the searchâ¦
Cry my lovely, let me see your tears
The release has begun
The center of my consciousness, oh no
Of a song already sung
Truth is outdone?
A right or wrong way
The loaded gun to distract the work that has begun
Wise men still seek to find the truth in us
But they use the Hubble to discover
What their feet have already crushed
