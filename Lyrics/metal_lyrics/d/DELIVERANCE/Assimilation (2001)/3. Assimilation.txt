To infiltrate what is already here
The constant turning of the sphere
To recreate what already breathes
Transformation is what is sees
The fiery world race through the chipboard
The bleeding circuits deaf and dumb
Energy mass, speed of light to feel
The probability of what you believe is real
Assimilate, formulate, resurface the corrupt
Assimilate, penetrate, give the drive new air to breathe
(Resurface the corrupt) Assimilate!
Screaming in digital, the movement so vast
Feeding the night never meant to last
Writhing in ecstasy, sequential overload
Shuffle of darkness just outside the know
Mutation will finally take its course
When the drives path returns to its course
Blurred vision, correction of the filtered stream
The wiping of the data by the program seen
Assimilate, formulate, resurface the corrupt
Assimilate, penetrate, give the drive new air to breathe
Live online, the pathway lay so clear
Avoid the virus that breaks the firewall from the rear
Searching near and far for more of like kind
Of transformation and renewal of the mind
My eyes are seeing clearly now
Alive I feel, not by my own light Or is it???
