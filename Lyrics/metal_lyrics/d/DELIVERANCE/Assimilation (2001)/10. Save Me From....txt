Into the stretch my mind starts to bend
Cries for mercy, tears of joy to lend
Partial rights applied, my soul lay condemned
To live to breath, sacrifice myself
The tired soul refreshed with new wine
A tempered indulge from the fruit of the vine
A searching soul in search for a sign
My journey began before I was born
Familiar with the stare your eyes have worn
Tried for the season refine my faith
Overcome my want, the win to taste
To live to breathe, sacrifice myself
To live to breathe, sacrifice myself
Save me from myself, touch me, make me, love me
Save me from myself, touch me, make me, love me
Save me from myself, save me
I hear the rainfall, see it through my eyes
Cleave to the truth, let go of the lies
My will to be, I will be, centered Messiah ahead of me
To live to breathe, sacrifice myself
Save me from myself, touch me, make me, love me
