Drifting, a thousand thoughts begin to cross my mind
The door keeps getting farther back behind
Stories and memories, a strong urge to obey
A call to act, a call to prayâ¦

Caught between my past and now, sailing on an open bow
Flying high across a perfect sky
Euphoria, never will I leave, never will it be overâ¦

So it begins, a chance to sit down with a genial class
A chance to peek inside the looking glass
Parsimony, wheels are spinning like an August dance
A chance to sleep, a chance to dream at lastâ¦

Caught between my past and now, sailing on an open bow
Flying high across a perfect sky
Euphoria, never will I leave, never will it be overâ¦

Caught up inside a peaceful bliss, a taste of Heaven upon my lips
Beauty abounding, tranquil feelings I surmise, hoping I will not open my eyesâ¦

As a child I used to try and spread my wings and start to fly
Flying high across a perfect sky
Euphoria, never will I leave, never will it be overâ¦
