Iâm tired of hearing and seeing death counts
The passing of another friend.
The clock is ticking, the pendulum swinging
Worried hearts wonder for their end
Theyâre running to Doctors or the Medicine Men
Looking for the wonder cure
To heal their bodies or to lose their minds
The clearing of a vision blurredâ¦

Ainât it funny how the living coffins called home
Make us feel safe and secure
We hide from families, the neighbors and pets
And make friends with the computer
We Twit and Facebook our lives on a screen
Past friends and memories relived
I would hate to come to the end of my life
And realize I had not livedâ¦

Youâre passing â just living like a dead man
Youâre passing â just letting life pass you by
Youâre passing â make a change, make the best move
Youâre passing â just letting life pass you byâ¦

Take a swim in the ocean, feel the depth all around you
Take a walk and see the strangersâ eyes are really yours!

Iâm tired of hearing and seeing the death counts
The passing of another friend.
The clock is ticking, the pendulum swinging
Worried hearts wonder for their end
Theyâre running to Doctors or the Medicine Men
Looking for a wonder cure
To heal their bodies or to lose their minds
The clearing of a vision blurredâ¦

Youâre passing â just living like a dead man
Youâre passing â just letting life pass you by
Youâre passing â make a change, make the best move
Youâre passing â just letting life pass you byâ¦
