Weightless and without form, sometimes I feel like this existence is trying me, failing me, a thoughtless path thatâs killing me slowly.
There has to be some way to crawl away from the mundane, to start again, be born again, and dare to live without compromise or conform

I close my eyes, I see myself for that, what Iâve become, a selfish man, a pitied man, trying to please the world and myself.
I hide in the shadows and in plain sight for all of you to see, the double, the triple, the other selfâs condemned to hide who I really amâ¦

I can see it, I can see it â a chance to be all that I am
I can see it, I can see it â a chance to grow and start to live again

Fly into the center of the Universe
And find the meaning behind your âselfâ
Watch it die, then watch it reborn
Stumble on this darkened path
The answers are there, reach in and see
Death is not the end, but a start, a chance
To live as if you were nudeâ¦

Nothing to hide, only as nudeâ¦

So here we are, the masks have been burned, a time to show our real face, this time and place, no longer hiding who we are if not only to you
Like a new life born, look forward to the journey, itâs not late, there is no fate, create our new lives and live like we were nudeâ¦

Fly into the center of the Universe
And find the meaning behind your âselfâ
Watch it die, then watch it reborn
Stumble on this darkened path
The answers are there, reach in and see
Death is not the end, but a start, a chance
To live as if you were nudeâ¦

Nothing to hide, only as nudeâ¦
