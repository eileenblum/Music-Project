Frustrated, perplexed, at the current world view
Maligned, upset, as the straight becomes askew
Knowledge so vast, yet we dive so deeper still
Into the murk, and weâve become the mentally ill
OCD, ADHD quickly has become the norm
Independent thought, so swiftly to conform
Escape the real, dive into fantasy
To live with eyes closed, unfurled heresy

Worlds apart, or are you just like me?
Contempt for all, to be or not be
Or is there hope? Will we find a cure?
Paths aligned, trails beyond the blur

Why? Is the question now?
Or has it always been?
Is the answer clear?
Or will we live our life so full of Angst*?

The hate, the love, and all thatâs in between
The fault, the blame, mirroring the obscene
The core, the source, of the blinding rage
Power corrupt, weighing out the wage
Lies, deceit, a leering at the past
The more we look the fire in the cast
The wheat, the chaff chocking out the seed
Clearing out, the world in desperate need!

Why? Is the question now?
Or has it always been?
Is the answer clear?
Or will we live our life so full of Angst?

[* "Angst" is German for "fear".]
