I should have come back, but Iâve nothing back there
This sweet slow motion, surrender to the space
Time has left me, truly to be freeâ¦

A thousand eyes theyâre on me, they flicker in the night
And I become as theyâ¦

My eyes roll back, and I see you!
You bring me back in where I am stillborn
Just let me supernova, admire me for a moment

A thousand eyes theyâre on me, they flicker in the night
And I become as theyâ¦

A thousand eyes theyâre on meâ¦
