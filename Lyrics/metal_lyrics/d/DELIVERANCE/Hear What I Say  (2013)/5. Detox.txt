Withdrawn from the mission, I strive to feed the next breath
With no act of indiscretion, the plot of a nervous death
I saw where my eyes led me, the mind wonât stop turning
Pluck it out so I cannot see, the mind wonât stop burning

I need to detox! â Unlearn the old way!

Only so much one can take of mundane living
How much can one make without a thought of giving?
The picture is getting clear, but the air is still so thick
I can no longer shed a tear, itâs all making me sick!

I need to detox! â Unlearn the old way!
I need to detox! â Hear what I say!

Will it come to the end of days and go the way of all flesh?
Be gone at last the old way? The data all refreshed!
Am I stuck with this for now? Blind, not wanting to see
Will they ask me how? And point me toward the tree???

I need to detox! â Unlearn the old way!
I need to detox! â Hear what I say!
