Lies â spewing out in fury, seeking out the weak
Bold â authoritative stance, disguised as the meek
Made â to feel less than human, abnormal tendencies
Forced â to surrender lifeâs will, a lived expectancy

Kraft â gehorsam*

Will we live our lives plagued in guilt?
Or will we live on freedom promised?
Laws of stone or felt from the heart?

Cries â a voice in search of freedom, but bound by the will
Defeat â lifeless in the eyes, the lower self to kill
Pierce â a stab at the sky, find the voice within
Strength â Rise against the tide, make the Earth cave in

Fear â of the consequence, to make the needed change
Core â the center of your being, the hidden light engaged
Taunt â brave the new element, pay disparage no mind
Rise â from the dead land youâve surmised, and pierce the sky!

[* "Kraft" is German for "strength", "gehorsam" is German for "obediently".]
