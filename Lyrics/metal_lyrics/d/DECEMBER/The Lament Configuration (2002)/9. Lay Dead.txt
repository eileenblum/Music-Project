Where is this going somewhere nowhere just anywhere but here
A delinquency in your honesty
Blood was shed to pave your way two thousand years and nothing changed
So just stay there play dead longer and hope your instinct was right
Expect nothing so you'll deliver all of the promises broken and falling
Like poison raining down from the sky into the mouth of life
So just stay there play dead longer and hope your instinct was right
Nothing to show a bitter swallow
Need not be afraid everything is still the same
Anticipating this damnation it never comes
Invention of your blind faith in god in nothing
Poison raining down from the sky in to the mouth of life
Anticipating this damnation
Blood was shed to pave your way two thousand years and nothing's changed
So just stay there play dead longer and hope your instinct was right
Poison raining in to the mouth of life
