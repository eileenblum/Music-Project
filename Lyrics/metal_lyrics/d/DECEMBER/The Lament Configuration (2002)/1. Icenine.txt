So claustrophobic hard to keep breathing and all at once all hope fades into gray
Shelter falls all around you just to save the face that you will not wear
You drag the waters and your soul forgets that it's alive
Shedding your blood just like diseased tears
And all for nothing can't cure what can't be saved
To give up ending life if only for one second
Your world is not benign drowning in the weight of life
Swallow yourself and choke
Simple resistance begins this hour your conjured opinion sure to mean nothing
Suffer for the moment fault you've won will it be the price of your pride
To give up ending life if only for one second
Your world is not benign drowning in the weight of life
Swallow yourself and choke
Hollowing the main artery that keeps you going
Filter the filth inside into one small bite
Take this away cannot bear the end
So simple to not breathe at all semms so simple to die
To give up ending life if only for one second
Your world is not benign drowning in the weight of life
Swallow yourself and choke
Inhale the excess toxic emissions all just to extend another perfect day
Cannot stay any longer so farewell
Farewell to all the worthless products of your failing world
You drag the waters for your soul forget it it's over
