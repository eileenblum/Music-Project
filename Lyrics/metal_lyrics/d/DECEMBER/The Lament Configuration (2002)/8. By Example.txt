Broken words now silencing no more breath that's worth wasting
Screams inside cannot focus
Not enough to find exit
Forced into retreat life that once showed such promise
Dying without ceremony
No one mourns this silent grave
Ignore signs to the contrary and lay your head to sleep
It seems there are no answers no more than what you've seen
The implied safety falters and falls shattering
The vacuum left behind is all the proof you really need
And by example you bleed drop by drop you'll understand
Wiping away all the protest in an instant scatter the winds
The sky suffocates
Touch the sun and turn to dust justice served for ambition
Bowing to the fallen star
Forever chained by this failure
Ignore signs to the contrary and lay your head to sleep
It seems there are no answers no more than what you've seen
The implied safety falters and falls shattering
The vacuum left behind is all the proof you really need
And by example you bleed drop by drop you'll understand
