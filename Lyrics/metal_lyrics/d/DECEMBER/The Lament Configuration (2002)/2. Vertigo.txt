Trapped on the surface cracks shining through
No action justifying the intentions paving the way
Faults in design now giving way without structure
The end plummets down living up to the old cliche'
Won't be the last time you break standing chosen to fall
Contradiction of looking forward to a future that was not promised
It all sounds so sweet and then you bleed buried it all in your mind
Digging the grave so it begins again
Vertigo
You will be taken down right where you belong
Sign this in blood promise the world away
Open yourself to nothing
And as the end comes down nothing will live forever
Clouding the pool blood loss
The poison has taken hold and it will reign eternal
Falling disaster crashing down upon creation that bows to greet it
Encourage and welcome the new messiah buried it all in your mind
Digging the grave so it begins again
Vertigo
You will be taken down right where you belong
Won't be the last time you break standing chosen to fall
