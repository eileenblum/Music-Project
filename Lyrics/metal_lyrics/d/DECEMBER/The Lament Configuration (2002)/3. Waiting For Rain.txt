Cauterized empty sky
Probing your way through the barren landscape of
Seasons without end
Holding onto every last breath under it's weight you fall
It's obvious it's over sterilize memories
Retching on promises never delivered life has given up
Common sense kills the notion of your savior
Dislocating the horizon no rapture to awaken
The faithless ties that bind control choking need
Running head long into the flood
No end in sight
Surely the drought should end here and now
I'm still waiting
It's obvious it's over dislocating the horizon
Who will be the one to rip the earth from the sky and end it all
Life will fall below the surface
In this blood truth is made suffer existence
Waiting for judgement
Who will be the one to rip the earth from the sky
Caked in dirt parched dying of thirst
With hands held aloft to witness the sky shedding skin
One million prayers washed away
Separating before the eyes of those too tired to cry
No end in sight
Surely the drought should end here and now
I'm still waiting
