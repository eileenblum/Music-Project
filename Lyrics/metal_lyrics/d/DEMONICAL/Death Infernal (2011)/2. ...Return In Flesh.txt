Flesh is a decomposing form
Into the graves of mould
Worm infected greasy meat
The stench of death!
Torn from the life into a tomb
To a descent hell
Death infernal to the core
A morbid way of sleep

Forever damned and bound to flesh
Eternal hell, repugnant death

Drown in morbid blasphemy
The praise of doom
Breeding death sweeps the soil
A feast of wrath!
Crawl in the stinking slimy guts
We are the reapers in the night
Boiling blood runs through our veins
When we lick the flesh

Forever damned and bound to flesh
Eternal hell, repugnant death

Into the graves of rotten death
Blasphemic carnage until the dawn
Infernal death to a new rebirth
Graveless souls will return in flesh

Return in flesh

Forever damned and bound to flesh
Eternal hell, repugnant death

Into the graves of rotten death
Blasphemic carnage until the dawn
Infernal death to a new rebirth
Graveless souls will return in flesh
