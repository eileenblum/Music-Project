Master, lord Lucifer
Lead us through the flames
We summon your force in blood
We cal your many names
Through pain we serve eternally
Mighty son of the dawn
Enlighten us eternally
Bearer of light, hear our call

Resurrected persecutor
Seducer of mankind

Burn the temple of innocence
Let flames engulf their shrines
Raise the darkened unity
Enforce their feeble gods decline
Destroy the dreams of those believing
In god's divinity
Relentless and supreme
We stand above all humanity

Resurrected persecutor
Seducer of mankind
Father, lord Lucifer, Samael
Prince of disobedience, rise!

Through hellfire
Through hellfire
Enlightened servants of the fallen one
The time has come to raise to the throne again
Let it stand far above the stars of gods
And let the earth tremble once again

This is the time
Enlightened ones
This is the hour of the wolves

Master, lord Lucifer
Lead us through the flames
We summon your force in blood
We cal your many names
Through pain we serve eternally
Mighty son of the dawn
Enlighten us eternally
Bearer of light, hear our call

Resurrected persecutor
Seducer of mankind
Resurrected persecutor
Diabolos arise!
Father, lord Lucifer, Samael
Prince of disobedience, rise!
Through hellfire
Through hellfire
