Like echoes of an ancient call
The bringers of death soars
Engulfed by storms that trembled all
We came onward from northern shores

In pain and blood we dwelled
Allied forever with the forces of hell

We gathered for a final day
For victory or defeat
Following the sign of a dying world
We fought and fell, but never showed no fear

Slain warriors - revealed a killing ground
Slain warriors - in death peace was found
Slain warriors - marched towards bravery
Slain warriors - forever slept in immortality

We hammered through the fields of screams
Armed with an iron will
In war we found no honor nor dread
But only peace and utter thrill
In pain and blood we dwelled
Allied forever with the forces of hell

Slain warriors - revealed a killing ground
Slain warriors - in death peace was found
Slain warriors - marched towards bravery
Slain warriors - forever slept in immortality

As the freezing wind cleared the air
The eternal night drew near
Heading towards the horizon again
To a place much greater than here

In pain and blood we dwelled
Allied forever with the forces of hell

Slain warriors - revealed a killing ground
Slain warriors - in death peace was found
Slain warriors - marched towards bravery
Slain warriors - forever slept in immortality
