I'm holding my breath, as time is running out
And eternity draws near
The horizon turns black
The silence is now taking over
We are all doomed to slowly fade away
Shadows depart and vanish
Our presence turns to dust
The light fades away, into the unknown
The night is here to forever stay

Days and hours slowly smothered by sorrow
Will this ever end
Were they all go, we must all follow
To beyond the future sent

For we are all crying running and hiding
All will perish - this is our liberation
Seeking, dreaming an dying
All will perish - this is the final liberation

The vast trembling sky, falling to pieces
Visions gone like visions came
Death is the key to a world beyond illusions
Eternal death - the only way

Days and hours slowly smothered by sorrow
Will this ever end
Were they all go, we must all follow
To beyond the future sent

For we are all crying running and hiding
All will perish - this is our liberation
Seeking, dreaming an dying
All will perish - this is the final liberation

Sounds of departure, echoes of deliverance
Aeons pass
Formless fires, shapeless illusions
Sounds of departure, echoes of deliverance
Nothing lasts
Life swallowed by the fire

Crying, running and hiding
All will perish - this is our liberation
Seeking, dreaming and dying
Crying, running and hiding
All will perish - this is the final liberation
All will perish - this is our liberation
Seeking, dreaming and dying
All will perish - this is our liberation
