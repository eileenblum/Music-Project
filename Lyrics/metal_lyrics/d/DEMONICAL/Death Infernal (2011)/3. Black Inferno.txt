Step aside, to the unhallowed forces of evil
Beware, we will harvest your skin and flesh
We bring destruction with the cross turned upside down
Darkness spinning, twisted tornado
Armageddon has come

It is time to spread the poison of a higher chaos
We will feed the dark through unholy aeons

Death infernal - vengeance awaits the righteous one
Black inferno - fallen be the bastard son

Kneel down, feeble servant of the false prophet
Beware, prepare yourselves for the attack
Count your minutes, we will seal your end when coming in
Forcing you to forever revel in glorious sin

It is time to spread the poison of a higher chaos
We will feed the dark through unholy aeons

Death infernal - vengeance awaits the righteous one
Black inferno - fallen be the bastard son
Death infernal - vengeance awaits the righteous one
Black inferno - to the eternal fire all holiness succumb
Through us you will reach everlasting pain
Through us you will understand the meaning of the world insane
With us you will fall into the pits of hell
Into the black inferno where no compassion dwell

Step aside, to the unhallowed forces of evil
Beware, we will harvest your skin and flesh
We bring destruction with the cross turned upside down
Darkness spinning, twisted tornado
Armageddon has come

It is time to spread the poison of a higher chaos
We will feed the dark through unholy aeons

Death infernal - vengeance awaits the righteous one
Black inferno - fallen be the bastard son
Death infernal - vengeance awaits the righteous one
Black inferno - to the eternal fire all holiness succumb
