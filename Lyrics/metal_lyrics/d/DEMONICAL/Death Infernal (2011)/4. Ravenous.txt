Blinded souls in search of divine guidance
Like cattle they submit to their own fraud
Followers detest the mind of the persistent
May their sacred creations burn them all

Delusional - they fear the smoke and sulphur
Abominable - we choose to live their second death
And mock their envy as they crawl
Dormant, impotent
The seven billion insignificant
Clueless they stand, clueless they fall
An obedient pageant
Of seven billion insignificant

With eyes unveiled
We feed upon their lies
Our sight, cleared by the haze

Confident, as the rejected rise
This hallowed world falls into decay
Inferior - they fear the wrath and fury
Ravenous - we feast upon the anger of their god

May they live in a haze of delusions
May the lies veil them all
May they slander the light of the morning star
May their pitiful trinity fall
Delusional - they fear the smoke and sulphur
Abominable - we choose to live their second death
And mock their envy as they crawl
Dormant, impotent
The seven billion insignificant
Clueless they stand, clueless they fall
An obedient pageant
Of seven billion insignificant
