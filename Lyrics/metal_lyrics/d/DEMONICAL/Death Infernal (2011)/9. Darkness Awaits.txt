Into the darkness, towards the untrodden might
Into the unknown, away from the spiteful light
The morning has broken, cold steel raging bright
Open the gates of blackest delight

No need of salvation, I breath for sullen redemption

The beast has risen, jaws of black are open wide
Anguish descending as the echoes are increasing
Chaos gone, time erased for the living
A journey to memories foretold

No need of salvation, I breath for sullen redemption

In a circle of life, I seal my fate
I am reborn - darkness awaits
Come forth, come close, come taste the pain
Darkness awaits
In the dark I feel like one with all the lies
In the night my past runs by

Into the darkness, towards the untrodden might
Into the unknown, away from the spiteful light
The morning has broken, cold steel raging bright
Open the gates of blackest delight

No need of salvation, I breath for sullen redemption

In a circle of life, I seal my fate
I am reborn - darkness awaits
Come forth, come close
