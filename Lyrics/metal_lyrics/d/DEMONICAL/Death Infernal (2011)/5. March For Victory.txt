The night is cold, silent and wide
As we head towards the core
Side by side we are all pounding on
Guided by a burning torch
Deep across the open fields
Destroy and ruin is our call
We bring the fury from the north

Embrace the storm of raging flames
From beyond where only death remains

We destroy them one by one
We head on and on
Towards a victorious destiny
We destroy them one by one
We head on and on
Towards a victorious destiny
As we march for our victory

The battle rages on by the sound of the horn
We show the wrath of steel
No mercy, forgiveness, retreat or tears

As blood engains our shields
Our eyes are darken than black
The fires proclaim the path to your final defeat

Embrace the storm of raging flames
From beyond where only death remains

We destroy them one by one
We head on and on
Towards a victorious destiny
We destroy them one by one
We head on and on
Towards a victorious destiny
As we march for our victory

Blood for blood we came onward without remorse
Eye for an eye we raise the righteous force
The final battle has broken
We are ready to fight and defend
We will follow our honor, our pride, our cause
To the bitter end

Embrace the storm of raging flames
From beyond where only death remains

We destroy them one by one
We head on and on
Towards a victorious destiny
We destroy them one by one
We head on and on
Towards a victorious destiny
As we march for our victory
