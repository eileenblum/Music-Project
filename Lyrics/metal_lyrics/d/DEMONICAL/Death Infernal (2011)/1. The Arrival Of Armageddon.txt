Sworn in steel and fire, damnation reclaims the dark
Vicious wrath descending...
Cast into the unlight, bring forth the pain and fear
Reveal the final dawn, the end of the earth is near

We ride the infested path
With claws of a bitter loss

Forged with power, possession unfolds
Dark shadows rising
Screams of horror echoes beyond the walls of sleep
Blasphemy and bloodshed forever roaming free

We ride the infested path
With claws of a bitter loss

Storms of hate prevails
Darkness, death, Armageddon
Cleansed in hellish flames

Darkness, death
Infernal be our ways

With ravenous force
We slay the followers of feeble light
Burning madness profound
We bring justice with weapons of might
Sworn in steel and fire, damnation reclaims the dark
Vicious wrath descending...
Cast into the unlight, bring forth the pain and fear
Reveal the final dawn, the end of the earth is near

We ride the infested path
With claws of a bitter loss

Storms of hate prevails
Darkness, death, Armageddon
Cleansed in hellish flames
