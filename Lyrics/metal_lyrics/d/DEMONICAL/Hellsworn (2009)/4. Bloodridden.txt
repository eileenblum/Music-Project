I the herald, let my knowledge be thy guideIn light of belief you come to meThe gift of persistence, keys to wisdom wideI was given all you came to me Children in light of belief towards me being ledBrothers I welcome thee, embrace the path towardsThe kingdom of the dead Encircled by fire, inhuman be my waysSpeechless you fall to praiseGod of corrosion, prince of decayRestless be my ways Children in light of belief towards me being ledBrothers I welcome thee, embrace the path towardsThe kingdom of the dead Come victors and victims, comeCome, smother this slavery, come So blind and ignorant, humanity abideThe condescending filth they are bred to feedI the heretic cast this slavery asideEmbrace the revolt I'm here to lead Children in light of belief towards me being ledBrothers I welcome thee, embrace the path ahead Children come... Brothers embrace...The kingdom of the dead
