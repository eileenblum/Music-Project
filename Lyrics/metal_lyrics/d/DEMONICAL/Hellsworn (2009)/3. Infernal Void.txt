[Lead: Lindgren]

Fire - Thunder from above
A nightmare beyond belief
Smoke cloud covering the night time sky
Hell - Is this the earthly hell
The place where life will cease
A void of total nothingness

Death - Surrounded by flames
An inferno of heat and cries
A foretaste of the final day
Pain - The horizon is ablaze
A conclusion of brutal raids
A strike never seen before

A scorched ruin
Its blackened streets filled with corpses

1945 - Thousands suffer and die
1945 - Echoes the tormented cries

An incredible firestorm
Calls for help and screams from somewhere
Hell upon us... "I don't want to burn to death"

Fire - Thunder from above
A nightmare beyond belief
Smoke cloud covering the night time sky
Hell - Is this the earthly hell
The place where life will cease
A void of total nothingness

A scorched ruin
Its blackened streets filled with corpses

1945 - Thousands suffer and die
1945 - Echoes the tormented cries
1945 - Thousands suffer and die
1945 - We die...
