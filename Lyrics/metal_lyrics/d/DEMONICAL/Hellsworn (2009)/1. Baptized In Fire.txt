Uprise - in times of deceitMillions await the self-proclaimed eliteA dynasty in fire will ascendTyranny and misgovernment - soon it will end All will change after the accession to the throneThen we will rule alone Triumph - Behold the banner unfurledThe sound of trumpets all over the worldPerspicacious - as the earth is purifiedCenturies of tyranny has come to an end All will change after the accession to the throneThen we will rule alone - Then we rule you all Both land and sea we shall controlInviolable after the accession to the throneFire... Baptized in fire Awakening in a far greater stateMother cleansed, suffering abatesTotalitarian intolerant regimeBehold our creation the greatest ever seen All will change after the accession to the throneThen we will rule alone - Then we rule you all
