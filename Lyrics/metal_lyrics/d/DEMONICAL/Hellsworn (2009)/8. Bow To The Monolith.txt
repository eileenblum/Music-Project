What kind of fucking god is yoursMine stands on cloven hoof and breaths fireHe is a behemoth among the monstersA chosen one not Christ the liar Vainglorious we receive affirmationThe forlorn pious begin to bendWe dominate the religious nationsAnd unveil the means to an end The dawn of new millenniaA conceited age it greets the sun From whence it came so begins the mythMinions bare witness and bow to the monolithThe hazy moon falls upon the black obeliskHail the King of Hell and bow to the monolith Altruistic religions but all are mythsDenomination of evil... All hail the king of hell What kind of fucking god is yoursMine stands on cloven hoof and breaths fireHe is a behemoth among the monstersA chosen one not Christ the liar The dawn of new millenniaA conceited age it greets the sun From whence it came so begins the mythMinions bare witness and bow to the monolithThe hazy moon falls upon the black obeliskHail the King of Hell and bow to the monolith
