Years of oppression, a history of scornful laughterHas come to an end, gruesome, sinister but fairAs clouds of darkness covers the moonlight skyThe final strike will end all unholy lies Spreading the plagueWith hellsworn fire The time has come when the sun no longer risesIn the twilight hour the sinners will loose their facesThose feeble souls, the sheep despising sinWill forever burn with a hellish fire within Spreading the plagueA ravenous choirSpreading the plagueWith hellsworn fire Children of sin - Evoke those glorious deedsChildren of sin - Rise from the seventh circle Hiding deep in the shadows far away from the lightIn silence they are here to seal the eternal night Years of oppression, a history of scornful laughterHas come to an end, gruesome, sinister but fairAs clouds of darkness covers the moonlight skyThe final strike will end all unholy lies Spreading the plagueA ravenous choirSpreading the plagueWith hellsworn fire Children of sin - Evoke those glorious deedsChildren of sin - Rise from the seventh circle
