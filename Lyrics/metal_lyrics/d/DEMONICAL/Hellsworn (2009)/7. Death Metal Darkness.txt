In raging fire we ruin the lightReveal the magic and the newborn mightWe are the slayers of false and weakBeyond the horizon, beneath the shadesA total genocide you shall obey Bring forth the fury and endless painRide for glory in victorious flamesYour life is descending, silent endStormy legions of destructionWe are the horde of devastation Defending the throne - hellfire horde Death metal darkness - devastation will forever beDeath metal darkness - we are the masters of immortality In raging fire we ruin the lightReveal the magic and the newborn mightWe are the slayers of false and weakBeyond the horizon, beneath the shadesA total genocide you shall obey Defending the throne - hellfire horde Death metal darkness - devastation will forever beDeath metal darkness - we are the masters of immortality
