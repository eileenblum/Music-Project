From an ocean of blood, ariseRetaliation materializedBringing death and inevitable demiseTo the allies of the despisedThey may run but they can not hideIt's a destiny they can not avoidThe pitiful minority of insectsWaiting to be destroyed Behold the serpent coil towards theeCausing death and despair to the enemyBreaking all in its way, every kraalBringing death to all Come forth mighty oneLet the abandoned taste thy wrathLiberated millions uniteIn the greatest uprise ever seenCome forth mighty oneLet the leaders lead as they've been ledTrue evil shows its faceIn a kingdom built on the bones of the dead Behold the serpent coil towards theeCausing death and despair to the enemyBreaking all in its way, every kraalBringing death to all Come forth mighty serpent, ariseFrom an ocean of blood retaliation materialized Behold the serpent coil towards theeCausing death and despair to the enemyBreaking all in its way, every kraalBringing death to all Death to all...
