Blood and grief, the unholy rules of survival 
As chaos guides us to the other side 

Diving into the unknown 
Crawling forth the deep dark hole 
Pump our veins with calmness 
Lead our souls to the suicide throne 
Our minds are black, final moments are present 
Tear us apart in madness 
Dwells inside a circle of void 

Rapture - Come close and bring the pain 
Wipe away the thoughts of the weak 
Find the golden path to the soulless dawn 
As we all revel in misanthropia 

Plunging down the abyss 
Shedding off all ties to life 
Craving for serenity 
Our souls are suicide prone 
Our gaze is black, the end of life draws near 
Split our minds to pieces 
In this realm of emptiness 

Rapture - Come close and bring the pain 
Wipe away the thoughts of the weak 
Find the golden path to the soulless dawn 
As we all revel in misanthropia 

All life ends - Fading far away 
Twisted thoughts full of morbidity 
All life ends - The shadows are a shade 
Demoniacal whIspers eternally 

Diving into the unknown 
Crawling forth the deep dark hole 
Pump our veins with calmness 
Lead our souls to the suicide throne 
Our minds are black, final moments are present 
Tear us apart in madness 
Dwells inside a circle of void 

Rapture - Come close and bring the pain 
Wipe away the thoughts of the weak 
Find the golden path to the soulless dawn 
As we all revel in misanthropia 
Rapture - Wipes away 
The golden path - Revel in misanthropia
