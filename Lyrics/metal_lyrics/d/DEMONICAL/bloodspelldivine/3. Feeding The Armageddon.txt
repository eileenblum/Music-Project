Rats bring the torment, dark clouds determinate 
Grief and pain increasing, chaos has shown its claw 

Angels of life crying, angels of death roaring 
A downfall never seen before, humanity forever lost 

Feeding the armageddon - Feeding the world collapse 
Feeding the armageddon - Spawned by satans revelation 

All life erased 
Silence is upon them 
Rites, genocide 
A curse now unleashed 

Rats bring the torment, dark clouds determinate 
Grief and pain increasing, chaos has shown its claw 

Feeding the armageddon - Feeding the world collapse 
Feeding the armageddon - Spawned by satans revelation 

All life erased 
Silence is upon them 
Rites, genocide 
A curse now unleashed 

Blood runs red, evil reality present 
Blood runs black, all dreams forgotten 

Angels of life crying, angels of death roaring 
A downfall never seen before, humanity forever lost 

Feeding the armageddon - Feeding the world collapse 
Feeding the armageddon - Spawned by satans revelation 

All life erased 
Silence is upon them 
Rites, genocide 
A curse now unleashed
