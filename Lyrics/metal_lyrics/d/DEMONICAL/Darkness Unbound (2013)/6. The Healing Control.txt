Fettered and faded
Man and insect alike
Bred to feed our hunger
As the sixth predator strikes

Your whisper for forgiveness
Now drowned in purest scorn
Through the deeds of the wicked
A new hierarchy is born

A life on the hour foretold
Beneath the throne

Quenched and taunted
All dignity be gone
Your vanquished likes be many
Your nemesis be one

A shallow mind
Spawn to feed the all-consuming flames
Your nemesis
The shepherd that we know by many names

A life on the hour foretold
Fall praise to the ruler of all
Shattered and shackled, on your own
Now and forever
Condemned to fall before my throne
Submit to the healing control

Never again shall your disease strike upon the righteous
Never again shall this world belong to you
Our cure be swift and savage, merciless and wicked
Behold the false and the feeble all as one subdue

Never again shall your disease strike upon the righteous
Never again shall this world belong to you
Our cure be swift and savage, merciless and wicked
Behold the false and the feeble praying for their souls
Submitting to the healing control

Shattered and shackles, on your own
Now and forever
Condemned to fall before my throne
Submit to the healing control

Shattered and shackles, on my own
Now and forever
Condemned to fall before his throne
Submit to the healing control
