Monuments of a monumental collapse
Going down
The touch of a smothering spirit touches no one no more
Existence
The path of the wretched exposed
The final high
A sparking dance towards the downfall

Incomplete creations
Man-made gods and laws
All going down
A Second Coming giving birth to a greater time
Persistence
The endless repetitions forms our fate
The sleep has ended
Now the many restless gather

A lurking kind
Alone as one
Restless be our ways
A hundred tongues unite as one
In the great praise

At the well
The poisoned well
She drank athirstly
Mother of delusions
Weakened
As the curtains fall
The nameless and the naked
Sharing shame once again
As the endless night devour every prayer

Mortal plague vanquished
Dead dogma feed the ever-growing hunger
Of the reborn
The greater kind
Defiance
Behold the fearless unite once again
The wait has ended as the flames engulf the filthy liars

A lurking kind
Alone as one
Restless be our ways
A hundred tongues unite as one
In the great praise

A lurking kind
Alone as one
Restless be our ways
A hundred tongues unite as one
In the great praise

As the black passage lead fearless children
Towards greater gods
The old world dies
And its prophets are all exposed as frauds

Black passage never-ending
Let your words become
The chant of the many restless;

Praise the coming of the dark
A new time is here
Behold
Its children bear our liberation's mark

Praise the great
The wait is over now
The black passage took us far above
The stars of feeble gods

And it has only just begun
