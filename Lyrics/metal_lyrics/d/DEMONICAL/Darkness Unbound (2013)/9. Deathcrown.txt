Cleansed of the pitiful stench
By the blood of tyranny
Reuniting with the darkness
As the lock has strengthen its spell
Bring all the liars to the chambers of enslavement
Come forth, roaring beast
Come forth, mighty bringer of plagues

Deathcrown
Bleed for them all
Deathcrown
Obey the profane call

Falling into endless fire
The realm of unity
The price of sins summons thee
Hordes of the forever burning
Falling through the surface of chaos
To the altar of the master
Come forth, roaring beast
Bringer of a thousand plagues

Deathcrown
Bleed for them all
Deathcrown
Obey the profane call

Soon to awake
Vengeance unleashed
The fragile circle broken
Soon to awake
The future of flesh
Words of cleansing to be spoken

Deathcrown
Bleed for them all
Deathcrown
Obey the profane call

Reveal
Deceive
Destroy
Worship the formulas of blasphemy
Dominate
Intimidate
Devour
Tortured afterlife insanity
