Your cloak of flesh is torn away
Every breath I steal from your lungs
Spasming in white hellish agony
Your fall shall be the fall of the race

Upon the altar, awaiting the blade
Unwilling sacrifice, shall be made
Life-force key to unlock the gate
To push mankind unto its fate

Black steel and blood
Drowning the heart
My words are hate
My words are death

Rising high, execution strike
Under the gaze of a foul sun
Clouds of steel create tremendous pain
The fire is slowly fading away

Black steel and blood
Drowning the heart
My words are hate
My words are death
