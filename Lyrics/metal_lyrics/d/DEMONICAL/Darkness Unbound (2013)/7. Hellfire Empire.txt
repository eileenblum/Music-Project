The Darkness calls and we will answer
Loyal sons to the wicked ones
Raising hammers and unholy banners
Leading ammo into hungry guns
No victory without destruction
No victory while they still live
Unholy beast demands bloodshed
Gladly we raise the hammer once again

Vanquished foes will stoke the flames
Unleashed upon the world
An empire in hellfire will be created

A figure head of violence and hate
We spit nails on all we see
Drive them down through stone and flesh
All will be made to suffer, made to kneel

Vanquished foes will fall with the all-consuming flames
Never-ending be our will to feed the fires

A thousand shields to break
A thousand heads to take
A thousand lives to end
A thousand lives to send - to Hell

Children rejoice to hear His voice
Burn throughout this world
Our Devil's rebirth
The Darkness calls and we will answer
Loyal sons to the wicked ones
Raising hammers and unholy banners
Leading ammo into hungry guns
No victory without destruction
No victory while they still live
Unholy beast demands bloodshed
Gladly we raise the hammer once again

Vanquished foes will stoke the flames
Unleashed upon the world
An empire in hellfire will be created

A thousand shields to break
A thousand heads to take
A thousand lives to end
A thousand lives to send - to Hell
