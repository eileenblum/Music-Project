Sacrificial blades stained red to black
From entrails conquest is divined
Swords armed to pierce the dawn
Fuel the desire to destroy
No judgement may pass from broken jaws

Tongues of priests taken as trophies
Living banners of Holy Men

Endless torments creates our marching songs
On our path towards bleeding Heavens
Strip the wings from the angels
Smirch the name of the Mother of God
As we storm the palace of Her Bastard Son

Wings of angels taken as trophies
Crippled crooks subdued again

Stone by stone, breath by breath
Into contempt
Contempt and conquest
From the entrails conquest is divined
Contempt and conquest
Leave nothing behind

Blasphemy is devouring
The steeples and crown
Paradise is found cowering
Blasphemy is devouring
Obsolete sacred grounds
Paradise is found cowering

Fresh oaths of heresy
Marks the path of our march
Into contempt
Contempt and conquest
Fallen usurper
Reborn in boiling blood
Into contempt
Contempt and conquest

Sacrificial blades stained red to black
From entrails conquest is divined
Swords armed to pierce the dawn
Fuel the desire to destroy
No judgement may pass from broken jaws

Heads of prophets taken as trophies
Mock heir failure once again

Stone by stone, breath by breath
Into contempt
Contempt and conquest
From the entrails conquest is divined
Contempt and conquest
Leave nothing behind
