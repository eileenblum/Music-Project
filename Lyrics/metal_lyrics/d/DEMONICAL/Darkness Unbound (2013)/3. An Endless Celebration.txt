Abandoned sons of treachery
Descending into the pit
A dynasty of lies and deceit
Forever to be terminated

Vivid awakening of fearless mind
At last, the time has come
For this legendary retaliation

Blazing spirit of a destined mutiny
Dismantling an age of false beliefs

Cold retorsion

Let them hang, in front of the people
Let them hang, let us spit at the cattle
Never-ending humiliation
A cause for an endless celebration

Crippled conception, vacillating faith
Triumphant redemption
Shattered empty paradigm
Travesty, the important struggle
To elude the punishment
So, let them hang and let them fall
Into the vindictive hands of the elevated

Impeccable architects of the coming age
Actuating an era of true beliefs

Cold retorsion

Let them hang, in front of the people
Let them hang, let us spit at the cattle
Never-ending humiliation
A cause for an endless celebration

Speechless they watch as the pattern form
Flawless, our surprise
As they fall into the unknown

Abandoned sons of treachery
Descending into the pit
A dynasty of lies and deceit
Forever to be terminated

Vivid awakening of fearless mind
At last, the time has come
For this legendary retaliation

Blazing spirit of a destined mutiny
Dismantling an age of false beliefs

Cold retorsion

Let them hang, in front of the people
Let them hang, let us spit at the cattle
Never-ending humiliation
A cause for an endless celebration
