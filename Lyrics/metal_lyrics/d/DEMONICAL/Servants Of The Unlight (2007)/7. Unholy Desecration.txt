[Lyrics: Schulman]

Desolation - Join the funeral march
Desecration - Spawn from an unholy ground
Join the funeral march - Spawn from an unholy ground

Into morbidity, into a sphere of a dying realm
Living eternally, open the gates to insanity
Lies and weakness, lead the feebles to the dawn
A moment of glory, as the blade cuts through the skin

This is the final command - This is the final call

Unholy desecration - Unholy desecration
666 - The sign of black

Seeds of evil, morbid hatred is coming back
Furious fire, like a bloodred thunderblaze
Crawl to the slaughter, enter the tombs of vicious death
Under the spell, the curse will forever reign supreme

This is the final command - This is the final call

Unholy desecration - Unholy desecration
666 - The sign of black

At the hour of midnight
The kingdom will rise
Troops on the hunt for flesh
A march of an eternal war

Into morbidity, into a sphere of a dying realm
Living eternally, open the gates to insanity
Lies and weakness, lead the feebles to the dawn
A moment of glory, as the blade cuts through the skin

This is the final command - This is the final call

Unholy desecration - Unholy desecration
666 - The sign of black
Unholy desecration - Unholy desecration
Hordes of evil gather for attack
