[Lyrics: Engellau]

I tear at my head with a madmans hands
Trying to extract the abnormalities within
Trapped inside this web of hatred
Confusion, despair, fear and torment

Carnal walls - Numbing my cries
Skeletal jail - Suffocating excistence

This self loathing excistence
Suffering from this crippling disease

Imprisoned by this deadly curse
I am a captive of my own mind
My veins are pumping deadly poison
Pulling me down into this sea of despair

Carnal walls - Numbing my cries
Skeletal jail - Suffocating excistence

This self loathing excistence
Suffering from this crippling disease
This self loathing excistence called life
Is tearing me apart

I am pounding at these relentless walls refusing to budge
Set me free from this hell within
Cutting my flesh open to find a way out
Trying to escape from my own insanity

This self loathing excistence
Suffering from this crippling disease
This self loathing excistence called life
Is tearing me apart
