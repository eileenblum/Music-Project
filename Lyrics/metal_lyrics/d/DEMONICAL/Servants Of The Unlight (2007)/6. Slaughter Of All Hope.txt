[Lyrics: Engellau]

My blood is draining from my veins
I scorn the open wound
Please make me dead to end all this pain
Kill me to end the torment

Drown my soul in a flood of hatred
Stream my blood into this sea of despair

Satan - Take me away
Let me feel the utmost joy
Satan - Let me die today
End my life as a jester, a toy

For as long as I have so called lived
I have longed for a release
Please take me away
To the place which you call bliss

Drown my soul in a flood of hatred
Stream my blood into this sea of despair

Satan - Take me away
Let me feel the utmost joy
Satan - Let me die today
End my life as a jester, a toy

End it all - Set me free from this life
End it all - Stain the ground with my blood

As long as I suffer I know I will be blessed
Make me experience the final torture
Kill everything that has born my name
And make me fade away into oblivion

Pointlessness overcoming me
Apathy my only guide
The face in the mirror, bleeding
Isn't mine, it's just a hoax

Drown my soul in a flood of hatred
Stream my blood into this sea of despair

Satan - Take me away
Let me feel the utmost joy
Satan - Let me die today
End my life as a jester, a toy
