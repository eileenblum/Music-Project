[Lyrics: Engellau]

Demon from hell disguised in a woman's flesh
Leading me astray
My eyes deceive me, I am blinded
By this infernal beauty

Try to touch her and you will die
Try to hold her and you will cry

Imprisoned in this woman's cell
Escape is futile
She takes me to the extreme
And gives me the utmost pain

Try to touch her and you will die
Try to hold her and you will cry in...

Pain - She will make you suffer
Disgrace - She will lead you to your death
Hatred - You will crawl
Torment - She will make you pay

My sanguinary bride, my queen of disgust
My filthy perfection, my depravity in lust

Torture comes both ways
You lie naked and bleeding
I am sharpening my knives
For a night of unbridled bloody love

Try to touch her and you will die
Try to hold her and you will cry in...

Pain - She will make you suffer
Disgrace - She will lead you to your death
Hatred - You will crawl
Torment - She will make you pay

United in torture - United in torture
