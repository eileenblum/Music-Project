[Lyrics: Engellau]

Awakening from a terrible dream
Tied to the pole of demise
Crowds are cheering, scream my name
I bow my head in disbelief

I see the flames melt my flesh
Burned alive

Glowing nails seal my coffin
My funeral is black as coal
My soul blistered by the heat
My sanity burnt at the stake

I feel the smoke collapse my lungs
Burned alive

The flames of hatred scorch my skin
This relentless fire turning me to ashes
The pain cuts like a thousand knives
On my final pyre I am being burned alive

Satan take me home
Down below where fire rules
Satan end my pain
Humanity has had its way

Descending down this fiery pit
All compassions burn away
Charred bones, all I leave behind
And a curse upon the worlds

I see the flames melt my flesh
I feel the smoke collapse my lungs
Burned alive
