The ancient walls of Karthago
Punic power in the Mediterranean
Devotion to the archaic gods

The city in state of siege
Mass sacrifice to appease the gods
Unborn ones were pledged to die

Nekropolis Karthago
Nekropolis Karthago... burn!

The rites of their forefathers
Sons and daughters pass through the fire
Burning as a gift to their deity

Infant corpses and newborn ones
Sacrificial victims on the pyre
At the place of dreadful shadows

Nekropolis Karthago
Nekropolis Karthago... burn for me!

Impenetrable mysteries of ancient times
Praying for their gods mercy
Obtain some great favor
Through the precious in their lives

They burned their sons for Baal
Godlike act of vengeance
"I demand their firstborn
That I might horrify them"

Burn for me!
The rite of human sacrifice!

Nekropolis Karthago
Nekropolis Karthago
All their sons passed through my fire
Through the rite of human sacrifice
