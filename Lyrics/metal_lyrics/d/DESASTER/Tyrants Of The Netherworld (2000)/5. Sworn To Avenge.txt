"Raise the hordes from the abyss!"
Nocturnal creatures in black armor
Gather under a dark sky
Spells are spoken in conspiracy
A chalice of blood is held high
Summon the spirits from down below
To strengthen our will and our hearts
Fearsome plans for those who oppose
We'll fight until death does us part

Sworn to avenge
In this night
The hordes will rise
For the fight
Unleash your own beast inside
Before the dawn will come we've sworn to avenge

Your fear to die is our power
So save your prayers for hope
The freedom that you stole from us
So save your prayers for hope
The freedom that you stole from us
Turns to your own death robe
Chosen to seek the oppressors of light
Black coffins are waiting for you
Your fate is sealed
There's no escape
And there's nothing that you can do

Sworn to avenge
In this night
The hordes will rise
For the fight
Unleash your own beast inside
Before the dawn will come we've sworn to avenge

Take their lives
And be strong
Chosen ones
We will triumph
In his name
Until time ends

With the instinct of a wolf
We hunger for your blood
It's too late for regrets
Your lives will end in the mud
Unconquerable as we are
With impaled heads we ride
We break the chains of slavery
Of your false white light

Sworn to avenge
In this night
The hordes will rise
For the fight
Unleash your own beast inside
Swear the oath to avenge
By these words of evil might
The hordes will rise
For the fight
Unleash your own beast inside
Before the dawn will come we've sworn to avenge
Malus occultis!
