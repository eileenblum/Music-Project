Gazing down into the vast valley
Armor shines in the last sunrays
The battle stands before I know
Ancient powers will guide our way

As long as we will beware the mysteries and the pride
As long as the magic and the instinct lead our mind
As long as the crafts of nature are keeping our souls strong
As long as the evil is living on

With a spiteful look along the hills
Still the crosses stand here on the highs
The false sign of love and light
Will be crushed by all our might

As long as we will beware the mysteries and the pride
As long as the magic and the instinct lead our mind
As long as the crafts of nature are keeping our souls strong
As long as the evil is living on

The oath...
This is the hour of all mortal agony
This is the oath of the blackened hearts
Satanic wisdom takes its place
Forever we will be strong!

A pact is made for all eternity
All powers is laid in our hands
Time will come when we will ride
And the skies will burn at night

Till we behold ourselves
In the eyes of our enemies
