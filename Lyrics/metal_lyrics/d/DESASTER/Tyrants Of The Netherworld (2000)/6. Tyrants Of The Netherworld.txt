Thunder peals like never before
The earth trembles, fire rains from the sky
At a crimson horizon all sunlight fades
The netherworld has opened its gates

Ride on hells hot winds at the nocturnal sky
Tyrants of the netherworld
Rise for his glory, so the beast is on our side
Tyrants of the netherworld

Hell-born creatures are burstin' out
On savage wings of destruction
From far beyond all human spheres
Infernal tyrants riding up from the abyss

Ride on hells hot winds at the nocturnal sky
Tyrants of the netherworld
Rise for his glory, so the beast is on our side
Tyrants of the netherworld

The arrival...

Bearing the black sign of the Goatlord
A secret might none can resist
Spreading wide their mighty wings
What men thought to know will cease to exist
The doors to the abyss are opened wide
And seas of blood cover the land
Our army gathers out on the battlefield
Summoning, him in unholy chant

"We are the almighty fire
Which burned since the beginning of time
We are of nocturnal race, now ever stronger
In Satanic name the truth is now revealed
This is the future, behold our flame
Under lunar's eye
Nature's crafts are with us this night
For the one great battle of the universe is at hand!"

"Foreseen in legends, myths and mysteries
The spirit will never die
More and more warriors are storming out from hell
We are the creatures of the dark side
Our powers have grown ever stronger
Behold the power of the night
For our true hearts are afire
Burning for all time"

With nature's crafts we will always be
For we all march into infernity
We are all masters, we are the beast
The reign of tyrants is now achieved

Ride on hells hot winds at the nocturnal sky
Tyrants of the netherworld
Rise for his glory, so the beast is on our side
Tyrants of the netherworld
