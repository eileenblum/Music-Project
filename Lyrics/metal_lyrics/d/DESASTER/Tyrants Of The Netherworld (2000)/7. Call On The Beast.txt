Cursed rites of darkness
Out where the oldest oaks stand
We praise the unholy lord
The ultimate sin we command

"We will fight - we will win"
The warriors around the stone altar speak

Night shines in our eyes
We call on the beast
Hells raging hordes
Call on the beast

Blessed in the ring of stones
Flames reach high and higher
As blood is running warm
Down from the altar of stone

"Come forth infernal master
We've lift the silver blade
Come forth possess our souls
Young virgin's life won't be saved"

"We will fight - we will win"
The warriors around the stone altar speak

Night shines in our eyes
We call on the beast
Hells raging hordes
Call on the beast

Call on the beast!

Prince of darkness hear our call
Lord of evil standing tall
Let the heavens turn to hell
By this rite, by this spell

Cursed rites of darkness
Out where the oldest oaks stand
We praise the unholy lord
The ultimate sin we command

Night shines in our eyes
We call on the beast
Hells raging hordes
Call on the beast
