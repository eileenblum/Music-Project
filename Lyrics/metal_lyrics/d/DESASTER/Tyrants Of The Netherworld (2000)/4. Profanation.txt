Spawned out from the black abyss
My name is cast with fear
Behold my signs or feel my presence
Then god's creations end is near

In league with the Devil
Black magic is blazing in me
First I'll steal your life
Then comes with me, the blasphemy

Profanation
Profanation

Silent might of an ancient race
I triumph in their will
Wherever I appear
The holy blood shall spill

I give life to the shadows
Then demons dance with me
First I'll take your soul
Then comes with me, the blasphemy

Profanation
Profanation

I am the inferno
A message of the world below
Attack the world with spite
Dark phantom of the night
