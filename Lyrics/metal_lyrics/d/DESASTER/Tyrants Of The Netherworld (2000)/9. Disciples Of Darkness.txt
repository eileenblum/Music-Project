Satanic sign of horned divine
Mark of death
Your wicked force we feel
Dark secrets are revealed
The elders' key
To wisdom and to pride
We summon up all your might
Army of vengeance
The strongest of the night
So we will burn this number into flesh
666

Disciples of darkness!
Disciples of darkness!

Secret order of black divine
From beyond
Bring malice to mankind
Dark spirits are reaching
Out of hell
Out of the other side
Hot wings of wrath spreading wide
Spreading far
Invader into the sky
Wage war against the weak and holy
666

Disciples of darkness!
Disciples of darkness!

Secret lords, royal black host
A thousand souls
Are the eyes of the night
We're all kings, of our own
Keep the truth of who sits on the throne
Apostles of the damned
We're immortal
Time cannot touch us
Forever on we will be

Blessed in fire... Satan rules at last!
