[Lemmy:]
Brothers of Metal, warriors of steel
Bang now your heads to the sound
Our violent is takin' command
Together we are standing proud

Drums are pounding, guitars are sqeeling
Whimps and posers end we will see
Bass is roaring, vocals scream wild
Now metalized blood is running free

[Chorus:]
Spikes'n Metalized Blood
Chains'n Metalized Blood
Bullets'n Metalized Blood
Leather'n Metalized Blood

[Wannes:]
Streams of blood, streams of Metal
Are blazin' in our veins
As brothers come and losers go
The Metal-cult remains

Power chords come crashing down
Screams of frantic aggression
Only the true maniac souls
Can feel the Metal possession

[Repeat Chorus]

[Okkulto:]
BANG OR BE BANGED !!!

Spikes, chains, bullets, leather
'n Metalized blood

[Toto:]
Hard and heavy, loud and proud
Our legions rule and never fall
United by Metal forever
That's burnin' in us all

Fists are risen, heads are bangin'
So it has to be
Hail to the cult of Heavy Metal
Forever and in eternity

[Repeat Chorus]
