In the last hours of a dying day
When the shades  hang deep &amp; deeper
Damnation comes upon my soul
I know my time has come again
I feel the growing need
Darkness shall ascend

Must set the night on spell
Must feel the burning stream
Behold the rising pentagram
As fire fills my heart

[Chorus:]
Obsess me, unholy shadows
Obsess my hungry heart
Where the flesh is only a prison
The magic set's the spirit free

I stare into the emptyness
My eyes can't let of it
His craffs fill my soul with life
And paint my dreams bloodred

Unveiled are my darkest desires
The temptation knows no bound
I feast in blasphemy
Bewitched by the force from below

Take me into your spheres
Take me far from here
Life can't please my desire
Lead me to the throne

Feel close to the realms of death
Far from all earthly life
Banned in endless trance
Mesmerize by the other side
The shine of evil eyes complets the scenery
Now as I'm ready for thy infernity

[Repeat:] Must set the night...

[Repeat Chorus]
