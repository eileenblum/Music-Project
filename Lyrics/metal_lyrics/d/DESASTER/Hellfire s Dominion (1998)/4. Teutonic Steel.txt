With the power of thunder
We are stormin' through the night
distant battles calling us
Damnation tolls it's bells

[Chorus:]
Command for battle now asounds
" Die by teutonic steel !!!"
Command for battle now asounds
" DIE BY TEUTONIC STEEL !!!"

The sky shines in crimson fire
Now chosen is the time
False prophets and messiah's
shall now prepare to die

[Repeat Chorus]

Sword and Axe are crushing down
The earth now drinks their blood
The blade of death knows no mercy
Our spears impale their heads

Holdin' high our steal in pride
We bear the signs of might
The hymns of once asound again
We reach the fields of triumph

And when our standards are blowin'
On the vast hills in the dawn
Then I finally know
That our time has just begun

[Repeat Chorus]
