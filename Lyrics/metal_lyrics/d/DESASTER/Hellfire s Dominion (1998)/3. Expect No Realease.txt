Receiving the infernal urge from inside
Satanas guides me tonight
Deriding the laws of your so called god
Destroyed is all hope for release

Raping the souls of the helpless &amp; weak
Here is no peace for all time
Closed are the gates of heavens above
Profanity will now be mine

[Chorus:]
You feel my grasp
But can't see me
Agony drives you to despair

Scream out in vain
There's no escape
Morbid laughter - Expect no release

Searching the truth behind the truth
Reading between the lies
Time has come for you now to pay
Soon you'll face the eclipse

Here I give life to the beast
And cast the final spell
Preachers, priests and pope
I'll take you all to hell

[Repeat chorus]
