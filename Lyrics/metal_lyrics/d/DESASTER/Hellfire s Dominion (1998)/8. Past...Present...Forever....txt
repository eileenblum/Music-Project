Dark gloryful night witness 
The power of our unholy might 
As I feel the ancient force 
Standing within the old castle walls 

[chorus] 
Here where my memories and visions unite 
Here where my mysteries never died 
Sights and dreams of evil are formed 
Here where revenge will be reborn 

Still I return to these places 
Of dark magical powers 
And a proud medieval spirit 
Which never really passed 

[repeat chorus] 

AND I CALL YOU MY BROTHERS! 

We are the fire which burns 
Without an end 
We are the warriors of a time 
Which never ended 
We are the voice of the past 
Which is present forever 

We are soul of immortal rites 
We are the force which never died 
We will enthrone a past 
Which is present forever.... 

[repeat chorus]
