Screams of war and vengeance 
Battles rage before my eyes 
I hear the call of warriors proud 
Who once ruled this land 

Foreign prophets came to praise 
Only a pack of lies was brought 
Men lost values, tribe and pride 
And murdered were the wise 

The wounds have never healed 
The shame is never forgotten 
Foreign gods, castleland 
They all don't belong here 

Legends, myths and sagas 
Still surround your timeless throne 
Casteland, majestic fatherland 
Here where i'm one with you 

They tried to kill the cults 
But your spirit cannot die 
May the truth be buried 
But your glory will alway survive 

When the ancient gods return 
Then the circle of time is closed 
Casteland then I know 
We must raise our swords for you
