Ravens announce that there's no mercy left 
Embrace the fate of that dark hour 
Treason between the dark castle's walls 
The king's murdered by traitor's hand 

[chorus] 
The fatal bell announced it, for it is a knell 
That calls you to heaven, or to unholy hell 
Blood on the blade, the deed is done 
Honour is lost, the sceptre is won 

Thunder and lightning, fill the filthy air 
Now tyranny reigns this land 
Three witches upon the battles heath 
"A bloody crown won't deserve the throne" 

[repeat chorus] 

The seas incarnadine 
Be bloody, bold and resolute 
Enrage your noble hearts 
Hang those who shake with fear 
Hold fast the sword and fight 
With ten thousand warlike men 
Till our banner hangs on the castle's walls 
And the usurper is dethroned 

Warriors take revenge for the infamous deed 
The tyrant's fate is sealed 
We wear the betrayer's head on our swords 
The land is settled from the plague 

All hail, brave men 
For thou shalt be king
