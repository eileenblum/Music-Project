Flames are dancing in my eyes 
Firey glance shows no disguise 
The devil's mark is shining clear 
Fullmoon lurks, now hell is near 

With eyes of evil now I can see 
The darkside opens it's gates for me 
I feel the lust and burning pain 
See horny flames who shall domain 

[bridge] 
Ruler of infernal fire 
Light my eyes with dark desire 
Words of wisdom calling for hell 
Words of holy can't break my spell 

[chorus] 
Hellfire's dominion [x4]

[repeat bridge] 

[repeat chorus] 

Evil voices summon the night 
For the one to spread his wings 
Souls of black eagerly awaiting 
The coming of the horned 

And in the depths of the underworld 
Our unholy chants will be heard 
Master rise with horns of death 
And we will be prepared
