As the goal set it's goal
The I will set it's mark!

Twilight falls and hate reign
Demons close the rising gates
Testimony of the wicked once
Temptation feeds the killing hand

Spill your soul to the ones ahead
Keep in enemies closest lines
Watch the bleeding sky
As they rot, eaten alive

Possessed Defiled
Rejected by the ones obscure
Possessed Defiled
Infiltrate thy masters art
Possessed Defiled

Lock their jaws into your veins
Blasting strike hits from beyond
Obscure treasure for your death remain
My own kingdom, what fine domain

Trapped in mortal, soulless solitude
The oath will face your fears of death
Infiltrade bloodred skies
Feel them rot, eat them alive

Possessed Defiled
Rejected by the ones obscure
Possessed Defiled
Infiltrate thy masters art
Possessed Defiled

Eat all alive!
Teach them with his tongue
Insatible hellspawn arise in carnal lust
Don't fear the powers of Satan
Safe the breed
Carnage for your souls to lead
To empire of eternal dust
