Walking the dead in filthy dreams
Vomiting out fevered destiny
Forged and beanded violently
Taking breath as it has meant to be

Death injection to the bone
Won't be bored from hell we know
For existence my grotesque
A faithful everlasting breath

Insanity lies within the mind
Strangled views of morbid sight, of morbid sight
Come bring the mob to cross horizons
Sterilize and exercise them

Beyond your grace I cum spitting hell for healing wombs
Your virginity dethroned

Deranged, dethroned the sheep of light
Poisoned speak of feeble pride, of feeble pride
Come bring the mob to cross horizons
Sterilize and exercise them

Beyond your grace I cum spitting hell for healing wombs
Your virginity dethroned

Covenant for making dreams
Sold out hero obviously
Feeding conflict fucking slaves
Endorsed by Satan, mastery insane, insane
Pure sickness was grown
Horned damnation as we know
For the blessed by Satan's might
Waking souls and thinking mind

Beyond Your Grace I cum
