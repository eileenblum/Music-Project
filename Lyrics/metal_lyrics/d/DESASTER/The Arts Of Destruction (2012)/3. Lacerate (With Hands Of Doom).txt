Lacerate with rays of doom
Solarwinds will bring it through
At dawn the silence absolute
L a c e r a t e

Under her command all flesh is doomed
Eliminator of all earthly tools
Lifegiver, now engulf your souls
Her shades of fire will suerly rule the night
The phoneix for a life unknown
The healer with the devils tongue

Lacerate with rays of doom
Solarwinds will bring it through
At dawn the silence absolute
L a c e r a t e

Welcome fine princess, deny them in eternal fire
Burn there souls to ashes
And hail the blessings for the sick

The death star in this cosmic pool
First giver of all life you know
Leave your skinless corpus now
Your bones will surelt dust the ground

Lacerate with rays of doom
Solarwinds will bring it through
At dawn the silence absolute
L a c e r a t e

Under her command all flesh is doomed
Eliminator of all earthly tools
Lifegiver, now engulf your souls
Her shades of fire will suerly rule the night
The phoneix for a life unknown
The healer with the devils tongue

Lacerate with rays of doom!
