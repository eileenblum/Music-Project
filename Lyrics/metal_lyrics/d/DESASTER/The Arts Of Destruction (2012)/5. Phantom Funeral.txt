Are you afraid? Deny the poison
The whispering silence is at hand
Voice of life's morality
Beyond all boundaries of fate

Eternal death wish from above
Including life's of few belongings
The sentence of a world apart
The essence of their sheltered hearts

Phantom funeral
Pestilent ways of salvation

Way the crown of all life's end
Praised in centuries to come
To speak the fears to bring hell's plague
Only hope won't be enough

Or is it nothingness to fear
Destiny until the end
The sentence of a world apart
The essence of their sheltered hearts

Phantom funeral
Pestilent ways of salvation

Graves wide opet, speeches low
Horny priests welcum on sorrow
Blackest feast of Bion's seed
Unspoken sickness of a broken elite

Bound by sin trapped in sorrow
Reign of fear blind death tomorrow
Wishing hell for the sheltered breed
Eternally their souls to bleed

Graves wide opet, speeches low
Horny priests welcum on sorrow
Blackest feast of Bion's seed
Unspoken sickness of a broken elite

Graves
Priests
Fear
Sorrow

Phantom funeral
Pestilent ways of salvation
