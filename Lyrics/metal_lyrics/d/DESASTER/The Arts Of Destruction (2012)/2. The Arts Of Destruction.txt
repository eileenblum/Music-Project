Evolution went dead my friend
Noble nightmare won't exist again
This is the art of destruction my friend
Command to blow this world again

The Art of Destruction
Purest fire, reaping flame
Fear the blade of the insane
The Art of Destruction

Execute few life again
Fine salvation on the fastest lane
Pull all triggers hit the smart
Fistfuck this world and its crowd real hard

And it ends in flames

Thermonuclear fest with the beast bare the witness of death and of time
This is beauty of darkness from the bottomless pits
Where no soul can survive
Send clear solution grand bringer of nuclear clarity
Keep in mind what fine virus you are
Like survival reactions can save, but once no escape
Keep in mind what fine virus you are

Evolution went dead my friend
Noble nightmare won't exist again
This is the art of destruction my friend

Pure arts of destruction to come
End time, sometime, forever at time
Hail to weapons mastery
