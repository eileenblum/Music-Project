Waste of flesh

Oh, holy priest, the mighty lord
Will give you strength to rape them all
The punishement the last you get
Will cut your face and steal your breathe

Vile We Dwell
These morals cut the play

Is it justice you are crying for
Ok,lets rape the holy whore
With gleamy steel I'll wide your holes
For setting free the holy ghost

Vile We Dwell
I wish them hell
To feces they fell
Vile

Waste of flesh

Assassin of the virgin bride
Lets get in contact with my knife
Pleaser come to me you bloody tool
I'll break your neck you broken fool

Vile We Dwell
These morals cut the play

Mass murders I'll await you fine
Preparing for your sacred shrine
Your tan I'll cut your bones I'll clean
To build your new reality

Vile We Dwell
I wish them hell
To feces they fell
Vile We Dwell

Unworthy for the gift of life
Marched on poisonned, fucked up soil
Infects the soul, cursed the goal
These visions now will crush us all

Vile We Dwell
I wish them hell
To feces they fell
No need to tell
I wish hell
