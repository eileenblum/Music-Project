The message from hell
Is casting a spell
With demons in the back
We're ready for attack
Leather and beer
Posers will fear
This is the night
Of Hellbangers might

Stormbringers - Hellbangers
Stormbringers - Hellbangers...

The undead arise
The devil in their eyes
Die another day
More women to slay
We raise our fists
And bang in the mist
To the last one we stand
On hellbangers land

Stormbringers - Hellbangers
Stormbringers - Hellbangers ready to burn...

Come on! Bang Your Fucking heads for the master in hell!
Break your fucking neck

Forever to burn
Open the gates
Now it's your turn
Hell no longer awaits

Stormbringers - Hellbangers
Stormbringers - Hellbangers ready to burn and to rape this hall
