The Venomous
Stench

I believe in purgatory surely better for own health
Consume your deepest hate to triple and infect
I prefer to hail the goat the horniest of us all
Obey your every sin to reign your dreams in filth

Inhale the blackness
Deliver us to evil
Spread the Venomous Stench

Born to lose but baptised in hell's fire
A collection of souls will feed my own desire
No need for execution no final retribution
The Blackness swallows it all

Inhale the blackness
Branded by evil
Spread the Venomous Stench

Can you smell it
Venomous Stench

Inhale the blackness
Deliver us to evil
Spread the Venomous Stench
