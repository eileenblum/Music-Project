From the first light as I crawl the womb
To the glory days of now
A destiny I always follow
A warrior's path! No days of sorrow
Razor Ritual
Come on death take me I can't await
Take me and bring thy sword
I will die by my own hand to curse and break them all
The Razor Ritual

Hunting is my favorite game
The fight, the war eternal love
Break the will of enemies
Curse their souls then kill 'em all

[Repeat refrain]

Come to the bleeding...
...Let's die tonight...
...And now my life is fading...

And now my life is fading - glory end reward
Their torture never stops - my faith still strong
It's time to take the blade - and end life right now
No triumph for my mob
Razor Ritual

Own redeemer break out the blade
And feed the demons at the tunnels to hell

Deny their poison invoke the strength
Bleed for yourself right now
Afterlife your dearest goal
Release your blood and spill your soul
To curse and kill'em all
The Razor Ritual

Victory my truest comrade
My friend my nearest bride
But hell I await these days
Ambushed by countless enemies

Razor Ritual
Cut
