Raping signs of virtue
Enslave the creatures of apathy
Deny the souls of majority
Beyond this point of destiny
With poisonned tears from all thy heavens
All tyrants to their knees
Execute the cancer
Penetrate the living
Invade the dead

For every sin not sinned
A flock to all holes
For blessing hypocisy
Megatons of doom

Hellish blesssing from the Tyrannizer [x2]

Doctrine exposure
Razor-sharp insanity
The burning
The burning never fails

For choosing the way of the waste
Chaos will come true
For betraying the arts of pure life
Stirred up by feeble might

A covenant with Lucifer first sees
But a lovely tune of death to be
Better dwell in hell's fire
Feed the final desire

Is the whore [x2]

Embracing fine desaster
And learn with my saints

Hellish blessings from the Tyrannizer [x2]

Doctrine exposure
Razor-sharp insanity
The burning
The burning never fails

[Repeat first verse]

Raping signs of virtue
Enslaved the creatures of apathy
All tyrants to their knees
Invade death
