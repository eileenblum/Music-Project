Fear the endless race, a morbid dream
The tasteful breathe of agony
All gates, these walls their curtains fall
While astral shapes of wisdom call

All visions of profanation
Fills my souls with pride
All cancers to kill the prophets
Hard trained to infect the right

May the shadows be eternal
And the fate forever flesh
Hope the poison held their sleep
Enough to break and save the breed

All your hopes for an afterlife
A mastershit for your eternal life
Enslaved by what they've done before
A tragedy this human score

[Repeat Refrain]

And save the breed...

The circle that will bring the wilt
Will recreate and recreate
Neither the crown of evolution
Nor thy master's favourite act
A blast of mind and blood
And flesh its destiny...Rot...

Respect the powers of all unknown
But sharp your claws for first attack
Fate forever
Bring the final evolution
Kings of execution
Fate Forever Flesh

All visions of profanation
Fills my souls with pride
All cancers to kill the prophets
Hard trained to infect the right

[Repeat Refrain]

Fate Forever Flesh
