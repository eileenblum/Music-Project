Blessed be within the beauty of the night
On furious wings of anger
On victorious wings we ride
We command the claw of death
The hate of war we bare
To protect this forgotten shrine
A journey through all lakes of fire
Through all those freezing deserts
But that's the way we rule supreme
Refreshing the flame eternally

Behind these walls of doom we dwell
Beneath the frozen flames of hell
Our weapons forged with purest might
To kill with power and easily win the fight
The devil taught us a long time
To reign the beauty and the fine
The signs of hell we carry on
It's the fuck of death we are addicted to

Save your lousy powers!
This is not the way it was meant to be
Naturally forged in purest ecstasy
The hell it owns you can't control
It's just alliance to the powerthrone

This is the command of blazing metal
This is the essence of it all
There is no way of satisfaction
Without the beauty of this storms

In command of violent fate
The powers of death to keep
And that's the way!
It was meant!
To be!

Blessed be within the beauty of the night
On furious wings of anger
On victorious wings we ride
We command the claw of death
The hate of war we bare
To protect this forgotten shrine
A journey through all lakes of fire
Through all those freezing deserts
But that's the way we rule supreme
Refreshing the flame eternally
