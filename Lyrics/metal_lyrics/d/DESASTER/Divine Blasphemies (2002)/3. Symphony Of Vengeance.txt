Early morning silent dawn
A flash of light by thousand swords
Hostile legion invade the land
Death by the blade before you wake

Symphony of vengeance
Their blood on my hands
Symphony of vengeance
Fear my abyss
Symphony of vengeance
Asound to conqueror
To spread damnation
Possessed by vengeance
Feared in vengeance
Crowned in vengeance
Symphony of vengeance

Years passed by our powers grow
Inexorable force from down below
Prepared to fight armed in steel
To teach them death on sacred fields

Symphony of vengeance
Their blood on my hands
Symphony of vengeance
Fear my abyss
Symphony of vengeance
Asound to conqueror
To spread damnation
Possessed by vengeance
Feared in vengeance
Crowned in vengeance
Symphony of vengeance

And now our time has come
A reward for what they have done
Unchain hateful powers now
To give 'em hell!
To give 'em hell right now!

Early morning silent dawn
A flash of light by thousand swords
Infernal legion rape their land
Death by the blade before they wake
Armed!
In!
Steel!

Symphony of vengeance
Their blood on my hands
Symphony of vengeance
Fear my abyss
Symphony of vengeance
Asound to conqueror
To spread damnation
Possessed by vengeance
Feared in vengeance
Crowned in vengeance
Symphony of vengeance
