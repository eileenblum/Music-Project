Teeth cut with steel
Black arrows find their mark
Wailing priests are answered
Head split by axe

Gates fall to the ram
Onslaught of evil kill
Invoked is the command
Death strike!!!

Grim lord of the mound
We call forth doom and death
With blood, fire and spell
We summon hell's breath

The tower set ablaze
Broken shields and corpses remain
Sacrifice is slaughter
Black winds carry the souls of the slain

Gates fall to the ram
Onslaught of evil kill
Invoked is the command
Death strike!!!

Spare no coward
Spare no coward

The dying are put to spear
Flames lick at the sky
With sword and mace attack
Forces of devastation ride

Gates fall to the ram
Onslaught of evil kill
Invoked is the command
Death strike!!!

You can run!
But you cannot hide!
