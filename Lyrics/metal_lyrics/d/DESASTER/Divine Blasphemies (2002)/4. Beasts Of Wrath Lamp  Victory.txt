With the devil's mark
Deep in my eyes
I hail those ancient glory times
As watcher beneath the skies
In silence grand and divine

I would never lead again - my legions that strong
I could never believe - what happened
My strongest plague to thee
Who banned me to this damned infinity

It's only beast in man!

Curse the ones of holy light and faith
Long lost mankind's demon - father in sadistic hate
Inspire deep dark forces - awake the crafts in me
Calling with disease - heal the wounds they have done unto thee

Beasts of wrath and victory
Bringer of damnation - wrath and victory
Beasts of wrath and victory
Stir up my fires - wrath and victory

We soon will strike in hate - hellfire by my side
And all that once was ours - we soon possess again
Spitting on the enemies - the slaves of false white light
Master of the blackest hordes - grant me your dark might

Beasts of wrath and victory
Bringer of damnation - wrath and victory
Beasts of wrath and victory
Stir up my fires - wrath and victory

Beasts of wrath and victory
Bringer of damnation - wrath and victory
Beasts of wrath and victory
Stir up my fires - wrath and victory

Returning from the fields beyond
Lie in wait to attack aggressively
And now I lead again
My legions that strong
Just easy to see
What happened?
For my powers to keep
Escaping from this damned infinity

Beasts of wrath and victory
Bringer of damnation - wrath and victory
Beasts of wrath and victory
Stir up my fires - wrath and victory

Heal the wounds of a thousand years!
