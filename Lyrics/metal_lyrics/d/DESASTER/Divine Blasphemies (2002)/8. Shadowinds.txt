I call to thee
Dear, morbid one
Unleash temptation to us all!

Prepared in life to run with the dead
Ensorcelled by a force beyond
Motivated by burning darkness
A lifetime for his master's grace
Shades of filth
Arise!

Coldest winds raised in the north
A hymn to the creatures of the frost
Nocturnal specter hunts the light
Hellfire easily wins the fight

Arise shadowinds!
Strike back!
Shadowinds!

Darkest clouds paint black the sky
Your feeble life's are worthless!
Die
Can't withstand the forces of the moon
Purgatory soon shall rule

Arise shadowinds!
Strike back!
Shadowinds!
And now step into this burning infernity!

Embraced by winds of blazing fire
Blown by storms
A truth beyond
This is existence without sin and damnation
A fallen kingdom to conquer again
Take this hand!
Lead by!
Under command of the shadowinds

Prepared in life to run with the dead
Ensorcelled by a force beyond
Motivated by burning darkness
A lifetime for this masters grace

Screams of anguish filled the night
Last daylight forever died
Eternal frost covers this earth
Frightened souls forever lost
Cause praying masters at any cost
Nocturnal winds stir up my soul
I call to thee not kneel before
Not afraid to stand before death's door
Trapped by the burning impurity

Arise shadowinds!
Strike back!
Shadowinds!
And now step into this burning infernity!
