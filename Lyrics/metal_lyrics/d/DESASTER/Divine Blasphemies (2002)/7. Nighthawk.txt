Dwelling beneath the ancient stones
Deep down in the mist
A black creature dressed in feathers
Secret king of a dying race
In the shadow of a thousand stars
Upon whirling cloud she rides
His flight echoes across the sky
Gently he flies...
Nighthawk!

Nighthawk
Spreads devil's might
Nighthawk
See with evil eyes
Nighthawk
Death by sight
Beware of the nighthawk

Lead by the rays of the moon
Touching the horizons
Reigns with supremacy
In utter darkness
Messenger from a world beyond
Of old wisdom that still prevails
On the hills he is sitting proud
Watching you
Nighthawk

Nighthawk
Spreads devil's might
Nighthawk
With see him fly
Nighthawk
Death by sight
Beware of the nighthawk

Black are his eyes
That stare at you
To crack your will with a threatening delight
Feel his power and feel his might
Winged king from a blackened sky
Spread your mighty wings again!

Dwelling beneath the ancient stones
Deep down in the mist
A black creature dressed in feathers
Secret king of a dying race
In the shadow of a thousand stars
Upon whirling cloud she rides
His flight echoes across the sky
Gently he flies...
Nighthawk!

Nighthawk
Spreads devil's might
Nighthawk
See with evil eyes
Nighthawk
Death by sight
Beware of the nighthawk
The end now's come for you
