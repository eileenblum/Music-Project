Burning fields behind me
The ground is soaked with blood
The sun has lost its power
Destruction is my name
Prophecies announced my coming
Sorcery has given me strength
Invoking this spectral dusk
Calling the end of the world

Visions guided my way
Once so vague, now so clear
Once I saw their downfall
Now I ride
Within the storm
The ground is breaking up
Their nightmare is unchained
Vast wings at the horizon
These wings of death are mine

Iron winds of darkness
Invisible force from below
As a phantom I've become
As the stormbringer I will go

Unite my winds, unite
Approach from the unknown lands
Their world will fall in ruins
As your silhouette rises aglow

I swear you in the deeps
Open the gate in the distance
When daylight has disappeared
I await your arrival
Arrival!

Iron winds of darkness
Invisible force from below
As a phantom I've become
As the stormbringer I will go

The misty air starts to clear
The last screams die away
My spiteful eyes reflect (and follow)
Your devastating trace
When flames aspire to Heaven
All holiness deprived
A kingdom born from our belief
Satan s work is done
