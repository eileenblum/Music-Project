At the buried ground in the night time
When the moon is full and clear
Buried deep in the hard ground
An unholy place in the night

Beware the face of darkness
If your soul is full with fear
Beware the face of darkness
Whenever it s your rear

Blasphemic words are spoken
Bewitched and possessed by evil
Your eyes are filled with tears
If you re scared you will be buried

Beware the face of darkness
If your soul is full with fear
Beware the face of darkness
Whenever it s your rear

Wake up before you are dying
The innocent ones will be damned
Pray to your God if he s really existing
There s no hope to escape
At midnight you see
Strange things that become reality

The dark one waits in the night
Takes you to a place of evil
Beware if you are too slowly
To escape from the face of darkness

Beware the face of darkness
If your soul is full with fear
Beware the face of darkness
Whenever it s your rear
