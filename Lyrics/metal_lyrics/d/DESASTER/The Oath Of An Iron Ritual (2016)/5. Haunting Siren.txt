The hunt is on
Cold, so cold the night
Gleaming mountain sight
Eldritch flows the Rhine
Forever I will hear your call

Haunting siren sing
Incinerating rhymes
Take me to the depths
Drown my feeble life - Haunting Siren

This fable of old
Sorrow burns my mind
Lovely maidens Flair
Brings darkness, Ends all light
In foggy night no see
Voices over all
Invited to thy dreams
Invited to let life
Forever I will hear your call

Haunting siren sing
Incinerating rhymes
Take me to the depths
Drown my feeble life - Haunting Siren

Blood to water - Inhale my tiny Soul
Now I feel my life will end
But fear won't shake my sight

Haunting Siren

Jagged cliff ahead
Insane rhymes driving me
Boatman aboard
Black water to my lungs
And now I am forever her

Jagged cliff - Weaken my flesh
Embrace the voice from far beyond
Find the secret Soul
To Exit life

Insanity and Beauty - cover my Soul
Waves and darkness - cover my world
Cover the world

Drowned and forsaken
As silence awaits me
I was forever

The hunt is on
Cold, so cold the night
Gleaming mountain sight
Eldritch flows the Rhine
Forever I will hear your call
And now I am forever her

Haunting Siren
