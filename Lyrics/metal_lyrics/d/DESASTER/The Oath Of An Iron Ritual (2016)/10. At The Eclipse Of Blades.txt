Monotheistic excursion
Fatal spores support the fall
Bleeding breed spawns bitter seed
Degeneration is at hand

At The Eclipse Of Blades, Death proof till your emptiness
At The Eclipse Of Blades, Might enthroned, just reconstructed

Salt and poison to all soils
Purest ignorance and fear
Smiling lambs to feed their hunger
At all altar's slay what's holy

At The Eclipse Of Blades, Death proof till your emptiness
At The Eclipse Of Blades, Might enthroned, just reconstructed

Define what's fucking being
It's death the only cure
Forever ashes what shall be
Chaos breed eternity

Genes to deny, Enthroned by blood
Lies &amp; morals, Extracted minds

Death shall be the only cure

Define what's fucking being
It's death the only cure
Forever ashes what shall be
Chaos breed eternity

At The Eclipse Of Blades, Death proof till your emptiness
At The Eclipse Of Blades, Might enthroned, just reconstructed

Send them to their maker
That's what the profit is
Can't detest, sickness within
Swallow all the acid sins

At The Eclipse Of ...Blades

Infernal: guitars
Odin: bass
Tormentor: drums
Sataniac: vocals
