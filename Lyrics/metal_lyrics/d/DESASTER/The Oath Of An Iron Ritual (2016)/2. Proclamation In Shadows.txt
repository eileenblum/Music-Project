With Tools of damnation
Prepare your wings true blasphemer
As thy legions blessed by sacrifice
Demise of light the silent Termination
The rising of Imagination
The ending of all what`s pride

Outcast for eternity
Some souls will left behind
Proclamation in shadows
Tranquilize the hungry

Foe of death and destruction
Baptized in fear by the lifeless
Beyond control infinity with fail
Creator of this sick abomination
Master of Annihilation
Bring the fall of all what`s pride

Outcast for eternity
Some souls will left behind
Proclamation in shadows
Tranquilize the hungry

Unscarred predators feel the Need
The rising of eternal hunger
Extermination is the key
As dreams work for mortality

This is the Domination of shadows
Suicide feast at the dawn of time

Proclamation in shadows
