The Oath of an Iron Ritual

Insane Dogs, eliminators of the light
Mentors of perdition, children born of fire
Is it victory on horizon
The new dawn has taken place

Oath Of Iron Ritual

Black poison infiltration
The cult invades the soul

Pleasures of devastation
Fine, sweet, pure

The nightsky will guide us
To the holyness of death
The fires that lead us
The teacher to all

The Oath of an Iron Ritual The Oath of an Iron Ritual

Hellish interventions
The power you earn
An abyss to reign
Kingdoms will fall

The Oath of an Iron Ritual The Oath of an Iron Ritual

Insane Dogs, eliminators of the light
Mentors of perdition, children born of fire
Victory is ours
And hell has taken place
