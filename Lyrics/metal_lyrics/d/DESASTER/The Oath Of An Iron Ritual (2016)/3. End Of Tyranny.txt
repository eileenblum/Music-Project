A new dawn rise to conquer
Unchain all mortal hearts
Hunting down tyrannic plague
Justice and own paradise

False honours, lies, monuments in pain 
End of tyranny

No longer held in silence
Your damnation has just begun
With calls from million graves
We gather, we breed the spawn

False honours, lies, monuments in stone
False honours, lies, monuments insane

Tyrants of the earth beware 
We are crambling at your thrones
Reign is over, might engulfed
Your journeys end, deaths kingdom come

End of tyranny

Enslavements final end
Won't serve your mental weakness
The universe won't count on you 
The stars don't need your pride

End of tyranny

A new dawn rise to conquer
Unchain all mortal hearts
Hunting down tyrannic plague
Justice and own paradise

False honour, lies, monuments in dust
