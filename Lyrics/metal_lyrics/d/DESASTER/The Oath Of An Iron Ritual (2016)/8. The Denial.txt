What is the prize for redemption...
...within eternities halls of fear?

First fall from womb
Into youths pride eyes
Embracing life programmend in time

Fucked
The Denial
Devil or fool the race on
The Denial
Virus for a trivial end

Poisoned void possess me now
Universal Soul to rise
Poisoned stream choke my flame
Eternity to strike

Virus spawn can`t take control
None and nothing
Your star will fall

Burned
The Denial
Devil or fool the race on
The Denial
Virus for a trivial end

Hallowed voice erase yourself
Universe won`t care
Eternal death blow my wings
Eternity will fall

What is the prize for redemption...
...within eternities halls of fear?
Life...
