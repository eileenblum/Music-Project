[Okkulto10/95]

beware your mortal soul from the bloodsucking creatures of the night,or 
taste the wine of immortality

the midnight bell stars to toll
a cold mist surrounds the shining moon
the cemetary lies in a delusive sleep
someone prowls through the dark

deep in the icecold mountains
where the air freezes the souls
where all human life ends
the palace of dracul is built

young innocent life
taste the wine of immortality
the flavour of the sweet death
an elixir to infinity

a restless coffin in the crypt
the smell of blood fills the air
wolves howl to the moon
i awake. dracul's son.
