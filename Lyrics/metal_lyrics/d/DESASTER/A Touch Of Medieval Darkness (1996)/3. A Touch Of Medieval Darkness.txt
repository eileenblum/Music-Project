[Okkulto 8/95]

A night by the castle's side,enjoy the power of the silence and obscure 
nature,feel the forgotten spirits

the last weak light
is burning on my skin
when i feel the shadows
a message of the night

mountains rise
before the dying sun
night will rise
till'the next short day

all sunlight is gone
black clouds wander
i sit under the nightsky
by the castle's side

dream and reality unite
everything seems endless
the pictures of the time
here they rule forever

through the depths of mind
i fly alone
crossing ages so dark
when the lie was brought

shadows dance around me
a whispering into my ear
those who died proud
take me to their realm

faster goes my journey
deeper in the time
will i reach my goal
before dawn will rise ?

horses storm through valleys
warriors call my name
the skyline is in flame
blood drops in my hands

a travel in eternity
passing my whole life
wounded is my body
in which battle i fought ?

sorrow falls upon me
i dream in time and space
i fought i fly eternally
a sunbeam kills my dream...
