Spawn out to this place
Just another sheep born to die
Always stabbed from behind
But deaths still my comrade! Alive!
Evolution is calling! Still burning your sickening minds!
But you ran out of time worthless dwell with a fate fucked and tired!
Vermin!

Downfall! Be Thy Blade!
Downfall! Still My Blade!

Possessed by hell itself
Grown up within this madness
The way of victory to choose
Path of evo...
...lution is calling! Still burning your sickening minds!
But you ran out of time worthless dwell with a fate fucked and tired!
Pestilence!

Downfall! Be Thy Blade
Downfall! Still My Blade

And this is the art of damnation!
Fix this fine abomination!

Now unleashed all the fury, the glory we've once possessed
Entangle the believers within struggles of own emptiness
The thought that I guide
The fist that they fear
The force we belong
Their Downfall to bring

Downfall! Be Thy Blade
Downfall! Still My Blade

Cause!
Evolution is calling! Still burning your sickening minds!
But you ran out of time worthless dwell with a fate fucked and tired!

Downfall! Thy Blade!
