The dawn just rise to conquer
The night just sends its thoughts
Desires laid to rest forever
My goal near to finish

Under my command the claws of death
All winds of doom unite
A chapter to close for existence to win
To save the end of times

Forsaken idols shall burn in flames
New strength will rise to stand
Sadistic intent subconscious need
To set this world on fire

Consuming ugly roots, breathing undead tools
Emerging from what's called life [x2]

Breathing hate just kill'em all
Nihilistic Overture
Curse them in eternity
Nihilistic Entity
Nihilistic Overture

Pray and beg right now
Your saviours our fall
Another end is near
Nothingness to fear

Under my command the claws of death
All winds of doom unite
A chapter to close for existence to win
To save the end of times

For thy be the one who poisoned your well
First crowned by darkness to lead the mass insane
Prepared for damnation, created to hate life
Testimony of sickness, rotting roots, bleeding minds

Just the first step to damnation, on the edge the bleeding souls
Come around and face your maker do you think he is at home?
Now take the step accept the fact that death reward is all you get
To face this truth and sail with death among the course this world has set
