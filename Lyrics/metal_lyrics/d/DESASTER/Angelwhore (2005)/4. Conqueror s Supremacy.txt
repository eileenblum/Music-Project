Breed of justice
Take their pride
Cleanse their souls
Break their minds
Engulfing all what's Trinity

Breed of renewal
Burn their eyes
Engulf their signs
Teach them life

Demonspawn
Rise in chaos
Kiss the world
With lips of doom
Goodbyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeee!!!

True prayers of profanation
Hunters of Hades unite

Might be a force of evolution
Or only sinners for all time

A vision to go far damned far
To reach all places touch the stars
A force to recreate the will to power
Ancient dream feeds futures lullaby

A race to gates to clear it all!
To face the infinite truth of all!
To mark your path with signs you spread!
And catch the goal that once was set!
Eternity to take! Immortality to break!
An astral journey! Now make it home!

Conqueror's Supremacy - Needful destruction of all sanctuary
Conqueror's Supremacy

Chaos voids in which we dwell
Constructed by vengeful hate
But the stars I lid so dark beyond
Absorb the poison that I taste so strong

A race to gates to clear it all!
To face the infinite truth of all!
To mark your path with signs you spread!
And catch the goal that once was set!
Eternity to take! Immortality to break!
An astral journey! Now make it home!

Get rid of all this holy prey
The ignorance the words of dread
To create what's worth own paradise
Born to level next
In silence with this furious violence
To connect with sentenced souls
