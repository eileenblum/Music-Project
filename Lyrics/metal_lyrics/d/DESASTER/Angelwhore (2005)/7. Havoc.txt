Perverse hells obscurity
Morbid world reality
Raping all their vanity
On heavens killing fields
Pure violent philosophy
Rage for order, hell supreme
Souls of sickness hear the call
Await the final fall

Raise Hell! Havoc
Feeble existence ready to burn
Break out the knife the tables have turned
Cut your own path fight fire with fire
Sacrifice this world on its pyre
Home sweet havoc

Havoc

Embrace damnation dearest friend
Consuming faithful winds
Please hate life at all
Lovely demonspawn
Hordes of chaos rise
Cut eternal life
End this foolish pride
Havoc mass

It's only violence that increases
All their faces fall to faeces
New ashes for creation
Given by life's annihilation
A call to fit our destiny
To end our own supremacy
Hammered by renewal
Put to death, silent ruin
But sing along to this end
