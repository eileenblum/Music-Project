You live your life
As you are told to do
Your live your life
For someone else's values
They always telling you
What's right or wrong
We won't follow
You're on your own
In that puppet show

You'll never steal my life away
We're breaking the chains

We're fighting for our rights
And our believes
We won't follow
Your way to heaven
Blind are leading blind
To immortality
And all you'll ever find
Will still be a living hell

You are so blind
By what you can't see
You throw away your life
To nothing than a dream
Break the chains now
To be free some day
We'll never follow you
To be a pawn in this wicked game

You'll never steal my life away
We're breaking the chains

Fighting for our rights
And our believes
We won't follow
Your way to heaven
You throw away your life
For a fantasy
We rather choose our fate
Than live a lie
We're fighting for our rights
And our believes
We won't follow
Your way to heaven
Blind are leading blind
To immortality
And all you'll ever find
Will still be a living hell

Fighting for our rights
And our believes
We won't follow
You way to heaven
You rather live your life
In a fantasy
And all you ever find
Will still be hell

Fighting for our rights
And our believes
We won't follow
Your way to heaven
You throw away your life
For a fantasy
We rather choose our fate
Than live a lie
We're fighting for our rights
And our believes
We won't follow
Your way to heaven
Blind are leading blind
To immortality
And all you'll ever find
Will still be a living hell
