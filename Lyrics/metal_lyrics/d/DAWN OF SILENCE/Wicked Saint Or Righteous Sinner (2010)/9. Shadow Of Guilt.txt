Deceiving
Mistreating
Betray and fail
The ones you really love
See the darkness in disguise
Denying and lying
Your fragile mind
Navigates you blind
As the guilt controls your life

On your own this war to fight
You cannot win
On your own
You have to live with the shame

Live in the shadows of guilt
With the traitors and deceivers
In the shadow of guilt
Ashamed of whom you really are
Live in the shadow of guilt
Wicked saint or righteous sinner
In the shadow of guilt
Ashamed of what you really are
Live in the shadow of guilt

The voices are calling
This pale black shades
Of countless sins
You know you can't deny
Devastated
Suffocating
In your darkened room
You'll be left behind
Imprisoned by the guilt

On your own this war to fight
You cannot win
On your own
You have to live with the shame

Live in the shadows of guilt
With the traitors and deceivers
In the shadow of guilt
Ashamed of whom you really are
Live in the shadows of guilt
Wicked saint or righteous sinner
In the shadow of guilt
Ashamed of what you really are

Forgotten by a God
An existence you have always doubted
You must go to seek shelter
Somewhere far away
Close your eyes
Face the demons of your mind
Release the pain

Live in the shadow of guilt
With the traitors and deceivers
In the shadow of guilt
Ashamed of whom you really are
Live in the shadow of guilt
Wicked saint or righteous sinner
In the shadow of guilt
Ashamed of what you really are
Live in shadow of guilt
