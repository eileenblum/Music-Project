Behind these walls
I've lived my life
A long time in loneliness
Desolated in my own demise
Memories from a time
Of silence and emptiness
But now I leave my past behind

An undefined creature
Made me believe
And now I strive for the life
I once denied

Here I am once again
Back from the dead now here me calling
I've returned to seek my destiny
Here I am once again
What brought me back while I was falling
I need to know are you my destiny?

A silent night
I still remember it like yesterday
My awakening
My soul revived
Like a dream
A shining light on the starless sky
You brought me out of the cage of fear

An undefined creature
Made me believe
And now I strive for the life
I once denied

Here I am once again
Back from the dead now here me calling
I've returned to seek my destiny
Here I am once again
What brought me back while I was falling
I need to know are you my destiny?

I was lost within a shade
Of total loneliness
Desolated in my own demise

An undefined creature
Made me believe
And now I strive for the life
I once denied

Here I am once again
Back from the dead now here me calling
I've returned to seek my destiny
Here I am once again
What brought me back while I was falling
I need to know are you my destiny?
