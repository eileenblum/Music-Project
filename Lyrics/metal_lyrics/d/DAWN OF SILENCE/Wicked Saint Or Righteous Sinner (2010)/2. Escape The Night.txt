We are forced to live in darkness
In this torned world we are slaves
Fallen angels spread their wings
Is this the end of days?

Enlight the guiding fire
The shades will lead you blind
Let it shine on me to eat my skin
Let the fire burn so deep within

Oh no
Too late to save the world
From its own demise
We have to go

Escape the night
Seal the fate
Unslave your mind
Be set free
Riding high to find
What they all call illusions

Escape the night
Seal the fate
Unslave your mind
Set you free
Riding high to find
What they all call illusions
Escape the night

Believe there's no tomorrow
There are no happy endings
Where is your God
To ease my pain?
Where is your God?
I know he failed again

Oh no
Too late to save the world
From its own demise
We have to go

Escape the night
Seal the fate
Unslave your mind
Be set free
Riding high to find
What they all call illusions

Escape the night
Seal the fate
Unslave your mind
Set you free
Riding high to find
What they all call illusions
Escape the night

Hear Death play his symphony
The reapers waiting
He's calling me
We need to feign
To seek redemption
Fallen angels spread your wings
We ride the fire
We're breaking free
To find our haven our sanctuary

Escape the night
Seal the fate
Unslave your mind
Be set free
Riding high to find
What they all call illusions

Escape the night
Seal the fate
Unslave your mind
Set you free
Riding high to find
What they all call illusions
Escape the night
