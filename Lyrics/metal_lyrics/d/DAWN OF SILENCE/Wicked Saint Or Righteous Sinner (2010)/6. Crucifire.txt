I have come
To take you away
Make you repay
For your sins
Once you sworn
To live by the rues
But now you have
Failed this game

Can you see what lies behind
The gates of hell
I've been there
And now I've coming back for you

Living my life in sin
I'm the crucifire
In the name of the cross
Crucifire

Feel the hatred of a
Blackened soul
A heart once lost in the fire
Nowhere to run
You're out of control
You're under my spell now
So welcome to hell

Can you see what lies behind
The gates of hell
I've been there
And now I've coming back for you

Living my life in sin
I'm the crucifire
In the name of the cross
Crucifire

Forgive me father for I have sin
My heaven have become your hell
And forever you will burn

Living my life in sin
I'm the crucifire
In the name of the cross
Crucifire
