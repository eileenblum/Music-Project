I was born
To this darkened world
Still I'm flying on broken wings
One I've tried to make a difference
But what's or right or wrong?
I've failed to see

Now I'm trying to remember
Who I'm once were
Who I'm supposed to be
I'm a slave of the darkness
Born to serve
Live to loose

In this God forsaken world
I close my eyes
Wonder if I'm going insane
Hearing voices in the night

Every time I try to rise I fall
Wasted time I lived to please you
Now I'm closing my eyes
For you forever
Every time I stand
Behind these walls
I am trapped behind this surface
Living my life in this masquerade
Dreaming of flying away

Is this really
What this life should bring
Is it all it has to give?
Now I'm wonder in delusion
To feel my life is all that I strive

Once I'm wanted to remember
But I'm not sure that I want to see
The truth of the dark parts
Of my mind that is haunting me

In the God forsaken world
I close my eyes
So many times
I thought of running away
Just to leave it all behind

Every time I try to rise I fall
Wasted time I lived to please you
Now I'm closing my eyes
For you forever
Every time I stand
Behind these walls
I am trapped behind this surface
Living my life in this masquerade
Dreaming of flying away

All my dreams
Where have they gone?
Tried to see the light
To reach out for the sun
Still my heart is beading
But what is left inside
Can't escape the wrath of time

I was born
Into this shattered world
Still I'm flying on broken wings
I'm a slave to the darkness
Born to serve
To live by the rules
In this God forsaken world
I close my eyes
So many times
I thought of running away
Just to leave it all behind

Every time I try to rise I fall
Wasted time I lived to please you
Now I'm closing my eyes
For you forever
Every time I stand
Behind these walls
I am trapped behind this surface
Living in this masquerade
Dreaming of flying away
