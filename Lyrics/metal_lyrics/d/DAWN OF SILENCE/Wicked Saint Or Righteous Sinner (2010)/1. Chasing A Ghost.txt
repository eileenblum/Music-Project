I hear children crying
Silent screams
Are calling my name
I see shadows down the wall
I'm trapped in this nightmare

In a cell
A living hell
Locked inside my head
It haunts me
Every waken hour

Dreams in color
Or a fading life
In black &amp; white
Cannot see there's no return

[Chorus:]
From my evil dreams
Lost inside my evil mind forever
There is no escape
In my evil dreams
Lost inside my evil mind
Forever chasing a ghost

Closed my eyes
A long time ago
Pitch black shades of my life
It's all that I see
And are all that remains
I'm living this nightmare

In my cell
My private hell
There's no way
Out from here
Trying to reach the light
But when I do I fall

Dreams in color
Or a fading life
In black &amp; white
I've reached the point
Of no return

[Chorus]
