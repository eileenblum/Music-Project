Have the world
Turned its face against me
Walking down the empty road
All alone as the dark embraces me
Can't you see
What I'm going through?

Fallen angels
Have you lost your fate in me now
All alone but I will find my way

I was a fool
Who tried to reach out for you
I've seen the fire
Now I'm homing for the path of light
I was a fool
I'll never reach out for you
In quest for life
I will take back what is mine

Life's a game that must be played
I rolled the dice and now I'm on my way
I'm on the run
From who I'm once used to be
If there's a chance to escape
The evil decree

Crying angels
Have you lost your fate in me now
I close my eyes fall on my knees and pray

I was a fool
Who tried to reach out for you
I've seen the fire
Now I'm homing for the path of light
I was a fool
I'll never reach out for you
In quest for life
I will take back what is mine

Now I know
I couldn't see it through the fire
As the flames still thrived
In the fiend of mine
When I walked the isle of hell
Now when I've come this far
I will never give in
Cause yet I'm not broken
And I am still alive
Now I can't look back
I will never return
In quest for life
I'm taking back what is mine

I was a fool
Who tried to reach out for you
I've seen the fire
Now I'm homing for the path of light
I was a fool
I'll never reach out for you
In quest for life
I will take back what is mine

I'll never return
