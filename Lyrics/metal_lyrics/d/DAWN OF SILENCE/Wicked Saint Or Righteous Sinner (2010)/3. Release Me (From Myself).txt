Do you believe
In heaven and hell?
This constant fight
Between good and bad
When darkness falls
And reflects the night
Into my eyes
Then I'm gone away
Far away from here

It's the demons deep inside me
Takes control of my mind

Save me
Release me from myself
Walking through fire
With tears in my eyes
Save me
Release me from myself
Save me, I'm falling into the night
Release the pain

Is this real
Or just a dream
Can't even tell
What's reality
When darkness falls
And reflects the night
Into my eyes
Try to run away
But there's nowhere I can hide

I can hear how it's calling
It's the demons inside me

Save me
Release me from myself
Walking through fire
With tears in my eyes
Save me
Release me from myself
Save me, I'm falling into the night
Release the pain
