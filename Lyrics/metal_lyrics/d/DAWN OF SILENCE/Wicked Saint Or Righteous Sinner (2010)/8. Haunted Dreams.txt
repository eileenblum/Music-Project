You've seen the face
Forever haunts your dreams
It's always there to
Penetrate your mind
When you close your eyes

It's in your head
Another self made dream?
You can't hide from this nightmare
That contaminates your mind

See the devil in his grace
In the fire of hell you stand ablaze
Another delusion?
Say your prayers
Confess your sins
Here it calling you again
Don't know if what you see is real

Scary faces in your dreams
Screaming shades of misery
Afraid to close your eyes forever
Starring eyes are watching you
Watching every single move
Sell your soul to comprehend
Your haunted dreams

Laying awake at night
Still tortured by the screams
You can't believe that the ghost
You see in the mirror is me

I'm the devil
You've seen my face
In the fire of hell you stand ablaze
Another delusion?
Say your prayers
Confess your sins
Here me calling you again
Believe in me
I am real

Scary faces in your dreams
Screaming shades of misery
Afraid to close your eyes forever
Starring eyes are watching you
Watching every single move
Sell your soul to comprehend
Your haunted dreams
