My heart is crushed
It's lying there and growing cold
Summer's sunset falls
Sunlight flees away and dews of night arise
Rainy autumn moves my heart
Flowers welking welk my joy
Clouds come rolling over
they depress me, overrun me
They overshadow my heart
Autumn comes apace, a last warm glance sighing to me
Now grey vails between the earth and sea
Birdless branches in the wind
Leaves they found their death in coldness
Naked trees in the frost of night
yearning for the sun again and again
Waters laying still in transparent fog
Lakes of blue covered with ice
to sleep their winter-sleep
