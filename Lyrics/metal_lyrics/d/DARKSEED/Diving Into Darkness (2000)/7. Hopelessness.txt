I'm looking through my window and I see
a lonesome star lost in the night
I'm looking through my window and I see
midnight's gloomy forest, it's mighty trees
The new-moon winter-bright
overspread with phantom light
Cold winds are knocking at my door
Should I open'
Welcome to my broken heart, I invite You
I'll show You hidden dreams, just explore
Dreams that yearn for sunny days
Dreams that search for hopeful ways
Realize my deepest dreams!
When the cold winds visit me
my wishes freeze, illusions flee
Hopelessness, it fills my soul
Hopeless ways I'm walking down
I'm sitting here, no window there
No lights I see I'm waiting for
Dreams that yearn for sunny days
Dreams that search for hopeful ways
