Would You like to go for a walk?
Essential for You...
May I introduce You to my words:
Small amusements give You joy
You don't think about it's sense stupid guy...
I deny You, I despise You
You're the one 'bout whom I laugh
Go to hell now, get a move on!
Follow my advice!
I deny You, I despise You
You're the one whom I regret
Go to hell now, get a move on!
I'll show You, go to hell!
Truth it has no value for You
You keep up appearances
Shut Your gob, now I am talking!
A fat lot You know about the truth
Now our ways will seperate forever
Forget my words and live the world
You live Now it's time to say good-bye to You
Walk Your path again and keep a fool!
