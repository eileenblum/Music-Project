I'm standing at the coast
and I listen to the waves
I'm searching for a place
to anchor my heart
But the water is too deep
to find You
I'm drifting away
washed to the shore
Sand in my eyes
I can't find You
I'm searching stone for stone
I'm diving blue for blue
I'm diving deep in You
but I can't find You
Waters wash my soul
I listen to the waves
telling stories far from home
They live and breathe and break
they're washing clear my soul
