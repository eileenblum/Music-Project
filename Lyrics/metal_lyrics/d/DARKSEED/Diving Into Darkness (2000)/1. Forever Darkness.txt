In the fire of the sunken sun
fast as ravens, bullets, thoughts I run
I inhale the golden oil
and I fear forever darkness
Nights come, bringing snow
Forever darkness in my soul
Black, cold days will never cease
when the ground shakes and the light falls
Look into Your heart
Do You see the ruins of what we felt before?
Look into Your heart
Forever darkness in my soul
Do You see the ruins of what we felt before?
Look into Your heart
Do You feel it?
Do You see the ruines
of what we felt before?
Sickening lives the fallen man
This is our world
Here the snake gets her poison
to kill innocense in paradise
Lies come, spirit's gone
devil's might has won
Black cold days will never cease
when the ground shakes and the light falls
