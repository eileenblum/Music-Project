This is the day
When grief pours freezing over me
Like rushing mighty floods
To drown the flame burning in my eyes
Freezing coals in my soul
I ask myself, how came these things to pass?
Sometimes unexpected seconds just arrive too fast
Counting moments always change my life
Counting moments when joy or tears arrive
Counting moments I never will forget
Sudden, unexpected things come to pass
I'll never enter dreams of Eden anymore
The low last edge of the universe
Now all hope's destroyed images burst
Perspectives gone and past
Dreams devide and break
Sudden movements piercing through my life
Unforeseen joy or tears arrive
