When the day comes You wish it dark
Life's black window of Your soul
When the day comes
You wish I'm dead
Black temptation in Your head
When Your lies come I wish You're gone
The pulse of Your veins under ice
When I look into Your heart I find a desert
where You let hot rain falling burn
I'm walking down this dying land
step by step, walk for walk
The autumn rain rains on my life
drop for drop, tear for tear
When the day comes You wish it dark
Life's black window of Your soul
Let the hot rain falling burn
Tell Your heart it has to learn
Let the hot rain falling burn
Keep Your thoughtful land alive
