A shining star it sinks
and spreads it's last silver rays
A short glance and then escape
to universal spheres
The last sinking star leaving us
and with it the last remaining truth
Mankind stained itself with sin
Wisdom changed to cold, we hunted everything
The last fleeing star says good-bye
We're left in loneliness
Stars we cannot buy
We're left alone
without warmth, without light
The stars, the moon they leave tonight
God is out of sight
We're left alone
without heart, without soul
We're left alone in fields of gold
The sun, the stars, the moon
returning home to God
Crying about the earth
We're lost in emptiness of space,
we're lost in emptiness of sense
Wounds we have to close
before the last wise thought perishes
