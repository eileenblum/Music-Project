I'm walking down this way
without an aim, without a course
I sometimes find an open door
to rooms that show me trivial thoughts
I see wastelands in Your heads
without ideas, without respect
I blame mankind
Your road leads downwards
into sinful life
Down and down the steps You fall
Tears they fall like springing rain
down onto the poisoned earth
Thoughts that love the routine life
push me out of Your door
A tree's my friend just loving me
despite it's wounds bleeding free
And the sun is blind,
happy rays are gone
The tree is dead...
I blame mankind
