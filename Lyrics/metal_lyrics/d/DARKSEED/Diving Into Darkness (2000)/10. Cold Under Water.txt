I dive into the sea
to realms of unknown blue
I break the surface
to drown in nothingness
Calm before the storm
Storms drowning everything
Floods drowning all
You're sinking down
Water, deep, blue, cold
The sea's calling You
Floods drowning all
Blue dimensions
Water, deep, blue, cold
destroying all
And the flood's destroying all
And the world is sinking down
Blue dimensions over us
Our world is dying
Black clouds appear
and the rain falls
Lands under water
they sink into forget
Cold under water
lies the wreck called mankind
