Follow then rain into the end of paradise
where the eternal dark's crying so near
cold wind plays with my minds
when the fog appears and lovely words
will change to screams

When I sleep I mount and fall
untrue flowers sprout and die

Feelings stained with blood
They don't endure this chill
engrained in deepest grief
silent, sad farewell

The daybreak drowns in my tears
a last spark mirrors on blackened seas
feeble waves whisper through the night
in the calm I saw angel die...

I cry â left alone
my grave â I can't evade
now I watch the stars
and silence crawls to me
my frozen tears will fuse and
leave my helpless eyes
implied I wait and stare
a view into my past

I cry â left alone
my grave â I can't evade
sniff a glacial breath of fear
weariness befalls your eyes
sadness thrives on lonely thoughts
they never fade away to dust
raven moves his wings
it flies into eternal sleep
thorns will bar the path to wake pain is bounding me, obfuscating me
I will find the dawn â redemption from my grief
fear is blazing up and penetrating me darksome thoughts now close my eyes
mischief is bright â shadows on my doom
can't prevent my death.
