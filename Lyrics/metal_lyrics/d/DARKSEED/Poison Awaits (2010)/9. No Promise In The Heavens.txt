And I am still waiting
For clean to come yet he's not there
He's killing dreams out in the sea

I feel like â I can't breathe
Life's â crushing down on me
Heavy salt will wash away my sin

No one left â I could blame it on
No more hope â all is said and done
Life seems sealed â as the night breaks in

And rears mount the horizon
And blackened is the night
The world has drowned in cries

I search for many years
He is all cherished all my life
I roamed behind the veil of night

The essence of life â it should never be lost
Thrown to be beast â to be mighty tossed

I I give myself away â on this blackened day
I give myself away to you!

The world is drowning...
The world has drowned in cries...
