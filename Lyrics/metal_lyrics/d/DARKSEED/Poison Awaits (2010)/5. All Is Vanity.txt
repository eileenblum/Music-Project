Work and lofty dreams vanish in dust
All that once was gold now turns to rust

Each new jewel surpassed by the next
All is in vain â all is vanity
False desires make your life complex
All is vain â all is vanity

On the verge of insanity
You're trapped in this web of vanity
Bury your novel expressions
Bury your hopeless passions

Embrace the status and display the crest
All is vanity
You live a life of emptiness
Purity is meaningless

Reveal yourself, keep sailing to the ends
Embrace purity
You only take it as a game
'cause vanity is your name

Life's an uphill climb
One seldom find a rope
Redemtion's not in sight
But do not kill your hope

Health of mind and body, all seems lost
All is in vain â all is vanity
Into a sea of fire and disgust
All is in vain â all is vanity

Bring forth the sumptuous delights
Tickle my senses, devour the moment
Abstinence has become a sacrilege
Admire the feast â never eat

Embrace the status and display the crest
All is vanity
You live a life of emptiness
Purity is meaningless

Reveal yourself, keep sailing to the ends
Embrace purity
You only take it as a game
'cause vanity is your name

[4x]
All is â all is vanity
All is â in vain
