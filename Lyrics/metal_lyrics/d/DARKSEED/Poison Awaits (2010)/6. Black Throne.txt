I whisper and moan
My life seems sealed
Time to face my misery
And my mind flees into
Wounds hat never healed

I coast aside my pretty fears
And I forsake the known
I am on a trip
In search of my black throne

Can I endure the rain?
Can I stand the pain?
Day after day my fate tore me up inside
The rope is cut
Eyes forever shut
I am falling!
Falling!

What I used to feel?
What I used to need?
I don't know who this is from who
I need to be feed

Ghosts keep haunting me
In my shattered soul
And they make it heir abode
Take my self control

Afraid to realize
It's not an unknown farce
I need to be the one to exorcise me

And as a blind man I would dance
Days and years passed by
But there's a whisper
From the soul that hides

Can I endure the rain?
Can I stand the pain?
Day after day my fate tore me up inside
The rope is cut
Eyes forever shut
I am falling!
Falling!

What I used to feel?
What I used to need?
I don't know who this is from who
I need to be feed

Ghosts keep haunting me
In my shattered soul
And they make it heir abode
Take my self control

Spark my screams â there's no deliverance
Darkness falls â there's no deliverance
Haunt my dreams â there's no deliverance
Hell doth rise â there's no deliverance

Can I endure the rain?
Can I stand the pain?
Day after day my fate tore me up inside
The rope is cut
Eyes forever shut
I am falling!
Falling!

What I used to feel?
What I used to need?
I don't know who this is from who
I need to be feed

Ghosts keep haunting me
In my shattered soul
And they make it heir abode
Take my self control

Take my self control
And as a blind man I would dance
Take my self control
My fate tore me up inside
