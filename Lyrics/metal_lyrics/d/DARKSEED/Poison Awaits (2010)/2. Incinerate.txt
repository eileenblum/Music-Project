Follow the fire
Follow the sword
Leave only death
And praise the false lord
Hunting the spirits
Chasing the fools
Raging for purity
Anyone to seduce

Chop all the mortals
Steel finds flesh
Shatter their bones
Eye to eye
Rape all their highness
No reaction
Flatten their homes
A lifetime gone by

Tell me will my hate someday perish?
Will the wrath still hunger for this one bliss?

Incinerate â Incinerate â Incinerate
Right now insanity is rising
Misleading lines â forgotten
lives â colourless nights
Infinity is calling me
Incinerate â Incinerate â Incinerate
My agony will never end
Misleading lines â forgotten
Lives â colourless nights
Only darkness I can see

Flourish the cancer
Deep in their lungs
Unveil the toxic
Genetic expanse
I am the radiance
No one can see
Turn water sour
For always to be
Infiltrate mortals
No reaction
Mutate their bones
Eye to eye
Swim in the bloodstream
Light in the tunnel
Breaking the nodes
A lifetime to day

Tell me will my hate someday perish?
Will the wrath still hunger for this one bliss?

Incinerate â Incinerate â Incinerate
Right now insanity is rising
Misleading lines â forgotten
lives â colourless nights
Infinity is calling me
Incinerate â Incinerate â Incinerate
My agony will never end
Misleading lines â forgotten
Lives â colourless nights
Only darkness I can see

One day my hate will perish
I'll defeat the seeds of sorrow
No more hungering for this one bliss
Taking off into a bright tomorrow

Incinerate â Incinerate â Incinerate
Right now insanity is rising
Misleading lines â forgotten
lives â colourless nights
Infinity is calling me
Incinerate â Incinerate â Incinerate
My agony will never end
Misleading lines â forgotten
Lives â colourless nights
Only darkness I can see
