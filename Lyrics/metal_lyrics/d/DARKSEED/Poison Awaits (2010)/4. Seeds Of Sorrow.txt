I listen to the whispering waves
The whispering waves of unconditional love
With my feet on earth, my head above

The night's echo of myself
A shadow that will flow forevermore
And I have never fell this way before

Once again the thought of you
Permates my skin
You're living in my bones now
I cannot calm the voices from within

Once again my heartache rose
From its silent slumber
Autumn leaves they sweep my soul
Too many tears to number

And black rains fall
Emotions rise tonight
No chance to keep them under
Wherever I shall wander â I'm lost

The night it sleeps
Deep in my skin â tonight
No chance to find a reason
The origin of treason

Once again the seeds of sorrow
Can't be cast aside
There is no bright tomorrow
Autumn rides upon the blackened tide

Once again I drink to fall
A portion I must bear
I feel it live and breathe inside
Dead leaves turn to ash, but I don't care
They turn to ash, but I don't care

And black rains fall
Emotions rise tonight
No chance to keep them under
Wherever I shall wander â I'm lost

The night it sleeps
Deep in my skin â tonight
No chance to find a reason
The origin of treason

Eternal darkness â fall from grace
Deep inside I'm hurting with desire
Hopes and dreams will soon be lost in space

And black rains fall
Emotions rise tonight
No chance to keep them under
Wherever I shall wander â I'm lost

The night it sleeps
Deep in my skin â tonight
No chance to find a reason
The origin of treason
