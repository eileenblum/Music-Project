Hearts of darkness start to burn
And each man will rise in glory
Sacred grounds will give them birth

Strip myself of centuries
Fleeing into timeless skies
Weights and standarts are extinct

As disciple I'll return
The sands of time will tell my story
Spread my wings renew this earth

And our fears rolled on
And the days lay dead
And interia's gone â tonight

See the light!
I'm longing to start over â a am free
Feel the light
Obliterating mankind's history

I walk â along those broken walls
In faith â inhale the newborn day
I fly â though nemesis has come
In faith â across those timeless skies

Walk in faith along those broken walls
Walk in faith â inhale the newborn day
The newborn day

Hearts of darkness start to burn
And each man will rise in glory
Sacred ground will give them birth
Hearts of darkness start to burn
