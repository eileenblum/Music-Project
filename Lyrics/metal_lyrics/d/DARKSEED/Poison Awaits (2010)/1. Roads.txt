Disagreements â they have killed the fire
Understanding â forever's flown far away
Life's repressing â all of my desires
Hopelessness â eternally held at bay
Fading to grey

I have seen the path I need to follow
Time to energize
Today lasts only till tomorrow
And a king will rise

Bitterness â so cruel it is out of my league
Loneliness â I fall a thousand fathoms deep
Anger is â dwelling in my restless mind
Here I stand â both deaf and blind
But never I'll surrender!

Chase this rolling stone and see
Has it gathered greener moss?
One bridge lies ahead of me
Will it burn before I walk across?

I feel Like â I'm walking towards the twilight now
Soothe me â in my constant tiredness
Engines push me â rapidly straight
Through the clouds
And erase â my emptiness
Drown my pain for good now
