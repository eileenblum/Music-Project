Searing until we are swallowed by fire
Trying to reach out for the beaming,
Seductive light once we get
Burned â and here comes the night

We all dreamed of touching the sun
Of being more than we could ever be
Our wings now lie floating on a dead sea

We're following what's hopeless
We're striving for the fire
We're wondering with memories
Caught in the night's desire

We're following the blind men,
Our wings have come undone
And atom follows atom
Unwinding in the sun

No boundariesn when it comes to real passion
No dimensions and no dreams we cannot climb
Creating a universe outside of time

Just keep flying keeping your dead down
Ready for motion, your throat
Stripped bare of moons
Maybe tomorrow your name
Will be carved in stones.

I cannot saw the seam
It faded with my dream
Live a life extreme!

Oblivious to â the downward spiral
And time keeps wandering onward,
It keeps it us at pace
When are we gonna wake up
And find our resting place?
