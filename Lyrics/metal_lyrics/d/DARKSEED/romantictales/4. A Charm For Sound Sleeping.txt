My loveless eyes, they gaze on thee
They break the crystal of the sea
That smile for which my feelings sigh
This pain could teach us how to die

Your heart once left thus desolate
Must fly at least from ease to hate
So many summer-flowers there
So many shadows love might (share)

Love's (image) upon earth without its wings
I feel relief when sorrows flows
My days though few have passed below
(Dark tree,) still sadâ¦ (when other's grief is fled)
Grasped in holy hand (of mystery)
So beautiful shy, dark eyesâ¦ (flashing free)
Last eve in beauty's circle (proudly gay)
Let thy scattered shafts of light (play)

Sleep at noon with branches overgrown
You can't enliven dying man for god takes back his gift
Beat the twilight into flakes of fire
Glow with the glow that slowly crimsoned all

Through all memory I found a way
I walked in thoughts, today they walk in me
