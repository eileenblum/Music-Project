Twilight flowers wait for their rise
Building thorns of defence
In the sunset with it's sovran shine

Thorns, I hear them grow
Their might to show
Proud in their form
They desire light

Spiral of mystery
No heart, no eyes of man can see

Welcome to the fields so wide
Too nice to be mine...

Thoughts too high for one like me
Here I meet with thinks new born

For never were these things
So like a dream
My heart is overcharged
Here it will be left
I wish to drown in deamscapes like this

Storm in me me, burn!
Life in me, strive!
