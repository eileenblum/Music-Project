My cosmic shining
Condied with ice

My cosmic shining
Candle my light!

The eye of the sun is nomore blind
The dawn of a new day reborn?

My cosmic shining
My fallen star
I am falling
Lying afar

I walked uproad in showers
Down the rivers of the windfall light
In the garden where the shapes of night
Celebrate my fever

I feel my fever, I see me dying
Heal my fever, my cosmic shining

I see my dying, my cosmic shining
Don't you see me dying
My cosmic shining?
