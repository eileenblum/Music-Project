The birds love in the shade
Sweet smiles the night
All creations slept and smiled
...never will it be!

Give me light, give me pride, beam on me

Away the vapour flew
Shining beams of love
Sweet dreams, pleasent beams
But I'm bereaved of light

Give me light, give me pride, beam on me

Angels in the sky, the give me light
They beam forth brightness on a darkened world
A holy angel, he guards my bed
Reach me your mighty hand!
I can't choose but grief destroy

The birds in the shade
Sweet smiles the night
All creations slept and smiled
...never will it be!

I gave my heart away
Weeping tears on infant's tear
Sweet dreams form a shade
Happy silent moony beams!
