You love the world I own
Where all our hate is blown
Away to distant spheres
I call our real life

Flying together
Flying togehter
Flying together
Into my dreamy world

We'll walk among the clips of fire
The heat to feel
We'll wander all night long
In lands of dreams

Flying together
Flying togehter
Flying together
Into my dreamy world

Please fly together
Please fly with me
We'll fly together
Into my dream

We'll see magic summer rain
Your skin to cool
I'll show you hidden spheres
I, the mental traveller
