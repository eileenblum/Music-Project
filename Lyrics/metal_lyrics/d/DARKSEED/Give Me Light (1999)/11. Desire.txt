See, I fall for you
Feel the hurts
You do
My world seems
To fall apart
I stand alone

You burn in me
You beat in me
Desire
You are my
Pulsing heart
You beat

Tears in darkened
Stillness
Thunder

Rain in me
I, I long for you
I stay alone

I still feel for you
Feel the hurts
You do
You
You punish me
Free me

You
You burn in me
You, my fire
You
My pulsing heart
Beat, desire!
