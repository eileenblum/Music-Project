I dare my life lay down to sleep
To be ashes for each wind that blows
Life shall not rule me anymore
I am damned, so forlorn

I will dance with the lion
I will dance

I wished in silence that it were not me
I the one to whom now danger lights
It's time to go now
I'm walking fast
To face the challenge,
My last task

I will dance with the lion
I will dance
