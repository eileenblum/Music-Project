This day forms more and more my wish to enter unknown paths
I desire light on my way to the spirit world
I wish to enter spirit worlds, a dreamland full of coloured words

Dreams, now they rage, how they roar!
Thoughts, pulsate and break the gate
Light me the way to sharpened dreams then I will smile all days 'till end
