Never did I feel a truer grief
Full of regret an failing

I hear
Echoes of tomorrow
My heart to borrow
I wish to lose
My past

I won't live and
Love my misery
So I can't choose
But break the day

I hear
Echoes of tomorrow
They take my sorrow
To burst away
My past

Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Echoes of tomorrow

I hear
Echoes of tomorrow
They take my sorrow
To burst away
My past
