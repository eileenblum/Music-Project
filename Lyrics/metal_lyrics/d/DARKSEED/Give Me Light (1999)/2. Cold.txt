Your hand ran over me
I got your sympathy
But now you broke my neck
I feel it in my head
I see it in your eyes
I feel it in my head

See, you're feeling cold
It's cold inside of you
I'm almost sure
You don't know what you do

But now I turn from you
Don't want to be your fool
Nomore for you to beg

See, you're feeling cold,
It's cold inside of you
My frozen heart nomore for your to feel

Cold... cold... cold

Receive but what you give
In your my devil lives

I wish you all the worst

You feel it in my head
I see it in your eyes
You feel it in your head
