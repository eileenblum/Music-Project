And I seek sweet favours carved in gold
And I bare the light my breath to hold
Early seen unknown, but know too late
How came this gentle concord?
Can you tell me was it fate?

I cross the entrance, push the door
to crawing sadness hurting more
I see I hear the trembling sphere
Come and pass, alas, stay here!

And I breathed such vows love used to swear
It's too rich for earth too dear
Now sadness is beloved and love we gain
I see me I see you and all I know is
hurt is lying plain

I pity silence sad
I enjoyed the vital light
Oh, that she knew, knew I did
God alone in grievance lies
I thank you for your cries
I leave you now.I leave you now

When I feel my insane blue
I dive into the sea of you
and hope to drown by falling down
Weapons out to pierce my grief
I hide my blade alike in peace
Drop the curtain, I will leave

I don't care, I don't go
I don't leave you when you will
I don't care, I don't go
When you cease my love to kill

Burning ice and wondrous flaming snow
And I see more devils hell can hold
I will leave the break of day
No more passion, no more lust
and only fume of sigh will stay
