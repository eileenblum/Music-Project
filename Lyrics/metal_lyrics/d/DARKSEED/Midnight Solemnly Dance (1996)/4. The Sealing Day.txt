I look upon myself and curse my fate
Shall I compare you to a winter's day?
Pull down your vanity, I say pull down
A world of made is not a world of born

I all alone beweep my outcast state
and my eternal spring is shall not fade
Some safer world in depths of wood embrace
The stars move still with sound of glace

And all the air a solemn stilness holds
My ear is much enarmoured of your silent notes

What angel wakes me from my flowered bed?
Oh, you have killed my sleeping fairy-land
I pray you gentle mortal, sing again
I'm wandering till truth makes all things plain

By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
to stay but here awhile most radiantly

How glorious once above thy sphere
and all the air
Heaven's matchless king does glance
methought he is there
