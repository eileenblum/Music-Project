Falling, falling into the hole
Starfall, starfall-to the horizon

This hateful imperfection on her eyes
They swell like orient pearls
Why should they stay?
Pressed by love to go

You don't speak as you think
it cannot be!
Your vows to her and me
How shall we find the concord
of your night and day

And I go, oh spite, oh hell,
to vows that would consis
of the wind
So sorrow's heaviness
does heavier grow
Give me your hands of we be friends

Oh peace will not harbour me
since night's swift dragons
cut the skies

Night and silence, are you there?
Weeds of chillness he does wear
So awake when I'm gone
To heaven's breaking fields I come
