I ask, does someone hear me?
Listen... Yes, I mean you
Yes, I'm a fragile warrior
And I wander towards the unknown

Unknown, insecure, pathless mornings
Lost, my compass
Lost, I'm hopeless
Lost, I'm drowning
Save me!

I've seen a place where hearts cannot be
Bought or just borrowed
I've seen the sun hidden in your soul
Shining on me

Restless, but so tired, aimless, fortune
Laughs about me
Laughs and fools me
Laughs and spoils me
Wreckage

I shout, where can I find you
Tell me where have you been
Anchor, you'll be my rescue
Tearing me out of this living downstream

I've seen a place where hearts cannot be
Bought or just borrowed
I've seen the sun hidden in your soul
Shining on me
When the night casts it's shadow and eats
My gladness
Shining on me like a guardian
Covers me, warming me in this coldness
My whole life
