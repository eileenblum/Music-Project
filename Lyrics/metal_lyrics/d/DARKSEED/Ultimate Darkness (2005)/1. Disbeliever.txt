We are living in an unrefined world
Where wonders fall as soon as they rise
The shadows haunt the deaf and blind
You are one of them,
'Cause you are a disbeliever

Living in a world ruled by demons for
Breaking the pure wings of our angels who flee and conceal
They're damned to silence

Lore ends now

Now they resign and toss ideas away
While cold pelting rains descend - washing brains

Deadlocked, hidebound, desperate
You all disbelieve
No trust in the unseen
You don't dream

Echoes heard far-off
They witness past achievements
But they left no light
To guide us through this nightmare
Burning scars, we are baptised heretics
Rumors fly like swirling leaves and spread

Losing our belief in unseizable
Values once esteemed and adored
Now they flee and conceal
They're damned to silence
Lore ends now

But I believe
Leave and resign and toss ideas away
While cold pleting rains descend - washing brains
