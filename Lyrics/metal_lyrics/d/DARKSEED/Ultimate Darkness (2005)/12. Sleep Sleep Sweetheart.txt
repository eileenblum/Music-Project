The night-wind swallows you
Eats you up in lust and smiles, silently
Sleep, sleep, sweetheart
Dream and forget our misery

A mortal fever haunts the dying earth
Our hearts and souls stand still and wince
I can't save your day,
Rescue won't take your hand,
So sleep the day away
Sleep, my dear
And our god hides in calm

I whisper while your eyes are shut
And don't see this hell on earth

Sleep, sleep sweetheart, never wake up
You are not made for this world's grinning pain
Shining eyes, they are no more, sleep well
Veins getting cold and the shadows lurk, shadows lurk

I long for new born lights divine and pure
A clearing rain to wash our dirt away
A mortal fever haunts the dying earth
Our hearts and souls stand still and wince

Content dance the snakes
For their work now's completed
Their poison creeps

I whisper while your cheeks turn cold and silence grabs your breath
