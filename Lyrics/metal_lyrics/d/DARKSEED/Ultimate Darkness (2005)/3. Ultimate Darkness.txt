Pride and credit
In a meaningless world
Don't be greedy
For the wishes of the mob
Spinning round for dirt

Losing grip, but you're not the only one
Here I am...
I'm alone and you are too
Silent night, wonderfully deaf and blind

Noise dies away, this stinking rebel of men
For this is darkness and stillness and peace

Darkness tonight
All your broken visions true
You are a stranger to this world, me too
Darkness today
Because this is our way
And the night it heals your tears and letdowns now

I've seen days so black
And will see more
Your pain and disdain
I know it so well...

Walk and smile cause you are not a dancer
Like those who dance to sounds of coins and gold
Not your world - primitive and rude

Noise dies away, this stinking rebel of men
For this is darkness and stillness and peace

Burning spirits rising high and I see
Yes I see, yes I see a flower in you
When I stare at you I see the dullness gone by
I am not alone
