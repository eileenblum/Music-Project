It's the fall
You are damned to live your life in wastelands
It's the fall
In a world where weak ones are left alone

Dreams, all your dreams
All your dreams are buried in mounts of sand
Breathe, breathe the dust
Breathe the lifeless dust of nature's revenge
Now you see all damage we have done
You lost all you had and will lose even more, even moreâ¦

Fall, fall, it's your fall, forever
Last days of Gaia
Fall, fall, never end, it's your fall
The future lies in your hands
Fall, fall, it's your fall, forever
Your adventure's just begun, little hero
Win the game or... forever fall

Feel, do you feel
Do you feel the corruption haunting you
Live, will you live
Will you live the perversion like others do
Now you see all damage we have done
You lost all you had and will lose even more, even moreâ¦

Fall, fall, it's your fall, forever
Last days of Gaia
Fall, fall, never end, it's your fall
The future lies in your hands
Fall, fall, it's your fall, forever
Your adventure's just begun, little hero
Win the game or... forever fall

I, Iâll believe, I'll believe in you
You will find your way
Even if you walk alone
You will fight, you will fight, you will fight, you will fight - or will you...

Fall, fall, it's your fall, forever
Last days of Gaia
Fall, fall, never end, it's your fall
The future lies in your hands
Fall, fall, it's your fall, forever
Your adventure's just begun, little hero
Fall, fall, never end, it's your fall
Win the game or... forever fall
