Darkness - In every line and word i'm singing
Demons - Haunting me whenever I think

Nightfall - A dying man
Nightfall - Yes i am
Beasts inside me roar
The dark one is my name

Allright, here's the dark one speaking
I introduce my mental world to you

Breaking living nothingness
That's what I will do - be careful!

My words are in your hands
And they measure good and bad
Maybe they attract you
But you should read between the lines

I rule the night, it's my home, I welcome you
Die Nacht ist mein, und ich lad dich herzlich ein
I hunt the light, for more than one decade
'Cause i am the dark one, the dark one I am

Selfhood - I hate you
Dullness - and you too
I decry you all
For dark one is my name

Hey you, do you hear my words
I hope you do, and feel it too

Blaming mortal selfishness
That's what I will do - I mean it!

This is my other side
I'm not only a dark one,
As I have a pulsing heart
For all who care
