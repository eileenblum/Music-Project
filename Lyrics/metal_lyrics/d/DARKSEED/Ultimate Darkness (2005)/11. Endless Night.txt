Living a life without light
I found my endless night

Evil, when will you lose your wings?
I bathe in glowing coals
I live my saddest hour
Hiding my joy, no escape, iron cages

Anger for I know all is lost
It's my night, endless night
But I'm not falling
'Cause I stand proud until the end
When lights descend,
And smiling is no more
In my own endless night

Peace ends at the moment
Where self-longing begins
Pain is running straight down my shoulders
Break-up, fires ignite
We burn, will be gone
We are imprisoned in halls of shame

This lonesome place keeps me inviolate
Beautiful rain pouring from broken skies
Treetops bending down with a sigh

This is an endless night
Hope for relief is gone
You wear a gloomy shroud
Hiding the sinning world
