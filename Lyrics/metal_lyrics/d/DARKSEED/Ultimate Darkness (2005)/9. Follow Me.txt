All black nights, all promising days
Silence speaks loud and clear to me
I long for reason
Your healing for living

All things I've done, have failed so badly
Ideas and plans look at me and laugh
All I need is clarity
A voice that whispers "follow me"

Guide me to your shore
Leave my ruins behind
Show me the way to light
I will follow you
Whereever you go, whereever you are
I will follow, give me a sign

My way, is no way anymore
It lulls me, breaks and just throws me away
Anger builds a mental wall
But will it ever break, ever break

Finally lurking void revealed it's aims
Finally my life is nowhere
All I need is clarity
A voice that whispers "follow me"

I should run away, but to where, I don't know.
I gaze at a netherworld cause my mind went blind
Anger builds a mental wall
But will it ever break, ever break
