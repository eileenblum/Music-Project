You turned to senseless stone
I can't breathe in your ears anymore
I never knew the tide of life

It's time for leaving
I'm not believing in you anymore
Your needles in my heart
My nonexistent trust I must endure
I yearn for sympathy
Und doch beruhr ich kalte nur

It's a biting cold
Living flame shining dead
It's my next defeat
It's a biting cold again
It's a biting cold
Striking mights and maybes even more
A useless thing called life
It's a biting cold again

My hollow hand holds the past
Where your hand once was placed
Just the shell of a life
I once have lived with you

Now I know the taste of tears
They cut my soul in two
Like a knife, sharpened knife
Like a bloody sharpened knife
Cut me...

Losing my bright illusions
I will resign, become a rusty wreck
My nonexistent trust I must endure
I yearn for sympathy
Und doch beruhr ich kalte nur

You divided us forever
I will never ever heal
