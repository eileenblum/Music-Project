so many questions
but no answers about me
where is my home
in my head it drones

where will I go
senseless wandering
no open door
nowhere to return
where will I go
where do I belong
where's the end of my way
where will I stay, where will I go?

My life is hopeless
Nowhere to turn
Where do I fit in
Where do I belong
I don't follow footprints
I wanna make my own
Wherever I go
There was someone else

The answer to this quest of life:
Will I find my way
To refresh my soul
Exchange for promises and hope
I'm wandering in tears,
New perspectives I will find
