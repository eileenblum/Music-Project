winds on winter fields
in the smokey sky
wandering storm
storming war
demons' lust in starving lands
the years are filled with lies and tears 
no twinkling stars in distant skies
our fear is masked with careless smiles 
where are the gods, where is their might
nightmares guard our life
they are lost in the midnight air
forever lost 
love can't fill their empty lungs with breath 

will there be salvation, a ray of grace
as soon as grief began it shall end 

it shall end
while i stand
it shall end as soon as it began
it shall end
silent fading
it shall end
give us back understanding
