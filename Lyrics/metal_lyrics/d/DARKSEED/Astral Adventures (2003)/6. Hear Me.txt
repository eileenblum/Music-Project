a bloody rusted nail
piercing through my veins
no light to change eternal night to day
here human life has no worth

i never found what i was looking for
do you hear me when i cry
i never know what to search
will you find it when i'm gone? 

do you hear me when i cry
no you don't
chaos, madness, many sighs
in a world without hope

my mind's not filled with things to come
time runs away under my feet
a part of me has gone and died
life's going on and will do when i'm gone
