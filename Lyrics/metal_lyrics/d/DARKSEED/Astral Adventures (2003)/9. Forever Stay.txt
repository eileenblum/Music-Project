the hours are slipping by
i stare into the night
into my deep blue sea
of unforgotten memory
i paint your face
into my mind
and kiss your tears away
for me there's only you

i want you here, forever stay
my heart torn in two
i'll hold you close to ease your pain
'cause i feel it too

we are two souls in moonlit autumn nights
rebelling hearts on wings of gentle smiles
peaceful earth and star-filled skies
no demon, devil, ghost will make us cry

i want you here, forever stay
my heart torn in two
i'll hold you close to ease your pain
'cause i feel it too
forever stay and save the day
forever stay
