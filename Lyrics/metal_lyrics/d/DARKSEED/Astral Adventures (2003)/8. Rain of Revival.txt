a gentle rain came down on all
falling down upon the world
washing away our sins
tears that cleanse the soul
and soothe the pain
rain of revival

rain of revival
running down my skin
no past's survival
remaining in my heart
rain of revival
remembrance washed away
my past's denial
i'm challenging the day
i'm sailing on the sea of change
conquering new lands
coasts of new adventures
unknown tasks, unknown fears
better than remaining here
i'll leave the world behind 
rain of revival

will you join my walk
to new dimensions
i'll take your hand
to change your life
