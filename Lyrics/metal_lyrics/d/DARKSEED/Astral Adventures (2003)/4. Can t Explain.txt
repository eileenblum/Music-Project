shadow-veiled, passing years
i can't see the sun
where's the land of friends?
darkness conquers us
when the dawn of night begins
deep beneath my chilling fears
lives the ocean of my tears
i don't understand the world
bodies frozen, love stands still
as the sun was doomed
and i turn to look to you
there are no words i can use
i can't explain the goings of the world
dark and cold
i can't explain misery
i can't explain cruelty
i can't explain success of lying
i turn away
anger pounds, sorrow surrounds
i can't stand this pain
neverending emptiness
everyday we look away
we are all alone

i am sorry
i can't explain
cruelty
misery
