Inside of you
Tears of pure frustration
Cascading down your heart
What could fill your restless soul
You may never know
You may never know

Come inside my painless world
Inside eternity
Open up your mind
And take a ride
Fly into the night

Broken, wounded world
Broken, wounded minds
No place for you to live
Liar's fires burn
Melting ice of trust
Endless filthy days
Laugh of evil lust

Fly:
Come inside my painless world
Inside eternity
Fly:.
Open up your mind and take a ride
Fly into the night

I will find the light and bring it back to you
Hope is by your side
liar's fires gone
