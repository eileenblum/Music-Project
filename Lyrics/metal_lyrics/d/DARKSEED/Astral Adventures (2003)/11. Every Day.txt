i'm looking now where i have been
i try to see where i will go
this are two ways shrouded in fog
what is my existence's sense? 
every day i'm wondering, will there be a change?
every hour, a loss of power - every day
every day i'm wondering, will something new begin
time is flying, minutes dying - every day

unsure of my heart, unsure of myself
wondering silently of what could be
i ask you now: is this life?
meaningless, a senseless, useless way

shattered nerves, but here i stay, every day
i will move on, the journey never ends
