I am one of these dumb wise men
So I've much ado to know myself

I don't know how to get clear
with all the depths I owe
Thru the hour-glass they flow
I don't know the free and offered light
The lighting of my being is as bright

If I break the day, what would I gain?
To hold a candle lighting shame?
I desire no delight, no more delight
All knowledge is now burning in my eyes

You promise me blush life
I stand for sacrifice
I wish You all the joy that You can wish
Spirits dull at night
I think You are denied
The light we see is burning in my eyes

I don't show teeth in way of smile
I only see the hour-glass how it runs
By yonder-moon I swear You do me wrong
With my own hands I strike You honour down
