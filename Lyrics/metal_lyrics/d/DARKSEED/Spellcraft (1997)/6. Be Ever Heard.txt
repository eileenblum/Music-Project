Long time ago my work began
Completed now, when I'm a man
I drunk the wine of paradise
Much force I gained with many sighs

"Now You cease away, You come to me
You leave Your world with grim and cry out loud"

I really know the uses of the world
The voice I always hear, be ever heard!

I won't stop here, but gently pass
I will sink ere night be passed
I happy child of earth was I
bright as a star in our skies!

Cold astral stars, eternity
Now there may come new days to me
Now motionless like bleeding ice
I sing like wind short lives and dies
Short lives and dies!
