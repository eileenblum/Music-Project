[DIGI Bonus]

Leaves all night and day
Clouds with colors grey
But I still delight
Mirror's magic sight

When the moon is overhead
I cross nights forever sad
Snow and fire-love I see
Love I see

I use my brain, now I see
The wild stream brought me far away
Witchcraft's aim is what I need

Rivers drowning lands
Paleness, swan-like ends
Wandrers searching light
From morn to night

And I grew both deaf and blind
Damned to leave - unskilled to find
Dark shores no ships has ever seen
Ever seen

The leaves upon my fallen life
Before I reached the calling side
Reading magic books I died

Hold me - hold me
to reach heaven, not hell
Free me - free me
from cold eyes' farewell
Hold me - hold me
is my wisdom here?
Free me - free me
from my deep, dark fear
