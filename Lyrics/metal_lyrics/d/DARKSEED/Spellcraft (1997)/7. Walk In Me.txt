My loveless eyes, they look on You
They break the crystal seas so blue
A smile for which my feelings sigh
This pain could teach me how to cry

Your heart once passed so desolate
Must fly at least from ease to hate
So many summer flowers there
So many shadows love could share

Love's image upon earth without it's wings
I feel releaved when sorrow flows...
My days so few have passed away
Dark tree, still sad...

Grasped in the holy land
So beautyful shy-dark eyes
Last eve in beauty's circle
left Your scattered shafts of light

Sleep at noon with branches overgrown
I can't enliven dying men
'cause God takes back his gift
Beat the twilight into flakes of fire
Glow with the glow that slowly crimsoned all

"through all my memory I found a way
I walked in thoughts, today they walk in me"
