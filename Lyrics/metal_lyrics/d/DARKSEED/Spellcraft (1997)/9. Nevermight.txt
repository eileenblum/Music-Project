Truth may one day smile
Now I think scorn to sigh
You fear by pale-white shown
Heavy spellcraft grown...

All pride is welkin's pride
and so is Your?
I have the power to cut
My will still wills!
My eyes shall be the stream
Visional floating scream
I breathed a secret vow
Leasure serves me now

I never was on sorrow's side
Never felt a heaven-fight
Never was my dagger out of grace
Never love before my face

You can't overstare the mightiest
eyes that ever looked
I hope You come within my gates
You have to think about my might
'cause You are none by this good light

Falconbridge - nevermight
Your lusty mind so coldly iced
Hell befall Your mask!
Fallen face so fast
