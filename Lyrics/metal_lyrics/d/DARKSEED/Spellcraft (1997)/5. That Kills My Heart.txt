A comoran devouring time
In great streams rains the joy of mine
My blood speaks to You in vein
Fare well until we meet again!

You knocked onto my fate
alighted at my gate
My wife that was, my son that is
Keep faith onto Your chance

I'm glad at heart, make war breed peace
piercing thru myself to meet
Lend me Your hand that kills my heart

Let me to find You still, devil cross Your will
You stand pleased with all
I say:"Hear Your fall!"

Pardon me, stars, I never felt it until now
O sighful thought, drown her broked soul!

Your life passed thru so hard
I pay it when You part
Won't have a serpent-bite
Not fighting forth tonight...

God, I will set You forth
Great glory in my horse
I creep in dream-maids ears
My weakened voice to hear
