I wished Your heart was grown
to shoot an arrow to me down
You made waste of all I have
The worst everfall I serve

I only think that You forgot me
I hope You see what You did to me
Such a harm a wind will do at sea
I leave you now with better company

Go, tenderness of years
no sighing sign she hears
Fall whatever falls
sweet flowery welkin' call
Fall whatever falls
sweet flowery welkin' call
See I keep the day,
cure overnights so grey

There are many keys, but wherefore should I go?
No sign of hearts, but You breathing now
I'll leave to hang myself, pity on my loss
Meadows never crossed,
winter now at hand!

"I am honey-mouthed, but I don't talk
You smell my feelings as You walk"

You have the choice
to make me blessed or cursed
Soft Your bright voice
Scorn running time and make it worse
