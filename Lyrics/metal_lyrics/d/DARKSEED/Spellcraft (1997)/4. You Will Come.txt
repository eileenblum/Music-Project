I seek for You, take my leave, so fare You well
I lost all hopes, truth may come to light and die
And for my love I pray You, wrong me not
Let us all ring fancy's bell, ding, dong, bell!

Such as I am now for myself alone
My eyes still look, look as swift as Yours
I pray You cure my mind that's drenched with blood
A dancing heart, but not for joy

No power in the tongue of man
My deeds upon my head crushing
head crushing mad,"God sort it all"
You shall deem Yourself loaged in my heart
Sick is my head, let it bleed, desire to die!

I will lend You sorrow, borrow none
I never serve Your mind, I say "no way"!

"Remember You were mine,
'cause You obeyed my wine
My favour stopped to bleed,
over now my greed!"

And You will come, I never serve Your mind
And You will come and leave Your world behind

"I fly away by night, to higher steps of might
The thorns You stand upon, they never will pass on!"
