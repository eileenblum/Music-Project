Can I hold You all night long?
I feel You shake, a deed so wrong,
wrong in my head
Vino two for one today
Kiss this bleeding curse away
Realscapes today

Iron in the air, Your tongue in my mouth
Twilight-essence hair when the moon goes south
A breeze of sugar-breath
so sweetly pale, pale as death
Blood-copulate her will
Her aim my heart to kill

Self pity sick, flowers salty sweet
Self pity sick, love desire's benefit
Self pity sick, flowers salty sweet
Self pity sick, feelings blind

I starve the daily world aside
Wild things leading me tonight
But I feel dreamscape die
the bygone night denied
My soulgates open, streaming tears
The money-voice she only hear
His aim the pleasure of himself
Love and extasy she gave

Flowers salty sweet, love desire's benefit
Feelings blind, leave this weird place behind

I will load You for one kiss untrue
I don't open my lips for one loving kiss
