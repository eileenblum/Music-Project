GAZE ONTO THE MOON'S REFLECTED TWILIGHT
UPON THE LAKE OF INFINITE DREAMS
MESMERIZED BY MYSTIC MYSTERIES
CALL UPON FORCES THAT ONCE
GRANTED SUSPERIAN PLEASURES...
NOW THAT ALL HAS LOST ETERNITY
THE SEAL IS BROKEN
BY WHATEVER MEANS OF BEYOND
REMOVE THIS HAUNTED ENTITY
FROM MORTALITY AND FATE
LEAVE ONLY MEMORIALS OF DARKER DAYS
LIGHT SHALL NOT SHUN THE DAWN
ONLY A FOREVER NIGHT
UPON A FULL MOON TWILIGHT

[LYRICS: AELDEOST]
