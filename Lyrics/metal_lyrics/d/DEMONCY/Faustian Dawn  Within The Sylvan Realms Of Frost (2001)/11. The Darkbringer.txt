...AND AN ANGEL OF UNHERALDED BEAUTY
WAS CAST FORTH FROM THE HEAVENS
FORESHADOWING ALL IN IT'S PROPHETIC DESCENT
FOR IN THE END THE LIGHT SHALL FALTER
AND A FALLEN STAR SHALL SUCCEED THE THRONE OF CHRIST
BRINGING THE WORLD INTO UTTER DARKNESS...

[MUSIC: MALDISMES, LORD OF THE MISTY MOORS]
[LYRICS: IXITHRA, LORD OF THE SYLVAN SHADOWS]
