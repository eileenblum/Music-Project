A DARK SHROUD ENTOMBS THIS ETERNAL EVE
IN ANCIENT AND FORGOTTEN MYSTERIES
SHADOWS DRIFT THROUGH THE SOLEMN GRAVES
BRINGING MEMORIES OF AGES LONG PAST
THE EARTH'S FROZEN TEARS
SHATTER UPON THE STONE
OF MEMORIALS LONG FORGOTTEN
THE MOON HAS CAST A SPELL
COVERING ALL IN ITS FROST
THE WINTER WINDS BLOW COLD AS ICE
ACROSS THE FROZEN LANDS
THE SUN NO LONGER SHINES
ON A WORLD FORSAKEN TO THE DARK
ETERNAL WINTER, THE EARTH IS DEAD
FOREVER NIGHT, ALL IS BLACK

[MUSIC: MALDISMES, LORD OF THE MISTY MOORS]
