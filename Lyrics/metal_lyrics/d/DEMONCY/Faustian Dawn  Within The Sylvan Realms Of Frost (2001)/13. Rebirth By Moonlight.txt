LONG AGO I STOOD ALONE
ON A DARK BARREN MOUNTAIN
OVERLOOKING THE LANDS BELOW
I KNELT IN PROFOUND SORROW
OFFERING MY SOUL TO THE NIGHT
I CALLED OUT FOR DEATH AND WAITED,
BUT AS MY LIFE SLOWLY FADED
THE NIGHT REACHED OUT FOR ME
AND TOOK ME AS IT'S CHILD
AND A DARK ONE CAME AND OFFERED IT'S GIFT
TO DRINK OF THE SACRED BLOOD
IN ECSTASY UNPARALELLED BY MORTAL LUST
I EMBRACED THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
AND BECAME ONE WITH THE SHADOWS
IN SILENCE I WEPT
AS I BEHELD FOR THE FIRST TIME
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL BEAUTY
UTTER DARKNESS TRULY UNBLEMISHED BY LIGHT

[LYRICS: IXITHRA, LORD OF THE SYLVAN SHADOWS]
