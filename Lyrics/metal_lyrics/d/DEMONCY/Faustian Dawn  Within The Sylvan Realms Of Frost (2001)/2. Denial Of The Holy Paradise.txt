RIVER OF TEARS
DRIPS FROM THE SKIES
RIVER OF BLOOD
FROM ANGELS' EYES
RIVER OF SORROW
SAD AND DEEP
RIVER OF WOE
THE ANGELS WEEP

SHADES OF DEATH
WHITE WINGS FALL
THE ANGELS KNEEL
IN POOLS OF BLOOD

BLEEDING WOUNDS
TORMENT HOLY FLESH
FORSAKEN PRAYERS
SCORN THE SUFFERANCE OF CHRIST

CROWN OF THORNS
WITHERS AND DIES
DENIAL OF THE
HOLY PARADISE

[LYRICS: IXITHRA, LORD OF THE SYLVAN SHADOWS AND ARAGON AMORI]
