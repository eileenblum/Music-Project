THE AFTERGLOW OF WHAT MAY LIE AHEAD
TAINTED WITH SO DEEP A RED
WITH SPARKS OF BLACK SHINING DIM
IN WHIRLING WINDS, SO TENDER, SO GRIM
SOULS ENTANGLED IN THE BRANCHES OF A DEAD TREE
SHATTERED DREAMS OF ONCE BEING FREE
SHINY WINGS ACROSS THE SILVERY MOON
DESCENDING UNTO THE TORTURED EARTH SOON
TAKE ME UP, I'M NOT WILLING TO STAY
AND CARRY, CARRY ME FAR AWAY
WHEN LEATHERY WINGS WITH GRACE CARESS
I'LL SOON BE REBORN IN DARKNESS...
SO WHERE ARE YOU HEADING TO NOW, BLACKEST OF ALL
WHOSE MADNESS CAN'T BE CALMED
BY ANY SECRET UNKNOWN REVEALED?
YOUR PRIDE A GLORIOUS HALO RADIATING LIKE THE DYING SUN
OVER THE NEVER ENDING DESERTS.
YOUR STRENGTH OF AIR, WATER, EARTH,
AND THE ALL CONSUMING FIRE.
AND YOUR DESPERATE BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF THE WILD...
THE FALLACY OF REVELATION,
OF CREATING A "BEAST"
SO DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE KNOW OF YOU
ENSTRANGED VISIONS WILL NEVER
ENTER OUR HEARTS DEDICATED TO YOU
SHATTERED LIES WHO DOES NOT KNOW
SHATTERED BY HIS OWN CREATION,
ILLUSION COME TRUE
THE NIGHT IS OURS, THE NIGHT,
THE PALE MOON, AND THE STAR DESERT
PATHS THROUGH ICY MOUNTAINS
AND OVER BROKEN BRIDGES
GUIDED BY THE RADIATING LIGHT
NO ONE THERE TO FOLLOW WHO
DOES NOT FEEL
WHAT DRIVES US ON AND ON
BUT WILL BE LOST IN ETERNITY
THESE PATHS CAN ONLY
BE PASSED BY US
ALONE
THE NIGHT IS OURS, THE NIGHT,
THE PALE MOON, AND THE STAR DESERT
AS WE'VE BEEN CROUCHING
IN DARKEST PLACES FOR MILLENIUMS,
NOT TO BE SEEN BY THE MORTAL EYE...
AS WE'VE BEEN WITNESSING STARS DYING
AND SNOW COVERING ANY TRACES ONE MIGHT HAVE LEFT...
AS WE'VE REMAINED IN THE SHADOW'S EMBRACE BY NIGHT
WE'VE BEHELD A WORLD IN WHICH WE NEVER BELONGED
WE'VE KEPT OUR MYSTERIES IN OBSCURITY
OUR WORLDS OF THOUGHT AND EMOTION
OUR WISDOM AND MAGIC,
THE TRULY TRAGIC EXISTENCE IN THESE REALMS...
...WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT THIS
WOULD END
WE AWAIT OUR REBIRTH IN DARKNESS.
ETERNAL DARKNESS...
