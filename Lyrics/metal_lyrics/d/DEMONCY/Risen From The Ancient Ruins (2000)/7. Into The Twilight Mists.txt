ANCIENT SPIRITS CALL TO ME
THROUGH THIS FOREST OF TRANSLUCENT DREAM
LIKE A PASSAGE THROUGH DARK CRYPTS
UNHOLY PRAYERS SURROUND MY DISMAL DESCENT
SWIRLING MISTS PART REVEALING THE SACRED PATH
THE DUSK FADES INTO A SEA OF BLACK
GLOOMY SHADOWS LIE STILL AND SILENT
THE WHISPERING WINDS SO BITTER AND COLD
FOREVER SHALL I HAUNT THE NIGHT
MESMERIZED BY DARKENED SKIES
AND THE CALL OF THE RISING FULL MOON
INTO THE TWILIGHT MISTS
SO MYSTERIOUS AND DARK
AND THROUGH THIS DREARY HAZE
OF MELANCHOLIC BLISS
MY SOUL SHALL FLY FREE IN DARKNESS

[LYRICS: IXITHRA, LORD OF THE SYLVAN SHADOWS]
