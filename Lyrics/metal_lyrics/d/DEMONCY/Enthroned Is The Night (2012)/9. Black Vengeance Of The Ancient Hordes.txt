From archaic temple ruins, hidden out of space and time
The forgotten aether of primordial spawn

Formed in dark matter, unleashed in the energy of cosmic black holes, reaching to infinity
Through the silence of black dwarven stars awakens a cold malevolent force

Shapeless formed creatures come forth from the shadows
Grotesquely horrid abominations from beyond the outer spheres

Twisted malign horrors breed death and destruction
Returning the world to the depths of voidal abyss

Hate filled black skies rage, bringing furious storms
Charged electrical currents scorch and burn the earth

Lords of chaos take to their wings, raising hordes of ancient creation
By broken seal through open gate, ascension from the lower realms
