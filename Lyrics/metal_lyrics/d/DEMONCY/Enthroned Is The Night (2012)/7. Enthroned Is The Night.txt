On this endless night, through the moon and stars
The very essence of nuit is enthroned above all

Mysterious and haunting, this nocturnal presence of immeasurable beauty consumes me from within

Silence merges with echoes of aeons past
In the ancient stone of deep earthen hollows

Eternities pass and I remain hidden in the dark, away from the light

Enshrouded forever in the blackness and cold embrace of death's shadows

A whisper in the wind, riding the wings of time
A shadow in the dark, coveting the secrets of night
