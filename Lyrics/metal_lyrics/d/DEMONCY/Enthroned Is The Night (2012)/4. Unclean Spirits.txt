Necropolis bathed in moonlit gloom and creeping mist of deathly pallor

A monument of death's great claim, held upon the soul's of the living

Ominous gates guard this threshold, adorned with sigils in broken stone

The catacombs cloaked in silence, festering the darkness held within

Impurity surrounds my dismal descent into the sorcery of aeons forgotten

Concealed coffins in abysmal tombs
Recitation, the words of invocation

Sprinkling the dust of human remains, I complete the necromantic pact

Ancient words spoken in sacred tongues, unclean spirits encircle the air
Haunting voices echo from crypts below, as unholy phantoms rise on silent wings
