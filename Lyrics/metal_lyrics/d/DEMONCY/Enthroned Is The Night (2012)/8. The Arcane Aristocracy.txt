Descendant of the unearthly starlight veil

On the wings of night I fly, coveting the shadows, enraptured
The moon as my mistress betrothed for countless centuries, immortal

Seas of blood wash upon my ethereal tomb on these endless nights so cold and dark

Eternally wandering throughout the lands
Drowning in the black shadows, dreaming

I am death's whisper in timeless winds
Traversing the unknown reaches of the abyss

Through the eyes of the undead, the vast mysteries are revealed
Immortalized in sanguine pools, where time has ceased to exist

In unfettered exploration of the infinite, all life force is mine to drain

A summoning of immeasurable power
Nocturnal arts, the arcane aristocracy

I sleep deep within the earth, through the graves comes my rebirth
I rise in the darkness of night to drink the blood of life
