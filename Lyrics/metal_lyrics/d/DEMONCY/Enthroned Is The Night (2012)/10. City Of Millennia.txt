Carved in rock my ancestors' names, perished once in cold blueish flames
The grass long gone from misty mountains, fetid breath spewed forth from abandoned fountains

Dimensional gates forgotten in this age, reopened soon with ancient rage
A time beyond time's creature leers from chaos-ridden outer spheres

Circles, squares and broken pylons, sorcerers' lights announcing the ones
Circles, squares and broken pylons, sorcerers' lights announcing the ones

Parallel sights, spaceless and stealthy
Ruined and scattered what once was wealthy
Imaginary fortress crumbling, so brittle
Giant stones, a boundless riddle

Behold now this city of millennia

Symbols in dust slowly washed away, disappearing as a mind goes astray
Wandering dreamless in fear of the past, multidimensional realms so vast

Madness confronted with seraphic delight, mingling and prospering, the essence of night
Crawling shapeless and omnipresent, intervening forces twisted and bent

Flickering lights reflected by stars, cold fire melting sand to glass
Engulfed in darkness shines this domain, cutting memories, crystalline pain

As I lie dormant in this mighty kingdom of stone, Dame Kum Dame - the ultimate promise
Sharpeyed entities lingering there, finally home in their hidden lair
