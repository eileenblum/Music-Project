From beyond the stars they wait for the dreaming dead to awaken
Slumbering in deep ocean depths, unleashing ultimate destruction

Diseaseous winds of plague will sweep across the lands
Turning all to dust and ruin, bringing forth the final end

As night devours the light, stars will fall from the sky
The moon will strike the earth, as chaos consumes the cosmos

From within a black sarcophagous, at the center of infinity

Death shall reach forth and consume all of life
The shadows will converge on the ruin of this world

And the eternal creation of night's endless black dominion
