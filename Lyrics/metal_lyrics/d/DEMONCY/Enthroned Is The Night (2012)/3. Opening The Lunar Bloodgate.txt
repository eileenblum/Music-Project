Sigils of blood anoint the gate, unveiling night's hidden entrance

In this great solar eclipse all light shall starve and perish
As phantoms of the astral abyss drain the cosmic life force

Specters of venomous black essence rise from ancestral tombs and deathlike silence conquers

As I whisper coldly in the dark a curse to kill you all

Through the spheres of eternity my looming presence remains

As I embrace the shadows divine in longing for the other side
Drifting in endless darkness, a morose sea of tranquil morbidity

Incandescent lunar orb from within shall I harness
The power of the stars, wreaking havoc upon the cosmos

Into the vast expanse of space and celestial storms
