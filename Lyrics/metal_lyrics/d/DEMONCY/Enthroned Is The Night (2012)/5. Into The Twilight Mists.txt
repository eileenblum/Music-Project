Ancient spirits call to me through this forest of translucent dream
A luminous vision of death's transcendence

Lunar rays illuminate, revealing the sacred path
The dusk fades into an ominous sea of black

Forever shall I haunt the night, traversing mysteries unknown
Mesmerized by darkened skies and the call of the rising full moon

Gloomy shadows lie still and silent
The whispering winds, so bitter and cold

Into the twilight mists, so mysterious and dark
The veils of negative existence, obscured in the fog

And through this dreary haze of melancholic bliss
My soul shall fly free in eternal darkness

A mirror into the abyss reflecting upon itself
Echoing the nocturnal call, beckoning from within
