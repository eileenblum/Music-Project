BEHIND THE DEPTHS OF SORROW
LIES THE HIDDEN PATH...
FOREST OF INFINITE WISDOM
ALAS THE PATH IS FOUND
DARK BRANCHES OF WITHERED TREES
TELL DISMAL STORIES BY COLD WINDS
NIGHTFALL... ALL IS STILL
KNEEL IN ADORATION OF BEAUTIFUL SILENCE
ABLE TO COLLECT THOUGHTS UNKNOWN
BEHOLD AUTUMNS THUNDER
STORM OF BLACK WINDS
SWEEPING THE DUST OF PAST NATURE
NOW ALL IS TRANQUIL
ADVENTURE FURTHER ONTO THE PATH
FINALLY BLISS IS DISCOVERED
NEVER TO DEPART THE FOREST BEYOND
SACRIFICING THE OUTSIDE WORLD
FOR KNOWLEDGE UNKNOWN
ENTER DOMAINS OF FOREVER FREEDOM
BEHIND THE DEPTHS OF SORROW

[LYRICS: AELDEOST]
