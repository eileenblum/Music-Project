AUTUMN BREEZE ARRIVES
PREPARE FOR THE SEASON OF ANCIENTS
LEAVES FALL WITH FOREVER WINDS
AND AFTER ALL HAS FALLEN AND DIED
THE SUN WILL TURN TO DUSK
EARTH BECOMES AS COLD AS THE SOULS WITHIN IT
SLEEP TO LAST BRIGHT DAY
AWAKENED BY THE SILENCE OF SNOWFALL
A BEAUTY BEYOND BELIEF
EMBODIED IN ETERNAL WHITE ICE
UNLOCK THE GATEWAY TO A KINGDOM ONCE FORGOTTEN,
BUT SOON TO BE REMEMBERED
AND AFTER ALL HAS ARISEN AND SPAWNED
VISION A TWILIGHT OF FOREVER FROST
THIS IS A TIME OF CELEBRATION
EVOCATION OF INNERMOST PLEASURE
BEHOLD THE WINTER BLISS...

[LYRICS: AELDEOST]
