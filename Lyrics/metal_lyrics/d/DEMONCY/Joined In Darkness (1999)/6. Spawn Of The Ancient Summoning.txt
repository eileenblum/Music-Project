ANCIENT FOREST OF N'GAI
OFFSPRING OF ABOMINATION
EVIL FIENDS OF DARKNESS
SPAWN OF THE WICKED DEMON

IN DREAMS THEY BECKON ME
INTO THE ANCIENT FOREST
WHERE LIES A KEY
THE GATES OF PRIMORDIAL CHAOS

FIRES BLAZE IN THE CENTER CLEARING
IN WORSHIP OF THE ANCIENT GODS
BODIES WRITHE IN A SERPENTINE MASS
INDULGING IN THE RITES OF CHAOS

I BEND IN ACQUIESCENCE TO THE BLACKENED THRONE
THE GODS OF CHAOS AWAIT BEYOND THE GATE
CTHULU AWAKENS FROM HIS ANCIENT SLEEP
NO LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE FOREST TREES

[LYRICS: IXITHRA, LORD OF THE SYLVAN SHADOWS]
