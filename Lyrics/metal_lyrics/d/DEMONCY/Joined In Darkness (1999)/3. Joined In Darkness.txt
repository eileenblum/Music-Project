IN PITCH BLACK OF NIGHT
SHROUDED IN MIST
BATHED IN FULL MOON LIGHT
SILENT, THE FOREST SURROUNDS ME
THE WIND BLOWS COLD THROUGH THE TREES
I KNEEL IN ADORATION OF THE DARK
DENY THE LIFE OF MORTAL WAYS
FOREVER SHUN THE LIGHT OF DAY
LIVE IN ETERNAL NIGHT
NEVER AGAIN TO SEE THE DAWN 
BLACK CLOUDS GATHER OBSCURING THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
SHADOWS ARE CAST IN NOCTURNAL SOLITUDE
THE HOWLING WOLVES CALL MY NAME
AND AN ETERNITY OF SORROW IS RECLAIMED
AS THE SPIRIT OF NIGHT SPIRALS MY DARKENED SOUL
AND ENVELOPES ME IN IT'S BLACK WINGS 
DENY THE LIFE OF MORTAL WAYS
FOREVER SHUN THE LIGHT OF DAY
LIVE IN ETERNAL NIGHT
NEVER AGAIN TO SEE THE DAWN 

: IXITHRA, LORD OF THE SYLVAN SHADOWS]
