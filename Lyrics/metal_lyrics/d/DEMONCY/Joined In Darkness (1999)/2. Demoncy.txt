DEMONIC ENTITY OF NIGHT
I CALL THY NAME
COME BEFORE ME
OF THY OWN FREE WILL
CURSED ARE THE SORCERORS
THAT BIND YOU AGAINST YOUR WILL
SHOW THYSELF IN THY TRUE FORM
THY HIDEOUSNESS IS BEAUTY
GRACE ME WITH THY UNHOLY PRESENCE
FOR I SEEK THY COUNSEL
GRANT TO ME THE KNOWLEDGE AND POWER
OF WHICH THOU SEE FIT
THOU ART FREE
TO ROAM THE EARTH
BRINGING DEATH, DESTRUCTION, AND CHAOS
UPON THE HUMAN RACE
TO TRAVEL FREELY BETWEEN
YOUR PLANE OF EXISTENCE AND THE EARTH
FOR THE GATEWAY SHALL REMAIN OPEN
FOR AS LONG AS THOU WILL IT

[LYRICS: IXITHRA, LORD OF THE SYLVAN SHADOWS]
