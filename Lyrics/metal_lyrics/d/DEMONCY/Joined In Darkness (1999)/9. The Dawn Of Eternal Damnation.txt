BROKEN SEALS OF SEVEN
THE UNDOING OF ALL CREATION
FORETELLS THE COMING DAWN
OF ETERNAL DAMNATION
SEVEN ANGELS BURNING AS THEY FALL
THEIR TRUMPETS SILENT AND BROKEN
THE HEAVENS ARE ENGULFED IN FLAMES
AND HOLY CHURCHES FALL IN RUINS
THE SEAS TURN TO BLOOD AND THE SKY IS BLACK
AS THE THRONE OF GOD IS USURPED BY DEATH
THE FINAL DAY OF JUDGEMENT DENIED
ALL UNWORTHY OF THE DARK SHALL PERISH
DESOLATE EYES ASCEND IN HATE
REVELING IN THE DARKNESS OF SIN
FALLING INTO THE DEPTHS BELOW
CAST FROM THE LIGHT
INTO THE GLORY OF HELL
WEEPING MORTALS UNDIVINE
YOUR SOULS SHALL NEVER REST
ENDLESS TORMENT FOREVER AWAITS
FOR WE ARE THE DEATH OF THE HUMAN RACE
DEMONS TEAR YOUR "SACRED" FLESH
TO REAP THE INNARDS OF FILTH
FALL TO YOUR KNEES AND BOW
TO THE LORDS OF DARKNESS
