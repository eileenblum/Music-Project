WE ARE THE WINGS OF DARKNESS
AND THE ARMS OF DEATH
SCOURGING THE EARTH
WITH FURY AND MALEVOLENCE
WE ARE THE FIRE THAT BURNS
THE HEAVENS TO ASH
TORN WINGS OF ANGELS
FALL UNTO SCORCHED LANDS
WE ARE AS ONE WITH THE SHADOWS
EMBRACED BY NIGHT
EMBODIMENT OF EVIL
DESTROYERS OF LIGHT
IN COLD GRIMNESS
WE ARE THE HATRED CONSUMING ALL
AS THE MORTAL REALMS FALL
DRAINED OF THE ESSENCE OF LIFE
WE ARE AS ONE WITH THE SHADOWS
EMBRACED BY NIGHT
EMBODIMENT OF EVIL
DESTROYERS OF LIGHT
