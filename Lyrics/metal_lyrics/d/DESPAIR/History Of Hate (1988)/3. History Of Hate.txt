Thousands of years
Ruling of the power
Power and the glory
And aristocrat terror
Never ever justice
Never equality
Underdogs born underdogs
Never become free
Talented and given
No matter if or not
No chance for a better life
The poor burned hot

Religious warriors
Slaughter and mutilate
Justice is always
A minute too late
The rich get richer
The poor poorer
The way the third world
Got treated by emperors

Sucked out colonies
Beggars on their knees
The cross was taught
Taught by the sword

The peasant owed
Their will is bowed
Treated like shit
Paid with spit

Feeling the boot in the neck
Uprise people let ï¿½em all wreck
Hoping for revolution
2000 years
The weak is fucked
Forever he bears
