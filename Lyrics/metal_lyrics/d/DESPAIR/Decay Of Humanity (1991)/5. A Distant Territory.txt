Walking through the doorway of our souls
We always step into a distant space
Where our spirits fly unchained
And are forever free
In the land of our dreams
Far away from cold reality

Through magic territories we travel on
And try to search for answers
Within our minds

Suddenly a dream passes by
A cold wind blows to freeze my mind
I'm torn back into reality
The end of all my fantasies
I wish myself back into the dream
While I fight against the stream
As coldness grips my heart
I fall down into the dark
