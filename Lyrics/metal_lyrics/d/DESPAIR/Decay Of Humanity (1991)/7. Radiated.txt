Out in the cold - a dying world
The human race is lost
Now there's no God to save this world
Now we'll have to pay the price
Rotten nature, infected place
No way out of this maze

We keep feeding the machinery
The world is bleeding our humanity
We keep feeding our insanity

Go die - if you will never learn
Don't cry - when you see there's no return

So we destroy what we need to live
We hit what we should pay attention to

Rivers green - the trees are dead
Poisoned air the sky turns black
Now there's no one there to cry
Now we all will die
