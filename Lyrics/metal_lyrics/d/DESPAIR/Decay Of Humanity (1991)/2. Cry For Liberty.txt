Look at this corageous young men
Their lifeless bodies are lying in the streets
Shot down by machine guns
Their only weapon was the truth
A peaceful fight they fought
For freedom and liberty they marched

A cry for liberty
The world just can't ignore
A cry for liberty
Why do we ignore

Again and again people are opressed
Violence is religion - injustice is the law
Did we learn what they thought?
A hopeless fight they fought
Astonished we stood still
They had to pay the bill

They stood up for their rights
They chose a peaceful fight
Their words were just ignored
Their hopes died by the sword
