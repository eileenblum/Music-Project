Masters of mutilation
Your profession is death
You are playing with their lives
Wiping them all out
Kill without emotions
Who can be so cruel?
You keep on killing animals
Behaving like God

Your business is pain
You kill in the name of science
Helpless toys in your hands
Victims of our vanity

Innocent animals
They are victims of so called experiments
Slowly tortured to death
Extreme agony to test our perfumery
