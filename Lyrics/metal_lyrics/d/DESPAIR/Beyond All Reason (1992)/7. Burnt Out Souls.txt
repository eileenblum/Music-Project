Like the sun
That burns the desert ground
You leave scars
On innocent souls
You suck their brains out
And then fill them up with paroles
Young boys to tell propaganda tales
Look into these hopeless eyes
As they get raped
By the camera-eye
A young life sold to war
A wasted youth
Searching far a lost childhood

War is lie
War is cruel
War is lie
War is cruel

I've seen a lake of tears
Shed by the mothers
Of the disappeared
A sea of blood
Red as the sinking sun
We cry for children lost
In wars we never won

Cries of pain
That we can't ignore
All around the world when children go to war
So just switch on the news
Or listen to the radio
Look into these eyes
Like into a deep, black  hole
I've seen this face
So many times before
Child of Vietnam or any other war
Young boys to tell propaganda tales
Soldier boy
Left to die

War is lie
War is cruel
War is lie
War is cruel
