She was
One to criticize
She never had been quiet
Never, no never compromise
She had rage in her eyes
No trust in no government
Searching for solutions
She thought that she could change the world
Time for execution

Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more

Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more

Down, down
Into the underground
And never fight alone
She tried to make peace with a gun
And her heart turned to stone
No dreams
No illusions
And nothing changed at all
Hiding from reality
'Cause she always failed the mark

All those who died
By my gun
By the bombs
I wish all this could be undone

Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more

Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more

Coldness
A grey and rainy day
She wonders what went wrong
Wasted
Years have past by
She's getting tired of the fight
Now she can feel the emptiness
Deep inside her heart
While she tried to reach the light
She walked into the dark
