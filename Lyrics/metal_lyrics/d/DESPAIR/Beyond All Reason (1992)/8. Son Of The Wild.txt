Fly with the wind
Over the land
Like a storm
Wild is your heart
Brave is the horse
That you ride on
No chains, no walls
Only the sea
An endless distance
Faithful you stood
There and you watched
The sinking sun

So grateful the land
You held in your hand
You son of the wild
I saw tears in your eyes

Ride like the wind
Over the land
Like a storm
Indian son
You were so pride
You were free

Your pride has gone away now
Wiped out
Torn away
Dropped down
Like a tear
Now you dwell in your dreams
