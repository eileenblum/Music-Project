No more colour in my life
All empty
Can't face another day like this
I can't stand the pain I feel
In the deep of my heart

The ignorant took it all away
All that had been
All I am
Inspirations
Torn away from me
And in the void
Only grey

Blind my eyes
But I see
Tell me lies
But I know

In this world of despair
Am I just alive to bear
And when I'm gone is what's left
Is there someone who cares

In this world of despair
Am I just alive to bear
And when I'm gone is what's left
Is there someone who cares

No more colour
Emptiness
Can't face another day

No more colour
Emptiness
Can't face another day
