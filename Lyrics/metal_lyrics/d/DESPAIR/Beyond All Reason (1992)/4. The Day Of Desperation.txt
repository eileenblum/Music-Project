My heart turned to stone
As I heard the news that day
The bloody game has started
In the eastern world far away
The cry of a million people
Echoed into a void
The arguments of reason died
As the first bomb was thrown

No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
Those who deal
All of you
Who deal with death

On the day of desperation
As the desert sky turned to black
Did you realize what you have done
When you used to deal
With poison gas
A war for oil
And blood-red sand
And Mr. President who smiled
At his war-machine performance
And at the thousands who died

No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
Those who deal
All of you
Who deal with death

Sell the gas
History told you what to do
Poison gas
A memory of Nazi's world war two
The innocent
Nearly wiped out by your deadly wares
Industry
The dealers of death
Will we never learn

No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
Those who deal
All of you
Who deal with death

No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
