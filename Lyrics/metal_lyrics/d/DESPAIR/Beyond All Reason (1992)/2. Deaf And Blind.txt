Killed with a knife
You died for a different point of view
The evil judge
He took your life you said too much
They cut your throat
And spill your blood 'cause you betrayed
Their holy words
You never worried and now you're dead

Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death

Fight the lies
Don't be quiet
We will
Tell no lies
No more lies

Thrown into fire
Your written word
They call it crime
No hope for the betrayer
Religious lies
While fanatic preachers scream
And the millions cry
No one used to see the truth
'Cause they're all deaf and blind

Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death

Freedom for
The ones who dare to say the truth
The ones who tell
The stories of hate and love

If we don't care
About the written word today
Then we will lose
A part of our humanity

You wrote a book
You wrote a book with pages coloured
Red like blood
You never thought that it could be yours
As long as if
Intolerance bars every way of liberty
I won't believe in the human race

They are deaf and blind
