are you happy?
are you content?
well i feel like a
goddamned dog
trapped behind a fence
i'm a poor unfeeling bastard
and i don't care
what happens after -
roll in the dead
made yourself a bed, huh?
your life was shorter
than expected
open the door....
as this hell begins
it no sooner ends
increments of peace
increments of pain
wished to hell he'd die
was the real lie
told his final words
to just some worthless girl
waved the passing time
sucked his bygones dry
swallowed whole by life
pathetic insect you are
impervious circle of unrest
sea of regret
insideous heap of torment
resting hideous strips of flesh
and the roaches can live
without heads
says the revolver clenched
in his hands
you scratch my back
and i'll claw your eyes out
leave them
drenched in anguish
cause only humans cry
when humans die
laughing
