cold is the hell
that beckons onward
desire the stench of innocence
you bring me closer and closer
gliding over the icy tundra
melting our flesh
each other writhing
in lustful pleasure
mush!
harnessed, but unleashed
shameless
bleeding
feeding upon your inhibitions
lost
mush...
