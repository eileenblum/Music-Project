i went to the park
to meet the lark
the lark weren't there
but i don't care
lark?!
breathe landlords
breathe, everyone's a whore
breathe
you addict
you whore
would you fuck the world?
everyone's a whore
faking love and wanting more.
what is in the sky
is in the blood
is in the brain
so far, the lark song
hasn't reached anyone,
none
landlords landlords
lark nests in landfills
you own
do you know?
well, i warn you
they'll scorn you
as old as they feel
and they don't feel
anything
so breathe all you can
while you can
means to ends
emptynest
lark, is it gonna be
alright?
