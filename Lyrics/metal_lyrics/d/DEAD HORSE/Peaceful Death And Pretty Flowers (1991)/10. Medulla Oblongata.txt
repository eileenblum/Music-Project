vultures circling
inside me, oh my
screaming
i e o!
once more washed ashore
riptide mauling you
goddog clawing your
goddamned crumbling spine
life just fucks with my head
i got this terrible pain
my cranium scraping
i read somewhere
the suicide rate is rising
regurgitate belly full of strict-
nine
life just fucks with my head
i'm infernal
life is severed memories
that hangs forever
butcher of my own mind
irrestible flying
with the dead and the dying
hope is alone, hope is dead
life just fucks with my head
