like a fish on the line
i'm struggling
wild horses trampling man
over enemy lines
the battle fan
is grinding mother nature
inevitable masochism
massacring
bleeding fire engine red
blades are craving like
jet engines roar
incision showering ammunition
mourning lights the souls of
marching corpses through
the earth they're mulching
reflections of tomorrow
wither away
screaming hallelujah
momentum soul vacume
surging forward like a dragon
racing cross the planet's face
murmur in the distance
blackened catalystic hate
momentum soul vacume
surging forward
turn
