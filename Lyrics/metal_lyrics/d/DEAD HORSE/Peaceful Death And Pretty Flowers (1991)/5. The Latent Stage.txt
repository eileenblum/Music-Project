the feel is in my hands
like cancer it's growing
there's no solution
so choke the shit
out of something
and blood is thicker
than water
and casually spills
over and over
we mutilate each other
brothers and sisters fight
rabbid descendants
menace of man
carrying out your god's
masterplan of armaggedeon
and i know
and history shows
and bombs explode
three two one
children learn to fight
what is right
what is right?
you pigs in your costumes
hypocrites, all of you
all of nonrestraining
i'm confused hovering
like a poltergeist its reeling
unbridled agony
a lessor man of insanity
would want to rule this world
no idiots or war machines
have the power
to follow suit of all man's roots
a pagan ritual
hate's a part of all of us
a part of all of us
negative will be
instinct, family
but even i can murder
and suddenly the words
i've writ are pointless to me
