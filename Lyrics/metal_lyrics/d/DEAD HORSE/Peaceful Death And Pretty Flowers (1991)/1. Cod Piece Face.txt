i want to open your mind
i want to fell your remorse
i want to bathe in the blood
that gave life to the corpse
no longer prisoners of time
i caress your remains
a lifeless meaningless shell
to store the hurt and pain
waiting for the sun
scattered rats of solace
climbing the ropes to the
homeless soul
waiting for the sun
poisonous wound are healing
black water birth
cleanse the sores and the
earth is waiting for the sun
