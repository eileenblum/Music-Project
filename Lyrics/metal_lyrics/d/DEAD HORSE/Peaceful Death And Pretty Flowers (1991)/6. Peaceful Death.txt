lee all
is there room in hell?
you think i want to be
so worthless
call my name and i will surface
the purpose denies man
sunday evening
returning home from church
the masses of people
lives summerized
in a paragraph
not much different from mine
were after the same thing
were after the same
peaceful death
have mercy on my sole
have mercy on us all
the average i envy
for his ignorance will everlast
eternally and his faith
his blessings written in black
but your condemning
my thoughts
a gift eternally wrapped
to rat in a box with a clear head
and all around the voices of hell
and i'm following you
you don't want to believe
i so, i do
