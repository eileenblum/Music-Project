la la la blah bluh bleh
cough up my lung s
for you, i would do anything
to watch you consumed
give me your money
la la la blah bluh bleh
1 900 make me money
1 900 tons of money
1 900 will never change me
look mom i'm on tv
convinced yourself
to realizing
the future is commercializing
the tv and radio
you tell four fans you've gone
through hell, so all
your dope's their spending
money you sit back you laugh
you think it's funny
pawn it off with contributions
end it to your favorite
institutions
paralyzed and you don't see
you have your wealth
but honestly
you couldn't give a shit
you couldn't give a damn
all your friends are changing
they just want what i have
la la la blah bluh bleh
