well here i am
i'm rationalizing again
ha! there ain't no mystery,
baby i'm dying
trapped in your spiders web
cringing pain
i loathe the word eternity
now is forever
all the same again
so long, miss me
just look at you look at me
your eyes are smoldering fire
if i'd been beautiful
i'd been as pitiful
but it's all over
bond as weak
as treads you spin
asrielle, you molt your skin
it feels like you've been gone
all along
grasp the moments,
the moments gone
then run away
i stared at the sun
for hours, and i was
blinded to some
no longer you and me
against the world
but i'm blind
i'm fucking stronger
