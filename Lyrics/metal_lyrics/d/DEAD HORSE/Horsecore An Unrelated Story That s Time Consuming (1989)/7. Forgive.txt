Dear God
Accept my apology
I never believed in you
I only believed in me

Dead as I lie
My horse and I
I took what I need the most
Forgive and forget
But I'll ride you any how
Please don't take me yet

Dead as I lie
My horse and I
Dead horse
To send you back the way you came
Dead horse
Running through your veins
Has not to do with horsemen
Or waging Satan's war
And if you ride a dead horse
You won't be riding very far
