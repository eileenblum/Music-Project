Life is army surplus
One hundred thousand die
The US army claims us
for its filthy fucking lies

With weapons from metel
We'll surely rot in hell
For smashing baby's faces
Or blinding them with maces

Full in indignation
Screaming "screw the nation"
Dirty fucking fascists
You call this government
The name you give democracy
My death at your consent

Full of indignation
Screaming "screw the nation"
Off I go to war now
Dying for my country wow!
Bodies falling on me
Agent orange I can't see

Life is army surplus
One hundred thousand die
The US army claims us
for its filthy fucking lies
