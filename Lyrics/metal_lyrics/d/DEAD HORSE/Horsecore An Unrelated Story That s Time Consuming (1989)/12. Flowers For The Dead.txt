Gather ashes tonight
Kiss the black gound and cry
The final march to the grave
The fate of death to which we slave
Day after day
You fall to the grave
Denying the truth
They'll once visit you
The grave is upturned
The casket is burned
and left behind all they will find
is flowers for the dead
Souls in mourning
Casket
Substance of death
Encased in your flesh
Diseased
Rapidly rotting away
Your time
Your mind
