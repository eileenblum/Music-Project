Don't question the light
Blind faith's where they want you to be
God is all there is to be seen
Peace can be sought if your mind remains clean
He who has the guts to look
beyond the pointless path he took
will not give into antichrist
but spare himself from mindless strife
And that he used to be too blind to see
No matter how you live your day
Death comes lurking anyway
Brainwashed, you're a child of god
Too young to understand
Thus your learn to fear yourself
and pray for peace within
Save you from eternal hell
Brainwashed

Don't question the light you don't see
Blind faith's where they want you to be
God is all there is to be seen
Peace can be sought if your mind remains clean
