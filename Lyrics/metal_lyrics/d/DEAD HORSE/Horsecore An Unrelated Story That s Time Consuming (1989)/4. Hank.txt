Hank gets up in the morning
Puts on his boots
Takes a shot of whiskey
Spits out his chew
Shooting deer drinking beer is all 
he thinks about
He's a family man
Down right American

Hank he don't like me
He thinks I'm the enemy
He likes his simple life
He calls his own world
Here I am
Forming the noose
Hank he don't like me
He thinks I'm the enemy
He likes the simple life 
He calls his own world
His paradise
Here I am tightening the noose

Hank is born again
A law abiding citizen
Member of the Aryan race
