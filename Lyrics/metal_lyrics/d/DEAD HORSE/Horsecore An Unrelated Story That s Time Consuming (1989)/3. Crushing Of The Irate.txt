Like the flames that burn the cross
A love that leads to lust
My eyes are filled with pain
My hatred reels no gain
Evil search in bloody palms
For the wisdom in their wrongs
A laughter on our rotting minds
From a justice that is blind

And the flames that once burnt the skin
Are flames of hatred burnt within

Hatred is the people, the country and the world
Television politician a psychedelic swirl
Of living and of dying
A love of no regret
A wishing ending of mankind
A love of nothingness
Hatred is suppression of those that wish to live
A crushing of the irate
