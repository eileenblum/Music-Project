Your father was a nazi
He killed lots of jews
You're really proud of what your father did
You're the Nazi Youth
Hate and prejudice are coming to your town
To rape your mind
Bring the nation down
Doctors and lawyers
The man on the street
They're everywhere but you just cannot see

No excuses
for shortened fuses
Trigger happy
Mindless zombie
In your all white prism
Your prejudism
Mindless zombie
Has tribal wisdom
No excuses 
For prejudices
Mindless zombies
