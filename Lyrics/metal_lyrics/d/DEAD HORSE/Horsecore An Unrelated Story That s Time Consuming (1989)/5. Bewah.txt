Early in my youth
When I was young
Just a little kid
Wanting to have fun

Beer chant

Then when I got old
I could always be found
Wherever beer was sold
Wherever beer was sold
"Somebody give me a 40"
Early in my youth
When I was young
Just a little kid
Wanting to have fun
