Decadence
Rotting cornucopia
Ignorance
A worthy soldier
Sacrificing earth
For our only worth
As we build and destroy
As we build and destroy
Decadence
Rotting cornucopia
Certain death
Slowly detonate
A silent death awaits
Forewarned of our demise
The final breath of cries
