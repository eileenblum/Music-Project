I still remember my direst guilt
violently floating in November's wind.

Your hope was the blood on my open wounds.
Bleeding till there was no life left
The dream of a better world will die with us.

I was born to wander this world alone

I never understood what we were
I still donât understand what we are

We are nothing but dead words.
