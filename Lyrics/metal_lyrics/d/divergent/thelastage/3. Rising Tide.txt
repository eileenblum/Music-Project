Time and time again
until I surrender and I'm the pain
Every night I crave the light
I'm still alive
and I don't give up

illusion in mind
and I feel the time between
don't be fooled by the play of the tide
illusion in mind
illusion in mind

Contemplate the time
All the story is coded in the stream of life
Lost the line of what I've done
the rising tide is loading on
