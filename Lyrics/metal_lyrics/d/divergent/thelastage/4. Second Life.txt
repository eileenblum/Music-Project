This is my cage
the perfect stage
of what I always dreamed to be.

I donât feel right
and I canât realize
that Iâm dying inside.

Holograms are all I see.
Time is consuming me.

I canât escape this maze
where everything makes me the brave.
I know Iâve never tried.
Please let me drown in my second life.

People like me werenât meant to be OK.
Where is the other way?
Thereâs not another way.
Weakness always win every time I try to leave.
Where is the other way?
Thereâs not another way.

I canât escape this maze
where everything makes me the brave.
I know Iâve never tried
Please let me drown in my second life.
