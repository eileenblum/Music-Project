Follow the crowd, unknown the truth
Manipulation comes today
reality will be erased
we are all trapped in virtual life

âMemories of a pre industrial age will soon be erased
We are now taking the path of an old manipulationâ

Live your time behind a screen
we are losing freedom
and they'll anesthetize us
stoned and sleepy with my fears
we sold our freedom
and they'll anesthetize us

A new morality
One mentality
This insanity will make us blind
