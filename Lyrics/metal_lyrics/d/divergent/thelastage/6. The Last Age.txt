So many times I walked
these desolate streets
A disgusting theater is taking shape
before my eyes
Blank minds and hollow lives
we live like machines, rotting inside

This is the last age
The Earth reclaims revenge on us

We are all trapped inside a life
without a meaning
Every day is the same,
but you canât see it

Programmed by digital indoctrination
We will submit to this empire of mediocrity

We are all trapped inside a life
without a meaning
Every day is the same,
but you canât see it
