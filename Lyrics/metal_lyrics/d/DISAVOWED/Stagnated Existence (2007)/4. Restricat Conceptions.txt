Why do you claim to know the truth?

Your knowledge is absolute?
Your own rules and values
Are overruled by the ones
Generated by the masses

The physical reality
Springs from imagination
Which follows the path
Of your core beliefs

Your experience in this reality
Is the product of your beliefs
The beliefs you receive
Are conceptions of all in our society

Restricted conceptions of beliefs

Creation evolves from necessity
It's always on the crossing border of
Existing and non-existing matter
Creation is based upon imagination

You create your own reality
According to the nature of your beliefs

Why do you claim to know it all?

Your experience in the outside world
Is influenced by your beliefs
