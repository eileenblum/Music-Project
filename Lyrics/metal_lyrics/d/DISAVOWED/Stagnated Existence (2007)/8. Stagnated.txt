Reason is the only guidance
Intuition is rejected
Corrupted state of experience
Stagnated by mental passivity
Remembrance of existence
Is non-existent
A mental state of stagnation

Your subjective truth
Is influence by your beliefs

Stagnated by metal passivity

Dark corridors of reason
A labyrinth of darkness
Fear is the only guidance
Reason is a cognitive state of mind

Your subjective truth
Is influenced by your beliefs

Stagnated existence
Corrupted experience
Your subjective reality
Is based upon your own beliefs

The present is the focus point
Of the unbiased reality
