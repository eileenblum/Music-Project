Mountains appeared
Oceans filled
Tidal waves thundered

An explosion of consciousness
A place for birth
A reality was formed

A stream of consciousness
A place for birth
A reality was formed

A burning desire to be reborn
Exploring your path in this live
An exploration of creativity
The eternal validity

An unknown reality
No remembrance of existence
Learning your way in this live
Fulfilling your destiny

Our existence
Our mutual path of collateral being
We have to condemn ourselves
To this mutual task
