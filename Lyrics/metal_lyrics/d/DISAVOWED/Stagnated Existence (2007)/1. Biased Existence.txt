Why can't you see
This truth is only yours
Subjective, your truth, a biased existence
Our mutual reality
Has been defined
By a certain set of core beliefs

Biased existence

The unwritten rules and values
Contain the conceptions
Of all in our society

This is your biased existence

Your existence is biased
The beliefs you grow up with
A biased reference of experience

One need to expand
As many borders as possible
In order to evolve
To ones highest potential

This is your biased existence
