Misconception of perception
Created by the conscious mind
Are based upon reason
Which abstracts reality
Reality is deformed
Perceptions incomplete
Dogmatic point of view
The truth has been concealed

I feel it within
Burning from inside

The veils of misconception

Misconceptions of the conscious mind
The veils of misconception

The unconscious mind
Reveals a whole different approach
To gathering information
Concerning our reality
More dimensions are opened
For revealing the truth
Layers of truth are unveiled
From the veils of misconception

I feel it within
Burning from inside

Is is easy to forget the truth behind the veils!
