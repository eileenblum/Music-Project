Man prefers to identify
With the body of actions and ego

The physical senses
Force oneself to perceive
The exterior forms

The inside vitality within
Matter and form is rejected
Man prefers to identify
With the body of action and ego

The ability to perceive and react
Is a basic characteristic of oneself
The physical senses force one to translate
Experience into physical perception
The inner senses enhance
Ones range of perception

The basis for stagnation
Is the urge to objectivity
Intuition is rejected

Misconceived conceptions
Are caused by restricted perceptions
A limited point of view

Divided by condemn
