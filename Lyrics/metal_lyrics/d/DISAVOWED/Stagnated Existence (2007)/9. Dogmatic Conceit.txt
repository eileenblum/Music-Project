Illusion of darkness
Remains of all doctrines
A perfect construct
religious deceit
The unfaithful condemned

Development in impossible
And creativity would cease to exist

The dogmatic conceit
Controls a state
Of constant stagnation
Illusion of darkness
Remains of doctrines

Eventually, a perfect God
Would end its creation,
because perfection
assumes a state of stagnation

Development is impossible
Creativity would cease to exist

Your faith has misguided you
You walk the land,
Receiving the will of deceit
Perceiving the misguided truth

This dogmatic deceit
Is your own reality!

Dogmatic conceit
