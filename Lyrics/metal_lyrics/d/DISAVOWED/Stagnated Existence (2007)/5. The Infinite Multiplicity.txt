The infinite multiplicity

Multiple realities
Our mutual existence
Infinite interacting possibilities
Subjective realities
The infinite layers of truth
The infinite multiplicity

Aeons of infinite existence
An infinite universe

Multiple dimensions
Multiple entries
Of equal importance

An infinite consciousness
Multiple internal possibilities

The infinite multiplicity

Why thinking in extremes?
A twisted reality!
A stagnated existence
A twisted reality!
Fear is the only guidance
The principle of mankind
