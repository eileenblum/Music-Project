Matter can be divided in opposite extremes.
These opposites permit multiple internal possibilities.

Criticizing matter, from one point of view, can lead to mental restrictions.
Restricted conceptions will occur.
Thinking from extremes, debilitates objectiveness.
Synopsis on matter involved will then be incomplete.

The area between extremes opens up multiple possibilities.
It enhances objectiveness in criticizing matter involved.
Because it's based upon differentiated ways of thinking.
