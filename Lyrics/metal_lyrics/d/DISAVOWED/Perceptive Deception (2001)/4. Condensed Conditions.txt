Condensed conditions lead to controlled behaviour.
It's a way of thinking, focussed on an inaccessible target.
It should only be a guidance, not a higher achievement.
Because the only accomplishment, will be the fullfilment of the goal.

Eventually this behaviour leads to distraction.
This will disguise other relevant targets.

To be objective is a primary priority.
In order to determinate.
The importance of matter involved.
Condensed conditions, a fixed objective can lead to convenience.
Criticism will be obsolete.
