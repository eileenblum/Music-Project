Criticism is a result of man's natural drive to compete with others.
It has to be objective in order to be discussible.
So it has to refer to a tangible object.

It has to be based upon one's own rules and values.
But man cannot free itself from the authoritarian structures.
It's in man's nature to react according to and against these structures.

One has to free oneself from these structures in order to become really objective.
