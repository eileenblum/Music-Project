Evolution is a result of the capability of beings.
To adjust themselves to an ever changing environment.
The need to survive is one of the basic drivers.
It leads to man's drive to compete.

This phenomenon enhances man's drive to unfold oneself.
And to become an individual within the authoritarian society.

The unfolding of oneself is to unfold one's personality.
This will prevent itself to morph into an artificial one.

One need to expand as many borders as possible.
To let one's personality grow according to one's own rules and values.
