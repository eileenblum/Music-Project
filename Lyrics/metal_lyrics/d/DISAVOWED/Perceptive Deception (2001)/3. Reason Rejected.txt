It seperates reality in object and subject.

But in the state of stagnation, only quality will prevail.

Knowledge according to reason is rearranged matter.
It's only the memory of being, without the spirit of living.
Reality isn't static, but dynamic because of quality and intuition.
Which are the spirit of living, it will restrain one from being stuck.

The object of discussion needs to be a tangible one.
To every subject involved, so it has to refer to a tangible object.
