Crises are diguised, it will lead to mental passivity.
Illusion of differences is generated by this phenomenon.

Creativy is surpressed by the self-satisfaction of masses.
Creativity can unfold from imagination.
Stirred by confrontation with any kind of experience.

The confrontation between dominant structures.
And unsupressed intelligence occur at the edges of society.
Crises can be measured in the dynamic state of confrontation.
