Stigmatization can occur
When complex matter
Is processed as a while with intuition.
Functioning as its guidance.

In order to avoid this phenomenon matter must be dividing in layers.
Individually processed, coincidence defines the outcome.

Generative patterns, machines based upon coincidence.
They need to be seen more conceptual then phsyical.
The basic layers are specified, combinations and interactions generated.
These systems trigger new concepts in which the outcome can't be predicted.
