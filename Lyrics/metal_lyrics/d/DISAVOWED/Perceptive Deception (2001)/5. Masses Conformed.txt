The fixation on an image-based way of living.
Within the authoritarian society.
Is a perfect breeding-ground for the masses.
Which are initiator for this phenomenon.

This interaction between the masses and society.
Generates a flow of unwritten rules and values.
It enhances man's natural drive to form clusters.
And to compete with others within the framework of these structures.

The pact between the masses and society.
Morphs personalities into artificial one's.
Our own rules and values will be overruled.
By the one's generated by this dominant pact.
