That night when the lake was stormy and the waves unleashed the horror
The street of onyx shone no more and the walls of Sarnath were torn

Calamity befell in that starless night, destruction of nomads false pride

The last dance of Sarnath

Once the sons of Ib reveled, before the face of rising Nanna
Wherefrom they came in veiling fog the great lake carried with'em

The last dance of Sarnath

After them came the wandering nomads and built the Sarnath next to Ib
With despise in their heart Ib was soon attacked

But after the thousand years, vengeance upon feeble ones
Sarnath lying ruined under the rising sun
