Aldebaran is above horizon, crimson setting azure dyed to dark
Firs paint their portrait in the light of now visible stars
The nightly wings of Byakhee, for I saw their ghastly spread
The portress of nightside unleashed, child of Assatur roams free

Scythe dark sways and the beast revels

Hearken to whispering brook, the headwaters speak
Proclaiming the preys fall
The nightly wings of Byakhee, for I saw their ghastly spread
The portress of the nightside unleashed, Dark ardentour supreme within

Moon towards, now crescent, Night reaching the acme
Rays pale as descant of death and the preys hearts are crying
Shadows lunar cast upon the rain, taste the sweetest sores the day bled
This sight vested as moonlight holt made me forget the pain

"Still the village sleeps, but in the morning horror is to be revealed"

Sun awaking owls aviso sent to warn me, With moon I'll be gone...
