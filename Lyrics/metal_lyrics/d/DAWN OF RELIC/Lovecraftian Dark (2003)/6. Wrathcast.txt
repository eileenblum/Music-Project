Take me away
Take me away I hate this place
It saturates
Darkened dreams now awake

Dream me away
Carry away and fuck this race
Can take the pain
But I once wanna see a honest face

Fade away
Your weak souls are so tender prey
Saturates
Blackened earth consume your flesh

Flesh...
So weak pests
Hollow thoughts rest
In their empty Christian nests

Wrathcast !

Harvest moon stares at the sky
Lorn are the ones who cry
O'er the savage hills of north
Wraiths that flee the dawn

Fade away
Your weak souls are so tender prey
Saturates
Blackened earth consumes your flesh

Harvest moon
Wanes before the dawning sun
Harvest moon
The End is near I can feel it comes...
