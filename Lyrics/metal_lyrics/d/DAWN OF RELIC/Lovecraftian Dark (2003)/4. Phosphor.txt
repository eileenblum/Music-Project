Lo !
I pilgrim came from the desert
Draped in sickness, dressed in black

When the utter thunders roared young
And the heart of Valusia enshrined the dark
He was born of the whore
but was forged by wrath
And he was lusting for more

Born at Zins earthdawn
the halo of the chosen
foreshadowed the war

Promethean Phosphor

Beared the mark of hatelorn Saturn
And whispered requiems lurid to men
Natus sub Stella Polari
Mortal deva, promethian mortalis
