Wind ! fear these mad signs
Scions of the blackened soil
Fear! lay your arms over
far over this haunted ground

Fire ! hear my screams of fear
Close your womb and hold 'em in

I have feared those dreams so deadly
Every night when moon is cold
Staring through the time and reason
To Radath that lies vast and lorn

The moons watch is over
Sun tears the painting away
Seas colour the black skies
The window of madness soon veiled
