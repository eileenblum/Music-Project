Possession

Second day
Convulsions and pain
Timid Priest prays hollow words in vain
Rose hes bound to te bed
Priest " Time is running out ! "

Mother Eve stares and cries
She can feel her pain inside
somethings staring
Eves of Rose
Mirror the face of old

Rose:
"Oh, mother set me free
These waves of dark
are all I feel
oh, father let me be
I wanna die"

Priest moves to her
Looks the veiled eyes
truth he sees, God is dead
Reason escaped from his mind

He runs through the window
over the balcony to his death
Bonecrushing sound, the holy man is gone

"Oh, mother set me free
These waves of dark
are all I feel
Dear mother set me free
I wanna die, Just wanna die"
