Rain descends from sea again
aviso of arriving fall
serene evening of the human whore
Scorn by retrievers horde

Transgressors !
Masquerade
in its sickest form
Centuries as yet unclaimed
oppressed wraiths
redeem their peace

Wrath cast on Pearly gates
Chariots scream for war
Shadowed mad mountains rise
Black void o'er palace of Christ

Transgressors !
Masquerade
in its sickest form
Centuries as yet unclaimed

Planetary purification
OUR EONS DAWN
