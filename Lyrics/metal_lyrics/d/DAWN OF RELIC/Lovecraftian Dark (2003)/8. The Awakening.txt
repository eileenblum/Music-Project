They have been down so long
I can hear them singing
hear their hearts
feel their passion
feel their scars

Doors are shut
To Time and fate
It was for us us to share
This useless hate
For us to share and we failed

Black void shrouds the earth
Soil vomits the fire
And scars the seas
Doomwatchers we are
Just staring the feast

Time passes slowly by
Like a boat so old
On the morning river
Where the water is truth
and its surface Shivers
Go now the moon is waning
The Beasts are out and you're all alone
Leave now and hope for dawning
Storm draws near and you're far from home

Hear me now our time has come
All pride has been raped
To feed the light
The true fiends of Christendom
Hear me we are the dragon

The abyss, the sign
The only wine of life
The abyss, the wine
you drank and spat it out
Lifes infidel
for now there's no dawn...

They have been down so long
I can hear them singing
hear their hearts
feel their passion
feel their scars

Doors are shut
To Time and fate
It was for us us to share
This useless hate
For us to share and we failed

Go now the moon is waning
The Beasts are out and you're all alone
Leave now and hope for dawning
Storm draws near and you're far from home
