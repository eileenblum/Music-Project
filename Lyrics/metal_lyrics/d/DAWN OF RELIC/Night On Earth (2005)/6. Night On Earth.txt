So came the night
Cast it silvery light
Upon sorrowed sight
His friends lying dead
The pale moonlight
H3 was laying face to the ground
He was crying for his mother
While his guts came gushinâ out
Why? Why war had chosen him
Where is your god now that you need him?
Night on earth
We suffer on, we die here
Cradle of the human dirt
Kill yourself so you can wake up
Again the moon clang in the sky
Elsewhere the woods hid the terrible crime
From the deathcamp chambers
You could hear the children's demise
Another prey for the mentally blind
Another prey for the dissonant mind
Night on earth
We suffer on, we die here
Cradle of the human dirt
We carry on, we die here
Night on earth
We suffer on, we die here
Cradle of the human dirt
Kill yourself so you can wake up
