I dream of thee
In these dreams
You lie dead before my feet
Outside, the winter night
Cold dismal sight
As the harvest moon paints our guise
Somewhereâ¦
Somehowâ¦
In timeâ¦
Thereâs a killer on the loose
In the room of paintings
In the dead moonlight
Then I awake to this sight
Thereâs no horror no fright
Just an omen of the
Forthcoming demise
So many nights
Long pineland winters passed
So many nights
Since Iâve heard the sea of June
