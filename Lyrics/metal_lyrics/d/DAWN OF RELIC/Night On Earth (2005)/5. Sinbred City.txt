Silenceâ¦
When the night cloaks this earth
Trees hum and soil gives its birth
We are the ones of rapture ân evil within
But you might just call it sin
In this sinbred city we go
Veiled as the leper ones and filth
Death hold our hand
Guides us and controls this land
Genocide
Another must be taken tonight
Another human sacrificed into the hive
His world is growing strong
Deep below where human realm is scorn
Abhor the mortal coil
Blackened ghastly death and void
Another must be taken tonight
Another human sacrificed in the hive
Master
Sometimes they dream of thee
See your realm as it used to be
Lurid memories
From eternal billowing sea
Timeless and grim
The sunken citadel
