Through the guarded gateways
Of slumber
Past the wan-mooned abysses
Of night
Live oâer my lives without number
I have sounded all things with
My sight
I have whirled with the earth at
The dawning
When the sky was a vaporous flame
I have seen the dark universe
Yawning
Where the black planets roll
Without aim
Oh, great was the sin of my spirit
And great is the reach of its doom;

I had drifted oâer seas
Without ending
Under sinister grey-clouded skies
That the many-forked lightning is rending
That resound with hysterical cries
I have scanned the vast ivy-clad palace
I have trod its untented hall
Where the moon rising up from the valleys
Shows the tapestries things on the walls
Staring ages back
Fearbound
Please god help me
Oh, great was the sin of my spirit
And great is the reach of itâs doom
Not the pity of heaven can cheer it
Nor the respite found in the tomb
Staring ages back
Those lives I have had
Thereâs no peace for me
Fearbound
Please god help me
Oh, great was the sin of my spirit
And great its reach from its doom
Not the pity of heaven can
cheer it
Nor the respite be found in the tomb
