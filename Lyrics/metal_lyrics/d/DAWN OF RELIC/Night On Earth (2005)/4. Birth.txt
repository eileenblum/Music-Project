Drowning into the sea of vanity
Ocean drawn of mans worth
By my god and grace I am reborn
In hatred to kill again
Nature unbound
From beyond the light and dark
My birth descents
Sick delusions of the man
Behold the fall of god
I kill again
Vail eternal
Values tainted and raped
Death takes control
Nature unbound
From beyond the light and dark
My birth descents
Sick delusions of the man
Behold the fall of god
I kill again
Nature unbound
Beyond the dark and light
For those are the lost
Dreaded paths of right
