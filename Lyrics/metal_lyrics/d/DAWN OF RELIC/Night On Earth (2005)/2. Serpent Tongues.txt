Pain, the revival
Once again you burn in me
Hate, the disciple
I kill you all as I set it free
Revival!
The abyss staring me
Disciple!
The music of the damned
Revival!
I hear it calling me
Perdition!
The palace of the damned
Itâs all so clear
When I take the gun and move on
Sans pain, sans fear
Soon will end the laughter
Soon there will be tears
What is my name?
What do these serpent tongues say?
Deceitful rain
Pouring down feeding my pain
I have always been alone with thee
Your even words warm within me
What is my name?
Iâll wipe you dead
You sick fuckers are already dead
Pain, the revival
Once again you burn in me
Hate, the disciple
I kill you all as I set it free
Revival!
The abyss staring
Disciple!
The music of the damned
Revival!
I hear it calling
Perdition!
The palace of the damned
What is my name?
What do these serpent tongues say?
Deceitful rain
Pouring down feeding my pain
I have always been alone with the
Your even words warm within me

What is my name?
