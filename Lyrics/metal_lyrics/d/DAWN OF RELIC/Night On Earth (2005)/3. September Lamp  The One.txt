Black pain
Withering away
In despise arrows of time
Made pacts with pain
Youâve not seen the one
Burning in the light of rising sun
Youâve not felt like one
Life loves death
Like phantasm morning comes
This dawnâs not real
The light is cold and dim
Father death, your truth is veiled
By doubt and fear
Youâve not seen the one
Burning in the rising sun
Youâve not felt like one
Life weaves death
Like phantasm morning comes
Theyâve not seen the one
Writhing in the light of rising sun
Theyâve not felt like one
Life needs death
By dawning Iâll be goneâ¦
Youâve not seen the one
Burning in the light of rising sun
Youâve not felt like one
Life loves death

Like phantasm morning comes
