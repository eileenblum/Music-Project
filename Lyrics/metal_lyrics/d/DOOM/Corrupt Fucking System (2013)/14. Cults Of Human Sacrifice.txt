[Sam Harris speaking]

Nine million children die every year before they reach the age of five. Any god who would aloud children by the millions to suffer and die in this way, and their parents to breed them this way, either can do nothing to help, or doesnât care to.
Is therefore either impotent or evil.
Think of the parents to these children, think of the fact that most of these men and women believe in God and are praying at this moment, for their children to be spared, and their prayers will not be answered.
If something good happens to a person, it gives them bliss while praying, for he sees some positive change in his life, and weâre told itâs godâs gift. Yet when children by the tens of thousands are torn from their parents and drown, weâre told that God is [?]
The cult of human sacrifice
Given the misery that is being imposed on some helpless child at this instant, this kind of faith is obscene. Thinking this way is to think [?] or to care sufficiently of the suffering of

And if God is good and loving and just, and he wanted to guide us morally with a book, why give us a book that supports slavery. Why give us a book that [?] us to kill people for imaginary crimes such as witchcraft.

Weâre being offered a psychopathic and psychotic moral attitude. Itâs psychotic because it is completely delusional, thereâs no reason to believe, that we live in a universe ruled by an invisible monster [?]
It allows perfectly decent and sane people to believe, by the billions, what only lunatics could believe on their own.

The true horror of religion.
What are the chances, that weâre all gonna go to hell for eternity, because we havenât recognized the Koran to be the perfect lord or creator of the universe.
Please know, that this is exactly how Christianity appears to someone who has not been indoctrinated by it.
