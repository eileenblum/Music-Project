Turn the water into wine
The bullshit into truth
Blindly following the flock
Devout without the proof

I declare my own apostasy
My life, beliefs my truth
Enemy of all religions
Only me and you

Worship at your alter
Fill the collection plate
Spewing poisonous sermons
Inciting religious hate

I declare my own apostasy
My life, beliefs my truth
Enemy of all religions
Only me and you

Turn the water into wine
The bullshit into truth
Blindly following the flock
Devout without the proof

I declare my own apostasy
My life, beliefs my truth
Enemy of all religions
Only me and you
