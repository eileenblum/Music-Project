Youâre not my friend, just someone I met
A twist of fate, I sorely regret

Now all is done, it canât be unsaid
Iâve come to the conclusion, youâre better off dead

Youâve made a mistake, got rid of you and me
An opinion engulfed, consumed my enemy [?]

Now all is done, it canât be unsaid
Iâve come to the conclusion, youâre better off dead

Claiming to be genuine
Hide behind your mask
Arrogance in abundance
The damage of the past
Forever looking backwards
No thought about anyone else
Yet more empty promises
Nothingâs gonna last

Iâd rather be lonely, than have you as a friend
Itâs hard to be civil, when all you say offends

Now all is done, it canât be unsaid
Iâve come to the conclusion, youâre better off dead
