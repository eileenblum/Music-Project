[Backing vocals â Charlie Cimex]With selfish addiction you pollute
Poison-inhaled fix pursuit

Fascist imposition on our lungs we choke
On the âCounter-Cultureâsâ cancer-smoke

Yes, they still test on dogs [3x]
Yes, they still exploit you!

Tobacco companies profit from deceased
Callous vivisectors funds increase

Erroneous results perpetuate the myth
Sentient lives dispensed forthwith

Yes, they still test on dogs [3x]
Yes, they still exploit you!

Our demise wonât be jackboots
But lung disease and corporate suits

Fuck your egocentric stance
Let us breathe, give anarchy a chance!

Yes, they still test on dogs [3x]
Yes, they still exploit you!
