Suffering in silence, the shit we`re forced to take
Power grabbed by the super rich, but what do they put back?

Forced depression, social immobility
Increasingly feeding the wealthy
While suffering in silence

The taxes we are forced to pay, for a fucking royal wedding day
Monarchy worshippers wave with pride, manipulating the social divide

Forced depression, social immobility
Increasingly feeding the wealthy
While suffering in silence

Casualties of the economy, begging to our wealthy masters
Income-defence-industry, ignorant of social responsibility

Forced depression, social immobility
Increasingly feeding the wealthy
While suffering in silence
