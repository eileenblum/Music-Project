[Performed and written by Andy T, samples from âThe God Debate II: Harris vs. Craigâ]The Vatican protects the paedophile priests
Immune from prosecution
The perverts hide behind the grand facade
Of respectable institution
They pray on their knees for divine forgiveness
Prey upon a frightened child
Abuse of position, of power &amp; privilege
The fascist pontiff smiles

The imam teaches using fear &amp; violence
Behind locked mosque doors
Bullying tactics that brutalize children
The outside world ignores
They pray on their knees for divine forgiveness
Prey upon a frightened child
Abuse of position, of power &amp; privilege
The twisted prophet smiles

The clerics, the pontiffs, teachers and priests
Poisonous doctrine turns men into beasts
The beatings, the torture, the rape and abuse
Is this your godliness? Your rancid excuse?

Whatever your color, your creed or beliefs
Whoever you follow like brainwashed sheep
Whoever you worship, your imaginary friends
Will never be real, they're all just pretend

Hide behind your faith, praying for our souls
Getting off, beneath your robes, on power &amp; control
No afterlife to yearn for, no judgment to fear
Organized religion ensures that hell is here.
