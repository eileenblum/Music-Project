Back-handers, lobbying,
Broken pledges, expenses fraud

But you still vote them in?
...You STILL vote them in!
[2x]

Austerity, poverty,
Food banks, divide and conquer

But you still vote them in?
...You STILL vote them in!
[2x]

Extraordinary rendition, clandestine deaths,
Lies, illegal wars

But you still vote them in?
...You STILL vote them in!
[2x]

Protecting the rich, endless control,
Capitalist, corporate coup

But you still vote them in?
...You STILL vote them in!
[2x]
