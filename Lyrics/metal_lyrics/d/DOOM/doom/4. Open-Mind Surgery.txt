Narrowing the mind
Squeezing it dry
A frontal lobotomy
Decisions die
Moral judgment
On all we see
Divine suppression
To set us free?

Freedomâ¦ of suppression [2x]

Condemn the camera that will not lie
A biased opinion
With no compromise
Societyâs scalpel
Edits the scene
A mirror image, realityâs obscene

Freedomâ¦ of suppression [2x]
