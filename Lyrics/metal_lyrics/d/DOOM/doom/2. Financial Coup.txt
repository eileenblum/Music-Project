Democracy rest in peace
Plutonomic uneconomic control
Masses subdued, dreams of wealth
Bypass freedom with bankroll

Ruling elite greed revolution
Though an open back door
No plastic bullets or riot police
Just TV, religion and war

Fuck their plutonomy
Corporate fascist ideology [2x]

Worthless money dictatorship
Rules with a monetary fist
Repressing through product placement
Distracted we no longer resist

Filling their vaults with our misery
Untouchable gangster vermin
Parasitical scum floats to the top
Suffering of millions they determine

Fuck their plutonomy
Corporate fascist ideology [2x]

Greed infected privileged few
Wield their financial drivel
Capitalist stranglehold
Steals control from the people

Fuck their plutonomy
Corporate fascist ideology [4x]
