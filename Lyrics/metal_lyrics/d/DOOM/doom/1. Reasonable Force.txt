[Lyrics by Wayne]

Remember be careful what you say under your breath
The world in a sentence can sentence you to death
Freedom of speech does not exist
The pen is far weaker than the truncheon or fist

Big brother will always be watching you
Don't incriminate yourself with what you say or do
We live in time when constantly watched
Curfews on the mind, freedom is lost

Police patrols around every block
People detached society locked
Social contact through computers at home
Welcome to the future we're are all alone

Big brother will always be watching you
Don't incriminate yourself with what you say or do
We live in time when constantly watched
Curfews on the mind, freedom is lost

International use of excessive force
Powerless minorities young and poor
Vicious beatings in custody
Fascist control of society
Widespread use of state terrorism
Voiced opinions mean time in prison
Psychological intimidation/restricted silence
Victimized by police violence

You've nothing to fear if you've nothing to hide
Guilty of everything without standing trial
Regulated restriction of peace
Nothing to say to their freedom of speech

Big brother will always be watching you
Don't incriminate yourself with what you say or do
We live in time when constantly watched
Curfews on the mind, freedom is lost
