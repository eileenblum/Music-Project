despise this society
lies in atrocity
I hate reality
suffer normality
Need to remove my self
Fuck their beautiful safety,
I wanna drop out
FUCKING DROP OUT!!!
DROP OUT!

Judge my attitude
And the clothes i wear
Show the ignorant
I don't wanna fit in
I don't wanna be like them
Don't wanna be like you.
Just another piece of shit
And nothing inside his head
I wanna be free at least inside my mind,
I wanna be free at least inside my mind.
I wanna be free...
I've gotta be free.
DROP OUT!
DROP OUT!
DROP OUT!

I see em...
Crawling forward,
Crawling forward to a new utopia,
Crawling forward everyday
Crawling forward everyday...
They don't realize
They'll go to fucking hell
they go to fucking hell...
THEY GO TO FUCKING HELL
And all the good with them.

DROP OUT!!!!!!!!!

See the faces of people
Standing in a lie
See the faces, hear the voices
Standing in a lie..

Drop out... drop out... drop out..
