Hate breeding like fear
Destroying my soul
Consuming my mind
You burnt all my dreams
Put me in chains
Forever enslaved

Dig your grave! Dig your grave!
Born to die a systems slave!

I walk in my sleep
Dreaming of days
Better than this
You call me insane
Rip up my brain
As I watch life die

Dig your Grave! Dig your grave!
Born to die a systems slave!

Hate breeding like fear
Destroying my soul
Consuming my mind
You burnt all my dreams
Put me in chains
Forever enslaved

Dig your Grave! Dig your grave!
Born to die a systems slave!
Dig your Grave! Dig your grave!
Born to die a systems slave!
