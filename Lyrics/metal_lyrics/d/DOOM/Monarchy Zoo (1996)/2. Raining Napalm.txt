As napalm falls from the sky
Mothers and children scream
As their hair burns from their scalps
To fulfil the american dream

The innocent continue to suffer

A man stands crying at the foot
Of his wifes broken corpse
But it's blood not fucking tears
Streaming from his eyes

The innocent continue to suffer
