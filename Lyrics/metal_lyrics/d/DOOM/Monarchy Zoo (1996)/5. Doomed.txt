Forced live lives
We don't want to lead
Abiding by rules
Living on our knees

Doomed

Gagged and bound by conformity
Forced into line by this society
Restricted by rules we're made to comply
Never allowed to ask reasons why
Information gained is denied to us
'Cos knowledge is power and power corrupts

Blinded by system lies
Mass produced lobotomised
