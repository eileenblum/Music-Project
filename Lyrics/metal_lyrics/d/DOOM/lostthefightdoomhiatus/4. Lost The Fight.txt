INSTANT DEATH, DIMINUTIVE PAIN, AS PROJECTILE ENTERS INTO THE BRAIN.
SHATTERED BONE â TERMINATE, NERVOUS TISSUE â EXTIRPATE

LOST THE FIGHT
LOST THE FIGHT

ERUPTION OF GRAY MATTER, ABRUPT, COMPLETE, NOTHING âAFTERâ
LIFELESS, CALM &amp; STILL, ABSOLUTE WAY TO KILL

LOST THE FIGHT
LOST THE FIGHT

CONTINUOUS, RED &amp; BLOODY, FLOWS FROM NASAL CAVITY.
VACANT EYES, EMPTY STARE, CONCLUDING THOUGHT â FINAL NIGHTMARE

[SOLO]

DISCONTINUED LIFE, BRAIN â DEAD, FATAL SHOT TO THE HEAD. SANGUINARY, REPULSIVE SIGHT, FAILED EXISTENCE, LOST THE FIGHT

LOST THE FIGHT
LOST THE FIGHT TO LIVE
