Will this world change? No it wonât
Because the world is dying as we all stare

Days go by, days go by
Nothing changes, people die

Every day weâre getting deeper
Must shout louder and show we care

Days go by, days go by
Nothing changes, people die

Will this world change? No it wonât
Because the world is dying as we all stare

Days go by, days go by
Nothing changes, people die

[Solo]

Every day weâre getting deeper
Must shout louder and show we care

Days go by, days go by
Nothing changes, people die
