A Soldierâs âmurderedâ, a terrorist âkilledâ, the bloodshed continues
But what for?

Troops out NOW, Troops out NOW

Freedom for the Irish people, end the terrorism

Troops out NOW, Troops out NOW

A Soldierâs âmurderedâ, a terrorist âkilledâ, the bloodshed continues
But what for?

Troops out NOW, Troops out NOW!
