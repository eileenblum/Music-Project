I know sometimes Iâm a hypocrite,
Things I say amount to shit,
But bear with me and what goes on
I'll bear with you, let's see what can be done

Agree to differ at certain points
Our end's the same so let's not fight
Solutions vary, and that's O.K.
Together let's find a peaceful way

Sometimes disheartened, I feel alone
Things inside, they don't get shown
It's hard to shake off what I've been taught
But bare with me, we can still talk

Agree to differ at certain points
Our end's the same so let's not fight
Solutions vary, and that's O.K.
Together let's find a peaceful way

What's inside I've got to change
Maybe you feel the same
What I've said maybe makes no sense
But if it doesâ¦ thereâs still a chance

Agree to differ at certain points
Our end's the same so let's not fight
Solutions vary, and that's okay
Together let's find a peaceful way

Togetherâ¦ a peaceful way
Togetherâ¦ a peaceful wayâ¦
A peaceful wayâ¦
A peaceful wayâ¦
A peaceful wayâ¦
