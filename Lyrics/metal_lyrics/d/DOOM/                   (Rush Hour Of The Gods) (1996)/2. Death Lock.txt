UNABLE TO EXPRESS WHATâS DEEP INSIDE
IâM ALONE IN A VACUUM, HOLLOW MIND
YOU DONâT UNDERSTAND A WORD I SAY
COS IT DOESNâT MAKE SENSE ANYWAY

DEATHLOCK

FREEDOM OF THOUGHT IS PARAMOUNT
WITHOUT THIS THERE IS ONLY DOUBT
DONâT TRUST SYSTEMS THAT THRIVE ON CONTROL
USED, ABUSED AND DISCARDED WHOLE

DEATHLOCK

UNABLE TO EXPRESS WHATâS DEEP INSIDE
IâM ALONE IN A VACUUM, HOLLOW MIND
YOU DONâT UNDERSTAND A WORD I SAY
COS IT DOESNâT MAKE SENSE ANYWAY

(Expressing oneâs real thoughts is near impossible. Itâs much easier to say nothing. On a wider level, itâs easier to exist in this society without challenging it. The result of this is to be enslaved. Enslaved by systems of rule or by oneâs own mind, is this life?)
