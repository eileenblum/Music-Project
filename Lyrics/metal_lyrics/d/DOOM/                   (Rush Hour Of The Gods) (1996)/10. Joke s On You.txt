(While the âX-filesâ is supposedly aimed at those who have jumped on the âconspiracyâ bandwagon, the show is owned by the Fox network (part of the News International corporation), a massive right wing multinational which is in the pocket of Rupert Murdochâs somewhat oversized trousers!
Those who believe that the âX-filesâ to be truth is the equivalent of buying a veggie burger from McDonalds. The truth is not out there, itâs under your fucking nose)
