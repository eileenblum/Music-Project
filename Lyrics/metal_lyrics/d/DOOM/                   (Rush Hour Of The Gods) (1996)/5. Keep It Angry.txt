PRETTY PEOPLE WITH SMILING FACES
DANCING HAPPY BASKET CASES

ECSTATIC NOT TO COMPREHEND
DEPRESSION THAT WILL NEVER END

DISTANCED FROM THE FLUFFY SCENE

JUST TOO ANGRY, TO BE SERENE

PAINTED, COLORFUL AND BRIGHT
PASSIVE RESISTANCE FOR A NIGHT

POPPED A PILL OF MISERY
BACK TO GREY REALITY

DISTANCED FROM THE FLUFFY SCENE

JUST TOO ANGRY, TO BE SERENE

HALLUCINATE, TO ESCAPE
FEELING HAPPY, FEELING GREAT
NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS
STILL ALONE, STILL DEPRESSED
PRETTY PEOPLE WITH SMILING FACES
DANCING HAPPY BASKET CASES

ECSTATIC NOT TO COMPREHEND
DEPRESSION THAT WILL NEVER END

DISTANCED FROM THE FLUFFY SCENE

JUST TOO ANGRY, TO BE SERENE

(Anti rave â NO
Anti drugs â NO
âKeep it fluffyâ â Fuck off!
Peaceful protest â Fuck off!
The only way to fight power is with power
Escapism is fine, it keeps us sane)
