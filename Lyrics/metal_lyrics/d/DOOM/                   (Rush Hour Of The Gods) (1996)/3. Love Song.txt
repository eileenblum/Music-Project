SURVIVING IN DOUBT, UNWILLING TO TRUST
DISTANT BUT SAFE, VERACIOUSNESS CRUSHED
UNABLE TO FORGET, REAFFIRM SELF RESPECT
DISILLUSIONED THROUGH EXPERIENCE, PERPETUALLY SUSPECT

CANNOT LOVE YOU
UNTIL I CAN LOVE ME

LOVE IS UNAVAILABLE
FEELINGS ARE UNSTABLE
EGOS ARE CONTROLLED
EMOTIONS REMAIN UNRESOLVED
[3x]

DESTRUCTION OF DECEPTION
REFUSAL TO BE USED
ASSERT ONLY IMPORTANCE
FEELINGS NOT CONFUSED
BLACKMAILED BY EMOTIONS
CONTAINED WITHIN MONOGAMY
LOVING TURNS TO HATING
LIVING FOR ONEâS SELF, LOVING FREE

CANNOT LOVE YOU
UNTIL I CAN LOVE ME

(Itâs time to put oneself first (No. 1) in order to protect oneself from being hurt. Avoiding serious emotional relationships in order not to hurt anyone else. Unable to trust others, unable to trust oneself.)
