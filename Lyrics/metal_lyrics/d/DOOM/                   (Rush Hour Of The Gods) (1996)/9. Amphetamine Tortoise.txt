AT THE COREâ¦ OF THE SITTING
OGLE THEâ¦ OLD MAN SHIFTING

AMPHETAMINE TORTOISE
FAST LANE LIVING

AMPHETAMINE TORTOISE
BUTTONS WRONG
ITâS FAR TOO STRONGâ¦ FAR TOO STRONG

AMPHETAMINE TORTOISE
FAST LANE LIVING

[Solo]

SPEED IT UPâ¦ ITâS FAR TOO SLOW
BURN IT DOWNâ¦ WATCH IT GROW
AMPHETAMINE TORTOISE
FAST LANE LIVING
