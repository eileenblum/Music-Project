ASSUMING WE SHARE A VIEW
IT WILL NEVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT THE SAME
AS THOSE INSIDE YOUR TINY BRAIN

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK,
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK,
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

OPENLY YOU SPEAK YOUR MIND
YOUR VIEWS ARE THOSE WHICH I DESPISE
YET YOU ASSUME THAT I AGREE
WITH ALL YOUR HATE, HATE AND BIGOTRY

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK,
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK,
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

LIVE YOUR LIFE IN IGNORANCE
TALK TO ME WITH ARROGANCE
SICK OF YOUR IMPUDENT DRONE
GO AWAY (AND) LEAVE ME ALONE!

IF YOU STILL THINK YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME TICK
THEN YOUâRE FUCKING MISTAKEN
SO FUCKING MISTAKEN
SO FUCKING MISTAKEN
SO FUCKING MISTAKEN
SO FUCKING MISTAKEN

(This happens to me all the time and it really pisses me off! Why is it that when the majority of white males talk to me (a white male), they assume Iâm racist, sexist and homophobic?)
