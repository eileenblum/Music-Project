LOOK TO SEE WHERE YOU'VE BEEN FROM STANDING AT THE START AGAIN
TRY TO KEEP WHAT YOU'VE GOT, EVEN IF IT'S NOT A LOT
STAND UP BACKWARDS, THAT'S A FACT, WHO'S GONNA FOLLOW YOUR ATTACK,

EVERYDAY PEOPLE DIE AND STARVE BUT NOT YOU,
CRAZY, MIXED UP, SCREWED UP, ITS ALL FALLING APART REAL FAST
THE NEXT THING YOU HEAR MIGHT BE AN ATOMIC BLAST
THIS THING CALLED PROGRESS MAKES ME SICK.

BUSINESSMEN, POLITICIANS, GOVERNMENT, STACKS IT UP,
IT'S VITAL, PUNKS, RADICALS, TEAR IT DOWN,
LOOK TO SEE WHERE WEâVE BEEN FROM STANDING AT THE START AGAIN
DON'T BELIEVE WHAT YOU READ,
CRAZY, MIXED UP, SCREWED UP; ITâS FALLING APART REAL FAST
HAVE FUN THIS TIME AROUND BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE THE LAST
THIS THING CALLED PROGRESS MAKES ME SICK
