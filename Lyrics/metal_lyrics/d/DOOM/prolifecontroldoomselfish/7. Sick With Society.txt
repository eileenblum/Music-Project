WOUNDED BY DECEIT
AND BLINDED BY LIES
CRUSHED BY DISAPPOINTMENT
INJURED PRIDE
BURNING WITH ANGER
AND CRIPPLED BY APATHY
WOUNDED BY DESPAIR
IâM SO SICK WITH SOCIETY

SO SICK WITH SOCIETY
IâM SO FUCKING SICK!
I CANT STAND SOCIETY
NO

IâM SO FUCKING SICK
SO FUCKING SICK
I AM FUCKING SICK
SO FUCKING SICK
OF THIS SOCIETY

FUCKED UP BY FRIENDS
AND MAIMED BY CRUELTY
SICKENED BY SIGHTS
AND MY SHATTERED DREAMS
DISABLED BY RULES
PARALYZING FEAR
CONSUMED BY HATE
IâM SO SICK WITH SOCIETY

SO SICK WITH SOCIETY
IâM SO FUCKING SICK!
I AM SICK WITH SOCIETY
IâM SO FUCKING SICK
SO FUCKING SICK
I HATE SOCIETY
SO FUCKING SICK
SO FUCKING SICK
IâM SICK WITH SOCIETY
