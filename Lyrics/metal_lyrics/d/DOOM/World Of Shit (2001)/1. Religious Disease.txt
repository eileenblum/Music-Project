Caught in the front seat of a car
One step wrong will leave aching scars
White shoe made a noise when she tripped
Amir Bil Marui is cracking the whip
An Islam sexist nation,
Talibanâs creations

Forced in all weathers to be covered in a veil
Not even allowed to leave home without a male
Oppressed and controlled by religious police
They call it a religion, I call it a disease
An Islam sexist nation,
Talibanâs creations

[Solo]

Caught in the front seat of a car
One step wrong will leave aching scars
White shoe made a noise when she tripped
Amir Bil Marui is cracking the whip
An Islam sexist nation,
Talibanâs creations
