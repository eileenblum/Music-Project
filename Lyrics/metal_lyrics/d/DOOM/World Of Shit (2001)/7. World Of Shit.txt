In your world of shit
My brain wonât fit
Your idiocy has squeezed it dry

World of shit
You look at me like Iâm a freak
I look at you and it makes me sick
It makes me wantâ¦ to curl up and die
World of shit
I hate your ways
and your pathetic gaze
You stupidity
is blatant with no disguise

[Solo]

World of shit
Youâre happy to exist
I naturally resist
In a world of shit
Until we fucking die
World of shit
