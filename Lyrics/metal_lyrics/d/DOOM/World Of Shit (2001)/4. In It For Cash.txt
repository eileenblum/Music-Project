I still fucking hate you
The wounds still feel new
Memories tainted by you
In it for the cash
Canât believe, canât forget
No real friends
Just people to use
In it for the cash
In it for life?
All you can get
Why donât you fuck off, so I can forget
In it for the cash

[No available lyrics for this verse]

In it for the cash
