No let up
From the moment I get up
Canât smell the coffee
âcos thereâs somewhere else Iâve gotta be
Full on
Gotta get this done
Not enough hours
to stop and smell the flowers
Need a pause
Feet ainât touching floors
Fit to drop
Need to stop
Slacken the pace
A mere hours grace
Leave me alone
Get the fuck-out my face
Running
Just to stand still
Burning out
Feeling so fucking ill

Need a pause
Feet ainât touching floors
Fit to drop
Need to stop
It just makes me want to rip out the phone
Draw all the curtains
Pretend Iâm not at home
Donât want to talk
to you anymore
Fuck it! Just want to nail up my door
Daily grind
Grinding me down
Miserable
Permanently frown
Time to reflect
On the good things in life
Not a drone working flat-out
In this hive we call life

Need a pause
Feet ainât touching floors
Fit to drop
Need to stop
It donât mean that Iâm saying
I want nothing to do
Just a break from the madness
For a moment or two
