Unsustainable resources
Something has to give
6 billion people
Scramble for their bit
Wars fought for water
as rivers are sucked dry
Ice caps are retreating
Ocean levels rise
Developing â3rd worldâ countries
Commit â1st worldâ mistakes
Greed produces blunders
Annihilation continues apace
Wars fought for water
as rivers are sucked dry
Ice caps are retreating
Ocean levels rise

Itâs turned into a free-for-all
Someoneâs got to pay
Use it all up now
Nothing left for the future
Wars fought for water
as rivers are sucked dry
Ice caps are retreating
Ocean levels rise
