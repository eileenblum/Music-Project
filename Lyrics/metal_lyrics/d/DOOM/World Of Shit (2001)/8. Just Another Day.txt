Another day
The world didnât end
Jesus appear
or aliens descend
Itâs just another day down here
In this prison reality
Consuming our lives away
Until the day we die
If I exist
Guilty am I
[?] depression
[?] time
Itâs just another day down here
In this prison reality
Consuming our lives away
Until the day we die
The sickness is everywhere
Another day of torture 2000 AD?
Our lives are wasting away
Will we ever be free?
Itâs just another day down here
In this prison reality
Consuming our lives away
Until the day we die

Reach for the sky, but nothing is there
Weâve poisoned our lives
The sickness is everywhere
Itâs just another day down here
In this prison reality
Consuming our lives away
Until the day we die
The sickness is everywhere
Reach for the sky, but nothing is there
Weâve poisoned our lives
The sickness is everywhere
The sickness is everywhere
