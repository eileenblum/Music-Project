Pinochet and Maggie, sit down for tea
Politiciansâ colours plain to see
âHe helped against Galtieri,
we should respect him and set him freeâ
Should have saved some money
And strung the fucker up
Done the world a favor
And sent him home, home in a box
âHeâs old and frail, leave him beâ
Tell that to the victimsâ families
Tortured people of Chile
Hiding behind immunity
Should have saved some money
And strung the fucker up
Done the world a favor
And sent him home, home in a box
Oppression and fear with an iron fist
Slow death for him (would be) a slap on the wrist
Torture and death, the tools of his trade
Death squads, torture keep people afraid
Should have saved some money
And strung the fucker up
Done the world a favor
And sent him home, home in a box
