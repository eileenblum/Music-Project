SITTING ISOLATED WITH âFRIENDSâ I DO NOT KNOW
AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE SOCIAL FLOW
ATTEMPTS TO BE ACCEPTED ARE FUTILE &amp; LAME
SOCIALLY DISABLED, REFUSE TO PLAY THE GAME

ANTISOCIAL
[4x]

FAKING CONVERSATION, FEELING DISTANCED &amp; REMOTE
ATTEMPTS OF INTERACTION FAIL WITHOUT A HOPE
ACCEPTANCE FADES AWAY, NO COMMON GROUND IN SIGHT
FOREVER OUT OF PLACE, GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT

ANTISOCIAL
[4x]

IâLL NEVER BE A PART OF IT
FOREVER BE APART FROM IT

ALWAYS ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING TO FIT IN
ANTI ACCEPTANCE, TO BE DIFFERENT IS A âSINâ
SOCIALLY CORNERED, TRAPPED WITHOUT A CHOICE
MANIPULATED BY PEOPLE PRESSURE, YOU HAVE NO VOICE
NO FUCKING VOICE

ANTISOCIAL
[4x]

IâLL NEVER BE A PART OF IT
FOREVER BE APART FROM IT

(Sometimes, when you think you know who your friends are, &amp; you finally think you âfit inâ somewhere, you realize you have absolutely nothing in common with them except for token shit that doesnât mean a thing. Believe in yourself. Donât conform)
