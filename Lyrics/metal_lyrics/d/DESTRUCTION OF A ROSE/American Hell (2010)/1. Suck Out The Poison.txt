You said you loved me,
I should of seen it coming.
Once bitten the only option is to suck out the poison.
You continue to cast your cloud over me,
As if you had a hold on me, you lost me now forget me.
I hope you understand the permanent damage you've caused,
You'll never get ahead having no respect for yourself.
Have you ever wanted to die?
I have, and If I did not a fucking thing would change
You'd still be here to lower the human morale.
