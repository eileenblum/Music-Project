I've kissed a vulture. Where did I go wrong?
Flew and it flew around my head til I was gone,
Slowly sucking the marrow from my bones,
Stomping the beat in my heart,
Scrapping across the desert floor it dives
And pulls me apart, In the distance.
See my oasis. Only to find it was in my head.
My weary fucking head. I stand up and try to walk away.
The Vulture arrives, seems I've got hell to pay.
They can feel me dying, smell me rotting,
Dive and they dive, tearing at my soul, until
I've wasted away to nothing. I feel nothing.
