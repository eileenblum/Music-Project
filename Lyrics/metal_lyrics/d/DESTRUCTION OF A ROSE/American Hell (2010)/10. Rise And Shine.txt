Devoruing consciousness,
Digesting power, monster of energy.
Stare it in the eyes, this will be the rise of you and I.
Rise and Shine, my heart is pounding out of my chest,
Don't know when I'll be able to close my eyes.
How could you have such a hold on so many?
Taken lives, wasted mine, yet still you thrive?
Dilated eyes, long mornings and nights, sometimes
I can't believe I'm still alive.
I would have killed to smell you one more time,
To take the pain away, to keep me awake for one more day.
