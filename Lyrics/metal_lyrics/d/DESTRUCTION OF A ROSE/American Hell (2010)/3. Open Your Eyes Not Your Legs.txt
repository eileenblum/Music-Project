Open your eyes, not your legs!
I awoke to clothes thrown everywhere,
And and a whore to my right could it be more clear
We made a fuckin mess last night?
Ass in the air, face in the sheets,
Ass in the air, with your face in the sheets.
Could it be more clear we made a fuckin mess,
A fucking mess of last night? A night with a cause.
A night without a promise.
You grabbed me by the hand and kissed my neck,
I knew from then I had you wrapped.
6 shots of whiskey down the hatch,
Witch one of you girls will be the next to show no class?
