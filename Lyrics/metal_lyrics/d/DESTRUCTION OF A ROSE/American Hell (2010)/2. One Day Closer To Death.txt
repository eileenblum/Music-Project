Every day is one closer to death
Am I lost? Am I crazy? Is this just my reality?
What is life without chaos?
I have returned to a new state of mind,
A new state of existence.
Take that last thought in, when twilight hits,
When everything means nothing. Every man dies.
But few men live.
When will it be our turn,
Our turn to rise, we're falling to our demise,
When fear arises, jump in the fire, let it burn.
