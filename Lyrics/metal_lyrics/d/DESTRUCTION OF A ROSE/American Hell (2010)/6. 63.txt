Pages burned and pages turned.
But nothing will bring back the pages we never wrote. [x2]
(What tragedy has stolen from me)

The price I pay for being away,
Will forever be embedded in my memory.
Fight and I fight asking why,
Fall to my knees, fists to the ground,
Suddenly I'm safe and sound.

I scream it to the heavens as a dear friend dies,
Just above my tears, they bleed from the skies.
So many nights have been carried away,
But one will forever remain.

My Brother, you will never be forgotten,
My heart holds all the pain.
In our time, we were supreme,
And so the legacy shall reign.

This is not goodbye, diamonds are forever.
We will shine on. [x2]

Pages burned and pages turned.
But nothing will bring back the pages we never wrote. [x2]

Valhalla will accept you with wide open arms,
Where you will eternally be right where you belong.

This is not goodbye, diamonds are forever.
We will shine on. [x2]

Only the good die young. (Only the good die young.) [x2]
