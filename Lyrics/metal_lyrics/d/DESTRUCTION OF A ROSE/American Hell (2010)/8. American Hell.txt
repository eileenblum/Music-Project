If you want life, you must keep the search alive.
Rip open the plastic at it seems,
And find the blackest heart you've seen,
Check the mirror one more time, how can you sleep at night?
This city will burn it self to the ground,
Rip open the plastic at its seems,
And reveal the blackest heart you've ever seen.
What's it like to live in a world where nothings real?
There are holes in the surface,
Blacked out and withered down, city under fire.
