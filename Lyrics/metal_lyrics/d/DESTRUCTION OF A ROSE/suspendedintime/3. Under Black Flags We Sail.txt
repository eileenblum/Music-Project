Nothing I have done is ever good enough for you.
In this moment, I am suspended in time.
Rotting from the inside out.
These blackened waves encompass us. (Encompass us)
Crushing through our bones. (They encompass us, crushing through our bones)
Trying to keep afloat, raise your head now and Don't choke.
(Pressing forward, I will not perish)
We are beginning to shine. Radiate through black skies.
(Pressing forward I will not perish)
These blackened waves encompass all of us...
With every glance you set my skin ablaze.
With every glance I'm set ablaze.
