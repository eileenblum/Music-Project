I can take anything that comes my direction.
I will crush you all.
Take a knee, and bow to defeat and watch me repeat.
Take a knee and bow to defeat. OH!
What will be your salvation when everything is gone?

[Bridge]
Hell has arisen as I raise my fist. My orders to the masses.
Leave no stone unturned; No one alive.
Steal every breath from their lungs 'til only we survive.

When the blood in your veins is as cold as mine.
Nothing really seems, seems to matter but, but the cries of the dying.

As my brothers and sisters die to keep your palace standing high.
It shall be by my hand that it falls to the ground.
It shall be by my hand that it all falls, to the ground.
