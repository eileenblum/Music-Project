Oh god save the queen or she has fallen into the depths of my dreams.
My cell has taken everything she holds dear. 
Taken everything that she holds dear.
This will be your darkest hour.
I'm your Christ and I want you. Slither in your dreams eat your soul.
Our co-existence is inevitable. With death by her side, there is no hope.
Only hunger and pain.
Oh how the ripened throat of the chosen beauty must taste.
Quench my thirst with the blood of the femme fatale.
