We own the night. I'm wrapped inside this jacket.
I'm climbing up these padded walls.
Will this never ending calamity take over me, take over me.
I've been staring into these diamond eyes for so long, for so long.
I don't know the line between wrong and right (wrong and right).
I've been staring into these.. bridge-diamond, diamond eyes.
I can't tell the lies between wrong and right. He whispers in my ear.
Here my dear take one sip of hell and die you shall right here.
He has spoken word of death unto me, but die I shall not.
I'll bring the pain to them all that have accused me of his fall.

[Outro]
We own the night.
