I'll never forget what happened that night.
You hid everything from me, now you'll have to pay.
I'll never forget what happened that night. It haunts me to this day.
You hid everything from me, now you'll have to pay.
One more time with your black malicious lies. It should be the end.
I'll draw the line and if it's crossed. I swear your next breath will be your last.
Now that the weight of the world is off my back. I can finally rise to the top.
You've turned your back, i'll turn you inside out.
Feed what you call heart, to the depths of the sea.
This is a circle of endlessness. Life is pain, death is pain.
It's in my hands.
Will I dance with the devil, or fly with the angels?
