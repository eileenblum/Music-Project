Oh grand thunders in the darkest night
Wake her up from eternal sleep
Dark Empress is rise in the night
And guides me to the moon empire

Your secrets are the magic of the night
Between the whispers of the lost soul
Your eyes are fire shining in darkness
You are beast of Satan, the most powerful creation

Dark Empress seduce me
I desire to sleep eternally

Dark empress open the gates of hell
I give you the blood
Of children in your hands
Take my soul, fill it with hate
And baptize me in blasphemies

She is Dark Empress, her name is Ereshkigal!

Oh Ereshkigal
You have triumphed over your sister Isthart
Oh Ereshkigal
You're mother of earth, mother of Irkalla

The Anu's daughter returns from hell...

The dark forest is her empire
Her ghost walks into the night
In the darkness of this ritual
Finally hear her mystic call

You pertain to the other side of portal
Your presence will be forever immortal
