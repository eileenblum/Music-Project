Welcome Satan to my world!

Damned for cosmic forces
One day I become a storm
I reborn from the Hell
To destroy Heaven
And everything will disappear

The orders of Satan
Lives in my mind
And I only think
About getting revenge in twilight

Now I am a beast,
Only full of real hate

The honor to be your son
Father!

My soul is thy sword
My hands are thy steels
You will live inside of me
Forever...

The call to war live!

Christianism defeated
It is my triumph
In the paradise of Satan
Await my future throne

Oh master!

The true servants
Fight for your realm! Oh master!
In the final battle
You will give me eternal life
Father...

Into the fog and silence
Night cover my face
Beyond the moon is shine
My soul pursues to Satan

Now the world is darkness
The realm of my master

Reverences to thy master
Christian inclines your heads
Christianity is dying
My father conquers your world

Reverences to thy master
Christian inclines your heads
Christianity is dying

My father conquers your world...
