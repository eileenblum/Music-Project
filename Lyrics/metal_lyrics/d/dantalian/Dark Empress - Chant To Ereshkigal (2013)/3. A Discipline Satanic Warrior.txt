Ancient remembrances
Tortures my soul
And fill me of hate
And become me into a wolf
Son of the moon and fire
Baptized by the same evil
As warrior of the hell,
fight for your name

My soul is searching for fresh blood
In the name of Satan is my sacrifice
Slave's consciences of Christ
To him my eternal father Satan

Oh master Satanas!

King among Kings
The most powerful creation
Your power is our evil
Thy name is Lucifer

The black disciplines are my rules
The teaching of my master
My way of life, my great pride

A discipline satanic warrior!

I summon the beast
Who lives among humans
The true feelings
The darkness of their spirits

A discipline satanic warrior, I am!
