666 hymns in your name Satan
The demons are singing tonight
Dancing around the flames
While the Christians are dying in pain

Oh grate Satan

The horns are sounding again
Showing red clouds
Full of angel's blood
Flagellated by flames

Come on Satan

Your real sons awaiting for you
Our dreams reveal that you'll return
When heaven finally burnsâ¦

Darkness is silence
Darkness is your throne
Oh grate Satan, lord of evil
Oh infernal conqueror.
