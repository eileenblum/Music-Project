I feel that now it is inside my brainDon't know why but it makes me insaneSomething evil has now entered my lifeDon't know why but it cuts like a knife Agony inside my mindNow will go on and kill you Don't visit the chainsThey are not to blameIt's just a reliefFor this pain all the timeDon't talk to my parentsThey don't even knowI'm here aloneIn my torture roomOoh I try to run but it's too late to escapeI'm hearing voices I can never explainTheir rules bother me though they are my idolsI have to follow though it makes me suffer Could be if I let it out nowIt can come straight into you Don't visit the chainsThey are not to blameIt's just a reliefFor this pain all the timeDon't talk to my parentsThey don't even knowI'm here aloneIn my torture roomOoh
