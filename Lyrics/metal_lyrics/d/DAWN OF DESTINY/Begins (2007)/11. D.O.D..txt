In a time not far away
Where all is destined to decay
Heaven still knows the crime
It won't be washed away by time

What once was green all turned to grey
There will be someone left to pay
A cloud of dust darkens the sky
The ones left ... afraid to die

[Chorus:]
But there will come a time for vengeance
Dawn of destiny begins
They will regret all their sins
Dawn of destiny begins

Is life still the way it used to be?
Is there a chance for eternity?
All the evil tries to hide in the mist
But then it comes with an iron fist

[Chorus:]
But there will come a time for vengeance
Dawn of destiny begins
They will regret all their sins
Dawn of destiny begins

Someone destroyed
all we believed in
They'll die
Someone has changed
our destiny

So many screams they can be heard at night

[Chorus 2x:]
But there will come a time for vengeance
Dawn of destiny begins
They will regret all their sins
Dawn of destiny begins

God will send some troops to earth
And they will just destroy all evil
Those angels will have no mercy
And take them all into hell

This is the dawn of destiny
This is the dawn of destiny
