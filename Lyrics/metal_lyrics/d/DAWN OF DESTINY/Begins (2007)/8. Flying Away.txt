It sounds like ironySomeone said give peace a chanceHistory has shown that it isA foreign word OhIs it a way to save this worldTo stop the Earth from burstingSix billion people seems to be too much NOThis will only hasten judgment day I'm awake at nightAnd saw the need to fightAnd the helping hand is so far out of sightWe need to fly awayThis is no place to stayFor we know now that the evil's gone away It works like a dominoIf someone falls, they all will followWhen someone rulesThey all obey OhWith every war, with every diseaseMaybe we're just trying to surviveMaybe this is the way that we'll GOThis is not the way it's meant to be I'm awake at nightAnd saw the need to fightAnd the helping hand is so far out of sightWe need to fly awayThis is no place to stayFor we know now that the evil's gone awayI'm awake at nightAnd saw the need to fightAnd the helping hand is so far out of sight OhIs it a way to save this worldTo stop the Earth from burstingSix billion people seems to be too much NOThis will only hasten judgment day I'm awake at nightAnd saw the need to fightAnd the helping hand is so far out of sightWe need to fly awayThis is no place to stayFor we know now that the evil's gone awayI'm awake at nightAnd saw the need to fightAnd the helping hand is so far out of sightWe need to fly awayThis is no place to stayFor we know now that the evil's gone awayHEY!
