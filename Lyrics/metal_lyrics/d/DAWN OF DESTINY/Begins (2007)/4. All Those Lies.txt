History reapeats itself
It all comes back again
Leaders and preachers
Believers and decievers
Fanatically leading, Blindy following
Apparently prayers make no sense
Maybe they are not (so) intense
The bigger the power
The more is madness
Fanatically leading, Blindly following

[Chorus:]
And they still tell us all those lies
And they don't care that someone dies
Will the world end up in devastasion?
All we can do is pray

Religious hate seals someone's fate
Heaven is promised for suicide
Does not matter who also died
It seems that all the angels have disappeared
We are left on our own
Its seems that purgatory is coming near
Do we believe in a God?
Is there a sense for us to live if we destroy?
Seems like nothing remains
Fanatically leading, Blindly following

[Chorus x2]

They will prepare for another holy war
They will prepare for nuclear attacks
They will prepare for judgement day to come
They will prepare for the end of all our days

Still they tell lies
Don't care that someone dies
The world ends up in devastation
Still they tell lies
Don't care that someone dies
Or do we hope and pray for salvation?
Lies... they tell us lies
Lies... they tell us lies
