And the night went on
While all the stars are gone
Another night all on her own

Those innocent eyes
Won't ever tell any lies
Who will ease this misery?

They will come again and touch me
They will pay for satisfaction

[Chorus:]
Everyday I'm waiting for someone I don't know
Everyday I'm waiting for someone who will show
That life means more than suffering
Everyday I'm waiting for a healing touch

No parents left to guard me
No idol left I'd like to be
Selling my body is now my destiny

I wonder if this circle can be broken
I wonder if I ever sleep without a cry

They will come again...

Everyday...
