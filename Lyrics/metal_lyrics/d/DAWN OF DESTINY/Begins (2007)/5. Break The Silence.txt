Near the houseAt the lake where the sun refuses to shineThe rumors sayThat something happened hereBut no one out there remembered They say a boy was killedDisappeared without a reasonAnd traces lead to this placeAnd nothing else remainedNo boy, no bloodBut there has to be a reason for this silence The door was open wideWhen someone walked toward the house at nightDo not turn aroundThey scream Has anyone dared to break the silence?Is there anyone hearing those cries?Do you see the traces of violence?Is there anyone believing all those lies? There areWhispering voices all the time (all the time)Or are theyJust fantasyDarkness surrounds Don't turn aroundThey scream Has anyone dared to break the silence?Is there anyone hearing those cries?Do you see the traces of violence?Is there anyone believing all those lies? Has anyone dared to break the silence?Is there anyone hearing those cries?Do you see the traces of violence?Is there anyone believing all those lies?Has anyone dared to break the silence?Is there anyone hearing those cries?Do you see the traces of violence?Is there anyone believing all those lies?
