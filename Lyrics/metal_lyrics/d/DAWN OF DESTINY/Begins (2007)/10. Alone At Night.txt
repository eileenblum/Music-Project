There is no trace of sorrow left
Though we never found that missing link
Many promises we haven't kept
That love at last is the only thing

When I close my eyes
I still see the smile upon your face

And then we walk alone at night
All our hopes and dreams did not survive
There is no light inside this final night
Into a world of loneliness I dive

Once there was a flame
That kept the night so bright
Every time that we've been lost
The flame has guided our way

Sending a wish to heaven
That all those memories will last

And then we walk alone at night
All our hopes and dreams did not survive
There is no light inside this final night
Into a world of loneliness I dive

Now as the dark embraces me
I'm searching for the long lost light
Still you are and will always be
A light in the dark that shines so bright
