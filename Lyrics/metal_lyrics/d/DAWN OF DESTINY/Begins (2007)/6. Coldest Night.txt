Still my eyes are open wideJust a sound that I cry tonightAgain and againAnd the sound of a breaking heartWhat once was love turned into despairNo more dreams that I'd like to shareAnother part of me has diedOne more that I've sacrificedAgain and againAnd the sound of a breaking heartDo you believe in destinyOr is it just my fantasy In this coldest night I'm all aloneCome out here in the distanceI still feel for youLove is meant to last foreverBut you proved to meI am not Did you hear my cries at nightDid you ever know my fearsWhy did you ignore the signsAnd pretend that I was fineI'm strong and I'll carry on'Til my heart feels againNo one has the right to take away my smile In this coldest night I'm all aloneCome out here in the distanceI still feel for youLove is meant to last foreverBut you proved to meIn this coldest night I'm all aloneCome out here in the distanceI still feel for youLove is meant to last foreverBut you proved to meI am not
