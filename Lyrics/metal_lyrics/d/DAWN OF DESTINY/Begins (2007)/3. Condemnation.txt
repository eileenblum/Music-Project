The sun's going down
Sweat's running down the face
Hand's covered by the blisters
And back hurts with pain

Is it weeks is it months is it years now it's here
Can't imagine feeling free there's no chance to escape

Hammers are falling sounding like thunder
Permitting sparks as far as he can see

No past and no future
No will to look back
No hope left to flee
From this place

[Chorus:]
Cries in the night cold sweat in his eyes
And nightmares recall what has been
Cries in the night flashes of memories
He hopes and he tries to forget

Just right beside him the next man hits the ground
cries in the night...
Replaced by some guardians replaced by fresh blood
They carry away now that lifeless body
That has left all this pain and horror behind

[Chorus]

Behind the barbed wired fence
Is there a life worth living?
Behind those men's cold eyes
Is there a bit of humanity left?

Hope lingers on
But everyday fails
And every man beaten down
And every will breaking

[Chorus]
