One day an angel came to earth
That day he witnessed a birth
The miracle of life before his eyes
He wonders where his own fortune lies

The angel travelled back to God
Curious he asked 'what is your plot?'
Why can't angel die? Why do they feel no pain?
I just can fly and feel the rain

There is no birth, there is no death
In heaven we live eternally
Oh why can I not be like them?

[Chorus:]
And so appears one day another fallen angel
With broken wings this angel flies onto the earth

One day the angel thought of heaven
Was it not a gift that's has been given?
To be forever and never to decay
But he knows on earth is where he likes to stay

Even though I fell from grace
Forever I will love this place

There is no birth, there is no death
In heaven we live eternally
Oh why can I not be like them?

[Chorus:]
And so appears one day another fallen angel
With broken wings this angel flies onto the earth

There is much I have to learn
There is nothing left to turn
But I am convinced
That death belongs to life

There is no birth, there is no death
In heaven we live eternally
Oh why can I not be like them?

[Chorus:]
And so appears one day another fallen angel
With broken wings this angel flies onto the earth
