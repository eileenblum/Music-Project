On a cold dark night a girl stands all alone
no one to hold her tight left to be on her own
All the time the snow came down no way to go, no road to take

A few miles later she stands by the lake
Someone freezes beside the water the face is signed by fear
The girl's overwhelmed by compassion
She can't hold back a tear

So she gives away almost all that she's got to save one's life to not drown in the flood
We're both alone won't you come with me? No, I'd rather be on my own...

Further on she walks even poorer now, thoughts rush through her mind
Why didn't he want to stay though I have saved his life

A fireplace inside the forest the fire's almost burning out
Another girls... life slowly seems to fade she cries for help she screams out loud

So she gives away almost all that she's got to save one's life not to drown in the flood
Please come with me I feel so lost no I'll return home maybe one day we'll meet...

It seems like there's no place here on earth but there has  to be a place in heaven
Out in the cold and still alone no one cares about a lonely girl
Another soul is yet to save tonight ... one more body not holding her tight
Sinking down in the snow she never wakes up again
Tomorrow might bring a better place for her
Tomorrow might bring a place in heaven

It is a world worth dying for
Just because there must be more
Somewhere in this universe
A good heart will be welcome...
