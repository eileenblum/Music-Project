I walk this lonely road
While the rain is pouring down on me
The same rain like this fatal day
I came from the doctor
My first way then like this way now
It leads to you
But this time I won't come up to you
You won't let me in

He said to me that I'd be positive
My blood is filled with this deadly virus
And now our lives go down the drain
I nearly go insane

You were my fortress, you were my life
You left me then with tears in your eyes
And still it cuts just like a knife
To see my love and life, it dies

I picked you up when you were feeling down
No one was beside you
You were left all on your own
I have accepted you the way you've been
So what about our plans? Your father's right!

My life with you - a dream until then
My love has been my savior
Nothing of this dream remains
Please don't leave me

I always believed in what we called forever
In good times and in bad times?
Though it has been short until now
Those were the best days of my life

You were my fortress, you were my life
You left me then with tears in your eyes
And still it cuts like a knife
To see my love and life, it dies

I never prayed but now I pray to you
I never wept but now I cry to you
Don't take the last breath out of me
Don't break what's almost broken
I am so afraid
I have nothing left
Fulfil my last wish
And let me die in your arms

Do you remember our holidays?
When we dreamed of three children
A house at the lake and 2 big dogs?
What is left of this dream?

Still I dream this dream with you
Will you dream this again when I'm gone?

I never betrayed you
I always spoke the truth to you
Had no explanation
It's still my voice that you are hearing
Where is your trust now?
These are still my eyes that you see
They never betrayed you
They never told you lies

I never prayed but now I pray to you
I never wept but now I cry to you
Don't take the last breath out of me
Don't break what's almost broken
I am so afraid
I have nothing left
Fulfil my last wish
And let me die in your arms

If I die I'll die with you
Don't leave me, please don't leave me
I am nothing without you
No, nothing without you
I can't take this pain anymore
I do not want to leave you now, all alone
I die for one last moment of happiness

Fulfil my last wish
And let me die in your arms
I wanna die in your arms
Let me feel your embrace for one last time
