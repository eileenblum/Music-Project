Out in the cold among this faceless little crowd
One light shines for evermore
Just in the time that my world was falling down
My universe starts to live

Life always cancelled every plan that I have made
But now this plan grows and grows
Don't care what you see
Don't care what you might hear
It's all about what you feel inside

I was drowning
Drowning in this river of my pain
But now I my doubts are blown away

There was no reason to live
There was no reason to die
I have been lost and alone but then I found you
Go with me all the way it's so true
My heart is leading the way
There is the chance it will stay
And I know that I won't never ever live in my past
This will rise, this will fall, this will last

Each time you think it can't get worse than it is
From somewhere conies a helping hand
Don't think that much, don't regret, just live your life
From out of nowhere joy arise

I was drowning
Drowning in this river of my pain
But now I never let you go

There was no reason to live
There was no reason to die
I have been lost and alone but then I found you
Go with me all the way it's so true
My heart is leading the way
There is the chance it will stay
And I know that I won't never ever live in my past
This will rise, this will fall, this will last

Just a little touch of heaven
Just a little less pain - it was not in vain

There was no reason to live
There was no reason to die
I have been lost and alone but then I found you
Go with me all the way it's so true
My heart is leading the way
There is the chance it will stay
And I know that I won't never ever live in my past
This will rise, this will fall, this will last

Looking back on this cold day when I found you
Not alone I will go all the way
My heart leads and I will follow
What I discovered then it is simply so pure
This will rise, this will fall, this will last
And I won't never ever live in my past
