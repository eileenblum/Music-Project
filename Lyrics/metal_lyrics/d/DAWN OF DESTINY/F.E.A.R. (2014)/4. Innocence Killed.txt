No one will know the pain I feel
All of my wounds they never will heal
I'm just a child whose youth has been killed
I am a slave to nightmares and fear

I went to school that day again like any days before in my life since then
I tried to learn, to help myself, to listen carefully what they say
The bell has rang, looking forward to go then, could have found some new birds singing
Instead of that I have met you - the black men, the shadows, the devil

And in my dreams I still see the dark so clear
And every night I try to sleep with fear
Your icecold hands and your whiskeysmelling breath
Those touching hands they have felt to me like death

Pain and hate - it all feels the same to me
This was my youth you destroyed
Sorrow or joy - I never live my life again
This was my innocence you killed

You brought me here and destroyed my peace
To this place that I see every night in my dreams
You heard my cries, you enjoyed them well
For this night I had to be your slave
You hid your face, I never saw
I never will and I'd never want to see it
You let me go after raping me for that
I lost everything I once called life

Pain and hate - it all feels the same to me
This was my youth you destroyed
Sorrow or joy - I never live my life again
This was my innocence you killed
