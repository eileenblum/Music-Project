There are the last days of your life
This is the silence and the darkness
Forever you and me -
This was everything we could see
We swore at the altar -
We never let each other down

I never break my promise
If you will die I'll die with you

Feel my pain as I lay dying in your arms -
I will never ever let you die alone
The strength in me as growing stronger
With your love -
My heart won't ever let this dream die now

Can't live my life without you
I never ponder I never doubt
But why the hell is this our destiny?

No, my love, I will never leave you alone
I only need your love

Feel my pain as I lay dying in your arms -
I will never ever let you die alone
The strength in me as growing stronger
With your love -
My heart won't ever let this dream die now
