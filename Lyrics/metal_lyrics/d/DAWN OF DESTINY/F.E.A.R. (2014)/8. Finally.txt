Please try to leave it all behind
There is so much that you will find
Finding my trust is so much harder than it seems

I touched your face. I touched your heart
And 1 knew it from the start
Starting a new life with you, oh with you

This is now the best time of my life
I fear that this cannot last
Deep in my heart I'm afraid you'll hurt me, too

No one, nobody ever trusted me
And needed me like you do now
I told you all the hells I have gone through
And I do not know if you're strong enough

They always say life's a gift, not a burden
We should be grateful for all things we have in life
But take a closer look
Then you will find a different answer
Maybe it's the point that I found love finally

It took some time to convince you
That my love for you is true
True love is something that I never have felt

I do accept the way you are
Though I know there are some scars
Scars of my pain that I have felt all my life

This is now the best time of my life
I fear that this cannot last
Deep in my heart I'm afraid you'll hurt me, too

No one, nobody ever trusted me
And needed me like you do now
I told you all the hells I have gone through
And I do not know if you're strong enough

They always say life's a gift, not a burden
We should be grateful for all things we have in life
But take a closer look
Then you will find a different answer
Maybe it's the point that I found love finally

I would give my life away for you my love
For such a long time I need you
There is still so much for us to come
Look into my eyes
There is no disguise

They always say life's a gift, not a burden
We should be grateful for all things we have in life
But take a closer look
Then you will find a different answer
Maybe it's the point that I found love finally
