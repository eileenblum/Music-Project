Somewhere at this frozen lake
It happened and it was no fake
The forest has witnessed the crime
Alone you've been and so am I

I feel what you have felt
I know what you have known

I look through your eyes now
I feel the pain that you felt

Alone in the night where the silence is tangible
They brought you here
With no sign and no hope left
Then they spread your legs, it cannot be undone
Didn't care that you cried
Just the forest has listened

Don't scream, don't cry
My face is the last thing you see before you die

What it takes to destroy a human heart
It's a simple plan with no love and no regret
No hope for the healing
You won't see compassion in my eyes
Cause I know what you feel, I felt it all before
No hope for a savior

Going back to this place where the trees are crying
Some blood is still there
And the source of sorrow
I am touching the ground the smell of death around
I imagine you
And can't hold back the tears

Don't scream, don't cry
My face is the last thing you see before you die

What it takes to destroy a human heart
It's a simple plan with no love and no regret
No hope for the healing
You won't see compassion in my eyes
Cause I know what you feel, I felt it all before
No hope for a savior

I scream for vengeance
I save all my anger for you
I destroy you as you have
Destroyed her before

And so it goes on and on
Hate is producing hate

There is no chance
No, you can't break the circle
The circle of pain and hate
This will go on, on and on

What it takes to destroy a human heart
It's a simple plan with no love and no regret
No hope for the healing
You won't see compassion in my eyes
Cause I know what you feel, I felt it all before
No hope for a savior
