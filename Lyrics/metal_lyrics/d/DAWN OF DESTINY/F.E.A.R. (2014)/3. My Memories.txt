See me, feel me
I am here for you
Still you don't see me, don't hear me
Though I am there for you

No, I do not care
And I do not see you
No one ever has been there for me
I just had my toy
It was always beside me
And loneliness I got used to

You always said we'd have to suffer
And I never knew what you meant
I always noticed your changes
As mom left you and me

I could cry, I could scream
I want my memories back
Those memories you can't remember
There must have been a time
Where everything has been alright
Why aren't there any memories left?

I see you suffer
Though you do not know my name
So strange I seem to be invisible for you
Please perceive someone willing to help

No, I do not care and I do not know
Anything good in my life
Why did you say we have to suffer?
Oh Daddy, please make it right

This chapter is over
And what is now to come?
Somehow I feel a fear inside myself
Something is going on

I could cry, I could scream
I want my memories back
Those memories I can't remember
There must have been a time
Where everything has been alright
Why aren't there any memories left?

I see your misery and I feel compassion
I'd like to know what hells you go through
I want to touch your face
I'd like to feel the pain that you feel
