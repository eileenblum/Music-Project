The traffic light in my life
It turned to red
I have been told that I have to suffer
Now it seems he was right

Oh my eyes full of tears
Still hear your voice in my ears

A tragic end of what was right
I feel the pain that you felt
You felt alone but I hope that you always knew
I never lost my faith in you

Oh my eyes full of tears
Still hear your voice in my ears

I am lost without you
I can't find my way
I will drown without you
In this sea of fear

I can't live without you
Your love was my rebirth
My father's words have reached me
Yes, Dad, you were right

I am lost without you
I can't find my way
I will drown without you
In this sea of fear

To live is to suffer!
