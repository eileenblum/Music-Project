Please go away from me, leave me alone
This place is not my home
My chair is broken, my daddy makes it right
I wish he'd be by my side

My mom already left us that day I had this accident
My daddy swore that he won't do the same
Now I'm all alone and I'm waiting here for him
Those people here will never understand

And still I'm waiting for a sign to come
The pain and sorrow won't go away
No, please don't leave me all alone in this world
I'm waiting for a sign to change my life

No one ever knows it's like to be me
No one ever feels the ache that I feel
Did I scream too much?
Was it too much work?
Am I forgotten?

And still I'm waiting for a sign to come
The pain and sorrow won't go away
No, please don't leave me all alone in this world
I'm waiting for a sign to change my life
