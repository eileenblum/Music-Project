Loneliness haunting me and no one will heal me
Dreaming of someone that I still do not know
My life cut in pieces and no one around me
See you in heaven if this place exists

Waiting for my time to come
I have touched your face in your darkest hour

The fear of being alone is the key for my weakness
I try to live without it but can't face my life

I will come for you
I will be with you to make you see

You are my rising angel
But I never got my wings to fly
You will protect my world now
But I never learned to dream your dreams
You will change the world for me
No, I never ever even changed myself
You will be my rising angel
No one ever taught me how to fly

Still on my own still I'm all alone -
Feel my heart pounding
Might see you every day
But still I do not know what's your face like
Love is not a gift, it seems to be a curse -
Still I don't know the meaning
Somewhere there is someone
That understands the same - find me, please find me

When I touched your face that day
I have seen your misery and your pain

You are my rising angel
But I never got my wings to fly
You will protect my world now
But I never learned to dream your dreams
You will change the world for me
No, I never ever even changed myself
You will be my rising angel
No one ever taught me how to fly

Please take this chance -
It's more than a short romance
You changed my life
Though you don't even know

You are my rising angel
But I never got my wings to fly
You will protect my world now
But I never learned to dream your dreams
You will change the world for me
No, I never ever even changed myself
You will be my rising angel
No one ever taught me how to fly
