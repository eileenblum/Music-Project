Those wounds inside me
They hurt so deep, I can't tell
Where is the love? Where is compassion?
I never knew

I cut myself again, to feel I'm still alive
I do not see my blood, I feel a different pain

Where is the savior in the night?
Where are these arms to hold me tight?
To end this fucking nightmare
Where are those feelings I have lost?
Where are those eyes that I can trust?
To end this haunting nightmare

Don't know the beginning
How it came to all this
But I seem to know the ending
This chapter is over

Can't you see that I'm alone?
And I lived through much pain in my life
Too much for one soul to take
Pain... just pain!

Where is the savior in the night?
Where are these arms to hold me tight?
To end this fucking nightmare
Where are those feelings I have lost?
Where are those eyes that I can trust?
To end this haunting nightmare
