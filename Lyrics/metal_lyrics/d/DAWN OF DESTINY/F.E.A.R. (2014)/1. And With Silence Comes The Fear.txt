Opened my eyes - where am I?
Should be still at home, I fear they lied

Had to give you away
The pain is much too strong
You will find me one day
I hope I was not wrong

Where's my dad and where are my toys?
This terrifying silence makes me fear

You are so different
Could not live alone
With all the time we spend
Think you need a new home

I don't care I don't care
I turn around and see no one
I don't know I don't know
Is anybody calling me?
I don't see I don't see
No, I never ever see you
I don't hear I don't hear
I never ever listen to you

Looking for my wheel chair, gotta move
Cannot play with the same toys, I need a proof

You and me, we are determined to suffer
I always told you
Life's a burden with no love and no hope
Can't feel anything and lonely you will be

Many things and they all bother me
I only need that toy beside me here

I tried my best
Now I'm sick and tired
This pain remains
Please forgive me

I feel that somewhere someone suffers
Someone made for you?
Together we might end it, end it

I don't care I don't care
I turn around and see no one
I don't know I don't know
Is anybody calling me?
I don't see I don't see
No, I never ever see you
I don't hear I don't hear
I never ever listen to you
