Who's the one that made this peculiar?
Tell me why I'm here
I always trusted in you for so long
And still I do now

You called me up when I needed you bad
You gave me life when I was feeling almost dead
And with every breath I feel you close to me

For your crimes I have to pay now
Though I'm not to blame
I hush for you though I know you are guilty
This is what I owe you

You called me up when I needed you bad
You gave me life when I was feeling almost dead
So tell me why I'm here

See my wounds they will never ever heal
Feel my pain as I stand alone abandoned by you
Touch my heart - all I want from you
Perceive the one holding on and recognize the
Bleeding me

Talk with me
Come near to me
See my tears as you still keep silent to them

You called me up when I needed you bad
You gave me life when I was feeling almost dead
So tell me why I'm here

See my wounds they will never ever heal
Feel my pain as I stand alone abandoned by you
Touch my heart - all I want from you
Perceive the one holding on and recognize the
Bleeding me

But when I die now I know that I do it for you
Please keep in mind that I still love you honestly
I die with pride and my love 'cause I do it for you
The only thing in my life I don't regret - it is you!
