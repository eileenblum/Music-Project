See my hands
Stained with blood 
What I've done
Vanished in the flood

My whole life
I stood in the shade 
It was my time
I am filled with hate

No one saw the signs 
No one saw my tears 
No one felt my pain 
No one left to blame

I loved you - I once loved you
I told you
I'd do anything for you - Anything for you 
Eternally you are with me

I'm still in love with the one that I lost 
No one knows this aching heart
For all I've done I deserve to die now 
But did you ever feel the same way

In my head
It turned out right 
Now I know
It's more than a fight

Did not see
Did not know
My way is wrong
Still I don't know how

No one saw the signs 
No one saw my tears 
No one felt my pain 
No one left to blame

I loved you - I once loved you
I told you
I'd do anything for you - Anything for you 
Eternally you are with me

I'm still in love with the one that I lost 
No one knows this aching heart
For all I've done I deserve to die now 
But did you ever feel the same way
