Ages come and ages go
What have we learned what does it show?
We ask ourselves so many times.
Why we still are telling lies.

We will remain alone in the dark with no light left to shine for us.
Coldness in our hearts will grow as long as we do not comprehend.

Evils still alive.
No, we have to fight it hard
Victory is mine.
No, we will prevent soon till we have found our peace and love.

I see the sky is turning dark and darker.
And our way to heaven will get harder.
We had mission and we try to fulfill it.
We many not fail cause mankind won't survive.

We walk down further into hell and purgatory.
No, we still are learning from those bad times.
We should have learned our lesson in those bad times.
The scum is slowly taking more control.
No, we still are looking for the right path.
For years and years we never walked the right path.

Evils still alive.
No, we have to fight it hard - Victory is mine.
No, we will prevent it soon till we have found our peace and love.
They will take revenge.
They will take your lives.

I see the sky is turning dark and darker.
And our way to heaven will get harder.
We had a mission and we try to fulfill it.
We many not fail cause mankind won't survive.

For all the years of sadness we have wasted.
Salvation's calling but we cannot hear it.
For all the years of madness we allowed.
The devil's waiting and we will come closer.

We walk down further into hell and purgatory.
No, we still are learning from those bad times.
We should have learned our lesson in those bad times.
The scum is slowly taking more control.
No, we still are looking for the right path.
For years and years we never walked the right path.
