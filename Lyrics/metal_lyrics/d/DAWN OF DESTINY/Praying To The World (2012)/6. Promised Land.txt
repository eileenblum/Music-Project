All these cowards in this world.
They hide and lie to you again.

All these forgotten memories.
They write their own story someday.

One day you'll find all the traces in the sand.
One day you'll look for the promised land.
All of your life you've been hiding in the shade.
Don't you believe one day it's too late?

All those lost heroes hide in shame.
They never tried to save us, they always ran away.

All the lies they tell you on the screen.
Now it's time to wake up and let the truth be yours.

One day you'll find all the traces in the sand.
One day you'll look for the promised land.
All of your life you've been hiding in the shade.
Don't you believe one day it's too late?
