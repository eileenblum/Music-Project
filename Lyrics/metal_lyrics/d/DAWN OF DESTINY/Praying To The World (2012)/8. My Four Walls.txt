Through a slit in the door I get my food
Into a small white pot I defecate

Only once a year I take a look outside this room
But it scares so much so many things that I don't know

There is a glass inside these walls
Strange moving pictures I see there

No one knows, no one feels the fear
That I have inside these walls
I am here and I will stay forever
'Cause this is the place I love

Only once a year I take a look outside this room
But it scares so much so many things that I don't know

It imitates me, it makes the same moves at the same time like I do
It might frustrate me, I am not able to do things all on my own
Sometimes I wish to destroy the glass you're in

But this face inside this glass it is my only friend
You make my life worth living for

No one knows, no one feels the fear
That I have inside these walls
I am here and I will stay forever
'Cause this is the place I love
