We believe in the words that someone has said
Though we did not hear the same
We believe in the words that someone wrote down
Though we did never read the same

Yes, we believe and we follow someone
Someone that we will never ever meet

Is it right that we trust in the senses we all have?
Is this far away from sanity?
All those things that occur we try to understand
Is there still a reason for it all?

Still we are asking and wondering why
We canât comprehend it all and yes it sometimes hurts

I believe in the miracles and the wonders here on earth
We are scared of the great unknown and all things that we canât cause

I believe in the miracles and the wonders here on earth
We are scared of the great unknown and all things that we canât cause

Everything thatâs foreign seems to be hostile as well
Everything thatâs strange seems to be wrong as well
Canât explain it all, something stays unknown
No secret remains even if it destroys us

We believe in the words that someone has said
Though we did not hear the same
We believe in the words that someone wrote down
Though we did never read the same

Yes, we believe and we follow someone
Someone that we will never ever meet

Sometimes we must
Oftentimes we should
We should believe, we must believe

Sometimes we must
Oftentimes we should
We should believe, we must believe

I believe in the miracles and the wonders here on earth
We are scared of the great unknown and all things that we canât cause

I believe in the miracles and the wonders here on earth
We are scared of the great unknown and all things that we canât cause

I believe in the miracles and the wonders here on earth
We are scared of the great unknown and all things that we canât cause

I believe in the miracles and the wonders here on earth
