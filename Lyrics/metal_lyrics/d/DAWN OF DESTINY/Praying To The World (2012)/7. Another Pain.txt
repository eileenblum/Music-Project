One forgotten soul on its final way
There is no place called home, no place to stay
Sinking down on his knees, taking a final breath
There is no helping hand, nothing left except his death

No one prays, no one cries for him
Such a strange mad world, without compassion

Another pain - it will hurt me once more
Another fight - I am rotten to the core
This world is deaf - no ears will hear my cry
This world is blind - no eyes will see that I die
In your arms, where are you?

Who will care about this boy tomorrow?
Who will talk to those living in sorrow?
All is lost in despair, all is lost and forgotten
We seem to leave it behind, we leave it rotten

If we are looking for a way to destroy ourselves
We can congratulate ourselves 'cause the way we go
Is right

No one prays, no one cries for him
Such a strange mad world, without compassion

Another pain - it will hurt me once more
Another fight - I am rotten to the core
This world is deaf - no ears will hear my cry
This world is blind - no eyes will see that I die
In your arms, where are you?
