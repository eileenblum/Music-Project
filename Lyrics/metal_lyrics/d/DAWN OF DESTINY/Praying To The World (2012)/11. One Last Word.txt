Look around
We're almost there
A place of mercy, a place of grace

You will find your freedom
Your sins will be forgiven

Read the Bible
Just every day
Judgement day will be coming soon

Just for little money
We will save your soul

They stain God's name
They will betray you
They pray and they preach
One last word
There is no love
And there is no belief
They try to make you blind
They will hurt you

Soon you're caught
In this dirty trap
Losing your conscience, losing your will

You will find your freedom
Your sins will be forgiven

They try to brainwash
Exploiting the weak
Keep hold of this danger and try to stay strong

Just for little money 
We will save your soul

They stain God's name 
They will betray you
They pray and they preach 
One last word
There is no love
And there is no belief
They try to make you blind 
They will hurt you

They whisper
They lie and they betray
There is no exit, there is no escape
They promise you heaven
But put you through hell

Their legion grows and no one knows why
They are the devil
Without a disguise

Just for little money 
We will save your soul

They stain God's name 
They will betray you
They pray and they preach 
One last word
There is no love
And there is no belief
They try to make you blind 
They will hurt you
