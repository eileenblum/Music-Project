Somewhere must be the point where it all began
No one knows how, no one knows when
We have learned from the start, violence ain't a solution - 
We always break that rule, what is the conclusion?

You won't believe what atrocities man is capable of - 
Take a look in the news and you'll become misanthropic - 

Some animals we call beasts
But we are not even animals
The only beast in this world is the man

Some women will cut off the nose
With no punishment for those
Who are raping, killing, lying to everyone

Sometimes religion or sometimes war
Sometimes peer pressure, sometimes education
Sometimes belief, sometimes nothing at all
Is the reason for us to run wild

Some animals we call beasts
But we are not even animals
The only beast in this world is the man

Violence is the weapon of the weak
If you believe this, better not speak
The only beast in this world is the man

Sadistic terror and merciless torture
Still alive in a new millennium -
What has man to do with humanity?
Why do we live in this rotten society?

We call ourselves the crown of creation
But we still need someone for our salvation
We are nothing except the scum of this earth
We force our death with certainly no rebirth

Some animals we call beasts
But we are not even animals
The only beast in this world is the man

Violence is the weapon of the weak
If you believe this, better not speak
The only beast in this world is the man

Violence is the weapon of the weak

It ain't this world that turns a man into a killer
It is the man himself that turns the world into hell
