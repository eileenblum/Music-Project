Hush â donât say a word
They do not get us

Wait â I see them arrive
They try to catch us

No one sees, no one cares
No one sends a helping sign
We are all on our own

Still we try to get by
We believe in ourselves
And we will be strong

We are so far away from home, my brother
Stealing food out of the trash can

This is my future and this is my past
My life lies in ruins, Iâve lost my belief

This was not meant to be
No, this ainât my life

Come â come closer to me
Our parents left us

Raised on the street like a dog
Even left without a bone, I am tired
They never cared

I feel hate, I feel pain
Someday I will go insane, I am mad
How could they left us?

For all the sorrow that we feel
We have only names to blame

This is my future and this is my past
My life lies in ruins, Iâve lost my belief
Pray to the one that I once have called God
But even you have left me, once again Iâm all alone

All tears are cried now
My heart is chained by stones
Donât you know what youâve done to us?
Still Iâm in anger
Still Iâm in agony
Do you ever hear my screams?

This is my future and this is my past
My life lies in ruins, Iâve lost my belief
Pray to the one that I once have called God
But even you have left me, once again Iâm all alone

This is my future and this is my past
My life lies in ruins, Iâve lost my belief
Pray to the one that I once have called God
But even you have left me, once again Iâm all alone

Alone...
