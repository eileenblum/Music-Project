I run away from my thoughts.
But they always get me.
In my own world I'm alone.
The only place I love.

No pain and no sorrow.
No broken hearts.
And no wars and no fights
Everything in here is just fine.
This is my only defense in this rotten world.
My place of mercy, my place of grace.

I escape from the real world.
I isolate myself.
No longer I care about you.
I have to think of myself.

And the whole around me.
Seems to live without me now.
I stay here at my place of grace.

Whenever I feel lost.
Whenever I feel sad.
Salvation is near.
Just a few clicks away.

In front of my screen.
I turn it all on.
I close the door behind.
And open my world.

This is my only defense in this rotten world.
My place of mercy, my place of grace.
I escape from the real world.
I isolate myself.
No longer I care about you.
I have to think of myself.

And the whole world around me
Seems to live without me now.
I stay here at my place of grace.
No I never ever need someone.
I got all I need now.
I stay at my place of mercy.

I escape from the real world.
I isolate myself.
No longer I care about you.
I have to think of myself.

And the whole world around me
Seems to live without me now.
I stay here at my place of grace.
No I never ever need someone.
I got all I need now.
I stay at my place of mercy.
