Touch my hand
and feel the warmth.
I'll be always there for you.
Lay your head on my shoulder.
I will calm you, comfort you.
I know your feelings.
I see your fears.
Will offer my helping hands.

See no solution
and no conclusion.
Stay by me this time.
The pain you're feeling.
I try to ease it.
I give all that I've got
and don't expect nothing.
As long as I can fight.
I fight these wars for you.

But in the depth of your eyes I see doubts.
You don't believe in all the words that I say.

Why do you reject my aid
and no do not trust in me?
Oh It seems that I am misunderstood.
Am I wrong?

Oh, what have I done so wrong?
I still try to be that strong.
What is wrong with this world?
I can no longer comprehend what's going on.
Should I leave you on your own
Without a helping hand?

Only words of nothingness
can't reach a rotten heart.

And in the depth of your I see doubts.
You don't believe in all the words that I say.

Why do you reject my aid...

I am misunderstood.
I am misunderstood.

I feel so lost and lonely.
I am alone without you.
Please take a look into my world.
This world ain't a place for a good soul to stay.
My heart is a place where the sun never shines.

Why do you reject my aid...

I am misunderstood.
I am misunderstood.

Why do you reject my aid?
No, I don't believe in fate.
I'm misunderstood.
I feel so lost and lonely.
I am alone without you.
Please take a look into my world.
