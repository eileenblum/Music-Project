I hate this world
For it left me all alone
There are no more feelings
Inside of me

I can no more longer pretend
That everything is fine
I lose my sanity
Running into a dead end street

Fire in his heart and
His soul is tearing itself apart
Don't know what to do now
He hates himself for too long now

Another rainy morning
My feet won't carry me out of bed
Another wasted day
Like all the other days of my life

They will not listen to him
When he tries to speak
They only beat me up
Yes, this is my life

He prays to the world once more
Leave me all alone this time
Sometimes he wants no one
To see the extent of my misery

Still he feels so helpless
The pain inside is growing stronger
These four walls around him
Have never been a place called home

Do you imagine my feelings?
When I realise I'm loved by no one
What should I do now?
Revenge and hate inside my mind

I do not think about you
As you did not about me
I won't regret
For neither you have done as well

He prays to the world once more
Leave me all alone this time
Sometimes he wants no one
To see the extent of my misery

Oh, at night
The devil talks to him
He is the only one
Knowing what he feels

They hurt you without regret
Go out now, you know what to do

And I killed them without emotions
Somehow so weird, the pain is still there

Just give me one moment of salvation

Now he lays to rest
His work is done, the pain's remaining
Only one solution
A letter leads to his destiny

Will the world remember now
The one that no one ever knew?
I wish you all the ache
That I have felt for so long in my life

The devil was right, the devil was right
Telling me the truth
And I've to feel salvation now

He prays to the world once more
Leave me all alone this time
Sometimes he wants no one
To see the extent of my misery
