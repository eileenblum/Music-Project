And I pray for the end of my daysAnd I hope that nothing remainsI feel my miseryEndless days of crying I am awakened from a dreamA dream, or was it still reality?Things are not the way they seemI am here and there is all a fantasy But still I feel captured, closed inTrying, how?And I realize why I'm hereSeems so many things do appear Every night I wish away my sicknessEvery night I try to scream out my pain And I pray for the end of my daysAnd I hope that nothing remainsI feel my miseryEndless days of crying Have I reached the world in my mind?And see the past before my eyesAll my mistakes pour over meBut will surround me too Seems like I wasted too much timeWith things not so importantI miss my friends, my familyAll this time, it makes me see Lord, please hear my voiceGod, this is all vain And I pray for the end of my daysAnd I hope that nothing remainsI feel my miseryEndless days of cryingAnd I pray for the end of my daysAnd I hope that nothing remainsI feel my miseryEndless days of crying Only when it's come to an endYou'll see the things in life so dearTry to seize the time you have on Earth now'Cause life can be shorter than you think And I pray for the end of my daysAnd I hope that nothing remainsI feel my miseryEndless days of cryingAnd I pray for the end of my daysAnd I hope that nothing remainsI feel my miseryEndless days of crying
