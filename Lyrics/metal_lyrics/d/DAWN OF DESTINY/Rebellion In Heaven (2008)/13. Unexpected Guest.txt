So many people are starvedSo many people drownSo many still are deafAnd too many blindBut we close our eyes Challenge thoughtsBlind in fairytalesIn the end good will always win Ignorance is a deadly sinMaybe someone will forgiveWhere's the hope that I once foundLost in time and spaceForever lost Seems like we're waiting for an unexpected guestHe will erase all our misery and painSeems like we're waiting for an unexpected guestHe will erase all our misery and pain So many people killedSo many people rapedSo many still pretendToo many betrayedStill we close our eyes And the worldIs standing on the edgeIf we move closer we all fall down Ignorance is a deadly sinMaybe someone will forgiveWhere's the hope that I once foundLost in time and spaceForever lost Seems like we're waiting for an unexpected guestHe will erase all our misery and painSeems like we're waiting for an unexpected guestHe will erase all our misery and pain Seems like we're waiting for an unexpected guestHe will erase all our misery and painSeems like we're waiting for an unexpected guestHe will erase all our misery and pain
