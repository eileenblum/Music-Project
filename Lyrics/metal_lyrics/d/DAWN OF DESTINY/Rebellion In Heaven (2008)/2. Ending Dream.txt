There was a time of so much insecurityEternity, yes I thought and hoped and prayedIt must have been you With eyes of love you looked at meSomeone who is so different This was the beginning of a love made pureTruth, and honestlyA neverending dream that we had to wake upWill you forgive me There was nothing you've done wrongStill no one like youEternity, I never new someoneThat could be like this And it's so confusing that I reject youAnd yet it's a pity, to me and youThe hardest decision that I have left youAnd it made my pride (It made me whole) With eyes of love you looked at meSomeone who is so different This was the beginning of a love made pureTruth, and honestlyA neverending dream that we had to wake upWill you forgive me Now we walk alone againAnd we both miss the timeThough it won't come back againIt's been kept insideMy mind With eyes of love you looked at meSomeone who is so different This was the beginning of a love made pureTruth, and honestlyA neverending dream that we had to wake upWill you forgive me [4x]
