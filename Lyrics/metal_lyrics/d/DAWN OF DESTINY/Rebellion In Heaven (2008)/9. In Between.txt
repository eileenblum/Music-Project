Forgive and be forgivenSalvation comes when you regretLove and teach how to loveAnd never deal with the devil But why did no one ever teach with thisWhy do I creep through the night without sleepBut why did no one ever teach with thisWhy do I creep through the night without sleep I have to choose the wayPaved by trial and hateNow it's too late to make me see All I want is a place that I can call my homeBut once, I got locked somewhere in betweenAnd I wonder who has turned my heart to stoneThough I do regret, the door's still locked LOST IN BETWEENWithout hopeLOST IN BETWEENWithout fearLOST IN BETWEENWithout dreamsLOST IN BETWEEN I paid the price for no one was thereWhen I needed help, I was all aloneAll my hopes burnedAll my hopes burnedAll my dreams burned I have to choose the wayPaved by trial and hateNow it's too late to make me see All I want is a place that I can call my homeBut once, I got locked somewhere in betweenAnd I wonder who has turned my heart to stoneThough I do regret, the door's still locked LOST IN BETWEENWithout hopeLOST IN BETWEENWithout fearLOST IN BETWEENWithout dreamsLOST IN BETWEEN I feel hate for the ones who left me behindI still remember when I was a little childAll alone in my room, with no one by my sideWho should've taught me how to dream All alone in my roomWith no one by my sideWho should've taught me how to dreamAll alone in my roomWith no one by my sideWho should've taught me how to dream(Lost in between)All alone(Lost in between)With no one by my side(Lost in between)Who should've taught me how to(Lost in between)How to dream ...Call my homeBut once, I got locked somewhere in betweenAnd I wonder who has turned my heart to stoneThough I do regret, the door's still locked LOST IN BETWEENWithout hopeLOST IN BETWEENWithout fearLOST IN BETWEENWithout dreamsLOST IN BETWEEN
