So much frustrationSo much disappointmentSo many complaintsThe world seems unfairSo much to do and so little time What of your deeds would you regretWhat would you do if this was your last day? WHAT WOULD YOU DOIF THIS WAS YOUR LAST DAY? If it's your last day on Earth, what would you change?Even if you cannot stay here, would you rearrange? [2x] Would you regret or transgress the past mind?Would you derail all the things you have done?All those broken promises and those liesAll the ones you hurt It's not a shame to be satisfiedEven intact you'll feel alright If it's your last day on Earth, what would you change?Even if you cannot stay here, would you rearrange? [2x] It's not a shame to be satisfiedEven intact you'll feel alright If it's your last day on Earth, what would you change?Even if you cannot stay here, would you rearrange? [4x]
