What if God has never been thereOnly invented for someone to blameEvery time the world seems unfairIt's when Heaven's falling down There are so many menAnd many own beliefsDifferent views and some false ideasStill many new religionsAmong some foreign idolsPrejudice is that the other one's wrong Killing, fightingDying tryingAll seems right in the name of a GodHopeless hundredsSad and lonesomeWhen someone laughs the other one cries What if God has never been thereOnly invented for someone to blameEvery time the world seems unfairIt's when Heaven's falling downFalling down What if the laws are justA result of human fearAn evidence of such an incapacityAll our faith is justA sign of blank despairOur race is cursed for all eternity Killing, fightingDying tryingAll seems right in the name of a GodHopeless hundredsSad and lonesomeWhen someone laughs the other one cries What if God has never been thereOnly invented for someone to blameEvery time the world seems unfairIt's when Heaven's falling down What if God has never been thereOnly invented for someone to blameEvery time the world seems unfairIt's when Heaven's falling down What if God has never been thereOnly invented for someone to blameEvery time the world seems unfairIt's when Heaven's falling downFalling down
