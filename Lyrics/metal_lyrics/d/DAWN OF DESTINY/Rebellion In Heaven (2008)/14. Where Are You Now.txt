Now your face is goneAnd I am lost, alone without you nowTears fall as you leave'Cause once we've been as close as we could be You have been thereEvery time that I have needed youStill I see your eyesIn front of me so full of sorrow nowDo you even knowHow much I miss you since you've been gone Where are you nowWhere are you nowI don't know why it has come this wayDidn't want to staySo where are you now No one else will come closePlease don't look back with painOh, I tried so hardTo make it right Where are you nowWhere are you nowI don't know why it has come this wayDidn't want to staySo where are you nowWhere are you nowWhere are you nowI don't know why it has come this wayDidn't want to staySo where are you now
