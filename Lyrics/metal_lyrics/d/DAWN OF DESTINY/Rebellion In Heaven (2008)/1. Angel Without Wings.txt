One silent whisperOne gentle voiceLuring me away from hereYes, I will wait for youLeave this world behindEverything out of sightThere's no reason to stay hereYes, I will wait for you Leaving my home just like there is a knownFacing your fears so you will understand Now I fly like an angel without wings to escape despairAnd I hope for a better world, maybe another timeYet I try just to fly like an angel without wingsHoping for some peace of mind, and you to understand Tell me where the joy has beenTell me where the love has gone I never thought that no one ever heard me prayI never thought it would turn out this wayGod, talk to me Leaving my home just like there is a knownFacing your fears so you will understand Now I fly like an angel without wings to escape despairAnd I hope for a better world, maybe another timeYet I try just to fly like an angel without wingsHoping for some peace of mind, and you to understand Now I fly like an angel without wings to escape despairAnd I hope for a better world, maybe another timeYet I try just to fly like an angel without wingsHoping for some peace of mind, and you to understandI fly like an angel without wings to escape despairAnd I hope for a better world, maybe another timeYet I try just to fly like an angel without wingsHoping for some peace of mind, and you to understand
