Centuries ago - or still alive?Misery, torture, pain - still justifiedIn the name of ChristianityPersecution, MurderingThe so called hereticsFor church, for God, for profit Judged by the hand of deathBishops, popes the holy menIn the name of Jesus ChristNo freedom of beliefWith cruelty inconceivableBrutal inventions on their sideForcing everyone to believeWhat they shall do Nothing's as red as blood The inquisition draws nearAnd they will all appearTo accuse you of false beliefThere is only one way to GodAnd we will show you the wayEven if it takes your lifeYou won't surviveIf you're wrong Accepting the holy Bible at face valueWitches, heretics they all have to burn Judged by the hand of deathBishops, popes the holy menIn the name of Jesus ChristNo freedom of beliefWith cruelty inconceivableBrutal inventions on their sideForcing everyone to believeWhat they shall do Nothing's as red as blood The inquisition draws nearAnd they will all appearTo accuse you of false beliefThere is only one way to GodAnd we will show you the wayEven if it takes your lifeYou won't surviveIf you're wrong
