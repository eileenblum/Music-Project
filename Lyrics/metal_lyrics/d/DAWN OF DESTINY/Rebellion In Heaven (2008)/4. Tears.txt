There was a timeWhen you were so close to meIt all has been fineTwo hearts' indignity But in the still of the nightYou have disappearedThe moon it shone so brightSo much I have to fear Fight the tears of sorrowNot an endless fightThere is no tomorrowWhen love is forced to hide But in the still of the nightYou have disappearedThe moon it shone so brightSo much I have to fear Fight the tears of sorrowNot an endless fightThere is no tomorrowWhen love is forced to hide [2x] Fight the tears of sorrowNot an endless fightThere is no tomorrowWhen love is forced to hide [4x]
