And every time that I feel deadAnd every time that I feel lostWhen it seems there's no one by my sideOh God, I pray to You And every time that I am downAnd every time I seem to drownWhen it seems there's no more hope Please save us fromAll the evil in this worldJesus, whenThe pain is overcomingEven if all our dreams are lost [2x] Promise to save us, GodDivine and glorious And every time that I am desperateI pray to YouSo many times I have been waiting for an answer Please save us fromAll the evil in this worldJesus, whenThe pain is overcomingEven if all our dreams are lost [2x] Just like a childI look to the skyI'm looking for a sign from aboveDo I only prayTo make me feel saferAm I talking to You? Please save us fromAll the evil in this worldJesus, whenThe pain is overcomingEven if all our dreams are lost [4x]
