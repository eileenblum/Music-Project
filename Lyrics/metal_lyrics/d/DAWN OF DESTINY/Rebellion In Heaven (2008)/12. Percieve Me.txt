I tried so hardTo make you seeThought you were smartPlease leave me be Still you've got a wrong ideaOf what you see and what you hearStill my deeds are not enoughYou still think that I am tough Perceive me as the one that I really amI wanna break free now, release meFrom the pain I always feel I'm not this oneI try to be strong Take your time to find outWhat I am really likeDon't bother me no moreI'm the one I am Perceive me as the one that I really amI wanna break free now, release meFrom the pain I always feelPerceive me as the one that I really amI wanna break free now, release meFrom the pain I always feel I have tried to make you see what I really wantYou have only seen the things you wanted toPlease believe my honesty that I tried so hardRealize the truth before your eyesNo disguise
