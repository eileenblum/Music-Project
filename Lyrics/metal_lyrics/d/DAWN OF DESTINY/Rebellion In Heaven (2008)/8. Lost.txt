Deep in the woods she's looking for someoneThere's magic everywhereShe has been told not to go too far awayBut never has to stare There are so many wonderful thingsI can show you everythingDon't you want this fairytale to startThen listen to my voice Lost in a world of magic and wisdomLost in a dream of passion and poetryLost and caught in a dream that I won't wake upNo I'll never see your eyesNo I'll never see your disguise This voice keeps telling on and on and onGets the scent of herBut then she feels her own securityIs this just a trap Believe in me and you'll be anything elseDon't let this dream die youngWhy do you run away from me nowI beg you please, stay here Lost in a world of magic and wisdomLost in a dream of passion and poetryLost and caught in a dream that I won't wake upNo I'll never see your eyesNo I'll never see your disguise And soOn this night of nightsAll creatures of the forest come togetherTo warn this chosen childThat she has returnedFrom the evil who surrounded herAnd so the whole forestShouts out loud Lost in a world of magic and wisdomLost in a dream of passion and poetryLost and caught in a dream that I won't wake upNo I'll never see your eyesNo I'll never see your disguiseLostNever in disguiseLostLostNo I'll never see his eyesLostLost
