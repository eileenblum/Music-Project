Only moments away
I remember the day
That she has left me.
It was a dark fatal night.
Wished with all of my might
That my fear was not right
But then I was certain.
I wish she would have never left.

Tell me why you never talked to me honestly?
So now I know these letters stand for your daughter.

There is something deep and aching inside,
There comes a time you'll know why it died and
I go to hell.
There are days and there are nights that I cried.
Many times and many moments I tried but
I go to hell.

These letters here in my neck,
Its story seems to come back
Who is behind me?
I wonder what is going on.
If you find out the reason
For my treason
It is all over.
No, you don't want to know my story.

There's something ominous and fateful going on.
It seems that somewhere in the ocean's the real truth.

There is something deep and aching inside,
There comes a time you'll know why it died and
I go to hell.
There are days and there are nights that I cried.
Many times and many moments I tried but
I go to hell.

There is something deep and aching inside,
There comes a time you'll know why it died and
I go to hell.
There are days and there are nights that I cried.
Many times and many moments I tried but
I go to hell.

There is something deep and aching inside,
There comes a time you'll know why it died and
I go to hell.
There are days and there are nights that I cried.
Many times and many moments I tried but
I go to hell.
