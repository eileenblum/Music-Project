Somewhere out in the distance
I see the setting sun
As 1 jump now into this ocean
I think of you and me

Although it was not easy
Those years have been so great
You made me a better one
A one worth feeling love

So this is our last goodbye
This is our end?!
Another love, another life
Into this ocean 1 will dive

Oh, one day you'll find the right one
Thereâs no more hate, no more disguise
There's only truth and no more lies
Oh. please find your place in heaven

Never believed in goodbyes
And never said forever
Did never trust in true love
But you proved me wrong

I leave two broken people
But I leave with one last truth
Believe in my true remorse
I'll die for my sins
My tears won't change our fate
I will close my eyes
Another love, another life
Into this ocean I will dive
Oh. one day you'll find the right one
There's no more hate. no more disguise
There's only truth and no more lies
Oh. please find your place in heaven
