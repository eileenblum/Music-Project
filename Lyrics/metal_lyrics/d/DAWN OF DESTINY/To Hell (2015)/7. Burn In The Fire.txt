I feel ashamed
of all those lies
The truth got lost back in a time of hopelessness.

I see a face
that I once knew
the only answers you will read inside your heart

True love requires honesty
help me out of this misery

As long as my pain's remaining
as long as those lies keep raining
Throw it back, cut it out. do it fast, do it now
Are you more than a liar?
As long as you hide your real face
As long as your truth lies in haze
Throw it back, cut it out, do it fast, do it now
Fate will burn in the fire
Who are those shadows of my dreams?
I cannot hide my doubts - but feel too weak to act

And every night
they're haunting me
Please keep your faith in me - I'll never disappoint you

As long as my pain's remaining
as long as those lies keep raining
Throw it back, cut it out, do it fast, do it now
Are you more than a liar?
As long as you hide your real face
As long as your truth lies in haze
Throw it back, cut it out, do it fast, do it now
Fate will burn in the fire

What can I do? When my world is falling down?
What should I do? When these voices tell the truth?

My memories play tricks on me
Those magic moments tell the truth - just listen to it
The sea w ill wash away your sins
Don't let me walk alone - I need you more than ever

As long as my pain's remaining
as long as those lies keep raining
Throw it back, cut it out. do it fast, do it now
Are you more than a liar?
As long as you hide your real face
As long as your truth lies in haze
Throw it back, cut it out, do it fast, do it now
Fate will burn in the fire.
