I never tell you the prehistory
My life's been a dirty wild whore
My life remains a big black mystery
Nothing to live or die for
Someone took hold of my deeds and my will
Some guys who promised that much
But now as I'm wiser, I know that they kill
No one to love or to touch

Fire has burned it all down
Where is the love my world's full of hate
Pieces of my life left behind
Only your love saves our here and our now

They took me out of my miserable life
Pretended to be by my side
I felt desire to throw my past behind
To follow with all of my night

It all happened long before I have met you
The love that I never have felt
I wish and I pray you'll never find out
The girl that you don't use to know

Fire has burned it all down
Where is the love -my world's full of hate
Pieces of my life left behind
Only your love saves our here and our now

If I had the chance to make it all undone
My life I would give then away
I am to blame and it is still a shame
But I hope that you're gonna stay

Fire has burned it all down
Where is the love my world's full of hate
Pieces of my life left behind
Only your love saves our here and our now
