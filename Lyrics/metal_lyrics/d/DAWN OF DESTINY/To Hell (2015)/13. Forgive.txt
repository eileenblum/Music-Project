Nightmares came true
They hurt so much
So what's the clue?
I long for your touch

Now my tears will tell a story of truth
Thereâs a thin line between bad and good
You lied to me
But you died for me
Heaven forgive
What life can't do

Now my tears will tell a story of truth
Thereâs a thin line between bad and good
As close as you have come to me
As close that you have left
For years that Iâve never known you
The greatest love I ever felt was
When your mask did fall
So please let God forgive you more than I can
What's my life worth
Without you now?
Oh, why on earth
Did you break your vow?

Now my tears will tell a story of truth
There's a thin line between bad and good
As close as you have come to me
As close that you have left
For years that I've never known you
The greatest love I ever felt was
When your mask did fall
So please let God forgive you more than I can
