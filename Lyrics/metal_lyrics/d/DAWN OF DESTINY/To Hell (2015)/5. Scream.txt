The threatening appears so real
It terrifies my inner world
Do I fall into the sirens?
Or is your voice reality?

What these dreams cannot tell
My life has been worse than hell
Why do demons follow you?
Donât you know my love is true.

Haunted by those shadows
Shadows of my past

Somewhere in the depths of this heart
There's something wrong

There are signs that we know from somewhere
Please remember all that you know
There is someone near behind us
What is his plan?
Am I right, am I wrong - suspicion
I will scream a last goodbye tonight.

My thoughts run back in time
Where fireâs flying through the night
And people run in fear
I hope you never know what happened in this time
I hope you never know the deeds that I have done

Somewhere here in the depths of this heart
There's something wrong
There are signs that we know from somewhere
Please remember all that you know
There's something wrong
There are signs that we know from somewhere
Please remember all that you know
There is someone near behind us
What is his plan?
Am I right, am I wrong - suspicion
I will scream a last goodbye tonight.

My thoughts run back in time
Where fireâs flying through the night
And people run in fear
I hope you never know what happened in this time
I hope you never know the deeds that I have done

Somewhere in the depths of this heart
Thereâs something wrong
There are signs that we know from somewhere
Please remember all that you know
There is someone near behind us
What is his plan?
Am I right, am I wrong - suspicion
I will scream a last goodbye tonight.
