I lived a life of peace and freedom
Never lost the guts and never lost the reason
My family around, my strength to carry on
A man of honour and pride
Would have died for beloved ones.

Then came one cruel day my world has found its end
Take my pain as fire burns down my whole life
Now my hate will give me reasons to go on
Darkness walks to me and fills my heart with hate.

My two kids full of dreams and hopefulness
Always believed in human's goodness
This pain I feel is endless, it is so real
For love I go this far, so far

Then came one cruel day my world has found its end
Take my pain as fire burns down my whole life
Now my hate will give me reasons to go on

Darkness walks to me and fills my heart with hate
So here I stand in front of you and your love
What should I do now?
I am afraid of what you made out of me
What means good and bad?

Then came one cruet day my world has found its end
Take my pain as fire burns down my whole life
Now my hate will give me reasons to go on
Darkness walks to me and fills my heart w ith hate
Fate takes lives and leaves us empty, dark and cold
Pain still replaces hope and tears my heart apart
Once love ruled my life, now' it's unknown to me
Who in this whole world shoots down my hateful heart?
