Maybe this is the last time
I see your face
The last hours you are mine
I fell from grace
Go on, make your last goodbye
I burned his home, his family
I killed his kids
No. this was never meant to be
I told you lies
I make you pay for what you've done
This is not the end. the fire's the light in the night
I wanna hold you
Nothing really matters for me except your belief
Please don't fear me
Yes. I lied to you. to him and I lied to myself
But I love you
If I have to go. I will drown in this ocean of fears
Maybe this is the last time
I see your face
The last hours you are mine
I fell from grace
Go on. make your last goodbye
I burned his home, his family
I killed his kids
No. this was never meant to be
I told you lies
I make you pay for what you've done
This is not the end. the fire's the light in the night
I wanna hold you
Nothing really matters for me except your belief
Please don't fear me

Yes, I lied to you. to him and I lied to myself
But I love you
If I have to go, I will drown in this ocean of fears
Be my light in the night
The hate that I feel now is based upon the love I have lost
Take my pain away
feelings I once had got lost inside your fire of hate
You destroyed me
Go and throw yourself into this endless ocean of tears
There's no savior
Just two further souls away from God's heaven
Be my light in the night

Feel me
Touch me
Take it all from me
Love me
Hold me
Please be by my side
Curse me
Hate me
Take it all from me
Despise me
Destroy me
See you in hell

Once I have been told
That love's the key
In a world of no compassion
But what means love
Based upon hate and lies
What's the meaning of forever?
I will try, yes I'm gonna try.
To forgive all of you
Still I do not know
What to do with my fear
With my tears and my anger

This is not the end, the fire's the light in the night
I wanna hold you
Nothing really matters for me except your belief
Please don't fear me
Yes. I lied to you. to him and I lied to myself
But I love you
If I have to go. I will drown in this ocean of fears
Be my light in the night

The hate that I feel now is based upon the love I have lost
Take my pain away
Feelings I once had got lost inside your fire of hate
You destroyed me
Go and throw yourself into this endless ocean of tears
