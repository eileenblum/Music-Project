Love - so rare, so pure
I found in you
I lied. I tried
To hold you
Now I'm forced to change
Our destiny
I do. I will
I die for you

Love - so rare, so pure
I found in you
I lied, I tried
To hold you
Now Iâm forced to change
Our destiny
I do, I will
I die for you

Blind faith and trust I had in you
All the time, though you lied to me until tonight
Is there no other way to go than to die?
Is your past the same as our future?
Time that I leave you
May heaven have mercy with me
Still I'm looking for belief, for hope
Compassion in your eyes
Our world is now ending
Heaven breaks down here and now
there is something in our heart
remaining, hope it stays alive
Thoughts of you and me and
His family
They haunt, they hurt
Eternally
Take my hand this time

This very last time
No tears, no pain
I die for you
Blind faith and trust I had in you
All the time, though you lied to me until tonight
Is there no other way to go than to die?
Is your past the same as our future?

Time that I leave you
May heaven have mercy with me
Still I'm looking for belief, for hope
Compassion in your eyes
Our world is now ending
feelings break down here and now
there is something in our heart
remaining, hope it stays alive

I took your love, you take my life
Into this ocean now I dive
Maybe you're right, maybe we're wrong
But I hope my love stays strong
If you think ever back of me
Feel my love now that you're free
May heaven listen when I pray
Then itâs a place where you will stay

Blind faith and trust I had in you
All the time, though you lied to me until tonight
Is there no other way to go than to die?
Is your past the same as our future?
Now it's time that I leave you
May heaven have mercy with me
Still Iâm looking for belief, for hope
Compassion in your eyes
Our world is now ending
heaven breaks down just right here
there is something in our heart
remaining, hope it stays alive
