Look at my face
Touch my scars now
Revealing the truth
Of your love that's the devil itself

This can't be true
This must be a lie
Stop defamation
Stop this madness
Where are you now?
Can't hold back my tears
I am to blame
For all that's yet to come

For all the pain that I suffered from
I make you suffer even more and more
Except your pretty little dirty slut
Is coining to save you now
Oh yes. she will come
And she will regret
Yes. she will come
And beg for forgiveness

Only the wind and the oceans know
All those lies and pain and true love
Deep in my heart where the fire burns
Love is stronger - pain is powerful
Tear down the walls, listen to your heart
Maybe the truth lies down on ocean's ground
Fear in your eyes, please believe in me
Do my dreams tell me the truth?

If you'd only hold me one more time
I will die for you my love
Beat me. kill me - I won't care
We'll meet again in hell
This time your friends can't help you
I'm taking my revenge
This time only you and me, girl
Someone will burn
No no
I find you
No no
I kill you
No no
Destroy you
No no
I make you burn!
Only the wind and the oceans know
All those lies and pain and true love

Deep in my heart where the fire burns
Love is stronger - pain is powerful
Tear down the walls, listen to your heart
Maybe the truth lies down on oceanâs ground
Fear in your eyes, please believe in me
Do my dreams tell me the truth?

So many times that I have dreamed of this one
moment
So many times I asked myself what I would do
I have never been a criminal till now
My family is dead and gone
No way out. there is only one solution left
It's you or me or no one at all

So here I am. tell me what to do?
What is your plan? Is it me or you?
Leave this place, babe, do not trust him
Go away, just save yourself
I will die for you, my promise
In heaven we will meet again

Listen to my words
Only one way left to go
You musf go off board
Wash away your sins
Take your life for him
If you do, I let him go
Wash away your sins
Regret what you have done
This is our final moment
The beginning or the end
What can I do?
I betrayed you all
I deserve this
But can't live without you

Only the wind and the oceans know
All those lies and pain and true love
Deep in my heart where the fire burns
Love is stronger - pain is powerful
Tear down the walls, listen to your heart
Maybe the truth lies down on ocean's ground
Fear in your eyes, please believe in me
Do my dreams tell me the truth?
