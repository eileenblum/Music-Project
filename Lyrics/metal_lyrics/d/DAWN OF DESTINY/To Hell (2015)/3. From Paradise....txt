I hold you in my arms
I whisper in your ear
I want to save this moment
We are here together.
When I look into your eyes
And think of our past cries
I am so proud of everything that
We both have reached.

Don't need no other world
Don't need nobody hurt
Our loneliness and sorrow
Wiped away by true love.

If this would be our end
I'm sure not to pretend
This is the greatest moment
God has ever given me.

Love remains strong
Even death ain't able to make it wrong
The world is silent now
And paradise is not far away.

These moments full of bliss,
We sealed it with a kiss
I won't imagine that this life
Is gonna change soon.

Must feelings soon collide?
Already in this night?
There is a darkness that surrounds
The world we live in.

Love remains strong
Even death ain't able to make it wrong
The world is silent now
And paradise is not far away.

Even death ain't able to make it wrong
The world is silent now
And paradise is not far away.
