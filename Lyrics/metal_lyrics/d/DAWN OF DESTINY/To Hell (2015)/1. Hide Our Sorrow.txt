Happened beyond the native climes so far away
A story written with fire
Slowly on our way into the sunset
The ship stays calm and silent

I hope you never guess my secret

Those dreams will tell their own amazing story
It seems there is something wrong
Faster- we're on our way into the future
This moment seems so perfect

I hope you never know my secret

Just the sky is witnessing
The ocean hides our lies
There is hope and it's resting in tomorrow
Our lives are based upon true lies
The past lives on and on
We are the ones who hide our sorrow

I hope you never know my secret

Just the sky is witnessing
The ocean hides our lies
There is hope and it's resting in tomorrow
Our lives are based upon true lies
The past lives on and on
We are the ones who hide our sorrow

With every lie our image crumbles down
With every secret you slip further away
With each regret I try to get close to you
If we could only let our love decide

Just the sky is witnessing
The ocean hides our lies
There is hope and it's resting in tomorrow
Our lives are based upon true lies
The past lives on and on
We are the ones who hide our sorrow

Just the sky is witnessing
The ocean hides our lies
There is hope and it's resting in tomorrow
Our lives are based upon true lies
The past lives on and on
We are the ones who hide our sorrow
