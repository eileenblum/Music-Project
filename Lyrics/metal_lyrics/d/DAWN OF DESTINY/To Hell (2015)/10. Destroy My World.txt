Here I stand, broken and alone
You took it all from me
And I know I must blame myself
But please keep him out

Love, only love has saved our world
Can love now save your life?
Hate, only hate brought me here
Will hate destroy my world?

What should I do? Who can rescue us?

There seems to be one way
Yes, I deserve this, me all alone
But please keep him out

Love, only love can save this world
Can love now save your life?
Hate, only hate brought me here
Will hate destroy my world?
