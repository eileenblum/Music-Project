Without a voiceBut still so much to sayAll that my eyes do recognize Hoping, longing for someoneTo take away my pain Without a tongueBut still I'd like to screamTo all people yet remaining deaf Hoping, longing for someoneTo take away my pain Take one look at this silent sufferingSee me standing here in lonelinessDecadence of a heart Walk with meJust a while to feel my dreams insideLook at meAnd see this aching heart of mine I'd like to know who is to blameWhat you have done, it is a shameAnd in the end we're all aloneAlways alone we have to roam Take one look at this silent sufferingSee me standing here in lonelinessDecadence of a heartTake one look at this silent sufferingSee me standing here in lonelinessDecadence of a heart Without a speechBut I still want you to hearMy silence speaks louder than your words Hoping, longing for someoneTo take away my pain Take one look...Decadence of a heart... Take one look at this silent sufferingSee me standing here in lonelinessDecadence of a heartTake one look at this silent sufferingSee me standing here in lonelinessDecadence of a heart
