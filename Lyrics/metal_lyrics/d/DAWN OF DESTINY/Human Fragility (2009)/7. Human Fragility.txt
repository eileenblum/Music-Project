Who decides about morality?
Who deserves our loyalty?

We agonise what could be the right way
...the right way
...the right way
...the right way
...the right way

In a world of prejudices,
fear, hate, racism and pain

We close the book too soon
Even if we do not know the end of the story

Do we have the right?
To decide what's wrong or right?
Mortal still we are
Despairing of our own fragility

What would you do
if you have the choice?
Witch live is worth more?
Can you compare a criminal to a saint?
What makes a saint so holy?
It's not about eye to eye
It's not about telling a lie

Do we have the right?
To decide what's wrong or right?
Mortal still we are
Despairing of our own fragility

There is a reason for everything we do
Are we all alone in the end?

We are born with many questions
We will die with so many more
Mankind is a great phenomenon
With deeds so incomprehensible

We should be more than animals
With our abilities, our mind
We abuse God gave to us
instead of being grateful for it all

Do we have the right?
To decide what's wrong or right?
Mortal still we are
Despairing of our own fragility

Do we have the right?
To decide what's wrong or right?
Mortal still we are
Despairing of our own fragility
