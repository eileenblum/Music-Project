Out of the slavery
To worship God freely
Moses will lead them back
Away from Pharaoh's realm

But he refuses to let the people go
They shall remain his slaves forevermore

Miraculous sign of warning
To convince Egypt
Israelite slaves to free
The only way to be

No reaction to the warning God has send to him

I am the Pharaoh
You have to obey
No one will leave
You all gotta stay

Ten plagues will cover Egypt
Still you have the choice
God will show his power to your land
If you don't free all the slaves

Blood
All the waters turn to blood
and the Nile is painted red
Frogs
Overrunning Egypt land
Still the curse can be removed

Gnats, fleas, flies, wild animals
Still they do have to stay
Pestilence
All the horses had to die

Free the people, free them all
Free the people, free them all

Ten plagues will cover Egypt
Still you have the choice
God will show his power to your land
If you don't free all the slaves

Ten plagues will cover Egypt
Still you have the choice
God will show his power to your land
If you don't free all the slaves

Boils, storms and locusts
torturing Egypt soon
Darkness covers the land
And still they had to stay

After death of all first born males
And all those cries
Pharaoh let them leave out of the slavery

Ten plagues will cover Egypt
Still you have the choice
God will show his power to your land
If you don't free all the slaves

Ten plagues will cover Egypt
Still you have the choice
God will show his power to your land
If you don't free all the slaves
