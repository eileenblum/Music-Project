And the leaves were falling down and pride turns into bloodWhen reason turned the other wayWhen moments turn to years and no fire has a sparkWhen all the good's at once stained Two eyes were closed not to hopeFacing the wicked without fearWhen arms of good fell into sorrowThere is always a reason to stay here But beats that heart so strongCan it prove they have been wrong? One heart of torment, ache and agonySo much compassion, its own miseryOne heart of love, joy, sympathy but painOne single sunray in this world of rain Feeling strongNot strong enoughAll they wantRemaining toughThey will take your sonThe will hunt you every dayThey don't know your GodAnd they will kill you anyway Better leave this placeRun away from here There is no other wayNothing's left to believe in One heart of torment, ache and agonySo much compassion, its own miseryOne heart of love, joy, sympathy but painOne single sunray in this world of rain There is no other wayNothing is left to believe inAll that we ever learnedSeems not to fit in this world One heart of torment, ache and agonySo much compassion, its own miseryOne heart of love, joy, sympathy but painOne single sunray in this world of rainOne heart of torment, ache and agony...One heart of love, joy, sympathy but painOne single sunray in this world of rain
