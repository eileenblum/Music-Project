There is one thing you can't deny
Some call it true, and some a lie

Something so hard to find in one life
Something that we knew all need some
Just for the way your heart tries to show
And one day you are gonna know

We do it on and on again
Don't even know how it began
For love we bleed, for love we die
We have to prove it ain't a lie

If there is a thing called destiny
Tell me how some things can be
A feeling deep inside I feel
For whom is this real?

This feeling should give us the right
To be honest, to make it right
Still we hurt the ones we love
And cry for help from above

When it's gone, the power has died
Yet harder each time, we've gotta fight

We do it on and on again
Don't even know how it began
For love we bleed, for love we die
We have to prove it ain't a lie
[2x]

With every love that dies
And all our screams and cries
We still keep holding on and on
We will suppress all rules
And might betray ourselves for love
We will not be here alone

We do it on and on again
Don't even know how it began
For love we bleed, for love we die
We have to prove it ain't a lie
[3x]
