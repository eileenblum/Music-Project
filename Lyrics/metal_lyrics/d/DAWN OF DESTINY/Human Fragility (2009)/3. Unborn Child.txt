The king's gonna die soonYes, he will be replacedBut he has an offspringOne final act to come Not gonna be a happy questHalf his kingdom's very poorSo hope rests on this childThat's not born yet What will it take to be our savior?Abandoned, much too heavy to carry And so they prayFor the unborn childTo lead them out of misery They all will fall aloneNo way they do not knowEven if it leads to insanity There will be blood, and each child, his tearsNo time for being helpless as it seems This is the burden of this unborn destined childIt's his fate to save his landAnd they all pray for a new kingdom to comeAnd their hope will die at last No one ever dares to doubt his force Have faith and knowIf his son will showA new kingdom comeA new world to come This is the burden of this unborn destined childIt's his fate to save his landAnd they all pray for a new kingdom to comeAnd their hope will die at lastThis is the burden of this unborn destined childIt's his fate to save his landAnd they all pray for a new kingdom to comeAnd their hope will die at last
