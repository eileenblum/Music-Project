I've chosen this book
I'm taking a look
on all my experiences
I am satisfied
Life has not been a fight
But somehow something is missing

Did not suffered from diseases
But my heart yearns for more

Still I am all alone
After all those lonesome years
Yes I am so afraid
I am scared of dying alone

I have wasted too much time
with things that are not worthy

I was looking for love
But my quest comes to an end
I gotta stay alone

With all the money I have made
I was never satisfied
No one ever has been there
to show me real love

to show me real love

Still I am all alone
After all those lonesome years
Yes I am so afraid
I am scared of dying alone

Still I am all alone
After all those lonesome years
Yes I am so afraid
I am scared of dying alone

I have wasted too much time
with things that are not worthy

I was looking for love
But my quest comes to an end
I gotta stay alone
