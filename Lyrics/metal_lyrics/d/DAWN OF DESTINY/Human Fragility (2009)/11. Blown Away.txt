One last wordOne last teardrop fallOne last mistakeOne burning heart Do you know what to do?Do you know what to fear? Everything we ever learnedAnd everything we ever taughtThere is no more hand in handThere is not just one last final stand We bite the hand that feed usNo one will ever need usMaybe everything has been a lie Up in the heaven, just sit there and watchEverything that we have done wrongAs you will drop that final bomb to the earthYes we deserve to be blown away One last kissOne last embraceOne last goodbyeOne last dying soul Do you know what to do?Do you know what to fear? The conclusion of all thisThe destruction of our raceWe never learn, we never willWe are the ones that you can kill We bite the hand that feed usNo one will ever need usMaybe everything has been a lie Up in the heaven, just sit there and watchEverything that we have done wrong(Drop the bomb)As you will drop that final bomb to the earthYes we deserve to be blown away We bite the hand that feed usNo one will ever need usMaybe everything has been a lie Up in the heaven, just sit there and watchEverything that we have done wrong(Drop the bomb)As you will drop that final bomb to the earthYes we deserve to be blown awayUp in the heaven, just sit there and watchEverything that we have done wrong(Drop the bomb)As you will drop that final bomb to the earthYes we deserve to be blown awayUp in the heaven, just sit there and watchEverything that we have done wrong(Drop the bomb)As you will drop that final bomb to the earthYes we deserve to be blown away
