On a dark, cold, rainy Friday night
Her eyes are open wide
Her pain's reborn, with no longer will to fight
See the struggle within her eyes
It reveals her disguise
A look in the mirror, it tells all her lies

What if everything is lost?
What's left to dream
If there's no one you could trust

Now she's standing at the window
Her arms are open wide
And she feels the winter nights
She's learning to fly
Learning to fly

All doors are locked
The keys have gone away
And hope vanishes in haze
She is now learning, learning to fly
Heaven receives her with open arms

Now she's standing at the window
Her arms are open wide
And she feels the winter nights
She's learning to fly
Learning to fly

Now she's standing at the window
Her arms are open wide
And she feels the winter nights
She's learning to fly
Learning to fly...
