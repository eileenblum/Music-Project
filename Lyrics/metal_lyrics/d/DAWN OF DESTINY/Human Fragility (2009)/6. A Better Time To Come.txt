I'm left confused and lost with my hands so full of sorrow
Felt like the loneliest human in this goddamned world
They told me that soon I'm gonna die
There's no cure for me, only days remain to say goodbye
I should lay down to rest, to sleep and wake to die
No one can take away my pain

They hope and pray for me
And try to hard to make me see
A new world will await
A better time to come
They hope and pray for me
And try to hard to make me see
A new world will await
A better time to come

As my tears fall to earth
There is nothing left
That they have for me
Just compassion and words
That I cannot hear
I'm left alone

What should I do
In these days that still remain
Just a battle of my pride
If I should lose, I'd go insane

I have to struggle
And take the end
I have to lose

They hope and pray for me
And try to hard to make me see
A new world will await
A better time to come
They hope and pray for me
And try to hard to make me see
A new world will await
A better time to come
They hope and pray for me
And try to hard to make me see
A new world will await
A better time to come

As my tears fall to earth
There is nothing left
That they have for me
Just compassion and words
That I cannot hear
I'm left alone

As my tears fall to earth
There is nothing left
That they have for me
Just compassion and words
That I cannot hear
I'm left alone
