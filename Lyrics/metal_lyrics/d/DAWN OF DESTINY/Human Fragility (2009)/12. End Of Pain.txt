Never knew I could fly that high
Touch the sky with desire
Never knew I could fall that deep
From heaven into the fire

Once this heart was strong
Have been waiting for so long

Never knew that I could run that fast
From here to the end of the world
Never knew how slowly I've to crawl
Standing still without motion

Once this heart was strong
Have been waiting for so long

We have to struggle and we hope for the end of pain
Close to the end we climbed so high, we will go insane

It might take, a lifetime
To understand, the meaning of it all
Still this is such, a strange world
We must fit in there to survive

Once this heart was strong
Have been waiting for so long

We have to struggle and we hope for the end of pain
Close to the end we climbed so high, we will go insane
