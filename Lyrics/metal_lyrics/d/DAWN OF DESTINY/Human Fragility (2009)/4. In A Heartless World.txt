Sorrow lies beyond
And pain rules our life
When one heart feels joy
The other one bleeds

We all are insecure and sad
Our humanity drives us mad

We are born in a heartless world
We are trapped in a nightmare, no escape
To survive is against the odds
No one dares to break these chains for all

Feel what my heart feels
The fear, the hate, the pain
For love, there is no place
This feeling we'll destroy

No one ever will open first aid case
And all our hopes and dreams vanish into haze

We are born in a heartless world
We are trapped in a nightmare, no escape
To survive is against the odds
No one dares to break these chains for all

And still the time is going on and on and on
Soon we have done it all and there'll be no one left

We are born in a heartless world
We are trapped in a nightmare, no escape
To survive is against the odds
No one dares to break these chains for all
