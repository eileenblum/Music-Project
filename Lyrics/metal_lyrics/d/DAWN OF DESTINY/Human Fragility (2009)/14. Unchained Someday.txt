If nothing changes I see all my chances passing by If only I could close my eyesAnd the whole world's goneIf nobody could see my disguiseAnd realize I'm wrong I'd like to shut the doorLeave all trouble behindClosing it all to the coreAnd finding peace of mind If nothing changes I see all my chances passing byHas everything I learned so far all been called a lie?Yes I tried to make it right for you, for everyoneDeep inside I see myself, I ain't that strong Maybe I will be unchained someday... Living with principlesI made so long agoLiving in chainsThat I don't want to showLiving with painBut I cannot let goLiving in sorrowWhen will I say... no? Forever haunting memoriesNever fulfilling dreams I have to break freeAnd make myself see If nothing changes I see all my chances passing byHas everything I learned so far all been called a lie?Yes I tried to make it right for you, for everyoneDeep inside I see myself, I ain't that strongIf nothing changes I see all my chances passing byHas everything I learned so far all been called a lie?Yes I tried to make it right for you, for everyoneDeep inside I see myself, I ain't that strongIf nothing changes I see all my chances passing byHas everything I learned so far all been called a lie?Yes I tried to make it right for you, for everyoneDeep inside I see myself, I ain't that strongIf nothing changes I see all my chances passing by
