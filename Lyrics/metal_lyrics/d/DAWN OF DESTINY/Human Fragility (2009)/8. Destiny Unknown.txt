Fear - of unknown things
Is crawling deep inside us
Hate - for other men
Arises without reason
No one on this earth was born viciously
What makes a man running wild?
Pain - they may not feel
They die with all their pride
Glory - for their deeds
And not one single tear
No one on this earth was born viciously
What makes a man running wild?
What have they done
when they were young?
Playing in the sand without a gun

Watch the children play
You know their destiny's unknown
They won't ever tell lies
No sorrow in their eyes
Their innocence is clearly shown
Why can it not be saved?

All those weird leaders
who try to split the world
They have been a little child as well
They fight for their religion or at least
that's what they say
Fanatic bigotry and all this hate they shed

Jews, Christs and Muslim
Together's just a dream
Struggling everywhere
Nothing's left to share

Watch the children play
You know their destiny's unknown
They won't ever tell lies
No sorrow in their eyes
Their innocence is clearly shown
Why can it not be saved?

Tears without an eye
A truth within a lie
All the cowards spilling blood they hide
without shame
Is this the way they dreamed their life?

Do they still remember times
they never felt hate?
Did they reach the point of no return?

What have they done
when they were young?
Playing in the sand without a gun

Watch the children play
You know their destiny's unknown
They won't ever tell lies
No sorrow in their eyes
Their innocence is clearly shown
Why can it not be saved?
