Do you hear me?
Can you touch my shade?
Do you feel my wretchedness?
My arrant fall of faith

Do you hear me...?
Do you hear...?
Do you feel me...?

"I can hear you
I can feel your shade
Let me ease my passing
and the torment that was made
Let me caress your heart
and disentangle your utter grief
Let me unfetter the dreams
in which you once believed"
