Now, who leads the way
With all the gods astray
Through this bitter times
of sorrow and dreadful dismay?

Now, shall we never see
else than blinding lights of creed
Is there more than this pestilence,
this appalling decadence?

"We will lead the way
Blow these gods astray
Break our chains
Break this wall
come Deliverance of the Fall"

"With eyes that gape at darkness
one can never see the day,
a day of starvation,
a day of slavery,
a day some wish to see."
