Bring me down,
down to the ground.
There is a kingdom I have found
within the soil, in this turmoil.
To kill the creed.
To make me free.

Souls to save and Lives to save
from their lies that enslave
A final call for freedom
For a better day
As we cut the throat
to these Kings of Treason
For we are the blade that
carves our way through the time.
