Sane obsession of Golden Bliss, of Ecstasy
To wash His face, to see it beaten clean

Leave the face of flawed disgrace,
It's hope you need to save
embarrassment, indignity
resides in the hearts of brave

And I do remember I've been here before
standing 'gainst the mountain
of Praise, Admiration and of Scorn

And I know I've been there before
venerating the depraved in pulchritude adorned
And I still remember I've been there before
Took that final step of hell servitude reborn

There's a weakness no requital, no enmity
Frail we've fallen down in utter empathy
