Today we know The Day has come
when Consternation falls
Today we wait into the Morning
Tear down the Walls!

So, this is The World they couldn't utter
We've been given the Voice of Reason
Now, why did they stutter?

No more! Your Voice is free!

It's a Trial &amp; Tribulation
Years of sorrow and lamentation

Once proud, once unbeaten
The Kings have died, their Hearts were eaten
Sisters scorned, brethren beaten
Put to blame by laws unwritten
Such shame when Truth can't make it's way
It's a Trial &amp; Tribulation
Years of sorrow and lamentation
What we've done for our eyes to see
What we've done to set our Voices free
A Thralldom Decree

Today we stand
Today we cannot fall
Today the Will is strong
