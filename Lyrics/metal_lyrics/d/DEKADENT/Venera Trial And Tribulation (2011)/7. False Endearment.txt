With agony and pain
I realize that all I've struggled for
was all in vain

I've seen the signs, 'stood the facts
Justified my shameful acts
of Prudence and Endearment
that was false

Tried to share the warmth and care
my Passion, my worship
that was false

Heart pains of blood filled with deceit
Affection buried, yet still burns deep
beneath...My Skin

I must be strong
must carry on
must leave it all behind me
tho' can't comprehend it's bitter end

But truly now it's gone
It has been killing me for far too long
For far too long
