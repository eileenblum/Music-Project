Fears of shallow existence
strayed me toward the Emptiness
Never know the Difference
Never know the Truth
Craven in Wretchedness

Following The Shadow
The unrestrained Darkness

Dwelled in ignorance
until the Mornings of Hate
greeted that vile Face
No treason, no shame
No awful disgrace

Lost among these conclusions
amidst the flesh so craven
Cannot shout "vidim"
Cannot stand beyond this carnal
Beyond earthly, vacant shell

Still I cower, still I beseech,
"Come Redemption!"
Throw me beyond this chasm
of undivided twilight

High Consecration above me
As Illumina's thwarting The Night
This immurement of conception
of existence and reality

Fears of shallow existence
strayed me toward the Emptiness
Never know the Difference
Never know the Truth
craven in Wretchedness

...And Fallen I've taken your Sign,
and Fallen I've taken your Light
of treason and poisoned mind

I'm Fallen, I abandoned my pride
And Fallen I've let out my cries
but never have taken your Side
