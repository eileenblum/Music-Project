Fear and detestation, acute suffering
Tied in exploitation, burning from within

kept away from Retribution
no Equity befell
Time can never heal the wounds
It can't erase this Hell

Loathed, despised by the loved that could not see
The Face and anemic Heart, slain from agony
Dressed in Tears, with Death in Hand
turned and ran away, Confident in Misery
In Darkness did content

Lashed by emotion, harrowed day by day
Spit into the Face of Gods, with thirst for their Decay
Cry upon the decadent, upon the harrowed Life
Clamor loud in discontent, to end this Timeless Strife
