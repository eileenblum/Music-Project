The Sky awaits your Day of Solace
Our day of hands entwined
Your face awaits the Touch of Solace
That calms your restless mind

The scent of dew
I know it's there
It's You

Each passing day
Behind that Wall
It's You

Now what do you feel
when you're far from here
Where is your Heart
Where falls your Tear
Doubt and despair shall
hamper and stew your soul
Rise! Say "No"!
Say "No"! Cry your Denial!
For icons forlorn
must not be reborn

Death to all!
