Everyday seclusion
And Providential Love
The emotional intrusion
it's hauling me above
desolation and torture!

We knew we were face to
face, one unto Another
We knew we were true
Disgrace, yeah, we were other
kind of Scullions to
Emotional Alliance
Bound to stray from
the rituals of fatuous,
in Defiance

Beneath the realm
of unawareness we cling
to the Arms of Affection
There is no law
There is no sense
No other form of implication
when facing rejection

Everyday seclusion
and vindictive deeds
The emotional illusion
is casting us beneath
Elation
