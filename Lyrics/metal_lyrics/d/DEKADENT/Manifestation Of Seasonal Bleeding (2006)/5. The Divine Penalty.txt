There were Lights in the Dark
and the Summer warmed the Air
There's a Whisper of a broken Dream
of Anger and Despair

Was this meant for me? Was there anything to see?
Was this meant to be?
What I want from me is something i can't be
I will be Shadow of my Mind, Hidden and Unseen

Now, who is calling me?
These Days of Darkness have Light
that I can not see
Am i shouting Anger and Despair to deaf Ears?

I have a Shadow on my Mind, it's Hidden and Unseen

What do you want from me?
Am I serving The Divine Penalty?
It's twisting inside of me
Is it a Demon Soul yearning to be free?
