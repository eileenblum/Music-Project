It is the Summer of your Life
Passing it remembering your Fears
When no one missed you,
When you've been Down There
When you've been fighting for all those Years
It is no other than you who sees you
Your Sole Confider is an Empty Wall
Who could hear you, who'd you cry to?
Who would want to hear your desperate Call?

It is only silent shouting me
You are out of Light in Misery

It is the Summer of your Life
You are sending Smiles
like you would not care
It is all pretension
no one knows for
You fight the Years
which you can not hear

It is only silent shouting me
You are out of Light in Misery

Solo acting your Drama
A Prime Play of Agony
This is your Final Appearance
You are out of Light
and you can't see

Death was never your Option
Death was not something you feared
It is hatred that is gnawing inside you
It never disappeared

Why would you want to remember?
What do you want to learn?

Can you hear the silent shouting me?
I am running out of Light - Out of Misery
in search of a Darkened Sun
Towards Dreams of Eternal Liberty
we were on the shore ...
