We were on the shore
And the winds of change were blowing
The sun was burning high above

We were on the shore
Our blood into the ocean flowing
We drowned our bodies in the sign of love

No pretension was needed
It was all so sincere
Changing minds no further
We've ended our fear

We were on the shore
We knew no god was watching
We knew that we were all alone

We were on the shore
We knew there was nothing
We awaited our final dawn

No comprehension was needed
Our dream was turning surreal
We granted each other a contented smile
This wound finally made us feel

It was all just a dream
Of an unconsolidated mind
A dream i need to find

It was all just a dream
A non-committed crime
A mean play of a tired mind
Washing the sand of time

We were on the shore
We were on the edge of the world
These dreams i need to find
I am on the edge of my mind

We were on the shore
We were on the edge of the world
