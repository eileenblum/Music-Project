[Music: Elisa C. Martin, Albert Maroto, Lyrics: Elisa C. Martin]

Silence is clouding your fat will decide your death
You're crying and dying alone
Deciding... to live or not
Flames burning in your mind
A hell you like to hide
The show will be the end of your suicide
Another path you'll find
To escape this rite inside
World full of gods
-Today I don't know you-
Now, you can't smile
-But it doesn't matter-
Emotions.... your emotions are lost
Passion... passion is gone!
All the world is moving so fast
And your dreams are still in the past
Oh! Can you hear the call
Offering you my soul?
Please now, believe in me
Don't left yourselve down
The moon is high on you
The light is breaking through
A whisper in the air
Reminding that you were born
"Still I feel so lost...
I've got nothing left to say
Just take me away"
