[Music: Albert Maroto, Lyrics: Elisa C. Martin]

When I pray
I kneel down in front of you
And I think....
Where are you? I can't see you
And I feel so weak
I don't trust your white tears
Have you left me now?
You were never with me...
It's alright to make mistakes
I'm only human
The mortal one
Who lives fulfilling your laws, no thanks!
I would like to ask you God
When I die where I should go?
Into ashes will my soul turn?
Where is your blue paradise?
If there's an eternal life...
Why don't you bring this life here?
Born to die
This sensation is so strange
Born to die
To live fulfilling your laws... no thanks!
If you want, I'll try to save you
But to save me from all your lies?
You've always believed in my truth
In your stupid Holy Bible
Also in your famous saying
"I am the path, the truth and the life"
Everything you say I distrust
Can you prove me now that you are real?
