[Music: Albert Maroto, Lyrics: Elisa C. Martin]

I will look for the perfection
Making your sweet heart smile again
The simple things as the raindrops
Give a new sense to this place
Our feet don't touch the floor
Our minds feeling the call
There's something wild
If we cross the door
We'll never stop
Take me higher give me your hand
As the fire we'll rise again
You're falling asleep inside of me
Shaking your wings
There are no words only our breath
When winds take the forest in their paws
Universe is as still as all my bones
In the spiral we made
Around the fire today
Tell me why should I cry for you?
Music in the air
Your blood is flowing for me
Take me higher making me dream
