[Music: Albert Maroto, Lyrics: Elisa C. Martin]

Lord of your war
Don't you try to lie to us
Are you God?
This world's not in your hands
You choke our voice
You poison our minds
You shed their blood on mankind
And you force us to kill once again
To kill again...
Tell me if you'll bleed on our side
But... until your last sigh...
Is your army ready to attack?
Die! I don't want to die
You know? My flag is white
Tell me "Blind-Man"
What are you seeking in our minds?
We'll turn against you
In this war that you began
We want a future
Without madness, nor distrust
No! You can't hide
You'll be the first to leave us
Antichrist!
You're the preacher of war
We hear your legions marching on us
Our pride won't fall to the ground
Though you'll step on our tears
While you sing a stupid hymn
