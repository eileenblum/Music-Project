[Music: Albert Maroto, Nino Ruiz, Lyrics: Elisa C. Martin ]

If I could trace your voice
If I could be in your mind
To know what I did to you
To know why you do all that
You have fallen down so far...
You'll never see the light
Only I'll try to understand
Why you hate all that I am?
Look down into your spite
Can you see your face
Watching me with hatred eyes?
Just in silence I can hear your words
Tearing my life only when I'm not
And this silence gathered all my tears
I'm wide awake into something real
I opened my arms for you
And I tried to be true
But you're against me
Who are you?
Now I really can't understand
What has happened in your head
I live in a reverse universe
It's too late to change my mind
I don't want to waste my time
It's just time to pay the price
For the hurt that you have done
The world seems to disappear
But you're shaking me up
