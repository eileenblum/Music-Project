[Music:Albert Maroto, Lyrics: Elisa C. Martin]

Shaded death, I feel you close to me
Drags me with the violence of the sea
Up to the deepest lonely ocean
Crushing my forgotten emotions
Out of here I'll be a stranger
I'll feel the bows of a sure danger
And I won't, won't think about death
There's no god. It's the end...
I wish I dreamt of you
I wish to feel you
I wanna touch you now!
I learnted to live in dreams
So close the pain I dream
My freedom will not hang
From your thorns... anymore!
A sweet sigh of your breath close to me forever
Today I can say that I'm frear than ever
Enclosed, enclosed, enclosed...
A tear in a corner of my eye
Witness of my sacrifice
I'm yearning to follow my silence
I'm falling in a soul of madness
It's time to leave this place far behind
I'll just remember all the good times
