[Music: Albert Maroto, Lyrics: Elisa C. Martin]

I can't explain all my emotions
And I don't like to speak of myself
But I guess that is the way
The only way
To know what I want to say
Tell me now what you think about me
Tell me what are you seeing
Lie down by me, feel it with me
All my fears here you will see
I am afraid of my own mind
I'm scared but I'm alive
I will leave this life to die
Why do you call to say good-bye?
It's so easy for you to break my life...
I have to speak if I don't want to
And then you say that I am like ice
I am what I am, I'm tired and bored
But I will last on my own
'Cause I want to know...
I will simply tell you all the truth
My heart will see you through
Beating so near... Living in fear
Only needs to disappear...
