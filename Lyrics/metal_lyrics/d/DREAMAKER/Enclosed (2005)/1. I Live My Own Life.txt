[Music: Albert Maroto, Lyrics: Elisa C. Martin]

If you tell me that I can't
I will, I will, I'll try...
If I say that I will do it
I'll do it when I want...
I control... I control my world
I live beyond the dreams
Don't overwhelm me
Why you cut my wings?
This soul you think you own
Wants to break the walls
You try to control my mind
Why do you do it?
I don't want to be like you
'Cause I'm feeling free
In my world I live without walls
Deciding who I am
Looking for my place
Freedom in my hands
Don't wanna fight no more
You should know that...
I live my own life
Don't try to stop me!
Don't make me waist time
'Cause I am my own guide
I don't do the right things
But it doesn't matter
I don't want to be like you
I live my own life
Understand... Try to understand
That I am who I am
You know me so well
I'm not gonna change
I've never been your doll
You should know that...
