[Music: Albert Maroto, Lyrics: Elisa C. Martin]

If I had it in my power...
If I could remain here...
Every minute, every hour
To leave knowing that I will return again
To return dreaming that I'll never go away
I'm a lost and scared hunter
But I chose this tortuous way
'Cause it's me and it's my life
I don't want to make mistakes
Your voice reminds me now that I'm alive
When you call me and say to me that all is fine
But now I miss the silence of the night
And the calmness of the sun
Sometimes I feel so far away from home
So far away from my life
Never felt this way before
Everytime I feel so far away from your love
Small things that become details
Now you have to let me go
Every second's like an hour
Every hour's like a day
I'll feel for the last time desire
And I'll turn and run away
If you think that I am strong
You are wrong!
'Cause I need my simple life
A piece of this world...
