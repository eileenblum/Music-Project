You! My nightmare
You! My black air
Without blame I was betrayed
I feel the rage
As a wild gale
Biting all my lanes
I'll tell you bye! With a hand
In my face a big smile
Revenge has begun...
A sea of hate surrounds me
You thrust a dagger on my back
From now on till the end of all times
You! my enemy
Enemy always be...
You don't cross my way because
You are my enemy
Hating your name
Scoring yourself
In your world of lies and shame
I have to fight
And to survive in this game
