When the night falls on my crystal heart
My eyes weigh. I am feeling so tired
But tonight stay away!
I don't have to dream again
He's waiting for me
In the depths of my dreams
I can feel you...You are here!
I'm feeling your breath near of me
I want to run to escape from your claws
I'm afraid, I'm feeling alone
Nightmares Factory
Destroying my dreams
I can not cry
He controls my mind
Nightmares Factory
There is no sun here
Only one friend... the fear
Now the fear is under my skin
I can hear the whisper and the scream
And my bones as the ice
Wants to move my body but
I am petrified, I need to wake up
But he's come to visit me
I want to return and not to sleep
I want to run to escape from your claws
I'm afraid, I'm feeling alone
"Mummy! Are you? Where are you mummy?
I can't see you... please help me mum!
He's near, he wants to catch me!"
...I'm afraid, I am feeling
your breath, your claws...
