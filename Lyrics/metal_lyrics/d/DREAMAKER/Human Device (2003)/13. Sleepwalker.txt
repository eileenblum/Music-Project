[Bonus Track de JapÃ³n]

Spread your wings
This is the sweet key to heaven
You trust in me
Always I'd know that we will together
Don't lie to me, don't make me cry
I want to tell you that I will never hide
Open your eyes, open your eyes...
In your world my place is a lane far away
In the middle of your pride I'll leave this jail
Don't sing to the wind dragging your sadness
I'm building dreams
Walking through my land
I come to rest on your mind
I'd want to live in the past
I'd like to be a lie
I haven't Gods
And I don't understand
How can I live in this lie?
I'd prefer to be the dark
Beyond the moonlight
What can I do?
I can't find the door to madness
I'll wait for you
So I will bleed suffering and torment
Sometimes I fight
Sometimes I die
I want to tell you that I will never hide
Open your eyes, open your eyes...
