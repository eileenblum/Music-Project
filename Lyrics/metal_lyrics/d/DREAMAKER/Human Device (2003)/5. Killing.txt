Two snakes will decide my fate
Always near to my chest
In the middle of this land
In search of a name
I'll not be alone
I can find her dream
If you never lose your hope
Leave a chill, fly to fantasy
And all what you wish will be
Hep me! Now you must help me!
Hear my call...
In the mirror of your dreams
I was born
Hidden in the lines
Is the answer and the child
Read and find the door
This world is real
Under the rain
Flying with you through this tale
Day by day... Cry a new name!
Killing two worlds
Then nothing is evil and touch my soul
Defeat your hope
Tree black gates is feeling my pain
I've to cross it without blame
Help me! Now you must tell me!
Where are you?
Why the night and the twilight
Trust in you?
Then nothing come and touch my soul
Flying with you, killing two worlds
Cry a new name and save the hope
