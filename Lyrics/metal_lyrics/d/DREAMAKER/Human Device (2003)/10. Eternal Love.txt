Today I don't know who I am
An animal with hope
Or a woman without love
Across the seven seas I lived
Too much lives and mysteries
Feeling inside of my heart
All your blood...
I don't want to live into your eyes
We can't fly together
An immortal chain beat my life
While I know that someday you will die
We'll never have eternal love
During the day I crush my dreams
Searching in nowhere
For you... immortality
I don't know where I will go
Time is like a dirty doll
Play with me and make me fall
More and more!
I don't want to live into your eyes
We can't fly together
An immortal chain beat my life
While I know that someday you will die
We can not fly together
We can not live forever
We'll never have eternal love
