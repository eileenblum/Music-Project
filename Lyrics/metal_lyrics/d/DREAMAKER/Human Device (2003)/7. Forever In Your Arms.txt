I sing with my heart fearful of you
And feeling your passion
My eyes free themselves
My throat is free
Run until I fall
Under the sweat that flood my bones
Now, scream for me!
I need your voices without words
Time... time to set out on your flight
To feel myself alive
To live forever in your arms
Time to make you understand
That I only want
To live forever in your arms
When I feel your arms covering me
Only this day is true
Tonight I don't have secrets for you

Now you sing with me
Come! Come and rise your fist
Tonight I want to be among yourselves
The lights on my face
The music fill this day
You press my hand and make me fell so good
If I cry it's for you!
If I sing it's for you!
In my eyes tears and wounds
But you know
that my voice will be forever your...
