[Bonus Track de JapÃ³n]

Down! Is down into the depths
Where you need my help
Where dreams and thoughts
Darkness and fate embrace my soul
Like the wind and the rain
I never meet anyone who really love me
I go alone... walking alone
In the space of your eyes
In the fright of your fall
Suddenly your words
And the sound of your lies
Floods my mind
I'm the sand where lovers walk
I'm the sand where lovers walking alone...
You! You cry! You stir up and shout I love you
How many years with myself telling truths
For no one to listen to me
Now I can live without you...
But embrace me for others times will come
I want to sleep my last dream in your arms
Feeling the wail of your soul
Trusting in the course of all my love
All my love will sing to the wind
With placid tenderness
My voice, my dreams will fly away
The sun dry all my tears
Tears of blood on my face

My thoughts are sweet knowing that in my days
Neither dismay nor spite have a place
Along the winter my heart making me cry
With no wings to fly
But I am free one more time
