Among dusty books my life
Is waiting for a smile
I'm still here with trembling hands
This room is swallowing me, is killing me!
I need to fly and to live
*I'm not afraid of devil or hell*
I need you Lord! I'll do all that you want
Tell me your name and you show me the gate
The darkness come back
The evil command
Slavery you'll find
Don't pray for your soul
Now you are in my home
You have to cross the door
Welcome to my hell
You don't have to be afraid
You'll die another day
But at last you have to pay
My will seil the pact
A droop of your blood
Relive your live
Your soul will be mine, you will be mine...
"do you want to find the light to live forever wild?"
-I want to live other life!
"do you want to pay the price? Forever you will die..."
-I know the sound of the dark!
*He is a spirit that bring you a piece of the dark*
I need you Lord, I'll do all that you want
Tell me your name and you show me the gate

Live this life, this time
I take you with me by my side
Screaming! You're bleeding and feeling
My mind into your head
The death... your cell
So welcome to my hell...
"only for a God's delight in a eternal madness
I will have your sacrifice full of blood and sadness"
