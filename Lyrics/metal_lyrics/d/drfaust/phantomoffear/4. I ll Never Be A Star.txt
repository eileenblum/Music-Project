I hate music that you listen
Don't try tell me about this shit
Stop talk about that bastards
Stop think about that motherfuckers

You never heard my music on the radio
You never saw my music on the MTV
I'll never, never, never be a star

Tell me just 'bout you love and hate
Show me what now you create
I're got only my own words,
I was born to make this fuckin' music

They said that my music is loud
And just thunder, scream and shout
Fuck them all and let'em kiss my ass
I just wanna kill that motherfuckers
