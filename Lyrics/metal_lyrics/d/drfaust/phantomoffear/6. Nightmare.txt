Once I had an awful morbid dream:
In my mind I heard a cry and scream
All at once I saw the witch from hell
All around me start to chime like bell

Terrible dream, cry and scream
I're been so fright
Nowhere to run, nowhere to go, nowhere to hyde

"Can you see my future?" - Then I told
"Do you see me in the crystal ball"
"Yes'-she said-your fate not by, your side
You will die like fuckin suicide

Save or kill because life unreal
Ask yourself-life of death?

I can't stop my nightmare, just can't awake
Evil thoughts has come and creep like snake
I would lost my hope and start to pray:
"Oh, my God! Help me!"-All what I say

[Voice of Angel:]
In the last rays of the setting sun
Retrace your life because the death no fun
It you realy wanna kill youself
Change your mind and you'll prevent your death

[Voice of Luciefer:]
Stop this bullshit cause your life undone
I can help to become your death to fun
Immortal soul doesnt must to fly in the sky
Call my name if you gonna die

So you realy wanna be a dead
Get noose on your neck or bullet on your head
Wellcome in Heaven or see you in hell
Some one will tell me that you dyin as well
So you realy wanna be a dead
Pull the trigger and bullet will break your head
Your life is over, your flesh will decay
But I don'tblame you just walk this way
Sell me your soul before you will die
I would be mercy and help you to die
Nightmare is over and I'm stayin alive
But I'm hearing words that ring in my mind.
