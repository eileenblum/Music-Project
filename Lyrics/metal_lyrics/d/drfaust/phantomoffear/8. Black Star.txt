Latest night I see the light
That shining from the sky
It's the sign I can't deny
Tomorrow I must die

Deadly omen, mortal message
I can't more resist
Take my life but save my soul
It's knock of iron fist

Black Star-Shine a light on me
Black Star-Please don't set me free
Black Star-I can't wait anymore
Black Star-It was never before

Satan's riders came from nowhere
Command my soul in hell
Evil hordes fly like dragons
I don't want stop dwell

Black Star shinin' people people dyin'
It's the end of time
I're got decision in my mission
When I'm first in line
