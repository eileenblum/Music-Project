When night comes dawn he gonna out in the streets
His heart is beating and you feel his body's heat
As a sneaky rattlesnake he is creeping in the dark
He is midnight maniac and he is hungry like a shark

I will fight 'till the day I die
Like I did it before
Fucking killer has no remorse
When he knock's at your door he is breaking the low

He still stalkin' along deserted avenues
Tomorrow you will know about murder from the news
Blood thirsty demon, evil morbid ghost
Develop from the back and brings the gravy frost
