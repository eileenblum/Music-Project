Open your eyes when you're talkin' with devil
Hell fire burning your flesh
He's got no mercy, he's got a power
You are next victim of the thrash

Nuclear fear deadly black horror
Falling from empty blue sky
Don't trade with Satan'don't sacrifice him
Cause if you don't care you will die

Race of war is cannibal holocaust
Death rides now
Dgnorance kills the trust

Million soldiers marchin with weapon
Screamin' the battle cry brave
Stop now the madness, they're not immortal
Cause they march in the grave

Screamin' of vengeance, screamin' of bloodlust
Open the gate of the hell
Don't try survive in the fire of madness
Black Master puts down his spell
