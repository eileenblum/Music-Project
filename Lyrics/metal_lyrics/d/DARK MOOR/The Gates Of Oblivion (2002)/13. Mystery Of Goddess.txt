[bonus track]

You were forced to live in secret
You fled from awful fear
Always hold it to your ear
And the labrys caressing your hands

[Bridge]
With pain and sorrow the fight starts,
I only wish to fade far away

Your worth brings life to me
You're a deity in my dreams
You feel the power to decide
In the darkness
Waiting for a sign

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
A sign in your hand
And one light shine on
Why the mystery of goddess
Is my freedom?
Helm of the stars
Is a spirit of truth
In my heart, in my heart
I feel so alive... with you

Bodua! Celtic goddess of war
Blood, pain and misery within...
Aine! Goddess of the land
In the winter torches could be blind

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
A sign in your hand
And one light shine on
Why the mystery of goddess
Is my freedom?
Helm of the stars
Is a spirit of truth
In my heart, in my heart
I feel so alone... without you!
