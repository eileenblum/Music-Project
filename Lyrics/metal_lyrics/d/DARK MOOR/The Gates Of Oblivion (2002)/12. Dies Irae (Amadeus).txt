Confutatis maledictis
flammis acribus addictis

When the sun is flustered
and the moon is free
The great little master
Writes a little melody

the notes fever's in my breast
aches to be away

Eternal wisdom
in glorious kingdom
that is my sole wish

[Bridge:]
the first violin lead me while the harps
embrace me like the blood
the madness beats my art
In the stage my baton cuts the air
I am
in a world I never made, a man

[Chorus:]
Dies Irae, Dies Illa
Solvent saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum sibilla
quantus tremor est futurus
quanto judex est venturus
cuncta stricte discussurus

The sound is around
long live to the king
never falling down
Rex gloria; Rex gloria

witness of the time
spirit is sublime
no more feels of pain no more hate
a revenge is going away
Where is my destiny?
Where is my fantasy?
I need to free my soul and cry
someone to pray for me
I need to free my soul and will die
there wells up the only tear
we shed without woe
and ride like the wind because
the music is enthralled

the note's fever in my breast
aches to be away

Eternal wisdom
in glorious kingdom
that is my sole wish

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

the soft step to your bed
is not worth pursuing
you will so soon be dead
death will serve instead
turns to the thing
he was born to be
a master to the king
keep your fancy free
in the deep of the sea

Salva me, fons pietatis

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
