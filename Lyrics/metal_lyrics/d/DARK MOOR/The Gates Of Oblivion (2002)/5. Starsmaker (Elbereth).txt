When day is out, I can see in the sky
Plentiful forest made with the stars
In cold night, I can feel the near-by
goddess of asters no matter thou art so far

[Bridge]
but in my sorrow I need to see
beautiful sunsets, precious to thee
and in my travels when they're too long
I'm just pay worship with this sweet song

[Chorus:]
Everytime I gaze the blue sky
filling thy grace with love tears my eyes
In thy face see the space
in my cry, hear a sight
Praying for thy light

a during ship crossing the sky by day
Sailing the morning. light is its trade
A silver ship for love starting the chase
when the night comes the light dies away

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
