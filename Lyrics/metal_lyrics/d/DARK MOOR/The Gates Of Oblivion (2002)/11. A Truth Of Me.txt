My sorrow is like
leaves flying in the air
when the wind strikes
blowing everywhere
and I can't stay living in this tearful valley
so I just pray for having all the force
to be a stream leading it course
Flowing up to it's source

[Bridge I:]
But my love is for the only light
but my heart goes to standing right

[Chorus:]
If I could flee
from my sorry thoughts
like the rivers running slope down at last to be free
When I see
lovers who can dream
with sweet fancies that will never be
a truth of me

nobody can live
twice in just one time
Neither can give
Twice love in it's prime
but van't prevent feeling to surrender to love
So I feel myself prisoner of sin
when y give to the eart my skin
And my soul to the wind

[Bridge II:]
but my love is keeping watch the night
But my heart cries the eternal fight

[Chorus]

[Bridge I]

[Chorus]
