Walking through the lane
when conforms our life
we play a fool's game
to survive
Pleasure enclosed me
enbracning with loving arms
Pain came to me
with great harm

[Bridge I:]
have you ever wonder
are we just victims of fate
Fed with the seeds of hate?

why must be wander
towards the dark unknow gate
although our will is great?

[Chorus:]
Ol by the strange paths of destiny
searching out hard my hidden place
faces weave (the) life cord of humanity
in the en their last verdict can't wait

goddess of fortune be by my side
mother experience keep me alive
unyielding time now has just decide
if I'll survive

I saw a siren
in my lonely way
lost in her silence
(we) turn away

[Bridge II]
disgrace has found me
it would try to make the fall
but hope kept me from all

anger had chained me
but the siren set me free
diving into life's sea

[Chorus]
