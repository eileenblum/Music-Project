You don't lie, you don't fight
Don't plead for seeing the light
you don't gaze the mean face

don't try to pray,
just to save your illusions
to save your shame
now your life is impregnated of flame.

please help me of kill me
but don't bury my soul
I'm dreaming, I'm screaming
full of grief
I'll be condemned without mercy
without a song but I've had a nice hope

[Chorus:]
The wind in my hair
the sun under my veil
I'll go though
the road is hard and long
thousand of questions and only one answer
My anger is in the heart of stone

I'm sneaking, I'm creeping
I'm needing all my faith

I'm sinning, I'm living full of grief
I'll be condemned without mercy
without a song but I've had a nice hope

[Chorus]

Don't hit me, don't save me
What is my destiny?
I'm sighing, I'm crying
full of grief
I'll be condemned without mercy
without a song but I've had a nice hope

[Chorus]
