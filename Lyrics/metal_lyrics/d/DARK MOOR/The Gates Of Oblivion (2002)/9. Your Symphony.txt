I know that you need me
To survive in this world
world of empty words
take my hand and feel me
If I'll be your friend...
forever be

[Bridge:]
In the depths of wind
could be playing with me
your symphony
Playing on and on
never be alone
sing my song

I stay bu your side, girl,
through the endless hate, my dear,
The rain disappears
the poison of your life
fills my glass and I...
I drink, I die

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
You give me the light
all my cold nights
Your fantasy
will me my symphony
