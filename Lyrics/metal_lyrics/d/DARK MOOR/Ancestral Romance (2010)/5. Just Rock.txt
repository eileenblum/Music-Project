Listen! Listen! It's all around.
Everybody's gonna pick up the sound.
You feel the beat, you get a shock
when your soul harmonized with rock

[Chorus:]
Rock is our voice,
rock is our truth,
rock is our choice,
rock is our youth.
That's rock'n'roll.
Just rock your way!
Just rock your soul!
Just rock today!

It's the music which puts us wings,
fills our souls with energy and fury,
rock impels us to dance and sing.
Rock must be so.
So come on! Let's go!

[Chorus:]
Rock is our voice,
rock is our truth,
rock is our choice,
rock is our youth.
That's rock'n'roll.
Just rock your way!
Just rock your soul!
Just rock today!

[Guitar solo: Enrik]

[Chorus:]
Rock is our voice, (Rock!)
rock is our truth, (Rock!)
rock is our choice, (Rock!)
rock is our youth. (Rock!)
That's rock'n'roll. (Rock!)
Just rock your way! (Rock!)
Just rock your soul! (Rock!)
Just rock today!

In the core
Of my heart
I adore

The eternal Art.
