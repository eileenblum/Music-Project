Love came to me,
love for good,
from the stone.
With love, how could
I be alone?

Love came to me,
after life
from the stone.
Me and my wife
on our own.

[Bridge:]
Love grows everlasting
into me and turns out bendless.
Love which grows in the endless
solitude.

[Chorus:]
Your kiss inflames my frozen heart
while yours breaks down and falls apart
and both, at least, are ready to depart
so far and free.
Your kiss is burning on my lips,
your life outside forever slips
while all my soul within my mouth just sips
yours into me.

Love came to me,
like a flame,
from the stone.
When my love came
I was gone.

[Bridge:]
Love grows everlasting
into me and turns out bendless.
Love which grows in the endless
solitude.

[Chorus:]
Your kiss inflames my frozen heart
while yours breaks down and falls apart
and both, at last, are ready to depart
so far and free.
Your kiss is burning on my lips,
your life outside forever slips
while all my soul within my mouth just sips
yours into me.

[Guitar solo: Enrik]

[Chorus:]
Your kiss inflames my frozen heart
while yours breaks down and falls apart
and both, at least, are ready to depart
so far and free.
Your kiss is burning on my lips,
your life outside forever slips
while all my soul within my mouth just sips
yours into me.
