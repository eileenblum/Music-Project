By night,
death at nigrum Masses.
By day,
emptying liquor glasses.
This time,
a remorse harasses:
I can't help doing it!

[Bridge:]
Blood and semen
for a demon,
children butcher,
more in future,
driven crazy,
living hazy,
all to make the Work.

[Chorus:]
I'll solve the enigma
of timeless life,
I've got the stigma
marked by a hot knife.
Eternal life!

By night,
bloody orgies sessions.
By day,
the Alchemy obsession.
This time,
regretful confession:
I can't helping doing it!

[Bridge:]
Blood and semen
for a demon,
children butcher,
more in future,
driven crazy,
living hazy,
all to make the Work.

[Chorus:]
I'll solve the enigma
of timeless life,
I've got the stigma
marked by a hot knife.
Hahahahaha!!!

[Guitar solo: Enrik]

[Chorus:]
I'll solve the enigma
of timeless life,
I've got the stigma
marked by a hot knife.
Eternal life!

Mhahahahahaha!!!
