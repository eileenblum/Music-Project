Life is a dream...
Nothing's inside
such as it seems,
as you've eyed.

Life is a dream,
so dreams the ram
like dreams the lamb,
thus, I just dream
what I am.

It's a kingdom and a jail,
it's as solid as it's frail,
and the only truth is dreams are dreams.
It's a kingdom and a jail,
it's a shade behind a veil,
and we fall in its schemes.

Odd contradiction:
Life is a dream.
Mixes facts and fiction,
gold with stones that gleam;
and dreamers
with kings.

Dreams, like real things,
confuse the human beings.
Life is a stage,
this is the norm,
one could be a sage
or could be a fool when performs
its role in this form.
