Far, Tyrians of the oceans
far, keep yourselves in motion,
far, to set up a town,
far, where the Sun goes down.

[Bridge:]
Away, where skies are always bright,
away, where winds draw a coast in white,
away, where days are miracles of light.

[Chorus:]
Away, a city far away,
a land of reverie is waiting.
So far, a city far away,
there's nothing else but navigating.

Waves carry a hope song,
which treks all the way along,
far, to set up a town,
far, where the sun goes down.

[Bridge:]
Away, where skies are always bright,
away, where winds draw a coast in white,
away, where days are miracles of light.

[Chorus:]
Away, a city far away,
a land of reverie is waiting.
So far, a city far away,
there's nothing else but navigating.

[Orchestral interlude / Guitar solo: Enrik]

[Chorus:]
Away, a city far away,
a land of reverie is waiting.
So far, a city far away,
there's nothing else but navigating.
