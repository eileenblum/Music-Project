You are a part of my life
Since I met you for the first time
In the sky, in the night
I will love you till I die...
The sweet door of the dreams is open again
Tonight all my love will flow through your veins
You're my constant vision, reflect of my heart
I remember your eyes that never say goodbye
I want to tell you that you are my star
An eternal rainbow, an eternal sun

[chorus]
Infinite dreams in my life
Since I met you for the first time
In the sky, in the night
I will love you till I die...

Your tears become the continuity of my lament
Your smell becomes the continuity of my essence
I open my eyes and I don't feel the fear
When I'm close to you nothing bad happens to me
I want to tell you that you are my star
An eternal rainbow, an eternal sun

[chorus]

Mime si nous ne sommes pas ensemble,
Nous sommes un ChÃ¨rie, o que tu sois, je serai prÃªs de toi

[chorus]
