From the grave I watch in the shadows
Since those years, the age of deep pain
When I hear the drums of battle
Beats my heart, greedy for revenge
Wait my queen, my wife of the dark death
I'm the damned one, you sucked all my blood
In your fangs my youth was delighted
All hope is revenge, blood for good

[chorus]
Fight, oh! Knights
Recover the kingdom
Army of spectres
Prepare my return
Oh! My lords
Dark is the wisdom
That makes grow my flesh
With the songs of the swords

Night has come, remember old spells
I move my hands, my lungs can now breath
Here I say, hence I must be free
All is true, my body still creeps
Shake your hair, my sweet beast of hell
Tint your claws, I will kiss you soon
You can't hide, your smell I sure know well
Cry loudly now, for it's your last moon

[chorus]

You will see that dream is oblivion
You will feel the hurt of my anger
Now it's the time, all your life is over
And for my soul, time is the avenger
