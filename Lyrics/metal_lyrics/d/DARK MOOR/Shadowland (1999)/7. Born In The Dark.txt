Wars in the night
Fear in my eyes
And fighting with all the warriors
Keeping all the treasures
Hiding the reasons
And watching (the) warriors falling down
I would like to be a bird
I would like to be a man
When the fire runs withe me
I will feel free again

[chorus]
Born in the dark
Fighting with us
There is no reason to let you down
Come with us now
It's cold at dawn
There is no reason
Born in the dark

Power in my hands
Fear in my veins
And calling my brothers right now
Fighting with corpses
There is no return
And moving mountains with faith
I can see the light on me
I can see my destiny
When the fire runs with me
I will feel free again

[chorus]
