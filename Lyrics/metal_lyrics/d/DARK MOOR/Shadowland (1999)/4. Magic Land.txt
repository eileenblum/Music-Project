In the wood while elves their instruments play
Sing about (a) place far away
On the black hill when the dwarfs carve the stone
Tell about the wizard's home
Beyond the white hills
Plying the gold sea
You'll see (the) way begins
(If) you want to see (the) sign
You must use your mind
And follow the wind

[chorus]
Run to the magic land
Where all has begun
Run to the magic land
Magic is waiting for you

The acolytes direct their steps just there
But they must always beware
Because only the best one can survive
Where others will lose their life
It can be unreal, or it can be real
Search in your mind
(f) you follow the clue
You'll know that it's true
And the doors will shine

[chorus]

Mater of wizards aid me to understand
(The) secrets of (the) moon and the sun
Teach me the strength and the essence of the spell
Powers of heaven and hel
If you place your hand
Over the markede sand
We'll begin the rite
Earth, water and fire
And air we desire
Magic will be right

[chorus]
