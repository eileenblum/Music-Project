A gray mirage flees when the sun light glows
I have to leave my past pursuit,
Now I realize which is the way to go.
It is time to follow the route.

The road again,
like a revelation,
the road again,
without hesitation.
I wanna go where I gotta go.
My road...

Another election,
a new direction,
is just a second chance.

Uneasy selections,
some circumventions,
always a big advance.

Aware of my actions,
expecting reactions,
collecting soon their fruits.

It is time to follow the route.

The road again,
like a revelation,
the road again,
without hesitation.
I wanna go where I gotta go.
[repeat]
