Deep inside me,
I feel a storm,
its echoes flee,
I rest warm.
It's like a bomb
of fire and sound,
it's coming from
where profound.

My world's made of tears
since you departed to disappear,
but my hope is clear:
I will carry on standing up here.

I'm a white paper with a blot,
I'm a bright sun with a black spot,
and in my dreams we are together as ever.
I'm a clear mirror with a crack
that reflexes you forever,
and in my dreams we are together as ever.

Deep inside you,
you feel a chill,
it's something new
and gets you ill.
It's like voodoo,
a magic rite,
it ties up you,
stops your flight.

My world's made of tears
since you departed to disappear,
but my hope is clear:
I will carry on standing up here.

I'm a white paper with a blot,
I'm a bright sun with a black spot,
and in my dreams we are together as ever.
I'm a clear mirror with a crack
that reflexes you forever,
and in my dreams we are together as ever.
