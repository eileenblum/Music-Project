Only you
fill me with love replete,
the land and sea
are forms of you and me,
with you I feel complete,
my love.

Only you,
forever my girlfriend,
together in dance
and between us a lance
and before us the end,
my love.

We are the fire,
we are the water, too,
the world entire,
just me and you,
my love.

Only you
perceive the best of me,
stars in the skies
are witness, and their eyes
express their joy and glee,
my love.

Only you,
forever my girlfriend,
together in dance
and between us a lance
and before us the end,
my love.

We are the fire,
we are the water, too,
the world entire,
just me and you,
my love.

Only you
have made my destiny,
sun in your face,
my strong and tight embrace,
our wish to set us free,
my love.

Only you,
forever my girlfriend,
together in dance
and between us a lance
and before us the end,
my love.
