Look at the sky,
the Milky Way,
it rules up high
night and day.

Walk step by step,
find their inner force,
this gives you pep
in your course.

Way of Saint James,
the experience of being anew.
Way of Saint James,
it puts a start on you.

Learn of your trek,
keep pace
whole days.
And learn when you check
each face,
each place.
Learning all your way long,
right along.
Learn with your rest,
lids tight
all night.
And learn of your quest,
it's right
your sight.
Learning all your way long,
right along.

Dust on the road
carries away
each episode
of your way.

Keep coming forth,
body and soul,
it's in the North
your real goal.

Way of Saint James,
the experience of being anew.
Way of Saint James,
it puts a start on you.

Learn of your trek,
keep pace
whole days.
And learn when you check
each face,
each place.
Learning all your way long,
right along.
Learn with your rest,
lids tight
all night.
And learn of your quest,
it's right
your sight.
Learning all your way long,
right along.
