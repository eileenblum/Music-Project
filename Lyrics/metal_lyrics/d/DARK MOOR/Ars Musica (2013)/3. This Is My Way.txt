This is my way:
a bitter hint in a true laughter.
This is my world:
better a "soon" than the best "after".
Living my way,
living my world,
in contradiction.

This is my way:
a smiling child playing in rapture.
This is my world:
honesty and right always in capture.
Living my way,
living my world,
in contradiction.

The gladness,
the sadness,
are both my life,
they're the same:
comedy and melodrame.

O, my life!
O, my body and soul
walk by the beach,
run through the streets,
only trying to reach
my innocence as it fleets
at leisure stroll.

This is my way:
fire in the heart
and in my imagination.
This is my world:
needed of art
and of a brilliant inspiration.
Living my way,
living my world,
in contradiction.

The gladness,
the sadness,
are both my life,
they're the same:
comedy and melodrame.

O, my life!
O, my body and soul
walk by the beach,
run through the streets,
only trying to reach
my innocence as it fleets
at leisure stroll.
