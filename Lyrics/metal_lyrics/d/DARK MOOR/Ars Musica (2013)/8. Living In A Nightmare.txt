Silence in black
is coming back,
there is a Light somewhere.

Monsters are shades
that never fades
from unreasonable dreams...

I can think
in black ink
about the world

Tragic.
World of magic.
Master.
War disaster.
Goya.
Living in a nightmare.
Manic.
Mind in panic.
Freeman.
Cult of demon.
Goya.
Living in a nightmare, aye!
[repeat]

Candles and nights,
blood and bullfights,
also an "akelarre".

Reason when sleeps
grows terror creeps
from unreasonable dreams...

I can think
in black ink
about the world

Tragic.
World of magic.
Master.
War disaster.
Goya.
Living in a nightmare.
Manic.
Mind in panic.
Freeman.
Cult of demon.
Goya.
Living in a nightmare, aye!
[repeat]
