With living bright
of harmony
in the still night
of reverie
a single star
when nightâs along
suggests the river
the stream song

[bridge:]
The star seems an eye
with a wider scope
which can see the hope
in the soul could fly
would see from the sky
everything can be forever

[chorus:]
Gleams from far
the hopeful lucky star
while waters mix below
no matters where they go
and world is just a chance
with whole significance
in the life
all is in bloom
beneath the star
the river glows
with the sky light
the star just flows
in the fluid night

[bridge]

[chorus]

If the soul could fly
would see from the sky
everything can be forever

[chorus]
