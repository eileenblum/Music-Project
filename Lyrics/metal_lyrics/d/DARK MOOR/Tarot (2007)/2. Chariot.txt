Riding through the Earth in the chariot
making fun of Death.
Falling like a star in the chariot
one last time so far.

Scattering the strength in my hand
Regretful for the words unsaid
But young contest me there's no place for pain
Master mysterious reveals minds of sad

[chorus:]
Riding through the Earth
in the chariot making fun of death
falling like a star
in the chariot one last time so far
I feel Iâm a fall
through the times crying for my soul
I see Iâm a fall
into darkness out of all control

Bound, forever in despair
confusion in my glare
the crusade for the faith and desire
some blind obsession
scent of eagerness
spirits in mourning
that the souls possess

[chorus]

[choir:]
Riding with no reins
controlling white horses
riding with no reins
commanding without chains

Could be the danger
could be certainty
turned on the best side
itâs always mighty
seven the number
triumph in my spirit
hunger for glory
lightful and eerie
will I find it all?

[choir]

[chorus]
