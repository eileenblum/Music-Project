Careful, human, coming is a stranger
hooded, swinging a broad scythe of danger!

[choir:]
I have no name
and I have no time
brings out my game
a new paradigm
I am the veil
in the cold night
Iâm of a pale
ill bright..

[bridge:]
Impaling new orders
pushing beyond the borders
transforming and turning
the end into a new reborn

[chorus:]
Death!
I am death!
Prank of god, paradox
rage and doom walk with you
made of dust, crazy dance
end of childhood
life reverse, grave nonsense
hungry grave with a great
harvest of madness

[choir]

[chorus]

Death!
I am death!
Thirteen!
Iâm no name!
