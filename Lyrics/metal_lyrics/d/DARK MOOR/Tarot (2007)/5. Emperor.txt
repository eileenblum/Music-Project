When coming is the disaster
the Emperor masters
the Emperorâs always the master
when coming is the disaster
the Emperor masters
when will must overrun faster
the Emperor master

[bridge:]
The will is the law
do not quit nor withdraw
just the Emperor can
lead to succeed the man
encouraging him with force and power
itâs need to withstand
by the strength of the hand
all in this life
is a violent strife

[chorus:]
When coming is the disaster
the Emperor master
when will must overrun faster
the Emperor master
the Emperor guards the order
heâs the inner warder
he establishes firm the border
heâs the inner warder

He has got the power to reinforce us
to reach goals
inside heâs the father who controls
he plays ever to win
he has the might within
he is whoâll make the rule
when conquers the world in a bitter fray
and holds on and leads the pain away
he subdues and renews
he restores the peace
the Emperor absorbs
the world in his orb
everything is taken

[bridge]

[chorus]

Itâs written in his soul
to obtain soon his goal

[chorus]

The Emperor wins.
