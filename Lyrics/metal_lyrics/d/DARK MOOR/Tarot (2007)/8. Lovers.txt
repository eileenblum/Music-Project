Underneath the star shine
where the white light glows
Lovers in the skyline
cupid shoots his bow
One promise, true love forever
or one life calmed in wealth
to choose passion or stealth

[chorus:]
In my heart, the love is in my heart
The dream beneath the sun
The lovers will be one
The night brings a sweet love caress
a broken feeling possess
my heart in the doubt
that fills my distress
In every soul there is a light
a dream that drives each fate
that just love celebrates

[chorus]
