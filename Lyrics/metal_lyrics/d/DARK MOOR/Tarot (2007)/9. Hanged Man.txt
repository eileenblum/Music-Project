Stopped in the crossroads of my life
Wrapped in the world of eternal strife
Iâm looking for the meaning of the universe
searching in myself melody
to drive me to the harmony
Iâm hung from my right ankle
but I can see the truth

[bridge:]
The secret of the alchemy
rests in my crossed leg dark mystery
What is the price of my soulâs crack?
that one which ties my hands in my back

[chorus:]
In my way to the knowledge
I chose the road of sacrifice
I will be fey of secret things
Iâll see the other paradise
Iâm head-down

Since life began
The hanged man
the time drowns
smiles Satan
The hanged man

Itâs the time to understand
why my clock stop the sand?
My will is the only force
that governs my fate
No religions, no beliefs
if I read the overleaf
of the life book just than
I will see the godâs face

[bridge]

[chorus]

[choir:]
Since life began
The hanged man
Is seeing head-down
how the time drowns
What is the price of my soulâs crack?
that one which ties my hands
in my back

[chorus]
