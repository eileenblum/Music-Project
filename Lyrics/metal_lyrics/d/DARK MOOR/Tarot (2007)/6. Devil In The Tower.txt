Hidden in the silence of your room
he whispers lies that will bring your doom
The Devil
He walks with his hoofs of goatish male
chaining the men to the egoism jail
The Devil

[choir:]
For black magic power
high, majestic tower
fills your heart of ire
promises of desire
For black magic power
high, majestic tower
fills your mind

[bridge:]
A beam falls down from a clean sky
bringing ruin to you, my friend

[chorus:]
The bells chime, Devil in the tower
looks over his column at the human fall
No more time, Devil in the tower
and ever in your mind you feel his call
Two men are falling down
the souls cry and the thoms (?)
will be your crown
The scepter in my left hand
i ever reign in the material land
You will red the book of thoth
then you will feel madness
screaming form your throat
humanity enemy
I am the guardian of the mystery

[bridge]

[chorus]

In the nightfall
you will be a thrall
Of his evil lies
cruel nightmare
like black prayer
full of scorn and vice
The end of the balance
is your defeat
while you dance the Devilâs suite
Climb the tower
itâs the hour
Dream the reality
out your flesh husks
in the soul dusk
come your agony
Youâre falling down
so falls the mask
itâs time to answer and ask

[choir:]
Silence in the room (bis)
the Devil lies in the nightfall (bis)
Devil in the tower (bis)

[choir]

Bringing ruin to you, my friend

[chorus]

Hidden in the silence of your room
he whispers lies that will bring your doom
The Devil.
