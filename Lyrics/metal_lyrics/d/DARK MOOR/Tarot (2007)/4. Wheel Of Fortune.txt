I am just here
I was before
locked in a cell, madness came and tore
I look the gear
begin to turns
and now i will know what I must learn
creatures around
hung to the wheel
evil and goodness breaking their deal
and they surround
waiting their time
to change in my soul who Iâm

[bridge:]
Through the times runs the wheel
in itâs essence thereâs bad luck and weal
Iâm in eternal quest
of the balance on which the world rests

[chorus:]
I live in to the wheel, life like a sigh
and thus fortune turns forever
inside Iâm born, inside i die
my life happens fast whoever
I saw the sphinx
over the wheel
she showed me all that i can feel
so I can think
to find my way
and can forget yesterday

[bridge]

[chorus]
