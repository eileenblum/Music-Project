I was the sunlight
I was the storm
Of this empty world
I spread joy and fright
Among the swarm

He was born
He was afraid
My soul torn left
And I feel betrayed
What I see
I can't forgive
This pain within me
Despite you live

Miracles
Only miracles
Taking my time for miracles
Bringing you to life

A thousand ages I roamed
Wherever I could see the road
Moving mountains
With faith I showed
Feelings are never owed

Just in time I realized
How much I'm yet
In vain sacrified
Now I have nothing to say
No God to pray to
Nowhere to stay

Miracles
Only miracles
Taking my time for miracles
Bringing me to life

A God omnipotent
Was not omnipresent
An unbeliever man
Broke up his sacred plan

Took care of his own mind
His eyes no longer blind
The God swore paradise
The man's life is the price

A God omnipotent
Was not omnipresent
An unbeliever man
Broke up his sacred plan

Don't want your mercy
I don't need your hand
I just can live without your help at all

Shall I take my vengeance
Or let him live alone?
Shall you just think out the way
That you are treat your first son

Shall my fury slam
'Till you kneel and crawl?
Won't grovel down
Look for another lamb
