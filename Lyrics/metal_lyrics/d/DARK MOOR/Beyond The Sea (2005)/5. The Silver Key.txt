[This song is based on the Dreamlands of H. P. Lovecraft]

When I was a child wandered
Through meadows, my time squandered,
Lost in the sweet nostalgia,
Was looking for
A way in my dreams.

When I have the Silver Key
It will be too late to flee.
The Guardian tells me with deep voice,
Iridescent balls of noise,
Beyond the Planes of the Space,
Yog Sothoth will show Its face,
Madness will be his grace

Over Mountains
My mind shouts freely
Like a melody
Through the Gates of the Silver Key.
Dear Dreamlands,
Put in me your brand!
Take me into your secrets,
Show me the dark way of Kadath!

I travelled for unknown places,
I knew strange races,
Lost in the mist of Dreamlands,
Was looking for
The City Of the Gods

When the cold fills my poor soul
I know Iï¿½ve come to my goal.
I see monstrous walls to raise
Covered by a cloth of ice
Far beyond of the sacred door,
I will find the true Godsï¿½ lore
And all will be like yore.

Over Mountains
My mind shouts freely
Like a melody
Through the Gates of the Silver Key.
Dear Dreamlands,
Put in me your brand!
Take me into your secrets,
Show me the dark way of Kadath!

The Old Ones were, are and will be.
Their Messenger I am, come with me!

The darkness reigns in the Hall.
He taught me in the cold nightfall
That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange aeons even death may die.

Over Mountains
My mind shouts freely
Like a melody
Through the Gates of the Silver Key.
Dear Dreamlands,
Put in me your brand!
Take me into your secrets,
Show me the dark way of Kadath!
