I can't help thinking of tomorrow
Now when I've still got all my full will
To overcome my fear
And makes me feel a real sorrow
How my heart crazy is just I'll
Beating foreseeing what is near

Lor!
I'll defend my honor
My life is the price
I must throw the dice

Before tomorrow
I feel the sorrow
And in the mirror
I watch the terror
This is my night long and cruel
Before the duel!

Before tomorrow I have to write out
My best lyric poem
I have never made before
And when I'm walking through the night about
Inspiration comes to me
To liberate my sore

God!
May not come tomorrow!
If I have to die
My poem's a goodbye

Before tomorrow
I feel the sorrow
And in the mirror
I watch the terror
This is my night long and cruel
Before the duel!

Before tomorrow
I feel the sorrow
And in the mirror
I watch the terror
This is my night long and cruel
Before the duel!
