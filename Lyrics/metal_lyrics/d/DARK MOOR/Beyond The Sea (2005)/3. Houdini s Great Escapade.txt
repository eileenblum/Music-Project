From hidden places
Tied up with tight laces
The best magician made his escapade
From all kind of cases
Leaving without traces
Like a living ghost
He just could always fade

In the life scene
His mother's been
Carried off beyond
She left this side
And he then tried
To prove he could
Cut the life bond

No, that's no possible at all
I am gonna slip in like a shade
No, that's no possible at all
I must perform my las escapade

I'll flee!
Break out
From the death world!

In his fixed obsession
He made up a plan:
He'd prompt to escape from his afterlife
In a mediums session
Figured as a man
He will pay a last visit to his wife

Called by his wife
He came to live
Could undo the string
A voice was heard
Saying the words
Secret key
In her wedding ring

No, that's no possible at all
I am gonna slip in like a shade
No, that's no possible at all
I must perform my las escapade

I'll flee!
Break out
From the death world!
I fled!
Yes, I could flee
From the damned death world!
