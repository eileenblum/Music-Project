[Based on the story of Gustavo Adolfo Becquer (Spanish poet 1836-1870)]

And old legend tells
A spirit of the devil dwells
In a lake beyond the trees
And I found my ruin in this place

Green eyes
Like a beam of the sun
That, swift, hides while it runs
Within the white foam
Green eyes
Your glance burned my chest
The desire of the quest
Of some eyes like those

Loneliness did filled my soul
And my mind they stole
I became drunk with its melancholy
When I saw her eyes in water

Green eyes
Like a beam of the sun
That, swift, hides while it runs
Within the white foam
Green eyes
Your glance burned my chest
The desire of the quest
Of some eyes like those

My course was her call
To her bed of emeralds
Waters jumped in glints of light
And then closed over my body

Green eyes
Like a beam of the sun
That, swift, hides while it runs
Within the white foam
Green eyes
Your glance burned my chest
The desire of the quest
Of some eyes like those
