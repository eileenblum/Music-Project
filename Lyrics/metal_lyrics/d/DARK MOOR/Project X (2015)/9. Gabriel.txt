They are coming from the deep space,
filling me with pleasance,
showing me their purity and grace,
I miss their just presence.

I've seen them in the light,
they were bright
when they exposed their lessons
They brought hope for long,
and made me know their song:

Light is OVer mE.
Light is OVer mE.
And although I'm a child,
they have me beguiled,
and I trust on their fair true guide:
Light is OVer mE.

I know they look after me,
goodness is their essence,
so they seems to me
to plenty of luminescence.
