Behold within your solitude, into you abides.
Behold within your gloomy mood inside.
But look Far! There's a revelation.
Just look far, out beyond the stars.

Far off, it might be a place
in the space,
where some stays,
some kind oF lively race.
Far off, it might be a place
where some lays on some planet,
some kind of lively race.

An odd breed expected
with all us connected.
An odd breed,
we are not alone, indeed.

Beyond the stars,
In the darkness,
where your hope is like a dream,
your eyes can put the light
Beyond the stars,
In the darkness,
from which you receive their beams,
your eyes can put the light
Beyond the stars,
In the darkness,
there's a place as for as next to you.
Watch between the clouds the skies in view!
Beyond the stars!

We have never lived at all alone.
We are not alone, as you have always known.
We have never Felt at all alone,
at no time, all the loneliness is blown.
