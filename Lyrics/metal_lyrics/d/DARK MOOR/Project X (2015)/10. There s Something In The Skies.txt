There's something in the skies
when I see with tender eyes,
it's really strong
and it will last for long.
There's something in the skies
when I see with tender eyes,
comes from above,
the magic force of love.
It's love.

A love For the beauty of things.
A love for all the human beings.
A love for the plain nonstop time.
A love For all what is sublime.

It's love.
Yeah
It's love.
Eternal love,
for ever love.
It's love.

A love for the somber shadow of the night.
A love for the pulse of the brilliant light
A love for the flowers and trees.
A love for the rivers and seas.

A love descending quickly from the skies.
An eternal love!
Extense, concise...
...love,
that
it's
Coming from a nice paradise.

Night and day
love works your way.
In the dark,
soon, shines a spark.
And Masters say:
Love is nature.
When it snows,
when heat's close,
when time slows.
Love is nature.
Creek that flows,
wind that blows,
moon that grows,
sun that glows,
man who knows,
time that goes.
That is love.
That is love.

Love, love, love, it's love.
Love is nature,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
Love, love, love, it's love.
Love is nature,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
If you believe in heaven
you should believe in love,
there's not one thing in Heaven
except
high love.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
If you believe in Heaven
you should believe in love,
there's not one thing in Heaven
but love.
It's love.
Yeah!
It's love.
Eternal love,
for ever love...
Amen.
