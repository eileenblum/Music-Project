I watch back my trace
going through the space.
How delightful is my flight!
I go on my track,
there's no coming back,
the Earth is out of sight.
The pate has sped
through the deepest darkness
ahead
and ahead,
just exploring
its immense essence.

I'm somebody new
in a new rebirth,
In a new rebirth,
I'm somebody new

I'm somebody new,
yes, new, and different, too.
I'm somebody
in a new rebirth,
but out of the Earth.

Flying along my way
while I go on astray
across the whole night.
My substance scatters
all this void of matter,
coming up with me the light.
And comes to my mind 
he time of the arrival
and find
that behind
stands a world now in the past,
at last!
Yeah!
