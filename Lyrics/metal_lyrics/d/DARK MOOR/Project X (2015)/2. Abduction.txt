After the occurrence,
we don't have remindings but a missing time,
for the thought transference
was in our psyche like an inner crime.

Rhythmic beeping,
while sleeping,
body inspection,
one injection,
mental scanning,
bodyplanning,
to insert us the implants.

I looked the Greys
at the face
in the trance induction.
The Media says
it's a case
of alien abduction.

All seemed like a trap,
we could see a map
on a huge machine,
graphics on a screen
of a strange device
that they turned on twice.
It's astounding
their surrounding
open eyes.
