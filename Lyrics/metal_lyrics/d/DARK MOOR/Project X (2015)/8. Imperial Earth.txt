The Earth: Surrender immediately.
In any other case, we must initiate the ignition.

galaxy masters,
our peace is worth
welfare for the asters.
Imperial Earth,
galaxy blasters,
our war is worth
ruin and disasters.

Aliens: Don't attack, please.
We accept all conditions with deferential respect.

Aliens: Caution! Caution!
Aliens: Nuclear launch detected!
