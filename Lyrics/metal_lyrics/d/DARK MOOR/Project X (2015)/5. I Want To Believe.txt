When I remember the sound of your voice
When I remember your smile
Thats hugging me
So guide me in my life

But you left one day
And the winter came
There is not solace for me
In this sad world, only my memories

Wonderful years
Hide in the deep of my tears
I recall you
It is all that I can do

When I remember your purest glance
When I remember your hand
On my head
So guide me in my life

I understand now
The meaning of Faith
Because I need to believe
That in the Stars I can be with you again

Wonderful years
Hide in the deep of my tears
I recall you
It is all that I can do

Uh, uh!
I want to belive
I want to belive, Yeah

Tell me, how I can live without you?
