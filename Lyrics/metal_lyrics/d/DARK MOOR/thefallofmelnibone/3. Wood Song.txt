In the olden wood
when the sun bright the dawn
I am feeling alone
lost into the infinitude

Light and darkness in my mind
Liquid shadows cross the place
Oaks whisper like the wind
vail of tears on my face

Elves sing our names
You and I have called
our dreams are enthralled
Underneath eternal flames

From the bells began to chime
Old ones know our destiny
Real souls are out of time
ever since melancholy

voices soy to me in my solitude
era will die but i'll live in you
Really i'm never alone, in our wood
