[originally by Helloween]Masquerade, masquerade
Grab your mask and don't be late
Get out, get out
Well disguised heat and fever in the air tonight

Meet the others at the store,
Knock on other people's door
Trick or treat they have the choice,
Little ghosts are makin' lotsa noise

But watch out...
Beware
Listen...
Take care

In the streets on Halloween there's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween the spirits will arise
Make your choice it's Hell or Paradise
Ah - It's Halloween
Ah - It's Halloween... tonight!

Someone's sittin in a field,
Never giving yield
Sitting there with gleaming eyes,
Waiting for a big pumpkin to arise
Bad luck if you get a stone,
Like the good old Charlie Brown
You think Linus could be right
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie

But watch out...
Beware
Listen...
Take care

In the streets on Halloween there's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween the spirits will arise
Make your choice it's Hell or Paradise
Ah - It's Halloween
Ah - It's Halloween... tonight!

Listen, now
We are calling you...
And there's magic in the air

Magic in the air... on Halloween

Black is the night full of fright
You'll be missing the day
What will be here very soon
Changing your way
A knock on your door
Is it real or is it a dream
On trembling legs you open the door
And you scream... on Halloween

Darkness
Where am I now
Is there anybody out there
What has happened
Am I in Heaven
Or is it Hell

I can see a light comin'
It's comin' nearer
It's shining
It's shining so bright
It's shining on me

I am the one
Doom's in my hands
Now make your choice
Redeemed or enslaved

"I'll show you passion and glory"
He is the snake
"I'll give you power and abundance"
He's the corrupter of man

Save me fron the Evil One
Give me strenght to carry on
I will fight for all mankind
Deliverance and peace of mind

But watch out...
Beware
Listen...
Take care

In the streets on Halloween there's something going on
No way to escape the power unknown
In the streets on Halloween the spirits will arise
Make your choice it's Hell or Paradise
Yeah, it's Halloween
Yeah, it's Halloween... tonight!
