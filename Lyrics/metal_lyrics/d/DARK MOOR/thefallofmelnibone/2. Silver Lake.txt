Along the river of fantasy we'll get to a place
Which they want to see. Across the valley of illusion
We'll have to climb the mountains of confusion
And challenge all the sings without breaking our union

The legend tells me that in this place
The ones who immerse in the Lake
Inmortality will find. Never ever die

Run across the seas, find the brightness in the mist
Following the lane, you will reach the Silver Lake

Our journey is hard and the lake is far
We will never fall, in the strength we hold

Maybe we'll never dream in this endless time
You will never win if for your goals you don't fight
Although we're lost in the forest of sorrow
We'll try hard to cross the dry dune of the death

The legend tells me that in this place
The ones who immerse in the lake
inmortality will find. Never ever die

Run across the seas, find the brightness in the mist
Following the lane, you will reach the Silver Lake

Our journey is hard and the Lake is far
We will never fall, in the strenght we hold
