Play the drums of heaven, flee from here to a remote land
The scourge of your people threatens to destroy the man
When the swords plunge into your souls, you will rest in peace
Now I want to pass my sentence on your Holy Priest

Save you from evil purify your hearts
It is high time you start to depart

Oh Lord! Nobody is blameless, thy will be done
My God! Nobody is safe from the rage of your son
Your wounds are bleeding for the unspeakable sins
How long have you been keeping the Holy Keys?

The light of the sun is suddenly ebbing away
The earth will be embraced by the flames in this day
Even the most gallant of my heirs among the men
Will be terrified of the beginning of the end

Oh Lord! Nobody is blameless, thy will be done
My God! Nobody is safe from the rage of your son
Your wounds are bleeding for the unspeakable sins
How long are you praying for me?

You will know that it's me when I turn my back on you
I will put the bodys of your sons inside their tombs
I will throw your rotten bones into a sea of lies
My black soul will be your curse for the rest of your lives

Oh lord! Nobody is blameless, thy will be done
My god! Nobody is safe from the rage of your son
Your wounds are bleeding for the unspeakable sins
How long have your been keeping the Holy Keys?
