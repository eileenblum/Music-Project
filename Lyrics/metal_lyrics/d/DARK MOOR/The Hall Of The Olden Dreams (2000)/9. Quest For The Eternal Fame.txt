Quest for the eternal fame
Which gets the men immortal
Glory for our names
Gained in the battle by knight that legend will acclaim

We don't mind the sacrifice, it's a low price
For being in the heaven's hall
Just to see the paradise with loving eyes
When death makes its mournful call

Justice we must defend we're the law's lance
Our deeds and virtues hold a beatiful romance
But we can't forget compassion's our end
So we'll have temperance

Quest for the eternal fame
Which gets the men immortal
Glory four our names
Gained in the battle by knight that legend will acclaim

Love must be the guide keeping off pride
Humility leads us
In the quest for our inside as testified
By the angels of light

Honour and honesty fill our heart
In the middle of the battle fear is put apart
With the sound of blades' steel our qualities
Make the war be an art

Quest for the eternal fame
Which gets the men immortal
Glory for our names
Gained in the battle by knight that legend will acclaim

In the autumn's wind
There's a melody
Epic ballads that the bards sing
Rhymes that in the air
Want to manifest with glee
Valor comes from the King of Kings

Sacrifium, Honestas, Compassio,
Virtus, Humilitas, Honor

Justice we must defend we're the law's lance
Our deeds and virtues hold a beatiful romance
But we can't forget compassion's our end
So we'll have temperance

Quest for the eternal fame
Which gets the men inmortal
Glory four our names
Gained in the battle by knight that legend will acclaim
