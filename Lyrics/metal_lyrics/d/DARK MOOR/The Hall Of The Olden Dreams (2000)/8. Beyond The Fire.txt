I see the eyes of the darkness, beyond the fire
Where the starts seem to be crying
In this green valley, I let go out my desire
For some peace and quiet I'm dying

My song is strong over the gale
Like a nightfall rending the air

Cloaked in the light of the blaze, I am waiting
For the return of my fate
I never try to find and nothing makes me cry
Where I could spend my life

By the sea, in my sleep, I can breathe the cold wind
And this frozen wind recalls me that I have never dreamed
I still can't awake. There's no sun there's no day
Pierced by the lance of the pain... I'm not afraid!

I feel like a solitary desert swept by the wind
Here, sweet voices whisper me
Everything is still the same in my dreams
I don't want to fall asleep

My song is strong over the gale
Like a nightfall rending the air

Cloaked in the veil of the night, I'm lying
I sense the end in my mind
I never try to find and nothing makes me cry
Where I could spend my life

By the sea, in my sleep, I can breathe the cold wind
And this frozen wind recalls me that I have never dreamed
I still can't awake. There's no sun there's no day
Pierced by the lance of the pain... I'm not afraid!

Cloaked in the light of the blaze, I am waiting
For the return of my fate
I never try to find and nothing makes me cry
Where I could spend my life

By the sea, in my sleep, I can breathe the cold wind
And this frozen wind recalls me that i have never dreamed
I still can't awake. There's no sun there's no day
Pierced by the lance of the pain... I'm not afraid!
