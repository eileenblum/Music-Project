After the war
I was for ten of those years of yore
Lost in the sea
By a harsh god's agency

But through the years
Love urged my will to be solid and clear
And for my wife
I risked the loss of my life

[Bridge I]
For her
I did not eat lotus from its twig
For her
The sorceress could not change me into pig
For her
I blinded the Cyclops' single eye
The cannibals did not make me die
All for her

[Chorus]
For her
I worked my way
For her
I moved away
From my Destiny
Shipping across the sea
For her
I could resist
In my frail heart, the Fortune's twist
And I was the last
True hero from the past
Sailor, come here...
I hear a trace of the ocean noise
Fascinated...!
The move of waves is like a voice
Hero come near
I can hold on with a tight rope
Captivated...!
I've got a hope

[Bridge II]
For her
I could put up with the nymph for long
For her
I could escape from the soft sirens song
For her
I had to face the women delight
And nobody could defeat me in fight
Just for her
