Orpheus, don't look back
Play your music!

You've been able
And thus runs the fable
To rescue your lover
Going downwards to hell

Great musician
Charming compositions
Could play to discover
That Hell's under spell

[Bridge I]
In your motion
Keep away the emotions
And your wife from Hades
To world you'll restore
Just be wary
This is necessary
'Cause only your lady's
What you adore

[Chorus]
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

You'll recover
Your mild lover
Don't look and
Feel her hand
May Apollo
You could follow
Right your track
Don't look back!

[Bridge II]
Play such tender
As a love defender
And go ahead forever
Never turn around
Play such gentle
That your instrumental
Song can terror sever
With this sound

[Chorus]

Though it's near
What you fear
In your heart is the music
Don't look back
Just attack
With new notes your song
