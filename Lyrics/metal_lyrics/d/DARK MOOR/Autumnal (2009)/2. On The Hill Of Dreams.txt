In my room
When from the window the night falls
Sweet perfume
That takes my eyes with the dark call
In my mind
The light escapes, the shadows crawls
Just behind
Of the dream's walls

[Bridge]
Then my lonely heart
Rides on the wind
And one sigh hits my spirit
When I look the gloom
And see her eyes...

[Chorus]
Like a stream
My soul flows
On the Hill of Dreams
With own glow
Silent scream
Darkness's wife
From the Hill of Dreams
Take my life!

Mystic place
Through the night's journey goes my way
Like a trace
Of olden tales that ever stay
So in time
My future could be yesterday
Paradigm
Of the dusk gray
