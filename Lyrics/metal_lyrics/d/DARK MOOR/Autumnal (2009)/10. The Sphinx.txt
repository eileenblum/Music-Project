Who knows the whisper of the secrets of our lives?
The treasure of Chimera's daughter
Perhaps could be the truth of the world's strife
Or will I just find the end of time?

[Chorus]
Body of lion
I look your face of woman
In defiance
Of your enigmas
Wings of eagle
Who devours men for Hera
Broken riddle!
Listen your end!

You, who lies in hidden dark seas of sand
Among the dunes
You, malicious creature, who enslaves my land
With ancient runes
The man is my answer
The dream of one romancer
The son of the heaven
Whose deadly sins are seven
My hope is the knowledge
The sacred wisdom
My word is the sentence

Jump to the void!
My arms destroyed!

Although the Monster was defeated by the man
The olden secrets not left the world
Perhaps it was forgotten since the life began
Or is the man himself the Sphinx?
