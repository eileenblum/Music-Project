Men, in the hardest part of the world
Men, looking always upwards to Lord

[Bridge]
In their own, with open sight
Dreaming of light in the lonely night
They'll survive regardless of the new modern times

[Chorus]
Everytime
They are wondering
What's the sense of life
Desert's answering
When the sun is gone
And all's darkening
That life's just one day more
One day more
Meaningful...
Plentiful...
Perfect...
Venture...

People in blue
Free nobles who are riding across the dunes
Princes of men
They can see in the start, the end

[Chorus]
Everytime
They are wondering
What's the sense of life
Desert's answering
When the sun is gone
And all's darkening
That life's just one day more
It's just one day more
Everytime
They are wondering
What's the sense of life
Desert's answering
When the sun is gone
And all's darkening
It's only one day more
One day more
Meaningful...
Only one day more
