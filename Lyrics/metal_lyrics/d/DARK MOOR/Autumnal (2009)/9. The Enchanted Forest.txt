In the skyline
Of the dark light
Searching the sign
Of ancient rites

I found the voice
In the old willows
I made my choice
My mind I could saw

[Chorus]
The enchanted forest
And my soul saw
The enchanted forest

In the autumn
The black cat laid
The leaf came to dance with the maid
The mist whispered
In the deep rain
Secrets forgotten so old that I saw

[Chorus]
By the old path
The coach travels
With silent wrath
Through the wise trees
Horses galloped so
My odd eyes could saw
