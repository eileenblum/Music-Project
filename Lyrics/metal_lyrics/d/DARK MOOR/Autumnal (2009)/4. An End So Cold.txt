An end so cold
For love which disappoints the heart, so cold
As flowers she tight holds

This is her end
No one can mend
What death calls for to the cold waters

This is her end
No life to spend
Only an end so cold

[Chorus]
Nettles for harming
And orchids for charming
Poppies for doom
And violets for gloom

An end so cold
With flowers which reminds her pain, so cold
As love in days of old

The end's coming fast
As water runs past
Flowers compose a scene so pleasing

Is up the past
Peaceful at last
Only an end so cold

[Chorus]
Nettles for harming
And orchids for charming
Poppies for doom
And violets for gloom
Daisies for cleanness
And pansies for meanness
For death and sorrow
One forget-me-not

"Too much of water hast thou Poor Ophelia"
