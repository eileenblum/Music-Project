[Chorus]
Faustus
The time has come for you
And here's your sentence
That is your fate and
It's no use repentance
You must pay with your soul, Faustus
You have come to your goal, Faustus
You wished the deepest
Knowledge of tomorrow
And power to clean off
Grievance and sorrow
We have made your wish true, Faustus
Now we are over you

Love, your force may get me free
And show me how to flee
From my fate
When my time is over
Love, you help me to understand
That all is in my hand
Just today
Not far away

[Bridge]
Love..., I've fallen in distress and dismay
Because I'm waited
Predestinated
Fated...!

[Chorus]
Mephisto, the intriguer
For your soul, is eager
There's a compact you've consented
With blood your soul have been rended

Knowledge, I prayed to you
But now my soul to love I have just paid
Me, a renegade
Love..., I've fallen in distress and dismay
Because I'm waited
Predestinated
Fated..!
