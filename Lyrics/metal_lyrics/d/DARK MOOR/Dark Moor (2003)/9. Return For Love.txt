I was to old Rome
And there I did meet
My true love
Back to my real home
Happiness complete
Soul of dove!

But I promised to her
I would return one day
To hear aloud hoorays
As emperor

Return
Like winds which burn
For love
Like gales which shove

In my land I stayed
Thinking of my fate
Fixed in fire
I'd invade
To the gates
Of the empire

I had to demostrate
And make my love observe
How I really deserve
To be her mate
