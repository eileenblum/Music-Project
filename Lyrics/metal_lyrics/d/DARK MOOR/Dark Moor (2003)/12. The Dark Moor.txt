Tells the legend, there's a magic place
That could nobody find its trace
Land of darkness, land of forlorn songs
Where all is mystic all along

[The Traveller]
Where I am? Lost in the stream
Is it real or a dream?
My stunned mind listens to a call
Like a spirit into crystal ball
But in depth, I see a gleam
Fearful I'll follow the beam
With the shadows I will brawl
So I will arrive to the light hall

Dark Moor, Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Dark Moor, Dark Moor
Welcome to the Hall

[Spirit of the Art]
Who comes in the Hall of Olden Dreams?
[The Traveller]
I listen to a voice in my head
[Spirit of the Art]
Speak! And then I just could deem
[The Traveller]
I don't know why I am here
[Spirit of the Art]
I read in your fate
[Choir]
Choose your goodness! Choose your badness!
[Spirit of the Art]
You must cross the gate!
[Devil of Greed]
It is too late
[The Traveller]
Yes! I obey the command
Find the gate in Shadowland
If my destiny it wrote
Only the trust wants it to denore

Dark Moor, Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
City of the dreams, where is its gateway?
Dark Moor, Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Among gothic gargoyles always the Art stays
Dark Moor, Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Sleeping in the darkness there's a light
Dark Moor, Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Bathing like moon in the silent night

[Choir]
Care with the nice evil lies
Because the greed never dies
Care with the sweet false promise
Which proclaims the paradise

[Spirit of the Art]
Don't listen to it's false word
Moreover don't fight with it's bejewelled sword
And ever don't play in its black rich board
Remember

[The Traveller]
Who's there in the dark?
[Devil of Greed]
I'm who keeps the ark
[The Traveller]
Why do you talk me?
[Devil of Greed]
Your friend I could be
[The Traveller]
Why'll I trust in you?
[Devil of Greed]
It would be a good view
[The Traveller]
Move away! With your false hopes
[Devil of Greed]
Your illusions are your slope
[The Traveller]
You don't try to cross my way
[Devil of Greed]
Riches you can not slay
[The Traveller]
Perhaps I cannot win
Nor a new world begin
But now and ever in my heart the Art will be my sin

Dark Moor, Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Sleeping in the darkness there's a light
Dark Moor, Dark Moor
Welcome to the Dark Moor
Bathing like moon in the silent night

[The Traveller]
I can see
In my soul
The gate's before me
Mystery's real
My destiny

[Devil of Greed]
You won't free
[The Traveller]
Let me go
[Devil of Greed]
You can't flee!
[The Traveller]
No!
I am falling slow

[The Traveller]
Then I crossed the Gates of Oblivion
In the dark moor my spirit could fly
I am glad about my decision
As my word could always testify
With the Muses I danced in the night
Beneath the full Moon I felt the Spell

And its poetry gave me its fine old bite
And I could never say farewell
And the music in my heart
Filled my illusions with the Art
And the angels showed me
Which is the way of the stars

[Choir]
Like a dream immortal
You crossed the dark Portal
You will be blasphemer, deemer, dreamer
This is the gift of the Gods
Which for men will be odd
This is the dream of the demons who envy it

[The Traveller]
Oh! In the end of time
Muses teach me that I'm
Who choose my truth forever
Oh! Spirit of the Art
If my soul must depart
My mind will stay with you
[Spirit of the Art]
Poet of the dark glance
In your eyes a romance
With it I dance
Musician of the dreams
[The Traveller]
My inspiration will be
All the strength of my destiny
I wake up and my throat screams
Was it real or a dream
But why's tears there in my eyes?
