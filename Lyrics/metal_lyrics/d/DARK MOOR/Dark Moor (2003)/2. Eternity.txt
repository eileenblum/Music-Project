Who in the night
With wet sight
Doesn't think that it's rougher
His hard life
I mean strife
Load that we suffer?

Life
Divine blow
Life
More than we know

I feel immersed
In the clockwork of the universe
Deep metaphor
In which I'm the very core

But I realize
With sunrise
That are shades all my sorrows
In this wheel
I can feel
There're much tomorrows

Life
It's what we're
Life
Valley of tears

Like a gift
One descends when you're lift
It's like a whim of the eternity
It's a kiss
Within your bliss
Has every color you see
