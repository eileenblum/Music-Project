Life for revenge!

I have survived for my iron will
And for a reason I just can see
Allthough I feel myself sad and ill
Dark thoughts encourage me to get me free

I need my life
Just for revenge
Its worth is only in the justice it makes
Life to avenge
Life to perform a fake

In the dead shape
I escape
To fulfill my duty
(To) fake my false friends
To their end
Damning my wife's beauty
Changing my name
I proclaim
With a manifesto
That from this time
For good I'm
Count of Montecristo

Life which is doom
Coming out the tomb
Which has been fed
With the obsession bread
It's a rebirth
To fulfill the vengeance before leaving the earth
