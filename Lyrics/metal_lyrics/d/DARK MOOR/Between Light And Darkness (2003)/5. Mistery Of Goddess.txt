You were forced to live in secret
You fled from awful fear
Always hold it to your ear
And the labrys caressing your hands

With pain and sorrow the fight starts
I only wish to fade far away

Your worth brings life to me
You're a deity in my dreams
You feel the power to decide
In the darkness
Waiting for a sign

A sign in your hand
And one light shine on
Why the mystery of goddess
Is my freedom?
Helm of the stars
Is a spirit of truth
In my heart, in my heart
I feel so alive... with you

Bodua! Celtic goddess of war
Blood, pain and misery within...
Aine! Goddess of the land
In the winter torches could be blind

A sign in your hand
And one light shine on
Why the mystery of goddess
Is my freedom?
Helm of the stars
Is a spirit of truth
In my heart, in my heart
I feel so alone... without you!
