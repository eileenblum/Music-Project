Open my eyes felling the dark
With downward eye, gaze sad
Under the rain walking alone
Looking for the last door
I hear a song and touch the stars
From dawn to dusk
There is a force of clatiry
There is a light

Gaze not in my eyes!
Can I enter the hole of light?
You reach a hand to hold me but
I can't be your awake gide

Breath's a ware that will not keep
I must keep my last breath
Like the mass of the hills

When the moonlight revive
Shinning on the blind eyes
I'm feeling that
Time remains what is was
I am waiting for you
At the end of a tune
In the dawn, in the grey dawn
Time leave me now

The moonlight revive on the blind eyes
Time, time leave me now
In the dawn of the grey dawn
Oh! Blindness from dawn to dusk
