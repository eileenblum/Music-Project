Soul of mine,
When roadâs lonely,
She came to me in the skyline,
Her look was divine

Her black hair
Danced with the wind,
And the cold air
Of autumn
Played with leaves while my soul skinned
Her eyes were my glare

Her sweet voice
Pronounced my name
My soul was a choice
She called me
While her white dress was my blame
She could be my dame

[Chorus]
Grey
Dusk is, over the way
White ghost,
In my heart,
My loving soul was hurt,
Dark hopes beyond my mind.
And so I resigned
All for her cold dreamâs love

I went there
Each evening
My only care,
Donât see her!
While my heart played in a swing
Falling in despair

Then I dreamed
With her sad death,
And my soul screamed
Harrowing
While she gave me her cold breath,
She kissed me

[Chorus]
But grey
Dusk is, over the way
White ghost,
In my heart, My loving soul was hurt,
Dark hopes beyond my mind.
And so I resigned
All for her cold dreamâs love
