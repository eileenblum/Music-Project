I knew you would be here
With a tear in your eye
Came looking for me here
To say a long goodbye

If Iâm sorry
And youâre sorry
Thereâs still a long long way to go
Donât worry
Just hurry
âCause your timeâs running low

Into the maze
For the rest of your days
Searching for something to say (losing your way)
Into the maze
For the rest of your days
Always alone in the haze

Weâre all gonna miss them
Our sadness runs deep
And speaking of wisdom
Iâll break off a piece

âCause I know it
You know it
It was true when the hills were young
That shadow
My shadow
Soon itâs gone long ago

Into the maze
For the rest of your days
Searching for something to say (losing your way)
Into the maze
For the rest of your days
Always alone in the haze

Stop
Breathe in
Breathe out
Lie down
Donât say anything yet
Breathe in
Cry out
Move on
