Oh no
Oh no
Iâve seen this all before
But I donât know who you are

Oh no
Oh no no
Here it comes again
Grief will never end

Hold on
When Iâm gone
Will you carry on
In the dim new light of dawn

Hold on
It wonât be long
O mother to my heart
Take me in your arms
