Take me from here
Take me home now
Youâve seen these hands
For the last time

One by one
Will your days be done
All in all
Will your rivers keep running on
Once again
We reach the end
North by north
Another one dead and gone

Your time will come
Take you from me
No!
My cold dead hands
For the last time

Two by two
Was the mirror true
Face to face
Reflection keeps shining on
Once again
We reach the end
North by north
Another one dead and gone

All our lives we follow them
And theyâve taken us far
Dance and raise and swallow them
Like the dust that they are
From cold white halls of misery
To the center of the sun
Safe inside our memory
Til the future is gone
The future is gone

Six six six
Are the devilâs tricks
On and on
I kept telling you I was sick
Once again
We reach the end
North by north
Another one dead and gone
Another one dead and gone
Another one dead and gone
