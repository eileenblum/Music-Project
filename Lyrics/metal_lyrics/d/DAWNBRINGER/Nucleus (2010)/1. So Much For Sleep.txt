Welcome to the distance
Welcome to your hole
Just lie down and think
The same old thoughts you can't control
You're not crazy
Just insane
Lying to the lunatic
Who lives inside your brain

Might pray tonight

This could be the moment
The one that never ends
A night so long it seems the sun
May never rise again
No more dreams
No more sleep
Welcome to the future
Where you're buried twice as deep

Might pray tonight
Take me tonight
