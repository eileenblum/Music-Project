You know me
I can't be in the light for long
Close your eyes
Once my face at the window is gone
You know me
I'm the shiver you always feel
I'm still here
Now you know your fears are real

This night
You see
All life
Is me

Six six six

You know me
I'm the one who's always there
Mark your time
Soon we go to you-know-where
I know you
We won't make it through the night
Run to hell
Drag you over the pits of light

This night
You see
All life
Is me
