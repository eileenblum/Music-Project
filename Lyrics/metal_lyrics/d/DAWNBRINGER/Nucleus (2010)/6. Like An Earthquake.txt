I took the vow
I spoke it silently
It drags me down
Each day it sickens me
I took the bait
I took it happily
It keeps me great
It's here right next to me

I understand
I get the mystery
This was not the plan
But I chose differently
I lost the score
Looks like a tie to me
Just shut the door
Let's say goodbye to me

It feels like an earthquake
Tearing through my heart
It shakes me every day
And I know now the first time
Was really just the last
There's something in the way
