Everybody in this room
Everybody better listen
Because I am the one
I make the difference
It's me you've gotta listen to

Because I see demons
It's all I see
I see demons
That's all I see
I see demons
It's all I see
This world of evil
That's all I see

If you can't have ghosts
Then you've only got the devil
And I told you before
I walk through fucking fire
Every day
You can smell it on my skin
Cause it burns me hard

I see demons
It's all I see
God damn demons
That's all I see
I see demons
It's all I see
This world so evil
That's all I see

Amen
