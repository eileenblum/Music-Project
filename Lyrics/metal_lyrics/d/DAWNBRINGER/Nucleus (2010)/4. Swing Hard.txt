I may see death tonight
You may be there
I may fly high again
In midnight air

I see them
In sickness
I see them watching me

In graveyards late tonight
Too dead to dream
There's no escape tonight
Or so it seems

I see them
In sickness
I see them watching me

I dream of a mountain
To rise from the sea
Then I soar into sunlight
Born to be free
I don't know
I don't know
I dream so desperately

It must take a lifetime
To get it all in line
And want what you find
I look to the nighttime
To unchain the mind
And leave dreaming behind
