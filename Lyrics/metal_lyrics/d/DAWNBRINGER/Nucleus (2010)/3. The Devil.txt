One year we marched together
Through the ripping rains
We looked to one another
As we pushed ahead in chains
One night I said, "Tomorrow,
I can find my own way home"
And I know that something followed me
That night I walked alone

In darkness I awakened
To a devil in my home
I drowned him in the water
I ground him with the stone
I threw him in the fire
Put the ashes in a hole
But somewhere in the woods that night
He somehow got my soul
