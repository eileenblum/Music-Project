He creeps along
In shadows on the hill
I think I can see him
When I'm not feeling well
I wander forward
Toward magic I can't find
I see him coming
With answers on his mind

Old wizard
Walk tonight
Hear my voice
And make me right
Old wizard
Speak to me
Take my hand
And let me see

Out in the distance
Somewhere lies his home
He lives forever
He lives alone

Old wizard
Walk tonight
Hear my voice
And make me right
Old wizard
Speak to me
Take my hand
And let me see

Old wizard
