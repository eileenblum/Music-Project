Every night
An echo in the wind
From the voices in the distance
Every night
They're calling me to them
Will this never end
Same old song again

I don't know where I belong
Everything I do is wrong
And I don't know if I can carry on

Every night
The fire on the shore
See glowing in the distance
Every night
It burns forevermore
Leads me through the dark
Right back to the start

I don't know where I belong
Everything I do is wrong
And I don't know if I can carry on

[Solo: Bill/Chris]
