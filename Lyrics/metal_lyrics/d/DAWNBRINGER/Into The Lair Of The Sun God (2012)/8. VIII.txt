Into the chamber
Into the lair
I see a sad old man
Just standing there

Feels like I know him
He looks in my eyes
And as he starts to speak
I lower the knife

I know all about you
I know all your fears
I knew you as a child
And why you think youâre here
You think you can kill me
But you donât have a plan
It wonât be much longer now
Til you understand

So now youâve found your failure
Stand down and try to swallow your shame

Cause you have no power
Just anger and pride
Strong on the surface
But hollow inside
You wonât be a hero
It was not meant to be
But you had one last chance
I wish you had seen
