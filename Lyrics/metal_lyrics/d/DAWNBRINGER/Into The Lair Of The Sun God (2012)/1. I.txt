Up on the seaside
Gaze down at the waves below
Standing so strong and high but my
Spirits so low
What now for a warrior?
Cry out in the burning light
Iâm feeling the fire but I
Canât find my fight

So where is the glory
Who sings my name
Like heroes before me
Proclaimed

From the horizon
The sun now speaks to me:
Youâre just a simple man and thatâs
All that youâll be
Your courage is foolish
Forget those dreams of fame
No triumphs await you so just
Find a new way

Silence you bastard
I know my way
Into the ocean
Away

Perfect water
Silence in waves
Quiet as a grave
Enter darkness
Take a deep breath
My destiny is death
And so it is done
I am the one
To murder the sun
