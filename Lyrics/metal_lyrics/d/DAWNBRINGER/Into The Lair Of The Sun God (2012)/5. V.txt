I am not alone now
Youâre lying next to me
But youâve got very old now
And youâre dying I can see

You donât know Iâm with you
Diseased and deaf and blind
And although you canât see me
Thereâs still sadness in your eyes

Because I know you remember
How it feels to be free
But for now and forever
In darkness youâll be
Looking for me

I canât believe you
Too sick to say goodbye
And when I come this way again
I wonât find you alive

Now I see your lips move
Youâre praying for death
Here comes your answer
To seal up your breath

Oh no!
