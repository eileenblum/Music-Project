Sheâs just a haunted woman
They look away from her
She understands their silent curse

They say she knows the devil
Invites him in her home
But sheâs not evil, just alone

I watch her wander slowly
All through her darkened house
It seems thereâs one else about

But then I see a flicker
A flame runs down the floor
And someoneâs slipping out the door
She looks to my direction
With sorrow in her eyes
She gives no confession
Silent as she dies
Now sheâs gone
The fire takes her home
My vision fades in flames
And another dream is done
