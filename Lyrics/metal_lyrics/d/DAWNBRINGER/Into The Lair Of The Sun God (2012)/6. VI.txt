I stand amazed and watch your spirit rise
A constellation over me
And now the boy and she are at your side
I hear you speak to me as three:

You are the one weâve waited for
And we can lead you anywhere
Our fate is in your hands
Here in the sky

We know the one youâre searching for
And we can help you follow him
But if you go and fail
Then we all die

Youâve lost your peaceful life
Become a man of violence
Your pride is lethal
But your journey is long

I start to reach my knife
They see and sense my loyalty
We died for you and we will
Carry you on
Carry you on

We are disciples of the sun
We are disciples of the sun
We know the way up to the sun
So we will take you to the sun

My ghostly guides align and start to travel on
A sea of black surrounds us all
Now left alone I realize all my fear is gone
I meditate on gloryâs call

For soon a hero will return
The kind of man your spirit yearns
My time is now
Up above the clouds
I will destroy the sun that burns
