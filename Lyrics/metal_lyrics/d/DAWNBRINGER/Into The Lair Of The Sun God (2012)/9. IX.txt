As he takes the blade
He shows no pain
The light starts to fade
And suddenly his face is mine

Now he starts to cry
He bows his head
Starts to say goodbye
And all the light is washed away

As I sink to my destiny
Filled with water and grief
So damn deep was my vanity
That the sun god was me
Three ghosts are now doomed to be
All abandoned by me
And my life ends in tragedy
At the bottom of the sea


Thanks to pasko1983 for sending track #7 lyrics.
