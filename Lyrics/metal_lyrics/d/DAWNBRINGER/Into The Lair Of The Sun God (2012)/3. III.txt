Suddenly I see a battlefield
A lonely boy dressed for war
The enemy gleams with their savage steel
Promising slaughter like before

With fear in their eyes the men start to rise for the fall
The battle begins and terror sets in for them all

The lonely boy soon meets his fate
A deep wound from a deadly blade
And as he falls down to the dust
Smelling blood and tasting rust
He knows no help will come
All alone his life is done
And as the dream is ending
Heâs calling out my name

Into the lair of the sun god
Into the lair of the sun god
Into the lair of the sun god
Into the lair of the sun god
