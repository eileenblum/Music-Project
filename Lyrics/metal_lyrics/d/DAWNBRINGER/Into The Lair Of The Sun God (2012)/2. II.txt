Iâm the one you never thought would come for you
You say Iâm just a simple man
Soon you will discover thatâs no longer true
As youâre dying by my hand

Spirit hunter
With fire in my heart
Going under
And now my story starts
Coming toward you
Your ending has begun
Killer warrior
Assassin of the sun

I will send you to the cosmic cemetery
Avenge the ugly and ashamed
My aim is singular and solitary
For centuries theyâll know my name

Penetrating
Deep under the waves
Meditating
On how to find a way
I feel a calling
And I know that I am right
A star is falling
Iâm coming for the light
