Return from oblivion
Alone once again
On a shore of shadows
With a storm coming in
Have I come to conquer
Or is this hell?
A lightning flash
Seems to tell

The ghosts are gone
I must go on
How will I know?
Where will I go?

Just down the shoreline
A stairway of stone
Did I take it here?
Will I take it home?
Like a mountain before me
It rises high
Cuts through the clouds
Up to the sky

I reach the stairs
And look up there
And in my sights
There burns a light

With blade in hand
I understand
Up toward the glow
I climb the stones
