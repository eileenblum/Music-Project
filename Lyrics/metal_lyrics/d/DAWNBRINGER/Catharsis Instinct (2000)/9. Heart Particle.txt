Nestled in the petals of accomplishment
The naked truth of failure and glaring green
Never forgiven and never forgotten
Between the poles of infinity and pain

And that's all over now
Swallowed up as history
Reaching for the sky
A thousand lives in misery

Dead men rise and speak to me now
And all my spiralling vision turns to snow
Blackout, whiteout, greenout!
Eyes burning red
I will build palaces with my own rotting bones

And that's all over now
Swallowed up as history
Reaching for the sky
A thousand lives in misery

Giving away the answers and telling secrets
Breathing toxic air and filling our own brains with lies
We're all victims and we're all going to suffer
We're all in the same sinking ship, but we all die alone

And that's all over now
Swallowed up as history
Reaching for the sky
A thousand lives in misery
