I am the ending of a life
No getting better now
The white zone spilling on the black
My patience, my patience running out

Fear of god and fear of life
I am cut and ready
I want to die
I am afraid I won't

In the torture of a sleepless night
While my body rots to blood
But this is never what I wanted
I'm just begging you to stop

My days bleed into weeks
All my arms are open
This is the blurring of edges
The softening of shapes
The mercy and forgiveness
In death is real
Time for you to seal me up
And roll the stone into place

In the torture of a sleepless night
While my body rots to blood
But this is never what I wanted
I'm just begging you to stop

I am the ending of a life
No getting better now
The white zone spilling on the black
My patience running out
The mercy and forgiveness
In death is real
Time for you to seal me up
And roll the stone into place

In the torture of a sleepless night
While my body rots to blood
But this is never what I wanted
I'm begging, begging, begging you to stop
Oh... begging you to stop
