Am I the enemy? Am I the wound?
Is this the only outcome waiting?
Am I the poison? Am I the cure?
Am I the mirror to your ugly insecurity?

Look under rocks
Behind closed doors
Secret passageways
I can't believe

Am I the monarch? Am I the slave?
Is this a chase for consequences or naught?
Am I the venom? Am I the snake?
Am I the emblem of your vicious insincerity?

Look under rocks
Behind closed doors
Secret passageways
I can't believe
I won't believe

Look under rocks
Behind closed doors
Secret passageways
I can't believe

Look under rocks
Behind closed doors
Secret passageways
I can't believe
I won't believe
