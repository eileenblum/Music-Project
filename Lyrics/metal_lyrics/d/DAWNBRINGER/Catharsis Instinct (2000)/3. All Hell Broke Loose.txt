I've got fucking teeth for eyes
I am the smell of concentration
Bite and chew and never swallow
Never close the fist
I will only crawl or sprint
I will only starve or glut
I will only love or kill
I'm too big for that cross

Don't make me say it
I can't even watch
All hell broke loose
Haunted...

Telling lies is getting old
But the truth has lost its purpose
Inside the torn apart
A spiraling self-hate
You will only stand and stare
You will only cut and run
I am only eyes and mouth
You only feed my appetite

Don't make me say it
I can't even watch
All hell broke loose
Haunted...
