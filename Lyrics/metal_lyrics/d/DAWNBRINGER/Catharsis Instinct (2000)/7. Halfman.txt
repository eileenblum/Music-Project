Better sleep with one eye open
Better check the doors again
Murderers will swarm you now
Avoid the strangers, fear the friends
Enemies in numbers march
Half a man in half a house
Black betrayer, incest pig
Treachery, the mob is on

Don't you even make me say it
What's on my mind is murder and torture
I could never hurt you slowly enough
You'll only be safe in your grave

Lie force-feeder counterfeit
My hands around your throat
Shining weapon, alibi
Mask, disguise, windows smashed
Upstairs creeping, breaking sweat
Bedroom open, blade comes down
Your blood all over me
Laughter, cutting, bleed to death

Don't you even make me say it
What's on my mind is murder and torture
I could never hurt you slowly enough
You'll only be safe in your grave

Better sleep with one eye open
Better check the doors again
Murderers will swarm you now
Avoid the strangers, fear the friends
Enemies in numbers march
Half a man in half a house
Black betrayer, incest pig
Treachery, the mob is on
