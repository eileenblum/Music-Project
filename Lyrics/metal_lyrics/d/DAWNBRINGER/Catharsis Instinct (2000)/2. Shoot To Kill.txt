In a cage with poisoned bars
Filled with snakes and fire
You shiver, sweat, and cry
I fear the hunger in your eyes
In a land with poisoned fruit
Filled with viruses and bile
Your sobs drowned out by hurricanes
Step aboard and feed the flames

Sign and seal, hand deliver
You have only yourself to blame
I will never reconsider
Things will never be the same

Shoot to kill
That's a promise - That's an oath
All or nothing - Choosing both
It's a habit - It's a sin
Born to Lose - Live to Win

On the throne of consequence
Built on debts and tragedy
The hand that bites you back
Is ready for attack
Under rubbled happiness
Buried in a hole of mud
Feel your coffin shrink and narrow
Chew the bones and suck the marrow

Sign and seal, hand deliver
You have only yourself to blame
I will never reconsider
Things will never be the same

Shoot to kill
That's a promise - That's an oath
All or nothing - Choosing both
It's a habit - It's a sin
Born to Lose - Live to Win

Behind the glass you're cut and scarred
Suffer with the wicked
After all the sweat and piss
Only beggars die like this
Rape and murder, kiss away
Jester crying, children dead
Psyche quartered, cut and dried
Only craving cyanide

Sign and seal, hand deliver
You have only yourself to blame
I will never reconsider
Things will never be the same

Shoot to kill
That's a promise - That's an oath
All or nothing - Choosing both
It's a habit - It's a sin
Born to Lose - Live to Win

Kill!
