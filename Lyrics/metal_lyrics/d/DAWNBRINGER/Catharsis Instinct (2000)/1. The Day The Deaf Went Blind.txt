The world disappeared,
but only for an instant
Then boundaries died
and shape went extinct
And the world reappeared as blackness
Nothing was something,
as huge as a thousand oceans
They ripped pages out of books
to build their fires
They felt the earth vibrating
like a newborn child
They stripped off all their clothes,
they gave themselves new names
Even god himself fell apart,
life itself became profane

Notions of nations became a joke
All bodies became beautiful
On the day the deaf went blind

The world disappeared,
but only for an instant
Then boundaries died
and shape went extinct
And the world reappeared as blackness
Nothing was something,
as huge as a thousand oceans
They ripped pages out of books
to build their fires
They felt the earth vibrating
like a newborn child
They stripped off all their clothes,
they gave themselves new names
Even god himself fell apart,
life itself became profane

They touched grass for the first time
They made love with
every inch of their bodies
On the day the deaf went blind

They touched grass for the first time
They made love with
every inch of their bodies
On the day the deaf went blind
