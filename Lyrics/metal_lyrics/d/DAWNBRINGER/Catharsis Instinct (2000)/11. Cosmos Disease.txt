Tucked away behind a black hole
Inside the bleakness of dreaming
Obsessed with the ticking of my watch
Betrayed by the turning of your head
Lured by the shining of promise
Into a vortex of eternal tension
Unresolved, unresolving, resolute
I'm wrapped in the quilt of stars

And after all I keep on living
And after all I keep forgiving

I've seen where the stars go to die
Where truth is a serpent and justice a lie

This sickness was all it took
Even planets are suffering
From cauldrons of astral plane
Rising, intoxicating fumes
Filling myself with the ashes
Of an entire burning galaxy
Washing myself in the blood
Of a thousand, a thousand murdered kings

And after all I keep on living
And after all I keep forgiving

I've seen where the stars go to die
Where truth is a serpent and justice a lie
Three-headed rescuer passes us by
Blood never freezes and tears never dry

Seen through the eye of a needle
Spectrum, refracted eclipse
Spinning meaning from symbols and shapes
The great cosmic atrocity
In the mystery of intellect
In the writhings of chaos
Gravity picks its victims
All stories end too soon

And after all I keep on living
And after all I keep forgiving

I've seen where the stars go to die
Where truth is a serpent and justice a lie
Three-headed rescuer passes us by
Blood never freezes and tears never dry
