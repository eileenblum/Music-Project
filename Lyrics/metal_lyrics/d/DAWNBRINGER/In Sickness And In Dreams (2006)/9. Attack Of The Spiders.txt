It's an eight-leg showdown
As they drop down
Hot sweat web threat
Just above your head
It's an all-night black scare
Lifelong nightmare
Comes true, covers you
Thrashing in your bed

And now you're half awake
But you still shake

It's a lights-out deathstrike
One touch deathlike
Overcome, scared dumb
Waiting to be saved
In an eight-blade knife fight
Ending tonight
Bedroom your tomb
Sleeping in your grave

You could be lying still
Still there will be

Webs of intrigue intertwined
Headless answers you can't find
From your ceiling to attack
You, the victim, on your back
On your back!

Although you're half asleep
Know you'll be in

Webs of intrigue intertwined
Headless answers you can't find
From your ceiling to attack
You, the victim, on your back
On your back!
