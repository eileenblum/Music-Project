Look outside the window as the ocean's on the beach
Haunted hills are waving like the sea
Watching generations drifting deeper out of reach
There's only one survivor and it's me

Dreaming high and flying by
Into another night

Midnight - I can start to see the light
Midnight - All four walls are white
Midnight - Still not dressed right
Midnight

Dreaming high and flying by
Until another night

Midnight - I can start to see the light
Midnight - All four walls are white
Midnight - Still not dressed right
Midnight
