There's the answer waiting on your face
Where's the mirror when you need it bad?

I have seen your cemeteries
I have seen your flying ghosts
If you think you'll take me back
You're dead wrong

Back again or maybe never fades
Like an echo hanging in the mist

I have seen your cemeteries
And I have seen your pools of blood
If you think you'll take me back
You're dead wrong
