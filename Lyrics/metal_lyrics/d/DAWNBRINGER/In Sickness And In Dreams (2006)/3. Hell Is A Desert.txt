Every night I'm taken by the legs and then...
Every hour awakened by the drugs again

A downfall every day
I can't cry anyway
It makes no difference over time

Confessed in whispers on the borderline
Every time a stranger hears the lie
(While passing by...)

A downfall every day
I can't cry anyway
I'll take my chances in the dark
