This is where she cut your wings off
This is where I wept for you
Watched your blood run through the village
Watched your body snapped in two

And there's not a fucking thing that I can do about it
But to spend my life in horror knowing I chose this way
Old enough to shiver with the season that was blowing in
But young enough to think that it could end one day

Guilt Run Rain
Run Fall Shame
Fall End Wrong Run
End Black Game

Now I sleep face down in vomit
Now I'm nauseous constantly
Down that hole went all the magic
Down that hole went me

And there's not a fucking thing that I can do about it
But to spend my life in horror knowing I chose this way
Old enough to shiver with the season that was blowing in
But young enough to think that it could end one day

Guilt Run Rain
Run Fall Shame
Fall End Wrong Run
End Black Game

And there's not a fucking thing that I can do about it
But to spend my life in horror knowing I chose this way
Old enough to shiver with the season that was blowing in
But young enough to think that it could end one day

Run Fall Shame
End Black Game
