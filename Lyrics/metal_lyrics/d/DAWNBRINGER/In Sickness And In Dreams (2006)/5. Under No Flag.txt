I told you I could never make it
There was some truth in that, it seems
Outside these walls I've been created
Maybe you'll see me in your dreams

Just fragments, only filaments
From a distance nations wide
Correspondence (really evidence)
Of a certain suicide
Do you want me as a memory?
Wish granted long ago
Or a heart attack? On contact?
A broken promise to a dead man

Lie down here and disappear
Invisible to all the world
Without a friend exist again
Tonight

Like a footprint, like feedback
Fades faster than you know
It gets worse in the universe
Black holes start to show

Lie down here and disappear
Invisible to all the world
Without a friend exist again
Tonight
