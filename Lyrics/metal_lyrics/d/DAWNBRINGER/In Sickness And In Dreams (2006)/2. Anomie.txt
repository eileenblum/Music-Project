Opening the door in the darkness
Finally anxiety has a face
All this blood and all this pressure
We could be growing if we had the space
And like this thing without a place

With a hole for home and life alone
My sanity's not far behind
Like a drug for children (never given)
Pacifies your sleepless mind

I use a mirror for a window
Nothing gained by looking out or in
Looking like a scavenger of sin

With a hole for home and life alone
My sanity's not far behind
Like a drug for children (never given)
Pacifies your sleepless mind
With a hole for home and life alone
My sanity's not far behind
Like a drug for children (never given)
Pacifies your sleepless mind
