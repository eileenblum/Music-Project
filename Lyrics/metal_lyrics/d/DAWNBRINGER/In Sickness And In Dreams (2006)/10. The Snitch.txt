There's a secret in the water
And a neighbor knowing well
Watching in too closely
And a chance that he would tell

Left him wading there
With a blade in his back

Murder was the message
Making curses in disguise
Many could be watching
But not one to trust to lie

They'll be from anywhere
And they won't come back

Water serves the silent
Like a chapel for a corpse
Fatal friend, fatal friend
The sanctity of secrets
Can be silently enforced
Down again down again

And you'll be deep in there
With your family in black
