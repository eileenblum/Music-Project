Nothing useless spreading lies of hate [4x]

Ripped from childhood apart
Mephitie night lullaby
Suffer like the hell bells
Detective your body
Suffer goes on
Your still trade your life
For your past

Until fatality come
Church of lies on your mind
Fatamorgana surround you [2x]

Nothing useless spreading lies of hate [2x]

Try follow the signs follow the rules

Suffer lead to your dead
Pain anything you get
Lies Around your path

Can you stand to wait you savior
Can you stand in front of him
No savior behind you

Suffer
Pain
Lies

Antagonist execute yourself
Antagonist anthem to hate
Execute yourself
Anthem to hate
