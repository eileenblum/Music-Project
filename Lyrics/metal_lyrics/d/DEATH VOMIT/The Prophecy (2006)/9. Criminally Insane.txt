[originally by Slayer]NIGHT WILL COME AND I WILL FOLLOW
FOR MY VICTIMS, NO TOMORROW
MAKE IT FAST, YOUR TIME OF SORROW
ON HIS TRAIL,
IâLL MAKE YOU FOLLOW
QUARTERS FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE
THE SENTENCE READ FOR LIFE I MUST REMAIN
THE PATH I CHOSE HAS LED ME TO MY GRAVE
TO TRY AGAIN IâD HAVE NO OTHER WAY

QUARTERS FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE
ESCAPE FOR ME HAS FAST BECOME A GAME
SOON TO BE, IâLL LEAVE WITHOUT A TRACE
ANDANGERED SPECIES AND THE HUMAN RACE

BRANDED IN PAIN
MARKED CRIMINALLY INSANE
LOCKED AWAY AND KEPT RESTRAINED
DISAPPROBATION, BUT WHAT HAVE I DONE
I HAVE YET ONLY JUST BEGUN
TO TAKE YOUR FUCKINâLIVES!
