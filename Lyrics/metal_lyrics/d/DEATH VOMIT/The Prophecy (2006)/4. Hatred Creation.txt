PARENT REGRET, DEEP INSIDE THE HEART
WHEN THE KID FULL DOWN IN CRIME
KID WHO FULL OF SIN DIDNâT INHERIT OF GOODNESS
LIVE THE VIOLENCE AND MURDERED

NOT THE HAPPINESS THAT GROW UP, ONLY HATRED
KID WHO WICKED WORLD NEEDED

TO STRETCH THE VIOLENCE OVER THE WORLD
KILLING FELLOW MAN, TERRORIZE THE LIFE

BLOOD OF LIAR, FLOW THE LOST HEART
DESTROY THE TRUTH TO SCATTER REVENGEFUL

TO PLAY OF AGAINST EACH OTHER COLORED THE WORLD
IN THIS DAMNED CENTURY
THE SICKNESS WILL DESTROY THE WORLD
CRYING BLOOD BURNING FLESH

CRYING BLOOD BURNING FLESH

IS WINE OF MY LIFE LOVE THEIR DEATH
UNDER MY SPELL OF TRUTH

IS COME LOST FICTION IN YOUR BRAIN
IâM THE HATRED

IâM THE LORD OF YOUR PAIN
TO CONTINUE YOUR SUFFERING
TO MAKE LONGER MY LIFE
