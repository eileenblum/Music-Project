Entrapped in illusion. Painful scars chained in agony
Remains degradation. Mourning the souls passed sanity

Embraced faith. Thoughts of sanctuary.
Twisting mind. Punish for your sins
Suffering. Slashing reality. Frozen eyes. Seeing your pain.

Conceal the scars of life. Obsessed by cruelty
Vengeance cannot deny. Dead warranty
Defy indecision. Deny your religion.
Wicked incantation your destination

You walk alone to ride on your defeat
To seal your faith weak disembodied
Pray for your death feel your pain exist
Condemned to hell and burn with demons feast

Darkness... Rise. Sinners reclaiming their fight
Faithless... Lies. Desperate commit to suicide

Conceal the scars of life. Obsessed by cruelty
Vengeance cannot deny. Dead warranty
Defy indecision. Deny your religion.
Wicked incantation your destination

You walk alone to ride on your defeat
To seal your faith weak disembodied
Pray for your death feel your pain exist
Condemned to hell and burn with demons feast

Eyes
Now you can see
Supposed to be and control your
Destiny
No one cares your life despair
To become your pain and
Lies
Insanity show perfectly
You feel so
Eternity
You lose your mind
You want ignore but you cannot do that
Why?

Desperate life. Continues strife.
Try to survive like an incisive knife
Obsessed by hate. Incarnate fate.
Destroy your dreams repentance is too late
Frustration cause commit to suicide.
No where to run No where to hide
Living in fear. Full of deception.
Dying in pain death becomes true obsession

Entrapped in illusion. Painful scars chained in agony
Remains degradation. Mourning the souls passed sanity
