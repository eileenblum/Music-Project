Red, seeing the invisible man, unwanted boy, gone forever
Feel the stab, cross his hand, drained blood, gone forever
The eye of rage, where hurricane dies
Like the beast, heâs running away
Crossroad of destiny, finding faith is lies
Life confused, heâs running away

He down to the gallows, see his face in the mirror
Immersed in sorrow, he can't ignore

Swallow lies, down his throat
He screams, feed his anger
He dying in the shadow, freed from his sacred oath
Eternal pain, feed his anger

He runs for his life
Heard the word what he should be
Avoid the strife, die set him fire

The mirror from the wall, feeding my sacred sins
Wasted in a waste land, Iâm coming home
