Fill this hate. Without faith. All was raped
Dying truth. Evil roots of my youth

From this decadent we born. Which steal affection from my own
Seed the breed of malice sown. In the name of hate we sworn

Fill this hate. Without faith. All was raped
Dying truth. Evil roots of my youth

Challenge the arrogant world. Where decay story of people told
Slay them. Stiff and cold. In the name of hate written bold

Blood of wrath pray for me. I am your deepest fear
Blind their eyes not to see. Deafen ears not to hear
Free this life demanding blood. Emerged rage
Twisted words humanity blunt. Tyranny of the human race

Blood of wrath pray for me. See the dying world has broken
Born with no hope existence Pray upon your soul
Show no mercy global warfare
Clear evidence of a despair. Not under control

Blind their eyes not to see. See the dying world has broken
Born with no hope existence Pray upon your soul
Show no mercy global warfare
Clear evidence of a despair. Not under control

From this decadent we born. Which steal affection from my own
Seed the breed of malice sown. In the name of hate we sworn

Challenge the arrogant world. Where decay story of people told
Slay them. Stiff and cold. In the name of hate written bold

Fill this hate. Without faith. All was raped
Dying truth. Evil roots of my youth

Challenge the arrogant world. Where decay story of people told
Slay them. Stiff and cold. In the name of hate written bold

EMERGED RAGE!
