I can not understand the choices you have made.
I do not like you when you lie.
Because,
That's the way,
That leads,
To...
... Hell. Hell.
That way leads to hell, hell.
It's the Way,
The way that leads to hell.
The way, the way that leads to...
Hell.
Enter your dreams and meet the undertaker.
He wants your life,
So you better run.
