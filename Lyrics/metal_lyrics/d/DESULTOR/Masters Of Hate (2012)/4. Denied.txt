I see him,
I feel him.
He's right inside of me.
He's bleeding,
He's dying.
I'm more than he can be.
Attack!
This is his fear,
This is his pride.
I will face the devil's comeback.
You better watch me.
When he comes,
He will hide his pride.
When he comes,
He will lie,
Then die.
The humans are growling.
Can you hear the demons sing?
They're laughing,
They are dancing.
I'm more than they can be.
Denied.
Lucifer, here I am.
Die, 666
