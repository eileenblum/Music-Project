It's time to feed,
The endless greed.
So you can not read,
Then let us lead.
And so we bleed,
To the next generation.
It goes on and on and on...
And that's how we teach them to hate.
It goes on and on and on...
Take my hand,
And let me show you eternal hate.
So it can go on,
on and on...
You can give us your seed,
That's all we need.
If you do this deed,
We can all bleed,
Forever.
