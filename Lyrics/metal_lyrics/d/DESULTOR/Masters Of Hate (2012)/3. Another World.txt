My father,
My mother,
They don't get along at all.
I know,
They know,
The end is near.
This is the mother nature's fault.
They got father time to stop.
I am your satan.
I am your god.
When you come to this,
You will see,
I am you,
And you are me.
When you come to this,
You will see.
Another world.
Another world.
Welcome to the end.
