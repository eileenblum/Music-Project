We will rise once again,
From the ashes of the human race.
We are the masters of hate
We are the masters of hate 
We are the masters of hate
We are the masters of hate
We are the masters of hate
We are the masters of hate
We are the masters of hate
We are the masters of hate
We are the bringer of chaos,
We are the creation of pain.
We have the map of life,
And we wish death upon you all.
Mark my words,
Because we are the masters of hate.
