Blackness has conquered our minds.
You can never play on this level.
We can always kill, kill.
You can never feel, feel, our hatred.

This is the division insane.
This, this, this is the division insane.

No black worlds invited you.
Your shadows told us everything.

Open your soul and you will realize
You're not a desultor.
You can never be a desultor.

The path shows also other direction.
Kill your demons and you will see them.
