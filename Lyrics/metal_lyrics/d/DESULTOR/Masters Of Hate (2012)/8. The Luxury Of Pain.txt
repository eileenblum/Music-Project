All our dreams have died.
We are standing in front of nothingness.
There is nothing we can do.
The demons are having a feast on your souls.
The torture will never end.
We joined the suicide nation,
Please enjoy the luxury of pain.
We are all beneath contempt.
Trust in hate,
And come to us.
