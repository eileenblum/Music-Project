In the ancient east, beneath the sands, 
lies pure evil, the city of the damned
Embraced by the Devil, as you enter the region
The screams still echo in the air - the voices of sinners' souls

FIRE raining from the sky
BURNING the skin to reveal the flesh
INFERNO - the screams of the tormented souls
Beware of the arrival of the doom messengers

From the boiling desert, two nomads came, 
to seek the lonely saint in Sodom, Lot was his name
"God is about to set Sodom in flames, 
so run away 'coz God leaves NO REMAINS!"

FIRE raining from the sky
BURNING the skin to reveal the flesh
INFERNO - the screams of the tormented souls
Beware of the arrival of the doom messengers

FIRE raining from the sky
BURNING the skin to reveal the flesh
INFERNO - the screams of the tormented souls
Beware of the arrival of the doom MESSENGERS!!

As brimstone fell from the sky, 
all of the population died
Men, women and children were fried, 
"God help us!" they cried
Flesh turned to ashes, in Gods' blood lust
Within moments Sodom turned into DUST!
