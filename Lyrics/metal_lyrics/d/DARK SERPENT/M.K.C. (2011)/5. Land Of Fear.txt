Land of ghosts, land of terror, land of death
The enemy is among us, terrorize with stealth
No place to go, no place to run, no place to hide
No place to go, no place to run, no place to hope to get back home alive

Hell on earth, screaming kids, flaming body parts
Line in fear, pre-known death - another holocaust
No one to fight, no one to shoot, no one to kill
No one to judge, no one to punish and no one to be lynched

[Spoken words]
"Do not fear, stay the same", but don't make any plans
Don't protest, don't react, 'coz you don't stand a chance
Be aware, be prepared, be afraid
Say goodbye, say your prayers, for soon you will be dead
