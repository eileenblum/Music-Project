As darkness descends on the warzone, 
chaos takes the reins
Mortar shells fall like raindrops, 
scattering all human remains
I arise from my trench, 
as they order to attack, 
but soon my body falls 
from a bullet in my back

Shot By Friendly Fire!
The battlefield was dense
Shot By Friendly Fire!
To live - there was no chance
Another pawn is down, in this deadly game of chess, 
both the victim and his killer are of the fence

Night was everywhere, 
it was impossible to see
The bullets flying aimlessly, 
ripping friends as enemies
Frustration, it's all I sense, 
as my life draws to their end
"Why am I to die for another man's mistake?"

Shot By Friendly Fire!
The battlefield was dense
Shot By Friendly Fire!
To live - there was no chance
Another pawn is down, in this deadly game of chess, 
both the victim and his killer are of the fence
