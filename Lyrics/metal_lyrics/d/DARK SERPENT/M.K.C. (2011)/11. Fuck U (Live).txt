No reason and no need for one, 
just an urge, crawling from within, taking over
A desperate act, I won't live to see the dawn
Loading my gun, once I've come, your life is over

I have no thoughts, my mind is empty, 
just one word keeps ringing in my head - Kill!
0.83s I have plenty, 
I am your nightmare, but I'm for real

No one can stop me, 
now it's too late
Cross my sight and meet your fate
'Coz I'm Fully Charged With Hate

The slaughter is done, I'm sitting, bleeding
One bullet left to end this show
The finger pulls, I hear the ticking
My hate is gone once my head is blown

No one can stop me, 
now it's too late
Cross my sight and meet your fate
'Coz I'm Fully Charged With Hate
