Time moves on, 
and still I stare:
The void in my soul filled with despair
I watch the scars, they will never heal 
from being trapped in this nightmare

Time moves on, 
and still I stare:
I watch the birds that roam the air
My mind flies to share their freedom, 
my body's caged in this iron Hell

Time moves on, 
and still I stare:
I watch myself, an empty shell
Isolated, like a dying leper, 
Locked In The Watchtower
