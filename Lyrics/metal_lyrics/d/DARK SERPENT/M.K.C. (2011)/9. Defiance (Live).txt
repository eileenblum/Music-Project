Your glittered sounds - forged bowels heat, 
numbing brains, thanks, what a treat
Your retro tries are all just lies
They made us mad, unite and rise
The sadistic tunes you've turned to ruins 
are still alive, we are their goons

Defy!
You've broken all our rules
Defy!
Left our towns with no old-schools
Better stay out of our sight
The Serpents are here, prepare to fight
Defiance!

Flapped your wings, gave birth to sorrow
Beware of the hurricane which follows
Storms of toxic rage we offer
Swarms of corpses left by murder
Butchering for a righteous cause
Marking lines you shouldn't cross

Defy!
We were driven to a plan
Defy!
It's too late to clear our lane
Gave our time to set it right
The Serpents are here, prepare to fight
Defiance!

FYI, you're sure to die
We'll come for you and you know why
Our Thrashing bite can zombify
Mutate your brain until you'll cry

Defy!
Spin and guts we'll pull from you
Defy!
Drain your blood to make a stew
Rely on Thrash to rip the night
The Serpents are here, prepare to fight
Defiance!
