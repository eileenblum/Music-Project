Regression, 
cultural decline
Human race - 
Nature's most notorious creation
"Spontaneous aggressive actâ, 
a constant repeating rhyme
No negotiation, only retaliation

The most infectious epidemic, 
human homicidal nature
Driven by deadly instincts, 
we kill without discrimination

The most infectious epidemic, 
human homicidal nature
Driven by deadly instincts, 
WE KILL!!

Release the beast
Random victims
Do not wound, 
shoot just to kill
No apparent motive, 
just pure sadism
Twist the knife slowly, 
SLAY FOR THE THRILL

The most infectious epidemic, 
human homicidal nature
Driven by deadly instincts, 
we kill without discrimination

The most infectious epidemic, 
human homicidal nature
Driven by deadly instincts, 
WE KILL!!

What's next?
Pray to see tomorrow
Nothing left
except the sorrow
Self Genocide - Global Suicide

What's next?
Pray to see tomorrow
Nothing left, 
accept the sorrow
Self Genocide - Global Suicide
