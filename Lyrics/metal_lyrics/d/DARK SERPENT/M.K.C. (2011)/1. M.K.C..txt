[Spoken words:]
[General "Buck" Turgidson:] ...Distinguishable, postwar environments: one where you got twenty million people killed, and the other where you got a hundred and fifty million people killed.
[President Merkin Muffley:] You're talking about mass murder, General, not war!
[General "Buck" Turgidson:] Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed.
[General "Buck" Turgidson:] But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops!
[From the movie "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" (1964)]

Everyone is ready?
The curtain soon reveals
That's our fuckin' business,
never tried to heal
Look around the hall,
tell me what you see?
You've got to check the latest things in hate and insanity!

We've built a better missile,
it kills before it hits
Guaranteed to assist mankind in blowing itself to bits

M.K.C. - for me and you
M.K.C. - that's what we do
M.K.C. - it feels so good
Won't be long before we destroy your 'hood!

From napalm D.I.Y. kits to your pocket nuke devices
and everything you need to know to start a world-wide crisis
A bomb that's so precise that it comes knocking at your door
This ain't no Geneva here, of this you can be sure

M.K.C. - for me and you
M.K.C. - that's what we do
M.K.C. - it feels so good
Won't be long before we destroy your 'hood!

Just like you, I wander too, what the fuck is M.K.C.?
âMass Killing Conventionâ, could this really be?
Don't ask too many questions or you might get an invitation
to come and play the guinea-pig in the torture demonstration!

We've built a better missile;
you can see it in the sky
What's that smell? Red light like Hell, time to say goodbye!

M.K.C. - for me and you
M.K.C. - that's what we do
M.K.C. - it feels so good
Won't be long before we destroy your 'hood!
