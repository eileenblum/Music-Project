The need for a cause 
puts your mind at a loss
You're appealed to their lies, 
no more questions arise
Existence unfolds, 
through a book you've been sold
It provides the certainty, 
for the price of your sanity

The order once obtained is the chaos now maintained
When God's reflected in your eyes, moral restrains are left behind
Your violence is your defense, against the threat of proper sense
Fanatic words, so obsolete, build walls of faith we can't defeat

Arcane disease - shuts your eyes, bends your knees
Makes you breed - kills your brain, drives you insane

Chaos and order
Darkness and light
Humanity's freedom, 
the reason we fight
"He, who wants peace, for war shall prepare"
Enlightenment By Fire, 
in pain you shall learn!

Arcane disease - shuts your eyes, bends your knees
Makes you breed - kills your brain, drives you insane
Arcane disease - shuts your eyes, bends your knees
Makes you hate - kills your soul, seals your fate
