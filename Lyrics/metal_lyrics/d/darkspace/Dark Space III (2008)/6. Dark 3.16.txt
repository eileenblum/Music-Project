"Suppose what your faith has said is essentially correct. Suppose that there is a universal mind controling everything, a god willing the behaviour of every sub-atomic particle. Now every particle has an anti-particle, its mirror image, its negative side. Maybe this universal mind resides in the mirror image, instead of being in our universe as we wanted to believe. Maybe he's anti-god, bringing darkness instead of light."
