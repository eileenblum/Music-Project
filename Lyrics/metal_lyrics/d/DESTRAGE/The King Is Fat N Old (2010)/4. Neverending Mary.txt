You smile at me from portraits
Omnipresent, your brand in every gadget
Supported by your fans
Serene they talk to me
With the calm of who is beyond all
Without he knows anything

Things go strange
The avalanche swells
What an unexpected success
When you invented the story we know
You were just trying to save your ass

A smart move
People put stones down
Somebody had business sense
He set a new trend
Omnipresent, your brand in every gadget

A reign that invoices more than cher
Designs lifestyles and never has to ask
It spreads ignorance
It sows fear

What if you could see
Altar celebrity
You survived 2000 years while
They shake hands in billion deals
What if you could see
Prime altar celebrity
Butterfly effect starts
Flying saturated fat
