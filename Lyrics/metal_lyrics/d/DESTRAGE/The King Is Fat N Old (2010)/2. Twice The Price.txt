Please introduce yourself
Explain your ego in three words
How many girls did you win?
And what about your private games?
Are you crazy man?
Are you a perfect lover?
Tell me the craziest thing you've done to do a chick

I am the dude, girls fall in love with me
I just need a smile
You know once I've bought her a tiny crocodile
So who's the man

Now we can say you're cool
A perfect bull ready to ride
But you didn't answer to the first point
Please introduce your goddammit ass

I am the dude, girls fall in love with me
Just need a smile
And something else like roipnol melted in a glass of wine

They say
Let me see the price tag you put on your face
No way
Twice the price has no right to double care

As you see
Froth at the lips
Ain't no cool
Not what you want to be
