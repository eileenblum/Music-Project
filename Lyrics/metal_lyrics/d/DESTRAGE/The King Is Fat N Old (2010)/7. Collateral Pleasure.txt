Tell me now
Which answer you need
To make you feel
Like not asking anymore the same shit

By the end either goodwill is selfishness
It is nothing but sublimated masturbation

Forced in lines of two in school twice a day
Collateral pleasure sneaks through the way
Grab the hand of the most cute
Pretending it's not up to you
Sneer while assuming gloom

Tell me now
Which answer you need
To make you feel
Like not asking anymore the same shit

I'm not claiming for help, I won't shout to be heard
I'm just asking you not to be my impediment

Pleasant little things lay in thorns in the side
The thorn is so painful you wouldn't mind for a smile
It's so ironic

Unexpected pleasure pricks your neck from behind
Don't be so busy searching for it, don't try
It's so hilarious

Forced in lines of two in school twice a day
Collateral pleasure sneaks through the way

This being can control ecosystems, planets but himself
He's the perfect expression of chaos with glasses and nailed hands
