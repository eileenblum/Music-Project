Up your ass with two thumbs
Two thumbs up

The key to success

The product is totally non influential
It only has to be there
To be pushed at disposal
The proposal never comes from below
The product is totally non influential
It only has to be there
It only get caught from above
To be pushed at disposal

Open your eyes is not a title
Yeah is not a chorus
But double yeah you can bet it is
Yea you can bet it is

Not without I want
Not against my will
Simply with no desire
I will claim the hero you designed without my voice
We will act as tasters
Blinded fold
Tied up
With two mouths open

Glorious union fake tan and fake fun
