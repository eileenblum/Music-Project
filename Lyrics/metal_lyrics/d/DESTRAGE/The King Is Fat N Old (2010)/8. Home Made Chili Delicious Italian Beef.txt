People get hungry for their own blood
When they see someone else in danger
When the boredom makes them helpers

You stop looking outside
What would you like for tonight?

Brother said
Home made green spicy meat balls

Really spicy

Paper tiger sharks
Meat ball spider cunts
Sing together on the fly
I wear the neck food chain
They sing a song
I'm gonna write it down today

I started to feel dizzy with those green spicy meat balls
They made me think about some drops of baseness
To carry out into the world

Baseness condensed in eggs
Pure love remains out the eggs

Brother said
Go easy with those meat balls

Baseness condensed in eggs
Pure love remains out the eggs
Uncontaminated

Paper tiger sharks
Meat ball spider cunts
Sing together on the fly
I wear the neck food chain
They sing a song called Tip of The Day
