Koala stays immobile and dazed 19 hours a day
He's addicted to the toxins contained
In the only food he tastes

Panda is a 300 kilos carnivore that can plunder everything
But he goes crazy for bamboo shoots
This low every diet forces him to feed the whole day
And avoid every kind of energy expenditures
Such as socializing and fucking

The biological keynote
Should be put on the top
Admit we all are animals

Warthog is an African wild member of the pig family
When someone asks just tell him it's a puma
Seems like nature provided pumas excellent running skills
And 9 inches canine teeth but no short term memory
This means that while chased by a predator
The puma would run like a motherfucker
But he'd stop after 40 meters because he forgets
Why the hell he's running like that

We call it love, we call it art
We call it war, we call it fun
We call it will
It is survival instinct

To be remembered, to be admired
It's basic instinct to remain alive
Elevated
Filtered
Layered
At the point we deny it

If you start to doubt about your role
Try to bark orders to a dog
Last hope of self esteem
Faithful only to the hand
From which he feeds
