Walk in single file
Turn back to whom behind
Yell to who precedes
Make him notice you exist
Hereâs the score
Wait for my cue
Sing along
With me, myself and I

Shake hands and fail to grasp
The name of who you face
Here no one listens
All talk loud the same

Sweet symphony of the ego
Come sing, I permit
I write and publish
I own all the rights
Under the spotlight
I play and conduct

Yeah
Starving for attention
Starving for glances
We feast on a consent-flavored surface
Devour thin air and dust
We end up eaten alive
By the concern of eating too much

Celebrate self celebration
Celebrate self celebration

Always prepare not to be umprepared
Always prepare to appear competent
Shake hands and fail to grasp
The name of who you face
Here no one listens
All talk loud the same lame

Sweet symphony of the ego
Come sing
Sit and taste my placebo

The message dies in envelopes
The words divide
The vanity prospers on solo lectures
Behind walls

Unites the peace of Silence
Among the loud it whispers
âExist, be quiet and listenâ
