The feast is set up
Pick up whatever you desire
The good together with the bad
Superfluous in surplus

Don't waste your time in tasting
Don't waste forces in chewing up NO!
Swallow with dispatch that cud
And throttle you up with another draft

You killed tastes
All because of you because of you because of your voracity
A blind bite huge mouth army
Yeah
A blind bite huge mouth army
Assaulting things which mattered,
Now turned in free samples

The table will be never emptied
You educated cooks
To offer
Continuously new recipes obtained from old and older foods

Now tell me how many seconds
You spend to judge a song
I know how fast you used to figure it out
If it takes a long it's wrong

You killed tastes
All because of you because of you because of your voracity
A blind bite huge mouth army
Yeah
A blind bite huge mouth army
Assaulting things which mattered,
Now turned in free samples

Broadcast yourself, peer to peer yourself, download for free and pile on shelf
Give 'em a glance pile 'em on shelf
Art turned into dust-covered ornaments
Pearls for pigs &amp; Art for free

Pearls for pigs &amp; Art for free

That's human nature
No way to appreciate things without paying them
Is purchasing the only act which gives importance?
Pearls for pigs &amp; Art for free

Now you're overstuffed
I slash your stomach
So you can lick in the floor
Residues of what once was haute cuisine
