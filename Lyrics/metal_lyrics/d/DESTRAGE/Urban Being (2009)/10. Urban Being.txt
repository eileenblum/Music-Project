Business trip
Deep to jungle
Suite, banana, medias, gun, fun area all included
All a man needs, everything is a status display
Fading to grey

Pleasure trip
Deep to traffic
Buy a monster car and get involved in a holdup
Enjoy the queue, you deserve the best

Shake hands with enemies
In this lagoon of asphalt
Urban being doesn't live he does resist

Overindulge
In this meadow of tickets
You sheep meat eater

Here's how human is different
He climbs on web trees
Together in the same pit
Stamping their brothers with sharp nail wallets
Account fight

All outlanders
In captivity chambers
Seeking for experience seeking for pleasure by ether
You'll meet your neighbour pretending to be a transvestite
In Second Life

All those fictions
All those facades
Where is justice, where is nature?
Where' s the law of human failure?

Shake hands with enemies
In this lagoon of asphalt
Urban being doesn't live he does resist

Overindulge
In this meadow of tickets
You sheep meat eater

Here's how human is different
He climbs on web trees
Together in the same pit
Stamping their brothers with sharp nail wallets
In steely pockets
Reach the light now
New fight

This being can controls ecosystems, planets but himself
He's the perfect expression of chaos with glasses and nailed hands
