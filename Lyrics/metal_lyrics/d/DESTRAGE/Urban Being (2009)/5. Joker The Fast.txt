Today new claim we're searching for new names
Young people young minds for fuckin daily fishy engages

Piggie pick it up, pick it up
Your acorn
Remember you need us you need us
Like the water needs the glass

You seem to be such talented guy

You break the barrier of respect
Day after day you grow fat your pockets
You shark in jacket
Putting puppets in the balance, joker

You know by the way we're all running through bad days
The deal can be fixed but this implies pliability

Piggie pick it up, pick it up
Your acorn

Oh I forgot to say your gain will be a nut a day
We can do better we'll grant you a letter

Piggie pick it up, pick it up
Your acorn
Remember you need us you need us
Like the water needs the glass

All in your advantage, I assure you son

You break the barrier of respect
Day after day you grow fat your pockets
You shark in jacket
Previously uncertain, now precariously ensured
Putting puppets in the balance, joker

Prepare to meet your touring existence
If you look back, just your heels stand
Enjoy the trip your touring existence
If you walk on, you'll meet yourself already

Worn
Worn

You break the barrier of respect
Day after day you grow fat your pockets
You shark in jacket
Previously uncertain, now precariously ensured
Putting puppets in the balance
You break the barrier of respect
Day after day you fat your pockets
You shark in jacket
Putting puppets in the balance, joker
