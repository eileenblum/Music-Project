Second rate exhibition of second hand ideas
Uninhibited mediocres looking for an easy way
To appear
Can you hear this clamour?
It's the sound of normality
The audience loves low quality
This junk is called Reality

There is no dignity remainder
You're the worm now acting for chickens
Standby your mind just for a while
Trash within their peck you worm are dead, here comes the refresh

Show time for whoever let's sell the banality
We never meant to see
You've just to knead up this shitcake with
Nonsense, soccer, knives and tits

Intolerant, cruel, sad, rude sale of beauty and ugliness
A global market town with old women gossip
All around
On the screen everything is more and organized
Couple troubles at 9 P.M.
Relative's murdered interviews
After ten

Dance, you bitch for me
So I can flirt with your big ass
Talk, you dump, make me
Think you have something to tell and
Say you're crazy to appear
A non conventional monkey
You're the surrogate of a world that uses and disposes
Why are u trying to be someone to it?

Face the truth

Once cradle of the culture
Now dancing fool
Here the insignificant is prized
Nothing floor us as ordinary

Oh, once cradle of the culture
Once shining light
Our country is gone and all that was has passed us by
Downward trend is entertainment
Rubbish is gold
Otherwise you are outdated and be considered no more

Show time for whoever let's sell the banality
We've never meant to see
You've just to knead up this shitcake with
Nonsense, soccer, knives and tits
Let's pretend to tell something special, it's all my pleasure
I can't believe that's me
Enslaved by your cathodic bullshit
You made me stupid
I can't renounce to see
