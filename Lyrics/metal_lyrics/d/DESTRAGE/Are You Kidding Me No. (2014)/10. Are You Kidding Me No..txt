[feat. Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal]Everybody does all kinds of shit.
I'm sorry, I had to do this.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I had to do this.
I'm sorry, I had to do this.
Everybody does all kinds of shit.

Everybody does all kinds of shit.
I'm sorry that I'm sorry. I had to do this, 
but I always had more fun saying yes than no.

Everybody does all kinds of shit
I'm sorry I had to do this.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I'm sorry.

I always had more fun saying yes than no.

If everybody does all kinds of shit,
then I guess I am free to do it too.
And if you can't understand me,
just don't judge me. Who the fuck are you to judge me?
If everybody does all kinds of shit,
why shouldn't I? Why not sing this? 
Why not do this?
Why not do this?
If everybody else grows his pile of shit?
