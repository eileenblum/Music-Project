The good wave is the most rare and precious thing we have. Lasts for an instant. Blinks like a sparkle. It's a as powerful as an avalance. It's so fragile that it can be killed by a laugh.

Oh, I forever want to ride this perfect wave.
Oh, I'm gonna ride it until the end of days.

Now that we've seen it all it's so rare to be excited by anything.
Defend the good wave, worship enthusiasm and venerate the shake that it gives.

This energy won't last. They say, "Son, step by step. If you burn it all now, soon nothing will be left". Step by step, this way. When my time comes, I will be no more fresh. Won't have any new plan or any passion left. I'll only become an old man filled with regret.

Oh, to everyone riding this perfect wave.
No, don't let them spoil our glorious day.

Now that we've seen it all it's so rare to be excited by anything.
Defend the good wave, worship enthusiasm and venerate the shake that it gives.

Drawing on your wealth of experience. You think everyone is designed to follow a precise way. Just because others before have done so, doesn't mean it is right that everybody should follow the lead blindly. But people are extraordinary in their virtues and vices and you flatten them into meiocrity, applying rules forged in a sterile logic. You call it equilbrium, equality, justice, but you forget. All man are equal, only six feet under.

Yeah, forever want to ride this perfect wave.
Yeah, it's our Glorious Ordinary Day.

Now that we've seen it all it's so rare to be excited by anything.
Defend the good wave, worship enthusiasm and venerate the shake that it gives.
