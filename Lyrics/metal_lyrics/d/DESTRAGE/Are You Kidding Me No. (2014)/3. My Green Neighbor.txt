A zombie is a Back from the Dead Motherfucker
A soulless, crippled &amp; Meat Eater Folk craving for your fresh brain
Your finger is on the trigger, my friend
Face to Face
He mess you bad if you hesitate

Boom! Brains everywhere!
It's politically correct if you shoot a zombie in the face
Boom! Make it explode!
Relieve your working routine stress to the bloody bone

They used to be Human
That's why we like them so much

We can go cannibal with no sense of shame!

We are no savage
We no pay
To see gladiators kill

We are more human than that
We are different
We! Shoot zombies in the face!
Shoot zombies in the face!

Zombies are slow, predictable, old-fashioned
We ain't scared or surprised watching them in action
A creative dead end
Why are they still a trend?

They're our ex-neighbour!
They're that fucking pretentious bitch and your stupid bully boss
They preserve your traits!
Semi-human so we can hate them as much as you can

They are all that we are afraid to be
Anti-Human [2x]

We are justified
We have permission
We are licensed cannibals

By killing them, we declare
We are different
We are better

I fear i hate i need my green neighbor!

The more brutal you go
The more relieved you'll be
It's tolerated to go ape on them
They're filthy former human beings

We are no monsters
We no pay
To see gladiators kill

We are more human than that
We are different
We! Shoot zombies in the face!

Yeah! [3x]
Shoot zombies in the face!
Yeah [2x]
We shoot zombies in the face

We can go cannibal with no sense of shame!
Yeah!
We can go cannibal with no sense of shame!
Uh!

The more brutal you go
The more relieved you'll be
It's tolerated to go ape on them
They're filthy former human beings

We are no monsters
We no pay
To see gladiators kill

We are more human than that
We are different
We! Shoot zombies in the face!

Yeah! [3x]
Shoot zombies in the face!
Yeah [3x]
Shoot zombies in the face!
