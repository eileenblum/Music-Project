I'm walking on the street.
And every person gives me a pill.
Ain't no drug, ain't no medicine.
These pills are different in taste, form and color.
These pills are everything these people believe in.

Don't call me stupid,
Don't take me seriously.
No one can tell you how your taste should be.
I can be serious.
Yes, more than serious.
Swallow no pills and sing with me.

I like spice girls, so what? So what?
Am I an incoherent man? So what?
Purity ain't the answer to anything.

If mama said 
"Get the lead outta yer head" 
There must be a reason.
We take no suggestion.
We need no prediction.
You think you're pure always eating the same shit.
My stubborn narrow brother, 
What you call purity makes you sick.

Don't call me stupid,
Don't take me seriously.
No one can tell you how your taste should be.
I can be serious.
Yes, more than serious.
Swallow no pills and sing with me.

I like spice girls, so what? So what?
Am I an incoherent man? So what?
Purity ain't the answer to anything.

I like fat girls, so what?
I don't wear shoes, so what?
I dig couchsurfing and golf. 
I like to say, "so what"!
Stop thinking that you can't
There's so much more to enjoy.
In your "purity" there's no point.

In the end, life is only a matter of habits.
The problem is to get habited to this idea. 
Don't be trapped in foolish tricks.
Close your eyes, enjoy the meal.
Only then you can spit your judgement.

Spare me your pill, I take no restrictions.
Spare me your pill, I dig contradiction.
I won't be trapped in your foolish tricks.
I close my eyes; I enjoy my meal.
I am the one to say what's good for me.

I like spice girls? So what? So what?
Am I an incoherent man? So what? So what?
Spice fucking girls! So what?
Purity ain't the answer to anything.
