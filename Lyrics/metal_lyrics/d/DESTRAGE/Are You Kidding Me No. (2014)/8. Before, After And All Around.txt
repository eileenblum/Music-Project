I drive toward you.
Through space to reach the time where we were.
Two lines at a point, two seconds, in an instant.
So tight, so brief,
that we had no dimension,
because we had no duration
and everything else was before, after and all around.

Speechless smileless. Smileless, hopeless.
Haven't got you yet. Maybe you understand me better than I know.
I've got this feeling we are going nowhere.
Stupid, don't you see?
Why the fuck do you deny it?
I feel wrapped up in pain, because we are going nowhere.

Now searching for what?
Should I hold on?
Yeah, stand up, hold on.
Where are we running to?

Hey now, things are getting cold here.
Tell me, what is changing,
before we loose it all.
We built new moments. Shaping clay.
It's getting better, day by day,
but that time ain't gone, so far away.

Stupid, stupid. Don't you see?
Why the fuck do you deny it?
I feel wrapped up in pain, because we are going nowhere.
What can I do? Why do I try to understand instead of accepting this? 

At this point, a girl lives in a dream. In a little fairy house. At the following point, she lives surrounded by sweet things. Hers. Mine. At the same point, a few months ahead, she looks forward. She realizes she wanted a man, but was a boy. I should have built a fairy house. In the same time, a few miles away. But what would I have missed.

Now searching for what?
Should I hold on?
Yeah, stand up, hold on.
Where are we running to?

Hey now, things are getting cold here.
Tell me, what is changing,
before we loose it all.
We built new moments. Shaping clay.
It's getting better, day by day,
but that time ain't gone, so far away.

You pretend you don't care and play tough when you're fragile.

Two lines at a point, two seconds, in an instant.
So tight, so brief,
that we had no dimension,
because we had no duration
and everything else was before, after and all around.
