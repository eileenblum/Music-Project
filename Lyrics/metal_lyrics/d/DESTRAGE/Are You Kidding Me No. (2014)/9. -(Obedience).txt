The world is full of wannabe rebels. Self-styled rebels.
You kidding-me-rebels. Oh they are so alternative.
Shaping themselves. Saying no to everything.
They call usual. Mainstream, a fucking bore.

You play the anti-something. The anti-everything.
You call it integrity. I know it's vanity.
Call yourself the the anti-everything.
You do it for vanity. For your fucking vanity.
Searching for the alternative spotlight.
Just 'cause the main stage ain't your place.

Rebellion is a form of obedience.
Say always no. You are exploring no deviance.
You are running on their same old path,
only in the opposite direction.
Finding no new way.

You burn all your energy to convince us you're so anti.
If you are so damn different, why you gotta spell it out?
A true rebel don't need to talk the talk,
or give a shit about anyone's thoughts.
A rebel is rebel.
He just walks his walk.

Rebellion is a form of obedience.
Say always no. You are exploring no deviance.
You are running on their same old path,
only the opposite direction.
Finding no new way.

You wanna take the wheel and drive us through the change,
but you're just a passenger,
sitting in the back of the bus.

This being can control ecosystems, planets but himself
He's the perfect expression of chaos with glasses and nailed hands

Call yourself the anti-everything.
You do it for vanity. For your fucking vanity.
Searching for the alternative spotlight.
Just 'cause the main stage ain't your place.

You wanna take the wheel and drive us through the change,
but you're just a passenger,
sitting in the back of the bus.
