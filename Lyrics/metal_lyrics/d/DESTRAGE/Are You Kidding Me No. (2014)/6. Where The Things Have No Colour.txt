Can you remember when you were alive? Feeling the air as pure energy, blowing right into your mind. That's what I felt if I had ever been aware.

I will sink deep into the ocean, where the things have no colour.
I wish I could breathe under water, where the cold will hurt. Where my ears will burn.

You won't take this moment away from me and make me a silient slave of yours.
You won't put me down on my knees. I will make this time as I always meant it to be.

Breathing as I never breathe before. I won't be a victim of this ice cold scortching sun. I am that little child who laughs for no reason.

I will sink deep into the ocean, where the things have no colour.
I wish I could breathe under water, where the cold will hurt. Where my ears will burn.

You won't take this moment away from me and make me a silient slave of yours.
You won't put me down on my knees. I will make this time as I always meant it to be.
You won't take this moment away. I will make this time as I always meant it to be.
Now I can look at things and see them as beautiful as ever.

You won't take this moment away from me and make me a silient slave of yours.
You won't put me down on my knees. I will make this time as I always meant it to be.
You won't put me down on my knees. 
You won't put me down on my knees.
You won't put me down on my knees.
