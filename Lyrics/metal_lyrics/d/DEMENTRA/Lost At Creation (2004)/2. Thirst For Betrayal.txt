Thirst for betrayal
Burning of a cry
Falling of the truth
Tears never dry

Betrayal, your lie
Wisdom, our grief
Anger, eternal sleep
Pride, your belief

Standing in the open
Walls  fall  asleep
Your  words, the  earth
Betrayal the seed

Thirst for betrayal
Forbiden is the tree
Taste is the  cost
Betrayal the fee
