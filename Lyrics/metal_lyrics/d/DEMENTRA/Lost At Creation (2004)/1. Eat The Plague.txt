You take a life
It's not yours to take
He's god's child
Not your slave

[Chorus]
Eat the plague
Feed it now

You gave him pain
What did he do
I don't think love
Ever lived in you

[Chorus]
Eat the plague
Feel it now

You say the plague
Brought hate to you
He was my brother
And so were you

A time to change
The time is now
Never forever
We end it now

[Chorus]
Eat the plague
Feed it now
