Is this the face that's left in me
Beyond the mask u hope to see
If you find yourself all alone
Beyond the mask, is what you own

You judge the heart from deep within
Not the skin - that blinds you in
I can only be judged, by the one above
The one I trust,
The man called God

Beyond the mask is where I am
In myself is where I stand
The truth still out there , no one knows
The search ends within ,chapter closed.
