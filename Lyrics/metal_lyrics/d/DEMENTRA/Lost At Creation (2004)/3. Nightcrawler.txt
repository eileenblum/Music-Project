[Originally by Judas Priest]

Howling winds keep screaming 'round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

[Chorus:]
Straight out of Hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Nightcrawler...

Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught

[Chorus]
As night is falling!
The end is drawing near!
They'll hear!
Their last rites echo on the wind...

"Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
'Come to me' it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descends the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood!"

[Chorus x2]

Beware the beast...
Nightcrawler...
Beware the beast
