Speak the words they want to hear
Do the things,  they dread you'll  fear
Learn to Hate with Love alone
Live to break this heart of Stone

Beyond the Mirror a face you see
Victims of a new reality,
An Eyewash to what you believe
Free the Flesh, set me free

Feel yourself, trapped in them
The bitch called desire, you hold within
In your hands the key they place
Free the Flesh, unmask the face
