Feeling useless deprived of it all
Respect never  preserved always being sold
Revenge  wasted ever  to create
Seeing through  me energising your hate.

Power  doomed upon me
Creature  given  rebirth to  see
Burried  under  a  crown  of thorns
Exilled to find it's  army of spawns.

A deep look in the future seeing
All that hate
Nothing left to see no more, only
Left to faith
Destroyed is all i can say
Peace never more
Hung like a hollow shadow
Doomed like a lost soul.

Plunged  into  darkness
Drenched like a grave
Left with insomnia
Eyes melt with pain
Seeing no future, realising it's the end
People regret  their grief it's
Time to descend.

Ribs torn out in hate
Lungs blood  detorate
Skulls explode at my site
No one dares for it's  my rite.
