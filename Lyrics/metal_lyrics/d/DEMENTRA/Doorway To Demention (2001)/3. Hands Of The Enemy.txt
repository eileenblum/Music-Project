In the hands of the enemy
I placed my hate
In the eyes of the enemy
I placed my fear.

Thunder falling, lightning straight
Open me from within all hate
Spearhead a wounded sacrifice
Eaten down to a pagan paradise.

Never seemed to be unreal
Trapped inside this sliding wheel
Screams so loud they penetrate
Reaching within all that hate.

Scarred face i can't face the truth
Bethroned to a skull of fumes
Thrashed with no more faith
Releasing all that hate.
