Narcotic division, deranged cry
Newborn terrorism invades the skies
Hell has risen
It's prisoned belief
Hell has risen
It's risen through peace.

Chaos, carnage, whose to blame
Shattered nation's, left with shame
Brutality a tribute of pain
Too much love has turned us insane

Neutralised by a question
A question produced to judge
Denial, destruction, power
Dare not hold your grudge.

Prisoned belief, vision of faith
Power inside an empty brain
Is this the time, is this the place
I will love you, with all my hate.
