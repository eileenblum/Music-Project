I had this idea
I could not explain it
But as i grew i still carried it
Searching for people,
I could share it with
Realising finally
Justice meant shit.

Controlled by a mind
That wants to destroy
Possesed by a soul that wants war
The split personality
That cut like a saw
Made it known that
I had a mind of war.

Regardless of the bloodshed
Just wanting to smash some heads
Violence ressurected in disguise
The anger that burns in my eyes.

Truth and justice cannot imply
For it is betrayal that should die
A rusted heart that eats things raw
A deserted being with a mind of war
