Driven into chaos
You feel your mind ripped off
Shadows stagnate your path
They bleed out a famine
That will unleash your wrath.

Skull crushed by a vacant soul
Diluted by a power from below
Freedom just an empty well
Eternity, lost in a place called hell.

Suffering a tone to discriminate
Jealousy a stone, no one could cremate
It's vengeance witnessed by all
Inhabited in a swamp where
Merciless creatures crawl
