[music &amp; lyric: barthold]

To come back to you, oh, sweet days - Wild with the scent of sin
By the tombs of Pharaohs - We rode the desert
Back to these days again
Where we would feel the sun nailed to our skin

Back to these days of youth
With life for me and you

As I remember it all starts flowing - Like a rain that runs through me
All I ever wanted to have - All the things she brought to me

Back to these days of youth
With life for me and you

And I am lost in a memory of you
