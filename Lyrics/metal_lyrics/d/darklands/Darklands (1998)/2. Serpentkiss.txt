[music: sanga/bergius | lyric: barthold]

She hurt so bad, still I welcome her with open arms
Her eyes so green - Turns black in the dark

My heart infected with a serpentkiss
My heart infected, the reptile she is

She crawls me all over with the coldest stare
Eyes blackened like the colour of her hair
So fall and rise, fall and rise
Bring me down and cover my eyes

My heart infected with a serpentkiss
My heart infected, the reptile she is
