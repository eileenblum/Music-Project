[music: sanga | lyric: barthold]

The fragments of me, a tragedy
Brought to humankind in
this decadens of out time
A dying breed an death is in me
From decay an art was created
Wont you let it shine you through

Can you feel the velvet to your skin?
Can you feel the dust in you eyes?
I can see through your veil
'Cause what I lost is what I found

She looks into the light
Remember all those times
From decay an art was created
Wont you come and follow me through
Can you feel...

The beauty of decadens I bring to you
What you think of as beautiful
depends on from which view

Can you feel...
