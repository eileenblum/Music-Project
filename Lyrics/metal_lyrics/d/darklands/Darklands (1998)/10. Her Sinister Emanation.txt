[music: sanga/barthold | lyric: barthold]

So calm and peaceful in putrescence she lies
Her flesh like petals spread around for flies
Under the sun glowing yellow and red
Beauty and corruption upon her funeral bed
Her sinister emanation

Bring me honey and nectar - from the garden of delight
Fruit and blossom come out tonight

With flowers in bloom and sweet summerdays
Shall you be alike this filth in decay

See how everything is ment to be
See how everything in the end grows weak
I am yours in sickness and in suffering
