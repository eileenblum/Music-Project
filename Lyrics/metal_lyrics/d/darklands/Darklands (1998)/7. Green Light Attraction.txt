[music: bergius/barthold | lyric: barthold]

Through these waters - Down we go
My green light attraction - In a world unknown
Sheltered in the ocean - The tide takes me far
Rips the bluish vision as the fire gets my heart
Down on me, like you were before - Down on me
And I take you down beneath - Where I bring you back your sleep
I give you double the pleasure in stainless steel

Sun cast the wings that never learned to fly
Over the surface of this ocean - In which we're bound to lie
Wy tounge works with the water - Sea-green light attraction
And as we all the time sink further down
Of body and mind we are contradiction

Down on me...
