[music: sanga | lyric: barthold]

With a leather smile you embraced me
A taste of wine as you suck me in
The tenderness of the cunning snake
A chain of gold that crawls your skin
In the night I am your dawn
To illuminate your heart
The incense licks the walls
Into the exquisite, torn apart
Enshrouded in the blackest lace
Sweat and blood stain your lips

Flowers falls to the enchanting sounds
of music brought to life
The strings played on are the ones
between the two of us tied

Enshrouded in the blackest lace
Sweat and blood stain your lips
Lie down and close your eyes
Deliver yourself to ecstasy
Of ove and lust - Until the dawning of day
Of lve and lust - Here's a new night's ache

Let it go, just let it flow - Ride the morning sun
Seductive sense of never having enough
Ride the mourning son

Of love and lust...
