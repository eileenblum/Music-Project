[music: sanga/barthold | lyric: barthold]

[part I: The Gallery]

In this frustration - Mistake upon mistake
A chill inside that haunts me
My reflection in your gallery
In my reflection - Who are you in flesh depicted?
A face I'll only use for a while

These words without sound
These words echoes in me

The guilt weights heavy within
Beneath the skin and bones
There's someone telling me
Break the mirror and set me free

These words without sound
These words echoes in me

[part II: Quietus Of A Butterfly]

When the music has stopped
And lights are low
Will you turn your back on me?
Hate me for what I know?
'Cause I know, I know,
I swear you're there with me in my dreams
You're a poison running through my veins
a wound that just won't heal inside

'Cause I know, I know,
I swear you're there with me in my dreams
My butterfly sing for me
My butterfly drink me deep

Want to fly free but no wings will carry me
