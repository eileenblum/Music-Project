[music: bergius | lyric: barthold]

Drift with the flood 'cause the tide of change is coming round
Dance down the sky on tattered wings - I'm coming down

Just follow the water further
As we go with the flood just you and I
Under bloodred skies

The cry of times in tears we cry the tears of time
The dream starts pounding, coming back in this everflood

Just follow the water further
As we go with the flood just you and I
Under bloodred skies

These waves are ours to ride
This love is the change of our tide

Just follow the water further
As we go with the flood just you and I
Under bloodred skies
