[music &amp; lyric: barthold]

What do you see in these eyes of redemption
Wont you welcome me - I'm yours to suffer
Through the ages of time I am your saint
I gave away all my sins

Stashed away with the flowers
A black sheep ride - Take it down with fire
It's a black sheep day, but I wont be stashed away

All those emotions you were afraid to try
Angels of wisdom - Each one of you carries the devil inside
This cure is what you will need
When your fever start to work through the world

Stashed away with the flowers
A black sheep ride - Take it down with fire
It's a black sheep day, but I wont be stashed away
