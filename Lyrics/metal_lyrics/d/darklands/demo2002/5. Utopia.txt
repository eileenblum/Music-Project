[music &amp; lyric: barthold]

You went out on a voyage
And to me you did arive
The fears that you once burried
I'll make them come alive
Mind of me - We'll dream to be
creation into soil to suffer

Your past falls out of sight 
And you wish that you could see
The memories you once sheltered
I'll turn them into me

Mind of me...
for this immortal coil

The only world I ever knew
is the world that withers and fades
Take your utopia we'll disemble it again
A new age in oblivion
And a place to hide your mind
I'm a place of none existens
That you'll never find

Mind of me...
for this immortal coil

The only world...
