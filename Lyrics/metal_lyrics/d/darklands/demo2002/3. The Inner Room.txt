[music: bergius | lyric: barthold]

Wrap me up in your dreams - 'Cause I have lost the faith
Banished and thrown out - Try to save this prayer
And from the inner room I hear
Forever I'm with you
As we go down together we are syncronized

It's a long way to walk - A flame of hope on new ground
Low lit in this room - Yet so full of light
And from the inner room I hear

Forever I'm with you
As we go down together we are syncronized
