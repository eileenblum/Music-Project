[music &amp; lyric: barthold]

I linger in the air - Collect the dust you leave behind
What comes with your sweetness - Is such a painfull delight
Come to me in times when you
feel the need of someone who
can bring you somekind of sympathy

Let your thoughts flow free - Your eyes seems so adoring
I let it all flow free - While I mingel with the air

Come to me... Lay down your burdain - The longing kept me alive

Somekind of sympathy
