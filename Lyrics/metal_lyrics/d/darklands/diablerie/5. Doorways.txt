[music: sanga/bergius | lyric: barthold]

I have seen the angels die and fade away
And the rage of demons when they play
I have learned the tounge of gods lon since gone
I have watched the moon grow old and I have touched the sun

The doorway is open for me now - I could enter if I only knew how

Walk among the acient oaks with me
In the woods so dark is where youÂ´ll always be
So take my hand and I will lead you through
A drop of you blood and I will be there too

All my knowledge - All my wisdom gone to waste
I feel the lips of death and she is begging me to taste
