[music: sanga | lyric: burvall]

Lay your head down on my bed of petals
Prepare to let me take you away to serve me always
Mortal soul for you I will be
For you I will raise the ground and bring the heavens down

You are my fate, youÂ´re my dreams and you belong to me
The yearning sounds you make they leave me restless for the embrace

My blood is up by having you near, but your skin is dead cold
Our eyes they meet, but yours are absent

You are my fate, youÂ´re my dreams and you belong to me
The yearning sounds you make they leave me restless for the embrace
