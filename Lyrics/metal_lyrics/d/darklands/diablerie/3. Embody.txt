[music: sanga | lyric: barthold]

Your eyes they are the death of me
But never to be given - I am lost into your beauty
The winter of my lust

Your radiance is hurting inside of me
Strenght and warmth have left me

The winter of my lust - The winter of my longing

In this nightly chill - In her face
In the snow - Which I embody

Your eyes they are the death of me
But never to be given - I am lost into your beauty
The winter of my lust

The winter of my lust
