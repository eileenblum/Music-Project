[music &amp; lyric: jakob andersson]

Death reigns even in solitude - Spawn of such raging hate
In the city doth asleep - Underneath the sand and stones
RÂ´lyeh, the place of my dreams - Sunken so long ago
Awake ye demon without a mouth

In the town of wing and claws - High priest of the past awakes
The Absu roils, the sea turns red - Yes, heÂ´s rising from the deep

Dead but dreaming

Turns his face towards the sky - The sun goes down and daylight dies
Ancient evil, demon from the sea - Hear my prayer, let me come with thee

In the town of wing and claws - High priest of the past awakes
The Absu roils, the sea turns red - Yes, heÂ´s rising from the deep

Dead but dreaming
