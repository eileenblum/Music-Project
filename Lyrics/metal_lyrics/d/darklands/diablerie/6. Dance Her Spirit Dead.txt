[music: sanga/bergius | lyric: barthold]

A little girl, her heart of gold - For silvercoins her heart she sold
That little girl was led astray - With silvercoins she had to pay

See this ground, where she bled - Come with me and dance her sprit dead

And so the whispering winds weep her name

Her lips turned as blue as her empty eyes - On naked ground she naked lies
Come with me and burn our love - Come dance her spirit dead

See this ground, where she bled - Come with me and dance her sprit dead
