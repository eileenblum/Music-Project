I have seen the angels
die and fade away
And the rage of demons
when they play

I have learned the lounge
of gods, long since gone
I've watched the moon grow old
and I have touched the sun

The doorway is open for me now
I could enter if I only knew how

Walk among the ancient oaks with me
In the woulds so dark is where you'll always be
So take my hand and I will lead you through
A drop of your blood and I will be there too

All my knowledge
All my wisdom gone to waste
I feel the lips of death
And she is begging me to taste
