Death reigns - even in solitude
Spaun of such raging hate
In the city doth asleep
Underneath the sand and stones
R'lyeh - the place of my dreams
Sunken so long ago
Awake ye demon without a mouth

In the town of wings and claws
High-priest of the past awakes
The Absu(?), the sea turns red
Yes, he's rising from the deep

Dead but dreaming

Turns his face towards the sky
The sun goed down and daylight dies
Ancient evil - demon from the sea
Hear my prayers, let me come with thee

In the town of wings and claws
Dead but dreaming
