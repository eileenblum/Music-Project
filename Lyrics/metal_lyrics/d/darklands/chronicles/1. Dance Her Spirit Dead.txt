A little girl her heart of gold
For silvercoins her heart she sold
That little girl was led astray
With silvercoins she had to pay
See this gound, where she bled
Come with me and dance her spirit dead
And the whispering winds weep her name
Her lips turnes as blue as her empty eyes
On naked ground she naked lies
Come with me and burn our love
Come, dance her spirit dead
See this ground...
