[music: Sanga | lyric: Barthold]

They are like wolves
Crawling at my skin
You should come tonight
See this godless soul
And fall from grace

I bless you with this misery
Licking the blood of beast

You should come tonight
See this godless soul
Fall to this hollow ground
Fill these empty holes
And fall from grace
