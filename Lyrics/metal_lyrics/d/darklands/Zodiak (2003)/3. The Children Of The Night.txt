[music: Sanga | lyric: Barthold]

Angel, you're gonna weep tonight
See it reflect your crimson eyes
My little angel, you're gonna weep tonight
Free those tears you cannot hide
I got this fever coming
Boils inside
I got this thing for the children of the night

We sing along the fullmoon blues
Drink you dry that's what we gonna do
We're gonna sing along the fullmoon blues
Like I want you, You wanna have me too

I got this fever coming
Boils inside
I got this thing for the children of the night
I got this fever coming
Boils my blood
I got this thing for the children of the night
