[music: Sanga | lyric: Barthold]

Longing, climbing stairs in me
Forward and onward, trying to see
Don't fear the light glowing, glowing
Can't find the door that invites me in
Walk in silence together with me
Search for the zodiak lightened in me

Lightening the ground for us to see
Passing through the hours, waiting to b
Guided by the warmth and love
Given this time, given for good

Walk in silence together with me
Search for the zodiak lightened in me
Walk together, the sights to see
We'll share in memories, burning in me
