[music: Sanga | lyric: Barthold]

I wanna sell my soul to this bitter world
Try to make me whole in this bitter world
I gotta sell my soul in the bitter end
So I can lay myself to rest
I wanna taste your world
You know I won't lay down for less
Down you go this time
I don't care for why
Save your soul tonight

I wanna sell my soul to this bitter world
Try to make me whole in this bitter world
I wanna blame you all and burn all hopes gonna take the sunshine with me
I wanna waste your world
You know I won't lay down for less

Down you go this time
I don't care for why
Save your soul tonight

Hold me, save me
Forever I'll blame thee
For blaming it on shameless ones
and shameless I am
