[music: Sanga | lyric: Barthold]

Came to the flies
Came all the way back down
The voice of your brother's blood
Cries out from the ground I felt the taste
From the mourning in your heart
Blood for a feast
We share with everyone
Unchain the heart that holds me in this world
Sugar for the blood
That pumps beneath the soil

A winter's heart
That skates on through desire
Felt by the touch
The angels flames of fire
Unchain the heart
That beats on through this fire
Wait shame the blood
The fall of every girl

Unchain the heart that holds me in this world
Sugar for the blood
That pumps beneath the soil

Came to the flies
Came all the way back down
The voice of your brother's blood cries out
I felt the taste
From the mourning in your heart
Blood for a feast
We share with every god

Unchain the heart that holds me in this world
Sugar for the blood
That pumps beneath the soil
