In this life there is no hope for souls that hide away
from the side of truth that shows their sinful face
one of them, I lay my damaged shield and cried for rest
and prayed to the sky to revive me so Iâll just

Let it rain,
let the drops wash away the pain
help me survive
what I deny, I deny

Consolation cannot come until I dare to make
My first step from past towards what lies ahead
Can no longer choose to hate myself and never wake
from this torment that defines who I am, Iâll

Let it rain,
let the drops wash away the pain
help me survive
what I deny, I deny

Water will bring it to life
The heart that I once held mine

Let it rain,
let the drops wash away the pain
help me survive
what I deny, I deny
