Reasoning can get me nowhere
when all is silent but the voices
echoing within sweet nightmares
sedating innocence

This isnât a story of fighting evil
but a matter of what will become
of the force in me, my own demons
never left alone, how can I win?

Knowing what is right makes it more
alluring to do what is too wrong to
deny me the chance to go through
what I feared all along

This isnât a story of fighting evil
but a matter of what will become
of the force in me, my own demons
never left alone, how can I win?

(Iâm what you crave) Get out of my head
(youâll feel the primal bliss)
with my, my Nemesis
(youâve made your choice)
youâll be my only voice
(your egoâs drowned in dust
God, forgive me for this lust)
restless of heart
silenced the mind
never alone
voices, they call

This isnât a story of fighting evil
but a matter of what will become
of the force in me, my own demons
never left alone, how can I win?
