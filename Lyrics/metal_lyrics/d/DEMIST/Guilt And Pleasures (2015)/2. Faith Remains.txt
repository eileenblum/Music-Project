Once upon a time a child opened her eyes to dawn
Only to find nothing more than the pain of love all gone
Whispering to the winds she leaned outside the present's doors
Reaching out to the hands of night to carry her lost soul

Accept your fears as your illusions
Redeem your sins and start anew

Remember what has brought you here
All the pain and loss were not there all in vain
Hold on to what you know when the storm's drawing near
Come what may, the faith remains

One more night a weary man sat crying on the bed
Wondering why life passes by with nothing but regret
Thousand hopes betrayed him as not one did soothe the pain
Suddenly, his lost reflection showed a smiling face

It's not too late to make your choices
Retrace your steps and start again

Remember what has brought you here
All the pain and loss were not there all in vain
Hold on to what you know when the storm's drawing near
Come what may, the faith remains
