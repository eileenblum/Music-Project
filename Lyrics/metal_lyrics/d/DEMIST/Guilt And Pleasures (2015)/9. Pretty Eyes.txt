Theyâve taken our fathers, our friends and our brothers
and now they are coming for us
demanders for labor donât care much for gender
and just now you say itâs enough

tell me, what are you good for?
perfect mask and nothing more
so you think that you have it all?

throw it all away
all we have fought for, all we could
become, âcause in your pretty eyes
itâs all the same, behind the surface polished
thereâs too little substance

you talk of equality, no personality
looks get the message across
your sultry voice doesnât speak for us all
Iâd rather yell my truth alone!

Look no further whatâs gone wrong
why our role is the same old
you just perpetuate the cause

throw it all away
all we have fought for, all we could
become, âcause in your pretty eyes
itâs all the same, behind the surface polished
thereâs too little substance

Have we really changed enough
to break through walls of glass
when our own have sold us out
for fame and fortune
