Stop! This old game will take its toll
By their strings I hang as though
They know what I'm good for
In the end, no one's left but me to blame
Glad they're happy as I am
Crying out for more!

Too many people I see falling deeper
Being what I used to be -- someone's mirror!

All I had to give could never make me be
Good enough to be nothing more than me
Pushed too far, I've seen the darkest Hell
Is the one you draw yourself

Wrongs I have done have made me hide
My true colors deep inside
To mourn all that has died
Now I fear there is nothing stronger yet
That would take away the hate
The mirrored eyes reflect?

Too many scars to forgive what I've become
How can they free me if I'm self-imprisoned?

All I had to give could never make me be
Good enough to be nothing more than me
Pushed too far, I've seen the darkest Hell
Is the one you draw yourself

Silence regret,
Forgive, forget
The only way to escape the past!

All I had to give could never make me be
Good enough to be nothing more than me
Pushed too far, I've seen the darkest Hell
Is the one you draw yourself
