You think you know what you see
but Iâm hiding within
and I fear I canât let
you to venture in

building walls so glass wonât break
keeps the warmth of sun away
all my love canât hide the truth
I canât trust in you

caress me, possess me
and show me how to feel
Iâll learn what to act out
my wallâs not coming down!

born a child of broken dreams
in hate generation
fed on constant fear and need
for something more

fire burns in me but canât release all
this cold, it owns my soul

Craving victories I find
just more disappointment
running backwards not to risk
to lose again

fire burns in me but canât release all
this cold, it owns my soul

Sorrow I find
keeps me insane
too much to bleed
enough to sustain
