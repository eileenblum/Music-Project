Wake up, one more day will come to pass
in this devastated field of battles past
worthless, the descendants of the great
those who fought for life till death
which we await

Bright to see it, dull to change it
weâre the generation gray
no greater deed will earn us glory
our legacy will fade

Weâve been raised on tales that weâd amount
to something greater yet, without a doubt
weâd fight if we only knew what for
so we fight amongst ourselves
to prove our worth

Bright to see it, dull to change it
weâre the generation gray
no greater deed will earn us glory
our legacy will fade

Bright to see it, dull to change it
weâre the generation gray
no greater deed will earn us glory
our legacy will fade
