Take another step down, deeper
donât we have a show for you
moonlit lace and velvet crimson
tightened passion piercing through

Itâs safe in the dark, ah
no sin leaves a mark

Welcome to the underworld
wine is flowing, eyes all glowing
welcome to the netherworld
skin is showing, souls all lonely
ah, youâre one of us now!

Donât be shy, you know you yearn, too
hands all over, whoâs to see?
Blood-red lips, cold eyes that crave you
allâs allowed and nothingâs real!
Donât question whatâs right
give in to the night

Welcome to the underworld
wine is flowing, eyes all glowing
welcome to the netherworld
skin is showing, souls all lonely
ah, youâre one of us now!
