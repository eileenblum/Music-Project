In the miracle of love, weâve tried it all
Nothing seemed too good to break the fall
Once we found the joy in lust
that knows no bounds to quench the call
corruption took its toll

Change all that I am
until Iâm down on my knees give me no peace
take your place in our play
theater of agony brings our release

Thereâs no shame in what we want for we both need
our primal urge to take the lead
purest sentiments are fine,
but something else betters the game
pleasure of pain

Change all that I am
until Iâm down on my knees give me no peace
take your place in our play
theater of agony brings our release
