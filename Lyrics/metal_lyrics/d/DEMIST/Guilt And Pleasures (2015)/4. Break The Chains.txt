I will feed on your frail ego
after building it up, I tell you
all affection begs for action
nothingâs secret enough

wake, habit is pulling you deep
silence is all you can hear
where laughter should be
break the chains of sweet memories
you may act how you should feel, yet
itâs not how it is

Now you see me as a temptress
here to break you apart
I donât really have that power
you were gone from the start

wake, habit is pulling you deep
silence is all you can hear
where laughter should be
break the chains of sweet memories
you may act how you should feel, yet
itâs not how it is

Face it,
closing your eyes wonât change
what lies within
your deepest fears,
your wishes have brought
you to my open arms
