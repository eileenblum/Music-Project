Into constant evolution
We must face constant problematics.
Ideal in deconstruction,
Investments we place in the matrix.
A more comfortable digestion
That obliterate liberty's risks.

Stop compromising
In order to cease fear,
'Cause compromising is
Our weakness drawing clear.

Dwelling deeper within our scheme
To find dysfunction in the foundation.
Or contemplating the machine
And cover the dissatisfaction.
All material is used in
Constructing motionless creation.

To revise blueprints
Makes our self-esteem fall,
Giving us the hints
Of a breach in the wall.

Bureaucratized intelligence
Is leading to obsolescence.
A paralytic enterprise
When stress and structure are synchronised.

A process led to inertia
Wallows among the same obstacles.
Measures to avoid those traumas
Keep decay that preserves the feeble.
The ones who sold their foveas
Somehow made the deal acceptable.
