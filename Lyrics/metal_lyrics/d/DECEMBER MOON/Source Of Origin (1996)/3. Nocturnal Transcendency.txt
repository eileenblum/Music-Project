I swoon as I ascend this lifeless body
Thoughts perish as I pass between worlds,
Confused I direct my eyes, perchance to see...
With sorrow I remember lost surroundings,
The taste of wonder collapsed to solemnity,
Meanings fade and wither in my unholy tomb

My abudance being my only regret,
Brighter than life yet infinity damned,
To be or not is no longer any question!
I bid welcome to the realm of conception
Unable to realise my bleak surroundings,
The further I reach, the darker I shine,
And nothing else reveals...

Exposing my force to swirling void,
Outstretched hands of no avail,
I yearn for none of this cold desolation
As I transcend my present state
Images of my former existence,
Return again to tease my being
I see despondency from my only portal...

Through helplessness I find security,
This conciousness is neverending...
As my minds eye twists into ecstasy
All is dark and dismally blessed...
In this castle I am lord,
And here I shall reign forevermore,
Tomorrows dreams... Sleep perchance to dream!
