[D.C. Lacroix; lyrics are by Sylvie Lacroix]

I'm walkin' through the garbage
Of the mornin' after
Getting' ready to rock one more night
We're here for the same things
To dance and get wild
We'll all remember this night forever

[Chorus]
We are the force

I feed off your rage
Help you to escape
We'll all walk a few feet higher
The night is yours and mine
To do what we want to with
We'll throw a party and you're all invited

[Chorus]

This army has no rules
We break them as we rock on
We'll have our fun while we're young enough to
With my guitar and leather
I'm armed for a good time
You know and I know what we're gonna do

[Chorus]
