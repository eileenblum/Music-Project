[D.C. Lacroix; lyrics are by Sylvie Lacroix]

You paint such a pretty little picture
An honest face and a perfect manner
A missed place soul that loves to hate
And it rots away your mind

[Chorus]
You're the devil's son

You live to show me such a bad, bad time
You go out of your way to destroy
You're growin' old but you won't die
Who wears your pain

[Chorus]

You never come out in the light of day
That's a strange way to behave
You paid your price to live in hell
And you're tryin' to take me down

[Chorus]
