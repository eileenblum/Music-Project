[D.C. Lacroix; lyrics are by Sylvie Lacroix]

Racin' to save my life, a panic highway ride
Runnin' days and runnin' nights just to get you
Out of my sight

[Chorus]
Black leather monster, on my trail
Hardcore rider, dark shadow rider
Black leather monster, on a demon machine
Black leather monster, trying to get me

The night turns into day
The road starts to fade
I shift to overdrive
To keep you one step behind

[Chorus]

Black leather monster with your whips and chains
Tryin' to get me, baby, well you need a lot of
Class and taste, it's a race against time
You know, yours and mine, and right now only

The winner is going to survive
And it's gotta be me

Racin' to beat the law
You've got me on the run
I've got to win this race
'Cuz it's my life at stake

[Chorus]
