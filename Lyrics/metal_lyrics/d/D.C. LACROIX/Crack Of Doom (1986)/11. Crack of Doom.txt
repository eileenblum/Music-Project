[D.C. Lacroix; lyrics are by Sylvie Lacroix]

Raging thunder, the sky is falling down
Mother Nature seeking revenge
Don't go! Stay back!
Build your fortress
Wait for heaven, over hell

[Chorus]
Here comes the end
Crack of doom

It's no wonder, the end is coming near
People runnin', livin' in fear
Hey you! Look here!
Watch my bloody flow
Run for shelter, save your souls

[Break]

The winds are restless tonight
You better find yourself some shelter
There's no tellin' what could happen
It's beyond anyone's control
It's beyond good and evil
