[D.C. Lacroix; lyrics are by Sylvie Lacroix]

I wake up tired, on the dark side
Don't feel the same as last night
I try to get up, but I fall down
Day of darkness

Oh! Take it away, draw the curtains
I don't want to see the light of this dark day
Gonna be a

[Chorus]
Black Sunday

I'm lookin' hard for an answer
Can't seem to find it nowhere
I try to change my deadly mood
Makes me crazy

Oh! Let me start over, it's getting worse
I want to forget this day ever happened
Go away

[Chorus]
