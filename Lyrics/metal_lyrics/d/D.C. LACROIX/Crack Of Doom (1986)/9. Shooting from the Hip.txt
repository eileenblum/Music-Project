[D.C. Lacroix; lyrics are by Sylvie Lacroix]

Sun sets low and the darkness creeps
That's the time when I hit the streets
I can walk without makin' any noise
I'm a cat that lived all nine lives

[Chorus 1]
My aim is right on and I'm
Shooting from the hip
You're in my sights, boy, and I'm
Shooting from the hip
We're all alone now and I'm
Shooting from the hip
Don't try to run now
Shooting from the hip

[Chorus 2]
My aim is right on, and I'm
Shooting from the hip
Your is my sights, boy
Shooting from the hip

Think you got it made, better think twice
I have plans for you, boy, turn your inside out
I've been watching you, called you once or twice
Gonna wait for dark to make my move

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
