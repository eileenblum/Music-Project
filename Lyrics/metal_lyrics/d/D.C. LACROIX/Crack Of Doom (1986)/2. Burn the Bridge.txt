[D.C. Lacroix; lyrics are by Sylvie Lacroix]

Take what you want from me, boy
I know that won't be enough
You've got a dirty greedy soul, boy
Leave while you have a chance
Before I get real mad
I've had it up to here with you and

[Chorus]
I'm gonna burn the bridge with you

Keep your tricks up your sleeves
Don't show them off to me, please
I've seen them all before you, boy

[Chorus]

Take what you want from me, boy
I know that won't be enough
You've got a dirty greedy soul, boy
One chance is all you get with me
One chance is all you'll ever see
One chance is what you really need now

[Chorus]
