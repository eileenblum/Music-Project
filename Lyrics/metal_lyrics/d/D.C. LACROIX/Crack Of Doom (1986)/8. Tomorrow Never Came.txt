[D.C. Lacroix; lyrics are by Sylvie Lacroix]

We never had a warning
Didn't get a chance to live, no
Everything we believed in
Fell into oblivion

Too bad for the young
Too bad for us

One mistake and we all pay
We live in the last days
Can we stop this madness?
Or are we the last race?

Too bad for the young
Too bad for us
For the young tomorrow never came
For the young tomorrow never came
For the young tomorrow never came

There was no time to explain
This world to the children
Why we burn and we bleed
All in the name of peace
