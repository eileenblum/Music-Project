[D.C. Lacroix; lyrics are by Sylvie Lacroix]

You took off for the ride of your life
History was made as you
Climbed your way to the stars
Rocks a billion years old
Pass up with indifference
A ship load of enthusiasts
Fulfilling comic book dreams

[Chorus]
The day of two suns
The day of two suns

The fight for peace has finally dies
Heated tempers revenge
Fingers pointing in all directions
Everyone is to blame
For the fallen angels' wish
And somewhere somebody is cryin'
The tears I feel inside

[Chorus]

Will there ever be a safe landing
Or are we in our tombs
Floating in timeless space
Do I think myself lucky?
Survivor of self-destruction
And where the hell did heaven go?
And what am I heading for?

[Chorus]
