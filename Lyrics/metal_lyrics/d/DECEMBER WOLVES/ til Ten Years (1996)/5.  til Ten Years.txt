Looking close at what remains, my eyes, so burning, see...
And limping across the frosted plains with what's to be.
In midst of fight to lose my feathers, together so entwined...
And so the story of my endeavors, bells have finally chimed..

I looked to the sky in desperate search for the sun,
yearning to taste the fruits whom so many have won...
Buried in ice, so eager that life be enhanced...
I see them float, the Angels so often do prance...

But I am still buried in the ice.

"We keep him close, bound by trust.
With no hope or desire to ever leave us...
Armies bound in swift Angelic fashion.
Here lies the aura of Divinity on the plain of unearthly passion."

...And suddenly an oasis... A feeling not felt for centuries.
This was not in the dream, the dream of my mourning seasons,
whence the trees are my shoulders and I swim in leaves.
I can feel the others, and my token: for seven days they let me go.

I looked to the sky in desperate search for the sun,
yearning to taste the fruits whom so many have won...
Buried in ice, so eager that life be enhanced...
I see them float, the Angels so often do prance...

...And once venturing home, his mind told mine "You've known all this time..." I can feel the others, the ones lost, the ones that walk by, the ones who call my name three times. I see them when no one else can. Perhaps they too know. They'll recognize us, so suddenly conspicious, so diverse. But behold the elements of the binding.
"I also knew back then. Do you remember?"

I looked to the eyes of the master to which I am slave...
Soul enemies of the forces to me have depraved...
charisma guides me to the land of the kings and the Queens...
I've all the wisdom, and not one phantom longer dimeans.
