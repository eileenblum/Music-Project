I gaze throughout the midnight mist absorbing winter typhoon
I lay myself in fields of white admiring the crescent moon
The frigid snow beneath my back sends chills throughout my spine
The sound of (dead) leaves and whistling winds flows through ears of mine

"I call upon Thee Mighty Arzel, who stands in the East!
...To assist me in this and all my ventures! I know now that my
new Avatar Power is flooding to the surface!"
(I now close my eyes gently)

I gaze through the midnight mist into the sparkling precious night
Many a star are glistening of the gracious lunar light
Preparing for flight journey into the clear dark sky
As sharply frozen December flakes build icing around my eyes
I soar, throughout the mist, December night
Cresent-shaped moon, ride the winds, frost on my face
Twinkling stars, whistling winds, lips split, eyes cannot see
Covered with ice, frozenous flight, cold flakes
Cover my face, build on my teeth, cling to my hair
My cape, flows in the breeze, blowing of mist
Clenching my fist, I fly, fingernails black, no turning back
New Avatar Power!

"In the name of those who control the Astral planes, I intend
to enter your domain. I come with this word of new power:
SHEM-HAM-FOR-ASS! Thou shalt permit me free entry and access. So mode it be!"

I soar throughout the mist, basking in the gleam of the stars
My body rises form twinkling snow and frozen hills of ours
My eyes are broken open, into the crystal night I stare
For now, my only sensation is the skywind blowing through my hair
Strolling through the sky and unholy mysticism
The moonlight glistens upon my (war) painted face
Through ages of avatar meditation
My soul will fly free in Astral levitation
Now I spring with bliss, through the midnight mist
Cold December frost, crescent moon I kiss
Soaring through ice - sky, reflection (of the crescent moon) in my eyes
(My eyes) seem as though to glow
