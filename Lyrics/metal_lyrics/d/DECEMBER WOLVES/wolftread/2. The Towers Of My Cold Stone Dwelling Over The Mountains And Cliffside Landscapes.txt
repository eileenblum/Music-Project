I am the Rohed figure of the wind shadow
My body is not to be seen
See the towers of my funeral over the mountains cliffside landscapes
The one of whom the villagers speak...
Though I've never been seen before
I hibernate in my castle through the Spring and Summer sun...
...And in the Autumn... in the midst of October
...I awaken ...in perfect time for the first snow fall
...and my tomb has beared the warmth of a thousand spring suns...
And my cape has beared the chill of a thousand October breezes...
And my eyes have beared the frost of a thousand December winds!
I roam the paths of the landscapes
My towers pierce through the overcast
My body fades in the spring mist
And the soft spring winds despise me
I'm the one of whom the villagers speak
Though my shadow is all to be seen
They know enough not to trespass through my mountains and cliffside landscapes!
...and I have slept beneath the avalanches...
...and I have treaded the glaciers...
...and my cape has swept...
The mountains and cliffside landscapes...
