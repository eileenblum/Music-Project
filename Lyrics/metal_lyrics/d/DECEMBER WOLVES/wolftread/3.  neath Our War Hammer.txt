Hell and war! Blowing out their candle prayers
La Sallette Shrine! Desecration in the station of crosses
Spit back the bread (in the priests face)
And poisoning the holy water
Crucifix tomb! Degraded with the mark of war!

'Neath our Warhammer
Blow the withering dusts of God's "army"
'Neath our Warhammer
I slay the doers of peace with my holocaustsword!

Only begotten son, can you hear me?
WAR ....HAMMER!

'Neath our Warhammer
La Sallette Shrine and grave desecration!
'Neath our Warhammer
I left my fuckin' warmark and now I'll fly away!

Spikes and chains! Nails protruding from our gauntlet arms!

Spiting fire, into the praying hands of God!
.........Raising the hammer and battle-ax!
Killing Jews! ...weaklings who dare to obstruct our path!
Cahtolics! ..drowning in our vast seas of spit
Desecration! ...with pride we do our work...
