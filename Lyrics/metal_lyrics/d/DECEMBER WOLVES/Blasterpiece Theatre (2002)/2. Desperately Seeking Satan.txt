PPrPrepare population for quick decent! With slugs of global
proportions, it won't be our blood on Satan's claw. I stayed
in one place as long as I could...To hail the New Dawn and to
be a Satanic human being....And reverse the karma of a ******
Jesus.
I do declare...It's a fuckin' shame.
In charge of projects, moreover, meant to clean. Liberation
here, will disappear. Bring them where they cannot flee...
Bestow their final agony!
Hang them on crosses...Divide them by sex and race....Then lop
off their hands in strict accordance with the Devil's demands.
Rocking back and forth...a dirty degenerate dynasty.
Satan!...We're desperately seeking Satan...We're desperately
seeking Satan!
The candidate for international conspiracy....Save the planet
from abduction and futility...Preside over supremacy!
