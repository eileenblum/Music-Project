Enter the night
Which gives him the might
Over lives of the mortals
And give life eternal
He is the undead
Condemned to the living death
And eternal hunger
For living blood
He commands the winds
And the powers of the storm
He leads the force of the darkness
And the beasts of the earth

He's the prince, prince, prince of the night
He is the last, last, last of his kind

He stalks at the nights
And rests at the daytime
Gaining his power
In his vampire's box
He appears as a mist
Deeper than nightfog
With deathlike silence
Vanish he will

He's the prince, prince, prince of the night
He is the last, last, last of his kind
