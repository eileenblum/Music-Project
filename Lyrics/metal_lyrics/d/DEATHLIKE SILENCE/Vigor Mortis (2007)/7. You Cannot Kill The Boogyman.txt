Late night again, it's time to go to sleep
Like every child you have to go
But you don't want to, you are afraid of the dark
Don't wanna meet the boogyman
Just last night he was after you, you had to run away from him all night
Oh, mother please, could I sleep next to you?
So you can slay him if he comes

No, my little darling, you cannot kill the boogyman
Every time you do it, he comes back knife in hand
If you try to hide, find you he will
Try to be faster, the boogyman you can not kill

You have to sleep alone, there's no one here with you
The night begins when lights go off
You are petrified, hardly dare to breath
Listen to the rustles from around
You sense the boogyman, feel he's watching you
Knowing that soon you have to run
You have a plan, don't wanna fear no more
You know where father keeps his gun

No, my little darling, you cannot kill the boogyman
Every time you do it, he comes back knife in hand
If you try to hide, find you he will
Try to be faster, the boogyman you can not kill
