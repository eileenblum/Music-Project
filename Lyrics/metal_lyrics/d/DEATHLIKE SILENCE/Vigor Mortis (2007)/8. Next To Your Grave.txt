Morning comes, I lose you again
Because the light, to you is the end
I can't wait, for the night to fall, so I lay, next to your grave
Every night, I wait for you to come

Now when you are gone my life is gray, slowly fade away
You still come to me, almost every night, you bring me life
Please, take me with you, I wish on a star, make me like you are
Us, together forever, we could be, all eternity

Every night, you come to me
You won't stay, even if I beg you please
You say you love me, but I wonder if it's true
If you wound, you'd make me be yours to be
Every night, I wait for you to come

Now when you are gone my life is gray, slowly fade away
You still come to me, almost every night, you bring me life
Please, take me with you, I wish on a star, make me like you are
Us, together forever, we could be, all eternity
