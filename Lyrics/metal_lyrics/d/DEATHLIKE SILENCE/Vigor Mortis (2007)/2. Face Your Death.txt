Full moon opens up the sore like many centuries before
Tonight you should stay home and lock up your doorways
Tonight is the night when he rise from his grave
Moon gives the light when he's stalking like always, people are scared,
who will end for his pray.

Face your death - when you see the red eyes
Face your death - there your destiny lies
Face your death - convicted to his needs
Face your death - for his glory one bleeds

When first sun beams brings the light at the dawn, you feel relieved,
you did survive this time.
Serenity will last only till next full moon, then night of evil will come once again..

Face your death - when you see the red eyes
Face your death - there your destiny lies
Face your death - convicted to his needs
Face your death - for his glory one bleeds
