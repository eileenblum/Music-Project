The darkness is falling down, again
Need to fill up my appetite, my veins
Across the darkness and misty chambers
Coming through back to you, my angel
For your innocent and sweet blood
It gives me strength and makes me your god

Before the dawn, before the dawn
I must leave you alone
I can't be touched by the sunlight
Before the dawn, before the dawn
You will see I will be gone
Before that I want to make things right,
make things right!

I give my dark gift to you, the life
After you have passed away, you rise
You will stay young through ages
Live the moments that stays in pages
Like a dream that is never ending
There will be only one demanding

Before the dawn, before the dawn
I must leave you alone
I can't be touched by the sunlight
Before the dawn, before the dawn
You will see I will be gone
Before that I want to make things right,
make things right!
