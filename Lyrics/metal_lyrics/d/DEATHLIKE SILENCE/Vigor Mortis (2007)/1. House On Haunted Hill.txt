Two hundred years ago there lived a man well known
that man, he was firmly insane
He captured little kids and kept them in the binds
Those children died slowly in pain
At last they tracked him down and awful truth was found
To be buried alive was his doom
He spelled curse on the place that no-one can't efface
It'll last with the flowers on his tomb

So many years of decay, but the place is standing still
So many tears wailed away, in that house on haunted hill
Land has been cursed since the day he was buried alive
All there is dead except his grave, those flowers never die

Long time passed away, a young man bought the place
and moved in to make it his home
First morning he was dead, torso lied at his bed
His head was found top of the dome
There was blood everywhere, people started to scare
At last the old curse had come true
So if you pass the place and strange voice calls your name
Don't stop or next victim is you

So many years of decay, but the place is standing still
So many tears wailed away, in that house on haunted hill
Land has been cursed since the day he was buried alive
All there is dead expect his grave, those flowers never die
