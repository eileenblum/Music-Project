Everything happened years ago
Still remember it like today
Can't realize that even now
How dead ones got up from their graves

Stars like diamonds in the sky
Tonight the demons, let their sleeping corpses lie
Tonight, and no one cries
It is so peacefull tonight
Don't wake the demons, let their sleeping corpses lie
Tonight, and no one dies

Those things were evil and full of hate
And they were hunting human beings
All they could catch they killed and ate
That kind of thing were never seen

Stars like diamonds in the sky
Tonight the demons, let their sleeping corpses lie
Tonight, and no one cries
It is so peacefull tonight
Don't wake the demons, let their sleeping corpses lie
Tonight, and no one dies
