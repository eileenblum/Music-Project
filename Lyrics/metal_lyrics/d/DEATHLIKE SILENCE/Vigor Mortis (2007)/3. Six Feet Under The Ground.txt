Once there was a time when you were part of the cream
Beautiful, famous people, life was like a dream
The sparkling of champagne, the touch of soft red lips
Music and laughter, young swinging hips
Now it's gone, you're alone
Sleeping there on your own
Days gone by, slowly die
In the endless stream of time

Cloaked in the velvet of an endless night,
surrounded by your only friend, sweet silence
You sleep at the end of the black rainbow
Six feet under the ground
Your sleep is death, your dreams just a void
Your memories are gone with the wind
You lie deep, down in the dark
Six feet under the ground

You were warned before, the wind could turn east
Your growing need for pleasure led you to the beast
It turned your mind to black and made you cross the line
You had it all, but you just were not satisfied
Now it's gone, you're alone
Sleeping there on your own
Days gone by, slowly die
In the endless stream of time

Cloaked in the velvet of an endless night,
surrounded by your only friend, sweet silence
Your sleep is death, your dreams just a void
Your memories are gone with the wind
You lie deep, down in the dark
Six feet under the ground
