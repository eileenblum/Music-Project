There is no life in you, your blood is cold
But your heart is still beating, beating slow
No one knows your name, your memory is gone
There is no one else like you, you're all alone
You made a deal with the one, human blood no more
To warm up your veins, the way you've lived before
When their world is silent, you sense a young maiden's thoughts
"Give me life eternal, let me be yours"
"Bite me, bite me"

Bite me - let me in your life
Bite me - take me for your bride
Bite me - fill me with your strength
Bite me - pure pleasure, don't repent

A long time ago you were powerfull and young
You had your secret - living blood kept your strong
You found a beauty that made you blind and weak
Uncovered your shelter, made you fall in love so deep
The one found your weakness and made you swear
Give up your dark powers, or you will see her nevermore
A thousand years has gone, your senses are still strong
Maidens are still calling: "Let us be yours"
"Bite me, bite me"

Bite me - let me in your life
Bite me - take me for your bride
Bite me - fill me with your strength
Bite me - pure pleasure, don't repent
