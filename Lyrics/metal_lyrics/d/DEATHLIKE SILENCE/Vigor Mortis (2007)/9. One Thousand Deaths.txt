Hammers crush your head
Feel the life escaping from you
The car hits, you're dead
Your body smashed against the avenue
Murderer shoots you down
Blood is running through your fingers
You go under and drown
Slowly falling into darkness

So many ways to leave behind this world
You're cursed to live through them all
You gotta live one thousand deaths
Feel killer fingers around your neck
Die by all the ways there ever will be
You gotta live one thousand deaths
Feel burning bullet in your head
Die by all the ways there ever will be

Nervegas bars you breath
Your body convulsions are failing slowly
By freezing to death
Before the end you can't feel your body
Trapped in fire
Flames embracing you all over
Drugs are your desire
The overdose kills you with power

So many ways to leave behind this world
You're cursed to live through them all
You gotta live one thousand deaths
Feel killer fingers around your neck
Die by all the ways there ever will be
You gotta live one thousand deaths
Feel burning bullet in your head
Die by all the ways there ever will be
