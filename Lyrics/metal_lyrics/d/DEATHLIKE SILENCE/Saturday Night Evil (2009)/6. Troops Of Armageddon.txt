Ages has man walked the globe
And ruled on top of the food chain
All along without hesitation,
Abused, raped and looted the earth

Till one day we woke some menacing
Evil that is hard to explain,
Lain dormant it had for eons,
Proving now, what it's worth

The predators has turned to the prey
There is nothing more to do but pray

The legion of bat-winged devils unleashed,
Seeding destruction, they can't be appeased.
Annihilating the mankind, blood darkens the sun,
When dust has settled, survivors are none.

The formation of grisly demons,
Maiming everyone on their path.
Followed by the metallic monsters,
Leaving behind the scorched earth.

The cohort of rude behemoths,
Tears down every structure with wrath
When it comes your turn to face them, You will regret your birth

The day of the doom has arrived
The troops of Armageddon ride

The legion of bat-winged devils unleashed,
Seeding destruction, they can't be appeased.
Annihilating the mankind, blood darkens the sun,
When dust has settled, survivors are none.
