In a dim room lies this old and bitter man
Hence the gnawing illness it is all he can.
Grievous pain he suffers, enormous agony.
It nearly crushes him but still he wants to be

Alive to avenge the loved one he once had,
Departed violently, by murderer gone mad.
Devoting rest his life to getting his revenge,
Never found the killer, hatred had to quench.

Sorrow, has overwhelmed his mind
Hollow, is his life of some kind
Shadows, lives within his heart and
Follows, till death tears apart

Time is standing still but he just holds on tight
Blinded by the fact that he can't win this fight
Now the death has arrived to reap this draw so sour
Only waiting for the raven-winged hour

Sorrow, has overwhelmed his mind
Hollow, is his life of some kind
Shadows, lives within his heart and
Follows, till death tears apart
