The ground is wet
Underneath my boots when I walk again
Across this old graveyard
Tombstones
Sigh with me when I start to
Digging my way

Oh feel my arms aching
Oh feel the soil braking

Who's gonna bury me, when I'm old and done?
Who's gonna lay my bones to their everlasting home?

Buried my father
And everyone I ever knew
No daughter, nor son to get me through
I'm ageing with these
Trees around me and the stones sigh
As I pass them by

Oh feel the times changing
Oh feel my arms aching
