Shades appear around you
As you lie down to sleep

Silent whispers in the dark
Horrid shapes, deformities
Cringe and close your eyes
Beg the horrors, 'leave me be'
Alone you face your beast,
Shuddering as you weep

Shadows fall, the night's here
Faces haunt my dreams
Cries from times forgotten
Of Old evils

Visions roam your mind
Sunken cities, forgotten crimes
From dark corners of the earth,
Tales from wicked times
Yield to the fear
Alone and battered in the dark
The nightmare now reality
A hollow shell, insanity
