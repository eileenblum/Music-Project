Down in darkness, in the ocean,
Lies the baleful lair of the deep ones
Part monsters, part human,
Life eternal live these creatures
Done their deed, done their duty
Sacrificed their lives for his glory
Another breed, lost their beauty
Ain't from tales for bedtime story

Plunge down there and meet your fate
Worship him or confront his hate

DAGON - the elder god of evil
DAGON - before his might you'll kneel
DAGON - or devour you he will
DAGON - and no one hears your squeal

Sleepy village hides a secret
They revere this ancient demon
All arrivals will be tied up
And then offered for ascription
Of the females all the fertiles
Have to bear a scion for him
Spare the details for casting chills
Of those children's deformed limbs

Plunge down there and meet your fate
Worship him or confront his hate

DAGON - the elder god of evil
DAGON - before his might you'll kneel
DAGON - or devour you he will
DAGON - and no one hears your squeal
