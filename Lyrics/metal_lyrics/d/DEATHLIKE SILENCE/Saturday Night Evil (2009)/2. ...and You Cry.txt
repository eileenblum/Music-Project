Chained down hands and feet you find yourself,
With pain shooting through your every single limb.
Deprived of sight you have to feel around,
But there are walls on every single side and

They seem to be closing in on you.
Shivering with fear you feel the panic rising.

And you cry,
With your chest constructing and your
Sightless eyes
They are burning holes into your
Aching head.
Your heart is failing and you are
Filled with dread,
Fear consumes your soul.

You find your hands clawing at something,
Only to realize it's your face they're scarring.
Frantically you go on pawing.
The warmth of your own blood almost soothing.

Leering hateful faces fill your head,
Jeering voices that want you dead.
