What was that noise
Off in the dark?
Something that's poised
Waiting to spring
And rend her flesh,
She is the victim.

Her cheeks are wet
They taste of salt
Her innocence
Won't go unharmed
Only fifteen, there's no escaping her plight.

She runs painlessly, trapped in the night
Fleeing from monsters and murderous wights.
The trees around her are
Malevolent beings, fiends who'll hunt her down.
The ground is painted red with her blood.

He runs alone
With nothing there
To help, to guide him.
The stars are lost
Amongst the clouds,
Their light won't find him.

Oh how he cries,
Tears in his eyes.
His innocence
Will come to harm.
Only thirteen, there's no escaping, no flight.

He runs painlessly, trapped in the night
Fleeing from monsters and murderous wights.
The trees around her are
Malevolent beings, fiends who'll hunt her down.
The ground is painted red with his blood.
