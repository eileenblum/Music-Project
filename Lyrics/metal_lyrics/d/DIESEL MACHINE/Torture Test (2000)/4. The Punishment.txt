what's wrong with you?
protecting criminals from death
you take another life
you deserve to die like all the rest

revenge is lost on death row they laugh at us
the sentence means nothing
violence goes unpunished again

justice will be done, I'll see to it
you will die, make no mistake of it

the punishment fits the crime

the solution is right in front of your face
any method works
electrocute, hang, or inject

justice will be done, I'll see to it
you will die, make no mistake of it

the punishment fits the crime
