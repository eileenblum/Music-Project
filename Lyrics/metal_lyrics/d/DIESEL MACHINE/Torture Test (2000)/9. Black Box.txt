what was it that pushed you out
over the edge spiraling
unseen forces tearing at you
sudden death without a clue

on the surface things seem calm
beneath the skin something's wrong
pressure building in your head
distorting your thoughts

sifting through the wreckage for the black box
searching for something or someone
to take the blame

all the warning signs ignored
too late we can't save you now
something made you snap inside
broken down, a broken man

staring at the mirror's face
all you see is despair

self-loathing wide-eyed fear
make this all disappear....

sifting through the wreckage for the black box
searching for something or someone
to take the blame

but there's nothing left here.... NOTHING

shocking ending unexplained
how could we have not forseen
left to clean up what's left
scrape the contents of your head
