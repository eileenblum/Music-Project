who would guess
your destiny
would come to this
brought to your knees
looking back
it's hard to say
when it stopped being a game
communion now
keep the faith
good intent but you can't betray
the ritual is beckoning
you must obey or start suffering
increasing dose to satisfy
but the need intensifies
demanding
you must respond
the threshold pushed beyond

toe tag
body bag
end of the line
destroying yourself
is this the way you wanted to die?

sucking your will to live
draining you
no more to give
pumping through sunken veins
devour until none remains
insatiable
relentless need
perpetually time to feed
toe tag
body bag
end of the line
destroying yourself
is this the way you wanted to die?

consumption destroying your life as you know it
enslaving - become the whore
sell yourself to get some more
body aches
pounding head
the flesh weak
the will is dead

toe tag
body bag
end of the line
destroying yourself
is this the way you wanted to die?
