you thought you were in the clear
and you almost got away
but there's one more surprise
there's one more card to play
now the waiting is over
your luck is changing fast
I'll get my revenge
it's time to face your past

it's a state of panic that I put you in

STATE OF PANIC

I can't wait to be there
to see the look in your eyes
when the moment finally comes
and you realize
I fucked you good and you know it
and you're going down
I'll be there to watch it all
who's laughing now?

it's a state of panic that I put you in

STATE OF PANIC

sweating, breathing fast
clutch your palpitating heart
your face has turned to white
as the shock tears you apart
paralyzed with fear
I don't have to put you out
of your misery
you'll kill yourself, no doubt

STATE OF PANIC
