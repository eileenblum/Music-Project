watching, waiting, I've picked you out
compelled by my demons within I want you there's no doubt
PREDATOR gaining ground
at your heels
hunt you down

things I'll do to you are beyond sick
inches behind you feel me breathing right down your neck
I hope you like the taste of blood
it will be your own
I own you now

bound and gagged is how I like them
your nightmare comes to live
stripped of more than dignity
beg for death eventually

VICTIMIZED
laughing as you crawl
eat you alive
bones and all
