you can't change people with your fist
for you I'll make an exception
you will be the example
forever change your perception
it seems you've made this a habit
and now it's time for me to break
I've got what you've been asking for
and now it's time for you to take

you will run and I will find
now you live on borrowed time....

to make amends and be forgiven
means more than you'll ever know
your words have come back to haunt you
tolerance fades as anger grows
just remember when you're scared
and you've got nowhere left to go
mercy is something unknown
to one who smiles when breaking bones - YOUR BONES

you will run and I will find
now you live on borrowed time....

lies + anger + hate = pain

you will run and I will find
now you live on borrowed time....
