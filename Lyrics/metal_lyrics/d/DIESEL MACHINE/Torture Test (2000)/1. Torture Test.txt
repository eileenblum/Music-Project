Put in so much I can't turn back
I've got to live to see it through
all the years spent I can't stop now
it's waiting here just out of reach

my time will come if I can wait
when everything falls in to place
try to keep a grip on sanity
don't let the wear show on your face

TORTURE TEST

that wich does not kill me only makes me stronger,
but I've got to survive this torture test
what does it take to make a difference?
to seperate me from the rest
keep on pushing to make progress
knowing I can never rest

TORTURE TEST

that wich does not kill me only makes me stronger,
but I've got to survive this torture test

TORTURE TEST

I won't cave in live the rest
I'll survive the torture test
