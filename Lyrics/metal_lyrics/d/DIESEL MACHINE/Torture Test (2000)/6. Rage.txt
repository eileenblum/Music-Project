you are the reason I exist
won't stop until I get revenge
I will ensure you don't persist
cannot forgive, cannot forget

RAGE!

mother fucker, think you're bad?
I'll take that smile right off your face
how many more have you deceived
the damage done can't be erased

RAGE!

you thought you'd seen the last of me
when the backstabbing was done
I bet you think you're funny now
lying face down in your own blood

RAGE!
