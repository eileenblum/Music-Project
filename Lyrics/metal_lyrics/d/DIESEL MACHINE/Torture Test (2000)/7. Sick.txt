hypocracy
your fascination proves beyond a doubt
what you need and what you can't live without
powerless against your morbid curiosity
you're just as sick as those you're watching on TV
enamor those who perpetrate
the media will escalate
sleep well.... pretend it's not just right outside
dependency on the suffering that otehrs have
society makes your life seem not so bad
mesmerized by the civilized world's decline
desensitzed by what it cannot hide
thank you for your patronage
packaged sterile sacrilege
wash your hands &amp; lock the doors tonight
YOU'RE THE SICK ONE
