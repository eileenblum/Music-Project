when I think of you
I want to make you bleed
how I feel
your life means nothing to me
when you are alone
that's when death will come
waiting there in fear
no way you can stop me now

DRIVEN - I'M DRIVEN BY PAIN

I cannot control the inner strength of mine
surrounded by people
they never know they're going to die
when I get this way
there's a deep rage inside
when I explode
don't be in the way

welcome to this pain
I'll remain
welcome to this....

I'M DRIVEN BY PAIN

hate breeds more hate
I can't stop it
now it's pushing to the surface
I suggest you run somewhere far from me
I am not responsible for what you're about to see

welcome to this pain
I will still remain
welcome to this....

I'M DRIVEN BY PAIN
