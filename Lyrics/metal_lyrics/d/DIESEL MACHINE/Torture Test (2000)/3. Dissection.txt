you have become the focus of my hate
blood is what you own me
revenge is what I crave
crushed you kneel before me
exposed for what you are
I see right through you now
and everyone will know
your life must end
as good as dead

you think you've got a chance your lying to yourself
witness the power
I'm here to dissect you

blind to reality
ignorance will lead to pain
your friends left you behind
abandoned to your fate

you ask for one more day
tomorrow comes and goes
tomorrow never ends
for you there's no tomorrow

you think you've got a chance
you're lying to yourself
witness the power
I'm here to dissect you
