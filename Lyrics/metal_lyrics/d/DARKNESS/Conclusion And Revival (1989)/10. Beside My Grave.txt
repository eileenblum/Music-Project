Since you're gone I sit here in my room and vegetate
All my joys and fortunes torn away
I stare at your picture, recognize it's all too late
I'm suffering in solitude, there's nothing left to say 

After all I strike the balance
That my love's just been your tool
To make me your bloody servant
Sex-machine and enslaved fool 

You won't hurt me twice, my sweetheart
See what I will do
I'll wake up your conscience, baby
I will be your worst nightmare, haunt deep in your mind
I won't let you sleep, will be with you day and night 

Until you're crying for me 

I lie in my room in a gigantic pool of gore
I have made an end with all the lies
My brain glues to the wall, you should have better
You stand at the cemetary and you realize known before 

Left of me is just a torso
And the fragments of my head
Go right ahead, repent your misdeed
You're the only cause I'm dead
You won't hurt me twice...
Beside my grave you will cry
