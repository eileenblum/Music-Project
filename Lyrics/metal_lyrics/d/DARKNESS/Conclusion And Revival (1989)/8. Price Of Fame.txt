A band plays in a basement
In hope for great success
Prepared to attempt anything
They always do their best 

They fall for two publishers
Who say "you can be sold!"
Put faith in every promise
And believe what they are told 

Two fashionable men of thirty
Cheat them out of their money
Fake the settlements
Their intrigues and the deals are dirty
They surely know the lawfulness
Is in their hands 

The two have got the money
The band has the ideas
A false step is impossible
No need for any fears 

The two have got the connexions
The band has got a pen
The two have got a contract
Just a signature and then 

Truth's onverted to a lie
Profit's turned into a loss
Sells the soul and sells the name
That's the price of fame 

So listen to my counsel
Be careful where you step
Don't be in good faith or you
Will trample in their traps 

They're going to deceive you
They say "we want you best!"
They promise you success
And fame and profit, but at last
