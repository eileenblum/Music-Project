Above the big building the cross shines red
"It's the best for you" is all his relations said
The years of his life follow hit after hit
Time thanks him with an apoplectic fit 

Nobody looks inside him
The scars of his soul
All that they think is
"Patient under control" 

Able to move only with a wheel-chair
A wreck, half of his body is not to repair
Night after night he stays motionless in bed
But he can't sleep, 'cause his thoughts are so sad 

He is old, what can he do?
He is cold, nothing to do!
Wish his dreams would never go
His dreams mean how can he go 

Nurse walks on the corridor with rubber gloves on
The room next door's expty-now another one's gone
Sitting in the bath tub, unable to wash himself
Needs the help to clean his body from a 24-moth slave 

Week for week, month for month, where is the time?
Year for year, the state of health for dying is too fine
He rolls his chair to balcony, opens the french windows
One moment he stands on one leg, irrevocable he goes 

He was old, what could he do?
He was cold, nothing to do
Wished his dreams would never go
Broken dreams â why did he go?
