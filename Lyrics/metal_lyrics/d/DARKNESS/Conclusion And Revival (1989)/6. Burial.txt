Eighty-seven as the story began
Some musicians folled their leader's command
Their mistake was that they signed a contract
Their debts grew as the record was out 

They believed that everything would work so well
No objection frightened them
Their ears were deaf, their eyes were blind
Ain't no caution changed their mind 

Burial at C. 

So their members and time passes by
Many faces, different guys
Just a few gigs from time to time
No big deal, but a programmed decline 

They split up and the band started anew
Left the weak ones on their way
Left their images behind
To start again on another kind 

Burial at C.
