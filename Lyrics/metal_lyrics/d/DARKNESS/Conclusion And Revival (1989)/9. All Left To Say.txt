I woke up this morning
Trumpets blowing in my head
Half the night I've been drinking
How I wish I was dead 

Uh, babe, since you've left I feel terrible pain
It's awfully hard, but here I go again 

I've cried all the tears that I could cry
All the pain was in vain, but at least now I'm through
You wouldn't have cared if I had died
All my tears, nervous breakdowns 've meant nothing to you
But you've preferred to push and to hurt
You've lied and denied
You have killed my feelings for you 

Now the crying is over
And you're happy and free
Good luck with your next lover
Think you'll need it more than me 

You, I would have done anything for you
But now it's too late, you've lied and destroyed
Now I go again to find someone better than you
