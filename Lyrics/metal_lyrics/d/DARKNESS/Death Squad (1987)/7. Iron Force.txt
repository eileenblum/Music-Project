Dead angels knocked down by strong fists
God for them nomore exists
They have no hearts just rocks
Start to live at twelve o''clock 

Iron forces - armies for the fight
Iron forces - creatures of the night
Iron forces - legions made of steel
Iron forces - ready for the kill 

Their brains are filled with the evil light
They are the force of Satan - a might
Coming out of muddy dust
Killing is their only lust 

Rabies bites, hellish fights
Evil curse, iron force
Rabies bites, hellish fights
Evil curse, iron force
