1940 as this story began
30 sailors followed their leader's command
The fear grows as they dove to battle
The pressure rises the deeper they go 

Red alert now the choose has begun
Dangerous, the nearer they come
Firing back the cruisers attack
All torpedos run their job has been done 

Burial at sea

Unseen they dove back to base again
But they won't stop their terror game
Next battle ship in sight tonight
There is no reason to fight the strike 

Heavy artillery hit them damn hard
Many sailors lives fell apart
New as they sink deep into the sea
All have lost the touch of reality 

Burial at sea
