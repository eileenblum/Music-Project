You reign over our lives
Decide between wealth and poverty
Spend our rates to sell your lies
Designate our fate and history

They tell us about peace and economic boom
Tell us their lies, capture our vote
I tell you to order your bombs
'Cause I know you'll leave us soon

you tried to to direct my live in a path
created my programmed destiny
now you are under my wrath
I'm your "Feind", your enemy

They tell us about peace and economic boom
Tell us their lies, capture our vote
I tell you to order your bombs
'Cause I know you'll leave us soon

[Ref.]
Staatsfeind [4x]

You are deceivers of the worst kind
Fashistic rulers greedey for might
Disguise your tyranny under the coat of -
Democracy

You're the demagogues I ain't blind
I know the Truth, fight for my right
Arise with Liberty for the only true -
Demoracy
