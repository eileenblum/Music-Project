1999, Nostradamus did foresee
the World's decline, mankind's Destiny
The Fear of War, everyone holds Breath
Jungle Law, before the atomic Bomb

Missiles are ready, programmed to kill
Armies stand steady to fire at will
Nagasaki, Hiroshima. why didn't they learn
All these dark Deceivers, no Time to turn

[Ref.:]
Critical Threshold
Destroy a million lives, atomic Thunderbolt
To push the Button, individual fatal Fault
Critical Threshold

The man with the Key, high Responsibility
See the Victims plea, you cannot agree
Moral Conflict, hurting your Brain
Don't shoot to kill, no one will remain

With nuclear War, we dig our Grave
We opened Death' Door, don't think you're safe
You have to realize you won't survive
We all pay the prize and loose our fucking lives

[Ref.]
