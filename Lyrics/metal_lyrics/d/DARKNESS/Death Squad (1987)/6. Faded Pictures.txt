Why have I been born
I don't hide my Sorrow
And fight back this horror
You think you reign my brain

[Pre-Chorus:]
I, I will defy
Your boundaries to exist
All my broken dreams, broken dreams

[Ref.]
Death is my reality
I don't need your Society
My life is insanity
Can't you see my faded
Faded Pictures

Your justice a poker play
You think your new laws
Will blast my hatred
Then you're in my claws

[Pre-Chorus:]
I, I will defy
Your boundaries to exist
All my broken dreams, broken dreams

[Ref.]
Death is my reality
I don't need your Society
My life is insanity
Can't you see my faded
Faded Pictures
