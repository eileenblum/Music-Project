Bombs of Death they hide in Bars
Assuring victims after blast
Innocent people torn away
Terrible dues they had to pay

[Ref.]
Death,Terror and Crime
They choose as their sign
Kidnap, maim and kill
Their Mission fulfilled

Death Squad [4x]

Abduct the Plane next in Line
Passengers captive for some time
If their demands won't be fulfilled
The first hostage would be killed

[Ref.]

Reasons rooted in History
Religion first priority
They don't care for humanity
Blind Massacre their Legacy [4x]
