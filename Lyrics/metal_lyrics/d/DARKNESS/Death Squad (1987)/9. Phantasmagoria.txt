It lurks deep within
You can't touch, feel or taste
You know it will come again
Surrounding your thoughts
Feeling this slight
Creeping into your brain
Now that you see the flame
You're perceiving this lethal game 

The figure changes as you wipe your eyes
Colors rule and bewitch your sense
The fire grows higher as you try to flee
Don't run no need of defense 

Your hearing is captive by the siren's call
That won't ever set you free again
Your resistance turns into passion
Now as the fear disappears
The Facination of these images
Opresses the feel for what's real
The falsification of your will
Closes in to the point of no return 

The power of the unknown breaks free
The force that noone can ever understand
The dimensions overlap as you see
The way of life lost importance for you
Bursting through the boundaries of mankind
The odyssey of your mind has begun
Welcome to the journey through space and time
Welcome to the paranoia of phantasmagoria
