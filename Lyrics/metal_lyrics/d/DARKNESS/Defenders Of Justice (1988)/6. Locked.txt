Sometimes justice goes criminal ways
Open your eyes and you`ll see it nowadays
Take an axe and kill your parents plus brother
You`ll get 10 years jail like any other
But if you believe you`re Napoleon for sure
You`ll get 100 years and an unhuman cure
Locked in a cell with your hands on your back

Locked away â forever hidden from the sun
Locked away â for something you haven`t done
Locked away â he`s just in your head
Locked away â but Napoleon`s dead

It seems like they really take you for him
And they last his crimes on your skin
They use you for medical adventures
They don`t care for unhuman measures
Your friends don`t deal with an insane
And your parents think all the same
Noone will ever see you there
Â´cause you`ve trapped into nowhere

The years pass by but you don`t care
All over the years Napoleon`s still there
He`s your only friend within this hell
He won`t ever leave you where you dwell
Other personalities come and die
Noone will ever ask the reason why
Noone will ever see this cure`s a misuse
Multiple personalities aren`t dangerous
