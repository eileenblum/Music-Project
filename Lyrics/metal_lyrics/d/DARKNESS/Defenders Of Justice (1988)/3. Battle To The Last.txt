Atomic bombs are falling from the sky
The nuclear death has never been a lie
The survivors share a post atomic fate
No feelings left but the promises of hate

See the evolution of a brand new race
Aggression and violence the commanding pace
They leave no way out for you
Dead and street who`s life is through

Your choice â beat or be beaten
Your choice â eat or be eaten

Eye for an eye
Duel of the best
Every single man
Battle to the last

Nature died as the radiation came
Noone asked who`s the one to blame
Politicians live within atomic shelters
Awaiting the moment of total control

Burned earth the legacy of war
Burned lives tell us what for
Poisoned is the future for our kind
No hope death will leave us behind â behind

Your choice â beat or be beaten
Your choice â eat or be eaten

Eye for an eye
Duel of the best
Every single man
Battle to the last

The burning holocaust was the final prey
Ashes and dust turned the world to grey
The final solution buried at last
There`s no looking back, time turned to past

Two thousand years of fear are gone
Only one second and the end was done
Solving the problem of mankind`s request
The invisible disease will capture the rest
