Young vital men in green uniform
Controlling the life in the streets
Coming to save us but always too late
Brainless slaves of the state

Stealing our dope and smoke it themselves
Oppression of each of our thoughts
We pay our rate we keep them alive
They thank us with truncheon`s and gas

Defenders of justice
Saviours of right
Fighting for freedom
Maintain their pride â fight it

They miss if you need them, even you call
They`re always there where they`re save
Arrest of innocents, the culprits escape
They slight our rights and our will

More and more their clothes are changing
Changing from green into brown
It just needs some time, you won`t perceive it
And the runes are ruling again

They`ve got their weapons, their licence to kill
Their warrants of arrest to take us our freedom
And take us our will
They`ve got the law, but we`ve got the might
They`ve got their justice, the judge`s on their side
But we`ve got the right
They vent their anger, frustrations and fears
On each opposition that publishes their thinkings
And fearless appears
They torture and thrash, they murder and lie
With the pretext of duty, but one glorious day
We will reign, and they will die

Young vital men in green uniform
Controlling the life in the streets
Coming to save us but always too late
Brainless slaves of the state

More and more their clothes are changing
Changing from green into brown
It just needs some time, you won`t perceive it
And the runes are ruling again

Defenders of justice
Saviours of right
Fighting for freedom
Maintain their pride â fight it

Fight it!
