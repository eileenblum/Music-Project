40 years are gone and we`ve learned a lot
We`ve learned to save the things we got
Everybody`s equal we love democracy
Step into our paradise so you will agree

Nothing`s wrong for the stupid publicity
The truth is what they don`t see
They close their eyes and walk their way
And the world around starts to decay

Cash keeps the world spinnin` round
The greed for money is what we found
We deal with weapons and amunition
It`s not our war not our superstition

They need a war
- Â´cause war`s a great deal
- There`s no shame we feel
- No matter in which place
- Money`s no disgrace
