I stand above the circus
The sceptre in my hand
Gladiators waiting steady
Awaiting my command
The crowd roars in ecstasy
Requires for the fight
They scream in endless bloodlust
Their bloodlust`s my delight
I`m ruling the republic
Emperor of this realm
My arbitrary`s justice
It`s done on what I dwell
My toys are the citizens
I steer their destiny
And I oppress the senate
Rome`s my lavatory

Caligula
Hail Hail
Hail Hail
Hail Hail
Hail Hail
Caligula

I rape the vestal virgins
Their discharge taste`s of wine
My riot is so cruelty
My riot is divine
I love all men, all women
Satisfy my variety
With wine and blood and children
And senseless gluttony
I am the roman tyrant
I`m chosen from the gods
The mankind will prescribe me
But I won`t be forgotten
Who knows me says I`m insane
An unabashed lie
To know me is to love me
To love me is to die
