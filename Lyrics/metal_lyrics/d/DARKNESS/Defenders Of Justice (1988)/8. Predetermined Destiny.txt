When you get up in the morning
You are tired, you feel sad
Have a coffee, eat a sandwich
Your wife is sleeping in the bed
You go to work into the factory
To work eight hours everyday
Stupid servitude for lifetime
You can`t escape, there ain`t no way

Trapped in dogmas eternally
Predetermined destiny

Knowing your way of life is lunatic
Work until you collapse, day in, day out
To feed and to dress your wife and your children
After all, at the end of your slavery you`re proud

At the end of your slavery your power`s exhausted
They send you in pension, you`re useless and old
They give you a gold watch and they kick into your ass
The rest of your life`s left to die with your ills

You feel weak, your body`s slack and wrinkle`s round your eye
Your teeth are gone, your tapeworm aches, you slowly realize
You`re useless and old, what have you attained
What has ever happened, why have you been living
You walk through the park and you rest under trees
You swing your grandson, who`s sitting on your knees
Each tuesday the doctor find`s several new ills
Each wednesday you search for a place to rest in peace

Until you`re born society teaches you
To wear your hair short, to be dressed clean
To learn to read, to write, to reckon
To bend your neck, to work, to obey
You`ve got the right to choose your government
You choose between warm shit or cold
The ludicrous parties try to delude you
Tyranny until you`re old

Trapped in dogmas eternally
Predetermined destiny

Knowing your way of life is lunatic
Work until you collapse, day in, day out
To feed and to dress your wife and your children
After all, at the end of your slavery you`re proud

At the end of your slavery your power`s exhausted
They send you in pension, you`re useless and old
They give you a gold watch and they kick into your ass
The rest of your life`s left to die with your ills
