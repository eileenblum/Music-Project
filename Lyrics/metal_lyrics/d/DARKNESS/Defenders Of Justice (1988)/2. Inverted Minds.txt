The leaders order and you obey
Prescribe the words of your prey
The naked truth is no longer true
Times have changed and so will you

Feel the preasure`s rising â uncontrolled
Hear our words promising â uncontrolled
Watch our power arising â uncontrolled
Now see your fate decliding â uncontrolled

Fell the preasure rising â uncontrolled
Watch our power rising â uncontrolled

Bloodless we increase our rate
Technical decrease of hate
Torpid life left back for you
A new identity who is who

Feel the preasure`s rising â uncontrolled
Hear our words promising â uncontrolled
Watch our power arising â uncontrolled
Now see your fate decliding â uncontrolled

Fell the preasure rising â uncontrolled
Watch our power rising â uncontrolled

Thought control â never think twice
Distarted lines â betray your eyes
Sudden results â Inverted minds
Inverted minds

Your new modules have passed the test
Your new identity will do its best
The best for us is just good for you
Now start your misshapened life anew
