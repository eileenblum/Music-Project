The bringer of death has taken his life
The easiest way out he has chosen to die
His arian dream collapsed in the end
His Third Reich has failed as the hour zero began

Victory â The end of war the winners took all
Destiny â The relic of truth the jewish nation`s fall

Imprisoned â For the rest of their lives
Banished â To live in concentration camps
Tortured â To the last
Systematic â Mass destruction

The liberation brought freedom at hand
Discovered the truth noone expected to see
The jewish nation has been destroyed
Thousands lay buried in common graves

Victory â The end of war the winners took all
Destiny â The relic of truth the jewish nation`s fall

Bloodbath	- 6 Million dead
Noone ever felt ashame in his head
Bloodbath	- 6 million decayed
No cross set up where they laid

We should never forget the deeds that were done
We should always remember the pain they felt
We all must resist to end up like these
Who didn`t rose to fight against a deadly lie

Victory â The end of war the winners took all
Destiny â The relic of truth the jewish nation`s fall

Bloodbath	- 6 Million dead
Noone ever felt ashame in his head
Bloodbath	- 6 million decayed
No cross set up where they laid
