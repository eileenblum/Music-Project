Dark

Listen and you'll hear those screams
Evoking, gods from beyond
Cthulu, the Great Old One
Rise
Rule the world once again

Kader Nostra Kader Estra
Unholy words from the book called
Necronomicon
Written by the madman Abdul
Alhazred
Blasphemous howlings filled by
mortifying pain
Rising the Great Old Ones
Rule our world

Crawling up from the darkest depths
Chaos gods from times long before
Crawling Chaos

Dark
