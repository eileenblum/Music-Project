I saw it rising from the sea
My fear is growing endlessly
The evil struck me like a fist
When R'lyeh arosed from the mist

I'm afraid I have lost my mind
No I can't go on with these things
Inside my head
Inside my head

Leave me alone
I got nothing to do with this
Phnglui mglwnath cthulu
R'lyeh wghnagl fhtagh

I can see what no other see
I can feel myself burn within this hell
I am one of the gifted ones
I can see beyond
I can see beyond the human sphere
I know what's there

Leave me alone
I got nothing to do with this
Phnglui mglwnath Cthulu
R'lyeh wgahnag fhtagh

That is not dead which can eternal lie
yet with strange aeons even death may die
