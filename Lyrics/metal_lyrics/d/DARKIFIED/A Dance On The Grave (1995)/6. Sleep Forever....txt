The clock strikes out the witching hour
And here you sit in loneliness
Are these sounds you hear from the walls
Or from the forest? You can't tell
Yeah
Howlings from the darkness
Yeah
From the rest of the world departed

Your shadow seems to make it's own moves
When you're walking over the floor
You open up the door to the attic
The sight you see is too mad to be
And it rips your mind to shreds
A moving mass of grinning light
Which is floating down the steps

Prepare for a night of 1000 horrors
Logic and sanity will bleed
You will pray for death
But beyond it's depths
There's just more suffering to meet

You try to hide from this nocturnal madness
Down into the cellar you go
A compact darkness that swallows you up
Do you really think you're safe? Down here?
No!

Falling out into the darkness

Falling...
Falling forever into the...
sempiternal silence...

Lonesome forever
Falling toward
The endless abyss
Of lachrymose grief

You tears between dimensions
You scream as you burn
The emptiness embraces your soul
So close your eyes to
Sleep forever...
