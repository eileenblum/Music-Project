I invoke you
Creatures from beyond
Your time is now
Reach the horizon

Ai Nezgaroth et Chtulu Yog Sothoth
Ai Nezgaroth et Nyarlathothep

I'm loosing my grip of reality
Feel myself casted out into the void
Where no laws rules
Chaos, Death and Pain are my guides
I shall be Him
The One who shall recall all what is dismissed

I can feel your power and your strength
Pulsing, reaching every spot of my limbs
I can nearly stand the pain
But you shall rule once again
