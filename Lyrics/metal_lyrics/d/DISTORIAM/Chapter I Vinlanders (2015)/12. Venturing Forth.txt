We are venturing fourth far into the unknown

Hills extend before us all across this land
Don't make it such a fuss, it is not what we planned
We don't care, we are lost, but we're not ready to unpack
The sun is setting behind us but we are not looking back

What shall we find on this side of the earth?
How did we get to the end of this sea?
When will we find our homes and our wives?
Where are the places that will welcome us?

Now we gather around with fire and with song
We're ready for one more round, it has been too long
Drink your horns filled with mead, for
It's the end of your days
We are Distoriam, Thor
Don't leave us from your gaze!
