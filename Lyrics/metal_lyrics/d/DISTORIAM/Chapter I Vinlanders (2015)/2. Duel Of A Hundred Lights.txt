Across the grazing field two armies gather around
Waiting for the battle to begin, looking at each other
Trying to gauge their strengths they found their numbers are even
The generals rode their horses to the center of the plain
They chose a duel was to decide their fate
Each side then rallied his most glorious warrior to fight for their own Jarl

Swords and axes swing the air, shields and armours block just fair
Blood and sparks in many sights in the Duel of Hundred Lights
We cannot already tell who's going to win this fight
One army will go to Hel at the end of this bloody night

The battle still continued no hits were ever made
Exhaustion was bringing this to an end
Shields were blasted in shards
Swords were slippery from sweat
Chainmail slowed down their pace
The two armies watched nervously
As swings were getting lame no winner was still in sight
But in a desperate swing guided by Tyr himself
They stabbed each other to death
Bravely, they battled

The warriors fell both dead
The night became silent for a brief moment
Each Jarl rallied his troops
So they can break this tie forsaken by Tyr
