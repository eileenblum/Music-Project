They won't take the name of a king
They fight for many tales to sing
With the power of their steel and steeds
They will ride to the endless fields

One thousand years ago not so far from here
The son of a king deserted
He rode to many places and to many marches
Finding men inspired by his quest

But on his journey he made enemies
Rules of this land were afraid
Their dream of a freedom was too great for them
To be left alive in this world

They won't take the name of a king
They fight for many tales to sing
With the power of their steel and steeds
They will ride to the endless fields

Strike against the ground
Charge towards the storm

He rode with his blood brothers
With their swords pointed to the sky
As Freyr watched upon him
Blessing his men with power and might
They didn't need more
But one day the king attacked our friend
He fought bravely guiding his own to victory

They won't take the name of a king
They fight for many tales to sing
With the power of their steel and steeds
They will ride to the endless fields

Strike against the ground
Charge towards the storm
