The enemy ambushed the land
They've taken all the gold we had
But never will they take our pride
And the faith we have to our gods

The blood of the elders
Is pouring in the rain of pain
Our wives and our children
Defend themselves in vain

Something has to be done
We can't let this go on

Us, Vinlanders will sacrifice our lives
To defend the legacy of this land
We will crush every enemy we'll see
With the power and the glory that'll lead us to victory

We fought for days and days
And never saw the end
Many men have given their life
To the good of the ancestors land

Now that the battle's coming to an end
After several weeks of assault
We're now claimed as the heroes
Who saved the honour of our land
