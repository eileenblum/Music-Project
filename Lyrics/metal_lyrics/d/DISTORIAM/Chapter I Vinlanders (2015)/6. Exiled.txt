From the green fields of Ireland
Comes a banished scholar
Truth invaded his writing hand
He claimed the sun was a star
Condemned for heresy, condemned for liberty
No walls could shelter him, the light of hope was dim

Liberty he found with us

Thrace is another's home, a dark and stoic man
Raised in the culture of Rome
War and raids were his ban
He met with many races, he went to many places
To the Vinland he once went,
With his master's death he paid his rent

He will make his name with us

We are all exiled from our native lands
We don't think of going back there
We will conquer and live by our own hands
We claim the Vinland as our own lair
This land calls for our victory, prepare yourselves for discovery
Unknown lands are dangerous, conquering is far from gracious

The Vinland standard we shall raise
The Vanir and Ãsir we shall praise
The old continent is is just memories so make yourselves at ease!

In the heartland of Europe lived a honourable count
His rankings were amongst the top
His mighty castle up on a mount but pious he was not
Some wanted him to rot
Accused of heresy, he went away
In the North he wanted to stay

He will make his fief with us

Grim fjords and dark skies built a ferocious man
Christianity he denies, berserking he killed and ran
Burning every church he saw, raiding the next abbey
He had a taste for things raw
His ship sailing to the next bay
He will shed much blood with us
