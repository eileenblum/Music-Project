From luscious forests to rocky steppes,
From the green lands to the snow covered peaks
Us travelers have been everywhere
Looking for a place for the brave to call home

We have soon, so many things
You people wouldn't believe
Attack ships on fire by the Strait of Gibraltar
Flaming arrows glitter near the Constantinople Gates!

From the white dunes to the highest cliffs
From the fjords of the North to the eastern jungle,
Us travelers have been everywhen
Seeking for the time when our golden age will rise

We have seen the midnight's light reveal the scum of JÃ¶tunheim
Humans devoured by feral greed
As the Colosseum trembled with cheers
But now, the winds of time shove our sails to the new world
The land of the vines, of savage beasts
Flat horned behemoths, a place for the brave to call home

We ran upon a thousand roads
We glided on the waves of a hundred seas
By the fury of the darkest fate
We've been exiled in strange aeons
We sold our talents to highborns
To the merchant's guild or royal navy
By the blessing of the weirdest fate
We've been promised to a Frakking badass life

From Upsalla down to Thingvellir
By the laws of the North we have been found guilty
Us travellers have been thrown ashore
Now we're going to find the place to call home
Banishment is a convenient and amazing form of punishment
Now we have the chance to make a new kingdom our own
And sow the seeds of our legacy!
