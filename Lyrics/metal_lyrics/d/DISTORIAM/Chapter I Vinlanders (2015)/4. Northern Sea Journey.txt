Our longboat has sailed on the seven seas we sought many delights
We fought the mightiest knights
Our axes are ready to strike with ease, we conquer this new ground
We defend what we've found
Our oars are swift and the wind is strong
Now lands await at the end of this sea

The Northern Sea is not foreign to us
Its violent storms, its temper is known to the vikings since ever
The stars and the winds are our allies, don't misuse them at any cost
Or in the ice sea we'll be lost

Untie the ropes get on the ship and prepare the journey
(We all must)
Share our hopes what we find shall be all written in lai
(Forever)
This famous tale of us Vinlanders will be folklore
And our names will be known for the discoveries we will make

Our longboat is docked and we wait the need
We don't look at the east we rest and let us feast
Our cups are filled with this tasty mead
We thank Eric the Red for his land we've been led
Our journey is getting near the end
We leave Greenland for the Vinland as we cast off

Rolling hills and riches await us
Leif Erikson and his tale have always guided our sail
The skraelings will flee our heavy steel
Loki's created these goblins we shall kill these living sins
