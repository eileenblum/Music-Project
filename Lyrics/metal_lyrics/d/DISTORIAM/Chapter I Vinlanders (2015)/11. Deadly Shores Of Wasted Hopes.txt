They came from the western lands
With faith in an unique God that rules them all
They thought they could convert us
With swords and with empty words of gifting
We fought for our gods
We fought for our own pagan land
Perkons didn't strike them down
A sign that the battle we fight is in vain

Spearheads that pierce through metal
Axes that are always fatal
Arrows that are never amiss
The men will not survive this
Perkons with his rolling thunder
Dievas with his role as father
Saule with her rays of pure bill
The gods will not survive this
Now, forever, we all must defent the land

As the battle leaned for them
There was nowhere to leave but the shores
And then waiting for harsh judgement
We knew there was no hope left for this
They fought for their God
They fought smiting us vile pagans
Our ways will not survive time
Their ways will prevail for we are lost

Now, forever, we all must defend our sacred ways
