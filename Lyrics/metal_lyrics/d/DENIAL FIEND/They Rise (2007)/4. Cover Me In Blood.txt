Ungh!
Cover me in blood - paint me crimson red- just like the dead
Cover me in blood - drench me in gore -from your open sores
Cover me in blood - cover me in blood - cover me in blood - cover me
My blade cuts deep so succulent sweet
You'll bleed for me
The way that you writhe under the knife
You're such a tease

Ohhh!
The splatter pattern you left on the walls when I crushed your skull
The way your brains oozed &amp; dripped down upon the floor

Ungh!
Cover me in blood - paint me crimson red - just like the dead
Cover me in blood - drench me in gore - from your open sores
Cover me in blood - cover me in blood - cover me in blood - cover me
You'll bleed for me
The way that you writhe under the knife
You're such a tease
