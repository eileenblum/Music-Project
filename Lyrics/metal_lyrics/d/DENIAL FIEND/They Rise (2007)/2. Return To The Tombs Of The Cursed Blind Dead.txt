Don't move - don't breath - don't let 'em hear your heart beat! [2x]

Be warned all who enter here
This necropolis you should fear
Only a fool would come to this place
Unhallowed ruins of an ancient disgrace
Haunted by unholy undead beast
They hunger for your blood - they will feast!

Don't move - don't breath - don't let 'em hear your heart beat! [2x]

Return to the tombs of the cursed blind dead! [4x]

Damned by black magic rites
Zombified evil pagan knights
Summoned by the toll of the bell
Condemned with immortal death hell

They come right out of the ground!
With no eyes to see they hunt by sound!

Return to the tombs of the cursed blind dead! [2x]

Cursed blind dead [3x]
