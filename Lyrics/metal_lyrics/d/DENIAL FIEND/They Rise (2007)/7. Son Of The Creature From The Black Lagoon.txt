Hey - hey - hey! - hey - hey - hey!
Hey - hey - hey! - hey - hey - hey! - ugh!

On a sanguine moonlit night
Deep down south in the swamplands
A blood curdling scream can be heard
Borne out of the muck &amp; quicksand...

It'll chill you to the bone
It'll make you quiver in fear
Something from a prehistoric past
Rising from the murky water...it nears

Go! - go!
Go! - go!
Go! - it's got gills like a fish
Go! - but walks like a man
Go! - it's hungry for some fresh flesh
Go! - tonight

Go! - it likes the young girls
Go! - that swim in his canals
Go! - the sweet scent of their skin
Go! - he likes!

Beware! ohh - beware!
Take care
It's the son of the creature from
The black lagoon!
Beware! - ohh beware!
Take care!
He'll come take your woman away!
Beware! - ohh beware!
Take care
It's the son of the creature from
The black lagoon!
Beware! beware!
Stay out! keep clear of his swampy domain!

Hey - hey - hey! - hey - hey - hey!
Hey - hey - hey! - hey - hey - hey!

On the shores of his black lagoon
Deep down in his dark hidden cave
Bodies of female victims lie
And yet none can never be saved...

Clawing monster from a lost age!
Humanoid from the deep!
