They rise - (go-go!) the dead walk the earth
They rise - (go-go!) hungry for your flesh
They rise - (go-go!) zombified undead horde
They rise - (go-go!) to make you one of them!

Beware -the end is NEAR
When the dead walk - it all comes clear
The gates of hell ripped wide open
The damned set loose -
The APOCALYPSE - is HERE!

They rise - (go-go!) the dead walk the earth
They rise - (go-go!) hungry for your flesh
They rise - (go-go!) the zombified undead horde
They rise - (go-go!) now come &amp; join with them!

Cursed - the plague has come
A billion corpses walk among us
The era of humanity is done
The age of necromaniacs - has begun!

They rise!
They rise!
They rise!
They rise!
