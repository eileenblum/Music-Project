Go! go-go-go! [2x]
He survived being buried alive
Now an undead corpse
His grave disturbed he'll rise!

Flesheater! revenge of the living dead! -
Flesheater! this infection he will spread! -

Go! go0go-go! [2x]
From just one bite this plague shall begin
A fiendish destructive path his onslaught of sin!

Flesheater! revenge of the living dead! -
Flesheater! this infection he will spread! -

Such a terrifying sight
A ghoulish gory fright
It all began with a bite
On a dark Halloween night

Flesheater! -
Go! go-go-go! [2x]
Flesheater! revenge of the living dead! -
Flesheater! this infection he will spread! -
Go! go-go-go! [2x]

...this evil which will take
Flesh &amp; blood from thee
And turn all ye unto evil...
