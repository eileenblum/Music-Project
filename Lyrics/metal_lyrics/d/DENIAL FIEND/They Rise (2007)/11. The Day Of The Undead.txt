You wake up dead in a world gone mad
Mankind's gripped with fear
A meteor storm from outer space
Has brought the pestilent plague
What has become of this planet earth
This place is like a unliving hell

They begin to move - and start to rise
Return of the living dead!
Is this an invasion? or is this something else?
What are these ghastly hideous things?
Are they dead or are they alive?
Or are they something all together worse?

Go! - are they creatures from another world
Go! - come to invade us &amp; take control
Go! - could they be some kind of evil things
Go! - sent by the devil to steal our souls

It's the day of the undead! It's the end of everything!
It's the day of the undead! Beware the curse that they bring!

Go! - are they aliens from the planet Mars
Go! - or from a galaxy far away
Go! - could they be some kind of biological mishap
Go! - a government experiment gone astray

It's the day of the undead! It's the end of everything!
It's the day of the undead! Beware the curse that they bring!

BRAINS!!
