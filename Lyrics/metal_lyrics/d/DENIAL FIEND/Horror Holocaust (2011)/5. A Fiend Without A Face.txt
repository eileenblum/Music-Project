Atomic age nightmare
An abomination is born
Experiment gone wrong
A creature takes form

A creeping twisted mass
Crawling and unseen
Lurking in the shadows
No one hears you scream

Beware of the fiend

What's that hideous sound
Don't open the door
Something is out there
Why am I on the floor

Paralyzed with fear
Oh god the pain
What the hell is happening
My skull is being drained

Beware of the fiend
A fiend without a face

What is this monster
A monster I cannot see
My life is fading 
I'm slipping away

It's feeding, feeding on your mind

My life is fading
I'm slipping away

Atomic age nightmare
Don't open the door
