Cold
On a cold dark road
A place called dunsmoor where nobody goes
Scared
Yeah, you should be scared
What you learned in school could never prepare 
Sane
Something you won't find
Chaos and violence of an unfit mind
Back
Don't turn your back
I did it just once, nearly cut me in half
First meet Bonnie
Sullen and sad
Her love for a villain
Ended up bad
They chopped up his wife
Left her to freeze
The pieces came back
They couldn't believe

Here is Bruno
A life of regret
A tailoring shop and a week to make rent
A stranger arrives with a strange request
Unholy intention of raising the dead
Frozen fear
Pretty young girl
Paranoid
They all tried to help
But she never enjoyed
Friend in her head
Lucy's her name
Killed her whole family but they're one in the same
Lucy's come home

Death 
There's no escape 
You answered the call
Now you're here to stay
Asylum
Now you see
But it's late
You cannot breath
You've met your fate
