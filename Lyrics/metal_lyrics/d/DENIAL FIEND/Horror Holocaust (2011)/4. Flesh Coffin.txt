Living, for to long in this flesh coffin
I'm coming out, I will be born
Ripping and clawing, you will be torn
I need to breathe

I am alive
I'm buried inside
Hear my cries

Absorbing your mind and thoughts
I will consume you 

My heart is dead black
My soul is full of hate
Hell was full so they sent me back
I will choose your fate

I am born
From this flesh coffin
