Now you're all alone
Creeping in a horror zone
Close your eyes real tight
Screaming in your soul
This haunted world takes a deadly toll
You're dreaming in black
Terror alive
Alive in the night
Try to survive
This evil delight
Dark of the moon
Disfigures the sky
Run for your life
Try to survive
Horrified
Holocaust
Horror everywhere
Menagerie of inhuman stares
Running endlessly
Ragged claws and wings
Every manner of the devil's things
They turn on their own
Twisted and sleek
No two are alike
United by violence
They kill and attack
Under the ground
And up in the sky
Creatures of torment
In endless supply
Too late
The sun has come
Too late
The night is done
Too late
The earth belongs to them
