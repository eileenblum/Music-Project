Born into a world of chaos
Bred for violence
Born into a world of chaos
Bred of fear
Born into a world of chaos
All humanity erased
Death comes quickly
In her dark domain

Bleed him out carve him up later
Blood spurts
Bleed him out carve him up later

Blood sprays
Bleed him out carve him up later
Blood bursts
Bleed him out carve him up later
Blood splatters

Body riddled with stab wounds
Warm blood on grey concrete
Body riddled with stab wounds
Final twitch of the death nerve
Body riddled with stab wounds
Taste the life that flows so freely
