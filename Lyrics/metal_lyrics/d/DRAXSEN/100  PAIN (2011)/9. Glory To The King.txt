The battle weary bring the wounded home
The soles of the dead face the Holy one
As the King smiles unto the Rose
Justified in what he knows

[Chorus]
Sing glory to the King, for his holy win,
Over terrortory [x2]

We bury the dead and turn the horses for home
After laying a wreath against the last tombstone.
A final word for the passing by the Holy priest
We head for home for a celebratory feast

[Chorus]
