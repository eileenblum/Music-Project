God can see you! And the trouble hidden in your eyes.
And if thereâs a problem, whoâs gonna help you work it out?

From the heavens above an ancient spirit came to me
A strange sensation, I feel it taking hold of my life.

Seek my council, and youâll  answer to the riddle of life
The blood is flowing, the blood that wipes all the slates clean
