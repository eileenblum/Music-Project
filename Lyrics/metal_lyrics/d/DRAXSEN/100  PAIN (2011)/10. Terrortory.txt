As the wreath lays all alone
All alone before a fallen stone.
As the wind plays within the leaves
Of the all seeing trees.
And the shadows seem to stand their ground
As I slowly look all around
Will I live to tell the story, who tells the Terrortory
Will I live to tell the story, who tells the Terrortory

As a scream breaks the dead of the night
I wake with an awful fright.
And Iâm wet with a cold cold sweat
One I never will forgetâ
As I lay back an settle down
With my eyes darting all around
Think back over the history of the Terrortory
Think back over the history of the Terrortory

Laughs were heard as the nails pierced his hands
There was no one on earth that couldâve altered gods plans
As they rolled the dice for the clothes he had warn
The curtain in the temple was torn.
Three days from now he would rise.
And there were many who were surprised.
Thereâs no more mystery and no more Terrortory
Thereâs no more mystery and no more Terrortory
