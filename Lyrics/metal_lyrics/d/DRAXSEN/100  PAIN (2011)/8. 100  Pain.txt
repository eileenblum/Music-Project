So wonât you take a seat in my office?
Weâll investigate the feats that you claim
I can show you a nightmare!
One that will torment your brain

Once more you are left screaming
But itâs really not that big of a stretch
You just donât have the pedigree
You donât have the marks for the test
100% Pain

I understand your desire
And the need to vent your rage!
But itâs not always about you
Itâs what you can bring to the cage!.

I see your kind almost daily,
A belief you can go all the way!
But takes so much more than desire
Youâll have to do more than just hope and pray.
100% Pain
