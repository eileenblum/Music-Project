Thereâs a tremble in my heart as I knell down beside
A lonely tear it stumbles on my face
Your golden silhouette is slowly rising up above me
As a frozen scream is silenced on escape

Theres a candle on the table, castes a flicker of shadow
And memories they roll neatly through the flames
The wind outside is vague but itâs raining to the max
And the levy of my mind it bares the weight.

Wilted flowers they stare back from the corner of the table,
Tattered carpet it rolls neatly to the door.
So I stand and slowing turn heading sternly to tomorrow
But this day will linger on forever more.
