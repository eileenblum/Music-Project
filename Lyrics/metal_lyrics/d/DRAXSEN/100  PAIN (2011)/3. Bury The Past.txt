What your thinking is not so strange!
The insecurities are melting your brain.
Itâs not a nightmare!
Itâs not a dream!
Itâs just reality tearing at the seams.

[Chorus]
Youâve got to bury the past today
Youâve got to bury the past today

You look for answers, You chase you dreams
The deafening sound as your lonely heart screams
You wade around in shallow depths of reasons why

[Chorus]
