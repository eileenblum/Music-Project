She lied, with eyes caste down.
Slowly I felt my stomach churn.
When the light shone, she had gone.
When the night shone, sheâd gone away

She lied, with blush shaded lips.
Slowly hers words they crushed my heart.
When the night come, she had run.
When the night come, sheâd run away

She lied, with an iced charged tongue.
Slowly she froze me to the core.
Where the light shone, her shadow had gone.
When the light shone her shadow fades away
