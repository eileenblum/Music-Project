Remember from what height you have fallen and do the deeds you did at 1st.
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts,
And I looked and behold: a pale horse. And his name, that sat on him,
was Death.
And Hell followed with him.

[Chorus]
With the reigns between his teeth, Heâs a man of true grit
To the sound of horses hooves, Rides a man of true grit
With a pistol in each hand, fires a man of true grit
Heâll never let you down; Heâs a man of true grit
Hear the rooster crow, Heâs a man of true grit
Fill your hands. Roars the man of true grit
Righteous is the man, The man of true grit
Ready and at hand, is the man of true grit

So untill Armageddon The wise men will bow down before the throne.
And at his feet they'll cast a golden crown. Listen to the words long written down,
When the man of true grit comes around.

[Dedicated to the men of true grit John Wayne &amp; Johnny Cash]
