Diggers die to protect our homes from the unseen threat.
Still they invade from across the sea; weâll take them in you bet!
In leaky boats, our borders under siege. The precedent is set.

[Chorus:]
The PC fan fair thatâs holding us back, our weakness they exploit
Drive by shootings a random act, whoâs this running this joint?
The seedy side of the underworld thereâs more than just a few.
Asylum seekers is all that they are!! We know that thatâs not true.

Surprise surprise there in the news again. Fanatics in the extreme
From the scheming eastern sands, we swim against the stream.
The pot it boils under the intense heat, to our deafening screams.

[Chorus]

So you want to bring our diggers home, When the jobs half done.
Itâs like we are running scared from the terrorist gun.
You must be joking, Have you lost your mind. We arenât here for fun.
