Iâm overwhelmed with my worthlessness.
I no need to get out of bed
To severe all of my feelings
To severe my head.

[Chorus]
Iâve got the world coming down on me
It goes as far as the eye can see.
The black dogs got a hold on me.

What more could it want from me
He has my life and my dignity
The black dog has his leash on me.

Iâm so pessimistic
When he bays at the moon
He knows that he has me now
I feel his jaws again soon.

[Chorus]

So in the misty morning
Iâm gonna end it all
The life sucking black dog
Is gonna take the fall
