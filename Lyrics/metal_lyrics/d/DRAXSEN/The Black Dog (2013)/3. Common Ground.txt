I look around and what do I see. 10 Thousand faces staring back at me.
I try to find new places to go. But they keep finding my new hidey whole.
My ears prick when I hear the alarm, Medication time at the funny farm.
We line up to receive our fix, But they canât find the perfect mix.

[Chorus:]
Iâll come running when I hear you call; I wonât let you down anymore.
Standing tall for the very first time. Iâm gonna take it and make it mine.
Can we meet on common ground? This time around.

Iâll take the pressure and Iâll never fall. I didnât hurt you at all.
I know your sceptic of my intensions. This personality my next invention.
Iâm walking tall but itâs all deceit. To see me squirm must be quite a treat.
The next alarm wakes me from my slumber. Inside here I just another number.

[Chorus]

I sit and wait as itâs all I can do. Locked away in this human zoo.
They say I killed you and now youâre dead. The doctors think Iâm out of my head
Iâm restrained for my own safety. I just feel a little off here lately.
They ask me where you can be found, To reveal my dumping ground.
