[Verse 1]
The way you looked at me in the starlight
Like an angel no one has ever seen.
You mesmerise me with your eyes so bright
And I was only seventeen

[Chorus:]
And now youâve changed
You canât deign me now, oh
You didnât have to lie
I could have shown you the light
You didnât have to lie
Youâve forced me to reveal my hand tonight.

[Verse 2]
So now Iâm left without a heart beat
Forced to walk the sands alone
No more will I feel pleasure
Trapped forever in this loveless zone.

[Chorus]
