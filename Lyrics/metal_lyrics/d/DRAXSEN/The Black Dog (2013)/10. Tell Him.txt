Hello? No heâs not here right now.
Whatâs that? So you had a fight.
Itâs OK... Where did this happen?
Whatâs that? Well I hope your fine

[Chorus]
Tell him itâs Cindy, Ask him to call.
This is my number 86753124
Tell him itâs Cindy, Ask him to call.
Say that Iâm sorry. Please ask him to call...

Hello? Oh, itâs you again.
Why? Whatâs wrong? Well where is he now?
Is it bad? Girl itâs not your fault.
Iâm coming now! Iâll be there soon...

[Chorus]
Tell him Iâm coming, Iâll be there soon
Tell him I love him, just hold on
