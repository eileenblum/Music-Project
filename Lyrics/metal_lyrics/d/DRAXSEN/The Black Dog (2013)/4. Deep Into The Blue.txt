[Verse 1]
In the opaque of the morning sun. Your silhouette takes to the wing,
Ohh Pain is such a lonely place, Where black angels go to sing.
So your thoughts become so manic And in the dark you scream alone
Tomorrows just an apparition The foundation of your corner stone.

[Chorus]
Deep into the, Down into the. Deep into the blue
Deep into the, Down into the blue

[Verse 2]
Is there a place where I can where I can drop you off? Is there someone I can call for you?
You can tip toe through the water, But the rain will drench you through.
So in the rain is where I left you. On that night so long ago.
My trouble mind still tends to haunt me But how was I supposed to know.

[Chorus]
Deep into the, Down into the. Deep into the blue
Deep into the, Down into the blue

[Verse 3]
My memoryâs over loaded Perhaps a prayers the place to start.
When the pain is in remission We can defrag your human heart.
So the next time that youâre down here You better pop by and say hello.
I might just be on the boil Youâll never know until you give it ago.

[Chorus]
Deep into the blue, Thatâs turning black
Down into the blue. Itâs a long way back.

[Verse 4]
So in the rain is where I left you On that night so long ago.
My trouble mind still tends to haunt me But how was I supposed to know.
My memoryâs over loaded Perhaps a prayers the place to start.
When the pain is in remission We can defrag your human heart.

[Chorus]
Deep into the, Down into the. Deep into the blue
Deep into the, Down into the blue
