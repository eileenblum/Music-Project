[Verse 1]
You have big brown eyes, Theyâre the light into your soul.
And when you smile at me, My confidence grows bold.
I want to hold you, So I can feel each breath you take.
I sip at the well of love, Each sip I love to make.

[Chorus]
Are You An Angel Or A Dream [4x]

[Verse 2]
I dream of your golden locks, flowing down your back.
Iâm your disciple, Iâll follow you to hell and back.
You have the patience, The patience of a saint.
No greater portrait could Picasso paint.

[Chorus]
Are You An Angel Or A Dream [4x]

[Bridge]
You offered me salvation, I run into your arms.
I wash your feet in arbitraged, before I lay down palms.
What is it about you, that draws me to your life.
Just a game of lust in love, to take you for my wife.
