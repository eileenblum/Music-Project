My so called friends call me Skippy and hop a long as well
And even though I don't fit the profile I'm in the same prison cell,
Chronic Hell

So if you think you know me well you know what I claim,
That everything I've earned through life I've earned in chronic pain.

Now we live everyday man, the best way we can
And when it comes to rock n roll we really know how to Jam!
