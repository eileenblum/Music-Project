It's back, after 10 short years away.
And it's out to get me as sure as I stand here this day!
And it's motivation
They're more intense this time.
I could hardly believe my eye's, I'd thought I'd left it behind.

He is in every nightmare and stocks me everyday
I'm infected by him and its deep into my core.

The devastation of knowing what lies ahead
The battle to end all battles is right inside my head

He is in every nightmare and stocks me everyday
I'm infected by him and its deep into my core.
