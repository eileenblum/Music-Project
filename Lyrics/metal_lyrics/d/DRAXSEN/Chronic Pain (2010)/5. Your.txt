Is that death in your eyes?
Is that death in your practiced smile?
Now you've established your ties.
We all think that you're...
We all think that you're...

Scheduled pills is just a code.
Deep depression is just a way of life.
And to this faith you must hold.
We all fear that you're...
We all fear that you're...

I hear you say we don't care
All we need is our attitude
Positivity will get us there!
And we fell for you...
Yes we feel for you
That you're...
