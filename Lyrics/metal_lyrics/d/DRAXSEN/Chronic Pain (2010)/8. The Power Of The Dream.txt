Now you re standing at the starting line only fate stands in your way
And you re waiting for the start gun to set you on your way.
Do you have the team to go the distance?
Is it your passion or someone else s scheme?

In the daily grind and struggle you ask the question everyday
What is it about you that will take you all the way?
Is it your team that makes the difference?
Or is it the power that comes from within.

As you walk into the cauldron you hear the thousands scream your name.
And after all the years you've sacrificed, It s still a 50 â 50 game.
It s not your team there just a factor
It s your heart and the dreams your own.

That's the power of the dream!
