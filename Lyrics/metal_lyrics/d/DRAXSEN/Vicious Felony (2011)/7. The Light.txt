It's concrete that you taste, another opportunity gone to waste.
What you feel is not despair and you hate it when they take you there.
You've been waiting here for song long
But your syphilis mind is not that strong

[Chorus:]
You're clandestine and bane are bound together with pain.
I can't help you tonight, cause I just can't see you tonight.

Your smile is assumed, another tendency that you have groomed.
And your heart is in there somewhere, a myocardial infraction I hear!
Why do you keep going back for more?
It's so deranged how you keep the score.

[Chorus]

Face to face, rejected again and it somehow fits into your plan
The brutal truth you push to a side, an optional extra to your pride

[Chorus x2]
