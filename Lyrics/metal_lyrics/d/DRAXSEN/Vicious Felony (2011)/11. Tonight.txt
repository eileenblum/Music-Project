I sat all alone in the darkness.
I sat all alone in the night.
I'm waiting for you to whisper in my ear
But I fear you won't be here tonight

I stand all alone in the darkness
I stand all alone in the night
The thoughts on my mind are really not that clear
Cause I fear, you won't be hear tonight

Oh! what is this before me
I'm drawn into the light
The seed that was planted has sprouted to the word
And it's the best think that I have heard tonight

Oh! what is this before me
I'm drawn into the light
There's no more waiting say the voices in my ears
And my the fears have disappeared tonight

I stood all alone in the darkness
I stood all alone in the night
And as I waited it become oh so clear
That you were here all along
