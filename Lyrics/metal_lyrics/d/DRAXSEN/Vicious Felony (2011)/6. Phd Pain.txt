I have a masters in Pain
The son of a serpent I will rain.
I will go and you will prey day by day by day
I will go, you will pray.

I am the bringer of doom.
Your blood fills the chalice in my tomb
I will go and you will prey day by day by day
I will go, you will pray.

I will ride, You will pray
For your life I claim this day.
Take your life take your sole
Take it all and I won't let go!

The sky will be black
And there will be no more mourning
