I'm on the floor in the dark all alone
Torn and twist at the foot of my bed.
And the last thing I see is my heart.
Bleeding tears I could have never shed

[Chorus:]
Now is your cup half empty
Or is your cup half full
And are we all to consider,
And factor in your gene pool

It's not the size of the dog in the fight; it's the size of the fight in the dog!
"B" Positive is not just a blood type; it's so much more than a kiss from a frog

[Chorus]

So now the warm has turned
And it's your turn to burn.
Your gonna pay for the pain that you've put me through
And you're not aware of what coming to you
