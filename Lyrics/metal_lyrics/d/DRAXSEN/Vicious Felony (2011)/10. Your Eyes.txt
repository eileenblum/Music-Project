[Son:]
It's so strange how my horoscope is to walk in your shoes
But nothings ever good enough and who am I to refuse.
Through the many years of sacrifice, the blood sweat and the tears
Being your son was never easy, throughout the years

[Father:]
It's a sin my son, to turn your back on this gift
It's time to tune up the symphony and execute that riff'.
If you could only see your eyes the way that I do,
Then you might understand what it is I have to do.

[Son:]
You look down on all of us from your tower of power
You wade around in your past transgressions, hour after hour.
I know that back in the day, you mastered the game.
And how you concurred all but me, now brings you shame.

[Father:]
It's a sin my son, to turn your back on this gift
It's time to tune up the symphony and execute that riff'.
If you could only see your eyes the way that I do,
Then you might understand what it is I have to do..

It's only natural for a father to help his son
To give him opportunities, not to crawl but run
So you can avoid the same mistake that I've done.
So in the final innings you can bat a Tonne.
