I'm sick of you treating me like a joke
You screwed with me once too often
You always new which button to press
See my faith through my actions

Now we've reached the bottom of the ninth
I'm gonna change my tactics
I'm not gonna bite anymore
See my faith through my actions

[Chorus:]
The evil you shine
The black growth on your heart
The evil you shine
It's been growing from the start
The evil you shine
Don't tempt me anymore
The evil you shine
It don't shine on me no more

So now you call me up
You call me up and turn me on
You screw my brain till hurts
See my faith through my actions

[Chorus]

Now we reached the bottom of the ninth
I'm gonna change my tactics
I'm not gonna bite anymore
See my faith through my actions

[Chorus]
