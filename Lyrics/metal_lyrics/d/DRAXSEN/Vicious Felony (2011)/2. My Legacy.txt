Standing at the edge of this Abyss
The bride of all my failure and my shame.
The pain that casts a shadow of envy and hate

The days they seem so endless
Left alone with my own thoughts.
And a conspiracy with a never ending plot.

[Chorus:]
Legacy â pain
Story â insane
Straight jacket
For your mind.

The man in the mirror I know longer recognize.
As he's consumed by my anger and my hate

Still the blame it starts to fester as it
Reaches boiling point
A viscous cycle emphasized in all I do!

[Chorus:]
Legacy â pain
Story â insane
Straight jacket
For your mind.
