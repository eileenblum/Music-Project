What you did never bothered you
But it sure took its toll on your conscience
So, late last night it paid a call
To take revenge on you with

Nightmares

Waking up you shrug it off
You tell yourself that beds don't move
But you're in its playground now
And you mind fields at team of

Nightmares

Pretty soon you're a screaming mess
Your sleepless eyes they tell no lies
But how do you make truce
With your big bad conscience feeding you

Nightmares
