[Chorus]
How did the years come between us?
Why did we both let them go?
And the lives weâve lead in between us.
Just waiting for that fork in the road, to bring me back to you!

The truth knows we never lied
The truth knows weâre both shy
Two young kids with diamonds for dreams
Young kids with young memories it seems.

Forever checking the rear view mirror
That second glance at a passer by
The two kids now so much older
A blink of an eye and lifeâs gone by.

The lines on my face show distinction
The smile in your eyes still warms my heart
Time has passed and I canât change that
All I can offer is a brand new start.
