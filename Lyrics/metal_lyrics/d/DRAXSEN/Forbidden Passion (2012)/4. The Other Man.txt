Iâm counting the days til Iâm with you
And Iâm prepared to do what I have to do
Iâm climbing up that mountain
To prove myself to you.
Iâm climbing up that mountain
To get a respectable view

[Chorus:]
Donât want to be the other man
Weâve got to talk about a plan
Donât what too be the other man
oh no, not any more

Itâs so frustrating living this way.
Stealing every moment we can every day.
Kick start our feelings.
Getting stronger every day Kick start our feelings.
Thereâs just one thing Iâll state

[Chorus]
