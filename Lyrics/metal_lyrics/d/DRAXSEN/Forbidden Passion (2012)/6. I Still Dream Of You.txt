In the evening, Oh yeah, When the lights are going down
My thoughts of days gone by, when we were both so young
Itâs so amazing when I look at you and the love that we had found.
I still remember that young girlâs smile and the tune that my heart sung.

[Chorus]
I still dream, dream of you, every night, every night of my life
I still dream, dream of you, every night, until the morning light.

Iâm thinking of you, Oh yeah, and the message you just text me.
You are so thoughtful with your tenderness on every day and every day to come
My heart still dances every time,every time you sit on my knee.
Although we have aged ,just like everyone, Well we still know how to have fun.

[Chorus]
I still dream, dream of you, every night, every night of my life
I still dream, dream of you, every night, until the morning light.
