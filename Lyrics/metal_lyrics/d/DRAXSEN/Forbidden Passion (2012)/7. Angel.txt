[Chorus]
Angel, in the morning your my rising sun
Angel, Sleeping beauty, youâre my only one

My heart it yearns for the touch of your lips, as you walk through the door.
I feel your love in your finger tips, and a whole lot more.
On wings of gold you come to take me away, to a life of bliss.
There is no other place that Iâd rather to be, when we pause to kiss.

[Chorus]
Angel, my secret lover no one else will do
Angel, your golden wings encase my love for you.

I see your smile from across the room and passion stills my heart.
I long for you every day of my life and have from right at the start.
I see your face everywhere that I look, from dawn to dusk.
I canât believe just how lucky I am, as you are all that I lust.

[Chorus]
Angel, you have revealed my hidden passion for you
Angel, I must be patient as I wait for you.

Angel, in the morning your my rising sun
Angel, Sleeping beauty, youâre my only one
Angel, my secret lover no one else will do
Angel, your golden wings encase my love for you
Angel, you have revealed my hidden passion for you
Angel, I must be patient as I wait for you.
