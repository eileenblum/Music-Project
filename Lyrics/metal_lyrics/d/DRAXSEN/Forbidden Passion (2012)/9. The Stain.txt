When I look into your eyes, I see the task at hand.
For me to proceed, I must be sure,
You clearly understand.

[Chorus]
There'll be an ounce of pain, when I take away your Stain, Your mark of Cain,
The blame was placed on you one fateful night. [2x]

The contracts here and you me sign, agreeing to the fee.
Take your time and read it through,
That you might clearly see.
Do you understand, there will be some pain [4x]

[Chorus]
Your question is still relevant and time will clearly show
Now your clean and satisfied,
Where did your Stain go?
Well now I wear your stain.
