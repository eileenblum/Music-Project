Your green eyes and pouting lips, shatters my concentration.
Your long dark hair falls across your face, enhancing my fascination.
Your smile always warms my heart.
Iâd like to speak but the words donât start.

[Chorus]
Oh, Hi beam, wet dream. Oh please donât wake me!
Bikini clad, Very Bad, Driving me insane

Your slender legs in those hot hi heels, giving me palpitations.
Youâre a goddess with golden wings, giving hope and inspiration.
My, my I donât ever want to come down
Euphoria is what Iâve found.

[Chorus]
Oh, Hi beam, wet dream. Oh please donât wake me!
Bikini clad, Very Bad, Driving me insane
