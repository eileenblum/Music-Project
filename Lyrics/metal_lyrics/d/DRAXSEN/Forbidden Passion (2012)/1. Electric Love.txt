You can take a look and wonder
Or you can sign up and see
Iâm not just another number
I can be digitally free

I can send you a photograph
You can send one to me
Signed off with an emoticon
And itâs all viral free.

[Chorus]
Electric You, Electric me
Electric news to ignite me
Electric You, Electric me
Electric views that excite me
Electric You, Electric me
Electric rules for our honesty
Electric You, Electric me
Itâs our electrical sanctuary

Itâs not an ideal romance
But itâs the best that weâve got
Itâs our key strokes that dance
Log on or log off.

You can dare to ignore me
But Iâll be tracking you down
You can change all your passwords
You can change your name!
