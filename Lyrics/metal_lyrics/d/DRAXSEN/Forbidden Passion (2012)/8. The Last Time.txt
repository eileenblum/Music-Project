Oh Why? Why did we end it this way
Oh Why ? You promised youâd stay
You never hinted at this before
Now I watch you close the door

[Chorus]
This is the first and the last time, You have said goodbye
This is the first and the only time that Iâve seen you cry
This is not the first but the last time, I will see your smile.
This is not the first but the only time, for a long long while.

Oh I, I have looked for the reasons
And your emotions change like the seasons.
One day your hot the next your rain
The tears you cry will leave a stain.

[Chorus]
