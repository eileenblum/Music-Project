[Chorus:]
My forbidden passion, Rising up from the back seat tonight
My forbidden passion, A desire for all earthly delights
My forbidden passion, Rising up from the back seat tonight
My forbidden passion, A desire for all earthly delights

Not stated, frustrated, I only have you on my mind.
You feel it, I deal it, and youâre just one of a kind.
Iâm scheming, just dreaming I might see you today.
Canât stop me, you rock me; Iâm taking it all the way.
Your intensity is just so inspiring to me because you are

[Chorus]

Iâm sensing, youâre tensing, lay back into my arms.
Contact you, relax you, youâre got me in your palms
I run from, no fun from, she crushes all my dreams
So to you, I run to, you enable all it seems.
I cannot believe that you are so giving to me as you are

[Chorus]
