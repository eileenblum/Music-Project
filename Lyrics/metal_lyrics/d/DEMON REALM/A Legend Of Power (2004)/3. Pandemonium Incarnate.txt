We are the might of chaos
We are chaos incarnate
With chaos we shall obtain
DOMINATION
Chaos be us chaos
Chaos free us chaos
Chaos bring us chaos
Bring me - chaos damnation and war
War-War of the race
War-War for the dark
War-For we are the sons
WE BRING WAR
Show me - chaos pain and war
Chaos come to us we are of thine
We art thy chaos warriors
We burn with thy chaotic hatred
Chaos come unto me
With thy might we shall invoke chaos
Thou made us warmongers of chaos
Thy biding we shall serve for chaos
Chaos bring us war
Chaos bring us death
Chaos bring us pain
We are - pain death and war
