Before the mask
For the blood it was
It was undone
None shall see
But all shall be
Longing mortal visions
Carried by dead hands
Across the fields of plague
Howling winds of suffering
I feel the dark flames
I see them burning my flesh
And willingly I embrace
What might be
My last breath
Darkness is
What Is Not
I will just sit here all alone
And curse humanity
