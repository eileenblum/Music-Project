I stand alone for eternity's unbound
Till the end of time I am the one
Bleeding to the abyss the blood is theirs
Lord of darkness we are thine
Unbound be the darkness
For it is my soul
And the darkness is I
My eternity
For all eternity
Until forever is no more
Ages of wrath grown
Ages of hate grown
Ages of sin grown
I am strong
Standing alone
In the seas of blood
Reaching up
For the skies of fire
All shall be mine
The sun now setting unto darkness
Our time our time has come
