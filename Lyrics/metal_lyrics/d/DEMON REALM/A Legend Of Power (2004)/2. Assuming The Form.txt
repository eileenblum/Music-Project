Master I am thee
Transmogrification
Assuming the form
Of a yearning Deity
In thy form I shall rule
For master I am thee
I shall always be thee
Fallen gods cry out
Death's unseen in the abyss
Death to the fallen gods
Proclaim their death in the abyss
Lord of the darkness
Lord of death
Lord of all
My soul is marked
I am thy servant
You are me
I serve only me...
I am the creature
I am the beast
