This path I walk
I can't stray
I've chosen my way
Where it takes me
I must follow
Let me demons
Led by demons
Bring me the darkness
Give me the sign
I have yearned for
Guide my dark path
Bleeding the hate
I walk filthy soil
Breathing the wrath
I wander the wasteland
Seeing the soul of innocence
Crushing faithfully of death
On my hands their life has left
My path leads me to the unknown
I am the source of hate
I am the ruin of hope
I am the blood of anger
I am destroyer of life
So where will my path take me
I who man this disgrace towards all
Eternity holds the key to the gate
The gate shall be opened
