Until death takes its mark
I will stand alone
For my Gods might
I slay the fallen souls
Over the lands of the dead
My wrath shall be felt
To be to be
What earth can be!
I am the son of darkness
I am the brood of hatred
I have the strength of damnation
I see the fire in the black abyss
I see the souls of the dead arise
For the wrath I have become
For the hate I shall be
It is all I am
I am all
