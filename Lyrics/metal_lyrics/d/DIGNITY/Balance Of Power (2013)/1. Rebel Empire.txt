[Music: Pitters, lyrics: Adamsen]

Here I stand alone and forsaken
I'm the master in my own castle
I can see the lies they are selling
I won't bow down as I'm breathing

In control I'm wide awake
I'm aware of the snake in the grass
Now I know all will be revealed
Time to turn to the gods of my beliefs

Take my hands and run
To the temples of wisdom
I will forever fly free
My rebel empire, my Holy War

To the gates of hell I storm
I will face you with no fear
Temples come crashing down
Time to turn to my kingdom come

Take my hands and run
To the temples of wisdom
I will forever fly free
My rebel empire, my Holy War

Here I stand alone and forsaken
I'm the master in my castle
Now I know all will be revealed
Time to turn to my kingdom come

Take my hands and run
To the temples of wisdom
I will forever fly free
My rebel empire, my Holy War
