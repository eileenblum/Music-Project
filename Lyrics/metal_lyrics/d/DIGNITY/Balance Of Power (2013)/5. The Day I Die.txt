[Music &amp; lyrics: Pitters]

A darkened dream that is so unreal
I believe that it's true
The dance of the death, a mistery tale
I don't know what to do

Walk from the dark
Back into the light

Look into my crying eyes
What do you see
Your own demise
Keep me near till night passes by
To the day that I die

I can feel your touch, I can watch your eyes
They are burning like a flame
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing control
I don't know who's to blame

Walk from the dark
Back into the light

Look into my crying eyes
What do you see
Your own demise
Keep me near till night passes by
To the day that I die

When it seems all hope has gone
I have to carry on somehow
I've got to rebuild all dreams
In my fate I still believe

Look into my crying eyes
What do you see
Your own demise
Keep me near till night passes by
To the day that I die
