[Music: Pitters, lyrics: Adamsen]

Angel falling born to die
Crashing down just like a
Thunder coming from the sky
Hear the gods are crying

Soon the world will be done
Mankind on the run

Darkness from the heavens
Let freedom rain down on me
Endless situation
Eternal damnation awaits and
Freedom reign eternally

Angel bleeding from her eyes
Tears of crystal hit the Earth
(Earth) are shaking hear the cries
Now the gods are dying

Soon the world will be done
Mankind on the run

Darkness from the heavens
Let freedom rain down on me
Endless situation
Eternal damnation awaits and
Freedom reign eternally

Wrath of the heavens can be heard
Let freedom wash (away) all of our sins

Soon the world will be done
Mankind on the run

Darkness from the heavens
Let freedom rain down on me
Endless situation
Eternal damnation awaits and
Freedom reign eternally
