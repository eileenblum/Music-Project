[Music: Pitters, lyrics: Adamsen]

This empty room
Reminds me of my twisted mind
I'm searching for a way out

Fear and regret is all I am fed
Taking me to the edge of the light
Anger and guilt is all that I feel
Now I know now that this is for real

The fight
Turning shadows into light
The pain
Inside of this burning heart of mine

Running into the darkness
I am forever
The lost and the savage
I'm burning into the night
Trying to understand but the time is right
To break these shackles of war

These aching bones begin to rot
The smell of death
I'm searching for a way out

Cold and alone
Chilled to the bone
Taking me to the edge of my dream
Sorrow and pain is all that I feel
Now I know now that this is for me

The fight
Turning shadows into light
The pain
Inside of this burning heart of mine

Running into the darkness
I am forever
The lost and the savage
I'm burning into the night
Trying to understand but the time is right
To break these shackles of war
