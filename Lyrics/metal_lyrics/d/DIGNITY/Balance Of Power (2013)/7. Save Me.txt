[Music: Navratil, Pitters, lyrics: Pitters]

Running up, running down
Take me higher to show me my way
I'm breaking in pieces, I'm drifting away

Fire is the danger I see
Respire all the years I've been raging in vain
Staring into the void
I feel that I run insane

Can stop this illusion
Don't turn on me now
I'm falling

Save me from reality
Spinning around in circles
I scream without a sound
Reach for a helping hand

Crawling up, tumbling down
Innocent victim of merciless crime
Watch me, I'm fading, I'm captured in time

Driven - I am burning inside
Forgiven - I am living my life, so unreal
Lifting shadows off dreams
Coming inside my view

Can stop this illusion
Don't turn on me now
I'm falling

Save me from reality
Spinning around in circles
I scream without a sound
Reach for your helping hand

Give you up
Leave things behind
Falling through the pages
No more dreams left behind
