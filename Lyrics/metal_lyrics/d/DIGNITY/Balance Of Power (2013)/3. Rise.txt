[Music: Navratil, Pitters, lyrics: JB Bastard, Pitters]

Soon to start
Proud and strong
We will rise and march along to

End your time
Fight for rights
To bring the power on
And guide our way back home

Crying helplessly
Too much we stand
In time
Waiting so patiently
Our freedom will reign again

Turn the page
Open our hearts
Death is close, we are drowning

Hate is gone
Love returned
We will rule our lives again
And no one will tear us apart

Crying helplessly
Too much we stand
In time
Waiting so patiently
Our freedom will reign again

Waiting so patiently
In freedom and harmony

Crying helplessly
Too much we stand
In time
Waiting so patiently
Our freedom will reign again
