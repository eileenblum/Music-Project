[Music: Navratil, Pitters, lyrics: Adamsen]

Lying here among the demons in my head
I start to meltdown
Fear and hate is all consuming
My beliefs and now the breakdown

Servant of fire I am
Fighting the demons away from my mind
Deceiver is calling

Drifting away
All I see is a lion among sheep
(I'm) trapped inside my mind
Spinning round I can see
The lion attacks

Staring at the prey I feel
The beast in me returning slowly
Victim of my own desire
Sleep with me, burn in the fire

Servant of fire I am
Fighting the demons away from my mind
Deceiver is calling

Drifting away
All I see is a lion among sheep
I'm trapped inside my mind
Spinning round I can see
The lion

Drifting away
All I see is a lion among sheep
I'm trapped inside my mind
Spinning round I can see
The lion attacks

Servant of fire I am
Fighting the demons
Away from my mind
Deceiver is calling

Drifting away
All I see is a lion among sheep
I'm trapped inside my mind
Spinning round I can see
The lion

Drifting away
All I see is a lion among sheep
I'm trapped inside my mind
Spinning round I can see
The lion attacks
