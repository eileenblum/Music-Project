[Music &amp; lyrics: Pitters]

Tears run down my eyes
I turn my back on paradise
Darkness in me
I feel the fire
My nightmare has come to life

Hate twists my mind
I left all sorrows behind
Angels of light you hear my calling
Insanity left behind

Flesh will burn the air tonight
I came here to start all this madness
Left my fear far away from here
So say your prayers
A nightmare has come to sight

Cry of the angels
Trapped inside a dream I'm falling down
Take my soul, take my vanished life
To lead me down the path
From the darkness into the light

Blood down my eyes
I hear you calling
My memories fade away

Flesh will burn the air tonight
I came here to start all this madness
Left my fear far away from here
So say your prayers
A nightmare has come to sight

Cry of the angels
Trapped inside a dream I'm falling down
Take my soul, take my vanished life
To lead me down the path
From the darkness into the light
