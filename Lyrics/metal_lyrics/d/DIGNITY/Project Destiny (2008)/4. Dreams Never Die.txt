A broken window
And a bird that gasps for air
The final breath - black eyes
look back at me screaming in despair

In one second I'm awake
And sweat drops falling from my head
Yet another dream
Continuously comes back into me

Message without meaning.
Leave a clue - freeze rewind
Where is the sign
What does this really mean
Or am I dreaming in a dream

It's your mind that guides you
In the world around you
Where veracity replies
To creations in your mind

If you're gone tomorrow
Time erases sorrow
As long as you never give in
Your dreams will never die

I'm in a hunt
But I'm the hunted on the run
No matter how determined
I try to run, my legs do not reply

I'm on an airplane
And I'm falling through the clouds
But there have been years since then
And still I have no sight of solid ground

Message without meaning
Leave a clue - freeze rewind
Where is the sign
What does this really mean
Or am I dreaming in a dream
