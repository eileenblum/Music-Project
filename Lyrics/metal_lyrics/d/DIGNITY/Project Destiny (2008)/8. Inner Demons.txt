Am I walking in circles
Wrapped up in myself?
Do I miss a companion
A lover or friend?

I don't know, I don't know anything more.

Feelings are hard to describe
Contradictions collide

I must be my own worst enemy
Suicide is a sin
Here I stand on my own...

I'm not alone
My inner demons
Keeps me company
All the time
Every day and - night

Do I falter in darkness on long winding roads
Can I cope with the pressure of such a great load

I don't know, I don't know anything more

Why do I talk to myself?
Why do I call out for help?

I must be my own worst enemy
Suicide is a sin
Here I stand on my own

I'm not alone
My inner demons
Keeps me company
All the time
Every day and - night

Feelings are hard to describe
Contradictions collide

I'm not alone
My inner demons
Keeps me company
All the time
Every day and - night
