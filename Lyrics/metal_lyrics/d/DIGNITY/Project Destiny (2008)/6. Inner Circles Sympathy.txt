I'm getting all upset, afraid at the same time
The only thing that counts
Who has the most things the day he dies

Same hunger in us all
To be somebody else
Consort with enemies
To find a way to make them fail

And here I am
Among my friends
But who can I trust?

I know there is a place
A place where we belong
Not in this squirrel wheel
Where all comes back to square one

There is a timer set
Awaiting to be found
I guess it's mother earths
Revenge

What can we do
The inner circles sympathy
While we are falling faster

A complex fight
Where no one think alike
Why can't you see our destiny

As long as I'm alive
I'm gonna rest my case
But I am pretty sure that
Someone will reveal it all

Not saying I'm a judge
And I ain't gonna blame
Our society for nuclear winter rains

And here I am
Among my friends
But who can I trust

What can we do
The inner circles sympathy
While we are falling faster

A complex fight
Where no one think alike
Why can't you see our destiny.

Communications failed
Somewhere along the way.
One word and suddenly
The walls are closing in again

There is a mystery
How anything can work
I'm sick and tired of it all
