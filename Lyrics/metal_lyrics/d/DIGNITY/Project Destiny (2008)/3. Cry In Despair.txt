They say that time heals all wounds
Please describe

How long it takes and
How it's done

She looks like an angel from heaven sent
A power you can not describe
You had what you thought
Unconditional
Emotions that ended in hell

Cry in despair
As worlds falling apart
Just show me and
The rest will be a journey
To the STARS

Who decides what is
Destined to be?

I wanna live for eternity

She looks like an angel from heaven sent
A power you can not describe
You had what you thought
Unconditional
Emotions that ended in hell

Cry in despair
As worlds falling apart
Just show me and
The rest will be a journey
To the STARS

Like when the darkness
Takes me far away
And when I wake
I fear to sleep again
So many thoughts and tears
I've shed in vain
Until the end
I'm walking on my own

She looks like an angel from heaven sent
A power you can not describe
You had what you thought
Unconditional
Emotions that ended in hell
