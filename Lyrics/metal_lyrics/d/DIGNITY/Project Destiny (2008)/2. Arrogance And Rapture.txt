I wish we found a cure against
All these Infections
In our society a lethal death injection
So many human lives to save against depression
Caused by the greedy hearts
Arrogance and rapture

When it feels like life is a torture hall
And there is no way out
You just close your eyes
A new tomorrow
You need to realize

You can't just stand there in the cold
And believe it blows over

It is time for a change let your voice be heard
We just have one chance
On this planet earth

Open your mind
Live your life like this day where your last
That's how you stay alive

As you are walking down
The memory lane
Your eyes stay dry
And when you think you're all alone in desperate
Just make the call

You can't just stand there in the cold
And believe it blows over

It is time for a change let your voice be heard
We just have one chance
On this planet earth

Open your mind
Live your life like this day where your last
That's how you stay alive

So surreal
How you conquered your own fears
Ended all without saying goodbye
You are gone
Rest of my days

Now and then a silent tear
will fall from my eyes
It Is heard to say good bye
And believe it blows over

It is time for a change let your voice be heard
We just have one chance
On this planet earth

Open your mind
Live your life like this day where your last
That's how you stay alive
