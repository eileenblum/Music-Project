Welcome to a world of hate
Injustice reigns with rage
We try to loose uncertainty
Innocence is gone
We try to move along
A road that's full of anger
Full of hate. Disorder!

Hold me tight, when stars collide
In this place we search our fate.
Cry for love, for help above.
Live your life with dignity
Search your own destiny

A dishonest smile
Another compete stranger
A makeshift love affair
A habit forming secret craving

Temporary pain
At least it eases his hunger
Own the clothes he wears
And a spot on the street
And a life in despair

All have been children
Innocent and full of life
But some get rich while some die young

Listen to the proud
Master of the order
Once a poor child on the streets
It's project destiny

A man that's maimed for life
Imprisoned by his body
Fought for liberty
Until a bomb just turned his standing

Immovable pain
A brain without a body
Rather dead than alive
The reward for his life
Was a stone with his name

All have been children
Innocent and full of life
But some get rich while some die young

Listen to the proud
Master of the order
Once a poor child on the streets
It's project destiny

What if I am the one
Unknown powers to reverse what's upside down

Listen to the proud
Master of the order
Once a poor child on the streets
It's project destiny
