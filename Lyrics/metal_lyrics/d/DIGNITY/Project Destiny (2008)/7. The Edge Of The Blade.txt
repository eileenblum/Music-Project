Those endless battles
Foreign souls
Full speed ahead into the wall
No questions asked no answers needed

One put the sword into the stone
Some read a book to find their home
To me both fairytale and fiction

Some believe they live to die
Some have hopes of higher lives
None have proof of anything but still they die

Gazing at the skies
Is there something for us left to find
Are there secrets among our holy places
That can stop us from ending our race
From the edge of the blade

Some saw the light but they survived
And if they died none could describe
Their ultra rapid stream of memories

I've ceased since long to mind
so many questions undefined
but still they re fighting for their prophecies

Some believe they live to die
Some have hopes of higher lives
None have the proof of anything but still they die

Gazing at the skies
Is there something for us left to find
Are there secrets among our holy places
That can stop us from ending our race
From the edge of the blade

As I am gazing at the stars
And wonder if there's life on mars.
All these ecryptic information.
