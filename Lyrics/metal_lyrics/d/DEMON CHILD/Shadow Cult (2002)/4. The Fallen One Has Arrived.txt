Out from the mist, chariots draw near
Nightsky dressed in Black
Winds told the message to all,
Beyond the light a child is born...

Out from dark, storm draw near
Lightning and rain, summons the gate
To infernal legions step forth
Beyond the light a child is born...

Forevermore the light has vanished
Upon the hills of Devil's mountain
Silvery moon bears witness
To the custom so old...
One by one, they enter the halls of Shcolomance
Nine, all in all, but only one is chosen
To receive the power and the glory of night
The eternal gift of Darkness

One to be highest of all
Ruler of the blackest dawn
One to be mightiest of all
Messenger of Satan's call

One to be highest of all
Destroyer of the final war
One to be mightiest of all
Warlord of Satan...

'The Fallen One Has Arrived'
