Finally...
When the gates of war have opened
death slithers to minds of christians
priests of shephard praying their god... No responses
only perfect darkness

This is not only a declaration of war
This time we will kill them all

Proudly we are carrying the torch
that lit the throne of god in flames... BUILT UPON LIES!!!
Eager we are lifting the stake up high
where son of lambs cries... FOR HIS AGONY!!!

Storming sky celebrating death of Nazarene fool
...And his pathetic followers!!!
Sentence given by Satan is carved
...In his lifeless skull!!!

Proudly we are carrying the torch
that lit the throne of god in flames... BUILT UPON LIES!!!
Eager we are lifting the stake up high
where son of lambs cries... FOR HIS AGONY!!!

When we are finished
there's no kingdom of heaven no more
