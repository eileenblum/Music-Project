Among with the fog came the word of Satan,
demons were flying and the light was DEAD!!!

Whispers... Riding with the funeral winds
message of war screaming in my soul so cold
Halls of heaven destroyed for all
this is the end of crucified whore

And I see hellfires raging in the sky
while Christian fools are weeping in their own side
All their churches burnt to the ground
O, I can hear that sweet sound
Forever we will haunt them
and watch how world turns to eternal darkness
Troops of Satan marching with wrath
For we are the nails in the coffin of god

Satan, hold thy sword upon of all
fill the ground with your demons and unholy war
Legions of darkness arise from the depths
so once forgotten chants can echo through the lands

May my heart pulse to darkness
May my soul lurk in shadows
May the bowl of blood be risen
To our unholy father...Satan

For now and forevermore

Whispers... Riding with the funeral winds
message of war screaming in my soul so cold
Halls of heaven destroyed for all
this is the end of crucified whore

Satan, hold thy sword upon of all
fill the ground with your demons and unholy war
Legions of darkness arise from the depths
so once forgotten chants can echo through the lands
