In these dark and mystic times,
under reaping thundersky,
I look myself from the mirror and I see there night.
From the mountains of blackness,
which arise from boundless darkness,
I hail thee O'lord of black throne

Demonic figures flying around me
Leading my thoughts to endless path...
The path of fire and blood.
Whispers, Screams, and Blasphemy
All those that surround me...
As I enter to path of fire and blood.

Thru visions of ancient shadow, I have soared
and saw there demons marching in strength and might...
In strength of Satan.
Thru visions of final dawn, I have soared
and saw there men of god dying
along with their fading light

Those - Who stalk among ravens and beasts...
I am beside thee
Those - Who don't carry any weakness in their hearts...
I am beside thee
Those - Who live in darkness of Satan
I am beside thee

In these dark and mystic times,
under reaping thundersky,
I look myself from the mirror and I see there night.
From the mountains of blackness,
which arise from boundless darkness,
I hail thee O'lord of black throne
