When the shadows of dusk eat away the daylight
And the silence reach the woods, I stalk
Deeper and deeper I wander to my realm
Where night never ends

Here my life has a new meaning
Here my thoughts mark the paths of infinity

Though I have chosen this path to walk among the dead
To walk in the shadows of night... Forever
I have chosen to be as one with thee
Without remorse, without doubts

It's so much clearer in darkness
When the light has gone
The essence of the underworld
Boundless silence, it's presence so near

It's so much more in darkness
When the light has gone
The essence of the underworld
Boundless silence, it's presence so clear

In the centre of this vast so old, I stand alone
Without words I can hear the dreamlike chant of the night
Without words I can hear the call of abyss...

Coldblessed...
