Mighty lord Satan...

Hear your sons calling you
Soon by pooling your strength
We shall crush the dreams of christ's rotten society

You will rule once again with supreme cruelty

Come on, worthless Jehovah,
Let's see what you are made of
In the eve of Armageddon you shall be...

...Decapitated
...Crucified
...DEAD

'Every apprentice of god
shall be strangled in their own entrails'

So strong our hatred is
We can't wait for the battle to begin
Our army shall attack to heaven
While infernal deathchoir sings

O'nocturnal breeze of North
Lead our groups in battlefield
The fools blood will float
The honour the Father of us
