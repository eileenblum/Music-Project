We are preachers of thy Eternal Kingdom
We are disciples of thy Blackend Requiem

Thru the blessing of eternal night
We shall rejoin
And spread the call of thy kingdom

Thru the sacrifice of blood
We shall reclaim
The rights and wisdom beneath and above

Thru the sign of the beast
We shall declare
a war and new era

Thru the meaning darkness
We shall rise
Rise... in the name of Lucifer

Cause we are the brotherhood of death
And we were baptised in darkness...

The Order of the Black Flame...

The Order of the Black Flame...

The Order of the Black Flame...
