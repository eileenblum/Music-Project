You think you're cool you're bloody fool
So now we're gonna come and get ye
You dug a hole hid like a mole
Looks like the king has lost his soul

You had your chance
Was you're last dance
And now your dancing days are over
I am the beast it's time to feast
You'll wish you never had my number

Let's dance come on come on
Let's dance

You're in my sights
And I think I might
Pull this trigger get it over
But you're si slick
You're really quick
You disappeared off my radar
You pissed me off and I'd had enough
So I thought I might return the favour

Let's dance come on come on
Let's dance

You had your chance
Was you're last dance
And now your dancing days are over
Were you afraid you kin of slaves
No more a king not much a soldier

Let's dance come on come on
Let's dance
