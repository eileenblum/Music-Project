You think you've got, but do you want it
You're lookin' pretty why do you make it easy
Look at those heels, check out the wheels
You're runnin' hot but don't want to cool it down

I can see why you're so popular
With everyone you see
I'm mad as hell can't you tell
Just one bite don't make it right
And yes I know that

You're so good at giving it up
Completely over the top
As long as you give it up, you're gonna get it
Tell me that you do it for love
It's me that you're thinking of
Pray to heaven above your gonna get it

You make me sweat can't catch my breath
Eat your fill but you can't get enough of it
You love the thrill it's lake a pill
Goin' down taste's so bad I know you will

I can see why you're so popular
With everyone you see
But I don't care long as you share
You got a lot give me a shot
Now come on over here

You're so good at giving it up
Completely over the top
As long as you give it up, you're gonna get it
Tell me that you do it for love
It's me that you're thinking of
Pray to heaven above your gonna get it
