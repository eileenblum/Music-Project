Girl you know what I feel is real
And I want to carry on with you my special one
You fill every waking hour
Don't ever want to sleep
Don't ever want to miss the chance to catch your breath

And the times that I'm alone
It only brings me sorrow
Can't bare to watch the sun go down
Without you here there can be no tomorrow

I would give the moon and the stars
Just to have you here in my arms

I won't ever make you cry
I'm never gonna lie to you
For as long as I am still alive
This I promise you - I promise you

If I ever caused you pain, it's my shame
I will make it up to you over and over again
There can be no greater love
Than he love I'm feelin' for you

I will fall upon my bended knee
Please hear my plea I'm beggin' you

I'm giving you all that I can
All I can is all that I am

I won't ever make you cry
I'm never gonna lie to you
For as long as I am still alive
This I promise you - I promise you
