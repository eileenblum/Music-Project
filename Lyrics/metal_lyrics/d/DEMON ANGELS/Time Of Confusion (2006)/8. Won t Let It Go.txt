How much nore can I take of this
I won't to give it all up
Yeah! I'm ready to quit
I'm tired of the pressure
Those great expectations
All I ever wanna do is kill these situations

Yeah! There is no nothin' that I wouldn't do
I'd go the extra mile because that's what I do
And when it all comes down to makin' it right
I know I'll make that decision I'll take up the fight

Oh! No I won't let it go
It won't get me down I just want yo to know oh!
No I won't walk away
I'm comin' on through so get outa' my way

I've always been so wreck less and free
You know I couldn't give a damn 'bout
No one else but me
Now I may be older but not much has changed
If I could do it all again
I do exactly the same

Yeah! There is no nothin' that I wouldn't do
I'd go the extra mile because that's what I do
And when it all comes down to makin' it right
I know I'll make that decision I'll take up the fight

Oh! No I won't let it go
It won't get me down I just want yo to know oh!
No I won't walk away
I'm comin' on through so get outa' my way
