Sweet sweet sufferin' Mary
Didn't mean to make you so angry
Can you ever forgive me
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
You're so beautiful above me
You're ever so lovely
Why do I make you so angry
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

Woman I have waited for
The love you give is what I adore
No one else can give me more
Than when we are together, woman we belong

Tell me tell me you need me
And you will all ways with me
You are somethin' to die for
You know! You know! You know! You know!

Woman I have waited for
The love you give is what I adore
No one else can give me more
Than when we are together, woman we belong
