I love the life I'm livin'
I give 'cos I believe in
I've never been mistreated
Makes things so complicated
But my love is not so lucky
She hurts and that disturbs me
Her life is full of sadness
I've tried hard to bring her happiness
My shining light just fades away
She breaks down she turns to me and say
I'm done with life give up the fight
And I can't bare to watch her
Suffer like she does, she's been abused
And now she bleeds

Victoria they can't hurt you anymore
Victoria dry your tears for evermore

You don't know how much I'm angry
She lay there still before me
Her smile was for the first time
Peaceful as I held her hand in mine

My angel what am I to do
I thought my love would shelter you
But I was wrong
I wasn't strong
Instead I lost you
What have they done

Victoria they can't hurt you anymore
Victoria dry your tears for evermore

I know the sun will shine again
And from that special place
In which you now find peace
I want to be
Victoria, Victoria
