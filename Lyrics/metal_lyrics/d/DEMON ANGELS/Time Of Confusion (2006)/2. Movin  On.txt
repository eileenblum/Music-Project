Spend my life livin' in the city
Chasin' dreams never feel the pity
Blame it on the voices in my head
Holdin' on I'm hangin' by a thread

Don't have a thing to show
For all I wish I had done
Maybe I'll wake up soon to find
It's already gone

It's gettin' better, oh! It's gettin' better
Least that's what I tell myself - move on
I need a reason somethin' outa' season
Can't go back I must be movin' on
Movin' on

I took a hit and suddenly the feelin'
Made my world a better place to live in
I couldn't speel I didn't eat for days
I should have died than wake up in disgrace

There has to be more to life than this
When all's said and done
And of I could do it over again
I'd do it all, do it and then some

It's gettin' better, oh! It's gettin' better
Least that's what I tell myself - move on
I need a reason somethin' outa' season
Can't go back I must be movin' on
Movin' on

Gotta change this sinful life

Don't have a thing to show
Far all I wish I had done
And if I could do it over again
I'd do it all, do it an then some

It's gettin' better, oh! It's gettin' better
Least that's what I tell myself - move on
I need a reason somethin' outa' season
Can't go back I must be movin' on
Movin' on
