Something's going on
In a world that's upside down
In think we face another big explosion
It's all over the news
And I've seen those stupid fools
And how they treat those innocent victims

Now you can't go around
With a sword in your hand
Tellin' me you're doin' god's work
And you can't tell me
When you're down on your knees
You still won't go to hell for what it's worth

Freedom - the will to pick and choose
Freedom - no we're not gonna loose our

I think we've lost our vision
To some kind of superstition
It's time for us to set the record straight
We blame it on religion -
The color o our children
We raise them up to know such things as hate

So you can't go around
With a sword in your hand
Tellin' me you're doin' god's work
And you can't tell me
When you're down on your knees
You still won't go to hell for what it's worth

Freedom - the will to pick and choose
Freedom - no we're not gonna loose our

Soon there'll come a day
When the peace we fought so hard for
Wall fall from the lips of every man
And yes it will be worth the blood that we gave for it
Because you're free and only freedom can

So don't you go around
With a sword in your hand
Tellin' me you're doin' god's work
And you can't tell me
When you're down on your knees
You still won't go to hell for what it's worth
