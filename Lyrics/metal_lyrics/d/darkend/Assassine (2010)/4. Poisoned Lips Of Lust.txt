[Marie de Brindvilliers: France, 1665]

Pale mistress lost in grinnin' shadows of pain
A mist breeds sensual perversion
The spirit desire to chase away morality
A flame burns in brilliant eyes

The embrace of death craves her love
Kissing with lips sweetly blushed
A dark shadow of jealousy
Orders fidelity for eternity

Oh father, you must die, I'm not your servant
You confined my love and sold my soul
The poison is boiling to melt your heart
Blessed in this holy, corrupted kingdom
Sweet revenge for my carnal passions
Sublime pleasure for this art

...I was so young when I was raped...

A feeble scream echoes from a distant convent
Sparkles light up candles of pleasure
Incestuous path toward a sinful treason
The chant of cunt resounds everywhere

The embrace of death craves her love
Kissing with lips sweetly blushed
A dark shadow of jealousy
Orders fidelity for eternity

Oh my beloved, now I feel so tired
I must destroy the chains that bind us
As others you'll perish to free my desire
A boundless spirit in this witheless
My soul is painting host of embraces
Submerged and covered with a seminal dress

The embrace of death craves her love
Kissing with lips sweetly blushed
A dark shadow of jealousy
Orders fidelity for eternity

Lethal confessions into the garments of god
A trap of destiny, cruel with blind eyes
Crawling dumb toward an eternal life
The pale white pall covers a sinuous body

Reflexes of solar light are mirroring on the blade
Black hair, blood and delusion wait on the strow
A wish of death symbolize the end of the princess
Wings of white angels burn into the fire of envy
Relic of charm and dedication to the flesh
They fell under her spell in flesh.
