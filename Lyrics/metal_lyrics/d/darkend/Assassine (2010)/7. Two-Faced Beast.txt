[Denise LabbÃ¨: France, 1954]

[Part I:]

Denise, Jacques and the dying Spirit
An angel without wings trampled by his desires
Blinded by deception of an endless and painful love
Bitter tears run down her cheeks so pale, turning to red
The inner deepest agony corrodes heartbeats
...bringing to madness

A silent scream of the dying spirit
Baptized form the cradle to the grave
Life, swept away!
Her image reflected by a ripple mirror
And the hands whose praised a gift of god
Left her heartâ¦ to drown!

The last tempting wish, holding the
hands of her mother
Into the metal-tub, full of water and pain
They went to clean her doll, dirty and worn out
But only one comes back, because the infant
... is dead

She cries for her inconceivable deeds
Detecting reality through his dismal heart

Is this the essence of love? Masochistic passion
on the white skin of her pure body
A shiny knife, it cuts, leaving scars and livids
to fulfill a mental depraved satisfaction
Obsessed by dominion of unaware women's souls

Subdued by the obsession of losing him
Aborting, without tragedy, in the name of deep passion
Disowned, cast away and insulted
An empty shell lost in solitude

Is this the promise of pain? Masochistic passion on the white skin of her pure body
A shiny knife, it cuts, leaving scars and livids to fulfill a mental depraved satisfaction
Love will show me the worst face of the beast

[Part II:]

The voice of Christine
Back to the humid womb once againâ¦
A womb made of bitter water and cold iron walls
It must b my prisonâ¦
A prison for the unborn who once dreamed of life

But here is so dark, so cold, so old
Could eternity be just a humble grave?
All I still feel is the deep, intense pain
The pain of birth and then to come back here again
Againâ¦
Againâ¦
Againâ¦

No more light as my tears melt with water
My lungs filled once more with heavy liquid
For me life was just a sweet dream
As for you death will beâ¦
