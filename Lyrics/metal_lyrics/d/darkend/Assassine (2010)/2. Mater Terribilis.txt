[Catherine Hayes: France, 1675]

A black crystal sphere magically reflects images of cruelty
Witchcraft obsession made up to comfort women dressed with shadows
Shrewd like a demon to capture their lost tormented souls
Looking for a venomous solution to dissolve a dusty cold love
Damsels and lovers are spellbound by the words of the clairvoyant
Secret identities perennially eager to arrive to milady's bolster
She wields their minds behold with impure eyes
Enslaved without torment but ready to obey to her counsels

Slavery for golden possession, kindled the carnage inception
Mystical rituals celebrate by a priest, sacrificing children to the beast
A goblet of blood amid hands raised up toward the sky

Hundred children were killed, bloodbath for filling desire
Beneath the mournful name of god the bishop fell into a pit... of flesh

Venus, your pale skin is prey of demons
Graves overflowing corpses, sexual abomination, madness it's not only for the ancestors
Altars built up to praise the almighty, mounted with skulls, bones and deadly eyes

"Father I summon thy furious gaze upon the mortals
You master this misery, we devote ourselves to the flames of hell
Grant us your blackest wisdom so that we can bring your dominion
Recall demons' legion from the pit with no return...... no return "

A black crystal sphere magically reflects images of cruelty
Witchcraft obsession made up to comfort women dressed with shadows
Shrewd like a demon to capture their lost tormented souls
Looking for a venomous solution to dissolve a dusty cold love

Secret sons born from adultery
Gutted for been melting into potions
Forbidden spells, forbidden dreams
Embody the name of "Majesty"

Slavery for golden possession, kindled the carnage inception
Mystical rituals celebrate by a priest, sacrificing children to the beast

Venus, your pale skin is prey of demons
Graves overflowing corpses, sexual abomination, madness it's not only for the ancestors
Altars built up to praise the almighty, mounted with skulls, bones and deadly eyes

Dragged unto a monumental stake
Burning sparks are flying upwards
Hear the screams from the tongue of evil
A spirit purified by fire.
