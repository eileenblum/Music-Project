[Pauline Parker &amp; Juliet Hulme: New Zeland, 1954]

[Pauline and Juliet:]
We, the nocturnal fogs of Eden
We still remember ages ago
When childish caresses warms our dimension
Lost in dreams
Weird sisters bounded by solitude
With eyes open wide we witnessed
The fall of reality
Silently imploring...

To the ground! To the ground!
To the ground until the worms will feast with her blood
A choir of lesbian angels was delivered from the sky
Covering with ashes the shadow of the whore!
To death! To death!
To death to finally erase her presence from the world
We, the slaying angels, were cast down from the sky
A stone against her head and Mommy was no more!

[Pauline:]
Among the unaware souls of the Lord
I hide my horrible secret
[Juliet:]
Behind novels and tales of fictional murders
Tremble hands and eyes sick to the pain
[Pauline and Juliet:]
Once cursed and doomed in any language

[The Whole Crowd:]
Murderers!
MeurtiÃ¨res!
MÃ¶rderinnen!
Assassine!

[Pauline and Juliet:]
To the ground! To the ground!
To the ground until the worms will feast with her blood
A choir of lesbian angels was delivered from the sky
Covering with ashes the shadow of the whore!
To death! To death!
To death to finally erase her presence from the world
We, the slaying angels, were cast down from the sky
A stone against her head and Mommy was no more!

We, the nocturnal foes of heaven
We still remember ages ago
When with eyes open wide we witnessed
The fall of reality
Violently giving her death!

Cast away never to meet again
My carnal alter ego
[Pauline:]
Juliet, where are you now?
[Juliet:]
Pauline, where are you now?
