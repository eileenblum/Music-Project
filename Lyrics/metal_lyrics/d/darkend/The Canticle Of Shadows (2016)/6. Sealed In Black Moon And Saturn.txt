Saturn, lavish all your pain upon me
For I am ready to bear it!
Thy progenyâs weak, empty and torn
And Iâm a Black Moon, devourer of all.

Gather a funerary crown of nails and locusts
For the still carrion of humankind

So Wormwood, fall once again
Like a torch upon the earth!
While blessed by the shadows, by a wisdom of old
I slip through your blood to spit my cancer in you!

Sealed in Black Moon and Saturn
All weakness and fears are devoured with the sun!
All weakness and fears are devoured with the sun!
Sealed in Black Moon and Saturn
In Fire, by Air, in Water, by Earth

And thus I speak to you, insects:
As you have always obeyed not only in my presence
But so much more in my absence:
Work out your own salvation now, with fear and trembling!
For being yourselves so empty,
I just spoke empty answers to your empty prayers...
And for whatever prayer may come from you,
I will answer according to the Emptiness of man:
May my claws be the deepest knives in your chests!

Bewitching this vacuity
I reject you, I reject you!
With Fire, by Air, with Water, by Earth
Swallowed is the light and upset is the worm
The moon rises black and Saturn it lies reversed

And through infinity I witness
These long dreamed, forbidden caves
The Citadel of the Underworld
With its creepy green lights
Exhalations from the path of the defunct
My blood burns and flickers

Morningstar, there is a reason for the fog that embraces me
Bright Morningstar, thereâs always a reason for the silence thatâs upon me!

My eyesâ¦ my eyes are an Abyss and my tongue is a Sword
Through which everything was meant and felt: Forgive me not!

Sealed in Black Moon and Saturn
All weakness and fears are devoured with the sun!
All weakness and fears are devoured with the sun!

Inside out. Inside out.
