I swear that my grudge will never cease to haunt you
Deep in that palace of filth and larvae where now you dwell,
And there, right on your burial cursed ground
Iâll erect my cathedrals, with pillars of nightshade, of fire and mist!

Ahash, nakh, ahash, nakh

Out, livid headless lustmord, out!
Hidden in these rotten shrouds

Ahash, nakh, ahash, nakh

Hidden in these rotten shrouds
Out, treacherous radiance, out, out!

You are not allowed to roam this halls:
Your presence is forbidden here, leave!
Your claws have withered here.
As a dreadful tremor shake this walls, things cease to move (leave!)
And all seems quiet in the dark, âtil your breath appears.

There is a storm of words carved deep on my very flesh
A deafening silence spoken in letters, five stones of doom
And a burden descended like a perennial dusk:
Sometimes tragedy is engraved right there on the inside
Since birth, tragedy is engraved right here on the inside

Look at the suffocating dirt,
what scars you more?
your halo of worms
or my bleak crown of thorns?

Who is the dead now!
Who is the dead now!
Who is the dead now!
