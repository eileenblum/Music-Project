Fire, thou art the Key
Your Flames I am and my veins you are
And Pain, thou wast the Gate
The first step down leading through narrow clefts
Profound, descent;
From sheer drops to ravines unknown
A torchlit passage to the regions of the Soul
Walked with hunger and Pride

Revived Mountain, with coldness at my side
Revived Drape of the Night, with obscurity and stars inside

Revived Subversive Nazarene
Extracting nails from scarred flesh divine
Hammering them deep down
Right to your hearts, mothers of mankind
Emptiness and vacuity
And treason and lie
These are the names in which you hide
This is the vacuum you carry with pride

Your privileges are broken in here
A precipice towards abyssal caves

Baptized in whirling streams of ever-flowing strength
Waters and vapors to guide me through
My path is self-chosen
My hurt is self-chosen
My curse is self- chosen

Witchcraft Sun, rain on me!

Embalming crimson mist with seething shades as wings
Pillars and dead eyes from far beyond
My loss is self-chosen
My grief is self-chosen
My soar is self-chosen

Witchcraft Sun, rain on me!
Cold scarring Sun, shine on!

For I roamed the barren lands of the Elsewhere in eons unknown to men
And from its dense darkness I brought back everlasting Flames
With the power to enlighten you
Or to incinerate you.
