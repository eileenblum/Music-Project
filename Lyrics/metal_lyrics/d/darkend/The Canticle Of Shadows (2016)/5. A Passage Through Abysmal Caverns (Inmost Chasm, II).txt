Ashes through ashes, scattering dust of red agonies ashen
My wounds are opened now! My gates are opened now!
From towers ablaze I erect and exalt my black throne, there above you all
Broken and broken! Your knowledge is broken, your hidings are broken!

Your treasures, your abundance are now mutated into frozen lava and plague!

Which whisper my names:
Comet Doom! Comet Fire!
Comet Doom! Comet Fire!
Whisper my names:
Comet Doom! Comet Fire!
Comet Doom! Comet Fire!

Your treasures, your abundance are now mutated into frozen lava and plague!

My limbs are the branches of nature itself
with a touch of perdition, bathed in sorrow
Here I became Death, and Death is the seed from which I growâ¦

HYSHEA MâSHEE-HU REKDA'DN
KAA DAHUA-JI ROO-KHAA LI-SHERVA
SHIMMETH, OâRORAB-TAHAN!	
SHIMMETH, HO DâKHIL-HAN!

My witching essence embodies the Funeral March for all your empty lives!

Shaman chant for the Sun!
Shaman chant for the Dark!
Shaman chant for the Sun!
Shaman chant for the Dark!

Further on, further on, above and beneath, through the storm, further on!
My gates are opened now! My wounds are opened now!
Here I return to dig up from the clay all the nails, all the teeth, all the bones buried down
All in one, one in all, as dawn clinches dusk: all in one, one in all

HYSHEA MâSHEE-HU REKDA'DN

Near these cenotaphs austere and deformed
Named as mourning and pain
Whisper my namesâ¦

Comet Doom! Comet Fire!
Comet Doom! Comet Fire!
Here I call to thee!
Here I bathe in thee!
As I traverse this spectral vale
Bounded by night-spells
An enshrouding mist
Engulfed by the wind
By the wind of the seas
A glimpse of purity
Like roots to branches
And by 7 steps of Winter
I am whole again
Comet Doom! Comet Fire!
Comet Doom! Comet Fire!

There in your mortal world I cannot be reached
For I dwell among the undead
For I dwell among the ghosts of dreams
Closer than usual to the heart of Creation
And yet so far awayâ¦

Every drop of blood and every forlorn tear
Returns to my very essence
Through the beads of this crimson fog
Surrounding me, inhaling me!
Surrounding me, inhaling me!

HYSHEA MâSHEE-HU REKDA'DN
KAA DAHUA-JI LI-SHERVA ROO-KHAA
SHIMMETH, OâRORAB-TAHAN!	
SHIMMETH, HO DâKHIL-TAHAN!

My witching essence embodies the Funeral March for all your empty lives!

Shaman rise with the Sun!
Shaman rise with the Dark!
Shaman chant for the Sun!
Shaman chant for the Dark!
