Here, I can still feel this dreary pain
Here, a malady serum fills every vein
Sad birthgiver of endings
That petrified body with 16 bleeding mouths
Is it still me?
Is it still me?

All senses pierced by anguish and woe
From the inside, from the outside
From grieving shades crying at me
âWhere have you gone?â
âWhere are you now?â

In the warm fumes spread by my own dead mutilated flesh
It is there that I am now!
In that moment in time, when my soul was torn apart
It is there that I am now!

Death! Here sorrow has eyes and wings
And it brings more pain and death!
Death! Here time is rotten and still
Hereâs just reiteration and death!

And hereâ¦ here thereâs no flame to cast a shadow of me
Now, in this maze of poignant perdition, that shadow is me

And with every step it takes, in anger and fear abhorrent
It leads you to the funeral, to the grave, to the interment

To the interment!
To the interment!
To the interment!

Burn the past to ashes, bury the past with scorn
Where trees have taken vows of silence
And leaves are stillborn
Under that misty, humid cemetery soil
In velvet and in ebony, in silent caducity

Lead the grand hearse, carve an earthly womb
To entomb this aberration
Crippled and refused
Within deep layers of nightly profane dirt
A secret is withheld, in darkness itâs withheld!

Death! Here sorrow has eyes and wings
And it brings more fear and death!
Death! Hereâs just reiteration and deathâ¦

And here, blades and worms still opening wounds
fattening the conquering beast
Do you think that I am made for resting in peace?

This place... this place is terrible.
