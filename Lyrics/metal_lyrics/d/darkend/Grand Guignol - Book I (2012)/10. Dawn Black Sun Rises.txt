And now that everything is swathed by silence
A new magic will be created to inhale
The arcane lost voice
And the formless wisdom
Of what is dead and forgotten

Decrepitude is the seed of resurrection
Through which a new cosmos will be melted
Leave mortality, erase the supreme fault
Rapture and wonder are born

Fluid spheres of atoms, chaos DNA
Bodies dissolve in formless entities
Alchemy divine breeds spirit-worlds
Concentric involution of souls

Programming and calculating
Indoctrination through a lucid dismay
Reason evokes spirit, spirit evokes flesh
A final artefact, complete!

A parallel beginning, a light of the black
Enchants the oscillating circle
Mutation in a self-desired apocalypse
Sacred trinity revealed again

To the deep core I invoked all the spiders
All the pains and a crown of thorns...

Black
Twelve-rayed sun
Rises!
Black
Twelve-rayed sun
Rises!

It dawns!

To the deep core I invoked all the spiders
All the pains and a crown of thorns...
And after all the impure light
A black sunâ¦
It dawns!

Buried away
After 3 day and 3 thousand years
He shines againâ¦

Flebile lucentezza immemore
Del terrore in eterno custodito
Tra spirali di tempesta
Riemerge la memoria
Arcaica legione strisciante
Tra le negate cripte del tempo

From far away it shinesâ¦

From distant skies
Of blackened light you dredge
Divine exhumed crystals
Shattered and endless
Vanished and rose again

Nebbiose profonditÃ  remote,
Tra cunicoli e catacombe
Sâerge il baratro
Dellâumana pazzia

Stracci di pioggia, lembi di vento
Adornan il Dio rifiutato
Che funesto volteggia
Su rovine sepolte;
Preghiere proibite ed urla spettrali
Tra ombre di valli senza nome
Nascoste e obliate

On the starless dimension of the obstructed soul
Fleshy pendulums eternally oscillate
Between the sanctity of sin, the impiety of purity
Not knowing the secret of stillness
Not knowing theyâre only moving through mirrors

Decrepitude, it sown resurrection
Through which the cosmos has been melted
Without mortality, without the supreme fault
Rapture and wonder here grown

Fluid spheres of atoms, chaos DNA
Bodies dissolved in formless entities
Alchemy divine in this spirit-worlds
Concentric involution of souls

A great uproar, a shrieking lament
A desert shaken by the abyss
Austere on the pinnacle of emptiness
The eternal mantle spreads out

On the pinnacle of emptiness
The eternal mantle spreads out

Black
Twelve-rayed sun
Rises!
Black
Twelve-rayed sun
Rises!
Black
Twelve-rayed sun
Rises!
Black
Twelve-rayed sunâ¦

It dawns!

I wear the nails of Jesus
And all the universeâs wonders...

Yet I am murder and rape
And premature putrefaction
I walk with coldness and lie
In the horrible thunder of insectsâ¦

Deep down insideâ¦
Deep down insideâ¦
