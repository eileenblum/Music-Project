So we carved inside high nothingness
Melting it with a paradox of opposites
So we feed the blue chasm of oblivion
And drawn there new life from obscurity
So we carved inside high fullness
Binding it with an archetype of heresy
So we drank from the fountain of time
And mould there the essence of theology

For the great abstraction of silence
For the high flatness of man
It sharpened deep wide this blade
And it wonât hide forgiveness
For the holy priesthood of silence
For the highest reason of pain
Sharpened deep wide this blade
And it wonât hide forgiveness

This is the advent of the flames that lie within
This is a loyal declaration of sin

Dona eis, rex tremendae maiestatis, morte Ã¦terna
In die illa irÃ¦, coeli movendi sunt et terra
War is a cowardice of the soul!
Peace is a cowardice of the soul!

Inner stormâ¦ deflagrate!

These wounds wide open
And that light of humid mist
I will vomit upon youâ¦
I will vomit upon you all!

So we spread outside high, pure instinct
Clashing it with a weak rationality
So we crossed the seas of hellâs fire
And then unveiled the true iniquity
So we damned the (un)nature of man
Walking down the path of divinities
So we drank from the fountain of being
And drown there the shroud of humanity

For the great abstraction of silence
For the high flatness of man
It sharpened deep wide this blade
And it wonât hide forgiveness
For the holy priesthood of silence
For the highest reason of pain
Sharpened deep wide this blade
Breeding againâ¦

The fierce massive slaying grandeur
The fierce massive slaying grandeur

[THE OBSCURE FLASHFORWARD POINTS HERE]

Your war is a cowardice of the soul!
Your peace is a cowardice of the soul!

Get away from me, beast of the earth!
Be one with me, beast of the earth!

Son of the light, son of the dark
Every time they die within you!
For the great inner sea is raging again
And who shall be able to stand?

To stand!

Dona eis, rex tremendae maiestatis, morte Ã¦terna
Dona eis, rex tremendae maiestatis, morte Ã¦terna
