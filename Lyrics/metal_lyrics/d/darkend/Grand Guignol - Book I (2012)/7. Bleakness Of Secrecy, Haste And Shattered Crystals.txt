This is a proud march towards the arcane life-force to come
Through occult secrecy and haste
Through shattered crystals without a face
Since damnation wears the wings of lost remembrances
For the long gone suffering lies beneath the deepest of seas

And nothing else there
Then would be granted to you
No more!
But to embrace
The light of truth
The bitter guilt of abandonment

Lost ancient ruins, an invoked gale of crimson sand
The dryness of eons past burns your mouth

For every mourned departure
Breeds some pain
And a sad rancorous ghost
Hence, you, horrible shadow
The trail is cast
For you to walk the arc of space and time

In the idea of virtue
In the idea of sin
Lies my domination over all men!

From the rope end dangles a traitor
On the cross lies a saint
What discern a miracle from profound abomination
When theyâre both thrown away in the jaws of oblivion?

What is left to humanity?
When the spirit go astray
What is left to free will?
When all shades are gray

The path of the chosen few is paved with innocence
And with anger, wrath and fury!

Beware of you, Pharisees!
Your mask of righteousness hides a secret inner world
Of ungodly thoughts and feelings!

You were full of wickedness
You were like whitewashed tombs
Beautiful on the outside
But full of dead men's bones

Like sand they are...

In the idea of virtue
In the idea of sin
Lies my domination
In the idea of virtue
In the idea of sin
Lies my domination over all men!
