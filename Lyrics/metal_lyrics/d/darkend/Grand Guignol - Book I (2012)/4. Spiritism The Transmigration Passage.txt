Ring the bell!

Wrapped in black ruins
Lost among grey, solemn tombs
Storming and witching my cadaveric sleep
For all of the sudden
The abyss spreads its fangs
And the pale light is soon devoured!

Whisper to me of your dead Necropolis...
Oh putrefaction adorn me again
Obscene and magnificent in all its forms

Wrapped a vapor
Once born of fog and virtue
Infesting and blessing these Stigmata plagues
A failing shade embracing
My shadow long denied
Ancient and feared: thundering Golgotha

Silently breed and then sing to me
Of the thorns, the pain and its horrors... once again

Soul! Fire! Nails and Darkness!
Soul! Fire! Nails and Darkness!

Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine;
In memoria aeterna erit iustus
Ab auditione mala non timebit.
Absolve Domine animas
Omnium fidelium defunctorum
Ob omno vinculo delictorum
Et gratia tua illis succurente
Mereantur evadere iudicium ultionis,
Et lucis aeternae beatitudine perfrui
Tuba mirum spargens sonum
Per sepulchra regionum,
Coget omnes ante thronum.

Wrapped in black ruins
Lost among grey, solemn tombs
Storming and witching my cadaveric sleep
And there stood the abyss
With is mouth open wide
Devouring, relentless, devouring!
Whisper to me, of your dead Necropolis
Obscene... And sleep... and sleep!
While you became your own tomb!

Soul! Fire! Nails and Darkness!
Soul! Fire! Nails and Darkness!

A thousand psalms of penitence
To wash away this rust from your nails
But I know too well the nature of man
To ignore that often the offended forgive
While the offender never do it
Behold! Highest spirits, behold!
So much has been told about the first stone
But what about the last?
And he, who will be able to throw it?
Behold! Highest spirits, behold!
So much has been told about the first stone!
