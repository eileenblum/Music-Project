Twilight hides itself
Beneath the waves
Of a bright impending darkness
Oblivious of every life,
Of every hasty death
Beholder of our nothingness

Ten thousand holy spirits
Melted in a liquid structure
Ever changing shape and brightness
Ten thousand demons
A blasphemy from heaven
Sneering through clouds and glowing dimness

And then silence swathed all
And then silence swathed allâ¦

What we inherit from the past
Your shade upon the soul
Opening wounds
A dreary light of humid mist
Taking breaths away
And yet you still here

Along our divine pathway... crawling!

A dreary mist of humid light
Opening wounds...

And yet you still here...

Deceitful theatre of corridors
A shadowplay!
Where we are and we are not
With sins of flesh
Laid upon a wooden cross
To cheat the symmetry divine
But when the wounded one
Gains the aureole of night
A plague will be unleashed upon me:

A dumb progeny
So that its shame
Cannot be told

Repudiating earth, the sky, the seas
And the whispers beneath everything
Building rules and ruined temples
And soon the third eye was... no more

What we inherit from the past
Your shade upon the soul
Opening wounds
A dreary light of humid mist
Taking breaths away
You, the labyrinth, you still here

Along our divine pathway... bleeding!

What we inherit from the past
Your shade upon the soul
Opening wounds
A dreary mist of humid light
Taking breaths away
Still opening wounds!

Am I there with you?
