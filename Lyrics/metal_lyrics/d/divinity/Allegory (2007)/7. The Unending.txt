Not much of a mind
Feeding, extracting

Instead of forgiving

Wicked victim this time

End (Always, never ending)
Wars (killing, blood spilling)
In all beginnings arise the unending
A fatal mistake, to steal a breath of air

Sequence the drifting lies
Millions of people all in your way
Take it or give it or turn your back now
These are your choices
Unending

Lost in a dream
Of foresight
Of the perfect portrait and reveals to all
The moment of our inexistence
Open your eyes
Awake and alive
