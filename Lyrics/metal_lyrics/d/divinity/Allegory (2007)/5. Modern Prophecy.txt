Bound by laws consistent as gravity
Thrown into a spiraling nightmare
Decide: an evolution's desire
or bow your head to Erebus rapture

One by one, exalted
Face the truth, we are one

To become the new state of life
Mimic the function of nature divine
Endless information, knowledge of creation
Bought with the re-introduction; the start
The birth of full circle life
Lost forever, the exploitation of design

One by one
Face the truth, we are one

Enter the obscene sight
No doubt of origin
Matter defines
As negative
Destruction
Who are we
Where do we belong

One by one
Face the truth, we are one
