Watch me fuck a parasite
With friction comes disease
Further spreading a race within
Running rampant, taken out like yesterday's trash
Bone rotted, forgotten
You see, the naked eye is blind to the flowing sickness entity

Sink your teeth in
Tear your heart out
Share the plasma
Congenital

When you let it inside
When you let it decide
What you see in the night
What you wanted in time

And the moment passes by

By the point of no return
It comes in

Dark shadows, black passage
Mutation, all the same
Extinction, expansion
Eat the weak, I have no name

You Sell your soul and spread it thin
My skin crawls when I can't see you
My blood knows that I don't need you
I bleed for mine and you sell your soul

You're just meat for the beast
Absorb me through your slit, Whore
Secrete the secret substance abuse bouquet
Suck my mucus membrane
Embrace the living mess
I must confess, I howl at the moon and slay the night too

Share the plasma
Touch me now

Touch, Torn
Epidemic is born
Try to survive
Touch me now

You Sell your soul and spread it thin no matter what it takes
My skin crawls when I can't see you
My blood knows that I don't need you
I bleed for mine and you sell your soul
