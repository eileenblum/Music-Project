Obsessed with control

Give me your word with staring eyes
Speak now, but only of the painful truth
Show me your worth with a patient mind
These virtues diminish, forgotten in time

Take it all away!

I will stand the test of time.
You choose to swallow (your despair)
Soon, your falling sands run out
We've seen it all blown away, swept away
Unknown fears power control
Power control

We the people, living in your consequences
First come, first serve. Get back in line
It only counts when it hurts the most
To err is human, to forgive divine

Take it all away!

Victims of chaos
Holding darkness so strong

All your fears power control
Take it all away
