Tyranny of the unconscious mind
of the mind

Signify, the demagogue will ratify
Tyrannize every conscious desire
Submissive slaves living inside us all

Feel the inferior find its resolute
Disassociate

Neurotyrant, you've seen better days
Neurotyrant, now you can see the bitter end

Psycho soars to the sun on wings of madness
Fear is blind and ignorant
Stroking purification, no mind, no matter
Ignorance is bliss

Left alone
All alone
Turn to stone
Born into oblivion
