Set like the sun
Inevitable decay
Dynasty devoured
Once revealed, one severe
Ever expanding massacre

From the sick remains
I scream for this life that I forsake
Infect the viral strain.
Everyday countless cells will die
Hurry to take their place
A life long disease. Eradicate
Genetic viruliferous insides

No trace of light
Just selfless insight
Crashing through the line

Dissect then infiltrate the desire
Forwarding design
Suffer the consequence
Even with a cure there is no time
Alone, this parasite, given all of paradise
Continual overload
Red lines inside my eyes explode

Strain

Inside
