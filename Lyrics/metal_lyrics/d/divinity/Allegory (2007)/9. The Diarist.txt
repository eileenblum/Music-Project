Relentlessly, skip past the black stains of yesterday
Push through the pages of that've plagued my mind
My reflection: a shadowed solitude
A stranger in my own home

Enraged
I'm strangled
I read through the lines
Begging to find
One answer decides
Dear Diary, I've lied

rip it apart, before it sets into consciousness
surrounded by the thought of "becoming"
My deception: empty reflection
traveling all alone

Enraged
I'm strangled
I read through the lines
Begging to find
One answer decides

Dear Diary, I've lied (to all)
I've cried (for none)
I swear (to you)
I swear I'll burn you alive

I swear (to you)
I swear I'll burn you alive
