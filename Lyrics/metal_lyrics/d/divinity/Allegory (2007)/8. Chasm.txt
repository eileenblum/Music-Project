Feeling the human condition
Alone and misunderstood
In the Darkness
Falling

Choking on the passion. Choke!
Erase past evidence
Destroy the thought of righteousness

In all your time
Do not define or find

Just when you think
You built up the foundation
It falls out from under you
Do not define the chasm

Come into the scenery
Take it all twisted and turning
I'm burning
Lost inside a solitary life
From the depths of mankind

Step into the scenery
Take it all twisted

Cycle. Breath the law. My eyes
If you could only see through my eyes
Burning inside. Forever in time

Do not define
Do not - Define - Chasm
