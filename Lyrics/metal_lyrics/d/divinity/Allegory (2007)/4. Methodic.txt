Another forgotten melody
Without a search for harmony
A set out sign that its all
All to systematic!

Methodize my dreams into categories
Short lived stories
Lost

Chromatic slow progression
Out of reach destiny
Don't you ever deny what's inside
or what you see

System denied

The electric. The pain becomes erotic
Methodic. the War becomes genocide
