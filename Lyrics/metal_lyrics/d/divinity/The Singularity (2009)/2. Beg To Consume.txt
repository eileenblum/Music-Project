Buy

Buy and sell lies
Shuffle with the other sheep
Swiping cards to survive

Rats to the slaughter walking blind
Awake but not alive inside
Obsolescence is conceived
Acceptable losses to the minority elite

Pounds of flesh tolls to be paid
No one escapes
Timely distractions from what's real

Getting owned by what we owe
Following the trend to spend it all

Beg to consume
Leave empty headed
Slow and deliberately divided
Claws bury deeper in you pocket

Palaces built on the bones of temptation
In the distance untouchable irresponsible
City skin shines wetly and breathing
Like an insect feeding on moral blood

Pleasure sick, temporary pain kill
Barely treading water bloated and spent

Getting owned by what we owe
Following the trend to spend it all

Beg to consume
Leave empty headed
Slow and deliberately divided
Claws bury deeper in you pocket

Leave paradise behind
Climbing a high rise
Respond to Stimuli
Bell rings exit tube
Spiritual suicide

Getting owned by what we owe
Following the trend
End of the lifeline

Hanging by the end of the lifeline
