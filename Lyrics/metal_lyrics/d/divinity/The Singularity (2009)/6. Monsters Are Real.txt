Blind to invisible men, the culprit moves in
Sadistic lust offender
Voyeur to torture, His path is all laid out
He must evict them from their bodies
Abduction ignites, skin-to-skin contact
Physical addiction,
Serial pattern, unaware of right and wrong
The hedonistic monstrosity evolves

Stress is the trigger, tension pulls
Perfect madness under the skin
Living the fantasy In a homicidal reality

Told to ignore
Inside us all
Demons you feel
Monster of invisible
Anger
Recitation
Stolen lives

Missing pieces
Lost within itself
Schizophrenic
Visionary

Found not guilty by reason of insanity
Disease of the mind is proven

With lack of evidence I commute his
Death sentence

Stress is the trigger, tension pulls
Perfect madness under the skin
Living the fantasy
In a homicidal reality

Told to ignore
Inside us all
Demons you feel
Monster of invisible
Anger excitation
Stolen
Lives

Free to kill again

Blind to invisible men, the culprit moves in
Sadistic lust offender
Voyeur to torture, His path is all laid out
