Fate is a form of fiction
Breaking norms involves extreme sacrifice
Always for a greater good
A metaphor existing only in one soul
Manipulates like-matter

And the man
Sick of inquisition
Bides his time accordingly

What would possess this man?

Embrace the uncertain
As premonitions beckon coincidence
As premonitions beckon
Wait for your time to come

So uncertain
Draw me perspective
So uncertain

Hate is a form of addiction
Breaking norms involves extreme sacrifice
Always for a greater good
A metaphor existing only in one soul
Manipulates like-matter

Still the man
Sick of inquisition
Bides his time accordingly

Deeper than my eyes, deeper than my flesh
Deeper than my bones

Fate is a form of fiction
Breaking norms involves extreme sacrifice
Always for a greater good
