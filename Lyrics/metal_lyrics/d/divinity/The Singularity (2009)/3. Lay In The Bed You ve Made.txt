You made this in the first place
Facing today with untold conviction
Through the motions, through the pauses
The bed goes unmade

I now know the way
The precedent, obey

Dark thoughts flow inside my head
Shrouding the sunlight within

Lay in the bed you've made
My mind is cast into shadow
Face the mistake you've made
Living the consequence
Sleeping through life
Self help is defeating

Waking from another nightmare
Humanity is dreaming
Wake up to restart from nothing

You made this in the first place
Facing today with untold conviction
Through the motions, through the pauses
