Break the habit that changes billions of lives
Gaining momentum, constant evolving
Nothing of static, choose pulse over passive

Darkened by the wear of ordinance
Charred dead forest, burned, finding rejuvenation
Bold, total determination
To take it all from you
To take it all from you
Formless dimension
Signature thought, advanced intuition

Freak of nature, my loving companion
Extreme shift in ambient surrounding

Darkened by the wear of ordinance
Charred dead forest, burned, finding rejuvenation
Bold, total determination
To take it all from you
To take it all from you
Formless dimension
Signature thought, advanced intuition

Ready to fall
Focus your demise
Find the pulse inside the earth
Don't fear your chosen path
Receiving the signal
Finding the pulse inside the earth

Break the habit that changes billions of lives
Gaining momentum, constant evolving
Nothing of static, choose pulse over passive
