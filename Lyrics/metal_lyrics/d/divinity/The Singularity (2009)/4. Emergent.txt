Living life to find one self
All knowing of a stronger society
A symbiotic relationship
Inside the emergent reality
Geo-thermal energy lasting millenniums
World resource based economy

No utopia, impossible to have perfection
To be wrong is to be enlightened of greater knowledge

Tribe I am (underground)
Awaken the right side of the mind
Earth is changing
Adapt, align

Taking control from a man-made myth
This catastrophic system creates
abhorrent behavior
man versus himself, the final battle
The fall into history
Time is speeding up

Tribe I am (underground)
Awaken the right side of the mind
Earth is changing
Adapt, align

Rise to respond

As the shifting poles create new worlds
With no war, with no protest, just the
Struggle from within to find one self

Seven levels of power to channel
Will you survive this or follow the blinded?

Rise to respond

Living life to find one self
All knowing of a stronger society
A symbiotic relationship
