We travel the darkest age
Another precession towards
Dark energy dominance
The seasons ever changing
To an observer it is obvious
Living inside the anomalies of attraction
Monolithic infiltration
Fluid motions of the celestial sun
Looking back with superior eyes

Then hidden among the stars...

Transformation (purify)
Purify, follow me (under)
To the end of the age (follow me)
To the end of the age (deep within)
The sound of your thoughts
The sound of a whisper (deep within)
Break silence the size of a mountain
Follow me under
To the end of the age

Darkness with shorter days
Constant struggles of momentum
You decide between the powers of passion
Integrated changes and patterns
Forces of nature destabilized

Curse of the rains
Destroy
The destroying months
Born in fire
Dark ages rise

We travel the darkest age
Another precession towards
Dark energy dominance
