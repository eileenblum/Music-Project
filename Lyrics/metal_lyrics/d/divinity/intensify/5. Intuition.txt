Awaken to this mist of mind
I'm not asleep, I'm not alive

[Solo: James Duncan]

I felt pain
I lived death
I brought forth a new life
Why was I so cold?
Could this be Hell?
Am I just living again?

I broke through
I now see
I set forth to discover..
Somehow you know,
but still you doubt that
I'm just living again.

This is not what I thought it'd be
Dry your tears, don't cry for me.
Left this world, I'm only gone for now.

I am more than nothing.

You look deep
Inside of me
You remember, you find the key
Know that I am forever
Inside your heart.
I'm just living again.

This message can not be explained, it comes from a place within.
I know this can only be intuition.
