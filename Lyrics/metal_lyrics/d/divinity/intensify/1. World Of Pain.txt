Less and Less for me, exponentially
Push and shove your way (it comes your way)
More and more for you, the poison sucks it through
Blinded by the light (darkness insight)
Disconnect the source, set it off its course
Point your blame today (but don't look my way)

Is this all for me? or is this all for you?
Is this all for... me?

...and I see it coming down...
as if it was supposed to...

All I can be in this world of pain;
Suffering in my own way

Everyday a lie, living just to die
Aren't you feeling fine (breaks your mind)
Hardened war machine, sets the blackened scene
Fighting for today (force the retreat)
Leave the crumbling world, bring about the change
mourning winds they say (don't look my way)

Rush inside, see what subsides in you
All I can be... suffering
