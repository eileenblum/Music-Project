Your fate will be just as the millions beforeyou ash to ashes
A LITTLE CYANIDE GOES A LONG WAY A LONG LONGWAY
HALF A MILLION DEAD EVERY YEAR EVERY YEAR
I have seen the struggle, I have seen themdie, I watch you die every day, every day!
Where is your power? Who took your power? You are all weak.
Where is your power? Who took your power? You are all dying.
I have no sympathy for you Tied to a fuckingstick, WATCH IT BURN!
Inhale, exhale, whatever it takes for a fix!
You want it, you need it, whatever it takes!
TO THINK THAT UNCLE SAM PROFITS FROM YOUR SUICIDES!
GIVE ME A KNIFE AND I WILL KILL YOU FOR LESS!
Your fate will be just as the millions beforeyou ash to ashes
A LITTLE CYANIDE GOES A LONG WAY A LONG WAY
The weak die years before their time on their knees praying, pleading for one last hit
Taking their fix to the grave, to the grave,to the grave
The weak die years before their time, on their knees
Pleading for one last fix as I go to thegrave
One more than I'll die, One more than I'lldie today
MORE YOUTH MORE DEATH
IN THE EYES OF MARLBORO MAN!
MORE DEATH MORE PROFIT
MISOCAPNIC
MORE YOUTH MORE DEATH
IN THE EYES OF MARLBORO MAN!
MORE DEATH MORE PROFIT
MISOCAPNIC
One more time
Your fate will be just as the millions beforeyou ash to ashes a little cyanide goes a long way a long way
A long long way!
Trading lives for government funds is where I'd like to be
The problem is clear your death's are forgain!
For gain!
