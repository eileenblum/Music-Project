Drawn in shadows
Watching, waiting, absorbing you, absorbingyou, absorbing you but you'll never know!
I belong to the dark, I exist in the dark
Hidden by a veil of nothingness Veiled by nothingness
I WAS BORN ALONE AND I'LL DIE ALONE
Grasping for signs of life Confined by a mental hell
LIVING IN A BURNING HELL
Watching, waiting, absorbing you, absorbingyou
Someday I will lay my hand upon you
And you will scream my name SCREAM MY NAME
Someday I will lay my hand down upon you
And you will scream my name
I AM THE DEVIL A PERFECT CIRCLE
I AM THE DEVIL A PERFECT CIRCLE
BURN!!
Watching, waiting, I was born alone and I'lldie alone
I WAS BORN ALONE AND I'LL DIE ALONE
I WAS BORN ALONE AND I'LL DIE ALONE
I WAS BORN ALONE AND I'LL DIE ALONE
I WAS BORN ALONE AND I'LL DIE DIE DIE
Man is flawed, man is weak, destiny is to proceed
Rat shall rise, snake will shine, beasts inheritthe earth
Only death, only hate, only death!
I AM THE DEVIL A PERFECT CIRCLE
I WAS BORN ALONE AND I'LL DIE ALONE
I WAS BORN ALONE AND I'LL DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE
