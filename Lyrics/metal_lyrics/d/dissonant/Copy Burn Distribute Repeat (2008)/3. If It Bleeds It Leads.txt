Everybody panic there's a bomb in thebackyard
Everybody run we're going green to red
Just make time for the ballot box
Scariest face wins again our way of life is threatened
How many times have you been stabbed, robbed,or beaten in South Central?
Did you stock up on sheeting and duct tapefor the big meltdown?
Your mind is under a control a power fueled by your insecurities
In-between hope and fear
KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE TV SCREEN
KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE TV SCREEN
IF IT BLEEDS IT LEADS
IF IT BLEEDS IT LEADS
We are tying the noose around our necks
Out of fear for what happens next
In front of our big screen WE SLIT OUR WRISTS
FOR A LOSS THAT DOESN'T EXIST
Politics and lunatics channel the airwavesfor their issues
In front of our big screen
Exploiting a mass ignorance is what they choose to
In front of our big screen
In-between hope and fear
It is so unclear Your perception of reality is shown through a three foot box
We're all on red alert we are buying intofear
The media's going platinum THE PRESIDENT'SGOING PLATINUM
We're all on red alert we are buying intofear
The media's going platinum THEPRESIDENT"S ALREADY PLATINUM
In front of our big screen In front of ourbig screen
IF IT BLEEDS IT LEADS

Politics and lunatics channel the airwavesfor their issues
In front of our big screen
Exploiting a mass ignorance is what theychoose too
In front of our big screen
