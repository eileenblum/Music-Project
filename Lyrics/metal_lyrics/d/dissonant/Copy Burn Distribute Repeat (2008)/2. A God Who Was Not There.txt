Drunk with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus
She rides the sky with Goddamning Luceferi
Coaxing the weak with legs spread and warmblood
She exposes alluring pagans and sinner saints
Let's own these God forsaken days
The whore of Babylon takes Belial under thecross tonight
We shall let the dead feast on all opposed
We shall dethrone the holy one
THE WAR HAS BEGUN
The apostasy of faith
I look to the sky but the sky is empty
I hold out my hand to feel nothing at all
We walk into the light
The light
I watch heaven burn I witness the fall of immortality
Weak minds fallen angels
You shall see the light
APOSTASY
To the weak I give my strength
To the blind I give my eyes
I look to the sky but the sky is empty
I hold out my hand to feel nothing at all
We walk into the light
The light
To stop the holy we bore it to its rest
Its turning dark now one chance to confess
To stop the holy we bore it to its rest
Its turning dark now one chance to confess
CONFESS
