A loss of power, a controlling mind
A broken home, what the fuck do you call home?
I control, criticize, judge, blame, questioneveryone including me
But I will overcome this battle ends with me
IT'S POWER!!
This battle ends with me
IT'S POWER!!
My will is stronger, I will not break
Unlike you, I WANT A FUCKING HOME
I control, criticize, judge, blame, questioneveryone including me
But I will overcome this battle ends with me
IT'S POWER (this battle ends with me) IT'SPOWER
Now you know how not to act (I've shoulderedyour burden)
Now you know how not to act (The guilt turnson you)
An old, lonely man, where is your family?
What do you call home?
WHAT DO YOU CALL HOME?
ABANDON GOD ABANDON FAITH ABANDON US NOTHINGHAS CHANGED
For years I've lived under a false sense of hope believing we were as one
Now I see the truth now I have a sense of what happened
I FEEL THIS ROPE IS LOSING STRENGTH ITS POWERITS CONTROL ITS COWARDLY!
YOU ARE A COWARD AND ALWAYS WILL BE!
I was oblivious to your actions, your faults are not mine
An old, lonely man, where is your family,what do you call home?
WHAT DO YOU CALL HOME?
WHAT DO YOU CALL HOME?
WHAT DO YOU CALL HOME?
WHAT DO YOU CALL HOME?
Abandon God Abandon Faith Abandon Us NOTHINGHAS CHANGED
Now you know how not to act (I've shouldered your burden)
