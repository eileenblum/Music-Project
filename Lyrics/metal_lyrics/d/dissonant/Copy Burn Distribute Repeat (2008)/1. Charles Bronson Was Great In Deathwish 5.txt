PREPARE FOR DEATH
It's blood on my hands Detest your face take me for a fool once more
Fuck that In time your blood will dry coldcold in time
Look at all the dead Look at all these deadthings
Try to see them rise see them Come to lifeand kill you
Nail the coffin shut now
If your still rising your pride's the fault (Don't try to fight)
Eternal rising (Your suicide)
In the blackened remains of a hollowexistence
An empty soul
A funeral song for
A funeral song for blood
It calls out your name
It calls for you demise CARVED OUT EYES
Death resides behind
If your still rising your pride's the fault (Don't try to fight)
Eternal rising (Your suicide)
In the blackened remains of a hollowexistence an empty soul
Age of the restless Death is contagious
Age of the restless Death is contagious
We kill at the dawn of dusk We kill yourdreams of lust
DIE!
It's blood on my hands Detest your face take me for a fool once more
You motherfucker! In time your blood will drycold cold
In time your blood will dry!
