Tonight I reek of sorrow and alcohol
I've lost my only friend the cold steelcomforts me
I am in control bury my head full of miseryWITH A SINGLE BLAST!
As I rest in my grave, six feet of solace, I am almost complete, the cold steel comforts
As I rest in my grave, six feet of solace
I'm living underground, I've lost my onlyself, I'VE REDEFINED MYSELF INTO A FUCKER
As I rest in my grave, six feet of solace, I am almost complete, the cold steel comforts
I am almost complete, the cold steel comforts
IT'S MY HEART
Six feet of solace
FORSAKEN
I bless myself, I've chosen myself to corruptyour bliss, to bring you down
I bless myself, I, I've chosen myself to corrupt your bliss, to bring you down here with me
I WILL BE THERE IN YOUR DREAMS I WILL HAUNTYOU AS YOU SLEEP
REMEMBER ME YOU ARE MINE
Look over your shoulders, hold each others hands
I've been reborn and you'll die soon
I bless myself, I've chosen myself to corruptyour bliss
To bring you down
I, bless myself I, I've chosen myself, to corrupt your bliss to bring you down here with me
I am almost complete the cold steel comforts
IT'S MY HEART
Six feet of solace
FORSAKEN!!
