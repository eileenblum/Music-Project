I hear them above me ITS CATALEPSY
Lost in the reveries of death I speak of worms, tombs and epitaphs
Oppression of the lungs Blackened, darknessstill consumes me
BUT MY VEINS STILL FLOW BUT MY VEINS STILLFLOW
Suffocation 'till the death!
Calamity, atrocity, urgency, murdering me
IF ONLY I COULD GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
Choking on the stench of my own decay
Worms festering in this skin Trapped in thesoil six feet under
I feel my end draws near
BUT MY VEINS STILL FLOW BUT MY VEINS STILLFLOW
Suffocation 'till the death!
Calamity, atrocity, urgency, murdering me
IF ONLY I COULD GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
I feel death's embrace, I feel death'sembrace!
Sweet sweet sorrow!
Sweet sweet sorrow!
