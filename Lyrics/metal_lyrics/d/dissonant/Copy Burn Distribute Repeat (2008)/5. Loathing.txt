Your end isn't worth my time And your time is not worthwhile
Your end isn't worth my time And your time is not worthwhile
My vision is shady at best Sight alone won'tfinish you
One time would I return feeding to see thatyour life is mine
And I see with apocalypse eyes no end to my montage of deadly design
This time I plan your demise
Blackness is now all I see as the fuckingflames burn higher
One time would I return feeding to see thatyour life is mine
I'M BLEEDING THE BEAUTY BELIES MY SINS AREFORSAKEN AND SEVER MY TIES
This time I plan your demise
Demise
Your end Your end
Your end isn't worth my time And your time is not worthwhile
Your end isn't worth my time And your time is not worthwhile
