(The threat is upon us march forward to takewhat is ours you decide who lives and who perishes TRUST YOUR GUN TRUST YOUR LEADER) (Here they come here they come their screams are silent! Fire at will! NOW AIM AND KILL THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS!)
A hundred million American idolaters tuneinto see the new sacrificial lamb
The blood they shed will forward theirmission to raise a new
And call it democracy, all who raise the flagwill be slaughtered in their own time, own way, in fire
Like sheep let to the valley our new Sheppardis born, follow me into eternity a hell away from home
BLOOD WE SPILL IN SACRIFICE ON FOREIGN LAND
BOUNDARIES DON'T EXIST IN THIS BODY LADEN CARVAN
We
We, we came into their home, we claim theirlives our own, we came into their home
We claim their lives! (Civilian sacrifice is a fraction of the action)
We, we came into their home, we claim theirlives
(Bloodstained hair, sunken eyes, coveredinside as they fire!)
The pain, they suffer, the pain they suffermore! MORE!
Moral fiber consumption for the weak
Remorse is of no concern, let the buried rest in peace
Sodom was a shadow of our very existence,little more than an inkling of things already come to pass!
