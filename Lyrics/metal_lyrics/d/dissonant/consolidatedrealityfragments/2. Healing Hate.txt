I creep into the darkness
In need for something true
Beneath the dirt of daylight
And fingertips of glue
Nothing left to love for
Or anything to hate
Nothing seems to make sense
In the world that we create

I feel the rage is raping
Around the hate is free
The broken hearts collection
I fix what's left of me
The sadness rips me open
A love that cant be mine
Pieces that are broken
And parts I've left behind

Grieving for a lost one
Craving for a friend
In need for some insanity
Cause nothing seems to end
I lost it all before
And gained it all back
When everything keeps changing
Its time to fade to black

Hate will mend my wounds
Never will I expose my self again
My heart was broken but now I heal my self
I will let go of you

I wish there was a way I could forget without this hate
But life is cruel, not always what you want is what you get

I fix what's left of me

There's nothing more to say
Silence is the only way
Love substitutes with hate
I will forget you
I will forget you
I will forget you
No more pain, no more suffering
Never again
No more words, no more wondering why
