When the sun collapse, I try to run
From blindness of my fallow kind
Raging down inside
To my cell
To my own hell
Sinking without a rope to guide me
Out of my maze, down on a spiral
To my end of time and essence of my life
Just a wicked game
Of souls searching one to blame

Why can't you see my
RAGE FRUSTRATION PAIN
Can you understand my
RAGE FRUSTRATION PAIN

When the sun collapse
To raise this pain and sorrow
I try to run away
Soon rage will follow
To my cell
To my own hell
Sinking without a rope to guide
Me out of this frustration
In this hell I hide
I hide from you
Just a wicked game
Of souls searching one to blame
