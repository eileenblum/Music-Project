Is this the end of all humanity, or just a happy dream?

The skies are open
The truth forsaken
In doubt we've followed
And lies we've swallowed
His back he turned on us
Cause we raped his creation

Into this life I came
Searching for truth in vain
Now I understand that we are to blame
Why can't you realize?
Look at it all through my eyes
Standing tall a world of greed and lies

Hear her cry
Earth crucified
A pain that can't be denied
On my knees
Pray in the rain
That washed away the hope to find

Until you understand
Earth died by our hand
Won't you kill us now for what we have done?
Until you face your fail
Air will be out for sale
Standing tall a world of greed and betrayal

We've fed disintegration
We've bred this heresy
This is not our destination
This is our destiny
Stop these illusions, erase these denials
This is my promise, do you hear her cry?
For the ages of ruin polluting our land
This is the time for our final stand

Hear her cry
Earth crucified
A pain that can't be denied
On my knees
Praying for rain
To washed away the human kind

I know you hear my prayer
Well don't you have something to say?
Give me a sign, a massage, in mind I'm blind
No more I pray for free
If its not gonna be you it's gonna be me
Now I'm the one to be in charge of wrath
