In the name of god we try to rule the world
Bloodshed and murder in the name of our lord
Engaged with power, weapons silence words
It's not the truth we follow, it's sacrilege in shape of swords

It's our misconception
Of words that preach for tolerance and compassion

Politicians' dirty hands corrupted what was pure
Evil is our sickness and sickness is our cure
Honesty forsaken for the sake of lies
In the name of god, our redemption is our demise

Justice confused with malice truth dazed by deceit
Books of narrow minded fools tell us what to breathe or eat
Freedom is deception created by their word
We chain ourselves in sorrow as we follow the herd

Oh, it's our misconception
Of words that preach for tolerance and compassion

We name our murders conquests
We name our victims foe
In the name of god
We'll rip the roots we've sow

Comprehension not upon us, manipulating truth
Distorted words of wisdom corrupting our youth
Ignorance we've nourished, fed our souls with pain
All we know is blurred reflections of what was once considered sane

Oh, it's our misconception
Of words that preach for tolerance and compassion

Think before you act
You are summoned by man and follow commands of words not true
Look in your heart. You die for their god but god's in you
