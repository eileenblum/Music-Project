Victims of the holocaust living in the fear
Waiting the plague to spread
Chemical arms corrodes the earth
Toxic waste is everywhere

Massive attack command the world
Political forces oppress the weak
Victms of war, marching to the abyss
A last cry tries to escape

Annihilation of masses

A nation born with hatred in mind
Strapped down screaming out to die
Soldiers march where the bombs fall
Chaos leads the humanity down
