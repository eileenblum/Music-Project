The plague rebirth spreading the torment
Life in terrorist age
Without hope for tomorrow
Society incites decadence

Lethal disaster
Slowly till die
Lethal disaster
By destruction of humanity

Scattering disease infecting the world
Poison of cruelty dogmatic disgrace
Missiles to self-destruction
Scars of life bleeding again

Atomic bombs - Scattering pain
Hell on earth - Evil supremacy
Victim os science - Slaves of hate
Human decay - Marching to die
