Faith breeds intolerance
Twisted minds closed to the reality
False speechs said every day
Polluting the society with an evil bastard

Slave...
Enslaved by cross
Slave...
Enslaved by fucking cross

The blood of the wine, the sacred lie
You choose to serve god
The sign of the cross is the sign of war
Deceiving a blind society

Domination - Blind faith
Illusion - Condemned by grace

Sacrifice - Before the name of god
Hypocrisy - Why do I have to believe
Srvants trapped by the fear of death
When a belief becomes insane
Choose your money or be saved
Die by your faith
