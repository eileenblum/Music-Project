My life is the experiment of desire
Everything now in the name o science
Nothing can stop the progress
Suffering feeding my pain

Now!!
Now it's time to die...
Termina disease

My breath carries my legacy
Just only death to begin the plague
No drug will save of this poison
Sickness of evil, die by insanity

Cold wind, fear of deatg
All the living begin to die
Our lost future falling into decay
Machines now erase your mind
