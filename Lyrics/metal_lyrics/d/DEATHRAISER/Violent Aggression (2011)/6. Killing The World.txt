False preachers of hypocrisy
Spreading hatred and destruction
Condemning the human race, killing for religion
Time of suffering before the reality
Executing all nations

Killing the world

A system designed  to mislead and lie
From the past to the future
Millions of people are blind
Like puppets following the leaders
The curse of racial pride
Fatal disease created by lies

Killing the world

While the world is destroyed
The hatred is a fuel to the engine
The only future is lost
In the war against the machines
Humanity pays with death
Nobody will be saved
