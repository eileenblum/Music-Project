To begin the sonic massacre
Metal and blood together again
Crushing and smashing new trends
Only the strongest will remain

Thrash or be thrashed!
Violence is our way of life
Thrash or be thrashed!
My favorite pleasure will cause my death

Alcohol running in our  veins
Headbangers hungry for thrash
Aggressive riffs like a kick in the face
Metal up your ass!

Thrash or be thrashed!
Violence is our way of life
Thrash or be thrashed!
My favorite pleasure will cause my death

Thrash or be thrashed!
