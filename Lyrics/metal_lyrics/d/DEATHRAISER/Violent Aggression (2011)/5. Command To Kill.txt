Running by damned shadows with ardent desire
Tonight they're coming to kill
Without areement, without pity, only treasure
Nobody will escape

Without contest you'll die
Violent and fast death
Feeling your fail breathing
The commnad will ready to kill

Command to kill

Walking by silent streets
Maniac forces wanting destruction
Soldiers sent of hell
Executing its sentence

Die! Slowly you're dying
Face of death more than insane
Kneel yourself and make your finishes prayers
Now nothing can save you
