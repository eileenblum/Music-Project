The whole world suffers by hatred
Technology engineers for mass destruction
Victims of fear lead to extinction
Murderous minds obsessed by cruelty and pain

Lives lost without future
Trapped in lies humanity survives
Violence and hatred  make you believe
The state of fear hits the society

Spreading the aggression
Feeling the evil in their flesh
The pleasure of watching as everything dies
No mercy, no respect

Violent aggression

Forces of evil bring destruction
Human bones cover the dirt
The men and their slaves creatte torture
Crshing the truth spilling the blood
