You will never want to feel the pain
The madness is coming in your way
With the cold knife and no place to run
The evil is what remains

Nothing escaped the oppression
The price is high for life
Arrested in the game of death
You will be next to die

Oppression!
You were born to survive
Till death!
You'll never escape alive

Oppression till death!

You can not hide the face of death
Covered with blodd, your body melts
Pleasure become a slow pain
Sadistic instruments used again

Look to the side, you are the target
Beneath my thirst for blood
Into the deeps of insanity
The slaughter has just begin
