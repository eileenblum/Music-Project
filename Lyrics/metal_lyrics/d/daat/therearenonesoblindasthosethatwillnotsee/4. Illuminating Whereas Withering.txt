Light, shining not with a gold, let me see what lies on the other side, the true reality, that
without forms and laws, limits, illusions, decorations, where everything will become nothing
in non-existence named Sitra Ahra.

Astarot â the right hand of Lucifer, wise and bloodthirsty, let me understand! Having opened
all three eyes and breaking the barriers of perception I will know the truth, lying beyond the
objective understanding, separating the existence of its appearance, where the black light
will shine through rays of manifestation.

The fire will break out from the spark of life, which we bear within ourselves. We will blow it
and exaggerate it. Drawn by the light of the flame, like moths they (vim patitur),) tempted,
will burn in the absorbing fire of Azerate.

Let me be you â a form of ecstasy, a breakaway force, a force of boundless will and non-
conquest.

I exalt the moment, when one day Moira will be forced to leave her craft, and all the seven
archons will be trampled, so the day will come, which will throw discredit upon what was
considered unchangeable and motionless, what seemed to be unbreakable and firm, like
Capernaum, Horozain and Bethsaida, ascended up to the skies and cursed because of the
refusal to be robbed and humiliated in salvation.

Relying on his Logos, the ones will sow in the most fierce storm on the dead ground, the
others will flood their fields with sacrificial blood, driven by terror, they will sacrifice cattle
and their children, those, who were created in the image of him.
Lucifer, shining not with a gold, you are only the truth (burning and scorching.)

Let me shining like you.
