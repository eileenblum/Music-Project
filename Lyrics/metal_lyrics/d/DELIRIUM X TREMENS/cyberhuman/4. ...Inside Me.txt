I awake in the night, lit by the cold light of the open ice,
It's a calling that forces me to run.
I must stare at the sublime beauty of their motionless hands,
Of their dead faces, of their sterile eyes
That don't belong to them anymore, they have become more and more
A possession of mine, cause when I'll end this up they will be me.
I'm like a child in front of the most precious gift,
In front of life belonging to nobody else than me.

I have destroyed.
Lacerated, hit, blinded and regurgitated,
I have made mine what had been given to me for an instant
And now it won't belong to anyone else because
It won't be able to escape from where I've hidden it! Inside me...

I fall asleep listening in my mind an old creaking record,
Playing the music of their voices, their smiles and their fucking fears
I'm all of this, I'm happiness and fear, flesh and dust.
Nothing will be parted, It's all encased inside me.

I must melt with their souls, I must consume myself

I perceive their motions inside me, with eyes bulging with terror
I hear them plead for a useless forgiveness that only now can be offered,
Now that we have become one thing.
A mirror waves
Like a wayfarer and I stop in front of him admiring my ego, my power.

I am one, but not alone, I have begun to grow and I just want to go on,
I want more lymph, more flesh to feed me, other food for my flesh.
I'm dreaming, I hear their voices calling from the depths, now it's them to ask for me,
Them who need to feed their hate with my soul,
They will prey my corpse to make the reckoning perfect.
