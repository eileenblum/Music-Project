Wherever I turn my eyes, any sound I listen to, anything I touch
Everything has lost its true taste, all is artificial, nothing is as
It should be everything is vomited on the earth
Has to be measured and weighed everything has the same form,
Not a variation, a slight alteration
Nothing emane heat

You are just foolish human shaped cyborgs,
You hide your inner void behind a wall of strangeness,
You' ve quitted dreaming, quitted living
Who is leading you to ruin
Making you believe in fairy tales
Cyberhuman!!

Neither the faces of those who talk with their ego
Escape all that tastes
Differently to their unworthy normality
Every thought is spelled with the same filthy words,
Evocated from the same language where A equals Z!
Where all words is lie and the color of the page
Is red like the blood spilled from your cianotic eyes

You are foolish human shaped cyborgs,
You hide yourself behind a wall of strangness,
You've quitted dreaming to be guided by the mass
Who is leading you to ruin
Making you believe in fairy tales
Cyberhuman
