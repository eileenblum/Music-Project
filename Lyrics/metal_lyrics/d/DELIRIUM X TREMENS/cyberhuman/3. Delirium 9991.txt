Beginning of life
A new creature of bright light
Is born and lives
Vision of a world that never existed
The only essence of life

Darkness in the mind
Eternal wounds in the flesh
Crystals of pain on my dying face
Food of my present
Death of my tomorrow
You are my DreamSorrow
And now you live with me...
