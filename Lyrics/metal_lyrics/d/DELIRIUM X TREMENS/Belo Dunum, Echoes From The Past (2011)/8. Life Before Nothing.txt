You'll build the final work, No one can stop you
You'll reach your goal, treading on anyone
It will be a blood paved road
But everyone will turn pale in the face on your result
You will go beyond all human and moral bounds
Your mission will remain in history
Like gods exploits

And when we danced
On your last breaths
We couldn't believe into an end so close
Condemned to the disaster
Turn to pieces by the rage of water

Blood, sweat, iron and cement
You are S.A.D.E., you are the state in the state
You have no laws
You are not scared by the deads

The dirty hands, soiled by blood
Won't be yours
We can't do anything
You can't do anything

The damn is raising
Thanks to the work of victims
Imposing and majestic
Like a temple of the Gods
A monument to the greatness
Which controls impassively the valley
As a queen dominates her subjects
With her mortal scepter

Mount TOC is moving, only dreams of a few boots
No one will hear nothing from out rotten mouths
Your government: only ghosts
Useless zombies in your hands
Our alarms won'r pass through the cement

And when we danced
On your last breaths
We couldn't believe into an end so close
Condemned to the disaster
Killed by the killing water

La terra trema, non c'Ã¨ piÃ¹ scampo
Avanza l'onda di morte
Tuona la valle disperata
