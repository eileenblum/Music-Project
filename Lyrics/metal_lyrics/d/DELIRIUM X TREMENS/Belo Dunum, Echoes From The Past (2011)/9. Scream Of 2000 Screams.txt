"LongarÃ²n no la ghe n'Ã© pÃ¬
StrazhiÃ da dai lamÃ©nt de chi che l'ha pers tÃ¹t
LongarÃ²n l'Ã© da brentÃ na de lÃ greme
N'dove che naviga le anime dele vitime
Doimila se contarÃ 
Omi, fÃ©mene, bÃ²ce, la tragedia no la fa distinzhiÃ²n
E se 'n dÃ¬ pasarÃ© par chela val
Fursi ghe rivarÃ© 'ncora a sentir
ChÃ©i lamÃ©nt de dolÃ²r"

Corpses everywhere, dried eyes
Desperate hands craving for a breathe of life
Between water and mud
The announced destruction has happened
Without anybody doing anything
Are you satisfied?
Did you reach your goal?
You spilled death and blood
Like those who once sawed life and hope
You created a monster
Trespassing limits that even a god
Would have dared to reach
Death will torment your damned lives

Silence... roar, debris everywhere
The night adviser brings death and sorrow
Towns razed to the ground
Lives broken by the hand of man

Dead float in the killing water
Dead flat in the souls of the killes still alive

Twothousand dead
S.A.D.E. bringer of death

You will be just cannon fodder
Former corpses roaming on the Earth
They shall pay your tribute
Death will be your faithful inseparable mate
Every night it will mate with you
In an orgy that will lead you to madness
It will take you in the land of no return
You will be shipped in a hopeless land

You will be remembered
Like the one who remembers murders
A shame that no purifying
Water will be able to wash away

Your conscience will consume
You like the gangrene consume flesh
Making it food for the worms
Making you food for yourselves
