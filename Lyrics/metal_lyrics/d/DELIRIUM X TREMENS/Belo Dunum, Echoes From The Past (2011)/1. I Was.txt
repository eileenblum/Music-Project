I fought for my country
Under the royal tricolour flag
Suffering, cold, death and honour in my life
I cried tears for friends
I can see again now
The Austrian death cancelled me
But my memory makes me alive

When I was born nothing existed
No one of the things you've got now
In the cradle of dolomites
Where the wind of witches blows rage
And the Basilisk look after the integrity of our roots

I'll tell Myths and legends
which kept me company in the trench
Histories of giants and demons that fill my places
Mount Serva watched over me

I died in a filthy trench
Where no bell was ringing for me
Only the voices of our brothers
The Alpines
Here and now, I dance with the souls of the old men
But I'll come back to my mother's home
No one will forget me

I saw the new probable Messiah
Killed by servants of ambition
I saw a mad dressed like a scientist
Modifuing organism, CreHated from No_Thing
I perceived the vibration of collapsing Mountains
Broken lives, never forgotten memories
An endless horror
A cross that the time can't erase

When I was born nothing existed
No one of the things you've got now
In the cradle of dolomites
Where the wind of witches blows rage
And the Basilisk look after the integrity of our roots

You'll read in this row my story
Stories kept in my memories
Now forget your present
And hear the past
The voices of the ancient
Will guide you in these stories
Buried in time
