In a nameless village
The smell of Spring spreads in the air
But this scent hides something hellish and rotten
Ghastly being curse in the air
Witches are waiting, hidden in foul-smelling dens
Hordes of wolves pull up live at their beck and call
Terrible dreams infest nights

Endless Blood, death and sorrow
Giant save this raped land
Raped by filthy cursed beings
Born from the sperm of the wicked

The witches are crouched down
Next to the spinning wheel
They weaved writhed woofs
They train greedy armies to sate their appetites
They grasp children cursing them forever

Wake up TeverÃ²n and save our souls
Let remove famine and nightmares of the night
Let bring back life to the ancient glory of our lands
Violated by damned souls
Wake up TeverÃ²n

Your sacrifice is immolated in the rocks
The spell sentenced you
Now your soul is stone, your face is Mountain
The altar of your memory will always graze clouds
Protects us!

Green clearings and impervious Mountains
The Forest is grasped by the wind
Impietous streams flow like time
Echoes of the Past

Endless Blood, death and sorrow
Giant save this raped land
Raped by filthy cursed beings
Born from the sperm of the wicked

TeverÃ²n your story
Wille be write on the rocks
Your blood will be the water of the streams
Which will quench animals and man's thirst
Your tears will be rain and snow
TeverÃ²n, the eternal legend
