Mass and serial - American
It's killing to me - Filth
Moral values - American
Rich American dream - Filth

Guns are loaded - American
Bullies can't hide - Filth
You can't kill me - American
I'm your golden child - Filth

Severed crown priceless
Justice is anomaly
Knowledge is the weapon
Open up and find it
Hate is the only way

Powers that be drain you
They give you reality
Anything for money
Anyone can be bought
Hate is the only way

Can you feel it - American
It's what we are - Filth

I want you to motherfucking die, you, yes, you
