Erase these words we've spoken
Is this what freedom is
Censoring out mouth
Pretend you're a god

Think you're a god
Raising your child
Infallible wisdom
Own up to your shit

You put the blame on us
We say fuck you

Spit on your propaganda
Your words ain't shit to me
Follow the truth
Realize yourself

Deep in your heart
You know we're right
But you can't deal with
Fucking up their lives

You put the blame on us
We say fuck you

Who's the scapegoat
Who's to blame
We're the scapegoat
Bring it on

Truth we bring you the truth

Scapegoat
