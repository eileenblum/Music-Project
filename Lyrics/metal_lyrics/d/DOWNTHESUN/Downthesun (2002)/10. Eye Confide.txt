Sitting,waiting
For the fall through
I still know
Do you
Trapped inside
My head of shame
Should I tell
Or lie

Eye confide
Should I trust you
I don't know if you'd even care

Collapsing, Struggling
Stuck in between
I'd say I'm afraid
Another lie
Sitting,waiting
For the fall through
I still know
Do you

Eye confide
Should I trust you
I don't know if you'd even care

Eye confide
Do you trust me
For my soul maybe I'd confide

In my world I show you
Can I trust you to care
If I tell you my soul
Will you still be here

Eye confide
Eye confide in you

No I can't trust
You I can't trust

Eye confide
