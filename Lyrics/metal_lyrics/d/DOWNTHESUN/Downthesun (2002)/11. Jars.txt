Covet, wait for my embrace
I want to touch you and feel what's inside your face

You want it
Become it
Give your life to me

Preserve your beauty
I put you away

Jars, my shrine to beauty
All that's inside you, possession of insanity

You want it
Become it
Give your life to me

Preserve your beauty
I put you away

Preserve life
Preserve side
Preserve life
Preserve side

Preserve your beauty
I put you away
Preserve your beauty
I put you away

Jars
