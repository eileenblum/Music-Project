Is this life we shame
Born to die
God i know it's true
I make my life

Now you can see it conforming in front of you
Now you can see it becoming a part of you

We've all died in our heads before

Occupying mind
From death you hide
Obscuring truth
It will take you
Frozen respect
Life 'til death
Freedom of fear
I'm alive

[pre-chorus]
[chorus]

We all die

Come on save me while you berate me
Sometimes dying is the only way to give
Truth it will come where you bleed from
Your lies are the place where dreams won't live
I just know that i wanna go to the other side of the eye

[pre-chorus]
[chorus]

We all die
