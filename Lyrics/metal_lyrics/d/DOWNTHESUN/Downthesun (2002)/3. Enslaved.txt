What's in your world
Nothing you care about, nothing you feel
How can you live
Always on the verge of  realizing yourself

The master that we serve has raped our destiny
We're still enslaved we're still enslaved
The master that we serve has shit our lives away
We're still enslaved, we're still enslaved

Life's pain you face
Everything's set now you're told what to do
It's all you know
Spinning like a cog in a pointless machine
Seeing truth now
Nothing from the sweat that was stole from you
Cutting yourself
Looking at your wrists as the blood hits the floor

[chorus]

Scream 'til you bleed
Looking at life though a crack in the mirror
Reflections all split as it becomes clearer
Devotions you've  brought nothing to gain
With  innocence lost all that's left is pain
Make it stop

[chorus]

I'm enslaved
