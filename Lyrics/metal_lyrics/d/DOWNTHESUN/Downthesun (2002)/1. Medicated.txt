Injecting life into a hole
Capturing freedom through the smoke
Expanding thoughts though pictured squares
Happiness from lines smear your face

Hiding which is scarred
I want you high
Get all stung out
A medicated world prescribes smles

Drowning the sickness is the cure
Pouring the liquid sanity
Brutal affliction bottled soul
Who really cares what life is for

Follow in my footsteps

[chorus]

Get all strung out
I need my thrill

[chorus]

It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful lie

Get all stung out
