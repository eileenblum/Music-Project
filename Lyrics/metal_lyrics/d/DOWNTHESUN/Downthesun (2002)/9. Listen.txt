Lullaby skies, unfinished symphony
Illuminate, your stars align
They will lead you until they fade
Showering

In this life you will never be alone
Trusting blindly, trying not to let it show

Finding beauty in the madness
Listen and erase
Finding beauty in the madness
Listen and erase

Sculpting, shaping this masterpiece
Create, transform deus ex machina
I am nothing, a humble man
She makes me a novel

Bound and bleeding, wondering, if you're alone
Trusting blindly, trying not to let it show

[chorus]

Lock, walk a life with me
Walk a life with me
Unlock, walk a life with me
Walk a life with me

[pre-chorus 1]
[chorus]

Listen
