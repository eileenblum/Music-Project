Run
Away from your worst mistakes
Run
Forgiveness not given
Run
Forgiveness not asked from you

Run
Away from your hate
And your fear of love
From your treason
From your nightmares
From evil

Light, you need light
To warm your soul
To dry your tears

Fly
To your island never forgotten
To your son
Fly
To your wife
She's waiting for you

Fly
To your friends never forgotten
To your faithful dog
To your warm home
To peace

Light, you need light
To warm your soul
To dry your tears

Rage and strength to hold
Until the end
Pages of blood to write
At the end

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
