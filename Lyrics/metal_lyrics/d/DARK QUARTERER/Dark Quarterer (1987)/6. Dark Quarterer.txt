Night Is Coming
Day Has Gone
Black Is All Around

No More Songs
No More Noises
People Disappear

Small Far Light
In The Sky
Are Beginning To Shine

Without Moon
Without Love
Without Friends To Find

With His Body In Your Hands
Near To Be At The End

Quite Be Quite
Cold Be Cold
Don't Lose This Occasion

All Is Ready To Be Done
As For Your Vocation

Start To Run
Looking For
The Right Man To Kill

In The Arms
You Will Find
A Body Without Life

So If You Want
You Can Be The Famous
The Famous Killer King

Another Life Has Gone
Another Day Has Gone Away

Still Your Time Don't Stop
Still Your Mind Will See New
Sacrifices

The Night Starts
To Be Clear
Still Ten Minutes
Before Light
Sounds And Noises
Are Coming
Now You Die, Tonight You'll
Live Again
