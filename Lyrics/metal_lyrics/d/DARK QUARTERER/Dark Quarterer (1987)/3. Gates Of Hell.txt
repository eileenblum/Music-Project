I Have Decided
To Live As A Rebel
Without Showing
Never My Face Smiling
Without Giving My Help
To Live As The Worst
And Slandering
All My Friends
Hating Who Is Loving Me

Don't Try To Change Me
I Don't Believe It May Be
Let The Evil Be My Food

I Have Decided
I Don't Ask Your Pardon
Every Time I Get My Revenge
For All Good Around Me
I Shall Myself
In Red And Black
As Blood And Death
Before The Last Breath
Gates Of Hell Will Open

And I Shall Flying
Into The Deeper Place
To Usurp
The Lucifer's Throne
