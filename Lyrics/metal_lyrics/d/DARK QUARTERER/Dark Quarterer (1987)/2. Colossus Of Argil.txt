When The World Is Full
Of Fire And Wounds
And When The Minds
All The Minds
Are Put To Sleep
When The Giants Is Reigning
When People Die Young
And Nobody Is Crying
Freedom!
Freedom! Freedom!
Only Now
Someone Is Waiting
Patient For Tomorrow
And They Know
Tomorrow
Is Not So Far

Now These People
Open Ears And Eyes
All First Chains Are Broken
And Tomorrow Is Coming
A Thousand Throats
Are Crying Freedom!
And The Battle Starts
They Come
Down From The Mountains
By Their Shining Swords
They Rend The Dark
They Hit So
They Will Be The Winners
And When The Sun Comes
They Will Crush
The Colossus Of Argil

War Always Be
Against The Monster Of
Stone
As He's Keeping Still
And He Handle Us
Come To Fight Together
With Us
We Must Be As Brothers
And Sisters
We Must Act
As Soon As We Can
Mister Giant You Must Die

Come On! Come On! Be Free!
Once For All Be Alive!
And He'll Fall
Down Like Flies
