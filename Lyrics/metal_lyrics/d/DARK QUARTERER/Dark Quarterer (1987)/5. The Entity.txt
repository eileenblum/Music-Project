You Take Possession
Of My Entity
It Will Corrupt
All Your Mind

I'm Hungry
I Need Their Hot Blood
As A Rabid Beast
I'm Ready To Sacrifice
All My Victims In Your Name

I've Taken
Possession Of Your Entity
It Has Corrupted
All My Mind

All My Pores Are Oozing
White Cold Blood
While My Soul
Vibrates For You
Oh My Leader, My Possessor
My Unknown Entity

But Now I Want To Know
What Is Your Face
Give Me A Sign
Of Your Presence
Near Me, Around, All Is Cold
While The Sky
Is Growing Grey
As Plumb And Dark As Death

I Was A Child, I Was Only Six
When You Revised
The Virginity Of My Soul
Without Upsetting Me
You Played With A Puff
Blowing Out Six Candles
In Front Of My Eyes
You Chose Me

Let Me Touch
The Reason Of My Life
Let Me See
Your Blazing Face
