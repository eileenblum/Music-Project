What Is My Life
Without Any Sense
What Is My Life
What Is Music
Without My Presence
All Is Death
All Is Nothing
For Me Songs Are Noises
And To Decide
If I Want To Live
Or To Be Dead
Has Become My Obsession
I Want To Forget
I'm Named

A Slave Of Red Hot Gloves
Red Hot Gloves

I Must Find Again
My Fingers Force
I Must Be Strong
I Must Listen To My Melodies
Just As Before
I Can Sell My Soul
And To Become
The Best Of The World
So My Hands
Will Make Songs
From My Thoughts
All For Me Is Illusion
But I Don't Accept
To Be In This Way

I Must Start Again
Devil, Buy My Soul, I Sell
I Will Sign My Curse
Let Me Play Again
Let The Keys Be Crazy
For My Last Symphony

I Have Found Again
My Spirit Force
So I Can Play
People Listen
To My Spirit Face
A Devil Face
Prince Of Darkness Calls Me

I Must Go
Flying On Your Wings
The Last Note
And After Kings Of Silence
You've Bought My Songs
Learnt My Music
But Never Forget I'm Named
