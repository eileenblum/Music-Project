I must create the greatest empire!!!
Who'll dare extinguish my fire?
Conqueror, they will call me the king of kings
The age of thousands of little reigns, people smashes to smithereens
It must finish! it must end!
The power of fear, is enormous for weak men
And man wants to be nominated by the fear of death
Pyramid of your empty skulls will be placed inside your walls
My worst for will become my right hand
As I can appreciate all the men of great worth
I will save all the artist and artisans
My savage tribes will learn all secrets of a better life,
The king of Mongolians will become the king of the world.
From the extreme east across the lands washed by the Yellow Sea
To the far west Arabian lands washed by the Caspian Sea
Across the mountain passes where eternal glaciers touch the sky
I'll dominate the whole world
And the whole world will submit to my laws
Thousands of riders will obey to my orders of war
Armed with their swords, bows and shields
Ready to fight for me
A human wave, will sweep away those, who find themselves in its way
Giving one war-cry to the sky
They will shake the earth
Your fool kings won't accept my surrender terms
So they condemn themselves to an inglorious end
Those who rebel against me against my project
Are destined to death by my warrior's cruel hand
I'm stronger than all!!!
When I die God must be afraid
When my last breath removes me from this little earth
Then I'll take possession of the sky, of the whole universe
God wait for me, I'm coming
Go and leave your place free
For evermore king of kings
Will be called GenGisKhan
