So few breaths, so few moons
Too many regrets in my life
Venerated as Amon Ra, hated as Anubi
I lived my days
Surrounded by honour and riches
Without suspicion that someone was trying to kill me
I tried to be a just king for my loyal subjects
Perhaps my descent was unpure
My origins false
I'm searching inside me
The reasons for this visceral hatred
But I can't find truths
That can give me eternal peace
I'm wandering in the dark
My soul is lost
My eyes can't see a light
My memories too far
My curse will strike
Those who will profane my tomb
Those who will dare, will be damned and die
I'm crying my rage
My suffering for my weakness
I'm praying to my gods
Give me the strength for my revenge
I'm crying my love
For my Queen Ankhesepaaton
I've prayed to my gods
To give her the force to live
You know my legend
You see my treasures
You look at my devastated race
You cannot imagine
Cannot understand my desperate fate
If you know the truth
Please cry to the sky
And I will be forever free from this darkness
And I'll see the light at last
