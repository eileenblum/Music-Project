There was a time when
Everyone considered me
As an example, a God on earth
A bright light on their way
Oohh now your knives penetrate inside my body
To take my life away.
All has been cancelled. Destroyed.
And the night is slowly falling on me
There was a time of glory and conquests
A time of certain truths
All was so perfect and all was so right
To look like ethernal truth
How many times I have saved you from disgrace
Forgiving your mistakes
How much did I love you and grant you
But now you feel free to kill me......
23 reasons in your arms
How many in your heads?
Did I so sin against you
To deserve to die?
Ides of March, as the diviner told me,
have been my last days
and while my blood is flowing from my wounds
my soul's leaving me
I'm dying now
love and battles and hate and peace
odes, honours, and laurel wreathes
from the first day to the last
flash by in front of my eyes
but fade away from my mind
