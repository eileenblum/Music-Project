There was a light that wrapped
My life and gave me a force to fight again
There were voices from the sky
That inspired me and told me "never vield give up"
And now I'm here, the blind church
Condemned me to the stake, as the worst witch
They'll close my eyes
They'll break my heart
But they will never extinguish my light
S t r u m e n t a l e
Fight! my king
It's the time to fight....
I'm so young but I'm so sure
Eight thousand soldiers.... oh follow me
France must be free
One hundred year of war
One hundred year of pain
People cannot bear it again
One by one
All the towns are free
Orleans, Reims
Campiegne, Paris
Invaders will be chosen for hell
A paradise of peace
Will return to our land
Every man again
Will know he's not fighting in vain
God, please, don't leave me alone
Today is the last day
Flames and false words are destroying me
My fate is decided
The light of my eyes
Is fading away
But in my soul the light is shining more and more
I fly, I see the future of my nation
Now it's free, it's great!
