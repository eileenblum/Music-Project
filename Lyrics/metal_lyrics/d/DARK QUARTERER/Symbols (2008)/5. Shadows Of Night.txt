Waiting for the dark in the shadow of the night
Ready to fight and to hunt for my child
I live my life in the pride of my roots
But I live my time for the lovers of my life
Waiting for the dark in the shadow of the night
Ready to fight and to hunt for my child
Both a hunter and a prey snatched away
From my life from my land and from my roots
Shadow of the night please show me the way
Using my black skin for my freedom
The only light will be inside my eyes, That's my life
Inside four walls I'll find all my revenge
Inside four walls I believe
I'll break my chains and I'll change my fate
Against all, I will be free
My mind flies, To my youth
To my sweetheart, Left in tears
Remains of ancient memories that have
Never disappeared from my time, my nights... my life
Shadows of the night show me the way
As I live my life in this prison
Only one light inside my eyes
Looking for freedom
I'll Use my strength up to the end
As I've got faith, I believe
In a different fate for all black man
No more slave people
My mind flies, To my youth
To my sweetheart, Left in tears
Remains of ancient memories that have
Never disappeared from my time, my nights... my life
There will be a time, When the blood shed
Will be a new vital limph
Will give me the strength to fight up to the end
To find the last gleam, To find the first light
I dream a future for my unforgotten child
Rich in sweet dream
That flood all his night, When everybody will be a slave
Only to their freedom, I'm praying for that day
