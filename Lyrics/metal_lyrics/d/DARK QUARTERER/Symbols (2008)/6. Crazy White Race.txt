A night without moonlight
A night without dreams, concealed by darkness
We'll move like a spirit condemned to kill
The ambush is ready, the ambush is today
We'll fly on their heads
Like an eagle on its prey condemned to die
Help me Manitou, Help us Manitou
For every woman, for every child
For every injustice, all mexican soldiers will pay with their lives
pale-faces are rabbie, pale-faces spit lies
promising a peace for our people
but they always put us in jail
kill them manitou, kill them manitou
when will our old days return
when will the blood be shed
be just of bisons and bears
when will my revenge subside
then we'll return to our free green lands
but now we must hold out, but now we must fight
against this false progress
that destroys the nature that destroys life
we shoot our arrows, we shoot our lances, so every night
will be a nightmare for this crazy white race
help me Manitou, Help us Manitou
In Shelton Canyon, We believe in peace
But general Miles, Forgot all the treaties betraying us again
Reduced as slaves, inside a reserve
Condemned to live, Without dignity no future for us
Where are you Manitou, Where are you Manitou
Great Spirit I ask you, To save my lost soul
It's blinded by revenge
but you know that It's never been so damned before
I will ride one more time, Along the "Gila" shore
I'll play with my sons, I'll embrace my Alope, I will live in love
Help me Manitou, Save me Manitou
when will our old days return, when will the blood be shed
be just of bisons and bears, when will my revenge subside
then we'll return to our free green lands
