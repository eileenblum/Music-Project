The Crazy Puppets Are Jumping To Polluted Waves
Of Notes Combined In A False Melody

A Thousand Victims Are Jerking To The Incessant
Mindless Beating Of The Drum Machine

They Are Poisoning Themselves In The Smoke
With Their Open Mouths
Disconnected Minds

Ladies And Gentlemen
Tonight We'll Show You
The Last Dance Of Death
Then Out Of This (Pitch) Darkness
You Gamble With Your Destiny
