My Queen, They Are Coming
Passing Through The Rugged Mountains
They Will Sack Your Villages
They'll Destroy Our Life Of Peace

Seize Your Sword, Knight Of Mine
Choose All The Best Warriors
Fill Your Mind With Hate And Coldness
As You've Never Done Before

Horses Are Impatient
Men Are Praying, Women Crying
Storm Clouds Blind The Stars
On The Plain Pitch Darkness Reigns
Our Black Mantles, Our Black Hats
Will Make Us A Ghost Of Evil
But The Light We Hold Inside
Will Lead Us To Triumph
To Triumph
We'll Triumph
We'll Triumph
