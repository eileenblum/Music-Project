It's A Shipwreck
Without A Desert Island On Which We Could Survive
It's Destiny
You Can Never Change
It's Too Late Now

Because There Are No More Birds In The Sky
Because There Are No More Fish In The Sea
Because There's No Place For Remorse
Because There's No More Truth

This Is My Last Song
And Then I Will Die
This Is Your Unheard Song
Minstrel
All Life Is Dying With Yours
