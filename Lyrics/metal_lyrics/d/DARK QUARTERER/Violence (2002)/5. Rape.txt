But I'm not a good swimmer
I don't know how long I'll hold out
You, you are like a little boat sailing on my course
I'm sorry but I need you to save me
So I must use you, I must mount you

The Sea Is Rising Now
I Can't Hold Out Long
Baby

The Wind Is Blowing Hard
Take My Shaking Hands
Nothing More To Fear Baby

Action Must Be Taken
There's No Other Way
There's No Other Time
To Wait, Baby

I'm Getting On You Baby

Rape has happened

But Your Boat Is Sinking Now
With Me

Legs And Arms Are Cold
Shore, I Don't See Any Shore
On The Horizon
