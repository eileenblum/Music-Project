Crawling near the people
I feel his thought
so I know the truth
I am inside your secrets
inside your .... minds
And I weight the right
I weight the unjust
I judge all the good
and all the evil
in each one of you
each one of you
You cannot escape to me! Escape to me !
You who are always living in the hate
don't try to hide yourself
masking your ill feelings
under a false..... smile
Run and run again !
I see you trying to climb up on the mirror's wall
and for any fault you make, I take revenge!
each any time!
many times!
you cannot escape me! escape from me!
And you, man always lives
with your head down
don't flee, no, don't be afraid
I'm your defender for your revenge
every time you will call me
I'll be with you will be with you.
