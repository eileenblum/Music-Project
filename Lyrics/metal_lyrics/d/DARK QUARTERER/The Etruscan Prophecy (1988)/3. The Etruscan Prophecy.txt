Walking in the night
across the silent oak forest
we are crying for your life man
I feel their presence all around me
in the odour of earth
we are living and we will return
when the oppressor's hand is over your heads
Waiting for his axe blows
to feel our last trees
we don't want him to destroy our sons
he will pay for all the evil done to the world
Look at the sky it's grey
no flying birds move the air
no sun ray warms your skin
no moon for dreaming, loving
and death kills life
day after day
and your eyes are tired
of seeing mistakes everywhere
and to be fooled by continuos lies
The first clods now start to move
the first fists are free from earth
and rage and war cries fill the air
rage to revenge their ancient world
cries to destroy who all destroyed
and armed fists to crush his head
Everywhere you feel their steps
you feel their breath
as a wolf looking for his prey
they chase him
and the night will be so long
and the night will be so strong
until the last verdict be given
And the sky is blue again
and the birds are flying free
and the sun rays warm your skin
on the last page
first love words will move the air
the first dream will come true till the end of time.
