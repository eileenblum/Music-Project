Wild instincts from deep in a mind
Eyes full of murderous sight
Macabre thoughts never told
Sickness feelings corrode
Visions of a skew reality

Day by day lost in thoughts out of bounds,
Feeding a new unspeakable deed
An evil form of knowledge
To kill a man with no remorse

Natural will to kill hide deep down in anyone
May explains the wherefores of murder ones,
Who live their lives holding a secret
Monster inside, planning how to
Feed their urges beyond our sight

Society fears those criminal minds
Whichâre wearing masks to hide

[Repeat chorus]

Horrendous murderers,
Which society folks blame as insane
Though, the more brutal the crime is
The more our thirst for blood grows
Therefore, our sickness is not
Our responsibility â¦neither our fault
