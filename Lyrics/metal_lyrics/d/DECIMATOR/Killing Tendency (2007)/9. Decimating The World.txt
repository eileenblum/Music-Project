[Bonus Track]

Killing in a massive attack
Feeds my terrible delight
Look at the blood in my hands
Got from the torture deeds

Fear of the morbid twilight
When you will certainly die
Death, I'll give to you
You have no chance to get away

In the end of time, nothing more alive
Face of massacre, no one survive
Fragments of life, rotting thru the night
Extermination for human kind
Decimator, master of the war
Decimator, bringer of torment...

Ten thousand times, you will cry
Ten thousand years, thru warfare
Reign of destruction, people better hide
Decimating the world, better way to die

Killing in a massive attack
Feeds my terrible delight
Look at the blood in my hands
Got from the tortured deeds
Massacre... has just begun

Decimator, monarch of tomorrow
Decimator, fallen world creator
Decimator, bringer of torment
Decimatorâ¦
