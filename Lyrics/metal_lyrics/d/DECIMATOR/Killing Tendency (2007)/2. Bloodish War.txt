Age of rage - Time of fury
The war rules are:
Slaughter and genocide, Kill or die

My rage blows in fire.
Run, hide or be ready to die
I laugh at you dying with no regret

Face to face with the death
My troops marching ahead
Searching lives to take at my command

[Repeat verses]

Dead victims, skeletons,
Bloody nukes, rude bombs
Fire storms from the sky
Methodic operations
Bloodish confrontation
Torment by my hands
Brings your bloody end

Warfare, bloodshed, terror
Only sorrow was left among the war scars

My troops are marching forward to destroy
Fucking bloody army ready to annihilate
Destroying everything that stands against
Bend at me and pray loud to survive

Dead victims, skeletons
Bloody nukes, rude bombs
Fire storms from the sky
Kill with pain, Kill in vain
Kill again and again

It's time to think of another way really fast,
To take many lives and to get more than pain
Another way really fast, to take many lives...
