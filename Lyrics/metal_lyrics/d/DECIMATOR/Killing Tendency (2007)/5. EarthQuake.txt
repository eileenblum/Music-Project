Why people still believe that God can help them
We don't know what Mother Nature has stored for us
Subjugating its forces we can even get the worst
Beware of terrifying vibrations called seismic waves

Natural disasters are sweeping all over the earth
Killing innocent children, parents and devoted ones
Their holy God doesn't fall a tear for that shit

[Bridge]
Afraid of death, instead of faith.
Holy hazardâ¦ God doesn't save.
Come on and look around
Don't you hear the fucking sound?
Some people don't care
'Coz they live over a whole plate
Other ones over great fails
Pray to avoid an earthquake

[Chorus]
They never know when and never know where
EarthQuake, EarthQuake, EarthQuake
Without any warning thousands of people have to die
EarthQuake, EarthQuake, EarthQuake

We don't know what Mother Nature has stored for us
Subjugating its forces we can even get the worst
Beware of terrifying vibrations called seismic waves
Evoked by a sudden motion of fucking tectonic plates

After a natural disaster there will be some survivors
Fighting against time to save the smashed alive ones
'til there's no more time and the smell of death starts

[Repeat bridge/chorus]

China nineteen seventy six, two hundred fourty thousand died
Mexico nineteen eighty five, twenty thousand died
Iran two thousand and three, more than fifty thousand died
When is the next?
EarthQuake, EarthQuake, EarthQuake
Where will be the next?
