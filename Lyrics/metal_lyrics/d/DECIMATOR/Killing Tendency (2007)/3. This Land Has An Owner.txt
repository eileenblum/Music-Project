Back to the fucking colonial period
When Spiritual Conquest
Were reducing Indian people
To stupid Christian faith
Bravery was not enough
To avoid the Spanish slaughter
Signed in blood, innocent blood,
The Treaty of Madrid

Commanded to leave their home or to die
Leaving all they had behind
Condemned to lose their home or lives
They conformed to leave
Except by the hero one who never agreed
To surrender without any fight

It was about two hundred years ago
But no one can forget the honor of that man
Brave heart killed in the frontline of combat
An Indian who fought to defend his people
'Til the end of his life

[Chorus]
This land has owner, was his watchword
This land has owner, shout of bravery
This land has owner, fulfilled the Indian hearts
This land has owner. They fought 'til death

Hitting back bullets with just arrows and spears
Fighting back them by ambush as his best defense
He fought with no fear. He believed he could win
Against the joint armies of Portugal and Spain

Coward was the attack that he died under
Killed in ambush by the enemy army
He was buried with all his people hope
Finishing this history with a cruel end

[Repeat chorus]
