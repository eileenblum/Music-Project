Are you condemned to live in your dreams?
Are you decided to pray and to believe
Your fucking god always blessing the war
Living in hate with you pack of lies

For your self-destruction youÂ´re marching with pride
Praying for salvation and fighting with wrath
Like a parasite i see you fed by the war
Your life is sick and without any sense

Echoes in your mind bringing you to self-destruction
You courage and strength are poisoned by myths
In your book of lies: the truth you never found
Written by the human race with the blood of suffering

War!! annihilation of mankind
Hate!! you despise humanity
Praise!! the liar on the cross
Chaos!! facing your self-destruction
