We are spreading our terror and despair
Always searching for the best way to the end
Bringing all the hate to this fucking world
Nothing can stop these insane works
Shades of death are taking over me
This fucking society cannot see my reasons

Fight the war!
Live our lies!
Bleed to death!
Stand and fight!

We`ve always known that we were born to die
Pulling the trigger, proclaiming our vengeance
Ancient hate torturing our land
Blasphemies writing the history of men
Nothing divine but legends and myths
Centuries of hatred, all damned in hell

Fight the war!
Live our lies!
Bleed to death!
Stand and fight!
