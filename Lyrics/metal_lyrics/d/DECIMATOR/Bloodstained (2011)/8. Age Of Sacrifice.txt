Bringing the truth to the lie, creating calamities
The worms of sin, the plague of humanity

Behind the line there`s only death
Life denied by compassion
Losing your strength through faith
Turning the man blind

When you face the war
The fear you canÂ´t ignore
Living through your sacrifice
A thousand years of darkness

Among our silent graves
We bury the seeds of hate
Believing in blood and tears
We only instigate the war

Behind the line there`s only death
Life denied by compassion
Losing your strength through faith
Turning the man blind

Losing the sense of truth
Despising the light of justice
Trapping your feelings inside
Facing the abomination

When you face the war
The fear you canÂ´t ignore
Living through your sacrifice
A thousand years of darkness

Among our silent graves
We bury the seeds of hate
Believing in blood and tears
We only instigate the war
