War
Victory or death, crowned in blood, with no chance to escape
Say your prayers and feed the revenge, now youÂ´re hurt and bleeding
Blinded by pain, nothing can save you, your body drown in flames
Eyes wide open, mortal screams, in streams of blood

Rising through pain
You are sick and burning
Only death remains

You are broken down
With no fucking chance
To try to get away

Draining out your blood
Screaming out in pain
You know itÂ´s too late

Blood in my hands
Slicing you apart
I have no mercy

Total violence, endless pain, youÂ´ll stand no chance
Chains of fear, agony in blood, I see your pain is burning
Times of horror, violent wars, killing spree for joy
Cult of destruction, streams of blood, with no chance to escape

Violence is my way, draining out your blood, i have no remorse for mankind
Stench of decay, burning in my brains, and will send you to the grave

In streams of blood
Killing spree for joy
In streams of blood
With no chance to escape
