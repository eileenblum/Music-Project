Tonight I watch to find the next one, in the furious beating of the night
Empty hole inside, I pretend very well, And I never felt anything
Now that you're mine, fear lingers on your skin, I see panic jumping from your eyes
My world is better, anger flood the land, killing makes me feel so good

I watch, I hope .. do all right to find the next one
I keep my soul ... blacker than the night
Unable to feel .. clean and polite monster
Free of reproach.. I will make you feel the sorrow

Pretend to be human .. do it all clean, do it all right
To find the next one ... As in so many nights
I call forth the monster.. to take the control
Bringer of pain .. leaving you to die!!
