Can you see the endless hate - growing when it is time to die
Fear eroding your bones - anger blinding your eyes
Our holy war is like a plague - bringing death to the world
War is the symbol of our lives - revenge is the only way
Without pride and remorse - we must kill humanity
See the glory in destruction - war and madness we taste

Endless hate... growing in your heart
Hear my words... to fight is our disease
Growing fear... blinding your eyes
Let it be done... now it is time to die!

Find!! find the darkness in yourself
See!! the hate in every human heart
Through!! through suffering we grow
War!! bringing death to the world
