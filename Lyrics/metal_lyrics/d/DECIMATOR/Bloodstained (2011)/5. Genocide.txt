Shores washed in blood, apocalypse has begun!
Terror is Rising... Atomic Death Storm

Your brains are controlled
Prepared to live in paranoia
Winds of devastation
Leaving You to death
Brutal oppression of violence
Disorder of mind
Oppressive tactics
Blind religious flock

Time has come for extermination, crawl in the front of madness
Terror propaganda slaving your minds, preparing the man for shame
Crawl in the front of genocide, burning at the edge of madness
Another war that cannot be won, blowing winds of devastation

Spiritual genocide
A god of war and revenge
Infernal world of fear
I walk the path of death
