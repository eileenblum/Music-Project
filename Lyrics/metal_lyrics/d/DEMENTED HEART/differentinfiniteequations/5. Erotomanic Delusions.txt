The end of the dark
Value of humanity
Break the chain of nature
Pass over authority

No reflection at all
Coldness reveal our heart
There's no time to waste
There's no reason why

[2x]
May justice have not done
Without got any real knowledge
In the coil of obliteration
Trap on the progress of time
Trap on the progress of times

Mind gets narrowed
Life gets narrowed

Revolve in the world
That you made

[2x]
Why is doesn't change
Erase who dont really
Why it stays same
Deserve to survive
