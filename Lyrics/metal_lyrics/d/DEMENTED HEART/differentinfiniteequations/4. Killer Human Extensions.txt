I chop Your wings
In your birth till your end
I chop your neck
In this hell

The world full of hate
A wasteland full of ruin
Like carnivores thrive
Infect other places

The amber flame
Of shields turn me
To liberate the path
The brightest of desolate
You want leave behind 

This pain forever
Falling from grace are not
Your grace are rot
To take
Their last breath

Nourish the lie
and lust for embrace

Blade through on soul

As my abysmal vengeance 
The storm of wrath
And hatred Putrefaction

This pain forever
Falling from grace are not
Your grace are rot
To take
Their last breath

Nourish the lie
and lust for embrace
