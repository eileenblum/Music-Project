Calculate the hollow clouds
Locked in the southern vortex
Crawling from the other line
And shaded by the universe

Wheels of time run over age
Dependent from highest peak
Anger mixed with selfishness
Dropped from heyday

Loot and burn their paradise
Through the lies that bind us
Promises are full of dream
Breakdown into failure

Weapon oversee eternal enemy
Spires are grow taller
Stepped out of bounds
Died on distorted chain

Remember every little thing away
You always breathe with your own lies

This barriers are built
Only for demolished
Belies the fact
That nobody will care
