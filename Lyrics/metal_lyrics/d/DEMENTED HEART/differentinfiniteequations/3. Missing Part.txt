Lost another pieces
Delay and was deleted
Like mixed by fog
Crush deep down
Fallen into darkness

Looked some parts were gone
Break the view point of wrongness
Pass away the sense
Turned as miserable as hell

These are not scars
Expecting nothing
Or almost nothing
Shattered Forcefully

Entering dark space
Dissapear to unknown place
Gone before missing
Finally not ever part

Hidden blanket sweep up
Infect and pass away
Even the end just same
It still covering dark by cloud

Were there missing
I miss the empty parts
