This is parallel existence
For those unknowing is vain
Uncircled by unlimited dimension
Trapped in the corrosion thought

Malicious Purpose
Without Scheme

Through deep subconscious
Overthrew reality
Like life disappears
Pass but still rooted

Shades of black skies
The strenght binds all
Hang down desire
Involve infinite quantities

These equations evaluate
To infinities
Bury our mind

From an ocean of hate

These equations evaluate
To infinities
Bury our mind
From an ocean of hate

Drenched with reason
Set repetition
