Embrace The Faith
Devoid Off All Soul 
Time To Look Back
Rise From Here
Know Me Fooling
Entire Till Disapper
They Try To Run
Dont Ask Me

Why They Had To Die
One More Time
Kill You One By One
Paid All With Soul
Lost All No Change

Burning To Cleanse
Nothing To End
But make This Will End
Reduce And Removing
