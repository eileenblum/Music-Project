reduce to silence
beat down the inception
the head is removed
missing but never gone

the unseen reality
hope for being true
never be lost
even just looking for

work hard till end
invisible and hidden
vision are illution
like walking desert

but never be anything
fallen beneath uncertainly
distract from your fear
drowning death with lie

runaway the shadow
so blind you walk into
how to get what
it is much i have to beâ¦
