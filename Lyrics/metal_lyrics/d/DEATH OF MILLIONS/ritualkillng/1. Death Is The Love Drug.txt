Choking the life from my victims 
the color fades from their face 
the eyes glaze over to pale white 
the body goes limp and then stiff 
bound and gagged and tied 
to her own bed 
whimpering little bitch 
I hit with closed fist 
head falls back to reveal the throat 
titght my hands seek to end her life 
late night under twilight 
my boot to her ribs 
gasping for air she looks at me 
so I took my fist to her face 
with blood dripping from her mouth 
she goes to speak 
but her life force I'll choke out 
and each and every one 
yes I did love them all 
not one did love me 
so kill them was right you see 
because death is the love drug
