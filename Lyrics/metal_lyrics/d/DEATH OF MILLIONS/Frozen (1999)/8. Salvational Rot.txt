I miss the feel of rotting flesh
its cold form rotting with maggots
leaking yellow-green cream ooze
and that stench which burns the lungs
I've been imprisoned for the pleasures
in which I have
classified a suicidal necrophiliac
so they keep me in this sedated state
drugs supposed to cure this disease
erase the thoughts from my mind
but my desire runs too deep
too deep for them to push aside
white walls illuminated by a single 60-watt bulb
this is madness by my captors
by my captors
can't they see they're killing me
by keeping me from my freedom
I know of no other salvation
but the embrace of rot
don't think I'll survive another day
being restrained from the real thing
memories only last so long
before the essence of them is gone
pole projector needs to pulse inside of it
have to release its seed of life
only way to suppress its rage
being thrust 'til it warms
the decomposing flesh
can't they see they're killing me
by keeping me from my freedom
I know of no other salvation
but the embraces of rot
