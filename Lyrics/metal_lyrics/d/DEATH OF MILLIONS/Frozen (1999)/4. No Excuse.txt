Raped and victimized her screams ran
through my mind
I still see the look in her eyes the way she cried
it made me realize that it was too late to stop
she fought at first then I just hit with closed fist
silent she became as I did what I did
the only sound was that of quiet sobbing
I could only see... the hate inside of me
all the rage I had to release
didn't care... what she thought
only wanted... to be free
the scenes still runs through
I can smell her perfume and taste the essence of fear
feel the beating of her heart the eyes closed oh so tight
I left her there to her tears and the terror of the moment
the pain I inflicted never goes away
no signs of forced sex few cuts and bruises easy to conceal the ordeal
so young... she blamed herself
so ashamed... of what she felt
no escaping... from the pain
nightmares... until that fatal day
I could only see... the hate inside of me
all the rage... I had to release
didn't care... what she thought
