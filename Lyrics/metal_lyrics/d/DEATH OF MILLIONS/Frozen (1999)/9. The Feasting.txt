Stalking the night searching for a meal
craving the taste of human flesh
as the blood flows from the body
my eyes open wide with delight
as her screams increase
my excitement I could not
no longer keep inside
feasting on her flesh
she moves to strike me
biting down harder
the thought devloves away
tender and warm
the body lies still
motionless it awaits
what I fulfill
colder as it grows as I feast on her
primitive in my ways as I tear through
the chest opens with ease
exposed to the cold night air
her entrails start to steam
taking them from her corpse
they glisten in the moon light
I say a word of praise
