Lost... alone... confused
disillusioned down inside
as the chloroform wears off
not knowing what to do
only that you want to survive
starts to... realize... the sick... truth
surround by wood and earth
choking on your last breath
struggling to be free
as useless as you know it is
you will die here... alone
fear... terror... disbelief...
it consumes you
mind turns inward to once life
past memories of it
loneliness invades the soul
turning this coffen into home
buried alive and soon to die
too naive to see
what lies behind a man's sick eyes
sweet sweet Diane
is now never to know what love would
have truly brought
