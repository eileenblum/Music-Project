Searching... through garbage dumpsters
to find the remains
of the unwanted future
to enact my sick pleasures upon

Holding their little bodies
with both hands I grasp
pole projector in unformed skull
shall it be rammed

Abortion retrieval
unborn sodomy
abortion retrieval
cannibal scavengry

Thrusting upon it in a blind mad rage
feverishly close to blowing my gauge
screaming at the top of my lungs
I have only just begun

As blood and cum leaks from its head
I fall to knees on garbage and dead
Primitive in my own self-review
upon this aborted child I chew

Devoured until nothing is left
I begin to search through this mess
throwing trash out onto the street
as I search for another to fuck and eat
