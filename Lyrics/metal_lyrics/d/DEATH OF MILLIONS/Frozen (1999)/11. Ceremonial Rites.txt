Here on the altar of Gwestia
a sacrifice unto her
the sacred stone cursed dagger
in which the incantations are past read
request unto the hated mother
to release Jales from his torment
may the blood of this innocent one
fill the obsidian goblet
ceremonial rites... ritual of black life
vow to the beast of desire
ceremonial rites... ritual of black life
forever to indulge in
the pleasures of flesh
with the innocent Kaa
intertwined with darkness
the sweet taste of blood turns so sour
red liquid of life a thick black vapor
rising from the goblet to be taken
centuries turn through the milleniums
opening the gates that bind us down
expansion into a darker form of life
no longer held by the prison of flesh
