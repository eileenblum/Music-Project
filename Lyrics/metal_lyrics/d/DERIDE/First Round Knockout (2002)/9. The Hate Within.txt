Too far driven no way back for me
On the edge I fuel with scorn so proudly
I will die with tons of hate within
But at least I'll be myself
Knowing where I've been

The hate within
The hate within

No regrets no looking back
So far driven becoming older
But I can't fake what is inside
This inked motherfucker in war with time

The hate within
It will follow me until the day I choke
And fucking die
SUICIDE
