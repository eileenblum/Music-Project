Man machine animalistic behavior
Holy smoke unholy goat no savior
Heaven hell all the same in my life
Unbelief throughout my veins forever

A clear reflection of who I am
In pact with the strongest and fucking damned

Trends hits motherfuckers junk all bullshit
Jesus fucking Christ who needs it (not me)
Souls for sale and going cheap... again
Along with religion music and hell
Paint your face with a smile
Or save your soul with a cross
At the end of the day
When push comes to shove
We'll see who's got the balls to stay

A clear reflection of who I am
A man with no desire to fucking breed
This reflection staring back at me is all I need

Clear reflection no broken mirrors here
I know where I dwell and it's nowhere close to you
A clear reflection of who and what you are
Unlike me you will never change
