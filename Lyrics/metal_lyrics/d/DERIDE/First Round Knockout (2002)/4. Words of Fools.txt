Too scared for confrontation
Too weak to tell the truth
Instead you hide behind a mask
And speak the words of fools

Coloured by media
The shames of trendy fame
A replica of everything
Where everyone's the fucking same

Wake yourself from the slumber
Painted smiles dishonest eyes
TV-junk and politics
You're dead before you die
