I have felt this sickness crawling
Through my veins embracing death
But I told the great grim reaper
I'll see you soon but just not yet

Live while you're alive
Cause you might die tomorrow

Don't close your eyes to sleep
Until you're satisfied
We get no second chance
No judge and jury trial
We only have ourselves to blame

If we fail to try
We die in shame

Live while you're alive

We all move closer as we grow older
There is no hiding from the end
So make the most of every moment
Live while you're alive and well

Live while you're alive
