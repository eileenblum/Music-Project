Leave me alone and walk away
I don't need your kind
No rules on life no crooked sign
No cross or fascist lies
Crucified burned alive ashes of the dead
History has shown the face of true ignorance

No cross is mine
Submissive mass production
Of human slime
Insanity in function

Just turn your head around and leave
Your face makes me sick
So insecure and corrupted
For someone else you bleed

No cross is mine
Submissive mass production
Of human slime
Insanity in function
