Inhale the leafs of glory
A mouthful of sin
Taste the drops of whiskey
The devil marks my skin
No second chance when dying
To live out the undone
And this is how I choose to fly
Until the day I'm dead and gone

Life before death
Life before death
I hail the domination

Another breath of beauty
Another glass of jack
Pure horror on my TV
They all go back to back
I choose this path for myself
Don't care what's right or wrong
In this state there's only me
And images of bloody gore

Life before death
Life before death
I hail the domination

Born this way and die the same
Purely horrified
Life before death
No afterlife
