Pure alcoholic insanity fuel the hate within
Blinding rage psychosis bloodred fists and skin
Swollen knuckles Sunday morning
A first round knockout fight
Memories of putrid shapes
Revealed behind closed eyes

Don't come near me just walk away
Grind this life over again
First round knockout
Countless more to go

Drunk and high all over hating with no friends
Paranoid but honest the truth is surfacing

Don't come near me just walk away
Grind this life over again
First round knockout
Countless more to go

Self inflicted horror and rage to overcome
Bringing pain and sorrow to my closest ones

First round knockout
Countless more to go
First round knockout
Countless more to come
