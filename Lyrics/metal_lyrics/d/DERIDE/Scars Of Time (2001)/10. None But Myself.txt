Anger rise I'm at war slit my wrists when I'm bored
Public's eyes disapprove can't tell me what to do
Long have I seen you fail try so hard it's a shame
How you all try to be so much more than what you

ARE, WEAK, FALSE, WRONG

Suicide not ashamed blast my head none to blame
Why should I live to see cancer age eating me
I'll decide my own death I won't choke in no bed
Weak and grey fill of AIDS rather eat razorblades

I'LL OUTLIVE YOU

I don't need to act like you do never have and  never will
Cause why should I even try when I don't mind being ME

I DON'T FUCKING CARE (About none but myself)
