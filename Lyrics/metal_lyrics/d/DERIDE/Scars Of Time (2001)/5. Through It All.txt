A life in pale white skin the cross reversed to sin
Fed up with your purity your fake smiles and lies
I breathe blasphemy black blood runs through me
Noone or nothing will ever change this

(You show me the cross and I) Shake my head down
(You speak to me but then I) Turn my head around and walk

Beneath this tattooed skin time heals nothing
High on gore, booze, pornography expose the real me
I embrace the feeling when needles pierce my flesh
Carve the devil in me like an eternal symbolic rash

(You show me the cross and I) Shake my head down
(You speak to me but then I) Turn my head around and walk
(I show you the horns with pride) With my head high
(I curse and laugh while I) Taste the world of mine

I go through my hell alone, leaving thoughts where they belong
I go through my hell alone, speaking words that are my own
Live through it all... STRONG
