Cast away the holiness in you I hate preaching
Big prejudice so sickening
On your knees and crawling before your God and calling
As soon as the real world comes knocking on your door

Obey the written words of ancient times
CAST FROM THEE

Cast away dishonesty in your I see passing time
Living through a book of lies
You'll never see me judging another man for wanting
To drink and fuck and curse and to be human

Words unwritten cries in present times
CAST FROM THEE

Drown unwritten words in present times
CAST FROM THEE
