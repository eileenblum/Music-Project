I can't get no sleep, this life choking me
Hate everything and everyone, all the time
Pictures in my head, I see this world dead
All sentenced to die by my hand, again and again

I grind my teeth in anger, close my eyes sick to my stomach
When will I get through another day
Without these thoughts of killing someone else when...

I wage a damn war, enemies be gone
So tried of this hatework, drenching me
Pictures of you dead, impaled in my head
Along with the hate I feel for this damn world

I grind my teeth in anger, close my eyes sick to my stomach
When will I get through another day
Without these thoughts of killing someone else I...

Don't know, don't care
Live wrong, die wrong

When will I get through another day
Without these thoughts of killing someone else
