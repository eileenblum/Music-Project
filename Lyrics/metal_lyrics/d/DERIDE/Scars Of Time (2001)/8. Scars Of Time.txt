(I have tasted death and spit it out)
Scars of time left on my skin along with those I've kept within
Knowing some will never heal they're filled with salt to keep me real

(Well aware that it will be back)
Broken promises I live while my best friend dies
I no longer even try to find an explanation as to why

Conquering
Scars tells where I've been
Conquering
On the skin of missing limbs

SCARS OF TIME
