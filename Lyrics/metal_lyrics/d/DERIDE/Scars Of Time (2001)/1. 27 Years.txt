A man with a mind set on trend genocide
Fulci, friends and bottles of booze I inhale
All my time I spend right beside my own kind

27 Years and I still care

Fulci and friends with a beer in my hand
Watching the dead eat the living again
All my life I've spent time taking pride in who I am and all about

27 Years Horror and beer

Time spent believing
What my eyes keep seeing
Living through cannibals, zombies and horror
Age 27 I know I'll never make time for fashion: I hail the passion
Living until the day I die knowing its all mine
And all my life I've taken pride in who I am and all about

THE PASSION KEEPS ME ALIVE
