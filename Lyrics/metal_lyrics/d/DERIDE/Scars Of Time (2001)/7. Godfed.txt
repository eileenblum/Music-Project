I don't need you motherfuckers breathing down my neck praying
I don't need the motherfucking bullshit you are preaching
For 25 years I've seen you treat so wrongly those unlike you

Crucify you
Crucify yourself
When you try to force your Christ on me

I don't need you motherfuckers staring while saying
I will go to hell if I don't care about your religion
Let me tell you this again hell is where I hope my soul ends up

When I die I'll crucify myself
When you try to force your Christ on me

Prayers won't save you when I come for you
God can't touch me cause I see right through you
All the lies your cross beholds your damn words are getting old
