Without the will, without the strength
There's nothing left but the weaker fool
Strip yourself from fairy tales
Rise above the common level

Without the lies you would be falling
Leaving behind real people crawling

Paralyzed, kneeling down
Searching for truth within a lie
Disagree complicate
The things I see harvest hate

Without the lies you would be falling
Leaving behind real people crawling... ON THEIR KNEES

Driven to perversion
