Judging me by the way I look will only prove you wrong
There is so much more than meets the eye below
This decorated skin and core

If you dig a little deeper beneath your painted smile
You will find there's more to this world than
Trends hits and superstars

Stereotyped black and white and nothing in between
Comaborn just a weak and shallow slave
High on MTV

If you look a little further beneath your painted eyes
You will find there's more to this world than
Fashion and Britney Spears

COMABORN

If you search a little longer before you start to cry
You will find there's more to this world than
Kid Rock and jealous lies
