Nothing, nothing or noone will ever be like me
Stronger, crushing all trendy fools trying to be what I am

A big mouth doesn't make you a man

Slowly, I burn all the bridges that leads to frustration
Knowing, no time will be wasted on wannabe-fools anymore

Only the truth can bury a lie

There is so much to gain
On goodbyes and sin

I look into your eyes reflecting your whole life
Trying hard to be like the ones who bleed... WITH ME

If you don't feel if you're not worth my time
You can't fake it, it's born with you or... IT'S NOT

A big mouth doesn't make you a man
