[Music by Vold &amp; Frode 1993-97, Arr. by Vold, lyrics by Vold]

We are the lanterns of grief
come forth and visit us
we have stories to tell
and knowledge to share

A calm of distant decay
deep in absorbing shades
the heavens darken,
the oceans fall

The oceans of thoughts
the rivers of blood
cast into the starless void

She streches across
the rivers of blood
to vipe out my last vivid pictures

Alone
in this oblivious zone
a place of no return
Eternity, I roam

Lady Ablaze
Dress me in flames
See me burn in shame
Were horrors breed on the light

She streches across
the rivers of blood
to vipe out my last vivid pictures

We are the lanterns of grief
come forth and visit us
we have stories to tell
and knowledge to share

We hear them come
we close our eyes
and see them closing in
they flash into our souls
we see them shining through

Lady Ablaze
Dress me in flames
See me burn in shame
Were horrors breed on the light

Dressed in fire
the laterns of grief
when the horrors
they breed on the light
oceans of thoughts
the rivers of blood
we are burning
in the deep of the night
