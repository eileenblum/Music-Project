[Music &amp; Arr. Vold &amp; Ole 1997, lyrics by Vold]

In a city of tranquilled hearts
Breathe only the thoughts I shun
You stole my ferocity
You stole my gain
Now I?m lost
in your nothingness again

My eyes have been shut
and my tongue seared to dust
My hands they tremble no more
For now as your blood is at groans
Thoughts are painted in gore

I reach for the dangger
She crawles towards the door
Tears are written in blasphemy
as thoughts are painted in gore

The blade cuts through her vivid flesh
Her screams soar through the night
My mind is forged with lunar dust
I shiver with murderous lusts

How did I merge this abandoned place
Can you see those lights ahead?
So lonely in this massive darkness...
