[Music by Kristoffer Austrheim &amp; Ole Helgesen.]
[Lyrics by Ole Helgesen]

Thousands of years have passed, still we do not know
Oh tell me, please tell me, what lies beyond our comprension
We are nothing but autumn leaves swirling in the circles of time
Haunted by the shadow in our past

Time won't sweep away, our deepest scars of memories
It will carry them along eternally
Betrayed by the enigma of existence
Yet, we admire this insignificance

Oh shameful (shameful)
Pathethic (pathethic)
The Fairy's Voice (duet Vocals-Keys)

dum - dum dum dum dum - dum dum dum - dum dum dum
dum - dum dum dum dum - dum dum dum - dum dum dum

(uhmm)
Shhh !!!

Listen carefully, to the sound of an evening breeze
And the sound of a thousands rivers, strugging towards the sea
But all is so dead and silent
Yes, this way it's got to be

[sound of thousands rivers]

Time won't sweep away, our deepest scars of memories
It will carry them along eternally
Time won't sweep away, our deepest scars of memories
It will carry them along eternally
Time won't sweep away, our deepest scars of memories
It will carry them along eternally...
