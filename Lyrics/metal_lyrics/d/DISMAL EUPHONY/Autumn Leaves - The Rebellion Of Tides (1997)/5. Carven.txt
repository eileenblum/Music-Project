[Lyrics by Keltziva]

A world like this
We never before have seen
A prism in which the shadows are all dispelled
"The light is scarpened ! All that remains is the light"

We do not seek to be source of your spells of sadness
I seek and i find my power to creation, deliberation to expulsion
Do not sense, but see, my falsification
We are not so far away from home, we are leaving again...

Are you the one who will bleed my tears... or will bleed my tears
Or will my enchantement burst once again ?
Burst under your horrific words ?

"As long as there is life... there is hope for an end...
as long as there is life... there is hope for an end"

While i know this, i do longer know all there is, the taste of blood...
