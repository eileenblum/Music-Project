[Music by Kristoffer Austrheim.]
[Lyrics by Ole Helgesen]

A passion of tears...
Close my soul... as i reach for your caress
Let me die in your flesh
While the heavenly bodies burn out before your eyes

Let me die and die again !

Taste my blood with emotional lust
Let your touch embrace my mind
Show me a hidden path to the source of wisdom
You are the rose on my grave

Traces of flames made of ice
Never, never... never !!!
No, no !!!
Iaaahhhi

My river in which the dawn never shows
...Is hope hiding
Blood of my past... is still dripping
Simply dead !!!

Show me a hidden path to the source of wisdom
You are the rose on my grave...
You are the rose on my grave...
