[Music &amp; Lyrics by Kristoffer Austrheim]

With neither speech nor portrayals
He gazed up towards infinity's face
And as aloft the circles he rose,
A sudden breath of dark forgotten dreams came true

For never had he entered the fiery gates,
The mirror passage entry, to another existance... to another plane
With neither speech nor portrayals
He gazed up towards infinity's face

And as aloft the circles he rose,
A sudden breath of dark forgotten dreams came true
Above the circles emerged another dream...
For no man of mortal shell could know, where or when this planet existed...

He drifted and saw stars, sweep across the sky...
He saw suns perish... he saw visions rise from emerald darkness...
And lunar moonlit seas
A thousand years and then a thousand moons...
