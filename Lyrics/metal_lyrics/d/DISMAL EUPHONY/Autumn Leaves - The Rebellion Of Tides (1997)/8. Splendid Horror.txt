[Lyrics by Ole Helgesen &amp; Kristoffer Austrheim]

To these pale spectres dwelling in the blackness of my sins
I behold her swirling tounge floating in my swart lake
I can almost touch her limbs

Cloaked beneath her woes, i found my nothingness
withered among the pity.. it was dead

Splendid horror, splendid horror
Splendid horror, splendid horror

The blood-red water drives me into ecstasy
I scream of pleasure as i crawl down to her
Even though they fainted, there is really nothing to fear !!!

[now go till 8.03 of the song and ear the rest...]
