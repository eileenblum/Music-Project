[Music &amp; Lyrics by Kristoffer Austrheim]

We who run from the presence of the sun
By the voived bitter gleam chasing darkness like a dream
All with weary tasks fordone 'scape the serpents tounge
All with weary tasks fordone 'scape the serpents tounge

To catch the shadow, let the substance fall
(in remembrance of a shroud)
Like the sun's bright beam entangled in melancholy
(in remembrance of a shroud)
Entangled in the black roars of an image's stream
(in remembrance of a shroud)
Of an-of an-of an image's stream
(in remembrance of a shroud)

Now i find hideousness in mind shall i disturb this hallowed house ?
I have been sent with dusk before to sweep the dust behind the door
I have been sent with dusk before to sweep the dust behind the door
Put the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud
the match agreed - with flames admired
