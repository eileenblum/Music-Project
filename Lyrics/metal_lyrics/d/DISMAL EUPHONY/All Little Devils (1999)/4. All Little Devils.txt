[Music &amp; Lyrics by Ole Helgesen]

Rise and shine in the night
My pride salutes me, until I fall
The wicked children praise my name,
then writes it in the morning sky
All litlle devils are dancing in ecstacy
Inspired by the taste of horror
Proud to be insane forever
Proud to be insane
Let out the killer in me
Raise your hands above your head
Close your eyes and you'll be dead
Broken dreams of insanity
Anger will be my victory
Inspired by the taste of horror
Proud to be insane forever
Proud to be insane
Let out the killer in me!
