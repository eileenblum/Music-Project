[Music &amp; Lyrics by Kristoffer Austrheim]

Shine for me, misery
Devils rapture their coils
Suffer the fathomless end
Until we parche, with sermons, again
Strangle me slowly
Enter my palace of pain
Cover your screams
'Cause the wind will carry all your words away
Pass me the bottle
Pass me the venomous wine
Pass me this deadly brew
And I will drink and die, again
Shine for me lust and thorns
Compromise carven in suns
Hatred of my own feet
I will never be able to walk this ground, again
The rain has waited too long, too long
Pass me the bottle and i will drink and die, again
Shine for me, Misery!!!
