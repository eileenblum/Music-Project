[Music &amp; Lyrics by Kristoffer Austrheim]

Come alone horrid eyes
Bone from bone, sigh to sigh
In all dying there is a certain beauty
To travel the seas of temptation
And the velvet skies of pain
Sodomize the sacred in the velvet skies of pain
Lightning the fuse of death
We march towards the twilight
In apocalypse and pain
Never to see the light of day again
And when the birds of burning flesh return
Ye shall arise from the ashes, as Gods, and burn and burn...
