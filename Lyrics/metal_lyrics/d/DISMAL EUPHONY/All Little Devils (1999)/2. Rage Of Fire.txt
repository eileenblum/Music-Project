[Music by Kristoffer Austrheim; Lyrics by Ole Helgesen]

Sweet child, I wish you were dead
Sweet child, I wish you were dead
Dry your eyes now, little one
Shut up and listen, hear the screams in the night
Rage of fire
Rage in the night
Dry your eyes now, little one
My rage grows stronger, so burn!!
Like a hunted child, alone
Face my demons of falling desire
Rage of fire
Rage in the night
Dry your eyes now, little one
The flames get higher, so burn!!
Look up to the sky
Do you see the flaming eyes, watching you?
Can you feel their anger?
Let the madness lead you
No compass on this earth
Shows my direction
