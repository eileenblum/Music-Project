Crazed neck held tightly in my hands face grows red swells expands
Cough and gasp eyes filled with fear mind races ringing in your ears
Try to cry there is no escape gripped in fear feel the rape
This sickness that I do now cannot stop the trigger is crazed

Instinct now you know lying still face down in sweat body fails
You might be dead lust raging I cannot control while I hear your last death moan
The over mastered desire of life's archaic response tasting your fear is all my lust wants
