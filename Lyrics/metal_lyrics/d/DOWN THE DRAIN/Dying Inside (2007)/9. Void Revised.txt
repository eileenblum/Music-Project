Time again for me to rise unleash the pain from deep inside
Time again for me to rise from deep down inside
Uncovered what is buried the part of me that has strayed
Why not leave me alone instead leave me for dead
How could you have ever known I'm alive and waiting to be fed

So many want me dead yet cannot hold me down they don't want to ever hear that my life still shakes loud
Pretenders laid to waste shallow words empty lies again there is me again they all must die
Why should I die because you said it is so I can never end my blood still it flows
Take it all from me, for your meagre gain in plain sight to see, yet know only pain now again I am alive
Everything that I am stripped down by your greed once more I must rise above darkness will reign free
Far to late to stop it now this course has been set cringe in fear and know this now you'll meet your end
