Played for a fool left to hang on your every word
Trust means nothing to you why are my feelings absurd
I come to you bearing my soul you laugh think you control
The one that I believe is the one that will deceive
I want nothing in return I give you all, all that is me
Never enough so I shall burn all I am, you will never see
The one that will deceive you will always deceive

Unconditional because I give a shit never a doubt you know this still you try to play me out why
When I am the one there for you always yet you make your fucking plays
Afraid of what I am afraid to ruin your plans
I've had enough of this shit being me is never enough I know who I am
Fuck you end to end you will always deceive
