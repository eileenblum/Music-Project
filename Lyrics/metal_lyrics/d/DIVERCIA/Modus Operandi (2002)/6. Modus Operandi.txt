On the edge of my sanity reality and dream are the same. 
This endless nightmare keeps me awake at nights.
Could someone catch me quick before I do it again
and every night I live that moment again.

And I've been...

Gripped by a quiet grief. Like a touch of insanity
but what have I become? I'm just trying to set them free.
I am feeling no remorse and I could be the one you dream,
I could be anyone (Hate my only source of power)

Catch me now as I fantasize as I read the lines as I memorize as I live that moment again.
I visualize and internalize, realize as I read the lines that I have become that monster I was afraid.
Every now when I hide myself, knowing that I would be found myself in the shadows of your room.
Catch me now as I fantasize as I read the lines as I memorize that I have become that monster I was afraid.

Just a flash of humanity, some prefer punishment
This time I will truly set you free.

And I've been...

Gripped by a quiet grief. Like a touch of insanity
but what have I become? I'm just tring to set them free.
I am feeling no remorse and I could be the one you dream,
I could be anyone (Hate my only source of power)

Catch me now as I fantasize as I read the lines as I memorize as I live that moment again.
I visualize and internalize, realize as I read the lines that I have become that monster I was afraid.
Every now when I hide myself, knowing that I would be found myself in the shadows of your room.
Catch me now as I fantasize as I read the lines as I memorize that I have become that monster I was afraid.
