She never could not find a way to tell His image the truth
There's simply nothing more she can give, she wants only to be free
No she's waiting for the end to come and to erase those last memories
She's falling in her grace and embracing the dark

When she felt she could not hold on in the middle of it all
A lonely soul trapped inside of her, there's nothing more she can give
She's staring up to see that face that could explain it all
As memories they come and the mark that explains it all

She's falling in her grace, the mark explains it all
She's falling in her grace and embracing the dark
She's falling in her grace... like God's only child

The cross has lost its grip on her soul there's nothing more she can give
Engravings on her skin and the mark that explains it all

She's falling in her grace and embracing the dark
She's falling in her grace... like God's only child
