Another hollow race, designed to rule this world.
Like cancer in her cell's, we inted to grow.
And the road starts where the other ends, and in our heart's beginning is the end.

... and under this sun, we who are one
... and under this sun, we must unite
(become like planeteer)

... another sorrowed mind like dying God's art.
We move back instead of forward as death do us apart.
And the road starts where the other ends, and in our heart's beginning is the end

... and under this sun, we who are one
... and under this sun, we must unite
Wheter to burn or unite, sleeping forever like mortal designs.
To become brighter than the sun, to believe we could be as one...
Or to get lost into the sun
