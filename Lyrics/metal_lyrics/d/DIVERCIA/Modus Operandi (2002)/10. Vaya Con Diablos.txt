Your left alone in this Godforsaken place with no place to hide or go
As I step inside your world the darkness feeds your eyes and you are too blind to see me there
Please forgive my means, because I must take your soul, believe in me, I am as real as it gets
Now take my hand and lay besides me and here we go again... under your skin

And everytime they disappear...
They think that this time they are so near

I will make a whisper out of your hair, I will make a black rose from your despair
Now take my hand and have a little faith in me and I will make all your dreams come true
Please forgive my means, because I must take your soul, believe in me, I am as real as it gets
I won't tell you lies, the truth, the dreams because I am all of them

And everytime they disappear...
They think that this time they are so near
