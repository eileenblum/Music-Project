Forgive us father because we must sin again
Black as my heart is the Devil's only love
Don't get too close or you will burn alive
as tears fall down my cheeks they turn into blood.

Every night I slowly drain our thoughts away
Black is betrayal of a friend, the color of this heart
And I want nothing but this warmth of my friend,
to be touched by him again, I wear the mark of love

In your life you truly found the other day,
we are trying to hold on and trying to forgive.
You lived your life like there was no other day.
We couldn't just foresee or to forgive.

On my way to madness infernal visions ahead of me
Crippled thoughts arrive, I'll think I'm going insane,
as my vision blurs and fades away

Down in this land where the evil rests it's hands
Fire and brimstone, down here we belong
The shadows on our walls they tell us what to do
Forgive but don't forget and we die only to live
