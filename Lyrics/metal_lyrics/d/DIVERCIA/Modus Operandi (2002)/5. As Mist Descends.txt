Farewell me love, for it is time to go.
Fear not my love, for we shall meet again.
And who knows what it is to be in the dark?
'Cause the one that separates this darkness has scarred my soul
I am alone (in the dark)

Reach out your hands and be the one,
to hide oneself from this pain and my sacred love.
And who knows what it is to be in the dark?
'Cause the one that separates this darkness has scarred my soul
I am alone (in the dark)

Farewell my love, we shall meet again, I'll wait for you
Farewell my love, we shall see again and 
Fear not my love... we shall be one again
