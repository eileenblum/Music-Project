Deep inside the heart and through my ears the voices are whispering
If you don't evolve you'll cease to exist as an object of recreation
The sound of silence awakens me and it feels I'm dying again
Like the creature born from the sin, I am moved by the hands of my God

The violent storm keeps raging down, to me life and death are the same
Away from the light and into enslave like the dust that must move again
I am commanded by hate without a will, as an object of recreation
Away from the dream of what will it be, let this world be drowned in its grief

Reincarnation of a man. Distilled through a pile of dirt.
Shed a tear and let this world be drowned in its greed.

Deep inside the heart and through my ears the voices are whispering
If you don't evolve you cease to exist as an object of recreation

We slowly cease to exist as an object of recreation
