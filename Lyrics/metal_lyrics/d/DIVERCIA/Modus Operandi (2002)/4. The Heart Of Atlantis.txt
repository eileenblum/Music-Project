Hey little lonely girl take a part of the game, I doubledare you would race me until the end
Turn around and take a look at this place, can you feel the ocean inside your veins?
Cold water it cuts us down like a knife, trust me this pain is part of our afterlife
(Trust me every pain gets to be a pleasure)

Hey little serpent skin take a part of this thing, I beg you to shed your black skin
Please take a part of this game, I doubledare you to race me until the end
And aren't you glad you did not turn on the lights when everyone we love is on the otherside.

This is our brand new beginning and surely the quickest way of getting out
The paradise is not lost... it's only forgotten
We should join them now and be so free
The end is not so bad, it will make you see

Hey little lonely girl, place your bets to this game, I doubledare you to play it until the end
Turn around and take a look at this place, can you feel this ocean inside your veins?
When all is lost and there's nothing to gain... the pain gets to be a pleasure.
And aren't you glad you did not turn on the lights when everyone we love is in the otherside.
