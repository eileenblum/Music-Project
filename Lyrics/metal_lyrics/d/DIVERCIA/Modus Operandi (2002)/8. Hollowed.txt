What was once for real and what was once shall come again, into the fire it shall end as it always does.
It's what could be, what will be, what was past and what is yet to come, this thing so unreal.
Go down to the end of time, where the sun rides above my skies and destruction.
Watch the flame as the as the candle dies, watch it dance reflected in your eyes.

Into the gloomy depths of lie, we exist only to see.
We are alone, we are those fallen ones, we exist only to dream.

What was once surreal and things so unreal shall be again... it shall come again
What was once surreal and what was then shall come again
Into to the dust it will end as it always does
It's what could be, what will be, what was past and what is yet to come, this thing so unreal, a thing that we'll never see...
(Trust me and become God's size)
