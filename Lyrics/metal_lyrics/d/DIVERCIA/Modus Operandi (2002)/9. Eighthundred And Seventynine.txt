This untold story was ment for us but we don't know where it stops
To wake up all alone and to realize we are going to fade away 

And in this life we truly drain our thoughts away
Like figures in the dark, there is nothing we are afraid of
We are reaching out for light to find an endless day
And to realize we were built to lose anyway

We are drifting through the sea of pain
There is nothing for us to gain
To slowly cross the line and realize we are slowly dying away

And in this life we truly drain our thoughts away
Like figures in the dark, there is nothing we are afraid of
We are reaching out for light to find an endless day
And to realize we were built to lose anyway

Tell me, why should I go on
Show me the meaning of it all
Please show me the way!
