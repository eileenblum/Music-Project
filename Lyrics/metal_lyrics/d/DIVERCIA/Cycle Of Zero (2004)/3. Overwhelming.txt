A violent aftertaste,
these cuts and scars from yesterday.
Greetings from one who's raging,
ripping it's way out of it's cage.

I got so high on power as the adrenaline feeds the beast.
No use to struggle with yourself, cut your halo.

The taste of battles fought, and this losing ground.
Are just my cuts and scars from yesterday!

I just can't stop it; the adrenaline feeds the beast inside of me!
Listen to one who is raging, ripping it's way out of your cage!

You fought so hard against it all.
Now your little heart feeds your loser god.
No use to struggle with yourselves.
Let my knife guide you.

A violent aftertaste,
these cuts and scars from yesterday .
1000 tales to tell, nightmares and dreams.
No use to struggle with yourself, cut your halo
Some battles fought, some wins to come.
In this world of... pain.
