Wandering through the nations
I get this weird hallucination...

That I'm alright?

Detaching from the patience...
This is my lack of concentration!

The Cycle of Zero...
There is...
No other place to go...
This is...
The Cycle of Zero...
My way...
No other place to go - and I feel fine!

Searching all the places
I place myself before them all!

And that's so sweet.

Retarded from the patience
This is my triumph of concentrations.

I'm a trophy of gods.

Then one day I stare, I stare at the sun...
And there is no-one to see that I'm gone.

One day I gaze, I gaze at the moon...
And there is no one to judge what I've done.

I found this before you...
I found this before you...

Detaching from the patience
This is my lack of concentration.

And I feel fine!

Wandering through the nations
I place myself above them all.

I'm on my way.

Then one day I stare, I stare at the sun
And there is no-one to see that I'm gone.

One day I gaze, I gaze at the moon
And there is no one to judge what I've done.

I found this before you...
I found this before you...
