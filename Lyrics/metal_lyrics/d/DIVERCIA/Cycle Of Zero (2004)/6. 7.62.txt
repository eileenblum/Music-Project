(Seven... Sixty-two...)

"Escaping reality as we shatter down in pieces...
Oh and the way we struggle for the throne must come to an end,
As those who are under its... spell!"

This heritage of life itself, it will not come for free.
And all this time we wonder how, just how can we make them the same.
The same old tale just passed us by, this tale "that is not real."
In form of slugs, it truly speaks, and this is how I feel...

Like 7.62!
I'm loading myself... with 7.62!

Please try to hide your real intentions and all those wasted ideas.
The dead shall march, now on and on this portrait of our dreams.
The same old man just passed us by, they say "this cannot be real."
In form of slugs, they truly speak, and this is how they feel...

Like 7.62!
I'm loading myself... with 7.62!

Oh how I feel, remains of a mankind so scarred and their losing ideas...
