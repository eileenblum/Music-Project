My mind says no, but the flesh is too weak.
I could have left and walked away, but I'm afraid I'm not that strong.

Where should we start?
How about from the end?
Why not leave?
No, after all I just want you to feel the same...

Gripping your pillow tight, six ways to keep me away.
But if you fail to use them all, I'm there and I'm willing to stay.

You built me an early grave, and part of me had died.
I buried you inside of my heart, next to our weeping willow tree.

Search hard and you might find this endless guilt that rapes your mind.
You should have just walked away; I'm glad I'm not that strong.

Gripping your pillow tight, six ways to keep me away.
But if you fail to use them all, I'm there and I'm willing to stay.

Gripping your pillow tight, six ways to keep me away.
But if you fail to use them all, I'm there and I'm willing to stay.
