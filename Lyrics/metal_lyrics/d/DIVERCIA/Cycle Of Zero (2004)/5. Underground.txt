A traveler from another dimension, forced to live his life-sentence.
He climbed at the top of the clouds; fell again, 5 miles south of heaven.

And now they want to be his friends again.
And now they are lending their helping hands to him.

(It's not that easy) This is a time for reckoning!

He saw his life in form of cunning words. (That day he struck a nerve.)
And claim the throne by falling down to hell, 5 miles south of heaven...

Now they want to be on his side again.
He has come to claim what belongs to you.
You don't want to waste your breath on him.
Tim rules the throne, a time for reckoning.

And now they want to be on his side again.
He has come to claim the gift that belongs to you.
It's time for Tim to claim the first prize...

Now his the master of the skies.
Absolute power gone wrong.
You don't want to waste your breath on him.
Tim rules the throne, a time for reckoning.

Now they want to be on his side again.
He has come to claim what belongs to you.
You don't want to waste your breath on him.
Tim rules the throne, a time for reckoning.
