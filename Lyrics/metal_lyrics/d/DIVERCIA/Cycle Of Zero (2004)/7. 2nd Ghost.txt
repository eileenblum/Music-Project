I tried to say, he's in misery!
Just the one, oh my lonely one,
Another mirror, another reflection!

He died today, and I tried to say,
Just a word, he was the last one of us!
Another time, another reaction!

Help us to find a way to tear down this cradle,
A man darkened by the God himself.

Regrets are wounds and I know just what they're made of.
Sunshine warming all but one... please let him go.

There was a time, he walked the line,
easy path, shortcut, don't be last!
Another route, another direction!

I tried to say, he would die today!

Help us to find a way to tear down this cradle,
A man darkened by the God himself.

Regrets are wounds and I know just what they're made of.
Sunshine warming all but one... please let him go.

Help us to find a way to tear down this cradle,
A man darkened by the God himself.

Regrets are wounds and I know just what they're made of,
Sunshine warming all but one... OH PLEASE LET HIM GO!
