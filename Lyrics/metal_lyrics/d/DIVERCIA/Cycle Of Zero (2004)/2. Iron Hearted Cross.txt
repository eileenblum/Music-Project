Cross your heart and hope to die?
These are the words and your lies.
Goddamn this night and your brand new world.
Where is the flame that burns still bright?
I spent one hour dying hard.
I pushed and shoved until I cried.
Not because of you or the world I've seen.

A little crack in the sky so bright,
reveals the truth of useless time.
I'm just so lost without you all.
My wasted years of denial.

Wake up the angels inside you,
invite the demon that loves us all.
Goddamn this mind that is full of hate,
ride my everlasting war.

Tell me what to do,
I have trained myself for you.
Through the flames of hell,
suffered inside my shell.

Shot cold so many times,
I have lived among your lies
Through the flames of hell,
suffered inside my shell

Wake up the dead besides you,
invite the fire that greets us warm.
Goddamn these needles that take me away,
ride my everlasting war.

A little crack in the sky so bright,
reveals the truth of useless time.
I'm just so lost without you all.
