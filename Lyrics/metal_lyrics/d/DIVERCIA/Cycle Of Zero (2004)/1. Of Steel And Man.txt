This world I know approaches its absolute... turning point.
As a man crawls away from his grave.
Strangers welcome into our High-Tech Age...
Into my self-preserving days!

I have fought for many reasons.
I have lost myself into this reason.
Condemned, perhaps for the last time.
Countdown my second last ride!

Just keep those eyes closed and watch another "man" arise.
Transformed he doesn't feel at all.
I'm planting the seeds of life, the steel acts like flesh itself.
Allowing the dead to rise again!
To rise again!

Upgrading man with steel!
Countdown my second last ride!
He doesn't feel at all!
My sweet unhuman beings!

Under the blackened skies, through the nightmares they'll come for you,
My sweet unhuman beings.
This feelings growing, I'm reborn and my body is showing a new life!
It's here for me!
100 years and you shall see!

I have fought for many reasons, in my self-preserving days.
And this is my personal... turning point.
My wireless way of saying I love myself to death.
My sweet unhuman beings!

Reborn!
Upgrading man with steel!
Countdown my second last ride!
He doesn't feel at all!
My sweet unhuman beings!
