A rainy Sunday night, a little man still fights...
Hey please! He's on his knees!
He traded God for gold, and master got his soul, won't you see!
While he bleeds!

He doesn't want to feel, what has become too real, he falls a sleep... in devil's arms!
The earth's crust opens up, the end justifies the means... God for gold!

What you see is how they'll bleed; all for one... One for all!

A pile of ash on the ground, he's gone, there is no sound...
This cannot be... "We had a deal?!"
He traded God for gold, now his master got his soul,
But can't you see?! While he bleeds!
Another tomorrow, growing greed; lost his life for a useless dream.

He doesn't want to feel, what has become too real, he falls a sleep... in devil's arms!
What you see is how they'll bleed; all for one... And one for all!
