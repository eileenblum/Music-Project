Obliterate christian mentality
Torture and salughter maliciously
They only wish it was a dream
Leaving their souls in agony

Reverent life living despair
Lying god compelled
Deceptive belief unanswered prayers
Deadly belief the fools ensnared!!

Crucified condemned to die
Behold the hatred in the eye
Slowly lashing beating down
Hang Christ up and bear crown
Opposing preachers blessed faith
Converts of our vicious sect
Balance in the behalf
The world's cosmic battle!!

Obliterate christian mentality
Torture and salughter maliciously
They realize it's not a dream
We left their souls in agony

Reverent life living despair
Lying God repelled
Deceptive belief unanswered prayers
deadly belief the cross they bear!!!

Crucified condemned to die
Behold the hatred in the eye
Slowly lashing beating down
Hang Christ up and bear our crown
Opposing preachers blessed faith
Converts of our vicious sect
Balance in the behalf
Deadly deception!!
