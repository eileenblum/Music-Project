Devastate
Evolution of our planet
When the age of man will be erased
From negliegence of distant past
Extinction Level Event!!

Eradicate
Cast away the mass appeal
As burning rock falls from the sky
Scales of time weigh our fate
Prayers to heaven cannot save!!

Dust and ash
Deadly rain
Land swallowed by tidal waves
Lifeless bodies
Drift out to sea
No atmosphere left to breath

Extinction Level Event!!

Technology
Warnings of the coming days
Shelters built in mountains deep
Voyage from unknown regions
Ruthless violence nature brings!!

Disaster
Panic stricken world
Destruction!

Massive graves
Eternal darkness reigns
Annihilation!!!

Omission
Of fallen mortals cease
Perpetual demise!

Barren plains
Universal cycle complete
Elimination of all humanity!!!
