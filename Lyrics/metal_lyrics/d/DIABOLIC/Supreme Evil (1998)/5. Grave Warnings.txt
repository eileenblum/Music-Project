Predestinations of the world
lies lost, ill-fated doings
Global sickness, raging plagues
unceasing remnants

Premonitions are clear to see
few futile attempts to savior
Foreboding fear is insufferable
the time, the end prevails
Foreboding fear is insufferable!

Insufferable!

From the Dark bowers of holy
man's domain
Is the ruthlessness
action of mortality

Predestinations of the worlds,
profilitions of war
Fear dogmatic mass hate
heed grave warnings!!!
