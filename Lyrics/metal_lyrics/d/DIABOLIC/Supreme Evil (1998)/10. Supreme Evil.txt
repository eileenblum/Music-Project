The second comig
spewing forth the arrival
Has not been seen
in blacken years
and eruption
Predicten by elder wisdom
the Almighty
Doing forth
with battle
with fury

The fires burning
from the throne
the evident
The baptismal of hatred
is obliterating

From chambers of blasphemy
the mystic crimes
Chorus of ungodly howls
fearing lamb screams

Utopia through lust
carnal in nature
Subjugate the goddess
mesmerized by pleasure
Anoint the unholy
cursed and consumed
Taste the divine
of the supreme evil!!
