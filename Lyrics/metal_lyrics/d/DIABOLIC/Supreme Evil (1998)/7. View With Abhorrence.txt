The word of God
crippling their minds
The words of evil
seem so divine
Living their lives
search for salvation
We live for darkness
and embrace damnation

Paralyzed children of Christ
Blindly following his ways
Self deceit, believing his lies
Heaven awaits when they die!

You have been deceived!!

Break the cross,
a Christian epidemic
Destroy with disgust,
faith is only a crutch
Hypocrisy, confessing evil sins
confined to slavery,
Hail the Demise!
