Enter into the realm of Diabolic
The epitome of God we destroy
With grinding force
and wickedness
an aim to conquer
and reign....unholy!

Unseen lies the plague
released in a furious manner
Strengths within thy circle
powers of defiant....Gods!

Sinful ways, lusts in reality
Engulfed in the image
Penetrating nightshade vision
Satisfy the vigorous yearning!

Penetrating nightshade vision
Satisfy the vigorous yearning!

Hellish in this mortal world
possessed with
immeasurable hate
Blacken souls potency aligned
Embodies the infinite accuser!
