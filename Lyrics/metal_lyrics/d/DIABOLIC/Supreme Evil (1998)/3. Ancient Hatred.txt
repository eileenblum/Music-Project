Immersed in spiritual servitude
from further nations astray
Devious tempers coming towards
their cultic anger now disturbed

Oppressive megalomaniacs
thinking they have the right
to nullify a hope for peace
Murder the life of innocence

Assassinate for invocations
no one hears their prayers
Exhorting, exhorting
to a weak messiah
Suicide missions befall

Benighted underground terrorists
oppose the political deliverance
Rampant running with fear
Barbaric reasons are unclear

Planting the seed in their heads
slaying bombs of bloodshed
Slaying seeds of insanity
Brainwashed fanatics of divinity

Ancient hatred!!!!
