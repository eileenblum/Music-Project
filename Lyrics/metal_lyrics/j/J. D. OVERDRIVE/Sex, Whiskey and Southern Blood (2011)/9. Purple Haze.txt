Purple haze was all in my brain lately things don't seem the same
Acting funny, and I don't know why excuse me while I kiss the sky
Purple haze was all around don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me

Purple haze was all in my eyes don't know if it's day or night
You've got me blowing blowing my mind is it tomorrow or just the end of time?
Help me
