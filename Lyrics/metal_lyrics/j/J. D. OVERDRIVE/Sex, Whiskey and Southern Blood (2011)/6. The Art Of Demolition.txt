It tastes like fuel to me a brand new air to breathe on the top of a mountain I proudly stand
A flame beneath the skin burns away my sins Iâm a holy man with blood on my hands
The fire in my soul corrosion of control all the boundaries have disappeared
I see your frightened stare itâs more than you can bare just take a look and see the face of fear
Itâs getting closer apocalypse in my reach
The art of demolition is the only truth Iâll teach

Voices in my head tell me where to tread the only path I know leads to destruction
But thatâs just fine with me destructionâs what I need your annihilation is my satisfaction
The fire in my soul corrosion of control all the boundaries have disappeared
I see your frightened stare itâs more than you can bare just take a look and see the face of fear
Itâs getting closer apocalypse in my reach
The art of demolition is the only truth Iâll teach

Demolition all around you
Demolition can you feel it
