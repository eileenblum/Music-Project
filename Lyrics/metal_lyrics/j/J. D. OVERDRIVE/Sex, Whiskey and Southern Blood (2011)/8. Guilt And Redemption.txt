[Guilt:]

Redeem me I've spent too many days in the dirt searching for what I thought would change my life
Now I'm just left all alone with myself tied to my guilt for all this god damn time
Struggling from within set me free
Struggling from within silence my hypocrisy
Struggling from within set me free
Struggling from within kill this beast inside of me
And I lie to myself to keep control in my mind nothing matters anymore
And I lie to myself to pay the toll there's no time can't take back what was done before

Struggling from within set me free
Struggling from within silence my hypocrisy
Struggling from within set me free
Struggling from within kill this beast inside of me
And I lie to myself to keep control in my mind nothing matters anymore
And I lie to myself to pay the toll there's no time can't take back what was done before

[Redemption:]

When this world's over kingdom Come
We will burn slowly one by one
When this world's over I'll be fine
As long as you save me one last time
When this world's over I'll be fine
