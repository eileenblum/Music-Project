I feel just like a god spread my black wings and fly this is the road to heaven
But if I should kiss your lips and never reach the sky I'll say that heaven's overrated
It feels like the best damn time in my life this is what I call my freedom and I'll use it until I die
Stoned to death again effected by life's vicious plot
Born again I think I'm ready for another shot

I've played this wretched game more than a thousand times but to be honest I'm tired of keeping score
I know it won't erase all of my previous crimes but I just don't give a fuck anymore
It feels like the best damn time in my life this is what I call my freedom and I'll use it until I die
Stoned to death again effected by life's vicious plot

I'll never stop playing this God-forsaken game
So join me in madness I'll make you love the pain
