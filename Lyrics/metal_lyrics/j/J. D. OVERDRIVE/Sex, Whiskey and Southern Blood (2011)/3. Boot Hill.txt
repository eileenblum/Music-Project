The bony hand of death is knocking at my door it's time for me to leave this God forsaken place
I'll pack my bags and take my trusty gun along don't think you'll get another chance to lead me astray
Candle light butterflies lullabies for my baby
Gentle lies evil eyes lullabies that betrayed me

There are no heroes left in this burial place I will lay with the others feeling shame and disgrace
But one of these days I will rise from my grave to reclaim and to save everything you betrayed
Candle light butterflies lullabies for my baby
Gentle lies evil eyes lullabies that betrayed me

Then I'll see you in hell see you in hell
On an unmarked grave there's room for your name
