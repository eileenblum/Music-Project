So here I stand, both feet on shore the sun shines stronger than before
I kiss the ground that gave me life I kiss my infancy goodbye
For every dream I leave behind there is a hope that I call mine
A thousand words lay buried deep just like the promises I couldn't keep
No I'm not trying to redeem myself
Those years gone by will haunt me forever

And as my eyes are finally closed into the same river I go
To wash the blood off from my hands to cleanse myself before the end
And on this road I seem to have lost all the things I cherished the most
There are no more streets for me to roam I let the river take me home take me home

So here I stand, both feet on shore don't need forgiveness anymore
I kiss your face this one last time I kiss my past mistakes goodbye
