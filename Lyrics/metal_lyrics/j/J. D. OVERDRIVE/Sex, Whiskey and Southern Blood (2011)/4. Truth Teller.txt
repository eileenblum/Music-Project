A halo in my pocket a helmet on my head
There's nothing good in this town it's time to paint it red
Each step I take is risky don't know what lies ahead
I may be crowned with glory or end up being dead
Because life's no fairy tale in fact it's more like hell

And still I speak the truth it's all that's left for me to do I am the Devil's due
Don't treat me like a god damn fool I'll always speak the truth it's all that's fucking left to do
My world is coming true with every lie I take from you

I'm a teller of truth it's just what I do
I'm a teller of truth and I'll never listen to you

The truth I've learned is simple reality's unkind
Ain't dwelling on my losses it's just a waste of time
Instead of burning bridges I'll let your lies unwind
And when you hit the bottom you'll taste this truth of mine

I'm a teller of truth that's what I do I'm the Devil
