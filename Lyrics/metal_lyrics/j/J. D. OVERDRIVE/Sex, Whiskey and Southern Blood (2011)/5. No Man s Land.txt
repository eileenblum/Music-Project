Sever me from my past I don't belong there anymore
Now I'm free free at last and I have settled all of my scores
I have dropped my chains and I've cleared my name now the road is waiting for me
No more mindless cries no more compromise time to end this misery
Now it's all clear here in no man's land
Among the sand I have found my true self true self

Bury my memories they served their purpose long ago
Cast aside all good deeds time to get back from high to low
I have taken blame bathed in my own shame now I'm shedding this old soaked skin
No more truths and lies no more sacrifice time for a new life to begin
Now it's all clear here in no man's land
Among the sand I have found my true self true self

There never was a master plan don't try to fucking understand
I'll bury my dreams in the sand to rot there forever
So meet me here in no man's land
Where blood runs from our wounded hands
We're all just waiting for the end could this sound any better?
