Set it off annihilation is what I am
Elimination is my master plan
Been here a long time so understand
When it comes to damage I'm the man

Listen to what I say don't fuck with me
On your knees and pray I ain't being rich
You better watch out because I'm a ball breaker son of a bitch

And this ain't no dream no one's going to wake you
Go ahead start to scream because I'm going to break you

I'm going to take you down down to the fucking ground

Annihilation I never rest
Elimination you're fucking next
Don't try to run don't try to hide
Your days are numbered I got you in my sight
It's the end of the line the end of the line
