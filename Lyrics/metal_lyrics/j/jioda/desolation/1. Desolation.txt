This is the consequence
Of all our ignorance
The whole world in desolation
Just because we have been blind

So open your eyes
Make up your mind to realize the things
That we
Left alone

Before youâre left alone!

Move along (move it)
Move along (move it)
Move

Feeling left behind
Trapped inside a mind
Running out of time
Running out of time

Nowhere else to hide
Trapped inside a mind
Running out of time
Running out of time

Blind of what we need
Of what we feel
And our dreams
They come disguised, as our friends
As a good omen

So open your eyes
Make up your mind to realize the things
That we
Left alone

Before youâre left alone!

The sun goes down and i canât fix it
Still carry on to the end
I follow death and destruction
Until they lead me to you

So open your eyes
Make up your mind to realize the things
That we
Left alone

Our great indifference of the impending fall
Will drag it all with no regrets or hesitation to the depths of hell

Oblivious to all the pain, the venom we inject
Into the world while never recognizing that this sets our fate

This is the consequence
Of all our ignorance
The whole world in desolation!

So open your eyes
Make up your mind to realize the things
That we
Left alone

So open your eyes
Make up your mind to realize the things
That we
Left alone
