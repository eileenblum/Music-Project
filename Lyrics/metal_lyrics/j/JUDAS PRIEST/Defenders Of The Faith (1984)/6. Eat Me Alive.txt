Wrapped tight around me
Like a second flesh of skin cling my body
As the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations
Got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let rip
Eat me alive
Sounds like an animal panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone gasping from the heat
Gut-wrenching frenzy that deranges every joint
I'm gonna force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Bound to deliver as you give and I collect
Squealing in passion as the rod steel injects
Lunge to the maximum
Spread-eagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive
