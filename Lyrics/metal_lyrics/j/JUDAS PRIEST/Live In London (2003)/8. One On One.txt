I am your darkest hour
I am your fall from power
I am the voice you dread and I'm
Screaming out inside your head

I am the final count
I am your demons out
I am the worst demise
I'm gonna cut your words down to size

What is this?
I hear you shout
Face to face
I'm gonna take you out

[chorus]

One on One
Bring it on
One on One
Take me on

I am the awful truth
I am the fearless youth
I am the cross to bear
And the one who dares to return your stare

I am the fist of God
I am the underdog
I'll always stand my ground
While the others scatter all around

Against all odds
Despite it all
I'm at my best when I'm against the wall

[chorus]

I am the bloodstained past at last
That's finally caught up with you like
The glint of steel from out of the dark the last
Thing you will feel - I'm outgunned, I'm out
Run, I'm undead and then I found the skin
You shed - I am the questions asked
That send shivers down your back

So I am holding out
And I'm much stronger now
So take me on

[chorus]

I am the darkest night
I am the vipers strike
I'll see you all consumed
As you start to lick
Your mortal wounds

Like the condemned man
Who just won't die
I'll show no remorse
I'll never walk away

[chorus]
