Look around
They're movin' in
Hold the ground
When they begin

We can do it
We can do it
And if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
And they can keep out of here
Gonna keep on drivin' never stop

[Chorus]

United, united
United we stand
United we stand one and all
So give me hope
Don't give in

Make a stand
We're gonna win
We can do it
We can do it
And if they wanna they can try
But they'll never get near
And they can get out of here
Gonna keep on drivin' never stop

[Chorus]

United, united
United we stand
United we stand one and all
So give me hope
Don't give in

So give me love

[Chorus - repeat 4 times]
