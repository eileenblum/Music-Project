You're looking at me why
Sort of like a leper vibe
Okay for your kind
But it's too good for me

And a hey I know I'm
Never gonna qualify
For all the bullshit
Of your social degrees

Oh look down your noses at me
Hating my identity
Oh but that don't mean a damn thing you see
'Cause down here in hell everybody loves me

Hey I know I'm anti-social
'Cause you act like I'm infected
With some atrocity

And though I know I'm
Every bit the same inside
My face don't fit
It's like I've got some disease

Oh you keep your face turned away
To strip me of identity
Oh still got my fortune and fame
'Cause down here in Hell everyone knows my name

[chorus]

Hell is home to me
Might as well be
I like it here and no-one else invited me
Hell is home to me
It has to be ('cause Jesus Christ)
Nobody else invited me

Now I belong
I found my home
'Cause even though I know things won't
Get any better, they can certainly never get much worse

[chorus]

Say my whole life I've always been disliked
Ignored unless you're spitting insults at me
And I don't know why you felt so justified
In all the degradation that you dished on me

Oh! Now my status has changed
And you've got yourself to blame
Oh! I'll grab all the attention I crave
Now I'm running Hell and Heaven won't be the same

[chorus]
