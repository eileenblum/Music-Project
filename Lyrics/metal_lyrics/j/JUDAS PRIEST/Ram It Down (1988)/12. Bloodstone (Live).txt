[Bonus Track - Live In Memphis, 1982]

I've been trying
There's no denying
It's sending me
Out of my mind

I've seen reason
Change to treason
It's losing it's sense
Of all kind

How much longer will it take
For the world to see
We should learn to live
And simply let it be
Bloodstone, bloodstone

In the night time
Wake in fright
I'm so scared of the game
That's being played

Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals
Have been made

How much longer will it take
For the world to see
We should learn to live
And simply let it be
Bloodstone, bloodstone

Bloodstone
I can't take it
You got me living
On a bloodstone
I don't want that that bloodstone
