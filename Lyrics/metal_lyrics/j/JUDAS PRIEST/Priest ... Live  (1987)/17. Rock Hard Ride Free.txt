[Bonus Track - Live at The Sports Arena, Long Beach CA 1984]

Get a grip on the action
Movin' heaven and earth
Gotta get a reaction
Push for all that you're worth

No denyin we're goin' against the grain
So defiant they'll never put us down

Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
Rock Hard Ride Free
All your life

Tough as steel
Stop at nothin'
Look at fate in the face
Don't take no for an answer
Grab the lead in the race

Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
Rock Hard Ride Free
All your life

Rock with a purpose
Got a mind that won't bend
Diehard resolution
That is true to the end

Rock Hard Ride Free
All day, all night
Rock Hard Ride Free
All your life
