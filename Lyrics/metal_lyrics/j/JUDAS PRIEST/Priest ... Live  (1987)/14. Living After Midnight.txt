Living after midnight
Rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' till the morning
Then I'm gone, I'm gone

I took the city 'bout 1am
Loaded, loaded
I'm all geared up to score again
Loaded, loaded
I come alive in a neon light
That's when I make my moves right

Loving after midnight
Rockin' till the dawn
Lovin' till the mornin'
Then I'm gone, i'm gone

I'm aiming for you
I'm gonna floor you
My body's coming all night long!

Got gleaming chrome reflectin' steel
Loaded, loaded
Ready to take on every deal
Loaded, loaded
My pulse is racin', i'm hot to take
This motor's revved up fit to break

[Chorus]

The air's electric, sparking power
Loaded, loaded
I'm getting harder by the hour
Loaded, loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flyin' when I begin

[Chorus]
