This one reveals my fate
And so my friends farewell
I can no longer wait
My prophecies remain
They live when I am gone

The wisdom of the wise
Eternally endure
My legacy survives
So you can rest assured
The secret treasures here
Make the what you will

I see you
I feel you
I hear you
As my life evolves

These visions of the world
Created in my mind
I made them all begin
The future of mankind
Reveals what must be done
To manifest through time

I'll cross the rubicon
Into infinity
My quest has now been won
I've found my destiny
The darkness brings me home
Rewarding me with peace

I see you
I feel you
I hear you
As my life evolves

These visions of the world
Created in my mind
I made them all begin
The future of mankind
Reveals what must be done
To manifest through time

Now everything shall pass
We all know that it must
For nothing ever last
We all return to dust
I beg you not to mourn
As I will never die

I see you
I feel you
I hear you
As my life dissolves

These visions of the world
Created in my mind
I made them all begin
The future of mankind
Reveals what must be done
To manifest through time

Je suis au bout de ma vie
Ma tÃ¢che est finie
Je passe de ce monde Ã  un autre
Mes prÃ©monitions survivront
Prenez garde Ã  mes paroles
Par ce qu'elles adviendront
Le patrimoine que j'ai laissÃ©
L'avenir de l'humanitÃ©
