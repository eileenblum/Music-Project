Welcome to my world of steel
Master of my domain
Cower as the painÂ´s unsealed
Disasters where IÂ´ll reign

Father of sin IÂ´ll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify

Fire in the sky paralyzed with fear
You know youÂ´re gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Icon to the fall of man
Worshipped like a king
Fearless as I now condemn
Every living thing

Father of sin IÂ´ll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify

Fire in the sky paralyzed with fear
You know youÂ´re gonna die
Dragonaut is near

Father of sin IÂ´ll drag you all in
Bow down as I petrify
Relish the blaze left all in a daze
He came and consumed and let fly

Fire in the sky paralyzed with fear
You know youÂ´re gonna die
Dragonaut is near
Fire in the sky paralyzed with fear
You know youÂ´re gonna die
Dragonaut is near
