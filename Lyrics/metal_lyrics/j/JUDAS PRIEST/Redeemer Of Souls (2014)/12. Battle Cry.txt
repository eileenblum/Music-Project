Hail the hero coming home
Honour bound from whence he roamed
Fortitude and skill call of duty all alone
Lead the nation for the crown
Serve the orders coming down
Charge ahead with pride
Guard the chivalry youÂ´ve shown

Those forsaken reawakened
With my battle cry

Indestructible by choice
Valour rings out with the voice
Rail the consequence
DestinyÂ´s the flag you hoist

Your endeavor lives forever
With my battle cry

Battle cry death defy 
Battle cry never die

Cast this sorrow to the wind
Cast this sorrow to the wind
Let tomorrow be the light 
YouÂ´re made to herald in

Like a master of the seven seas
Your reputations grow
This eternal flameÂ´s been sown

Praise for sacrifice thatÂ´s done
Well deserved you carried on
Let your hearts be full
For those heroes every one

Restitution absolution
With my battle cry
Exoneration condemnation
With my battle cry

Battle cry death defy 
Battle cry battle cry
