Watch your own reflection read between the lines
Lost in this confusion itÂ´s a sign of the times

Caught in a crossfire you gotta let go
Caught in a crossfire you gotta let go

Opium for the masses worldÂ´s gone deaf and dumb
Victims of insanity ruled by the gun

Caught in a crossfire you gotta let go
Caught in a crossfire you gotta let go

Too much information messes with your mind
Pushing back the enemy blind leads the blind
World of smoking mirrors leaves you in a daze
Find your own solution out of the maze

Swearing on the bible hypocrites and fools
Losing your religion breaking all the rules

Caught in a crossfire you gotta let go
Caught in a crossfire you gotta let go

Caught in a crossfire caught in a crossfire
Caught in a crossfire caught in a crossfire
