The time has come and as I reach up to the sky
The love will never die at last itÂ´s here
The darkest sky begins to clear
The final hour draws near
But the voices are calling me
Erasing the pain and the fear

So lay me down lay me to rest itÂ´s over now 
Â´Cause I know itÂ´s the beginning of the end

And so weÂ´ll rise by the grace of God alone
His words carved in stone IÂ´m never gone
IÂ´ll always be within your heart
WaitingÂ´s the worst part
Now the voices are calling me
Soothing me and easing the pain and the fear

So lay me down lay me to rest itÂ´s over now 
Â´Cause I know itÂ´s the beginning of the end

And I see my life pass quickly by I am watching
All these years we thought we were so wise
They mean nothing
Walk alone into the dying mist come alive forever
See the things weÂ´ve never seen before
Hand in hand together

The falling rays are lightning up the open door
WeÂ´ve all been waiting for
Where the voices are calling me
Showing the path that is clear

So lay me down lay me to rest itÂ´s over now 
Â´Cause I know itÂ´s the beginning
So lay me down so lay me down
Lay me to rest lay me to rest itÂ´s over now 
Â´Cause I know itÂ´s the beginning of the end
