Yeah thrusting from a grave of unholy earth
Giving all his worth let the damned be saved
All that evil sin buried underground
Feeling safe and sound in his deadly skin

Heard the cry of pain so heÂ´s wide awake
Now for heavenÂ´s sake heÂ´s become insane
How we feared the worst of a world gone mad
Never been so bad with a curse of

His immortal soul at stake
Hear the storm clouds break
He will find you goes for your throat
Mesmerize you he is the metalizer

With a clash of steel as the war begins
All he does is grin at the pain he feels
Fixing for a war of a hundred years
With no sense of fear tooth and nail will

Claw at flesh and bone to prevail
His honor will not fail
He will find you goes for your throat
Mesmerize you he is the metalizer

In this war that you canÂ´t win
You will die or live
He has ruled for a thousand years
He canÂ´t ever forgive

Fire and brimstone fill the earth and sky
Still he will defy
He will find you goes for your throat
Memorize you he is the metalizer 
He will find you goes for your throat
Memorize you he is the metalizer 

Metalizer metalizer metalizer metalizer
