I have no face
I have no mind
I have no senses left
You see I'm blind

I feel no faith
I hear no truth
The reason is I have
Have all gone loose

[Chorus]
There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice
I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood that runs through me

I lie here numb
My conscience clear
And all the decency
Transfuse to fear

I feel no faith
I hear no truth
The reasonings I have
Have all come loose

[Chorus]
There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice
I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold
Blood that runs through me

[Bridge]
You took my life
And all I live for
I left for dead
Cold blooded and in hell
Aaaaaahhhhh......

[Harmonies / solos]

[Chorus]
There is no way
I have no voice
I have no say
I have no choice
I feel no pain or sympathy
It's just cold blood that runs through me
