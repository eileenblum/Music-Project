My last days we shall see
They are coming now theyÂ´re after me
They want blood yes itÂ´s true
Going quietly I just donÂ´t do

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory

In my heart in my heart
I can say I can say
IÂ´ll be ready for what comes my way
DonÂ´t be fooled donÂ´t be fooled
I can tell I can tell
Where IÂ´m going to will serve me well

Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory
Going down in flames
Going down in a blaze of glory

Leaving my mark 
On the world when IÂ´ve gone
Spreading the word 
By the deeds that IÂ´ve done

Going down in flames 
Going down in flames 
Going down in a blazing glory
Going down in flames 
Going down in flames 
Going down in a blazing glory 
Going down in flames 
Going down in flames 
Going down in a blazing glory
Going down in flames 
Going down in flames 
Going down in a blazing glory
