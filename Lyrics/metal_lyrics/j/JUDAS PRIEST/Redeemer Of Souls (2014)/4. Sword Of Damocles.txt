Will you take the dare if it was ever placed
ThereÂ´s danger to challenge the throne
Deceivers will rise 
And weave their web of stealth
Can you face them standing alone

When men lead by words 
That are false as they preach
Fatality waits in the wings
Surrounded by fools 
Behind walls that are breached
Beware of the jester that sings

Stand tall rise up
Stay strong fighting your enemies
Truth will find its reward
If you live and die by the sword

The whispers canÂ´t hide 
When the tongues are let loose
Then hiding the truth is absurd
A stab in the back or taste of the noose
Is when action speaks louder than words

Stand tall rise up
Stay strong fighting your enemies
Truth will find its reward
If you live and die by the sword

Wield the spear of light guard it with your life
Wield the spear of light guard it with your life
Sword of Damocles Damocles
Sword of Damocles Damocles

Stand tall rise up
Stay strong fighting your enemies
Truth will find its reward
If you live and die by the sword 
Truth will find its reward
If you live and die by the sword
