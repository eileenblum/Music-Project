Valhalla...

Fierce is the gale from the north sea
We drink and rejoice from the chalice
Holding the course through long nights and days
The ice and the hail bear no malice

[Pre-chorus:]
Tow the line, keep it fine
Every man seeks this end

[Chorus:]
Valhalla, you are calling
Valhalla, you are calling me home
Valhalla, new day dawning
Valhalla, this is where I belong, i belong...

We crash oâer the waves
Bite deep on the oars
Scouring the spray on the stormâs maul
Then lightning reveals for what we all pray
By Odin in Asgard its land fall

Life from death, combat rests
Heralds peace for the slain

[Chorus]

The storm in the night
Takes us there
On an unrelenting tide
As the wind drives us ashore

Halls of Valhalla, halls of Valhalla
Halls of Valhalla, halls of Valhalla...

[Pre-chorus]

The halls of Valhalla, are calling me home
The halls of Valhalla, that's where we belong

[Chorus]
