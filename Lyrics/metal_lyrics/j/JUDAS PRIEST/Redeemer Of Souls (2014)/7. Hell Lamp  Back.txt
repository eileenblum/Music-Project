I have roamed so far away
I have found thereÂ´s no turning back
I have seen so many things
I have been to hell and back

Still in the land of the living
Rocking the home of the brave
Staying alive and still kicking
AinÂ´t got no need to be saved

Out of the fire and into the black
WeÂ´ve been through it all
WeÂ´ve been to hell and back

When I was young life was savage
The leather gets scruffed as itÂ´s worn
Rolling alone you get damaged
So you grab the bull by the horns

Out of the fire and into the black
WeÂ´ve been through it all
WeÂ´ve been through hell and back
Take it up higher when youÂ´re under attack
WeÂ´ve been through it all
WeÂ´ve been through hell and back

We have roamed so far away
We have found thereÂ´s no turning back
We have seen so many things
We have been to hell and back

Out of the fire and into the black
WeÂ´ve been through it all
WeÂ´ve been through hell and back
Take it up higher when youÂ´re under attack
WeÂ´ve been through it all
WeÂ´ve been to hell and back

WeÂ´ve all been under attack
WeÂ´ve all been to hell and back 
WeÂ´ve all been under attack
WeÂ´ve all been to hell and back 
WeÂ´ve all been under attack
WeÂ´ve all been to hell and back 
WeÂ´ve all been under attack
WeÂ´ve all been to hell and back
