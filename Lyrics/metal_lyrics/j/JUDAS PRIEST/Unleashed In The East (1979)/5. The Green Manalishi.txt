[With The Two-Pronged Crown]
[Peter Green]

Now when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
And the night is so black that the darkness cooks
And you come sneaking around, making me do things I don't want to do

I can't believe that she needs my love so bad
Always creeping around, trying to drive me mad
Busting in all my dreams, making me see things I don't want to see

'Cause you're the Green Manalishi with the two-pronged crown
All night dragging us up, or you're bringing us down
Just taking my love, and slip away
Leaving me here, just trying to keep from following you
