I wanna tell ya, hey I think you oughta know
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have to go.
I've heard the rumours and it seems they're comin' true
You do what suits ya, but then that's nothing new

Do what you wanna do
Oh what you put me through.
How I suffer for your love.
Say what you wanna say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried.

You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life.
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what I like.

You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash
Instead of messin' 'round, practice what you preach.
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived
The way I see it, we're dead or we're alive

You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Don't know what I like

Do what you wanna do
Oh what you put me through
How I suffer what a lover can try on me
Say what you wanna say
You know that you're gonna pay
For all the times that I've cried

You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You give me pain, but you give me pleasure
Don't know what I like

You bring me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Get out of my life
You bring me pain, but you bring me pleasure
Don't know what I like
