[bonus track]

When I saw your face
I became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do just anything
To stay and be with you.

You know there are times
When I let myself wonder
As I was going under
You Pulled me back to earth

Don't you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie

Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
As each day goes by
I've given up completely
I've locked myself inside your heart
And thrown away the key

Only time will tell
If I can live without you
Can you live without you
Can you see into the future
Will you ever set me free

Don't you hear me crying
Take me into your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie

Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes

In this heartache
We can try and start again
Stop the heartbreak
A little time will help to kill the pain.
