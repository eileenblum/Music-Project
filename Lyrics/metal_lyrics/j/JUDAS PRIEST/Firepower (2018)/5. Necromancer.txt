Born out of hell from the depths of Gomorrah
Purging new graves and defiling the souls
He satiates with such vile and dark horror
Omens of dread on this night of the ghouls

Raising the dead up from the ground
Needs must be fed, sorcerers abound

Necromancer
Death's his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife

Feeding on flesh from the soil that was hallowed
Splintered the bones and regained in his feast
Danced on the grave of the pure and the righteous
As the moonlight's expelled from the eyes of the beast

Raising the dead, blasphemy reigns
Portraits of dread thrives on remains

Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Death's his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife

Raising the dead, cadaver consumed
Sacraments said, bodies exhumed

Necromancer
Feeding from the host
Necromancer
Black unholy ghost
Necromancer
Death's his guiding light
Necromancer
Stealing afterlife

Stealing afterlife
Death's his guiding light
