I'll bring you the head of the demon
I'm peeling the skin from his face
The life that you lead is inhuman
Its cause and effects a disgrace

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike

Twisted dreams that are formed from illusion
The collusion of fear and torment
Decimating to stem this contusion
With a power mad freaking intent

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike

I'll spin the world around reeling
I have to when mankind's at stake
I might be left broken and bleeding
For it's all in the fight that we make

You're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell
Your prayers and your demons are tolling the bell

Walking through fire, fate's in my hands
Waiting for lightning to strike
Man on a wire, bearing the brand
Waiting for lightning to strike
Lightning to strike

Lightning will strike!
