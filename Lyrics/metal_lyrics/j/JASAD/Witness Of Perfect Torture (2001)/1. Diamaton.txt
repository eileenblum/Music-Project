Today is the chronicle diamaton
chronicle in which the law sharply downward
chronicle the crazy power
chronicle bloodthirsty diamaton
society has blinded their heart
obliviously their way of life forgot theirtrue identity
whole worlds ruled by diamaton
only the last knight
can see with his heart
can stand on the truth
awaken any sleeping senses
oh chronicle wacky world
if we're not part of wacky things
we can get our portion
but
the lucky one who remember and alert
we are living today
cause we never live in tommorow
we learn from the past
the lucky one who remember and alert
awareness in the sun
patience is the earth
courage into the horizon
we can not change the world
but we can change ourselves
always keep the stuggle and
the lucky ones who remember and alert
we are living today
cause we never live in tommorow
we learn from the past
the lucky ones who remember and alert
awareness is the sun
patience is the earth
courage into the horizon
