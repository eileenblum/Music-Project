today is the chronicle diamaton
chronicle in which the law sharply downward
chronicle the the crazy power
chronicle bloodthirsty diamaton

society has blinded their heart
obliviously their way of life
forgot their true identity
whole worlds ruled by diamaton

only the last knight
can see with his heart
can stand on the truth
awaken any sleeping senses

oh chronicle wacky world
if were not part of wacky things
we can get our portion, but
the lucky one who remember and alert

we are living today
cause we never live in tomorrow
we learn from the past
the lucky one who remember and alert

awareness is the sun
patience is the earth
courage is the horizon

we can not change the world
but we can change ourselves
always keep the struggle and
the lucky ones who remember and alert

we are living today
cause we never live in tomorrow
we learn from the past
the lucky ones who remember and alert

awareness is the sun
patience is the earth
courage into the horizon
