Come to my yard to celebrate your own death
Bullets will serve you friendly as it sharp
Trigger dance gradually explodes

Muzzle aim wherever you go
You cant escape, you cant hide
My pleasure to see you suffer
Your destiny to be mine
Pray to your god then scream loud
Soon the story of your life will be end
Jump rabbit jump! Jump rabbit jump!
Your tears are lust of murder of me

One bullet to your head
And other to your chest
Nice holes decorated you
I enjoy your fuckin' pain
Bow to me, kiss my feet
I'll show you no mercy
Beg to me, kiss my leg
I'll show you merciless gun
Do it now, kiss my feet
More projectiles for your beg
Do it now, kiss my leg
Fell my senseless muzzle

I love the way you beg at me
Implore me with your tears
Desperate in pain I hear
The greatest sounds I've heard
Neight in pain, cry in fear
Die in pain, live in fear

You're my rabbit, die you fucker!

Hot tins laired
Torned pure skin
Penetrated your flesh
Fucked the beauty
Red coloured the weak
Red coloured the looser
