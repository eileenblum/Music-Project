Days waste away like forgotten memories that lurk within our minds
The darkness that waits inside its own silence will be replaced with steadfast light
Sadist oh how I'll miss your grace through the satisfaction of pleasure through pain
No longer will I be the victim
So I take my place at the top of the spire
A pedestal of my own design
I am the king of paths yet travelled
Dreamer search for salvation your journey has just begun
Grabbing hold of the aspirations I once held
I've always been a lost cause
I've always been a lost cause
All these years have washed away my sanity
Cracked edges of what was once a smile
Barren of emotion
I must change this stagnancy
I must change this stagnancy
Staunch I stood at the peak of existence
Ready to test the weight of gravity
I felt the warmth from a new dawn approaching it's embrace
It pulled me from the ledge
Grabbing hold of the aspirations I once held
I've always been a lost cause
I've always been a lost cause
Grabbing hold of the aspirations I once held
I've always been a lost cause
I've always been a lost cause
But I refuse to let my light dim out
I refuse to let my light dim out
