Days dance by as the clock ticks so mockingly,
We as people have lost so much humanity won't you have this dance with me?

Take from me what you may but you will never have my hatred.
You can beat me burn me break me but my words will not be empty

And we sing

Shut your eyes and see the world through mine,
Cities of nameless people we judge so carelessly

A pictures worth a thousand words but when you see a picture hanging on the wall that speaks of history
Speak soft of the dead

Winter's air brings a mourning of the summer, seasons change but always come back the same.
Put aside all our differences, and look at others before yourself.
The truest act of sacrifice
