Gaze Into the iris [2x]

Grip tight to the edge of tomorrow
I see you hanging on for your life, close your eyes and fight, fight, fight
Prepare to hold on through the night

Gaze into the iris [2x]

Rain is pouring and pushing us apart
I will guide you through the dark
Ships lost at sea perish without direction, follow your compass we can bear corruption

Clouds blacken as the storm approaches its destination
Thoughts of terror will dissipate in the light
Shadows will try and try to pull us into the devil's eyes
Thoughts of terror will dissipate in the light

Lock your gaze with mine
See the beauty you hold within your eyes
A story unwritten you're the ink to my pages, this is our tale let's engrave our name through the ages

Rain is pouring and pushing us apart
I will guide you through the dark
Ships lost at sea perish without direction, follow your compass we can bear corruption

Starless the sky, the moon still glows
Starless the sky, the sun will show
Shadows will try and try to pull us into the devil's eyes
Shadows will pull us in as we fix our gaze into the iris

Gaze into the iris

Rain is pouring and pushing us apart
I will guide you through the dark
Ships lost at sea perish without direction, follow your compass we can bear corruption

Gaze into the iris [2x]
