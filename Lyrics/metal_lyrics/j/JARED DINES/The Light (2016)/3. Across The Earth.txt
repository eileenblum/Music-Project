Valleys of unexplored wonder, people spend their whole lives searching for.
Floods come and wash away the beauty but through tragedy we will prevail

This world revolves to sustain its own existence.
Like the earth we are in charge of our actuality.
(Find your light.)

Finding a fallen rose amongst the soil is not a reason to never plant again

Brace yourself for what's coming next, life's joy waits around the bend

A flame can only last so long when imbued by darkness

Build up
There is a cycle of fear that lives in all of us.
I'll be the lantern to guide the world from its clutches.
I see the evil and I know what it wants from me, a flame can only last so long

I will burn

A wick with out its flame is merely just a spark away
A grain of sand must be burned before it starts to shine

This is my story I will rewrite what I please

Valleys of unexplored wonder, people spend their whole lives searching for.
I've finally realized the wonder I seek resides within my passion
