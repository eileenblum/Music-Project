Stack the bodies to the ceiling
This is only the beginning
Stack the bodies to the ceiling
Give birth to the new death

Let the ashes rain
Do you really know pain?
Let the ashes rain
Amongst this necrotic plain

Welcome to the tomb of the devil
Welcome to the tomb of pain

Let the ashes rain
Do you really know pain?
Let the ashes rain
Give birth to the new death

Behold the birth of death

As you look in the devil's eyes
You will now see your own demise
So pray as you roll the dice

As you look in the devil's eyes
You will now see your own demise
As this demon of fire will rise

This demon of fire will rise

Let the ashes rain
Do you really know pain?
Let the ashes rain
Amongst this necrotic plain

Behold the birth of death
Behold the birth of death

Upon the maw of hell
I will wrap my claws around thee
Dragging you through depths of agony

Upon the maw of hell
I will wrap my claws around thee
Dragging you through depths of agony (agony)

Behold the birth of death
Behold the birth of death
Behold the birth of death
Behold the birth of death
