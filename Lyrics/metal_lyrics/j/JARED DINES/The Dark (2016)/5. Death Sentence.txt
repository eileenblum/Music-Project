Die, all the hope inside
Running out of time
Wishing you could just go back

Why, did you have to climb
Up the stairs of crime
You just lost a lifetime

Cry, to yourself at night
Knowing that you'll die
With so much to live for

Shine, all the bells of time
You can hear them chime
Now face your death Sentence

Break your skull against the wall
Snap your bones as you fall

Tainted bodies line the cells
The ones who thought they were above this hell
Fallen to the bottom as the hammer drops
This desperation will never stop

Sickness, desire, deception, the fire
Sickness, desire, deception, the fire

Break your skull against the wall
Snap your bones as you fall

So many lives wasting away
Rotting in this hellhole of decay

Sickness, desire, deception, the fire

Face your death sentence
Face. Your. Death. Sentence

Break your skull against the wall
Snap your bones as you fall

Dead, no more hope inside
Ran all out of time
There's no way to turn back now

Why, you just had to climb
Up the stairs of crime
You just lost a lifetime

Cry, all the ones you loved
They will never hold
You into their arms again

Shine, as the bells of time
They no longer chime
This is your death sentence
