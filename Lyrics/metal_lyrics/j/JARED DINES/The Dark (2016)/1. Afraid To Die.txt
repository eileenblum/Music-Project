A fleeting peace is upon the darkness
Apathetic hate cannot depart us
A frail heart turns its back
To the pain that befalls the attack

I curse the ground as I walk
Breathing disease when I talk
Looking for a way to be free of this pain
I know that I will never see the face of my loved ones again

Are you afraid to die
Travel to the other side
Are you afraid to die
Like me

I am afraid to die
I am afraid to die

Infected, lying in my death bed
As they pull the plug my body gives in to death

A darkness slowly comes over my mind
Helpless I lay
I'm not ready to die

I'm not ready to die

Are you afraid to die
Travel to the other side
Are you afraid to die
Like me
Are you afraid to die
(travel to the other side) like me

I am afraid to die (afraid to die)
I am afraid to die (afraid to die)
I am afraid to die (afraid to die)
I am afraid to die (afraid)
