I feel my body seize as the thoughts begin to swell
Staring at the wall as time passes by
Killing time as I gasp just to survive

The walls wretch and come to life
This loneliness has become my wife
Clasping onto the edge of a knife
I feel nothing in this moment of desperation

I once knew love
I once knew peace
Now all I know
Is gone and deceased

I once knew hope
I once knew faith
Now all has turned
And died in this place

These voices won't stop speaking to me
They tell tales of all the things that could be
All these ghosts singing songs
Wandering through into the great beyond

The heart in my chest beats only for you
If only you were real I could make it through

I don't know if I'm dead or alive
Gasping for air just to survive
I fall into a trance
I see you standing there
Holding my hand

I once knew love
I once knew peace
Now all I know
Is gone and deceased

Murder path
