I look up from this winding path
The darkness engulfs me
Eyes burn into my skull
As I hear the breath close in

Desperately gripping onto sanity
As the clown emerges from the shadows

When the fear is too much to bear
And your body collapses from the weight
When the light begins to fade
Look within yourself to see the clown

You see the clown

The moonlight reveals his face staring back at me
I turn and run, I turn and run
Laughing behind me as I flee, footsteps growing closer
The clown begins his fun, the clown begins his fun

When the fear is too much to bear
And your body collapses from the weight
When the light begins to fade
Look within yourself to see the clown

When the fear is too much to bear
And your body collapses from the weight
When the light begins to fade
Look within yourself to see the clown

You see the clown
You see the clown

Monsters are real and ghosts are real too
They live inside us, and sometimes they win

Darkness lives in me
Darkness lives in me

When the fear is too much to bear
And your body collapses from the weight
When the light begins to fade
Look within yourself to see the clown

The clown
The clown
