Let it come over me
Let it come over me
You've got your reasons to leave
But every reason you give I've got a thousand to stay
(You love you)
You were a part of myself
If you've made up your mind then you're doing it without me

Reflect on the life that you're living
(Collapsing)
You watch in horror as we all sit idly
From a safe distance
(Complacent but [?])
Its so easy to just observe when no one else utters a sound
All we want is to keep to ourselves
We simply follow the path under shroud

But are we really so different?
You and I secretly disguised in the crowd
Searching for someone like us
But we all look the same so we keep passing by
And its all just so tragic
That we all keep pretending we're something we're not
Because we won't be pathetic
So now when you look at me you're all alone

Some day
You'll only have yourself to blame
When you're all alone
And no one seems to care
I know
You're trying so hard just to change yourself
But don't you change a thing

Please don't be afraid
To be just who you are and not trapped in the game
Your life is okay
You conform to the life that they want you to life
Because when alls said and done
When every ones just as fake as the mask they put on
Why won't you believe
That you're the only one inside this machine

Collapsing
A central self in your individuality
Dissolving
Everything that makes us who we are
And who we will be
Who will you be?
Our time is fading quickly
(Now)
Will you decide to be who you are
Or be someone else?

Some day
(Some day)
You'll only have yourself to blame
When you're all alone
And no one seems to care
I know
You're trying so hard just to change but
Don't you change a thing

Please don't be afraid
To be just who you are and get back in the [?]
Break down
Be afraid
