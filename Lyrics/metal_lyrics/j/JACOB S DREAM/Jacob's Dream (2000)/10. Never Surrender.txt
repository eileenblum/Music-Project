Dawn break another day through a veil of sleepless night
A heavy heart of pondering in the shadows of my plight
It was fifteen years ago that a presence came to me 
It was a call to live in song leading to adversity
But my heart still believes

I'll never surrender, I won't lose my soul
Hold onto the dream, I'll never let go

See this vessel of the soul, it's decaying day by day
Though this body fails me now there is so much I must say
Music intertwined with word, watch the miracle occur
Free the heart release the mind, bring a vision to the blind
Let the melody preside
And release the ancient power
In this quickly fading hour

I'll never surrender, I won't lose my soul
Hold onto the dream, I'll never let go
Never surrender, never let go
