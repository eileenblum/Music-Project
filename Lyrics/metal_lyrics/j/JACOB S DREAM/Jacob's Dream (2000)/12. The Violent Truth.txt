And now I'll take you to a realm yet unseen
Deep in the forest to a crimson tree
This is the place where a Lion died
His sacred pact with humanity
This blood has a power to heal your wounds
To break the spell of the curses chains
Come bathe in the Lion's blood
The bleeding tree

A pool of blood at the foot of the tree
A heart grows heavy at its beckoning
If you step inside and drift below
There's visions of pain, loss, love and sorrow
This blood has a power that cannot fail
To quench the charm of the serpents trance
Come bathe in the Lion's blood
The bleeding tree

This blood has a power to heal your wounds
To break the spell of the curses chains
Come bathe in the Lion's blood
The bleeding tree

Eloi! Eloi! Lema
