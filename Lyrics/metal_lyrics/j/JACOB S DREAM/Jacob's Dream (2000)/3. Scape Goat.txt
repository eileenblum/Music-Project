Let's blame the music world or maybe the gun makers
What about the books and movies, our scape goats they will be
Gaze into the cyber realm and its information sea
Images of Light and darkness, manifest ideologies

Don't you know that you have the power
Entrusted with your children's lives
Let them know that there are no scape goats
Teach them well to know wrong from right

Gaze into the children's eyes, behold a window to the soul
Images of Light and darkness, inner conflict to behold
Government and selfserving people
have torn apart the heart of the home
And now we run in search for excuses
to give account for the monsters we've made

Don't you know that you have a power
Entrusted with your children's lives
Let them know that there are no scape goats
Teach them well to know wrong from right
Know wrong from right

Government and selfserving people
Have torn apart the heart of the home
And now we run in search for excuses
To give account for the monsters we've made
Don't you know that you have a power
Entrusted with your children's lives
Let them know that there are no scape goats
Teach them well to know wrong from right
No scapegoats, no scapegoats!
