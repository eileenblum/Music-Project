The whispering call of evening falls upon the waiting mortal ear
With many tales it never fails to draw upon all your fears
The evidence and circumstance revealed by the mornings light
Would lead one to believe that something evil walks the night

Oh something evil walks this night
In the whispering shadows where it hides
The great deceiver conjures your demise
Oh something evil walks this night

Ancient lore and scripture tells of such things that this may be
The one who filled the heart of Cain
And brought the world calamity
The serpents of the garden, the bright and shining one
The rioter and crucifier of the one begotten Son

Oh something evil walks this night
In the whispering shadows where it hides
The great destroyer conjures you to die
Oh something evil walks this night
Better Light your lamp
Better keep the Fire high
For somethng evil walks this night
It walks this night!

The king of hell destroys with hatred in his eyes
The homicidal flames are raging in his eyes
