I feel the horizon, it's pulling my soul
Onto tomorrow and nobody knows
Destiny called and I answered to her
Oh Ancient One show me the way
The heavens are calling, an empire is falling
Sacred fires are burning, desperate souls are turning

Storm clouds gather as the winds of change are brewing
Angels raging for their Masters' jealous furies

Life is a drama we play on this stage
We race to the climax the end of this age
Spiritual forces defy space and time
Creations integrity fails 
The heavens are calling, an empire is falling
Sacred fires burning, desperate souls are turning

Storm clouds gather as the winds of change are brewing
Angels raging for their Masters' jealous furies

Storm clouds gather as the winds of change are brewing
Angels raging for their Masters' jealous furies
Storm clouds gather as the winds of change are brewing
Angels raging for their Masters' jealous furies
