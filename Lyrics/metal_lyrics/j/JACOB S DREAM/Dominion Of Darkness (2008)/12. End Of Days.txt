Pearls cast upon the wind
Gold refined and then discarded
Songs written and never sung
Tales of love unrequited
Never asked I never sought
Endless nights your image haunts
Flood my mind and wash me clean
Or answer now my silent scream

In the shadows I am waiting
Eyes that follow you
Til the end of days
The end of the days
Your in my dreams
Til the end end of days

You'll never hear never see
A secret fire that burns in me
Words can't travel or thoughts proceed
Across the sea of uncertainty
Candles burn and fade away
The thief of time steals the years away
The days of youth and foolish things
Repay us now with memories

Thoughts of what was and could have been
Fill the quiet moments now
Precious time time not spent with you
Fleeting glimpses were all I knew

In the shadows I am waiting
Eyes that follow you
Until the end of days
The end of the days
You steal my dreams
Til the end end of days
The end of days
You haunt my dreams
Ti the end of days
