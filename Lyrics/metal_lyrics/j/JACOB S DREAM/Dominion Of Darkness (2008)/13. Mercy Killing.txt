In the night I cry why must this be
Father won't you let this pass from me
All those words I've spoken to your people
That led to this final hour it must come to pass
The pain and agony man's rage will come for me
I'm guilty of no crime but I will pay this price
Sin is ever present I shall do what I must
The gates of Hell and it's king I will crush

My body is broken the pain is beyond belief
They curse my name and abuse me with no relief
I fight for every breath as I walk
The time has now come I must complete this task
Father forgive them they don't know what they do
I now take this burden in the name of love
History will turn the curtain will be torn
And in three days I shall arise

For you my life I vive my sacrifice so you can live
This mercy killing will set you free if you will only follow me

Now I hang before them bleeding for their souls
The hate me and scorn me yet I love them so

The storm is coming soon the pain is almost through
The salvation of man shall be born
It is finished I shout with my last breath
I now have my victory I've taken the keys of death
The enemy's defeated for those who will believe
The gates of heaven are open at last

For you my life I vive my sacrifice so you can live
This mercy killing will set you free if you will only follow me

Who will follow me
