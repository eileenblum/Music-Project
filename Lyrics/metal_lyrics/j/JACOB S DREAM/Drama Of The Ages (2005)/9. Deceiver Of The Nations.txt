Lucifer has carved a throne in strange a city lie
Far upon a distant shore where good men seldom spy
When time was laid eternal rest with ancient earth and sky
Behold the twisted image of the city of the night

Turn, behold emerging now
Like dawn divides the night
A city rising 'bove the mountains bathed in brilliant light
Sun nor stars are seen above
No moon hangs in the sky
The glory of the holy one illuminating all

I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God
And I will ascend above the highest clouds
Before the dawn of time
You lost your place on high
The shining one
Filled with pride
Defeated, falling, as lighting from the sky

Ruling with a rod of idon
Eternal his empire
The secrets in the hearts of men
Laid open for his eyes
There is no want no jealousy within the kingdom walls
And Lucifer's conspiracy as prophesied will fail

Released from the abyss
Ablaze with vengeful lust
Free from heavens chain
To charge Jerusalem

His word a sword ablaze as fire
Raining from on high
The final victory o'er the sons of perdition is nigh
Before the world as witness for judgement now he stands
For all to see the one who brought deception to the land

Join me now my sons and find your destiny
Vengeance will be ours and we'll rule eternally

Before the dawn of time
You lost your place on high
The shining one
Filled with pride
Defeated, falling, as lighting from the sky

I am man's disease
I will rise above the earth
This world is my kingdom
I'll deceive the hearts of men

Before the dawn of time
You lost your place on high
The shining one
Filled with pride
Defeated, falling, as lighting from the sky

Faithful you once were
Rebelling still you served with the beast
The prophet in fires
Never again will Jehovah be defied

[Voice over]
Is this the one who deceived the nations?
