With a shrug nd a sigh
Deeper you slide
Painting your mind closing your eyes

Seeing the signs but not asking why
The promises fade and hope leaves you dry

Bound in chains of fear and pain
Take a look through the eyes of the walking dead

Kissing the blade
Feeding the shame
Killing the pain and dying within

Trying so hard to believe the lies
You self to yourself a soul sacrificed

Memories fade of your life and crimes
And leave you insane dreaming of lies

I hear the cry of pain in your voice
Your trembling hands betraying your words

Time is a blut
One night to the next
Black when you rise and black when you rest

In a pouring rain the searching begins
Somewhere in your heart is a drowning man

Running wild crawling in sin
You cling to the blade as the bleeding begins

At the end of yourself is where this road leads
The black inner sea that's raging within

A cry in the dark as the blade's sinking in
This way isn't the way it was meant to be

From bad to worse
Can't break the curse
So the bottle's here to stay
Crawl inside and hide away

[Solo :Chunk]

In a pouring rain the searching begins
Somewhere in your heart is a drowning man

Running wild crawling in sin
You cling to the blade as the bleeding begins

At the end of yourself is where this road leads
The black inner sea that's raging within

A cry in the dark as the blade's sinking in
This way isn't the way it was meant to be
