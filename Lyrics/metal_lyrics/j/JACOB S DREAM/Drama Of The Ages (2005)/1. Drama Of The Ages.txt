Turning and burning
I look up at the sky and see
The storm that is coming

Waiting and praying
Father give us strength
To face the day with courage

Seasons are changing
The nations
Are raging

Mysteries explained
The day of our reckoning is coming

[1st Chorus:]
Prophecies unfolding
Mysteries are told me
The audience is waiting
For the part we're playing

Daylight is fleeting
And mercy
Lies slain upon the floor

Darkness consuming
And freedom is painted
As a whore

Heaven is calling
Like thunder in the night
The sleeper is awaking

Counting the sorrows
Every tear remembered
By he who holds tomorrow

[2nd Chorus:]
Prophecies unfolding
Mysteries are told me
The world stage is waiting
For the part we play
In the drama of the ages
