Fearless, fists held high
No one is questioning why
In the hearts of the one I see before me

Faithfully sworn as the legions who have gone before
Beyond the bonds of blood
We are the chosen ones
And we shall stand united till the end

When the call rings out
Will you rise with a shout
And take your place on the line

Here's for your courage
And here's for your soul
Here's to remember if you should grow old
So liveâ¦ for the moment flees away

Hold onto the hunger I see in your eyes
Till we are all one and our hearts satisfied

Does your heart still stir at the beat of the drum?
Does the song still echo in your mind?
Are you one with the blood of the sovereign one?
Is the fight and fire still alive?

May we meet once again in the kingdom in the sky

The master awaits his soldiers at the gates
And has prepared a place for you and I

Till we meet once again in the kingdom in the sky

The master awaits his soldiers at the gates
And has prepared a feast for you and I
