Follow me down to the sanctuary.
I'll show you where all of the bones are buried.
A place of righteous sacrifice.
The spirit He bids you attend tonight.

Those who attend this will live to tell,
The holy torment of angels that fell.
Those who reject this will live out the lie,
And go to the place where the pain never dies.

Some know the truth,
And some truly believe.
Some will press on and won't stop 'til they're free.

I won't hear the voices of strangers.
No longer hear, the voices of strangers.
I won't follow the voice of a stranger.
I won't hear the voices of strangers anymore.
