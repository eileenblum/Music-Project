How many times must I feel this way?
The fool who never learns.
Selfish pleasures override my thoughts.
Give that wheel just one more turn.
Drunken stupidity rules my mind,
And things aren't what they seem.
How many times must I feel this way'
I wish it were all a dream, a dream.

I'm sorry about your sorrow.
I'm sorry about your pain.
If I could turn back the hands of time,
I'd make things new again.
I'm sorry about your anger,
I'm sorry about your rage.
If I could do one thing in this world,
I'd make her live again.

Once, such a happy young man,
Now a shell of broken dreams.
Taken from me all that I am,
Myself the only one to blame.
My heart is filled with the blood of guilt,
But nothing can I say.
I see the anger in everyone's eyes
For the life I've taken away.

I'm sorry about your sorrow.
I'm sorry about your pain.
If I could turn back the hands of time,
I'd make things new again.
I'm sorry about your anger,
I'm sorry about your rage.
If I could do one thing in this world,
I'd make her live again.

A friend they've lost, forever gone.
Not a chance to say goodbye.
Forever embedded in their thoughts,
"Why did she have to die'"
The life I've taken burns inside me,
Always there to remind.
This truth I face, it is so hard,
I can never repay this crime.

I'm sorry about your sorrow.
I'm sorry about your pain.
If I could turn back the hands of time,
I'd make things new again.
I'm sorry about your anger,
I'm sorry about your rage.
If I could do one thing in this world,
I'd make her live again.
Live again.

There're no excuses for what I've done.
There are no words that can change the past.
Oh, but I, I can't deny,
I've killed an angel.
While the whiskey demon burned my soul.
I took the life of Sarah Williams.
Now I stand and face this bitter hell.
Oh, Sarah Williams, if you could hear,
Would you forgive me'
