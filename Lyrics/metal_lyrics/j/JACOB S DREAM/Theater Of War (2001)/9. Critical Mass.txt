'39
Europe's plains
Blood and fire spill again.
Warring forces set their cause.
The race for fission had begun.

Powers of destruction sought,
Hidden by the hand of God.
Took six years to conceive,
Construct, deploy, and now destroy.

Burning sky. Say goodbye to the rising sun.
In a mushroom cloud. Heaven knows what we've begun.
Firestorm, earth consumed with a fervent heat.
Power loosed, now we cannot kill this beast.

'45
Pacific isle,
A bird flies out before the dawn.
Oppenheimer's legacy is carried by Enola Gay.

Many sons owe their thanks
To the heroes of that day.
But victory was bittersweet,
As many blameless were swept away.

Burning sky. Say goodbye to the rising sun.
In a mushroom cloud. Heaven knows what we've begun.
Firestorm, earth consumed with a fervent heat.
Power loosed, now we cannot kill this beast.

Hell on earth had been released.
