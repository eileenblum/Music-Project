Life is a journey that you must take my son.
Take care and live it well, because there's only one.
Remember there's a purpose that you were meant to be.
You have a heart, you have a mind.
You are humanity.

Listen!
Challenge will come. Storms will rage against your heart.
Face them and be strong. Face them and be strong.

A lifetime of learning is what I give to you.
When you make a choice in life, be sure to think it trough.
Wisdom holds a treasure of knowledge in her hands.
Take care and love her well.
You'll be a better man.

Listen, learn to understand.
Use the gifts that you possess.
Find your destiny.
Dare to live your dreams.
Challenge will come. Storms will rage against your heart.
Face them and be strong. Face them and be strong.

Watch your back.
Protect your mind.
Always keep your objectives clear 'til the day you die.

Find your destiny.
Dare to live your dreams.

Pain will come, tears will fall.
Guard your heart, keep your vision clear, rise above it all.
Find your destiny. Dare to live your dreams.

Can't you feel the hunger that's growing in your heart'
Let your gifts consume you, let them tear your fears apart.
Hear the voice of reason that's calling from the sky.
Face the winds of future,
With a fire in your eyes.
