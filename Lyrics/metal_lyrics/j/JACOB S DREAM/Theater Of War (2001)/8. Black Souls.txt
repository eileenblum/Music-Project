Dark seeds were planted,
When the king gave up his throne.
Lost to deception
Through his flesh and bone.
His queen enchantres believed the dragon's lie.
Their souls infected and now began to die.

The flaming sword, the wicked spell,
Dominion lost to the gates of hell.

Vile pride brought death and fear.
Legacy of the black souls.
Sorrows grow in a sea of tears.
Legacy of the black souls.
Only the blood of the alien can kill this wicked curse,
And bring an end to the age of sin.
Legacy of the black souls.

The nails were pounded, the blood began to flow.
The horde defeated with a single blow.
Behold the potion that broke the dragon's spell.
The one who was dead
Is now alive and well.

The sacred blood, the broken spell.
Lightning crashed through the gates of hell.
Vile pride brought death and fear.
Legacy of the black souls.
Sorrows grow in a sea of tears.
Legacy of the black souls.
Only the blood of the alien can kill this wicked curse,
And bring an end to the age of sin.
Legacy of the black souls.
