Cain killed his brother and the blood began to flow.
Gathering momentum into a torrid flood of woe.
War made its entrance into the virgin realm of man.
Steel forged in hatred brought the drama of the damned.

[Chorus]
The reaper's standing just inside the backstage door.
Waiting for the players in the theater of war.

Man's quest for power for fortune and for fame,
Brought the blood of battle and the cannon's glory blaze.
Leaders make their speeches, propaganda's mind control.
Bezerkers in a frenzy as the madness takes it's toll.

Massive destruction.
Missiles, guns and war machines,
See the butchered bodies as we play another scene.

Armageddon's coming we're at relevation's door.
Final performance for the theater of war.
