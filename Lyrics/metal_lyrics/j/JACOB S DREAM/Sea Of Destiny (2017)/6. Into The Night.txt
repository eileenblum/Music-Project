I've lived a thousand lives
In every age and race
Fought against the plague
Of hate and ignorance
My tears feel through my hands
As nations rose and feel
Watched from the shadows
As they paved their road to hell

They convinced themselves
There was no consequence
Then they exalted
Every form of decadence

Released the burden
Of the infirmed and insane
A new society elite
Will rise and remain

Peace
Through laying down our arms
Prosperity
Enforced equality and unity
Embraced diversity
And sacrifice individuality
Oh no

Once again
Leaping from the precipice
Hand in hand
As the piper leads the dance
Down below
Hear the screams from the abyss
Off they go
And disappear into the night

The dream in ruins
They confront reality
The brave new world
Just as hollow as their souls

No god above
No love within
Or regard for fellow man
No memory of the world that was
Or a chance to start again

On and on
One age to the next
The new world slips from their grasp
The pride of man is brought down
As nations rise
And nations always fall

Once again
Leaping from the precipice
Hand in hand
As the piper leads the dance
Down below
Hear the screams from the abyss
Off they go
And disappear into the night
