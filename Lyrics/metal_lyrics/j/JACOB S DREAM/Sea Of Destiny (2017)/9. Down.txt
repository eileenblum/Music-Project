Tear away the veil of lies
Sight is coming to the blind
Were standing at the threshold
Our destiny's arrived

The ancient cloak
The twisted hold
That once bound humanity
Oppressive bonds are crumbling
Hate filled doctrines and fantasies

You won't hold me down
I've tasted freedom
Cast my chains to the ground
You won't hold me down
This is just beginning
Your world is turning upside down

Damn them and their sympathy
Their talk of love and peace
Just as I am on bended knee
But always just beyond our reach

We are here and now
Fire water earth and sea
We are all there is
We are all we need
Right?

The system was broken
Left us all out in the rain
The paradigm has shifter
We ll take the place where we belong

You won't hold me down
I've tasted freedom
Cast my chains to the ground
You won't hold me down
This is just beginning
Your world is turning upside down

You can't hold me down
I've tasted freedom
Cast my chains to the ground
You can't hold me down
This is just beginning
I'm turning your world upside down
