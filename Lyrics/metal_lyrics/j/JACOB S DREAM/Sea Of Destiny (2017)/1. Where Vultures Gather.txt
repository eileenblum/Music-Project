Sifting through the ashes
Of a time come and gone
Our days fall through the hour
Glass as the march time gos on
Age to age we rise and fall
As the prophecies foretold
Look into the futures eyes
Till there's nothing, nothing there at all

Circling the skies black wings arise
On what have fixed your attention
As you look down from on high
Black wings falling from the sky
The reckoning has come
Let all who can hear
All who can see
Look and listen for the sign

Living underneath the cruel fist of pain
Since the day man lost his way
Lust and greeds been our elixir
A faithless age of decadence
Seeing not our own seduction
Centuries for lies have dulled our eyes
To malevolent destruction

Where vultures gather
The bodies they lie
Where vultures gather
The spirit has gone away
Where vultures gather
The carcass you'll find
Let the wolves and the carrion feed
And the sun bleach the bones

With cold calculation
Surveying the kill
The predator watches
Containing the thrill
Sighting his prey stumbling and weak
Aimlessly wandering he falls to his knees

Where vultures gather
The bodies they lie
Where vultures gather
The spirit has gone away
Where vultures gather
The carcass you'll find
Let the wolves and the carrion feed
And the sun bleach the bones
