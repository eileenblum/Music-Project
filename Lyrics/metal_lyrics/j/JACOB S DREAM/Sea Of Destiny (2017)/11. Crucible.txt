Abuse our name
Accuse us of shame
Make us a scapegoat
A wretched horde of sin

We can not bought
And we wont be brought down
To your world of corruption
Spare us all your lies

Hardened by the hammers fall

Words are your weapons
Venom and guile
We don't stand alone
Theres a legion beside

Out of many we are one

Push it too far
Trip the snare and see
You sow to the wind you reap the hurricane
We stand united against you

Hardened by the hammers fall

Forged in the fire
Like the heat of the sun
Forged in the fire
Harder than steel
Forged in the fire
In the crucible
Forged in the fire
Now we are one

We are the blackened fold
And were forever free
There is honor and pride
And integrity

Blood has bought and paid the price
Chose this day whom you serve
You can chose death or life
Chose life

Forged in the fire
Like the heat of the sun
Forged in the fire
Harder than steel
Forged in the fire
In the crucible
Forged in the fire
Now we are one
