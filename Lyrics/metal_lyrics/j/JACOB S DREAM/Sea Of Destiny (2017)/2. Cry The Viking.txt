Trace the journey of the sun from the east onto the west
The days are short, the nights are long
Taste the frost upon your breath
Farewell to innocence, never count the cost
Amputated emotions, faintly beating phantom heart

Only now you realize that fabled Odin hears no cries!

Your creator was a stranger, and your Odin wasn't there
You had no one to plead your case to
Before the seat of the righteous judge

Stand tall Viking, cry Victory!
A final prayer with dying breath
Rise through the flames in morning mist
Rise to Valhalla, your place for eternity

Search before or search behind, the horizon is all you'll find
You can't go back or carry on, no idea how far you've come

Stand tall Viking, cry Victory!
A final prayer with dying breath
Rise through the flames in morning mist
Rise to Valhalla, your place for eternity
Stand tall Viking, cry Victory!
A final prayer with dying breath
Rise through the flames in morning mist
Rise to Valhalla, your place for eternity
