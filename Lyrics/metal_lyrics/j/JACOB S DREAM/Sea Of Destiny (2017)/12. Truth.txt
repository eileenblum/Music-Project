Shrouded in mystery
Precious and seldom seen
The fear of both kings and thieves
Should it ring to light
What they have concealed

Consider the holy and wise
Ascended in their own eyes
Abstaining the vintage bittersweet

All in time will be revealed
Break the power of the lies
All in time will be unsealed
The truth will find us
You can run or receive
No escape nowhere to hide
All in time and you will see
