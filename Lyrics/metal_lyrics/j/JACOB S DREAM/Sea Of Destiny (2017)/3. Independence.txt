I hear what your saying
I know where your coming from
You twisted up the meanings
I cant believe you anymore

First you want my money
Now you want my soul
Put me on display
In your carnival of fools

We shared a common thread
And you've pulled on my strings
You watched me dance around
To the hateful song you sing

You told me my desires desires
Then you told me what I need
Then you cut me and you sold me
Bandages to feed your greed

When my thoughts became a crime
I became a criminal
Truth will go unrecognized
From main street to marbled halls

Once our thoughts became a crime
We all became criminals
Subvert the reigning paradigm
I can think for myself

Sing to me in silence
For the final time
Hold my hand and tell me
It's OK to be alone

Shredded vows now hurt me
Clothe my thoughts in corduroy
Can I make it any better
Will I suffer anymore

When my thoughts became a crime
I became a criminal
Truth will go unrecognized
From main street to marbled halls

Once our thoughts became a crime
We all became a criminal
Truth will go unrecognized
From main street to hallowed halls

When my thoughts became a crime
I became a criminal
Truth will go unrecognized

Once our thoughts became a crime
We all became criminals
Subvert the reigning paradigm
I can think for myself
From main street to marbled halls
