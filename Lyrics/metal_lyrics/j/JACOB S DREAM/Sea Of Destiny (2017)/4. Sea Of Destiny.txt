All the roads I've tread
Sweat and blood I gave
To shed some light on this mystery that surrounds us all
Forging rhymes into a song
A tune to carry it along
A grain of truth to inspire the dusty soul

A sailing ship on the sea of destiny
Compass and stars
Horizon beckons me
As tales of old have told
I am off to see
What lies beyond beyond
I am leaving

I leave my homeland behind forsaking all for what ill find
If id stayed I would have withered
Fear I would have lot my mind
A fire burns inside a man
Though he be broken or half mad
To find the truth and grab a hold
To say no more and take a stand

Forever on I take this song across the sea and lands far off
Even if I'm only one I would sail this ship alone
Ever on I take this song across the sea and land far off
Even if I'm only one I would be alone in heaven

In the fading hours of day
The time is here yet not in sight
May have to let the wind and tide
Finish what I've begun
I will hold my resolve
No bitterness no regret
Unseen hands take the wheel
As the moon becomes the sun

Forever on I take this song across the sea and lands far off
Even if I'm only one I would sail this ship alone
Ever on I take this song across the sea and land far off
Even if I'm only one I would be alone in heaven
