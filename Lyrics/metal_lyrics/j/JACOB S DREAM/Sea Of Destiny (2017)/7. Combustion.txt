On and on
Who knows where were going
And you know
I got to keep moving

There is dream
A fire inside
I know what I'm here for
Don't stand in my way

I'll make no promise
Ill see yo again
This side of forever
But there'll come a day

On and on
I know where I'm going
Dusk to dawn
The story is telling me

Combustion
Fire in the night
Combustion
Lead me through the night

Hear a song
That sings while I'm sleeping
The voice I know
But the lyrics escape me

Awakened I'm thinking
Of dreams in the night
Telling me something
That I should surmise

Outside my window
The world passes by
Just misty memories
Of places and times

Hear the song
Thats singing inside you
Someone knows
The fear that is haunting

Combustion
Lighting up the sky
Combustion
Set the night alight

Combustion
Lighting up the sky
Combustion
Set the night alight

Combustion
See the fire in your eyes
Combustion
Take you through the night
