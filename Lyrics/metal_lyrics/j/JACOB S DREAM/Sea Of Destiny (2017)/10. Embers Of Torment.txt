A scream broke the night
From a house on a hill
Your last breath was counted
And the veil was removed

What did you see what did you expect
Were fully prepared for what was next
And did the fires of hell
Burn brighter that night
Did the gruesome horde
Howl in delight?

You met your maker
Then you met your master
Oh and I wonder
Did you think that you'd live forever
Your blasphemies never remembered
Or did you not know
What was waiting for you
As sure as lightning is followed by thunder

In the embers of torment
In the fires receive your wage
In the embers of torment
Theres a debt you can never pay
In the embers of torment
Now you knew there would come a day
In the embers of torment
Your master prepared your place

To do what thou wilt
Was the whole of your law
And woe unto anyone
Who crossed your dark path
In secret orders
Under pseudonyms
Rituals magic and madness performed
In perversion and power and heroin
You found no peace for a souls sick with sin

Oh and I wonder
What did you trade your soul for
Knowing what you would face in the end
Afraid and alone
Surely you knew

In the embers of torment
In the fires receive your wage
In the embers of torment
Theres a debt you can never pay
In the embers of torment
Now you knew there would come a day
In the embers of torment
Your master prepared your place
