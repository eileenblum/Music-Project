[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

Really many years ago, someone tried to recreate his world destroyed decades ago. That someone it was me, I thought of love and human nature, trees and lakes and sympathy.

Tears 
When it rains you feel the same 
Tears 
But in the end only my memory remains

Hear my Astrocry Somewhere lost in Space

Lost, without the chance to feel. Killing machines, believers and betrayers said they're hailing me. And what I finally got to see, I made wars and violation, guns, revenge, hypocrisy.
