[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

Black, all I see is black, I don't want to wake up, cause this dream gives me the things that I need so bad, in bad lust I trust because I must.
Rays, many rays of light, they are shining through, I can't believe my eyes as they are shining right on you, you kiss the lips that missed the kiss.

I wondered how to leave this night, seeing all these feelings made of clay. 

Quicksilver light, erase my pain. Quicksilver light, brighten everything. I pray Quicksilver light turn night to day!

Die, wished to die one time not so long ago, felt so much grief inside, a little sadness killed my mind. Blindness is the last interest I miss.
Day, one more day is done once more I survived, even though I don't know what this all could be about. About the best guess I confess
