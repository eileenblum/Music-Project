[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

Did you know I remember lots of moments passed before my eyes. Believe me: I have seen liquid skies.
And one day in December, a dark storm swallowed all the light. And turned my last bright day to night.

And I know that everybody has to go. Sometime somewhere I don't know. Eternal north winds blow.

Blackened final sky, open spaces. 
Blackened final sky, leave no traces. 
Blackened final sky, thinking about a world behind 
Blackened final sky, thinking about things to find.

And I know that everybody has to go. Sometime somewhere I don't know. But before there are things to do. Some words to be sent to you...

If today is a bad day, two better days are waiting right for you. Believe me what I have been through. If you think this is your last day, I tell you time flows like water all through these ancient lands. But there is someone with you 'till the end.

And though I know, that everybody has to go Sometime somewhere I don't know. There are many things to show.
