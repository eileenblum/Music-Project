[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

I was so afraid that I have been too late. Because I didn't know where I had to go. But then I saw you, everything of you, and then I really knew what I had to do.

Baby, I felt down. A king without I crown. Had nothing to lose nothing wrong to choose. Baby, you were fine, wanted to make you mine that night. Until the end of time.

As you are my private demon slippery.
There were so many thoughts that night I couldn't believe.
You are my private demon slippery.

What is going on? I see one on one, cannot realize what is going on. Like a story on a screen, with nothing in between. You seem to understand what I really meant.
I was in the mood to show my attitude in a direct way nothing more to say. No words to describe how this minutes changed my life to better thoughts inside.

If there's a time that I'll see this again. I know that you are not too far to speak the same truth once again. A trip into a thing I do not know. Why are we still here? Don't you think it's better for us to...
GO?
