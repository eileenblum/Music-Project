[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

This is just another night, a million steps away from home, distance by my side. Time is something that goes on, But even something that forgot, where it once came from.

I want to get away. 
I want to go where dark deep waters flow.

Be sure that I am not afraid. There are a million stars above to light my way! And so I'm marching on and on, though I can't say where I come from, I know where I belong.

I want to get away. 
I want to go where dark deep waters flow. 

I want to go where dark deep waters flow. Where stormy winds and wicked waves keep telling me what I still know. I want to go where dark deep waters flow.
