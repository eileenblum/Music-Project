[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

Confusion reigns, since there've been changes creeping into my life, turned my day into night.
I'm falling down, there's no one left to catch me, someone who is there to rescue me before I drown.

I've left the way that seemed so very safe to me. Now I'm living in the blue. 
No one can see me, see the sorrow deep in me. I am changing, so are you.
Please try hard to find me...

Because I am a traveller. I am a traveller in time, waiting for a sign.

Through all these days I am trying hard to get the feeling again that life is not a game.
But who is there? When times are changing people change with them. Nothing wants to stay the same.

And so I try so hard to find a sunny path, even though I feel so blind. 
But to reach it and to stay there for all my life, I must be fast, faster than time.
Please try hard to find me...
