[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

Dare not speak my name. I can always feel the same when you think of me. I feel you.
Somewhere Deep Within Through the Silence I can hear him sing.
Somewhere Deep Within Hieronymus waits for me.
Somewhere Deep Within Lost in Blindness I see him who cares.
Somewhere deep within Hieronymus will be there.

Don't try to seek for me. Don't forget that I can always flee from your crying soul. I feel you and lose control.
