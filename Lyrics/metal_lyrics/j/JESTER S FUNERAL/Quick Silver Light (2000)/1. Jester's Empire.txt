[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

The growing conflict I am burning in rising up to walls that crush down crumbling when I'm within. These tears that sorrow calls.

I am falling down to meet my end lost in time.
Never I'll be coming back again back to light.

There comes the one to make things undone.
As he reigns on, better days come.
Marching on, straight to the sun.
Jester's empire fills the calm with storm. Let thy kingdom come

Walking through the fields of nevermore I meet you again at the bottom of a cold black shore. The Jester strikes again.
