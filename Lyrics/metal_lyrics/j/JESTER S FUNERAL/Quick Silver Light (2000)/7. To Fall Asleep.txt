[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

These moments I know. Minutes of bitter cold loneliness creep into my mind. A more peaceful kind of sadness fills my eyes.
There's no use in lies. The memory still lights up what's left inside the dark labyrinths of life. So I wait for the night to ease the pain inside.
As I still believe...

To fall asleep means more than to meet the night. I fall asleep. Sometimes I make my dreams come live. I fall asleep one more time to meet you inside.
The dawn lights up the sky when I fall asleep.

No word leaves your mouth. No prayer to god that explains what this is all about. So I wonder why you don't miss me at night when the pain stings inside.

I still carry on. I still remember where I come from. I believe that every single day is one day less you're away and all the pain's gone.
As I still believe...
