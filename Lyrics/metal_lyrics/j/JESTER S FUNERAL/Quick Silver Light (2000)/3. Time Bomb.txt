[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

I am scared when the night comes in to tell me I am all alone. I am scared when the day leaves me to tell there's one more night to come.
Staying between walls, I can't hear a single call from the outside of mind, reminding me of better days. But as I try to catch my thoughts I must think of fights I fought, leaving pale insanity.

In the very last moment all the years pass by. What have I become?

You are a time bomb and when you are near colours fade to grey, you are a time bomb your silence is fear and when the time has come. you'll be ticking, ticking, ticking away.

You are a time bomb your silence is fear. You are ticking, ticking, ticking ' til black dust appears. You are a time bomb, you're always near Ticking, ticking, ticking 'til the end appears.

Oh, this horrible scene once again with me, I know every single word. And your voice just echoes what I feel, pretending nothing ever hurts. 
Lying in my bed and still hearing what you said. The wish is growing deep in me: I want to get away. Flying very high like an arrow through the sky, carried by giant birds of prey.

Ticking, ticking, ticking when the sun goes down. Ticking, ticking, ticking when the last light starts to drown. Finally, when the day appears, you're gone...

Pulling me, feeling extremes in me that refuse a life in pain. But all is gone, when the day is done and the night comes in again. 
No one's by my side, when I'm waiting for the night to destroy a house of lies build by someone named like me. Again I try to catch my thoughts, and I think of fights I fought. Leaving pale insanity...
