[Lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

See me try to say:
"Come and embrace me."
My fantasy it will
make me carry on.
What have we done?
We ignore the hands
of time and whatever
there may come,
I know where I am from...

I am born in a different world.
I am born in an older place, somewhere beyond.
I am born in a different world.
I am born in an older place, somewhere beyond our time.
Â 
I have seen the end:
Black and eternal it lay
there in front of me.
I turned around and left
this ugly place.
We ignore the hands
of time and whatever
there may come,
I know where I am fromâ¦
Â 
From the icy lakes
I escaped
and I reached this final place.
this is not how
it was meant to beâ¦
Â
