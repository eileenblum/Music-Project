[Lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

Times and places, bounded spaces
are killing me inside.
There are these days where I just feel
like I should rather hide.

Secret dreams, forbidden nightmares
are buried deep in me.
Waiting to come out and to drink
the last drop of blood in me.

Â I always dream of someone at my side,
we're standing on a mountain high.
And I wonder if there is someone
that it's worth dying for.
If there is someone worth dying for.

The nightmare returns, my grip gets tighter,
but I'm so far away.
I would die a thousand times
if only I could stay.

Perhaps there is place down in the sea,
perhaps a place beyond,
where we can stay and we can hide
from the rest of the world we know.

In the darkest night, I want to be at your side,
standing on a mountain high.
And then I know that there is someone
that it's worth dying for.
That you are the one worth dying for.
