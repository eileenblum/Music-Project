[Lyrics by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Heiko HÃ¶hn]
Â 
A hail of blows, and one of those
wipes out a god forsaken name.
Canât hear his cries, I canât look into his eyes,
my fatherâs son, my motherâs blameâ¦
Â 
My darkest hour, scared my power,
this kind of life is a kind of hell.
No way to choose, Iâll always lose,
Iâm the Assassin I know so well.
Â 
I am better, listen to them,
they told me when I was young.
I am better, listen to them,
I want to stay strong.
Â 
I am the Assassin,
keep me away from the light,
cover my pain inside,
keep me away from the light,
I am my only friend beside.
Â 
Blood on my hands, canât understand,
what is the power that makes me kill?
Iâm on the run, and I canât escape from what Iâve done.
Killed by my hand against my willâ¦
Â 
No decision, my only mission
is to deny my morality.
It was meant , from heaven sent:
Iâm the Assassin for all eternity.
Â
