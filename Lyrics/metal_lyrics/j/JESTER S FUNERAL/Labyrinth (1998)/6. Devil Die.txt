[Lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

Day by day I'd like to scream
for reaching out again!
Back to places I have seen,
straight back into hell!
No way out, I'll see it every day.
I am chained,
so please show me the way out of here!

Night by night they come again,
reaching out for me!
Grinning faces, so frightening,
a nightmare for me to see!
No way out, I'll see them every night.
I am chained,
so please show me the way out of here!

Let the goddamned devil die!

Life by life all is the same,
feel them creeping in.
Who is who, and who'll die first?
Your agony within!
No way out, I'll see it every life.
I am chained,
don't try to show me the way out of here!
