[Lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]
Â 
Why are you crying brother?
Where are the nails that will be hammered in?
Are you lying brother?
You carry the hammer, you will forgive your sins.
Â 
But you have done
everything to make you weak,
to let him grow, the one who waits for you.
Let him tell you what is gone,
what is lost, and what will never come again.
Â 
Now look into the mirror, and then tell me what you see:
âAn old man suffering, his time has come, oh lord
this man here is meâ¦â
Â 
You have waited
for the night to bring your day down,
to let the light be killed by dark doomâs hands.
Now itâs your turn, tell them who you are,
who youâve been andÂ  now you are againâ¦
Â 
You looked into the mirror, and you told me what you saw:
âAn old man suffering, his time has come, oh lord this man here is meâ¦â
Â
