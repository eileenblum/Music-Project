[Lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]
Â 
Very soon there will be a new moonrise.
Itâs going on tonight:
Weâll come to make your body ours.
Weâll rip your hart and take your soul.
And you will pray to God that you had
never been born at all.
Â 
Weâre the destiny, the family for you.
Welcome to your last trip out of life!
Life is going on and on and on.
Â 
I am you!
Weâre alive to seeâ¦
I am you!
Â 
Do you remember all the ones you denied
the power of the night,
theyâre now slaved to the leaders of this world.
Keep on closing your blinded eyes,
ignore the power of light!
But do not say you have never been warned at allâ¦

All music and arrangement by Jesterâs Funeral
