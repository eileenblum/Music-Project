[Lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

Once upon a time there was a man brave as men can be,
strong enough to show the world what he wanted to be:
throughout his life alone!
He showed his courage every mile he walked away
from home to new castles made of stone,
as I said, he remained alone!

But one very cold winter's night,
he walked alone, darkness at his side,
neon black hands came from within:
the fear of fear then was gripping him,
the fear of fear then was gripping him.

From then on he always thought about this night,
he thought of a nightmare he could fight
back, but he wasn't the same.
Every hour, every minute, every day,
he thought of someone he could pray to,
to take his pain away.

And then every cold winter's night,
when he walked alone, darkness at his side,
neon black hands came from within:
the fear of fear then was gripping him,
the fear of fear then was gripping him.
