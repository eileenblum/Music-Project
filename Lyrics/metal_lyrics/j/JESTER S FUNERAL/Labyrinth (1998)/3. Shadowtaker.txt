[Lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

I have seen a million places,
a thousand faces that are passing by.
And I thought I knew them all
from the other side.
This story ends tonight.

Tonight they rise again to stand alone.
And when the sun comes nearer
everyone will fear her,
she's the one who took the shadows far away.

They have seen a million places,
a thousand faces that are passing by.
But never they could turn away,
and so they screamed their silent cry.
This story ends tonight.
