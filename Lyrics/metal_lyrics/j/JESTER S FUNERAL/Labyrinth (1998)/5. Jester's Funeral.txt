[Lyrics by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Heiko HÃ¶hn]

Laughing, howling and in rage,
they keep him caught
in his painful cage.
Never let him go,
and torturing him,
but he has his smile to show.
Laughing, howling and in vain,
when they go insane,
they give him a hail of blows.
But he has to carry on
until the shadows come
to cover his poor, poor soul.

He only wanted fame,
now pale bones remain
in the icy grave.
Nobody mourned for him,
he was all alone,
but he was strong and brave.
Making fun, damned to laugh,
never time to rest,
jests followed by jests.
Welcome to the other side,
it's a place to hide,
and your soul revives in death.

It's a jester's funeral.
Buried with a grin.
Blackness falls in him.
A jester's funeral.
