[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

You sleep so tight. Your thoughts can be somewhere on this planet e. And no one can tell you where you do belong.

As far as dreams go down on earth you should be far away. You realise the more things change the more they stay the same.

Sleep so tight, your thoughts can be. I say something changed your name to Frozen Angel. Come to me. I know nothing will take the dream away.

Years have passed and still you're gone. Still I know where you are from. And no one can tell me where my dreams belong. 

As far as life goes down on earth I know you're far away. But someone in this world will cry when you'll be back again.
