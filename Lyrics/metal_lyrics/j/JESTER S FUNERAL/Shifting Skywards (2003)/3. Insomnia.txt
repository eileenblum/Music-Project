[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

My sense to be: Sticking to a surface below my feet. And when the day is done again I am a witness of setting suns.

And then I hear your call inside my narrow walls, pretending doors are open.

Stay awake â Insomnia
Face your fate â Insomnia
Stay alive â Insomnia
One more night â Insomnia

My soul explodes because I know that distance is getting near. I will get away over hills so high and across the sea.

A landscape beyond my mind is waiting. I burn inside.
