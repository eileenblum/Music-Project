[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

My eyes meet the ground and still I see my world. A world I know so well that I can tell so many things about. Blood is flowing faster as Iâm taking off. And as many miles below the only life I know vanishes I want you to know.

Even when Iâm gone I always will be there for you. Though Iâm marching on I know what Iâll be returning to when the time has come.

A look from high above makes me wonder why someone in this universe has been by my side for all the time. My view is getting clearer as I drift away. And as many miles below the only life I know vanishes I want you to know.

From world to world I fly. As I got empires to raise. I fly away.
