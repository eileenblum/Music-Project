[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Jan Dominik Kucharzweski]

A city built of glass. Lost in this transparent maze reflections taunting me with a strangerâs face. Remember who I am. Clothed myself in hollow names. A non-identity swimming in neon seas.

Like a vapour trail, insubstantial. Like a vapour trail I will fade away. 

City of Glass, mirroring me. City of Glass, refracted dream.

Reference points erased. Cathartic anonymity. When every stepâs retraced patterns will emerge. Disappearances sliding down the surfaces. This world is a design I will redefine.

Iâm vanishing, escaping the locked room. Emancipate! Incarnating, language becoming flesh. Regenerate!

City of Glass, mirroring me, but I donât know the person (that) Iâm forced to see. City of Glass, refracted dream. A translucent image without a scheme. City of glass, devoid of form. Iâm a ghost in a shadow, tattered and torn. City of glass, shedding this skin. Constructing a nowhere, a nowhere within.
