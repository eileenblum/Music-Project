[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

I am someone who tries not to explain I'm a fallen one. Is there anyone who gives me a name? And there she comes.

Through dust I see something moving towards me and into my life. From dusk 'til dawn I feel my self is growing strong. I start to fly. 

Here comes the light of dawn. A message from the sun: "These are your places to be. Places for infinity."

When forgotten thoughts come back to my life I seek for the path. I recall forgotten chapters to my mind, taught in the dark.

Through dust I see again she's moving towards me and into my life. From dusk 'til dawn I feel my self is growing strong. I'm still alive.

Still I can't understand why I am allowed to see those peaceful lands and all about the way it's gonna end.
