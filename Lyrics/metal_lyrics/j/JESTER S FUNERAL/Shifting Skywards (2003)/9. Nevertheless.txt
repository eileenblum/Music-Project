[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

In the beginning of fate I was born into a world where I could be. I was told the secrets of a history.

I can not explain it, but I know where everything is from: my mind just creates it. I don't know why I cannot die. 

Nevertheless (never) I die. Nevertheless (never) I try.

I know the stories you told, nice to listen, though it's obvious they're not true. Do not believe anyone has lived here, been here before you.

I make no reflections about things I do not want to know. Alone, without connection to anyone here I do not fear.
