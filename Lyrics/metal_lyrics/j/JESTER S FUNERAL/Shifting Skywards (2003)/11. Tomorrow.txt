[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

I hear raindrops falling and I look out of my window. What do I see? A world drowned in wet security. Cause this night will end as the nights before. And still I wonder what could be worth waiting for.

Still I do believe in a bright tomorrow. The faith I try to keep lives for a bright tomorrow. But in nights like this I think of grief and sorrow. I wonder will I be in your heart tomorrow.

I remember words and what they meant to me: "Seize the day" they said and clothed me in mortality. Cause what is today without a tomorrow? And so I sit here waiting for sunlight to glow.

I look up to a cloudy sky. Yes, inside of me, there's great belief.
