[music by Stefan Schmidt &amp; Bastian Emig, lyrics by Stefan Schmidt]

Ocean: Deeply drowned in deep blue seas lies a memory which is worth a story to be told of. Mystery, watered gravity is its sense to be for all time into eternity. And so it flows.

See the heaven open tonight. Water's growling, waves are rising high. 

Far beyond your imagination you see the sense of life. Far beyond your expectation you see the reason why. Of ocean and of sky. Sky: High, high up in the sky, above clouds it lies: a dream dreamed too often to come true. You wonder why it often starts to cry. Trying to arrive at a state of life where everyone can fly. And so it goes.

Though this is the end, I can raise my head once more to see over my beloved lands. Something slowly starts to turn my cries into blue melodies of ocean and sky.
