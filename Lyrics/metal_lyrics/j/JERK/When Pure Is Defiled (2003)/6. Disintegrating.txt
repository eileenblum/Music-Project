In line and waiting for somewhere to go
And the dosage today was much too low
I just got there and took my place
And wondered when I lost my face
I think you're safe, I think I'm safe today

Disintegrating my bones are showing and my
My mind is broken, it's chokin', it's somewhere else
Forever needin' and no relievin' when my
My body's taking, it's taking me too far (to far.... to far)

Remember that the world is blind
To simple things (not simple minds)
The veins are closed the well is dry
I think you're safe, I think you're safe from me.
