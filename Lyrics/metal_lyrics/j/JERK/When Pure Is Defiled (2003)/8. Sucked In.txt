Deep inside you everyday, you do not know, I will not say
Your underground makes me ill, if I don't do it no one will 
A simple plan I have for you, try to guess what I will do
Well I can see what you mean, its always harder than it seems

Don't blame yourself for breaking me, 'cause you just went and set me free
Then I set you down and shut your mouth and show you what I always see
There is a small place for you, where all your hopes and dreams come true
You move around my world at will, watch out cause I'm coming to kill 

[CH]
You've been sucked in again and again and again and again
You've been sucked in again and again and again and again
You've been sucked in again and again and again and again
You've been sucked in again and again and again and again

So
Motherfucker come and play
Come on then, come on then, come on then, come on then
Motherfucker come and play
Come on then, come on then, come on then, come on then
Motherfucker come and play

You've broken up cause you're breaking down, and very soon you'll hit the ground
You pulled your stunt your time has passed, the world you made has kicked your ass

[CH]

You've been sucked in again
You've been sucked in again
You've been sucked in again
Sucked in again and again and again
Sucked in again and again and again
Sucked in again and again and again
