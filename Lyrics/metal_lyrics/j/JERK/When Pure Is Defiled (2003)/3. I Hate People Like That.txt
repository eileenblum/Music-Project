Don't you want me?
I like you more if you could save me
But I forget the reason why you think I should care

It's not my problem!
I'll call you when I want some
But I forget the reason why you think I should care

[CH]
I hate people like that 'cause people like that treat you like that... when you got something!
I hate people like that 'cause people like that treat you like that... when they want something

It's like you're psycho!
I tried to talk about it but no
You wouldn't listen when I said it all gets better 

It's time to let it go!
You're only breathing 'cause I say so
And I can tell you that it still won't get much better

I hate people like that 'cause people like that treat you like that... when they want something
I hate people like that 'cause people like that treat you like that... when you got something!
I hate people like that when people like that treat you like that you've got to put your fist in (you got to put your fist in)

And now you're frozen
Caught in the headlights of the chosen
But I'll still be here baby when it all gets better

Hey man that's way cool
Face down in your success pool
Now all the bitches in the world wont make you better

I hate people like that 'cause people like that treat you like that... when they want something
I hate people like that 'cause people like that treat you like that... when you got something!
I hate people like that when people like that treat you like that you've got to put your fist in (you got to put your fist in)

They say thats what you make it!
They say thats what you make it!
