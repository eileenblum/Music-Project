Why should I try?
You'll make me just like you
And I will deny
The things you say are true

Alive when I'm high
This time I'll break on through
I'll tell you a lie
So you can hate me too

[CH]
Why
Do ya think?
Why
Do ya think?
Why
Do ya think?
I think you've lost me
This time it's all brand new
It's killing me killing you
I'll take the black with the blue
Its killing me killing you

Ashamed of the things 
That seem to make you proud
I can hear when you cry
Because the shit's so loud

[CH]

Now you're just like the fucks that beat you up
Just like the fucks to beat you up
[x5]
