I could be wrong
I could be right
I could be wrong
I could be right

I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be black, I could be white

Your time has come, your second skin
The cost so high the gain so low
Walk through the valley
The written word is a lie

Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, RISE

Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
...an energy

I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be wrong, I could be right

I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be white, I could be black

They put a hot wire to my head
Cos of the things I did and said
And made these feelings go away
All feelings in every way

Rise, rise, rise, rise, RISE, RISE, RISE, RISE

Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
...an energy 

Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, rise, RISE
