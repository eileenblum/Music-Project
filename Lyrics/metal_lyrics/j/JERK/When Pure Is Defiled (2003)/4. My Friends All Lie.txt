You pick me up to put me down
Your only joy is when I'm gagged and bound
A subtle prick, a blatant lie, your denial, your denial

[CHx2]
No ones gonna save my life when I'm drowning
No ones gonna give a shit when I die
All my friends try to tell me I'm the greatest
And my friends all tell me, but my friends all lie

My friends all lie, my friends all lie, my friends all lie....

Lost my faith, forgiveness too,
My kindness destroyed all because of you
The futures stopped
Do you like the view
No really it's nothing, no really its nothing, no really....

No ones gonna save my life when I'm drowning
No ones gonna give a fuck when I die
All my friends try to tell me I'm the greatest
And my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
My friends all lie, my friends all lie, my friends all lie....

When I was a child the innocence was deafening
Then something happened that took a bite and left a sting

No ones gonna save my life when I'm drowning
No ones gonna give a fuck when I die
All my friends try to tell me I'm the greatest
And my friends all tell me but my friends all lie
My friends all lie, my friends all lie, my friends all lie....
