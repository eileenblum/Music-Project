What did you say? 
I couldn't hear ya from the other room
What did you say?
C'mon TELL ME TELL ME

What did that mean?
Why don't you tell me what you really think
What could that mean? 
C'mon SAY IT JUST SAY IT

[CH]
If you got something to prove, PROVE IT!
If you got something to do, DO IT!
If you got something to say, FUCKING SAY IT! 
SPIT IT OUT!

What did you say?
You need to tell me 'cause I need to know
What did you say?
C'mon TELL ME TELL ME

What was that then?
Is there something that you wanna say?
Don't walk away now I'm not FINISHED, NOT FINISHED

[CHx2]

I cant hear you
I still cant hear you
I cant hear you
(When you're talking to me)
I still cant hear you
(When you're talking to me)

So what you're saying
Is that I always seem to let you down
But I'm sorry... FUCK IT, FUCK IT!.

So what you're saying
You need to think before you try to speak 
Its not easy.... AHH FUCK IT, JUST FUCK IT!

[CHx2]

I cant hear you
I still cant hear you
I cant hear you
When you're talking to me
I still cant hear you
When you're talking to me
