He remembers when you broke him in
Took away his chance to live
Kill that little boy to set him free
'Cause he had nothing to give

This filthy black and horrid bug
Crawled inside through the eyes
Nerve endings cracked
And see-through now
There is no why

Too late to save
He hates this place
I hate this place
I hate this place

Did everything but fuck him
But hurt him all the same
Funny how it seemed to fade
Hope you were entertained

If I stop now
I still don't sleep
When the worm turns
I still can't sleep
