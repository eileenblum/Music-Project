Don't believe in love, don't believe in hate
Don't believe in destiny or in fate
Don't believe in the future, don't believe in the past
'Cause I know that nothing lasts
Take a look inside

[CH]
I can't take that mask away
It changes every day
And everything you want from me I will take
I feel the way you need I'm struggling to breathe
As simple as it seems, it's just what you need
Take a look inside

Don't believe in the drugs, I don't believe in this place
Don't believe that it's ending, don't believe your face
Don't believe that it's easy, don't pretend that it's hard
Don't believe that you loved me, don't believe who you are (don't believe who you are)

[CH]

Don't believe in you, don't believe in me
I don't believe in love, I don't believe in fuck

[CH]
