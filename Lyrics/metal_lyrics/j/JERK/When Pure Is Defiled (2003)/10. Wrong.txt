You think that it's easy
You think that it hurts me
You think you can hurt me
I'd love you to try
And if you can find me
And if you can see me
And if you can show me
I'd love you to try

Its burning inside you
And then you can't argue
It tears you apart
And I can't help you
When beauty is painful
Your own eyes will burn you
And they'll always find you
Why cant I too?
I'd love you to try

You're so fucking
wrong.... wrong.... wrong.... wrong....
You're so fucking wrong!
wrong.... wrong.... wrong... wrong....
You're so fucking wrong!

You think that it's easy
You think that it hurts me
You think you can hurt me
I'd love you to try
And if you can find me
And if you can see me
And if you can show me
I'd love you to try
I'd love you to try

[CH]

When all you have
Is all you know
