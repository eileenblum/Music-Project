Piss on piss, kiss on kiss, it's a simple math, that on this
Spit on spit, take this hit, I'll make you a deal, you give and you get (you give and you get)

My desire, your flesh on fire, put me out, I'm not tired
Greed on greed, the more I need, lie to your body, pretend to breed (pretend to breed)

[CH]
You're in my blood now my veins turn blue
I get my biggest rush from an injection of you
You're in my blood now my veins turn blue
I get my biggest rush from an injection of you

Feel like a child, naked and wild, your body's my playground, where pure is defiled
Sweat on sweat, the more I get, jump in the fire, this ain't over yet

I can quit any time I want
This aint over yet
I can quit any time I want to

I can quit any time I want
I can quit any time I want to
I can quit any time I want
I can quit any time I want to
I can quit any time I want
I can quit any time I want to

[CH]

Burn you down tie me up for an injection of you.... of you.... of you....
