Took you down for one more hit
When you gonna stop that shit?
'Till the next time it's ok
Slowly watching your decay

Just one more time.... just one last time

Deep inside the living dead
Zombie fucks, retarded head
I know just what you will say
Get the fuck out of my way

[CH]
Why can't you just love me like you love your fucking drugs
You tell me that you hate it but you never get enough

Just one more time.... just one last time

Guess it only mattered when
I turn my back on you again
For a second I felt fine
So I tried to save you one last time

[CHx2]

Just one more time.... just one last time
Just one more time.... just one last time
Just one more time.... just one last time
Just one more time.... just one last time

Without you I found a way
And lived to fight another day
Now you're gone it's plain to see
What the fuck you've done to me

[CHx2]
