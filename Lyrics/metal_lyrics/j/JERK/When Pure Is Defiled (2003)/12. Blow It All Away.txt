Take a long hard look at me, tell me what you think you see
Another one with a broken soul, taken down and looking cold
Tried to blow it all away, sift through the ashes another day
My face is falling, my hands are tied, get up again just to be denied

See the scars they're on my face, feels like I'm falling in disgrace
I feel betrayed with a kiss, I never thought it would come to this

[CH]
Take a bite of my heart, feel it eating inside
Coming straight outta hell, take you along for the ride

Pure but dirty, rich but broke, sane but insane I breath but choke
I'm too smart for your therapy, I know what you'll say, before you say it to me. 

Take a bite of my heart, feel it eating inside
Coming straight outta hell

In the outside, I am inside
I am no one, tried to be one

Strong but weak, I run but wait
Alive but dead, I love but hate. 
I'm numb but hurting, I'm calm but manic
I try to keep my cool, yeah but then I panic

[CH]

In the outside, I am inside
I am no one, tried to be one
