Truth is eternally treason in the empire- empire of lies
For our empire muzzles the lips of a savior who howls corruption
His exploration of reality has ruffled the feathers of a starving vulture
Classified america breeds and multiplies, vastly shrouded from us and even itself
A dark bureaucracy devoted to protecting us lurks beneath our corroding democratic practice
How will anyone create change when we cannot see inside this dark machine?
Classified america breeds and multiplies, vastly shrouded from us and even itself
An era where a military-political demon is hidden from all scrutiny
We must ask ourselves.... but who watches the watchmen?
Truth is eternally treason in the empire of lies
Truth is eternally treason in the empire of lies	
For our empire, muzzles the lips of a savior who howls corruption
Classified america breeds and multiplies, vastly shrouded from us and. even... and even itself
Classified america breeds and multiplies
