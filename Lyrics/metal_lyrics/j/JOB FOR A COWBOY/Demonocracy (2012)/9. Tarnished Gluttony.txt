A monetary plague is digging the world into an economic culmination tomb
Sculpted by the cods who have built their throne upon a foundation of falsity
An elastic currency uncoils and is extracted from the benumbed lingers of millions
Papered bills are lessened as they tarnish with gluttony, a mute nation walks blindfolded
As anarchism rears its face, they are answered by an iron fist
Fixed media arousal, for hypocrisy has its own elegant symmetry
Let an empire cease to exist, entomb the masses as they persist to resist
Let an empire cease to exist, entomb the masses as they persist to resist
An elastic currency uncoils and is extracted from the benumbed lingers of millions
Papered bills are lessened as they tarnish with gluttony, a mute nation walks blindfolded
Let an empire cease to exist, entomb the masses. as they persist to resist
