Place your ear to the ground and cringe from the sound
For the authority driven wolves strut closer with a mocking grin etched across their faces
Marching along with tucked shirts and rust covered badges of acknowledgment
Choking on their triggers and sweeping their unjust under the damp crimson rug
Prejudice? discrimination? or just for amusement and exploitation?
A broken record that continues to breed, a dismembered system that everlastingly succeeds
Tonight this adolescent says hello to his ruination,
Tomorrow the wolves continue their domination
Domination!
