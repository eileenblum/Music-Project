The core of corruption collects its nourishment through regurgitated war and bloodshed
For i softly sleep in a society egocentric enough to cast war,
A blistering infection that continues to spread
Our young are steadily allured into slaughter
All in purpose to make this self crowned sleaze a dollar
These the smeared fingerprints of the gods....
The ever evolving military industrial complex is bleaker than any fabricated hallucination
Opt for change? complicated with this two party system spinning without traction
The ever evolving military industrial complex is bleaker than any fabricated hallucination
These are smeared fingerprints of the gods, the undertaking and domination of nations
The ever evolving military industrial complex is bleaker than any fabricated hallucination
Opt for change? complicated with this two party system spinning without tractions
These are the smeared fingerprints of the gods, the undertaking and domination of nations
