We collectively flock to dispel our thirst from the streams of this depleting blue gold
But the god-like global power shifts away from the earth's
Gelatinous black blood that fuels their darling death machines
The blood fueling and carelessly weaving every lifeless object that you and i adore and yearn
Texas tea bubbling beneath us is becoming the bastard step child of the oil tycoons
For its depleting, shriveling and the world is convulsing in dehydration!
For its depleting, shriveling and the world is convulsing in dehydration!
Black discharge flows, resembling a gaping wound feeding the
Mouths of leeches and vultures under our weeping skies
They've caught on that its running out and move with guillotines and bright smiles
For its depleting, shriveling and the world is convulsing in dehydration!
For its depleting, shriveling and the world is convulsing in dehydration!
Let's all naively sit and watch this progress, allow the common man to have absolutely no rest
We collectively flock to dispel our thirst from the streams of this depleting blue gold
We collectively flock to dispel our thirst from the streams of this depleting blue gold
