We are the children of deceit
Brought to our knees and chained from another's lie
Demonized in the. flowing river of loathsome propaganda
We've been manipulating to construct a weapon the sake of entrapment
Falling victim to a charismatic and enraged tongue,
A cancer singing his delusive gospel
Whispering a melody that blurs the line of innocently observing a plot of mayhem encouraging one
Or encouraging one

A disease with a classified secret aiding the victim, but as a masked ally
Two ungodly prosecutions hinged by an infection playing devil's advocate
