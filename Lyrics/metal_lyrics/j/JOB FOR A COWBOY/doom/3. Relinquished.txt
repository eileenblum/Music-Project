Her mouth stands to convey swarms of plague,
time slowly corrodes as her jaws have locked into place.
At the grips of her own hands

this woman carries her victims to their passing,
they hold back tight.
they hold back tight.

time slowly corrodes as her jaws have locked into place.
this woman carries her victims to their passing,

For when this woman arches back her skin sheds from her bare limbs,
As their flesh, begins to pile, at their own feet
As their flesh begins to pile, at their own feet.

This disease continues to dilate as it immerses through the air,
Immerses through the air
she can no longer hide what she is.
what she is.
Contamination grows in the town where she lays
Contamination grows in the town where she lays
And where she sleeps

Her people before her beg only for forgiveness
Beg only for forgiveness
From their bare limbs
Her mouth stands open to convey
Swarms of plague
Their flesh piles at their feet
Their flesh piles at their feet
Their flesh piles at their feet
