Blood begins to spill from an open sea, dead bodies churn within the tide.

Attachment.
They drift against a now reddened sea.
These rising waters blush as their bodies decompose.
Dozens buried at sea, they swim in their graves.
They've proved themselves being too weak for this attachment,
the tide rises, the tide breaks.
Once again youâve proven yourself to weak for this attachment.
The tide rises(hold) the tide breaks(hold)
As these waters blush
Their bodies decompose,
Dozens of corpses buried at sea
I hope I have made my last point,

The tide rises
You've proven yourself to be weak for attachment
They swim in their graves
They swim in their graves
They swim in their graves
They swim in their graves
Breaks
Theyâve proved themselves being to weak, the tide rises
Theyâve proved themselves being to weak, the tide breaks
Dozens of corpses buried at sea
Dozens of corpses buried at sea
Theyâve proved themselves being to weak, the tide rises
Theyâve proved themselves being to weak, the tide breaks
Dozens of corpses buried at sea
Dozens of corpses buried at sea
The weak have fallen but now (I stand alone)
The weak have fallen but now (I stand alone)
The weak have fallen but now (I stand alone)
The weak have fallen but now
Theyâve proved themselves to weak for this attachment.
