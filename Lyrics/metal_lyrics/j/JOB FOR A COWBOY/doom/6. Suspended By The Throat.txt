Goodbye,
I'll mend your loss.

Let the carcass of the martyr burn,
In the process of...
Process
Your ashes and embers will light up the skies.
Let the carcass of the martyr burn,
In the process of...
In process of,
Your Suspending.
Take My Hands,
You'll be burned before their eyes.
You'll be burned before their eyes.

So let the carcass of the martyr burn,
In the process of...
Let the carcass of the martyr burn,
In the process of punishment.
Let the carcass of the martyr burn,
In the process of punishment.
Let the carcass of the martyr burn,
In the process of punishment.
Let the carcass of the martyr burn,
In the process of...

What more does it take,
To see your death?
What more must be done,
To see you dead?
Suspended
Suspended

Suspended by the throat.
Tonight you'll die.
Suspended by the throat.
Tonight you'll die.
Suspended by the throat.
Tonight you'll die.

What more can it take,
To see your death?
What more must be done,
To see you hung?

Let the carcass of the martyr burn,
In the process of...
No more.
Just die.

Suspended by the throat.
Tonight you'll die
Suspended by the throat.
