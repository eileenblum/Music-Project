I stood in the sand from the mouth of the sea and I watched a serpent rise from its depths.
Upon his horns rested ten crowns as the discord of trumpets grew unnerving.
Its perception giving an overruling mentality of authority and supremacy,
all dwellers of earth shall pray and worship this form of a single demon
whose names are not written in ink or blood in the book of the life of the lamb.
Shal be slain from the foundation of this declining and now decaying world.
