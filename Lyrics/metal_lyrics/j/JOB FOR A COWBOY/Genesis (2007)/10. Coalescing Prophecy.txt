And he opened his mouth in blasphemy deluding their designated God.
His men and women all carry a sacrament of his number.
These followers with their morality of conscionable age have left behind the sign of the cross and redemption.
They have mindlessly chosen the path of social standards.
The path of conformity, with the mark of eternal damnation.

"Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!
For the great day of their wrath has come!"

The sixth forewarning trumpet sirens,
following the demonic armies that surface from the open wounds of earth.
They march toward bloodshed and warfare against humanity,
the limbs and remains from the carcass of man extend across open land.
These once depleted seas and rivers now flourish with the fluids and the bones of conforming followers.
Future existent worlds coalesce into one.
