The demon lord's son, now a ruler of only one nation,
spreading his gospel among millions.
Empires fused and bound together by the fingertips of their distinct leader,
a flesh parade of a converted public altered from catechization,
manipulated and influenced into a sense of delusive calm,
consuming every word spoon fed directly into their beliefs.

As a shepherd carrying his offerings between his arms,
garnished statements maintain and keep his people optimistic and confident.
[? ]A lucrative piece of propaganda [?]
A throbbing army only grows from the misleading tongue of their new ruler.
[?]
One army with new beliefs expanding through demonic designation,
ordered to butcher the existence of anything remotely contrary,
almost as a re-occurrence of times past.
All previous enemies of the forgoing lord have come and gone,
having their own corresponding image of God through their own incoherent reflection.
