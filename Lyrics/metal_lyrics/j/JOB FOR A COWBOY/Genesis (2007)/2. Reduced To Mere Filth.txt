Over time in a world where religion has dispersed,
modern times have shown these connections to slowly deteriorate,
with empires alleging their holy books to have absolutely no flaws -
all accepting everything in its deceitful print.

They pursue to interpret these pages to gather aspiration and formulated belief.
Their community now only falls from expanding socialism - a divided population, disposed.
One half putting their gods to rest now to only praise the antagonist against of what they once worshipped,
his words cradle his followers -
while the other half being sealed out of the world they once knew out of pure ignorance.

Knowing their fate, they absolve to relinquish themselves.
Hundreds, mass upon thousands take on religious suicide.
A religious populace reduced to mere filth.
