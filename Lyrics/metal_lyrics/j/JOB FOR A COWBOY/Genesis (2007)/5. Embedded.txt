An incision leads to the future of the new world -
a mark buried deep under the skin and flesh will define and distinguish man.
Signatures implanted on the hands and forehead.
Re-occurence of modern times and scriptures.
Testament to holy doctrines written in vital blood.

In the extent, all will hold something very similar and accordingly.
All will bear his name with the distinct and original number of his signature.
In a new world with suppressing technology.
Lacerations lead to codes embedded in blood streams beneath the flesh.
Currencies fuse together to form a solitary and overruling capital.

Money evolves into cryptic letters and numbers that flow through the net -
a conflagration set to diminish papered riches, depleting its masterdom.
No longer capable of enslaving the likes of human kind from only presenting itself as a form of an object.
Fragments of ash flow through the atmosphere's currents,
onlookers breathe and inhale what they once worshipped.
The demon's solution, a new world order.
