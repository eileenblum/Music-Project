Blood
Blood
For your lust of me
I cannot stop the pain
Why did you fuck with me?
And now I'm drowning inside
Though you are nothing to me

You wanted to pay
You want like a saint
You are like a saint
For these words from your rest from your broken skies
Suspended farther
Now these words will die day in black is this what you wanted?
These lies seep in to death, You conserve to much of your shit
You become unwanted

Suspend your body now these words are dead
Forever dying
You fuck with me?
Damn right
Now you are nothing and I'll fuck you over
Die again, drowning today.
Someone
Is someone away
You lie,lie to me!?
I will remain
My regret will remain
Remain a walking corpse,
No, my regret
Lie not now
Not my regret
