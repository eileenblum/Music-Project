The last one standing the last to breathe, is innocent in my eye
The last one standing the last to breathe, is innocent in my eye
Lies killed the promised land, the light cuts us out, only to bring us,
To what we once called home, swallow this regret,
Humanity shall remain, swallow your obsession, new found force will shine.
This is a war, this is a war, this is a war, this is a war, WAR, this is a war.
You broke this promise, you can't trust me, this world was all full of lies.
You will choke on my life, you will choke this life.
You, you itch the nerve
You, you burned it down
You, lied
Swallow this regret, bitter days shall remain, swallow your obsession
New found pride shall shine, she won't hide, and she shall bury another sign
She won't hide!
You will choke on my life, you will choke on my life.
This is a war, this is a war, this is war, this is war, WAR! this is a .. war!
