Summon the servants that are chained at the throat by a tarnished chain only devoted to their prosperous fathers
A grip so tight it bruises the neck when the beast exhales the horror's that settle internally
Galloping toward immoral intent with the set bounties on the heads of the righteous
The dismantled bodies given back for validation and gratuity to amuse the gods of fortune
The itching appetite grows as these hounds unearth the leaders and thieve on the lives of the weak beneath them
Aggravation dissolves into a joyous laughter as the oppressors loan vows to benefit the wealthy
And cast down the frail hero by hero slaughtered in vain, assassinations of demigods in secrecy
A never ending pattern to cast down the frail and throne the elite
