I have found my face gnawing away at my own existence again
It's feeding and medication on the ballooning hunger for a formulated religion
For my Lord comes in a tiny capsulated form
Restore prayers with inebriation - my dependency
A substance helping me string
And I must carefully weave my life in a destructive, spiraling transcendency
These divine elements shine a light so radiant when synthesized
A celestial antidote to cure all
A heavenly impurity to alter what we know as God
