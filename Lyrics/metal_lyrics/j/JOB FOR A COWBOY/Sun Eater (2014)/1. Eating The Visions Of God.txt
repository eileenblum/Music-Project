I am staring at the Sun of the Nothing
For I want to eat the visions of God
Consuming the knowledge and power that radiates overhead
As I slumber in a bed of vegetation and thorns leaving behind unease and dread
I feed from pretentious notions and malignant demons through its rays
For hell is abandoned and this single horror walks amongst our ongoing cliches
My eyes, my perception - They seem to smolder and whiten
For it seems that I have peered into the diseased display of myself
I am the eater of the sun
I am the destroyer of worlds
