Hell breaks open with the drop of a synthetic plague
With flames marching and consuming the roofs of thousands. (Thousands)
Frigid ammunition streams and buries into the howling blameless
Butchering them to their feet.

Immersed with guilt the armed horde
Tread through their unspeakable execution parade.
Honor and acclaim simply masked
By falsified journalism of a gutted soldier.

Now fallaciously lay the flag on your lifeless heroes
With a delusion of holy devotion and pride.
Spread and unfurl your poster boy
Deception to the mindless believers.

Immorally manipulate the ignorant
Swarms for the sake of soiled wealth.

Hell breaks open with the drop of a synthetic plague
With flames marching and consuming the roofs of thousands.
Frigid ammunition streams and buries into the howling blameless
Butchering them to their feet.

Frigid ammunition streams and buries into the howling blameless
Butchering them to their feet.

Hell breaks open.
Hell breaks open with the drop of a synthetic plague
With flames marching and consuming the roofs of thousands.
