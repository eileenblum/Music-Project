Let the money glutton kings recommence
Their laws with a hushed signature of starved power.
Silently wielding their supremacy
Blindly over the heads of a shackled empire.

A thirst so immense that it violently chokes the majority rule
To have absolutely no clout.
A nation stripped naked of all rights from the fingertips
Of ravenous dictating wolves.
So simple for them to justify, so utterly effortless to execute.
The crowned kings spoon feed a crippling and fear mongering agenda.

With new commandments birthed and implanted,
They compose phobias from the running blood of thousands.
Stand before your corporate Gods
Intoxicated on money and power.

Let the money glutton kings recommence
Their laws with a hushed signature of starving power.
A thirst so immense that it violently chokes the majority rule
To have absolutely no clout.

A nation stripped naked of all rights
From the fingertips of ravenous dictating wolves.
So simple for them to justify, so utterly effortless to execute.
The crowned kings spoon feed a crippling and fear mongering agenda.

The crowned kings spoon feed a crippling and fear mongering agenda.
With new commandments birthed and implanted,
They compose phobias from the running blood of thousands.

[Solo]

A thirst so immense that it violently chokes the majority rule
To have absolutely no clout.
A nation stripped naked of all rights
From the fingertips of ravenous dictating wolves.
