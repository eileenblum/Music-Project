Propel this solitary man in front of us with his corrupted global agenda muttering into his ears.
Corporate money stuffed into his pockets to spread his darkened gospel.
In the past the crowned once held the covenant to shape and develop a better world.
Their influence and supremacy built by generating optimistic and confident perception offerings to their herds of sheep.
Time repeats itself and outspoken pledges continue not to succeed, the people have renounced their trust in ideologies.
Safety and protection is the contemporary vow for the role that will reinstall masterdom and control.

Corporate money stuffed into his pockets to spread his darkened gospel.
In the past the crowned once held the covenant to shape and develop a better world.
To rescue us from uncertainty and peril that we are visionless to see or interpret,
A threat that evidently needs to be fought in a manufactured, waged war,
A vile misconception that has unfurled unquestioned
while being exaggerated and disfigured (and disfigured.)
