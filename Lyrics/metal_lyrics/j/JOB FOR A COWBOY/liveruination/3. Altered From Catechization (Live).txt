The demon lord's son, now a ruler of only one nation
Spreading his gospel among millions
Empires fused and bound together by the fingertips of their distinct leader
A flesh parade of a converted public altered from catechization
Manipulated and influenced into a sense of delusive calm
Consuming every word spoon fed directly into their beliefs
As a shepherd carrying his offerings between his arms
Garnished statements maintain and keep his people optimistic and confident
A throbbing army only grows from the misleading tongue of their new ruler
One army with new beliefs expanding through demonic designation
Ordered to butcher the existence of anything contrary
Almost as a reoccurrence of times past
As previous enemies of the forgoing lord have come and gone
All having the corresponding image of god through their own incoherent reflection
