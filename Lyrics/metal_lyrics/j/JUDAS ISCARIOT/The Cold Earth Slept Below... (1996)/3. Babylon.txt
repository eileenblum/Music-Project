[An excerpt from "To The Jews" by William Blake]

The fields from Islington to Marlybone,
To Primrose Hill and Saint Johnâs Wood:
Were buried over with pillars of gold,
And there Jerusalemâs pillars stood.

Her Little-ones ran on the fields
The Lamb of God among them seen
And fair Jerusalem his Bride:
Among the little meadows green.

Pancrass &amp; Kentish-town repose
Among her golden pillars high:
Among her golden arches which
Shine upon the starry sky.

The Jews-harp-house &amp; the Green Man;
The Ponds where Boys to bathe delight:
The fields of Cows by Willans farm:
Shine in Jerusalems pleasant sight.

She walks upon our meadows green:
The Lamb of God walks by her side:
And every English Child is seen,
Children of Jerusalem &amp; his Bride
