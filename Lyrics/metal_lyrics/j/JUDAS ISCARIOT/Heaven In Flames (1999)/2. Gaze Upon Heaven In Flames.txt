hail beauty darkness
blessed be the kingdom of night
wretched blasphemy
warriors to the dark

evil in my veins
swallowing death like an age
dark demons rise above
glorious darkened night

on me, on my darkened face
on raging blasphemies
darkness falls

destroying the holy
gloried be the kingdom of the hell
eternal darkness, deep into the unknown
dead be the holy ghost
as I mark the kingdom of the snow
torture in blasphemy
by my eyes rises of war

on me, on my darkened face
on raging blasphemy
darkness falls

you, the forest splendid
I blissful death
soar down the burning gates
gaze upon heaven in flames

hail beauty darkness
blessed be the kingdom of the night
wretched blasphemy
warriors to the dark

evil in my veins
swallowing death like an age
glory to the dark
glorious
