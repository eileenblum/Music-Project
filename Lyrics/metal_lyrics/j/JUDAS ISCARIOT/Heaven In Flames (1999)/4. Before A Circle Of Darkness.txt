first, we poison the rocks of blood
feel, the fires of hatred
blood, raise the blood of sin
blood, my bleeding heart

torment, loves the scums
circle of darkness
the blood, the black, the pain
in unholy torment

hell, feel the pains of hell
sleep, deep in eternal sleep
time, lost in earthly time
bleed, bleed, fucker bleed!

torment, loves the scums
circle of darkness
the blood, the black, the pain
in unholy torment

the dreams before death
the rocks of time
the dust of life
blessed be the darkness

the dreams before death
the rocks of time
the dust of life
blessed be
