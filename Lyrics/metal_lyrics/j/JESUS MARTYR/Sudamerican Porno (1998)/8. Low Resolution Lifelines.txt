DOWNWARDS
WE GO LIVE NOT TO SURVIVE
A CLEAR DREAM TO HUMANIZE

CAUSE I DON'T NEED
TO PLAY YOUR GAME
WHERE ARE THE THINGS
SUPPOSSED TO GAIN
BELIEVE IN ME MY FRIEND, YOU KNOW
I'M GOING HIGH WHILE YOU GO DOWN

SKIES LANDS MIND FLESH
BUILD YOUR OWN PRESENT
FOLLOW YOUR WILL A VALID WAY

CAUSE I DON'T NEED
TO PLAY YOUR GAME
WHERE ARE THE THINGS
SUPPOSSED TO GAIN
BELIEVE IN ME MY FRIEND, YOU KNOW
I'M GOING HIGH WHILE YOU GO DOWN
