YOUR EYES KEEP CLOSED
TO SEE YOUR INNER PURITY
NO VIRGIN MINDS
CAUSE THERE ARE
PLEASURES THAT AWAIT FOR YOU

NO HUMAN
CAN FEEL IS SAFE
FROM AIDS
NO HUMAN
NO ONE'S IMMUNE TODAY

I TAKE (AWAY) ALL YOUR DREAMS
OF XXX-ISTENCE
A BROTHER THAT DIES
I'M A VIRUS THAT GNOWS YOUR LIFE

NO HUMAN
CAN FEEL IS SAFE
FROM AIDS
NO HUMAN
NO ONE'S IMMUNE TODAY

I'M BLACK, I'M WHITE
I'M THE RACE YOU ARE
WHILE YOU KEEP DIVIDED
I CONQUER YOUR BLOOD AND RUN

NO HUMAN
CAN FEEL IS SAFE
FROM AIDS
NO HUMAN
NO ONE'S IMMUNE TODAY

LIFE IS GUILT
LIFE IS FILTH
LIFE IS NOTHING BUT A RISK
I KILL
YOU DIE
