I CHANGED MY MIND IN ALMOST EVERY WAY
GOT DOWN TO LIFE STARTED TO LIVE AGAIN
GIVEN MY SELF ANOTHER SECOND CHANCE
THE ONLY WAY TO FEEL COMPLETE WITH ME

CHOSEN A WAY TO LIVE ASIDE THE FAKE
WORN OUT OF BEING THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS
DESECRATED
WHAT DO YOU SEE? YOU SEE THE REAL ME
I'VE LEFT BEHIND A PAST THAT I DON'T WANT TO LIVE

PLAYING A ROLE THAT NEVER FIT WITH ME
NOW FACE MY LIFE EXACTLY HOW IT IS
FEELING DEPRESSED TO LEAVE A PLACE TO JOY
WON'T BE THE SAME A NEW WAY I HAVE DONE

CHOSEN A WAY TO LIVE ASIDE THE FAKE
WORN OUT OF BEING THE ONE THAT'S ALWAYS
DESECRATED
WHAT DO YOU SEE? YOU SEE THE REAL ME
I'VE LEFT BEHIND A PAST THAT I DON'T WANT TO LIVE

FUCK YOUR TRENDS, YOUR WAYS, YOUR LIFE
CAUSE I CAN SEE NO FUN
FUCK THE THINGS THAT I HAVE DONE
CAUSE I HAVE GOT ENOUGH

FUCK YOU SILLY PLEASURES
I REALLY PRAISE MY TIME
FUCK YOU CLOUDY FANTASIES
I WANT A REAL LIFE
I'VE BEEN SO BLIND
I LIED TO LIFE
BACK TO BASICS, BACK TO ME
I WANNA BE MYSELF
BACK TO MY RELALITY
CAUSE IT'S MINE AND NO ONE ELSE'S
I'VE BEEN SO BLIND
I LIED TO LIFE
I'VE BEEN SO BLIND
I LIED TO LIFE
