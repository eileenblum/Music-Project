THERE'S A NAIL THAT PERMIATES
MY EARS TO REACH THE BRAIN
TAKE IT OUT OF ME NOW
CAUSE THERE ARE WORDS I'LL NEVER
SHARE

TURNS GOSSIP TO IDEAS
WITH A FACE DISGUISED OF TRUTH
NOT TO SEE ANY MIRROR
AFRAID OF NOT FINDING YOU
TAKE IT OUT OF ME NOW

CAN'T YOU SEE THE FEAR
YOU ARE SEEDING IN THEIR MINDS
A LORD DELIVERS PLEASURES
TO THE NEUTRAL, EMPTY MINDS
KEEP ASKING MYSELF
WHAT LIES BEHIND YOUR MISTERIES
YOU SAY YOU ARE CLOSE TO GOD
AND YOUR GOD TO ME

DOESN'T REALLY EXIST
TAKE IT OUT OF ME NOW
