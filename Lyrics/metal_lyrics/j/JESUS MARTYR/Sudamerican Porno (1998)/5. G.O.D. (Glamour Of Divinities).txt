I SAY
WHAT IS FAKE
LIFE'S MINE
IN TRUTHS AND LIES
YOU KNOW
I SIT UPON THE TRUTH
AND ALRIGHT!
YOUR FAITH IS STRONG
LIFE IS REAL
BUT SEEMS TO FADE AWAY
I PUNISH
WHEN YOU GET OUT OF WAY
I SET
LAW AND ORDER
MY NAME
YOU DON'T KNOW WELL
AND YOU CAN'T BE
ALL YOU WANNA BE
YOU'LL SEE THE THINGS THAT I WILL LET YOU SEE
LIFE IS REAL
BUT SEEMS TO FADE AWAY
I PUNISH
WHEN YOU GET OUT OF WAY
YOUR FEAR'S
THE ONE THAT MAKES ME STRONG
YOUR TEARS
WILL LET ME BE YOUR GOD
I SAY
WHAT'S RIGHT
DECIDE
WHETHER IT IS RIGHT OR WRONG
I SAY
WHAT'S RIGHT
DECIDE
IF YOU ARE ALIVE OR YOU ARE NOT
I FALL
WHEN DOUBTS ARE BORN
I CRAWL
WHEN YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED
CAUSE YOU MAKE ME BE WHEN YOU BELIEVE
I RULE BECAUSE YOU LET ME RULE YOUR FEELINGS
GOD'S A LIE THAT EXISTS
IN YOUR MIND, AN INVENTION
GOD HATES ME!
I CAN'T STAND YOUR BLINDNESS
FUCK YOUR SACRED REASONS
MEAN NOTHING
MEAN NOTHING
