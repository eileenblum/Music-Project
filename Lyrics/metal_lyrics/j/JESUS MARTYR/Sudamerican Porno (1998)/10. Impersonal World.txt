A SUPRAMENTAL
STAGE OF LIFE
I LAUGH AT YOUR VIRTUES
AS I GET HIGHER 
A FLOOD OF SILENCE
MY WORLD BECOMES
SO PERFECT, REAL
IMPERSONAL
IMPERSONAL WORLD

FLOAT IN THE AIR
MY INSTANT LASTS
I USE TO BE ASHES
AND NOW I'M FIRE
I SHRED YOUR LIMITS
I CLIMB YOUR WALLS
I'M RUNNING SINCE
I LEARNT TO WALK
IMPERSONAL WORLD

OF GOOD AND EVIL
I AM BEYOND
AND OLD MAN TAUGHT ME
CAUSE I AM DUE
TO SMASH YOUR KNEES
IMPERSONAL WORLD
