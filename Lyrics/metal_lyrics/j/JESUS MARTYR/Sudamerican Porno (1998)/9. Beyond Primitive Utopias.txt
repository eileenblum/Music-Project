I CAN'T LIVE MY LIFE HOW IT IS
CAUSE DECADENCE INVADES ALL MY DREAMS

WASTING TIME TO REACH OUT THE TRUTH
I REALISED THAT IT PULLS ME UNDER

BREEDING
A NEW WAY OF LIFES
TURNING
MY FUTURE INSIDE OUT

NEED TO BE THE KING OF MY REIGN
A LAND OF HOPE, DISASTER AND ANGER

VALUES THAT MEAN NOTHING TO ME
I'M TEARING UP A WORLD YOU CALL PERFECT

BREEDING
A NEW WAY OF LIFES
TURNING
MY FUTURE INSIDE OUT

FUCK YOU PIG, I DON'T WANNA BE YOUR MARTYR
FACE TO FACE, THERE THINGS YOU GOTTA KNOW
PIECE BY PIECE, I HAVE

LEFT YOUR BODY BLEEDING
I BELIEVE, CAUSE I'M DRAWING MY OWN FAULTS

PASSIVE SOULS WON'T TAKE ANY RISK
I WON'T SHOW SUBMISSION TO PRESENT

POSITIVE, I MADE MY BEST CHOICE
I CAN FEEL THE STRENGHT OF REBORN

BREEDING
A NEW WAY OF LIFES
TURNING
MY FUTURE INSIDE OUT
