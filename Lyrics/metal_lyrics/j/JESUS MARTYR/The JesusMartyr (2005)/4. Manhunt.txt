When i was truly gonna plan demise
What a hand what a fuck pulled back
This times don't seem to fit me
So we must fly there
I squeeze myself
To turn my nerves off
Displayed my chest
To let the bullets flow
Died every day
In someone else's cross
So we can fly there
So now feel i know
So now feel like glow
