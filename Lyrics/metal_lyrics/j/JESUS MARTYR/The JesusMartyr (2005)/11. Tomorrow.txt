Last time surrendered
Last time had
All that you needed
But had to give up
To that you don't know
But had to give up
When it truly began
But it's know
The time to you dream
You are free
I know i want it to
And know you want to kill
And going down
I like the feeling today
It's another fake, dark waters
Pray tomorrow, pray tomorrow
To set you free
Fuck tomorrow!. Fat tomorrows
That set you free!. I want it now!
You want it now
Revolution again
Set you free
That's it!. Running
Away from me
Running again
Like flash
Running away
Forever
