I guess the times of the brilliance
Have passed by
Mourned with chastity
I guess the times
Get never enough
I've taken rest from boredom
And as I'm here mysanthropia
Is just legs upon the streets
But goddamn it
I gotta bleed all the way
My fellas goodbye
Never forgive
Never forget the hollow
I left behind all the troubles
I never had
Shared lobotomy
You love like that
Forget is fundamental
But goddamn it
I gotta bleed all the way
