Strikes divine
A time
Ahead waits
My zonda burns
And far
Ignites from sky
The earth quakes
Pray i pray
For not to be away
I pray, i pray
For nunca mas
I'm blowing
The wind
Just to let
You flow
I'm blowing
The wind
Just to burn
Just to let
You flow
It's time
To say goodbye
To the filth
Stop
Living a lie
I'm gonna
Let you burn
I gonna
Blow and blow i know
I'm gonna
Let you burn
I gonna
Blow and blow i know
