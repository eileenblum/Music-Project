Fake, fag!
Nodding upon a mirror
You call your son
It's time enough
Straight ahead
Lies a miracle
Before your eyes
It's a miracle!
Your time has come
It's physical
And carves with strength
Your heart of stone
And you
What's said
Heart of stone
It's a miracle
It's no way,
I've gone nowhere
What's this ancient nowhere?
It's no way,
I've gone nowhere
What's this?
I don't know
Take me!
Got to be a part
Take me!
Got to be apart
