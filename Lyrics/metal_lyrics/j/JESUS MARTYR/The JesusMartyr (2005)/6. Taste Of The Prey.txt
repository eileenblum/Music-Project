How many times everyday
How long do i have to say
Fool
Your heart is bleeding for nothing
It's time to preach
Shine for me
How many times i will die
It's time to resist
Don't stop me now
It's time to resist
Just drag me down
Squeezed to my heart
I hate those martyrs that
Laugh
That claim to be free
And now you feel it more
Than tomorrow
I never listen then
I never learn
It's time to resist
Don't stop me now
It's time to resist
Just drag me down
Squeezed to my heart
I know what
You do in the brain
I know what
You do in my pulse
