Set myself to ignition
Multitudes of fictions
Sorted the bones to build my cross
And cast spells one by one
We are the ones
For whom the traps
Never worked
Crashed into madness
We want this fire to burn
We take it back to nowhere
Swirl back to nowhere
And raise some prisons for you
Join barbarians
Babylon waits
Blood in your veins
Deep inside
We know we are right
And loved it to be there
We want this fire to burn
We take it back to nowhere
Swirl back to nowhere
And raise some prisons for you
Reborn
Set myself to ignition
Shiny sparks of friction
Satan's born my Satan
This madness once more strikes
