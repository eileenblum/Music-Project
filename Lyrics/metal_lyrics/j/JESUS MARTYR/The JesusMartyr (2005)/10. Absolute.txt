I go for a minute of action
I hope to be a way to reaction
I gotta take the chance
I gotta take revenge
And it never felt
So goddamn right
Gotta let go!
Body moving!
Gotta be in shape
Body moving!
Gotta be fit
It's been a hard surrender
Hope to see you again
And it seems
So far to be so close
It's out there...
It's out there
To refuse
