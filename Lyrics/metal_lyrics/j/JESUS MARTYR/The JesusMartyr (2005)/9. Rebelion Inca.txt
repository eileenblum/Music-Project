Go back, go back
Where the present
Is still not born
Go now, see the light
And it won't turn off at all
I waste my time
But now
My time's gone
Lay in a row
It's feels so warm
And now it's said
To plan rebelion
You lonesome
Your love song
It's said so
And no more
I waste my time
But now, but now
It's gone
