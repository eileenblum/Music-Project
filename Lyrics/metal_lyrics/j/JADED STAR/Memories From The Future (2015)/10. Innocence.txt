[Music: Kosta Vreto/Maxi Nil, lyrics: Maxi Nil]

Break this silence of the world we live in
I can see us screaming with no sound
Searching for something in a world of nothing
Have we sacrificed our purity in vain?

Bring back the innocence you
squeezed out from inside
without it weâre going nowhere
This is not the life we dreamed of
but we wish you well
I guess we will see each other in hell

What else do you want from me what is that
you need to see, we both know that I will
always stand my ground
Searching for something in a world of nothing
Have we sacrificed our purity in vain?

Bring back the innocence you
squeezed out from inside
without it weâre going nowhere
This is not the life we dreamed of
but we wish you well
I guess we will see each other in hell

Is that the life youâve always wanted me to
have and beg for more?
Iâm not the one youâre searching for, Iâm not the
same anymore
Youâve taken all the soul that was left in me so I
guess Iâll see you in hell.

Bring back the innocence we had
Without it weâre going nowhere
This is not the life weâve dreamed of but we
wish you well
I guess we will see each other in hell
