[Music: Babis Nikou/Maxi Nil, lyrics: Maxi Nil]

Feel my hand while i stand here before you
Proud and unbound
Taste this land while this hand forces your
face against the ground
Youâll always remember my name
It will always drive you insane
The fact that behind your every door youâll see
your own creation

Over and over again cursing the years
the tears Iâve spent
I should have crushed you between my hands
But here I stand on you own destruction
Then again watching you down on your knees
my friend brings me the need just to put an
end, take my hand
And this is my final answer to you

Youâll always remember my name
It will always drive you insane
The facet that I cut all the chains
and pulled through
All the chains!

Over and over again cursing the years
the tears Iâve spent
I should have crushed you between my hands
But here I stand on you own destruction
Then again watching you down on your knees
my friend brings me the need just to put an
end, take my hand
And this is my final answer to you

And the dipper i dig the more pain i feel

Over and over again cursing the years
the tears Iâve spent
I should have crushed you between my hands
But here I stand on you own destruction
Then again watching you down on your knees
my friend brings me the need
just to put an end,
(and consider this the end)
take my hand
And this is my final answer to you
