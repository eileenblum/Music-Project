[Music: Kosta Vreto/Maxi Nil, lyrics: Maxi Nil]

You smile like you donât care
You look outside
The air feels colder than before

Youâve always loved the rain
And now you feel no pain
Nothing can harm you now

Then a light embraced your fear
Whispered softly in your ear
It is alright my dear
Itâs over now

Over the hills you wanna fly
Over the rivers that youâve cried
Over the mountains
where everything subsides
Fairies will guide you above this world
Angels will catch you if you fall
Nothing in this world will ever harm your soul

Youâve always walked alone
The path youâve made your own
You kept it out of sight

Then a light embraced your fear
(and washed it away)
Whispered softly in your ear
(weâll take you away)
It is alright my dear
Itâs over now

Over the hills you wanna fly
Over the rivers that youâve cried
Over the mountains
where everything subsides
Fairies will guide you above this world
Angels will catch you if you fall
Nothing in this world will ever harm your soul
