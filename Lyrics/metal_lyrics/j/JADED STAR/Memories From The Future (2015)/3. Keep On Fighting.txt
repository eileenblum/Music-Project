[Music: John Macris/Kosta Vreto/Maxi Nil, lyrics: Maxi Nil]

Way up above and underneath the surface
Well hidden all, the mysteries and broken
Dreams of us all.
I hear the call I feel it all around me
And if I fall this burning inside
Wonât let go, yearns for more

But weâre here weâre alive weâre still dreaming
And this flame is our guide through
The darkness
The answer is near

In this fire Iâll hold still
No one has to know now the pain I feel
Promise I will keep on fighting
Now and forever more [2x]

Sometimes we feel the world
Spinning around us
Will this reveal the emptiness all over me
Nothingâs real

As the breeze turns to wind, then the wind
Into a storm and Iâll start bleeding
This is real

But weâre here weâre alive weâre still dreaming
And this flame is our guide
through the darkness
The answer is near

In this fire Iâll hold still
No one has to know the pain I feel
Promise I will keep on fighting
Now and forever more [2x]

Cause this is who we are
Burning like a star
Nothingâs gonna kill
The fire in our heart

And we will keep on fighting
