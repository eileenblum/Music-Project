[Music: Babis Nikou/Maxi Nil, lyrics: Maxi Nil]

Wake up wake up wake up
Last chance to live the life you wanna
Get up get up get up
The time has come to face all your fears

We live we die that is no lie
So just be all that you want to be
Open your eyes to brighter skies
Be that change youâve been dreaming

In this world that we live in
I will never believe in

Lifeâs not complicated
Just fight for all your dreams
Appreciate it
Donât let go donât waist it
If you believe then sure
Youâll make it
The power is in your hands
Leave it or take it
Wake up wake up wake up

Wake up wake up wake up
Last chance to live the life you wanna
Get up get up get up
The time has come to face all your fears
We live we die that is no lie
So just be all that you want to be
Open your eyes to brighter skies
Be that change youâve been dreaming

In this world that we live in
I will never believe in

Lifeâs not complicated
Just fight for all your dreams
Appreciate it
Donât let go donât waist it
If you believe then sure
Youâll make it
The power is in your hands
Leave it or take it
Wake up wake up wake up
