[Music: Babis Nikou/Maxi Nil, lyrics: Maxi Nil]

You feel you heal everything that once
Was killed
This time for real, but the fear keeps
coming near
Maybe itâs the end all inside begins to bend
This pain is true
But Iâll get over you

My heart is cold I donât feel anything at all
Youâll see, youâll see, youâll see
Iâm growing strong Iâm done with all I broke
this bond
Youâll see, youâll see, youâll see

Whatever you need just go on and take it
Cause Iâve got to go, Iâve got to move on now
Maybe itâs the end everything begins to bend
The pain so true
But Iâll get over you

My heart is cold I donât feel anything at all
Youâll see, youâll see, youâll see
Iâm growing strong Iâm done with all I broke
this bond
Youâll see, youâll see, youâll see

My heart is cold I donât feel anything at all
Time heals times kills all fears
Iâm growing strong Iâm done with all I broke this
bond
Time heals, time kills... youâll see
