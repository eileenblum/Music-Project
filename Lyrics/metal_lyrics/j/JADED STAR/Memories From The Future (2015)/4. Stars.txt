[Music/lyrics: Maxi Nil]

Can you please just give me a reason
Why should I keep on with the fight?
All these years Iâve kept all imprisoned
It felt so good just to hide
Inside me Iâm dying, I want to believe again

Tonight the stars are waiting
For my wish
I can feel they are calling us to the sky
Can you feel it?
Now itâs time to see the truth
All the stars they are shine for you

All my life Iâd get all these visions
One day my dreams will come true
But i kept it all inside made
the wrong decisions
Having no suspicion of those who stubbed me
in the back
I know that itâs time to feel Iâm alive again

Tonight the stars are waiting
For my wish
I can feel they are calling us to the sky
Can you feel it?
Now itâs time to see the truth
All the stars they are shine for you
