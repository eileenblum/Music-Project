[Music: Babis Nikou/Kosta Vreto/Maxi Nil, lyrics: Maxi Nil]

Why do we cry about things
that come to make us smile
why do we even care letâs try to fly
falling is the easy part
but weâre not here to fall
mistakes are here with us weâve made then all

Come with me and come what may
trust in me remember that you promised
you would stay
So come with me believe in me
Together we will find our way
into the end of time

We always hurt ourselves to see
if we still bleed
And we forget weâve got one life to live
Walking in the shadows is the only way
we know
The light is here with us we wonât let go

Come with me and come what may
trust in me remember
that you promised you would stay
So come with me believe in me
Together we will find our way
into the end of time

Come with me and come what may
you promised you would stay
So come with me believe in me
Together we will find our way
into the end of time
