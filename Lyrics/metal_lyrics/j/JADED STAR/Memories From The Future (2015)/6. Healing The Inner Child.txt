[Music: Babis Nikou/Maxi Nil, lyrics: Maxi Nil]

Release the light you hide in you
Then realize what you can do
As life goes by you find it hard to jump
into the wild
Right here right now the time has come
to heal the inner child

Breath with me
Higher power calling
Canât you see?
Doors are waiting but youâre forced
to walk the line

Time goes by let go the fear
Wash all memories away stop
holding them near
Head up high you must believe the power
comes to you once you start to forgive

Release the light you hide in you
Then realize what you can do
As life goes by you find it hard to jump
into the wild
Right here right now the time has come
to heal the inner child

Release the light you hide in you itâs over now
Let go the inner child
