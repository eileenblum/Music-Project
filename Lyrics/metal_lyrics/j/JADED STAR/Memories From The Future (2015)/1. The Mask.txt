[Music: Kosta Vreto/Maxi Nil, lyrics: Maxi Nil]

And after the storm the moonilght appears
And we find ourselves buried
under the fallen stars
The night is calling pure passion now
Conquers our minds
Still neither of us is willing to take off the mask

I canât keep my eyes wide shut anymore
I feel like Iâll explode
I canât keep my eyes wide shut anymore

But you, you should take all the courage
You need to explore yourself
Will you give me the love that i need
With no regrets
Is it you that will care for me
While you run away
Come hold me, unfold me and Iâll put away
All my mistrust

The magic has faded I wish I could make
The first move right now but are you the right
Person to trust?

I canât keep my eyes wide shut anymore
I feel like Iâll explode
I canât keep my eyes wide shut anymore
But you, you should take all the courage you
need to explore yourself
Will you give me the love that i need with no
regrets
Is it you that will care for me while you run away
Come hold me, unfold me and Iâll put away
All my mistrust

The magic has faded you can take off
Your mask
I am the only one you can trust
You were the god that gave me hope and then
You took it all away breath in me the air hold me
Like you care you donât even dare

But you, you should take all the courage
You need to explore yourself
Will you give me the love that i need
With no regrets
Is it you that will care for me while you run away
Come hold me, unfold me and Iâll show you the way
