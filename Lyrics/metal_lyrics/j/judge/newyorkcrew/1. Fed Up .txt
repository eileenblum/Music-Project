I've been down that road, and I won't go again
It took its toll on me and all my friends
Now I'm tired of settling for less and playing the fool
Keep it away, I'm trying to keep my cool

AND I'M FED UP - FED UP

You say I'm not cool, because I'm choosing my friends
I won't have that shit around me ever again
I'm denying some rights, so you'd better keep it clear
Because you step on mine whenever you are near

AND I'M FED UP - FED UP

Smoking that butt, it makes you mature
A slave to sex, and you tell me you're pure
You slam that beer, it makes you a man
I'll try to keep my cool, but you better understand

UNDERSTAND
