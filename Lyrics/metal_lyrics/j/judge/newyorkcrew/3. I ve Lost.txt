If only I could put it into words
The way I feel
Telling myself that the situation's not real
Lost and sometimes I feel
I have nowhere to go
Because you tell me it's wrong
To let my feelings show
I've lost my place to turn

I know I fucked it up
I turned away
One too many times
Suffering from an ego trip
That left me fucking blind
Friends are telling me
The loneliness will go away
But the memories will be there
As long as the ink in my fingers stays

I choose to stay away
Because I want to keep control
My head is thinking straight
But my heart says explode
The thought of someone else
Is much too much
And friendship means
You're just beyond my touch
