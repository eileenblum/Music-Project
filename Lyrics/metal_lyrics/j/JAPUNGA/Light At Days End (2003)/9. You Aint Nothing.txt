What the fuck is up with this?
You want to live for nothing with a fucked disease
It doesn't make a difference can you believe
Only one condition that I'm not alone
I will do it what it takes

You want to be alive
It don't take much to be
I know that I will survive
Try taking something from me

You ain't nothing
Keep coming back

You ain't nothing

What's the use in bringing me
Bringing me this far to leave me in the dark
You drag me like I've never seen the dark in my life
I close my eyes I hold my breath I'm at the end
Have you got what it takes?

Life is set to death
From the very moment you breathe
Living lies on a needle
Taking life out on me

You ain't nothing
Keep coming back
You ain't nothing

You ain't nothing [x4]
