I can see your smile I remember
Tears run down my face I surrender
We die tomorrow we dance as the rain ends
There is no end we fly on forever

I can take the fight, I can make it right
I can stand alone, strength is on my own

I screamed I begged I prayed
I lost I gave I paid
You take your fake I hate
I cried but still I rise

A thousand days have gone and I still try
I have no faith my hands have been tied from
We have to fight survive or we die for
How long we live in dreams that we run from

Can you justify, can you judge my life?
I can free your mind I will set you free

I screamed I begged I prayed
I lost I gave I paid
You take your fake I hate
I cried but still I rise
