Have you seen what's after
What do we see when we fade away
If I knew the answer
Would you believe me
Or would you be afraid?

Light the day's end
I'll be back resend
What I have seen it leads to be
The end of days not yet will be

As I lay here waiting
I am fading will I disappear?
Nothing is forever
I have seen it if you don't believe

Light the day's end
I'll be back depends
My trust in you it leads me to
The end of days is after you

The end of days, end of days
