I'll never take it make no mistake about it
I'll never fake it no one could ever say that
No mother fucker ever helped me fight I take the struggle
In life I stand I fall pick me up ill fight to save my pride, my pride

Let's go

We will all be judged along the path to freedom
Nothing we can say to stop our death our fate
Money power hates the mistakes we make
Another day another crime we live in fear we're never going to see the light, the light

Give no reason, bring me before the kingdom
In life I have the wisdom I have needed
We all stand alone with our convictions
Against the wall of death we hold our breath
To hear the reason

We're born we're born
