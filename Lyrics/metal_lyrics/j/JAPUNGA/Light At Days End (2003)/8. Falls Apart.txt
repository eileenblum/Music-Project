It doesn't matter what they say I don't give a fuck
I'll do as I please never been the one to hold anyone back
Some of us elate over someone who falls
Not me I'll be true until the day I'm called
You got to stand your ground

Upholding the fight to survive

One chance you'll get
Don't let it slip to the next
Spend your life in regret
When you get to the path
What you've wanted from the start

I've seen it all fall apart

Whatever has become of the life that we lead
Too many of us listen what we're lead to believe
Don't listen to those rat fucks never evolve
Some days I am wishing that I'd never been told
You got to stand your ground

Upholding the fight to survive

[Repeat chorus]

One chance you'll get, don't slip regret
You'll cross the path don't fall apart

Easy come easy go I'll be the one who knows
I won't waste my time
When I'm gone on my way close my eyes and pray
I will feel no pain

Upholding the fight to survive
Am I living here just live and die

[Repeat chorus]
