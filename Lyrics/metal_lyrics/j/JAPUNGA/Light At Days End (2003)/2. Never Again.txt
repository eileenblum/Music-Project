See I remember those who doubted
Everything I held together
I believe in never ending
What we dream will go on forever

I don't need any help to see
That you will get what you deserve
See everything comes out in the
I believe in, I will see that
Time and time again
I'll never take it

I have lived with no respect, no help to give
My life a meaning
Before I see my life has changed
I now believe it was not the answer

Do you believe in what you do
Never with thought of consequences
How can you live with yourself?

I believe in, I will see that
Time and time again
I'll never take it

I've been waiting all my life
Just to figure out was it all a waste of
Time reveals things you don't want to see
I still don't believe that it happened to me

I believe in I will see that
Time and time again
I'll never take it
I believe in
