I can't take it I hate

Telling everybody overrated and sold
I will not be faking never done what I'm told
Nothing left to give everything to gain
Everybody makes mistakes
You will stand on your own

Judging me so bad cause I'm young and I'm old
Paying out on me, why don't you leave me alone?
How can you be sure this is what you live for?
Nothing more for me to say
I'll be moving along

We stand and we fight stand up for your right
Who cares we all pay the price
Stand
Fight
For your right

I can't take it I hate

Speaking my own mind because I've nothing to hide
Everything so hard sometimes I'm lost in my pride
No other choice for me this is the only way
I have lived with no respect, no help to give
My life a meaning
I will live a life full of pain
That's the price I will pay

I can' t take it I hate

We stand up and we fight, stand up for your right
Who cares we all pay the price
Stand
Fight
For your right
