No more I'll take it to the place I hate
I'll never be the same erase
No fuck will ever take the fact that I was
Giving nothing more to life then

Stand I deliver every promise that I
Make my integrity will take me to the
Next time I stare death in the face
I stand alone I'll wait I'll stand in line

Against the wall of every corner that I take
We stand together everything is in our fate
No fuck will give me one more reason
And I'll take it to another level

Test my ability to stand out from the rest of
Every fucking wannabe that jumped on
All of them now changing for the
Next changing for the
Next wave fucking craze a fabricated waste of nothing

Steps on my own falls from above
Alone here I stand, alone here I am

[Repeat chorus twice]
