My life what I believe
Most people cannot see
I stand to take the fall
I've seen it all before so

I find within myself
Truth without a doubt
I've come this far alone
I'll get there on my own

I've made a lot of mistakes
I've put my life at stake
I still don't understand
What the fuck did I do that was

Wrong for me to hide
Time's not on my side
Cross it from my heart
It's tearing me apart
All in the end [x3]

I'm not what people say
You live I live my way
Why I pushed from place to place
I read it in their face so I

Say what I believe
Respect that I receive
Proves my honesty
Will come out in the end

All in the end [x6]
