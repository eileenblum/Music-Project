Only once you have tasted the earth
Only once you have touched the sky
You shall embrace life without reason,
without pain. 
Reach for the altered states of freedom.
Find a place inside your sorrow
and build a castle.
Freedom is not a word
but a state of mind.
The wings that you are looking for
are already there.
Open your eyes
and caress this precious vision
this fire burning off
the sky.
