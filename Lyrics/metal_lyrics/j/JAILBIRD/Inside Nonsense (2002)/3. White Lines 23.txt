Your evil side is taking over
again
Your torments and your fears are revolving around
your actions
The dark side of your mind
is nowhere to be found
You are looking for answers,
looking for a sign of life
in this promised land
But the logic of hate
is still haunting you
and the scholars are forgiving your words 
Since you became the seeker of light,
this nucleon messiah implored at the cross
that we are erecting in your name
give us salvation Father !
