When the land of your father
is calling you again.
Find the time
to embrace your loneliness.
When the sun is leaving the sky
for a better end.
Find a place in your heart
to remember your mortality.
So one day,
you shall wake up from reality
and just leave your mind behind, 
since there is nothing left to do.
So one life,
you will feel the rain upon your skin
knowing that it is your mother crying,
since your father became an old man
looking for his gold.
