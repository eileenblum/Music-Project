Agree to die. 
Accept what is waiting for you beyond. 
Accept that faith is your only guide through Heaven.
Pray, my Indian child. 
Do your prayer,
and accept that death
is only the continuance of life ...
... or the beginning of something new. 
A new kind of play.
A conception of a new world. 
Send your last prayer ! 
For, at last,
you'll never reach God
more closely !

(... you'll be one with God!)
