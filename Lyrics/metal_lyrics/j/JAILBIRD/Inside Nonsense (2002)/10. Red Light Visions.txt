Your blood and your life,
simply the essence of your being.
But who'll miss you ?
Leave the dimension that is forcing you in
you do not understand
why your mind seems so weak.
Leave the experience that is forcing you out
you do not belong with us. 
You buy yourself a share of Heaven,
while leaving your innocence
at the Gates.
You reach for the words
that were spoken in time,
while forgetting their meanings.
Reach for the light
that's calling you
Just don't deny that force
that's burning in your veins.
