[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

One more night alone
There's got to be another way
My love is so strong
Why must we be so far away
Theses feelings inside are
All I have to tide me over
Till we meet again
And take this pain away

Take this pain away [repeat]

Out in the night 
So many faces that try and please me
I don't give them a chance
To play around with my heart
I know for sure 
It's you and me against the world
It won't tear us apart 
Till our hearts beat together again
