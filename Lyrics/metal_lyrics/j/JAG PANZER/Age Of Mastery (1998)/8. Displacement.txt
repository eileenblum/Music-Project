[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

Circus goes 'round in my mind
Leaving all logic behind
How can I be living here ?
When I am no where near

Imagination has got the best of me
Turning one man into many
Outside I am silent
Inside I'm so violent !

[Chorus:]
Displacement
I'm beside myself
Displacement
Am I me or someone else ?
Displacement
Struggle to find a way home
Displacement
No longer alone

Busy inside all the time
So many live inside my mind
Some have such loving ways
Some need to inflict pain !

[Bridge:]
My name is legion for I am many
Inside we are all we need
To release myself from this prison
Reborn into flesh again
My friends shall follow leaving no one
A shell of human remains
The many out weight the one
My sacrifice made will be you

[Spoken:]
HATE, LOVE, ANGER, DESIRE, JEALOUSY, LUST, DESPAIR.

Trigger responses to fear
The weak one is no longer near
Impulses that drive me to
Things I don't want to do
