[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

Throughout the ages war has brought forth change
A promise for our children's sake
Tyrants and their visions build us walls of fear
The price of these walls are lives at stake

A change of seasons causes wills to bend
A rising of the populations hand
One glance at freedom begins a raging fire
Uniting every race throughout the land

(IRON)
Forged in fire
(EAGLE)
Flying free
It's presence brings forth victory
(IRON)
Forged in fire
(EAGLE)
Flying free
It's power commands respect
IRON EAGLE

Condemned to silence a lifetime full of tears
Regrets forever scarring empty souls
Cursed by a past that no man should have to bear 
Evict the madman, regain control

One heart, one mind
We leave the past behind
One heart, one voice
We have made our choice to fly

Up from the ashes springs life anew
Shedding the skin of repression and remorse
Renew the vision of union hand in hand
Raise the flags let the IRON EAGLE soar !
