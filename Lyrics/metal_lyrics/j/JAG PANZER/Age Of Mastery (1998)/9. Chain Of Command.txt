[lyrics by Bob Parduba]

They sit in silence as we march into war
There we will fight with our backs to the wall
No end in sight cities one by one they fall
Children screaming in the night as we answer the call

CHAIN OF COMMAND united we stand
Onward to victory the CHAIN OF COMMAND

How will we know if it's worth fighting for ?
They made it a game and we become the pawns
Decisions they make never give us a choice
Why do we stand for the CHAIN OF COMMAND ?

Distant warriors our dreams are so longer seen
Innocent lives shattered in vain. No!
Why are we here ? Do they really care ?
Red skies light the way home

Give them my life is what they believe
Sacrifice our rites to live in peace and liberty
What we believe is we fight to be free
Chaos in nations forming insufficient greed

They sit in silence as we march into war
Together we must stand for the CHAIN OF COMMAND
