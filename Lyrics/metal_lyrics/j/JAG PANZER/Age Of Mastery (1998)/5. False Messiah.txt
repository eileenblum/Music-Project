[lyrics by Jack Starr]

Was it written in the book that all would come
To bring PEACE and JOY to the land
Speaking in tongues that all would know
The day of judgement had begun

Follow me said the stranger
I'm the shepherd oh can't you see ?
This kingdom is yours. Eternity awaits
But first you must come to me

Oh beware
You can never tell
Oh beware 
Of the false messiah's return

In the final days three lights will shine
In the east and then be gone
And the lamb and the beast will join the host
As the day becomes the night

The dead will rise, the blind will see 
And the lame will walk again
