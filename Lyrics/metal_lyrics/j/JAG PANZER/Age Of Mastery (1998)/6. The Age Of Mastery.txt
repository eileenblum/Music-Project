[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

Since the beginning of time man has ruled the earth
Deemed the principle power over all
As time plodded on mans knowledge grew
Till he was no longer man but a GOD

To be the lord of all
You must first conquer yourself

Pages of time unfold for us all a mystery (The mystery of life)
Ages of time elevate the mind 
ours is the age of mastery

Centuries of learning on computer screens
The information age is on
Splitting the atom the power to end all life
Blending of cells gives life reborn

Striving to become creators of the perfect race
The blending of pure strain carbon life
Are we becoming the masters of our own race?
Or racing blindly into the night
