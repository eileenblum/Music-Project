[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

Ticking of time echoing into a memory
Spending our lives on a wheel
Spinning around unaware of it's heading 
Unguided course with the future as the keel

Out of the past into the millennium
Mastering life we're facing our fears
The challenge is ours into the millennium
We live in the twilight of the twilight years

Lessons well learned so many retained
Unless they are used they are lost
Our conscience our guide on a new journey
History's blood is the cost

Silently we walk down a corridor of shame
Unseen footsteps lead the way 
Finger points to a sea, a sea of voices screaming
Go back, unlock our souls and throw away the key

At our journeys end will hope still survive ?
Who will walk this earth when we've all gone ?
Time goes on unceasing every second is new hope
Another circle of life another chance to change

A new age is born out of despair 
New hope for this world is alive
Our children will lead us on a new journey
History's lessons will guide
The future uncertain what dangers await ?
Is the ticking of time on our side ?
In this world so much hatred, sorrow and greed
Only the strong will survive !
