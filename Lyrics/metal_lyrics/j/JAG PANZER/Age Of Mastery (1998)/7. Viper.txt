[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

A flash of his blade turns your screams into silence
He laughs in your face as your life fades away

King of the night  time 
Black as the night and colder than steel
The VIPER
Injecting his venom deep inside of your soul
The VIPER

Lord of the night 
I ride on air
I will take you down, down

Wicked within turning dreams into nightmares
Nowhere to go when this cat is on the prowl

He laughs in your face as your dreams turn to silence 
He laughs in your face as your life fades away, away, away, away, away, away, away
