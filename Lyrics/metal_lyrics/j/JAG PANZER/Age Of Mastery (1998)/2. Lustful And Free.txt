[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

A people of virtue we're not 
Cold blooded metal burns hot
Scratching our way to the top
A wheel once is started no one can stop

With minds full of pleasure
Hands full of greed
Metal hearts burn with fire 
We are born to lead

LUST FULL AND FREE

Sporting our leather with pride
So hard to keep it inside
Hot -blooded creatures of sin
No force will halt this wheel once it spins

Living our lives without fear
Metal is the life we adhere
Racing our lives to it's end
A powerful legion with wills that won't bend
