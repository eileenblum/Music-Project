I welcome the cold winter's chill
Caressing me and stinging me
A heart that no longer feels
The sun is gone its warmth is fading away

All of my days have led to this
Nearing the long awaited kiss

Now as the winter sets in
My tired bones are aching me
My time is awaiting its end
I welcome it as a long lost friend
Lead me far beyond no longer see where I have been
Far beyond the veil of wasted times
And dreamms that often fade

A legacy made in my name
Not left behind all wasted time
A life led without shame
Come take me now for I am ready
Stand the test of time please carry on what lve begun
Learn from my mistakes
And live this life with kindness and love
