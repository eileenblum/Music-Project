Into the fog we go not knowing what we'll find
We're travelling far below many days are left behind
The men are racked with fear shaking from the cold
What course has brought us here to a place we should'nt go

Far beyond our hopes
Beyond nightmarish dreams
Far beyond all fears
Beyond our darkest schemes
Far beyond our hopes
Beyond all hopes and dreams
Far beyond all fears
Beyond what we will ever know

Approach a wooden gate that reaches to the sky
What perils lay within or should we wonder why?
Drums pound from deep inside a warning to turn back
Pounding rhythms our beating hearts attack

Suddenly a quiet hush engulfs us all
A scream of terror a shot rings through the wal
Shall we run away or sternly hold our ground?
Evil surrounds us and takes our souls on down
