Ancient scrolls and transcripts
Alert us of how we began
Plucked from the stars and dust of this earth
Now we are man

Lord of the earth our main intention
Men are infants in the timeline
If it were not for divine intervention
Dust we were made
Dust we will now return

Man's knowledge has grown
We have so far to
Become as the ones who engaged in our birthrights
Bask in their heavenly glow

Why do we fight one another?
It's not part of the plan
Harmony in union as we are all brothers
Show us we're being the best we can
