I am you and you are me we are all the same
Energy flowing through our veins no one is to blame

Forging paths we do not know amidst the fire and the flame
Releasing inhibitions soaring to an endless sun

Feel the fire
Of our spirit
Feel the fire
Of our spirit
Feel the fire
Of our spirit

Casting aside all the thoughts that divide
Joining as one form a bond
Lasting for time after time withour end
Fire of our spirits carry on...

Break the ties that hold us down taking to the sky
Release our feet from off the ground open our wingy to fly
