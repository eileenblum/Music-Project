To foreign lands we are tasked to go
An ancient crypt a bottomless hole
What treasures are hiding there?

An ancient world who dares to go?
Great mysteries we left unknown
What treasures are hidden there?

Dare to be bold
Dare to lead
Dare to expose great mysteries
Dare to take hold
Dare to conceive
Dare to venture beyond all belief

Eyes cannot believe what things I see
Treasures and wonders beyond belief
No one must know what's here
The more we look the more we find
Things unearthed that history left behind
No ore must know what's here

I must find a way to make this mine
To claim it for myself as my own find
Bury them all with truth
Claim this find and all hidden below
Soon there will be no one left who knows
Bury them all with truth
