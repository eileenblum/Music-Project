Break forth out of the frost and into the sun
The gleam and glory of steel is the only one

Forged from the fires that temper our will
We are one in the same both born of the flame
Rising higher and higher brighter than the sun

Daring all to stand in our way will fall as before
Fear not the path that we take whatever's in store

Stronger now than ever before and well on our way
Our history refreshed and renewed we start a new day
