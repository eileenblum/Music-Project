When our fears have all ended the tears spent and doneWhen the skies shed no more lightComes the setting of the sun Fly on, soar above it allFly far beyond the sun In union we are brothers in union stand as oneIn union as all of us in union we are one Danger's rounding every cornerFear splitting every sonWhen we face another adversary?We will do what needs be done Fly on, soar above it allFly far beyond the sun In union we are brothers in union stand as oneIn union as all of us in union we are one In union we are brothers in union stand as oneIn union as all of us in union we are one Now together we forge a new world far better than beforeNo longer fall for anythingWe will rise in strength once more Fly on, soar above it allFly far beyond the sun In union we are brothers in union stand as oneIn union as all of us in union we are one
