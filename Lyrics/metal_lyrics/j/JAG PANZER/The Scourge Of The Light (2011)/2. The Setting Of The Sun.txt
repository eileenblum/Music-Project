I am alone, I am my own
Do whatever I do
I am a man; I am a god
A pauper just like you

All is well with the setting of the sun
All is well with the setting of the sun

Cause to fight, cause to die
For the glory of truth
Cause to rise, cause to fall
It's all bitter yet true

Teach to beg, teach to rule
The master is not you
Teach to love, teach to hate
Now wicked and cruel

All is well and nothing is undone
All is well and no one is the one
All is well and the victory is won
All is well with the setting of the sun
