Years flow within and without future ebbs in its wake
Mankind using all of her wares do they know what is at stake

Tearing down the final curtain before the curtain call
Bringing all our greed to the table
It's bringing on the end

Through the years we all are guilty of our complacency
What will it take for us all to listen to our history?

Tearing down the final curtain before the curtain call
Bringing all our greed to the table
It's bringing on the end

She was a golden child in her infancy
She had so much to give. Give it to me
Taking everything she had for my own greed

Tearing down the final curtain before the curtain call
Bringing all our greed to the table
It's bringing on the end

Too much that has been taken can never be replaced
No return for the god forsaken mother earth is all a waste

Tearing down the final curtain before the curtain call
Bringing all our greed to the table
It's bringing on the end
