King of all the purveysLord to many and no onePrince and a fool flow in his veinsOutlaw running freeChasing gold and gloryWomen he meets never forget Master of the seas, tyrant of the waves Sailing the seas for goldRiding the windswept wavesLiving just as he pleasesNo care for the codeScourge of the seven starsSalty in dispositionReputation precedes himBe it friend or foe to the overlord The world is playgroundInviting all to attendWhere he rests his head is where it residesFamous and infamous man, testing the waters of gloryThe winds they lead him wherever he roams Master of the seas, tyrant of the waves Sailing the seas for goldRiding the windswept wavesLiving just as he pleasesNo care for the codeScourge of the seven starsSalty in dispositionReputation precedes himBe it friend or foe to the overlord Dead men tell no talesLiving men live no longerThe duchess she cries "Off with his head"A chest of gold awaits the strongest and the courageousYet thieves are found at the end of a noose Master of the seas, tyrant of the waves Sailing the seas for goldRiding the windswept wavesLiving just as he pleasesNo care for the codeScourge of the seven starsSalty in dispositionReputation precedes himBe it friend or foe to the overlord
