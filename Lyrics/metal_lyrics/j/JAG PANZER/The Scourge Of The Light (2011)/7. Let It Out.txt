Follow me I'll take you thereTo a place whwre no one has a care(oh beware)Hands of time are moving slowTake this time to let your demons go Let it out! Now don't you hold it inLet it out! This time you've got to let it out Let it out! Let it out! Pull the fire from your soulRelease its flame and watch it take control(you're in control)Time is now like never beforeLoose the tiger hear this beast roar! Let it out! Now don't you hold it inLet it out! This time you've got to let it out Let it out! Let it out! Raise your hands and give a shoutLet your inhibitions come screaming out(let it out)Take the devil by the hornsShow the devil what it means to burn Let it out! Now don't you hold it inLet it out! This time you've got to let it outLet it out!
