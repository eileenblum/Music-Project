Dark of night is our playground
Live our lives in the gaze of the moon
Cold ice flowing through our reason
Hell has no fury like a nation scorned

We are all brothers by blood
All uniting for the same cause
Hardened steel out of the fire
This is our call to arms

Giving none taking all
Stake our positions standing our ground
Striking hard without a warning
Our only goal is the mission abound

We are all brothers by blood
All uniting for the same cause
Hardened steel out of the fire
This is our call to arms

No remorse
Never a regret
Justice on our side
We will have you yet!

Final days are approaching
Soon justice will be tasted by all
Liberation by attrition
Come my brothers heed the call

We are all brothers by blood
All uniting for the same cause
Hardened steel out of the fire
This is our call to arms
