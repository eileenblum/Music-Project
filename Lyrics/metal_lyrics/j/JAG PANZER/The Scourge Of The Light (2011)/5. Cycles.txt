Take me down to the floorShake me down to the coremake me chomp at the bitWatch me crawl and plead and fitAll the while you're in controlSeeing right into my soulLike a child I curl and cryFor the flesh I'll taste tonight Turn the screw hear the creamSomething juicy in betweenDripping, drenching, pouring outWho is master there's no doubtWith each scar I know my placeMarks of pleasure can't eraseSmell the musk thick in the roomWarning all impending doom You make me begYou make me pleadYou make me burn(Make me bleed)When I am torn, you lick my woundsThen I return... Turn the table time to feedTime for you to beg and pleadWith each thrust I spill out lifeDraining out from deep insideBody bursting to erruptFrom your cup that I now supEver flowing ecstasyIn your knees it's time to feed You make me begYou make me pleadYou make me burn(Make me bleed)When I am torn, you lick my woundsThen I return...
