Are these the answers I've sought?
Is this the message
I need to clear my conscience and bring peace
These symbols now what do they mean?
The same on my body reveals a secret and a path

I've heard this story before
But never in such a way as to strike me to the very core
These pages coming alive with every sentence of truth
They bring me answers to a new life

Lead me on; carry me into truth
Carry me onward to glory, glory
Lead me on; carry me on to the end
My eyes see the end of this story

This story my flesh now reveals
Conjuring some sort of truth
Hidden among these strange new patterns
My body a canvas of hope
Piece by piece they connect a mystery hidden for all ages

Lead me on; carry me into truth
Carry me onward to glory, glory
Lead me on; carry me on to the end
Let my eyes see the end of this story

These are the answers I've sought
This is the message I need. The final answers of all time
These symbols are visions of hope
A door to the other side. A new awakening of the mind

Lead me on; carry me into truth
Carry me onward to glory, glory
Lead me on; carry me on to the end
Let my eyes see the end of this story
