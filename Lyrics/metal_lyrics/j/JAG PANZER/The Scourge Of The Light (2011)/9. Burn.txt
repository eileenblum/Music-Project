In the heat of the spot light I watch you run
Dripping kiss of the fortune tellers tongue
Charging into the dark streets, nowhere to turn
Your heart now pounding starts to burn

Could this be all for you? End of your line?
The very air you breathe is scorched
Will this be all they see? No history here
Will you leave quietly? Or will you burn?

Do you have all the answers? Do you care?
Surely you can trust me if you dare
Let's have a look at the blood stains on your clothes
From where they came no one knows

Could this be all for you? End of your line?
The very air you breathe is scorched
Will this be all they see? No history here
Should I leave quietly? Or should I burn!

I can see you there. I know where you are
I know everyone around you
I know what you've done. I know where you've been
I could be right behind you

Screaming out to no one inside my head
The enemy is close I feel the dread
The answers inside me hold justice within
It's time to start the wheels to spin

Could this be all for me? End of my line?
The very air I breathe is scorched
Will this be all they see? No history here
I won't leave quietly. It's time to burn!

Now this is all for you the ending of your line
The very air you breathe is scorched
This will be all they see? No history here
You won't leave quietly. This time you burn!
