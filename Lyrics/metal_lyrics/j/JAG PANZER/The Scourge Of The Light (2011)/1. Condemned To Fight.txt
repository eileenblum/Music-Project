When it's time for us to overrun them
When the time has come to force a change
Then it's time for us to come together
Then this time we see the future rearrange

Damaged and desecrated
Corrupted and controlled
Conformed to one man's vision
Pushed back against a wall

Taking all from us and giving nothing
Taking every freed man's rite
Lies are covering truth's perfection
Lies are smothering in site

Damaged and desecrated
Corrupted and controlled
Conformed to one man's vision
We are now condemned to fight

Calling all the eyes and ears now open
Calling all of us to stand and fight
Overpowering the old repression
Overpowering with a new insight

Damaged and desecrated
Corrupted and controlled
Conformed to one man's vision
We are now condemned to fight

Hearing all of this madman's grumbling
Heading now the rebels call
Victory now is ever present
Victory now and forever more

Lies cover truth's perfection
Lies smother all in site
Take all and give nothing
Take every freed man's rite
Damaged and desecrated
Corrupted and controlled
Conformed to one man's vision
We are now condemned to fight
