Spirit forgive me for I had sinned
Oceans and deserts, lost souls in the wind
Time rolls on like a cold winterâs night
To hang from the cross, the child must died

Fire in the valley â a suicide
Child in the alley â a suicide

No food on the table, with war on their head
The mass graved sinners, the no name dead
Breath of life whispers past your soul
A cavalry blue sinner, as black as coal

Fire in the valley â a suicide
Child in the alley â a suicide

Say a prayer, say a prayerâ¦
Say a prayer

Do you understand what happened that day
They slaughtered our kin, they slaughtered our way
A manifest destiny is what they teach
Our souls arenât for sale, theyâre way out of reach

Did you hear the tale of the headless corpse?
A sinnerâs breed, and the devil scores
Want to know why man could kill a child
Just because another calls him savage and wild

A prayer for the dying, the weak and the old
Forsaken this child, both beaten and cold
Native is our skin, invaded is our land
Death to the tyrant, united we stand

Fire in the valley â a suicide
Child in the alley â a suicide
