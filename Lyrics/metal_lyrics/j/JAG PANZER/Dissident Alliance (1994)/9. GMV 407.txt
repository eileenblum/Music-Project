Tried to pass you by â couldnât do a lie
From the inner mind â a dead passer by
Take ya from the back â out like a light
Can you taste the kill â sheâs screaming in the night

Gonna get you real â licking up your thigh
Bitch is gonna do â or sheâll tell a lie
Bathe in your blood â naked in your sin
Donât you know she dies â cause sheâs fucking all the men

Bastard wants to cry â raped as a child
Bastard wants to die â psycho driven wild
Bastard sends a chill â cry to your heaven
Bastard wants to kill â GMV 407

Had to steal your life â soul is gone forever
Doesnât really matter â so fucking clever
Feeling really good â slip it to the dead
Bitch is gonna die âsheâs covered in red

Bastard wants to die â raped as a child
Bastard wants to cry â psycho driven wild
Bastard sends a chill â cry to your heaven
Bastard wants to kill â GMV 407

G M V 407
G M V 407
G M V 407
G M V 407

Bastard wants to die â raped as a child
Bastard wants to cry â psycho driven wild
Bastard sends a chill â cry to your heaven
Bastard wants to kill â quarter to 11

Bastard wants to die â raped as a child
Bastard wants to cry â psycho driven wild
Bastard sends a chill â cry to your heaven
Bastard wants to kill â itâs all GMV 407
