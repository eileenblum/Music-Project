Mother, please donât let me be
Dreams of a madness I just canât leave
Woman whisper, to see me bleed
You crucify my, twin, an evil deed
Trigger happy, it hurts to cure
Falling lunacy, a hopeless despair
The purest virgin, so very rare
You empty the void, the panzer lair

Forsaken child â youâre beaten and cold
Forsaken child â youâre growing old
Forsaken child â a child in the mist
Forsaken child â a child with aâ¦

Father, did you really lose your pride
Men in the street, the beast come alive
Tell a story of long go
Dragons and witches and streets of gold
Fairy tell tale of summers hate
The dragon is slain and time doesnât wait
Dear mother, dear father, oh can you tell me please
Dance, devil dance, pagan rain

Forsaken child â youâre beaten and cold
Forsaken child â a child growing old
Forsaken child â a child in the mist
Forsaken child â a child with a twist

Castleâs burning, a Christian crusade
The harvest moon, out there they lay
The name is religion, to slaughter your kin
The harvest moon, let it begin
Brother, brother, oh can you tell me please
Kill a virgin, down on your knees
The heads are abounty, put these words
Fiendish clown, curse, curse, curse

Forsaken child â youâre growing old
Forsaken child â youâre beaten and cold
Forsaken child â a child in the mist
Forsaken child â a child with a twist

Dear mother, dear mother, dear mother, dear mother
