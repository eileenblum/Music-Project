Machines, madness, all out gore
Whoâs the demon started your war?
Bureaucrat, fat cat, treason or thief
You rip out your soul in disbelief
Past food, no food, stomachs aflame
Manâs destruction, just a game
A sexual, homosexual, deadened disease
Your brotherâs dead, cries and pleas

The eve of the end
Itâs a chance to regret, my friend
The eve of the end

Poverty, riches, whereâs the line
Numbers up, three score nine
My killer, my lover, the scene is set
Stain unto floor, still and wet
She comes; he comes, knock at my door
Evidence, manâs decadence, upon my floor
Soulless, headless, comes a corpse
The sinners breed and the devil scores

The eve of the end
'til death do we part, my friend
The eve of the end

Genocide, suicide, call it your will
The answerâs death, just a pill
Abortion solution â a doctorâs dream
No use for hanger â midwife come clean
Condemn to repeat â to sleepless night
Godâs armies â ready to fight
Laughing to cry â turnover frown
Swipe your soul, stolen the frown

The eve of the end
'til death do we part, my friend
The eve of the end

Itâs coming
Itâs your end

''til death, 'til death do we part, my friend
