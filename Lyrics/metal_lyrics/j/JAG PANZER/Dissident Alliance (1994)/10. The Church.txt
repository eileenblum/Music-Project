Did you hear the tale
Of the headless corpse
The sinners breed
And the devil scores
Did you hear him cry?
A blood thirst game
Fore came this night
In the devils rain

A pagan holiday
Itâs the church
A pagan holiday

So you who say
A bitch gave birth
To heaven and hell
Upon this earth
When whence the rule
A chill a night
A saint â he cries
To the devilâs delight

A pagan holiday
Itâs the church
A pagan holiday

Run your children, run, run from your dreams
Run to your child 'til the childâs last scream
Run your children, run, run from your dreams
Run to your child 'til the childâs last scream

A time will tell
Of the child thatâs born
To rule the night
His head with horn
Prayer for the sacred
Prayer for the right
A pagan holiday
Is yours tonight

A pagan holiday
Itâs the church
A pagan holiday
Itâs the church
Itâs the church
Itâs the church
Itâs the church
Itâs the church
