A place not far from your inner most fear
Whisper, your innocence lost in a tear
A place not far from a dead manâs rest
Your soul for a kingdom, youâre given the test

Walk with me child, walk through your past
Your trust in me and your spirit will last
I give you life, dreams unforeseen
Exchange for your soul, spirit come clean

Take me to your castle, take me away
Show me to your victim, where you led him astray
Whisper to your god, cause you canât say no
Canât blame myself ,cause I canât say no

When they stole your life, did they to listen?
Clown denies love, calls himself Christian
Alone in the ground, alone in this earth
From your death, a sin given birth

Come to my castle, unforsaken breed
My story rings out, the liar take heed
I give you life, eternity of sin
Fuck with my children, you could never win

Take me to your castle, take me away
Show me to your victim, where you led him astray
Whisper to your god, cause you canât say no
I canât blame myself ,cause I canât say no

I canât say no
I canât say no
