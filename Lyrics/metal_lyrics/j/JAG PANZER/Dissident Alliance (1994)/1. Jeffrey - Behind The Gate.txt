Creeping Willie so evil be
You caught yourself, let young one be
A creeping shadow, what do you see
Goodbye to Jeffrey, oh blessed be

The frealy creature come from my brain
A creature feature, a homo strain
She called you evil, she crawls through your head
Now they know better to fuck with the dead

Turn to me, to tell you what I think am
I am truest night to free your pain
Can you feel the broken silence, running
Into hazy light, to see, to feel, to cry
Escaping fire, rain
Jeffrey

Crawling up the heated path to my king
Mark the beast, for you the chosen one
Can you feel the broken silence, running
Into hazy light, to see, to feel, to cry
Escaping fire, rain
Jeffrey

A one-eyed Willie, a goonies dream
A lad named Jeffrey, try sex with him
Blade through his heart, a burning star
You pull the trigger, you start your war

A crrepy Jeffrey, she is Alice the same
Start the chainsaw, slice ânâ dice is the game
Call him retarded, you call him slow
Jeffrey cut your life, Jeffrey stole your show
