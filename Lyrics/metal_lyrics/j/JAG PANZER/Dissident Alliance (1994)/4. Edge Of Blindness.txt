Killer queen
Killer queen â is that what you say
Diamonds rough â he makes his call
Ritual religion â a spirit game
Calvary blue â a genocide shame

Youâre running â over the edge
Youâre screaming â over the edge
Youâre falling â over the edge
Youâre bleeding â over the edge

Enfant king â river runs deep
Castleâs burning â a dragon sleeps
Newborns cry â to motherâs milk
Whorelike babe â soft as silk

Youâre running â over the edge
Youâre screaming â over the edge
Youâre falling â over the edge
Youâre bleeding â over the edge

Youâre running
Youâre screaming
Youâre falling
Youâre bleeding

Youâre driving me past my dreams
Listen to the night, hear their screams
You keep on pushing for a promised land
You keep the beast at bay â heâll catch you if he can

Times healing â cliche we say
Soul aware â of colourless grey
Killing clown, in cavalry blue
Look at your hands â the killer be you

Youâre running â over the edge
Youâre screaming â over the edge
Youâre falling â over the edge
Youâre bleeding â over the edge
