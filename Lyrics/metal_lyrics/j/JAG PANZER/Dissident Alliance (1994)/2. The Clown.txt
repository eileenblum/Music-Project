Follow me; follow me, where do you go
To play with Charlie, Charlie O
Follow me, follow me, you canât win
Loses bet, sin, sin
Follow me, follow me, got a special prize
Sharp as a knife, so big in size
Follow me, follow me, say sick and distraught
Ticket to Hell, sealed and bought

Take us down, take us there to see
You see, evil ones glare
A vile king, takes the crown, to see
You see, just the clown

Little boy, little boy, tell me true
Johnny does the nasty, do you know who?
Little boy, little boy, did you cry?
Mommaâs gone away, daddy tell a lie
Little boy, little boy, come to the clown
Giving it to you good, to tie you down
Little boy, little boy remember this riff
Getâs me crazy, loving a stiff

Take us down, take us there to see
You see, evil ones glare
A vile king, takes the crown, to see
You see, just the clown

He was a clown
She was a clown
We was a clown

Bring um young, just for fun, what do you say
Paradise in Hell, letâs play, play, play
Bring um young, just for fun, play me fool
Demon on his mind to rule, rule, rule
Bring um young, just for fun, twisted and sick
Pagan days, seen it in the flick
Bring um young, just for fun, say sorrow end
Clownâs delight, eve of the night

Take us down, take us there to see
You see, evil ones glare
A vile king, takes the crown, to see
You see, just the clown
Take us down, take us there to see
You see, evil ones glare
A vile king, takes the crown, to see
You see, just the clown

Heâs just a clown
Heâs just a clown
