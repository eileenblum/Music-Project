Together they stand, alone in this land
Together they wov, each man not to bow
Forever to hunt, a widow takes her mate
Forever to die, his gender, his fate

Widow bitch, ya gonna die
A devils whore, bitch tell a lie
A seasonâs witch, infidelity
Tricky little bitch, insanity

Tell us widow, howâs your lover
Communed in coven, not to ever sever
Tell us widow, take us to Hell
Woven in sin, only time will tell

Widow bitch, ya gonna die
A devils whore, bitch tell a lie
A seasonâs witch, infidelity
Tricky little bitch, insanity
Widow creature, spin your web
Darkest gift, now heâs dead
Blackest colour, pawn of beast
Take your mate, a widowâs feast

So come this hour, the witchesâs tower
Youâre dead, in her web, my blackest little flower
Tricky little whore, web your deed of death
Cursed soul forever, my last dying breath

Widow bitch, ya gonna die
Devils whore, bitch tell a lie
A seasonâs witch, infidelity
A tricky little bitch, insanity

So in this war, a widow, a whore
Your soul for her kingdom forever more
Ring of widows, unnatural in spell
Youâve take my brothers, I curse you to Hell

Widow bitch, ya gonna die
Devils whore, bitch tell a lie
A seasonâs witch, infidelity
A tricky little bitch, insanity
Widow creature, spin your web
Darkest gift, now heâs dead
Blackest colour, pawn of beast
Take your mate, a widow to feast

Catch you in her spell
Sheâs gonna get you
