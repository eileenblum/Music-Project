[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

I see and I know there's something awry 
They see and they know with laser eyes 
Digital dreams on digital screens 
creating life as they glow 
Nightmares forming without a warning, 
there's no one to patrol 

What securities will the future hold 
It's getting out of control 
I'm in future shock 

Overlapping textures of pain 
Nightmares race through information veins 
Who claims what's wrong, who controls what's right 
and who cares anyway 
The information highway will take you there 
for such a small price to pay 

Our lives are on a screen 
(Who knows what the other side sees) 
Secret lives we all lead 
(Who knows what the other side needs) 
Secure these lives with a digital lock 
(Who hold the other side's keys) 
I'm living in future shock 
(The other side has me on my knees) 

Pulses scanning at the speed of light 
Draining our life flow with every megabyte 
The beast, all seeing master minds 
Rule the Internet 
Who knows their means beyond our screens 
They will have you yet
