[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

Raised on leather, weaned on war 
A hell bent rebel overload 
The gleam of a spike, the stain of blood 
All the power contained in a raging flood 

Conjure the power down below 
Control is loss of control 
Unleashed from the cage 
Out bursting with rage 
Overflowing force of desire 
Come heed the call 
Inside of us all 
Cast all inhibitions in the fire 
It's the call of the wild 

Skin tight latex is my sin 
Crack of the whip, I love to sting 
Jump into the fire 
The whirlwind of the ring 
Survival of the fittest 
Who's the next to be crowned the king?
