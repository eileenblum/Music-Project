[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

All the years, fears and tears from the past 
Lessons for all to learn 
Clinging to life, how long will it all last? 
As long as there is fire we'll burn 

There's a hole in this world 
A hole in the soul of mankind 
The whole of this world 
Is pulling down and leaving waste behind 

Tell me, son, is the street where you call home? 
Will a weapon calm your nerves? 
Is your mother crying for a fix 
While your father lays in the curb? 

We must be brave 
And make another way 

Culminate all the forces of this life 
Hold them deep inside 
Till one day time comes for its release 
Time will change for you and I 

Fill the hole in this world 
Block the hole in the soul of mankind 
The whole of this world 
Must be strong and change for all time
