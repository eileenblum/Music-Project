[lyrics by Mark Briody and Harry Conklin]

I see the remnants of our past 
Were we there? 
I see no light, no hope, we fall 
Are we here? 
We see our aspirations fail 

I feel the winters growing cold 
No sign, no light, our lives are growing old 
I feel the winters growing cold 
No sign, no light, no hope, growing cold 

The dove of dreams is flying overhead 
Her wings are spreading softly signs of dread 
So cold inside the earthly bounds below 
Singing out her somber tales of woe 

Her sorrow covers me 
The somber tales of old 
The sorrow covers me 
Tis somber tales of woe
