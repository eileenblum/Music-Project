[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

There is a place that no one goes about 
Or fears to conjure in the mind 
Sacred chants heard whispered in the dark 
Watch for your shadow behind 

Hands of time wind in reverse 
Mirrors reflect a lie 
When you find yourself alone in the dark 
You know you've been left behind 
Down in the depths of despair 

Is it laughter or lamenting that you hear 
A host of insanity all around 
A chill of terror surrounds you standing there 
Shackles of fear have you bound 

Doors slam shut and you feel no return 
Many voices have your head spinning around 
Find yourself in the center of a circle 
Something tugging at your soul, pulling it down 

Patient pupil have you learned now any spells 
And incantations from this life 
Have you opened every door that's come to an end 
Then ventured inside
