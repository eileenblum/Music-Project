[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

Fires blazing electricity racing boiling my veins 
Strength without ending the message we're sending 
is no pain no gain 

Arm in arm and one mind together 
We're ready to strike! 

No time for forgiveness or empty tomorrow 
We live without shame 
The world is so thirsty for pleasure and torment 
They're one in the same 

Arm in arm and one mind together 
We're ready to strike! 

Now is time like none in history 
We must become brave 
Make our mark forever there to stay 
Now we pave the way 

Some things we are changing and some rearranging 
We've brought down the walls 
Forging tomorrow through history's sorrow 
We're setting new laws 

Arm in arm and one mind together 
We're ready to strike at the world 
[Repeat]
