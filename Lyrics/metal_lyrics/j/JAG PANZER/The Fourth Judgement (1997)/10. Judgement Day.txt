[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

I've walked into the light on the other side 
Beyond the door of life I've left behind 
Followed a path I did not know 
Washed by many tears 
Read the pages of my life  
Retraced the wasted years 
that scarred my soul 
Now I must go, someone calls me 
Someone is tugging at my soul 
Won't let go. Let me go! 

When the seal is opened on the book of life 
Will your name be written there? 
To be remembered and follow into the light 
Or cast down in despair 

Sign of the times and things yet to come 
The truth now revealed 
Shall condemn every son 
Some will be blessed  
Others turned away 
Who will be honored on judgement day? 

Time is now...To face your fears 
Time has come...Wash away the tears 
Time is now...For all to kneel 
Time has come...Judgement you will feel 

In my vision every head and hand 
Will retain some kind of code  
Inventory read by a laser scan 
For everything bought or sold 

Accept the way...Come get in line 
Accept the new age...Don't be left behind 
Accept the way...Do it now today 
Accept the new age...Or be cast away 

One monetary system for the world 
A do or die sort of thing 
All computations flowing through the beast 
Have we forgotten who is king? 

Show me the sign, the sign of the times 
It's time for a sign 

The press of a key is easy for me 
That's the way it should be  
What is the cost? Will I be lost? 
To the hands of the beast 

Show me the sign, the sign of the times 
It's time for a sign 
Don't be afraid The future is paved 
The mark's on it's way 

Bank by the phone you'll never leave home 
A scan is all you'll need  
Automation in every nation 
The future is ours to be
