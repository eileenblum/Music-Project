[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

Born out of flames descending upon the earth 
The master of games for what they are worth 
One with the darkness, one with my soul 
Black is all power, black is control 
It is my control 

Black is the meaning of life 
I hunger for the black of the night 

Black 
The color of greed 
The answer of hope 
The essence of light 

Black 
The heart inside you 
The soul inside me 
The power of night 
Tis the answer for life 

I hold the keys to unlock your dreams 
Pleasures beyond this world has ever seen 
I am desire. I am control 
I am the light and darkness inside your soul 
I'm inside your soul
