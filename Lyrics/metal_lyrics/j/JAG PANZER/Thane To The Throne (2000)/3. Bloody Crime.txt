[Broderick / Conklin]

[MacBeth]
In my mind's eye I raise a dagger
With means to end Duncan's life
This thought possesses even in slumber
I will commit this ghastly deed
On my servants I'll place the blame

[Lady MacBeth]
You must strike. The time is thine
They'll crown Mac Beth as next in line
This kingdom ours, now is the time
We commit this bloody crime 

[MacBeth]
The deed is finished!  What have I done? My eyes see only the stain of red

[Lady MacBeth]
Consider not so deeply. Your strength is weakness 
As pictures are the sleeping and the dead

[MacBeth]
I cannot return, they all are slain

[MacBeth]
I now bath in pools of red
This deadly deed hangs on my head
When this night is over I shall be king
[Spoken] And this will all be behind us

[Lady MacBeth]
Go wash our sins away, we'll be sane tomorrow
When blame is placed and we are cleared
Go now my king to be and do not sorrow
For you and I have kingship near

[MacBeth &amp; Lady MacBeth]
Tomorrow all will testify
MacBeth is innocent this night
