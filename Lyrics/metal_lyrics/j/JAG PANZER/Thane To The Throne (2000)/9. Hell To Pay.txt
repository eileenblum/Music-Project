[Broderick / Conklin]

[MacBeth]
MacDuff has left his house open to doom by my sinister hands
My men and I will make short work of it

Icy hand of death tight round his neck, the whole world crumbles down
A loser in life this madness will end.  Tonight.

[MacBeth]
When MacDuff's eyes grasp what I've taken from him he will cower in pain
Then I'll crush his heart as it cries in my hands

[Macduff]
MacBeth will pay for what he has done.  Malcolm, I ask your help
Ten thousand troops shall storm Dunsinane

Icy hand of death tight round his neck, the whole world crumbles down
A loser in life this madness will end.  Tonight.

Icy hand of death tight round his neck, the whole world crumbles down
A loser in life this madness will end.  Tonight.

[Macduff]
MacBeth will rue the day that he dealt with a man such as I
Dunsinane shall fall as I take his head
