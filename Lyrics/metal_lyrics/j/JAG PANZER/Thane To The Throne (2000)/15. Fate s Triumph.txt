[Briody / Conklin]

[MacBeth]
Turn,turn Hellhound, turn and face your death
Your bloodline is over. By the name of MacBeth

[MacBeth]
I command the throne, none can defy
None of woman born, None of woman born

[MacDuff]
Foolish tyrant, you have no days left
Ripped from the womb at my mother's death

[MacDuff]
I am the doom you face in your dreams

[MacBeth]
Let steel ring out.  Damn thee who cries hold.

[MacDuff]
Your head my prize now. The prophecy foretold.

[MacDuff]
The tyrant's reign is at an end, Malcolm is king
All serve his name. Our solemn king.
Fate triumphs this day!
