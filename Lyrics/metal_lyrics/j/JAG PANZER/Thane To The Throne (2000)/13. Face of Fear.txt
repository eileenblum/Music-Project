[Briody / Conklin] 

Birnham Wood is growing to meet the walls of Dunsinane
Prophecy is unfolding.  Can it be I've gone insane?

None of woman born can take my life
Now the end is here
Yet my kingdom falls here on this night
Heed the face of fear

All my plans are laid open for all eyes to know
With my lady now taken, is my throne now next to go?

None of woman born can take my life
Now the end is here
Yet my kingdom falls here on this night

None of woman born can take my life
Now the end is here
Yet my kingdom falls here on this night
Heed the face of fear

Time will tell my end is near
Now the end is here
Can no one know my face of fear
Heed the face of fear

None of woman born can end this reign
Now the end is here
Can it be I've gone insane?
Heed the face of fear
