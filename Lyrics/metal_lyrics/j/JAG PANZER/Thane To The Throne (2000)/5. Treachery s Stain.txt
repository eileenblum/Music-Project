[Broderick / Conklin]

[Banquo]
Me thinks something amiss, my friend MacBeth has done wrong
Has he committed a crime? to gain his kingdom
Is the lady part of this scheme? They both sin one in the same
I must warn all. And bring this carnage to an end

[MacBeth]
Banquo, how can thee betray me?
Banquo, now I must slay thee

[MacBeth]
My lady, our sins are out in the open
Our friend suspects that we are to blame

[MacBeth]
I will hire assassins to rid us of him
No one will know that we are to blame
Now that Banquo is gone we can enjoy our estate

[MacBeth]
Banquo, how can thee betray me?
Banquo, now I must slay thee

Reap what you sow, sow what you reap
