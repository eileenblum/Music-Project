[Broderick / Conklin]

In my mind I see the terrible deeds we've done
Convincing of the loved MacBeth to gain the crown
All I wanted was to taste of royal blood
Beholding things of kings has me drowning in a flood of treachery

All I see is red.  Staining things once pure
All I see is red.  Cannot wash the stains

All I want in life is to wear regal robes and dance upon the courts of kings for a while
Cannot erase this guilt contained within my mind.
Demands a heavy price.
I pay it with my life

All I see is red.  Staining things once pure
All I see is red.  Cannot wash the stains

I welcome death, and the final rest it brings. 
Peaceful sleep.  Peaceful sleep!

I welcome death, and the final rest it brings. 
Peaceful sleep.  Peaceful sleep!

All I see is red.  Staining things once pure
All I see is red.  Cannot wash the stains

All I see is red.  Staining things once pure
All I see is red.  Cannot wash the stains

Goodbye, MacBeth, goodnight, my sweet
The dagger's pierce brings needed peace
