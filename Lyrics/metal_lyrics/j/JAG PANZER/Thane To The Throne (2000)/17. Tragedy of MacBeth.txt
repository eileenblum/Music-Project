[Briody / Conklin]

[Three Sisters]
We three sisters, weird sisters indeed
Plant in Mac Beth the tyrant's seed
As it grows from thane to king
Deceit and murder is reaped

[MacBeth]
The sister's prophecy has won me title of thane
Yet I feel I'm so much more, my lady feels the same
I can be king with just a daggers thrust
Careful planning and this bloody deed is done
I cannot commit alone my lady must attend
Together we will wear the gowns of royalty in the end

[Duet- MacBeth &amp; Lady]
We can do all things. Hand in hand
We can live as kings. Hand in hand

[MacBeth]
This night together we commit this bloody deed
No one will suspect us in doing such a thing
We'll place the blame on the servant we shall kill.
Leave no witnesses and erase our guilt
We are so clever none shall suspect
On the marrow they will place the crown on my head

[Duet- MacBeth &amp; Lady] 
We can do all things. Hand in hand
We can live as kings. Hand in hand

[MacBeth]
We have been betrayed. Banquo; our trusted friend
Suspects our plot to be rulers of this land
Banquo you're life will be rid of this world
I shall not regret. Our innocence protect

We can do all things.  We can live as kings.
We can do all things.  We can live as kings.

[MacBeth]
I must seek the sisters to guide me in my plight
There must be more. I go this night

[Three Sisters]
We see apparitions. Three that show their face
Beware MacBeth, Beware MacBeth. 

We can do all things.  We can live as kings.
We can do all things.  We can live as kings.

[MacBeth]
Destroy Macduff on this very night
I am MacBeth, none can defy

[MacDuff]
Join me young Malcolm, rid me of this bane.
Standing together we will seize Dunsinane.

We can do all things.  We can live as kings.
We can do all things.  We can live as kings.

We can do all things.  We can live as kings.
We can do all things.  We can live as kings.

[Lady MacBeth]
I cannot rid my mind of guilt the stains of blood will not wash clean
Tonight I end this nightmare I've made and finally rest in peace

[MacBeth]
Damn my heart, my lady is gone all we've made has turned to ash
I will avenge her death on Macduff's head. No man shall take me. None of woman born!

[MacBeth]
Birnham wood is growing My world comes crashing down
None of woman born will take me.

[MacDuff]
Ripped from the womb was I.
