[Briody / Conklin]

MacBeth, MacBeth, beware MacDuff
Beware the Thane of Fife.  Enough!

[MacBeth]
Where didst thou leave?  Yet give warn
Why fear MacDuff?  I need hear more!

Ye Macbeth you're kingship will stay
Til Birnam wood shall meet Dunsinane

[MacBeth]
Live on MacDuff, why should I fear
You too must die, My guilt to clear

I am MacBeth!  I will stand strong!  And forever reign

Laugh in the face of men who come to slay thee
No one of woman born may lay hands against thee

[MacBeth spoken]
"Then I will slay MacDuff and his family anon"

I am MacBeth, none will defy, even MacDuff
I seal a bond to rid this earth the name MacDuff

[MacBeth]
Time is now to strike his family down
I hear MacDuff has left them all alone
No talk of murders and dead
Retain the crown upon my head

I am Mac Beth. All testify I will survive
I crush the words those who defy. None left alive
