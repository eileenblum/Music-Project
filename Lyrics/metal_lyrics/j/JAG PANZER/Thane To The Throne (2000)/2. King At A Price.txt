[Briody / Conklin]

'Tis now the hour to seize the throne
I've not the will to go it alone
I foresee a blade in Duncan's chest
His life's blood I do invest

The mirror knows a face no one else can know
Points to the path that I must go

The moon will bring a change tonight
Asleep no one will see my plight
A dagger's thrust will be his end this night
Then to be king I'll pay the price

The lady and I devised a plan
Duncan expires by my hand
I deserve the place where he now stands
To be the ruler of these lands

The mirror knows a face no one else can know
Points to the path that I must go

The moon will bring a change tonight
Asleep no one will see my plight
A dagger's thrust will be his end this night
Then to be king I'll pay the price

A bloody scene I commit this day
Torments my mind I must block it away
Place the blame on drunken fools
Then in my innocence I will rule

The mirror knows a face no one else can know
Points to the path that I must go

A bloody blade brings change tonight
I am innocent in my plight
Regal in stature I take what's mine
I will be king at any price
