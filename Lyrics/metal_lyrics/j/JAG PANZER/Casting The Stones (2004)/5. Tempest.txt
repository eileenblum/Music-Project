Circling churning spinning twirling in vertigo
no direction where you've been or where you'll go
its roar is deafening an angry sound that chills
inside
destruction follows in her wake no one left alive

Beware the tempest will there be an end in sight?
Beware the tempest will we survive this endless night?

Freezing winds blowing, bringing snow and ice along
leaving lives and lands covered with its deadly song
buried deep within the white is a world now past
heaven help us find the few of us that will outlast
that will outlast

In the darkened stillness of the night what do you
hear?
In the quiet stillness of the night is someone there?

Circling churning spinning twirling in vertigo
Destruction follows in her wake no one left alive
Winds crashing bending breaking everything in sight
Heaven help us just to make it through this night

Beware the tempest will there be an end in sight?
Beware the tempest will we survive this endless night?

Will we survive this endless night?
Will there be an end in sight?

Is then no one left alive?
Was there no one to survive?
