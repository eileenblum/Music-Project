Time folds into time
generations unending
starts blink out of life as new ones are reborn
worlds colliding in hatred
will there be peace in this universe?
Can the questions of life be answered without our time?

In a flash of a moment all things will change
in the blink of an eye we hardly notice how they rearrange
overflowed with emotions sometimes control
the will of us all is so strong it's hard to let it go,
feel the flow, and let it be so

that which is made in the heavens
comes from violent reaction
crashing, burning, crushing and breaking apart
glowing with fire and fury
eruptions fracture and start to burn
Leaving a brilliant planet that we see as a star

In a flash of a moment all things will change
In the blink of an eye we hardly notice how they rearrange
overflowed with emotions sometimes control
the will of us all is so strong it's hard to let it go,
feel the flow, and let it be so

Constantly under pressure
gravity pulling and straining
this cause and effects brings forth the finest gems
what can be gained by this madness that has made us
what we are this day?
the answer may lay inside man's universe within

In a flash of a moment all things will change
In the blink of an eye we hardly notice how they rearrange
overflowed with emotions sometimes control
the will of us all is so strong it's hard to let it go,
feel the flow, and let it be so

Burning on forever
starlight's flicker and glow
bringing light to us in the darkest of times
a thing of beauty and wonder
giving direction and reference of time
eternity held its glow raining on us all

In a flash of a moment all things will change
In the blink of an eye we hardly notice how they rearrange
overflowed with emotions sometimes control
the will of us all is so strong it's hard to let it go,
feel the flow, and let it be so
