By the gods of war he was made
never challenged by his prey
a demon, a warrior, a god
the keeper of his cause

The strongest of the strong
no matter the right or wrong
as far as the eye can see
he will never concede

Born into war is all that he's known
the seeds of terror are what he has sown
a maiden has never seen into his heart
and for this passion his soul will depart

The blade of Achilles is blessed by the gods
a slave to no man he fights for a cause
the strength of Achilles will render you cold
the might of Achilles shall never be sold

For the shores of Troy they set sail
when all before him failed
to avenge his cousin's life
a victim of the knife

Ten thousand fall that day
leaving as they feign to sail away
they take it, a gift behind the gates
soon will seal their fate

Achilles the brave that no man can kill
the arrow of fate across his heel
will be the fall of Achilles this day
the glory of Troy now fades away
