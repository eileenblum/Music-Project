When the world is at its end and the evil has its way
Who are the ones that will protect and keep whats gone
astray?
Steadfast and vigilant holding true to all things past
Ever pressing onward are the ones who will outlast

They will ever stand alone through the test of time
When all else has faultered and broken the bloodlines
They are the ones who will be left but never left
behind
Turn your gaze to the west and never look away
Say your prayers to the keepers of the watch every day

Vigilant and true
Will stand for you
Stay ever brave
This world you'll save

They will stand alone through the test of time
When all else has faultered and broken the bloodlines
They are the ones who will be left but never left
behind
Turn your gaze to the west and never look away
Say your prayers to the keepers of the watch every day

Vigilant and true
Will stand for you
Stay ever brave
This world you'll save

They will stand alone through the test of time
They are the ones that will be left but never left
behind

When the world is at its end and the evil has its way
Who are the ones that will protect and keep whats gone
astray?
Steadfast and vigilant holding true to all things past
Ever pressing onward are the ones who will outlast

They will ever stand alone through the test of time
When all else has faultered and broken the bloodlines
They are the ones who will be left but never left
behind
Turn your gaze to the west and never look away
Say your prayers to the keepers of the watch every day

Vigilant and true
Will stand for you
Stay ever brave
This world you'll save
