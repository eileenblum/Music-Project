Through the canopy of this darkened world
I see my prey
never seeing with my eye
Senses are raging from this troubled world
I fell his heart
feeling only with my mind

I am the light in the darkened place
I stand alone
Stangind ever strong and powerful
I stand alone
Vigilant

A demon of the night
one who never can be seen
a protector of the innoccent
never knowing love
there's no place for it in this heart
I am eternally alone

time will stop and the worlds will end
The vigilant stand ever strong
