Sean into view
a violent storm twisting and turning
cold blood runs through every inch of your being
crawling inside of you

Hide away from danger
Hide away from yourselves
stay away from danger
Keep away from evil things

Prophecy warned of covering dark and impending doom
Raising the tide with gravity's force pushing and
pulling apart

Where is this world?
Where are the cities drowned by oceans?
Where is this world?
Without man's legacy how will we carry on?
