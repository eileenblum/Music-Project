On the edge of a dream that's where you'll find me
The edge of a dream all seems so real

At the edge of the world is where you'll find yourself
naked and alone as the day of your birth
final page has turned reality no more
the nightmare has begun this book will soon close

At the precipice edge we stand alone
hanging on by a thread we stand alone
nowhere else to be led we stand alone
on the very edge alone and empty

Reach for the edge hold on with all your might
regain control lost for so long
take a hold of yourself too far gone to be saved
is there nowhere else you can run?

The game is over you've lost
Left alone to count the cost
Leaning over you see the edge
falling down

On the edge of a dream thats where you'll find me
the edge of a dream all seems so real

Darkness has come it covers you
Hang on to the edge with all your might
Pull yourself up again before your hold is lost
never too late to recover your dreams

On the edge of a dream is where you'll find me
The edge of a dream all seems so real

At the edge of the world is where you'll find yourself

Naked and alone as the day of your birth
Final page has turned, reality is no more
the nightmare has begun and this book will soon close

At the precipice edge we stand alone
hanging on by a thread we stand alone
nowhere else to be led we stand alone
on the very edge alone and empty
