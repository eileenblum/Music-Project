The mission set there will be no returns as the
killers head into the night
they all must face the impossible climb a sheer cliff
400 feet high

Caught captive in Mondracus it seams the enemy knows
their plan
Back in control and on to Navarone they leave behind a
misinformed man

Six men with six days to change the tide
The guns of Navarone
Six men with six days it may take their lives
The guns of Navarone

Mondracus burns in punishment for hiding out the
killers five
On this night the silent one is a traitor ans so she
dies

The injured man drugged by Stolamine speaks of
invasion on the southern side
The guns now left alone two men move inside and lock
the massive door behind

Planting explosives all around the guns a diversion
from the real mother load
the containment room holding hundreds of shell the
elevator and they explode
