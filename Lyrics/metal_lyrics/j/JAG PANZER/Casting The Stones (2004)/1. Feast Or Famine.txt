When the seas rise and skies fall
marsh lands turn to dust and blow away
when the air is parched every breath poison
eternal darkness covers all below

We thirst for days gone past
we hunger for life
we crave

Cover me with this earth
we can be one again
cover me let me rest
we will be one again

Richly feeding on the pleasures
that this world has given to all
never ending resources
one day will end and so will we

We thirst for days gone past
We hunger for life
We crave

Cover me with this earth
we can be one again
cover me let me rest
we will be one again

When the seas rise and skies fall
marsh lands turn to dust and blow away
when the air is parched every breath poison
eternal darkness covers all below

Protect her and her beauty
lush lands we covet
feast upon her awesome bounty
before we drain these riches dry
