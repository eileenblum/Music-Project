Corruption and disease have swallowed this world left
us all to blame
Lust and its hateful consuming of dreams plays an evil
game

From the day we tasted the fruit the falling of
mankind
Evil has begotten its way has left all else behind

this knowledge makes us blind
Morality divine

We have become battered and bruised
We are all fallen battered and bruised

Eve the setting of the sun
leave nowhere to run
time ticking in haste
gone what a waste

Stillness of the night now loud and absurd corrupting
every thought
leaders of this world consumed in debate what lessons
can be taught
