When she came to me
She didnât have no love
She was waiting for me
She wants my blood
She wears the dark clothes
And the painted face
And with tight leather boots
And black lace

Sheâs from the Tower of Darkness
She looked in my eye she gave me a shove
The end is coming nearer
And it is bringing love
The tower rose three miles in the sky
I knew it time for her to die
Sheâs from the Tower of Darkness
Tower, tower

It rose from hell
To spread its bloody wrath
Beneath its veins
Itâs killing them fast
The tower of life and the tower will steal
Satanâs last stand, the world will feel
Sheâs from the Tower of Darkness
Darkness, tower of darkness
Tower, tower
