Yea, I'm out to get you
Get inside your brain
Gonna unleash my lust
Try to drive you insane
Can you feel my power?
Pulsing in your head
I'm a vicious tiger
Roaming across the land

You know it's over
When the Metal Melts the Ice
You know it's over
When the Metal Melts the Ice

It's coming down
Like a hammer of steel
It's gonna cross the ice
Of the frozen heart I feel
I'm gonna use my stare
To conjure up the flames
My main desire
Has lost control again

You know it's over
When the Metal Melts the Ice
You know it's over
When the Metal Melts the Ice

You know it's over
When the Metal Melts the Ice
You know it's over
When the Metal Melts the Ice

Can you feel me writhing
In pleasure and desire?
I'm boiling over
I'm breathing fire
So don't mess around with the tiger
Cos I'll bite
I love the scent of blood
On a sharpened spike

You know it's over
When the Metal Melts the Ice
You know it's over
When the Metal Melts the Ice

You know it's over
When the Metal Melts the Ice
You know it's over
When the Metal Melts the Ice
