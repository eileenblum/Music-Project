In the darkened days of old
The law was the sword

Yes, it was long ago
There was a strong man
Who lived by the sword
He was being chased
By a strong and mighty hoard
Lying in the bushes
To hide from the rest
He suddenly hears the cries
Of a maiden in distress

And you see flashing blades of steel
Tear the flesh from the bone
Cries of quarter is his last dying breath
With one eye on the boat
And the other on the woman
He hastily flees from the rest

Rowing day and night
Not stopping in his way
Though tales of woe were spoken by the girl
He gently falls asleep
Then awakes on the shore
The story at last unfurls

Not knowing where they rested
They awakened in a temple
Of the shadows of that she fears
Sleep ensnares the both of them
And just like a dream
A demon in black appears

Running like the wind
She startles the man
Screaming cries of help
You say it's not a dream
These demons are real
You need to get a hold of yourself

Iron Shadows
Five demons in black
Iron Shadows
The moonlight prepares the attack

Not knowing where they rested
They awakened in a temple
Of the shadows seen in trees
An ape, standing upright
With hunger in his eyes
It's death will come quickly with ease

Slaying the beast
A few inches from fate
He hears many a crewmen die
Running to the ship
He captures the rest
They set sail for the Eastern sky

Iron Shadows
Five demons in black
Iron Shadows
The moonlight prepares the attack

'Crucify the kings and
Defile the queens
Burn the cities in fire
Slay the enemies
See them driven before me
This is my only desire'
