[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

If you wanna find some action then this is the place to be
If you want hell you've got it, just ask and you shall receive
Move aside and let me by, I'm a man who knows what he wants
Ain't nothing gonna get in my way, it's time you paid the cost

Gonna break ya, shake ya, slide you on your back
Use all my metal power to give you a heart attack

Look into my eyes and you will see yourself inside
I've got something for you and it's just too good to hide

Got malice on my mind tonight, pulsing power in my veins
Heavy metal mayhem soaking in my brains
Feel the sound around you start to melt your metal heads
Talking no mercy, baby, we're gonna leave ya dead
