[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

With the curse of death he stands
In the darkness cold and black
Looking over the lands preparing his attack
Hunger nagging at his belt
Spreading his wings far and wide
To sail across the countryside
The impaler is known to everyone around
He'll sneak into your room at night
And feast without a sound

He's a mysterious figure in black
Roaming the city bringing death
Pestilence from rats invaders by the score
Plaguing the people with disease
Running scared nowhere to go and nowhere to hide
Running through the woods and over the countryside 
Must escape this nightmare, put an end to this dream
Let us come together, put an end to all his schemes. 

Nosferatu is his name and he's spreading his curse
'Cross the land, feel his eyes take your soul
Heed my words, run if you can [Repeat] 

Taste of blood upon his teeth the beast is ready for to fly
Soaring to his victory, she is virgin fare, I can taste her in my mouth
Now he's in her parlor bending for a feast
Looking up in wonder she seduced the evil beast
"Oh, stay all night with me and you can have your way"
Morning brings the sunlight and his ashes blow away
