[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

See the lights flashing bright above
Electrify the night
Sweat dripping lords of the metal kind
Blow you out of sight
Never listen to a word we say
You're always breaking the rules
Eyes are open when you pray
Mocking the blinded fools, you fool

You put their heads on the grinding wheel
Give 'em hell 'cause you're harder than steel
Oh, you're harder than steel, yeah, ya feel
All for yourself and no one else

You try to look 'em straight in the eye
A piercing glare of truth
Holding their minds in a metal grip
All power is in your youth
Using age as a weapon they try to bring you down
A violent social circle but they can't steal your crown

You've had it up to here, ya know
With all their lies
No chains are gonna hold you down
You're breaking all the ties tonight
It's your life, you're gonna live it
Can't tell ya what to do
In one ear and out the other
That's what they see in you
