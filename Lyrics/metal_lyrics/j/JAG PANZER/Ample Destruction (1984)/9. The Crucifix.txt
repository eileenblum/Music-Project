[lyrics by Harry Conklin]

When your love exists no more it's time to find another door
Rekindling flames that have gone dim, let feelings spread on a whim
Look toward the light and fix your eyes, let the white dove fly
When your love exists no more it's time to find another door

Hearts are dry it's time they burn
The wheel of life has stopped its turn
Pound the flesh unto the tree
Bound and hung before me
Cast your lots unto him now
Search your hearts before the bow
Life's too short, why throw away
Save the best for the final day

Bleed into the world of sin
The blood will flow to the hearts within
Agonizing pain and death
Well, it's burning everything that's left
Kneel before the one so true
He's the king of all and even you
Darkness ruling everyone
Praising another as the one true son

Burn his number into the flesh
666 the final test
See the mark sweep the land
On the forehead, on the hand
Hang the one that we all know
Crucify the inner soul
Sell your soul unto the maker
The Crucifix
