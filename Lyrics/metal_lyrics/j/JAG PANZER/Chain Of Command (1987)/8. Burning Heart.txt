Cries in the night
Shadows move through familiar doorways
History replays
Leading, repeating mistakes we made

Vice in your eyes
Burning black with lost compassion
Cast me away
Desire is gone when all the passion is lost

Burning heart
Bleeding on now forever
Torn apart
Leading on now forever

I hear your voice
Echoes emptying on forever
Silence steals the night
Calling me back miles away
