They run to the plains as their heads hang in silence
Losing their faith as their lives fade away
Dreams of their lifetime
Honor dissolves as the night's cold, growing still

Never Surrender, Never Surrender
Wait and you lose all your hope.
Surrender

Lord of the night will arrive and strike at your soul
Till they take you down.

Turn back to battle as screams turn into nightmares
Masked by the night advance take them down
Dreams of their lifetime
Honor dissolves as the nights cold , growing still
Surrender

They run to the plains as their heads hang in silence
Losing their faith as their lives fade away
