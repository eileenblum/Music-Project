Figures fly across a moonlit bay
Without a sound a figure slips away

Terror strikes a child inside my soul
Shadow Thief will soon play a role

Silent assassin clothed in black
Who will play the pawn in his next attack

Many men have lost their lives
at the hands of Shadow Thief
A master of an ancient skill handed down by priests
Trained in every weapon
known to man and known to beast
Shadow Thief becomes the night
The night becomes Shadow Thief

Silent assassin clothed in black,
I can see his next attack
A dozen men have all gathered round
One by one they hit the ground
Shadow Thief cannot be found

Many men have lost their lives
at the hands of Shadow Thief
A master of an ancient skill handed down by priests
Trained in every weapon
known to man and known to beast
Shadow Thief becomes the night
The night becomes Shadow Thief
