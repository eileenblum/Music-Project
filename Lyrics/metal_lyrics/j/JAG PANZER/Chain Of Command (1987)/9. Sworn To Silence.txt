Rise to the order of a supreme society
Strike down rebellion control identity

SWORN TO SILENCE
Enslaved by the memories lost to them
SWORN TO SILENCE
Communication is lost again

Live by our reasons of altruistic style
Four walls impose virtue knowing all the while
That you pledge your allegiance to the united cause for all
Blind faith in the system leads you to a wall

Rise to the order of a supreme identity
Strike down rebellion control society
Advocate we retaliate
We walk against the cause
Dictate (NO) we evaluate
Break down all the laws
