[Written by Broderick &amp; Conklin]

I feel for you, to stalk the night in which you live
I feel your pain an emptiness I've known for ages

Centuries rolling on and on, carry me, to lovers unaware
Centuries rolling on and on, carry me, to different feeding grounds

Show me your world, show me the horror of it all
Teach me to feed upon the weak, crawling in filth

Bathe me in blood cover me with ancient earth
I beg to be reborn another child of the chosen

I stalk the night the silent voices of the ages
Thirsting for life return the soul I left behind
