[Written by Broderick &amp; Conklin]

Feel so alone, lost inside, burning my heart on frozen love
Cautiously I beg for a glance, a sign I'm alive within your eyes

Moonlight glows upon her skin only to touch would be a sin
Lips red as wine, to taste is to die, I beg for this sweet death tonight

She'll never know the man inside when I am gone will she realize
She'll never know the man inside just take a look, he's hidden in my eyes

Trapped inside a world of broken dreams
Trapped inside a world of shattered hopes
Release the fears you would keep
We can soar far beyond the sun

Two lives apart, together as one
what of the vows we made that night
Return the days when love was new
I never forgot, though far and few

So much to give so much inside, take a good look and realize
Give me your pain, give me your trust, unlock the man waiting inside
