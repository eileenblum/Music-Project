[Written by Broderick &amp; Conklin]

Hearts racing, blood boils Fist raising overlords
Corruption our cry We're metal till we die

Power - In our hearts
Surging - In our veins
Power - There's no stopping this force

Full throttle we soar Fist raising overlords
All hells in our eyes We're metal till we die

Up from the depths dark children arise
Only to claim this earth as their prize
Ancient ones have spoken so
The dark ones arises from below

A birthright to the beastly one
This earth and all its fallen sons
Dark children await the timely hour
In which to claim this earth with fire
And then devour

Hells fire red glow Fist raising overlords
We're burning with might We're metal till we die

Up from the depths dark children arise
Only to claim this earth as their prize
Dark children await the timely hour
In which to claim this earth with fire
And then devour
