[Written by Broderick &amp; Conklin]

Orders and runway cleared, given the green to go
Instruments glowing amber red
Light up the turbine engines, they scream and start their burn
G-forces push my heart deep into my chest

Take to the sky, Ten miles high
Stealthily we fly, Take to the sky

Upon reaching altitude earth seems so small below
Silent, invisible black death from above

Laser guided, automated, precise computer control
The enemy blind and unprotected
Pinpoint accuracy certain death sent down below
No mercy, no regret for the unknowing foe

Mission completed heading for home
Objective neutralized
One more kill, one more scar for her side
