[Written by Briody &amp; Conklin]

Another nightmare, she prays her soul to keep
Cold hand that touches her as she pretends to sleep

Take this away
Let it end

Blood turns to ice when he's near
No one believes as she lays awake
Each night frozen in fear

Courage escapes her as she tries to scream
Can this be happening to daddy's little queen?

When she gets older She'll make him pay
She'll cut him down then put him away

One speaks of love, another screams
Will she awake from this suffocating dream?
