Did you ever feel you're headed for a change?
Cuz' you wanna know how to breathe again

Sewing patches on your heart
Never knew it'd be so hard

Do you want to learn how to dream once more?
Did you ever think you'd find that open door?

When tiny pieces of your soul
Break apart and lose control
Sometimes it feels like...

I'm slipping away, I'm slipping away
So long I've had to hold on
I'm slipping away

Have you tried to see the light behind your eyes?
And the mirror pane reflecting only lies

Puzzled pieces of your heart
Losing faith and torn apart
Sometimes I feel like...

I'm slipping away, I'm slipping away
So long I've had to hold on
I'm slipping away..
