All the reasons seems to go through my mind
Why you do the things you do
After all that we've been through-this can't end
Bless the demon keep my false hope alive

So won't you...
Tell me one more lie
Slowly let the soul in me die

All the madness wants to go to my head
But I won't let you leave me this way, oh no
Can't we make it last just a little bit longer?
Who knows, maybe one more lie
Just might make us stronger

So won't you...
Tell me one more lie
I like it when ya...
Slowly let the soul in me die
In need ya to...
Tell me one more lie..
