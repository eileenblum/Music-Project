Devil's in my brain
Everything's the same
Distant rising sun
Destiny be done

All this waiting is playing on my mind
Commiserating...
The end I'll never find

I've lost ray faith, I've lost my faith

Why must a man fade away?
Gone, yes I am, to fade away

Is there having?
There is no guarantee
Overstating...
The place I'll never see

I've lost my faith, I've lost my faith

Why must a man fade away?
Gone, yes I am, to fade away

Devil's in my brain
Everything's the same
Distant rising sun
Destiny be done
