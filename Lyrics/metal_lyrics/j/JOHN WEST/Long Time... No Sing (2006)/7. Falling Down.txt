I've been waitin', wait in' for so long
Re-creating the things that I've done wrong
And ever time I see her, every single day
I'm tryin' to find the reasons
We went our separate ways

All this lime I've been falling
Wasted time

Falling down, falling down again
Falling down, I've been falling down again

I've been searchin', searchin' half my life
Always knowing the strongest will survive
And everything around me, everything I see
I never even realized the strongest one was me

All this time I've been falling
Precious time

Falling down, falling down again
Falling down, I've been falling down again

Every single day
Every move I make
I'm falling down. I'm falling down..
