You always think about the things I said
But never notice why I
Can't reach the words
You're sending over my head
I shouldn't even try

But all of these feeling till my mind
So why are my legs so hard to find?

You're over my head
Keep reaching
But the lines have all gone dead
Over my head
Keep reaching
But the lines haw all gone...

I can't slop thinkin' 'bout the mess I've made
It's made a mess of me too
Over knee deep, into this farce we wade
I'll drown before you do

But all of these feelings fill my soul
So why am I down here in this hole?

You're over my head
Keep reaching
But the lines have all gone dead
Over my head
Keep reaching
But the lines have all gone dead..
