There in front of me, right before my eyes
Show their face, then disappear
And every photograph frames my great mistake
Now a broken man with nothin' left to break

Can't afford the cost

Every single, baited breath I take
Reminds me of the one that got away
The one that got away

In the magazine wear the painted smile
Faces staring all the while
And I turn the page, but never turn away
Now a silent man with nothin' left to say

In a sense, I'm lost

Every single, baited breath I take
Reminds me of the one that got away
The one that got away

I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna make the same mistakes
I don't wanna dream, I don't wanna learn
I don't wanna make the same mistakes I made
She got away..
