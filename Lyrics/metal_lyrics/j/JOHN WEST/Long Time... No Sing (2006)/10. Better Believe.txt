So silent, now I watch you... you're sleeping
Inside your heart is beating'
Like raindrops I'm failing
I hear your voice, it's calling

I will remember
This love could last longer

I believe in what we are
I believe we can touch the stars
And I will love von better
Treat you better, I will
You better believe

You know that I've been waiting... so lonely
To show you you're the only
Temptations like fire
And as the flames burn higher

I will remember
This low could last forever

I believe in what we are
I believe we can touch the stars
And I will love you better
Treat you better, I will
You better believe

I will remember
This love could last forever..
