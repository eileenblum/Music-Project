I was born to be the restless kind
No patience for wastin' time
Start thisikin' 'bout the wars we wage
No use... Jest turn the page
Silent tear, endless fear

Don't wanna lose the way we are
So I've been waitin' for...

A sign from heaven above me
A sign that comes from the stars
A white light to shine down upon me
I've waited .so long
... Give me a sign

I've been caught inside a mystery
Black magic never got to me
Always payin' for eternal sin
Been around and back again

Don't wanna lose, the way we are
So I've been waitin' for...

A sign from heaven above me
A sign that comes from the stars
A white Sight to shine down upon me
I've waited - Oh Lord
... Give me a sign..
