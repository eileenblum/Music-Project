In my mind taint glow of the city lights
Neon jungle, made of cold concrete
Lead us both into temptation, oh
Behold the den of iniquity

Nightwind, deliver me
Lonely road, never set me free

In my way I'll keep on moving on
On the highway to Roppongi
Well, it's my way to keep on travelin' on
On the highway to Roppongi

Darkest hearts beat strong in the city, babe
Empty promises-broken soul

Niglwind, deliver me
Lonely road, never gonna set me free

In my way I'll keep on moving on
On the highway to Roppongi
Well, it's my way to keep on travelin' on
On the highway to Roppongi

Cuz' every lime I've tried to run away
Something's always beggin' me 10 slay
It's callin' from the darkness
Every time I've tried to get away
Well, Somethin' here is beggin' me to stay
Arms are reachin' to hold me...

Nightwind, deliver me
Lonely road, never set me free

In my way I'll keep on moving on
On the highway to Roppongi
Well, it's my way to keep on travelin' on
On the highway to Roppongi

Well, it's my way-keep on keepin' on
It's ma way-keep on movin' on, movin' on
My way to keep on movin' on
On the highway to Roppongi..
