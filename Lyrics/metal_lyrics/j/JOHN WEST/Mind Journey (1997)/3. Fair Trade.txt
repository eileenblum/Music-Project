Can we take your gold and silver?
Would you trade this island for beads?
How 'bout your women for horses?
Sounds like a fair trade to me
Sounds like a fair trade to me

Familiar story from around the world
It's just good business, friend
You'll never know the price of peace
Until we reach the end

Beautiful forest, clear mountain stream
I think I'll name it after me
But who are these people inhabiting for free
My "new" discovery

So many people, broken native heart
Driven from your land
But it's just progress
So we pick your pocket
While we shake your hand

Bountiful farmland, white sandy beach
I think I'll name it after me
Who are these people inhabiting for free
My "new" discovery
