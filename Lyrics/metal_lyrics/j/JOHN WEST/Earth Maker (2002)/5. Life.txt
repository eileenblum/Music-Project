Light - burn my tender eyes
Sound - let my ears be open now

Seems like ages since those loggers took my life
Now reborn, I feel my soul is dreaming

Life, looking through the eyes of a newborn child
Life, looking through the eyes of a newborn child

Spirits - dancing all around my grave
Memory - feeling like there's nothing there

And all the strangers faces that do now surround me
Feelings so confused within my mind

Naked, lost and cold, they put their arms around me
I feel compassion now for all mankind

Seems like ages since those loggers took my life
Now reborn, I feel my soul is screaming

Life, looking through the eyes of a newborn child
Life, looking through the eyes of a newborn child

Life, looking through the eyes of a newborn child
Life, looking through the eyes of a newborn child
Life, looking through the eyes of a newborn child
Life, looking through the eyes of a newborn child

And all the strangers faces that do now surround me
Feelings so confused within my mind

Naked, lost and cold, they put their arms around me
I feel compassion now for all mankind

Life
I got to get out, I got to get out
I got to get out, I got to get out
I got to get out, I got to get out
I got to get out, I got to get out
