Around Father Sun, the world it must turn
Come too close and the oceans will burn
The creator of all mankind
Looking down on pollution and crime

Will we fall on judgment day?
Is it too late to change our ways?

Feel his stare, look in his eyes
Are you only a taker?
Search your heart, use a good mind
All praise Earth Maker

The wind in the trees whispers your name
Does your head and your heart think the same?
The creator's calling to you
Do you know what your powers do?

Will you run on judgment day?
Is it too late to change our ways?

Feel his stare, look in his eyes
Are you only a taker?
Search your heart, use a good mind
All praise...

He will watch over me, and I shall not fall

Feel his stare, look in his eyes
Are you only a taker?
Search your heart, use a good mind
Earth Maker
Feel his stare, look in his eyes
Are you only a taker?
Search your heart, use a good mind
All praise Earth Maker
