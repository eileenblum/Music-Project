Anoint my body, say the words and lay me in my grave
Death was creeping for so long, there's nothing they could save

Returned to the Earth
The place of my birth

Wrap me in my funeral shroud, put coins upon my eyes
Burning sage will let your prayers ride smoke into the skies

Returned to the womb
Once vibrant, no entombed

The Dark Sleep of the Dead will press you down
The Dark Sleep of the Dead will pressure you down

Bury my body, reform my soul

Anoint my body, say the words and lay me in my grave
Death was creeping for so long, there's nothing they could save

Returned to the womb
Once vibrant, no entombed

The Dark Sleep of the Dead will press you down
The Dark Sleep of the Dead will pressure you down
The Dark Sleep of the Dead will press you down
The Dark Sleep of the Dead will pressure you down
