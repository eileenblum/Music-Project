Smoky mist of dawn, rising slowly from Earth, so warm
Blood on leaves, glistens like so many jewels

Death is here...
One man's victory is another's defeat
Yet the spirit lives on and on
Cheating fate once more
To rise up again

Warrior Spirit

Do eyes of the night truly see all?
Or are lights and shades illusion?
Moonlight on steel, glistening like a shining star
Reality or madness? Living in fear

Death is near...
One man's victory is another's defeat
Yet the spirit lives on and on
Cheating fate once more
To rise up again, again

Warrior Spirit, the shadow of the night
Warrior Spirit, born of darkness, not the light
Warrior Spirit is a creature of the night
Warrior Spirit lives on, Warrior Spirit lives on
On and on, on and on, on and on

When the spirit cries out, does anyone hear?
Feel the mountain tremble and the ocean rise
When the wolf cries out, do you shed a tear?
As the mountain crumbles right before your eyes

Your death is here
One man's victory is another's defeat
Yet the spirit lives on and on
Cheating fate once more
To rise up again, again, again

Warrior Spirit, the shadow of the night
Warrior Spirit, born of darkness, not the light
Warrior Spirit is a creature of the night
Warrior Spirit lives on, Warrior Spirit lives on
On and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on
