Crossed over to the spirit world
Was like walking through fire
Familiar faces all around me
Waiting to see me

We talk, but no one speaks
Shrouded in eerie, white bliss
This is what I have seen

When worlds collide - sound like thunder
When worlds collide - ocean of rain
When worlds collide

Walked amongst ghosts and men
I prefer the dark side
Specter, haunt me no longer
I am you now

We touch, but no one feels
Covered in Holy light
This is how it is

When worlds collide - sound like thunder
When worlds collide - ocean of rain
When worlds collide - sound like thunder
When worlds collide - ocean of rain

We talk, but no one speaks
Shrouded in eerie, white bliss
This is what I have seen

When worlds collide - sound like thunder
When worlds collide - ocean of rain
When worlds collide - sound like thunder
When worlds collide - ocean of rain

Ocean of rain

Worlds collide
