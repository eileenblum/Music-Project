All these lies... don't think I can last another day
So much pain...like a needle pushing air into my veins

Darkness come my way
Take me from this place
Thoughts within my mind
Now they've started, slowly but surely, to unwind

Love is Pain, bound to fade away
Try in vain, to fly to yesterday

Live in fear...
To face another lonely night alone
Why am I...
Surrounded by a house, but not a home

Darkness come my way
Take me from this place
Thoughts within my mind
Now they've started, slowly but so surely, to unwind

Love is Pain, bound to fade away
Try in vain, to fly to yesterday
Would you rewind? Could you be kind?
Shouldn't you be mine? Can't you be?

So called love...
All you ever brought to me is pain
Back to Hell
I swear you put me through it once again

Love is Pain, bound to fade away
Try in vain, to fly to yesterday
Love is Pain, bound to fade away
Try in vain, to fly to yesterday
