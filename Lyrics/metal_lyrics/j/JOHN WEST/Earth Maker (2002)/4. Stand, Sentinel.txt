For two hundred years I have watched the view from this exact spot
Once surrounded by my brothers, now I stand alone
One by one they have fallen, first to the fire, then by axe and saw
Machines have sped my loneliness... so much progress?

When you receive the mark of man, you know
You haven't long in this world, oh

Stand, sentinel, stand
Seen the progress of man, progress of time
For two hundred years, vision, my tears
Oh stand, sentinel, stand
Now I have the mark

Tired limbs stretched out towards the Sun
Will tomorrow's dawn be my last?
I can barely breathe
I can not feel extremities
Father Sun is but a glimpse
Or just a memory?

When you receive the mark of man, you know
You haven't long in this world, oh

Stand, sentinel, stand
Seen the progress of man, progress of time
For two hundred years, vision, my tears
Oh stand, sentinel, stand
Seen the changes of man, changes of mind
All of these years, my people, my kind, we will stand, stand

I have cradled babies in my arms, given shelter from the storm
Now I must rest eternal rest, join my brothers in the Earth
Now my life is but a flicker in the flame of life itself
Was it all for nothing? All for nothing?
Soon, I will... I will have my answer

Stand, sentinel, stand
Seen the progress of man, progress of time
For two hundred years, vision, my tears
Stand, sentinel, stand

We will stand, oh stand

Now I have the mark!

Never fall!
Never fall!
Never fall!
Never fall!
