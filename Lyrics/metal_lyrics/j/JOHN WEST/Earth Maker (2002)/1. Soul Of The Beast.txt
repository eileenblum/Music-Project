Cautious footsteps, watchful eyes
Life depends on caution
Every nerve aware, my Brother Bear

Hunter is hunted and so it goes
From my stand I've watched you
Mind to mind, one step behind

Step behind, it's always the same
You never can win if you don't play the game

Ancient forest, sun in the east
Colors of autumn, Soul of the Beast
Ancient spirit, provide the feast
Blood on my arrow is the Soul of the Beast
Soul of the Beast

I know these woods, each and every inch
Still, not as well as you, my friend
My worthy rival, you fight for survival

I have waited so many days
My inner thoughts for comfort
Won't give up now, I don't know how

I don't know how, it's always the same
I never can win if I don't play the game

Ancient forest, sun in the east
Colors of autumn, Soul of the Beast
Ancient spirit, provide the feast
Blood on my arrow is the Soul of the Beast

Ancient forest, sun in the east
Colors of autumn, Soul of the Beast
Ancient spirit, provide the feast
Blood on my arrow is the Soul of the Beast
Ancient forest, sun in the east
Colors of autumn, Soul of the Beast
Ancient spirit
Ancient forest
Ancient spirit
Soul of the Beast
