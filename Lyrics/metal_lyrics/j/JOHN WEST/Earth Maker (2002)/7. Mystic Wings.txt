You're moving closer, closer to my heart
If only in my dreams
We've been riding on, forever in the dark
Touched, but never seen

Dream lover, move closer
Mind vision, come real
Come closer to me
On Mystic Wings

Someone like you could love only me
Learning to fly - life's mystery
Someone like you could only love me
Passion can fly, passion can fly
On Mystic Wings

Lost forever, if only in my dreams
I never thought I'd find you
I've been holding on, so deep within my heart
Touched, but never feel

My phantom lover, so close now
Mind vision, come real
Come closer to me
On Mystic Wings

Someone like you could love only me
Learning to fly - life's mystery
Someone like you could only love me
Learning to fly - life's mystery
Passion can fly, passion can fly
On Mystic Wings

I've been holding on, if only in my dreams
Come closer to me

Someone like you could love only me
Learning to fly - life's mystery
Someone like you could love only me
Learning to fly - life's mystery
On Mystic Wings
On Mystic Wings
