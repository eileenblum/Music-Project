Stuck in pain and I canât change it
Growing tired of living life this way

My skin is cold , my mind is failing me
I think my bodyâs failing
I just want all of this hurt to go away

Dig a hole and throw me away
Cause when Iâm gone you wonât even know my name

Migraines start to make me lose myself
