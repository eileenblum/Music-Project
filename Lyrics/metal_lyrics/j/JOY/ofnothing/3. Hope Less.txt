Life fades into a haze of grey
I can't go on another day
Forgetting what I'm doing here
No path, no guide, it's all unclear

Hope less

I don't see where I'm going
I only know where I'm coming from

Days fade into weeks fade into years
All put in place like pointless gears
Repeating cycles endlessly
Waiting for something to set me free

Run away, run away
Run away from everything
Run away from everything

No damn direction, maybe I should just

Hope less

I don't know where I'm going
I only know where I've been
I'm numb to the whole world and
I'm even numb to my self
