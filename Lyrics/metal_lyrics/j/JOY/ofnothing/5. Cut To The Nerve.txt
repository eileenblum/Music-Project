Fighting every single day
Growing hate. Pushing you away
Push the blade into my skin
Feel the pain. Letting anger in

Irritation fills my head
Saying what is blindly said
I can barely stand the sound
You cut me down

Cut me down right to the nerve
You cut me down right to the nerve
You Cut me down right to the
Cut me down right to the
Cut me down right to the nerve
You cut me down right to the damn nerve.

You cut me to the nerve
You cut me down to the nerve.

Fighting every single day
Growing hate. Push you away
Push the blade into my skin
Feel the pain. Let anger in

Cut me down right to nerve
