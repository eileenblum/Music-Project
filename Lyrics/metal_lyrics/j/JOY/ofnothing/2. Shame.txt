Sleeping my whole life away
Constant comfort in decay
Failing, Crying
Donât know why Iâm even trying
Failing, Crying
Donât know why Iâm even trying

I know my shame
It has a face
With dead and cold eyes
It sees into my mind
It knows my every thought

Chain me down
Hate this life
Digging down to try to find the light

Waking up, such a drag
Bury me here.
