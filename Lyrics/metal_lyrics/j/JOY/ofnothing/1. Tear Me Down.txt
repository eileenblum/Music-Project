Why canât I move past this.
It wonât go away
Fighting what seems endless
Extending to my grave

Leave me in peace
It might break my all seams

Crushing my soul

It just wonât go away
I try to be the bigger man
but the hate still towers over me
I try to be the bigger man
but the hate l still towers over me

I canât fight it, but I never said I liked it
Build me up, to tear me down
Iâll save your spot when Iâm in the ground

Build me up to tear me down

What doesn't kill me doesn't make me stronger. It only makes this misery longer.

Tear me down, down into the ground.
