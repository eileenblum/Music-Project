Anger has a hold on me. Burning everything.

Blinded by rage, hand to the flame.
This demon inside me, he just can't be tamed.
Bottle it up, buried inside.
Afraid of myself, am I Jackal or Hyde?

Blood is boiling (burning myself)
Tensions rising (losing control)

Anger has a hold on me. Burn.

Anger has a hold on me, burning everyone I see.

Burning inside. The red in my eyes.
Both of my sides just wanting to die.
Expose to the light, the darkness I fight
Problems with anger. Exposing both sides.

Blood is boiling (burning myself)
Tensions rising (losing control)

I think I'm about to snap, now everybody will know.

The anger inside, it's starting to rise.
Exposing both sides. My switchblade teeth.
