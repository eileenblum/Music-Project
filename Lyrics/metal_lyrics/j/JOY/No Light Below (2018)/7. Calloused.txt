Total complacence.
Rejecting the obvious truth.
Calloused and bitter.
Separate, so what can I do?

Nothing can mend it.
Twisted and in disrepair.
Violence, deception, rejection.

When will it end?
A tolerated hate.

Nobody else relates to me.
Contorted thoughts in my head.
Imbalanced chemicals with no end.

Told to accept it.
Tolerate it.
Tolerate it.
