Going through these thoughtless motions.
I move along the edge.
Waiting for the slightest friction.
Pushing me over the line.
Falling into the nothing that
I've become.
Stranger among them
Wrapped up in rage
Lost in the busy crowd
Emotion is barely contained
Drifting in and out of sanity
In and drab and dreary world
I'm God's lonely man
Alone in silence, I crave the pain.
With or without you
I'll die alone.
Unfiltered rage flows through me.
The worlds the victim, or it is it me?
