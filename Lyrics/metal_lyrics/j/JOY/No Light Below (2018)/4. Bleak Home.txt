Wounds aren't only restricted to flesh
Cut into wood
Carved into stone
Lying much deeper than eyes can behold
Infection will spread to the soul
Wounds aren't always inflicted inside
Cut into wood
Carved into stone
Cover the surface for eyes to behold
Depression will harden the soul
Scars run deeper than you think.
Damaged and all alone
In this bleak home, forced to grow cold
Ignite the match
Fuel the cleansing flame
Burn it down
Monument to grief and sorrow
Burn it down
Memories of pain
