Separated voluntarily
Or so it seems
Born with hatred burning in my eyes
How can I be okay?
Living with such disdain
Fists full of rage
Grinding teeth
Pissed off by everything I see
I see the worst in man
Their vile actions replay in my head
I despise them
Point the finger back at me I still hate what I see
Admit the harsh truth
I can't pretend
I'm still one of them
I'm no different
No matter how hard I try
I despise them, so I despise me too
