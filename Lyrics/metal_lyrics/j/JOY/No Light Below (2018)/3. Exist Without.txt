Pull me down.
Drown me with earth
My ribs, and prison
Holding captive, my beating heart
Where do I run? I feel the limitation
Peel away, strip me clean
Unrelenting humanity
We can't fix it
This sickness, repeating
Unrelenting humanity
We can't change a thing
Calcified collectively
Can anything break it free?
Thinking with one mind
Forever unchanging.
I'm so sorry
Peel away, strip me clean
Unrelenting humanity
This sickness, repeating
Unrelenting humanity
