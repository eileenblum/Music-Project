Hatred and anger aimed at each other.
Violently killing our own.
Accepting suppression.
Without any question.
So quick to cast the first stone.
I won't blame you
If you decided to just look way
In your place I'd do the same.
Sometimes I question,
Fearing rejection
If something is even out there.
Observed from a distance.
All the injustice.
How could this be the plan?
If I were you I'd have given up.
Failure unending, why pardon us?
What's stopping them?
They could just pass the world
