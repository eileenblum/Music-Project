Swallowed by darkness
Surrounded by flame
A fire without any light
Feeling the burn
Consume every soul slowly
All of existence resides underneath
Longing for relief
I reach, I plea
That something would help or simply just end me
Shadowed forever
Eternal expansion
Hope in the distance
Always just out of reach
I can see
Illumination far above
I long to know it
I'm afraid nobody does
No light, no light below
Born in darkness, so it's all I know.
