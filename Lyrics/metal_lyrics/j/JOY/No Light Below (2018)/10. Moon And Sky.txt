Roots wrapped around every limb
Holding me down to the earth
She won't forgive me again I've learned to live with decay
This hollow existence could not even begin to satisfy the many needs of my dying flesh.
We become one
Roots wrapped around every limb
Holding me down to the earth
She won't forgive me again I've learned to live with decay
Cold and dark
The moon and sky look down on this delicate and foolish display.
The cycle of life and death will repeat without any end
We've been here before.
I've learned to live with decay.
