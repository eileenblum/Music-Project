Suffocating in the grasp.
Life's cold fingers wrapped around my throat.
Constant searching for some relief.
Unknown salvation is what we seek.
Forward motion with blinded eyes.
What we need, left undefined.
Suffocation never ending
Will to live is slowly fading into the dark
Living is hurting my soul
We weren't made to feel this way.
How is it better than killing myself?
