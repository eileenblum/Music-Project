You'll never see the tears I cry
You'll never feel my heart in pain
You'll never know the reasons why
I'll never fall in love again You can stare into mens' eyes
And give them love that's a pack of lies
You're out on the streets again and alone, whoa I wanna say I love you
But you don't really care
Pull the knife out from my back
Who said that love was fair? You'll never see the tears I cry
You'll never feel my heart in pain
You'll never know the reasons why
I'll never fall in love again I'm sleeping all alone tonight
No time to bleed, no time to fight
I built a wall around my heart, whoa It's sad when no one loves you
Is that so hard to bear?
A life that's lost to loneliness
Who said that love was fair? You'll never see the tears I cry
You'll never feel my heart in pain
You'll never know the reasons why
I'll never fall in love again You'll never see the tears I cry
You'll never feel my heart in pain
You'll never know the reasons why
I'll never fall in love again You'll never see the tears I cry
You'll never feel my heart in pain
You'll never know the reasons why
I'll never fall in love again You'll never see the tears I cry
You'll never feel my heart in pain
You'll never know the reasons why
I'll never fall in love again
