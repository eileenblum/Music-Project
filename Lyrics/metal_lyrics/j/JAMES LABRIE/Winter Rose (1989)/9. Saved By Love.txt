You know how I feel about you
You know I canât live without you
There are no hands I need to lead my mind
When I feel your heart is with me
Your side is all beneath me
Without your love to guide me I am blind
I never thought to cry but I know the reasons why
Our love for life could see itâs end
Another guild to climb feels like a mountain in time
Until my love surrounds you
Saved by love again
Iâve been saved by love again
Now I can fight until the end
Saved by love again
Now I can fight until the end
Iâve been saved by love again
Iâve had to walk the high road
Iâve always pull the full load
To help me break the wall and shared my life
If I said I want to see you
Would you say I will never leave you
And give me love to guide me all through time
I never thought to cry but I know the reasons why
Our love for life could see its end
Another guild to climb feels like mountain in time
Until my love surrounds you
Saved by love again
Iâve been saved by love again
Now I can fight until the end
Saved by love again
Now I can fight until the end Iâve been saved by love again
Saved by love again
Been saved by love again
Now I can fight until the end
Saved by love again
Now I can fight until the end
Iâve been saved by love again
Saved by love again
Saved by love again
