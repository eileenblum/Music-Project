I've spent some time
In and out of the rain
It was beautiful
The way you walked into my life

Now
That my love is yours
you're oh, so far away
But I need you here
To feel you by my side

Dianna
Will hold you in my arms again?
Dianna
What am I going to do?
I want to make love to you
Dianna

I've dreamed of nights
With our hearts left unchained
I'd be with you
Even though we were apart

And now that my love is yours
You're oh, so far away
But need you here
To feel you by my side

Dianna
Will hold you in my arms again?
Dianna
What am I going to do?
I want to make love to you
Dianna

I know we'll be together
Love can stand the best of time
Forever

The victory's so sweet
The world would kneel at my feet
I can hardly wait
'Till we're together

Dianna
Will hold you in my arms again?
Dianna
What am I going to do?
I want to make love to you
Dianna
