[Japanese Bonus Track][Richard Chycki / James LaBrie]

Johnny lay your money down
He's lived the life of a thug
Drawing tears and blood
From a thousand lives
And they'll never forgive him

Angie's up for sale at night
She's got a heart made of stone
She never sleeps alone
In the cold moonlight
But he can't forget her

No sugar tonight
He wants her love but he won't buy

WHEN YOU'RE IN MY ARMS
IT'S THE THRILL OF THE NIGHT
WHO REALLY CARES IF IT'S WRONG OR IT'S RIGHT
AS LONG AS IT'S THE THRILL OF THE NIGHT

He rolls a window down
She says "Hey baby
Let's take a little ride 'round town
You'll have the time of your life!"

Angie, won't you settle down?
You're a back street queen
A nasty sex machine
We can change our lives
Let's get away 
Let's get away

No sugar tonight
He wants her love but he won't buy

WHEN YOU'RE IN MY ARMS
IT'S THE THRILL OF THE NIGHT
WHO REALLY CARES IF IT'S WRONG OR IT'S RIGHT
AS LONG AS IT'S THE THRILL OF THE NIGHT

No one can stop us once we're gone
It's time we paid the price by making amends
Take my hand Angie

WHEN YOU'RE IN MY ARMS
IT'S THE THRILL OF THE NIGHT
WHO REALLY CARES IF IT'S WRONG OR IT'S RIGHT
AS LONG AS IT'S THE THRILL OF THE NIGHT


Thanks to Donna for sending track #10 lyrics.
