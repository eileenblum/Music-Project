Pretty lady, I'll stand in your way
For before you leave I have something to say
I don't mean to lead you on to a living hell's coldness
I just wanna feel another one of your kisses Remember the happy days gone by
When you're in my world, I'm up in your sky
And you can count on
Nothing but the best
Nothing but the best for my love
She'll receive no less
But nothing but the best for my love
What you want is to run wild wild and free
Yeah, you're all locked up and that may be life's only key
I see you walkin' alone, you're lookin' so lonely
I know inside that you cry, your heart feelin' empty Rosalie
And little woman you'll feel fine
Oooh, when you're teasing the world tonight
And you can count on
Nothing but the best
Nothing but the best for my love
She'll receive no less
But nothing but the best for my love
Nothing but the best
But nothing but the best for my love
Oh yeah, come over here baby
Oooh, I gotta tell ya, tell ya I can't take no more
I see that want in your eyes
Move your hips like this! Nothing but the best
Nothing but the best for my love
She'll receive no less
But nothing but the best for my love
Nothing but the best
Nothing but the best for my love
She'll receive no less
But nothing but the best, baby, for my love
Nothing but the best, yeah
Nothing but the best for my love
Yeah!
