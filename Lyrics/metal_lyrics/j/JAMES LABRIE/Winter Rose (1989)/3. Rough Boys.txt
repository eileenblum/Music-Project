Donât waste time by complaining
They live like most others
wouldnât dare
Sliding like snakes through the alleys
Theyâre raising hell everywhere

Fighting so hard survive

One of the boys didnât make it
A subway rat shot him dead
The story goes on and on
With blood
the streets are painted red

When they take to the streets
Look out
You better run and hide

Street-struttinâ sinners
That promise to deliver
A night to fear for you life

Rough boys
Donât bring âem down
Theyâre not toys
You donât push âem around
Rough boys
Theyâll put you deep underground
Youâll never get out alive
When youâre dealing with
The rough boys

Theyâve got sweet talkinâ honeys
With an eye for the finer things in life
Licking blood-red lips they speak their minds
With a flash of knife

Over here, over there
Running fast, running scared
Watch out
No time to spare

Rough boys are in town
Theyâll turn it upside down
The fight goes on
To again a piece of ground
