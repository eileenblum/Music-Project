Is it any wonder
You're still knocking at my door
I'm living on the run now
I thought you're shadow was no more

Turning up the radio
I sill hear you call my name
What do you want, a serenade?
I don't want play your games

There's no time for dreaming
When living is now
And in the morning when you make up
I'm free for now

If you want me just squeeze me
And never let me go
Use me and abuse me
Just never let me go

Watching life melt away
I don't want to waste your time
Rain softly on you
Tears of your own design

I feel your arms
get a hold on me
You're running straight for my heart
I'm never near at the light of day
We you knew right from the star

You're a cheap, sweet angel face
In the back seat for a ride
I can see the devil
By the look that's in your eyes

If you want me just squeeze me
And never let me go
Use me and abuse me
Just never let me go

Do you want me baby?
Do you need my baby?

Looks like run and thunder
When you take me in your hand
You know I melt in your mouth
But you just don't understand

I told you before and I'll say it again
When you're throwing out the chains
What do you want, a serenade?
I don't play no games

If you want me just squeeze me
And never let me go
Use me and abuse me
Just never let me go
