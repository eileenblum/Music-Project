Whoa Honey-do
I guess you really knew your game
Makes things easier
Knowing if you feel the same

Thinkin' of a cool line
I wanted you to know my kind
I feel love's in the air
Hopin' you'll feel inclined

You're the one kind of fantasy
Showing all your disguise
You're the one that's gonna be
Sharing one last time

One
Last Time
Who loved you?
One Last Time
And who needed you?
One Last Time
Just dance for me
One
Last Time

Whoa Honey-do
I love the way you entertain
Now you live a life
With no one else to blame
Screaming for a good time
Tell me who's next in line
I feel love's in the air
I just wanna unwind

You're the one kind of fantasy
Showing all your disguise
You're the one that's gonna be
Sharing one last time

One last time
Who loved you?
One Last Time
And who needed you?
One Last time
Just dance for me
One last time

One last time
Who loved you?
One Last Time
And who needed you?
One Last time
Just dance for me
One last time

[Lead]

You're the one kind of fantasy
Showing all your disguise
You're the one thats gonna be
Sharing one last time

One last time
Who loved you?
One Last
Time
And who needed you?
One Last time
Just dance for me
One Last Time

One last time
Who loved you?
One Last Time
And who needed you?
One
Last time
Just dance for me
One Last Time!
