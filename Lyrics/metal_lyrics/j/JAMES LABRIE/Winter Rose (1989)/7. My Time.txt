Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah!
In a life of dreams
I sense reality
By living your fantasy
Not much time left for me
Well I'm know it's true
When I'm looking at you
Trapped in someone else's mind
How could I be so blind?
The eyes of a heart see right through
I'm a lonely man who can't take anymore from you
It's my time
My time to leave you
Behind
It's my time
My time to leave you
Behind
You say I can do
What you want me to, whoa
Say you'll stay for a time
At least until your mine
Its so deceiving
I feel the pain increasing, whoa
Get another lover's game
Don't you feel any shame?
The eyes of a heart see right through
I'm a lonely man who can't take anymore from you
It's my time
My time to leave you
Behind
It's my time
My time to leave you
Behind
It's my time
My time to leave you
Behind
It's my time
My time to leave you
Behind
Eyes of a heart see right through
I'm a lonely man who can't take anymore from you
It's my time
It's my time
My time to leave you
It's my time
My time to leave you
Behind
It's my time
My time to leave you
Behind
It's my time, my time
Whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah yeah
It's my time
