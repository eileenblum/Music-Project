Your cold voice locks me up
Like a prison cell,
Desolate and devoid of light

One day I will break free
Like a convict would
Scale a wall in the dead of night
That's right

'Cause I've been trying to forget you anyway, anyhow
I never wanted some amnesia more than I do now
So I can erase the memories of a love that was never true
So I could forget you

You're a scene in my head
That's been on repeat
I need a way to shut it off

One day I'll close my eyes
And you won't be there
Because I will find a way to make it stop

'Cause I've been trying to forget you anyway, anyhow
I never wanted some amnesia more than I do now
So I can erase the memories of a love that was never true
So I could forget you

Nothing will be like it was before
I'm not gonna need you anymore
'Cause I'm done going through the revolving door
The revolving door

'Cause I've been trying to forget you anyway, anyhow
I never wanted some amnesia more than I do now
So I can erase the memories of a love that was never true
So I could forget you

'Cause I've been trying to forget you anyway, anyhow
I never wanted some amnesia more than I do now
So I can erase the memories of a love that was never true
So I could forget you
