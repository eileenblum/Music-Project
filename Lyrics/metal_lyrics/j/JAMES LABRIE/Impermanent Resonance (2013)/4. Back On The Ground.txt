You lost in outer space
And I don't mean to burst your balloon
Put yourself in my place
While you orbit around the moon

You know I've tried my best
You never gave me the time of day
And now you're out of breath
And heading 'cross the Milky Way

Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Shake off the stardust
Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Just not on Venus
Don't make it any worse
Just throw it in reverse
Come on, come on
Come on down to earth
Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Back on the ground
Back on the ground

Riding a solar wind
As you weave through Saturn's rings
You dig your heels in
But that's not gonna solve a thing

You know I've tried my best
You never gave me the time of day
And now you're out of breath
And heading 'cross the Milky Way

Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Shake off the stardust
Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Just not on Venus
Don't make it any worse
Just throw it in reverse
Come on, come on
Come on down to earth
Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Back on the ground
Back on the ground

No tractor beam to pull you here
And breaking through the atmosphere
The vacant space between your ears doesn't get it, doesn't get it

You know I've tried my best
You never gave me the time of day

Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Shake off the stardust
Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Just not on Venus
Don't make it any worse
Just throw it in reverse
Come on, come on
Come on down to earth
Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Back on the ground
Back on the ground

Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Shake off the stardust
Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Just not on Venus
Don't make it any worse
Just throw it in reverse
Come on, come on
Come on down to earth
Gotta get your feet back on the ground
Back on the ground
Back on the ground
