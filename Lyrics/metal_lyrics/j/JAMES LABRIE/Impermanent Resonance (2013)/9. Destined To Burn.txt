You've been taken
From all that
You've ever know
There's no question
You're already on your own

What's going on here
What have we done
Something's wrong
This can't be right
Coffles and strangers
Pushing further
Beaten well into the night

We cannot alter or change
Gainst our will held in chains
Difference in colour of skin
Is my sin

What gives them the right to take away
All I could've loved til my dying day
Is this bridge really destined to burn?

Pale skinned serpent
There's no conscience eating you
My sole purpose
What God has done onto you

What if the tables were reversed
With all your rights taken away
Suddenly perverse
It's a nightmare
No one's waking you today

We cannot alter or change
Gainst our will held in chains
Difference in colour of skin
Is my sin

What gives them the right to take away
All I could've loved til my dying day
Is this bridge really destined to burn

Shrouded in fear
Morales reversed now
Battered til the core to one's soul
Lighter a shade
You steal then you break
Even one's own faith

We cannot alter or change
Gainst our will held in chains
Difference in colour of skin
Is my sin

What gives them the right to take away
All I could've loved til my dying day
Is this bridge really destined to burn
