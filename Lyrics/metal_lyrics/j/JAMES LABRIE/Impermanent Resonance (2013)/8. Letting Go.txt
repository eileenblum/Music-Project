It's the same, all you see
Nothing's new,
Time to aim, smash the mold,
Break right through

Right now you can't get by
And even if you try
You know that deep inside
It's killing... you (it's killing... me)
It's killing... you (it's killing... me)
It's killing... you

Letting go what's defining me,
Letting go
I can't make them believe or reason
I can tell by their reaction
They don't have my back
I'm letting go all that I am

Know it fits, real assured
It's enough,
You admit looking back,
Was messed up

What has become on me
I'll take that chance break free
There's nothing here for me
Stuck in a rut,
I'm feeling stuck
I'm feeling stuck

Letting go what's defining me,
Letting go
I can't make them believe or reason
I can tell by their reaction
They don't have my back
I'm letting go all that I am

I will survive with or without you
My head held high with or without you

Letting go what's defining me,
Letting go
I can't make them believe or reason
I can tell by their reaction
They don't have my back

I'm letting go all that I am

Letting go what's defining me,
Letting go
I can't make them believe or reason
I can tell by their reaction
They don't have my back
I'm letting go all that I am
