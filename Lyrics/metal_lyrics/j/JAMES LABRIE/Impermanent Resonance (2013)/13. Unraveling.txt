[Limited Edition Digipack Bonus Track]I know that look hidden in your eyes
I've seen more than I dare to count tonight
And I don't wanna fight

It's like a storm heading straight for me
The thunder rain and the lighting unleashed
It's getting hard to breath

And at the break of dawn
We'll search through the remains of broken hearts
Are we losing everything, cause underneath the veil
We're two pages in a hopeless fairy tale unraveling

I wanna speak but I hate the words
I wanna cry but my tears come out as fire
How do we break this curse

When did our world start caving in
We're crashing down in a violent spin and love is evaporating

And at the break of dawn
We'll search through the remains of broken hearts
Are we losing everything, cause underneath the veil
We're two pages in a hopeless fairy tale unraveling

We're like a ship sinking in slow motion
How do we fix what can't be unbroken
Don't really know but I'm slowly losing my faith, my faith

And at the break of dawn
We'll search through the remains of broken hearts
Are we losing everything, cause underneath the veil
We're two pages in a hopeless fairy tale unraveling
