Sitting here silently
As you tear me down
With your words all night

What went wrong?
You're not you
And it's scaring me
Am I hearing you right?

Like a house of cards in the wind
One big gust and we could cave in
I don't want us haunted by what might have been

So I'm holding on, holding on, holding on
I just don't wanna let go
I'm holding on, holding on, holding on
'Cause deep down I already know
We're close
And there's no turning back
Once we're down that road
I'm holding on, holding on,
I'm holding on to you

Three A.M., half asleep
On a beat-up couch
Praying that we'll pull through

If I could I'd go back
And fix my mistakes
All the things I can't undo

Like a house of cards in the wind
One big gust and we could cave in
I don't want us haunted by what might have been

So I'm holding on, holding on, holding on
I just don't wanna let go
I'm holding on, holding on, holding on
'Cause deep down I already know
We're close
And there's no turning back
Once we're down that road
I'm holding on, holding on,
I'm holding on to you

Stop placing the blame because neither of us are perfect
It's not complicated. So don't analyze it to death

So I'm holding on, holding on, holding on
I just don't want to let go
I'm holding on, holding on, holding on
'Cause deep down I already know
We're close
And there's no turning back once
We're down that road
I'm holding on, holding on,
I'm holding on to you
