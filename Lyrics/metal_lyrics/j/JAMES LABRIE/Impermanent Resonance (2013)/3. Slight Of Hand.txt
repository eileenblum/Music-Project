Turned a page in my life
Thought it through, wasn't easy to do
Weighed the risks, slight of hand
If I miss, then life's not worth a damn

Too dark to see, too light to feel
One's fate is sealed

You're nothing but a liar

Don't try and change me
Waste of time
You'll never convince me
I'll walk away a better man
From something you don't understand

Don't try to change me
Waste my time
You'll never convince me
I'll walk away. It's who I am
I don't expect you'd understand

On the list I've been made
A high risk should have taken the fall
Odds against won't survive
No defense, end this once and for all

Too dark to see, too light to feel
One's fate is sealed

You're nothing but a liar

Don't try and change me
Waste of time
You'll never convince me
I'll walk away a better man
From something you don't understand

Don't try to change me
Waste my time
You'll never convince me
I'll walk away. It's who I am
I don't expect you'd understand

Let them try all they want
Come what may. I am through
With their lies, and their ways
Not the first who has tried
Nor the last they will betray

You're nothing but a liar
Don't try and change me
Waste of time
You'll never convince me
I'll walk away a better man
From something you don't understand

Don't try to change me
Waste my time
You'll never convince me
I'll walk away it's who I am
I don't expect you'd understand

You're nothing but a liar
Don't try and change me
Waste of time
You'll never convince me
I'll walk away a better man
From something you don't understand

Don't try to change me
Waste my time
You'll never convince me
I'll walk away it's who I am
I don't expect you'd understand
