One voice she hears
Taking control, leaving it's mark... Agony
Can't make her see it my way
Restrict you binge
Lunatic fringe struggles within... Agony
Losing her identity

Helpless feeling, it's eating you
Taking it's toll

You cannot give up again
Crack the door and he'll let himself right in
Rotten to the core, that grin
Lose a little more, patience wearing thin

When nothing else matters
Tattered, shattered
Abused, you are battered
Scattered, shattered
Know it's all messed up
You cannot give up

Wasting away,
Skin bruised and gray
Falling apart... Agony
Shut down more than yesterday
The perfect you
Now you're see through
It's killing you... Agony
No grasp of reality

Helpless feeling, it's eating you
Taking it's toll

You cannot give up again
Crack the door and he'll let himself right in
Rotten to the core, that grin
Lose a little more, patience wearing thin

When nothing else matters
Tattered, shattered
Abused, you are battered
Scattered, shattered
Know it's all messed up
You cannot give up

You cannot give up again
Crack the door and he'll let himself right in
Rotten to the core, that grin
Lose a little more, patience wearing thin

When nothing else matters
Tattered, shattered
Abused, you are battered
Scattered, shattered
Know it's all messed up
You cannot give up
