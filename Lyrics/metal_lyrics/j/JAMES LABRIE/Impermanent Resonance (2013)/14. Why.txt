[Limited Edition Digipack Bonus Track]New day, but the same routine
Is our engine almost running out of steam

But we pretend that we don't see the ugly truth
Crazy that we drag this on
When it's crystal clear that the fire's gone

There's nothing left but heavy scares for us to wear

But here we are, lost in the dark

Drifting apart

So tell me why, why are we wasting our time
Are we that scared of goodbye, that we'd rather
Be living a lie, tell me why
Can't we move on with our lives

If there was ever a chance
Guess it disappeared
Slipped through our hands

It's come and gone ain't coming back
Don't hold your breath

Now we're, just a masquerade
Stuck in a make believe, cause we're too afraid

We're running from reality to a dead end

So here we are lost in the dark

Drifting part

So tell me why, why are we wasting our time
Are we that scared of goodbye, that we'd rather
Be living a lie, tell me why
Can't we move on with our lives

How can we demagnetize
Pull apart and break the lies for good
Feels like it's impossible
To walk away when I know that I should

So tell me why, why are we wasting our time
Are we that scared of goodbye, that we'd rather
Be living a lie, tell me why
Can't we move on with our lives

So tell me why, why are we wasting our time
Are we that scared of goodbye, that we'd rather
Be living a lie, tell me why
Can't we move on with our lives
