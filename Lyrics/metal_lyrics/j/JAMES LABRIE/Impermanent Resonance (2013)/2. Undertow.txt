Tha waves crash over me
And there's no time to breathe
I think I might be in too deep

I don't know up from down
can't stop from spinnin' round
No hope of laning on my feet

Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go, I'm stuck inside a nightmare

When I'm scared an silently scream "no"
My heart's beating fast but I'm moving slow
Before I start sinking below
You grab on and never let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go
When I need you the most
You pull me out of the undertow

But nine times out of ten
I'll just fall in again
And one would think that I would learn

After all this time now

Repeat the same mistakes
Get trapped under the breaks
And playin' with fire just gets me
Gets me, gets me burned

Nowhere to go, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go, I'm stuck inside a nightmare

When I'm scared an silently scream "no"
My heart's beating fast but I'm moving slow
Before I start sinking below
You grab on and never let me go
Don't let me go, don't let me go
When I need you the most
You pull me out of the undertow

Face down in the sand
Think I understand now
Seen my stubborn ways
And it's time I give a damn

When I'm scared an silently scream "no"
My heart's beating fast but I'm moving slow
Before I start sinking below
You grab on and never let me go
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
When I need you the most
You pull me out of the undertow
