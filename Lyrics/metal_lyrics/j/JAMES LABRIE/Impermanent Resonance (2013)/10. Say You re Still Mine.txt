Looking away, don't wanna see you crying
'Cause I can feel it,
There's no escape
All of the lies are there

If I could I would go back
I would turn back the time
But all I can say, I'll do what it takes from now

Say you're still mine,
That we're not broken in two
Say you're still mine,
Say it's me and you

I never thought
That I'd be so close to sinking
It hurts to look in your eyes
It cuts just like a knife

I know I've gone too far,
Afraid I broke your heart
But you're all that I want
You're all that I need to go on

Say you're still mine,
That we're not broken in two
Say you're still mine,
Say it's me and you

'Cause without you, I'm dying, I'm dying
I won't give up trying, no
Just say you're still mine
Say it's me and you

Say you're still mine,
That we're not broken in two
Say you're still mine,
Say it's me and you

Say you're still mine,
That we're not broken in two
Say you're still mine,
Say it's me and you
