Just me myself an I
I just don't get it right
No matter what I try

And I just want to run
From what's about to come
I can't keep hope alive

When I veer so far off the course
When I'm stuck and can't take anymore

It's easy to forget
When I'm scared half to death
You never left my side

I don't need stars I can wish upon
And I don't need some magician with a magic wand
That could wave just to make me strong
'Cause I got you

I don't need stars I can wish upon
And I don't need some magician with a magic wand
That could wave just to make me strong
'Cause I got you

When down and out of luck
And things just don't add up
When I just want to shout

And wrong just feels so right
Not always black or white
Can't figure this thing out

When I veer so far off of the course
When I'm stuck and can't take anymore

It's easy to forget
When I'm confused at best
You rid me of my doubts

I don't need stars I can wish upon
And I don't need some magician with a magic wand
That could wave just to make me strong
'Cause I got you

I don't need stars I can wish upon
And I don't need some magician with a magic wand
That could wave just to make me strong
'Cause I got you

[Solo]

When I veer so far off of the course
When I'm stuck and can't take anymore

It's easy to forget
When I'm scared half to death
You never left my side

I don't need stars I can wish upon
And I don't need some magician with a magic wand
That could wave just to make me strong
'Cause I got you

I don't need stars I can wish upon
And I don't need some magician with a magic wand
That could wave just to make me strong
'Cause I got you
