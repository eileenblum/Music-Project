[Guillory/LaBrie]

You think that I'm losing my mind
You think that I'm hopelessly blind
You Think that I'm weak but I'm strong
You think that I'm down but your wrong

You don't
Have a clue
Do you?

Nothing you say
Nothing you do
Matters to me
It's really nothing new
So laugh all you want
Cause I don't give a damn
I'm not, I'm not who you think I am

You think that I'm just a disgrace
You think that I'm just wasted space
You think that I'm dumb
Well nice try.
You think that I'm lost, its a lie

You don't
Have a clue
Do you?

Nothing you say
Nothing you do
Matters to me
It's really nothing new
So laugh all you want
Cause I don't give a damn
I'm not, I'm not who you think I am

You don't know the first thing
You don't know the first thing
No.
You don't know the first thing
You don't know the first thing about me

Nothing you say
Nothing you do
Matters to me
It's really nothing new
So laugh all you want
Cause I don't give a damn
I'm not, I'm not who you think I am

Nothing you say
Nothing you do
Matters to me
It's really nothing new
So laugh all you want
Cause I don't give a damn
I'm not, I'm not who you think I am

Who you think I am
I don't give a damn
Who you think I am
I don't give a damn
