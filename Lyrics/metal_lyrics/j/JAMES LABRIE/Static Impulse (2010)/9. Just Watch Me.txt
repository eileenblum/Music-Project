[Guillory/LaBrie]

I've realized the errors of my ways
I've come to terms that I've gone astray
I'm far from perfect

I know that I have let you down
But that will change this time around
I'll earn your respect

No promises broken
That's for sure
No wishin' and hopin'
I find a magic cure
This time I'll do things differently
This time I will do it
Just watch me

It's clear you're scared and I understand
It's not been great just like we planned
But I will show you

No promises broken
That's for sure
No wishin' and hopin'
I find a magic cure
This time I'll do things differently
This time I will do it
Just watch me
