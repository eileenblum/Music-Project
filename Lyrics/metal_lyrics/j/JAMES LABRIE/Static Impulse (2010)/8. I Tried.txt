[Guillory/LaBrie]

What have you to prove
I honestly don't care
It's all so petty, so petty
I cant get in a word
So go and speak your mind
I hope, your happy, your happy

If there's one thing
You remember
Though I tried to warn you
I don't have all the answers
But I know a thing or two
I see it, believe it
You've been eaten up by pride
If there's one thing
You remember
Remember
I tried

I don't how how
To make you understand
Cause you wont listen, wont listen
Whats come over you
It's getting out of hand
Just stop
Your bitchin' your bitchin

If there's one thing
You remember
Though I tried to warn you
I don't have all the answers
But I know a thing or two
I see it, believe it
You've been eaten up by pride
If there's one thing
You remember
Remember
I tried

If there's one thing
You remember
Though I tried to warn you
I don't have all the answers
But I know a thing or two
I see it, believe it
You've been eaten up by pride
If there's one thing
You remember
Remember
I tried
