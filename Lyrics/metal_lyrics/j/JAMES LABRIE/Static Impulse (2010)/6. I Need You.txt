[Guillory/LaBrie]

Caged in
With all the crackheads
Facing my fears all rolled up into one
Waiting
seems like forever
It's only the first day
Guess hell has begun

Can't find a way out
No

My head
Spinning in circles
Don't know what's up
And I don't know what's down
Wake up
This is a nightmare
Wanna get off of this merry-go-round

I can't do this on my own
And I don't have to be alone

(So)
Help me
Send calvary to the rescue
I need you to
Save me
I have nothing to hold on to
I need you

Searching
Looking for answers
Wondering why does it have to be me
Then you
Lifted the curtain
Just so my blind eyes would finally see

I can't do this on my own
And I don't have to be alone

(So)
Help me
Send calvary to the rescue
I need you to
Save me
I have nothing to hold on to
I need you

I'm filled with doubt
So get me out
I don't care for this one bit
I need blue skies
To dry my eyes
I just can't take it
No

I can't do this on my own
And I don't have to be alone

(So)
Help me
Send calvary to the rescue
I need you to
Save me
I have nothing to hold on to
I need you
(I am broken
Rescue me)
I need you to
Save me
I have nothing to hold on to
I need you
