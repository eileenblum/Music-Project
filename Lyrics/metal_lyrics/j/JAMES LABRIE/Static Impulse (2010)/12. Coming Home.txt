[Guillory/LaBrie]

Feels like rain
Closing in on me again
Cant deny
Angry skies are falling
So farewell
Wish there was some other way
Cant undo, There's no use in trying
I hope that they will understand

Know that
I wont be coming home
Far away from where I belong
Tell my wife, my best friend
Both my children I love them
Know that I,
Know that I wont be coming home

Speak the truth
Know me for the man I am
Don't you cry
Water came from dying
Know me for the man I am

Know that
I wont be coming home
Far away from where I belong
Tell my wife, my best friend
Both my children I love them
Know that I,
Know that I wont be coming home

What if I,
I told you then
Could you help me
Would you help to
Set me free
I cant feel any remorse
Have no recourse

Apathy
Apathy

Running out of time
I hope they will understand

Know that
I wont be coming home
Far away from where I belong
Tell my wife, my best friend
Both my children I love them
Know that I,
Know that I wont be coming home
