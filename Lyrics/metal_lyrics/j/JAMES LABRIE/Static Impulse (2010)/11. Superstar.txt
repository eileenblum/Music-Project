[LaBrie/Guillory]

A masquerade
The spotlights glare
Exquisite fads to view
Your every move
Fixated eyes on you

The camera waits as you prepare
It comes so easily
Once borrowed shoes
Now high society
A celebrity

Your dreams
Are now reality
You've got everything
Adored
A two edged sword
Magazines, silver screens
A Superstar

You cannot stand what you've become
It's lost all its appeal
Your entourage
Has no clue what you feel
This time it's for real

Your dreams
Are now reality
You've got everything
Adored
A two edged sword
Magazines, silver screens
A Superstar

Not sure you like what you've become
How you think, what you feel
Should you care, how you look
What you're paid to put on
Know your part of the deal

Your dreams
Are now reality
You've got everything
Adored
A two edged sword
Magazines, silver screens
A Superstar

Influence the youth
Adored
Unbecoming of you
Exposed
One will never know
Nothing they can prove
A true Superstar's
What you are
