[Guillory/LaBrie]

Tell me what are you trying to prove
Spreading lies spinning stories
What gain do you get from all of this
Is it fame is it glory

Don't try to be someone that you're not
'Cause you know I'm not buying
The more that you open up your mouth
It's more time that you're lying

It's time
To re-
Define
You and me
It's clear
That you
Are my
Enemy

I'm ready
So why don't you come get me
What are you waiting for
There's no point in charades any more
This is war
This is war

I see how you're playing innocent
But I know what you're doing
You smile as you stab me in the back
So that trouble is brewing

To you it's all one big silly game
Just to see me defeated
I hope that you've gotten all your thrills
Did you get what you needed

It's time
To re-
Define
You and me
It's clear
That you
Are my
Enemy

I'm ready
So why don't you come get me
What are you waiting for
There's no point in charades any more
This is war
This is war

You couldn't leave well enough alone
The lights are on but nobody's home

It's time
To re-
Define
You and me
It's clear
That you
Are my
Enemy

I'm ready
So why don't you come get me
What are you waiting for
There's no point in charades any more
This is war
This is war
