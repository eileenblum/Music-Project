[Guillory/LaBrie/Sfogli]

I can't make it out
Was she looking my way
Checking to my right
But no one fit the part
She's messing with my head
But who am I to say

Shy boy his head in the sand
No risk of rejection then

You saw me twisting
You read my mind
I'm driving carelessly
Over the Edge
Threw caution to the wind
But who cares
I'm driving carelessly
Over the Edge

Paranoid I'm not
A warped sense of humor
So called friends
Never thinking she'd go this far
A raving dark beauty
Saddles up beside me

No gene pool lottery here
Last time I checked in the mirror

You saw me twisting
You read my mind
I'm driving carelessly
Over the Edge
Threw caution to the wind
But who cares
I'm driving carelessly
Over the Edge

Over the Edge
Over the Edge
I'm driving, driving
Over the Edge
Over the Edge
I'm driving

You saw me twisting
You read my mind
I'm driving carelessly
Over the Edge
Threw caution to the wind
But who cares
I'm driving carelessly
Over the Edge

She saw me twisting
She read my mind
Was driving carelessly
Over the Edge
No rope to reel me in
Out of time
I'm driving carelessly
Over the Edge
