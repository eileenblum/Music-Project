[Guillory/LaBrie]

I got her call last night
Let me know she had a good time
There was something, it just feels right
I wish it may, I hope that it might

Tired of bumming the streets alone
No relationships on my own
Forgot what it was like 'til she
'Til this lovely girl she touched me

I never felt
Euphoric so high
I just bumped into the man in the sky

You got me I'm yours
A spell on me
Look forward to seeing you
I'm outta control
Every reason to be
A romantic rendezvous

Don't tell me this is wrong
Hard to read but we get along
Let down my guard it's clear
A thought exterior means nothing here

I'll admit she's a bit odd
No centerfold or a great bod
What's up will all that hype
Stick chic's, bulimic, ain't my type

I never felt
Euphoric so high
I just bumped into the man in the sky

You got me I'm yours
A spell on me
Look forward to seeing you
I'm outta control
Every reason to be
A romantic rendezvous

Nobody's wrong here
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong here
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong here
Nobody's right
Nobody's right
Nobody's right

I never felt
Euphoric so high
I just bumped into the man in the sky

You got me I'm yours
A spell on me
Look forward to seeing you
I'm outta control
Every reason to be
A romantic rendezvous

She's got me I'm hers
A spell on me
Look forward to seeing her
I'm outta control
She's my ecstasy
I'm her junkie and she's my cure
