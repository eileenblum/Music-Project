[Guillory/LaBrie]

Rehabilitated me
You want me to lie
Free to go out on the streets
My fears in overdrive

I'll stick out as if I'm an alien
Just like that kid that never quite fit in
A fish in a bowl is where you'd rather me
Make sure I'm fed and be my eyes to see

A living hell no pearly gates
No second chance for this inmate

Don't know if I'll survive
Doctor Jekyll or Mister Hyde
I feel them both collide
Not easy to decide

Why celebrate
A waste of time
Right here's where I belong
They'd like to think
They healed my wounds
Believe me they are wrong

I did my time, I did it well
Propaganda, learned to gel
Can't shake the past
They won't let me
Infallible hypocrisy

Adieu farewell, I'm out of place
No second chance
It's much too late

Don't know if I'll survive
Doctor Jekyll or Mister Hyde
I feel them both collide
Not easy to decide

I have no voice
They shut me down
Who listens at any rate
I'll chart a course
In this playground
And follow it one day

Typecast
Stuck on this roundabout
A failed system
Inside and Out

Don't know if I'll survive
Doctor Jekyll or Mister Hyde
I feel them both collide
Not easy to decide
