[Guillory/LaBrie]

I can't be
Here not a...
One moment longer

My skin feels
It's crawling
Actions appalling

Ratified
Justified
To keep us quiet

Dominion
Opinion
The streets will riot

Whose interests are we supporting?
Convinced us in their reporting

Mislead
(No more lame excuses)
Mislead
(they should look the part)
We'll paint their lips a crimson red
Bang it over their heads
Then none of us will feel Mislead

It's your move
Can feel it
Tension is rising

No facial
Expression
But know they're lying

Forefathers
Words spoken
The constitution

Infected
Corrupted
Our institutions

Whose interests are we supporting?
Convinced us in their reporting

Mislead
(No more lame excuses)
Mislead
(they should look the part)
We'll paint their lips a crimson red
Bang it over their heads
Then none of us will feel Mislead

They've fallen short
Again to hell with their credentials
If we are to survive
Realize our full potential

Mislead
(No more lame excuses)
Mislead
(they should look the part)
We'll paint their lips a crimson red
Bang it over their heads
Then none of us will feel Mislead
