Like a stranger in the waiting
Her arrogance a sure foot in
Could blow her cover
If I warned them
Letting them know
She's not who she pretends

My stomach in knots
A relentless force
Consumed with these thoughts
That kept on playing over
I sway back and forth
My face it contorts
Interpret obscene
Oblivious I seem
It never will end
Look at what I am
I have no more pride
It ditched my ride
I'm useless
It happened so quick
It makes me feel sick
A sheer heart attack
I guess I got my wish

Now - Where are you now
Now - Where are you now

So you think that you can handle her
She's not your type
But man she's pulling you in
I've seen the look
Think you've got her all figured out
But you don't know
It's her who's pulling your strings

Your stomach in knots
A relentless force
Consumed with these thoughts
That keep on playing over
You sway back and forth
Your face it contorts
Interpret obscene
Oblivious I seemyou
It never will end
Look at who I am
I have no more pride
It ditched my ride
I'm useless
It happened so quick
It makes me feel sick
A sheer heart attack
I guess I got my wish

Now - Where are you now
Now - Where are you now

Hey Dad
Did you get my picture
Your girl turned out
Being just like you
You bought my love
And I'm rotten to the core
Don't know what's love
It's my tribute to you

My stomach in knots
A relentless force
Consumed with these thoughts
That kept on playing over
I sway back and forth
My face it contorts
Interpret obscene
Oblivious you've been
It never will end
Look at what I am
I have no more pride
You ditched my ride
I'm useless
Entangled in this
You know you're the prick
And can't take it back
Hey Dad but you knew best

Now - Where are you now
Now - Where are you now
Now - Where are you now
Now - Where are you now
