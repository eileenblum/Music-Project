Know how it came to this
The hit on me his kiss
Stripped of all dignity - The Man

I set him up - He brought me in
Portrayed the goon to trust - Befriend
Fed the machine - And lived the lie
Concealed the truth to stay alive

Two faced - Can't trace
Convinced what they see

Thick skinned - I'm in
Can't risk - Transparency

Rehearsed - well versed
Who I'm supposed to be
My nerves - I mask - Silence
The fear in me

This plan had better work
Their tapped I'm wired research
No swear I'll blend right in - Right in

Set them up - Knock em dead
Hesitate it's me instead

Lose my nerve - I'll take it all
And I pray he takes the fall

Two faced - Can't trace
Convinced what they see

Thick skinned - I'm in
Can't risk - Transparency

Rehearsed - well versed
Who I'm supposed to be
My nerves - I mask - Silence
The fear in me

Digging in
I'm digging further
I know I'm In Too Deep
Now in the game
I must deliber
To end what's happening
Digging in
I'm digging further
I know I'm In Too Deep
And I intend
To blow their cover
To end what's happening

Keep talking this way
Got something to say
Information you want more
Just gotta even the score
Can't stop the balls in play
Their trust they'll make you pay
White shark loans you
White shark owns you
Which side's gonna save you
Which side's gonna play you
Shake down won't take long
Bulletproof vest on
Witness prorection
Gave me their direction
You fucking moron - Defecting

Digging in
I'm digging further
The dampness setting in
Six feet too deep
I feel the madman
Slowly creeping in
Digging in
I'm digging further
The worst is happening
I lie, I breathe the air they feed me
Would welcome smothering
Digging in
I'm digging further
The dampness setting in
Six feet too deep
I feel the madman
Slowly creeping in
