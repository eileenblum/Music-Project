Father watch me fall
Witness my mistakes
I have lost it all
I'm about to break

Before the sound of dawn
I turned my back on you
The life in me was gone
My consciousness withdrew

Fear... Tormenting me
Guilt... Won't let me be

I chose a different way
But there's nowhere I could hide
From one end of the world
To the other side

I've never felt as cold
As I do today
There's nothing here to hold
No reason I should stay

Crucify... Resist, deny
Kill the pain that dwells inside
Send your word
From on high
So this part of me will die

Can you hear my thoughts
I know what I have done
You are all I've got
And I don't want to run

Surrender to your will
From the ashes I am new
Your presence is revealed
Showing all that's true

Fear... Tormenting me
Guilt... Won't let me be

Crucify... Resist, deny
Kill the pain that dwells inside
Send your word
From on high
So this part of me will die

Crucify... Resist, deny
Kill the pain that dwells inside
Send your word
From on high
So this part of me will die
