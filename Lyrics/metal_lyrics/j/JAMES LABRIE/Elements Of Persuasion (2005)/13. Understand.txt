Give me all the now that I can borrow
Let me have this moment for a while
This storm will be here at this time tomorrow
And I'll have just a memory of her smile

And ill be left to wonder
Could I've done more?
Fighting the stress and under
Waiting for control

Let it out
Let it out
Let it out

I accept the circumstance of truth now
Too petty I'm facing it alone
I've got to summon strength within me somehow
As I head into a future thats unknown

And ill be left to wonder
Could I've done more?
Fighting the stress and under
Waiting for control

Let it out
Let it out
Let it out

More down then I'm up untied
It makes no sense The mess that I'm in
But I can't give up till the both of you
Are here in my life again

Let it out
Let it out
Let it out
Let it out
Let it out
Let it out
