I lay awake
I'm feeling weak
Not sure I can go on
Please take me far
There's nothing I can give
All I had is gone

Buildings fell
Stealing people's dreams
A way of life
Guess we don't fit
Fit their plans

Familiar streets
Familiar sites
Places where friends meet

It's been a while
So much has changed since then
The future seems so bleak

Nothing stands
All's been lost
They silence our despair

Keep your cool
World is watching you
Act as though you care

Buildings fell
Stealing people's dreams
A way of life
Guess we don't fit
Fit their plan

Watched so many of my
Loved ones fall today
It's like I'm standing here
With all of my past erased
The man I have become
Is not walking away
It is the memories
That makes the man you see

Buildings fell
Stealing people's dreams
A way of life
Guess we don't fit
Fit the plan

Our buildings burn
Can't comprehend
The loss surrounding me
And does it end
When no one's left to bleed
