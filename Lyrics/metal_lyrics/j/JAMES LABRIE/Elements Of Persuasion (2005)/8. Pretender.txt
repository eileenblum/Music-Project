Ahh, ahh, ahh
Lead me to the oceans white sands
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Where I can catch myself
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Let the water cool and soothe me
Ahh, ahh, ahh
A steady rhythm flows

I cannot deny it's holy
I know who you are
I can feel - You know me

Send your pretender
A man divine his power
Who dares judge or question
His words scripted by liars
Gross intervention

Proclaims their one desire
Distorting the facts
Ancient voices tired

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Forgotten words from long ago
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Speak volumes to me now
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Plagiarism is our truth
Ahh, ahh, ahh
Allegiance to a hoax

So these chosen few are holy
Perpetuate fear
Til the guilt consumes me

Send your Pretender
Designed for one Empire
Erase the offenders
Persecuted fires
They will not answer
For wars which they inspired
And those who surrender
Their voices growing tired

Shaped
Each one of us
Shadows of the
Third century
Our fate
A fatal error
Created our
Tragic history

Buried message
The writings of truth
Religions challenged
There not amused

Transformed vision
This truth recognized
No further deception
Their pious position

Send your Pretender
Designed for one Empire
Erase the offenders
Persecuted fires
Who dares judge or question
These words scripted by liars
They will not answer
For wars which they inspired

Parallels
Understanding
The message is clear
Fanned into full flame
Ideology
Beliefs in a system
Unlike philosophy
The failure to listen
