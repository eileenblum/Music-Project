Sometime after five
I don't know what I've done
But I put my car in drive
And I'm blinded by the sun

In my rearview mirror
The colors start to fade
My past just disappears
And I am so afraid

I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost

Thought I saw the sign
Perhaps I should have turned
I really see just fine
Guess I'm not concerned

Maybe I'll forget
The way things were before
It's too late for regrets
Cause I've opened up the door

I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost

I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm lost
Show me the way
I'm...
