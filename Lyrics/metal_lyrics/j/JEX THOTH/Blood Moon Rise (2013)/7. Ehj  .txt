So eager to please
And too stubborn to learn
Why you were down on your knees
The doorways turn
Ended up right back where you began
Confused and locked out

'Cause you still haven't learned
What you're all about
Yet I figured it out
Your heart doesn't yearn
You feel the fire
Let it burn!

One faltering mouth
And two vacuous eyes
Oh, the rest of you
Never asking why

Just searchin' for a new oneness to hold
To replace your love of a lie
Longin' to live
And flying to die

Let your blood run dry
While you stare at the sky
Oh, baby, precious baby, cry

So churn your weed
Your weapons are worn
Your words don't keep
Inside the storm
You haven't figured it out
Your heart doesn't yearn
You've killed the fired!
Let it burn!
