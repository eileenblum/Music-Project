She looked like my mother
She looked like me
We spoke to each other
Like wind through the trees
We move together
Like fire wild and free
We stuck to the night
Like the moon and a sea
We sang of worries
We sang of vengeance
We sang of furies
Poured out our silence

She told of wisdom
Told of the ashes
Telling me sweetly
To live while it passes
The raging world
Can nest her beauty
Smiling strangers
Can see her empty
I wonât forget the words she told me
To say a lie so she would know me
To say a lie so she would know me
Psyar
Death

Psyar
Death

Psyar
Death

Psyar
Death

Psyar
Death

Our tears like stones
She carried it beside her
Going slowly
Weighed down in water
The fiery angel
Said she reappears soon
If I donât see her
To look to the blank moon
