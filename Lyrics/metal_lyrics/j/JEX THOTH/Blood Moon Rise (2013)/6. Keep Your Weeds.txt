The fog that rises
When the constant collides
Dilute your disguises
Things you thought you could hide
Your home of a fire
The way you liked to tow the line
'Til thereâs nothing left to conquer
Nothing more to find
Tried to keep the sweets from souring
Wanted to sweep the leaves and brand them
Tried to leave the trees out again
And wanted to keep our weeds from flowering
The sounds that shatters
The moment to heal
The hope that staggers
Every truth you conceal
The farther you wander
The more you wonder
What's real
You choose to suffer
It's yours to feel
Tried to keep the sweet from souring
Wanted to sweep the leaves and brand them
Tried to leave the trees out again
And wanted to keep our weeds from flowering

Wanted to keep the sweet from souring
You wanted to sweep the leaves and brand them
You tried to leave the trees out again
And wanted to keep our weeds from flowering

Tried to keep the sweet from souring
Sweep the leaves and brand them
Tried to leave the trees out again
You wanted to keep our weeds from flowering
