Spend your time
In case time brought you change
You tried to hold the past
Nothing was the same
And you prayed it wouldn't last
Dare not shut your eyes
Don't trust yourself to sleep
Hold on to the bones
It's all we get to keep

Hold your bones
Clutching tiny candles
Wanting grand illumination
Lost inside their shadows
Search of desperate situations
Plotting in your mind
Kept you shielded from the cost
Haunted by your visions
Long for good things lost
Remember this my friend
The less you have to bury
The more we keep collecting
The more we have to carry
