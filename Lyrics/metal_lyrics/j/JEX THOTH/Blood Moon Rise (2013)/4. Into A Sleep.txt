Once you cross the mountain
You came across a fountain you tried to swallow whole
It cut your pretty mouth
You tried to spit it out
But it brought you to the floor

The ground turned over, over and over
And swallowed you whole
You cut its mouth, so it spit you out

You could hardly bear to know it
All the things you lived for, broken
Once the words were spoken
Lost under the dim
Didn't recognize your skin
Couldn't stop the motion
Round her corners
Deep in her shoulders
It searched for you
Curse it to the south
Blood in your mouth
Deep in your shoes
