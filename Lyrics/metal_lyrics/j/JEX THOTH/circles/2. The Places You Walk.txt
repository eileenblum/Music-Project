It holds you in its arms
Keeps you safe from harm
You're sent due from afar
The places you walk
In those harder parts
Happiest in the dark
Tryin' to squeeze out its void
Probably wrong
The places you walk

Told you flee
Take you into it now
You're running aimlessly
When you tried to kill the will within
Best beloveth, stay with me

Thought you had to decide
'Tween the bones and the hide
Better stop in destruction
The places you walk
Buried deep in your mind
All you know from time
The invisible fiend
You've been warned
Of the places you walk

Take your feet
Walk you into it now
Your heart dries endlessly
You know you tried to kill the will within
Leaving now, let it be

It holds you in its arm
Keeps you safe from harm
You're sent due from afar
The places you walk
In most harder parts
Happiest in the dark
Tryin' to squeeze out its void
From a walk
The places you walk
