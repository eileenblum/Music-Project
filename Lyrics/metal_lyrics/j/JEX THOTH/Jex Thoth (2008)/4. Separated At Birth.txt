Separated at birth
Marked at sister's birth
Glad to wander the earth
As strangers

Life has taken its time
Life has taken its toll
Life has taken you far
Away

Start with fading black night ???
Thee torn twins will get by ???
Thee twin hover beside
A grown mourn

I can't help being born
I'm not where I belong
I've been living too long
Without her

Where the emptiness grew ???
From a half moon tattoo
My memories cry out for you
At birth
