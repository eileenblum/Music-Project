O' sister, take my sin
There are serpents in my skin
I tell you, it's no lie
Run to the afterlife...

Those frozen crystal skies
A pyramid of life
Become Obsidian Night
Karmic stains on the imaginal minds

O' sister, it's my fate
To live my life in pain...
And never be reborn
Never regain in form

A spiritual life
Becomes Obsidian Night
So let's just say goodbye -
No more undead dreams in a subconscious eye
