Deviated one
Face oblivion
Solitude's refrain
Makes a mask of Cain

Stone evil
Flame vigil

Wounds like barren trees,
Dripping with disease
Blank soul decimate,
Fire without flame

Stone evil
Flame vigil

Silas Paine: guitars, bouzouki, flute
Grim Jim: bass, guitars
Zodiac: organ, synths, electric piano
Johnny Dee: drums
