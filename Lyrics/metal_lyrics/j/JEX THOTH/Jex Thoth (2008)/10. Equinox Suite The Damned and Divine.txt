Damned and divine
Stand side by side, together
No sense of time
They all think that they have forever
A life in the pyre
Or anointed water
Your time has expired
Don't cry for your father

Then comes the day
When we shine bright as the sun
And fates are made
[3x]

Damned and divine
Engaging in timeless nevers
All sons may decide
Their path like a fork in the river
A sad boy, the strong
Aside for the liar
The rivers are wide
Don't slide, be the waters

Then comes the day
When we shine bright as the sun
And fates are made
[3x]

Then comes the day
When we shine bright as the sun
And fates are made

Then comes the day
When we shine bright as the sun
And fates are made
