Black birds descend down upon everything
And go extinct with the death of spring
Circling sparrows that plunge from the sky
Terrible impulses to die

Shot through the cosmos and barely awake
Animals first to sense the shake
High rising tundras that crash on the shore
Fingerprints of what came before

Living, breathing bones
On the bottom of the sea
Awakened you will be
Shook within your homes

Devastating blows
Pandemonium
Awakened you will be
By the vengeance of the sea
