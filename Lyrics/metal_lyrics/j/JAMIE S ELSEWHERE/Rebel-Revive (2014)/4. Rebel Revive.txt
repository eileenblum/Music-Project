When the rain burst into tears
You were swept away
When the light approached the shore
It pulled you into me
If not for you I wouldn't be
Wouldn't be myself again
Cause you're the part of me who saved me
In the end

I'm searching for a way that I
Can save a place inside my heart
Cause I'm stuck inside my mind
And as the world goes down in burning flames
I came to realize
You're the only one I'd carry out alive

I'll carry you out alive

You cured the dark
You spread the light overhead
So I'll be waiting at the skyline as the past starts to set
He'll always try to break us down
Remember there is a heaven if we can get through this hell

I'm searching for a way that I
Can save a place inside my heart
Cause I'm stuck inside my mind
And as the world goes down in burning flames
I came to realize
You're the only one I'd carry out alive

I'll be here to guide you
When you're battling within
The walls did not define you
When they started caving in
You see
I've excused what's history
To help you understand
There is a reason you came into my life
I was running past
You were keeping me alive
You see
We all have history
But it's our future that defines

'm searching for a way that I
Can save a place inside my heart
Cause I'm stuck inside my mind
And as the world goes down in burning flames
I came to realize
You're the only one I'd carry out alive
I'm searching for a way that I
Can save a place inside my heart
Cause I'm stuck inside my mind
And as the world goes down in burning flames
I came to realize
You're the only one I'd carry out alive
