Till death do us part
Well death parted us
And when you inflame every word that hurt
I will sit and watch you burn

All I ever wanted was to clear your state of mind
All I ever needed was to find the closure that you hide
Just a little bit of closure Iâll be fine
But you won't give me any so
So here's a piece of mine!

Itâs three a.m.
Iâm fighting the silence
Reality is quiet
But my mind stays awake
Awake in this nightmare
No end to beginnings
Iâve failed to complete
Iâve failed to escape
Stare into the eyes of the beast
As he sets fire to lake
Framed
Your expression
Your expression as he opens up the gates
Framed
Your expression

All I ever wanted was to clear your state of mind
All I ever needed was to find the closure that you hide
Just a little bit of closure Iâll be fine
But you won't give me any so
So here's a piece of mine!

He's standing in the doorway
While tears run down his cheek
My pain is never ending
Iâve lost a part of me
He says dad please don't leave me
Son I will never leave
Iâll always be your father
He'll never take my place

Half a decade of wasted age

All I ever wanted was to clear your state of mind
All I ever needed was to find the closure that you hide
Just a little bit of closure Iâll be fine
But you won't give me any so 
So here's a piece of mine
So here's a piece of mine
So here's a piece of mine
Oh oo oh oo uh uh oh
You took my heart but not my mind
Just a little bit of closure Iâll be fine
But you won't give me any so 
So here's a piece of mine

So here's a piece of mine

But you won't give me closure so
So here's a piece of mine
