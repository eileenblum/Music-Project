[feat. Tyler Carter of Issues]Softly spoken,
But she had her way with words
Sewing up my conscience to cover up her wounds, oh
Materialistic, black dress and Tori shoes
Wrapped up in accessories to conceal her every move
I didn't see this coming

So here we are,
You caught me off guard
And now I'm stuck in love
With everything you are
When you went off the deep end I buried my head
I knew that I was stuck in love
With everything you're not, I hope you know

I hope you know
I hope you know
I hope you know

I should have never signed up to play
But it felt so right until it turned into a game, yeah
And that black dress (black dress) faded to grey
And the smoothest skin (smoothest skin) withered away
I should have seen this coming

So here we are,
You caught me off guard
And now I'm stuck in love
With everything you are
When you went off the deep end I buried my head
I knew that I was stuck in love
With everything you're not, I hope you know

I hope you know
You caught me off guard, I hope you know

Don't hate the player you created this game
Karma's a bitch that the whole world hates

You caught me off guard so here we are

So here we are,
You caught me off guard
And now I'm stuck in love
With everything you are
When you went off the deep end I buried my head
I knew that I was stuck in love
With everything you're not, I hope you know

So here we are,
You caught me off guard
And now I'm stuck in love
(now I'm with my heart upon your sleeve)
With everything you are
When you went off the deep end I buried my head
I knew that I was stuck in love
With everything you're not, I hope you know

I've got you nervous but you know you deserve this
I've got you nervous but you know you deserve this, baby
I've got you nervous but you know you deserve this
