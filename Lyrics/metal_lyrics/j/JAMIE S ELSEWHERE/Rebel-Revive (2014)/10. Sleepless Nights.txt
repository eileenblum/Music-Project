The only home I know
Is on the open road 
I sacrificed everything 
This is the life I chose 
Sometimes we lose sight inside 
What really matters most

Melody is therapy 
To get through the nights
You think it's easy to leave my blood
You think it's easy to hear him cry

I need to find my way
Find my way back home
Oh I beg and I plead
You'll understand someday
Why father had to go
And Iâve been missing a part of myself

There's not a piece of you in me
Twenty four years never to be seen
Iâll never be like you
You're just a sad excuse
You're just another dead beat!

You're just another dead beat!

Melody is therapy 
To get through the nights
You think it's easy to leave my blood
To leave my blood behind

I need to find my way
Find my way back home
Oh I beg and I plead
You'll understand someday
Why father had to go
And Iâve been missing a part of myself
And Iâve been missing you
Iâm not dismissing you
You're the most important part of me
And Iâm hoping one day you'll see
Why father had to go
Iâll find my way back home

Iâll find my way back home

Seven years now itâs my time
But where the fuck are you father of mine
Selfish
The road was my home
But my home holds my heart 
The blood in my bones

I need to find my way
Find my way back home
Oh I beg and I plead
You'll understand someday
Why father had to go
And Iâve been missing a part of myself
And Iâve been missing you
Iâm not dismissing you
You're the most important part of me
And Iâm hoping one day you'll see
Why father had to go
Iâll find my way back home

Make sure to hold your loved ones close
Cause there's an end to every road!
