Can we rewind
Play the past
And go back to the times
We had a positive message to spread
But times have changed
Everyone's contending for the bigger name
Your name is nothing (nothing)
Without the ones who follow you
Your fame starts crumbling (crumbling)
Without the support of devoted youth
FAME!
FAME!
You're obsessed
You're a mess
It's a shame
You're just another waste of a name

I'm just so sick of it all
Sick of the fiction in their words
I used to live by the messages
Hidden in the songs I heard
But I swear
I'll never for a second abandon my honesty
Won't act out a movie to be part of the music scene
If it's one thing that I know
It's that we're bringing the integrity home

I won't keep silent anymore
If you don't speak from the heart
Then these are my words
Pack your shit and leave
Cause we don't need another accident on the scene

Shhhhhhh
I've got something to say
Shut up
I've got something to say
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shut up
I've got something to say
You're no better than the rest
So put your ego away
Fuck You!
Sh-Sh-Sh-Shut up
I've got something to say
Something to say to you
Whatever happened to originality

I'm just so sick of it all
Sick of the fiction in their words
I used to live by the messages
Hidden in the songs I heard
But I swear
I'll never for a second abandon my honesty
Won't act out a movie to be part of the music scene
If it's one thing that I know
It's that we're bringing the integrity home

We lost ourselves
When we crashed
I packed my things
I'd play my part
but I don't act
Oh Oh Oh
Yeah
So I had a taste
And I couldn't leave
Until we brought
Some meaning to this music scene
Oh Oh Oh
Yeah

Let's Go

We lost ourselves
When we crashed
I packed my things
I'd play my part
But I don't act
Oh Oh Oh
Yeah
So I had a taste
And I couldn't leave
Until we brought
Some meaning to this music scene
Oh Oh Oh
Yeah

I'm just so sick of it all
Sick of the fiction in their words
I used to live by the messages
Hidden in the songs I heard
But I swear
I'll never for a second abandon my honesty
Won't act out a movie to be part of the music scene
If it's one thing that I know
It's that we're bringing the integrity home
