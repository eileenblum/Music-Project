[feat. Phil Druyor &amp; Nick Samson]Iâve had a problem or two (Iâve had a problem or two)
With the things that I know that Iâd ought to not do (ought a not do)
I said Iâd just have a few (just have a few an Iâm done)
And Iâm fucked up again but I guess it's nothing new
Is it surprising to you
Knowing everything about all the substance I abuse
And if you didn't
(If you didn't know) whoa now you know (now you know) now you know
Whoaohohohohohoooooooh (is it surprising to you) it's so surprising to you
Whoa (whoa) whoa (whoa)
Whoaohohohohohoooooooh

Well Iâve got this caffeine stacked on top off an amphetamine
And their both working out making sure that my heart stops beating and i know
This is clearly not the better me and I truly see
That this has gotten the best of me now
And I know that it's got to be something
I can feel it pulling me down to the ground
So I sew the edge of this glass back to my mouth

Twist it up fold me down
Don't want to be here when tomorrow rolls around
Oh I'm alive but I don't want to be
Can't get away from things my body tells me I need
Is it surprising to you
Knowing everything about all the substance I abuse (substance I abuse)
And if you didn't (if you didn't know) whoa oh now you know now you know

Well Iâve got this caffeine stacked on top off an amphetamine
And their both working out making sure that my heart stops beating and I know
This is clearly not the better me and I truly see
That this has gotten the best of me now
And I know that it's got to be something
I can feel it pulling me down to the ground
So I sew the edge of this glass back to my mouth

Bury me
I'm now the promise that I no longer wanted to be
Every last hit down to the bottom of bag please just let me be
My eyes see better my conscience is to fucked up to see
In case you didn't now you know

Well Iâve got this caffeine stacked on top off an amphetamine
And their both working out making sure that my heart stops beating and I know
This is clearly not the better me and I truly see
That this has gotten the best of me now
And I know that it's got to be something
I can feel it pulling me down to the ground
So I sew the edge of this glass back to my mouth
