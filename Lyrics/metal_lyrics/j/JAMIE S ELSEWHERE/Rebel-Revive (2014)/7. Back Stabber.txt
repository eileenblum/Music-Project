How could you call yourself a friend
You turned your back in the end
I held you right above my shoulders 
Through the thick and the thin
You're so undead to me 
You're dead to me

Backstabber
Backstabber

The worst of the enemy
Is what they pretend to be
Pathetic human beings
Just another wasted space in the human race
Just another wasted space in the human race

Backstabber ohhh
I can't believe
I can't believe you're running away
Running away from me
And I always had your back 
So tell me why would you attack me this way
Backstabber so two faced
Repulsive in every way
You're so undead to me
You're dead to me

What a surprise 
That you were no surprise at all
Too many seasons 
You were waiting for me to fall
What makes you feel alive
Spit drips from lips
As I enter my demise

Backstabber 
Backstabber

The worst of the enemy 
Is what they pretend to be
Pathetic human beings

Backstabber

Backstabber ohhh
I can't believe
I can't believe you're running away
Running away from me
And I always had your back 
So tell me why would you attack me this way
Backstabber
So two faced
Repulsive in every way
You're so undead to me
You're dead to me

Backstabber 
Backstabber

The worst of the enemy 
Is what they pretend to be
Pathetic human beings
Just another wasted space in the human race
Just another wasted space in the human race
