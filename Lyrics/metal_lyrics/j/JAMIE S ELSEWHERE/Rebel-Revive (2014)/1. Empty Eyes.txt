[feat. Garret Rapp]I refuse to to lie awake in this bed
While the world holds it's gravity over my head
You call this ignorant
I call your ignorance
I will never be one with the simple minded
We see through the weak
And we'll never be blinded
You're blowing smoke from your mouth
Actions speak louder then the words you've made out
And nothing worthy comes easy
But you can follow I'd rather be leading

Well we've been losing all the sleep in the night
We're painting pictures of our future it's in our minds
They sleep when we dream but
We strive to open up their empty eyes
No we won't ever be the ones who oblige
Their simple minds are even starting to realize
That their dreams are in reach
And we've tried to open up their empty eyes

And we tried to open their empty eyes
Blind sided by their simple minds

I've been placed in a position many fear
A voice traveled up my spine
As he whispered in my ear
And he said
Carry my voice and I will carry you
And I'll spread your every word
Just to cover up their wounds
Carry my voice and I will carry you
Carry my voice and I will carry you
Carry you

Well we've been losing all the sleep in the night
We're painting pictures of our future it's in our minds
They sleep when we dream but
We strive to open up their empty eyes
No we won't ever be the ones who oblige
Their simple minds are even starting to realize
That their dreams are in reach
And we've tried to open up their empty eyes

Once you stop dreaming you might as well be dead
I found a purpose in life with the air in my chest
When you stop dreaming you might as well be dead
So find your purpose in life
Every day I feel my ambition amplifying
And every day I see my dreams come true
Every day I feel my ambition amplifying
So make a promise to yourself you've got nothing to lose

Well we've been losing all the sleep in the night
We're painting pictures of our future it's in our minds
They sleep when we dream but
We strive to open up their empty eyes
No we won't ever be the ones who oblige
Their simple minds are even starting to realize
That their dreams are in reach
And we've tried to open up their empty eyes
No we won't ever be the ones who oblige
Their simple minds are even starting to realize
That their dreams are in reach
And we've tried to open up their empty eyes

And we tried to open up their empty eyes
