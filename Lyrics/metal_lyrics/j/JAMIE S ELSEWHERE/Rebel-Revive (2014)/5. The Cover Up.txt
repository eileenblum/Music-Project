Always so fixed on creations
But you're not my creator
You pick apart the flaws you find in me
But your broken so focus on
Picking up the pieces of your
State of mind
You were never there when I was
By your side
Well unlike you
The simple things in life
Are what I need to get by

No
No I can't change the past
Unveil the cover up inside of me
That I've locked away
Just to shut you out
But at least I held my breath
For long enough to find the person
Standing in front of me
Watching as I drown

Do you expect me
To believe oh ooo
In the depths of
Of your perception

I've got some news for you and your point of view oh
I'm watching I'm waiting for the strength to get me through
You put me through this hell and I'm back
I'm back to tell you
That I'm just calling it quits
Never been this sure in my life

No
No I can't change the past
Unveil the cover up inside of me
That I've locked away
Just to shut you out
But at least I held my breath
For long enough to find the person
Standing in front of me
Watching as I drown

When the water froze
I built a home around my heart
Just to keep you warm
But I traded in for another one
Sent back to a broken home

No
No I can't change the past
Unveil the cover up inside of me
That I locked away
Just to shut you out
But at least I held my breath
For long enough to find the person
Standing in front of me
Watching as I drown
Watching as I drown
Watching as I drown
Right in front of me
Watching as I drown
But at least I held my breath
For long enough to find the person
Standing in front of me
Just to watch me drown
