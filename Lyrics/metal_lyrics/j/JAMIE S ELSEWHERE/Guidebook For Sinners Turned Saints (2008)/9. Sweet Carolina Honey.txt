You feel you're close to the edge,
you fight off the terror of knowing what you're about to do.
Is this what your heart asks,
for falling to the ground?

So feel alive or believe that you want this for yourself,
to follow blindly up over the edge.
There's nothing to prove you've nothing to gain,
to just give up and throw it away.
So is this what you want?

You feel you're close to the edge,
you fight off the terror of knowing what you're about to do.
Is this what your heart asks,
for falling to the ground?

So what gives you the right to be so heartless?
Who gave up on you?
Do you feel thats a good enough excuse?
I doubt you'll ever see the truth.
No I expect you wont...

You feel you're close to the edge,
you fight off the terror of knowing what you're about to do.
Is this what your heart asks,
for falling to the ground?

So step over the edge.
Take a breath as your heart stops beating again,
Screaming to feel alive.
We cant save you from this.
Terror grips at your heart.
Oh god please just stop this,
to feel alive.

So is this where your heart breaks?
It's falling to the ground.
So is this where your heart breaks?
It's falling to the end of all we are.
