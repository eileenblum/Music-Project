s a quiet resort to the dead
So will you stay here with me?
Those quiet calls from home
So lost and so alone
We are just fine, as anyone would be
Four years we've waited for
The chance to make it back
Now we're all left for dead
As the choir starts to sing

So we'll find out what's inside
All that we have
It's all that we have
It's what we need to know
That what we've lost is all we had
It's all that we had
It's what we need to lose

And through it all still believe it's the truth
It's a quiet lie, a mistake I'm falling for
I'm holding on just to try to save this ship
And all you do is watch it slowly sink away

So we'll find out what's inside
All that we have
It's all that we have
It's what we need to know
That what we've lost is all we had
It's all that we had
It's what we need to lose

I'm holding on just to try to save this ship
And all you do is watch it slowly sink away
And by the light
Of the headlights you're behind
I can finally see my way
So cry our for the comfort
You've been finally stripped of
Don't try and pretend you were surprised

So we'll find out what's inside
All that we have
It's all that we have
It's what we need to know
That what we've lost is all we had
It's all that we had
It's what we have to lose
It's what we have to lose
