I dragged hands across the river
Quick before it's too late
Wade in
But I was just too late to save you
Quick before it's too late
With darkened eyes
We see we're falling in love
Now stuck in our homes we scream for air
In the cold of waiting to see what we become
Do we hold ourselves?
Or do we take a chance for once?
Now dry your eyes
They don't care
But we can pretend this once
Just make believe they love you

Now we almost believe
That we shouldn't be here
It's a fatal mistake
That only we could know of
In the cold
Of waiting to see what we become
Do we hold ourselves back?
Or do we take a chance?
Now dry you eyes
They don't care
But we can pretend this once
Just make believe they love you

You're falling to the ground
When we suck it up
Just lie there and pray for tomorrow
Well this can't be
Everything we've waited for
If it is we might as well be dead
So give it up, this is it
All your hopes and dreams are gone
Well I can't believe this is the end

Just wait in line, pray for forgiveness
You know we'll understand
Best friends forever
It's a crime, but what do I know?

We've all been waiting here for so long
Alone
It's been too long, you forgot
So give up all the things
You've lied to possess
(So fall in love, it follows you down)
We've been waiting for this all along
But it's too late to change
How you believe in us
(So fall in love, it follows you down)
We've been waiting for this all along
