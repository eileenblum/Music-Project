They're crying out for you
I'm kicking through the wounded
To force my heart to beat away from you
I know that they crawl around me
It has begun
The cracks have appeared on the surface
They're breaking down your walls
So will you fight or will you run for cover?
They're breaking in
They're breaking in so get out

They're crying out for you
I'm kicking through the wounded
To force my heart to beat away from you
I know that they crawl around me
I know they crawl around me
Cold fingers scratch
Against my perfect skin
They cry
They cry out

The things you said, they won't forget
The life you have, they want it back
So will you fight?
Or will you fall away
To let yourself go alone in this?
It seems that I've
Been trying to let you go
I knew you wouldn't stand
Fall away
