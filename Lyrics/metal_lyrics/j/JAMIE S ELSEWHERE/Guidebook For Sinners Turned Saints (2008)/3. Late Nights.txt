Say you won't
I'm okay
That I'll be yours for all time
And I see through your eyes
Like silent daggers thrown across the floor
Where do we go from here?

Relapse, don't let go
Don't let it fall away
We are so innocent for you
Why let this die?

Cigarettes burn out softly in the dark
It's funny how even you
Would stumble at the sight of it
You know you've done wrong
Who cares?

Relapse, don't let go
Don't let it fall away
We are so innocent for you
Why let this die away?

No, I could not explain
The way that you escaped
They won't believe me anyway
Say goodbye now love
Goodbye my sweetheart
Say goodbye now love
You spread your wings and escaped
This place from which you came from
You left us here
You waved goodbye as you speed away
towards the sky

No I won't let you down
They won't let you go
So run love, run

Relapse, don't let go
Don't let it fall away
We are so innocent for you
Why let this die away?
