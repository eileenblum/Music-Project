Just believe in anything
Just believe in everything you're told
Hold on
You've played this game with bad intentions
And all the same sick directions
From the choruses
We all believed in what they said

As the record slowly spins its last song
You start to cry
"We are nothing," it says
But you don't wonder why
It's a shame
That you never made it home
For the things that you left
Just won't seem to leave you alone

Now I won't let you feel alive
It's all you ask, it's far too much
So cry out aloud
If you feel that we're wrong about you
Are we wrong?

You call home
But it'll never be the same love
You could have had everything
Now all you do is live in shame
You're a guidebook for sinners
Turned to saints
Even alone
You can never be free of this place

No I won't let you feel alive
It's all you ask, it's far too much
So cry out aloud
If you feel that we're wrong about you
Are we wrong?

Now I will let you see
How they won't let you far from home
So cry out aloud
If you feel that we're wrong about you
Are you wrong?
