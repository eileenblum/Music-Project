When the rooms are filled with shadows
And the ghosts of yesterday are all that remain
You're still there
Just waiting for a touch
A feeling of acceptance
Holding on for anything
Now why did it have to be this way
It's your biggest fear
Because who are the saved
Without the saviors

As you cry yourself to sleep again
Before you drift away
You pray for love
Cause love is the only thing
You've never had

Now it's become apparent
That you're not the person that you say
You should have been careful
What you wished for
Was this worth it?

As you cry yourself to sleep again
Before you drift away
You pray for love
Cause love is the only thing
You've never had

Now enter our beloved, Juliet
Forging our mistakes across the stage
We play it out
Even though we know the ending
We've been acting this scene out
Again and again
Til the lights have outshined
The star you used to be

As you cry yourself to sleep again
Before you drift away
You pray for love
Cause love is the only thing
You've never had

You call it love
We call it a lie
We're both right this time
