This is our last song so listen up,
I'll only say this once.
You've gone too far. I've given up,
and it's too late to turn back now.
Cry in shame, you're just drunk.
So let me sober you up.

Watch me walk away.
You're falling deeper than you've been before.
You could never be the one for me
but now you're nothing at all.

Sidewalks and streetlights punching the pavement.
Thinking of all the things you've done to make things worse.
I can't believe it's true, that you're not giving in.

Quiet down, sober up, cry in vain.

Watch me walk away.
You're falling deeper than you've been before.
You could never be the one for me
but now you're nothing at all.

As sober as you are, you've falling down...

So cry out the tears from your lungs, and fall away from everything.

Watch me walk away.
You're falling deeper than you've been before.
You could never be the one for me
but now you're nothing at all.
