Oh wondrous, is this surrounding
Where gravity releases me
So that I may stay beneath

Ocean blue
Am I really what you seek?
Another nameless sailorâs ghost
Lost to the sea

Oh, what have I become
A prodigal son
A mouth without a word to say
A question begging for an answer?

Open my eyes
To see the crystal blue
In the depths
You were still there

Oh, what have I become
A prodigal son
A mouth without a word to say?
When all is said and done
Will I reap what I've sown?
