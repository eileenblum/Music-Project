Oh how I've wronged you, my love
Itâs come to another night
Filled with cold sweats
Lucid dreams in restless sleep
And, woe is me! Woe is me
For I've defanged the only wolves
That were ever on my side

I hear her voice saying
Leave it behind.

I left behind every trace of a coward
And moved towards the dreams
That were born of our fathers
Who told us the world is only
As flat as we've made it out to be
And, when the day breaks
The sun will transform us
Into something more than the lies
That become us
And, there is nothing I need more

Take aside. Tear apart
Conglomerate. Make new.
What is a wolf truly worth
Without its fangs
Who's hunted down by children
With sticks and crooked blades
And turned into a story
And a token for the few
That it slayed before it lost
The only weapons that it knew?

Oh how I've wronged you, my love
Itâs come to another night
Filled with cold sweats
Lucid dreams in restless sleep
