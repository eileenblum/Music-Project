Who ever told the sun to wake
And who ever told the moon
To clutch the sea?
Did the sun ever say back
Master I refuse to shine?
Did the moon ever refuse
To change the tides?

What does that say for me?

Have I ever found myself in your favor
Or was it just a temporary covering?
And, when the seas become calm
And the winds have all been settled
Will I still see your love?

Will it slowly fade away
Like candle light at dusk?
Or, will you be the lighthouse
On the hillside that
Guides our every move?

I'd love nothing more than
To pull up my roots and replant
Myself in much richer grounds
Shed the dead limbs and re-grow new

When it all fades
And darkness overcomes us
Will you still be there?

Will you still shine?
