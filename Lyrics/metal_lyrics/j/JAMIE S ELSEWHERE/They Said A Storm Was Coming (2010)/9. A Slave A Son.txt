When I continued to run away
What kept me in your hands?
Did you ever think your flock would stray
Or that they wouldn't understand
When you said, "Wait here
Til I return with your brother
That was lost to the ways of the world?
Catch me in your arms
Like stars in the eyes of telescopes
And, once there I rest
Never let me go. No!
Never let me go!
It was your love that said,

You're no longer a slave, but a son
What could I learn
By fighting the fires
With matches and gasoline?
Oh how cruel and melodramatic are we
For trying to make sense
Of all of this!

Just donât let me fall back
Through the clouds, to the ground
Catch me in your arms, like the stars
You hold in your hands
