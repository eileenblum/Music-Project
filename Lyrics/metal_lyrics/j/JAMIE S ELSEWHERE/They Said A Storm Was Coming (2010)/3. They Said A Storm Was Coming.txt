For one hundred days
We set sail without
As much as one distraction
But it seems that I have sank
Because of my past actions
And mistakes that I have made
And attempts to evade all
The consequences now
Being washed away

Washed awayâ¦
They said a storm was coming and
âYouâll be washed away!â
They said a storm was coming and
âYouâll be washed away!â
They said a storm was coming and
âYouâll be washed away!â
Washed away!

Maybe now Iâll be made clean
While I bathe in your seas
As I seek out all the dreams
That I once had
Of a life already lived
Of a gift already given
That was taken from me, taken from me far too soon

Halt! Where is your security now
When you begged for a lifeline
And were thrown an anchor instead?
And, has the smallest grain of
Sand traveled up the hourglass?
Or, has the sun ever set
In the east for you
Or any other man?

Face forward
Swim towards the surface
And look ahead to the life
On the new horizon
There was never any way
Of going back to the old world
With any sort of victory
Or good tidings of new discovery

Maybe now Iâll be made clean
While I bathe in your seas
As I seek out all the dreams
That I once had
Of a life already lived
Of a gift already given
That was taken from me, taken from me far too soon

Fortune never favored me
And the oceans were never big enough
To hold all of our iniquities
And secrets in its clear, blue embrace

I will ascend from the bottom
To be born again
