Get back to the center
Where it all began
The struggles of a burdened man
Who clung to violence
And transgressed
Against the few who stayed
The few that remained
The few he didn't abandon
Or push away as he left his home
In search of foolâs gold.
He went west but longed for the east
And he waged wars but he longed
For the peace that never made
Its way to ease his troubled heart

I hope they all can see through
The changing of the seasons
We all, we all blossom in spring
And wither in winter (in winter)

When the fall strips you
Of all your color
What will you say as the cold
Eats its way through your bones?
When the ice covers you completely
Completely drained of all hope

I hope they all can see through
The changing of the seasons
We all, we all blossom in spring
And wither in winter

As God as my witness I will survive
To see the sun again
And, wait for its light
To bring its life back to my limbs (my limbs, my limbs)

I pray they all, see through the barren trees
And the lifeless shapes that once were forests
Once the life returns to their eyes

I hope they all can see through
The changing of the seasons
We all, we all blossom in spring
And wither in winter

As God as my witness, I will see the sun!
