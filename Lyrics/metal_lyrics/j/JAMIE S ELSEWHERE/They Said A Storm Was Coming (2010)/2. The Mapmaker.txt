Listen, to the sound
The sound of an angry ocean below
And, look above
The skies open up
The waves begin to groan
They say, itâs nothing personal
Itâs what's been decided for you
It is what has to be.
It is what has to be.

If you aren't so easily swayed
I'll make my peace and sink beneath the waves
Until it all fades away
To hues and shades of blues and grays

In this cold
Frigid and oh so lonely
I'm slowly moving toward
The center of a hostile world
Unexplored and in need of
More men like me to uncover
What lies at its ends

If you aren't so easily swayed
I'll make my peace and sink beneath the waves
Until it all fades away
To hues and shades of blues and grays

All I ever needed was one more day
I feel so disconnected
So strangely warm
So strangely calm
Calm...

If you aren't so easily swayed
I'll make my peace and sink beneath the waves
Until it all fades away
To hues and shades of blues and grays

It's what's been decided for you!
It's what's been decided for you!
