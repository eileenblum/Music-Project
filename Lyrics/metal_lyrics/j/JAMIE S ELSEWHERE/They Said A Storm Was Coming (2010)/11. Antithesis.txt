This place is all too familiar!
So sudden, I find myself
Returning to the origin
The event that started it all
All I ever asked for was one more day
Is this it? Is this what Iâm after?

â¦Back to the beginning
Where I was sinking in the sea
Where I was fighting to stay awake
Fighting the urge
To succumb to the waves

Is this what it means to be forgiven
Undeserved blessings
And a second chance
That makes time shake
And that makes lives change
When itâs only been a second
In an everlasting day?

No, this can't be!
Everythingâs repeating!
Repeating as it already was
Written in history's page
And its ink has never been
Drawn back into its pen

I never wanted what
I couldn't pay back
Canât pay back

Let me sink to the bottom
Where I belonged all along
Let me sleep beneath.
