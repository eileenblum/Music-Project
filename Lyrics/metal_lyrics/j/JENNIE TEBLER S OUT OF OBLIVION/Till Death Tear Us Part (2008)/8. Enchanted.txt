I am here on top of the mountain
I am lying down on the grassy hill
Listening to the wind blow
Through the birches' leaves
Hearing the bird song
Giving me chills

Please stop that clock from ticking
Put an end to this unit of time
I'm bewitched by the spell of love-
Making this world all mine
I know I can't change my destiny
But this is the place I feel free

All his beauty embraces me
Can't believe this is for real
Never will forget that feeling
That total presence of mind
Even though I'd be leavening
I keep the memory for all time

Please stop that clock from ticking
Put an end to this unit of time
I'm bewitched by the spell of love-
Making this world all mine
I know I can't change my destiny
But this is the place I feel free
