I always had that demon in my head
Telling me what to do better instead
Things I do are never ever good enough
The demon wants to make the final touch

I never knew why she came to me
She's always there I'm never free
Don't understand what she gets out of this
The only thing she makes me feel sick

Please listen to my heart and my soul
Please understand I need to grow old
Don't take my life away from me my life from me

My hope of getting out is all gone
Since I do understand that I am all alone
I need that terrorizing bitch to stay alive
Without her calls I probably would die

My hope of getting out is all gone
Since I do understand that I am all alone
I need that terrorizing bitch to stay alive
Without her calls I probably would die

The day she came I was a young girl
She came and ruined my world
She eats me up from within
That pain is a sin

One day I'll kill that demon
That will be the day you can't wake me up
My eyes forever shut

Please listen to my heart and my soul
Please understand I need to grow old
Don't take my life away from me my life from me

My hope of getting out is all gone
Since I do understand that I am all alone
I need that terrorizing bitch to stay alive
Without her calls I probably would die
