You ware me out
You let me down
You ware me out
You push me around

Every time I need you
You don't hear me
Every time I need you
You don't see me

Let me be
Set me free
Forgive me
Release me

My life is cold
My soul is frozen
My life is cold
My heart is broken

I should go away
My strength is drained
I should go away
All efforts in vain

Let me be
Set me free
Forgive me
Release me
