I have this thorn in my side
It's stuck there I can't get it out
All my feelings I try to hide
But within I just scream and shout
There's just the fact that
You didn't love me at all
It's just the truth that
You wouldn't care if I fall

All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
All I ever wanted was to be seen by you
Your true deep emotion you never revealed
I just wanted to be loved by you I plead

Blood is no warranty for love
No matter what I cannot win
Born with it that's all
Your daughter a pure sin
Mmm... you're the queen of ice
Ah... you're the queen of ice

All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
All I ever wanted was to be seen by you
Your true deep emotion you never revealed
I just wanted to be loved by you I plead

I wonder what went wrong
Spreading anxiety around you
How come you're not that strong
Showing weakness is all you ever do
Mmm... showing weakness is all you ever do

All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
All I ever wanted was to be seen by you
Your true deep emotion you never revealed
I just wanted to be loved by you I plead

All I ever wanted was to be loved by you
All I ever wanted was to be seen by you
Your true deep emotion you never revealed
I just wanted to be loved by you I plead
