I still remember that day in the kitchen
Late night dark and we were wishing
Please take care of us we're not able
The four of us around the kitchen table

He was playing with us did what he could
Trying to be mother father doing what he should
It wasn't easy he was only thirteen
Given that responsibility that was really mean

Can you hear my song from where you are
Can you hear me play your guitar
Do you know how much I miss you still
I never stop crying and I never will

No wonder he fled left us behind
Even only mentally he left us with his mind
We wanted him back tried to get him to stay
He lived another life and did it his own way

Can you hear my song from where you are
Can you hear me play your guitar
Do you know how much I miss you still
I never stop crying and I never will

Now when he's gone he's always here
I feel his presence he's always near
Even though he's actually gone
He'll now never ever going to be alone
Oh no never be alone
