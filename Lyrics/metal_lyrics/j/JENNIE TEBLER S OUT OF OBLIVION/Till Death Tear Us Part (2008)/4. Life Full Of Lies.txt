You make me feel sick
Your words mean nothing
Your face makes me tick
I want to kill you or something

You're not worthy
You're scum and dirt
Repulsive demon surely
I promise this will hurt

It's time to crush that mirror
It's time to cut out my eyes
I can't control myself
I live a life full of lies
Why did you do this to me
Your treatment hurt me you see
You took my right to feel safe
My black hole my comfort space

I need to leave now
I need to go away
Rescue my life somehow
My soul cannot stay

It's time to crush that mirror
It's time to cut out my eyes
I can't control myself
I live a life full of lies
Why did you do this to me
Your treatment hurt me you see
You took my right to feel safe
My black hole my comfort space

What in this world made her into this bitch
Who might have hurt her making her into this witch
She has no emotion feeding off pain
You cannot help her your effort's all in vain

It's time to crush that mirror
It's time to cut out my eyes
I can't control myself
I live a life full of lies
Why did you do this to me
Your treatment hurt me you see
You took my right to feel safe
My black hole my comfort space
