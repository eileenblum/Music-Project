Somewhere between life and death I am
Living like hollowed statue I am
Nothing seems to matter I don't care
It's just a face to live through my prayer

Days without sunlight starless night
Crying without tears on endless fight
Hatred consumes my destiny
Anger - my life's philosophy

You are nothing to me
You are painful to me
I don't want you in this life
I just wish that you would die

A demon that turned my life upside down
A queen with a big anxiety crown
A cheating, lying, worthless whore
Your treatment made me into Jane Doe

You are nothing to me
You are painful to me
I don't want you in this life
I just wish that you would die
