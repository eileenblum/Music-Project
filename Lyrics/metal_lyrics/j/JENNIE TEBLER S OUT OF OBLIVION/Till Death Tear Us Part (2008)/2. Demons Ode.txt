Read my thoughts since I can't tell you what I'm thinking
I'm so sorry for this situation
Look into my eyes and see my soul break into pieces
I don't know my destination

I haven't asked for this I got struck by lightning
Don't know this sphere
I got scared
My fear of this is frightening
Please help me
Everything is just a nightmare nor than a bad dream
I really want to get out of here
The day everything happened my guard was down
My soul was paralyzed
I swirled away through sundown
Please help me
Everything is just a nightmare nor than a bad dream
I really want to get out of here

Oh can't stand this any longer
The devil controlling my head
The demons ode is getting stronger
I wish I was dead
What if I don't care
Let everything slip away
Never to wake up again
Left for dreamland to stay

I can't do this any longer my life going down the drain
You don't see me
My forbidden thoughts are getting stronger
Feel only pain pain
Please just leave me

I haven't asked....
Oh can't stand this....
I haven't asked....
Oh can't stand this....
