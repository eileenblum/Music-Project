You need to get out
Please look the door
All he does is shout
Treat you like a whore
Be aware he's gonna kill you

Being suicidal is a good start
Things can only get better
Leave your broken heart
Tear up your suicide letter

He's all about greed
Owning you for pleasure
Loves to hear you plead
Having you to torture
One day you bleed
He's gonna kill you

Being suicidal is a good start
Things can only get better
Leave your broken heart
Tear up your suicide letter

Being suicidal is a good start
Broken heart
Torn apart
A brand new start
Tear up your suicide letter
