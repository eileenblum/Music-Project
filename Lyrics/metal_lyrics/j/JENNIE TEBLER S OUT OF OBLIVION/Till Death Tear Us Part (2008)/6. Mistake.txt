Blinded eyes weakened heart tortured soul ripped
Apart doubtful mind clouded veins should been
Home too fucking late all alone feel only hate mad
At myself shouldn't been there a loathsome place
Should have been here

Hoping to get me what a mistake wanted to take
Me what a mistake trying to rape me what a
Mistake he misjudged me what a mistake

Evil thoughts limbs in strain never forget the
Demon's power he will abuse you during late hour
Stuck in darkness can't get out held by fear scream
And shout try to forget ignore the pain need to
Forget all in vain you must forget to stay alive

It all went fast a kick to his head a glimpse of the
Past I think he is dead wouldn't shut up made me
Insane couldn't give up I'm not to one blame

Hoping to get me what a mistake wanted to take
Me what a mistake trying to rape me what a
Mistake he misjudged me what a mistake

Mental pain I spit in his face want him to bleed
His soul erased need him to feel taste my disgust
Never to heal die for his lust waking up all is black
Taste of blood in your mouth soil in your eyes
You're underground try to forget ignore the pain

Blinded eyes weakened heart tortured soul ripped
Apart doubtful mind clouded veins evil thoughts
Limbs in strain

Hoping to get me what a mistake wanted to take
Me what a mistake trying to rape me what a
Mistake he misjudged me what a mistake
