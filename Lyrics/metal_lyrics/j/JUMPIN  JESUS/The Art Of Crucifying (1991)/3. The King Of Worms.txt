Carry me away
Right out of this nightmare
Am I really dreaming
Or maybe on drugs
No don't tell me
Don't tell me it's real... aaaaaarrrrgggghhh!

Disillusioned minds
Revelation bruns
Face this land's decline
Face the king of worms

Conflict is the law
Pressure point of souls
Negative parades
In the social mold

Suffer!
Die!

Dead and dumb and blind
Nothing left to learn
Rotting in our slime
Hail the king of worms

Here is where we dwell
Crawling in disgust
Wrenches in our hell
Suffocate lust
High above the towers
Ugly, fat and mad
Braindead he devours
All the things we had

Curse that damned election
When he took the throne
And our twilight future
Scares us to the bone

Do we lie destroyed
History's wheel will turn
While we race towards ruin
Fuck you, king of worms!

Do you wanna take the place
Of the chancellor
Of the federal republic of Germany?

Eets

Day by day
Dangerous
Merciless
Out for prey
In our street
