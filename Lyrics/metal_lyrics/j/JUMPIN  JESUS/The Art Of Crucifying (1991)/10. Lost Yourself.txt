Frantic influence
Comes out of darkness
Do you remember
Who you are?

Lost the eternal night
That lead your way through life
Believing in prohability
That all other meanings lead you nearer to your aim
Real profanity wins another game
The trial
Which is twisting your mind
Has fulfilled its sence

It is a model a hap
A misusafe of all harrasment
A tool of levity

Distrain your soul
If you cannot control yourself
Dive into the mud
You realize it's the wrong trail
If you don't want to be
The leader of heresy

Perform your duty
Your soul is free now
Search confirmations
You've hot them somehow

Apprehensions
About weird fancy
Will rotate you
Slowly for sure

Inventing alternatives
To hide your helplessness
Instead of hiding
Behind your mask
Recede of being selfconscious
Denying the way to yourself
Trust in immortality

Eyes glance at the sky
No difference between you an me
You will burn and die

Disharmonic sentences
Lunatic's intrigues
A castle full of submissions
A tower of bad lies

Inborn greed
That slowly will kill your race
Religion just excuses
Our inability
To fill
