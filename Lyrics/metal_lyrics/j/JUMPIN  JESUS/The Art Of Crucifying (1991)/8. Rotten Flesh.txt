Sitting between painted lines
And you hum spells from long ago
Summoning demons from beyond
To ensure life will never end
Candles shine blackened light
Kill the woman you possess
Rise your blade, blood flows through your hands
You're a pa rt of this evil plans

Caught in the satanic maze
You sold your soul for decay
So now the treaty's fulfilled
Your rotten flesh living still

Fooled since you began
You'll live forever now
Thousand years dmaned to walk this earth
While your flesh will decay
Pray for death, calls remain unheard
And you'll serve satan forever
You brought two souls for one
You've played with a force so strong - go to hell!

Caught in the satanic maze
You sold your soul for decay
So now the treaty's fulfilled
Your rotten flesh living still

Caught in the satanic maze
You sold your soul for decay
So now the treaty's fulfilled
Your rotten flesh living still

Are useless like your kind when I come to life
