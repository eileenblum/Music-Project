Lights are dim today
And I'm sitting, waiting
Padded cells are small
Where memories are fading
No one cares for me
I got my injections
And I feel the pain
But can't show reactions

I'm locked in
For reasons I can't see
Just calmed down
By shock therapy
And they said
That I don't fit in
But one day
I'm sure I'll win

"You are dangerous!"
They said and they grabbed me
Locked me in this cage
Betrayed and backstabbed me
'Cos I live my life
Make my own decisions
Got my points of view
My law and religion

I'm locked in
For reasons I can't see
Just calmed down
By shock therapy
And they said
That I don't fit in
But one day
I'm sure I'll win

Lights are dim today
And I'm sitting, waiting
Padded cells are small
Where memories are fading
No one cares for me
I got my injections
And I feel the pain
But can't show reactions
