One of us bellows signature
Delivering to the edge
The tribute must be paid
We're damned now, it's too late

Cracked ways of hell's degrees
Shall we return
Back to start it
As long as it is visible

Faith is lost, facetted puzzle
Faint fact, false name
Coldness arises, blood freezes
Where we are, pretence of the flair

Senile thoughts, listen the dirge
Disclosed intention
Hazy words cover reality
Misapplication of strength

Faith is lost, facetted puzzle
Faint fact, false name
Coldness arises, blood freezes
Where we are, pretence of the flair

Opinions split, the responsible ones revel
We must conquer the top
To prevent our downfall
Is this the sence of this game?

Compromise are found, victims are loches out
Real pact
Not the slightest chance
To undermine the important gain selfconsciousness

Denying the way to yourself
