A face the ultra-violence
Humanity's reducted
Feel the global suffering
Religion still misused

A lookalike of god
Mankind still shall be
But tell me why we're punished
By wars and poverty
What kind of god is this
Sending lies and pain
Looking down inactive
While lives go down the drain

Where is the balance?
The balance is lost!
Where are the real aims?
They're not worth the cost!

The clerical hypocrites
In every nation
Are selling religion
For mass consumation
They're cloning fanatics
By morals they teach
And don't even doubt
The stuff that they preach

Don't trust the preacher!

Can't be that somehow
God has been replaced
By idols of our inborn greed
That slowly kill our race
Religion just excuses
Our inability
To fill our lives with sense
And responsibility

Where is my brother?
He died in some war!
So god can you tell me
What living is for!
