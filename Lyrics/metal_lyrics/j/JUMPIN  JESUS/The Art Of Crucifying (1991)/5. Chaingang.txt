Here we are
Stalk the streets
Day by day
Dangerous
Merciless
Out for prey
In our street
We are law
So obey
Take your bucks
Take your wife
No espace

Hello,
Victims
Give us all you've got
We rape
We kill
We don't give a fuck

So watch out
Where you go
What you say
We're the damned
We're the lost
We're decay
We don't care
'Bout your screams
You'll submit
Beg and bow
Or we'll beat
You to shit

Shake with fear
When we're near
You can't hide
Bow or die

Hello,
Victims
Give us all you've got
We rape
We kill
We don't give a fuck

Gangland's law - obey!
