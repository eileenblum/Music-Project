Now I see now itâs clear now I know Iâve seen true power
Spare yourself prepare yourself for the coming of the doomsday hour

When youâll look at your hands youâll see theyâre swallowed by decay
No rain will come down to wash your pitiful sins away
I guess that deep inside you knew this horrid truth
Every little seed of evil becomes a part of you

Youâre just a pawn one of the flies
Youâll never see true paradise
When fate reveals all of your lies
Donât you think itâs time to demonize
See you pray no need to pray Iâm a demon in every way
Stay away just keep away Iâm a demon in every way

Suicidal thoughts are constantly running trough your head
Canât say I blame you, I know you wish youâd be rather dead
But say my friend, maybe itâs not as bad as it looks
Perhaps itâs time to take your place among murderers and crooks

Realize what Iâve become a man of sin, the devilâs son
Light of heaven I wonât bare thereâs no place for me up there
But inside my heart I know heavenâs not where I should go
Iâd be happy to compromise so happy to demonize
Come on letâs demonize letâs demonize come on letâs demonize

I gotta be honest with you I never revealed the whole truth about myself
You see thereâs a part of me thatâs so fiendishly dark, it gives me the chills
You always said Iâve got the devilâs stare well I guess it just runs in the family
I hope that wonât make you think any less of me I mean weâre exactly the same
Forged in hell thatâs what we are forged in hell you knew it all along
I see you pray no need to pray Iâm a demon in every way
Stay away just keep away Iâm a demon in every way
