Hear your words collide truth becomes a lie
Can you see through the picture drawn in your heart
The only thing that's real is what you can feel
Take away all the dreams that are caging your mind
Your soul is trapped here trapped by your own fear

Overcome the darkness around you unleash the demon inside you
No walls are strong enough to keep you away from your destiny
Say farewell to all expectations learn to act without hesitation
Make sure that every step you take brings you closer to divinity

As we die our lives come full circle

Remember all that you went through keep in mind all the things that shape you
Reinvent your every single value and forge it in persistence
This world has no power over you no matter what they say to you
You are the only one who is in charge of your existence
What goes around comes around your soul is trapped here
