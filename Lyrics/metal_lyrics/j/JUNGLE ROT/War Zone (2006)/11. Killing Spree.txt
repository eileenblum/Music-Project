Flowing sea of blood
Carcass floating endlessly
Putrid stench of death
Melts within my brain

Take another life, endless screaming
Peel the skin as I consume your soul
Diminish a race, endless screaming
Evil is coming, can't run away

Hell! Something you cannot perceive
Pain! Bludgeoned bodies scream
Rotten! Bones to decay
Death! Not an easy task to achieve

On my killing spree...
