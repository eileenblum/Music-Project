Decapitated, but feel no pain
Reign of terror, Hell's the name
Will not die with no regrets
My spirit lives, return undead

Blood spills out from your neck
A twisted thought, a brutal fucking set
Blood will start to ooze
Now I leave you scarred and bruised

Still I breath, from severed neck
I love to kill, I die and hate
An evil power in a blackened night
Without a head, don't try to fight

Blood spills out from your neck
A twisted thought, a brutal fucking set
Blood will start to ooze
Now I leave you scarred and bruised
