Distant war, innocents, fall prey
Militant aggression, dismay
Remembering their martyrs
Armies fight for faith
Persecution for belief
Jihad lies in wait!

They gave their lives..

Battlefield, dust and blood, atone
Cruel sovereign, last monarch, dethroned
On a path of righteousness
Unbelievers fall
Denied equality of rights
Heed their prophets call

Remembering their martyrs
Armies fight for faith
Persecution for belief
Jihad lies in wait!

Suicidal terrorists
Give their lives to god
Civilians die by thousands
Spiritual facade

Remembering their martyrs
Armies fight for faith
Persecution for belief
Jihad lies in wait!

They gave their lives...
