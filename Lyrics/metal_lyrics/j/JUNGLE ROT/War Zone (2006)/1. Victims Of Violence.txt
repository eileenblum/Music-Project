Torn inside, from the pain, drowning you
A victim of violence, unwillingly
Staring death in the face
Trapped in a world you don't belong
Try to escape a helpless place
Fighting to out live filth and scum

Filled with hate, forming your insanity
Forced upon, unwanted brutality
Death is easy to face
When you are not shown right from wrong
Suffering in disgrace
Defending all life and pride your own

Brought into a life of hate
Everyone's the enemy
Your victim of this violence
Destroying all humanity

Brought into this life of hate
Where everyone's the enemy
Your victim of this violence
Destroying all humanity

Torn inside, from the pain, drowning you
A victim of the unexplained violence
