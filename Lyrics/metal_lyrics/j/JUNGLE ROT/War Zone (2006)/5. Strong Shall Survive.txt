Bodies of the week, lay in blood
Memories of the final night
Smell of rotting flesh fills the air
Victims of their final fight

Stepping on the bodies to avoid the mud
My victory gave me every right

Survivals of the fittest
Natures only law
Survival of the fittest
Strong shall survive!

Scars of the defeat, battle wounds
Blood stained hands will never be clean
Feel their crushing skulls beneath your feet
Destroying all before they retreat

Stepping on the bodies to avoid the mud
My victory gave me every right

Survival of the fittest
Natures only law
Survival of the fittest
Strong shall survive!

Listening to their cries of pain
Who will live and who will die
Their bloody bodies a disgrace
Only the strong shall survive

Death lingers in the air
Arousing your insanity
Cross me? Don't you dare!
Their time has come, they shall pay! Stomping them to the ground
Destroying all in the way
In blood they will drown
Their time has come they will pay!

Stepping on the bodies to avoid the mud
My victory gave me every right
