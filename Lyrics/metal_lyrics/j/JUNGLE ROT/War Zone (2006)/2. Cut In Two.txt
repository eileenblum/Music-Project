Staring hopelessly
Into the night, look for a fight
Hate burns through his veins
Fire in his eyes, fuels his rage
Bleeding from the heart
Soul will depart, send them to hell
Crushing bones with fists
Hear cries of pain, the time has come

Cut in two, layers of flesh
Cut in two, arms and legs
Cut in two, carcasses
You will be cut in two!

Blood red flowing streams
Flow from your veins, soul swept away
Burned carcasses scream in pain
Lying on the floor, die bloody gore
Satan echoes in your mind
Discussing means to kill, relief in bringing pain
No! There's no escape for you
There's nothing you can do
You will be cut in two!

Cut in two, layers of flesh
Cut in two, arms and legs
Cut in two, carcasses
You will be cut in two!
