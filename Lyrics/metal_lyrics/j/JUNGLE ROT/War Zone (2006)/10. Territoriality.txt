I awake, revenge I crave
Visions of you in a shallow grave
Thought you could hide all your lies
I bring you now to your final demise

Bury the thought, deep in my mind
The pain I create will be so divine
Don't try to run or try to hide
I hold in my hands your final ride

Tear open the evil inside
His own brain boils with temper
Kill them all wherever they may hide
Territoriality!

Gag your mouth so you can't scream
Look in my eyes you think I'm a dream
Cut the throat, I watch you choke
Pray to god cause your life's a joke

Feel the steel slice your throat
Looking down I watch you choke
Try to breath you start to twitch
Your life is mine, now I own you, bitch

Tear open the evil inside
His own brain boils with temper
Kill them all wherever they may hide
Territoriality!
