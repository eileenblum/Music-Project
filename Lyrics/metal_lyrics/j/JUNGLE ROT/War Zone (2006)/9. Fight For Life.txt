Slicing, ripping, tearing at your own flesh
Dissect, infect, your skin turns into mesh
Feeling no pain, you start to question why
Regroup, regret, realize not time to die

Abused, confused, wondering what could be next
You tried to die, your plan be laid to rest
Wanting to get rid of existing pain
Your failed attempt gives you another day

Fight for life, feel no pain
Rebuild your mind, restore your veins
Struggling, you fight to live through your disgrace
You fought your death before it was too late

Try to save, tried to revive
Now you fight just to stay alive
Want to stay one more day
Wipe the blood dripping from your face
Sickened mess, in distress
Open wounds on your face and chest
What you see, disbelief
Minds a wreck still filled with disease

Try to save, tried to revive
Now you fight just to stay alive
Want to stay one more day
Wipe the blood dripping from your face
Feel the hate, feel the rage
Now you fight to live through this day
Lives at stake if you break
Can't digest what you have just made

Fight for life, feel no pain
Rebuild your mind, restore your veins
Struggling, you fight to live through your disgrace
You fought your death before it was too late
