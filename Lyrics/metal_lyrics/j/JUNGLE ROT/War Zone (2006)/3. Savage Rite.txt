Deep in the jungle
Ancient tribes, they thrive
Flesh, they consume.. need to feed.
Archaic in their ways.. blood communion
Separate the flesh from the bone

Primitive deeds, untamed might
Ravenous urge, savage rites

Lust, for your form
Inhumane hunger
Flesh devoured.. voracious greed
The organs on display, there is no other way
The outlander must pay, absorb his soul this day!

Primitive deeds, untamed might
Ravenous urge, savage rites

Anthropophagy...
Man eating man!
Manifestation...
Man eating man!

Anthropophagy...
Man eating man!
Man digestation...
Man eating man!

Primitive deeds, untamed might
Ravenous urge, savage rites

Ignite the fire
Celebration feast
Flesh and viscera.. hang from trees
The organs on display, there is no other way
The outlander must pay, absorb his soul this day!
