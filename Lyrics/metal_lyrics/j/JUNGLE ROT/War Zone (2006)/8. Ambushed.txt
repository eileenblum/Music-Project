Forced into submission, die against their will
Skulls will decorate his wall, trophies from the kill
Held within tradition, selective twist of fate
Twisted, mangled, bloodied inside, there is no escape

Ambush! Enemy attack!
Bayonets stick in your back
Trenches starting to flood
With a soldiers blood

Stalking out your victims, make them yours to claim
Their skulls will decorate your wall, their lives you will take
Now your in position, moving into kill
Trashing, gutting, shredding the hide, drenched in, the blood, spilt

Ambush! Enemy attack!
Bayonets stick in your back
Trenches starting to flood
With a soldiers blood

Hunting, victims, behind disguise
Finish, the prey, without mistake
Slaughter, butcher, taking their pride
Ambushed, attack, leave them to die!
