We kill, we maim, destroy at the snap of a finger
No fear, no pain, turn earth to a burning cinder
The cost is great, wipe out all life
The earth will live, this fucking life
Whats man? Who Cares? The earth will live long after
It Spins, it floats, trampled on by a speck of dirt.
The univers it never ends
This fragile man creates his end
Man's life will end
Masters of Nature, I think not
Controller of planet, I think not
Killers of Nature, Humans shall pay
Ending forshadowed, we will pay.
