Suffer through your death
Because of the life you lead
Pain will be intense
You will never rest
Seas of fire and blood
See the millions dead below
Life torn from the flesh
Carcass just remains
Now the time has come
Ripping of your flesh
Sever bone from skin and meat
Tear your heart from your chest
Make you watch it beat
Screaming out in pain
They ignore all of your pleas
See the blood and guts
Can't ignore the turth
Demon souls arise
From the depths of hell below
Take part in the feast
Gorging on the pain
Now the time has come
Walking through the seas of fire
No more can you lie
Throne of hell before you now
Body starts to fry
Figure shows eternal death
Torment night and day
Demons come to torture you
Try to crawl away
The pain is intense
Can't stand putrid stench
Those who you have done wrong
Now have their revenge
You scream out in anguish
Quick death is your last wish
Rotting seas of fire and blood
See the millions dead below
Life torn from the flesh
Carcass just remains
Now the time has come.
