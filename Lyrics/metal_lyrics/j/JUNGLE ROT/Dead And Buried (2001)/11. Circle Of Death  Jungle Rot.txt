Barely escaping death, from the evil pwer
A circle of death around the fire
Chanting evil relgions all holding hands
Sacrificing animals
Religious demands
The stupid fools, playing the insane game
Flirting with evil death, with their own evil lust
Letting it all end, with ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Seven deadly spinning circles
About time
The evil spirtis now
Are here again
From the grave, come the dead
Hanging flesh falls from their rotting bodies
Bleeding eyes fall from the terrors below
A horror show, your past lives
Only who believes it can see
Believers of the afterlife
Don't betray, powers of existence
Or your soul will be lost in time
They come to see the world today
Their bodies betrayed circums them
Their souls float above their bodies
Watching their existing end.
