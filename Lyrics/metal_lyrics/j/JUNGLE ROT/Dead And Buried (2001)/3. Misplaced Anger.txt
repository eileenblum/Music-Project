You despise
My success
You hate me
Your own life
Is your own fault
Don't blame me
Misplaced Anger
Rots your soul
Hate swells
From within
Tiny flames
Grows Large
Engulfing All
Burn in Pain
Misplaced Anger
Rots us All
Brought up to see the worst in all
We will not see harmony held back because of our true thoughts
Corrupted souls battle will not ever be won
We will not see harmony to large ever to become one or color blind
Hate is what I have seen and felt
We will not see harmony dignity raped for who I am fuck you all!
