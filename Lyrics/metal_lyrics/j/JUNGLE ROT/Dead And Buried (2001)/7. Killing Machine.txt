Searching for the smell of death
Feel it in my bones
Searching for a head to take
Hunting all alone
Raping, killing, torture, excites my soul
Want to see the other side
Wear the face of fear
Want to feel my heart explode
Evil is near
I will be one of them
Can it be
Hatred will bury me
Misery
Swimming in pools of blood
All around I am with the dead
On the ground
Searching for the winds of death
Scorching me inside
Years of violent servitude
Ends in suicide
Now I finally met
Those I couldn't see
Hear the screams of pain
Now it's time to die.
