in your mind, thoughts confined, a mental bind
you will find, life unkind, back to the grind
rat in a trap, about to snap, no chance to shine
yours is mine, interwined, we are aligned

demoralized
demoralized

to the bone, for the throne, you're not alone
cry and moan, grunt and groan, nose to the stone
vacant of rights, out of sight, another clone
hold one's own, as a drone, life is postponed

demoralized
demoralized

stand up and fight
we must unite
it's a riot we must incite

stand up and fight
we must unite
motherfucker we'll show our might
and end our fucking plight

demoralized
demoralized
