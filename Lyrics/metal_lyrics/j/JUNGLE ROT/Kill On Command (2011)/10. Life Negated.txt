a birth, a death... and life goes on
fifst light, last breath, then all is gone
life negated, you can't escape
lying there, unaware, accept your fate

you run, you climb, secrets you keep
they lurk, they hide, the wounds burn deep
life negated and now sedate
so beware what's in there, lying in wait

no goals
future was so bright
no soul
slowly losing sight
control
must fight through your strife
black hole
consumes your life

must have, your fix, no compromise
no catch, no tricks, continous supply
life negated, won't get it straight
no more prayer, cannot bare, succumb to hate
