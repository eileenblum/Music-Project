established orders are clear
on the eve of attack
all that run are the enemy
our foe be given no slack
burn the village and pollute the well
viciously stabbed with bayonets
beat and clubbed with rifle butts
signatures carved into their chest

none of them survive
expendable lives
kill everyone you find

kill on command
kill on command
kill on command

innocents flee and hide
children, women and old men
massacre the whole damn family
never to be seen again
they arent human to us anyway
we need to wipe them out for good
help them out of heir misery
orders clearly misunderstood

kill on command
kill on command
kill on command
annihilation, with no aim
