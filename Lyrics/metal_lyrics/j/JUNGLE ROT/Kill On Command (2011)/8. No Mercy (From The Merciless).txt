innocence lost across the nation
sincerity you humans lack
your righteousness has been your flailing
your way of life we now attack

so inhumane, wde take no prisoners
kill with no shame, slaughter campaign

absolute force
with iron fist
expect no mercy
we're merciless

you might as well
just not exist
expect no mercy
we're merciless

achieve our balance by coercion
oppression of the meek and frail
it's time to rise up to the masses
decrepit foes they lie impaled

extermination
cleanse with fire

absolute force
with iron fist
expect no mercy
we're merciless

you might as well
just not exist
expect no mercy
we're merciless
