crawling up from the depths down below
infect those who dwel labove
dronwing in desperation and need
cesspit, trying to get out

suffering, people live in hunger
famine, inadequacy
poverty, you and old are dying
defect, this life it must be

when your path is laid for you

those born of contagion
stripped of self regard
those born of contagion
what went wrong

turn our head, from the low bottom line
look down on those who are poor
cruelty, people treated as swine
disdain, and life is unsure

self respect, is a thing of the past
morose, in body and mind
ominous, pray for death to come fast
mistake, from life I resign

those born of contagion
stripped of self regard
those born of contagion
where was god

we show no humanity
life of calamity
expose our iniquity
foul atrocities

when your path is laid for you

those born of contagion
stripped of self regard
those born of contagion
wait to die
