tested time and again
built to last, we are
crisis, yet we pull through
times been rough, thus far

our backs to the wall
yet we stand tall
conflicht, push comes to shove
struggle through it all

bad blood
cannot deny
bad blood
egos collide

beat down and left for dead
countless times before
abused by worthless fools
we've settled the score

time to declare war
mock us no more
cast out, push comes to shove
no longer ignored

bad blood
we defy
bad blood
expose your lies

bad blood
blackened eyes
bod blood oppose or die
