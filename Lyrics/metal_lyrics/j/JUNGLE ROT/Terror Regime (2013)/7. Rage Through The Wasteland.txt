Unleash the force of war
The urge for blood is strong
There is no return
For this forsaken world
Trophies of dismembered flesh
Vast collection of bones
Acrid stench of death
Fills the endless void

Fueled by pure rage
In the wasteland til my dying day
Never conquered
In the wasteland, you will be free!

Law is abandoned
Hostility reigns
Spreading our plague
The violence brigade
No remorse for our victims
As we rob them of their lives
Subconscious degrade
Mentally deranged

Remain insane
In the wasteland til my dying day
Never conquered
In the wasteland, you will be free!

Fueled by pure rage
In the wasteland til my dying day
Never conquered
In the wasteland, you will be free!
