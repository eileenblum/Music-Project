Mankind has sunk so low
Once again, dealt a deadly blow
Hardly fair, but all to real
Open wounds that never heal
Unaware of their fate
Hail of callous fuisillade
Piercing shrieks and helpless cries
A catastrophe had dawned

Savage, Monstrous, Vicious, Heartless
Inhuman atrocity, a day of utter chaos
Writhing, Pleading, Begging, Bleeding
No regard for human life, a day of utter chaos

Targeting the innocent
Calculated malcontent
The bullets fly, the children cry
Deprived of last goodbyes
Little bodies soaked in blood
Precious souls in youthful prime
Now we lay these loved ones to rest
way before their time

Savage, Monstrous, Vicious, Heartless
Inhuman atrocity, a day of utter chaos
Writhing, Pleading, Begging, Bleeding
No regard for human life, a day of utter chaos

Adolescent dreams
Drown in lurid screams
A beast with no remorse
Death has run its course

Savage, Monstrous, Vicious, Heartless
Inhuman atrocity, a day of utter chaos
Writhing, Pleading, Begging, Bleeding
No regard for human life, a day of utter chaos
