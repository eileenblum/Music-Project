Your numbers up you have to go
The system says "I told you so"
Stocked in a train like a truckload of cattle
Sent off to slaughter in a useless battle
Thousands of us sent off to die
Never really knowing why
Fuck the system they can have me
I don't need society
I don't need society

Before you know it you're in he corp
Grab your gear boy you're off to war
Stocked in a train like a truckload of cattle
Sent off to slaughter in a useless battle
Thousands of us sent off to die
Never really knowing why
Fuck the system they can have me
I don't need society
I don't need society

You were an apple pie clone living at home
Never straying to far from your phone
Now son make it through enemy lines
You must hurry there's not much time
Made it sir. They're gonna drop the bomb
No time to evacuate, they'll call our moms
Fuck the system, they can't have me
I don't need society
I don't need society
