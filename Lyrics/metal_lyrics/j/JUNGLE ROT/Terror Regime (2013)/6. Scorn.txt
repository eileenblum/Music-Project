Hiding behind the lies, our course unclear
There is no trust sometimes brethren we fear
Hallowed scars adorn, forlorn of all hope
Abandoned in woe, the end of my rope

Grinding my teeth and seething, no sane thought
Sympathy smothered by the hatred you taught
Toxin my veins, a guilty blood stain
Because of the pain, I have gone insane

There are a thousand words I`d like to say
All I seem to muster are my words of hate
I reap aggression.. Lost shallow soul
A loaded gun is how I lose control

I feel no pain and I shed no tears
I`m feeding off your screams of fear
I take your lives, no time to mourn
Equipped for murder, you feel my scorn

Standing against the tide, hatred inside
Will to live denied, my tears have all but dried
I can`t escape it, it keeps me alone
reject emotions, my heart has grown cold

I feel no pain and I shed no tears
I`m feeding off your screams of fear
I take your lives, no time to mourn
Equipped for murder, you feel my scorn
