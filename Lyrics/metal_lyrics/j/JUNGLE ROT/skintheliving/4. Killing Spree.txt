Flowing sea of blood
Carcass floating endlessly
Putrid stench of death
Melts withing my brain

Take another life, Endless screaming
Peel the skin, as I consume your soul
Dimminish a race, Endless screaming
Evil is coming, Can't run away

Hell - Something you cannot perceive
Pain - Bludgeoned bodies scream
Rotten - Bones decay
Death - Not an easy task to acheive
