Sounds of death , Through the night
Mutilated bodies, Can not fight
Faces torn, Bones to dust
Mind in tact, Will not die
Feel no sorrow, For my death
My body lies, So lifeless
Losing breathe, The air grows thin
Fingers clinch, Life in a ditch

Screaming, Screaming for life another dies
Bloody corpses in your eyes
Will I see the light of day
Buried, Buried alive inside your tomb
A tomb that smells of rotting fumes
Oh lord save me from my doom

Screaming, For another life
Bloody, Corpses in your eyes
