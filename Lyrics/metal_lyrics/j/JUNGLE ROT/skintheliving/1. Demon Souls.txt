Resting, in your cold blood at the end
Awaiting demon souls to attend
Rising is your soul, From within
Dragged into the endless pit of sin

Deceased, dethroned from life
Weeping the spirits cry

Life then death, And reborn again
A battle for your soulto try and win
Another hopeless victim cannot begin
Dragged into my endless pit of sin

satan, Lives today in your mind
Your thought decay

Wake up, No escape, See today
Hope and Pray

The elder, Lost the way
Blasphemy unholy
