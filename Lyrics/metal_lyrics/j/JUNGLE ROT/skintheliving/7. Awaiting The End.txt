Take my hand and follow me
The depths of hell you soon will see
Pain and torture I create
Now you enter, Your own mistake

Feel the fire, Watch you sweat
Chains around your fucking neck
Our future brings you misery
Remembering things that you can see

The depths below is hell
You're endlessly falling
Stand the test of time
Awaiting the end
