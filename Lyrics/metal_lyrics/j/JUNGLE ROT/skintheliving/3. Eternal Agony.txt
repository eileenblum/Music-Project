Death, Farther the pain
Pools of Gore, Lumps of Brain

Bleeding - From the neck
Blood - Hate and anger
Say - Your last farewell

Rip at your chest, Pull out your tongue
Tear off your limbs, Rip a bloody lung

Time is for dying, No time to repent
Sould will not return, Carcass to forment

World turns to dark
Taking your last breath
There's nothing left
There's nothing left

Return to the earth
A fossil in clay
Perished into byond
Eternal agony

World turns to dark
Taking your last breath
There's nothing left
Eternal agony
