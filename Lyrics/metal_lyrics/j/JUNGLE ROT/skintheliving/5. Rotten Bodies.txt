The preacher says dust to dust
In your life death is a must
Rotten bodies to the bone
Satan won't leave you the fuck alone

Never sure when we will go
Heaven, Hell a brand new show
As you sit there think you are so great
Remember death we all should take

Death for those who weep
Death is mass destruction
Death is for your soul
