you are dead
rotting skin
decaying skulls
are caving IN

taking one last look
blurred and bloody eyes
hallucinating things
beyond this life's demise

crying out
set me free
torturing
the inner me

burning soul
black with hate
searches for
one to taste
blood is flowing free
pouring over me
clawing at your eye
wishing you to die

empty
souls will die
forbidden fate
souls will die

Left for dead
bloody with a severed head
emotionless life
gasping for your
BREATH

feasting
your fears that eat your
skin

denying faith
evil comes and grabs
you by the face

crossed reality
sepetrating me
from my evil past
the pain will not last
