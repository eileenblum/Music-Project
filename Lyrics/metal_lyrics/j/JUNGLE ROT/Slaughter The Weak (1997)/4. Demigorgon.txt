fear she not and fear
fear ye not
the ruler ofthe
eternal thought
the best is yet to come
evil is in reach
once possessed a soul
evil never ceased

the demigorgon,
stealing your soul
he once had his own, he
wants to control

satan's rotting corpse
the smell of brutal death
release the children of god
and all the blood shed

the demigorgon,
stealing your soul
he once had his own, he
wants to control

endless
brutal torture
life
will not last

hatred fills his mind,
death to all mankind
feeling no remorse,
the brutal killing force
