virus
seeps into your brain
delusions
visions to hate
lesions
internal scars are eating
at your skin
scars
infest your soul and
then they kill again

time is taking over
you pray to god

enter a new world
of pain and fucking hate
slaves of torture
taking you away
bleeding eyes looking
to you for a cure
they're pain - they're bodies
continue to puke

airborn
spreading
infecting
millions
bleeding eyes
aching bodies
scream in horror

stop the killing
theres no cure
government testing
without warning
people pleading

save their soul
infectious
rapidly killing
welcome
to hell
hiding from the truth
evil you can see
banished from this
earth
bodies under siege

I pray
to god
my time
is here
