Blood running through
my veins
shot of dope to my brain
cracking down your
fucking spine
struggling through the
endless lie

never seems to look the
same
evil in his eyes
deceiving you soaked
with rage
butchering death

after death we will
awake
and arise from the
depths of hell
rotten zombies out for
blood
butchering and
mutilating bodies

psychotic
insane butchery
tasting
your blood from me

never seems to look the
same
evil in his eyes

deceiving you soaked
with rage
butchering death

evil that comes from
within
controlling you I live
on your sins

gaining strength from
all your lies
I can see through your
demise

I feed on violence
I hear your screaming
I see your death
through your eyes

I live hate
on violence you're
screaming

I'm insane in a rage
await to see how you
will die
I crave your blood the
innocent cry
I'll tell you things you
don't want to hear
when you think of me
you'll think of fear

I feed on violence
I hear your screaming
I see your death
through your eyes
I live hate
on violence you're
screaming

Blood running through
my veins
shot of dope to my brain
cracking down your
fucking spine
struggling through the
endless lie
