slowly dying
screaming pain
with your life you must
pay
bound by nails
ropes of thorn
blood for power
the weakened mourn

twisted thoughts of pain
travel through my brain

endless torture
screams of gore
flames to blacken
forever more
thoughts of death
and doom
live your life
in gloom

twisted thoughts of pain
travel through my brain

better to rule in HELL
then to serve in
heaven
pity the weak
deeper they fell
broken courage
trapped by fear
fading to black
the end is near

visions fading
my world grows thin
skin grows colder
as my body caves in
living in DARKNESS
the sea of flames
my soul carried
underground
your life I claim
