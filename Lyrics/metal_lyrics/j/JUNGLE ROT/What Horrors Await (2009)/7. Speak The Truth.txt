You've lied to me, your final lie
Not giving in, not gonna cry
You gain from me, I question "Why?"
I will laugh last, your end is night!

Spreading untruths, with forked tongue
For what you're done, you should be hung
Rampant distrust, no short supply
You fucking liar, I hope you die!

Speak the truth!
