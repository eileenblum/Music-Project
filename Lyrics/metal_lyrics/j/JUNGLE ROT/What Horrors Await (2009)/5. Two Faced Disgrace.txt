How was I supposed to know
That you are a lying snake
Just when I had turned my back
You were there wielding a knife

Two faced - two faced disgrace
Fucked up, spitting out lies

Seizing the chance to attack
Venomous, ravenous beast
You prey on souls of your own
You are a two faced disgrace

Tighten your death grip
Crushing their will away
Murder in cold blood
Squeezing their life away

Tighten your death grip
Clenching the warm soft neck
Murder in cold blood
Has never felt so good

Seizing the chance to attack
Venomous, ravenous beast
You prey on souls of your own
You are a two faced disgrace
