Going to die,
A black death
Come to see,
The candle mass
Torture here around the flames
A real vision of your dreams
Whisper an evil chant
Spirit searches after death

Bleeding eyes watching you
Watching you as you sleep
Circle of light
A vision from the past
The glory,
You seek
Is hidden in the mass
Black candle mass
A circle of light

The deadly sacrifice
A circle of fire
In the moon fucking light
A circle of death
Engulfed by flames
A circle of death

Your dying,
In your dreams
Black candle mass
