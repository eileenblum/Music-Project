Burning, it's in the air
Smoke of the machine
Gives you the notion to
Get lost or get dead

Plowing through the trees
Body spattered tank
Goring and maiming all
People in the way

Come on and stop me
A rolling death machine
You can't stop me
Structure of steel and blood

Hanging from the rusty chains
The parts of the dead
Swinging in the cool breeze
Dripping pools of blood

Rotting, pungent stench
Consumes every breath
Jagged drill bits and blades
Bring on the carnage

Come on and stop me
Psychotic murderer
You cannot stop me
I'm the unstoppable

You can't stop me
A rolling death machine
Come on and stop me
Psychotic murderer

You cannot stop me
I'm the unstoppable
