Flesh eating disease
Skin melting pain
An atrocity now to begin
Bubbling skin, when will it end

Hold out your hand
Pour on the chemicals
Feel the burning
Feel the pain

Spread on the table, torturous fools
Draw the acid bath, go in head first
Eyes are melting, all teeth fall out

Begging, pleading
Please god, make it stop
Felling the pain, till I die

There's nothing left, but death
I try to break free from my cage
They've got me chained down and gagged
The drops of acid rain down
As my mind begins to fade
Trapped in a subliminal hell
I will not be here for long
I'm gonna die, like them all

Hold out your hand
Pour on the chemicals
Feel the burning
Feel the pain
