Inside these walls, a padded cell
A sickened human, fully insane
Psychotic mind, breeds evil plans
To be carried out when the time comes

Fantasizing, looking, forward
Plans his next move, what will it be?

Paralyzed by his worn restraints
They show no mercy for the deranged
And as the brain nears dementia
A revelation of the wicked

Insanity, depravity
Confined to a... straight jacket life

Ten millions dead, horrible scene
Inside his mind, but he sees bliss
As the bombs drop and mortars fire
Delusions of perverse grandeur

Insanity, depravity
Confined to a... straight jacket life
