Take me lead and follow me to a special place
Heaven could not compare to this
Sorrowless, all that was lost is found again
The easy way, pharmaceutical bliss

Mind control for the masses
All humankind, self diagnosing their lives
Medicating all singular thought
Lead to believe there's a mental disorder you've caught

So you man up and admit your guilt
Addiction is nothing more than this
Sorrowful, all that was found is lost again
Withdrawal, now where's your bliss?

Slavery for the asses
All humankind - self medicating their minds
Individual thought is now dead
Not a single cell exists in your shell of a head

Dependency, that bitter little pill
But why argue with fate
Despondency, your resolve is killed
You become the person that you most hate

Thoughts dim, process slows
Your craving for sedation grows
Brain numb, feeling no pain
Bu still cant kick the shame
Loved ones have left yo now
You start to wonder how
What has become of me
My own worst enemy

Dependency, that bitter little pill
But why argue with fate
Despondency, your resolve is killed
You become the person that you most hate
