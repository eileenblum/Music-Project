Tempers flaring, tensions on the rise
Super powers cannot compromise
Treaties broken, powers misused
Chaos unfolds, all hell breaks loose

Declare! State of war!
Bombs drop from above
Shoot to kill, shoot to maim
State of war! This ain't no fucking game!

Politicians fuel war with lies
Across the ocean, not risking their lives
A war on paper is all they see
Cold blooded callous, and so cowardly

Declare! State of war!
Bombs drop from above
Shoot to kill, shoot to maim
State of war! This ain't no fucking game!

Declare! State of war!
Body count on the rise
Shoot to kill, shoot to maim
Killing in your government's name

On the front line
Killing time on the frontline
On the front line
Comrades die before your eyes
On the front line
Landmines doing bodily harm
On the front line
Shell shocked, mentally scarred

On the front line, before your eyes
Bodily harm, mentally scarred

Declare! State of war!
Body count on the rise
Shoot to kill, shoot to maim
Killing in your government's name
