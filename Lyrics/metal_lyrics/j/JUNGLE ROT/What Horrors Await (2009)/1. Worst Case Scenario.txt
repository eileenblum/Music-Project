Impact, earth cracked
Megacities attacked
Contrary to fact
Our enemies react
Counterattack
Our movements have been tracked
Exact, world sacked
Under legislative act

Nuclear winter now
Devastating consequence
The worst case scenario
Shade the earth from the sun

Globe seared, our sphere
The face of evil reared
Extinction, we're geared
Our vows will be adhered
Revered and feared
Your god can't interfere
Sterilized, world cleared
Living things have disappeared

Nuclear winter now
Devastating consequence
The worst case scenario
Shade the earth from the sun

Soot and smoke released
Into the stratosphere
Dust clouds block out the light
Plunged into eternal night
