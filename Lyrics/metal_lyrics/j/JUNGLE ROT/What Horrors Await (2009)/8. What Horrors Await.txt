Risen at dark you walk the night
Searching for blood is such a morbid sight
Moving swiftly to anticipate
Gather all their bodies where there lying
Then we wait...

Humanity falls
When the world gets it's wake up call
We've sealed our fate
What horrors await

Storm clouds swell in natures hell
Shedding the tears from above
Harvest moon glow with doom
Dead time, the right time
For all

Humanity falls
When the world gets it's wake up call
We've sealed our fate
What horrors await

Dead of night, time is right, do your dirty deeds
Stimulate, penetrate, plant your evil seed
Bodies they reek, fluids they leak, from the mass of decay
Necrophilia, just can't beat it, it's the only way

What horrors await

Humanity falls
When the world gets it's wake up call
We've sealed our fate
What horrors await
