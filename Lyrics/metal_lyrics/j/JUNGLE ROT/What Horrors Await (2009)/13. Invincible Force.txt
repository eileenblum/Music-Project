[Destruction cover]

I'm an invincible force of evil
My eternal hatred is destructive
There's no chance to survive
I incarnate the end of mankind

I'm in crest of human flesh
And I agonize in a pool of blood
Don't try to escape or resist
Cause Christ won't help you tonight

Invincible force
Invincible force

You break down in the morass
Turn and see them blood stained claws
Now I tear the shreds out of your face
Now you will curse your day of birth

You agonize in a pool of blood
You scream out and beg for mercy
Don't try to escape or resist
Cause Christ won't help you tonight
