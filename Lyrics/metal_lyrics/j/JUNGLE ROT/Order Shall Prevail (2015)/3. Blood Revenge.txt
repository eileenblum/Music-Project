Ritualized warfare
Insults to honor avenged with a knife 
Ancestral nightmare
Descendants slight must be paid for with life

Aeons of unspoken respected rules
Tribe is at fault by the acts of a fool
And yet he be guilty, but still they comply
Abide by the law of âan eye for an eyeâ

Harmonyâ¦ balance
Must be restored with the spilling of gore 
Vengeance galore
Remove the entrails and settle the score

The line is drawnâ¦ Hatred spawned 
Progeny endsâ¦ Blood revenge

Shortened life span
Wanton enslavement of neighboring clans

Without exception
All those who trespass they shall suffer death 
Paramount dominion
My victims souls forced to wander the earth 

Harmony, Balance
Vendetta, Blood revenge 

The line is drawnâ¦ Hatred spawned
Progeny endsâ¦ Blood revenge
