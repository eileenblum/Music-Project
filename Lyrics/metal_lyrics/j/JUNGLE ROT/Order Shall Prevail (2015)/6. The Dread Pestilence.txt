Fulfilled prophecy, symbolically
Madness in the streets, catastrophe
Beginning of the end, the consequence
Take all this for granted, lifeâs contempt
The sun now fades away, the day is gone
Each of us, for ourselves, on our own
Wasnât worth all this, the cold sets in
To curse my sanity, festering within

Darkness now consumes, the end draws near
Untold agony and suffering
Nothing left to give, ashes to dust
Soul withered away, corrode to rust
Nations go to war, anarchy reigns
Soldiers writhe in pain, all of them slain
Lifeless barren lands, nothing but flies
Dilapidated, a husk of earth now lies

The earth reborn
No time to mourn
Famine and death
No chance for heaven, the dread pestilence

Nothing left to fear, all hope is lost
The world is now engulfed in permafrost
The planet starts anew, but at what cost?
All life exhausts, genocidal holocaust

The earth reborn
No time to mourn
Famine and death
No chance for heaven, the dread pestilence
