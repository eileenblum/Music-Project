I try to hold on, despair runs amok
I believe its time for a change 
Need to break the chains of the wage slaves
Soon we must take charge
And still the labor force will toil
Big shots profit from their turmoil
No one thinks itâs strange?
Need to rearrange
Perverse to the core

Ignorance is bliss, facing the abyss
In the end we're all food for worms
Sucking like a leech, product of deceit
Bitter fruit to swallow
Portrayed as if they were so royal 
Values and morals have now spoiled
A world full of flaws and dogmatic laws 
We follow no more 

You sit on high 
Look down on me 
Feel in control 
Cast the first stone
You canât judge me
My wrath be known
You're overthrown 
I cast the first stone

You wont find me
Bowed down to you
Will not extol
Cast the first stone
Thou art no god 
Just one more clone
You're overthrown
I cast the first stone
