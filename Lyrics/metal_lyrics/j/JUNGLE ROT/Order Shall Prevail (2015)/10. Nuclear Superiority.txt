Sitting on a stockpile 
All at my command
Ample leverage to destroy
Your god forsaken land 
Strategic posturing to help deter
Aggression from our foes
Sophisticated lethality
Nuclear primacy grows

No peace and no one wins 
Nations on bended knee
Bow down to my
Nuclear Superiority

Rogue states and terrorists 
Provocateurs of war
Enemies of peace and hope
Globally deplored
Escalation dominance
Weapons are âlocked and goâ
Retaliatory strike confirmed 
The fucking final blow 

No peace and no one wins 
Nations on bended knee
Bow down to my
Nuclear Superiority

No peace and no one wins 
The world on bended knee
Bow down to my
Nuclear Superiority
