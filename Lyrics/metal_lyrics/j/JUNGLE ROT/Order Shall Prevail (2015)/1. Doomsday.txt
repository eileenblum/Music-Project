Of the human race I've had enough
Evolving for thousands of years and still no better
Turning on each other when times are tough
Pray for the madness of man to perish forever

It's safe to say that our ship has now sailed
Humanity has so hopelessly failed...

Fiery comets rain down from heavens unknown
Fissures and fault lines blossom and eat social order
Acid rain falls and melts all the flesh from your bone
Corpses lay seared, flesh from bodies will smolder

It's safe to say that our ship has now sailed
Humanity has so hopelessly failed...
Lead all to an end of sorrow and dismay
Hear my death prayer and bring forth our doomsday

Oceans are boiling
A torrent of flames from on high
O' Armageddon
The global disease nullified

I take great solace
In knowing you all die with me
Know no conscience
Extinction will set the world free

Anarchy Now the only way of life
Morality and virtues had once thrived
History of accomplishments lost in the fight
Incessant bloodbath from which no one survives

It's safe to say that our ship has now sailed
Humanity has so hopelessly failed...
Lead all to an end of sorrow and dismay
Hear my death prayer and bring forth our doomsday
