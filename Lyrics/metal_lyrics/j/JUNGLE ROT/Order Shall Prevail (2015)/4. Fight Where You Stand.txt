Intentions are clear, sleeper cells will revive
Threaten to destroy this land which we thrive
Call for a bloodbath played out on home soil
Aim to detach us from this mortal coil
Religious conversion is their demand
Declare submission or die by their hands

I am infidel, forever shall be
I will not be swayed by outdated beliefs
A doctrine that's outlined by decades of dread
Of suicide bombers and human warheads
Public beheadings, a call for payback
A blood-chilling omen, impending attack

Bring the war to our shore
Revered homeland
A wrathful legion
Under command
No room for cowards
Fight where you stand!

Hellfire rains down on our adversaries
Direct response to their ancient decree
We know the rhetoric, we've heard the alarms
We need no government to lead us to arms
The ranks are broken, like insects they swarm
Their assets weaken and losses are great
Commandos march under a banner of hate

Bring the war to our shore
Revered homeland
A wrathful legion
Under command
No room for cowards
Fight where you stand!
