Satan's rotting corpse.
The smell of brutal death
Release the children of god
And all the blood shed
Fear his evil heaven.
The evil hell your fear
Fear the next pope.
The next ant-christ

[Pre-chorus]
Rip off your face. Death in his eyes
A murderous state. He will arise

[Chorus]
The tomb of arminus
Dying spirits cry
Kill the unborn fetus
The spirit of the anti-christ

Dying spirits cry.
The evil thoughts of hell
His spirit is now laughing.
At an everlasting pain
Slowly a man dies with seizures.
Rips off his own face and tries to scream.
An everlasting death

[Pre-chorus &amp; chorus]
