Death. farther the plan
Pools of goar. lumps of brain

Bleeding - from the neck
Blood - hate and anger
Say - your last farewell

Rip at your chest. Pull out your tongue
Tear off your limbs. Rip a bloody lung

Time is for dying. No time to repent
Soul will not return. Carcass to forment

World turns to dark
Taking your last breath
There's nothing left
There's nothing left
[Repeat]

Return to the earth
A fossil in the clay
Perished into beyond
Eternal agony

World turns to black
Taking your last breath
There's nothing let
Eternal agony
