Invading force from the North,
Conquering from land and sea,
A twisted cross and twisted mind,
Follows ancient prophesy

Build the pyramid higher!
Human flesh takes place of stone
Build the pyramid higher!
A monument of blood and bone

Iron tanks thunder across the plains,
Tortured screams in the walls of flame,
Pages written in deeds of pain,
Hister reigns and rules again!

Endless pain and misery,
Demise now history,
From the ashes of dark renewal,
Hister reigns and rules!

Build the pyramid higher!
Human flesh takes place of stone
Build the pyramid higher!
A monument of blood and bone

Killing in mass quantities,
Rids the land of my enemies,
My laws rules all from birth,
There is no equality on Earth

Screams of torture agony,
Feeds my desire internally,
My law rules all from birth,
There is no equality on Earth
