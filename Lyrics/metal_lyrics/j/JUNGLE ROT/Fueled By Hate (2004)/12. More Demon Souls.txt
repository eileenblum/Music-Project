Resting in your cold blood in the end
Awaiting demon souls to attend
Rising is your soul from within
Dragged into an endless pit of sin
Diseased-dethroned from life
Weeping the spirits cry
Life and death reborn again
A battle for your soul to try and win
Another hopeless victim cannot begin
Dragged into my endless pit of sin
Satan lives within your mind
Your thought decay
Wake up
No escape
See today
Hope
Pray
The elder lost the way
Blasphemy
Unholy
