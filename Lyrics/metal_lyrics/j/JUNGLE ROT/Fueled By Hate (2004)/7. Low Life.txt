You are a low life and always will be
Reality you cannot see
In the gutter with vermin and diseased
You're such a mess don't look at me
Turn your head, I cannot look into your face
Shut your mouth before I put you in your place
Choices you have made
Put you in this state
Hopes and dreams
Are withering away
In the eyes of the world you are a low life
In the eyes of the world you are a low life
Ignore the truth
You cannot take the pain
You only have yourself to blame
When it comes to life you always lose the game
Trying to change but staying the same
In the eyes of the world you are a low life
Dark side of your soul is your only source of light
Ignorance is in your mind you cannot break
Your life has been a social mistake
Counting on no one except for myself
Everything in life I got with no help
You're hands are reached out
Want me to take hold
Because of you, my heart has grown cold
You're time has passed
Now accept your own fate
Want to start over, but it's too late
Bullet in the chamber
Please squeeze on the trigger
There is nothing left for you to configure
Ignorance in your mind you cannot break
Your life has been a social mistake
In the eyes of the world you are a low life
