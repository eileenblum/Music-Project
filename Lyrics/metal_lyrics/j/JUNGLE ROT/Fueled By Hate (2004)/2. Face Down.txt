To dig a hole in ground
Fresh soil
To bury you into earth
Shallow grave
You're gonna taste the mud
Face down
You're gonna taste the mud
Dead body
Beneath the soil your body rests
I think it's time to pay last respects
It's way to late to bring back the dead
Your time has come now, you're laid to rest
Now that I rid you from
Living here
Your souls must find a new
Place to live
You're gonna taste the mud
Face down
My plan to kill you, it was success
To mutilate you done with finesse
I know it's sad, but you had to go
Your weak existence was killing us
Lying face down in the mud
Left for dead, left to rot
No chance left for survival
Certain death coming fast
Face down
Beneath the soil your body rests
I think it's time to pay last respects
It's way to late to bring back the dead
Your time has come now, you're laid to rest
