Struggle to break the chains
Don't let yourself surrender
In spite they say your name
Our hate is their splendor

Are you as weak as they say?
Only time will give they answer
Take life day by day
For I am my own master

Rise up and fight
To take control of your life
What you see
This could be
For the key
Is you

Struggle to break the chains
Don't let yourself surrender
Our strength is in our numbers
We will take them over

Our force will not be conquered
Only we have the power

Rise up and fight
To take control of your life
What you see
This could be
For the key
Is you
