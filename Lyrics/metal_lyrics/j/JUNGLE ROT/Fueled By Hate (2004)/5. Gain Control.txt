Born into this life is their defense
Living their lives with no regrets
Before my time will pass
Resistance will not last
Now the world will feel my wrath
Innocence, their weapon of choice
Cut thoughts will never have a voice
A youth confused
Defy the way of our lives worthless
They deserve to die
Their minds
Destroy
Their minds
A ploy
Underground will arise
Aee the fear in their eyes
I will not let them gain control
I will not let them gain control
I will not let them gain control
