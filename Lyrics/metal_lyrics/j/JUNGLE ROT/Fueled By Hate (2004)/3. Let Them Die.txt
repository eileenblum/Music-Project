I can tell you cannot wait to die from the
way you live your life
But all the damage
Has been done by the blade of your knife
Everyday you're breathing
The scars you
Left me burn every night
I don't hate - I loathe you
Your eyes will never see the light
I let them die
I do not care
Your web of lies has killed you
To them you
Are now a slave
If you decide to die, I will
Walk on your grave
Have you lost it all?
Nothing in your life left to save?
Were the
Times I have tried to help you done in vain
Never will you amount to anything again
You broke your neck with a rope of your hate
I've bled, I've scarred
You won't let your old cuts heal
I have moved on
Soon you will be forgotten
I let them die
I don't care
