When the pain starts to hurt
The fire inside starts to burn
Now without self-control
Look down deep in your soul
Tainted black from your hate
The future you can't escape
Slithering in the filth
Everday is the same
Feel the rope, nice and tight
No is no one left to blame
Tie the rope, around your neck
Mind insane, life's a wreck
Reach the point of no return
A painful death is no concern
Sadness grows in your mind
No way out, wait to die
Slithering in the filth
Everday is the same
Feel the rope, nice and tight
There is no one left to blame
Gasping for air... is this life or death?
Gasping for air... take in your last breath
Gasping for air... you will not survive
Gasping for air... maybe your souls will thrive
Slithering in the filth
Everday is the same
Feel the rope, nice and tight
There is no one left to blame
Feel your eyes turning red
Feel the pain in your face
What awaits at the end?
Now your mind starts to race
Flames below burning high
Feel your life melt away
Hanging high on your rope
Only your self to blame
Gasping for air... is this life or death?
Gasping for air... take in your last breath
Gasping for air... you will not survive
Gasping for air... maybe your souls will thrive
