Isolated by the enemies
Our great cities are under siege
Now thrown deep into a state of decay
Desolation falls upon this realm

Imposition of depravity
Great oppression falling over this earth
Employing their will to dominate
Persecution of the human race

Empower yourself, decide from your alien outcome
Failures of man, rising of them
The sun hasn't moved, blackening the skies above you
Extinguishing race, failure of all
Burn through your towering drone
Shaking from dissecting the throne
Watching the sun dissipate
The dawn of a new age awaits

The enthrallment of our people
Suppressed by this uprising
Emergence of the rebellion

Empower yourself, decide from your alien outcome
Failures of man, rising of them
The sun hasn't moved, blackening the skies above you
Extinguishing race, failure of all
Burn through your towering drone
Shaking from dissecting the throne
Watching the sun dissipate
The dawn of a new age awaits

Imposition of depravity
Great oppression falling over this earth
Employing their will to dominate
Persecution of the human race
