Convoking of mankind
Bring forth deputed ones
Convey our amity
Anticipate deference

Precipitance of the inquirers
Staggered earthly bipeds step forth
Shivering in the blinding light
Converge before all

Approaching with peaceful offerings
Arms open accepting this dream
These bright skies losing radiance
Now blackened clouds haunting above
Becoming devoured deep in shadows 
Bodies disappear in rapidly fading light
Surrounded by this darkness now our nightmare begins

Atrocity in transgression 
Now without hope to retain order

Wave of destruction
Sweeping across land
Diplomacy denied
Accept destiny

These bright skies losing radiance
Now blackened clouds haunting above
Surrounded by this darkness now our nightmare begins
Failing the Earth prolong this decline
Will this night ever end

Atrocity in transgression 
Now without hope to retain order

In this night that never ends
We shall now fall
Beginning of our end
