Gathering in the night with uncertainty of the unfamiliar
Images of the gods rise out from solitude
Their illuminating presence pierces through the dark
Before the eyes of disbelievers heavenly prophecies unfold
Dawn nears and hopes become reality
Our saviors come forth to free us

Undisclosed spirits move in the void
Now skylight appears and the night fades
As the sun rises above the horizon
The nameless figures become clear as day

Marching forth through the perilous light
Gazed upon by the inquisitive ones
While others take shelter in fear of life
Can this be the salvation we seek
Or just more hopeless delusions
Some trust as others await validation

Before the eyes of disbelievers heavenly prophecies unfold
Dawn nears and hopes become reality
Our saviors come forth to free us
Images of the gods rise out from solitude
Their illuminating presence pierces through the dark
