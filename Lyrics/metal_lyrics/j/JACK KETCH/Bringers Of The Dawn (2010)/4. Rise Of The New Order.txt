Poised for battle
Somber rain soaks this Earth
Armored beasts standing tall
Assembling in formation

Prepared to raid
Marching into existence
Penerate our realm
Set forth to conquer all

Primed to destroy
Lending their arms as instruments Of our death
Crushing all in their path with constant waves

Patrons of rage
Divulging their genocide
Eradicate the frail
Unrelenting brutality

Brace for the shift of power among man
Fall under the vengeance of our visitors

Brace for the shift of power among man
Fall under the vengeance of our visitors
Time has now come for the change of our worlds reign
