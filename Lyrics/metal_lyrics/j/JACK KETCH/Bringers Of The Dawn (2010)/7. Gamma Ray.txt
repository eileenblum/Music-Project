Global chaos now unveiling
Nearly all the world has found itself undone
Human blood flows throughout our streets
Impetuous rain colors the rives red

Destruction is imminent
An end to this war must be found
United in turmoil people of this world rise as one
To create a device of irrefutable power and devastation

Constructing a machine of the gods
With the force to collapse the heavens
Fear the great furnace of the sun
Earth radiates within it's divine light

Trembling of this earth
People take shelter underground
Abandoning of their cities
The feeble shall be left behind to perish

Constructing a machine of the gods
With the force to collapse the heavens
Fear the great furnace of the sun
Earth radiates within it's divine light

Blood of innocents will shed profusely
Bodies Withering languished on the ground

Harnessing the suns rays to release among them all

Global chaos now unveiling
Nearly all the world has found itself undone
Human blood flows throughout our streets
Impetuous rain colors the rivers red

Annihilating our adversaries
Charred corpses extend across this scorched world
Leaving this earth unfit for this life
