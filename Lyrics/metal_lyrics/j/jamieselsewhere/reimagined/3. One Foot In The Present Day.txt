For so long I have waited
For this sense of urgency
For as long as I can remember
I've always been the type
Of person to just give in

I want to run just as fast I came in
I want to have the chance
To flee the scene
And to find peace
Oh, itâs so hard to find relief
For this excess sensitivity
To the crimes that have been
Committed against others, not only me

How long must I wait
Until Iâm at peace again?
And how long must I wait
Until I am whole again?
And how long must I wait
Until I am at peace again?
And how long must I wait
To see your face again?

I've got one foot in the present day
And one foot in the grave
One foot in the present day
And one foot in the grave
One foot in the present day
And one foot in the grave

But, itâs your grace that gives us
The second chances that we don't deserve
And that we take for granted
But, itâs your grace that gives us
The second chances that we don't deserve
And that we take for granted

And how long must I wait
Until Iâm at peace again?
And how long must I wait
Til I am whole again?
And how long must I wait
Until Iâm at peace again?
And how long must I wait
To see your face again?
To see your face again
To see your face again
To see your face again
To see your face, again
