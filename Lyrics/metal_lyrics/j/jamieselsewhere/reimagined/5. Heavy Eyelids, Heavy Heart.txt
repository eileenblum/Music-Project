I fell asleep beneath a tree
The one I sat underneath while I spent my day dreaming
Of open windows, and open doors, of the chance to run away
But I think I've grown enough to know there's only so
Between what you think and what you know
What you see and what you don't

Everyone step outside
And scream with the love we felt since we were children
Too often we bury our hearts in treasure chests
And throw away the keys

I once felt that it was all perfect
And that dreams had all become real
The feelings of fear and loss
Had all been stripped away, and cast aside
I've been afraid to lighten my heavy heart
'Cause maybe no one would understand,
And maybe I'll never understand
But I'm shedding my skin

So everyone can step inside
And see the love I've felt since I was a child
Too often I forget to open up
And let the light in
And one day when all the stuff
That bonds and makes us something
Rise and falls away

We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be perfect
We'll all be home
