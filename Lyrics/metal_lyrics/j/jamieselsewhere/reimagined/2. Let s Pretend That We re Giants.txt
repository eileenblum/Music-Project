Itâs all the same, nothing's changed
Again, I find myself in the current
As I am gracelessly tossed around and around
Your words echo and your voice resounds
When we awake from our sleep
Weâll know that this is where weâre supposed to be
With walls, and walls
Of water for miles, oh

Just know that
We are so fragile
And easily broken
But I'll try my hardest
To put you back together
If you do the same for me

For now just sleep my sweet
Don't worry about what tomorrow brings
So letâs pretend that we're giants among common men
Because weâve never been taller than our demons within

We are so fragile
And easily broken
But I'll try my hardest
To put you back together
If you do the same

We are so fragile
And easily broken
But I'll try my hardest
To put you back together
If you do the same for me

Why did you have to leave me here to fend for myself?
Am I such a terrible man?
