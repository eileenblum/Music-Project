I remember a phone call, a quarter past nine
When you said, "this can't be," and you started to cry
And I could tell by your actions, and words that you spoke,
That you'd lost someone close, and your heart was half broken

And, oh, my God, do you do this out of love,
When you hold them in your arms and take them away from us?

You left us here alone, your old house just a shell.
Like a crab in the sea, you've moved on to another.
Well I know a few things, like, you're terribly missed.
And the whole time in the hospital, I kept thinking this:

That, oh, my God, how can you do this out of love,
When you hold them in your arms and take them away from us?

Well I finally broke down and started to cry.
I said "Was heaven not full enough, was that your reason why?"
I didn't wipe my tears, I let them dry like salt on my eyes,
Because I'm all out of answers; a pillar crumbling from the inside.
But I tried to be strong and be brave for you,
But I'm just a man, just as torn up as you.
But, I promise when you wake that everything will be fine.
When you wake the next morning, your heart will beat in time, and you'll say

Oh, my God, you do this out of love,
When you hold them in your arms and take them away from us.

I hope when it's my time that you can wake me from my sleep,
and say "It's time to go child," but no I won't weep
I'll say, "Make sure that they know this more importantly than others,
That I was a good son, husband, father, and brother."
And, I want you to be there when they talk to the doctors,
When they think all is lost, that you help them discover
That Heaven won't be full until all of us are there, when we're all together.
For now, just share with them:

That, oh, my God, you do this out of love,
When you hold them in your arms and take them away from us.
