And as we know what we were never could've last.
Pray for love, cause love is the only thing that you've never had.
So cry yourself to sleep again, and drift away.
Drift away... Get into this, realize there's no way around the truth.
You cannot stop asking yourself, who will love you now?
And as we know what we were never could've last.
And as the fog rolls in, you let go and drift away.
But how far will you fall until you fight for air?
I will not give in to this, you can't hold me back at all.
I do not belong to you, you cannot ask me for that.
