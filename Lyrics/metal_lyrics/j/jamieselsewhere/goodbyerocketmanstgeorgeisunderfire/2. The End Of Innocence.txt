Believe the lies you're leading.
Your eyes start to bleed and you can't keep telling yourself
it's all alright when you know that its not.
It's all you know, for all you know.

So just give it up, trust isn't an option now.
You're everything you warned me about.
With every second you regret all of the lies that split your teeth,
you come closer to finding that everything is lost for you.
You just cant believe it.

Believe the lies you're leading.
Your eyes start to bleed and you can't keep telling yourself
it's all alright when you know that its not.
It's all you know, for all you know.

With all respect you cant be expected to be held accountable.
Stop trying, now I've started over.
You could never be a part of the life I traded you for.

Believe the lies you're leading.
Your eyes start to bleed and you can't keep telling yourself
it's all alright when you know that its not.
It's all you know, for all you know.

Its what you wanted from us
to show you how to feel alive.

Its what you wanted but
its what you never could be.
Be yourself, be alone you liar.

Believe the lies you're leading.
Your eyes start to bleed and you can't keep telling yourself
it's all alright when you know that its not.
It's all you know, for all you know.

For all you know.
