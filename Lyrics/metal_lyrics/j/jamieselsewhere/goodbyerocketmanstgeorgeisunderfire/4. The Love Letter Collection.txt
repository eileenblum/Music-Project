Close your eyes, don't fall to pieces.

Bad luck has never been the safest foot to start with,
but what else could I do?
Its natural for us to think that this
could never be the same.
So throw it all away for all our insecurities.
Its alright.

Hold your breath and wait for sunrise.
You seem to try to find your worries in
the way I hold my own.
So close your eyes and count back to five.
You always try to dry your perfect tears,
and my shoulder's just too close.

Baby I cant, I cant just fight myself alone,
it's gotta be, it's gotta be the truth.
There must be a way to get through to you
Before it is, before it is too late.
This has such a bitter taste
Although we, we are the same.
You fell in love but I never felt the same.
So throw it all away for all our insecurities.
Its alright.

Hold your breath and wait for sunrise.
You seem to try to find your worries in
the way I hold my own.
So close your eyes and count back to five.
You always try to dry your perfect tears,
and my shoulder's just too close.

Follow your lines, don't stray from the script.
So I wont bleed for nothing, and you can't take it back.
Now I'm telling the truth, you asked for it.

Hold your breath and wait for sunrise.
You seem to try to find your worries in
the way I hold my own.
So close your eyes and count back to five.
You always try to dry your perfect tears,
and my shoulder's just too close.
