We fell so far from home,
conscious of all the questions you will never ask.
I'll wait and see if you can ever reach a different ending.
I'm holding my breath, and we don't have long.

But we are ok,
tonight is the only thing that matters.
It's everything you've ever wanted.
But we are ok,
and even as the world dissolves around us
we'll sit inside and watch it all come down.

Don't worry babe, we can work it out.

What have they done?
Is this the only choice for us to completely give in,
how could this happen?
For all we know this could have all been planned a long time ago.
So why be alone? We wont be alone...

But we are ok,
tonight is the only thing that matters.
It's everything you've ever wanted.
But we are ok,
and even as the world dissolves around us
we'll sit inside and watch it all come down.

Let the tide walk alone.
Rely on no one to pull it in.
Did you think that it would be different?
So did I...

But we are ok,
tonight is the only thing that matters.
It's everything you've ever wanted.
But we are ok,
and even as the world dissolves around us
we'll sit inside and watch it all come down.

Even as the world dissolves around us we will watch it all come down.
