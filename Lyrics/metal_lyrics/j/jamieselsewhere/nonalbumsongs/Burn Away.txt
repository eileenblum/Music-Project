Reveal yourself to me,
Something physical like the ground beneath my feet.
Or show yourself to me with a summer breeze
Blowing in between winter's trees
As far as the eyes can see.

And I'll wait here,
Patiently and watch the world slowly burn itself away,
Just burn itself away
And I'll dance here
Like a mad-man to the world,
But I don't care!
No, I don't care!
No no no

So I'll sit here
And watch the world slowly turning round and round
As it effortlessly dances with the sun.
And with the changing of the seasons,
I'll find another reason

And I'll wait here,
Patiently and watch the world slowly burn itself away,
Just burn itself away
And I'll dance here
Like a mad-man to the world,
But I don't care!
No, I don't care!
No no no

No no no

And I'll wait here,
Patiently and watch the world slowly burn itself away,
Just burn itself away
And I'll dance here
Like a mad-man to the world,
But I don't care!
No, I don't care!

And I'll wait here,
Patiently and watch the world slowly burn itself away,
Just burn itself away
And I'll dance here
Like a mad-man to the world,
But I don't care!
No, I don't care!
No no no
