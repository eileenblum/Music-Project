It's about time you let go!

You've sank into the sound of the cries
Buried in the back of your head
Her eyes fade to black as the sea goes silent
Like the heart that beats in your chest

Your true colors will show
When the eyes opens the storm forcing your back against the wall
Always lying to yourself
Let's stop blaming someone else
I hate your song
The same damn song

Your colors bleed the truth
Under the lies between your teeth
Built on fake perfections hollow ground
Don't turn back
Don't turn back to me

I remember the days
You'd give the shirt straight off your back and cover one thousand miles
Just to make me feel at home

Oh there's not a soul that could compare
And oh oh oh oh oh oh
Til you went numb and lost all feeling

Your colors bleed the truth
Under the lies between your teeth
Built on fake perfections hollow ground
Don't turn back
Don't turn back to me

And when the light burned out i'd hold you close
Until I realized I was still alone to find
You're just a ghost with an image

Whoa!

You best believe that this is not just a dream
You've sold what was left of your dignity
Reality enters your veins
Pulling you further away from our family setting the fire to end us all

Your colors bleed the truth
Under the lies between your teeth
Built on fake perfections hollow ground
Don't turn back
Don't turn back to me

And when the light burned out i'd hold you close
Until I realized I was still alone to find
You're just a ghost with an image

Whoa!

You're just a ghost with an image

And I was just too blind to see
