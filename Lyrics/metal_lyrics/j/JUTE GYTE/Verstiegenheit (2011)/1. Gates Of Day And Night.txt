An insistent sadness in the texture of things
Dusk, silence, iron chill
Loneliness in the bones
The sharpness of lengthening shadows
The grotesque transition from day to night
The fear and dread of you
All the beasts of the earth
And all the birds of the air
Every creature that moves along the ground
All the fish of the sea
They are given into your hands
Reasons are echoes,
Make no difference
