Enemy battleships lost in the fog
Firing blindly into the endless deep
The clouds are burning
Another great disappointment
The infantile longing for death unveiled
Consciousness is nature's nightmare
History is our own
And from it we awaken one last time
Rotten grain spilling from our bodies
Dying without even once having loved
something more than ourselves
The inalienable right of a billion eternally-newborn kings
The suicidal pleasure of the human alone
Stranded in the solipsist's temple
Ours is the heritage of free men
Free of all power and meaning
Free of everything at last
