The pathless woods
The lonely shore
The roar of the deep sea
The occulted screeching of owls in winter
The roaring of lions
The howling of wolves
The hopelessness at the heart of lust
The light that hangs above the fields
The church not made with hands
Lost portions of eternity
Too great for the eye of man or his moribund gods
All gone in a flash
The fear and dread of you
Look at it
Look it straight in the face
Look at it and without doing anything, suffer inexpressibly
Suddenly life has no meaning
