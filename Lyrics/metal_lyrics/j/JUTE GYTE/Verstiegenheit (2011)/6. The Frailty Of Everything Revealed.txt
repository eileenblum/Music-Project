A darkness on the edge of town
A flame burning through the forest
Wandering beyond limits
Clambering out on the precipice
We cannot return
What we have lost we cannot regain
It cannot be made right again
And so we are
Wandering the world of ash
Waiting for the end of the end
Dust is our food
Clay is our meat
Like water hurled from crag
To crag,
down into endless uncertainty,
I now give you everything
