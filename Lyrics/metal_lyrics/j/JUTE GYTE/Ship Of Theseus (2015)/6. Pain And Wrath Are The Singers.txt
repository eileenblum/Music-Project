Fixed to decay 
Knotted by habit 
The rituals of bound bodies 
The dull resonance that vibrates through these days 
The afternoonâs meshes 
Pale clotted light 
I tremble in nightmares of silence 
Lonely nights in empty houses 
The nightâs slow poison 
Aimless years from nothingness to nothingness again 
Kneeling before a void 
Brought into being in order to suffer 
New and dreadful liberty 
Pain and wrath are the singers 
The great work is a stone
