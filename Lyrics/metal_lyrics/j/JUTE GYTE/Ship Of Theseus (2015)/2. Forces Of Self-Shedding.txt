I cannot countenance the thought 
Of broken glass remaining broken glass 
The experience of repetition as death 
Memories once shifting grown solid 
Dismantling the past piece by piece 
Self-contempt and hatred for the lost self 
The full force of timeâs depthâs horror 
Cast back to the chain of desires 
Nailed to the cross of the ruined past 
Regression and nullification 
Greed of time and being
