Gargoyles of history beckoning 
Authorities of night 
The absolute opposition of thought and being 
The reduction to nothing by judgment and hand 
Immolated on the worldâs altar 
Insects devouring one another on an atom of mud 
Festivals of atonement 
A game with ideas 
The word always dies where the claim of some reality is total
