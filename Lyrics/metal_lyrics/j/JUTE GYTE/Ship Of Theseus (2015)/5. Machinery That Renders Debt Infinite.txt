The force which shapes blades on a hill of sickness 
The grafted skin and clinging cerements 
The overwhelming indifference of nature 
The procession of each successive moment 
The appeal for pity resonating in the void 
The black-lipped wound that mouths oblivion 
Machinery that renders debt infinite
