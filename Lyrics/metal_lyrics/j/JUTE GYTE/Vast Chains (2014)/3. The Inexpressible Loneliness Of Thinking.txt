The influence of repulsion
A continuity of nothingness
Mind betrays body
Body betrays mind
See us from outside
Vast worms knotted by habit
Vast chains to hold us down
The failure of intimacy
The impossibility of power
The inexpressible loneliness of thinking
The beast obscured by black dusk
