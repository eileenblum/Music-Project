Useless blood swayed by sunken moons
The misty sun is grown a dimmer gold
Where beauty with her doom conspires
To tell in flame what death and beauty mean
In a burnt land of ashes
Winter and silence and woe have come
Semen dried into the silence of rock and mineral
Silence all-attending and supreme
