The murdered innocence of the sea
Flux and permanence
The waveâs black banners break endlessly
The wolves of water that howl along our coast
The live red flame of sunset eating the dead blue sky
The sun-spangled blood of the woods
Broken souls and bodies ruinous
Sick with desire and fastened to a dying animal
Meaningless as a burnt scroll
that blackens with the passing of the fire
