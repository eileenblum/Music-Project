I cannot find a way through love and through
To lose this ever-aching loneliness in vaster solitude
Only a locked door
The long remorse
Vanished incommunicable moods
The dolor in the bells of blinded lands
The thousand-chorded monotones of pain
Locked doors without keys
Prisons without and prisons within
Labyrinths of newsprint
Coiled and rotting in your cave
The black wastes of the evening sky
Desolate oceans, and the light of lonely plains
What in our lives is burnt in the fire of this?
A burnt space through ripe fields
