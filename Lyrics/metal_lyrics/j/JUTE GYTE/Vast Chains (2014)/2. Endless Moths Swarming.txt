The burdens of embodiment and contingency
Omnipresent delimiters
An obsidian tower at every quadrant
Blood and flesh are the parody of desire
Lust is the plea before the executioner
Endless moths swarming
Golems of spoiled food and excrement
I have seen vases and polished brass
Reflect black windows
The gardenerâs lichenâs human scream
