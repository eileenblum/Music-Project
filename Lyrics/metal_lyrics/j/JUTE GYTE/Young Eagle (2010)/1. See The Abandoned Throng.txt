Porcine masses shepherded into cages of plastic and concrete and gleaming steel.  Bow in reverence to the freedom of automated defense systems and congenital defects.  A brave new world, sick and shining.  Hegel's Geist stillborn at last.  Suckling blood and oil from the lactating stigmata of Christ.
