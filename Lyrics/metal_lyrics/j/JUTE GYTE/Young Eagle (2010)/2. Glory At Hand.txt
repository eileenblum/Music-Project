A world of automatic doors and concrete dinosaurs.  Cherubs born of depleted uranium.  One last supper of yellow cake before being purified with the blood of a million lambs.  This is the fruit of the dual trinities.  The cruciform shadows of nuclear angels ejaculating manna from the heavens.  Worship death and your savior will always be near.
