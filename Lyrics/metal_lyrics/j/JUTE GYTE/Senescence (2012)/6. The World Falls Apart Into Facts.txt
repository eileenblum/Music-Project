The precincts of the city have rotted
The work of giants is rotting away
No coiled gold
Nor splendors of the earth
No ravening grey wolf
No sad-faced man tasked with burial
One easily divorces what was never united
Body from body
Particle from particle
The world falls apart into facts
Time fades away
Grown dark under the helm of night
As if it had never been
