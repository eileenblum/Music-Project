As autumn deepens and darkens
I feel the pain of falling leaves
And the silence of short days
The deep oblivion of earthâs lapse and renewal
The silence of infinitely open spaces
The wandering through endless nothingness
Careless years
Precious days
Oh, for any patent from oblivion
In preservations below the moon
