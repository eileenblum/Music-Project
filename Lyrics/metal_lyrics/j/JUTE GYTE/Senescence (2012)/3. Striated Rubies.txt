The spiders dead in their webs
The birds fallen from the sky
the monstrous putrescence,
physical and moral,
of everything in sight
Silver strips of bone
golden adipose tissue
Striated rubies of muscle now obsolete
The indignant refusal to countenance
That which is guaranteed
but now, upon receipt, cannot be believed
