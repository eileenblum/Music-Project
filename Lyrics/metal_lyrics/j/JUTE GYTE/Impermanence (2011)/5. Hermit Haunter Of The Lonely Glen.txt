Hermit haunter of the lonely glen
Common wild and heath
Lone heath and melancholy pond
The desolate face of rude waste landscapes
far away from men
A feeling I cannot describe
of lone seclusion and hermit joy
Smoke curls upwards through the naked trees
For a moment the lie becomes truth.
