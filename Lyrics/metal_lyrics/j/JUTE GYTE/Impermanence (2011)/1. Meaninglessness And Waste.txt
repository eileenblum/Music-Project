Age and pain and decay and death
Tower unimpeachable above every moment
And what I give and do not give
disappear tracelessly
Stones dropped into an endless well
The wind stirs the trees
I hear the builders striking with their hammers
and see the ruins
and the emptiness within the ruins
Vast and meaningless
An infinity and eternity of emptiness
Meaninglessness and waste
Hollow nothing
A boundless black veil
Swallowing all dimensions
And I know
And we know
The wind stirs the trees
Sunlight creeps through the branches
A reflection caught in a stream.
