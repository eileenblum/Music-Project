Among the trees at dusk
Gray grass, green moss, burnt-orange fern
A fallen tree consumed by bramble
The remains of a bird devoured by insects
We are quieted by trees and stones
By the illusion of stasis
Against the encroachment of time
Eyeless gaze, partial wing, gray talons
That passed away
So may this.
