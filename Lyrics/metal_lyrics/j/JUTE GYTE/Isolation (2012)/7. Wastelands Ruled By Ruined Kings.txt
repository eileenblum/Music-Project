A plague of nostalgia for a fictive past, 
Not merely dead, never born, 
is the most desperate form of escapism. 
Accident of birth, the pride of the insipid. 
Blood still runs, rose-tinted, 
Spilling on the red rock 
In starvation and waste 
In fanfares 
and marches 
and broad arching melody. 
Wastelands ruled by ruined kings. 
Curses never lifted.
