An indescribable sadness hung over 
These shifting forms and structures. 
The hopelessness of passing time 
And the melancholy 
Of unalterable past events. 
Quiet over the hilltops now, 
Woodland birdsong ceased. 
Alone 
beneath the sky I stand again. 
Wait, weary one: 
Soon, like these, 
We may also cease.
