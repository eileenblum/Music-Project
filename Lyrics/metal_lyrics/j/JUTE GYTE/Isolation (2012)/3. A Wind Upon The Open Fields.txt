The painful discrepancy 
Between the ideal and the real. 
The melancholic nostalgia of Brahms. 
A wind upon the open fields 
Like a burnt offering. 
The banished one listens 
In his night-dark lair 
To the songs of the ancient ones. 
An old, old fable haunts me, 
And will not let me rest.
