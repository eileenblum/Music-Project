A pale dwarf-wraith keels over, fatally injured.  Mouth gaping, revealing long, curved and yellowing hook-like teeth, it vomits a chunky white substance with the texture of curdled milk.  It foresaw this long ago, but now cannot believe.  Crimson patches darken a miniature black cloak.  Small hands clutch at the brumal air.
