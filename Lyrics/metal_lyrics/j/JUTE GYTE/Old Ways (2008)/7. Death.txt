The voidpistolâs infolaser rounds crackle and lash through the air.  There is a clatter of blade against blade.  Theta waves falter, move to delta.  Crimson blood bursts from endless lesions in thick snake contortions against the mournful snow.  Pain ceases localization, becomes something indescribably vast.  Life grinds into death.
