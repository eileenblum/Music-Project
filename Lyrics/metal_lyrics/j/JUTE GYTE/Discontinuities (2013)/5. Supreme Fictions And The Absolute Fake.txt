Wilderness, authentication, and deleterious exploitation
Resultant progress, alienation, loss
Great deserts of black sand
A peopleâs autumnâs Heliogabaline synonym
Now pale and cursed to wander winterâs rise
At the mercantile endpoint of Endlessnessâs eyeâs gaze
The vastness of commodification
The absolute fake
Evidence accumulated in whorls of ash
Catalogued and atomized, witnessed with oneâs own eyes
Surely we were a flame
