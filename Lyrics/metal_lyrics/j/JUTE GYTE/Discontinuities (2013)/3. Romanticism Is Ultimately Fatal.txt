To you who have turned aside
For whom light and color
And sound and odor
And taste and touch are dung
Natural truths spat like insults
To you defilers for whom the earth would flame
With a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom
The cremation of some vast corpse long dead
The loved oneâs whitest flesh is what the
broken glass will cut and the wheel crush
