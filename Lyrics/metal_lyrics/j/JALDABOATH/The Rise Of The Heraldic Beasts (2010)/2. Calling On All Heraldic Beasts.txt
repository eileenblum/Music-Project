Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Are you listening up high?

Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Calling on all Heraldic Beasts.

Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Hippogriff.

When mere and Griffin meets and mate
their offspring share a curious fate
one half is horse with hooves and tail
the rest is eagle claws and nail
and has a horse it likes to graze
in summer meadows dowsed in haze
yet has the eagle it can fly
above the clouds with dreams be high
with such a beast i am endeared [?]
emigrant [?] no less this beast has called
this crossbreed is but one of many
when on our shields we'll conquer any

Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Calling on all Heraldic Beasts.

Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Cockatrice.

As dragon and rooster to come as one
a birth is given to an unruly son
with the head of his father and body of scales
tis oft confused with the dragon of Wales
hatched from an egg where the king of toads
caught its gaze the beholder explodes
as rooster he calls the new days beginning
as dragon he roasts those guilty of sin
this Cockatrice surely belongs in hell
and on his greet the snake farewell
but raised in the crypts Jaldaboath dictate [?]
to attend his master with a call of his name.

Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Calling on all Heraldic Beasts. [x2]

Lion. Wyvern. Cockatrice.
Calling on all Heraldic Beasts.

Griffin. Dragon. Unicorn.
Calling all to the banners adorn.

Hey!
