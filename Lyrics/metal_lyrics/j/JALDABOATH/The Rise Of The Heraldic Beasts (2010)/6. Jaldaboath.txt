If your castle needs defending,
just call Jaldaboath.
If your catapult needs a-mending,
Just call Jaldaboath.
They'll make you dance,
the merry Jig Of Death,
dark minstrel's melodies.
Writing secret script,
from behind a crypt.
Jaldaboath!

For protection of your sires,
Just call Jaldaboath.
For your wenches' dark desires,
Just call Jaldaboath.
Whistlers in the castle,
blow a haunting melody,
writing secret script,
from behind a crypt.
Jaldaboath!

They say they are the best,
to where a chain mail vest.
The victories they've won,
are renowned.
These knights can't be beat,
they're strangers to defeat.
By no orders of the wyvern,
are they bound.

If your dragon needs a-slaying,
just call Jaldaboath.
If your minions aren't obeying,
Just call Jaldaboath.
When the Dark Ages get too much,
and there's no hope to be found,
writing secret script,
from behind a crypt.
Jaldaboath!
