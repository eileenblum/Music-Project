Axe Wielding Nuns
Axe Wielding Nuns

A battle weary knight sometimes needs a rest
to place his heavy head on a wench's breast
where the horse is well kept and his sword well oiled
his undergarments washed when they've been soiled

There is near Bagger Bridge such a place
to bring a smile to a knight's long face
to veer off a battle my stallion runs
to the convents of Axe Wielding Nuns

Axe Wielding Nuns
Axe Wielding
Hell hath no fury like the Axe Wielding Nuns
like a fire branded crucifix between the buns

Mother superior doth speak with grace
but if needs must she can handle her mace
the art of fighting is a solemn vow
thousands are certain common know how
They're gracious[?] interluder for they're chance to fight
for the glory of battle and a hot steamy knight
for another chance when they are able to wield
the double headed axe and the blazing shield

Axe Wielding Nuns
Axe Wielding
Hell hath no fury like the Axe Wielding Nuns
like a fire branded crucifix between the buns

When we ride out to meet our foes
a little surprise keeps them on their toes
for following behind is a garrison of nuns
some heavily pregnant with bastard sons
they swing their axes with gusto and might
'tis oft our enemies off get a fright
at the sight of somersaulting nuns at arms
axes in hand and cleaving fucking skulls

Axe Wielding Nuns ... [x10]
