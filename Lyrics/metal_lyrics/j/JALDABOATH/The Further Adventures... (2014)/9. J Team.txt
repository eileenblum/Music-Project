"In 1314, an order of troubadour knights were sent to Merlan by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the UK Metal underground. Today, still wanted by the Pope, they survive as minstrels of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them - maybe you can hire: Jaldaboath"

Riding forth like in a dream
We'll solve all your ills or change your regime
To call Jaldaboath, just give a scream
There's none more extreme (duh duh duh)
Midsummer knight's Wet Dream (dun d-duh duuuh)
Maybe you can hire the "J" team!

Fresh out of Merlan, the Oubliette of darkness
Jaldaboath - the Templars of Doom
Minstrels of fortune ride into the sunset,
Ready for hire - reputations exhumed

Riding roughshod through the turnpikes and toll booths
Highway men scarper when they hear the thundering hooves
Dick Turnip's men are nowt but rapscallions
Money or your life' - I'll give it to your wife

Coming to save your castle from a sieging
Stop on the way to do a bit of wenching
Unsheathe the sword and do a bit of thrusting
Bleeding the plebs (whatever that means...)

Riding on horse-back screaming like wild beasts,
Jaldaboath slay their foes from west to east.
Bones they are a'crunching 'neath the mace of doom
Skulls they are smashed - we're gonna get you all!

We're coming to save you (if you have the cash)
Always lay waste to and turn your foes to ash
