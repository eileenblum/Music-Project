Gweneth, my love it over-flows and spillith
Come ride my steed into the night,
do not be frightened, for I am enlightened
(at least, enough to see the way!)
Onwards - into the concert (faces painted)
By blasting drums we are elated and the howls,
and anti-Christian growls enough to shake your bowels!

Oh oh oh o-oh she's a Black Metal Beauty!
Oh oh oh o-oh she's got me feeling fruity!
Oh oh oh o-oh touch that Black Metal booty!
Oh oh oh o-oh 'tis my Black Metal duty!

Bedsit, this hovel is not very well lit
just enough to see the shadow of her breast
Inverted cross on chest, my sword completes the quest.
Plumpish, this wenches bitches smell of codfish
I'll not return another day, but now I'll have my way.
...Well - if you think you can find something more appetizing in a bloody band t-shirt, good luck to you!

"...If the truth be told, this wench is but a beast as if cast from the very bowels of hell itself. For even great Lucifer could not stand the sight of this grotesque evil dwarf in a mini-skirt!..."

Escaping, in early morn fore she is waking
I cannot stand the shame of being seen
leaving this goblin queen
Could fault be too much ale?

Homebound, onto the castle and to safe ground
And please my men be on the guard in case she comes
She's just one of those you wish you hadn't shagged

Sham-ed - all is lost and nothing gain-ed
What have I done, but shame my clan
I now feel less than a man
T'was not a cunning plan
Nooooo!
