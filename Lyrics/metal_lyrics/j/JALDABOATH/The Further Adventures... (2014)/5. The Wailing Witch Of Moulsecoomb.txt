To many she's just a malignant bitch
But the truth is she's an evil witch.
She boils up spells in her gingerdread house
And in her hair there lives a mouse!

Her smell, when near, offends the nose,
For she has not time to wash her clothes,
Black cats 'n goblins are friends and kin
They boil the bones of the slain within.

Beware the Wailing Witch of Moulsecoombe!
Her spells invoke your doom
(she's coming to get you)
Beware the Wailing Witch of Moulsecoombe!
If you're a sinner,
she'll eat you for dinner!

A cretinous oaf's her captive mate
Their offspring share their woeful fate
The Scum-flecked walls, and haunted halls,
lying beyond the foreboding gate

Her own reflection is the best attack
Her ugly mush doth push her back.
But there is a way to escape her wrath:
By following the knightly chivalrous path.

"Witch of Moulsecoombe - the boiler of seas,
she beats the fearless warriors to their knees.
Raising an army of skull-headed duds,
the earth shakes with thunderous buttock-thuds.
So rally the horses and assemble the men.
We will ride out to meet this fat hen;
blow her away with the mace of doom,
and send her fat ass spinning to the moon!
(or thereabouts...)"

The wailing Witch of Moulsecoombe!
Her reign is ending soon, we're coming to get you!
The wailing Witch of Moulsecoombe!
But if you're a sinner,
she'll eat you for dinner...
